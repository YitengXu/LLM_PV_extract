    , Accepted 10th September 2015First published on 10th September 2015AbstractWe demonstrate bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.39% by incorporating a small molecular compound 2-[4-(N-butyl-N-phenylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl]-4-[(4-(N-butyl-N-phenylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]-3-oxocyclobut-1-en-1-olate (SQ-BP) as the additional donor material into a poly[[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT):[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) host binary blend. Incorporating SQ-BP into the PCDTBT:PC71BM host blend film increases the photon harvesting of a ternary photovoltaic device with a broad absorption spectrum from 300 nm to 750 nm, which results in an increased short-circuit current density (Jsc). In addition to efficient photon harvesting, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between PCDTBT and SQ-BP is also the reason for the increase in Jsc. As a result, the PCE of ternary devices with 10 wt% SQ-BP is about 30% greater than that of PCDTBT:PC71BM-based binary OPVs.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) is a candidate for renewable energy technology as it has the advantages of being lightweight with a large surface area, flexible and low-cost, which make it amenable to roll-to-roll high volume production.1–4 Many methods have been used to improve the performance of OPVs such as synthesizing new p-type, low-bandgap materials,5–8 using effective interlayers,9–11 optimizing device morphology12–14 and inventing new device structures.15,16 Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells has reached 11%17 for a triple-junction polymer solar cell and 9–10%18,19 for binary polymer:fullerene single-junction solar cells. But there are still many factors restricting the performance of OPV, such as limited light harvesting and low carrier mobility, which limit the overall PCE of organic solar cells to 10–12%.20
To expand the absorption spectrum of OPV, many strategies have been studied. Synthesizing new low-bandgap materials is one method but it takes too much time. A tandem architecture can broaden the absorption spectrum of OPVs,21–23 as the cells allow collection of photons resonant to the bandgap of all the polymers used to minimize the thermal losses. However, tandem architectures are based on a complicated multi-layer stack with serious technical challenges such as the processing of a robust intermediate layer and the coupling of light absorption between sub-cells as well as the thickness of solution processed active organic layers in each sub-cell.24,25 Recently, an elegant alternative strategy has been realized to extend the spectral sensitivity of wide bandgap polymers into the near infrared (NIR) region by adding a narrow bandgap sensitizer25–30 to form the ternary film, which contains two donors and an acceptor or a donor and two acceptors. According to recent research, there are several mechanisms that lead to the improvement observed in many ternary solar cells: increased light absorption,31 improved charge transfer,32,33 energy transfer,34 and phase separation.35 Improvement of the abovementioned mechanisms could eventually result in a high-efficiency single-junction organic photovoltaic, which can exceed the proposed efficiency limit of 17%.36
In this article, we demonstrate, for the first time, an efficient bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPV with a PCE of 6.39% by incorporating a small molecular compound, 2-[4-(N-butyl-N-phenylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl]-4-[(4-(N-butyl-N-phenylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]-3-oxocyclobut-1-en-1-olate (SQ-BP) as the additional donor material into a poly[[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT):[6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) host binary blend. The BHJ OPV with SQ-BP as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor showed a PCE of 4.86%, which indicated that SQ-BP is an efficient donor material.37 The PCDTBT absorption shows a spectrum from 350 nm to 650 nm and SQ-BP has a near-infrared absorption spectrum from 550 nm to 750 nm. Incorporating SQ-BP into the PCDTBT:PC71BM host blend increases the photon harvesting of a photovoltaic device with a broad absorption spectrum from 300 nm to 750 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of PCDTBT has a large range overlap with the absorption spectrum of SQ-BP, as shown in Fig. 1(d), which makes it possible for Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to occur between PCDTBT and SQ-BP. This leads to a reduction in the energy loss through exciton recombination and enhancement of the performance of the prepared cells.

Experimental
The SQ-BP dye used in this study was synthesized according to a literature procedure.37 PCDTBT (bought from 1 Material Inc.) and PC71BM (bought from nano-c) were commercially purchased and used as received. The blend solution of PCDTBT:PC71BM:SQ-BP was prepared as follows: PCDTBT and PC71BM were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) with weight ratios of 1:2 and a total concentration of 30 mg mL−1, and the solution was stirred in a N2-filling glove box at 30 °C for 12 h. SQ-BP (weight ratios of SQ-BP to PCDTBT were 3 wt%, 6 wt%, and 10 wt%) was subsequently added to the blend solution.
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 ohm square−1 were cleaned consecutively in an ultrasonic bath containing detergent, acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 20 min each and finally blow-dried by high purity nitrogen. The substrates were treated by UV-ozone for 5 min, and an 80 Å MoO3 layer was thermally evaporated onto the ITO substrates under a vacuum of 3 × 10−4 Pa at a rate of 0.5 Å s−1. The active layers, PCDTBT:PC71BM as a reference and PCDTBT:PC71BM:SQ-BP (1:2:x), were spin-coated onto the MoO3 films at 2500 rpm for 40 s in a N2-filled glovebox. The wet films were slowly and completely dried in covered glass Petri dishes in a N2-filled glovebox. Finally, LiF (7 Å) and Al (1000 Å) films were deposited on the top under a vacuum of 3 × 10−4 Pa at a rate of 0.2 Å s−1 and 1.5 Å s−1 respectively. The deposition rate and film thickness were monitored in situ by a quartz crystal oscillator mounted to the substrate holder. The active area is 6 mm2. The final device structure is ITO/MoO3/PCDTBT:PCBM:SQ-BP/LiF/Al. The current–voltage curves were measured using an Abet solar simulator with a Keithley 4200 source measurement unit under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2), after spectral mismatch correction under an ambient atmosphere. The absorption spectrum was obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC spectrometer under an ambient atmosphere. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured using a QE/IPCE Measurements Solar Cell Scan 100 (ZOLIX) system under an ambient atmosphere. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of films were obtained using a Perkin Elmer LS-55 spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence decay was measured using a JY Tempro-01-NL under excitation of 373 nm NanoLED. The chemical structures of the organic materials used in this paper are shown in Fig. 1(a) and the device structure of the OPVs is shown in Fig. 1(b). The energy level diagrams of different materials used in the device fabrication and carrier transport paths are shown in Fig. 1(c). The PL spectrum of PCDTBT solution and the absorption spectrum of SQ-BP solution are shown in Fig. 1(d).
Results and discussion
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the PCDTBT neat film, SQ-BP neat film and PCDTBT:PC71BM:SQ-BP (1:2:x) ternary blend films are shown in Fig. 2(a). The PCDTBT absorption shows a broad spectrum from 350 nm to 650 nm with two peaks at 392 nm and 555 nm. The SQ-BP dye has a high extinction coefficient at 647 nm. The absorption intensity from 300 nm to 600 nm of the blend films does not change with the concentration of SQ-BP. This indicates that the addition of SQ-BP did not hamper the absorption of PCDTBT and PC71BM. The absorption of the blend films between 650 nm and 750 nm monotonically increased as the SQ-BP concentration increased. As a result, the cooperative absorption of PCDTBT and SQ-BP covers a significant part of the solar spectrum, with only limited overlap.

Fig. 2(b) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PCDTBT:PC71BM:SQ-BP devices with different SQ-BP concentrations in the active layer under AM 1.5 G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The detailed parameters of the OPVs are shown in Table 1. We predicted that the Jsc of the devices would increase with the addition of SQ-BP. The Jsc increased from 10.13 mA cm−2 for the control device with PCDTBT:PC71BM as the active layer to 12.83 mA cm−2 after adding 10 wt% SQ-BP, due to the expanded UV-Vis spectral absorption range of the PCDTBT:PC71BM:SQ-BP ternary layer. And the Jsc of the ternary devices monotonously increased with the concentration of SQ-BP, 11.09 mA cm−2 at 3 wt%, 12.02 mA cm−2 at 6 wt% and 12.83 mA cm−2 at 10 wt%. The PCE increased from 4.91% of the control device to 6.39% when the concentration of SQ-BP was raised to 10 wt%, similarly to Jsc. But, further addition of SQ-BP to 15 wt% led to a lower Jsc, which was only 11.77 mA cm−2 and the PCE decreased to 5.68%. From the series resistances (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh) of devices that were extracted from illuminated J–V curves, we found that incorporating SQ decreases Rs compared to the control device. This indicates the better contact between the active layer and the electrodes in ternary devices. The Rsh of the device with 15 wt% SQ-BP was extremely low (373.34 Ω cm2 compared to 535.27 Ω cm2 for the control device), which indicates a large leakage current across the cell and contributes to the lower FF. On the contrary, the Voc of the devices were not significantly affected by the addition of SQ-BP, so that the difference between the ternary devices and the control devices is only 0.02 V.

Fig. 2(c) shows the EQE of PCDTBT:PC71BM:SQ-BP devices with different SQ-BP concentrations in the active layer. The enhancements in the EQE can be divided into two parts, 350–600 nm and 600–800 nm. The EQE of ternary devices with an SQ-BP concentration less than 15 wt% from 350 nm to 600 nm increased compared to the control PCDTBT:PC71BM device, which can be attributed to the additional exciton dissociation and charge carrier collection induced by the introduction of SQ-BP. The absorption of SQ-BP strongly overlaps with the photoluminescence of PCDTBT, as shown in Fig. 1(d). We suppose that FRET is responsible for the increase in EQE in this range. In a neat PCDTBT film, a part of the photo-excited PCDTBT may turn back to ground state through recombination and does not result in a photocurrent. When nearby SQ-BP molecules are present, some of the photo-excited PCDTBT non-radiatively transfers energy to SQ-BP, which eventually improves the utilization of the energy of incident photons in the range of 350–600 nm. Tenghooi Goh et al. have also reported a similar phenomenon.38 But further addition of SQ-BP to 15 wt% led to a lower EQE from 300 to 600 nm, which indicates that over-doped SQ-BP disturbs the carrier transport in blend film. This can be further proved by the carrier mobility of blend films herein below. The EQE from 600 to 800 nm monotonically increases with the concentration of SQ-BP in the devices, which is a direct consequence of SQ-BP absorbing photons in this region.
The hole mobility of SQ-BP (∼2.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) is lower than that of PCDTBT (∼1.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). To learn whether the addition of SQ-BP damaged the hole mobility of PCDTBT:PC71BM film, hole-only devices were fabricated with the structures ITO/MoO3/ternary film/Au. We measured dark J–V characteristics of the devices and then fitted the results using a space charge-limited current (SCLC) model.39–41 The current density is given by (1)where ε0 is the permittivity of free-space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer, L is the thickness of the active layer and μ is the mobility. The dark J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices are shown in Fig. 3. Using eqn (1), we can obtain the value of the hole mobility. The hole mobilities of blend films whose concentration of SQ-BP was 0 wt%, 3 wt%, 6 wt%, 10 wt% and 15 wt% were ∼1.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, ∼1.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, ∼1.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, ∼1.03 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ∼8.55 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This demonstrated that the addition of a small amount of SQ-BP had little impact on the carrier transport of blend films. Therefore SQ-BP is an appropriate material for a ternary solar cell base on PCDTBT:PC71BM host film. It is worth noting that over-doped SQ-BP can disturb the carrier transport in blend films, which would ultimately lead to lower Jsc and PCE values for the devices.
 Fig. 3  Dark J–V characteristics of ternary hole-only devices with different concentrations of SQ-BP (0 wt%, 3 wt%, 6 wt%, 10 wt% and 15 wt%) used for hole mobility measurement. 
The energy level diagram for the devices is shown in Fig. 1(c). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PCDTBT is between those of SQ-BP and PC71BM. The LUMO of PCDTBT and SQ-BP are almost the same and their energy level offset to PC71BM is 0.7 eV. Such an energy gradient for the PCDTBT:PC71BM:SQ-BP matrix makes exciton dissociation and charge carrier transfer feasible at both interfaces of PCDTBT/PC71BM and SQ-BP/PC71BM.42,43 When an incident photon is absorbed by the active layer, a geminate exciton can be generated, which will eventually turn back to the ground state either by non-radiative or radiative relaxation. This will lead to energy loss from the device. But through FRET, the geminate recombination loss can be partially “recovered” by transferring energy to the FRET acceptor molecule for exciton generation.38 FRET is a non-radiative energy transfer process that acts through long-range dipole–dipole interactions between donor and acceptor molecules.34 This process takes place with neither light emission by the donor nor light absorption by the FRET acceptor and leads to a reduction in the donor's fluorescence intensity and excited state lifetime. Incorporating SQ provides another energy transfer route from excited PCDTBT molecules to SQ-BP molecules, which finally results in more excitons being harvested in the ternary films. Therefore, there may be three routes for exciton generation and dissociation into charge: (I) PCDTBT molecules absorb incidence photons and produce excitons, then parts of excitons are dissociated at the interfaces of PCDTBT and PC71BM; (II) SQ-BP molecules absorb incidence photons and produce excitons, then these excitons are dissociated at the interfaces of SQ-BP and PC71BM; (III) part excitons of PCDTBT transfer energy to SQ-BP molecules to form excitons, then these excitons of SQ-BP formed by the energy transfer from PCDTBT are dissociated at the interfaces of SQ-BP and PC71BM.
To further understand the possible dynamic processes of energy transfer and charge carrier transport in ternary devices, the photoluminescence (PL) of neat PCDTBT and blend PCDTBT:SQ-BP = 1:x films was studied. The films for PL measurement were fabricated on optical quartz plates and the fabrication procedure was the same as that of the devices. The PL spectra under excitation of 373 nm are shown in Fig. 4, in which the PL intensities of blend PCDTBT:SQ-BP = 1:x films are enlarged 5 times. The PL emission peak of neat PCDTBT is located at 699 nm and the full width at half maximum is 96 nm. The emission of PCDTBT was quenched severely with the addition of SQ-BP even when the concentration of SQ-BP was only 3 wt%. The quenching efficiency (eqn (2)) can be used to quantify energy transfer from the relative peak intensity (I) in Fig. 4. In this equation, IPCDTBT is the PL intensity of PCDTBT for the emission peak at 699 nm and I is the PL intensity of blend films at 714 nm. (2) The values of ϕq for blend films with 3 wt%, 6 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt% and 20 wt% SQ-BP were 89.93%, 94.40%, 97.02%, 98.23% and 98.64%, respectively. Overall, the optical data strongly suggest that PCDTBT and SQ-BP are excellent candidates for forming an effective FRET pair in OPVs.

Photoluminescence decay measurements were carried out to understand the energy transfer between PCDTBT and SQ-BP. The neat PCDTBT and blended PCDTBT:SQ-BP = 1:x (x = 6 wt%, 10 wt%, 20 wt%) films were probed at 699 nm under excitation from a 373 nm pulse NanoLED source. The fluorescence decay traces of neat PCDTBT film and blended films, as shown in Fig. 5, were fitted with a two-component-exponential function. The lifetimes of the 699 nm emissions are about 2.91 ns for the neat PCDTBT film and ∼2.84 ns, ∼2.65 ns and ∼2.31 ns for 6 wt%, 10 wt% and 20 wt% blend films, respectively. The decrease in the lifetime of the excited state of PCDTBT indicates that energy transfer from PCDTBT to SQ-BP molecules has occurred. It is proven that the FRET from PCDTBT to the SQ-BP molecule decreases the energy loss through radiative emission of excited PCDTBT molecules in ternary solar cell devices and provides a potential pattern for improving photon utilization, which will eventually improve the performance of the photovoltaic devices.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a novel BHJ ternary OPVs system with improved efficiency by incorporating SQ-BP into a PCDTBT:PC71BM host blend. The PCE of PCDTBT:PC71BM:SQ-BP ternary photovoltaic devices with 10 wt% SQ-BP increased to 6.39% compared to 4.91% for PCDTBT:PC71BM binary solar cells, which is mainly due to the increase in Jsc. The increase in Jsc is caused both by the broader absorption spectrum of the ternary devices and an enhancement through FRET to decrease the energy loss of excited PCDTBT, which improves the photon utilization. Furthermore, we believe that there are several other methods that can be used to optimize the already high efficiency of our devices such as: (i) improving the morphology of ternary film by annealing or use of solvent additives; and (ii) choosing another charge injection layer to enhance the current collection. Overall, this study shows that the performance of OPVs can be increased by adopting ternary blend films, which has research significance with respect to the industrialization of OPVs due to the convenient and low-cost fabrication process.
