    , Accepted 15th May 2016First published on 16th May 2016AbstractThe effects of molecular arrangement on the singlet exciton diffusion properties of free-base carboalkoxyphenylporphyrins containing a variety of alkyl substituents were investigated in solution-cast thin films. Exciton diffusivity was calculated using relative quenching efficiencies (Q) obtained by measuring the singlet photoluminescent decay lifetime PL(t) of pristine porphyrin films and films doped with 0.06–0.2% volume fraction of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butryic acid methyl ester (PCBM). The quenching efficiency and PL lifetime decay data was used in a 3D exciton diffusion Monte Carlo simulation model to extract the exciton diffusion coefficient (D) and diffusion length (LD). Five carboalkoxyphenyl porphyrins (TCAPPs) were synthesized and analyzed in solution-cast thin films, tetra(4-carbomethoxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCM4PP), tetra(4-carbobutoxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCB4PP), tetra(4-carbohexoxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCH4PP), tetra(4-carbo-2-ethylhexoxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCEH4PP), and tetra(4-carbooctoxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCO4PP). Longer alkyl chain derivatives yielded increased PL decay lifetimes and extended the exciton diffusion lengths (LD) for octyl (TCO4PP) and hexyl (TCH4PP) porphyrin derivatives. We observed an increase in the LD from 15 nm for TCM4PP to 25 nm for TCH4PP, while a branched alkyl chain derivative (TCEH4PP) showed the lowest LD of 14 nm. UV-Vis and XRD data indicate that molecular organization is strongly dependent upon the peripheral carboalkoxy chain, and that nematic molecular organization resulted in an increase in the exciton diffusion length. Our findings are an important step toward a deeper understanding of the exciton diffusivity and molecular packing relationship of simple free-base porphyrins.
Introduction
A cascade of events in photosystems I and II leads to successful harvesting of photons, which includes ultra-fast energy transfer (<100 fs) to redox mediated centers for catalytic conversion of water and carbon dioxide into simple sugars and oxygen.1–3 The light absorption and energy transfer mechanisms, facilitated by an ideal stacking pattern of chromophores in these natural systems, has inspired researchers to pursue new synthetic light-harvesting antenna assemblies.4–10 Porphyrin molecules are structural analogues of chlorophyll, and are suitable building blocks to mimic these light-induced energy transport systems. Porphyrins have also shown good efficiencies in solar energy conversion applications, particularly 3rd generation photovoltaics such as dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells and solution-processable bulk heterojunction solar cells.11–21 In organic solar cells, strongly coupled donor–acceptor porphyrin materials have demonstrated efficiencies within range of the highest small-molecule and polymer-based devices.21,22 Although these reported devices have taken advantage of the high light absorptivity and structural tunability porphyrins afford, optimizing excited-state (exciton) diffusion lengths (LD) has been given less attention due to the use of bulk heterojunctions to enable efficient exciton dissociation. Most high efficiency organic solar cells use blends that form high surface area interfaces, which increase the probability that excitons will reach the donor/acceptor interface before recombination. This critical engineering development has enabled the creation of high efficiency devices using materials with exciton diffusion lengths LD of 10 nm, a distance much smaller than the absorption depth of many organic semiconductors.23–29 This approach, however, does increase the likelihood of electron–hole recombination in the photoactive layer, which limits power conversion efficiencies. Incorporating materials with optimized or directed exciton diffusion can enable photoactive layers to be assembled in the absence of nanostructured donor/acceptor interfaces.28–33 This is particularly attractive for assembling solution-processable porphyrin photoactive layers through self-assembly and/or controlled molecular stacking using low-temperature processing conditions.34–37 If this strategy is to be useful for increasing the efficiency of porphyrin-based devices, molecular design guidelines are needed to understand how exciton diffusion lengths are affected by porphyrin molecular film organization. This approach may ultimately lead to the ability to manage exciton transport in a wide range of porphyrin-based photochemical applications in addition to organic solar cells.
We have recently reported the singlet exciton diffusion lengths (LD) of mixed-substituent carbomethoxyphenylporphyrins in solution-cast thin films.38,39 Exciton diffusion lengths (LD) and diffusion coefficients (D) were determined by measuring the photoluminescence lifetime (τS1) of pristine films and films incorporated with small amounts of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to obtain bulk quenching efficiencies (Q). The (Q) values, PL(t) decay lifetimes, and quencher volume fractions were then used in a 3D Monte Carlo exciton diffusion simulation to calculate exciton diffusivity.40,41 The technique is comparable to a variety of methods reported for measuring exciton diffusion lengths and has been shown to be sensitive to active layer morphology.34,40,42,43 Initial XRD studies indicated minimal organization in the solution-cast carbomethoxyphenylporphyrin thin films. However, good bulk quenching efficiencies and long-lived excited states led to measured diffusion lengths (LD) of 15 nm for the tetrakis(4-carbomethoxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCM4PP) derivatives. This is similar to a previously reported self-assembled porphyrin film (LD ∼ 15 nm),37 and close to the highest reported diffusion length in a nematically organized porphyrin film (LD ∼ 22 nm).36
Currently, the exciton diffusion length of only a few porphyrin systems have been measured,35,38,43 leaving a major gap in our understanding of how molecular interactions and packing influence excited state energy transport in this important class of synthetic macrocyclic dyes. The goal of the following work is to understand how porphyrin shape and intermolecular interactions affects organization in solution-cast thin films and influences singlet excited state energy diffusion. In particular, we are interested in how changing peripheral alkyl substituents of carbomethoxyphenyl porphyrin derivatives lengthens or modifies promising exciton diffusion lengths previously observed with this family of porphyrin compounds.38 We have prepared solution-cast thin films using a series of newly synthesized carboalkoxyphenyl porphyrins with varying alkyl chain lengths and branching, and have studied their excited state dynamics using time-resolved and steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy. We demonstrate an increase in porphyrin molecular organization and singlet exciton diffusion length up to LD ∼ 25 nm that is dependent upon peripheral carboalkoxyphenyl group. We also show that quenching efficiencies decrease above a certain carbon chain length, whereas PL(t) decays continue to increase but do not result in longer measured LD due to lower rates of exciton diffusion (D). Spectroscopic evidence and thin film XRD patterns suggest that certain carboalkoxy substituents favor nematic and/or homeotropic porphyrin self-assembly, which improves their thin film excited-state energy transfer properties.
Experimental

Materials for porphyrin syntheses. 
1-Bromobutane, 1-bromohexane, 1-bromo-2-ethylhexane, 1-bromooctane, dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chlorobenzene (CB) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin was obtained from TCI America and used as received. 1H-NMR measurements were obtained with a JEOL 300 MHz NMR. Solution and thin film UV-Vis spectra were collected on a Cary 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer using DCM and THF for solution measurements. Solution and solid-state fluorescence measurements were taken on a Jobin Yvon-Spex Fluorolog equipped with a 389 nm diode laser. PL decay measurements of thin films using TCSPC were taken on a Spectra Physics MaiTai, operating at 80 MHz equipped with a femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser. Porphyrin film thicknesses were measured with a Dimension 3100 SPM System (AFM) with a Nanoscope IV controller. XRD θ/2θ patterns were obtained using a Panalytical X'Pert Pro MPD with Ni filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) from a fixed anode at 45 kV, 40 mA. Thin film data were collected within the range of 5° < 2θ < 120° with a 0.02° step size, and a counting time of 0.35 s per point.

c. Porphyrin thin-film preparation and characterization
Glass microscope slides were washed and sonicated in glass-cleaning detergent and isopropyl alcohol, then dried with N2 followed by UV-ozone treatment. Solutions of carbomethoxyphenylporphyrin derivatives were made in chlorobenzene under nitrogen atmosphere (6 mM for each derivative – TCM4PP, TCB4PP, TCH4PP, TCEH4PP, TCO4PP) and stirred for 24 h before spin coating. For each derivative, solutions were doped with PCBM at volume fractions of 0.2% and 0.06% (vfrac). The doped porphyrin solutions with PCBM were stirred for 15 min before spin coating. Spin-cast films were formed by casting the porphyrin solutions at 2000 rpm for 60 s under N2 atmosphere. Porphyrin solutions and glass slides were warmed to 70 °C prior to spin coating to encourage uniform film formation. The spin-cast film thicknesses were found to be between 20 nm to 25 nm. Photobleaching during photophysical measurements was avoided by encapsulating the films under N2 using epoxy and a coverslip. The PCBM vfrac (total volume occupied by PCBM molecules versus the blend volume) was calculated using previously reported methods,38,40 with porphyrin densities found experimentally to be ∼0.97 g cm−3. The PL(t) decay lifetime of each porphyrin film was measured using a laser repetition rate of 200 kHz with excitation at 410 nm. PL(t) data was fit to double and triple exponential decays using Igor Pro 6.3 software. The fitted PL decays, quenching efficiencies, and vfrac were used to obtain exciton diffusion coefficients (D) using Monte Carlo eDiffusion Software simulations.40
Results and discussion
a. Exciton diffusion coefficient (D) and diffusion length (LD)
The mechanism of exciton diffusion in molecular semiconductor thin films is often described as sequential Förster resonance energy transfer with a random walk migration (diffusion) of excited-states hopping from one molecule to the next.47 Förster theory describes the rate of energy transfer as a function of distance between two weakly coupled molecular dipoles and the radius of energy transfer (R0), as illustrated in eqn (1) and (2). (1) (2) The Förster (R0) radius is dependent upon the orientation of the molecular dipoles (κ), the spectral overlap integral (λ is wavelength, FD is normalized fluorescence, and σA is absorption cross-section), and photoluminescence efficiency (ηPL). The molecular orientation (κ) is important for optimizing exciton transfer in organic semiconductors,48 and increasing the strength of the molecular transition dipole can also enhance the diffusion rate. To determine the exciton diffusion coefficient of these porphyrin thin film materials, a time resolved bulk quenching model with a Monte Carlo eDiffusion computational simulation was utilized.38,40–42 This convenient method has demonstrated it's usefulness for determining the exciton diffusion in conjugated polymers and in thin films of porphyrin dyes.40,42,49,50 Methods used previously to measure LD such as PL surface quenching, exciton–exciton annihilation, time-resolved microwave conductivity, spectrally resolved PL quenching, and Forster resonance energy transfer theory show good agreement with the bulk quenching technique.42,43 The use of highly processable PCBM allows for strong fluorescence quenching due to intrinsic energy levels that are sufficiently offset to dissociate a photoexcited state between the porphyrin and PCBM material.28,31,32 The diffusion simulation models excitons hopping randomly in a 50 × 50 × 50 nm simulation box until a quenching site is reached.40 Inputs for the diffusion simulation are the volume fraction of PCBM in the porphyrin film, single photoluminescent lifetime (τS1), and the relative quenching efficiency (Q), which is a ratio of the integrated average lifetime of a porphyrin film doped with PCBM quenchers to the pristine average lifetime as shown in eqn (3). (3) The 3D exciton hopping simulation is repeated until the experimental PL decays converge with the exciton diffusion model resulting in a calculated exciton hopsize (s) used to calculate D and LD (eqn (4) and (5)).40 (4) (5)

In general, the average singlet PL lifetime decays τS1 of the pristine films increases with carboalkoxy chain length with TCM4PP (2.2 ns), TCB4PP (2.5 ns), TCH4PP (3.5 ns), TCEH4PP (3.1 ns) and TCO4PP (6.3 ns) (Table 1).

Remarkably, the τS1 of the octyl derivative (TCO4PP) is close to the observed emission lifetime of the derivatives in solution (8.6–8.9 ns, Fig. S1, ESI†). The PL decay data suggests a decrease in the direct porphyrin–porphyrin contact for the longer alkyl chain derivatives resulting in suppression of the nonradiative decay rate.51,52
Incorporating small amounts (0.06% to 0.2% volume fraction) of PCBM into the porphyrin films shortens the fluorescence lifetime as a result of diffusion and quenching of excitons at a porphyrin:PCBM interface. Similar PCBM distribution is expected with low volume fractions in each of the porphyrin films as demonstrated by good quenching efficiencies (both steady-state and time-resolved PL quenching) that increase with PCBM concentration to yield similar exciton diffusivity (Table 1).40,41,43 The calculated (eqn (3)) average quenching efficiencies increase with increasing PL lifetime decays from the methyl to the hexyl derivatives (Q = 0.35–0.52). However, the branched derivative (TCEH4PP) showed the smallest average quenching efficiency of 0.30 for films doped with 0.06% PCBM. The average quenching efficiency of the octyl derivative (TCO4PP) was lower than the hexyl derivative (TCH4PP). When calculating the exciton diffusion length (eqn (5)), TCH4PP also showed the longest average diffusion lengths of 21.3 ± 3.4 nm with a maximum LD of 25 nm. The PL decays for all the derivatives produced similar diffusion coefficients as modeled by Monte Carlo eDiffusion simulations with D values ranging from 0.9 to 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 (Table 1). The octyl derivative (TCO4PP) gave the lowest diffusion coefficient (D = 0.9 × 10−4 cm2 s−1), however, due to a very long-lived PL decay lifetime, the calculated LD is the 18.7 ± 4.8 nm. Although the exciton diffusion lengths are much greater than previously reported tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives such as meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP − LD = 0.7 nm) and an ethylphenyl derivative (H2TEPP − LD = 7.5 nm), the measured D values ranging from 2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 to 7 × 10−4 cm2 s−1, are similar to those reported here.35–37,53–55 Overall, the hexyl derivative (TCH4PP) exhibited the highest average Q, D, and LD among the series of five carboalkoxyphenyl porphyrin derivatives with maximum values of D = 3.14 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 and LD = 25 nm. Steady-state fluorescence bulk quenching studies also reveal good Q efficiencies for both TCH4PP and TCO4PP, which are far superior to the methyl, butyl, and ethylhexyl derivatives (Table 1 – QSS).
b. Porphyrin thin film and solution UV-Vis spectra
Carboxyphenylporphyrins have been extensively studied as light-sensitive structural units for metal–organic frameworks and in light-harvesting systems such as dye-sensitized and bulk heterojunction solar cells.4,8,11,44,56–58 Unfortunately, the carbomethoxphenyl derivative (TCM4PP) shows poor solubility in commonly used organic solvents used for most molecular electronic applications, and requires a solvent pair to process uniform thin films.38 We found that replacing the methyl ester with butyl, hexyl, ethylhexyl, and octyl ester groups greatly increases their solubility (6 mg mL−1 for TCM4PP to 80–100 mg mL−1 TCO4PP) and improves their processability for spin-casting thin films.
In solution, the derivatives show identical UV-Vis spectra with absorption peaks in the Soret band region at 418–419 nm (ε = 400–500 × 103 M−1 cm−1) representing the strong S0–S2 transition and four Q bands absorbances at 514, 548, 591, and 647 nm (S0–S1 transitions – Q4, Q3, Q2, and Q1 – Fig. 2b). Varying the carboalkoxy substituents does not affect the absorption properties of the free-base tetraphenylporphyrins, nor does it affect the steady-state emission and fluorescence lifetimes (τS1 = 8.6–8.9 ns, Fig. S1, ESI†). The spin-cast films show significant changes in the absorption spectra, most notably with a red-shifted and broadened Soret peak likely due to close porphyrin stacking and an increase in the π–π macrocycle interactions.44,54 Thin films of TCM4PP exhibit the largest red-shifted Soret peak at 434 nm. Interestingly, as the alkyl groups increase in size and branching, the red shift is less prominent with the TCEH4PP (ethylhexyl – 421 nm) and TCO4PP (octyl – 422 nm) derivative showing the least red-shifted spectra. This suggests that the long chain and branched alkyl chain porphyrin derivatives contribute to the molecular orientation and average spacing between the porphyrins in spin-cast thin films. Evidence of molecular self-assembly in the thin films of TCB4PP, TCH4PP, TCEH4PP, and TCO4PP is observed with a Q1 absorbance (∼650 nm), which is more intense than the Q2 absorbance (∼600 nm).59,60 This spectral feature is absent from the absorbance spectrum of the TCM4PP film and is also not present in the absorbance spectra for all the derivatives in solution. For free-base tetraphenylporphyrins in solution without π-electron-containing substituents on the β-pyrrole positions, the four Q-bands should depict an increase in the absorbance intensity from Q1 thru Q4 and is referred to as an etio-type spectrum (etioporphyrins).61 This feature was observed with all the TCA4PP derivatives utilized in this study in solution, but was only seen in the thin film absorbance spectra for the TCM4PP derivative (Fig. 1a and b). Lastly, a small feature found only in the absorbance spectrum of the hexyl derivative (TCH4PP) is a peak at 400 nm on the shoulder of the Soret Band. This Soret peak splitting pattern is indicative of a strong excitonic coupling between stacked porphyrin molecules,60 and supports the exciton diffusion data that suggests the hexyl porphyrin derivative is well-organized for efficient exciton transport.

c. Porphyrin thin film XRD patterns
Additional thin film structural data was obtained from X-ray diffraction studies (Fig. 3a – Fig. S3, ESI†). The XRD pattern of TCM4PP thin films show a broad peak (2θ = 10°–35°) and the absence of any strong diffraction peaks indicating minimal periodic structure. This peak is also found in the XRD pattern for TCB4PP, TCH4PP, and was also previously observed in thin films containing tetra(4-butylphenyl)porphyrins.54 Three sharp peaks are present in the XRD pattern with varying intensity for thin films containing the TCB4PP, TCH4PP, TCEH4PP, and TCO4PP derivatives (approx. 2θ = 6°, 22°, and 34°). Similar 2θ values and intensities were obtained for peaks at 2θ = 22° and 2θ = 34° with the exclusion of TCB4PP, which did not show the diffraction peak at 2θ = 34° (Fig. S3, ESI†). The diffraction peaks appearing near 2θ = 6.0° indicate self-assembled stacks of porphyrin molecules aligned perpendicular to the surface with a calculated d-spacing between the stacks ranging from 13.97 Å to 15.30 Å (Fig. 3b). The d-spacing values are in good agreement with previous reports of solution-cast thin tetraphenylporphyrin films with similar packing and interplanar stack distances of 14 Å.37 Reports of both tetraphenylporphyrins and zinc-octaethylporphyrin exhibited surface stacking with a molecular orientation angle between 23° and 50° between the surface and the plane of the porphyrin macrocycle.37,62 Interestingly, the TCEH4PP branched alkyl chain derivative exhibited the largest interplanar d-spacing with 15.3 Å, while the TCO4PP octyl alkyl derivative exhibited the closest packing distance of 13.9 Å. The ratio of relative intensities for the 2θ = 6.0° peak to the more intense 2θ = 22° peak is similar and approximately 2:1 for thin films containing TCB4PP, TCEH4PP, and TCO4PP porphyrin derivatives. The ratio of relative intensities is 5:1 in the XRD pattern of the TCH4PP derivative. This suggests that the TCH4PP film has a higher composition of phases containing uniformly aligned porphyrin molecules stacked on the surface in a nematic/homeotropic arrangement.36,54 The largest relative peak intensities for 2θ = 6.0° were observed for films containing TCO4PP and TCEH4PP derivatives, suggesting preferential stacked arrangement (Fig. 3b) with porphyrin edge-on alignment observed previously with self-assembled coordinating porphyrins.37

d. Exciton diffusion and porphyrin film organization
The butyl, (TCB4PP), hexyl (TCH4PP), ethylhexyl (TCEH4PP), and octyl (TCO4PP) porphyrin derivatives all show evidence of self-assembly in the UV-Vis film data. TCEH4PP exhibited the least red-shifted Soret Band absorbance presumably indicating lowered π–π macrocycle interactions in the thin film. The hexyl derivative (TCH4PP) shows evidence of strong excitonic coupling between stacked porphyrin molecules from the UV-Vis absorbance spectrum with splitting of the Soret band. XRD data indicates that a self-assembled stack orientation predominates in the solution-cast thin films of the TCEH4PP and TCO4PP derivatives while the TCH4PP derivative has a greater concentration of nematic or homeotropic phases present in the bulk. Aggregation and disorder is likely also present in the porphyrin thin films containing TCM4PP, TCB4PP, and TCH4PP owing to lowered exciton lifetimes observed in the thin film PL decay data. The branched ethylhexyl (TCEH4PP) alkyl chain derivative exhibits an XRD pattern with the greatest relative intensity of peaks that suggest preferential self-assembled molecular organization (Fig. 3b). In addition, the calculated d-spacing was largest in films with the TCEH4PP derivative. The edge-on nature of this type of porphyrin stacking (Fig. 3c) is suspected to contribute to the lowered rates of measured 3D exciton diffusion. A previous study of large, flat aromatic perylene derivatives also indicated that an edge-on arrangement of molecules led to a decrease in exciton diffusion.63 A nematic organization, shown in Fig. 3c yields a more organized distribution of the molecular planes, thus enhancing the excitonic coupling between porphyrin molecules.64,65 Spectroscopic and XRD diffraction data suggests that the hexyl derivative (TCH4PP) assembles preferentially in a nematic and/or homeotropic molecular organization, thus contributing to the observed strong excitonic coupling and long exciton diffusion lengths.
Conclusions
The singlet exciton diffusion coefficients and diffusion lengths for a series of five carboalkoxyphenyl porphyrins with various alkyl chain lengths have been measured using time-resolved photoluminescent studies. We have found that the exciton diffusion is sensitive to the molecular packing (which is highly dependant upon peripheral alkyl substituents) of these derivatives in solution-cast thin films. XRD diffraction data indicates an increase in the presence of nematic/homeotropic assembly of the hexyl (TCH4PP) derivative resulting in relatively strong excitonic coupling, and increased measured exciton diffusion coefficients. The measured exciton diffusion coefficient of a branched ethylhexyl (TCEH4PP) derivative showed the shortest exciton diffusivity with a greater presence of a stacked molecular assembly. Both the hexyl (TCH4PP) and an octyl (TCO4PP) derivative showed a significant increase in exciton diffusion length from the methyl (TCM4PP) derivative. Thin films of TCH4PP exhibited diffusion lengths ranging from 20–25 nm, more than double the LD of many organic semiconductors currently used in organic photovoltaics devices. The TCO4PP derivative showed a remarkably long-lived photoluminescent lifetime (6.3 ns), however, the diffusion rate was the lowest of all the derivatives. Thus, the TCH4PP derivative has a balanced mix of phases resulting in molecular organization that promotes exciton diffusion. This work demonstrates the sensitivity of how free-base porphyrin dye molecular packing in solution-cast films can substantially affect excited-state energy diffusion. This work is useful for future studies aimed at designing macrocyclic light-harvesting dyes used in optoelectronic applications where efficient/rapid exciton diffusion is a requirement.
