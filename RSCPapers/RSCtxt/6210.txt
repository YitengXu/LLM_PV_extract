Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. in 1977 by the Nobel Prize winners Shirakawa, MacDiarmid and Heeger. This paper, which is one of the most cited ChemComm articles of all time, motivated the rapid development of conducting (conjugated) polymers and the birth of plastic electronics.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the materials chemistry community was abuzz with a new family of molecular conductors based on organic charge transfer (CT) salts.1 Many of these materials showed metallic properties in single crystals with the most famous example, TTF-TCNQ, providing the first major breakthrough in high conductivity from a purely organic species. This material was reported to have a room temperature conductivity of 500 S cm−1 with a maximum value of 10000 S cm−1 at 53 K.2 Whilst many donor–acceptor complexes of this type have been reported, electron-rich organic small molecules can also be doped by exposure to halogens, forming open-shell donor cations with closed-shell halide counter-anions. In parallel to this work, MacDiarmid and co-workers studied the effect of doping poly(acetylene) (PA) with iodine and bromine vapour.3 Remarkably, the room temperature conductivity of the undoped trans-isomer (4.4 × 10−5 S cm−1) was elevated to a maximum value of 38 S cm−1 on treatment with iodine, representing the highest reported conductivity at that time for an organic polymer. For the cis-isomer, which is less thermodynamically stable, the relative increase in conductivity upon doping was even greater. Intuitively, this was perceived as a milestone in the area, since high levels of conductivity were expected to be exclusive to highly crystalline materials with long-range order and extensive molecular orbital overlap in the bulk.The potential impact of this work was further emphasised by the accessibility to a highly conductive material that has the attributes of a conventional polymer. From an ideal perspective, polymers can be mechanically robust, chemically inert, lightweight, easily processed and cheap. Coupling these features with metallic conductivity was certainly a highly attractive and potentially lucrative prospect. In particular, polymers could address the challenge of how to apply organic conductors in device structures, since crystalline CT systems have the strong disadvantages of being brittle and non-processable. Despite the exciting results reported by MacDiarmid et al.,3 further progress with this polymer was hindered by its chemical instability, lack of solubility, intractability and the presence of impurities. Early challenges for conducting polymers in general were associated with these issues and there was much scepticism about the use of the materials in devices. However, this did not deter further work on this fascinating new class of conductors. In the early 1980s, Feast developed a clever strategy that circumvented the problem of processability of PA due to poor solubility. This was accomplished through a precursor approach, utilising a soluble non-conjugated polymer that releases a volatile by-product upon heating to give PA of very high purity (see example in Scheme 1).4,5 Similar precursor strategies were applied to the preparation of other insoluble conjugated polymers, such as poly(para-phenylene),6,7 PPP, and poly(para-phenylenevinylene),8 PPV.   Scheme 1  Generation of trans-PA from a soluble precursor. Another approach towards soluble, processable aromatic polymers with conducting or semiconducting properties is to introduce side-groups that facilitate solvent interactions, disrupting the tight packing of the polymer chains in the solid state. Solubilising groups were thought to be detrimental to charge transport properties, reducing the degree of crystallinity and imparting a more amorphous character to the bulk polymer, but it was later found that the nature of the side groups and their position in the polymer chain can be used to great advantage for desirable electronic and charge transport properties9 and subsequently that three dimensional order in polymers can be achieved through judicious regio-positioning and spacing of these side groups, giving rise to unprecedented order in conjugated polymers10 (see Fig. 1). It can be said that, up to a certain point, the immediate interest in MacDiarmid's work and subsequent research was focused on high conductivity, concomitant with the realisation of CT salts as superconducting materials.1 However, two major discoveries led to the appreciation of a greater worth of conducting polymers – as simple organic semiconductors. In 1990, Burroughes and co-workers discovered that PPV produces bright light under an applied field in a diode array in response to the injection of holes and electrons (electroluminescence).11 Although light-emitting devices had already been demonstrated using vacuum processed small molecules,12 polymers have the advantage of being solution processable (providing a potentially cheaper deposition technology, although this point is hotly debated), to give films that are less likely to crystallise than vacuum deposited small molecules (crystallisation over time can be detrimental to device stability and lifetimes). Moreover, solution-based processing of conducting polymers13 provides a mechanism to produce large-area devices.14 Fig. 1  Top left, 3D AFM of pBTTT-C14, a material with high charge carrier mobility, showing terrace-like topology; right, view along the polymer axis, illustrating backbone tilt and planarity, side chain interdigitation and lamellar registration; bottom left, model of the crystalline domains. The second milestone was the discovery by Wudl, Heeger and co-workers that a donor–acceptor blend of poly(2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) and fullerene C60 demonstrated photoinduced electron transfer.15 This in turn led to the realisation of an organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell with a power conversion efficiency of 2.9%.16 The main feature of this blend was that the two types of materials formed a bulk heterojunction (BHJ), with the two phases interspersed on the nanoscale. This morphology provides large surface area interfaces that support the generation of a charge separated state with efficient subsequent charge migration to the corresponding electrodes of the device. The use of both donor and acceptor units was a major advancement at that time, especially compared to single component polymer OPVs, which at the time were typically three orders of magnitude lower in efficiency than the first reported BHJ device.The achievements detailed above spurred the organic materials community into intense research on conducting polymers and their applications. Focusing more on the chemical structure of these polymers rather than their basic conducting properties, at some point in time the spotlight was taken away from the term conducting polymers and this class of material became more commonly referred to as conjugated polymers. The most common materials can be grouped into generic structures, each with their own base properties that can be manipulated by the introduction of side-chain functionalities. In addition to the structures discussed already, common conjugated polymers include poly(aniline), poly(pyrrole), poly(thiophene), poly(fluorene), poly(aryleneethynylene) and many more. There are numerous applications associated with these materials, some of the most topical being electrochromic devices (the manipulation of the colour of a film as a function of electrochemical doping),17,18 water-soluble biosensors,19,20 chemical sensors,21 polymer lasers,22 energy storage devices/batteries23 and organic field effect transistors (OFETs).24 The latter is a good example of how intricate the general field of study can be. Along with OPV materials they are arguably the most complex examples from the above, because the behaviour and function of the semiconductor films involve several factors (e.g. HOMO–LUMO energy levels, crystallinity, dimensionality, reorganisation energy, processability, functionality, interactions at interfaces, directional alignment; for OPVs, tuning the band gap to maximise sunlight absorption, nano-dimensional domain formation to maximise electron–hole separation, balance of charge carrier mobilities, etc.). Furthermore, OFET materials link very well with the concepts presented at the beginning of this article, which focus on the charge transport properties and self-assembly of CT salts and doped PA. Of particular note is the crystallinity of PA, with both isomers forming fibres. Variable temperature measurements on doped, highly conducting PA show that conductivity decreases with decreasing temperatures,3 and this non-metallic behaviour is thought to arise from short-range contacts in the bulk due to grain boundaries. Similar inferior charge transport between crystal domains is a common problem for OFET materials, but substantial efforts have been made to control morphology by the structural design of semiconductors and the method of their deposition.25 In particular, whereas alkyl or other side-groups were once thought to be potentially detrimental to the charge transport properties of polymer semiconductors, these are now found to be extremely useful in promoting a desirable morphology in thin films, particularly after thermal annealing.10Taking stock of headline results achieved with conjugated polymers in the laboratory, You et al. have reported a polymer tandem solar cell with a certified power conversion efficiency of 10.6%,26 whilst polymer-based OFETs have been reported with mobilities up to 10.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.27 It is inevitable to benchmark these achievements alongside that of silicon and other inorganic semiconductors, but one should regard both types of materials as complementary technologies, with suitability dependent on economic and environmental considerations and the nature of the application itself. Solar cells based on amorphous silicon have a wide range of efficiencies depending on the device architecture, but a general target of ca. 10% has been a long-term target for OPVs to enable them to compete with silicon on the market. That goal has now been surpassed, but one should be aware of major developments in parallel technologies, such as Sharp's recent announcement of a certified 37.9% efficiency from a triple-junction compound solar cell based on III–V materials. The high mobilities mentioned above for polymers, up to 10.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, compare very favourably with silicon – higher than that of amorphous silicon (0.1–1 cm2 V−1 s−1), and approaching that of polycrystalline silicon (>10 cm2 V−1 s−1).27Molecular weight, polydispersity, purity and chain-end functionality are factors that are highly influential on the morphology of polymers, their properties and performance in devices. Delicate synthetic control is therefore demanded to ensure reproducibility between batches of materials as device characteristics can vary greatly (for example, see ref. 28). For these reasons, there is strong justification to take the oligomer (or ‘small molecule’) approach and there have been some significant recent successes. For example, an oligothiophene-containing organic solar cell has been reported with a certified efficiency of 7.61%,29 whilst OFETs with mobilities up to 31.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been achieved for the small molecule 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene.30 The increasing interest in oligomers and small molecules can easily be attributed or strongly linked with the wealth of knowledge gained from studies on conjugated polymers.If one takes a holistic view of the impact of conjugated polymers and other organic semiconductors, then the result is extremely impressive with some quite mouth-watering products emerging on the market or in development. Examples include large screen OLED televisions with a mere width of 4 mm, foldable smart phones with even thinner dimensions and artificial skin made from OFETs that respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli. In September 2012, the 4th annual Chemical Sciences and Society Summit (CS3) meeting took place in San Francisco. The topic of the meeting, Organic Electronics for a Better Tomorrow: Innovation, Accessibility, Sustainability, was attended by 30 scientists from China, Germany, Japan, the UK and the USA. The discussion aimed to help shape the landscape for future work in the field and a White Paper† was produced to be presented to the scientific community and policy makers. It was summarised that plastic electronics is predicted to be a multibillion pound industry in the short term and that the field is rich in yet unaddressed challenges that will push the boundaries of our imagination much, much further. As a self-confessed ‘gadget freak’, I marvel at the progress being made by multidisciplinary research teams in industry and academia. For me it is a treat to be part of the large community that is helping to progress the field, which was truly kick-started by the seminal work of MacDiarmid and his colleagues.Notes and referencesM.
