    , Accepted 30th April 2021First published on 7th May 2021AbstractMetal chloride-intercalated graphite intercalation compounds (MC-GICs) show a perfect sandwich structure with high electronic conductivity and chemical stability, but there are few applications for MC-GICs in anode materials of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we selected a splendid host microcrystalline graphite (MG) to synthesize an AlCl3 intercalated MG intercalation compound (AlCl3-MGIC) anode material and demonstrated that it is suitable for SIBs via electrolyte optimization. The AlCl3-MGIC electrode is primarily compared in four electrolytes. Sodium storage is proposed for co-intercalation and conversion reactions by simultaneously selecting a compatible NaPF6/diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) electrolyte. As a result, the AlCl3-MGIC anode delivers a specific capacity of 202 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 after 100 cycles and still exhibits a satisfactory capacity of 198 mA h g−1 after 900 cycles. Density functional theory calculations further illustrate that DEGDME solvent molecules offer moderate adsorption energy to sodium ions that guarantees structure stabilization of GICs during repeated cycling. This work provides a theoretical basis for designing sodium ion storage with a graphite layered structure and unveiling the prospects of MC-GIC materials as high-performance anodes.
1. Introduction
In order to implement the steady integration of intermittent energies that include tide, wind, and solar energy into the grid large-scale stationary energy storage is used.1–3 Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have recently attracted academic attention due to the resources of sodium being naturally abundant and low-cost and Na-ion storage mechanism similar to Li-ion batteries (LIBs).4–7 Primary criteria of stationary energy storage systems are high specific capacity, high rate capability, low-cost, long cycle life, and high safety.8–11 Therefore, a suitable electrode material for SIBs needs to be obtained to ensure large-scale energy storage applications. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing cathode materials such as layered sodium transition-metal oxides, P2, or O3, and structures that showed high rate capability and long cycling stability.12–16 However, the advance in anode materials to match cathodes is still unsatisfactory. Recently, several kinds of promising anode materials have been investigated such as intercalation anodes, for example, the well-known binary graphite intercalation compound (GIC) C6Li in LIBs. However, it cannot be formed as efficiently in SIBs because the radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) is much larger than that of Li+ (0.76 Å), resulting in crystalline mismatch between the graphite layer lattice and Na-ions.17–19
In order to solve the mismatch issue of the graphite anode, modifying the electrolyte is a significant and practical approach.20–24 Ether-based electrolytes are proved to be less useful in LIBs owing to their inferior ability of protection and passivation on both cathodes and anodes; however, they have been recently reinvigorated in SIBs due to the highly reversible Na-solvent co-intercalation into graphite (Cn + e− + Na+ + y(ether-solvent) ⇄ Na+(ether-solvent)yCn−).25,26 On the other hand, theoretical capacity calculation suggests that metal chlorides (MCs) such as FeCl3, ZnCl2 and AlCl3 provide high capacities by conversion reaction.27–30 In spite of their high theoretical capacity, the actual application of these MC anode materials for SIBs is still in its infancy. One commonly recognized factor is the capacity fading caused by poor conductivity, high hygroscopicity and intrinsic high solubility of chlorides in various solvents of electrolytes. Another major reason impeding the application of MCs in SIBs is the discharge product of NaCl, which may well easily dissolve in the majority of the organic solvents, thus causing severe capacity decay. So far, the MCs are just applied to the anodes of LIBs, and few reports have used MCs as anodes for SIBs, except the Na-CuCl2 rechargeable battery.31 All the strategies toward improving the LIB cycle life of MC anodes substantially focus on MCs-graphite intercalation compounds (MCs-GICs), a sandwich-structure composite material, to provide high electronic conductivity (higher than both insertion and host) and unique structure avoiding the high hygroscopicity of MCs.32–35
Herein, we have designed GICs as the anode of SIBs. To prove this idea, AlCl3 was chosen as a model microcrystalline graphite (MG) insertion owing to its high theoretical gravimetric capacity of 400 mA h g−1 and favorable conversion reaction potential (∼0.75 V vs. Na+/Na) to avoid metal sodium dendrite formation. Meanwhile, to demonstrate this idea, low GIC formation temperature was chosen to achieve low power consumption and MG was chosen as an excellent graphite host with an isotropic orientation structure because of the large-scale preparation of AlCl3-intercalated MG compounds (AlCl3-MGICs). Moreover, methoxymethane (DME), diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) and ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) electrolytes were investigated for the electrochemical storage of sodium. It was believed that by unveiling the underlying option for the electrolytes, this work extends our understanding of the GIC materials for SIBs and provides insights into the design of a better approach to employ not only GICs but also other intercalation-based hosts as anode materials for SIBs.
2. Results and discussion
The MG derived chloride-intercalated GICs (MG-GICs) have benefits of anodes with high tap density, favorable electronic conductivity and satisfactory electrochemical performance for Li-ion storage compared to natural flake graphite GICs having the benefits of reversible capacity and cycling stability.32–34 Therefore, MG was chosen as a host material to synthesize AlCl3-MGIC which was selected as an example to explore the better sodium storage performance of MG-GIC anode materials. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared AlCl3-MGIC, MG and AlCl3. Prominently, the characteristic XRD peaks of AlCl3 were vacant in the AlCl3-MGIC, stemming from the AlCl3 molecules were consistently intercalated within the interlayer space of graphite, forming a GIC (i.e., AlCl3-MGIC) instead of a composite or mixture.36 Furthermore, the G(002) peak of graphite also disappeared which can simultaneously be presumed that the graphite is not fully intercalated by AlCl3. In order to accurately determine the content of the intercalated AlCl3 guest, it was directly annealed in an oxygen environment at 950 °C for 3 hours to completely remove the graphite component and completely oxidize the AlCl3. According to our previous research, it is speculated that the final combustion product can be indicated as Al2O3. According to weight change and conversion ratio, the AlCl3 content in AlCl3-MGIC was 19.8 wt%.33 Additionally, the AlCl3-GIC XRD data show some excess peaks that result from the intercalation of AlCl3. The plane crystal (001) reflected by XRD is based on the relationship Ic = di + (n − 1) (0.335 nm), Ic represents a single unit cell repeated along the c-axis, di is the height of the GIC, n is the GIC order, and 0.335 nm represents the graphite layer spacing. From the Ic and di values obtained, it can be seen that the characteristic peak of AlCl3-MGIC shows a major stage of 7, and there are mixed stage compounds of 3 and 5 at the same time.37 All samples show strong peaks at around 1340 cm−1 (D band), 1579 cm−1 (G band), and 2673 cm−1 (2D band). Compared with graphite (ID/IG = 0.15), AlCl3-MGIC exhibits the highest ID/IG ratio of 0.29, indicating structural deformation during the intercalation process and the recovery of the graphitic structure after the intercalation process, and this result is also inconsistent with the intensity evolution of the G (002) peak in XRD patterns.38 The Raman spectroscopy system was used to study the structure difference and evolution process of the graphite matrix and AlCl3 into microcrystalline graphite.39
 Fig. 1  (a) Wide-angle XRD patterns and (b) Raman spectra of microcrystalline graphite and AlCl3-MGIC; (c) and (d) high-resolution XPS profiles of Al 2p and Cl 2p in AlCl3-MGIC, respectively. 
The valence state of the AlCl3-MGIC sample was detected and analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The full XPS survey spectrum exhibits four dominant peaks, including Al 2p, C 1s, Cl 2s and Cl 2p (Fig. S1†). The mild shift of the characteristic peak position of C 1s from 284.5 eV (pristine) to 284.8 eV (current) that should be assigned to the AlCl3 was intercalated, through fracture of bond between graphite sheets.32 In the Al 2p spectrum (Fig. 1c), the main peaks are located at 75.6 eV, corresponding to AlCl3 characteristic peaks28 respectively. The Cl 2p spectrum (Fig. 1d) shows two obvious peaks at around 198.8 eV and 200.1 eV, which can be identified as Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2 signals of Cl−, indicating that the combination of graphite and chlorine bonds between adjacent graphite layers is well preserved.33 The results exhibit that the interlayer spacing of the graphite matrix coexists in the AlCl3 state at the molecular level.40
The surface morphology after intercalation of MG and AlCl3 was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results are shown in Fig. 2a and b. After intercalating AlCl3, the graphite surface has no obvious change, and the overall shape remains unchanged. AlCl3-MGIC showed discontinuous single-layer graphene and fuzzy lattice fringes, further indicating that the degree of graphitization is low. After the metal chloride is inserted, the distance between adjacent graphite layers is greatly increased.41 AlCl3 remains in the upper or lower layers of graphite due to the weaker bonds formed between the layers and the inserted atoms.42 Moreover, the graphite layers became puckery and twisty, particularly in the AlCl3-MGIC sample (Fig. 2c and d). The high-magnification TEM (Fig. 2d) shows the wavy structure and expanded the lattice fringe spacing (about 0.68 nm) due to AlCl3 intercalation, which is higher than the value of the (002) plane of graphite. The results indicate a big difference in the pristine structure of the graphite host and the derived GICs. The results of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and elemental distribution diagrams clearly show the coexistence and regular uniform distribution of carbon, aluminum, and chlorine (Fig. 2e and f). Interestingly, the intercalated AlCl3 guest stably exists between the graphite layers at the molecular level. It does not get easily dissolved due to the close bonding and strong interaction of the graphite layer. It can be inferred that AlCl3-MGIC with a large curled interlayer spacing and a twisted graphite layer helps to stabilize the insertion and extraction process of sodium ions and accelerate ion diffusion, so as to stabilize the cycle performance and accelerate the reaction kinetics.

The geometric properties of the AlCl3-GIC anodes were analyzed using N2-adsorption (Fig. S2†). Their N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms exhibit a combination of type I (a unique trait of micropores) and type IV (typical peculiarity of mesopores).43 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and Brunauer–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore volume were calculated to be 6.01 m2 g−1 and 0.02 cm3 g−1, respectively, which are much smaller than those of some expanded graphite and even close to those of commercial graphite anode materials.44,45 Through testing, the tap density of AlCl3-MGIC is 0.95 g cm−3, which is much higher than that of the original microcrystalline graphite material. Because aluminum chloride has a layered structure when synthesized by the molten salt method, agglomerated large particles cannot be inserted between the layers. Combining the existing XRD, SEM, Raman and TEM analysis, it can be proved that the inserted AlCl3 is a layered structure.40,46
The AlCl3-MGIC anode was utilized for the construction of SIBs in different electrolyte systems. The cycling stability of the sodium ion battery was tested at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 (Fig. 3a). Table S1† shows the first cycle charge/discharge performance and initial coulombic efficiency of DEGDME, DME, TEGDME and EC/DEC. The decreased reversible capacities in the first 20 cycles are mainly attributed to two reasons: (1) the occurrence of the irreversible side reactions with the formation of SEI film. The increasing thickness of the SEI will cause the enhanced internal resistance of the battery and hinder the ion diffusion, thus leading to a rapid decrease in battery capacity. (2) Aluminum chloride particles of about 0.38 nm between layers of graphite, while MG particles of about 20 μm in diameter. In the first 20 cycles, the structure of MG is rearranged, owing to sodium ion-solvent co-insertion, which results in capacity decay. Then, the subsequent stable reversible capacities are mainly attributed to the interaction between the solvent molecule and MG. For DEGDME and TEGDME electrolytes, the coulombic efficiency of the AlCl3-MGIC anode gradually reaches ∼95% at the subsequent cycles, showing high reaction reversibility for the storage of sodium ions. Surprisingly, in the DME systems, the AlCl3-MGIC anode only delivers capacities of 125.6 mA h g−1, respectively. The variation of capacities in different electrolyte systems for the AlCl3-MGIC anode results from dense interlaminar structures since these finite graphite sheet spacings of AlCl3-MGIC are supposed to consume a large amount of electrolyte, resulting in the formation of a solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. As for AlCl3-MGIC in the EC/DEC electrolyte, the capacity and capacity retention ratios are only 97 mA h g−1 and 11% after 100 cycles, under the same test conditions. Fig. 3b reveals the representative discharge/charge profiles of AlCl3-MGIC for the 30st cycle in DEGDME, DME, TEGDME and EC/DEC electrolyte systems. The first discharge profile includes long and flat plateau corresponding to the process of sodiation and the SEI formation.47 The initial discharge and charge capacities of AlCl3-MGIC were 495.4 and 279 mA h g−1, respectively, giving a high ICE of 56.3%. As a reference, the AlCl3-MGIC anode in the EC/DEC electrolyte system shows a very low first discharge and charge specific capacity, 426 mA h and 290 mA h g−1, respectively, and only a low first coulombic efficiency of 40%. In order to explore the change of sodium storage performance of GICs with the intercalation of AlCl3 and improve the process conditions, the cycling performance increases with the increase of the AlCl3 content, which can effectively prove that the intercalation of AlCl3 has changed the physical/chemical properties of microcrystalline graphite (Fig. S3†).48 Then, the rate performance of the AlCl3-MGIC anode in DEGDME and EC/DEC electrolytes was studied. In the DEGDME electrolyte, the discharge capacity of the AlCl3-MGIC anode is 259 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, and when the current density increases to 0.5 A g−1, 1 A g−1, 2 A g−1 and 5 A g−1, the specific capacities are 220 mA h g−1, 179 mA h g−1, 135.4 mA h g−1 and 83 mA h g−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the current density drops from 5.0 A g−1 to 0.2 A g−1, and the capacitance can still remain 210 mA h g−1, which shows that the AlCl3-MGIC anode has good reversibility in sodium ion batteries (98.4%) (Fig. 3c). Obviously, it is better in DME and TEGDME electrolytes for rate performance. In contrast, the AlCl3-MGIC anodes in the EC/DEC electrolyte show relatively inferior rate performances. The rate capability has significant advantages among these graphite-based anode materials with micrometer-scale particles and tight stacking layers.49,50 Notably, the cycle performance and rate performance of AlCl3-MGIC are evidently higher than those of microcrystalline graphite (Fig. S4†), which usually delivers a low reversible capacity due to the unfavorable mismatch between the small interlayer spacing of graphite and the big Na-ion size. Additionally, a rate performance comparison reveals that the high-rate capability of the AlCl3-MGIC anode is superior to those of many other carbon-based SIB anodes reported so far (Fig. S5†). The superior sodium storage rate performance in such large particles is undoubtedly ascribed to the high electronic conductivity and enlarged interlayer distance of graphite layers for fast interfacial intercalation and internal diffusion of Na-ions.

The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the AlCl3-MGIC anode (Fig. 3d) in DEGDME, DME, TEGDME and EC/DEC electrolyte systems were recorded within a potential window of 0.005–3.0 V. In the first cathodic scan of the DEGDME electrolyte system (Fig. S7†), three distinct peaks can be observed at 0.06, 0.32, and 1.22, which evolved into three peaks at 1.22, 0.531, and 0.307 V in the subsequent scans, respectively. Notably, the sharp peaks at 1.22 V can be attributed to the conversion reaction: AlCl3 + 3Na+ + 5e− → Al + 3NaCl. Compared with that of the single microcrystalline graphite (Fig. S6†), the subsequent reduction peak centered at 0.531 V comes from the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and the continued insertion of sodium ions in the GIC anode material.34,37 The last peak at 0.307 V corresponds to the insertion of Na-ions into the gap due to the increase in the interlayer spacing to form Na-intercalation compounds.34 Correspondingly, the anode peaks at 2.606, 2.098 and 0.77 V can be inversely related to the reverse process of the cathode peak. It is worth noting that the cathodic peak (2.098 V) of the initial DEGDME electrolyte system is higher than the corresponding peak in the EC electrolyte system (2.1 V), which may be due to the more serious polarization phenomenon in the EC/DEC electrolyte system, which further shows better reaction reversibility in the DEGDME electrolyte system. For comparison, the redox peaks of the AlCl3-MGIC anode in the DEGDME electrolyte system hold extra peaks of high/low potential (cathodic peaks of 1.9 and 0.556 V and anodic peaks of 0.33, 0.756 and 2.112 V) and lower elevation of redox current strength (cathodic peaks of 0.797 V and anodic peaks of 1.442 V) than those of the AlCl3-MGIC anode in the EC/DEC electrolyte system. This is because the AlCl3-MGIC is doped with solvated sodium ions to form solvated molecules, leading to more conversion reactions in the DEGDME electrolyte system. After the initial cycle, the CV curves almost overlap, indicating that AlCl3-MGIC has good reversibility and structural stability in the DEGDME electrolyte system.
As shown in Fig. 3e, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was performed to characterize the charge transfer kinetics of the sample before cycling. Obviously, the Nyquist plots of all samples are composed of compressed semicircles in the high/medium frequency region and inclined lines in the low frequency region.51 In general, the diameter of the semicircle in the middle/high frequency region represents the migration resistance of lithium ions in the SEI film (Rf) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct), while the inclined line corresponds to the diffusion resistance in the low frequency region, which originates from the electrode continuous diffusion of sodium ions.10,52 Fig. S8† shows the result of the equivalent circuit. In the medium and high frequency region, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the semicircle diameter gradually increases with the increase in the electrode thickness. The sodium-ion diffusion coefficient in the solid state reactor is calculated based on the low frequency data; the formula is as follows: Dk = R2T2/A2n4F4C2σ.53,54 Here, the gas constant R value is 8.314 J mol−1 K−1, T represents the test temperature (298 K) and the electrode area is 1 cm2, n represents the value of the number of transferred electrons, F represents the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), and C means the volume concentration (∼0.8 mmol cm−3). σ is the slope of Z′ to ω1/2 calculated in the impedance spectrum of the low frequency region (Fig. 3f). As shown in the figure, the value of σ in the DEGDME electrolyte is the smallest, 24.5 Ω S−1/2. Through calculation, the diffusion coefficient Dk in DME and TEGDME electrolytes is shown in Fig. S9.† The ion diffusion rate of the DEGDME sample was the fastest and the Dk value was the highest, which was 5.433 × 10−16 cm2 S−1.
In the DEGDME electrolyte, the reaction kinetics of the AlCl3-MGIC anode during the sodium storage process needs to be cleared about the contribution of the Faraday reaction. When the scan rate is in the range from 0.2 to 5 mV s−1, the electrochemical CV curve measures its kinetics. As shown in Fig. 4a, all curves show similar shapes with two obvious reduction peaks and two main oxidation peaks accompanied by an increase in the scanning rate. Under these conditions, the current (i) is presumed to exhibit a relationship (power-law) with the scan rate (v). According to the formula i = avb, a and b are adjustable constants. The value of b describing the kinetics of various reactions in the ion storage process can be determined by the slope of log(i) to log(v). The slope of the fitted line between the logarithmic diagram (i) and the logarithmic diagram (v) is calculated to obtain the value of the redox peak b (Fig. 4b). The b values of the two reduction peaks and one oxidation peak are 0.81, 0.80 and 0.94, respectively. These values between 0.5 and 1 indicate the balanced contribution of the capacitive behavior of surface control and the process of ion diffusion control.55

(c) Normalized contribution ratio of capacitance capacities at different scan rates and (d) typical capacitance and diffusion contribution at 2 mV s−1. (e) Long-term cycle performance at a large current density of 0.5 A g−1. 
In order to further distinguish this combined control behavior, the equation of i (V) = k1v + k2v1/2 can be used to separate the relevant current responses at a steady potential (V). Here, k1 and k2 represent the contribution rate of the diffusion control process and the capacitance process to the total current response.13,52 Taking the anode of DEGDME as an example (Fig. 4c), when the scan rate is 0.2 mV s−1, the capacitance contribution ratio is 35%, and when the scan rate is increased to 5 mV s−1, the capacitance contribution ratio gradually approaches 74%, while the contribution proportion from the diffusion-controlled process dropped from 65% to 26% (Fig. S10†). For example, when the scan rate is 2 mV s−1 (Fig. 4d), the capacitance contribution rate is 66% and the diffusion control process contribution rate is 34%. This result means that at low scan rates (<1 mV s−1), the diffusion contribution dominates, while the capacitive Na storage reaction contributes more at high scan rates (>1 mV s−1). This result is believed to be due to the micro-scale particle size (>20 mm) of internal ion diffusion and the expanded space between adjacent graphite layers for pseudo-capacitance behavior. Therefore, during the Na+-storage process on these AlCl3-MGIC anodes, the capacitive process is responsible for this mixing mechanism. Na+ adsorption and vitality kinetics are greatly enhanced, resulting in the formation of SIB with the highest performance.
In addition, to evaluate the long cycling stability of DEGDME, their charging/discharging tests of 900 cycles were performed at a high current density of 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 4e). The DEGDME anode has excellent reversible sodium storage capacity with an average value of 198 mA h g−1 during 900 cycles, and an ultra-low capacity decay rate of only 0.0066% per cycle. In Fig. S11,† the SEM image of the anode material shows that the surface of the particles is evenly covered with a gel-like SEI film without the formation of obvious sodium dendrites and chlorine precipitates after 900 repeated cycles of sodium ion insertion/extraction. There are undoubtedly three reasons for such good cycling stability and structural integrity: one is the strong chemical bonding strength between AlCl3 and the graphite layer, which effectively inhibits the dissolution of chlorides. Secondly, the enlarged interlayer distance between adjacent graphite layers provides enough space for the insertion and migration of sodium ions. Finally, the effective electrolyte selection controls the strong binding energy of sodium ions and solvent molecules.
The different performances in these electrolyte systems for the AlCl3-MGIC anode are further investigated by DFT calculations. Based on the previous work, the coordination between sodium ions and oxygen in the solvent molecules (PC, DMC, TEGDME) is relatively stable.56 The total energy of optimized sodium ions combined with DME, DEGDME and TEGDME solvents is calculated by DFT calculations. The results are described in Fig. 5a and b. The E [Na-DEGDME]+ (0.64 eV) and E [Na-TEGDME]+ (1.25 eV) are higher than E [Na-DME]+ (0.31 eV), which indicates that the DEGDME and TEGDME solvent molecules offer stronger adsorption energy to sodium-ions.

The Na-solvent co-intercalation behavior into graphite is schematically summarized at Fig. 5c, which concerning to the thermodynamic and chemical stabilities of Na-solvent complexes. The results reveal that [Na-linear-ether]+ complexes have higher Na Es and chemical stability in graphite and can be reversibly embedded in graphite among the candidates under consideration. If the Es is too small, Na-solvent complexes cannot continue to easily desolvate before insertion and/or further insertion because Na alone cannot form GIC. Even if Es is high, the compound in the graphite matrix must be chemically stable to prevent the decomposition of Na+-solvent GIC and ensure reversible intercalation. Otherwise, chemical decomposition, including the exfoliation of the intercalated layer on the graphite, may be caused by gas evolution.
3. Conclusions
In summary, this work has synthesized stable AlCl3-intercalated GICs as anode materials for high-performance sodium-ion storage. AlCl3-MGIC electrodes were systematically studied in DME, DEGDME, TEGDME and EC/DEC electrolytes for the electrochemical storage of sodium. Also, DFT calculations demonstrated that DEGDME solvent molecules offer moderate adsorption energy to sodium-ions and [Na-linear-ether]+ complexes could be reversibly intercalated into graphite. As an anode for SIBs, the AlCl3-MGIC electrode in the DEGDME electrolyte exhibited remarkable sodium storage performance, including high reversible capacity 202 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and prominent cyclability at both low and high rates, in particular, 93.9% capacity retention at 0.5 A g−1 after 900 cycles. Our work defines a type of appropriate graphite host for selecting AlCl3-intercalated GICs as anode materials of SIBs with high reversible capacity and stable cycle performance. More importantly, the rational optimization of electrolytes provides fundamental understanding for the application of GIC materials as a promising SIB anode.
