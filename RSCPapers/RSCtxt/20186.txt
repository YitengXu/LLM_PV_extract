    First published on 11th April 2017AbstractElectrochemically active polymers are widely used in (opto)electronic applications, e.g. organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), solar cells or other light harvesting devices. In this regard, the progress in controlled polymerization techniques opens new possibilities to construct covalently linked polymer architectures, e.g. block copolymers or graft copolymers, from defined building blocks. These architectures represent promising candidates for application in (opto)electronic devices as they allow control of the morphology through self-assembly processes and, furthermore, are capable of mimicking fundamental processes for directional charge transport or light harvesting. This review details synthetic approaches to prepare functional redox-active and conjugated homopolymers as well as the construction of covalently linked well-defined architectures thereof, e.g. block copolymers, graft copolymers or chain end functionalized assemblies.

1. Introduction
Functional redox-active, conjugated or photoactive polymers are valuable materials in the field of (opto)electronics, i.e. they are applied in organic light-emitting diodes, organic field effect transistors or for light harvesting inter alia in organic solar cells. In these devices the polymers fulfill the tasks of charge transport, charge separation, charge accumulation or photosensitization. The activity and performance of the polymers in a device is on the one hand determined by the molecular properties, e.g. redox potentials or light absorptivity, but on the other hand also by physical parameters, e.g. device morphology, morphology stability, trap sites or domain sizes, etc. (vide infra). In this regard, covalently bound polymer based architectures, e.g. block, comb or end functionalized polymers, represent promising candidates to overcome hitherto existing challenges.1–7 Well-defined copolymers, i.e., with tailored molar masses, dispersity and end groups, are capable of self-organization into stable and tunable morphologies.8–10 Moreover, a high end group fidelity is beneficial for the controlled alignment of the macromolecules.11 Additionally, the occurrence of defects and trap sites lowers the performance of the materials.12–14 As a consequence, the application of well-defined architectures is expected to improve the device performance through the formation of ordered self-assembled structures with minimized defect sites. Due to the progress in polymer science, i.e. the development of a number of controlled polymerization techniques, numerous well-defined architectures are readily accessible and are gaining increasing attention in the field of (opto)electronics.15,16
This review focuses on synthetic approaches and strategies enabling the synthesis of well-defined polymer based architectures, i.e. the aforementioned block, comb or end functionalized polymers, which enable control of the morphology through self-assembly processes and which are furthermore capable of mimicking fundamental processes for directional charge transport or light harvesting and allow the construction of multipurpose materials. The main focus is set on developments in the last ten years and covers synthetic procedures as well as strategies, whereas the application in devices consisting of these materials as well as their working principle, e.g. solar cells, is not presented but is partly discussed in other reviews.17–19 The preparation of alternating donor–acceptor polymers, dye-decorated polymers,20 coordination polymers,21 and more-dimensional polymers22,23 are intensively discussed elsewhere. While individual polymerization techniques and single architectures,24,25 which are part of this contribution, were discussed in the respective reviews in the last few years, the here given overview of a wide range of techniques as well as architectures should be in particular helpful for synthetic chemists. The classification of the presented electrochemically active polymers is based on the mechanism of charge transport (Fig. 1).26 Redox-active polymers consist of monomer units with isolated redox centers with pristine redox potentials. Charge transport in these materials occurs by an electron hopping process. As a consequence, the charge carrier mobilities are limited. Nevertheless, redox-active polymers have been widely investigated and benefit from their facile preparation by controlled (radical) polymerization techniques. In contrast, the preparation of telechelic conjugated polymers is much more challenging and requires advanced techniques, e.g. Kumada catalyst transfer polymerization (vide infra). The active units in conjugated polymers strongly influence each other leading to broad oxidation or reduction ranges and much higher charge carrier mobilities compared to redox-active polymers. Commonly applied electrochemically active units comprise, for example, triarylamines, carbazoles, fluorenes, thiophene, naphthalene diimides or fullerenes.
 Fig. 1  Classification of electrochemically active polymers based on the mechanism of charge transport. 
At the beginning of this contribution, the most important controlled polymerization techniques allowing for the synthesis of different classes of electrochemically active polymers are introduced. In particular, the preparation of telechelic polymers, i.e. polymers with defined reactive end groups capable of further functionalization, is of special interest for the later application in complex architectures and represents a central point for the discussion. After this initial introduction of the polymerization techniques, the following sections detail the construction of certain architectures, i.e. block copolymers, graft copolymers or chain end decorated polymers. In this regard, synthetic approaches based on the initially introduced techniques as well as combinations thereof are presented. Compelling and detailed examples demonstrate the resultant possibilities to influence the domain sizes and morphology in devices, whereas enumerated reports illustrate the band width of the synthetic methods.
To avoid misunderstandings of often used and recurring terms in this review, they will be shortly defined and the meaning of symbols will be shortly explained in the following paragraph. The term architecture refers to macromolecules based on covalent bonds which comprise more than one segment, e.g. block or comb copolymers as well as polymers decorated with a terminal functional unit. In this regard a functional unit or a functional building block is a molecule which fulfills a certain task in the final architecture, e.g. light absorption by metal complexes or charge accumulation by fullerene units. In contrast, a functional group or a reactive group is applied in modification reactions and has no particular task in the end product. A telechelic polymer features well-defined functional end groups which originate from initiators or termination reagents.27 For completion, an overview of the symbols that are used in the schemes and figures in the later parts of this review is given in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Symbols used in schemes and figures and their meaning. 
Noteworthily, the available characterization data of the polymers are partly very limited, in particular with respect to yields, initiation efficiencies and necessary purification steps. If no data are given for a tabulated polymer in this review, then to the best of our knowledge it was not reported in the original literature. Depending on the polymer class, the most useful characterization data are given, e.g. initiating and end capping efficiencies for telechelic homopolymers and grafting efficiencies for graft copolymers.
The number average molar masses and dispersities (Mn, Đ) of the polymers in the review are mainly based on SEC investigations with a polystyrene calibration. Due to the application of different instruments and solvents, a comparison of the values is hardly possible and, moreover, in the case of stiff polymers the deviation in the SEC molar mass and the actual molar mass can be rather large. Nevertheless, the data provide an overview of the level of control which is reached with the different polymerization techniques.
2. Synthesis of functional homopolymers
The construction of functional polymer architectures from smaller building blocks, e.g. homopolymers, requires preparation techniques leading to macromolecules with well-defined molar masses as well as a high fidelity of reactive end groups, i.e. controlled and “living” polymerization procedures. In this section various polymerization techniques fulfilling these criteria are shortly presented and essential characteristics will be discussed with respect to electrochemically active polymers as the basis for subsequent applications in extended architectures.
2.1. Redox-active polymers by controlled radical polymerization (CRP) techniques
The established controlled radical polymerization (CRP) techniques, e.g. nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) or reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, are suitable for the preparation of functional homopolymers bearing redox-active units in the side chain. The advantages and limitations regarding commercially available monomers and initiators, functional group tolerance or end functionalization of the individual methods are extensively described in the respective literature references28–32 and will not be discussed here in detail. Instead, relevant examples to prepare functional redox-active homopolymers which are capable of further functionalization reactions as building blocks will be presented in this section. The utilization of the respective polymers in larger systems, e.g. in block copolymers or chain end functionalization with functional units, will be discussed in the later sections (vide infra).
Nitroxide-mediated polymerization is based on a thermally-balanced equilibrium between an active radical and an inactive dormant species (nitroxide)33 (Scheme 1) and is predestinated for the polymerization of styrene and MMA based monomers, e.g. triaryl amine (TARA)34–37 derivatives or perylene diimides (PDIs).35 Due to the commercial availability of (functional) initiators and the easy procedure, a screening of the influence of various substituents on the electrochemical properties and charge carrier mobility can be readily conducted.34,35 Typically reached number average molar masses range from 3000 to 40000 g mol−1 and in general the dispersity increases with the molar mass, i.e. small homopolymers with a dispersity Đ ≈ 1.1034 and large block or homopolymers with Đ ≈ 1.40 to 1.9734–37 were reported. In addition, a large variety of functional initiators can be easily prepared by coupling with (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) or 1,1-dimethylethyl-2-methyl-1-phenylpropyl nitroxide (TIPNO) or a commercially available one can be used to introduce functional units into the polymer.28,31,38 Selected examples of functional initiators are listed in Table 1.

Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is also based on the equilibrium between a dormant and an active species. The activation occurs by a metal catalyst in a one electron transfer process (Scheme 2).45 Major advantages are commercially available cheap initiators (alkyl halides), catalysts (copper complexes) and ligands (pyridine based). In addition, the functionalization of surfaces, e.g. silicon, with redox-active polymers can be readily achieved by the attachment of initiators in a self-assembling monolayer and subsequent polymerization.46 Nevertheless, the polymerization of coordinating monomers, e.g. pyridine or metal complex based monomers, is precluded due to interactions with the metal catalyst and requires the utilization of “protected” monomers which can be transferred in the desired species by polymer analogous reactions. This approach was used by Fang et al. to prepare ruthenium polypyridyl decorated polystyrene by amide coupling.47 Although high conversions were reached (≈90% based on NMR data), it is not possible to construct defect-free materials by this method. In addition, traces of remaining metal catalysts in the final product may limit the applications in (opto)electronics.

The most applied CRP technique is the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization due to the mild reaction conditions, high reaction rates and wide range of suitable monomers.48–50 The controlled character of the polymerization relies on fast reversible chain transfer steps involving chain transfer agents, e.g. dithioesters, thiocarbamates and xanthates, so that the propagation rate of all chains is equal. Partly these RAFT agents are commercially available. A simplified mechanism is depicted in Scheme 3 and illustrates primary initiation, propagation and pre equilibration steps as well as the dominating main equilibrium step.
 Scheme 3  Simplified mechanism of RAFT polymerization including fast and reversible chain transfer as a source of the controlled reaction process. I is initiator; the Z group, e.g. Ph, influences the stability of the CS bond. 
The diversity of polymerizable monomers is illustrated by the feasibility to directly incorporate metal complexes or dyes into polymers.51–53 Furthermore, the well-defined end groups of RAFT polymers can be utilized by further functionalization reactions. A prominent example is the cleavage of dithioesters to generate a polymer decorated with a thiol group at the ω-end. The conversion of the modification can be quantified by UV/vis analysis (disappearance of the CS band at 310 nm) or 1H NMR spectroscopy.54 Subsequently the thiol can be applied in a thiol–ene click reaction49 or can be directly used for the attachment to gold surfaces.54 The modification of the α-chain terminus is also possible by application of reactive RAFT agents, i.e. reactive esters with pentafluorophenyl groups can be readily modified with amines. In this way, the group of Zentel introduced photocleavable anchor groups into TARA polymers to stabilize nanoparticles55 and further prepared disulfide bearing carbazole based polymers to result in hybrid materials with quantum dots.56 The RAFT agent enabled the preparation of polymers with dispersities in the range of 1.1 to 1.2 and molar masses from 5000 to 12000 g mol−1. The quantitative substitution of the pentafluorophenyl group was verified by 19F NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, surface-initiated approaches enable the construction of electroactive films.57 RAFT polymerization (as well as the NMP process) is also the method of choice for the preparation of methacrylate based liquid crystalline polymers with discotic side groups for hierarchical self-assembled materials.58,59
For completeness, also other CRP techniques, e.g. iniferter polymerization,60 can be suitable to prepare functional redox-active polymers but are much less frequently utilized.
2.2. Redox-active and conjugated polymers by anionic polymerization techniques
Anionic polymerization enables a truly living reaction process in case of absent termination reactions. In addition the chain end functionalization is readily achieved by the addition of end capping agents to quench the reactive species, e.g. by the addition of ethylene oxide.61,62 The method requires a very high purity of the used chemicals and solvents to avoid termination reactions; as a consequence, it is less frequently used in comparison to CRP to prepare polymers for optoelectronics. However, a few interesting synthetic examples including chain end functionalization with fullerenes63 are reported for triarylamine derivatives leading to polymers with number average molar masses from 2000 to 20000 g mol−1 and dispersities from 1.05 to 1.2 according to SEC investigations.63,64 Moreover, Higashihara and Mitsuru described the precise synthesis of block copolymers utilizing bifunctional initiators or functional coupling reagents, i.e. modified poly(3-hexylthiophene).65 The preparation of block copolymers by sequential monomer addition of styrene or MMA as a second block gave very high conversions (>99%), low Đ values (1.04–1.07) and high molar masses (25000–39000 g mol−1) without further purification. In contrast, end capping with modified bifunctional poly(3-hexylthiophene) required the removal of residual homopolymer by Soxhlet extraction to yield a product with high molar mass (26000 g mol−1) and low dispersity (Đ = 1.15).
Conjugated polymers can also be prepared by anionic polymerization and subsequent elimination reactions. In this way Natori et al. synthesized a conjugated polymer consisting of p-phenylene, p-phenylenevinylene and styrylamine structures by copolymerization of cyclohexadiene and a styrenic triarylamine (Scheme 4).66 Whereas the polymerization yield ranged from 76% to 98% depending on the ratio of the monomers, the final dehydrogenation was apparently quantitative (based on 1H NMR data) and yielded the conjugated polymers. Interestingly, this approach avoids the partly complicated introduction of functional groups necessary for the preparation of the respective polymers by cross coupling reactions.
 Scheme 4  Anionic polymerization and subsequent dehydrogenation leading to semiconducting polymers with p-phenylene, p-phenylenevinylene and styrylamine substructures (adapted from ref. 66). 
Moreover, the group of Vanderzande reported the preparation of PPV polymers by the so-called sulfinyl precursor route (Scheme 5).67 In this approach a p-quinodimethane derivative is used as a monomer and the obtained non-conjugated polymer is transformed into PPV by thermal elimination (Scheme 5). The reaction is very fast and an almost quantitative conversion of the monomer is reached within seconds. Although the reported dispersities are high for a controlled process (Đ > 1.7), the molar mass can be controlled by the amount of added initiator and varied from 4000 to 20000 g mol−1. Noteworthily, this technique yields polymers with high end group fidelity and functional groups may be introduced with the initiator.67

2.3. Redox-active and conjugated polymers by ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) approaches
The ring opening metathesis polymerization of cyclic alkenes (Scheme 6) offers high functional group tolerance and, therefore, enables the application of sensitive monomers, e.g. fullerene or radical containing compounds (Fig. 3).68–75 The reaction is most commonly catalyzed by Grubbs catalysts, i.e. ruthenium complexes, and enables end functionalization as well as the preparation of block copolymers. In general, high conversions are reached in less than one hour due to the high reaction rate and dispersities smaller than 1.10 could be observed.72,74,75 Depending on the kind of monomer, either conjugated or redox-active polymers may be synthesized.

 Fig. 3  Schematic representation of norbornene based monomers containing redox- or photoactive monomer units commonly used for the preparation of homopolymers. 
Due to their established preparation methods and easy functionalization, norbornene derivatives (Scheme 6) are of special interest for the preparation of redox-active polymers. In particular, they exclusively allow direct polymerization of fullerene derivatives. The conformational freedom of the fullerene in the side chain is adjusted by the utilized linker between the backbone and fullerene, and examples applying long flexible linkers as well as rigid monomers can be found.68–71 Typically, molar masses between 6500 and 17000 g mol−1 were reached. Due to intensive optimization of the polymerization conditions by Kim et al.,70 the dispersity of a dendritic polymer was improved (Đ = 1.08) and the fullerene density was significantly increased in comparison to other fullerene containing polymers, which feature a much broader molar mass distribution (Đ > 1.8).71,73
As mentioned in the beginning of this section, ROMP is also a powerful technique to synthesize telechelic conjugated polymers, i.e. PPVs.76 Suitable monomers leading to PPV derivatives include [2.2]paracyclophanes,77–83 [2.2.2]paracyclophanes84,85 or derived compounds86 (Scheme 7). The synthesis of [2.2]paracyclophanes succeeds through a multi-step reaction involving a nucleophilic ring closing reaction of benzylic dithiols and benzylic dibromides as the first step. The obtained [3.3]dithiacyclophanes are transferred into the monomers by either Stevens or Pummerer rearrangement and subsequent reactions.78,87 In contrast, [2.2.2]paracyclophanes can be prepared from a phenylene–ethynylene backbone by a ring-closing intramolecular McMurry reaction as the last step.84 The kind of monomer dictates the substitution pattern of the later (co)polymer which is depicted in Fig. 4. Noteworthily, the polymers are obtained as a cis/trans mixture after the reaction but isomerization to the all trans isomer is achieved by exposure to UV light in solution. The ROMP process follows the characteristics of a living polymerization so that the preparation of block copolymers88,89 (vide infra) or an end functionalization77,83,90 is readily possible. Typically, molar masses between 5000 and 60000 g mol−1 and dispersities Đ ≈ 1.2–1.4 are reached for [2.2]paracyclophanes combined with high monomer conversion (>90%). In contrast, [2.2.2]paracyclophanes and related thiophene derivatives yield polymers with higher dispersities (Đ = 1.4 to 1.9) and the monomer conversion is lower.84–86 End functionalization or termination reagents are commonly based on substituted alkenes, e.g. functional vinyl ether derivatives. Remarkable functionalization examples include supramolecular recognition units, which were prepared by Elacqua and Weck to fabricate supramolecular polymers,77 or α-bromo esters as macroinitiators for ATRP as prepared by Lidster et al.83,90 The end functionalization efficiency was calculated to be above 90%.

 Fig. 4  Reported substitution pattern of PPVs depending on the monomer used to influence the properties of the polymers. 
Besides PPVs, also polyacetylenes can be prepared by ROMP utilizing cyclooctatetraene as the monomer. In this regard the group of Choi demonstrated the potential of the in situ formation of nanoparticles consisting of polyacetylene copolymers. Polyacetylene is almost insoluble in all common solvents and directly leads to self-assembly of the copolymer during the synthesis due to the collapsing of the PA segment.91,92 Moreover, poly(o-phenylene ethynylene)s are also accessible by the ROMP of strained cyclic alkynes.93 Interestingly, the structure of the respective macromolecules, i.e. cyclic or linear, was shown to be dependent on the catalyst used.93
For the sake of completeness it should be mentioned that also acyclic diene metathesis polymerization can yield redox-active polymers as shown by Song et al.94
2.4. Conjugated polymers by catalyst transfer polycondensation (CTP) techniques
The classical approaches to prepare a multitude of conjugated polymers are step-growth based polymerization procedures leading to polymers with a broad molar mass distribution and low end group fidelity. In the beginning of the 2000s the development of the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) and/or Kumada catalyst transfer polymerization (KCTP) of thiophenes by McCullough and Yokozawa represented a significant advancement due to its living character and the associated novel synthetic possibilities, i.e. the preparation of (co)polymers with defined functional end groups and a narrow molar mass distribution.39,95–102 A detailed overview of the mechanism of this chain growth polymerization process and the scope of monomers, which nowadays cover more than thiophenes, is found in recent reviews detailing the Kumada catalyst transfer polymerization.103–108 In the following only a short introduction with a focus on the end functionalization possibilities will be provided.
Telechelic polymers may either be prepared by the application of functional initiators,100,102,109–115in situ end capping reagents97,99,109,116–118 or a post polymerization approach.101,119,120 An overview of various functional initiators and introduced end groups is given in Tables 2 and 3. The efficiency of the initiation or end functionalization, i.e. the amount of the desired end groups in the product, is also given in the tables. Noteworthily, the end functionalization using Grignard reagents with triple or double bonds partly leads to difunctionalized polymers (Table 3). In addition, the living character also facilitates the polymer linkage to surfaces or nanoparticles by grafting from a surface with incorporated starting units121 or attachment of the polymers via functional end groups.101,119

Besides magnesium, zinc is also a suitable metal for the activation of the monomers and subsequent polymerization, in particular for thiophene or related perylene and naphthalene diimide derivatives.122–124,125 In line with the classical KCTP approach various (functionalized) nickel102,126,127 or palladium catalysts128–130 represent suitable initiators. Palladium catalysts are in general more stable but increase the tendency for a break of the catalyst/polymer π complex especially with monomers different from thiophene.130 Nevertheless a remarkable protocol, which did not rely on the π complexation of the metal catalyst for polymerization control, was developed by Verswyvel et al.129 The reported catalyst system using Pd/Ruphos and monomers which are deactivated for oxidative addition resulted in a controlled polymerization process.129
The activation with zinc further enables the application of monomers with alkyl halide moieties without any side reactions, so that these functionalities are available for subsequent post polymerization reactions (see Section “Graft and comb polymers”).131
A major challenge of the GRIM approach utilizing zinc or magnesium is the required base stability of the monomer and the necessity of an almost quantitative metal/halogen exchange to preclude side and termination reactions. In order to expand the field of accessible polymers the catalyst transfer approach was transferred to various metal catalyzed cross coupling polymerization procedures in the past few years.103 Today, Suzuki, Heck or Sonogashira cross coupling polymerizations can also be carried out under mild conditions in a nearly ideal chain growth mechanism. As an advantage of these CTP techniques in contrast to Kumada CTP, the required substituted AB monomers are prepared separately, i.e. they can be purified, isolated and stored. The investigated suitable monomers for Suzuki CTP include fluorene,132para-phenylene,133 or thiophenes.134,135 Noteworthily, also the polymerization of para-phenylenevinylene,136 phenanthrene137 or pyridine138 was studied but an ideal chain growth mechanism was not found as an intermolecular catalyst transfer or side reactions, e.g. disproportionation or dehalogenation, occurred. End functionalization of the respective polymers can be realized using functional Pd catalysts132,133,135–146 (Tables 4 and 5) or functional end capping reagents, i.e. substituted boronic acids or esters (Table 6).140,141,144,145 Deviations from the ideal chain growth mechanism decrease the initiation efficiency of the externally prepared functional initiators, e.g. in the case of para-phenylenevinylene instead of thiophene as the monomer (Table 4, entry 2) or at very high conversions (typically conversions ≈ 50% were aimed for).136,140 In contrast to the usual reported synthetic routine applying the externally prepared initiators (Table 4), Zhang et al. synthesized a broad range of polymers utilizing functional catalysts which were in situ generated from a catalyst precursor and an aryl halide and result in a high fidelity of the desired end group (Table 5).142–144,146 The application of end capping reagents is also an appropriate way to introduce functional end groups in good yields (Table 6). The ability to prepare bi-telechelic polymers is impressively documented by Elmalem et al., who synthesized a library of heterobisfunctionalized polyfluorenes.140

The transfer of the CTP approach to the Sonogashira cross coupling route gives access to poly(p-phenyleneethynylene)s which are interesting materials due to their rigid structure.147 The respective synthesis including kinetic studies to reveal the ideal chain growth mechanism was documented by Kang et al.147 Similar to the Suzuki polymerization, end functionalization or attachment on surfaces is also feasible by functionalized initiators.147 Recently, efforts were undertaken to perform Heck coupling in a catalyst transfer fashion to prepare PPVs in a straight-forward approach.148
Noteworthily, the atom economy of the described synthetic routes is unsatisfactory for preparation on large scales, e.g. the mass loss during the polymerization of 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene is 49%. Therefore strategies using direct arylation are currently being extensively studied.14,149–157 A comprehensive review of direct (hetero)arylation polymerization covering current developments as well as challenges and limitations was recently published by the group of Leclerc.158
3. Block copolymers
Block copolymers allow the linear combination of two or more different monomer units in distinct sections of a macromolecule to create new materials with tailored properties, e.g. electron and hole transporting as well as hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks can be incorporated into one polymer chain. Thus the electrochemical as well as the physical properties can be precisely tuned, e.g. to control the morphology and self-assembly properties of the materials.24,159,160 In the context of organic solar cells, especially, improved stability of the device morphology and reduced sintering161 is expected from the application of block copolymers. Based on their behavior in solution, polymers are differentiated either as coil or as rod polymers. Whereas coil polymers are characterized by a flexible backbone, rod polymers are rigid as a result of a restricted conformational freedom. Due to the different structures of these polymers, the combination of the two types in a block copolymer represents a promising and often used approach to control the microphase separation (vide infra).
In general four methods for the synthesis of block copolymers can be distinguished, which are depicted in Scheme 8.160,162 In the case of a living polymerization, e.g. anionic polymerization or ROMP, block copolymers are prepared by sequential monomer addition, i.e. the polymerization is started with one monomer and after full consumption a second monomer is added and so on. Consequently the polymerization is carried out in a facile one pot procedure and isolation and purification of the primarily formed homopolymer is not possible but also generally not necessary. Very precise control of the final structure is achieved. A successful synthesis, however, requires an efficient crossover reaction, the addition of the monomers in the right order of reactivity and possibly tuning of the reactivity of the propagating chain by additives.162,163 The synthesis of block copolymers by CRP or similar techniques cannot be accomplished by sequential monomer addition due to the emergence of termination reactions at high monomer conversions. As a consequence, the second strategy leading to block copolymers is based on the use of macroinitiators or macro-RAFT agents. In the first step, a homopolymer still bearing the initiating group (or RAFT group) is synthesized. After purification, i.e. the removal of unreacted monomers, the compound may be used to initiate the polymerization of the second monomer. In contrast to the sequential monomer addition, this technique enables a modular approach as the macroinitiator can be utilized for varying block copolymers. In a similar way bifunctional initiators capable of initiating two or more different polymerization processes may be applied to construct macroinitiators and, subsequently, block copolymers. This coupling of polymerization strategies is of special interest as a wide scope of monomers and in principle all possible polymerization techniques may be combined. The last common approach leading to block copolymers is the coupling of telechelic polymer chains. The required end groups are introduced by functional initiators, end cappers or postpolymerization reactions (see Section “Synthesis of functional homopolymers”). In order to achieve high conversion during coupling, very efficient reactions, e.g. the copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction, are required. In the case of incomplete conversion, separation of the block and homopolymers may be challenging. Nevertheless the coupling of polymer chains is beneficial with respect to a modular synthetic approach.
 Scheme 8  Main synthetic approaches leading to block copolymers. 
3.1. Block copolymers by CRP and anionic polymerization
Controlled radical polymerization techniques are well suited for the synthesis of block copolymers due to the high fidelity of the reactive end groups (see Section “Synthesis of functional homopolymers”). For this purpose, at first a homopolymer is synthesized and is then utilized as a macroinitiator (NMP and ATRP) or as a macro-RAFT agent (RAFT polymerization) to prepare the block copolymer. Ideally the so obtained block copolymer can also be further used for the synthesis of triblock terpolymers and so on.
In the simplest case, one block of the copolymer is electrochemically active, e.g. poly(N-vinyl carbazole) or poly(vinyl-m-triphenylamine), and the second one is only used to control the self-assembly properties of the material, e.g. poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) or PMMA.164,165 An interesting example for the preparation of block copolymers in which the second block fulfills an additional task is reported by the group of Zentel. The authors prepared copolymers which contained triarylamine derivatives in the first and pentafluorophenyl acrylate in the second block (Scheme 9).166–169 The activated ester of the second block is readily substituted so that anchor groups for the attachment of the polymer on quantum dots,168 nanorods166 or tetrapods167 can be introduced (Fig. 5). Moreover, the approach is applicable for decoration with photosensitizers or dye molecules, which can be used for the construction of donor–photosensitizer–acceptor (D–P–A) nanocomposites (Fig. 5).166,169 Whereas bulky units are not quantitatively linked to the polymer backbone due to steric hindrance, small molecules result in a quantitative conversion as judged from 19F NMR spectroscopy. For example, Zorn et al. achieved 30% conversion of the ester with a perylene diimide and full conversion with dopamine.166

 Fig. 5  Schematic representation of reported substitution reactions of pentafluorophenyl acrylate used to introduce metal complexes, anchor groups or dyes into the respective block copolymers.166–169 
In a similar approach, Brendel et al. exploited the possibility to selectively modify one block of a copolymer to construct amphiphilic block copolymers consisting of a triarylamine and a hydrophilic polystyrene sulfonate block.170 Interestingly, a small part of the macro-RAFT agent was inactive, so that a separation of the desired block copolymer and the residual macro RAFT agent by preparative SEC was necessary and resulted in a narrow molar mass distribution with Đ = 1.08 (before purification Đ ≈ 1.3). This material gave micelles in aqueous solution which were decorated with nanorods leading to nanocomposites.170 Due to the application of water as a solvent, this approach displays a promising “green” alternative for the construction of hybrid solar cells with controlled domain sizes.170
Besides these examples comprising copolymers with one block, which is not electrochemically active, also block copolymers with two active blocks are reported in the literature. For instance, the incorporation of monomers with varying redox potentials yields block copolymers with an internal redox gradient for directed charge transport.34,171 In this regard, Schroot et al. reported the preparation of triarylamine block copolymers with number average molar masses between 25000 and 39000 g mol−1 and low dispersities (Đ = 1.20 to 1.42) using standard NMP conditions.34 In contrast RAFT polymerization to yield block copolymers of triarylamine derivatives required an intensive optimization to achieve a significant increase in the molar mass and low dispersities (Đ < 1.60).171 Moreover, donor–acceptor block copolymers are readily prepared by CRP, e.g. NMP.172,173 The combination of amorphous triphenylamine and perylene bisimide, which is capable of π–π stacking due to a flexible linker, produced nanostructured materials leading to higher yields of long-lived free charges in comparison to blends of the homopolymers.172,173
The anionic polymerization is predestinated for the synthesis of block copolymers by sequential monomer addition. Due to the absence of termination reactions in the ideal case, it is possible to achieve the full consumption of a monomer and afterwards add a second monomer to obtain a second block.174,175 In this regard, a comprehensive example is given by Kang et al. by the synthesis of triphenylamine and ethynylpyridine containing copolymers.176,177 In their work the influence of the cation on polymerization is described and strategies to tune the reactivity of the active species are presented. After optimization of the reaction conditions, block copolymers with narrow molar mass distributions (Đ = 1.10 to 1.15) and molar masses between 8000 and 20000 g mol−1 were observed under full conversion. Noteworthily, the application of potassium naphthalenide also allowed for the synthesis of BAB triblock copolymers (Scheme 10).176,178
 Scheme 10  Schematic representation of anionic polymerization using potassium naphthalenide as an initiator leading to BAB triblock copolymers.176,178 
The preparation of PPV and PA containing block copolymers by sequential monomer addition utilizing the sulfinyl precursor route is reported by Cosemans et al.179 However, besides block copolymer formation, the authors also observed a homopolymer at the end of the reaction which made a purification step by preparative SEC necessary.179 In addition, so far no other second block could be introduced, e.g. styrene did not lead to a polymer.
3.2. Block copolymers by ROMP
Ring-opening metathesis polymerization, similar to anionic polymerization, is a living process and therefore well suited for the preparation of block copolymers by sequential monomer addition. In particular the wide scope of cyclic monomers enables a multiplicity of different structures and will be presented in the following section.
A facile approach to prepare block copolymers by ROMP is the use of substituted norbornenes180,181 or related compounds, e.g. tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca-3,7-diene derivatives,182 with varying substituents. For instance, Gu et al. synthesized polyelectrolytic copolymers containing blocks with different metallocene derivatives with low dispersities (Đ = 1.07) with quantitative conversion of each monomer.180,181,183
In a similar approach, the incorporation of porphyrin and fullerene moieties was achieved by Charvet et al. (Fig. 6).182 The obtained photoconductive films featured nanowire-like self-assembly with well segregated domains which were tailorable by the size of the block copolymer.
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca-3,7-diene based monomers for the preparation of donor–acceptor block copolymers by sequential monomer addition.182 
The synthesis of PPV block copolymers with various substitution and linking patterns is reported by Yu et al.88,89 The sequential monomer addition of strained cyclophanedienes allowed the incorporation of 1,4-phenylenevinylene and 1,3-phenylenevinylene repeating units. Due to the different structures of the blocks, phase separation was observed and, moreover, energy transfer between the blocks could also be observed by photoluminescence measurements.89 The variation of the cyclophane building block, i.e. by introduction of cyclopentadithiophene-vinylene or dithienobenzothiadiazole-vinylene moieties as underlying units, was used to construct donor–acceptor block copolymers as shown by Chang and Masaki (Scheme 11).184 The observed dispersities (Đ = 1.51 to 1.85) are higher than for PPVs by the ROMP of cyclophanedienes (Đ = 1.2 to 1.5).184 However, by the variation of the monomer units, various backbone structures can potentially be realized in order to tune the HOMO–LUMO levels or the UV/vis absorptivity.
 Scheme 11  Schematic representation of donor–acceptor block copolymer synthesis using ROMP and the sequential monomer addition technique.184 
The so far presented examples utilized monomers, which were, respectively, based on the same chemical structure to construct block copolymers. However, it is also possible to synthesize block copolymers by ROMP consisting of structurally different monomer units. In this regard the group of Choi reported the synthesis of polynorbornene-b-polyacetylene by sequential monomer addition and the in situ nanoparticlization of the conjugated polymer leading to the formation of nanocaterpillars.92 Based on the large reactivity differences of the monomers, the authors additionally developed a one-step preparation method leading to block-like copolymers.91 A further compelling example is given by Menk et al. by the synthesis of block copolymers containing PPVs and polynorbornenes.185 At first, the polymerization of norbornene derivatives was initiated with a Grubbs catalyst and after consumption of the first monomer, a substituted paracyclophanediene was added to form the second block of the polymer with narrow molar mass distribution (Đ = 1.29, 17000 g mol−1). This example is of special interest as various substituents, e.g. PEG chains or reactive esters, were introduced in the non-conjugated block and enabled self-assembly into micelles as well as postpolymerization modification to introduce anchor groups for attachment to quantum dots.185 Therefore the combination of various strategies to design macromolecular hierarchical architectures is appealingly demonstrated.
3.3. Block copolymers by CTP
Various “classical approaches”, i.e. step growth polymerization techniques, can be utilized to prepare block copolymers. For example, the synthesis of PPV derivatives by Horner–Emmons coupling leading to multiblock copolymers186 and the Hartwig–Buchwald coupling to prepare donor–acceptor triblock copolymers187,188 should be mentioned in this context. However, the control over the molar mass distribution and the degree of polymerization is limited by these techniques.
In contrast, the Kumada catalyst transfer polymerization and related CTP protocols allow the preparation of well-defined block copolymers by sequential monomer addition.189–222 An overview of various synthesized polymers, molar masses and dispersities is provided in Table 7. Noteworthily, the conversion of the individual monomers is in general higher than 90% but the yields of the final polymer (when given in the report) are normally lower due to losses upon purification, e.g. by extraction. Moreover, initiation with an externally prepared initiator (vide supra) should be preferred to preclude B–A–B triblock formation which can occur in particular in small blocks or in the case of a second monomer with a less electron-rich character (weaker complexing ability of the Ni catalyst).205 However, this issue is rarely investigated or commented on in publications. Block copolymers consisting of different substituted thiophene units were reported and can be used to achieve self-assembly into nanowires (entry 1),189 to introduce functionalized side chains (entry 4)198 or to tune the energy levels in a donor–donor block copolymer for application in solar cells (entry 2).195 Furthermore, functional side chains are attractive to attach additional functional units (covalent or supramolecular), e.g. fullerene derivatives (entries 5, 8 and 9).201,211,213 Besides thiophene, also derived monomers, e.g. selenothiophene, were applied in block copolymers. In this regard, Palermo and McNeil investigated the influence of the copolymer structure, i.e. random, block or gradient, on polythiophene-b-polyselenophene (entry 13).221 In a similar approach the group of Seferos obtained thermostable fiber-like nanostructures for solar cell applications from polythiophene-b-polyselenophene block copolymers.220 Other blocks which were combined with polythiophene leading to donor–donor polymers are poly(p-phenylene) (entry 14)192 or polyfluorene (entry 16).199 Interestingly, Verswyvel et al. prepared triblock terpolymers in all possible orders from fluorene, thiophene and selenophene monomers which were activated with zinc using a palladium catalyst (entry 16).199 Surprisingly, the authors observed an unusual independence of the monomer sequence in contrast to common sequential monomer addition protocols (vide supra). Nevertheless, the removal of residual homopolymer by extraction was hindered in these examples.

Along with donor–donor, also donor–acceptor block copolymers were prepared by KCT polymerization or related procedures. A first example was presented by Seferos' group (entry 22).214 The block copolymer was synthesized utilizing thiophene and benzotriazole as monomers and a Ni(II) diimine complex as a catalyst. The controlled polymerization of electron-rich as well as electron-deficient compounds is attributed to strong association of the catalyst.214 In a similar approach, Todd et al. synthesized P3HT-b-PFBTzHT(=poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(5,6-difluorobenzotriazole-alt-4-hexylthiophene) by sequential monomer addition.212 A further example discussing donor–acceptor copolymers is reported by Tkachov et al. (entry 26).222 Due to the much faster polymerization of a fluorenic monomer than a bis(thiopenyl)naphthalene diimide derivative, the authors were able to obtain block-like copolymers in a one pot procedure under simultaneous addition of the two monomers.222 The dibrominated monomers were activated with zinc or zinc compounds and palladium was used as a metal catalyst.222 Although the reported polymerization did not yield a well-defined block copolymer (broad dispersity), the approach represents an important step towards a facile and rapid protocol for the preparation of conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers.222
Besides the sequential monomer addition method, block copolymers may also be synthesized from separately prepared homopolymers and a final Kumada coupling step. Following this approach Ananthakrishnan et al. reported the synthesis of poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-oligo(anthracene-9,10-diyl).223
Modern synthesis protocols further enable the sequential block copolymerization of monomers by mechanistically distinct procedures in a living fashion.224–227 Remarkable examples include donor–acceptor copolymers consisting of P3HT224,225,228,229 and PPE226 in one block and isocyanide (Scheme 12A–C)224,226,227,229 or allene (Scheme 12D)225,228 derivatives as well as a range of vinyl monomers225 in the other block. The catalytic systems are based on nickel224,225,228,229 or palladium226 and establish novel facile pathways to interesting polymer classes. The obtained polymers featured a narrow molar mass distribution (1.1 to 1.4), controllable molar masses between 4000 to 31000 g mol−1 and yields up to 60–90%.
 Scheme 12  Schematic representation of monomers and respective block copolymers prepared with one initiator system but following mechanistically distinct procedures.224–229 
3.4. Block copolymers by coupling of polymerization techniques
The coupling of different polymerization techniques represents a very valuable tool to synthesize block copolymers of intensively studied electrochemically active monomer units which are not compatible with just one polymerization process. As stated in the beginning of this section, mainly two strategies are applied to couple polymerization techniques. Either a bi- or multifunctional initiator is used and the block copolymer is step-wise synthesized or two independently prepared telechelic polymer chains are coupled together by an efficient linking reaction, most commonly the CuAAC “Click” reaction. Noteworthily, the reviewed work in the following section concentrates on block copolymers in which predominantly at least one block consists of a conjugated polymer.

3.4.1 Coupling of conjugated polymers with CRP. 
The covalent connection of conjugated polymers with non-conjugated polymers, which were prepared by CRP, is either achieved by the coupling of telechelic blocks or, more commonly, by the utilization of macroinitiators and macro-RAFT agents. An overview of the respective reported linking reactions and initiators is given in Scheme 13 and Table 8. In the case of coupling of well-defined telechelic homopolymers, the molar mass and the dispersity can be tuned by the used individual blocks.230,231 Reported yields are in the range of 50 to 80% and the removal of residual homopolymers is often achieved by extraction to exploit solubility differences or by preparative SEC.

P3HT is the most often used conjugated polymer which is combined with hydrophilic,232,233,238,239 thermoresponsive232 or manipulable liquid crystalline240,241 monomers as well as units capable of metal coordination238,239,242 to prepare block copolymers. In this regard, Kumari et al. synthesized P3HT-b-PNIPAM by the CuAAC reaction in good yields (60 to 75%) and formed thermoresponsive micelles which revealed LCST behavior in water.232 A further example is introduced by the group of Zhao by utilizing KCTP and ATRP to design block copolymers in which the surface- and photoinduced orientation of azobenzene mesogens was applied in order to tune the self-assembly behavior.240 The incorporation of P4VP in block copolymers containing P3HT is also suitable to induce microphase separation.238 Moreover, acetylene terminated P3HT was coupled with bifunctional PMA by the CuAAC reaction leading to thermoplastic elastomers which may be useful for the production of stretchable electronics.235 Besides these examples utilizing telechelic homopolymers for the coupling to block copolymers, also the application of P3HT based macroinitiators for NMP or macro-RAFT agents for RAFT polymerization has been reported and was utilized for the fabrication of nanofibrils consisting of P3HT-b-PS or P3HT-b-PIP block copolymers.243
A large number of donor–acceptor copolymers consist of a conjugated electron-rich polymer, e.g. P3HT, and non-conjugated acceptors, e.g. fullerenes40,43,234 or liquid crystalline perylene bisimide244–249 units. In this regard, a common synthetic approach is the coupling of P3HT with a NMP initiator either by in situ end capping43,244,245,247,248 or postpolymerization modification44,246,249 leading to a macroinitiator. Naturally, the transformation of the polymer into the macroinitiator is not necessarily quantitative and the denoted yields range from approximately 80%244 to quantitative conversions.44,238 Nevertheless, an incomplete functionalization is not problematic as a purification step is necessary anyway after the synthesis of the second block. The systems involving P3HT and perylene bisimide revealed a tunable microphase separation and self-assembly behavior as acrylate based perylene bisimide monomers with a long and flexible side chain are liquid crystalline.244–249
As fullerenes are sensitive towards radicals, direct incorporation with appropriate substituted monomers is not possible, so a monomer with a reactive functional group is primarily incorporated into the block copolymers and the fullerene is attached in a postpolymerization modification reaction (vide infra).40,43,234 In analogy, Yao et al. applied the ATRP procedure for the coupling of P3HT with polymers containing reactive side groups. Subsequently side chain decoration with a perylene bisimide was achieved.236
Furthermore, the preparation of poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(vinylphenyl oxadiazole) by a combination of Kumada CTP and ATRP was reported.250
The coupling of other conjugated polymers besides P3HT with a second block prepared by CRP is much less studied and only very few literature examples are described.252 However, an outstanding example is presented by the group of Zentel.252 The authors synthesized PPV by Siegrist polycondensation and used a comprehensive postpolymerization approach to transform the polymer into a macro-RAFT agent, which was used to polymerize pentafluorophenyl acrylate. This active ester was subsequently substituted with dopamine as an anchor group for the decoration of TiO2 nanoparticles to form hybrid materials.252 The Suzuki coupling of bi-endfunctional polyfluorene with fullerene-substituted PS derivatives leading to ABA triblock copolymers is described by Bicciocchi et al.237
PPVs which were prepared by ROMP can also be decorated with reactive end groups serving as initiators for CRP. For instance, Lidster et al. applied this approach to prepare monotelechelic PPVs by ROMP and the corresponding block copolymers with PMMA by ATRP using a PPV macroinitiator.90


3.4.2 Coupling reactions involving anionic polymerization techniques. 
Basically, two routes were applied to combine anionic polymerization with other polymerization techniques leading to electrochemically active polymers. Either the reactivity of the propagating anion is in situ exploited by end capping with a reactive reagent253–255 (Scheme 14) or telechelic end functionalized polymers, e.g. PEG-OH derivatives, are applied in a postpolymerization approach to be linked to a second block256–262 or are utilized as a macroinitiator.263–265 In particular, the preparation of PPV by anionic polymerization using the so-called sulfinyl precursor approach is of high interest from a synthetic point of view.263 Cosemans et al. presented the preparation of block copolymers using a bifunctional initiator suitable for SET-LRP (single electron transfer living radical polymerization) and anionic polymerization. This approach yielded defined block copolymers in contrast to their previous work applying the sequential monomer addition technique.179 The obtained PPV precursor polymer was readily transformed into PPV by elimination at elevated temperatures.263

An elegant in situ endcapping approach is presented by Sary et al.253,254 The authors prepared P4VP by anionic polymerization and utilized aldehyde terminated PPV254 or P3HT253 as end capping agents leading to block copolymers capable of self-assembly processes (Scheme 14A and B). Moreover, the P4VP block experiences weak supramolecular interactions with PCBM and assists the separation of donor and acceptor units.253 Furthermore, alkyl halides represent valuable end capping reagents. In this regard the preparation of AB and ABA rod-coil block copolymers consisting of alkyl halide terminated P3HT and phenylethynyl styrene derivatives is reported (Scheme 14C).266 Noteworthily, also 1,1-diphenylethylene derivatives can be used as end capping reagents (Scheme 14D).
A very stimulating example for the combination of KCTP and anionic polymerization is provided by the group of Coulembier.267 The authors individually prepared alkyne terminated P3HT by KCTP polymerization and azide terminated polyphthalaldehyde by anionic polymerization and covalently linked the units by the CuAAC reaction. These block copolymers were isolated in good yields (>80%), featured low dispersities (Đ = 1.26 to 1.34) and molar masses between 9000 and 17000 g mol−1, and could be assembled into fibrillary nanostructures and upon thermal treatment the thermo-sacrificial polyphthalaldehyde block could be removed leading to nanoporous P3HT (Scheme 15).267
 Scheme 15  Preparation of nanoporous films by utilization of thermo-sacrificial segments.267 


3.4.3 Combination of metal catalyzed cross coupling polymerization techniques. 
Fully conjugated block copolymers are commonly prepared either by sequential monomer addition techniques (vide supra), by the coupling of telechelic blocks with complementary end groups or by the application of macroinitiators. In particular, the last two approaches broaden the scope of accessible polymers in comparison to sequential monomer addition techniques. Noteworthily, P3HT is most commonly used as one of the building blocks due to its established synthetic procedures and beneficial properties.
The functional groups, which are necessary to covalently link the individual blocks, can be introduced by functional initiators. In this regard, Smeets et al. synthesized polythiophene block copolymers using KCTP and functionalized Ni(II) catalysts enabling the introduction of azide or acetylene end groups for a connection utilizing the CuAAC reaction.102 In addition, also the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling polymerization applying functional initiators is established and was used to decorate the chain terminus of polyfluorene with substituents enabling the construction of block copolymers by coupling of individual chains.268 Moreover, the bromine decorated chain terminus of P3HT prepared by KCTP is often applied as a starting or end capping unit for subsequent cross coupling reactions, e.g. Suzuki polycondensation.269–272 In general, two synthetic approaches to prepare the second block can be devised either relying on the polymerization of AA/BB-type (Scheme 16) or AB-type monomers (Scheme 17) (A = Br, B = B(OR)2, SnR3, ZnCl, Br). The polymerization of two complementary monomers (AA/BB-type) is widely utilized to prepare alternating copolymers, but the obtained polymers generally feature a broader molar mass distribution compared to AB-type systems. An overview of reported examples for both approaches is provided in Tables 9 and 10.

The combination of KCTP and Stille coupling polymerization is commonly used in particular for the preparation of donor–acceptor copolymers, as it is very challenging to prepare electron-deficient polymers by classical KCTP protocols. In contrast, Stille coupling enables facile preparation of the electron acceptor block as successfully shown in the synthesis of NDI (=naphthalene diimide) containing block copolymers with an acceptable dispersity.275–277 In this regard, the P3HT277 as well as the NDI275,276 containing block were applied as macroinitiators. Additionally, other acceptor building blocks, e.g. PCDTBT, were utilized in combination with P3HT as a macroinitiator.273,274,278,279
For completion, it is stated that the combination of KCTP with Yamamoto280–282 or Negishi283 coupling is also reported for the preparation of AB or ABA donor–acceptor polymers. In particular for Yamamoto coupling, the control of the polymerization process is low and the formation of byproducts, e.g. homopolymer, in larger amounts is reported (entry 4, Table 10).


3.4.4 Other combined techniques. 
Although fullerenes are usually sensitive towards typical polymerization conditions, e.g. anions, cations, strong bases or radicals, examples for multiblock copolymers synthesized by step-growth polymerization techniques are reported. In this regard, successful incorporation relies on the mild reaction conditions of the nucleophilic substitution284 or imine condensation processes.285
The combination of KCTP polymerization and ROMP of cyclooctene with subsequent hydrogenation leading to P3HT-b-PE block copolymers is described by Radano et al.286 The resulting tough, semiconducting crystalline–crystalline block copolymers may be useful for the fabrication of flexible electronic components.287 Last but not least, hydroxyl terminated P3HT is also capable of initiating the ring-opening polymerization of lactide.288

4. Graft and comb polymers
Graft and comb polymers consist of a linear polymer backbone and covalently connected side chains of one or more different species.27,289,290 Thus, these copolymers allow the incorporation of functional units besides the backbone to optimize the properties and functions of polymer architectures, e.g. to improve the solubility or to attach additional antenna dyes in light harvesting systems. After introduction of the basic principles to construct graft polymers, the following section presents concrete examples to illustrate the possible scope of photo- and electrochemically active graft copolymers.
In general, the preparation of graft copolymers is possible by three construction principles: grafting onto, grafting from and grafting through (Scheme 18).289–291 The grafting onto approach is based on the reaction of functional units in the backbone of the main chain polymer A with the end groups of the telechelic side chain polymer B. As the main chain polymer and the side chain units are synthesized separately, both blocks can be prepared by appropriate methods and the molar mass and dispersity of the parts can be controlled. As a limitation, the realization of a high grafting density is restricted by steric hindrance and additionally requires a high yield coupling reaction, e.g. the nitroxide radical coupling reaction292 or the CuAAC reaction.289,290 Noteworthily, the separation of unreacted side chains and the graft copolymer can be challenging.
 Scheme 18  Synthetic methods for the synthesis of graft copolymers. 
The grafting from strategy grows the side chains directly from the initiating units of the polymer backbone. The initiating group either originates from the monomer of the main chain polymer or is introduced in the main chain by a polymer analogous reaction. Major advantages of the approach are the facile purification due to the absence of unreacted macromolecules (vide supra) and the decrease of the steric effect compared to the grafting onto and grafting through approaches.289
The grafting through strategy involves the polymerization of macromonomers with a polymerizable end group.289,290 Technically, this technique also includes the preparation of homopolymers featuring large solubilizing groups in the side chains, e.g. long alkyl or ethylene glycol chains. Advantageously, the molar mass of the later side chains can be well-defined as the macromonomer is prepared separately. The grafting density that can be reached is 100% but steric hindrance can influence the polymerization and more importantly due to an incomplete conversion of the macromonomers a challenging purification step can be necessary.
The hydrodynamic volume of graft polymers differs from linear polymers, so the SEC molar masses and dispersities are only of very limited use for comparison and will not be reported. Instead grafting densities and yields are given in the tables.
4.1. Conjugated graft copolymers with electrochemically active side chains
The side chain functionalization of conjugated polymers represents a promising approach to introduce a further functionality, e.g. electron acceptors293,295,297 or donors,294,296,298 in the respective polymer. An overview of reported graft copolymers containing acceptor or donor side chains is displayed in Table 11 including reported grafting densities and yields. As it can be seen, the grafting densities and yields for “grafting onto” approaches are limited.

Besides polymer based side chains, also the attachment of discrete electrochemically active units was reported (Table 11, entries 1 to 4). In this regard, a donor–acceptor assembly based on a grafting through approach is reported by Marder's group (entry 4).297 The compounds, which were prepared by copolymerization of perylene diimide functionalized dibromocarbazoles and fluorene derivatives, revealed long-lived charge separated states. Polythiophenes are also applied as side chains in graft polymers. The respective materials can be prepared by any of the introduced methods. A grafting from approach is reported by Higashihara’s group (entry 5).294 The authors prepared various conjugated polymers containing 3-(4′-chloro-3′-tolyl)thiophene units by Stille reaction and subsequently converted the materials into macroinitiators by addition of nickel complexes. These macroinitiators are suitable to graft polythiophene side chains from the polymer backbone (entry 6). Telechelic polythiophenes can also be grafted onto suitable polymers, e.g. PPE (entry 7).296 In this regard the already mentioned CuAAC reaction represents a very powerful tool for functionalization even though a grafting density of 100% is not reached. Moreover, grafting through of P3HT based macromonomers is possible (entry 8).298 For this purpose a functionalized Nickel catalyst is used (vide supra) to initiate the polymerization of P3HT and the so obtained telechelic macromonomer is applied to construct the polymer backbone.
4.2. Graft copolymers containing a saturated main chain
Graft copolymers of conjugated and non-electrochemically active units either contain a non-conjugated backbone or non-conjugated side chains. In the first case, the backbone often fulfills a structural function, whereas in the case of modified side chains the physical properties can be modified, e.g. the solubility. The first scenario will be discussed in the following section and relevant examples are depicted in Table 12.

Polystyrene displays a readily available and easily modifiable polymer backbone, which can be used in combination with P3HT for grafting from (Table 12, entries 2 and 3)300,302 and onto approaches (entry 4 and 7).304,309 The resulting graft copolymers are characterized by a good solubility304 and the ability to form stable films on surfaces.300,302 Besides, PS is also utilized in donor and/or acceptor graft polymers, in which the active units are grafted onto the backbone by hydrosilylation (entry 5)306 or CuAAC reactions (entry 6).308 Another suitable polymer backbone is polynorbonene which can be prepared by the ROMP process in high yields from telechelic P3HT macromonomers (entries 9, 13 and 15).299,307,310 The obtained bottlebrush architecture resulted in an increased π–π interaction and, therefore, a strong aggregation of the P3HT side chains.310 Surface immobilized polynorbonene was used in a grafting from strategy for the step-by-step construction of ordered heterojunctions (entry 11).303 Moreover, after hydrogenation of the backbone an increased electric field breakdown strength was observed, making the materials promising candidates for dielectrics.307 Interestingly, the group of Nishide prepared radical containing graft copolymers by a combination of anionic polymerization and ROMP (entry 16).312 In the first step, the anionic polymerization of a TEMPO-based monomer yielded a norbornene-substituted macromonomer, which was subsequently polymerized with a Grubbs catalyst. Due to the functional group tolerance, high yields (>94% for each step) and high radical concentrations (0.95 radicals per monomer unit) were reached.
The anionic polymerization of glycidyl derivatives and the subsequent grafting of active units onto the main chain represent an additional method for the construction of electrochemically active graft polymers (entry 10).301 Interestingly, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) can be modified with TEMPOL leading to a macroinitiator for NMP with vinyl naphthalene by a grafting from approach (entry 12).305 As the hydroxyl groups of the PVA stay intact during polymerization, a water soluble graft copolymer is obtained despite the hydrophobicity of the side chains. However, the grafting density is low. Last but not least, an example featuring polyacrylamide as the main chain will be shortly presented (entry 8). The group of Meijer reported the grafting of porphyrins onto a modified poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate) by amidation leading to single-chain polymeric nanoparticles. These particles act as photosensitizers and can produce singlet oxygen.311
The before mentioned acyclic diene metathesis polymerization (see Section “Redox-active and conjugated polymers by ring opening metathesis polymerization”) was also applied to prepare perylene bisimide-substituted polyethylene (entry 1).94
4.3. Tuning the physical properties with the side chains
The side chain functionalization or manipulation of conjugated polymers represents an efficient way to tune inter alia the self-assembly behavior,251,329 solubility,109 processability330,333 or energy levels of polymers.328 An overview of the modified polymers is provided in Table 13. All reported polymers feature very high grafting efficiencies but the isolated yield is commonly lower due to losses upon purification.

The first reported method enabling the side chain modification of P3HT applied 2,5-dibromo-3-(ω-bromoalkyl)thiophene as the monomer.315,317,334 Surprisingly, the halogen substituted side chain was not affected by the Grignard reagents and was further functionalized by nucleophilic substitution, e.g. with glucose derivatives315 (Table 13, entry 3) or units capable of hydrogen bonding (entries 4 and 26).317 Furthermore, tuning of the solubility was accomplished by varying the side chains. As a consequence, a good solubility in organic solvents can be readily achieved by the introduction of long solubilizing groups, e.g. polyisobutylene (entry 18).316 In contrast, the introduction of polar side groups results in a good solubility in polar solvents, e.g. water or alcohol (entries 1 and 30).109,331,332,335 The influence of linear or branched polyether side chains on the assembly of PPV-based block copolymers was investigated by Zentel’s group (entry 14).251 The applied grafting onto approach allowed modular construction of the compounds, i.e. various side chains were attached on the same starting copolymer by amidation. On the basis of TEM images, different structures were observed, depending on the side chains. Wittmeyer et al. pursued a similar approach as they prepared water-soluble PPPs with ethylene oxide based side chains by a grafting through strategy (entries 5 and 6).319 An additional increase of the polarity of the branched chains was accomplished by the incorporation of ionic groups leading to a class of polyelectrolytes (entries 2, 7, 15, 16, 19 and 20).131,313,318,321 The respective ionic groups result from the modification of ω-bromoalkyl side chains, i.e. in general by quaternization with amines.131,313,321 Besides the good solubility of these materials and, thus, an improved processability, e.g. in water as an environmentally friendly solvent,313 also surfactochromic properties131 and a high charge density can be achieved.318 Interestingly, the group of Chen reported various conjugated polymers with crown ether decorated side chains for the complexation of potassium ions (entries 12, 13, 22, 24 and 25).1–3 The polymers were applied as electron transport layers in polymer solar cells and resulted in an increased power conversion efficiency. This improvement is inter alia based on an optical interference effect, the enhanced electron conduction and the blocking of electron–hole combination at the interface with the cathode.1,2
Moreover, adequate side chains can be utilized for crosslinking reactions to enhance the mechanical properties in polymer films (entry 18).316 For this purpose, H-bond crosslinkable units,316 UV-crosslinkable moieties, e.g. azides (entry 8)322 or 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethylbenzophenone/maleimide (entry 9),324 or thermal crosslinkable hydroxyl (entry 21)320 moieties, are introduced in the monomer units, e.g. in the alkyl side chain of thiophene. After film formation, the polymer is then crosslinked by the external stimuli. Alternatively, the crosslinking can be achieved by the addition of a multidentate crosslinker, which reacts with functional groups of the polymer to form a network, e.g. by the thiol–ene “Click” reaction (entry 17)314 or by the reaction of diisocyanates with hydroxyl or amine groups (entries 10 and 23).323
The side chain decoration of polyfluorene with P2VP represents a suitable approach to control the morphology in ordered nanostructures similar to block copolymers as shown by Lee et al. (entry 11).325 The variation of the volume fractions of the P2VP side chain led to well-ordered cylinders or lamellae.
4.4. Graft copolymers containing metal complexes
Metal complexes are an important class of photosensitizers and catalysts for light harvesting materials. Their incorporation into polymer side chains enables structural control to construct light harvesting antennas and in the case of electrochemically active polymers, additionally light induced charge separation can be realized within such an assembly. In general, the polymerization of metal containing monomers is impractical due to possible side reactions with the active propagating species336 so that preferential “grafting onto” approaches are applied in the literature (Scheme 19).
 Scheme 19  Schematic representation of reported preparation methods for graft polymers containing metal complexes. 
Polystyrene and PMA derivatives are readily available by CRP and represent often used polymers to provide a structure for the attachment of photosensitizers.47,337–341 Suitable linking reactions to decorate the polymer backbone are shown in Scheme 19 and include the CuAAC reaction339–342 or amidation reactions.47,337,338 Noteworthily, the azide functionality – necessary for the CuAAC reaction – is introduced in a postpolymerization reaction by nucleophilic substitution as general azides are not compatible with common polymerization conditions.339–342 The conversion of the subsequent CuAAC reaction is reported to be quantitative. Monomers with NHS ester moieties are directly polymerized and side chain decorated with the respective amino-substituted Ru(II) photosensitizer with loadings up to 90% in good yields (75%).47,338 Interestingly, poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) can directly act as a monodentate ligand for metal complexes without further modification. Hence, the functionalization of surface bound P4VP with hydrogen production cobalt catalysts is readily achieved and increased the performance of the photocathode in devices.343
Besides the presented PS and PMA based photosensitizer-polymer assemblies, a very exciting grafting through approach for a light harvesting graft polymer based on an amino acid backbone was introduced by the group of Meyer.344 The authors prepared an oligoproline by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) applying modified monomers bearing Ru(II) complexes as a chromophore or phenothiazine moieties as an electron donor (Fig. 7). The yields for coupling steps between unmodified prolines were 97 to 99% and 20 to 30% for the modified analogs. Therefore, the crude products had to be purified by HPLC to isolate the pure assemblies with 16, 17, 18 or 19 amino acids. The observed helical architecture of the polymer backbone provides a structurally well-defined environment for the photo-redox-active assembly and enables distance dependent analysis of electron transfer processes. Furthermore, by the defined incorporation of Ru(II) and Os(II) complexes in the assemblies also an antenna system with a secondary structure could be obtained and the distance dependence of excited state energy transfer processes was studied.345 Modularity was additionally accomplished in the systems by combination with “Click” chemistry, i.e. azido functionalized prolines were utilized in the SPPS and were subsequently functionalized with metal complexes to allow a high variability.346–348 These structurally well-defined assemblies represent promising model compounds for photoelectrosynthesis cells as they can be immobilized on surfaces using complexes with anchor groups346–348 and the modular approach allows for the application of several different metal complexes, e.g. to incorporate water oxidation catalysts.347,348 Noteworthily, the modification of the polymer backbone, i.e. the utilization of other amino acids besides proline, resulted in a much less ordered architecture.349
 Fig. 7  Schematic representation of the chemical structure of metal complex substituted polyproline and of the resulting helical structure with 3.3 monomer units per turn (adapted from ref. 345 and 346). 
In addition to providing a structural backbone, the application of conjugated polymers enables the realization of charge transport processes or additional light absorption in metal complex containing graft polymers. One of the earliest examples of such an approach is reported by Cheng et al. by the preparation of substituted poly(phenylenethiophene)s and poly(fluorenethiophene)s with ruthenium terpyridine trithiocyanato complexes.336 For this purpose, terpyridine functionalized dibromobenzene and dibromofluorene were synthesized and subsequently polymerized with thiophenediboronic acid by Suzuki coupling. The complexation with ruthenium was afterwards realized in a “grafting to” approach consisting of two reaction steps with yields of 99% and 89%, respectively, and quasi-quantitative functionalization. Noteworthily, the direct polymerization of ruthenium containing monomers did not lead to any polymer.
A series of light-harvesting polymers loaded with Ru(II) complexes by a grafting onto approach utilizing “Click” chemistry is reported by the groups of Schanze and Papanikolas.350–354 The introduction of azide functionalities into suitable substituted polyfluorenes,350,351,354 polythiophenes353 or their respective copolymers351,352 enabled efficient coupling with Ru(II) photosensitizers by the CuAAC reaction (quantitative conversion, yields above 80%). Immobilization of these photo-redox-active assemblies onto TiO2 was also realized by the introduction of anchor groups on the complex’ ligand scaffold (Fig. 8).351,353 The polymer–metal complex hybrid materials showed fast energy and electron transfer processes resulting in the formation of long-lived charge separated states (>100 μs).

4.5. Graft copolymers containing fullerenes
As discussed previously, fullerenes are reactive towards cations, anions and radicals so common fullerene containing monomers are not polymerized directly except by the ROMP process. As a consequence, the grafting of these compounds to a separately prepared polymer with functional side groups is very common. In contrast to low molar mass fullerene derivatives, incorporation into homopolymers6,356,357 leads to an increased solubility and may result in the formation of homogenous films.6 Additionally, fullerenes also represent promising candidates for donor–acceptor polymers due to their electron accepting properties. These compounds are either introduced as electron accepting side chains of conducting polymers, e.g. PPV,358 or are more prominent in block copolymers as electron acceptor blocks.5,43,234,237,359–362 In general, two approaches leading to fullerene grafted block copolymers can be distinguished. Either a telechelic homopolymer is fullerene decorated and coupled with the second block (Scheme 20A) or the block copolymer is prepared first and the fullerene is introduced in the second step (Scheme 20B).
 Scheme 20  Schematic representation of synthetic approaches leading to fullerene decorated block copolymers. 
Suitable polymer backbones, which are often used for a later fullerene substitution, include PS6,40,43,234,237,357,359,361 and PMA/PA356,360,362 derivatives as they can be readily prepared with CRP techniques using functional initiators or macroinitiators leading to defined reactive end groups capable of further reactions (see Section “Block copolymers”). Suitable reactions for the attachment of fullerenes on the polymer are shown in Scheme 21. As it can be seen, the Prato reaction,358 the Bingel reaction,357 cycloadditions with subsequent nitrogen extrusion43,361,363 and the addition of diazo compounds237 can be performed with pristine fullerenes if the monomer units in the polymer feature the appropriate functional groups. On the one hand, these approaches are straightforward as unfunctionalized fullerenes are commercially available but potentially cross-linking is possible due to multiple reactions of one single fullerene molecule and therefore these reactions require the application of a large excess of fullerene.237 In contrast, the application of functionalized fullerene derivatives and their subsequent incorporation into the polymer side chains avoids the cross-linking issue. Suitable reactions for this approach include Steglich esterifaction,6,40,234,362 the CuAAC reaction5,356 or etherification reactions (Scheme 22).359 In general, fullerene containing block copolymers are rod–coil copolymers and are expected to improve the morphological control in organic solar cells, e.g. as compatibilizers or stabilizers. In contrast to blends, the polymers are able to show microphase separation without undesired macrophase separation.5,6,234,237,356,359,362 Moreover, improved long-term stability of the structures and reduced agglomeration behavior is also expected resulting in higher efficiencies of organic solar cells.5,6,237,360 The grafting density of the polymers is typically below 100% as the fullerene is sterically hindered. The calculation of the mass fraction of the attached fullerene is often hampered as very weak NMR signals have to be quantified and, therefore, often relies on TGA analysis.

A more comprehensive discussion of polymers containing fullerenes and related reactions is not possible at this point due to the scope of the review. Therefore we would like to refer to reviews detailing these respective topics.364–366
5. Chain end functionalization with functional building blocks
The initially introduced polymerization techniques produce telechelic polymers, whose reactive end groups are by definition capable of further reactions and, therefore, enable the attachment of functional units, e.g. substituents to influence the assembly properties or photo- or redox-active moieties.11,367
The determination of the end functionalization efficiency and the separation of non-functionalized and functionalized polymers are challenging and are not always mentioned in reports.
Basically, two different approaches leading to end functionalization can be differentiated, in situ functionalization and post polymerization functionalization (Scheme 23). In situ functionalization (Scheme 23A) exploits the high reactivity of the propagating species that is formed during a polymerization process. In a typical approach an end capping reagent is added to quench the active species and to simultaneously introduce a functional unit. This technique is often utilized in anionic polymerizations. For instance, Natori et al. prepared styrenic triarylamines and functionalized the obtained polymer by the addition of C60 fullerene, which readily reacts with the anionic species.63,368 The in situ approach is also suitable for the chain end decoration of conjugated polymers. Classical step growth polycondensation reactions with AA/BB type monomers can be quenched by an excess of the desired functional unit, which is either modified with the reactive group A or B. A compelling example is provided by Robb et al. as the authors synthesized a PDPP2FT donor–acceptor polymer by Stille coupling and introduced bromine bearing perylene diimide (PDI) as an end capper to terminate the propagating chains resulting in more than 50% bisfunctionalized chains.369 The functionalized polymer revealed an efficient charge transfer between the main polymer chain and the PDI moieties as a result of the covalent linkage.369 A second example is given by the group of Wang by in situ end capping of donor–acceptor copolymers with porphyrin complexes during Stille coupling polymerization.370 The obtained materials featured an enhancement of light absorption and improved power conversion efficiency (by 50%). A similar approach utilizing AB monomers is presented by Krebs and Biancardo, who attached ruthenium dyes on P3HT by Stille coupling to prepare materials for dye sensitized solar cells.371 However, full conversion was not reached in the P3HT–Ru-complex dyad that still contained residual unfunctionalized homopolymer.
 Scheme 23  Schematic representation of synthetic approaches towards chain end decoration with functional units, either by in situ functionalization (A) or postpolymerization modification of telechelic polymers (B). 
In contrast to the in situ functionalization procedure, the end functionalization approach by a post polymerization reaction (Scheme 23B) is characterized by the usage of a purified telechelic polymer in a consecutive reaction after the actual polymerization. The required reactive end group capable of further functionalization is often introduced by utilization of a suitable initiator. A major advantage of the procedure is the modularity, so that a large batch of the prepared polymer can be decorated with different functional units and, thus, a good comparability and reproducibility is ensured when the influence of various end groups, e.g. metal complexes, on the polymer properties is investigated (Scheme 24).372 The end functionalization of redox-active polymers prepared by NMP with photoactive ruthenium complexes was elaborately investigated by Schroot et al.37,372,373 The presented modular assembly of donor–photosensitizer and acceptor–photosensitizer dyads was accomplished by nucleophilic reactions and the CuAAC reaction of the NMP initiator's starting group and suitable substituted metal complexes in yields between 40 and 71%. Besides, a simplified purification protocol by modified silica gels was developed to ensure the complete removal of unfunctionalized polymer and excess metal complex. Moreover, the detected charge transfer within the architectures illustrated the eligibility of the chosen approach.374 Another interesting example for the end functionalization using a metal complex is reported by Fang et al. (Scheme 25).340 The combination of RAFT polymerization, CuAAC click reaction and subsequent esterification allowed the construction of a chromophore–catalyst assembly consisting of Ru(II) polypyridyl-derivatized polypropylacrylate and a terminal water oxidation catalyst with a good yield of 63% for the last two steps. Interestingly, this example combines chain end as well as side chain functionalization reactions and underlines the versatility of the RAFT process. The presented approaches also enable directional energy or charge transfer as a result of the linear prepared architecture.

 Scheme 25  Schematic representation of the construction of terminal water oxidation catalyst decorated polypyridyl Ru(II)-derivatized polypropylacrylate by RAFT polymerization applying side chain as well as chain end functionalization techniques.340 
As discussed in previous sections, cross coupling reactions may also lead to telechelic polymers capable of further modification reactions. The synthesis of C60 end capped P3HT is described by Lee et al.7 In a first step, in situ end capping with allylmagnesium bromide yielded telechelic P3HT, which was converted in hydroxypropyl-terminated P3HT by hydroboration. Finally Steglich esterification gave the desired fullerene end capped polymer (end capping efficiency >90%), which acts as a compatibilizer and increases the stability of bulk heterojunction solar cells.7 A second example for the end functionalization of conjugated telechelic polymers is the decoration of ethynyl end group bearing polyfluorene by the CuAAC reaction with bio-targeting groups for sensing applications.109 However, the amount of functionalized polymer chains was not determined.
Although this review focuses on electrochemically active polymers, the decoration of non-electrochemically active polymers with photo- or redox-active units can be desired to tune and improve the mechanical and optical properties, e.g. absorption maxima, film forming properties or mechanical stability.4,375,376 The improvement of device stability and efficiency is demonstrated by Raissi et al. by end capping of P3HT-b-PS with C60 fullerene utilizing atom transfer radical addition.4 Subsequently the material was applied as a compatibilizer in bulk heterojunction solar cells and improved the efficiency as well as the stability by inducing interpenetrating domains.
In summary, the chain end functionalization of telechelic electrochemically active polymers with functional units is of special interest for architectures including light harvesting units as the decoration of the chain end ensures a linear architecture and directional energy or charge transport processes.
6. Conclusion
Synthetic approaches leading to well-defined polymer based architectures with tunable (opto)electronic properties were reviewed. The utilization of these tailor-made architectures facilitates new possibilities with regard to important physical parameters, e.g., morphology control and morphology stability, and enables the construction of multipurpose materials.
The controlled synthesis of redox-active and conjugated polymers represents a key step for the construction of these macromolecules. Modern polymerization methods for redox-active polymers, e.g. controlled anionic or radical polymerization or ROMP techniques, and conjugated polymers, e.g. Kumada catalyst transfer polymerization and related techniques, provide the fundamental basis for the covalent incorporation of various polymers in larger architectures. Thus a large number of different telechelic polymers can be readily prepared and further applied to prepare block or comb polymers as well as end functionalized polymers. The combination of two or more different monomer units in these macromolecules enables the realization of donor–acceptor polymers, photoredox-active dyads and triads or tuning of physical properties.
The synthesis of block copolymers can be achieved by the initially discussed polymerization techniques by application of the sequential monomer addition approach, the macroinitiator approach or the coupling of polymerization techniques (bifunctional initiator or telechelic homopolymers). Graft and comb polymers are readily prepared by grafting onto, from or through approaches utilizing the aforementioned polymerization techniques as well as highly efficient coupling reactions, e.g. the CuAAC reaction. The coupling reactions are also of fundamental importance for the construction of directional end functionalized architectures, e.g. light harvesting antennas or donor–photosensitizer–acceptor assemblies. However, challenges remain as often functionalization reactions are not quantitative or rather hard to quantify by analytical methods and challenging purification and fractionation steps may be necessary.
In the future the steadily increasing number of functional initiators and coupling reagents as well as the development of polymerization techniques will further expand the number of well-defined covalently linked architectures.

 	Scheme 19  Schematic representation of reported preparation methods for graft polymers containing metal complexes.	 

 	Fig. 7  Schematic representation of the chemical structure of metal complex substituted polyproline and of the resulting helical structure with 3.3 monomer units per turn (adapted from ref. 345 and 346).	 

 	Fig. 8  Polyfluorene based metal decorated architecture bound to TiO2 for light harvesting and charge separation (reprinted with permission from ref. 350, Copyright 2014 American Chemical Society).	 

 	Scheme 20  Schematic representation of synthetic approaches leading to fullerene decorated block copolymers.	 

 	Scheme 21  Schematic representation of synthetic methods for the side chain decoration of polymers with unfunctionalized fullerenes (the formed linking motif is marked in red).	 

 	Scheme 22  Schematic representation of synthetic methods for the side chain decoration of polymers with functionalized fullerenes (the formed linking motif is marked in red).	 

 	Scheme 23  Schematic representation of synthetic approaches towards chain end decoration with functional units, either by in situ functionalization (A) or postpolymerization modification of telechelic polymers (B).	 

 	Scheme 24  Schematic representation of telechelic polymers as a modular basis for the synthesis of acceptor–photosensitizer dyads.372	 

 	Scheme 25  Schematic representation of the construction of terminal water oxidation catalyst decorated polypyridyl Ru(II)-derivatized polypropylacrylate by RAFT polymerization applying side chain as well as chain end functionalization techniques.340
