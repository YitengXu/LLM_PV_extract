    , Accepted 6th March 2019First published on 6th March 2019AbstractDensity functional theory and semi-classical Marcus electron transfer theory were employed to investigate the electron transport properties of a sulfur-containing azaacene molecule 10,14-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)dipyrido[3,2-a:20,30-c][1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]phenazine (TDTP), which has been proved to have high performance as an electron transport material in inverted perovskite solar cells in a previous experiment. By changing thiophene rings in both side chains to thiazole/benzene rings, two new compounds TDTP-I and TDTP-II were designed. It has been found that both new compounds have lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels and higher electron mobilities than TDTP. In particular, compound TDTP-II has the highest electron mobility among the three. Furthermore, the adsorption properties of TDTP/TDTP-II adsorbed on perovskite (110) surface systems are also studied. It has been shown that TDTP-II has a more negative adsorption energy than TDTP. So our designed compound TDTP-II is expected to be a potential electron transport material in inverted PSCs and changing the side chains could be a feasible way to improve the electron transport properties.
1. Introduction
In the past decade, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received much attention owing to their high efficiency1–3 and simple solution processing4 since the pioneering work by Miyasaka's group in 2009.5 Up to now, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of this kind of solar cell can reach above 23%.6,7
The electron transport layer (ETL, for example, TiO2) is an important component in PSCs. Metal oxides are usually used as an ETL in a traditional n–i–p configuration PSC.8 However, high-temperature annealing is required to prepare metal oxides, which can hinder the solution-processed fabrication of this type of solar cell at low temperature, especially when flexible substrates and large-scale roll to roll techniques are empolyed.9 To overcome this issue, metal oxide free inverted perovskite solar cells (with p–i–n configuration) have been adopted because of their low-temperature and they are achieved by a solution-based process. Several kinds of ETL materials have been applied in inverted PSCs, such as fullerene derivatives (for example, PCBM),10–13 n-type organic polymers (for example, PFN-2TNDI14), and n-type organic small molecules. Fullerene derivatives have some disadvantages, such as high cost, poor ambient stability, and so on.15–17 Non-fullerene n-type organic small molecules are easily synthesized and their energy levels are tunable by modifying their structures. They are promising ETL materials. Even so, it is not easy to find a suitable candidate. To our knowledge, so far only a few non-fullerene organic small molecules have been reported as ETLs in inverted PSCs and the highest PCE can reach 20.2%.9,17–22

N-Substituted heteroacenes, i.e., azaacenes, have been demonstrated to show good n-type performance in organic field effect transistors and photoelectrochemical cells.23–25 It is suggested that azaacenes should be good ETL candidates in inverted PSCs.20 In a recent study, a sulfur-containing azaacene molecule 10,14-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)dipyrido[3,2-a:20,30-c][1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]phenazine (TDTP, Scheme 1) was designed and synthesized, which was used as a non-fullerene ETL material for inverted PSCs.9 The repeatable PCE was as high as 18.2%, with a current density of 22.4 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.05 V and a fill factor of 77.7%. In spite of this high performance, the electron mobility of TDTP was only about 2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. For further improvement in PCE, increasing the electron mobility is a feasible way.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of the studied molecules in this paper. 
On the basis of our previous studies,26,27 extending the conjugation of the azaacene core can increase electron mobility. How about changing the side chains? Li's group28 designed five TDTP derivatives by introducing a nitrogen atom into the thiophene ring in the side chain or replacing a hydrogen atom on the methyl in the side chain with an amino group. Theoretical calculations reveal that all the five designed TDTP-based ETMs exhibit enhanced electron mobility, air stability, and solubility compared to TDTP. However, the calculated electron mobility of TDTP is 0.023 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is about two orders of magnitude larger than the experimental value (2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). We note that in the theoretical calculations, the authors replace 2-ethylhexyl of TDTP in the experiment with a methyl group. Will this simplification change the electron transport properties? In addition, what about the side chain with no heteroatoms?
According to previous studies,14,22,28 the introduction of a nitrogen atom into ETMs can increase the interface properties between the perovskite and ETMs. So TDTP-I (see Scheme 1) with thiazole rings replacing the thiophene rings in both side chains was designed. The design of TDTP-II with benzene rings was inspired by Zhang's work,29 which implied that the introduction of the benzene ring could increase the interaction between the dimer and improve the carrier mobility. So in this paper, two newly designed sulfur-containing azaacene molecules TDTP-I and TDTP-II were investigated. The terminal methyl group in ref. 28 is replaced by 2-ethylhexyl, the same as used in the experiment.9 The electronic structure method is a convenient way to predict the electronic properties of various systems. In the past 30 years, Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as the most popular electronic structure method in computational chemistry.30–32 As a result, DFT calculations were performed and it was found that the designed compounds may both have a higher electron mobility than TDTP. Furthermore, the properties of the ETL molecules adsorbed on the perovskite surface are also simulated.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly present a general description of the computational details. Section 3 illustrates results including frontier molecular orbitals, electronic absorption spectra, reorganization energies, electron transfer integrals, electron mobilities, hydrophobicity and solubility of the three compounds, as well as their adsorption properties on the perovskite (110) surface. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 4.
2. Computational methods
Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to optimize the geometries of the neutral (see Fig. S1, ESI†) and charged states by the B3LYP hybrid functional33,34 with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.35–37 The vibrational frequencies for all optimized geometries were computed to be real at the same theoretical level, which ensures energetic minima. Based on the ground state geometry of the experimental molecule TDTP, the vertical electronic absorption spectrum of TDTP was screened by time dependent DFT (TD-DFT) with a series of functionals, such as B3LYP, PBE0,38 M06-2X,39 CAM-B3LYP40 and LC-BLYP.41,42 The solvent effect was also taken into account by a polarizable continuum model (dichloromethane, ε = 8.93).43 Our findings lead us to conclude that the maximum absorption peak obtained by the LC-BLYP functional is in good agreement with the experimental data (see Fig. S2, ESI†).9 Therefore, the absorption spectra of the designed molecules were also simulated by the TD-LC-BLYP method. All the above calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package.44
In order to describe the carrier transport behavior accurately, the semi-classical Marcus theory with a hopping model was applied. The charge hopping rate (k) for the self-exchange reaction is expressed as:45,46 (1)where Vi,j is the transfer integral, h is the Planck constant, kB represents the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. For the present system, we set T = 298 K. λ denotes the reorganization energy that is obtained by an adiabatic potential energy surface method,47,48 and it is expressed as:49 λ = λ0 + λ+/− = (E0* − E0) + (E+/−* − E+/−)(2)where E+/− and E0 are the total energies of the cationic/anionic and neutral species in their corresponding ground state geometries. E+/−* and E0* represent the total energies of the cationic/anionic and neutral species with the geometries of the neutral and cationic/anionic species, respectively.
To achieve high carrier mobility, λ needs to be minimized, and V demands to be maximized. Vi,j denotes the intermolecular transfer integral between the neighboring molecules, as displayed in the following equation:50–52 Vi,j = 〈Ψ0i|0|Ψ0j〉(3)where Ψ0i is the unperturbed frontier orbital of molecule i and Ψ0j is that of molecule j in the dimer. 0 represents the Fock operator. The Fock matrix can be written as F = SCεC−1, S is the intermolecular overlap matrix, and C and ε denote the molecular orbital coefficient and eigenvalue, respectively. The corresponding calculations were performed at the M06-2X39/6-31G(d,p) level of theory, which has already been used to calculate the electronic coupling in organic semiconductors.53–56
The electron mobilities of the investigated molecules were calculated by using the Einstein relation:57–59 (4)where d represents the spatial dimensionality and the electron transport pathway is premeditated in three dimensions, ri is the charge hopping centroid-to-centroid distance, and Pi is defined as the relative hopping probability for the ith pathway, which can be determined by: (5)It has been verified that the contribution of the transfer route between the most stable dimer is much larger than that of other pathways in the overall drift mobility.60 Therefore, in our work, the most stable dimer is selected for calculation, so there is only one transfer path (i = 1 and Pi = 1). Thus, electron drift mobility was obtained using the above formulas. Therein, the geometry of the dimer was obtained using the following approach.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the dimer were accomplished using the Materials Studio 7.0 package.61 Firstly, the two identical molecules were placed in a 50 × 50 × 50 Å3 cubic box randomly. After the box was built, we chose the FORCITE module to optimize the molecules and the box, which was helpful for predicting the structure of the organic molecules. Then, the NVT ensemble was selected with a time step of 1 fs and a total simulation time of 30 ps at 298 K in the above module for MD calculations. Afterwards, the rough dimer configuration was extracted as a preliminary guess. Finally, the dimer was optimized using the Gaussian 09 package at the M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) theoretical level.
In order to further investigate the adsorption properties at the interface between CH3NH3PbI3 and the electron transporting materials (ETMs), the ETMs were adsorbed on the 3 × 4 × 4 CH3NH3PbI3 (110) surface with a cell size of 19 × 36 × 46 Å3. The optimization of bare CH3NH3PbI3, isolated ETM molecules and the ETM-CH3NH3PbI3 system was performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)62–65 using a projector-augmented wave (PAW) method.66,67 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the generalized-gradient approximation was used to describe the exchange and correlation functional.68 Most importantly, the bottom two layers of atoms were fixed during the structure optimization. The valence electrons were described by a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV, and a Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid of (2, 2, 1) was applied. The energy during self-consistent-field cycles converged to 1 × 10-4 eV. van der Waals interactions were considered by performing DFT-D3 calculations. In addition, the density of states (DOS) and the projected density of states (PDOS) were calculated at the same level to further analyze the adsorption properties. The VESTA code was used to visualize the crystal structures.69
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Frontier molecular orbital
The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of frontier orbitals are closely related to the gain and loss of electrons. Generally, the HOMOs and LUMOs play a vital role in the hole and electron transport.59,70 In inverted PSCs, the primary condition of an ideal electron transport material is energy level matching, in other words, the energy levels of the LUMO and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the ETM molecules are lower than the energy levels of the conduction band bottom (CBB) and the valence band top (VBT) of the perovskite, respectively. This ensures that the electrons are transferred from the perovskite to the ETM and the ETM also serves as a hole blocking layer to suppress charge recombination. The frontier molecular orbitals of the investigated molecules are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, the HOMO and LUMO are mainly localized on the backbone plane, rather than on the side chain for all investigated molecules. However, the electron density distribution area of the LUMO is larger than that of the HOMO. As a result, large electron density distribution is more beneficial for electron transport indicating that the three studied molecules are suitable as ETMs. It should be noted that the sulfur atom in the backbone plane contributes to the LUMO more than to the HOMO.

Furthermore, the energy level diagram of LiF/Al/ETM/MAPbI3/PEDOT:PSS/ITO glass is shown in Fig. 2. Therein, the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the studied molecules were computed at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level. Note that the energy levels of ITO, PEDOT:PSS, MAPbI3 and LiF/Al are from ref. 9. From Fig. 2, it can be concluded that the LUMO of the designed molecules is lower than the CBB of the perovskite, conforming the energy level matching principle. For TDTP, the calculated LUMO and HOMO energy levels are −4.02 eV and −5.20 eV, which are consistent with the experimental values of −4.03 eV and −5.44 eV, respectively. When the thiophene group is substituted by the thiazole group, the energy levels of the LUMO and the HOMO of TDTP-I reduce by 0.18 eV and 0.32 eV, respectively. So the HOMO–LUMO energy gap becomes larger. From TDTP to TDTP-II, when the thiophene group is substituted by the phenyl group, the energy level of the LUMO changes not significantly, but the energy level of the HOMO decreases by 0.51 eV. As a result, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap becomes the largest among the three. This will lead to the blue-shift of the maximum absorption wavelength, which is consistent with Section 3.2. In addition, the larger difference between the CBB of the CH3NH3PbI3 and the LUMO energy level of the ETM molecule is advantageous for electron injection. Fig. 2 shows that the difference between the LUMO energy levels of the designed molecules and the CBB of CH3NH3PbI3 is larger than that of TDTP, and therefore, the designed molecules TDTP-I and TDTP-II are likely to become the potential electron transport material in inverted PSCs.

3.2 Electronic absorption spectrum
Based on the optimized geometries of ground states, the electronic absorption spectra of the studied molecules in dichloromethane are simulated at the TD-LC-BLYP/6-31G(d,p) level. The corresponding results and the experimental spectral curve of TDTP are shown in Fig. 3. It can be clearly seen from the figure that the maximum absorption peak (λmax) of TDTP is 771 nm, which is in good agreement with an experimental value of about 760 nm. Besides, the spectral shape of TDTP is consistent with the experiment result, which demonstrates the accuracy of the TD-LC-BLYP/6-31G(d,p) method. Compared with TDTP, the maximum absorption peaks of TDTP-I and TDTP-II are both blue-shifted by 57 nm and 191 nm, respectively.

3.3 Reorganization energy, transfer integral and electron mobility
It is well known that electron mobility is an important parameter to measure the performance of the ETMs. Higher electron mobility is an important prerequisite for an ideal ETM. According to eqn (1)–(4), generally, the smaller reorganization energy and larger transfer integral could result in higher electron mobilities. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the molecular dynamics simulations reached the thermal equilibrium after 20 ps for the investigated molecules. In addition, the optimized dimer is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). According to eqn (1)–(5), based on these optimized configurations, electron drift mobilities were obtained. The centroid-to-centroid distance of the dimer, the electron transfer integral, the electron and hole reorganization energy and the electron mobility are listed in Table 1. From Table 1, it can be clearly seen that the electron and hole reorganization energy of TDTP is 0.20 eV and 0.32 eV, respectively. The electron reorganization energy is smaller than the hole reorganization energy, which means that TDTP is more suitable as an electron transporting material for PSCs. Moreover, the electron reorganization energies of TDTP-I and TDTP-II are slightly smaller than that of TDTP. Furthermore, the absolute value of the transfer integral decreases in the order of TDTP-II (44.5 meV) > TDTP-I (21.9 meV) > TDTP (2.79 meV). We can roughly infer that the electron mobilities of the newly designed molecules are higher than that of the experimental molecule. According to our calculations, the obtained electron mobility of TDTP-I (9.83 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) is more than 100 times larger than that of TDTP (6.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and the electron mobility of TDTP-II (4.67 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1) is even larger. This is mainly contributed by a larger electron transfer integral, which may be caused by stronger coplanarity in the backbone plane of TDTP-I and TDTP-II than TDTP (Table 2). Moreover, the insertion of the phenyl group could improve the overlap of the stacking dimers owing to the increased delocalized extent.71 In addition, the experimental electron mobility of TDTP is ∼2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.9 The theoretical value of TDTP agrees well with the experimental value. From the perspective of electron mobility, the newly designed molecules show better electron transporting performance than TDTP. Compared with ref. 28, the electron mobility increases when the 2-ethylhexyl group in the side chain of TDTP and TDTP-I is replaced by the methyl group.

3.4 Hydrophobicity and stability
As for ETMs, except the above-mentioned important factors affecting the overall performance of PSCs, to realize large scale applications, it is also necessary to consider the hydrophobicity, stability, and solubility of the ETMs in PSCs. Due to the lack of experimental data, we can only adopt theoretical calculations to approximately evaluate their properties.
To achieve high temporal stability of PSCs, sensitivity to moisture is the primary drawback. One of the most efficient methods is to employ hydrophobic ETMs to protect the perovskite surface from humidity.72,73 The hydrophobicity is evaluated by the value of lgPn-octanol/water (see Table 3), which can be expressed using the following formula: (6)where lgPn-octanol/water is the partition coefficient, and En-octanol and Ewater are the single point energy of the investigated molecules under the influence of n-octanol and water, respectively. As shown in Table 3, for the three studied molecules, the lgPn-octanol/water value of TDTP-II is larger than that of TDTP, indicating the better hydrophobic property.

The stability of a system can be characterized by absolute hardness η, which is calculated using the following definition:74–76 η = (IPa − EAa)/2(7)where IPa is the adiabatic ionization potential and EAa is the adiabatic electron affinity. The calculated absolute hardness values are summarized in Table 3. It can be obviously seen that the absolute hardness values of the three molecules decrease in the sequence of TDTP-II (2.14) > TDTP-I (1.90) > TDTP (1.82). The absolute hardness values of TDTP-II and TDTP-I are larger than those of TDTP, indicating that our newly designed molecules exhibit better stability and TDTP-II exhibits the highest stability. Compared with ref. 28, the stability decreases when the 2-ethylhexyl group in the side chain of TDTP and TDTP-I is replaced by the methyl group.
3.5 Solubility
The Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameters are important indicators for measuring the solubility of the material in different solvents. The solubility parameters of the molecule and the selected solvent are similar or slightly different, indicating that the blending effect of the two substances is the best. In other words, it follows the basic principle “like dissolves like”.77 For the fabrication of inverted PSCs, ETMs can be dissolved in a solvent to promote the fabrication of devices. Since the commonly used solvent for ETMs in inverted PSCs is chlorobenzene, it is selected as a specified solvent for calculation.
The solubility parameter (δ) is defined as the square root of the cohesive energy density, and expressed by the following formula:78 δ = [(ΔHv − RT)/Vm]1/2(8)where ΔHv is the heat of vaporization and Vm denotes the molar volume. RT is the ideal gas pV term.
The calculation of the solubility parameter was completed in Materials Studio. The force field used in the following MD simulations is the Condensed-phase Optimized Molecular Potentials for Atomistic Simulation Studies (COMPASS). Firstly, the molecular density was predicted by NPT (keeping the particle number, pressure and temperature conserved) simulations. An amorphous cell has been constructed with periodic boundary conditions containing 20 molecules, and the simulated density is set to 1.1 g cm−3. They maintain equilibrium in a 50 ps molecular dynamics with a time step of 1 fs using the NPT ensemble. A Nose thermostat and a Berendsen barostat were chosen for NPT molecular dynamic simulations. Secondly, the cohesive energy density was calculated using NVT simulations. Accurate molecular model prediction was made for the same amorphous cell containing 20 molecules through the previously calculated density. The parameters set by MD simulations using the NVT ensemble are consistent with those set by the NPT ensemble. The solubility parameter calculations are performed using the Ewald summation for both electrostatic and van der Waals non-bond terms. All simulations were run at 298 K.
The δ values of the three ETM molecules and chlorobenzene are theoretically calculated. The calculated δ value for chlorobenzene is 19.55 (J cm−3)1/2, which is consistent with the experimental value of 19.6 (J cm−3)1/2.79 From the results we have obtained, one can conclude that the calculated value is consistent with the experimental value, demonstrating the reliability of our calculation method. The calculated δ values are 20.32 (J cm−3)1/2, 18.72 (J cm−3)1/2, and 19.59 (J cm−3)1/2 for TDTP, TDTP-I and TDTP-II, respectively. They are all similar to that of chlorobenzene, with the difference being less than 0.9 (J cm−3)1/2. Especially the solubility parameter of TDTP-II is almost the same as that of chlorobenzene. Our newly designed molecule TDTP-II is expected to have good solubility in chlorobenzene in the light of the Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameters.
In addition to the Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameters, solvation Gibbs free energies (ΔGsolv) are also used to describe the solubility of the material in an organic solvent, which can be expressed using the following definition:80 ΔGsolv = Gsol − Gg(9)where Gsol and Gg are the Gibbs free energy of the molecules in the solution and in gas phase, respectively. For our studied system, chlorobenzene was chosen as an organic solvent with the help of an SMD model.81 The negative solvation Gibbs free energy shows that the dissolution is a spontaneous process. The obtained ΔGsolv values are listed in Table 3. It can be seen from these values that the solvation Gibbs free energy of TDTP-I is comparable with that of TDTP, indicating that they have similar solubility. Moreover, the solvation Gibbs free energy of TDTP-II is more negative than that of TDTP leading to better solubility. Compared with ref. 28, the solvation Gibbs free energy becomes more positive when the 2-ethylhexyl group in the side chain of TDTP and TDTP-I is replaced by the methyl group. In brief, the newly designed molecule TDTP-II is expected to have better solubility in chlorobenzene both from the perspective of the solubility parameter and solvation Gibbs free energy.
In summary, when the phenyl group replaces the thiophene group of the experimental molecule TDTP, TDTP-II has greater advantages than those of TDTP based on the property of isolated molecules, including larger electron mobility, higher stability and better hydrophobicity, and matched molecular orbital energy levels. The above-mentioned aspects are extremely important properties of ETMs; however, we should also predict the overall performance of the ETMs in PSCs. Therefore, considering the theoretical calculation duration and cost, we next discuss the adsorption of the molecules TDTP and TDTP-II on the perovskite surface in detail.
3.6 Interface property
Although the properties of the isolated ETM molecule are an important aspect of studying PSCs, the interfacial property between the ETM molecule and the CH3NH3PbI3 (110) facet is another factor to affect the overall performance of PSCs. The optimized crystal structure of CH3NH3PbI3 is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). In this work, TDTP and TDTP-II are adsorbed on the CH3NH3PbI3 (110) surface. The optimized structures of TDTP and TDTP-II adsorbed on the CH3NH3PbI3 (110) surface are shown in Fig. 4. It can be clearly seen from the figures that no chemical bond is formed between the investigated molecules and the CH3NH3PbI3 (110) surface, which corresponds to the physical adsorption. The vertical distances from the hydrogen atom for TDTP and TDTP-II which is closest to the CH3NH3PbI3 (110) facet to the CH3NH3PbI3 (110) surface are 4.2 Å and 3.6 Å, respectively. As we all know, a shorter distance facilitates the electron transfer from the perovskite to the ETM. Moreover, the more negative the adsorption energy is, the more stable the adsorption system is. The calculated adsorption energies of TDTP and TDTP-II are listed in Table 4. It is clear to see that the adsorption energy of TDTP-II is more negative than that of TDTP. So TDTP-II adsorbed on the CH3NH3PbI3 (110) surface is more stable.

The density of states (DOS) and the projected density of states (PDOS) for TDTP and TDTP-II are displayed in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. Before adsorption, the band gap of CH3NH3PbI3 is about 0.96 eV. After adsorption, the band gap of CH3NH3PbI3 for TDTP and TDTP-II is 0.95 eV and 0.96 eV, respectively. The band gap of CH3NH3PbI3 is almost unchanged. After adsorption, both the HOMO and the LUMO of the ETM are moved to a lower energy level, which is beneficial for the electron transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to the ETM. In addition, the CBB energy level of the CH3NH3PbI3 is shifted to a more positive value. Conversely, the LUMO energy level of the ETM moves to a more negative value. Thus, the energy difference between the LUMO energy level of the adsorbed ETM and the CBB of CH3NH3PbI3 is increased. The corresponding values are 0.92 eV (after adsorption) vs. 0.47 eV (before adsorption) for TDTP, and 0.95 eV (after adsorption) vs. 0.34 eV (before adsorption) for TDTP-II, respectively. This facilitates electron injection from the CH3NH3PbI3 into the ETM. From PDOS of heteroatoms it can be seen that after adsorption, a new peak appears around 0.4 eV, which is mainly contributed by the 2p orbitals of nitrogen atoms and 3p orbitals of sulfur atoms (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†).
 Fig. 5  Calculated total density of states (DOS) and the projected density of states (PDOS) for interfaces of CH3NH3PbI3 (110) adsorbed by TDTP (a) and TDTP-II (b), respectively. 
In order to clearly present charge transfer and interface redistribution in an adsorbed system, the three-dimensional charge density difference is shown in Fig. 6. The yellow and blue regions represent charge density accumulation and depletion in the space, respectively. It shows that after adsorption, the charge density accumulates towards the perovskite surface, which facilitates the electron transfer from the perovskite to the ETM after photoexcitation.
 Fig. 6  Three-dimensional representation of charge density differences (defined as ρ = ρtotal − ρCH3NH3PbI3 − ρETM, ρtotal is the total charge density, and ρCH3NH3PbI3 and ρETM represent the charge density of the individual parts, respectively). The yellow and blue regions represent charge density accumulation and depletion in the space, respectively. 
4. Conclusion
Density functional theory and semi-classical Marcus electron transfer theory were used to explore the electron transport properties in three sulfur-containing azaacene molecules, including one experimentally reported molecule (TDTP) and two theoretically designed molecules (TDTP-I and TDTP-II). The latter two were designed by changing the thiophene rings in the side chains of TDTP to thiozole/benzene rings. The main conclusions are as follows.
(1) After thiophene rings in the side chains are substituted by thiozole/benzene rings, the energy levels of the HOMO and the LUMO are decreased.
(2) According to a current simple model, our newly designed ETMs TDTP-I and TDTP-II may both have a higher electron mobility than the experimentally reported TDTP. Of course, in the real case, the impacting factors on mobility are far more complicated. It needs further experiments to confirm this.
(3) TDTP-II has more negative adsorption energy with the perovskite (110) surface, than TDTP. Furthermore, the energy difference between the CBB of CH3NH3PbI3 and the LUMO energy level of the ETM is enlarged after adsorption, which is favorable for the electron injection between them.
(4) When the 2-ethylhexyl group in the side chain of TDTP is replaced by the methyl group, the electron mobility increases, the stability decreases and the solubility decreases.
In conclusion, our designed compound TDTP-II is expected to be a potential non-fullerene electron transport material in inverted PSCs.
