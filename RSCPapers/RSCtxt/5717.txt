    , Accepted 21st October 2018First published on 22nd October 2018AbstractAll-inorganic lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have shown great promise for optoelectronic applications due to their unique optical and electrical properties. However, their poor stability against moisture, UV light or thermal attacks greatly hinders their practical applications. One of the reasons for this instability is the proton transfer between oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA), which induces serious ligand loss. The idea of this work is to prevent the interligand proton transfer by replacing OLA with cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) that cannot be protonated. The synthesized CsPbBr3 PQDs in solution show high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 71% and also exhibit higher stability against acetone than the counterparts synthesized using oleylammonium bromide (OLABr). Subsequently, CsPbBr3 PQDs with a peak wavelength of 515 nm (g-CsPbBr3) synthesized using CTAB are further composited with a polymer of carboxyl-functionalized polystyrene (cPS). The composite shows enhanced thermal and moisture stability. It is demonstrated that this green-emitting composite can produce high color gamut (130%) white light-emitting diodes when combined with the K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor and a blue InGaN chip, enabling its use in display backlights.
1 Introduction
Since solid-state perovskite solar cells with a power-conversion efficiency exceeding 9% were first reported,1 lead halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention due to their great potential for use as a next-generation photovoltaic material.2–4 The main merits of this material include a broad absorption band, a high optical absorption coefficient, high defect tolerance, a long carrier lifetime/diffusion length, etc.5,6 These properties have inspired the exploration of them for other interesting applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs),7,8 lasers,9 and photodetectors.10 For photoemission applications, lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) show higher photoluminescence yields (PLQYs) than their bulk counterparts, which originates from the carrier/exciton confinement effect. In addition, other advantages such as a narrow spectra width and a tunable bandgap have also been demonstrated.11–13 These characteristics make PQDs desirable emitters for display applications. However, their further development is seriously hindered by their poor stability. When exposed to moisture, heat or UV light, the crystal structure of PQDs will be slowly destroyed, which is mainly attributed to the nature of the ionic lattice and dynamic ligand surface coverage.14
Some methods have been proposed to improve the stability of PQDs and they can be generally classified into two types. The first one can be easily performed and is to adopt an inert material to coat PQDs. In this case, the PQDs are isolated from oxygen and moisture, so their degradation can be mitigated. Recently, two readily available materials (i.e., silica and polystyrene (PS)) have been widely used as they are sufficiently stable or hydrophobic. For instance, Zhang et al.15 incorporated PQDs into PS microspheres through the in situ hexane-induced formation of PS microspheres in the presence of PQDs. The composite exhibits a good water-resistance and can be used as a luminescent probe in live cells. Wang et al.16 loaded PQDs with a variety of polymers including PS based on the swelling–deswelling process in polymers, and the composites could be used as stable down converters in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). But current polymer coating strategies are mainly based on physical mixing, which limits their processibility and causes possible phase separation. The second method is to increase the intrinsic stability of PQDs, which is generally achieved by doping/alloying hetero atoms,17–19 halide-rich syntheses20–23 or changing the ligands.24,25 For example, Zou et al.19 introduced Mn(II) into the crystal structure of CsPbBr3 PQDs and the obtained product could be stable for 30 days under ambient air conditions. Xuan et al.24 replaced OA with alkyl phosphate during the synthesis, and the product showed enhanced stability against water and heat. Although great progress has been made recently, the stability of CsPbBr3 PQDs against polar solvents especially during purification is still fragile due to the facile proton transfer between oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA) surface capping reagents, which can lead to ligand loss and low stability.26
To suppress the interligand proton transfer, adopting quaternary ammonium halides rather than OLA will be a suitable choice as they cannot be protonated. To the best of our knowledge, only tetraoctylammonium halides26–29 and didodecyldimethylammonium bromide27 have been used for the synthesis of PQDs. In order to make other types of quaternary ammonium halides effective at synthesizing CsPbBr3 PQDs, especially the more common hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), a new synthetic method needs to be established.
In this work, we propose an alternative approach to synthesize CsPbBr3 PQDs without proton transfer between ligands. The reaction is based on CTAB as the bromide source and chloroform as the reaction solvent. The synthesized CsPbBr3 PQDs show high PLQYs up to 71% and improved stability against acetone. Subsequently, for WLED applications, a polymer of carboxyl-functionalized PS (cPS) was synthesized and used as a package material to coat CsPbBr3 PQDs with a peak wavelength of 515 nm (g-CsPbBr3). The composite shows enhanced thermal and moisture stability. By combining this composite with a red-emitting K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor and a blue InGaN LED chip, a cool-white LED was fabricated and it exhibits a color gamut as high as 130% NTSC. This indicates that the composite shows great promise for the application in liquid crystal displays.
2 Experimental section
Materials
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99%), oleic acid (OA, 99%), oleylamine (OLA, 80–90%), lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(Ac)2·3H2O, 99.5%), hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB, 99%), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEB, 98%), tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPB, 98%), n-butyric acid (BA, 99%), n-hexanoic acid (HA, 99%), n-octanoic acid (OCA, 98%), 3-phenylpropionic acid (PA, 98%), tetrabutylammonium iodide (99%), n-hexane, styrene (purified by distillation before use), sorbic acid (AR, 99%), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, 98%), hydrobromic acid (HBr, 47–49%) and octadecene (ODE, 90%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Company. Chloroform (CHCl3, AR, 99%), acetone (AR, 99.5%) and toluene (AR, 99.5%) were purchased from Xilong Chemical Co. Ltd, China. Chloroform-d (CDCl3) was purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd (Shanghai, China).
Preparation of Cs-oleate and other cesium carboxylates
In brief, 0.2 g Cs2CO3 and 0.7 mL OA were loaded into a 3-neck flask along with 10 mL ODE. The mixture was dried at 120 °C under N2 flow until Cs2CO3 was completely dissolved. Since Cs-oleate precipitates out of ODE at room temperature, it has to be preheated over 80 °C to make it soluble before usage.
Other cesium carboxylates were synthesized by replacing OA with an equi-volume amount of other carboxylic acids.
Preparation of Pb-oleate and other lead carboxylates
0.038 g Pb(Ac)2·3H2O and 0.125 mL OA were loaded into a 3-neck flask along with 0.475 mL of ODE. The mixture was dried for 1 h at 120 °C under N2 flow. It was preheated to 80 °C before usage. Other lead carboxylates were synthesized by replacing OA with an equi-volume amount of other carboxylic acids.
Stock solutions of CTAB and other quaternary ammonium bromide compounds
0.01 g of CTAB or a certain amount of other quaternary ammonium bromide compounds was dissolved in 0.5 mL chloroform.
Stock solution of oleylammonium bromide (OLABr). Enough HBr was added into OLA and the precipitate was dried in vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h. The obtained product is OLABr. 0.2 g OLABr was dissolved in 5 mL chloroform for usage.
Synthesis of CsPbBr3 PQDs
In a typical synthesis of CsPbBr3 PQDs, a mixture of 0.14 mL Cs-oleate solution and 0.4 mL Pb-oleate solution was added into 5 mL of chloroform to form a precursor solution. 0.5 mL CTAB stock solution was dropped into the above solution with vigorous stirring at room-temperature. After two minutes, the PQDs solution was transferred to a refrigerator (4 degrees centigrade) to stop the reaction. The synthesis of OLA-CsPbBr3 PQDs is similar to the above except that CTAB was replaced by the same molar quantity of OLABr.
Stability test of CsPbBr3 PQDs against acetone
The crude solution of CsPbBr3 PQDs was purified using acetone. 2 mL of acetone was mixed with 1 mL of PQDs solution and the mixed solution was centrifuged with a speed of 11000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 2 mL of toluene. PL spectra were collected when different amounts of acetone were added.
Synthesis of PS and cPS
PS was synthesized through polymerization of 2 mL styrene in 10 mL toluene using 0.03 g AIBN as initiator under an inert atmosphere. The reaction lasted for 5 h at 70 °C. The synthesis of the cPS was similar to that of PS except that 0.6 g sorbic acid was added.
Preparation of the g-CsPbBr3/cPS composite
The g-CsPbBr3 PQDs were synthesized by using 0.5 mL CTAB stock solution and 0.025 mL Cs-oleate solution. After purification, the solution of g-CsPbBr3 PQDs was mixed with 0.05 mL solution of cPS. A few minutes later, a certain amount of hexane was added until the solution turned turbid. The precipitate (g-CsPbBr3/cPS) was collected through centrifugation.
Fabrication of a WLED device
First, the K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor was encapsulated into the epoxy resin adhesive as a red emissive layer on a blue InGaN chip with an emission wavelength of 450 nm. Then, the g-CsPbBr3/PS composite was put on the top of the red emissive layer. The optical properties of the fabricated WLED was evaluated by a temperature programed LED optoelectronic analyzer with an integrating sphere spectroradiometer system (Everfine, ATA-500, Hangzhou, China). The WLED was operated under a voltage of 8.0 V and a current of 20 mA.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a JEOL JEM-2100 instrument operating at 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dropping the colloidal suspension onto a copper grid coated with a carbon film, followed by the evaporation of the solvent.
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.540 Å). The purified CsPbBr3 PQDs were redispersed in 100 μL toluene and then dropped on a 3 cm by 3 cm single-crystalline Si wafer followed by the evaporation of the solvent.
UV-vis absorption and diffuse reflection spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer (UV-3600 PLUS, Shimadzu Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were prepared by dropping the PQDs solution in 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes with airtight screw caps. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F4600, Hitachi Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) with a Xe lamp coupled to a monochromator. Samples were the same as those used for UV-vis absorption spectra measurements. They were excited at 365 nm at room temperature. Photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) were measured using an FLS980 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd, UK) with an integrating sphere. The PLQYs were measured under the excitation of 365 nm UV light. The PL decay kinetics were measured using the FLS980 spectrometer equipped with a 45 ps pulse blue laser (445 nm) at room temperature.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a PHI Quantum 2000 instrument (Ulvac-Phi, Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 FT-IR spectrometer (Waltham, USA). 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance II 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (Switzerland) and the solvent was CDCl3.
3 Results and discussion
Alkyl quaternary ammonium halides (QAHs) are well known to be cationic surface-active agents. For these molecules, the high polar nitrogen part usually makes them show poor solubility in nonpolar or weak polar solvents (e.g. toluene and 1-octadecene (ODE)) except for those with long and many hydrophobic carbon chains such as tetraoctylammonium bromide and dimethyl dioctadecylammonium bromide. This may be the reason why only a few quaternary ammonium halides have been used during the synthesis of CsPbBr3 PQDs as the common reaction solvents are toluene and ODE. To enable the use of more QAHs in synthesizing CsPbBr3 PQDs, a solvent with a slightly higher polarity is needed. Here, we introduce chloroform as the reaction solvent and a series of CsPbBr3 PQDs can be prepared using a variety of QAHs. This paper mainly focuses on the reaction system where CTAB is used as a Br source.

Fig. 1a shows the luminescence properties of the synthesized CsPbBr3 PQDs. The CsPbBr3 PQDs appear as a transparent solution and emit a bright cyan color under 365 nm excitation. The PL spectrum presents an emission band with the peak maximum at 490 nm and a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 39 nm. Compared to that of the bulk CsPbBr3 (534 nm),30 the emission spectrum is blue-shifted by ∼44 nm, which is caused by the strong quantum confinement effect. In addition, the emission spectrum shows an asymmetric band with the high-energy side being a little bit broader and two exciton absorption peaks located at 444 nm and 468 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectrum can be observed, which indicates an inhomogeneous particle size distribution.

As seen in Fig. 1b, the peak splitting at ∼30° in the XRD pattern indicates that CsPbBr3 PQDs have an orthorhombic structure, consistent with the bulk CsPbBr3.31 CsPbBr3 PQDs display a near-spherical shape with a mean size of ∼3.2 nm (Fig. 2a and b), which is smaller than the exciton Bohr diameter (∼7.0 nm) of the perovskite CsPbBr3. The size distribution is relatively broad (the standard deviation is 0.8 nm). The HRTEM image of a selected particle is shown in Fig. 2c, along with the corresponding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) image of the same region shown in Fig. 2d. The selected CsPbBr3 nanoparticle shows clear lattice fringes, indicating that it is a single crystal. The interplanar distances of 2.08 and 2.05 Å correspond to the (224) and (400) crystal faces, respectively. The angle between them is about 60°, which is consistent with the structure identified by XRD.

The surface state of CsPbBr3 PQDs was explored using both FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3a, the peak at 1542 cm−1 corresponds to the CO symmetric stretching vibration of the deprotonated carboxylate group (OA).25 The peaks at 960 and 907 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching modes of C–N+ of CTAB,32 but they are very weak, which is probably caused by the low content of CTAB. The 1H NMR spectra are presented in Fig. 3b. Resonances a′ and b′ of CTAB are not found, but resonance a of OA exists. These results also suggest that the amount of CTAB absorbed on the PQDs surface is very low.

Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to probe the chemical composition and structure of CsPbBr3 PQDs. As shown in Fig. 4a, the elements Cs, Pb, and Br can be seen, and the presence of elemental O is probably related to the chemisorbed OA, which serves as a surface ligand. To obtain deeper insights into the surface and inner compositions of PQDs, it is necessary to obtain high-resolution Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d chemical states before and after etching. After etching by 2 nm, a slight shift toward high binding energy (BE) occurs for Cs 3d peaks (Fig. 4b), which indicates the weak interactions of Cs with Br ions either on the surface or in the crystal lattice. After the fitting of the Pb 4f peaks, the peaks located at ∼143 and ∼138.5 eV can be attributed to the inner Pb atoms of PQDs, while the shoulder peaks located at 141–142 and 136–137 eV correspond to the surface Pb atoms (Fig. 4c). The proportion of surface Pb ions in unetched CsPbBr3 PQDs can be calculated to be about 0.26 based on the ratio of the integral area, which is a relatively high value and indicates a Pb-rich surface. As to Br ions, the 3d peak can be fitted into two sub-peaks at binding energies of 68.5 and 69.7 eV after etching, which correspond to the inner and surface Br ions, respectively (Fig. 4d). However, before etching, the absence of a high energy shoulder of Br 3d indicates that there are almost no Br ions on the PQD surface, which is consistent with the Pb-rich surface.

Furthermore, the Br/Pb ratio of CsPbBr3 PQDs at different etching depths is presented in Fig. S1a.† Before etching, the Br/Pb ratio of the CsPbBr3 PQDs is 0.72, which is much smaller than the normal ratio of 3. The Br-deficiency is probably caused by the Pb-rich surface and the high surface-area-to-volume ratio of CsPbBr3 PQDs. In addition, Br vacancies caused by the low formation energy may be another important factor.33 After the first etching, the Br/Pb ratio increases up to ∼0.95 due to the partial removal of the Pb-rich surface, but it is still smaller than the normal value. Further etching does not increase but slightly decreases the Br/Pb ratio to 0.88. The low Br/Pb ratio after etching is attributed to the fact that there are unetched or partially etched PQDs in the detecting scale (3–10 nm) of the XPS instrument due to the small size (3.2 nm) of PQDs, as shown in the inset of Fig. S1a.† The energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) result in Fig. S1b† also confirms the Br-deficiency (the Br/Pb ratio is 1.05).
The stability of PQDs is vital for their practical applications. Considering that the purification of PQDs depends on weakly polar solvents as precipitants, high stability towards polar solvents is highly required. Here, the stability against weakly polar solvents was first evaluated by monitoring both the peak wavelength and PLQY upon the addition of acetone to CsPbBr3 PQDs in toluene. The degradation of PQDs is expressed by (i) the shift of the emission peak and (ii) the decline of PLQY. In Fig. 5a, when the volume ratio of acetone to toluene containing PQDs reaches 0.5, the emission peak of CsPbBr3 PQDs exhibits a negligible blue shift (∼1 nm) whereas it is blue-shifted by ∼3 nm for OLA-CsPbBr3 PQDs. Besides, the PLQY of CsPbBr3 PQDs decays more slowly than that of OLA-CsPbBr3 PQDs (Fig. 5b). This improved stability against acetone can be ascribed to the suppressed proton transfer between ligands. The photostability and thermal stability of CsPbBr3 PQDs were also investigated. Fig. 5c shows that under continuous irradiation with a 36 W UV (365 nm) lamp, the relative PLQY of the CsPbBr3 PQDs film increases at first and then decreases rapidly during 80 min, but is still higher than that of the OLA-CsPbBr3 PQDs film. With regard to the thermal stability, the relative PLQYs after different heat-treatment times at 100 °C were collected and the result is presented in Fig. 5d. Compared to the OLA-CsPbBr3 PQDs film, the CsPbBr3 PQDs films have a slightly slower drop of relative PLQYs within 9 min, but after 15 min, both of them almost completely lose their PL. These results indicate that the photostability and thermal stability of CsPbBr3 PQDs synthesized using CTAB are improved to a certain extent.

(b) Relative PLQYs of CsPbBr3 and OLA-CsPbBr3 PQDs at different acetone/toluene volume ratios. Relative PLQYs of CsPbBr3 and OLA-CsPbBr3 PQDs films after different irradiation times with a 36 W (365 nm) UV lamp (c) and after different heat-treatment times at 100 °C (d). 
The effects of the amounts of Cs-oleate and CTAB on the photoluminescence properties of CsPbBr3 PQDs were studied. The PL spectra are generally blue-shifted from 520 to 478 nm on increasing the amount of Cs-oleate from 1.2 to 19.0 μmol (Fig. S2a and b†). The maximum PL intensity is obtained when 2.9 μmol of Cs-oleate is used, which is thus fixed in the following experiments to determine the optimal amount of CTAB. By increasing the amount of CTAB from 16.4 to 38.4 μmol, the PL wavelength nearly does not change, but the PLQY reaches a maximum of 71% when the amount of CTAB is 27.4 μmol (Fig. S2c†). The time-resolved PL decay spectra of CsPbBr3 PQDs synthesized under different conditions are shown in Fig. S2d and Fig. S2e.† The PL decay curve could be fitted well with a triexponential function. The fitted lifetime values of τ1, τ2, and τ3 are 0.2–2.2, 5.1–18.5 and 23–47 ns (Table S1†), corresponding to the intrinsic exciton relaxation, the interaction between excitons and phonons, and the interaction between excitons and defects, respectively.34 The average lifetime (τave) was also calculated to be 17–33 ns.
The emission wavelength of PQDs could also be tuned by a simple anion post-exchange reaction. Upon the addition of tetrabutylammonium iodide to the solution of CsPbBr3 PQDs, a continuous red shift of the PL spectra is observed, indicating that Br ions in CsPbBr3 PQDs are gradually replaced by iodine ions, as shown in Fig. 6a. The emission peak wavelength can be tuned from 495 to 660 nm. The FWHM of CsPbBr3−xIx (0 ≤ x < 3) PQDs spans from 30 to 60 nm and their PLQYs are 60–75%.

(c)–(d) PL spectra and UV-vis absorption spectra of CsPbBr3 PQDs synthesized using different carboxylic acids and quaternary ammonium bromide compounds. The insets in (a), (c) and (d) show photographs of the corresponding PQDs under ambient light (left) and excitation of 365 nm UV light (right). 
To extend this method, other carboxylic acids and quaternary ammonium bromide compounds, especially those with short carbon chains, which is beneficial for better carrier transportation in solar cells and light-emitting diodes, were used to synthesize CsPbBr3 PQDs. Fig. 6b presents the molecular structures of some ligands. The bright green or cyan light in the insets of Fig. 6c and d suggest the successful preparation of CsPbBr3 PQDs based on these ligands. For most of these PQDs, the emission peak is between 521 and 525 nm and the FWHM is ∼20 nm. Such pure and ideal green is beneficial for developing future display technologies with a wide color gamut. Moreover, because butyric acid and tetraethylammonium bromide used here have a relatively short and fewer carbon chain, other similar compounds with a longer carbon chain can also be effective due to their favorable solubility in chloroform.
For their application in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), CsPbBr3 PQDs are generally composited with hydrophobic polymers to promote their water-resistance. Polystyrene (PS) is usually selected as a packaging material due to its high hydrophobicity. However, most of these composites are realized based on the physical interaction between PQDs and PS.15,16,35–37 This weak interaction can lead to phase separation. Here, a polymer of carboxyl-functionalized polystyrene (cPS) was selected based on its potential chemical bonding to CsPbBr3 PQDs. In the following part, CsPbBr3 PQDs with a peak wavelength of 515 nm (g-CsPbBr3) are selected to combine with cPS due to their high PLQY and emission of the desirable green color.
cPS was synthesized by copolymerization of two monomer species (styrene and sorbic acid) and its structure was characterized by FTIR. As shown in Fig. S3,† in addition to the typical peaks of PS, a relatively strong adsorption peak appears at 1707 cm−1 for cPS, which is attributed to the stretching of the carboxyl groups. It confirms that cPS is modified with carboxyl groups successfully. Subsequently, a certain amount of toluene containing cPS was mixed with PQDs and enough hexane was added into the above solution. Then, a yellow precipitate appears at the bottom of the tube, which emits a green color under 395 nm excitation (Fig. 7a). In contrast, when cPS is replaced with PS, a nearly colorless precipitate forms and the supernatant is still yellow-green (Fig. 7a). The difference clearly implies that cPS can form stronger interactions with CsPbBr3 PQDs through chemical bonds.

(b) PL spectra and (c) absorption and diffuse reflection spectra of the g-CsPbBr3 PQDs, the g-CsPbBr3/cPS film, and g-CsPbBr3/cPS re-dispersed in chloroform. The insets in (b) show photographs of g-CsPbBr3 PQDs and the g-CsPbBr3/cPS film under ambient light (left) and under excitation of 395 nm UV light (right). 
The XRD pattern of the g-CsPbBr3/cPS composite exhibits a broad peak at 2θ = 15–28° corresponding to the amorphous cPS, as well as some weak peaks at 30.4, 34.2, 37.9 and 43.8° assigned to g-CsPbBr3 PQDs (Fig. S4†), indicating that g-CsPbBr3 PQDs are incorporated into the cPS matrix successfully. The PL spectrum of the g-CsPbBr3/cPS film in Fig. 7b red-shifts compared to that of g-CsPbBr3 PQDs, which is mainly attributed to the aggregation effect. Because when the g-CsPbBr3/cPS film is re-dissolved in toluene, the PL spectrum is almost recovered and is quite similar to that of g-CsPbBr3 PQDs. But the red-shift of the onset of the diffuse reflection spectrum of the g-CsPbBr3/cPS and the appearance of the absorption tail of re-dispersed g-CsPbBr3/cPS in Fig. 7c suggest that some larger particles are formed.
The morphology and size of g-CsPbBr3 PQDs before and after being coated were observed by TEM. As shown in Fig. 8a, the uncoated g-CsPbBr3 PQDs exhibit a cubic morphology with a particle size of 18 ± 2 nm. After being coated, the morphology and size did not undergo obvious changes: near-cubic morphologies can be clearly seen in Fig. 8b and the size is about 18 nm. The corresponding HRTEM image in Fig. 8c shows a clear lattice spacing of 0.31 nm, which corresponds to the (122) plane of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3. Besides, the distribution of g-CsPbBr3 PQDs in the cPS matrix is relatively uniform (Fig. 8b), which is probably due to chemisorption. The reliability of the g-CsPbBr3/cPS composite is evaluated in terms of thermal and moisture stabilities, as shown in Fig. 8d and e. Compared to g-CsPbBr3 PQDs, g-CsPbBr3/cPS shows a slower decline in PL intensity when the temperature increases from 25 to 105 °C; when the composite is immersed in water for 5 h, its emission intensity decreases only by 8%, whereas that of g-CsPbBr3 PQDs decreases by 60%. These results imply that the composite has an improved thermal stability and water-resistance.

By combining the g-CsPbBr3/cPS composite with a red-emitting K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor and a blue InGaN LED chip, a WLED was fabricated (Fig. 9a). The inset of Fig. 9a shows a photograph of the WLED. The CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperature (CCT) of this WLED are (0.30, 0.31) and 7219 K, respectively. The luminous efficacy is relatively low (8.1 lm W−1), which needs further improvement in the future. The color gamut of this WLED is about 130% of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard (Fig. 9b). Such a wide color gamut is highly necessary for next-generation displays. These results indicate the great potential for application of the g-CsPbBr3/cPS composite in WLED backlights.

4 Conclusions
We successfully utilized CTAB as a Br source to synthesize highly stable CsPbBr3 PQDs in chloroform at room temperature that are suitable for application in large color-gamut WLED backlights. The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental results.
(1) The emission wavelengths can be tuned in the range of 478–520 nm through adjusting the contents of Cs-oleate and CTAB precursors, and the maximum PLQY is 71%.
(2) The stability against acetone of CsPbBr3 PQDs synthesized using CTAB is improved compared with that of their counterparts synthesized using OLA. This result confirms the importance of suppressed proton transfer between ligands in improving the stability of PQDs.
(3) The green-emitting CsPbBr3 PQDs synthesized using CTAB can be further composited with carboxyl-functionalized polystyrene (cPS) due to chemical interactions. The composite shows enhanced thermal and moisture stability.
(4) Based on this composite, the red-emitting K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor and a blue InGaN chip, WLEDs with a color gamut as high as 130% NTSC can be achieved.
