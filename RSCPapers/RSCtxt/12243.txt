    AbstractIn this study we synthesized three low band-gap polymers—poly[2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-alt-2,5-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PQTT), poly[2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-alt-3,6-dipentadecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PQPDTT) and poly[2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-alt-2,5-bis(thieno-2-yl)-3,6-dipentadecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PQTPDTT)—that are based on quinoxaline and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, and examined their photovoltaic properties. The band-gaps of PQTT and PQTPDTT were 1.65eV and 1.7eV, respectively. For PQTPDTT, a HOMO level of −5.12eV, which was lower than that of P3HT, was observed. According to the analysis of the characteristics of the photovoltaic device using PC61BM and PC71BM as acceptors, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.71V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 8.80mA/cm2, a fill factor of 0.36 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.27% were observed at 100mW/cm2 (AM 1.5 illumination) when a PQTPDTT/PC71BM blend film was used as the active layer. A very high incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was detected (60% at 400nm, 57% at 500nm).
Introduction
π-Conjugated polymers have been drawing great attention recently due to their application to related fields (e.g. OTFT, OLED, etc.),1–4 their potential for fabricating low-cost integrated circuit elements for large areas and the feasibility of low-cost production using various methods such as spin coating, ink-jet printing and roll-to-roll through solution processes.5–11 Thanks to the ease of cell production and efficient charge separation, bulk heterojunction-type organic solar cells, which contain a conjugated polymer and a fullerene as donor and acceptor, respectively, have been most widely studied out of the various organic solar cells.12–17 In the beginning, the efficiency of organic solar cells was less than 1%. Since the adoption of fullerene as an acceptor, however, this figure has increased greatly. Due to a sharp advance in the field, devices reaching up to 5% in power conversion efficiency have recently been developed.18–21 However, to achieve a 7% or higher level of power conversion efficiency, which is essential for the commercialization of organic solar cells, a variety of polymer materials that can overcome the existing limitations (stability, morphology, production techniques, etc.) must be developed.22–24
A high level (∼5%) of PCE has been reported in polymer-based organic solar cells that use a regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blend as the active layers.25,26 Despite excellent charge transfer and separation, however, the polymer-based donor P3HT cannot absorb a wide range of photovoltaic power due to a relatively broad band-gap (1.9eV) and may lose much energy because of high LUMO levels.27,28 As a result, it appears that the band-gap of bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells is optimum at 1.3–1.5eV with a LUMO level of 3.8eV, which is higher than that of an acceptor by 0.3–0.5eV.29–33
For the synthesis of lower band-gap polymers, many polymers have adopted an internal charge transfer between the electron-rich unit and the electron-deficient moiety.34–36 It is regarded as a promising method for producing low band-gap polymers via which photons can be absorbed in a wide range of photovoltaic power, since alternating donor–acceptor units lower the effective band-gap by orbital mixing.
In this study, we synthesized new donor–acceptor-type low band-gap polymers—poly[2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-alt-2,5-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PQTT), poly[2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-alt-3,6-dipentadecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PQPDTT) and poly[2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-alt-2,5-bis(thieno-2-yl)-3,6-dipentadecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PQTPDTT)—which contain quinoxaline (excellent electron-attraction unit) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, which has excellent planarity and abundant electrons. To improve the solubility of n-type materials and stabilize the excitons that are produced in molecules by the resonance effect, in particular, hexyloxybenzene was utilized. Furthermore, pentadecyl (a long alkyl chain) was used to increase the solubility of the fused thiophene. Bulk heterojunction-type devices with PC61BM and PC71BM as acceptors were fabricated in order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of PQTT, PQPDTT and PQTPDTT. Devices using the synthesized polymers and PCBM-blend films as active layers displayed a 1–2% power conversion efficiency. In those devices that used a PQTPDTT/PC71BM blend film, in particular, a very high level of PCE (2.27%) was detected (VOC = 0.71V, JSC = 8.80mA/cm2, FF = 0.36). The process of the synthesis of monomers and polymers is shown in Scheme 1.

Results and discussion
To improve the solar absorption spectra and reduce the band-gap of polymers, thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene were used as electron donors and quinoxaline as an electron acceptor. Pentadecyl and hexyloxybenzene were attached to thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and quinoxaline respectively to increase solubility. Polymers were synthesized through a Stille coupling reaction, and low-molecular-weight materials were removed through reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction of the solid product with methanol, acetone and hexane. The synthesis of polymers was investigated using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and elemental analysis. The synthesized polymers displayed high solubility in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. Molecular weights were measured through GPC using THF as a solvent. According to these measurements, PQTT, PQPDTT and PQTPDTT had Mn values of 9800, 8668 and 14065, Mw values of 14600, 12041 and 26700, and PDIs of 1.44, 1.39 and 1.9, respectively.

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of polymers measured in the chloroform solution and in the film. For PQTT, the maximum absorption spectra were detected at 373nm and 597nm in solution and at 379nm and 598nm in the film. In contrast, the maximum absorption spectra were detected at 396nm and 540nm in solution and at 420nm and 600nm (about 60nm red-shifted) in the film for PQTPDTT. Similar results are often observed in polymers with an active inter-chain interaction. When compared to PQTT, PQTPDTT displayed greater 2D stacking in the film. Therefore, it appears that PQTPDTT is more effective than PQTT in shifting electrons and holes. Furthermore, PQTPDTT displayed better optical absorption within the range of 500–700nm, a range rich in photons, which means that PQTPDTT is more effective than PQTT in solar absorption with potential use as a polymer for organic solar cells. In terms of the optical band-gaps, which were measured through UV-vis absorption spectra, PQTT and PQTPDTT were 1.65eV and 1.7eV. For PQPDTT, however, the maximum absorption peaks were detected at 326nm, 397nm and 540nm (shoulder) in solution and there were no differences between the solution and the film. Furthermore, the UV-vis absorption spectra of PQPDTT were similar to those of quinoxaline derivatives. This indicates that there are no effective interactions between quinoxaline derivatives and fused thiophene derivatives. It is supposed to be caused by steric effects between long alkyl chains of quinoxaline derivatives and fused thiophenes.37 The optical band-gap, which was calculated from the absorption onset, of PQPDTT was 2.3eV.

Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms of synthesized polymers. According to the analysis, PQTT and PQTPDTT were found to have oxidation potentials of 1.08V and 1.25V and reduction potentials of −1.3V and −1.23V. However, the oxidation and reduction potentials of PQPDTT were not clear. In contrast, the oxidation and reduction onset potentials of PQTT, PQPDTT and PQTPDTT were 0.52V, 1.21V and 0.68V, and −0.83V, −0.91V and −0.76V, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the HOMO and LUMO levels were −4.96eV and −3.61eV for PQTT, −5.6eV and −3.53eV for PQPDTT and −5.12eV and −3.68eV for PQTPDTT, respectively. Electrochemical band-gaps (which show the difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels) of 1.35eV (PQTT), 2.07eV (PQPDTT) and 1.44eV (PQTPDTT) were observed. Although all the polymers showed a small band-gap for the absorption of a wide range of photons, a high HOMO level was detected in PQTT, which implies poor oxidative stability due to a high HOMO level of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (in polymers, an electron donor). Although the overall HOMO and LUMO energy levels decreased with the inclusion of an electron acceptor, the decrease in HOMO levels was not as great as the decrease in LUMO levels.38 Conversely, compared to P3HT, PQTPDTT displayed excellent oxidative stability with a HOMO level of −5.12eV. Furthermore, a decrease in the LUMO level by intra-molecular interaction would be expected to improve the energy conversion efficiency by reducing energy loss.

The morphologies of the PCBM/polymer blend films were examined using AFM. The RMS thicknesses of PQTT/PC61BM and PQTT/PC71BM blend films (Fig. 3a and d) were relatively durable at 11.33nm and 25.45nm, respectively. It was also found that polymer/PCBM films were poorly formed due to a local aggregation of PCBM. Conversely, the RMS thicknesses of PQPDTT/PC61BM and PQPDTT/PC71BM blend films (Fig. 3b and e) were 3.5nm and 3.4nm, and those of PQTPDTT/PC61BM and PQTPDTT/PC71BM blend films (Fig. 3c and f) were 3nm and 2.8nm. When compared to the film using PQTT as a donor, therefore, a far smoother morphology was observed. Although the channels of polymers and PCBM were not completely formed, charge transfer was smooth as the PCBM channels were, for the most part, well formed. It therefore appears that relatively good film properties were detected.39 The optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 4 visually demonstrates the IPCE of polymer/PCBM bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices. In terms of IPCE, a clear difference was observed between the polymer/PCBM films depending on type. As shown in Fig. 4, PQTT/PC61BM and PQTPDTT/PC61BM films exhibited IPCE values of 27% and 45% at 400nm and 7–17% and 3–28% at 500nm–700nm, respectively. PQTT/PC71BM and PQTPDTT/PC71BM films also displayed high IPCEs at 400nm (35% and 60%). In contrast to the use of PC61BM, high IPCE was observed at 500nm as well (33% and 57%). Although a decrease was detected at 500–700nm as with the introduction of PC61BM, the IPCE almost doubled. This kind of change at 500nm occurred because the number of photons increased due to solar absorption by PC71BM.40 In comparison with PQTT and PQTPDTT, PQPDTT/PCBM films showed low IPCE values. This stems from poor absorption propertyies in the visible range of the spectrum.

Fig. 5 illustrates the I–V properties of fabricated devices. The thicknesses of active layers were adjusted with different spin coating conditions, and the devices were thermally treated at 120 °C before the LiF/Al electrodes were deposited thereon. The I–V curves of the organic solar cells show pronounced kinks. The peculiarity in the production of this device was the extremely fast evaporation rate of the top electrode. One might assume that there is some problem with the electrical properties of the top electrode. It would be one of factors which would substantially reduce the fill factor and therefore the photovoltaic performance.41,42 As shown in Fig. 5, PQTT, PQPDTT and PQTPDTT exhibited VOC of 0.61V, 0.36V and 0.7V, and JSC values of 4.12mA/cm2, 1.37mA/cm2 and 4.63mA/cm2, respectively, when PC61BM was used as an acceptor. When PC71BM was used, on the other hand, 0.69V, 0.37V and 0.71V VOC, and 5.29mA/cm2, 2.6mA/cm2 and 8.8mA/cm2 JSC were observed. While no difference was detected in VOC, there was a substantial difference in JSC in both PQTT and PQTPDTT. This difference can be explained in terms of the results of IPCE in Fig. 4. In the case of PQTPDTT, in particular, a larger difference was observed in JSC depending on the type of acceptor because IPCE was high even at 500–700nm. In terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE), the devices that used PQTT/PC61BM, PQPDTT/PC61BM and PQTPDTT/PC61BM as active layers exhibited values of 0.84%, 0.16% and 1.28% while the devices that used PQTT/PC71BM, PQPDTT/PC71BM and PQTPDTT/PC71BM as active layers gave values of 1.39%, 0.3% and 2.27%, respectively. The photovoltaic properties of the devices are summarized in Table 2.

 Fig. 5  Comparison of photovoltaic properties of the polymers. 
Although VOC and JSC were high, complete efficiency was controlled by low fill factors. Low fill factors were apparently caused by poor morphology as in the results of AFM (Fig. 3). It appears that charge dissociation by poor morphology, decline in charge carrier transport and recombination of the electrons and holes would reduce fill factors. The morphology of a polymer/PCBM blend film could be improved by using various solvents at spin coating, changing the annealing temperature and adding various additives for better morphology. Due to the expansion of FF after the improved morphology, the properties of polymers could be greatly improved.

Instruments

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were performed in a Brüker ARX 400 spectrometer using solutions in CDCl3 and chemical shifts were recorded in ppm units with TMS as the internal standard. Elemental analyses were measured with EA1112 in a CE Instrument. The UV-vis spectra were measured with a HP Agilent 8453 UV-Vis. All GPC analyses were made using THF as eluent and polystyrene standard as reference. Cyclic voltammetric waves were produced by using a Wonatech WMPG 1000 with a 0.1 M acetonitrile (substituted a nitrogen in 20 min) solution containing tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4, Fluka 99.9%) at constant scan rate of 50 mV/s. A three-electrode cell was used and silver/silver chloride [Ag in 0.1M KCl] was used as a reference electrode. The luminance of devices was measured with a Spectra Scan PR-670. Current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of all polymer photovoltaic cells were measured under the illumination of simulated solar light with 100 mW/cm2 (AM 1.5 G) from an Oriel 1000W solar simulator. Electric data were recorded using a Keithley 236 source-measure unit and all characterizations were carried out in the ambient atmosphere. The illumination intensity used was calibrated by a standard Si photodiode detector from Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength from 360 to 800 nm (PV measurement Inc.) equipped with a halogen lamp as a light source, and calibration was performed using a silicon reference photodiode. Thicknesses of the thin films were measured using a KLA Tencor Alpha-step 500 surface profilometer with an accuracy of 1 nm.
Photovoltaic device fabrication
Composite solutions with polymers and PCBM were prepared using 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The concentration was controlled adequately in the range 1.0–2.0 wt%. For the measurement of optical absorption spectra of PCBM, the solutions were spun on pre-cleaned UV-grade silica substrates.
The polymer photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a typical sandwich structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned through a routine cleaning procedure, including sonication in detergent followed by distilled water, acetone, and 2-propanol. A 45 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P) was spin coated on a cleaned ITO substrate after exposing the ITO surface to ozone for 10 min. The PEDOT:PSS layer was baked on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 min. The active layer was spin-coated from the pre-dissolved composite solution after filtering through 0.45 µm PP syringe filters. The device structure was completed by depositing a 200 nm Al cathode as the top electrode onto the polymer active layer under 3 × 10−6 torr vacuum in a thermal evaporator.
Conclusions
In this paper, quinoxaline-based poly[2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-alt-2,5-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PQTT), poly[2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-alt-3,6-dipentadecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PQPDTT) and poly[2,3-bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-alt-2,5-bis(thieno-2-yl)-3,6-dipentadecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PQTPDTT) were successfully synthesized. PQTT and PQTPDTT showed low optical band-gaps of 1.65eV and 1.7eV. PQTPDTT, in particular, showed a greater solar absorption at 500–700nm, in which photons were abundant. However, PQPDTT had a comparatively high band-gap (2.3eV) and poor absorption spectra, because of an ineffective intramolecular interaction caused by steric effects between long alkyl chains of quinoxaline derivatives and fused thiophenes. In contrast to good morphology properties, it hindered PQPDTT to have a good photovoltaic properties. The device that used a PQTT/PC71BM blend film as an active layer had a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.39% (VOC = 0.69V, JSC = 5.29mA/cm2, FF = 0.38) while the device that contained a PQTPDTT/PC71BM blend film as an active layer reached up to 2.27% (VOC = 0.71V, JSC = 8.80mA/cm2, FF = 0.36). Furthermore, according to the IPCE analysis, PQTPDTT had very high IPCE at 400nm (60%) and 500nm (57%). Therefore, it appears that PQTPDTT, which has excellent solar absorption and conversion properties, would have a better rate of PCE if studies on the improvement of morphology are continued to enhance the fill factor (FF).
