Catalyst materials for the counter electrode of DSSCs have been synthesized by impregnating different concentrations of nickel (Ni) into CNTs. According to Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, the maximum surface area of Ni/CNT catalysts has been obtained at 3% loading of Ni. The surface morphology and presence of the Ni catalyst over the CNT support have been examined with the help of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of reduced Ni/CNT catalysts. The presence of different phases and crystal structures of reduced Ni/CNT catalysts has been investigated through X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. The catalytic activity of Ni/CNT catalysts has been investigated by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Tafel polarization analyses. The CV results demonstrate that Ni/CNT materials exhibit an outstanding electrochemical activity in DSSCs. The DSSC fabricated under optimal conditions exhibits a power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) of 9.72%, which is greater than that of a Pt-based DSSC (8.85%). These results demonstrate that the Ni/CNT material is a promising substitute for the costly Pt CE for low-cost DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Solar energy is a renewable source of energy and abundantly available on the surface of the earth. Photovoltaic technology is considered a major driver for achieving exigent energy targets.1,2 The photovoltaic cell directly converts solar energy into electricity. There are two main classes of photovoltaic cells: (i) inorganic or silicon (Si) solar cells and (ii) organic solar cells. The inorganic or Si solar cells are still dominant in the photovoltaic market owing to their high efficiency of 15–20% and long lifetime.3,4 However, their rigidity, energy-intensive processing, need for highly pure Si, and reduction in efficiency at elevated temperatures are the main problems in Si-based solar cells.5 Therefore, solar cells based on organic materials have also been developed. Among them, DSSCs are famous because of their stability and easy processing compared to other organic solar cells (perovskite solar cells).6 They can even produce electrical energy in diffuse sunlight and cloudy environments, where other photovoltaic solar cells fail to work.7
A DSSC consists of a photoanode (PE), counter-electrode (CE), and charge transport mediator or electrolyte.8,9 The dye absorbs sunlight and becomes excited. The excited electrons then move towards the conduction band of the semiconductor. The electrolyte, which is in contact with the photoanode, supplies electrons to the photosensitizer to reinstate its initial state. The oxidized electrolyte then diffuses towards the CE where the reduction reaction occurs.2,10,11 The photovoltaic efficiency of DSSCs has improved from 7% to ∼14%12 but it is still not comparable with that of Si solar cells. Low efficiency is the major barrier in the commercialization of DSSCs. The overall PCE of DSSCs depends on many factors, but the electrochemical reaction between the iodide/tri-iodide couple and external electrons at the CE plays a major role in boosting the PCE of DSSCs.13–15 The rate of this reduction reaction depends on the catalytic activity of materials.
Noble platinum (Pt) is generally considered a superior catalyst material for the reduction of iodide/tri-iodide ions at the CE of DSSCs.16 However, there are some major problems in using Pt as a CE:17 (i) it is expensive; (ii) it has low abundance; (iii) it is deteriorated by the iodine-based electrolyte; (iv) it is not effective for Co3+/Co2+, T2/T−, and polysulfide electrolytes. These drawbacks limit the commercialization of DSSCs. Therefore, low-cost and efficient catalyst materials are highly desired for the commercialization of DSSCs. Carbon allotropes could be the best alternate owing to their good electrochemical properties, chemical resistance against electrolytes, porous structure, and high surface area.3 The prominent carbon allotropes are graphite, carbon black, activated carbon, CNTs, graphene, and fullerene.18 Very few reports are available on CNTs as the counter-electrode (CE) of DSSCs.19 In this work, emphasis will be placed on the replacement of Pt materials with CNT-based materials.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess a 1-D cylindrical structure20 and can be classified into single-walled CNTs (0.8–2 nm) and multi-walled CNTs (5–20 nm). Their length (from 100 nm to a few centimeters) and aspect ratio (132000000:1) are extremely high.21 Owing to the high aspect ratio, CNTs show exceptional strength and stiffness. Instead of good physical properties, CNTs also possess good electrical and thermal properties.22,23 These features make CNTs an efficient catalyst for the reduction reaction. Suzuki et al.24 employed SWCNTs as a catalyst material and achieved an efficiency of 4.6%, which was analogous to that of Pt-based devices fabricated in a similar environment. CNT fibers were prepared by Peng et al.25 for application as the CE of DSSCs. They obtained an overall PCE of 7.33% for a fiber length of 60 μm and this performance was better than that of the Pt-based device (2.06%). Shin et al.26 prepared a highly conductive CNT-PEDOT core–shell by emulsion polymerization and utilized this material as a CE of a DSSC. They attained a PCE of 4.62% only. Lin et al.27 vertically grew CNTs on conductive glass substrates via the contact transfer method. They obtained an efficiency of 5.25% by utilizing this substrate as a CE. Nam et al.28 achieved a PCE of 8.03% by applying screen-printed CNTs on a conductive glass substrate.
In this work, nickel-metal was impregnated into CNTs to further improve the catalytic properties of CNTs. DSSCs based on Ni/CNTs exhibited a marvelous photovoltaic performance. To the best of our knowledge, we did not find any publication on Ni impregnated CNT (Ni/CNT) catalysts for the CE of DSSCs. Thus, this study could be one more step towards the commercialization of DSSCs.
2. Experimentation and characterization
2.1. Materials
Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and ethanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, USA. 95% pure multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs or MWCNTs) having a 1 to 10 μm length and an outside diameter of 10–20 nm were received from Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co. Ltd., China. All the chemicals were utilized without any modification.
2.2. Synthesis of catalysts
Various Ni/CNT catalysts were synthesized using the impregnation technique due to their potential application in dye-sensitized solar cells. Typically, 10 g of a 3% Ni/CNT catalyst was prepared by mixing 9.7 g of CNT in 500 ml of ethanol and sonicating for 1 h. Meanwhile, 1.49 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 50 ml of ethanol and stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 30 min to make a homogeneous solution of nickel salt. Then, this solution was added in the sonicated CNT and ethanol mixture. Then, it was stirred with a mechanical stirrer to achieve homogeneity of the mixture. Furthermore, the nickel, CNT and ethanol mixture was sonicated again for 1 h to achieve proper dispersion of CNTs and nickel in ethanol. Subsequently, this mixture was put in the oven at 80 °C for 48 h to evaporate the ethanol from it. The dry synthesized sample was ground and put inside a muffle furnace at 350 °C for 6 h with a ramp of 4 °C min−1 for thermal treatment of the synthesized 3% Ni/CNT catalyst. Moreover, the calcined sample was placed in an H2 atmosphere for 6 h at 750 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to achieve the complete reduction of nickel in the same furnace. The reduced 3% Ni/CNT catalyst was then stored in an air tight sample jar and the performance of this catalyst was evaluated in dye-sensitized solar cell applications. All other Ni/CNT catalysts were synthesized by following the same procedure. In this context, Ni loading was varied on the basis of theoretical Ni wt% for each catalyst.
2.3. Characterization of catalysts
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the CNT support and reduced Ni/CNT catalysts were obtained using a Phillips PW 1830 diffractometer having a copper anode. Operating conditions (40 kV and 40 mA) were also maintained in a 0° to 80° 2θ range for 1 h. FESEM was performed with the help of a FESEM JEOL JSM-6700F machine. It was also coupled with EDX for the mapping of reduced Ni/CNT catalysts. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis was accomplished with a Micromeritics A2720 system. A H2-TPR test was performed from room temperature to 975 °C at a ramp of 10 °C min−1. A dilute hydrogen atmosphere was also maintained during the analysis with a flow rate of 20 ml min−1. BET analysis was conducted by using Micromeritics ASAP2020 apparatus.
2.4. Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
Materials used in the fabrication of DSSCs were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland. DSSC anodes were fabricated by tape-casting titanium oxide (TiO2) paste (T/SP 14451) on FTO glass substrates (7 Ω sq−1). These wet films were heated at 450 °C for 30 minutes to obtain dry film anodes. These dry films were dipped in a 0.5 mM solution of N3 dye (methanol solvent) for 24 h to obtain light sensitive photoanodes. A small amount of TiO2 paste was mixed with each Ni/CNT catalyst. The TiO2 paste acts as a binder. The tape-casting technique was used to deposit the paste on FTO glass substrates. These wet-films were heated in a glovebox at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain dry films. The photoanodes and counter-electrodes were joined together using super glue. To complete the assembly of the cell, an electrolyte (Iodolyte Z-50) was inserted between the two electrodes using a dropper. The Pt-based cell was prepared in a similar manner. A Pt based CE was prepared by tape-casting Pt paste on FTO glass and annealing at 450 °C for 15 minutes. The dummy cells for Tafel characterization were prepared in a similar way. The active area of each cell was 0.20 cm2.
Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Tafel, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were performed to probe the electrochemical activity and stability of CE materials. All these characterization techniques were conducted on a potentiostat (Bio-Logic, VMP3). IV-5 and QEX10 instruments were used to examine the photovoltaic characteristics and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of DSSCs. Both instruments were purchased from PV-Measurements Company, USA.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. PXRD analysis of Ni/CNT catalysts
The presence of different phases and crystal structures of the CNT support and reduced Ni/CNT catalysts was investigated through PXRD analysis (shown in Fig. 1). The presence of major peaks for the CNT support at 26.18° and 43.18° 2θ diffraction angles was associated with the tube-wall of CNT (002) and (100) planes, respectively. These sharp and narrow peaks demonstrated the high crystallinity of Ni/CNT catalysts. It was also observed that the 43.18° 2θ peak of CNTs disappeared at a high loading of Ni (3, 5 and 7%). On the other hand, the metallic Ni (111), Ni (200) and Ni (220) phases appeared at 2θ = 44.5°, 51.9° and 76.4°, respectively.29–31 The absence of NiO peaks revealed the complete reduction of the reduced Ni/CNT catalysts. The intensities of metallic Ni peaks for different reduced Ni/CNT catalysts also described the change in Ni loading.

3.2. FESEM and EDX characterization
The surface morphology and presence of the Ni catalyst over the CNT support were examined with the help of FESEM and EDX mapping of reduced Ni/CNT catalysts. Fig. 2(a–d) demonstrated the tubular geometry of reduced Ni/CNT catalysts and no observable damage was noticed in the morphology when changing the loading of the impregnated catalyst.31,32 The amount of the Ni catalyst was also increased by increasing the loading of the catalyst over the surface of the CNT support. Furthermore, the diameters of Ni/CNT catalysts ranged from 5 to 25 nm with an average particle size of 10 nm. The EDX maps of carbon and nickel for the 3% Ni/CNT catalyst are also shown in Fig. 2(e and f). They demonstrated that the distribution of the Ni catalyst over the CNT support was excellent and almost homogeneous.31

3.3. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) analysis
H2-TPR analysis was conducted to estimate the reducibility and interaction of nickel with the CNT support for calcined Ni/CNT catalysts. Three distinct peaks appeared during the H2-TPR analysis of Ni/CNT catalysts. Fig. 3 shows these reduction peaks located at 334.6, 477.4 and 738.9 °C for calcined Ni/CNT catalysts at different Ni loadings. The prepared catalysts consumed a significant amount of H2 between 250 °C and 600 °C and a very minute amount of hydrogen in the range of 720 °C to 750 °C. The first peak at 334.6 °C was associated with the reduction of low-temperature NiO species which described the weak interaction of nickel with the CNT support.33 The peaks at 477.4 and 738.9 °C were ascribed to the reduction of high-temperature NiO species. These NiO species were highly dispersed over the surface of the CNT support. Besides, interaction of these NiO species with the CNT support was strong as compared to that of the low-temperature NiO species.34 Subsequently, no further peak appeared up to 975 °C during H2-TPR analysis of synthesized catalysts which confirmed the complete reduction of calcined Ni/CNT catalysts.

3.4. BET analysis
The textural properties of the CNT support and reduced Ni/CNT catalysts were measured by BET analysis. Fig. 4 shows the linear N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the CNT support and 3% Ni/CNT catalyst. It can be observed that these isotherms bear excellent resemblance to the IUPAC type IV isotherm which illustrated the microporous properties of studied catalysts.29,35 Besides, they exhibited an H1-type hysteresis loop in the range of 0.8 to 0.99 P/P° for all studied materials. This hysteresis loop appeared due to sharp capillary condensation inside the pores of these catalysts. Furthermore, the H1-type hysteresis loop also confirmed the mesoporous characteristics of reduced Ni/CNT catalysts.29

Table 1 exhibits the BET surface area (SBET), BJH adsorption cumulative volume of pores (VBJH ads) and BJH desorption average pore width (dBJH des) of the CNT support and reduced Ni/CNT catalysts. It also describes the mesoporous characteristics of analyzed catalysts because the dBJH des of the pure CNT support, 1% Ni/CNT, 3% Ni/CNT, 5% Ni/CNT and 7% Ni/CNT was 19.54, 14.18, 6.95, 7.43 and 7.64, respectively. Besides, the BET surface area of reduced Ni/CNT catalysts increased upon increasing the nickel loading up to 3% over the surface of the CNT support. Consequently, 3% Ni/CNT showed the highest SBET with a value of 180.85 m2 g−1. On the other hand, the BET surface area started to decrease with a further increase in the catalyst loading (above 3%). Therefore, the BET results revealed the fact that an increase in the catalyst loading enhanced the active sites but blocked the pores of the CNT support beyond a threshold. In a nutshell, it can be predicted that 3% Ni loading was the optimum loading by adopting the synthesis procedure of the current paper for Ni/CNT catalysts.

3.5. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of Ni/CNT catalysts
The catalytic mechanism that occurs in the electrochemical system is investigated by an efficient method named cyclic voltammetry (CV). It is also used to examine the stability of a catalytic system or catalyst.
CV analysis of Ni/CNT nanocomposites was carried out in a 0.01 M solution of Iodolyte Z-50 (Iodolyte Z-50 in acetonitrile). A three-electrode system was used to perform CV analysis. The test was carried out in three-necked flask, where the CE (3% Ni/CNT), Ag/AgCl, and Pt were taken as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter/auxiliary electrode, respectively. Two peaks can be distinctively seen in Fig. 5a, according to the following equations:36 3I− → I3− + 2e−(1) 2I3− → I2 + 2e−(2)
 Fig. 5  (a) Cyclic voltammogram of 3% Ni/CNTs at a 40 mV s−1 scan rate and (b) CV curves of 3% Ni/CNTs at different scan rates. 
These equations explain the redox reaction of the electrolyte, in which electrons are transferred to the photo-oxidized dye due to oxidation of iodide (eqn (1)), and reduction of produced triiodide occurs at the counter electrode (eqn (2)). Fig. 5b shows that the various scan rates did not affect the shape of cyclic voltammograms, indicating the stability of 3% Ni/CNTs.
3.6. Photovoltaic (PV) characteristics
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs are illustrated in Fig. 6. The analogous photovoltaic parameters, for example, PCE (η), open-circuit voltage (Voc), Fill Factor (FF), and short circuit current density (Jsc), are listed in Table 2. The tabulated results showed that Pt-based DSSCs possessed a higher PCE compared to the CNT based CE DSSC. The superior PCE of the Pt device could be attributed to its higher catalytic activity compared to that of CNTs. The tabularized results also show that the impregnation of Ni into CNTs improves the catalytic activity of CNTs. The efficiency of DSSC increases with an increase of Ni loading. The order of increase of PCE is given as 3% Ni/CNTs > 1% Ni/CNTs > CNTs. The enhancement in PCE is directly related to the improvement in current density. As the Ni loading increases, the number of active sites also increases. These active sites increase the rate of the reduction reaction at the CE. Moreover, BET analysis (Table 1) illustrates that the surface area of the catalyst increases with the increase of Ni loading. Consequently, 3% Ni/CNT shows the highest SBET with a value of 180.85 m2 g−1. The greater the surface area of the catalyst, the higher the rate of reaction. Thus, the combined effect of active sites and surface area improves/increases the overall rate of the reduction reaction at the CE. The amelioration in the reduction rate at the CE improves the forward flow of electrons (minimizes the recombination), which in turn improves the current density of devices. However, Table 2 also shows that an increase in the loading of Ni greater than 3% reduces the PCE of devices. Therefore, BET analysis results also reveal the fact that an increase in the catalyst loading enhances the active sites but blocks the pores of the CNT support beyond a threshold. In a nutshell, it can be predicted that 3% Ni loading is the optimum loading that gives a maximum PCE of 9.72%. Cyclic voltammetry investigations in Fig. 5 also support these results. It can also be seen that the photovoltaic performance of the 3% Ni/CNT CE device is superior to that of the Pt-based DSSC (8.85%). Fig. 7 shows the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of DSSCs. The higher the IPCE, the greater the current density. Fig. 7 supports the current densities of DSSCs listed in Table 2. However, no significant change in Voc was observed.

3.7. EIS of DSSCs
EIS is used to study the interface resistance at CEs. Fig. 8 shows Nyquist plots of DSSCs fabricated using novel catalyst materials. They usually comprise three arcs. In Fig. 8, the first semicircle denotes the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the CE and electrolyte (R1). The charge transfer resistance at the interface of the electrolyte and photoanode (R2) is represented by the second arc. The third arc shows the diffusion of the redox-couple in the electrolyte (Zw). The magnitude of interface resistances is directly related to the diameter of semicircles.37 The interface resistances calculated from Fig. 8 are shown in Table 3. These results show that the Pt-based DSSC exhibits less interface resistance at the CE compared to the CNT based device. This may be owing to the comparatively high conductivity and electrochemical activity of Pt. These characteristics of Pt promote the fast reduction reaction and provide an efficient path for the transfer of electrons. However, R1 decreases with the impregnation of Ni on CNTs. Table 3 illustrates that 3% loading of Ni exhibits an R1 of 3.94 Ω, which is slightly higher than that of Pt (3.32 Ω). This may be attributed to the improved catalytic activity and conductivity of the catalytic system. A further increase of the loading of Ni negatively affects the electrochemical activity of the catalyst. As listed in Table 3, at 7% loading of Ni, the DSSC exhibits an R1 of 7.10 Ω, which is far higher than that of Pt and 3% Ni/CNT based devices. The increase in R1 could be attributed to an increase in the BET surface area of the catalyst (7% Ni/CNTs) as mentioned in Table 1, which does not promote the fast reduction reaction at the CE. The EIS results in Table 3 are in accordance with the PV performance of DSSCs (shown in Table 2). The higher the values of R1 the lower the Jsc. Thus, to obtain a higher value of Jsc or PCE, R1 should be lower.

However, the Pt-based DSSC possesses a higher R2 than Ni/CNT based devices. Pt paste remains stuck to the FTO substrate even under the influence of the electrolyte (Iodolyte Z-50, Solaronix). Owing to the good adhesion, Pt contents do not dissolve in the electrolyte, so the conductivity of the electrolyte remains the same. On the other hand, carbon allotropes possess good electrical conductivity, catalytic activity, and electrochemical stability, and are cheap; however, their adhesion with the FTO substrate is not as good as that of Pt.38–40 A small amount of the Ni/CNT catalyst may dissolve in the electrolyte and enhance the overall conductivity of the composite electrolyte.41 An increase in the conductivity of the electrolyte may increase the charge recombination rate between TiO2/dye and the electrolyte. Therefore, the Pt-based DSSC possesses a higher R2 compared to Ni/CNT based DSSCs.
3.8. Tafel test
A Tafel test was conducted to further probe the interfacial charge-transfer resistance of the redox couple at CEs.42 Tafel curves are plotted between the logarithmic current density (logJ) and potential required for the reduction of the redox couple. In theory, a Tafel curve consists of three zones. The polarization zone is denoted by the low potential curve, the Tafel zone is indicated by the intermediate region, and the diffusion zone is represented by the high potential horizontal region.43 Exchange current density (Jo) is the main parameter of Tafel curves. Jo can be obtained using the following equation:44 (3)where R, T, n, F and Rct represent the ideal gas constant, temperature, total number of electrons involved in the reduction reaction, and the interface charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode, respectively. Jo can also be obtained via the intercept of the extrapolated linear region of a curve at zero over-potential.
Tafel curves of dummy cells are shown in Fig. 9. According to slopes in Fig. 9, the order of increase of Jo is Pt > 3% Ni/CNTs > pure CNTs. The higher the Jo the greater the catalytic activity of catalysts. Thus, the 3% Ni/CNT catalyst exhibited a slightly lower Jo compared to Pt. Moreover, eqn (3) shows that Jo is inversely related to Rct or R1. Therefore, Pt exhibits a slightly high Jo compared to the 3% Ni/CNTs catalyst. These results further support the photovoltaic and EIS analyses of DSSCs as illustrated in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, different Ni/CNT catalysts were successfully synthesized using the impregnation technique. The contents of Ni were varied from 1% to 7%. XRD analysis confirmed the presence of different phases and crystal structures of reduced Ni/CNT catalysts. FESEM analysis showed the tubular geometry of reduced Ni/CNT catalysts and no observable damage was noticed in the morphology upon changing the loading of the impregnated catalyst. The BET surface area of the reduced Ni/CNT catalyst was increased by increasing the nickel loading up to 3% over the surface of the CNT support. Consequently, 3% Ni/CNT exhibited the highest SBET with a value of 180.85 m2 g−1. These catalysts were electrochemically stable and possessed high catalytic activity towards the reduction reaction taking place at the CEs. The catalytic activity of Ni/CNTs strongly depends on the Ni loading. The DSSC fabricated with 3% Ni/CNT showed a PCE of 9.72%, which was higher than that of the Pt-based DSSC (8.85%) fabricated under similar conditions. The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was further supported by EIS and Tafel analyses. These results suggest that the 3% Ni/CNT catalyst material could be considered promising alternative catalyst materials for Pt-free DSSCs.
