    , Accepted 11th September 2012First published on 12th September 2012AbstractQuaternary semiconductor Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) nanocrystals have been successfully synthesized via a simple and mild solvothermal method. Cu2FeSnS4 and Cu2CoSnS4 show a spherical shape; Cu2NiSnS4 and Cu2MnSnS4 possess a nail-like structure and a rod-like structure. The four types of nanocrystals exhibit significantly different magnetic properties. Cu2FeSnS4 and Cu2CoSnS4 nanoparticles show ferromagnetic behavior; Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2NiSnS4 nanorods exhibit superparamagnetic behavior at low temperature. The band gaps of Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Mn) nanocrystals are in the range of 1.2–1.5 eV, indicating a high potential application in low-cost thin film solar cells.
Introduction
Recently, earth abundant Cu2ZnSn(SeS)4 (CZTSeS) nanocrystals are being considered as ideal absorber materials for thin film solar cells1–10 because of a large absorption coefficient, a tunable direct band gap ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 eV, and high power conversion efficiency as high as 7.2% reported by Agrawal’s group.11 On the other hand, earth abundant Cu2(MII)(MIV)(S,Se)4 (MII = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Hg; MIV = Si, Ge, Sn) chalcogenide semiconductor nanocrystals have received great interest due to their analogous structures to CZTS(e), suitable direct band gaps, and high absorption coefficients,12 and quaternary Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) compounds are important potential solar cell materials.12 In addition, incorporating Co, Fe, Ni, and Mn magnetic ions into the Cu2SnS3 lattice may lead to magnetism and form the multifunctional Cu2MSnS4 (Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) compounds. To date, there are only a few reports on the synthesis of Cu2CoSnS4,13,14 Cu2FeSnS415,16 and Cu2MnSnS417 nanocrystals. However, these studies only focused on the optical properties of the nanocrystals,13–16 the study on magnetic property is still rare.17 As is known, Cu2MSnS4 (Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) compounds usually crystallize in a stannite (space group: I2m) or kesterite (space group: I) structure in the literature, and all of the metal ions have a fixed position.18–25 Thus, the magnetic ions (Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) do not have a random distribution in the stannite and kesterite unit cells, and these Cu2MSnS4 compounds usually exhibit anti-ferromagnetic behavior due to a large anti-ferromagnetic interaction between nearest–neighbor magnetic ions.18–25 In contrast, for standard zincblende and wurtzite structures, the metal ions have a random distribution, which may lead to some peculiar magnetic properties by controlling both metal distribution and metal–metal distance.23–25 Therefore, it is critically important to synthesize zincblende and wurtzite Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) nanocrystals. Recently, we successfully synthesized wurtzite Cu2CdSnS4 nanorods by a solvothermal method.26 Here, we extend this method to prepare semiconductor Cu2MSnS4 (Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) nanocrystals with zincblende and wurtzite structures. It is particularly worth mentioning that Cu2NiSnS4 and Cu2MnSnS4 nanocrystals show a nail-like and a rod-like structure. Note that only few stoichiometric quaternary semiconductor nanorods have been reported,26–28 and one-dimensional Cu2NiSnS4 and Cu2MnSnS4 nanorods are synthesized for the first time. These Cu2MSnS4 nanocrystals exhibit significantly different magnetic properties. Moreover, the Cu2MnSnS4 nanorod thin film displays excellent photoresponse behavior. The band gaps of these Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) nanocrystals are in the range of 1.2–1.5 eV, indicating that they are suitable photovoltaic materials.12
Experimental section
1. Chemicals
Copper monochloride (CuCl, AR), tin dichloride hydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, AR), manganese dichloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O, AR), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, AR), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, AR), iron chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O, AR), carbon disulfide (CS2, AR), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (HSCH2CH2CO2H, 98%), and hexylamine (CH3(CH2)5NH2, 99%) were purchased from Aladdin. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
2. Synthesis of Cu2CoSnS4, Cu2FeSnS4, Cu2NiSnS4, Cu2MnSnS4 nanocrystals
1.0 mmol CuCl, 0.5 mmol SnCl2·2H2O, and 0.5 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol FeCl2·4H2O, 0.5 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, or 0.5 mmol MnCl2·4H2O) were dissolved in 8.0 mL hexylamine by ultrasound in a 50 mL conical flask. 12.0 mL of hexylamine was loaded into another 50 mL conical flask. Next, 1.0 mL carbon disulfide and 1.0 mL 3-mercaptopropionic acid were slowly dropped into the conical flask in an ice-water bath. Subsequently, these two solutions were mixed, and 1.0 mL 3-mercaptopropionic acid was added into the solution. After stirring for 12 h, the solution was transferred into a 30 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and put into an oven at 180 °C for 2 h (for synthesis of Cu2MnSnS4, first solvothermal reaction at 160 or 140 °C for 20 min, then solvothermal reaction at 180 °C for 2 h). The autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature. Finally, the nanocrystals were isolated by precipitation with 30 mL methanol followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The purified nanocrystals were re-dispersed in chloroform for TEM and XRD measurements without any size selection.
3. Characterization
The powder XRD patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. The simulated XRD patterns of Cu2MSnS4 were obtained using Diamond 3.0 and CCDC Mercury 1.4.2 programs. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800) equipped with a Bruker AXS XFlash detector 4010. TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images were taken on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were measured by a metash UV-5200 spectrophotometer. The magnetic properties of Cu2MSnS4 nanocrystals were obtained by SQUID (MPMS-XL-7, Quantum Design, Ltd.) between 2 and 100 K using ZFC and FC procedures in an applied field of 50 Oe. The optoelectronic thin film was fabricated by spin-casting 2 mL of concentrated nanocrystal solution onto a glass slide (2 × 2 cm). The annealing process was conducted at 400 °C for 5 min in a glove-box under N2 atmosphere in order to remove ligands and solvent. Next, two Al electrodes were evaporated onto the surface of the thin film. Finally, current–voltage characteristics were tested using a Keithley 2400 source meter in the dark or under AM 1.5 G solar simulation (Abet Inc. Sun 2000) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Result and discussion

Fig. 1 displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Cu2CoSnS4 (CCTS), Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS), Cu2NiSnS4 (CNTS), and Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) nanocrystals with zincblende and wurtzite structures. It is found that our diffraction patterns match neither reported ones in the literature nor those of the standard JCPDS card database (stannite and kesterite phases).18–25 Therefore, we simulated zincblende XRD patterns for CCTS and CFTS as well as simulated wurtzite XRD patterns for CNTS and CMTS. As can be seen in Fig.1, experimental patterns match well with the simulated ones by comparison of experimental and simulated XRD peak positions in Tables S1–S4,† indicating that CCTS and CFTS nanocrystals possess a zincblende structure and CNTS and CMTS a wurtzite structure. The detailed crystal data of zincblende and wurtzite Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co, Fe, Ni, Mn) nanocrystals are listed in the ESI.† Fig. S1† shows the unit cells of zincblende (left) and wurtzite (right) Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+). The wurtzite CMTS and CNTS nanocrystals can be viewed as a deviation of wurtzite ZnS. In this structure, sulfur anions are hexagonally close packed, and all metal ions randomly occupy Zn2+ positions. Similarly, zincblende CCTS and CFTS nanocrystals can be considered as the deviation of zincblende ZnS. Note that no other impure phases such as stannite or kesterite structures are detected during the synthetic process, signifying pure zincblende and wurtzite structures are obtained. It should be noted that the (002) peak intensities of CNTS and CMTS nanocrystals are significantly stronger and narrower than those of standard wurtzite patterns, indicating that these two types of nanocrystals have a high aspect ratio.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the morphologies of Cu2MSnS4 nanocrystals. Under TEM observations (Fig. 2), CCTS and CFTS nanocrystals display a nearly spherical shape, and the average size of nanocrystals is 5.6 ± 1.4 nm and 7.5 ± 1.5 nm, respectively. Both CCTS and CFTS nanocrystals exhibit a narrow size distribution. In contrast, CNTS and CMTS nanocrystals show a nail-like structure and a rod-like structure, which are consistent with the results of XRD patterns. Note that the aspect ratio of CMTS nanorods is around 4.4 ((4.7 ± 1.4) × (20.7 ± 6) nm). Interestingly, the aspect ratio of CMTS nanorods can be further improved to 9.4 ((4.9 ± 1.5) × (46.0 ± 10)) by decreasing the nucleation temperature from 160 to 140 °C (Fig. 2m and n), because a low nucleation temperature will result in less critical nuclei, leaving the majority of the precursors for the growth of longer CMTS nanorods.29–32 Additionally, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) can further confirm that these Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) nanocrystals possess zincblende and wurtzite structures, which are different from those of traditional tetragonal stannite and kesterite. The SAED images in Fig. 2c, f, i and l clearly reveal that as-prepared CCTS and CFTS nanocrystals possess a zincblende structure; CNTS and CMTS nanocrystals have a wurtzite structure. Note that the SAED results of Cu2NiSnS4 and Cu2MnSnS4 (see Fig. 2i and l) also indicate that these nanocrystals have a high aspect ratio since the (002) planes of Cu2NiSnS4 and Cu2MnSnS4 have much greater brightness than the other planes.

The magnetic properties of Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) nanocrystals were investigated by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Fig. 3a shows zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) curves measured with a magnetic field of 50 Oe. For Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2NiSnS4 nanorods, their ZFC and FC curves are almost overlapped, indicating that there are no magnetic ordering transitions in the tested temperature regime (2–100 K). Note that these two types of nanorods exhibit superparamagnetic behavior at low temperature. Interestingly, Cu2MnSnS4 nanorods with different aspect ratios show similar magnetic behavior (Fig. S2†), although the magnetization value of rods with an aspect ratio of 9.4 is around three times that of rods with an aspect ratio of 4.4. Unlike Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2NiSnS4 nanorods, a clear separation between ZFC and FC curves for Cu2FeSnS4 and Cu2CoSnS4 nanocrystals is observed, confirming that they have ferromagnetic behavior at low temperature. However, the observed ferromagnetic behavior may arise from possible impurities, such as Co and Fe. The calculated blocking temperatures for Cu2FeSnS4 and Cu2CoSnS4 nanocrystals are 13.8 and 69.5 K, respectively.

The isothermal magnetization curves of Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) nanocrystals at 2 K are shown in Fig. 3b. The field-dependent magnetization for Cu2FeSnS4 and Cu2CoSnS4 nanocrystals displays hysteretic behavior and gives a coercive force (Hc) of 774.1 and 272.4 Oe (Fig. 3b inset), respectively. In addition, the hysteresis loops are not observed for Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2NiSnS4 nanorods, indicating that they have become superparamagnetic materials at 2 K, which is consistent with the results of ZFC and FC curves. It is noteworthy that Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2FeSnS4 with a stannite structure usually exhibit anti-ferromagnetic behavior with a Néel temperature (TN) of 6–8.8 K in the literature due to a large anti-ferromagnetic interaction between nearest–neighbor magnetic ions.18–25 For zincblende and wurtzite structures, all of the metal ions in the unit cells have a random distribution, which can weaken the anti-ferromagnetic interaction and lead to some peculiar magnetic properties compared to traditional stannite and kesterite structures.
To evaluate optical band gaps of Cu2MSnS4 nanocrystals, UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the as-synthesized CFTS, CCTS, CMTS, and CNTS nanocrystals in chloroform were tested. As shown in Fig. 4, CFTS, CCTS, CMTS, and CNTS nanocrystals show absorption onsets at about 1040, 994, 967, and 832 nm, corresponding to energy band gaps of 1.19, 1.25, 1.28, and 1.49 eV (Fig. S3†). Note that the optical band gaps of these four types of nanocrystals are in the range of 1.2–1.5 eV. In order to determine the chemical compositions of Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) nanocrystals, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was applied to analyze elemental compositions. As shown in Fig. S4,† the molar ratios of Cu/M/Sn/S are close to 2:1:1:4, which are consistent with stoichiometric compositions of Cu2MSnS4.

To investigate the optoelectronic properties of the as-synthesized wurtzite Cu2MnSnS4 nanorods, a thin film was fabricated by spin casting a concentrated chloroform nanocrystals' ink. The I–V curves, as shown in Fig. 5, for the Cu2MnSnS4 nanorod thin film, exhibit a photoresponse property. The Ilight/Idark ratio of Cu2MnSnS4 nanorod film is around 1.6, which is close to those of semiconductor nanocrystal films,33–35 indicating that Cu2MnSnS4 semiconductor nanocrystals have a high potential application in thin film solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, four types of Cu2MSnS4 (M = Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mn2+) nanocrystals with a novel zincblende and wurtzite structure have been successfully synthesized via a hexylamine-assisted solvothermal approach. Cu+, M2+, Sn4+ ions have a random distribution in the unit cells, which strongly influences the magnetic properties of the Cu2MSnS4 nanocrystals. Cu2FeSnS4 and Cu2CoSnS4 nanoparticles exhibit ferromagnetic behavior with a blocking temperature of 13.8 and 69.5 K; Cu2MnSnS4 and Cu2NiSnS4 nanorods exhibit superparamagnetic behavior at low temperature. Besides, these semiconductor nanocrystals have optical band gaps in the range of 1.2–1.5 eV, and Cu2MnSnS4 nanorod thin film exhibits a photoresponse behavior, indicating that these Cu2MSnS4 nanocrystals have a potential application in low cost thin film solar cells.
