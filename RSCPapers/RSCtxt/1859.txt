    , Accepted 21st August 2017First published on 23rd August 2017AbstractIn the present work, p-type skutterudites La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12 composite with n-type Fe3Si nanoprecipitate was fabricated via an in situ method. Both thermoelectric and mechanical properties of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si composites were thoroughly investigated. With the introduction of homogeneously dispersed nanosized Fe3Si in the matrix, the power factor is almost unchanged due to the counteraction between the decreased electrical conductivity and the significantly enhanced Seebeck coefficient. Simultaneously, the total thermal conductivity was decreased for samples with Fe3Si nanoprecipitate because of the reduced electronic thermal conductivity. As a result, a ZT value of about 1.2 at 700 K has been achieved for La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/0.1Fe3Si sample, whose ZT value was slightly enhanced in comparison with the Fe3Si-freeLa0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12 sample. Furthermore, the indentation fracture toughness of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/0.1Fe3Si was improved by nearly 30% compared to the Fe3Si-free skutterudites.
1. Introduction
As an environmentally friendly technology, thermoelectric (TE) material is attracting much attention in the field of power generation based on waste heat and solar energy.1–3 The performance of thermoelectric material is determined by the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT = α2σT/κ), where α is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and κ is the thermal conductivity (κ = κe + κL), consisting of the electronic thermal conductivity κe and the lattice thermal conductivity κL.4
According to the ‘phonon glass electron crystal’ concept, filled skutterudites are considered as one of the most promising middle temperature TE materials for power generation due to their potential thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity similar to that of glass and crystal, respectively.5–9 The crystal structure of skutterudites contains two large interstitial voids in a unit cell, where various atoms, such as those of rare earth elements and alkaline earth elements, can be filled to form filled skutterudites FyT4X12 (F is filling atom, such as that of a rare earth, alkaline earth, or alkaline metal. T is a transition metal of subgroup VIII, and X is a pnictogen).10 Recently, ZT value of 1.4 in double-filled and 1.7 in multiple-filled n-type skutterudites has been achieved,11–14 and the highest ZT value of about 1.3 for p-type filled skutterudites has also been obtained through advanced synthesis methods.14–18 Although the thermoelectric performance of p-type filled skutterudites is not as good as that of n-type,11,19,20ZT values are higher than 1.0, indicating that they are promising candidates for industrial applications in power generation.
For the practical application of thermoelectric materials, apart from its thermoelectric performance, its mechanical stability is an important factor.21–23 Thermoelectric modules often suffer from various mechanical and thermal loads,24 such as thermal stresses created during rapid temperature cycling and temperature gradient that exists in materials, as well as significant thermal mechanical stresses caused by the mismatch of thermal expansion of TE materials. It is reported that these mechanical and thermal stresses could induce cracking of the material and then further failure to devices.25 Therefore, improvement of both thermoelectric performance and mechanical properties of filled skutterudites are of great significance to develop efficient TE power generation devices for practical applications.
Fabricating the nanocomposites is considered an effective way to improve the mechanical properties in many TE materials systems and efforts have been also made to improve the mechanical properties for skutterudites nanocomposites, such as Co4Sb11.5Te0.5/TiN,26 CoSb2.875Te0.125/TiN,24 and CeFe4Sb12/carbon fiber.27 Generally, the presence of nanoparticles plays a major role in enhancing the strength and fracture toughness of TE materials. It is well known that suitable nanoparticles can reduce the lattice thermal conductivity with little deterioration of electrical properties, thereby enhancing the TE performance.1,28–32 However, the mechanical and thermoelectric properties would deteriorate if nanoparticles could not be distributed homogeneously in the matrix. Mechanical mixing has been the most popular method to prepare skutterudites nanocomposites in the past decade, for example, CoSb3/PbTe,33 CoSb3/ZnO,34 and Ba0.22Co4Sb12/TiO2.35 However, during the fabrication process, it is inevitable for nanoparticles to agglomerate due to their high specific surface energy. To obtain uniform distribution of nanoprecipitates in skutterudites, in situ precipitate is the first choice, for example, YbxCo4Sb12/Yb2O3,36 CoSb3/NiSb,37 In0.1Co4Sb12/InSb,38 InxCeyCo4Sb12/InSb39 and Yb0.26Co4Sb12/yGaSb.40 Among them, it should be noted that Xiong et al. prepared n-type filled skutterudite Yb0.26Co4Sb12 with p-type GaSb nanoprecipitate via an in situ method, which showed that p-type GaSb can improve the Seebeck coefficient and reduce the thermal conductivity, thereby enhancing TE performance.40
The n-type Fe3Si compound possesses excellent mechanical properties and electronic conductivity,41,42 which can improve the hardness and fracture toughness and may also increase the Seebeck coefficient and decrease the thermal conductivity of p-type La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12 skutterudite similar to that of p-type GaSb in Yb0.26Co4Sb12.40 Herein, the in situ method has been chosen to prepare La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si composite by adding elements Si and Fe in the p-type La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12 skutterudite reported previously.15 The results show that the Fe3Si precipitate is homogeneously distributed in the matrix, with a size of hundreds of nanometers. The sample with Fe3Si presents a higher Seebeck coefficient and lower thermal conductivity in comparison with the Fe3Si-free one, resulting in a slight enhancement of ZT value. Furthermore, we investigate the mechanical properties of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si composite. Due to the fact that skutterudites are considered as brittle materials, fracture toughness could only be estimated successfully using the indentation method.43 Moreover, in many thermoelectric material systems, for example, Bi2Te3,44 BiSbTe,45 Zn4Sb3,46 and MgAgSb,23 indentation method has been used to investigate their fracture toughness. Hence, in this work, we chose indentation method to test the indentation fracture toughness of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si composite. The results show that the indentation fracture toughness of the composite is also enhanced by Fe3Si nanoprecipitate.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation
La ingot (99.8%, Alfa Aesar), Sb balls (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), Ga ingot (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), Ti ingot (99.995%, Alfa Aesar), Fe ingot (99.99%, Alfa Aesar), Co ingot (99.95%, Alfa Aesar) and Si ingot (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) were prepared and weighted according to the chemical composition SixLa0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3(1+x)CoSb12 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15), loaded into carbon crucible, and sealed in quartz tubes under vacuum (<10−3 Pa). After slowly heating to 1423 K and maintaining for 4 h, the quartz tube was water quenched. Subsequently, the quenched ingots were pulverized into small bulks about 5 × 5 × 5 mm3 in size and placed in a quartz tube with a 0.5 mm diameter nozzle. To obtain ribbons, the small bulks were molten and injected under a 0.05 MPa pressure using high purity Ar onto a copper roller with a rotating speed of 50 ms−1. The obtained ribbons were pulverized in a glove box filled with high-purity Ar and then sintered into a pellet with a diameter of 13.5 mm by hot-pressing for 2 h at 923 K under a pressure of 90 MPa and vacuum below 6.7 × 10−3 Pa.
2.2 Sample characterization
The phase structure was analyzed by X-ray power diffraction (XRD) with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies and actual composition were analyzed using a Hitachi S4700 scanning electronic microscope (SEM) accompanied with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Hall coefficients at room temperature were measured in a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The microstructure was investigated using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Tecnai G2F30) and the TEM samples were prepared by conventional ion-sputtering method. Disks with diameters of 12.7 mm and 2 mm in thickness were used to measure thermal diffusivity and volume density. The thermal conductivity (κ) could be calculated using the relationship κ = D × Cp × d, where D is thermal diffusivity, Cp is specific heat and d is density. The thermal diffusivity was measured on a laser flash apparatus (Netzsch LFA 457). Cp was measured by DSC (Netzsch DSC 404). The density was measured by Archimedes method, and relative densities of all samples were higher than 96%. Bars with dimensions of 2 × 2 × 12 mm3 were used to measure the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of the system (ULVAC ZEM-3). The uncertainty for the electrical conductivity was 3%, the Seebeck coefficient 5%, and the thermal conductivity 7%; hence the combined uncertainty for the power factor was 13% and that for ZT value was 20%. Indentation fracture toughness analysis was carried out using Vickers's micro hardness tester (HVS-1000).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase and microstructure analysis

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patternsof La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) powder. As shown in Fig. 1a, XRD patterns of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12 sample present single skutterudite phase without any impurity peaks within the experimental detection limit. With the addition of Si, the XRD patterns of samples show an additional peak around 2θ = 45°, which corresponds to the (220) peak of Fe3Si (compared with PDF#45-1207) compound as shown in Fig. 2b. The intensity of this peak is enhanced with increasing Si content, indicating increased Fe3Si fraction.

Fig. 2 displays the fracture morphology for the La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si samples. As shown in Fig. 2a, the grains and grain boundaries are clean for the pristine sample. However, the precipitate marked by a red circle in Fig. 2c is homogeneous when Si is induced, and the fraction of the precipitate is increased with an increase in x as shown in Fig. 2b–d, which is consistent with the result of XRD.

Fig. 3a presents the bright field TEM image and the corresponding selected area diffraction (SAD) patterns of the La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/0.1Fe3Si. As shown in Fig. 3a, the grain boundaries of matrix are clean, and the precipitates are embedded in the grain. The precipitate size ranges from 50 to 200 nm. Fig. 3b and c show the SAD patterns obtained from the matrix and precipitate regions marked as A and B on the bright field image, respectively. The SAD pattern from area A in Fig. 3a is collected along the [001] direction and can be indexed into a body-centered cubic structure, which is considered as skutterudite phase, as shown in Fig. 3b. The SAD pattern from area B in Fig. 3a collected along the [111] direction reveals that the structure of precipitate is face-centered cubic and corresponds to Fe3Si phase, as shown in Fig. 3c. In order to further confirm the phase of the precipitate, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is used to measure the composition of the precipitate marked as B in Fig. 3a. As listed in Table 1, the EDS results indicate that the precipitate consists of Fe and Si, and the atomic ratio of Fe and Si is around 3. Therefore, it can be concluded that the precipitate inside the skutterudite matrix is Fe3Si. These nanosized precipitates will have an effect on the electrical and thermal transport properties, which will be discussed in the following section.

3.2 Thermoelectric properties

Fig. 4a shows the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity (σ) for La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15). The electrical conductivity is decreased with increasing content of Fe3Si nanoprecipitates in the entire temperature range. The electrical conductivity can be described as σ = neμH, where n is the carrier concentration and μH represents carrier mobility. Table 2 lists the carrier concentration and mobility as a function of Si content. With the Fe3Si content (x) increasing from 0 to 0.15, carrier concentration decreases, while carrier mobility increases. Therefore, the reduction of electrical conductivity can be attributed to the significantly decreased carrier concentration. In addition, the increased carrier mobility may be caused by weakened electron–electron scattering.47

Fig. 4b shows the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient (S) for La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si. The absolute Seebeck coefficients increase with rising temperature from 300 to 723 K. The value of S increases significantly when the Fe3Si content (x) increases from 0 to 0.1 in the composite. For degenerate semiconductors, the Seebeck coefficient can be written as eqn (1):1 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck constant, n is the carrier concentration and m* is the effective mass of the carrier. eqn (1) indicates that a lower carrier concentration leads to a higher value of Seebeck coefficient. As shown in Table 1, with the Fe3Si content (x) increasing from 0 to 0.1, the carrier concentration decreases, mainly leading to an enhanced Seebeck coefficient.
On the other hand, the Fe3Si is n-type Heusler alloy.42 In the presence of the n-type carriers in addition to the dominating p-type carriers, the total Seebeck coefficient can be expressed as eqn (2):48,49 (2)where Sp, Sn and σp, σn are the Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities for the p- and n-type carriers, respectively. Due to the fact that the sign of Sp and Sn is opposite, the absolute value |Stotal| will be smaller than |Sp|. Therefore, the value of S turns to decrease when x further increases from 0.1 to 0.15, as shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4c shows the power factor (PF) dependence on temperature, which can be calculated from the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient according to the relationship (PF = S2σ). The maximum power factor value of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/0.1Fe3Si is about 30 μW cm−1 K−2, which is similar to that of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12. However, power factors of all other samples with Fe3Si are lower than that of the Fe3Si-free sample, which can be attributed to the decreased electrical conductivity.

Fig. 4d and e display the temperature dependence of total thermal conductivity (κtot), electronic thermal conductivity (κele) and lattice thermal conductivity (κL) for all samples. As the temperature increases, the thermal conductivity value of all samples first decreases because of the Umklapp scattering. However κtot value increases at high temperatures (above 700 K) due to the bipolar effect, consistent with the trend of Seebeck coefficient. All samples with Fe3Si show a lower value of κtot than the sample without Fe3Si. The temperature dependent lattice thermal conductivity is estimated by subtracting the electronic thermal conductivity from the total thermal conductivity, as shown Fig. 4e. The electronic thermal conductivity shown in Fig. 4d can be calculated via the Wiedemann–Frans law κe = LσT, where the Lorenz constant (L) is taken as 2 × 10−8 V2 K−2.50 The content of Fe3Si has little effect on lattice thermal conductivity κL, and thus the reduction of total thermal conductivity results from the decreased electronic thermal conductivity. The phonon scattering process by nanoprecipitates is a complicated process involving many factors. Koh et al.51 proposed that the reduction of κL attributable to nanodots was not as remarkable as expected. Moreover, a similar phenomenon where p-type GaSb nanoprecipitate does not reduce the κL is also reported in the n-type skutterudite composite Yb0.26Co4Sb12/yGaSb.40
The temperature dependence of figure of merit (ZT) for La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) is shown in Fig. 4f. The highest ZT value of 1.2 at 700 K is achieved for Si0.1La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12 sample, whose ZT value is slightly improved at 750 K, compared with the single-phase La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12. High average ZT value is useful for enhancing the thermal-electrical conversion efficiency η.52–54
3.3 Mechanical properties
Indentation method is used to evaluate the effect of in situ Fe3Si on the mechanical properties of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15). According to this method, the indentation fracture toughness (KIC) is measured by Vicker's indentation crack technique using Palmqvist crack model, which is given as55  where E is the Young's modulus, H is the hardness, P is the load, a is half-diagonal and L is the crack length. FESEM is employed to measure the accurate dimensions of “a” and “L” shown in Fig. 5. The tested hardness and calculated indentation fracture toughness are shown in Fig. 6. The value of indentation fracture toughness increases from 1.08 MPa m1/2 to 1.38 MPa m1/2 when the content of Fe3Si (x) increases from 0 to 0.1. For x = 0.1 and x = 0.15 samples, the indentation fracture toughness values are almost the same. Generally, these remarkable improvements are closely related with the pinning effect of Fe3Si nanoprecipitate embedded in the matrix as shown in Fig. 2 and 3a, which creates mechanically interlocked interfaces between Fe3Si nanoprecipitate and matrix. As a result, nanoprecipitates increase the resistance against crack growth, and the crack may deflect when the crack tip acts on the nanoprecipitates. Therefore, introduction of Fe3Si nanoprecipitate is effective in improving the mechanical performance.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/xFe3Si composite was fabricated via an in situ method. The total thermal conductivity was found to decrease for the samples with Fe3Si nanoprecipitate due to the reduced electronic thermal conductivity. As a result, compared with that of the Fe3Si-freeLa0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12, the ZT value of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/0.1Fe3Si is slightly enhanced. Furthermore, the indentation fracture toughness of La0.8Ti0.1Ga0.1Fe3CoSb12/0.1Fe3Si nanocomposite is also improved nearly 30%.
