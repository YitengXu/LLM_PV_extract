    , Accepted 20th August 2021First published on 7th September 2021AbstractAmmonia is an essential commodity chemical used in the manufacture of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, ammunition, and plastics, and is a promising alternative fuel source and carrier. Today most ammonia is manufactured by the century-old Haber–Bosch process, which accounts for 1–2% of worldwide energy production and a substantial fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions. Solar-driven electrochemical synthesis of ammonia using nitrates presents a sustainable pathway to produce renewable fuels utilizing wastewater. Previous efforts in solar-driven electrosynthesis of ammonia have been seriously affected by lower specific activity (<10 mA cm−2) of electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NiRR) and thereby lower solar-to-fuel (STF) efficiency (<1%). Here, we show oxide-derived Co as an efficient NiRR catalyst with the highest specific activity (∼14.56 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V vs. RHE) and selectivity. The oxide-derived Co offers a maximum faradaic efficiency of 92.37 ± 6.7% and ammonia current density of 565.26 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V vs. RHE. Integrating this catalyst in a PV-electrolyzer cell yields an unprecedented STF efficiency of 11% for ammonia, which is an order of magnitude higher than state-of-the-art systems.

Broader context
There is a need for a sustainable alternative to the Haber–Bosch process to manufacture ammonia at an industrial scale, as it contributes annually 3% of global CO2 emissions and consumes at least 1% of the worldwide energy production. Conversion of nitrates to ammonia offers avenues to recycle nitrate emissions from industrial waste and agricultural runoff water, and thereby balance the nitrogen cycle. An active, selective, and stable catalyst that can effectively utilize solar power to yield ammonia at high efficiency is required for sustainable synthesis at an industrial scale. Here, we report oxide-derived cobalt with industrially relevant current densities and high selectivity towards ammonia. Additionally, the solar-driven synthesis of ammonia with solar-to-fuel efficiencies >10% provides opportunities to decarbonize ammonia production.

Ammonia (NH3) is an important commodity chemical for the manufacturing of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, plastics, ammunition, etc. It is produced at a massive rate of 200 mega-metric tons per year globally with a 60 billion USD market value.1 NH3 is also used as a potential energy carrier due to its higher energy density of 4.3 kW h kg−1 and H2 content of 17.75 wt% (40% higher than methanol).2 Such a high demand for NH3 is met primarily by an industrial-scale Haber–Bosch process, which has a severe environmental impact. The Haber–Bosch process needs high temperature (450–500 °C) and high pressure (200 bar), resulting in energy consumption of ∼2.6 exajoules per year and higher capital cost due to the centralized production. The net CO2 emissions of 420 million tons of CO2 equivalent per year makes this a top chemical product responsible for greenhouse gas emission.3
Electrochemical synthesis of NH3 could provide a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber–Bosch process if activated at ambient conditions using electrical energy derived from renewable sources such as solar and wind energy. NH3 can be synthesized electrochemically at ambient conditions using a variety of nitrogen precursors such as N2, NO3−, NO2−, and NOx and H2O as a hydrogen source. While oxides of N can be sourced from waste or pollutant streams, it would be ideal for carrying out the entire process carbon-free by utilizing N2 from the air, H2O, earth-abundant electrocatalyst, and energy from renewable sources. However, direct electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 is a challenging pursuit due to the high energy of NN triple bond (941 kJ mol−1), dominant undesired H2 evolution reaction (HER), and lower solubility of N2 in aqueous solution.4 The highest reported faradaic efficiency (FE) for electrochemical N2 to NH3 is 66% with a partial current density of ∼1 mA cm−2 on Bi nanocrystals,5 which has been difficult to reproduce.6 Due to the lower activity of direct N2 reduction, indirect approaches including two-step N2 reduction such as lithium-mediated NH3 synthesis have shown some promise. Using this lithium-mediated approach, Lazouski et al.7 were able to increase the NH3 current density to 8.8 mA cm−2 while keeping the FE to 30%. Another indirect approach is NO3−-mediated NH3 synthesis, where N2 can be oxidized to NO3− followed by its reduction to NH3. Conversion of NO3− to NH3 also offers avenues to recycle NO3− discharged in municipal and industrial wastewater and agricultural runoff water, and thereby balance the N2 cycle.8,9 Regardless of the choice of a nitrogen precursor, the NH3 current density and FE are far too small for any industrial application.
NO3− to NH3 is thermodynamically more favorable than direct N2 reduction due to lower dissociation energy of NO bond (204 kJ mol−1) as compared to NN (941 kJ mol−1).10NO3− + 6H2O + 8e− → NH3 + 9OH−
Based on the catalyst structure and composition, a wide range of side-products can be obtained from NO3− such as NO2, NO2−, NO, N2O, N2, NH2OH, and N2H4. Most of the articles on NO3− removal focus on water treatment where NO3− is preferred to be reduced to N2, but not on NO3− reduction to synthesize NH3. Several catalysts such as Ti, Cu, Ni, Pb, Al, Sn, Bi have been studied to maximize the conversion of NO3− to N2 with conversions approaching close to 100%. However, very few reports show an active and selective electrochemical reduction of NO3− to NH3. A summary of recent literature for the electrochemical reduction of NO3− to NH3 is provided in Table S1 (ESI†).
McEnaney et al.11 studied the effect of pH, NO3− concentration, and the applied potential for the electrochemical reduction of NO3− to NH3 on Titanium metal. They reported a high NH3 FE of 82% and NH3 current density of −22 mA cm−2 at −1 V vs. RHE. They hypothesize that increased NH3 FE at a higher concentration of NO3− could be due to the ability of the NO3− to react with the formed H2, eventually suppressing HER as lower concentrations of H2 were deducted. Wang et al.12 studied the electrochemical NO3− reduction on different morphologies of Cu, including Cu mesh, Cu nanowires, and Cu2O nanowires at a neutral medium. They reported a high NH3 FE of 95.8% and NH3 current density of −52.5 mA cm−2 at −0.85 V vs. RHE. Chen et al.13 performed experimental screening of various transition metals for selective reduction of NO3− to NH3 and found that Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni have higher selectivity to NH3. They chose a Cu-incorporated molecular solid [3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA)] for further analysis. They reported a high NH3 FE of 85.9% and NH3 current density of −11.04 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V vs. RHE. Wang et al.14 used a Cu–Ni bimetallic alloy to improve the NO3− activity. They achieved a higher NH3 FE of close to 100% compared to individual Cu and Ni and an NH3 current density of −53 mA cm−2 at −0.15 V vs. RHE. More recently, three-dimensional Co nanoarrays of high surface area showed the highest FE with a current density close to 2 A cm−2, while the active-area-normalized current density (or specific current density) remained less than 10 mA cm−2.15 Most of the studies reported achieved a higher NH3 FE by using a lower concentration of NO3− (<0.1 M) because the FE drops significantly with increasing NO3− concentration, which could be due to the poisoning effect.16–20 Consequently, there is a need for a highly active catalyst that can produce NH3 at specific current densities >10 mA cm−2 and is resistive to NO3− poisoning.
Efficient integration of such NO3− reduction catalysts with a solar cell can provide opportunities to utilize wastewater and sunlight for sustainable synthesis of green ammonia. Due to the lack of efficient catalysts and solar integration schemes, solar-driven ammonia synthesis has been extremely challenging, with maximum solar-to-fuel (STF) efficiency not exceeding 1% for NH3 produced using N2.21–25 There are no studies reported for solar-driven ammonia synthesis using NO3−. Here, we report a highly efficient integration of GaInP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell with an electrochemical cell consisting of oxide-derived Co (OD-Co) for NO3− reduction reaction (NiRR) and Ni foam for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve >10% STF efficiency for NH3 production. The theory-guided selective and active catalyst-OD-Co shows very high activity and selectivity of NiRR with an onset potential of 0.1 V vs. RHE, maximum FE of 92 ± 6%, an active-area-normalized current density of 14.56 mA cm−2, and geometric current density of 565 mA cm−2.
Methods
The materials used for the experiments are given in Section S2 of the ESI.†
DFT studies
Density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE)26 was used to determine intermediate adsorption energies. All calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)27–29 and interfaced with the atomic simulation environment.30 The core electrons of all elements were represented by projector augmented wave pseudopotentials,31 while valence electrons were expanded as planewaves up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV. The electron exchange and correlation interactions were accounted for using the Bayesian Error Estimation Functional (BEEF-vdW)32 at the GGA level. When optimizing bulk lattice constants for each metal, the Brillouin zone was sampled with a 12 × 12 × 12 gamma centered Monkhorst–Pack33k-point mesh. Adsorbate binding energies were calculated using a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell, with the bottom two layers fixed to the bulk lattice constant and the top layer free to relax. A dipole correction was applied in the vacuum region far from the surface to counteract electrostatic interactions caused by any net dipole moment in the direction normal to the surface.34 To represent a packed surface, the (111) facet was used for FCC metals, the (110) facet was used for BCC metals, and the (0001) facet was used for HCP metals. All the metals considered in these calculations were in reduced states, which is an expected state for metals used in electrochemical reduction reaction. The reaction mechanism used for the DFT calculations are given in Section S3 of the ESI.†
Electrode preparation
For the catalyst screening studies Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Zn were used. The metals were mechanically polished before every experiment using a 600-Grit SiC sandpaper for 2 minutes and washed using isopropyl alcohol, tap water, and deionized water. Co/PTFE and Co/GP were prepared by sputter coating Co on the PTFE membrane and graphite planchet (GP). The thickness of the sputter-coated Co is 10 nm. Oxide-derived cobalt (OD-Co) was prepared by the following procedure: Co was first polished and cleaned by the previously mentioned procedure. Oxidative-Reductive cycles were carried out by using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). 1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte, Platinum was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl/KCl was used as the reference electrode. The CV was carried out between −2 to 2 V vs. Ag/AgCl at 500 mV s−1 scan rate and 100 cycles were performed. The resulting OD-Co was washed using deionized water and oven-dried at 85 °C. The above-mentioned procedure was carried out before every experiment when OD-Co was involved.
Surface characterization and operando infrared measurements
X-Ray diffraction (XRD)
X-Ray diffraction measurements were performed using Cu Kα radiation produced at 40 kV and 40 mA (Bruker D8 Advance) to analyze the bulk crystal structure of the OD-Co. The measurement errors were mitigated from the surface curvature by using a diffractometer equipped with parallel beam optics and a 0.5° slit analyzer.
X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS measurements were performed using a monochromatized Al Kα radiation produced at 12 kV and 10 mA (Kratos Axis-165) to analyze the near-surface composition and the oxidation state of the oxide-derived cobalt before and after electrolysis. Ar sputtering was not performed on the sample surface to prevent the composition changes. A survey scan was performed followed by the high-resolution scans between the binding energies 770 and 810 eV to identify the Co 2p peaks. The binding energy of the measured core level spectra was calibrated by setting the observed C 1s binding energy to 284.8 eV.
X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements at the Co K edge were conducted at Sector 10.ID of the X-ray Science Division beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Photon energy was calibrated by applying the appropriate offset to shift the simultaneously measured reference spectra of Co foil to 7.7089 keV. Samples were prepared by sputter coating 500 nm of Co metal onto a glassy carbon sheet. The glassy carbon sheet was synthesized by pyrolyzing 20 μm thick Kapton tape in a N2 environment at 1000 °C for 1 h.35 Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were acquired in transmission mode with the Co film and glassy carbon sheet samples at a 45° angle to the beam. XAS data was processed using the Demeter Software suite and standard data analysis protocols.36,37 EXAFS fits were generated using ARTEMIS software and theoretically derived scattering paths were calculated in ARTEMIS using conventional standard cif files of Co metal (SG:194) and CoO (SG:225) from the Materials Project Database. Fits were performed in R-space using k, k2, and k3 weighting using three Co scattering paths. An additional O scattering path was used to fit the OD Co film to obtain a good fit. The coordination numbers for the OD Co film were determined using the amplitude reduction factor (S02) fit to the Co film sample with the expected coordination numbers. More details on the EXAFS fitting and tabulated fit parameters are provided in the Section S4 of the ESI† (Fig. S1).
Operando attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS)
ATR-SEIRAS was performed (Bruker Invenio S FTIR spectrometer) to get insight into the nitrate reduction mechanism. A custom-made electrochemical cell setup (Fig. S2, ESI†) with a 60° Ge face-angled crystal was used on a VeeMax III variable angle accessory. To enhance the metal wettability of the Ge crystal, it was sputter-coated with an IR transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) to form a 53 nm thick ITO layer using a film thickness monitored sputtering (EMS Quorum 150TS plus). Co was sputtered on top of this ITO layer with a thickness of 13 nm. The spectra were acquired at 3 potentials – below the onset potential (0.1 V vs. RHE), above the onset potential (−0.3 V vs. RHE), and near the maximum FE of NH3 production (−1 V vs. RHE). Each spectrum was acquired with a resolution of 2 cm−1 using a liquid N2 cooled mid-band mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector and averaged over 64 scans.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical experiments were performed in a three-electrode H-cell configuration (Biologic SP300 potentiostat and EC-Lab V11.012 workstation) with constant stirring at 750 rpm using a magnetic stirrer at ambient conditions. Fig. S3 (ESI†) denotes the 3D model of the H-cell used for the electrochemical nitrate reduction experiments. Applied Potential was represented in the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation: E(V vs. RHE) = E(V vs. Ag/AgCl/KCl) + 0.059 × pH + 0.205(1)
The catholyte and the anolyte chambers were separated by using a quaternary ammonium anion exchange membrane. The membrane was priorly hydrated in distilled water for 48 h at 85 °C. For the electrolyte with pH 1, a Nafion membrane was used. The ohmic resistance was measured at the open circuit potential by performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) from 30 kHz to 1 Hz before all the experiments and fitted using EC-Laboratory with 100% IR-drop compensation. 1 M KNO3 was used as the electrolyte for the LSV studies with a potential scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Effect of pH studies was performed at three different pH conditions (1, 7, and 14). 1 M KNO3 was prepared in 0.1 M HNO3 solution to maintain the pH at 1. Phosphate Buffer was used to maintain 1 M KNO3 solution at pH 7. Phosphate buffer was prepared by using 0.62 M Phosphate monobasic solution and 0.38 M Phosphate dibasic solution. pH 14 was maintained by preparing 1 M KNO3 solution in 1 M KOH solution. All other experiments were performed using 1 M KNO3 at pH 14. Simulated wastewater was prepared by adding 26 mg L−1 KNO3, 26 mg L−1 KNO2, 580 mg L−1 KCl, 102 mg L−1 K2SO4, and 366 mg L−1 KHCO3.
Ammonia quantification
Ammonia present in the electrolyte solution was quantified by the Indophenol method.38 3 mL of the sample was used for quantification. 500 μL of phenol nitroprusside solution and 500 μL of alkaline hypochlorite solution were added to the sample. The resulting solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The colorless solution containing ammonia turns to indigo-blue color when the above-mentioned reagents are added. After 30 min, the samples were analyzed using a visible spectrophotometer (Genesys 30), and spectra were obtained between the wavelengths 400 and 800 nm. The maximum absorbance was obtained at 632 nm. Separate calibration graphs were prepared for pH 1, 7, and 14. For the samples with pH 1, 1 mL of the sample was mixed with 2 mL of 1 M KOH and then the analysis was performed. Fig. S4 (ESI†) denotes the absorbance as a function of the wavelengths and the calibration graphs.
Control studies
All the experiments were repeated thrice, and the average values were reported with standard deviations. All glassware, vials, and electrochemical cell parts were washed thrice using running water, deionized water, and oven-dried at 85 °C before usage to avoid overestimation, from the contamination of NH3 from adverse sources (air, reagents, etc.). Premeasurements were done to test for ammonia before every experiment and the concentration of NH3 measured was subtracted from the post measurement. The concentration of NH3 measured during the start of the experiment was usually very less. Open circuit experiments were conducted thrice, and the ammonia measured was not in the detectable limits, which indicates that it is from some contamination source and the NH3 produced during the closed-circuit experiments was solely from the electrochemical reduction of nitrates. The concentration of NH3 measured during the electrochemical reduction of nitrates is >50 mM, and hence the N-15 isotope labeling experiments were not needed to confirm the source of NH3.
Solar-driven ammonia production
A triple-junction solar cell (GaInP/GaAs/Ge) from Spectrolabs was used for the direct solar reduction of NO3− to NH3. A detailed characterization of the solar cell is given in Section S8 of the ESI† (Fig. S5). The solar cell was irradiated using Oriel LCS-100 Solar simulator to simulate AM 1.5 G. The power input to the solar cell is 100 mW cm−2. The total area of the solar cell being irradiated was 16 cm2. A membrane-free configuration was used to reduce NO3− to NH3. Ni foam was used as the anode and OD-Co was used as the cathode. The surface area of the OD-Co was ∼8 cm2. The copper tape was used as the current collector. The current flowing through the circuit was measured by using a potentiostat as a zero-resistance ammeter. The solar to fuel efficiency (STF) was calculated based on the following equation,  where, jNH3 is the Ammonia current density (mA cm−2), Aelectrode is the electrode area (8 cm2), E° is the equilibrium cell potential (1.23–0.69 V = 0.54 V). Here, the equilibrium potential for OER occurring at the anode is 1.23 V vs. SHE39 and the equilibrium potential for NiRR occurring at cathode is 0.69 V vs. SHE.14
Results
Volcano plot and free energy profile for NO3− reduction
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand NiRR activity trends on various transition metals. The limiting potential activity volcanos (see Section S9 of the ESI,† Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†) were calculated for electrochemical NiRR and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) across a variety of transition metals. The thermodynamic calculations for a series of nine elementary surface reactions involved in NO3− reduction to NH3 (eqn (i)–(ix) of the ESI†) show that the two most challenging steps form the strong and weak binding legs of the volcano. Fig. 1A shows this NO3− volcano, where the left leg (blue) is limited by protonation of adsorbed NO2 to form NO2H, and the right leg (red) is limited by protonation of adsorbed NO to form NOH. Co and Ni are most likely to be active, appearing very close to the peak of the electrochemical nitrate reduction volcano. The catalysts further down the right leg of the volcano, such as Pt and Pd, are likely to be more active towards HER, as shown by the HER volcano (green) in Fig. 1A. For this reason, Co and Ni were tested experimentally, along with Cu and Fe, to explore the right and left legs of the volcano, respectively. Although near the peak of the HER volcano, Zn was also investigated experimentally due to its earth abundance. Fig. 1B shows the free energy diagram for the NiRR on Co (100) at −0.6 V vs. RHE.

Comparative evaluation of activity and selectivity of potential catalysts
The activity and selectivity of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn were confirmed experimentally in 1 M KNO3 electrolyte of pH 7 at −0.8 V vs. RHE. Fig. 2A shows the FE and current density of these catalysts. Confirming to theoretical predictions, Co shows the highest NH3 FE of 93.5% and NH3 current density of 298 mA cm−2. Cu and Zn did not show significant FE and current density. Although Fe and Ni showed higher FEs, their NH3 current densities were lower as compared to Co. Therefore, Co was chosen for further studies of NiRR. Next, the effectiveness of different substrates, namely polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), graphite, and Co metal plates, were evaluated as supports for Co. Fig. 2B shows linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) for Co on PTFE (Co/PTFE), graphite planchet (blank GP), Co on GP (Co/GP), Co metal plate, and oxide-derived Co on Co metal plate (OD-Co) in 1 M KNO3 of pH 7 at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. Co sputter-coated on a high-surface-area PTFE membrane did not show any activity for NiRR. This could be due to the poor conductivity of Co films on PTFE. Co sputter-coated on the GP has a similar onset potential and current density as that of polycrystalline Co metal plate. The LSV of Co/GP is also compared with the blank GP as a control experiment.

(B) Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Co on different substrates: PTFE (Co/PTFE), Graphite Planchet (Co/GP), and Co metal. OD-Co is supported on Co metal plate. The LSVs were measured in 1M KNO3 of pH 7 at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. (C) Comparison of LSVs normalized by electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of OD-Co and bare Co metal. 
To further improve the activity of Co metal, OD-Co was prepared by continuous oxidative and reduction cycles on Co metal surface (the detailed procedure is given in the Methods section). The improved performance of the OD-Co can be attributed to the higher surface roughness and the oxidation state of the Co. Fig. 2C shows the LSVs normalized by the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The details of ECSA measurements are provided in Section S10 of the ESI,† (Fig. S8 and S9). The ECSA of Co metal plate and OD-Co are very close, 10.600 cm2 and 10.975 cm2, respectively. Therefore, the higher specific activity of OD-Co can be attributed to increased surface roughness that were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (see Fig. S10 and Section S11, ESI†). The maximum surface roughness depth of Co metal increases by ∼100 nm in OD-Co. Also, the average roughness of Co increases from 7.3% to 20.4% for OD-Co.
Surface characterization of OD-Co and identification of NiRR reaction intermediates

Fig. 3A shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of OD-Co where (002) and (101) planes are dominant. Fig. 3B shows a high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum for the binding energies of Co-2p electrons before NiRR. The 2.3 eV shift in binding energies of OD-Co (with respect to 778 eV of metallic Co) along with the satellite 2p peaks indicates that the Co in OD-Co is in +2 oxidation state. Fig. 3C shows the high resolution XPS for the binding energies of Co – 2p electrons of OD-Co after the electrochemical reduction of NO3− to ammonia at −0.8 V vs. RHE. The Co 2p3/2 peak shifts towards the metallic region of Co (778.8 eV) indicating the reduction of OD-Co after electrolysis. Structural differences between the Co metal and OD-Co films were further investigated utilizing Co K edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Fig. 3D shows the EXAFS spectra of Co metal and OD Co metal films, with key differences denoted between the two spectra in the Co–O and Co–Co bond regions. The OD-Co film has a significant feature at 1.55 Å, indicative of a Co–O bond and the incorporation of oxygen into the OD film. The Co–Co bond peaks in the Co metal and OD-Co films are located at 2.18 and 2.20 Å, respectively.40 The slight migration of the OD film's Co–Co peak to higher R space relative to the Co metal film is consistent with oxygen incorporation in the OD-Co film and a higher average Co oxidation state.41,42Fig. 3E shows the electrochemical attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectra (ATR-SEIRA) at different applied potentials to observe the intermediates formed at the surface of the OD-Co coated on Ge crystal. At 0.1 V vs. RHE, no bands are observed pertaining to NO3− or any possible intermediates. Since this potential is close to the onset potential, the coverages of NO3− reduction intermediates might be too low to appear on ATR-SEIRA. As the potential is increased above the onset potential to −0.3 V vs. RHE, various bands start to emerge on the catalyst surface. A monodentate  radical is observed at 1510 cm−1 indicating the Co–NO3 adsorptions.43 Bands of N–O stretching at 1617 and 1608 cm−1 shifted by +7 and +26 cm−1, respectively, likely due to co-adsorption of water species on the catalyst surface and the stark effect.44,45 The N–H bending modes at 1436 cm−1 and NH2 wagging modes at 1360 cm−144,46,47 can be attributed to the reaction proceeding towards the formation of NH3. At −1.0 V vs. RHE, all the intermediates observed at −0.3 V are still present with the addition of NN stretching mode at 2001 cm−1 that may have come from trace amount of either N2 or N2H4 formation.47,48 See Section S12 in the ESI,† for the critical angle, depth of penetration measurements (Fig. S11, ESI†). FTIR spectrum of Co in 1 M KNO3 at open circuit potential is given in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Fig. 3F shows the LSV of OD-Co in the presence and absence of NO3− confirming the extremely high activity of NiRR over HER. There are visibly no gas bubbles on OD-Co during electrolysis in NO3− electrolyte, which is also confirmed from gas chromatogram (see Fig. S13 in the ESI†).

Effect of pH and potential on FE and current density of NiRR
Here we evaluate the effect of pH, applied potential, and concentration of NO3− on NH3 FE and current density on OD-Co. Fig. 4A shows the NH3 FE and current densities at −0.6 V vs. RHE for 1 M NO3− electrolyte of pH 1, 7, and 14. While FEs do not vary significantly with increasing pH, the NH3 current densities increase almost linearly. The lowest activity is observed in acidic medium, which could be due to lowered binding energy of NO3−. The maximum NH3 FE (90.95%) and NH3 current density (372 mA cm−2) are obtained at pH 14. The effect of applied potential on the FE and current density is then investigated in a neutral and alkaline medium. Fig. 4B shows the NH3 FE and current density as a function of applied potential at pH 14. As the negative potential bias is increased, the NH3 current density increases monotonically past the onset potential of 0.1 V vs. RHE. The calculated Tafel slope is 169.3 mV dec−1 (see Fig. S14, ESI†). The FE increases sharply and reaches a plateau around 92% at negative potentials higher than −0.2 V vs. RHE. The lower FE at the onset potential can be due to the reduction of CoOx. The maximum NH3 current density 565 ± 24 mA cm−2 and a turnover frequency (TOF) 6.35 × 106 h−1 (highest so far) are obtained at −0.8 V vs. RHE. Fig. 4C shows the NH3 FE and current density as a function of applied potential at pH 7. The current density vs. potential curve at pH 7 is shifted more negative to about 0.2 V for the pH 14 curve (note that the x-axis scale is different in Fig. 4B and C). The onset potential for NO3− reduction is also increased in a neutral pH medium. The kinetics of NiRR in neutral pH is relevant to the removal of NO3− from the municipal wastewater, where the concentration of NO3− is in the range 1–3 mM. Fig. 4D shows the almost linear (1st order with R2 = 0.96) variation of NH3 current density with respect to NO3− concentration in the range 0.1 M to 1 M. The NH3 current density varies non-linearly below 0.1 M due to mass transfer limitations. OD-Co is selective with >80% FE over a wide range of NO3− concentrations from 10 mM to 1 M. The FE and NH3 current density versus applied potential with simulated wastewater is also shown in Fig. S15 of the ESI.† Maximum NH3 current density of 0.89 mA cm−2 and FE of 12.34% are obtained using simulated wastewater. Stability studies are performed for a period of 24 h on OD-Co at −0.4 V vs. RHE at pH 14. Fig. 4E shows the total current density as a function of time. The OD-Co remained stable for the entire duration of 24 h in alkaline conditions and the NH3 FE for the overall 24 h run was 86.76%. Fig. 4F compares the NH3 FE and geometric-area-normalized current densities reported in the literature with the current study. Fig. 4G compares the NH3 FE and active-area-normalized current densities (specific activity) reported in the literature with the current study. The active area for each catalyst in Fig. 4G is given in Table S2 of the ESI.† The OD-Co shows the highest specific current density among the reported studies.

Solar-to-fuel (STF) efficiency for ammonia production
Solar-driven NO3− reduction to NH3 is evaluated by connecting a Spectro lab's XTJ (GaInP/GaAs/Ge) triple Junction solar cell to the electrochemical cell (see photovoltaic (PV)-electrolyzer configuration in Fig. 5A). The measured power efficiency of solar cell is 46.83%. 16 cm2 of solar cell is irradiated under an AM 1.5G using a Solar simulator (Newport LCS 100) and the reaction was carried out for 3 h, as shown in Fig. 5A. Fig. 5B shows the intersection of the current vs. cell voltage (JV curve) of the solar cell with the current vs. cell voltage (load curve) of the electrochemical cell. The PV-electrolyzer cell has an operating current of ∼300 mA and an operating cell voltage of ∼2 V. Fig. 5C shows the total current, NH3 FE, and STF efficiency obtained over 3 h in a PV-electrolyzer cell. A stable current of ∼300 mA, FE of 95%, and STF efficiency of 11% is obtained in the PV-electrolyzer cell with a cell voltage of ∼2 V without external bias. This PV-electrolyzer cell was also demonstrated for conversion of NO3− in simulated wastewater (containing only 3 mM NO3−) to NH3 at STF efficiency ∼0.25% (see Fig. S16 of the ESI†).

Conclusions
Solar-driven electrosynthesis of NH3 has been extremely challenging due to the unavailability of highly selective and active catalysts and the inefficient integration of solar cells with electrolyzers. The maximum reported STF efficiency for NH3 is less than 1%. In this work, we develop a novel catalyst, optimal electrolyte composition, and efficient PV-electrolyzer integration to achieve ∼11% STF efficiency at ambient conditions. In summary, theoretical and experimental screening of late transition metals for the electrochemical reduction of NO3− to NH3 determine Co as a better catalyst for NiRR. The highest efficiency towards NiRR is obtained with Co, whose activity is limited by protonation of adsorbed NO2 to form NO2H. The activity of Co has improved at least four folds by increasing surface roughness. The oxide-derived (OD) Co has the highest specific activity among all the catalysts reported in the literature, with a maximum NH3 current density of ∼565 mA cm−2 and FE ∼92%. The OD-Co is also active in neutral pH conditions with 1st order rate dependence with respect to NO3−. This enables OD-Co to selectively reduce NO3− in wastewater to NH3. An efficient PV-electrolyzer cell consisting of GaInP/GaAs/Ge solar cell connected with an electrochemical cell is developed. A stable solar to NH3 efficiency of 11% is obtained at 1 sun and ambient conditions. The specific current density and STF efficiency reported in this work is, to our knowledge, the highest in the literature, indicating that solar-driven electrochemical synthesis of NH3via NO3− is a feasible route for the renewable synthesis of NH3.

Broader context
There is a need for a sustainable alternative to the Haber–Bosch process to manufacture ammonia at an industrial scale, as it contributes annually 3% of global CO2 emissions and consumes at least 1% of the worldwide energy production. Conversion of nitrates to ammonia offers avenues to recycle nitrate emissions from industrial waste and agricultural runoff water, and thereby balance the nitrogen cycle. An active, selective, and stable catalyst that can effectively utilize solar power to yield ammonia at high efficiency is required for sustainable synthesis at an industrial scale. Here, we report oxide-derived cobalt with industrially relevant current densities and high selectivity towards ammonia. Additionally, the solar-driven synthesis of ammonia with solar-to-fuel efficiencies >10% provides opportunities to decarbonize ammonia production.
