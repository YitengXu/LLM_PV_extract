First published on 8th May 2008AbstractSolid state reactions play crucial roles in highly efficient electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, typically lithium ion batteries and ruthenium oxide supercapacitors. Electrolytic processes may also involve solid-to-solid changes such as the anodisation of metals for designated surface nanostructures and functionalities. More recently, a novel and green route for the production of metals and alloys in molten salts has drawn worldwide attention. It is based on the electro-reduction of metal compounds, particularly oxides, to the respective metals or alloys in the solid-state. This article reviews recent advancement of this new process in terms of potential applications and fundamental understanding.
1. Introduction
Cathodic refining of liquid copper in molten BaCl2 was first attempted by constant current electrolysis in an electrolytic cell with liquid copper cathode and a carbon anode in the early 1960s in Cambridge.1 About three decades later, a similar procedure was applied in molten CaCl2 for refining oxygenated solid titanium under constant cell voltage control.2,3 In both cases, it was proposed that elemental barium or calcium was first formed at the cathode and it consequently reacted with the oxygen (and other non-metallic impurities in the case of liquid copper) in the metal to be refined to form BaO or CaO.1–3 These proposed cathodic reactions, termed as electro-metallothermic reduction, are summarised below, using Ca as an example, for the reduction of a metal oxide (MOx) or a solid solution of oxygen in the metal (MnO). Ca2+ + 2e → Ca (cathode)(1) MOx + xCa → M + xCaO(2) MnO + Ca → nM + CaO(2a)Based on this concept, researchers in Japan developed a metal extraction process from oxide powders by calciothermic reduction in which calcium was in situ generated by electrolysis in molten CaCl2–CaO melt in the early 2000s.4–8 Interestingly, the conventional metallothermic reduction itself was also proposed to follow an electronically mediated reaction (EMR) as demonstrated by the reduction of TiCl4,9 K2TaF7,10TaCl5,11 Nb2O512 and TiO213 in molten salts. According to the EMR mechanism, no direct contact is necessary between, for example, elemental calcium and metal compound to be reduced, but electron transfer from calcium to the compound is mediated via the metal initially formed.
It was again in Cambridge in late 1990s that direct electrolytic conversion of some solid metal oxides to the respective metals or alloys was achieved in molten salts with an electrolysis voltage below the decomposition voltage of the molten salt, particularly TiO2 in molten CaCl2.14,15 These laboratory findings promise a completely new technology, namely the FFC Cambridge Process, for low-cost extraction of reactive metals and convenient synthesis of structural and functional alloys, which will be described in detail in the following sections in this review. An oxygen ionization mechanism or direct electrochemical reduction mechanism was accordingly proposed15,16 and can be described as follow. MOx + 2xe → M + xO2−(3) MnO + 2e → nM + O2−(3a)Although some researchers are still debating between the two mechanisms, especially for the extraction of titanium, the differences are very apparent: (1) Direct electrochemical reduction (reactions (3) and (3a)) can occur at a more positive potential than the equilibrium potential of Ca2+/Ca in molten CaCl2, especially for the reduction of oxides of noble metals such as niobium oxide and chromium oxide; (2) Metals whose oxides are more stable than CaO such as some rare earth oxides (Table 1, data from HSC Chemistry) cannot be reduced through reaction (2), but is possible through reaction (3); (3) For a solid cathode, especially for an insulator or semiconductor cathode in contact with a current collector, direct electrochemical reduction will take place at the current collector/MOx (solid)/molten salt three phase interlines, while reaction (1) takes place at the surface of the conductive part of the cathode. The confusion sometimes occurs in situations where the applied cell voltage is higher than the decomposition voltage of CaO (when CaO is present) or more generally of CaCl2. Both of the mechanism would be effective thermodynamically at the same time but should be distinguishable kinetically. Electro-metallothermic reduction will be always accompanied by the direct electrochemical reduction, while calcium deposition may have a positive or negative effect on the reduction kinetics of solid cathode. For the above reason, undoubtedly the direct electrochemical reduction should be much widely applied. This review will focus on the recent advancement on preparation of metals and functional materials by direct electrochemical solid-state transformation reaction. The relevant physical chemistry and especially the reduction kinetics on solid cathodes are discussed based on novel dynamic solid/solid/liquid three phase interline models.

2. The panorama of direct electrochemical solid-to-solid conversion in molten salts
The new technology for extraction of metals based on the direct electrochemical reduction of solid oxide in molten salt, namely the FFC Cambridge Process,16 was represented schematically in Fig. 1. The metal oxide powder is firstly made into a porous preform such as a pellet that is then connected to a current conductor and acted as the cathode in an electrolytic cell combined with a graphite or an inert anode. The electrolyte consists of alkaline earth chloride (CaCl2, BaCl2 ) or their mixture with alkali chloride (LiCl, NaCl, KCl). Among these, molten CaCl2 was mostly used for its lower cost, convenient availability and most importantly it has a very high solubility for oxygen ion and calcium.17,18 Upon applying a constant voltage between cathode and anode, the metal oxide is electrochemically reduced and the oxygen is ionized and transferred to the anode through the melt, and then oxidized to form O2 on an inert anode or CO or CO2 on a carbon anode. On the cathode, solid metal is formed. The obtained metal can be directly used as functional powder material or for further fabrication by either a conventional metallurgy or powder metallurgy method. A typical reduction process for a cathode preform, especially for insulator and semiconductor oxide, can be schematically shown as Fig. 2,16 in which the metallization follows a solid metal/solid oxide/molten salt three phase interline (3PI) propagation process. The details of the 3PI models will be discussed in Section 5 of this review.

This novel process has drawn worldwide attention because of its scientific interest as well as comprehensive technical importance for its high energy efficiency and low environmental impact in comparison with conventional metallurgical techniques. As a benefit from the solid to solid transformation, it avoids dendrite product on the cathode and the oxidation/reduction shuttle of intermediate cation between anode and cathode in the traditional process of electrowinning of refractory metals.19–22 More than 30 metals or semimetals, as shown in the periodic table in Fig. 3, have been prepared by the method as single metal and/or alloy in the last decade in molten CaCl2 or LiCl based melts. Since the decomposition voltage of all metal oxides is obviously below that of alkali and alkali earth chloride (Table 1), thermodynamically the metal oxides can be directly reduced to metal by the method. However, the solid–solid transformation immediately requires a solid cathode preform and a solid product through a solid state electrochemical reaction. This means that one should pay a special attention to some low melting point metal oxides such as V2O5, B2O3 (Table 1), metals such as Al, Sn (Table 1) and the raw material or intermediate product with high solubility in the melt or high reactive activity with the melt to form a liquid or gas product. One of the solutions for the challenge is to make the reactant or the product form a compound or alloy with other compounds or metals as exampled in the following section.

3. Preparation of pure metals by the FFC Cambridge process
3.1 
          Titanium and zirconium

          Titanium has many desirable properties. It is light, strong and corrosion resistant23 with a 9th rank rich resources in the earth crust, but its use has been restricted because of the high cost of the current batch type pyrometallurgical production process: the Kroll Process.24 After it was first reported in 2000,15 the direct electrochemical reduction of solid titanium dioxide to titanium has been confirmed by researchers25–44 around the world, both in academia and industry, and has stimulated new enthusiasms to develop a different process45–51 for cost-affordable titanium. At the same time, details of the reduction mechanism and kinetics are being revealed through the continuous effort from several laboratories.25–38,52–56

Fig. 4 shows typical pictures of the internal structures of a titania pellet before and after electrolysis. The white titania pellet turned into a shrunken conductive metallic grey pellet after electrolysis. Examination under SEM showed that the sub-micrometer oxide powder (Fig. 4a) had been transformed into titanium metal particles of about 10 μm which were slightly sintered together to give the familiar microstructure of the Kroll titanium sponge (Fig. 4b). Typically the oxygen content in the sample is between 500–3000 ppm. The reason for the quick reduction of TiO2 which is effectively an insulator can be attributed to two aspects: (1) Upon applying the voltage, a small amount of reduction takes place in the porous pellet, causing the formation of Magnelli phases (TiO2−x) which are highly conducting57 and leads to electronically conductive electrode.15 (2) The quick propagation of Ti (TinO, TiOx)/TiO2 (CaTiO3)/CaCl2 three phase interlines which are initially generated on the surface of the pellet as evidenced by a layered structure in a partially reduced pellet in a short time26,27 and may also exist within the pellet during continuous formation of the conductive TiOx phases.

The insert between a and b is the photograph of the titania pellet before (top) and after (bottom) electrolysis. (Reprinted from ref. 27 with permission from Elsevier. Copyright 2006.) 
Active debate took place in the early 2000s on the mechanism of reduction of solid titania in molten CaCl2, namely the electro-metallothermic reduction mechanism and the direct electrochemical reduction mechanism, leading to the well-known two processes for titanium production, the OS Process and the FFC Process. Cyclic voltammetry investigations52 by a thermally formed titanium oxide coating electrode and a titanium pseudo reference electrode revealed that the titanium oxide can be reduced to metallic titanium at more positive potential than that for the formation of calcium at unit activity, although 3,52 4,30,31 and 239reduction peaks were observed by different researchers, which might be dependent on the applied specific experimental conditions such as the electrode and electrolyte preparation as well as experimental operation. To investigate the titanium dioxide powder directly and to get a more accurate and consistent potential control, a complete quartz sealed Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Fig. 5a) and a novel metallic cavity working electrode (Fig. 5b)58,59 have been designed and applied to evaluate the reduction mechanism of titanium dioxide in the authors’ laboratory.
 Fig. 5  (a) A completely sealed Ag/AgCl reference electrode; (b) Through hole metallic cavity working electrode and (c) cyclic voltammograms of metallic cavity electrode (through-hole, molybdenum foil) with TiO2 powder in molten CaCl2 (+MgCl2, ≤ 0.3 wt%) at 900 °C. 

Fig. 5c shows the first three voltammogram cycles of a TiO2 powder filled metallic cavity electrode. There are four reduction peaks at the less negative potential region of calcium deposition, very consistent with the results in refs. 30 and 31. The different reduction currents at C3 and C4 may due to the higher porosity of the powder electrode than a dense coating. Holding the potential at the relative reduction peak potential for 1000 s, respectively, the products were determined by SEM and EDX. From the data shown in Table 2 and others’ results of XRD,30 it can be concluded that at the negative potential region (C1 and C2), the titanium oxide was reduced to TinO solution (Ti4O and Ti2O, respectively), while at the more positive potential region, intermediate titanium oxide such as Ti3O5 or Ti2O3 and some titanate compounds such as CaTiO3−x or MgTiO3−x formed (C3 and C4) depending on the composition of the electrolyte. The results from different laboratories well demonstrate the direct electrochemical reduction mechanism, although the lower oxygen content titanium may require a more negative potential that will be accompanied by the deposition of calcium due to the potential window of the electrolyte. Diagrams showing equilibrium potentials plotted vs. the negative logarithms of oxide-ion activity (pO2−) had been constructed for titanium species including oxides, chlorides, and metal, in molten calcium chloride over the temperature range 800–1100 °C recently.31 These plots can suggest ideal process routes that produce low-oxygen titanium under controlled melt composition and potential.

The sandwich structure observed in an incompletely reduced cathode pellet (Fig. 6a) with metallic titanium outer layer and TiOx (x < 2) and CaTiOx inner layer26 suggests that the reduction develops inwardly. The correlation between the reduction depth (thickness of metallised surface layer) and electrolysis time follows either a logarithm or parabolic law (Fig. 6b), indicating the influence of diffusion on the reduction kinetics.26 This was further confirmed by comparing the reduction of a porous and a denser pellets.60 The porous pellet exhibited a much higher reduction rate.

(b) Correlation between the thickness of the metallised surface layer A in (a) (reduction depth) and the electrolysis time. (Reprinted from ref. 27 with permission from Elsevier. Copyright 2006.) 
It is also very interesting to investigate the variation of composition and microstructure with electrolysis time. From partially reduced samples which were prepared by terminating the reduction process after different reaction times, it was found that the reduction proceeds through a number of individual stages some of which involve the formation and decomposition of calcium titanates (Fig. 7) and the electrochemical reduction of titanium dioxide to titanium metal is accompanied by substantial changes in the microstructure.55 Although strongly depending on the specific experimental condition, it was found that the microstructural kinetics of phase transformations might also play an important role on the controlling of the overall rate of reduction.56

The formation of various perovskite phases61 (CaδTiOx, δ ≤ 1, x ≤ 3, typically CaTiO3 and CaTi2O4 as shown above55) during the electro-reduction of solid TiO2 in molten CaCl2 may retard the reduction and contribute indirectly to the low current efficiency. These perovskite phases are larger in volume than the respective TiOy (y ≤ 2) phases because of the insertion or inclusion of Ca2+ ions. (ρTiO2 = 4.23 g/cm3, ρTi2O3 = 4.49 g/cm3, ρCaTiO3 = 4.00 g/cm3.) The consequent expansion of the solid phase reduces the number and sizes of pores in the cathode that are needed for the transport of O2− ions. The CaδTiOx phases are also thermodynamically more stable than the TiOy phases and require more negative potential to reduce. Both effects account partly for the low speed or long time electro-reduction of TiO2, and the low current efficiency in the presence of the electronic conduction. This negative effect can be mostly avoided by ex situ “perovskitisation”, a process to convert TiO2 to perovskite by reaction with CaO at elevated temperatures.28 In the preliminary test, it was found that the electrolysis of porous CaTiO3 was much shorter in time, leading to almost a double increase in current efficiency without compromising the product quality.
The electrochemical and/or chemical formation of perovskite phases CaTiO3−x may lead to a new way to synthesize inorganic functional materials such as catalyst. There also exist the electrochemically driven direct interactions between the alkaline earth or alkali cation and TiOy. Indeed, when TiO2 electrolysis was carried out in molten LiCl in which the Li+ ion is even smaller, formation of stoichiometric compounds, LiTi2O4 and LiTiO2, was confirmed by X-ray and electron diffraction analyses and elemental analysis (Fig. 8).62 This process, although much faster because of the molten salt at higher temperatures, is obviously the same as the well known electrochemical intercalation of Li+ ions into the LixCoO2 phase in the common lithium ion batteries. Of course, changes in structure and conductivity from TiO2 to LixTiO2 are necessary and the results from cyclic voltammetry suggest the changes to be fairly fast in molten LiCl at 700 °C. More recently, the application of direct electrochemical reduction of solid titania was also successful for preparing titanium in molten LiCl–Li2O63 and titanium coating on stainless steel.64

          Silicon
        

          Silicon plays essential roles in the fabrication of solar cells, silicon chips, optical fibres, silicones, and is important as an element in lighter and stronger alloys, as well as hundreds of other advanced applications.65,66 The industrial production of silicon is at present mainly through the carbothermic reduction of SiO2 at 1700 °C, in which the oxygen is removed by the generation of CO2.67,68 Although silica is a very good insulator (the electrical conductivity is in the range 10−10 to 10−11 Ω−1cm−1 at 850 °C) and insoluble in molten CaCl2, it was found that quartz can be directly reduced to Si by electrodes of either Mo wire in contact with quartz (Fig. 9)69 or a quartz sheathed W wire (see later discussion about Fig. 28 and 29).70 From the cyclic voltammogram in Fig. 10, the direct electrochemical reduction of SiO2 occurs at far more positive potentials than that of deposition of calcium, and a high current density, ∼80 A cm−2 was observed. Upon applying constant voltage or potentiostatic electrolysis, pure silicon has been obtained either using quartz69,72,73,75,77 or SiO2 powder70,71,76 as raw material (Fig. 11), either at the temperature of 900 °C or 450–500 °C.69,75 The typical electricity consumption for producing 1 kg silicon is about 13 kWh,70 which is expected to decrease further upon optimization and hence has lower energy consumption than the current industrial method as well as reducing the carbon dioxide emission. Another potential advantage of the method is to directly produce solar grade silicon for a lower contamination process. It was reported recently that a 99.80 at.% purity silicon ingot was obtained by smelting the product from electrolysis of solar grade SiO2, the impurities were mostly from the contamination of the reactor and anode.77

It has been found that the formed Si basically has a hexagonal prismatic and stacking structure. The single crystal Si columns lay perpendicular to the reduction interface between Si and SiO2 layers (Fig. 12). The Si column has a column axis of {111} direction while the original SiO2 is amorphous. The single crystalline Si has {111} twin planes perpendicular to the axis of the column. The interval of {111} twin planes is from a few atomic layers to about 150 nm. The Si column bends repeatedly at twin planes.74 Also, solid intermediate CaSiO3 was detected in the partially reduced samples.78 Based on these experimental findings, the mechanism of direct electrolytic reduction of solid SiO2 to Si in molten CaCl2 at 1123 K was described as (Fig. 13):74,78 amorphous Si is first formed by electrochemical reduction and is immediately transformed to crystalline Si at high temperature via the bond-breaking process.

          Niobium and tantalum

          Niobium (Nb) and tantalum (Ta) are known as the valve metals with very high melting point and other unique properties. Besides being used as an additive to steels, there is an increasing tendency to use these metals as a functional material. Many high performance capacitors for electronic applications are made from Ta and Nb powders. NbTi alloys and Nb3Sn intermetallics are the superconducting materials commercially available.79 Currently, both of Nb and Ta are primarily produced by metallothermic reduction. For example, Nb metal is commercially produced by the aluminothermic reduction of the pentoxide Nb2O5, followed by electron beam refining, but the products could still contain up to ∼2 wt% aluminium and ∼1% oxygen as impurities.80 Reductant contamination in niobium is not easily avoidable either by the metallothermoreduction or cabothermoreduction. In the late 1990s, based on the principle of galvanic cell, electronically mediated reaction of Nb2O5 by Ca metal or Ca alloys in molten CaCl2 or CaCl2–NaCl was demonstrated.12 The reduction reaction was driven by the emf of the cell but kinetically limited by the polarization on the electrode and IR drop through the circuit.
Since 2002, direct electro-reduction of porous Nb2O5 pellets to the Nb powder in CaCl2 based molten salts at a cell voltage of 3.0–3.2 V has been reported.81–88 However, in these early experiments, the electrolysis always lasted for 48 h or longer to reach a satisfactorily low level of oxygen in the product at the cell voltage beyond 3.0 V. Others reported that the addition of carbon, CaCO3 or CaO powder to the Nb2O5 precursor could increase the oxygen vacancies and hence accelerate electro-reduction but still got a very high oxygen content in the product and low current efficiency.89,90 Direct electrochemical reduction of solid Nb2O5 was also carried out in a melt of LiCl–Li2O by constant current electrolysis with a porous magnesia membrane and three platinum anodes.91 A recent report described the potentiostatic electrolysis of Nb2O5 using a metallic cavity electrode in molten CaCl2 with the potentials being selected according to cyclic voltammetry.92 It was found that metallisation of Nb2O5 could be achieved at a constant and fairly low cell voltage of 2.4 V and hence reduce the energy consumption. However, the two-electrode cell configuration is much simpler and preferred for industrial operation. More recently it was found that the cell voltage varied in close accordance with electrolysis current during potentiostatic electrolytic reduction of Nb2O5 to Nb metal in a three-electrode cell (Fig. 14) and the energy consumption is significant lower than that under constant voltage electrolysis in a two-electrode cell.93

Furthermore, a simple but effective alternative was proposed by applying a computer-aided control (CAC) of the two-electrode cell voltage using a programme mimicking the cell voltage variation of potentiostatic electrolysis in the three-electrode cell. With this method, niobium powder (Fig. 15) with oxygen content around 3900 ppm and energy consumption as low as 6.03 kWh/kg-Nb was obtained within 5–10 h electrolysis. TEM characterization (Fig. 15c) of the electrolysis product revealed nanometre oxide coatings on the surfaces of the obtained individual Nb powder particles that contributed to the overall oxygen content in the product, suggesting the oxygen was mostly from the product treatment after electrolysis.

The cathodic reduction reactions were found to proceed with NbO2, NbO and CaδNbOx (1 < x ≤ 2.5, x/δ ≥ 2) as the intermediate products as explained below.92,93 Nb2O5 + 2e → 2NbO2 + O2−(4) NbO2 + 2e → NbO + O2−(5) NbO + 2e → Nb + O2−(6)In partially reduced samples, various perovskites, i.e. CaNb2O6, Ca2Nb2O7 (= nCaO·Nb2O5, n = 1,2) and CaNbO3 (= CaO·NbO2), were found and thought to have formed via the chemical reaction between Nb2O5 or NbO2 and CaOvia the following reactions. Nb2O5 + nCaO → nCaO·Nb2O5 (n = 1, 2)(7) NbO2 + CaO → CaO·NbO2(8)The formation of perovskites also can be through an electrochemical way, for non-stoichiometric perovskites, a more general form of the reaction can be expressed as below. NbOx + δCa2+ + 2δe → CaδNbOx (1 < x ≤ 2.5, x/δ ≥ 2)(9)Similar to the reduction of Nb2O5, thin and porous Ta2O5 pellets was facilely electro-reduced to fine Ta powders in molten CaCl2 at a mild temperature (1123 K) at the potential more positive than that for calcium deposition.94,95 Studies by cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic electrolysis show that before complete metallization of the oxide pellet,94 several calcium-enriched solid oxide phases with a likely general formula of CaδTaOx were formed through an electrochemically driven oxide–Ca2+ interaction (either insertion or inclusion of the Ca2+ in the solid phase). The next intermediate product is TaO whose reduction leads to the Ta powder. The electrolytic Ta powders consist of sub-micrometer nodular particles (∼200 nm) that are interconnected to larger aggregates (2–5 μm), and the oxygen content can be easily reduced to about 1200 ppm.94
It was found under TEM that the obtained tantalum powder particles were individually covered by a thin oxide layer with a thickness of several nanometers, suggesting reoxidation during postelectrolysis processing. The electrolytic Ta powders exhibited a specific capacitance close to 40 kμFV/g. The electrolysis current efficiency and energy consumption were satisfactory, for example, achieving ~78% and ~2.4 kWh/kg-Ta.94 Ta powders with higher capacitance can be achievable by using finer Ta2O5 powder as the feed material. This completely new, fast, and fluoride-free molten salt electrolytic process is foreseeable for commercial production of high quality Ta powders. It should be mentioned that the carbon content in the product is still too high for capacitor application due to using graphite as anode. Improvement can be achieved by using a yttrium stabilised zirconia (YSZ) separated anode 96–98 or tin oxide ceramic anode.99,100
3.4 
          Chromium and molybdenum

          Chromium (Cr) and molybdenum (Mo) are very important refractory metals and mostly used as an alloying agent in cast iron, steels and superalloys to enhance hardenability, strength, toughness and corrosion resistance.101 They are currently produced by metallothermical reduction or hydrogen reduction at elevated temperatures.
Successful direct electrochemical reduction of porous Cr2O3 porous pellets to chromium powder in molten CaCl2 and a molten equimolar mixture of CaCl2 and NaCl was first reported in 2004.16 The reduction mechanism was discussed based on the voltammetry investigation and the analysis of the intermediate product of the electrolysis, calcium chromites of various stoichiometries. Furthermore, optimal conditions for the electrochemical reduction of solid Cr2O3 to chromium metal in molten CaCl2 were obtained:102 pellet sintering temperature 1000–1100 °C (particle size below 5 μm), cell voltage 2.7–2.8 V, molten salt temperature 850–950 °C, electrolysis time 4–6 h.
It was also found that the reduction proceeded through the propagation of the three-phase interline between the metal, oxide, and molten salt phases. Fine cubic chromium powder with 2000 ppm oxygen was obtained at the optimized operation condition with a current efficiency as high as ∼74%.102 The electrochemical reduction mechanism was also investigated by the metallic cavity electrode58,103 in molten CaCl2 with < 0.3% MgCl2. It was further confirmed58,104 that nodular and cubic chromium powder could be obtained within minutes in the cavity electrode. Crystals of magnesium chromites were observed in the incompletely reduced products.
Recently the FFC Process has been successfully applied to reduce solid metal sulfide to metal for the first time, e.g. MoS2 to Mo in CaCl2 based molten salt (800–900 °C).105 MoO3 is very volatile and the melting point is only 795 °C (Table 1). In fact Mo is mostly present as disulfide (MoS2, 0.01–0.50 wt%) in the respective molybdenite ores in nature.106 In the experiment, sintered (300 °C) porous pellets of MoS2 were electrolysed to elemental S and Mo under argon at 1.0–3.0 V for 1–20 h. On a graphite anode, the product was primarily S and evaporated from the molten salt, allowing the electrolysis to continue. It then condensed to solid at the lower temperature regions of the system. The anode remained intact after repeated uses. The MoS2 pellet was highly conducting at high temperatures and could be fast electroreduced to fine Mo powders (0.1–1.0 μm) in which the S content could be below 1000 ppm (Fig. 16). No reduction occurred at voltages below 0.5 V. Partial reduction was seen at 0.5–0.7 V, and converted MoS2 to a mixture of MoS2 and Mo3S4, or Mo3S4 and Mo with the Mo content increasing with the voltage. Cyclic voltammetry of the MoS2 powder in a Mo-cavity electrode, together with the electrolysis results, revealed the reduction mechanism to include two steps: MoS2 to Mo3S4 at −0.28 V (potential vs.Ag/AgCl), and then to Mo at −0.43 V.

3.5 
          Rare earth metals

Heavy rare-earth (HRE) metals function very efficiently in advanced materials for magnetooptical-information storage, giant magnetostrictive energy conversion, and high-strength permanent magnets.107,108 Current industrial methods convert HRE oxides into fluorides (e.g. by reaction with HF or NH4F), from which the metal is extracted by calciothermic reduction at ∼1500 °C in argon.109,110 The obtained HRE metal needs further separation from excess calcium under vacuum and deoxygenation by special methods.111 The study of direct electrochemical reduction of solid rare earth oxides to the respective metals in molten salts is not only practically important but also scientifically interesting. As shown in Table 1, most of rare earth oxides are even more stable than CaO thermodynamically and thus cannot be reduced by liquid calcium, which means that the rare earth oxides have to be reduced electrochemically in the molten salt. Recently this group reported the successful preparation of active rare earth metal, terbium by direct electrolysis of solid terbium oxide pellet in molten CaCl2 under the deposition of calcium (Fig. 17).112 However, overdeposited liquid Ca blocked ionic exchange between the pellet and the molten salt (Fig. 17c) and effectively retarded the reduction process. The reduction rate increased linearly with the cell voltage until 3.6 V, while it remained unchanged or decreased beyond 3.6 V. This strongly supports the view that the direct electrochemical reduction of the solid oxide occurs while it deserves a careful control of the cathode potential to achieve a high reduction rate and current efficiency. The reduction rate of a cathode pellet with high porosity (∼71%) was much higher than that with lower porosity (∼44%), at least during the first several hours. It was also found that the metal produced was porous but was not wetted by molten CaCl2, thus allowing cleaning or leaching in DMSO. This process also suits the extraction of other heavy rare earth metals such as Dy and Y metals from their oxides. In all cases, electrolysis energy consumption was satisfactorily low, typically ∼30 kWh/kg-Tb.

Another example for electrochemical reduction of a solid rare earth oxide is the preparation of U, Np, Pu by the electrolysis of their oxides in molten CaCl2–CaO and/or molten LiCl–Li2O.112–117 For example, UO2 was reduced into metal over the potential range <0.15 V vs. the Li+/Li.116 During the UO2reduction in the CaCl2 salt bath, the reduced uranium metal cohered due to the high operating temperature and a dense metal skin covered the surface of the UO2 sample. This prevented the discharge of oxygen from inside and the reduction often stopped with UO2 remaining inside. It was indicated that UO2 with high porosity or in the form of fine particles was suitable for complete reduction. UO2 was satisfactorily reduced into metal in the LiCl salt bath. The reduced uranium metal did not concentrate at the surface and the salt could permeate inside. Then, the oxygen was easily transported to the bulk salt and the reduction was completed. The current efficiency in LiCl was much higher than in CaCl2.
4. Alloys by direct reduction of solid compounds and/or mixed oxides
A very profound advantage of the FFC Cambridge Process is to make alloys by direct electrochemical reduction of the mixed or complex oxides of the metals through a simple reduction step.14,15,118–121 It can be simply presented as: M1x1Oy1 + M2x2Oy2 + ⋯ +MNxNOyN + 2(y1 + y2 + ⋯ + yN)e → M1x1M2x2⋯MNxN + (y1 + y2 + ⋯ + yN)O2−(10)Or (M1x1M2x2…MNxN)O(y1+y2+⋯+yN) + 2(y1 + y2 + ⋯ + yN)e → M1x1M2x2⋯MNxN + (y1 + y2 + ⋯ + yN)O2−(10a)where M represents metal, MNxNOyN represents metal oxide, (M1x1M2x2…MNxN)O(y1+y2+⋯+yN) is complex oxide. Reaction (10) means the cathode pellet is made from the simple mixture of the oxides with the metal composition matching that of the target alloy or intermetallic compound. However, reaction (10a) represents a poly-metal oxide compound that is either a raw material such as a natural ore or formed by the pellet sintering process or pre-synthesis at high temperature. As shown later, this is quite important for the accurate control of the alloy composition, especially where there exist “unstable” simple metal oxides in the raw materials that have unfavourable properties such as low melting point, high solubility in the melt or are chemically unstable in the melt at elevated temperatures.
Taking the excellent shape memory alloy, TiNi, as an example, a comparison between the conventional preparation method and the FFC method is schematically shown in Fig. 18.122 The conventional methods require high vacuum conditions supported by special equipment, expensive pure titanium and nickel as the feed, and a large amount of energy input. Instead of preparation of the pure metal separately, the new process directly makes the alloy powder from the pellet with a designed composition through direct electrochemical reduction in one step. Apparently the short process can largely reduce the cost and energy consumption.
 Fig. 18  
          TiNi alloy production by conventional methods (a) and by the FFC method (b). (Reprinted from ref. 122 with permission from Springer Science + Business Media. Copyright 2006.) 
Furthermore, it also makes the solid electrochemical reduction reaction more favorable thermodynamically and kinetically. There always exists a nobility difference of the metal components among the metal oxides, i.e. the decomposition voltages of titanium oxide and nickel oxide differ by 1.6 V at 900 °C. Preferential reduction of a noble metal oxide is expected. This will benefit the reduction of the less noble metal oxide and the whole pellet because of the depolarization effect of alloy formation and improvement of electronic conductivity within the pellet. Fig. 19 gives an example of TiNi alloy formation during electrolysis of the mixed powders of TiO2 and NiO in molten CaCl2 at 900 °C.122 Upon the application of a constant cell voltage of 2.9 V, NiO was reduced within minutes, and then Ni3Ti was formed together with unreduced TiO2 in the form of CaTiO3 within 1 h. The complete reduction of the pellet to form TiNi took place within 4 h, while the TiO2 pellet with the same size and structure required around 10 h. Indeed, the electrolysis voltage for reduction of the mixture of TiO2 and NiO can be as low as 2.2 V. With an optimization current efficiency of 80%, the energy consumption for producing 1 kg TiNi by this method can be as low as ∼6 kWh.

Up till now, a lot of structural or functional alloys or intermetallic compounds such as Nb3Sn,82,83,87,88Ni3Al, Ti-6Al-4V,121TiNi,121,122,124TiFeNi,123TiW,32NbTi,83Ni2MnGa,125TbFe2,126Tb2Fe17,127TbNi5,128LaNi5,129UPu,130,131UPuNp132 have been prepared through the method. Here we take several groups of functional materials as examples to demonstrate the alloy preparation by direct electrochemical reduction of solid mixed or compounded oxides.
4.1 Superconductive materials
The NbTi alloy and the A15-type Nb3Sn compound are being used as low temperature superconductors.133 Currently homogeneous NbTi alloys are commercially produced from powder mixtures of high purity niobium and titanium by vacuum-arc melting and electron beam melting routes. Preparation of NbTi by carbothermic reduction of mixtures of TiO2 and Nb2O5134 was not feasible because of incomplete reduction of titanium suboxide and carbon impurity. There is also a report on the magnesiothermic reduction of the mixed oxides or hydroxides of niobium and tin to Nb3Sn at 700–1100 °C.135 Deposition of Nb3Sn in an ionic liquid was reported136 with a product contaminated with impurities and it is not available for mass production. Direct electrochemical reduction of the solid oxides together with an inert anode sounds a rapid and low cost way to pure homogeneous NbTi alloys and the Nb3Sn compound. Very homogeneous NbTi alloy (Fig. 20) with only 140 ppm oxygen was obtained by the method recently.83 The superconducting properties of the obtained NbTi and Nb3Sn were also confirmed, although the melting point of tin is pretty low.

4.2 
          Hydrogen
          storage materials
In response to the growing carbon-strain to the environment, the development of electric vehicles (EVs) (including those hybrid ones) with less or zero emission has taken an accelerated pace.137 Up till now, the nickel-metal hydride (Ni–MH) rechargeable batteries are one of the most preferred options as the power source for EVs. Obviously, the commercial use of these batteries requires a large amount of advanced and, more importantly, affordable hydrogen storage materials (HSMs). In this group, the LaNi5-type and the TiFe type HSMs were successfully prepared by direct electro-reduction of sintered pellets of mixtures of solid oxides or ilmenite ore in molten CaCl2.122,123 It was well demonstrated that the process achieved readily the prescribed compositions in the produced HSM powders at very low energy consumption. Yet, the prepared LaNi5-type powders can offer excellent charge–discharge performance in laboratory Ni–MH batteries in comparison with the same materials prepared by other methods, and even with a shorter activation process.
However, there are expected difficulties in applying the experimental procedures employed in previous studies to La2O3. La2O3 is very hygroscopic, and making the oxide powder into a cathode (pellet) is highly challenging. And La2O3 can also react with molten CaCl2via a spontaneous reaction: La2O3 + CaCl2 → 2LaOCl + CaO, ΔG° (850 °C) = −33.538 kJ. This means a greater energy consumption and also possible difficulty in maintaining the cathode’s integrity in the molten salt during electrolysis. These problems were effectively solved by encouraging chemical interactions between the parent oxides during the sintering process to form a compounded oxide phase126,128 which could be less reactive than the parent oxides alone, particularly La2O3. This was achieved simply by increasing the sintering temperature and/or time. For example, after sintering at 1200 °C in air for 2 h, the pellets of mixed La2O3 and NiO powders (La:Ni = 1:5) were much more stable in both air and molten chloride salts. It was observed clearly, under SEM, the growth of the sub-micrometer oxide particles to interconnected micrometer particles, as shown in Fig. 21. This change strengthened the pellet (but also maintained a porous structure which is beneficial to electro-reduction). Formation of the compounded oxide phases in the high temperature sintered pellets was confirmed by XRD, but the stoichiometry varied with the sintering temperature. At 1200 °C, the La3Ni2O7 phase was detected in the pellet, which can be attributed to the reaction: 3La2O3 + 4NiO + 0.5O2 → 2La3Ni2O7.138 It should be noted that another benefit from compounding the mixed oxides is that in the compounded phases, the La and Ni atoms are uniformly distributed with short distance and can react quickly to form the desired alloys or intermetallics once the oxygen atoms are removed.126 It was found that the pellets were well reduced to the LaNi5 alloy at an electrolysis cell voltage as low as 2.6 V within 6 h. Apparently, the effects of Ni on depolarization and enhancing the electronic conductivity work very well here. The electrolysis energy consumption was around 5 kWh (kg-alloy)−1, less than the energy for making the current cheapest commercial metal, crude steel (>5.5 kWh (kg-steel)−1).

The intrinsic LaNi5 compound can be much improved for hydrogen storage by partial substitution of Ni with Co, Mn and/or Al. To confirm the same effect applies to the electrolytic product, LaNi4Co and MmNi3.55Co0.75Mn0.40Al0.30 (Mm: mischmetal or mixed rare earth metals) were prepared in the same way as described above from the mixture of the respective oxide powders. The prepared electrolytic powders were made directly into the cathode and tested for hydrogen storage performance in a laboratory Ni–MH battery. Fig. 22 plots the discharge capacity of each sample against the number of charge–discharge cycles at 25 °C. It can be seen that the LaNi4Co electrode reaches 325 mAh g−1 after 3 activation cycles and slowly decreases to 280 mAh g−1 after 60 charge–discharge cycles. The theoretical electrochemical hydrogen storage capacity for charging LaNi5 to LaNi5H6 is 371.9 mAh g−1, which is not too far away from the maximum discharging capacities measured from the electrolytic LaNi4Co powders. In fact, the whole picture of the electrochemical hydrogen storage performance compares very well with that of the same or similar LaNi5-type materials prepared by other methods.

4.3 Magnetic materials

          Ni2MnGa is the first reported magnetic alloy prepared by the FFC Cambridge Process.125 Again it demonstrated that materials with components of greatly different melting points can be produced by the direct electrochemical reduction. After that, some rare earth based magnetic materials such as TbF2126 and TbNi5128 have been synthesized by this method. The precise control of the composition and the reduction process of the mixtures were well demonstrated. Cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 23a) of Fe2O3, Tb4O7, Fe2O3 + Tb4O7 and Fe + Tb4O7 powder in the metallic cavity electrode show that the reduction of Fe2O3 and Tb4O7 (actually Tb2O3) starts at 1.3 V and ∼0 V vs.Ca2+/Ca, respectively. The reduction peak on the CV of the mixed powder at 0.4 V is a result from the reduction of Tb2O3 on the preformed or added iron metal. This is caused by the depolarization effect of formation of Tb–Fe compounds. It was further evidenced by the electrolysis result with a constant cell voltage of 2.6 V (Fig. 23b). From XRD analyses of the intermediate products (Fig. 23d) obtained by terminating the electrolysis at different times based on the current–time curve, the alloy formation mechanism was evaluated as shown in Fig. 23c and presented below: Fe2O3 + 6e− → 2Fe + 3O2−(11) 17Fe + Tb2O3 + 6e− → Tb2Fe17 + 3O2−(12) 6Tb2Fe17 + 11Tb2O3 + 66e− → 34TbFe3 + 33O2−(13) 4TbFe3 + Tb2O3 + 6e− → 6TbFe2 + 3O2−(14) xFe2O3·yTb2O3 + 6xe− → 2xFe + yTb2O3 + 3xO2−(15) xFe2O3·yTb2O3 + 6(x + n)e− → 2TbnFex + (y − n)Tb2O3 + 3(x + n)O2−(16) (2n − x)Fe + TbnFex → nTbFe2(17)Experiments also confirmed that pre-compounding of the mixed oxide powders viasintering at 1200 °C could lead to more complete reduction of the oxide mixture to the TbFe2 stoichiometry according to the ICP-AAS analysis. The electrolysis product can be conveniently cleaned in DMSO under magnetic stirring (Fig. 24). The oxygen content in such prepared TbFe2 powder reached 1300 ppm. The Tb recovery yield of the electrolysis was generally high and increases with the voltage applied, leading to a value over 97% of TbFe2 recovery for electrolysis at 3.2 V for 12 h. The electrolysis energy consumption also depended strongly on electrolysis conditions, particularly voltage, and can be lower than 14 kWh/kg TbFe2 at 2.6 V.

5. Theoretical considerations of the electrolysis of solid oxide in molten CaCl2
5.1 Thermodynamics
Considering both cathode and anode reactions in the electrolysis of a solid metal oxide, MOx (M = any metal), in a molten salt, such as molten CaCl2, the FFC Cambridge Process is best represented by the following reactions.
Overall reaction: MOx → M +x/2O2(18)Cathode reaction: MOx(s) + 2xe → M(s) +xO2−(19)Anode reaction: xO2− → x/2O2 + 2xe(20)Reaction (20) does occur by engaging an oxygen conductive electrode or an inert anode. Although, the inert anode is still a challenge for industrialization, progress is evident for different anode materials and many interesting results have been presented in the literature. Currently, most of the researchers are using graphite anodes. There are thermodynamic benefits according to the anode depolarization, but emission of carbon oxides will occur due to reactions (21) and (22): x/2C + xO2− → x/2CO2 + 2xe(21) xC + xO2− → xCO + 2xe(22)Reactions (20)–(22) are all well investigated gas evolution reactions due to their importance in aluminium production. However, there are important significances to investigate reaction (19) in detail for the theoretical understanding of the FFC Cambridge Process.
As discussed in previous sections, extensive works on the thermodynamics, electrode kinetics, reduction mechanism and the relevant electrode designs of the FFC Cambridge Process have been carried out for the preparation of metals, semi-metals and alloys, such as Ti, Ta, Si, LaNi5 and so on. The scientific and technical novelty of this new process is the direct reduction of solid oxide in molten salt. This concept has been transplanted, resulting in such as the OS4–8 and the EMR,9–13 processes to produce Ti, Ta and Nb powder in molten CaCl2.
The EMR process is quite similar to the FFC process in principle, in which, the cathodic reaction is almost the same as the FFCreaction (19). The anodic reaction is the oxidation of Ca, as shown by reaction (23). Ca → Ca2+ + 2e(23)The calcium in reaction (23) is produced by electrolysis of such as CaO in CaCl2 as represented by reactions (24) and (25). Ca2+ → Ca − 2e(24) C + 2O2− → CO2 + 4e(25)It can be seen that the EMR process includes two separate steps, one is the production of metallic calcium, and the second is the electron mediated calciothermic reduction of solid metal oxide in molten CaCl2. The role of CaCl2 in the EMR process is to dilute the by product of CaO so that the reduction of the metal oxide will not be blocked by the deposition of CaO.
The OS process is a calciothermic reduction process while the calcium is produced by in situ electrolysis of the generated CaO in CaCl2. The reactions are: Ca2+ → Ca − 2e(26) C + 2O2− → CO2 + 4e(27) xCa + MOx(s) → M(s) + xCa2+ + xO2−(28)In the OS process, the formed Ca viareaction (26) should dissolve in the molten CaCl2 which can then move to the solid oxide, MOx, to enable reaction (28). However, the Ca in the molten salt will cause some undesirable by-reactions. For example, if a graphite anode is engaged, these by-reactions should at least include Ca → Ca2+ + 2e (on the anode)(29) Ca + C (graphite) → CaC(30) 3Ca + CO2 → CaC + 2CaO(31)It is understandable that reactions (29)–(31) will result in low current efficiency as well as excessive consumption or erosion of the graphite anode and crucible. Dissolved calcium in molten CaCl2 is also responsible for a large part of the electronic conductivity through the melt, resulting in short-circuiting and diminishing the current efficiency further. On the other hand, it must be pointed out that the combination of reactions (26) and (28) leads to the direct electrochemical reaction (19), which questions the necessity of reaction (26).
The direct electrochemical reduction of solid oxide in molten chlorides [reaction (19)] can be seen as an oxygen ionization process. Despite the claimed differences amongst the three processes, it is clear that theoretical understanding of the mechanism for the oxygen ionization process is of great academic and industrial significance to all of them, hence to develop a novel metallurgical process especially for some metals and alloys with great difficulties in present industry.

Reaction (19) is a reaction occurring at the M/MOx/O2−electrode in molten CaCl2. However, this kind of electrode is quite familiar in aqueous solutions, such as Ag/AgCl/Cl−electrode and Pb/PbSO4/SO42−. It is well known that the reduction of AgCl to Ag or PbSO4 to Pb is quite easy, although these metals are not produced in such a manner. There is not any reason that reaction (19) for M/MOx/O2−electrode would have great difficulties. The question is the influence of the possible by-reactions, such as the evolution of Ca, on the current and energy efficiencies. It should be pointed out that the in situ cathodic formation of Ca does not necessarily ensure the occurrence of the calciothermic reduction of the solid metal oxide, although Ca is thermodynamically capable of reducing the oxide. The Pb/PbSO4/SO42−electrode shows a good example. The evolution of H2 (a side-cathode reaction in acidic aqueous solutions) will accompany the electro-reduction of PbSO4 to Pb, but the evolution of the H2 gas means the inertness of hydrogen to solid PbSO4 at the cathode.
In the FFC process, if formed, the role of Ca is two-fold: one is that the formed calcium can assist the reduction of the metal oxidevia the calciothermic reduction, so this part of the calcium formation reaction is not really a by-reaction; the other is the excessive calcium which would not take part in the oxide reduction, and the reaction to generate this kind of calcium will lead to the loss of the current efficiency.
Efforts should be made to avoid the generation of excessive calcium, and analysis of the thermodynamic data would be an effective approach. Fig. 25 shows the oxygen–titanium phase diagram, showing various oxides of the multivalent Ti. Linking Gibbs free energy data of these Ti-oxides to the logarithms of composition of CaO leads to a predominance diagram for the Ti–Ca–O–Cl system as shown in Fig. 26.31

It can be seen from Fig. 26 that in the medium pO2− region of 4.5 to 9.2, with the potential becoming negative, TiO2 will be reduced to Ti3O5, Ti2O3, TiO, Ti3O2 in sequence, and pure titanium (with a oxygen content below 100 ppm) can be attained at a potential higher than −2.75 V, which is about 0.5 V higher than the equilibrium potential of Ca, and even higher than the potential of the Ca/Ca2+ electrode with an activity of 10−5 aCa. This is strong theoretical evidence that no metal Ca formation is needed for the reduction of TiO2 to pure Ti in this pO2− range.
It was suggested that for the FFC Cambridge Process, a starting value of 0.5 mol% CaO in the CaCl2 would give the best results in terms of current efficiency and final oxygen content, as well as the elimination of chlorine emission. The pO2− in this melt was estimated to be about 2∼3. In this case, titanium with oxygen content of 2000 ppm can be achieved at −2.9 V from Fig. 26, which is about the potential of Ca/Ca2+ electrode with an aCa of about 10−3.
It can be concluded that TiO2 can be reduced to metal titanium with 99.8% in purity under a potential before the decomposition of the melt. To produce titanium by the FFC Cambridge Process, the activity of calcium in the melt can be kept below 10−3 so the annoyances caused by the generation of metal calcium as analyzed above can be avoided. Higher potential would benefit the dynamics of the electrochemical reduction of the oxide, accordingly, the current for the formation of calcium will become higher. However, if the generated calcium would contribute to the reduction of TiO2, then, no lose current efficiency happens. Otherwise, the evolution of calcium will lead to low current and energy efficiencies. Obviously, a balance between the production rate and the energy efficiency should be established for optimisation of the FFC Cambridge Process.
The electrochemical reduction of TiO2 should be complex according to Fig. 26, which suggests a series of continuous ionization processes. However, to understand the oxygen ionization process, a simple system should be preferred. The reduction of SiO2 should be such a system.
According to the O–Si phase diagram, Fig. 27, the reduction of SiO2 to Si is a one-step reaction, and the potential for the reduction of SiO2 is far more positive than the generation of metal calcium by comparing the Gibbs formation energies between the SiO2 and CaO. Consequently, the influence of calcium on the reduction of solid SiO2 is negligible in a large range of potentials. That is, the SiO2 (solid)–CaCl2 (liquid) system provides an ideal case for studying the direct electrochemical oxygen ionization process in molten melts. In the following part, a dynamic three phase interline (3PI) model will be established and discussed based on the SiO2-molten salt system for a better understanding of the hypostases of the direct electrolysis of solid oxides in molten salts.

5.2 Models of dynamic three phase interlines (3PIs)139,140
The thermodynamic aspects have been discussed above. Here, the kinetics of the FFC Cambridge Process will be demonstrated in detail. As discussed above, the electrode process for reaction (19) involves three phases: the metal, the metal oxide and the electrolyte containing the oxygen ions. If the oxide is an insulator, then the metal will serve as the current collector. To reduce the oxide, electrons will be injected from the metal to the oxide, and oxygen ions will transfer from the oxide to the electrolyte at the same time. Good initial contacts between the current collector and the oxide are essential for the oxygen ionization at the cathode.
A previously fabricated W–SiO2electrode in this laboratory represents a good example electrode to study the electrochemical reduction of insulating oxide in the molten CaCl2. Fig. 28 illustrates schematically the W–SiO2electrode: a tungsten wire of 100 to 300 μm in diameter was sealed in a quartz tube on a gas flame. The end face of the tungsten wire (W-disc) was revealed by grinding. This W–SiO2electrode was then inserted into molten CaCl2 for the electrochemical studies with only the W-disc in electric contact with the molten salt.
 Fig. 28  A schematic drawing of the W–SiO2electrode. 

Fig. 29a is the SEM image of the end of the W–SiO2electrode. It shows a very intimate contact between the quartz and the W disc (end of the W wire), which ensures an intuitional observation of the reduction of solid SiO2.

(d) A side view of the situation in (c). (Reprinted from ref. 70 with permission from Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Copyright 2004.) 
The changes on the W–SiO2electrode after electro-reduction are shown in Fig. 29b, c and d. The conclusions from Fig. 29 includes: (1) the reduction of the quartz begins at the initial W/SiO2/CaCl2 three phases interlines. The generated silicon with electronic conductivity then serves as new current collector and the following reduction happens at the Si/SiO2/CaCl2 3PIs. (2) It is clear that the 3PIs develop on the end surface of the W–SiO2electrode as concentric circles or rings surrounding the W-disc. (3) The silicon formed is porous despite the dense quartz, which can be explained by the molar volume ratio between quartz and silicon considering that there is no macroscopic volume change to the whole body of the electrode. The electrolyte will enter the pores in the silicon layer automatically, hence the formed Si/SiO2/CaCl2 3PIs are also in the inner part of the electrode. (4) It is the movement of the 3PIs both in the transverse and depth directions that leads to the complete electro-reduction of the bulk oxide electrode. (5) There is a greater reaction resistance along the depth direction than the transverse direction as indicated in Fig. 29c and d, which shows a transverse reaction width of 200 μm, but a reaction depth of only 16 μm. A dynamic 3PIs picture in the three dimension space is strongly impressed by Fig. 29. The great difference between the movement of 3PIs on the surface and into the depth suggests that they should follow different laws of kinetics. Thus, two models namely “thin layer 3PIs (T3PI) model” and “penetrating 3PIs (P3PI) model” have been established to focus the study on the two aspects, respectively. Full understanding of the P3PIs which shows a “rate determining step (RDS)” is also of great significance to the potential realization of the FFC Cambridge Process.
For simplification, the dynamics of the 3PIs model presented in this article are based on the following assumptions: (1) a solid compound phase (SCP) which is electronically insulating but electrochemically active, (2) a solid metal phase (SMP) of good electrochemical inertness under the studied potential range, and (3) a liquid electrolyte phase (LEP) which is capable of transporting substances or ions resulting from the electrochemical conversion between the two solid phases; (4) neglectable ionic conductivity in the SCP compared with that in the LEP. Further, in the system, (5) electron transfer occurs only between the SCP and the SMP at the 3PI and results in conversion between the two solid phases, accompanied by mass transfer between the SCP and the LEP to maintain electric neutrality in the solid phases; (6) both the SCP and the SMP are insoluble or negligibly soluble in the LEP, and the LEP contains no (or negligible) electrochemically active species other than that exchangeable with the SCP.
Practical 3PI systems satisfying the above definitions are plentiful, but two of these are worth mentioning. The first is the above discussed electro-reduction of solid silica (plate or powder) to silicon in molten calcium chloride. SiO2(SCP) + 4e → Si(SMP) + 2O2− (LEP)(32)The interest in reaction (32) is the possibility of the elimination or decrease of the use of carbon from the silicon production industry without compromising the product quality and energy consumption. The second example exists in the classic Ag/AgCl/KCl reference electrode. AgCl(SCP) + e → Ag(SMP) + Cl− (LEP)(33)The differences between the two systems are the reaction temperature and the concentration of the ionized species in the LEP. For SiO2reduction, the molten salt is at high temperatures (500–900 °C) and is required to contain as little as possible of the oxygen ion, while a relatively high chloride concentration is needed for the Ag/AgCl reference electrode to export a stable potential at room temperature. Because AgCl is insoluble in water [solubility product: Ksp(25 °C) = 1.8 × 10−10], a chloride salt such as KCl is added to the solution. However, these two systems are both studied to verify the dynamic models introduced in this paper. For unification, reactions (19), (32) and (33) are represented by reaction (34) MX(SCP) + ze → M(SMP) + Xz−(LEP)(34)Generally, for an electrode reaction going through the dynamic development of 3PIs, the overall reaction rate should mainly be controlled by (1) the intrinsic kinetic parameters concerning electron transfer at the 3PIs (such as i0 and α, and (2) the mass transfer processes through the electrolyte in the reduction generated porous metal (such as the solution and solid phase resistivity, ρ, and the diffusion coefficient, D). These factors also lead to three kinds of polarization, namely electrochemical polarization, concentration polarization and ohmic drop as in the traditional electrochemical systems. The novel kinetic features of the dynamic 3PI model are also explored by dividing the reduction to be controlled by only electrochemical process (T3PI model) or neglectable electrochemical polarization (P3PI model), respectively.

5.2.1 The thin layer 3PIs (T3PIs) model139. 
5.2.1.1 Theoretical consideration. 
The T3PIs model aims to describe the kinetic behaviour of the movement of 3PIs on a surface layer of a metal compound electrode. As shown in Fig. 29, the reduction of the metal compound on the surface is much easier, indicating the possible negligible concentration polarization and liquid ionic resistance. To simplify the situation, one may consider a very thin and porous film of the solid compound phase (SCP, insulating and electrochemically active) that is either free-standing or supported on an insulating and electrochemically inert substrate. The film thickness is so small that mass transfer between the SCP and the liquid electrolyte phase (LEP) and mass transport (diffusion) within the porous SCP impose effectively no influence. Furthermore, one can make the solid metal phase (SMP) into a pin that is placed on top of the SCP film. With the progress of the electrode reaction, the SCP at the contact region is converted to the SMP, and the 3PI expands radially along the SCP/LEP interface. Under the given conditions, the reaction rate should only be related to the number of reaction sites along the 3PI (or the length of the 3PI).

Fig. 30 shows schematically a setup in accordance with the above simplification. According to Faraday’s law, at a given potential for a reduction process, the amount of charge transferred is in direct proportion to the quantity of reduced material within a given time. For a coating with a thickness of h, if one assumes (1) a constant line current density, i, along the 3PI at an applied constant potential, (2) a fixed number, m, of parallel planes under the surface, which is equivalent to the 3PI having a reaction zone of h/m in “thickness” or “diameter” surrounding the atoms along the 3PI, and (3) each plane has only one 3PI, the application of Faraday’s law to Fig. 6 leads to the following equation: (1)where D(t) and πD(t) are, respectively the time dependent diameter and circumference of the circular 3PI, M is the molar mass of MX, considering reaction (34). h and ρ are, respectively the thickness and apparent density of the porous MX coating on the substrate, and z and F are, respectively the number of electrons transferred and the Faraday constant. Eqn (1) is based on the assumption that the 3PI in each plane has the same length and varies at the same speed and direction in length. Differentiation of both sides of eqn (1) with respective to time, t, leads to  (2)Integration of eqn (2) gives the following linear relation between D(t) and t.  (3)Eqns (2) and (3) indicate that the diameter of the 3PI grows proportionally with the time, meaning a constant rate, dD(t)/dt = VD, which is determined by the electrode reactions (z, i) and also the properties of the SCP (h, ρ, m, M). Since the total current on each 3PI is iπD(t) = iπVDt and there are m planes (3PIs), the measurable current, I, can be expressed as I = imπVDt. Combining this expression with eqn (2) or (3) leads to eqn (4) (4)Eqn (4) indicates that the total current, which is measurable, is proportional to the time, t. The relationship of the current density, i, with the 3PI growth rate, VD, from eqn (3), or with the current variation rate, I/t = VI, from eqn (4), can also be derived.  (5) (6)At a sufficiently large overpotential, (η = |E − E0|), , where E and E0 are the applied and equilibrium potentials, respectively; i0 is the exchange line current density with reference to the 3PI; α is the charge transfer coefficient; R is the gas constant; and T is the temperature. Eqns (5) and (6) can be rewritten in the following linear forms.  (7) (8)

Since both VD and VI are experimentally measurable, eqns (7) and (8) predict their semilogarithm variations with the applied overpotential. Also, from the slopes of these straight lines can be derived the values of important electrochemical parameters, for example, the product, αz, of the charge transfer coefficient, α, and the number of transferred electrons, z. Further, as the thickness and apparent density of the film can both be measured or the product of ηF can be derived from eqn (4), the value of mi0 or mi0/h can be obtained from the intercept of eqn (7) or (8), which resembles the “current density” (area) through the cross section of the thin layer.
5.2.1.2 The verification of the T3PIs model. 
To Verify the T3PIs model, an AgCl porous layer (about 50–80 μm in thickness) was coated on the glass substrate, a silver wire served as the working electrode (current collector) with its sharp tip contacting the AgCl layer. The obtained I∼t curves and D∼t correlations under different potentials against the SCE reference electrode are shown in Fig. 31. Clearly, except for the first tens of seconds, the current varies linearly with time, as expected from eqn (4). The initial deviation from the linear relationship could be related to the non-negligible thickness of the coating. As we discussed above, the initial movement of the 3PIs will go both in the transverse and along the depth direction.
 Fig. 31  Correlations of (a) the current and (b) the diameter of the reduced area with the electrolysis time at different potentials as indicated. (Reprinted from ref. 139 with permission from the American Chemical Society. Copyright 2005.) 
It can be seen in Fig. 31a that the slope of the current-time plot increases with the applied potential. A similar trend is also seen in the diameter-time plots; see Fig. 31b. Such potential dependence of the current-time and diameter-time correlations is predicted by eqns (7) and (8). According to eqns (7) and (8), the logarithm of the ratio of current and time VI = I/t or of diameter and time VD = D/t should vary linearly with the overpotential or the applied electrode potential. The values of VI and VD are actually the slopes of the straight lines in parts a and b of Fig. 31, respectively.
Indeed, as shown in Fig. 32, linear correlations were obtained when the data of different potentials were compared. The slopes of the straight lines in Fig. 32a and b are related to αz. For reaction (33), z = 1, α was found to be 0.29 ± 0.03 from the two plots. The product of mi0 was calculated to be (1.14 ± 0.31) × 10−4 A cm−1, where i0 is the exchange line current density on the 3PI and m the hypothetic number of parallel circular 3PIs. To make the mi0 value comparable to the conventional “area” exchange current density on an interface, the ratio mi0/h may be considered as the exchange area current density through the cross section of the coating. The value of mi0/h was found to be (1.42 ± 0.39) × 10−2 A cm−2, which can be compared with that of the reduction of Ag+ or its complexes (e.g., AgCN and Ag(CN)2−) in various media, 10−3–10−1 A cm−2, at the interface between an inert electrode and the electrolyte.

It should be pointed out that the thin layer model described above does not take some other possibilities into consideration. To apply the T3PI model, the condition to neglect concentration polarization and ohmic drop should be checked carefully.


5.2.2 The penetrating 3PIs (P3PIs) model72,140. 
5.2.2.1 Basics of electrochemistry at 3PIs. 
Consider a macroscopic cylinder of an insulator metal compound, MX, that can be electro-reduced according to reaction (34). The cylinder is electrochemically isolated on its sidewall with one of its end faces being exposed to a liquid electrolyte. A wire mesh of the metal (or an inert metal), functioning as the current collector, is made in contact with the exposed end face as illustrated in Fig. 33a. Under a sufficient negative potential, the reduction will start at the initial current collector|MX|electrolyte 3PIs. When the compound is reduced, the Xz− ion will move into the neighbouring electrolyte solution and transport to the bulk electrolyte. The reduction-generated metal (M) should be porous due to the decrease in molar volume from MX to M.

(b) The electric circuit simulation to (a) in which Rct is the charge transfer resistance, and ρe and ρs are, respectively the resistivities of the solid phase and the solution phase in the reduction-generated porous metal layer. (Reprinted from ref. 140 with permission from Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Copyright 2007.) 
Simultaneously, the electrolyte solution enters the pores, leading to the formation of new M|MX|electrolyte 3PIs. The reaction then continues on the newly formed 3PIs until the electrode is completely reduced.
At an arbitrary reduction depth, L (cm), there are many 3PIs between the MX and M phases. These 3PIs interconnect into a net with an apparent reaction area, A (cm2), and extend to a small thickness of δ(cm). Thus, the total reduction of the solid electrode can be described as the penetration of the 3PIs or the inward movement of the 3PI net as shown in Fig. 33a. The movement rate, v (cm s−1), of the 3PI net is defined as v = dL/dt. From Coulomb’s Law, the measured total current, I, can be correlated to the movement rate v, by eqn (9) below.  (9)where t is the time, and q (C cm−3) the charge needed to reduce a unit volume of MX to M and can be calculated from the formular mass and density of MX.
For an electrochemical process at a stationary electrode|electrolyte interface, the current density, i, on the electrode is determined by the overpotential, η = |E − Eeq|, according to the Butler-Volmer (B-V) equation. An important assumption for establishing the B-V equation is the absence or a negligible value of the ohmic polarisation, ηohm, due to the electrode–electrolyte circuit resistance. Practically, the electrode–electrolyte circuit resistance is not always negligible, but the B-V equation can still be applied, upon simple correction, to many stationary electrode|electrolyte interfacial systems. This is because the distance between the electrode|electrolyte interface and the other electrode always remains constant, so does the electrode–electrolyte circuit resistance.
However, in the dynamic 3PI system depicted by Fig. 33, the resistance of the electrolyte contained in the reduction-generated porous metal layer will increase continuously with the reduction proceeding inwardly from the end face of the cylinder. This situation is shown in Fig. 33b, which is the electric-circuit representation of the electronic and ionic conduction by two rails of serially connected resistors, joining at the reaction resistor. During reduction, the potential driven electrons flow through the porous M to the 3PIs, and combine with the MX (or Mz+) there. To maintain neutrality, the Xz− ions are rejected from the MX phase and move away from the 3PIs through the electrolyte in the pores of the porous M phase. The solid and solution resistivity in the formed porous metal layer is represented by ρe and ρs, respectively. Denoting a total resistivity ρ (= ρe + ρs), the ohmic resistance Rohm in the porous layer at the reaction depth L is, Rohm = ρL/A(10)Obviously, Rohm is a function of the reduction depth L and hence of the reaction time t. Then, if the total current flow is I, the overall ohmic polarisation ηohm can be expressed as, ηohm = IRohm = ρiL(11)As convention, the current density i and the exchange current density i0 are both defined against the apparent area A of the cross section of the cylinder in Fig. 33a. Consequently, a correction can be made to the B-V equation to include the ohmic polarisation ηohm as shown by eqn (12),  (12)CsR and C0R are the concentrations of Xz− next to the 3PIs and in the bulk solution, respectively.
In this work, it is assumed that the solution contains sufficient supporting electrolyte to eliminate the effect of electro-migration of the Xz− ions. Also, variations of the solution resistivity, the diffusion coefficient and the activity coefficient caused by the concentration change of Xz− are assumed to be negligible. Combination of the above equations leads to a new differential equation which will be highly challenging, if not impossible, to solve because CsR is a variable associated closely to the electrolysis conditions. In the following discussion, we provide approximated solutions to this equation under constant potential electrolysis or potentiostatic conditions.
It must be emphasized that although eqn (12) differs from the B-V equation only by the variable term ηohm as a correction to the overpotential, it has never been considered as a non-linear function of the current in any electrochemical system, either theoretically or experimentally. More importantly, as will be shown below, under particular conditions, eqn (12) in combination with eqns (9) and (11) can be simplified to give different forms and hence predict various simple and complex outcomes of theoretical and/or practical importance.
5.2.2.2 Potentiostatic electrolysis. 
In potentiostatic electrolysis or chronoamperometry, consider a sufficiently small increase in the reduction depth (ΔL) after the time needed for the establishment of a steady-state diffusion of Xz− in the solution. It is then reasonable to assume an approximately linear concentration distribution of Xz− in the porous layer (Fig. 34). This assumption can be mathematically verified for most situations with the diffusion coefficients being about 10−5 cm2 s−1.
 Fig. 34  Schematic illustration of the approximate concentration distributions of the reduction-generated anions at different reaction times during potentiostatic electro-reduction of a solid compound (cf.Fig. 33). Lb and L0: the practical and effective thickness of the diffusion layer in the bulk solution, respectively. (Reprinted from ref. 140 with permission from Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Copyright 2007.) 
The total thickness of the diffusion layer should be L + Lb as illustrated in Fig. 34 and Lb is the thickness of the diffusion layer in the bulk solution. For a simplified consideration, an effective thickness, L0, as shown in Fig. 34, is defined here to represent a linear extension of the anion distribution from the interior of the porous layer to the bulk solution. Then,  (13)where DR is the diffusion coefficient of Xz− in the solution in the pores of the porous metal layer.
Introduction of eqns (11) and (13) into eqn (12) leads to eqn (14),  (14)in which the correlation between i, L and t, from eqn (9), can be expressed either as a differential equation or an integral one as shown by eqn (15),  (15)Eqns (14) and (15) together demonstrate, under a constant overpotential, η, the correlations of the reaction current i and the reduction depth L with the electrolysis time t. However, the simultaneous solutions of i and L are not to be simple for eqns (14) and (15).
To simplify the case, η can be divided into three terms: (1) electrochemical polarisation ηct, (2) concentration polarisation ηc, and (3) ohmic polarisation ηohm, as expressed by eqn (16). η = ηct + ηc + ηohm(16)ηc can be determined by combining the Nernst Equation and eqn (13),  (17)while ηct is the potential deviation from ηc as the driving force for the reduction current.
5.2.2.2.1 Case I. 
If t → 0, then L → 0, ηohm is very small. Eqn (14) can be approximated as  (18)Here, eqn (18) is derived using the approximation exp(−x) = 1 − x. From eqn (18), the product iL will approximately increase linearly as the current decrease, i = a − biL(19)where a and b are constants for a given value of η and can be obtained by comparing eqn (18) with eqn (19). According to eqn (15), eqn (19) can be changed to a simple differential equation of L in correlation with t,  (20)Introducing t = 0 and L = 0 as the initial conditions, eqn (20) has a unique analytical solution,  (21)Differentiation of eqn (21) against t leads to,  (22)Case I will also be true in the following situations: (1) for a very small η, then i → 0; and (2) the system has a very small ρ (especially, ρ = 0). In both cases, the product of ρiL is very small.
5.2.2.2.2 Case II. 
According to eqn (22), when t → ∞, L → ∞, i will be very small compared with its initial level. Consequently, the electrochemical polarisation ηct becomes negligible even for an applied large value of η. Under such a condition, there is η ≈ ηc + ηohm(23)In this case, the reaction rate will be mainly controlled by ηohm and ηc, rather than eqn (14). The condition L → ∞ also means L ≫ L0, i.e. L + L0 ≈ L. Thus, by replacing ηc by (η–ηohm) and iL by ηohm/ρ, eqn (17) is reorganized as eqn (24).  (24)For potentiostatic electrolysis, η is a constant. Therefore, eqn (24) indicates ηohm to be an invariable. However, solving eqn (24) will lead to a constant value of the ohmic polarization, η*ohm. Then, combining eqns (11) and (15), there is  (25)Assuming Lmin to be the minimum reduction depth for eqn (24) to be valid (i.e., Lmin ≫ L0), and tmin the time needed for the 3PIs to reach Lmin, for L > Lmin or t > tmin, the initial conditions for eqn (25) can be written as t = tmin and L = Lmin. Then, the solution is,  (26)
Differentiation of eqn (26) against t leads to,  (27)

Eqns (21∼22) and (26∼27) describe the theoretical penetration rates of the 3PIs at a given η for t → 0 and t > tmin, respectively. According to the above discussions in both Case I and Case II, the physical image of the total reduction can be further demonstrated. With increasing t or L, the reduction current decreases. Accordingly, the electrochemical term ηct decreases and, from eqn (16), ηc + ηohm will increase. However, because ηc and ηohm are in correlation with the only variable iL (as shown in eqns (11) and (17)), they should change correlatively. In other words, they will both increase with L until ηct becomes negligibly small, as shown in eqn (23). Then, both ηohm and ηc reach at their maximums, denoted as η*ohm and η*c, respectively, which should remain constant during further reduction. Thus, the product iL will also reach at its maximum, denoted as (iL)*η for an overpotential η, or as (iL)*E for a potential E versus a reference electrode.

Fig. 34 also shows the variation of CsR during potentiostatic electrolysis at different times. At the beginning (t1 → 0), the electrochemical polarisation ηct is very large due to a large reduction current. However, the concentration polarisation ηc is relatively small (lower CsR) although the concentration gradient is the largest (see the line at t1 in Fig. 34). With the reduction continuing, L increases and ηct decreases, leading to a greater concentration polarisation (higher CsR). However, CsR will increase continuously to a constant when the reduction depth L becomes sufficiently large (L ≫ L0, see the lines at t3 and t4 in Fig. 34).
In Case II, at a sufficiently large η, both η*ohm and η*c will be very large, from eqn (17), there is CsR/C0R ≫ 1. Consequently,   Then, for a given value of E, replacing η*ohm with ρ(iL)*E and η with |E − Eeq| in eqn (23) leads to,  (28)Eqn (28) shows the direct influence of the applied potential on the reduction rate [in term of (iL)*E]. However, for a more general situation, considering that E0 is the potential of the M|MX|Xz−electrode in equilibrium with an electrolyte containing 1 mol L−1 of the Xz− ion, and E and E0 are referred to the same reference electrode, eqn (28) has a more common form,  (29)Eqn (29) which can be re-arranged into a linear form,  (30)Eqns (29) and (30) can be directly used even for the situation where CsR is unknown. The kinetic parameters, such as ρ and DR, can be obtained conveniently by nonlinear curve fitting the experimentally measured values of E and (iL)*E according to this simple equation. For example, at a given value of E, plotting iL [=iQ/(Aq) = IQ/(A2q)] against t, when t > tmin, iL will become a constant, i.e.(iL)*E. Then, plotting (iL)*E against E and applying linear fitting with eqn (30), ρ can be obtained directly, whereas DR can be calculated with a known E0 value.
5.2.2.3 Verification of the P3PIs model. 
The verification of the P3PIs model was carried out on the quartz pellet electrodes in molten CaCl2 at 850 °C. As shown in Fig. 35a. It should be mentioned that, according to the penetration model, continuous reduction in the depth direction will eventually lead to a uniform porous silicon layer. Indeed, it was observed in all partially reduced quartz pellets that the reduction progressed uniformly into the pellet from both sides. Fig. 35b displays an example.
 Fig. 35  (a) Photographs of the porous-Ni-foil |quartz-pellet| porous-Ni-foil sandwich electrode. (b) Optical scanning image of the cross section of the partially reduced quartz pellet electrode. The unlabelled outer layer surrounding the pellet shows the Ni foils and solidified salt. (Reprinted from ref. 72 with permission from Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Copyright 2006.) 
The I∼t curves under different potentials were plotted in Fig. 36a. Once the reduction progressed only in the depth direction, the current declines on the I∼t curves which should be governed by eqn (22) initially and by eqn (27) at a longer electrolysis time. The thickness of the reduction-generated porous Si layer shown in Fig. 36b can be regarded as the reduction depth L in eqns (21) and (26). Direct measurement of L was found to agree broadly with calculations from L = Q/(qA) (Q is the integration of the I∼t curves and A the total original geometric area of both end faces of the quartz pellet). According to eqn (26), L2 should increase linearly with t after prolonged electrolysis, whereas eqn (21) would govern in the initial electrolysis period. Fig. 36b plots the calculated L2 against t, demonstrating the expected features, particularly the linear region at longer electrolysis times. The penetration 3PI model predicts that for a given potential E, the product (iL) will become invariable at a long electrolysis time. Accordingly, the product IQ (IQ = iA × qAL) should also be invariable, which is demonstrated in Fig. 36c. The plateau increased with η, but remained unchanged at potentials more negative than −0.9 V. Such behaviour is also seen in Fig. 36a, showing almost identical I∼t curves recorded at −1.0 V and −1.1 V.

(b) The correlations between L2 and t at the indicated potentials (calculated from the integrations of the I∼t curves in (a) with L = Q/qA). (c) The correlations between IQ and t calculated from (a). (d) (b) The correlation between (iL)*E, calculated from (a) (−0.86 V < E < −0.65 V), and . (molten CaCl2, 1173 K, vs.Ag/AgCl). (Reprinted from ref. 72 with permission from Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Copyright 2006.) 
However, it has been acknowledged that the features shown by the I∼t curves between −0.86 V and −1.1 V were due to the saturated precipitation of CaO. Eqn (30) should be valid before −0.86 V, which was shown in Fig. 12d by plotting  against (iL)*E, where z = 2 for O2−. By linear fitting, ρ was found from the slope to be 28.2 Ω cm for the overall ionic and electronic resistivity in the reduction-generated porous silicon layer. The value of  was 1.202 V as given by the intercept in Fig. 36d. Although an exact value was unavailable, E0 and DO2− may be estimated from the saturated concentration of O2− in CaCl2, which will be about CO2−sat = 4.2 mol L−1 ignoring the volume change from pure CaCl2 to CaO saturated CaCl2, and DO2− was calculated as 6.8 × 10−6 cm2 s−1. Considering the porosity of 56% in the reduction-generated porous silicon layer,70 the above estimated values of DO2− are very reasonable compared with the values measured in bulk molten CaCl2 at 1173 K (2.5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) and in the porous ceramic sheet (porosity, ∼30%) filled with molten CaCl2 (2.8 × 10−5 cm2 s−1).141 These results fully confirmed the applicability of the P3PI model on the reduction of solid oxides in molten chlorides.
5.2.2.4 Practical significance. 

Concentration and ohmic polarisations We would like to highlight the practical significance of the above theoretical and experimental findings for the optimization of the electrode design and electrolysis conditions for the FFC Cambridge Process. The reduction of the inner part of an oxide electrode is mainly controlled by the concentration and ohmic polarizations in the reduction-generated porous metal layer. It is much slower than that on the surface and hence determines the overall reaction time of the electrode.

Porosity and thickness The porosity of the oxide electrode plays an important role. Larger porosity of the electrode allows faster diffusion and lower solution resistance, but the electric contact resistance between the metal particles will be larger and the product by volume will be smaller. Because the reaction rate decreases with increasing reduction depth, a thicker electrode takes a longer time to reduce, and the current efficiency will be lower because of the inevitable residual current due to electronic conduction through the molten salt. Porosity and thickness of the solid oxide electrode should therefore be carefully balanced for the bulk production of metal by the electro-reduction method.

Overpotential The applied potential (or cell voltage) has direct influence on the reduction rate and the energy efficiency in the electrolysis process. Large overpotentials are favourable for fast reduction of the oxide, but too large an overpotential can lead to O2− saturation, and hence the precipitation of CaO in the porous interior of the electrode.
