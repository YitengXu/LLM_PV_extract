Since H2 energy is the future of the world energy scheme, at the center of the discussion are the old existing methods of research and some new developments in emerging technologies. The few currently used H2 production technologies are outdated and not so competitive and this means a tight bottleneck in the overall energy system. Furthermore, expectations arise with the advancement of the world energy system to find the most innovative alternative renewable energy resources.

1. Introduction
In the 21st century, municipal solid waste management along with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the utilization of renewable energy resources is a major challenge that needs to be dealt with to minimize the effects of global climate change. Due to the increase in human activities and the rising overall energy demand, the concentration of CO2 is growing at an alarming rate. CO2 is a hazardous gas and is considered a major component of greenhouse gases and one of the main reasons for global warming, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, etc.1,2 The rising level of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is the result of burning fossil fuels such as coal for energy production. And the utilization of these fossil fuels, especially coal, for energy production will remain the main source of energy for the next few decades,3 the process of minimizing the use of fossil fuels becomes much more important. One of the most widely used approaches to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentration is to capture, sequester and utilize it at the same time. And the utilization process includes the conversion of CO2 into value-added products through the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).4 On the other hand, a transition from non-renewable fossil fuel energy to renewable energy is essential in mitigating CO2 emissions.5 To cope with current challenges, the world needs to move quickly toward renewable energy resources or carbon-neutral resources such as hydrogen (H2), solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass energy.6 One of the studies made some future predictions about the peak values of some of the conventional fuels estimating that natural gas production will peak in 10–20 years and oil production will peak within 20 years or so. These two events of conventional fuels peaking will dramatically increase demand for uranium and coal, which means that the world will be facing the immense problems of depleting energy resources of fossil fuel regeneration by 2050. In the last few decades, many serious efforts have been devoted to generating clean and renewable energy but still more time and consolidated efforts are needed to integrate clean energy resources into practical applications. Due to the fact that the evolving global energy challenges and fossil fuel resource constraints expected in the coming decades, the need for H2 production and its utilization is inevitable.7 The study results also predicted that the possible range of global H2 demand will remain between 73 and 158 Mt in 2030, 73 and 300 Mt in 2040, and 73 and 568 Mt in 2050, depending on the scenario presented.8 H2 is considered a clean energy technology and further its storage for the long run is also an advantageous way to produce electricity using fuel cells. The storage capacity and economics of H2 energy storage are a part of the discussion about renewable energy technologies.6,9,10 In this regard, many research studies have been conducted so far to develop a clean, economically feasible, and sustainable energy system. Along with its economic viability, the applicability of H2 energy on a commercial scale is equally important for it to be considered as an alternative and clean energy source. Finding an economical way to store hydrogen is at the center of research and development of renewable energies.11,12 Several authors have reported that hydrogen is a key component in developing a clean and sustainable energy system, although its production technology must be made economically feasible.13 H2 and fuel cells are considered new emerging technologies and sources of a transition from fossil fuels to renewable green energy in the long run for cleaner energy and transport systems. There is not much public awareness and information about the use of H2 technology, its advantages, negative impacts and acceptance as an alternative source for commercial applications. The study, analysis, advantages, and drawbacks of some of the existing technologies can lead us to put some consolidated efforts into finding emerging technologies for H2 production.
This current work aims to give an overview of some of the old existing technologies, their advantages, and drawbacks and allows a better understanding of some of the existing and new emerging technologies in H2 production. Bearing in mind the shortcomings of existing technologies, new emerging technologies have been summarized in such a way that gives a clear understanding to find alternative technologies. The overall purpose of this mini-review is to summarize the benefits of some of the recently developed renewable resource technologies and to find alternative, economically feasible, and commercially available H2 production technologies. The cost and commercial maturity analysis study of the new technologies has also been summarized. Technology readiness level (TRL) assessment and the time frame to commercial maturity of different technologies have also been summarized in this review. Furthermore, the future perspectives and new research directions in H2 production technology are also part of this study. This paper has five sections: the first one is an introduction; the second section provides an overview of the conventional technologies and their advantages and drawbacks, the third section represents the processes and routes of new emerging technologies in H2 production, the fourth section describes the cost and technology readiness level, and the last and fifth section covers some future perspectives and new research directions in H2 production technologies.
2. An overview of the conventional technologies for H2 production
H2 is considered a source of clean energy, and it can be produced from renewable and non-renewable feedstock which contains a hydrogen atom (H) as an essential part of its composition.14 Basically, hydrogen gas (H2) does not exist naturally in a sufficient amount which means H2 is an energy carrier and energy holder gas. In order to use H2 on a large scale, researchers developed an economical and viable means of its production and storage, mainly for energy conversion in fuel cells. H2 is one of the most efficient energy fuels in energy conversion in the transportation sector.15 In terms of producing H2 gas on a commercial scale, there are two different ways of producing it and the processes are illustrated in Fig. 1. Fossil fuels and renewable energy are two main sources of producing blue and green H2 energy respectively. Over a large or decentralized (on-site) scale, where inputs are transported to a place near the final consumer (such as a gas station) and on-board hydrogen production while it is being used. Furthermore, H2 is considered a more efficient gas than gasoline due to its specific weight of 0.0899 kg N m−3 at 0 °C and 1 bar pressure.16 Overall world energy in terms of H2 production comprises 2% of primary energy demand. It is worth mentioning that fossil fuels are the main source of hydrogen production. And the major route of the utilization of fossil fuels for H2 production is steam reforming which comprises almost half of its production demand (48%), and is considered an economical and main production chain all over the world. Many different technologies and different routes have been utilized with various choices of input sources to produce H2 energy. Table 1 shows some of the commonly used conventional technologies for H2 production with their drawbacks. In the current scenario, the available technologies can be divided into four categories based on their processing techniques: (i) thermochemical; (ii) photobiological; (iii) electrochemical; and (iv) photoelectrochemical.17 And the different processes can also be categorized based on their utilization: (i) thermal; (ii) electrolytic; (iii) biochemical; and (iv) chemical, as given in Fig. 2. The following section describes some of the most commonly used and conventional methods of H2 production in detail with some benefits and drawbacks.

 Fig. 2  Hydrogen production processes and energies. 
2.1 Steam reforming
Steam reforming is the most well-established and main H2 production technology.18 In the steam reforming process, natural gas is used as a source of renewable energy with high thermal efficiency greater than 80%.19 In this process, the relative amount of H2 production is far higher than the amount of CO in the produced syngas. High quality H2 is produced as a result of this process with a purity of 99.95%.20 But the problem with using the steam reforming technology is its high energy consumption since the steam reforming process is purely endothermic. High operating cost is another main bottleneck with the use of the steam reforming process for H2 production. The high emission of CO2 gas as a result of the fuel combustion to heat the vapor is a major challenge in its application on a commercial scale.21 Catalyst deactivation by the coke deposition process adds another point to the list of drawbacks in the processing of the steam reforming process of H2 production. Ethanol is treated as another source of energy in the steam reforming process with lower reaction temperatures than natural gas and uses a renewable natural resource (sugarcane/ethanol). But the major challenge when applying ethanol is that it causes side reactions (decomposition, dehydrogenation, and dehydration).22
2.2 Gasification
H2 production via the gasification process is an efficient method with high efficiency and high conversion rate. In the gasification process biomass is used as a raw material and a renewable energy source.23 This technology is considered economically viable and environmentally friendly with relatively high H2 yield.24 But the main drawback of using this technology is that the produced gases contain a large amount of tar and traces of other components which require extra cost for conditioning and removing impurities. And high reactor cost is also one of the main challenges of using gasification technologies on a large scale.25
2.3 Autothermal reforming
Autothermal technology is meant to be the most appropriate technology for gas to liquid (GTL) processes. Natural gas is the main source of raw material and renewable energy in this technique.26 The main advantage of using autothermal reforming is that it has low cost compared to other processes. In this technique, a nearly thermodynamically neutral reaction makes this technique a better alternative for reforming fuels.27 Low H2 yield is a major problem with the use of this technique which limits its applications on a commercial scale.28
2.4 Catalytic partial oxidation
Catalytic partial oxidation is the most economically promising process for syngas production. Natural gas is the main source of raw material and doesn't require any external heating since the processes involve exothermic reactions. Catalytic partial oxidation technology is economically viable due to its low energy cost.29 The main drawback of this technology is that Ni-based catalysts can be deactivated by cooking and sintering, hampering the large-scale application of partial oxidation of methane gas.30 Ethanol has been used as another source of renewable and natural raw material in this technology.31 The use of ethanol in the catalytic partial oxidation technique is a weakly endothermic reaction compared to being strongly endothermic in steam reforming of ethanol. The main drawback with the use of this technology is the complexity of the reaction and the high amount of energy released, low H2 yield, and dilution of the products in case of using air as the oxidizing agent. High flammability is another main challenge in using catalytic partial oxidation technology for H2 production.32
3. State-of-the-art new emerging technologies for H2 production
Given some challenging drawbacks with the use of conventional H2 production technologies, the literature reveals many different novel approaches to produce H2 through more cost-effective pathways via some promising rapidly developing technologies. In a recent development, combining the process of H2 production and its utilization in a reversible (regenerative) manner to add momentum to renewable technologies can be a game changer in the near future.53 Moreover, the potential to reduce the energy cost, use of novel catalyst materials, or the structural cost can reduce the overall cost of H2 production. Reducing the overall cost of H2 production with the use of some new emerging and promising technologies can make H2 energy economically competitive and commercially viable. In the following section, some of the new and state-of-the-art H2 production technologies are discussed in detail; they show great potential to overlap the existing old technologies and need further research and development (R&D) to reduce cost and increase H2 production efficiency. Table 2 shows the state-of-the-art emerging technologies and their benefits in the H2 production process.

3.1 Anion exchange membrane (AEM)
Anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysis is a new emerging, cost-effective, and easily applicable H2 production technique. Basically, an AEM is a semipermeable membrane designed to conduct anions while being impermeable to gases such as H2 or oxygen in the photocatalytic generation process.54 In its structure, an AEM consists of some basis polymeric network materials containing immobilized and positively charged groups that allow them to selectively transport anions from the cathode chamber to the anode section. The mechanism of proton transfer is shown in Fig. 3(a). At the anode chamber, protons produced as a result of microbial oxidation reaction of organic materials may react with the phosphate buffer solution to form a monobasic phosphate. In the following step the monobasic phosphate may easily transfer from the anode section to the cathode via AEM assembly. Finally, monobasic phosphate can transfer back to the cathode as a phosphate buffer for anion exchange to produce H2.55

Fig. 3(b) depicts the different parts of the AEM and water electrolysis process for H2 production. An external power supply is connected to the anode as a source of DC. The overall hydrolysis reaction consists of two half-cell reactions: in the first part of the cell, the H2 evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are carried out. Water is circulated through the anode side where it is reduced to form H2 and hydroxyl ions by the addition of two electrons.56 Rozendal et al.59 conducted an experimental comparison study to evaluate the performance of an anion exchange membrane with four other different types of membrane for H2 production. In their experimental study they used an AEM (Fumasep®FAB, FuMA-Tech GmbH, Germany) in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) operated with wastewater, and the MEC showed the best H2 production efficiency among four different types of ion-exchange membranes (IEMs). Liang et al.60 studied the effect of current density on the voltage using an AEM shown in Fig. 3(b). The efficiency decreased with increasing current density due to the total voltage loss comprising the activation loss of the two electrodes and the ohmic loss. To achieve an optimal rate of H2 production and efficiency, the operating current density must be optimal. The higher exchange current density resulted in a reduction in voltage and higher efficiency. The authors suggest that higher exchange current densities favor the reaction kinetics and consequently the activation losses can be reduced.
3.2 Catalytic membrane reactor
A catalytic membrane reactor is a mass selective structure that allows H2 transfer under a variety of driving forces like pressure, temperature, electric potential, etc. Catalytic membrane reactors offer various advantages of higher conversions with higher selectivity over adiabatic fixed bed reactors. For example, Tian et al.61 used a SrTiO3 perovskite catalyst and have reported 74% selectivity to CO together with 75% selectivity to H2 with 17% CH4 conversion. Goldbach et al.62 evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art Pd/ceramic composite membranes under CO2 capture conditions. The experimental study was conducted at high feed and permeate pressures at elevated temperatures and their work achieved a very high carbon capture rate (≥90%) and H2 separation factor (≥90%). Moreover, results showed that the extracted H2 amount was noticeably lower than 98% and related costs increased disproportionally with H2 recovery under practical CO2 capture conditions due to the enlargement of membrane area. Bernay et al.63 evaluated a system for CO-free H2 production that couples steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) and CO-removal reactors. The response surfaces indicated that the Au1.0Cu1.0/Ce catalyst showed the lowest H2 loss (25%) and achieved a low CO concentration of 70 ppm at 210 °C but the presence of Au in the AuCu/CeO2 catalyst favors CO conversion with low yield. However, H2 loss is higher than that reported for synthetic feeds because a complex network of reactions is present in the actual post-reforming stream cleaning.
Omer Yehezkeli et al.64 showed a simple method to construct cells composed of CdS/NiOx anodes and CuFeO2/CuO or NiO/CdTe cathodes for CO2-reducing PECs that can generate formate and methanol at neutral pH and showed high open-circuit voltages. By summing all the fuel produced as a result of the composite formation the H2 production efficiency reached only up to 11% out of the total fuel production efficiency of 49%. The different mechanisms of the electrodes and organocatalysts could be the main reason behind the difference in product selectivity between varying PEC systems.
3.3 Unitized regenerative proton exchange membrane (PEM) cell
A reversible electrolyzer and fuel cell in one unit is another emerging technology for H2 and power production. For the first time, Willard Thomas Grubb and Leonard Niedrach65 developed a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which is one of the most developed and reliable technologies. The membrane fuel cell can convert the chemical energy of common fuels such as H2, ethanol, and methanol under a mild temperature range of 20–100 °C and atmospheric pressure conditions. In order to produce H2 fuel from the water electrolysis reaction, the reverse reaction is also possible with the use of a device called the proton exchange membrane electrolysis cell (PEMEC), which was proposed at nearly the same time as the PEMFC.66 Since its first appearance, the unitized regenerative proton exchange membrane electrolysis cell (UR-PEMFC) has attracted great interest due to its distinct advantages over other energy storage technologies such as higher specific energy (0.4–1.0 kW h kg−1), long-term storage ability due to the elimination of self-discharge, and most importantly, the decoupling between power output ability and energy storage ability. Furthermore, UR-PEMFC is deemed to be promising for H2 production on a large scale and can be used for commercial purposes. In the late 1990s, Peng et al.67 from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) did great work to improve cell performance and cycle stability of UR-PEMFCs with a relatively low catalyst loading (1 mg cm−2). A lightweight pressure vessel was designed to improve the systematic specific energy and as a result of this negligible degradation was observed even after 210 cyclic tests. As for commercial applications, Proton Energy Systems, Inc. has developed its product UNIGEN™ which performed identically to dedicated electrolyzers in electrolysis cell (EC) mode and to dedicated fuel cells in fuel cell (FC) mode.68 Despite these great efforts, UR-PEMFC technology has still not been ushered into the large-scale commercial application stage. Continuous efforts have been made to further improve their performance, cycle stability, roundtrip energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the water electrolysis (WE) mode and traditional PEMFC structure of fuel cells (FCs) can function like the URFC unit cell system.

In WE mode, the water molecules are dissociated into protons, oxygen, and electrons in the positive electrode using the energy supplied by solar/wind sources. The protons and electrons are transferred from the positive to the negative side through the polymer electrolyte membrane and external circuit, respectively. In the cathode section, protons combine with electrons to form H2 gas. The produced H2 is then stored and can be used as a fuel in the FC mode reaction. In the URFC unit cell system, the reverse reaction of the WE occurs in the FC mode to produce electricity.69 The operational process of the FC mode in the URFC is similar to that in the typical PEMFC. The electrochemical redox reactions of the WE mode and FC mode are as follows:
At the anode:H2O → 2H+ + 2e− + ½O2;
At the cathode:2H+ + 2e− → H2
Fuel cell mode reaction:
At the anode:H2 → 2H+ + 2e−;
At the cathode:2H+ + 2e− + ½O2 → H2O
3.4 Membraneless electrolyzer
A membraneless electrolyzer is a comparatively newly developed technology for H2 production.58 In a membraneless electrolyzer, two independent laminar flow streams can be separated up to a certain length, which ensures the formation of a virtual layer separating the anode and cathode. In experimental studies the type of membraneless electrolyzer cell (MEC) used is a continuous flow single-chamber or a reactor with a total volume of 3 L. The MEC was equipped with an electrolytic module (anode + cathode) submerged in the feedstock of either the synthetic medium or domestic waste and contained ports for gas exits and liquid entries and exits. The cathode consists of a stainless steel electrode, and the anode is one layer of carbon felt 1 cm thick and both have dimensions of 210 × 100 mm. Fig. 3(d) shows the side view of different types of conventional and emerging membraneless low-temperature electrolyzer technologies. The different sections of the electrolyser cells (A–D) represent conventional technologies (A) polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and (B) alkaline electrolyzer cells, and emerging membraneless electrolyzers based on (C) flow-by electrodes and (D) flow-through electrodes. The inset in (D) shows a 3D view of a mesh flow-through electrode evolving O2 as electrolyte passes through holes in the mesh.
R. Moreno et al.57 in their experimental work assessed the opportunities for scalability of low-cost MECs for domestic wastewater treatment and methane production. Their work paid special attention to the problems associated with the use of low-strength domestic waste water where MECs offer a competitive advantage over aerobic wastewater treatments. The results also demonstrated that stimulating hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis enhances homoacetogenic activity which is an important source of inefficiencies in MECs. Furthermore, results also depicted that the use of the MEC in a methane-producing reactor was especially favorable at high retention time, where anode-respiring bacteria have a competitive advantage over acetoclastic methanogens. Fig. 3(c) shows the schematic presentation of the laboratory setup used in experimental work for the electrolysis process of H2 production.
Jonathan et al.70 performed physical and electrochemical characterization of the electrodes in 2-electrode measurements followed by a detailed description of the novel electrode configuration. The characterization is performed in a commonly employed laboratory electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4) as a standard. Using a combination of gas chromatography (GC) measurements and high-speed video (HSV), product gas cross-over is characterized under varied operating current densities and electrode angles. This study has demonstrated a novel electrode architecture for water electrolysis whereby high purity (≥99% pure) H2 can be produced without any actively pumped electrolyte or without the use of any membrane. Instead, this design relies on the use of buoyancy-driven separation of H2 and O2 gas bubbles that are generated at the so-called “asymmetric” mesh electrodes with active catalyst deposited onto only their outer surface. In the following study, Daniel et al.58 described the advantage of membrane-less electrolyzers as low-cost H2 production technology. The first and most important advantage of using membraneless electrolyzers is their durability with long operating lifetimes, greater resilience, high tolerance to impurities, and extreme operating conditions that would cause harm to a membrane. Secondly, the overall cost includes the cost of material, the complexity of the process, and assembly cost after eliminating the membrane. A third potential advantage of membrane-less electrolysers is their ability to operate in all environments and in a wide variety of aqueous conductive electrolytes.
3.5 Battolyser
A battolyser is another green, low-cost, and energy-intensive technique for H2 production. In a simple construction of its unit, a battolyser is an array of batteries connected in series which can produce H2 after they are fully charged. The integrated electrolyser and battery works in a very simple charging and discharging mode, for example, batteries are automatically charged when there is a surplus of renewable electricity available and discharged when there is an electricity deficiency.74 The electricity storage capacity of a battery depends on power to power efficiency. The production capacity of H2 of any battery enhances from its original capacity when there is excess electricity even in some cases the capacity enhances from its designed capacity. And it has also been observed that the combination of the electrolyzer and battery showed no restriction of H2 production and the capacity goes beyond the designed limits. Over a large stage production of H2 and further its utilization as a fuel and back to power required storage methods which usually lowers power-to-power efficiency as compared to battery storage. However, it is very important to design the storage capacity for H2 production because the use of the batteries once in a season is too costly and has lower energy efficiency as compared to liquid ammonia or alkanes. The design of the ultimate storage capacity and optimization process of overall energy is very important for long-term H2 fuel storage and short-term battery storage.
Mulder et al.74 for the first time developed an integrated battery-electrolyser (battolyser) by using a nickel–iron battery which can store electricity and split water into H2 and oxygen as an alkaline electrolyzer. In the battery-electrolyser, Fe(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2 electrodes form nanostructured NiOOH and reduced Fe which further work as catalyst and efficient tools for H2 and oxygen production. Fig. 4c(i) shows the composition of the battolyser and its practical applications in different areas. The left part of Fig. 4c(i) shows the layout of the integrated electrochemical battery. The electrode consists of Ni–Fe store electricity from the electricity source during the charging period and at the same time convert electrode. As a result of the electrolysis process of splitting water, H2 and oxygen are formed. The grey part of the cell called the diaphragm transmits OH− and separates O2 and extra H2. The right side of Fig. 4c(i) shows the potential applications of the battolyser as a source and sink of electricity supply as well as H2 as fuel for electric and hybrid-electric and H2 vehicles (PH2EV). Fig. 4c(ii) illustrates a battolyser unit that is divided into three different parts: the top part depicts surplus renewable energy storage; the middle is the main electrolyzer; and the bottom part is a separate storage battery and electrolyzer. W indicates the full power and Wh is the overall energy capacity of the unit that is meant to be responsible for the required power and energy storage management capabilities during the different days throughout the year. The left side of Fig. 4c(ii) shows the energy storage capacity of a unit cell on a hot summer day for the short term (green area) and long term (blue H2 area). And in subsequent winter (right side), spring, and autumn days the surplus energy and power go to the short-term energy storage place because it is required only after a few hours, also preventing energy conversion into fuel which means higher energy losses.75 The daily energy deficit is compensated by short-term battery storage on summer days and with a storage battery plus H2 derived electricity on a subsequent winter day.
In another study, Wang et al.76 constructed high-performance rechargeable lithium-ion batteries composed of MoS2-coated vertical graphene nanosheets. The composite of MoS2/VGNS grown on the Ni surface shows a specific capacity of 1277 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and a high first-cycle coulombic efficiency of 76.6%. This composite nanosheet also exhibits improved electrochemical performance and is highly beneficial for H2 production. Chen et al. presented a polyoxoanion, [P2W18O62]6−, shown in Fig. 4(b), that can be reversibly reduced and protonated by 18 electrons/H+ per anion in aqueous solution, and that can act either as a high-performance redox flow battery electrolyte (discharged energy density of 225W h L−1 with a theoretical energy density of 1000 W h L−1), or as a mediator in an electrolytic cell for on-demand generation of H2. This is illustrated by the ability of this cluster to reversibly accept 18 electrons/H+. This corresponds to ∼9 g of H2 stored per litre, or a flow battery with a practical discharge energy density of 225 W h L−1 (with an open-circuit voltage of 1.25 V and an energy efficiency of 76%) at room temperature.
3.6 Artificial photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is an artificial technique for solar fuel generation especially H2via the CO2 reduction technique. Zhou et al.71 in their work developed a prototype that is basically an artificial photosynthetic unit. The overall unit is connected with different parts of the system such as a CO2/proton reduction catalyst, a co-catalyst, and an electron mediator as well as a CO2 activator into a polymer-based nano-architectured system. The system facilitates an artificial photosynthesis process with water and CO2 to convert solar energy into chemical energy such as in carbohydrates or H2. For the further explanation of the artificial photosynthesis unit for energy production, the system is divided into its different parts which are shown in Fig. 4(a). The natural photosynthetic system comprises different parts which are also shown in Fig. 4(a), i.e. (a) natural leaf with abundant non-metallic elements such as chlorophyll which is a main photosynthetic pigment and an important enzyme for photosynthesis for natural bond formation. (b) shows the pattern of the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis in a chloroplast. (c) shows the basic photosynthetic unit: single thylakoid embedded photosynthetic pigments, protein complexes that carry out the light reactions of photosynthesis. (d) shows the molecular structure of polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and artificial photosynthesis on the basic artificial photosynthetic unit composed of carbon nanosheets as the catalytic element, Au NPs as a co-catalyst and ZIF-9 as an electron mediator and CO2 activator, indicating that the process is using CO2 and H2O as the inputs and CO and H2 as the outputs under light irradiation.
Mohamed et al.77 in their study explained the relationship between the natural environment and the photosynthesis process of H2 energy production. At the beginning of life on earth, some natural organisms were the only main source of H2 production in combination with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and therefore, there was no strong evolutionary evidence for the presence of oxygen-resistant hydrogenases.78 And later on, the concept of hydrogenases arises and it is also found that the coupling of the photosynthesis process with the hydrogenases enhances the efficiency of H2 production up to 40%.79 However, the actual realistic goal could be close to 10% efficiency.80 Based on the photosynthetic process, production of H2 in the native system in vivo and H2 production in a semi-artificial system are two known strategies used for H2 production. Both techniques show some promising H2 production results after using the combined strategies of photosynthesis and hydrogenase processes.
3.7 Dark fermentation followed by photo-fermentation
Dark fermentation followed by photo-fermentation is also a newly developed and highly efficient technique of H2 energy production. This hybrid technique consists of two stages, i.e. the fermentation process followed by activation via exposure to light. In the first stage, the biomass is fermented to acetate, carbon dioxide, and H2 in a thermophilic dark fermentation, and the second stage photo-bioreactor, acetate, is converted into H2 and carbon dioxide. The main concept of the whole process is that in the first stage conventional reactor bio-fermentation of the substrate to H2 and organic acids takes place, while in the second stage of the system, different types of reactors under various conditions such as higher pH and longer hydraulic retention times are applied for the optimization process of H2 production and other energy gases.81 Usually the non-sulphur photosynthetic microbes are sufficient for H2 production but the combination of dark and photo-fermentation in a hybrid two-stage system can sufficiently improve H2 yield.82 This improved production yield is the result of the improved thermodynamics to convert substrates into energy. In this regard, the first ever study was conducted by Jong Lee et al.83 to determine the feasibility of a hybrid two-stage photo-fermentation system shown in Fig. 5 and the second stage was fed with effluent from a hydrogen-producing reactor. It was noticed that during the experimental approach, although H2 yields were well below the hypothetical values, a combination of dark and photo-fermentation in a hybrid two-stage system could improve the overall yield of H2.

4. Technology readiness level and cost comparison
Over the last few years, many efforts have been made to diversify our energy system, particularly from renewable resources to cleaner energy fuels especially in the transportation sector. Different types of fuels are used such as ethanol, biodiesel, methane, and gasoline but there is no alternative fuel which can overtake the existing fuels as a source of cleaner energy. Most of these fuels required different processes and technologies for an efficient production system; however, H2 can be produced from all of these feedstocks as well as many others, making it a universal energy source as a fuel. Internationally, extensive efforts have been made and a lot of attention has been paid to the development of new H2 production technologies as a solution to the current problem in the cleaner energy sector and to overcome the fears of energy and economic security. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has developed a multiyear plan with ambitious targets and milestones for the development of H2 infrastructure in production and storage technologies.94
The fact is that a majority of current H2 is produced from fossil fuels which are almost 96% of the total commercial production. Natural gas contributes 48%, heavy oils and naphtha 30%, and coal 18% of the total H2 production,95 which are mainly reformed using steam methane reforming (SMR) technology. The remaining 4% of H2 is produced from a renewable technology of water electrolysis using alkaline electrolyzers.96 The total H2 production route can be divided into two production methods, one from fossil fuels and the other from renewable resources. Steam methane reforming (SMR), partial oxidation (POX), and auto-thermal reforming (ATR) technologies are based on fossil fuel while membraneless electrolyzer cells (MECs) and dark fermentation are based on renewable energy resources. H2 production from biomass and water splitting are included among the renewable sources of energy.97Fig. 6 shows a summary of fossil fuel based technologies and their maturity level, feedstock, operating temperature range, and efficiency.
 Fig. 6  Fossil fuel based technologies and their maturity level. 
Technologies are divided into four different stages according to their applicability at scale. For instance, “near term” indicates less than 5 years, “medium term” 5–10 years, and “long term” greater than 10 years to commercial maturity. Steam methane reforming (SMR) technologies with the highest efficiency level are commercially available techniques along with partial oxidation (POX) methods of H2 production with similar temperature ranges, feedstocks, efficiencies, and maturity levels. Autothermal reforming (ATR) and pyrolysis are categorized as near-term available technologies with up to 75% and 51% efficiencies respectively.98 Aqueous phase reforming with a medium efficiency level of 35–55% is expected to be commercially available in the medium term. The plasma reforming method of H2 production with the highest efficiency of 85% is the technology that would take a long term period to commercial maturity.99

Fig. 7 shows the time frame and the commercial maturity level of technologies with renewable resources. Proton exchange membrane (PEM), alkaline electrolysis, and biomass are commercially available technologies.100 Amongst the commercially utilized technologies, PEM and alkaline electrolysis are characterized as highly efficient with an 80% efficiency level. Solid oxide electrolysis cell technology lies in the medium term for commercial maturity and also shows the highest efficiency as compared to the other technologies of renewable resources. Dark fermentation, membraneless electrolyzer cells, and water splitting would take a longer time of more than 10 years for their commercial availability.101
 Fig. 7  New emerging technologies and their maturity level. 
Furthermore, the state of commercialization is defined with the term technology readiness level (TRL), which describes the extent of development made in that particular technology. Technology readiness level is characterized by nine different stages from theoretical principle, at TRL 1, to operational plant, at TRL 9. Fig. 8(a) shows different stages and the correspondence of the TRL number to the technology readiness level.102 The TRL was estimated for all new emerging hydrogen production technologies.103 The minimum TRL of any component of the technology was taken into account as the limiting factor in their development stage and marked with the lowest TRL number. Fig. 8(b) shows the TRL levels for all new emerging technologies for H2 production. Alkaline electrolysis and SMR have the highest TRL values of 9 and are the only current commercially available technologies in H2 production. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis is more developed than any other thermochemical or hybrid process with a TRL value of 6.
 Fig. 8  (a) Description of technology readiness levels.102 (b) Technology readiness levels of hydrogen production technologies.96 
All the new emerging technologies (along with the comparison SMR), including TRL, total efficiency, inputs, output, temperature, and pressure, are summarized in Table 3. It also shows a range of cost per unit kg of H2 production from all three different types of technologies based on thermochemical, hydrolysis, and hybrid systems. The overall cost of 1 kg of H2 is calculated while taking into account the theoretical factors involved at different stages of the process. The total cost required to meet different factors such as temperature, pressure, inputs stream, and outputs are considered in cost analysis. Production costs for the electrolysis process require a significant amount of electricity and are highly dependent on electricity prices. Similarly, thermal-based water splitting methods are expected to be more cost effective because the cost of electricity is significantly higher than the cost of heat during the conversion process.104 It has been found from the process conditions and the amount of H2 produced from SMR technology that it incurs a high cost as compared to the other available technologies. But in reality, SMR is the cheapest technology in a $ per kg scenario. Otherwise, SOEC and S–I would likely be the cheapest when coupled with a high temperature reactor, as these technologies have previously been chosen for further development. There are situations where hybrid systems may be profitable – when hydrogen, electricity, and natural gas prices are high, or severe CO2 costs are included. However, with the volatility of prices, flexible hybrid configurations are not currently valuable enough to overcome capital costs. Further policy will likely need to be implemented (aiming at cleaner energy production) to make hybrid systems profitable.105

Hybrid technologies only required water, heat and/or electricity, and these technologies can be easily made economically feasible when they are connected and operating with nuclear plants. All of the inputs required in hybrid systems to produce H2 energy are abundant around most nuclear plants. Alkaline water electrolysis is currently the only widespread, commercially available, large-scale clean H2 production technology, but other technologies have shown rapid development and promise, along with potentially lower production costs. Additionally, these hydrogen production technologies operate at various temperatures.
5. Future perspectives and research directions in H2 production
The transition towards green H2 economy comes through many sizable challenges and substantial economic investments. But still, some considerable efforts are needed in technological expansion to make extensive progress towards a net zero-carbon energy-based society.109 It is thus critical to achieve international cooperation, particularly from policymakers and governments, to establish energy strategies to stimulate clean H2 demand and its production. The cooperation in research and development, provision of clear and harmonised regulatory requirements/standards, and support in terms of long-term investments through public–private partnerships could be highly beneficial in the pursuit of zero carbon footprints. The potential for economic growth, businesses, and job creation are all tremendously important and are linked with clean energy resources such as H2 energy and minimizing global warming effects. According to the IEA's “The future of H2” report,110 “clean H2 is currently embracing political and corporate momentum with a number of different policies, research, and developments. Given this growing wide interest, the number of H2 energy projects is increasing rapidly throughout the world”. Furthermore, it states that “now is the time to scale up the technology and reduce overall cost so that H2 technologies may become sustainable and approachable for a wide range of applications”. In terms of economics and processes, many different H2 generation technologies from fossil fuels and renewable energy resources are available. Currently, natural gas is the most important main energy source for H2 generation, accounting for 70% of total production, followed by oil, coal, and electricity as secondary energy resources. Autothermal and steam reforming from fossil fuels are the most significant and economically feasible approaches for a large-scale centralized H2 generation.111 At present, only a limited amount of H2 has been produced from renewable sources, but this figure is also expected to rise in the future. Long-term and medium-scale H2 generation technologies based on photosynthetic microbial systems would become another economical and viable alternative option with the advancement of molecular, genomic, and bioengineering research. In the long run, green H2 generation utilising renewable energy resources is also predicted to gain considerable interest in the market through research, development, and demonstration in diverse geographical locations.111
In the current scenario, distributed H2 generation via water electrolysis might be the most promising renewable energy-based solution. Electrolysis presently contributes only 5% of the worldwide H2 generation; however, the vast majority of this is still reliant on traditional power sources. Electrolysis from surplus renewable energy is viewed as having enormous future potential. For more than a century, industry has relied on alkaline electrolysis. Alternative electrolysis techniques with enhanced performance characteristics (in terms of conversion efficiency, flexibility, and cost) are being developed at the moment. Cost-effective and long-lasting components of electrolyzers for efficient water splitting system efficiency can be commercialized on a large scale. Additionally, electrolysis-based H2 production will need to be supplemented with existing SMR technology, which enables low-cost and large-scale H2 production. While theoretically conceivable, H2 generation from biomass is currently tiny on a worldwide scale as well, and while thermochemical technologies such as biomass gasification and biogas reforming are now in use, biochemical procedures are still in their infancy. Because biomass is a finite resource, its availability must be balanced against sustainability standards. The most cost-effective method is centralised natural gas reforming, with production costs ranging from 1 to 2 EUR per kilogram of H2. Electrolysis is far costlier, and its economic viability is heavily reliant on power costs. The costs of producing H2 from biomass are comparable to those of natural gas reforming and electrolysis. Decentralized natural gas reforming, centralised electrolysis, and centralized biomass pathways are likely to offer the highest cost-saving possibilities in the very near future.112
