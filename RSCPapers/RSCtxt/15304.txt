    , Accepted 27th November 2012First published on 28th November 2012AbstractMonodisperse and uniform Y6O5F8:RE3+ (RE = Yb, Er, and Ho) microarchitectures with various morphologies have been constructed by a facile surfactant-assisted hydrothermal route, and their up-conversion luminescence and NIR quantum cutting properties were investigated. Hollow hexagonal prisms, microbundle gatherings by rods, and solid hexagonal prisms were designed by employing CTAB, PVP, and EDTA as additives, respectively. Under 980 nm excitation, the Y5.34O5F8:0.6Yb3+, 0.06Er3+ samples obtained using different additives exhibit similar emission spectra profiles with predominating peaks at 670 nm; the Y5.34O5F8:0.6Yb3+, 0.06Ho3+ samples give green emissions with the strongest peaks around 544 nm. The NIR quantum cutting for the Y6O5F8:Yb3+, Ho3+ samples was identified by the NIR emission spectra upon both 360 and 450 nm excitation. The corresponding quantum cutting mechanisms were discussed through the energy level diagrams, in which a back-energy-transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+ was first proposed to interpret the spectral characteristics. A modified calculation equation for the quantum efficiency of Yb3+–Ho3+ coupled by exciting at 450 nm was suggested according to the quantum cutting mechanism. The efficient NIR luminescence and quantum cutting in Yb3+, Ho3+ co-doped Y6O5F8 reveal a possible application in modifying the solar spectrum to enhance the efficiency of silicon solar cells.
1. Introduction
The fabrication of nano- to micro-scale inorganic structures assembled by nanoparticles, nanorods/nanowires, and nanobelts as building blocks with well-defined shapes and inner structures has attracted great interest as a result of their novel properties and application convenience.1,2 To date, many efforts have been made to explore excellent synthetic approaches for the fabrication of a variety of inorganic functional materials with different levels to enhance their performance in currently existing applications. The hydrothermal method, as a typical solution-based approach, was proven to be an effective and convenient process in preparing various inorganic materials with diverse controllable morphologies and architectures.3 Especially, rare earth (RE) ion-doped fluorescent materials with monodisperse and uniform morphologies have gained wide attention due to their potential applications for many research issues, such as up-conversion (UC) and near-infrared (NIR) quantum cutting (QC).
As is known, UC is a process where low-energy light, usually NIR or infrared, is converted to higher energies, ultraviolet or visible, via multiple absorptions or energy transfers (ETs).4,5 Recently, it has been extensively investigated due to the potential applications in the fields of solid-state lasers, multicolor three dimensional displays, optical storage, and biological fluorescent labels.5–8 For UC materials, the most used activator ions are Ho3+, Er3+, and Tm3+, that are co-doped with Yb3+, which is an efficient sensitizer with a large absorption cross-section in the NIR region to make up for the lack of matched energy levels with the 980 nm photon energy of the activator ions. On the contrary, NIR QC involves down-conversion of one incident high-energy photon to two or more low-energy photons, which is extensively observed in RE ion-doped materials.9 To realize the NIR QC efficiently, other RE ions are generally co-doped with Yb3+ in the hosts, in which the cooperative or resonant ETs will occur. It is known that the most studied RE ion couples are Tb3+–Yb3+, Tm3+–Yb3+, Ho3+–Yb3+, and Pr3+–Yb3+, and the matrixes are usually crystals, glasses, or glass ceramics.9–14 For the time being, NIR QC has become a hot-focused research topic due to the promising application in solar cells.15–17 As we know, a mismatch between the solar spectrum and the band gap energy of silicon semiconductors exists, and photons with energies lower than the band gap cannot be absorbed, while for photons with energies larger than the band gap, the excess energy is lost by thermalization of the hot charge carriers.18 Taking these sources of energy losses into account for the solar spectrum, the maximum energy efficiency that can be reached is 30% for a crystalline Si solar cell with a bandgap of 1.12 eV.9 Considering this, if the conversion of one UV or visible photon into two NIR photons with energies near to 1.12 eV is realized though QC in a silicon solar cell, the energy loss related to thermalization of the hot charge carriers can be reduced and the solar cell efficiency will be enhanced greatly.16
So far, high quantum efficiencies (QEs) for UC luminescence and NIR QC are mostly obtained in fluorescent materials with low phonon energy, such as fluoride phosphors. However, fluorides are very sensitive to oxygen surface contamination, which may influence the luminescence properties and limit their application.19 Oxides generally show high chemical stability and environmentally-friendly characteristics, but usually have higher phonon energies. Based on these, Y6O5F8 combining the advantages of both fluorides and oxides could be an excellent host material for doping RE ions to realize the effective application in solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, the UC luminescence properties of Y6O5F8:Yb3+, Er3+, Tm3+ were reported by Wang et al.,20 but the morphologies of their samples are irregular, and the NIR QC properties were not conducted in their work. In this paper, RE3+-doped Y6O5F8 (RE = Yb, Er, and Ho) with various morphologies and multicolors were designed by a hydrothermal method, and the corresponding luminescence properties of UC and NIR QC were investigated in detailed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of Y(OH)CO3 and Y(OH)CO3:RE3+ (RE = Yb, Er, and Ho) precursors
In a typical synthesis of Y(OH)CO3, 0.7 mmol Y2O3 was dissolved in dilute HNO3 solution (1:1 v/v) by heating to 80 °C with agitation to form a clear Y(NO3)3 aqueous solution. Superfluous HNO3 was evaporated by continuous heating until the pH value of the Y(NO3)3 solution reached about 4. Then 4.0 g of urea was dissolved in 40 ml of deionized water, and was then added to 40 ml of the above Y(NO3)3 solution dropwise. The mixture was stirred continuously at room temperature for 30 min, and then heated to 90 °C for 2 h in a water bath. The resulting suspension was separated by centrifugation and collected after washing with deionized water three times. The RE3+ (RE = Yb, Er and Ho)-doped Y(OH)CO3 were prepared by the same procedures except that a stoichiometric amount of RE(NO3)3 was added to Y(NO3)3.
2.2 Preparation of Y6O5F8 and Y6O5F8:RE3+ (RE = Yb, Er, and Ho)
For a typical Y6O5F8 synthesis, the as-obtained Y(OH)CO3 precursor was dispersed in 30 ml of deionized water by ultrasonication. Then 5.6 mmol of KF·H2O was dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water which contains 0.1 g of a certain dispersant [i.e., hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)], and dripped into the above suspension followed by further stirring. After the mixture was agitated at room temperature for 30 min, it was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined, stainless steel autoclave containing 80 ml of suspension and was heated at 210 °C for 48 h. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the product was separated from the reaction media by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and finally dried overnight at 50 °C. The Y6(1−x)O5F8:xRE3+ (RE = Yb, Er and Ho) compounds were prepared by the same procedure except for using Y(OH)CO3:RE3+ as the precursors. The heat-treatment for the hydrothermal product was carried out at 650 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 75 °C h−1.
2.3 Characterization
The phase purity was determined using a Rigaku D/MAX-2400 powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) operating at 40 kV and 60 mA. The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were inspected by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi, S-4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai F30, operated at 300 kV). The chemistry component was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet NEXUS 670). The UC photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by using a 980 nm laser diode as the excitation source, with the HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorlog-3 Spectrofluorometer system. A 0.3 m double excitation monochromator and two emission monochromators record the emission spectra in the wavelength range of 200–850 nm (with a HamamatsuR928 photomultiplier tube) or in the wavelength range of 850–1650 nm (with a liquid nitrogen-cooled HamamatsuR5509-72 PMT). All the spectra measurements were performed at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology

3.1.1 Using CTAB as an additive. 
The typical XRD pattern of the Y(OH)CO3 precursor is presented in Fig. 1a. From the enlarged part, it shows two main broad bands around 29° and 47°, implying its amorphous nature, which is consistent with the XRD pattern for Gd(OH)CO3 reported in ref. 21. To further examine the chemical composition of the precursor, FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out, as shown in Fig. 2a. The absorption bands centered at 3400 cm−1, 1520 and 1400 cm−1, 1080 cm−1, 841 cm−1, 750 and 690 cm−1 are attributed to O–H, νasO–C–O, C–O, π-CO32−, and δ-CO32−, respectively.22,23 This observation reveals the presence of the hydroxyl and carbonate groups, which agrees with the chemical formula of Y(OH)CO3 identified from the XRD pattern.

The hydrothermal product formed using CTAB as the additive is a white powder, and crystallized into the Y(OH)1.63F1.37 phase perfectly (agreeing with the JCPD Standard card no. 80-2007, Fig. 1b). This hydrothermal product could be transformed into the pure Y6O5F8 phase after annealing at 650 °C for 2 h, reflected from the XRD pattern in Fig. 1c, which is in good agreement with the JCPD Standard card no. 80-1125. The broad diffraction peaks indicate nanocrystallines may be generated in the hydrothermal process, and by the Debye–Scherrer formula,22 the average crystalline size of Y6O5F8 is estimated to be about 55 nm. The FT-IR spectroscopy of Y(OH)1.63F1.37 in Fig. 2b exhibits the typical O–H stretching (3650 and 3400 cm−1) and Y–O bond (513 cm−1), but the O–H stretching has almost disappeared after annealing due to the phase transition (Fig. 2c), leaving only the strong absorption peaks ascribed to the Y–O bond (532 and 450 cm−1),23,24 and this result is in agreement with the phase analysis of the XRD in Fig. 1.

Fig. 3 presents the SEM images of both Y(OH)1.63F1.37 and Y6O5F8. Fig. 3a shows that uniform microrods were obtained in the hydrothermal process. From the enlarged images of Fig. 3b and c, it can be observed clearly that the rods exhibit a regular hexagonal prism shape with a hollow structure. The average length and outer diameter of the hollow hexagonal prisms are estimated to be about 12 and 1.3 μm, respectively, and the wall-thickness is about 250 nm. Moreover, every hollow hexagonal prism takes on a very smooth outer surface but irregular inter surface. After heat-treatment at 650 °C, the monodisperse and uniform morphology features were maintained (Fig. 3d) in spite of the phase transition from Y(OH)1.63F1.37 to Y6O5F8. The size of the hollow hexagonal prisms is almost the same as that before annealing, but the surface has become very rough (Fig. 3e and f). Under higher magnification, in the inset of Fig. 3f, small submicron particles between 100 and 200 nm are found to consist of the microtubes.

To further investigate the morphological characteristics of Y6O5F8, a TEM measurement was carried out. Fig. 4a shows the TEM image of the Y(OH)CO3 precursor, which exhibits a spheroidal morphology. When the reactant was treated hydrothermally for 15 h and annealed at 650 °C for 2 h afterwards, the hollow structure had been achieved on the whole, but some initial nanoparticles originating from the Y(OH)CO3 precursor still adhered to the surface of the microtubes (Fig. 4b). However, when the hydrothermal time was prolonged to 48 h, a final product of Y6O5F8 with a smooth surface was been obtained, as presented in Fig. 4c. From the enlarged edge of the tube in the inset of Fig. 4c, submicron particles ranging from 100 to 200 nm are found to consist of the microtubes, which is agreement with the observation in the SEM images. Based on this, we can predict that the initial spheroidal particles of the Y(OH)CO3 precursor were assembled to the final microtubes, and this conclusion can be further verified by the time-dependent experiments below. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis spectrum of Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Er3+ is given in Fig. 4d, and shows that all the composing elements of the sample have been detected, and no other impure elements are found. The HRTEM image at the edge of the microtubes is presented in the inset of Fig. 4d. The lattice fringes are clearly visible with a spacing of 0.317 nm, agreeing well with the lattice spacing of (161) of orthorhombic Y6O5F8.

To disclose the growth process of the hollow hexagonal prisms, time-dependent experiments were conducted by keeping other reaction parameters unchanged. The hydrothermal times are selected to be 3, 6, 15, 24, and 48 h, and the corresponding XRD patterns are given in Fig. S1† for Y(OH)1.63F1.37 and Fig. S2† for Y6O5F8. When the reaction time was 3 h, the hydrothermal product exhibits very poor crystallinity (Fig. S1a†), and it crystallized into the YOF phase (not the desired product of Y6O5F8) after annealing at 650 °C for 2 h (agreeing with the JCPD Standard card no. 712100, Fig. S2a†). When the hydrothermal time exceeds 8 h, the pure phase of either Y(OH)1.63F1.37 or Y6O5F8 with perfect crystallinity has been obtained (Fig. S1b–S1e and S2b–S1e†), implying that the desired products were being forming gradually. Fig. 5a–5j presents the SEM images of the intermediates of Y6O5F8 with various hydrothermal times [(a, b) for 3 h, (c, d) for 8 h, (e, f) for 15 h, (g, h) for 24 h, and (i, j) for 48 h] after annealing at 650 °C for 2 h. At the initial stage within 3 h, the product exhibits agglomerated submicron particles, and almost no rods are formed. When the reactant undergoes hydrothermal treatment for 8 h, a lot of hollow hexagonal prisms start to be produced by assembling the initial nanoparticles. After hydrothermal reaction for 15 h, most of the hollow hexagonal prisms have been obtained, except for some remaining nanoparticles adhering to the surface of the prisms. After 24 h, the residual nanoparticles were reduced further. Finally, after 48 h, the reaction has been completed, and monodisperse hollow hexagonal prisms were formed. CTAB plays an important role in the preparation of the hollow structure. The solution of the CTAB contains hydrophobic C–N organic groups,25 which could chelate metal ions and hinder particle aggregation. The dispersed particles accumulate and form the microtubes though a reconstruction process. Similar hollow structures and interpretations can be found in ref. 26. The Y(OH)1.63F1.37 sample before annealing demonstrates a similar morphology evolution process (Fig. S3†), indicating that heat-treatment has no visible effect on the size and shape for samples transferring from the Y(OH)1.63F1.37 to the Y6O5F8 phase.

3.1.2 Using PVP as an additive. 
To study the effect of different additives on the morphology, samples with PVP as a dispersant were prepared. The XRD investigation indicates that the obtained sample of either Y(OH)1.63F1.37 by the hydrothermal route for 48 h (Fig. S4d†) or Y6O5F8 annealed at 650 °C for 2 h afterwards (Fig. S5d†) is single-phase. The typical SEM images of both Y(OH)1.63F1.37 and Y6O5F8 are given in Fig. 6a, b and c, d, respectively. Good dispersion and uniform shapes are obtained for both samples. From the enlarged images of Fig. 6b and d, numerous rods are observed to assemble into monodisperse bundles with an average length and diameter of about 4 and 1.5 μm, respectively. The above result reveals that the heat-treatment does not cause any change in the size and shape of the samples, but the surface of every rod becomes rough after annealing.
 Fig. 6  SEM images of both (a, b) Y(OH)1.63F1.37 and (c, d) Y6O5F8. 
To reveal the corresponding morphological evolution, a series of time-dependent experiments were carried out and the intermediate products collected at different reaction intervals after annealing at 650 °C for 2 h, and were then investigated by SEM (Fig. 7). In the first stage of the hydrothermal process, within 5 h, separated microrods are produced gradually from numerous nanoparticles of the Y(OH)CO3 precursor, as can be seen in Fig. 7a and b. When the hydrothermal time is prolonged to 10 h, on the whole the separated microrods start to aggregate into embryo bundles (Fig. 7c and d). After 21 h, the monodisperse bundles have been formed, except for some remaining non-assembled rods (Fig. 7e and f). The reaction is completed after 48 h, as displayed in Fig. 7g and h. On the whole, the samples tend to form long rods or tubes during the initial reaction process in the hydrothermal environment as witnessed in the SEM images, regardless of the surfactants, which is in agreement with the result in ref. 20. However, in the later reaction stage, with PVP present, the formed rods aggregated into many bundles, and we predict this process could result from the self-aggregation or self-assembly of the initial rods – maybe due to the noncovalent interactions of the long chain molecules of PVP attached to the surfaces of the microcrystals. The Y(OH)1.63F1.37 product without annealing shows a similar morphology evolution process in the hydrothermal reaction (Fig. S6†), indicating that the morphologies were not destroyed in the heat-treatment.

3.1.3 Using EDTA as additive. 
In this system, EDTA is also used to control the morphology. Fig. S7† shows the XRD patterns of both Y(OH)1.63F1.37 with hydrothermal reaction for 48 h and Y6O5F8 after annealing at 650 °C for 2 h afterwards, which reveals that the as-prepared samples are single-phase. The SEM images of Y(OH)1.63F1.37 are given in Fig. 8a and b. A uniform and monodisperse prism-like morphology was formed in the hydrothermal reaction, and these prisms with an average length of 12 μm and diameter of 3.5 μm are observed to consist of several thin microrods. Fig. 8c–f show the SEM images of Y6O5F8. It can be seen that the dispersion, shape, and size hardly change, except that the surface of every prism gets very rough after annealing, which is composed of numerous submicron particles (Fig. 8f). In addition, distinguishing of the hexagonal prism profile can be observed in Fig. 8e, and every hexagonal prism is formed by gathering several microrods (Fig. 8d), similar to that of Y(OH)1.63F1.37 in Fig. 8b. The time-dependent experiments of the solid hexagonal prisms indicate that the formation process is similar to those in Fig. 5 and 7, and a schematic illustration of Y(OH)1.63F1.37 or Y6O5F8 by using EDTA as an additive is depicted in Scheme 1 to interpret the formation mechanism. Microrods are generated in the initial stage from the Y(OH)CO3 precursor (a and b). Then the existing microrods start to gather gradually into the basic hexagonal prism structure (c). At last, the uniform solid hexagonal prisms are formed completely with the prolonged reaction time (d). This self-aggregation or self-assembly process could be owing to the excellent chelating and capping ability of EDTA, since EDTA possesses four carboxyl groups (–COOH) and two lone pairs of electrons on two nitrogen atoms which can act as binding sites and help to form hydrogen bonds, facilitating the self-aggregation or self-assembly process.27

3.2 UC luminescence of Y6O5F8:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb, Er, and Ho)

Fig. 9 displays the UC emission spectra of Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Er3+ by using CTAB as the additive under DL excitation of 980 nm at various pump powers. Three emission peaks around 525, 548, and 670 nm are observed, which are attributed to the 2H11/2–4I15/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2, and 4F9/2–4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. The long-wavelength emission at 670 nm is predominant, being much more intense than the other emissions. The corresponding chromaticity coordinates calculated from the emission spectrum for 370 mW by the method using the 1931 CIE (Commission International de l'Eclairage France) system are (0.642, 0.354), indicating a good red color purity. Inset (b) of Fig. 9 shows the UC fluorescence photograph of YOF:10%Yb3+, 1%Er3+ dispersed in ethanol solvent under 980 nm DL excitation, which shows an intense red color. Besides, from the spectra, it is obvious that the emission intensities become stronger with enhanced pump powers. It is well known that for unsaturated UC processes, the relationship between the UC emission intensity I and the pump power P could be expressed as follows:28 If ∝ Pn(1)where If is the fluorescent intensity, P is the pump power, and n is the number of photons required to populate the emitting state. For the strongest emission peak at 670 nm, a plot of ln Ifversus P yields a straight line with a slope n for the relatively low power pumps (<370 mW), as shown in the inset of Fig. 9, and the n value obtained is equal to about 1.49. Hence, it is a two-photon process, which agrees with the two-step sequential transitions from the 4I15/2 ground state to the 4I11/2 intermediate state, then to the 4F7/2 state of Er3+ in the excitation process.29 On the other hand, a typical saturation phenomenon for a relative high power pump (≥370 mW) appears in inset (a) of Fig. 9. The Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Er3+ samples prepared using PVP and EDTA as the additives demonstrate similar spectra profiles (Fig. S8 and S9,† respectively) with the chromaticity coordinates of (0.678, 0.319) and (0.663, 0.334) for 370 mW, respectively, which displays that the different morphologies hardly had an effect on the UC luminescence properties.
 Fig. 9  UC emission spectra of Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Er3+ using CTAB as additive under DL excitation of 980 nm, inset (a) shows dependence of UC emission intensity on excitation powder, inset (b) shows UC fluorescence photograph of Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Er3+ under a 980 nm DL excitation. 

Fig. 10 shows the UC emission spectra of Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Ho3+ using CTAB as the additive under DL excitation of 980 nm at various pump powers. The predominating emission peaks are located at about 544 nm, ascribed to the (5F4, 5S2)–5I8 transition of Ho3+. The two relatively weak emission peaks around 651 and 753 nm could be assigned to the 5F5–5I8 and (5F4, 5S2)–5I8 transitions of Ho3+, respectively. Similarly, all the emission peaks exhibit enhanced intensities with increasing excitation power. By studying the pump power dependence of the UC emissions according to eqn (1), the n values for the three emission peaks of 544, 651, and 753 nm are calculated to be about 1.55, 1.77, and 1.49, respectively [inset (a) of Fig. 10]. Hence, the main UC mechanism for Yb3+–Ho3+ pairs in this host is a two-photon process, that is, the two-step sequential transitions from the 5I8 ground state to the 5I6 intermediate state, then to the 5F4 state of Ho3+. The chromaticity coordinates were calculated to be (0.327, 0.662) for 370 mW, indicating a yellowish green color. The corresponding UC fluorescence photograph of Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Ho3+ dispersed in ethanol solvent under 980 nm DL excitation is presented in the inset (b) of Fig. 10. The Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Ho3+ samples prepared using PVP and EDTA as the additives demonstrate similar spectra profiles, implying that the different morphologies hardly have an effect on the UC luminescence properties.

3.3 NIR QC of Y6O5F8:Yb3+, Ho3+
The possible NIR QC mechanisms for the Ho3+–Yb3+ couple are shown in Fig. 11.30,31 Firstly, for excitation at 450 nm, three feasible ET processes from Ho3+ to Yb3+ could occur, giving rise to the NIR emission of Yb3+: (1) a cooperative ET (CET) process (CET in Fig. 11): Ho3+(5F3) → 2Yb3+(2F5/2) + hν; (2) a resonant cross-relaxation process from the 5S2, 5F4 states populated from the 5F1 state nonradiatively (CR1 in Fig. 11): Ho3+(5S2, 5F4) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Ho3+(5I6) + Yb3+(2F5/2) + hν; (3) a resonant cross-relaxation process from the 5F5 state populated nonradiatively from higher energy levels (CR2 in Fig. 11): Ho3+(5F5) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Ho3+(5I7) + Yb3+(2F5/2) + hν. Secondly, for excitation at 360 nm, one ultraviolet photon absorbed by Ho3+ could be converted into two Yb3+ NIR photons through two-step sequential cross-relaxations (CR3 and CR4 in Fig. 11) due to that the energy gap between 5G4 and 5F5, 5F5 and 5I7 are resonant with the energy of the transition from 2F7/2 to 2F5/2 on Yb3+. In this work, a series of Y6(1−x)O5F8:xYb3+, 1%Ho3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 15%) samples were prepared to study the NIR QC properties of the Yb3+–Ho3+ couple in the Y6O5F8 host, which could have the potential to promote the energy efficiency of crystalline silicon cells.

Fig. 12 presents the emission spectra of Y6(1−x)O5F8:xYb3+, 1%Ho3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 15%) upon 450 nm excitation. In the visible region, with increasing Yb3+ content, the intensities of the 5F3–5I8 (488 nm), (5F4, 5S2)–5I8 (544 nm), 5F5–5I8 (651 nm), and (5F4, 5S2)–5I7 (755 nm) transitions of Ho3+ decrease heavily, implying an efficient ET from Ho3+ to Yb3+. The excitation spectrum, by monitoring the excitation at 980 nm of the Yb3+ 2F5/2–2F7/2 transition (inset of Fig. 12) also confirms this efficient ET, since it shows all the excitation peaks of Ho3+. In the NIR region, two strong emission peaks are observed around 980 and 1190 nm, attributed to the Yb3+ 2F5/2–2F7/2 transition and Ho3+ 5I6–5I8 transition, respectively,30 and the former intensity is much weaker than the latter one. Furthermore, the optimal Yb3+-doping concentration is found to be 5 mol% for the Yb3+ 2F5/2–2F7/2 transition, and less than 10 mol% for the Ho3+ 5I6–5I8 transition. These results seem contradictory to the mentioned NIR QC mechanisms, with the detailed discussion shown below. In Fig. 11, the emission around 980 nm results from both the CET and CR1 processes, and the emission of Ho3+ 5I6–5I8 is mainly followed by the occurrence of the CR1 process. In addition, the CET process is known to be inefficient at lower Yb3+ contents due to its intrinsic nature, but at a relatively high Yb3+ concentration of 10 mol%, the CET process could become efficient, and this efficiency (ηCET) can be estimated by the following equation:10 (2)where I denotes the decay intensity, and x%Yb denotes the Yb3+ content. To determine the ηCET for Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Ho3+ as a typical sample, the decay curves with 450 nm excitation and 487 nm emission for Y6(1−x)O5F8:xYb3+, 1%Ho3+ (x = 0% and 10%) are shown in Fig. 13a. Both the decay curves demonstrate a double-exponential feature, and the average lifetimes are determined by the following equation: <τ> = (A1τ21 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2)(3)

 Fig. 13  Decay curves of Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Ho3+. 
The corresponding lifetime values are summarized in Table 1. Thus, ηCET was calculated to be 72.2%, which indicates that the CET process as an extra decay pathway for energies at the 5F3 level is very efficient. In this case, the number of remaining photons that relaxed to lower energy levels than the 5F3 level, to give other emissions, is small. Besides, the resonant ET efficiencies for CR1 (ηCR1) and CR2 (ηCR2) calculated by eqn (2) are 80.7% and 65.2%, respectively, which are also efficient (the corresponding decay curves and lifetimes are given in Fig. 13b,c and Table 1). All the above results indicate that the Yb3+ 2F5/2–2F7/2 emission should demonstrate a stronger intensity and higher quenching concentration than those of the Ho3+ 5I6–5I8 emission. However, the NIR emission spectra in Fig. 12 shows distinct results. Based on these, we predict that a back ET process from Yb3+ to Ho3+ has occurred by Yb3+(2F5/2) + Ho3+(5I8) → Yb3+(2F7/2) + Ho3+(5I6) + hν, since it was reported that the back ET phenomenon widely exists in RE ion multi-doped fluorescent materials.32–34 This ET not only increases the Ho3+ 5I6–5I8 emission intensity but also reduces the Yb3+ 2F5/2–2F7/2 emission intensity, leading to the spectral features in Fig. 12.

The QE is known to be defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons that are absorbed. It can be understood from Fig. 11, that the extra photons emitted only come from the CET and CR1 process for every phonon absorbed when excited at 450 nm. Therefore, supposing that all the excited Yb3+ and the residual excited Ho3+ decay radiatively, a modified calculation equation for the total QE (ηQE) when excited at 450 nm can be theoretically expressed as follows according to ref. 10: ηQE = 1 + ηCET + (1 − ηCET)ηCR1(4)where the last two terms stand for the extra QEs for the CTE and CR1 processes, respectively. The total ηQE for Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Ho3+ is calculated to 194.6% by this formulation. The so high QE partly results from the Ho3+ 5I6–5I8 emission (1190 nm), which is useless to enhance the efficiency of Si solar cells, since this emission does not match the spectral response of Si solar cells.
For another NIR QC mechanism of CR3 and CR4 in Fig. 11, the corresponding spectral characteristics of Y6(1−x)O5F8:xYb3+, 1%Ho3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 15%) were also investigated. Fig. 14 presents their excitation spectra by monitoring of the Ho3+ emission at 544 nm, which have been normalized to the excitation peak at 450 nm. All the excitation peaks could be ascribed to the characteristic 4f–4f transitions of Ho3+. It can be seen that the intensities of the excitation peaks corresponding to the transition to the 5G4 level, as well as the upper levels (from 300 to 400 nm, denoted as part A), decrease gradually compared with those below the 5G4 levels (from 400 to 500 nm, denoted as part B) with increasing Yb3+ concentration, whereas the excitation peaks inside parts A and B undergo almost no change in their relative intensities. This intensity decrease, when excitation is not lower than the 5G4 level, is due to the presence of CR3 in Fig. 11, which is evidence for the occurrence of NIR QC. The efficiency of this cross-relaxation process can be expressed as31 (5)where A/B is the ratio of the integrated excitation intensity between parts A and B, the subscript 0% and x% refer to the Ho3+ single doped sample and the Ho3+–Yb3+ co-doped samples, respectively. According to eqn (5), the ηCR values for x = 5%, 10%, and 15% are calculated to be 12.3%, 21.0%, and 33.1%, respectively.
 Fig. 14  Excitation spectra of Y6(1−x)O5F8:xYb3+, 1%Ho3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 15%) by monitoring at 544 nm. 
The emission spectra of the Y6(1−x)O5F8:xYb3+, 1%Ho3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 15%) samples in the visible region upon 360 nm excitation are presented in Fig. 15, which reveal similar regularity in the intensities and spectral profiles to those in Fig. 12, indicating an efficient ET from Ho3+ to Yb3+. The emission spectra of Y6(1−x)O5F8:xYb3+, 1%Ho3+ (5% ≤ x ≤ 15%) in the NIR region are given in the inset of Fig. 15. It shows two strong emission peaks at 980 and 1190 nm, attributed to the Yb3+ 2F5/2–2F7/2 and Ho3+ 5I6–5I8 transitions, respectively. In addition, the quenching concentration was observed to be 10%. According to the NIR QC mechanisms in Fig. 11, the energy excited into the levels above the 5G4 state would be relaxed to 5G4 state first, then part of the energy was transferred to Yb3+ by CR3 and CR4, completing the NIR QC process. In this process, the extra QE for every phonon absorbed can be expressed by eqn (5), assuming that nonradiative energy losses caused by defects and impurities do not exist. The residual energy at the 5G4 state would be relaxed gradually to lower energy levels such as 5F3, and undergo similar ET and emission processes as those under the 450 nm excitation discussed above. This conclusion can be verified by the drastic decrease of lifetimes at the 5F3 and (5S2, 5F4) levels for Y5.34O5F8:10%Yb3+, 1%Ho3+ when excited at 360 nm, as shown in Fig. S10† and Table 1. This is why the NIR emission spectrum exhibits a strong intensity around 1190 nm under 360 nm excitation.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, RE3+-doped Y6O5F8 (RE = Yb, Er, and Ho) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Microarchitectures for monodisperse microtubes, microbundles, and solid hexagonal prisms were designed by adding different surfactants. It was found that all the formations of different morphologies underwent the assembly process from nanoparticles or microrods by carrying out time-dependent experiments. Under DL excitation of 980 nm, the Yb3+–Er3+- and Yb3+–Ho3+-doped Y6O5F8 samples exhibit intense red and green UC emissions, respectively. The corresponding UC mechanisms were discussed though the pump power dependence of UC emissions, which involve two-phonon processes. For Yb3+–Ho3+ co-doped Y6O5F8 samples, the NIR QC was identified upon 360 and 450 nm excitation. A back ET from Yb3+ to Ho3+ was first proposed to interpret the emission spectral characteristics. The novel Y6O5F8:Yb3+, Ho3+ phosphors could explore a new approach to maximize the performance of silicon solar cells.
