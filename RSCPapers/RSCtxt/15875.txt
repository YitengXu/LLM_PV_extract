    , Accepted 20th January 2021First published on 20th January 2021AbstractTitanium dioxide aerogel (TiAP) powders were prepared by lyophilization of peroxo-polytitanic gels followed by annealing at 800 °C to obtain an anatase structure. The surface modification of TiAP was performed for the first time by low amounts of Ce ions (in the range of 0.0025 to 0.025 wt%) using a wet impregnation method. The photocatalytic activity of the aerogel samples was investigated for the removal of different organic pollutants (i.e., Rhodamine B, phenol and caffeine) and the results were compared with the reference P25. Both TiAP and Ce ion surface-modified TiAP (Ce/TiAP) have exhibited better degradation efficiencies for the removal of pollutants than P25, especially for Ce/TiAP with an enhancement in the degradation efficiencies of +18% and +37% for the removal of caffeine and Rhodamine B, respectively. These results have been partly explained by the high active surface area of Ce/TiAP compared to TiAP as well as its better photoelectrochemical properties which have shown, for instance, ∼10% increased incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency at 360 nm. Interestingly, the energetic position of the valence band maximum of Ce/TiAP is shifted from 3.2 eV to 2.8 eV (compared to TiAP), thus improving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydroxyl radicals. Indeed, the presence of HO˙ is confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance, and fluorescence spectroscopy and their photoinduced generation are enhanced in the case of Ce/TiAP. Finally, the surface modification of TiAP by cerium ions led not only to better photoinduced properties, thus limiting the electron–hole pair recombination, but also to the improvement of ROS generation via different plausible mechanisms.
Introduction
Hazardous pollutants such as dyes, pesticides and pharmaceutical compounds, which are predominantly emitted by industrial activities, are the main source of contamination of water bodies.1–4 Concerning the treatment of wastewaters, several technologies, including physical, chemical and biological, have been coupled to purify water.5–7 Although the current technologies are efficient to some extent, there is still intense research to improve these treatments in order to limit the generation of other wastes and to decrease the costs.5,8 In addition, the environment agencies around the World have imposed stringent norms, especially in the European Union with the directives 91/271/CEE and 2008/105/CE on water quality and pollution control. Among the strategies to reach both efficient pollutant removal and sustainability, photochemical processes like photocatalysis are promising techniques since they can utilize sunlight to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are capable of decomposing harmless pollutants into non-toxic byproducts.7–9 As a photocatalyst, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely investigated due to its long-term stability, strong oxidizing power, non-toxicity and low cost.8 Among different nanostructured TiO2 materials (e.g., nanotubes, nanorods, nanopowders), TiO2 aerogels exhibit high surface area and porosity, and high amounts of the anatase phase,10–13 thus leading to improved photocatalytic efficiency for the removal of organic pollutants.13–15 The mechanism of TiO2 photocatalysis is based on the generation of e−/h+ pairs under suitable light irradiation (hν ≥ Eg, i.e. λ ≤ 390 nm), and subsequent formation of ROS that decomposes the pollutants.9,16,17 However, due to the relatively large energy bandgap of TiO2 (Eg = ∼3.2 for the anatase phase), only UVA light can generate e−/h+ pairs. Moreover, the fast e−/h+ pair recombination rate in TiO2 reduces its photocatalytic efficiency.16–18
To enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, modification with metal/non-metal (F, C, N, Fe, Cu, Mn, etc.)19,20 is reported to increase the incident light utilization and reduce e−/h+ pair recombination, which in turn effectively increases the quantum yield, i.e. the photocatalytic efficiency.21,22 Based on previous reports,22–24 the crystalline structure, morphology, and optical and electronic properties of TiO2 can be modified/adjusted using rare earth metals (Eu, La, Sc, Y, etc.). Among the rare earth metals, Ce possesses interconvertible oxidation states (Ce3+/Ce4+) resulting in (i) the varying oxygen concentration in the lattice, (ii) increasing the active surface sites, (iii) altering the band position, and (iv) suppressing the grain growth of TiO2.8,25–27 Additionally, Ce can activate in situ photogenerated H2O2, thus leading to increased ROS generation.72 However, an excess of Ce hinders the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2.26 Indeed, excess Ce ions act as recombination centers for e−/h+ pairs.26,28–31 Therefore, it appears crucial to modify TiO2 (i) with a low amount of Ce ions and (ii) preferentially at the surface of the material since photocatalysis follows the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism32,33 (i.e., it proceeds at the photocatalyst/pollutant interface). An overview of some important works on Ce-modified TiO2 is summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). It is interesting that most of these published works are based on Ce doping and not on surface modification. This is one of the reasons that has motivated us to study Ce ion surface modified TiO2 systems which are scarcely reported in the literature.
On the other hand, the literature describing Ce ions as surface-modifiers of TiO2 (and not as a dopant) is scarce. In this work, titanium dioxide aerogels (TiAP) were prepared by lyophilization (freeze-drying) of peroxo-polytitanic acid gels followed by annealing in air at 800 °C.34,35 To the best of our knowledge, we report the surface modification of such TiAP powders by Ce ions for the first time. To this end, impregnation of a low amount of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate solution (from 0.1 to 0.005 wt%, thus leading to Ce ions between 0.025 and 0.00125 wt%) was used. After a comprehensive physical, optical and photoelectrochemical characterization of the samples, we have thoroughly discussed the effect of cerium ions and provided new insights into the photocatalytic efficiency of surface-modified Ce/TiAP. The photocatalytic study involved the degradation of different types of relevant pollutants in water under solar-like irradiation (mostly UVA light). Indeed, as model pollutants, we have tested (i) Rhodamine B (RB) which is widely used as a colorant in textiles and food industries, but it has also been proven to be carcinogenic and toxic to both humans and animals;36–38 (ii) phenol since its derivatives are non-biodegradable and possess acute toxicity to the aquatic environment;5 and (iii) caffeine (CAF) which is a highly used psychoactive drug that has adverse negative effects on the environment.39 These hazardous organic pollutants are easily detected and accumulated in the environment.40–43 To further highlight the relevance of our study, the obtained results are compared with commercial AEROXIDE P25 powders.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
Titanium(IV) oxysulfate (TiOSO4·xH2O, >29% Ti as TiO2, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a titanium precursor for the preparation of TiAP. Ammonia (NH3, 25–29%) and hydrogen peroxide (30% H2O2) were purchased from PENTA SLOVENSKO, s.r.o. (Slovakia). Cerium ammonium nitrate (Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6, 98+%) was purchased from Alfa Aaesar. Commercially available AEROXIDE TiO2 P25 is used as a reference sample. Rhodamine B (99+%, Acros Organics), caffeine (ReagentPlus®, Sigma-Aldrich), and phenol (99.0%, CENTRALCHEM, s.r.o., Slovakia) were used as model organic pollutants. Terephthalic acid and hydroxy-terephthalic acid (used in the assessment of HO˙ radicals) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ammonium oxalate monohydrate (99+%, Acros Organics) and 1,4 benzoquinone (99.0%, Acros Organics) were used for radical scavenging experiments.
Synthesis of TiAP and Ce/TiAP
The titanium dioxide aerogel powders (TiAP) were prepared by freeze-drying and subsequent annealing of peroxo-polytitanic acid gel according to previous reports.34,35 Briefly, titanium oxysulfate solution (0.2 M) was prepared at 35 °C under constant stirring. After, the solution was cooled down to 0 °C followed by the addition of ammonia until it reached pH 8, thus resulting in the formation of a white precipitate. The precipitate was filtered and washed at ambient temperature. After several steps of resuspension, decantation and washing, the product was suspended in 350 mL of distilled water followed by the addition of H2O2 until the pH was in the range of 1–2. The suspension was stirred at room temperature for about 30 min until a clear transparent yellow solution was formed. Afterwards, the yellow solution was sprayed into liquid N2 and subsequently lyophilized using a freeze dryer at a temperature of −64 °C and a pressure of 5–10 mtorr. The obtained yellow foamy aerogel was annealed at 800 °C for 2 h to form TiAP.
The cerium ions modified titanium dioxide aerogel powders (Ce/TiAP) were prepared through the wet impregnation method. Firstly, a TiAP suspension was prepared using distilled water (100 mg in 100 mL). Secondly, the TiAP suspension was mixed with 0.1 mL of cerium ammonium nitrate precursor solution (1.0, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 mg mL−1, respectively) and kept under stirring for 1 h to obtain Ce/TiAP with different concentrations of Ce ions (0.025, 0.0125, 0.0025 and 0.00125 wt%, respectively). Thirdly, the mixture was centrifuged, and the collected Ce/TiAP was dried at 80 °C for 2 h. Finally, both TiAP and Ce/TiAP were annealed in air at 800 °C for 2 h to obtain a crystalline anatase structure. The nominal amount of Ce in the surface-modified TiAP ranges from 0.025 to 0.00125 wt%, which corresponds to the range 1.5 × 10−2–7.5 × 10−4 at%.
Structural and optical characterization
The crystalline phase composition of all the samples was analyzed by X-ray diffraction using a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å) in grazing incidence mode (GI-XRD). To investigate the morphology of the samples, and more particularly the surface, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM ARM 200 cF, 200 kV) studies were performed. For TEM investigations, the powder samples were dispersed by sonication in ethanol for 5 min and loaded onto a holey carbon-coated Cu TEM grid. After drying in air, the samples were studied by TEM, High Resolution TEM (HRTEM), Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED), and Scanning TEM (STEM) methods. For detailed SEM images of the nanocrystals, a STEM-SEI detector was used. An ultrascan CCD camera with a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels and the Digital Micrograph software package were used for obtaining and processing of images. To identify the presence of Ce in TiAP, Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) was performed using a reflectron type time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ToF-SIMS IV, ION-TOF, Germany) equipped with a bismuth ion source. Pulsed 25 keV Bi+ ions were used as primary ions at a current of 1 pA with the total primary ion dose density below the static limit of 1013 ions cm−2. Secondary ion mass spectra were recorded by scanning over a selected 100 × 100 μm2 analysis area. The active surface area, pore diameter and pore volume were measured using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C using a Quantachrome Nova 4200e instrument. Prior to the measurement, the samples were outgassed for 48 h at 23 °C. The specific surface area was calculated by the BET (Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller) method and the pore diameter and pore volume were calculated using a cylindrical pore model (BJH).44,45 To investigate the optical properties of TiAP and Ce/TiAP, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was used in the wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm using an Ocean Optics USB650 UV spectrometer equipped with an optical fibre (R200-7-SR) using deuterium and tungsten halogen lamps as the light sources. The Kubelka–Munk function and Tauc plot were then used to determine the optical energy bandgap (Eg) of TiAP and Ce/TiAP. The valence band maximum (VBM) was measured by Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) using an Omicron multi-probe system with photons of energy He(I) = 21.2 eV.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Prior to photoelectrochemical measurements, the samples were drop-coated as a thin layer on Ti foil (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) followed by annealing at 300 °C for 2 h.46 The photocurrent measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell using Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode and a photoactive layer as a working electrode at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in an aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution in the spectral range from 300 nm to 500 nm. A photoelectric spectrophotometer (Instytut Fotonowy) with a 150 W Xe lamp and a monochromator with a bandwidth of 5 nm connected with an AUTOLAB modular electrochemical system (PGSTAT 204; MetrohmAutolab B. V.; Nova 1.10 software) were used for photocurrent measurements. The photocurrent transients were recorded under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles of 10 s). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded in the potential range from −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl to +1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl with a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1, starting at 0 V towards positive voltages (three-times repeated voltammetry cycles) in the dark and under UV light irradiation (λ = 350 nm), respectively.
Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic activity of P25, TiAP and Ce/TiAP samples was investigated under solar-like irradiation for the degradation of different pollutants including Rhodamine B (5 ppm), caffeine (20 ppm) and phenol (20 ppm). The solar-like irradiation was generated using a metal–halogen arc-lamp (HQI TS – OSRAM 400W/D6500K) equipped with a pyrex glass filter to cut-off UVB irradiation. The intensity of UVA light in the wavelength range 335–380 nm was 1.3 mW cm−2. In a typical procedure, a 30 mL pollutant solution containing 0.2 g L−1 of photoactive samples was kept in the dark for 30 min to reach the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Then, during irradiation, the suspension was kept under constant magnetic stirring and air bubbling, and 2 mL of samples were withdrawn at predetermined reaction times. Before analysis of the degradation extent, each sample was centrifugated, and the collected supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm PTFE filter).
In the case of RB degradation, only the decolorization was observed for 10 min of irradiation time. To this end, the degradation extent was determined by obtaining the absorbance at 554 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Jasco V-530). In the case of CAF degradation, the degradation extent at a predetermined reaction time was investigated using a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography system (HPLC, Nexera LC-20AD XR) equipped with a C18 column (Agilent) and a diode array detector (prominence SPD-M20A) set at 272 nm. The mobile phase was composed of a mixture of Milli-Q water and acetonitrile (ACN) acidified by 0.1% H3PO4 in gradient eluent mode (H2O/ACN from 80:20 to 20:80 reached in 6 min). The flow rate was 0.8 mL min−1, and the injection volume was 25 μL. In addition, mineralization was monitored using total organic carbon (TOC, Shimadzu TOC 5000A) analysis as in the case of phenol degradation. For TOC analysis, a longer irradiation time was used (2 h). Repeated runs of photocatalytic removal of RB, phenol and CAF have been performed without the regeneration of the photocatalyst. For RB degradation, irradiation cycles are 10 min long while for phenol and CAF mineralization (analyzed by TOC), each cycle is 60 min long.
Study of the photocatalytic mechanism
The generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO˙) under solar-like irradiation for P25, TiAP and Ce/TiAP samples was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy (Shimadzu RF-6000). The experimental procedure involved the addition of titania powder to the terephthalate solution. Before UVA irradiation, the suspension was kept in the dark for 30 min. Upon irradiation, hydroxyl radicals allowed to react with terephthalate to form hydroxy terephthalate, which is a fluorescent compound (λexc = 310 nm and λem = 425 nm).47,48 To avoid light scattering by suspended particles, each sample was previously centrifugated before analysis of the supernatant. For quantification of photogenerated HO˙, a calibration curve was plotted using hydroxy terephthalate solution with the concentration ranging from 0.1 μM to 0.1 mM. Further analysis of the presence of reactive oxygen species in the form of radicals was performed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The X-band cw-EPR spectra (modulation frequency of 100 kHz) were monitored with an EMXplus spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a High Sensitivity Probe-head (Bruker) in the small quartz flat cell (Wilmad-LabGlass, WG 808-Q). The suspensions prepared by mixing the corresponding stock solution/suspension in deionized water were irradiated at 295 K directly in the EPR resonator utilizing an LED@365 nm source (λmax = 365 nm; Bluepoint LED, Hönle UV Technology; irradiance 10 mW cm−2). The EPR spectra were recorded in situ during/after a defined exposure. The spin trapping agents, i.e. 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, distilled and stored at −20 °C before the application; Sigma-Aldrich) and 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (BMPO, Enzo Life Sciences) were used. The spin trapping experiments were performed at least in triplicate. The g-factors were determined with an uncertainty of ±0.0001 using a nuclear magnetic resonance teslameter (ER 036TM, Bruker) and an integrated frequency counter. The experimental EPR spectra were analyzed using the WinEPR software (Bruker), and the calculations of the spin-Hamiltonian parameters and relative concentrations of individual BMPO-adducts were performed with an EasySpin toolbox working on the MatLab® platform.49 The standard EPR spectrometer settings were as follows: microwave frequency, ∼9.43 GHz; microwave power, ∼10.5 mW; centre field, ∼335.8 mT; sweep width, 8 mT; gain, 1.00 × 105; modulation amplitude, 0.05 mT; sweep time, 18 s; time constant, 5.12 ms; and the number of scans, 1 or 10. To corroborate EPR analyses, radical scavenging experiments were also peformed using 10 mM isopropanol (IPA, HO˙ scavenger), 0.1 mM benzoquinone (BQ, O2˙− scavenger) and 2.0 mM ammonium oxalate (AO, h+ scavenger).
Results and discussion
Prior to the main experiments, the optimization of Ce content at the surface of TiAP was investigated. To this end, 0.00125, 0.0025, 0.0125 and 0.025 wt% of Ce/TiAP samples were prepared, and their photocatalytic efficiency in the decolorization of Rhodamine B was assessed (Fig. S1 and Table S2, ESI†). Based on these preparatory experiments, 0.0025 wt% Ce/TiAP showed the best photocatalytic activity, thus being further studied in the rest of this work.
Morphology and structure of TiAP and Ce/TiAP
The XRD patterns of TiAP and Ce/TiAP along with that of the commercially available P25 powder are shown in Fig. 1. For the P25 powder, both anatase (ICDD 03-065-5714) and rutile (ICDD 03-065-1118) TiO2 phases were identified. Indeed, the 2θ diffractions at approx. 25.29, 37.72, 48.01, 52.80, and 55.04° correspond to the (101), (004), (200), (105) and (211) TiO2 anatase phase crystal structures, respectively, whereas the TiO2 rutile phase has 2θ diffractions at 27.40, 36.02 and 41.17° which correspond to the (110), (101) and (111) diffraction planes, respectively. It is worth noting that P25 powder is composed of 82% of anatase and 18% of rutile (ESI†). Solely anatase was detected in TiAP and Ce/TiAP. Regarding the preparation method of Ce/TiAP, it can be deduced that Ce is present at the surface of TiO2, probably in the form of CeO2 nanocrystals. The average crystallite sizes for each sample were calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation based on the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the anatase TiO2(101) diffraction peak (eqn (1)).50 (1)where Dhkl is the crystallite size, hkl is the Miller indices of the plane being analyzed, K is the crystallite-shape factor, which is approximated to 0.9, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, Bhkl is the FWHM of the X-ray diffraction peak in radians, and θ is the Bragg angle. The calculated crystallite sizes of P25, TiAP and Ce/TiAP were approx. 20 nm, 32 nm and 29 nm, respectively. In general, TiAP possesses a bigger crystallite size than P25. This is the result of the different methods used for the preparation of TiO2, namely flame pyrolysis (for P25) and freeze-drying (for TiAP). The freeze-drying process removes the aqueous component from the peroxo-polytitanic acid gel while preserving the porous structure in the dried state.51 Freeze-drying helps in maintaining the stability of TiO2 anatase at high temperatures since it prevents the formation of rutile nuclei. In addition, during the annealing procedure, the structure of peroxo-polytitanic acid gel prevents the transport of the material to the growing anatase phase, thus leading to the inhibition of particle growth and assisting in the stabilization of the TiO2 anatase phase.51–53 Concerning the two TiAP samples, Ce surface modification retards the growth of TiO2 grains, thereby reducing the crystallite size of anatase TiO2.7,28 Since the ionic radii of Ce3+/Ce4+ ions (1.03/1.02 Å) are larger than that of Ti4+ ions (0.68 Å), the resulting cerium species occupy space at grain boundaries and grain junctions rather than the Ce ions replacing the titanium sites in the anatase lattice.54 Therefore, the crystallite growth of TiO2 is hindered through Ce–Ti–O bond formation.54

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) adsorption/desorption isotherms of all samples were obtained (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, ESI†), and the results are summarized in Table 1. It is confirmed that both TiAP and Ce/TiAP possess smaller surface areas and pore volumes compared to those of P25. However, the higher surface area of Ce/TiAP (17.3 m2 g−1) compared to that of TiAP (15.6 m2 g−1) can be explained by a successful surface modification of TiAP by Ce.

To correlate the BET data, the surface morphology of the TiO2 powder was investigated by STEM and TEM. STEM and low-magnification TEM images with relevant SAED patterns of Ce/TiAP, TiAP, and P25 samples are shown in Fig. 3. SAED patterns obtained from randomly oriented crystallites in TiAP and Ce/TiAP consist of diffraction rings that can be ascribed exclusively to the tetragonal TiO2 anatase phase. In P25, along with the diffraction rings assigned to the anatase phase, spots exhibiting an interplanar spacing of 0.32 nm can be observed, which is the most intense reflection of the tetragonal TiO2 rutile phase. These observations are consistent with the XRD measurements. It is worth noting that the low magnification TEM images show that the nanoparticles in all the samples are aggregated (Fig. 3). In addition, TiAP and Ce/TiAP show a 2D nanosheet morphology, which is consistent with previous work.51 The size of the nanocrystals in Ce/TiAP and TiAP ranged from 20 to 110 nm with an average size of 50 nm (as measured from TEM 2D projections), which is different from the values calculated by XRD. This discrepancy can be elucidated as follows: the crystallite size obtained by XRD is related to the smallest crystalline coherent domains forming individual nanocrystals and not to the size of the particles formed by oriented attachment of several nanocrystals with similar crystallographic orientations. Examples of the merged nanocrystals in TiAP and Ce/TiAP oriented in 〈010〉 and 〈111〉 directions are provided in Fig. 4a and c. As observed from the relevant FFT patterns (Fig. 4b and d), the {101} type surfaces are predominant, which indicates dipyramidal morphology. Indeed, the anatase nanoparticles in Ce/TiAP and TiAP contain faceted truncated bipyramidal nanocavities (Fig. 4a). To prove the presence of Ce in Ce/TiAP, SIMS analysis was performed (Fig. S3, ESI†). For consistency, SIMS was also performed on the other Ce/TiAP samples containing 0.0125 and 0.025 wt% of Ce in TiAP (Fig. S3, ESI†) and the intensity of the Ce+ peak (at a mass of 139.9 u) increases with an increase in Ce concentration.

Optical properties of TiAP and Ce/TiAP
The optical properties of P25, TiAP and Ce/TiAP were investigated by DRS and UPS. The DRS spectra showed that the peak reflectance of TiAP and Ce/TiAP is shifted towards lower wavelengths compared to P25, from 405 nm to 395 nm (Fig. 5a). This is due to the presence of the rutile phase in P25 (Eg = ∼3.0 eV), thus contributing to a slightly smaller Eg value than those of TiAP and Ce/TiAP which contain only anatase (Eg = ∼3.2 eV).55–57 The optical bandgap (Eg) is calculated from the Kubelka–Munk function (for the case of the indirect bandgap) and determined by the Tauc plot (Fig. 5b), which shows that P25 has a bandgap of ∼3.09 eV while it is ∼3.25 eV for TiAP and Ce/TiAP. Therefore, no significant shift in the optical bandgap between TiAP and Ce/TiAP is observed. This is in accordance with previous studies on TiO2 aerogel powders surface-modified by Nd, Ag, and Au.51 Nevertheless, from UPS spectra (Fig. 6), the shift of the valence band maximum (VBM) towards lower values was recorded (from 3.2 eV to 2.8 eV for TiAP and Ce/TiAP, respectively). This shift of the electronic band structure in Ce/TiAP is beneficial for the generation of ROS.

Photoelectrochemical characterization of TiAP and Ce/TiAP
The photocurrent densities and the recorded photocurrent transients from 250 nm to 500 nm are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S4). Fig. 7a shows the corresponding (from Fig. S4, ESI†) incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) recorded for P25, TiAP, and Ce/TiAP in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 500 nm. A pronounced increase in the photocurrent density and IPCE was observed for TiAP and Ce/TiAP compared to P25. At a wavelength of ∼350 nm, the IPCE values reached approx. 50%, 40%, and 30% for Ce/TiAP, TiAP, and P25, respectively. The ∼10% increase in IPCE for TiAP compared to P25 is mainly due to the 2D-nanosheet morphology of the TiAP that have superior charge carrier mobility that also contributes to the increase in IPCE.58–60 In Ce/TiAP, the IPCE value reached ∼50% at 350 nm. Indeed, Ce modification increases the incident light utilization and decreases the e−/h+ recombination.61,62Fig. 7b shows the (IPCE·hν)1/2 plots which were employed to evaluate the indirect bandgap energy of samples and are summarized in Table 2. Here, the bandgap values calculated for all the samples were ∼3.13 eV, which is similar to the evaluated optical bandgap results obtained from DRS (Fig. 5).

To provide an additional photoelectrochemical insight, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded in the potential range from −0.4 V V vs. Ag/AgCl to +1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for P25, TiAP, and Ce/TiAP. Fig. 7c and d show the CV curves recorded in the dark and under UV light irradiation (λ = 350 nm), respectively. The CV shape for all samples is typical for the anatase structure.63,64 The current density of Ce/TiAP in the dark (Fig. 7c) increased in the potential range from approx. −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl to +0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl due to Ce doping of TiAP. The dark currents of TiAP and P25 are almost identical. After UV light irradiation (λ = 350 nm), a pronounced increase in photocurrent densities was observed for all samples. The recorded CVs correlated with the obtained photocurrent densities (Fig. S4a, ESI†) and IPCEs (Fig. 7a). The photocurrent densities for all the samples increased until the potential of approx. +0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. At higher potentials, a photocurrent plateau was observed, indicating that the thickness of the particles equals the space charge layer.63–65
Photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B, phenol and caffeine
The photocatalytic degradation of environmentally relevant contaminants including Rhodamine B, phenol and caffeine was carried out using Ce/TiAP, TiAP and P25 under solar-like irradiation (Fig. 8). In each degradation experiment, the photocatalytic efficiency of the TiO2 samples was of the order: Ce/TiAP > TiAP > P25. Indeed, Ce/TiAP samples led to 94% RB degradation in 10 min and 67% CAF degradation in 20 min under UVA light. Moreover, the mineralization was monitored for 2 h where 50% and 84% mineralization extents were observed for CAF and phenol, respectively (Fig. 8). The observed photocatalytic degradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics based on the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model (eqn (2)),66 (2)where k is the pseudo first-order rate constant, t is the time, C is the concentration of the pollutant, and C0 is the initial concentration of the pollutant. The linearized pseudo-first-order plots of ln(C/C0) versus time gives the apparent rate constant (k). The corresponding pseudo first-order rate constants (Fig. S5 ESI† and Table 2) also follow the previous trend, i.e. Ce/TiAP > TiAP > P25. Compared to other works using Ce surface-modified photocatalysts,67,68 the present photocatalytic efficiency using Ce/TiAP was found to be significantly higher than, for instance, CeO2 decorated bismuth molybdate (CeO2/Bi2MoO6) in the degradation of RB under UV light.67 Indeed, Ce/TiAP degraded 94% of RB in 10 min (Fig. 8a) whereas CeO2/Bi2MoO6 took 90 min to achieve a similar degradation extent. In addition, repeated runs of photocatalytic degradation of RB, phenol and CAF using Ce/TiAP have been performed (Fig. S6, ESI†). The reproducibility after 4 cycles is satisfactory with an almost stable degradation efficiency of RB and a decrease of mineralization efficiency (for phenol and CAF) of less than 2% per cycle.

The photocatalytic efficiency of the samples correlated with their morphological, structural, optical and photoelectrochemical properties. Indeed, the photoelectrochemical properties suggest the enhanced e−/h+ separation in Ce/TiAP. The photocurrent density produced by Ce/TiAP (Fig. S4, ESI†) clearly exhibits enhanced charge transport while efficient photon to electron conversion (Fig. 7a) is also observed for Ce/TiAP. The e−/h+ pair separation is a key factor for the enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency since a longer life-time of photogenerated species increases the probability to generate the primary ROS according to the chemical reactions in eqn (3) and (4). The formation of these radical species is the base of the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. In addition, the nanostructured Ce/TiAP particles (Fig. 3 and 4) along with their high active surface area (Table 1) are also crucial parameters for determining the photocatalytic efficiency. This leads to an increase of active sites where reactions take place since photocatalysis is a surface dependent process (Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism). OH− + h+ → HO˙(3) O2 + e− → O2˙−(4)
Furthermore, the main ROS generated by TiO2-based photocatalytic systems are hydroxyl radicals.69,70 Their generation under UVA light was first followed by fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 9). This confirms the higher production rate of hydroxy-terephthalic acid in the presence of Ce/TiAP with a 5-fold increase compared to TiAP, with a concentration of 700 nM after 10 min. To further confirm the presence of HO˙ radicals, EPR measurement was performed. The UVA exposure of TiAP and Ce/TiAP dispersed in water in the presence of DMPO spin trap results in the immediate generation of a typical four-line EPR signal (Fig. 10a and Fig. S7, ESI†), characterized by spin-Hamiltonian parameters fully compatible with ˙DMPO–OH spin-adduct (aN = 1.509 mT, aβH = 1.480 mT, a13C (2 × 13C) = 0.768 mT, a13C = 0.585 mT, a13C = 0.465 mT; g = 2.0057).71–73 The ˙DMPO–OH adduct may be generated in photoactivated aqueous TiO2 suspensions via several alternative mechanisms, representing (i) genuine trapping of HO˙ radicals by DMPO, (ii) rapid transformation of ˙DMPO–O2H and (iii) inverted spin-trapping.72,73 Consequently, analogous EPR spin trapping experiments were performed with BMPO, which represents a spin trapping agent suitable for the simultaneous detection of HO˙ and O2˙−/HO2˙ radicals.74–76Fig. 10b shows the normalized experimental and simulated EPR spectra obtained upon 180 s LED@365 nm exposure of an aerated aqueous suspension of Ce/TiAP in the presence of BMPO. The experimental EPR spectrum was interpreted by the simulation analysis and the best fit evaluated corresponds to the superposition of two individual BMPO-adducts characterized by the following spin-Hamiltonian parameters and relative concentration: (i) ˙BMPO–OH(1) (conformer 1) aN = 1.435 mT, aβH = 1.527 mT, aγH = 0.066 mT; g = 2.0057; 29%, and (ii) ˙BMPO–OH(2) (conformer 2) aN = 1.415 mT, aβH = 1.263 mT, aγH = 0.064 mT; g = 2.0057; 71%. It should be noted here that the EPR signals characteristic of the ˙BMPO–O2H(1) and ˙BMPO–O2H(2) conformers74–76 were not detected upon LED@365 nm irradiation of aerated TiAP and Ce/TiAP suspensions. In addition, Ce/TiAP exhibited a shift in the band structure compared to TiAP (Fig. 6), thus improving the generation of HO˙. Indeed, O2˙−/HO2˙ might also be generated in Ce/TiAP systems and form in situ H2O2 which is subsequently transformed into HO˙.72 The radical scavenging experiments in the presence of different radical scavengers further proved that HO˙ is the main primary ROS (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). Indeed, in the presence of IPA, the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants is strongly inhibited. In the presence of AO and BQ, a less significant inhibition is observed, thus confirming that hydroxyl radicals can be either produced by oxidation of hydroxyl anions (eqn (3)) or by in situ decomposition of H2O2 (eqn (4)–(6)). O2˙− + 2H+ + e− → H2O2(5) H2O2 + e− (or hν) → HO˙ + OH− (or HO˙)(6)

Conclusions
The surface modification of TiO2 aerogel powders by cerium ions was successfully performed for the first time. The effect of Ce surface-modification at the TiO2 surface has led to an increase in the active surface area compared to the TiAP sample. The photoelectrochemical measurements showed the significantly better photocurrent density and IPCE of Ce/TiAP, thus indirectly highlighting better e−/h+ pair separation. In addition, although the energy bandgaps of TiAP and Ce/TiAP are similar, the valence band of the surface-modified sample shifts from 3.2 to 2.8 eV, thus improving the generation of ROS, especially hydroxyl radicals. All these detailed studies have provided insights into the improvement of the photoinduced properties of Ce/TiAP, which have been correlated with the photodegradation of different pollutants under UVA light. Indeed, Ce/TiAP has led to significantly better degradation and mineralization extents. Thus, these photocatalytic tests using different types of pollutants highlight the universality and the relevance of Ce surface-modified TiO2 aerogel powders and their promising use for environmental applications.
