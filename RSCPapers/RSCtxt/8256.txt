    , Accepted 8th December 2014First published on 11th December 2014AbstractA SnO2 nanocrystallite-based photoanode was prepared using tin (IV) chloride and fructose via a one-pot hydrothermal method, and its structural and morphological properties were studied. Structural observations revealed tetragonal crystals of SnO2, and morphological studies confirmed the presence of spherical nanoparticulates. Furthermore, encapsulating the surface of the SnO2 photoanode (+N719 dye) with thin layers of La2O3 significantly improved the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, fill factor and power conversion efficiency values from 8.30 to 13.70 mA cm−2, 0.40 to 0.46 V, 49% to 48% and 1.66% to 3.0%, respectively. The nearly two-fold improvement in energy conversion efficiency was attributed to: (a) increased dye molecules caused by the formation of strong co-ordination bonds between the dye molecules and the lanthanide, (b) enhanced photoelectron transfer rate between the dye molecules and SnO2 conduction band, and (c) negative shift of SnO2 conduction band position in the presence of La2O3 (confirmed from the Mott–Schottky and Tafel measurements).
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have garnered considerable attention within the solar cell community due to their low-cost, chemical stability, ease of fabrication, and efficient solar-to-electricity conversion.1,2 Currently, semiconductors with mid band gap energies (2.8–3.8 eV) are promising photoanode materials for DSSCs applications.3 The nanoporous nature of photoanode materials provides a large surface area for efficient dye adsorption, which delivers greater light harvesting and energy conversion efficiencies.4 However, electron recombination occurs in the electron transport processes of electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band, and electron transport from the conduction band to the conducting and transparent fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO) substrate of photoanode. In addition, the reverse flow of electrons towards the oxidized dye/reduced electrolyte is considered to be one of the major hurdles for the achievement of high solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency.5
In DSSCs, photoanodes with wide band gap metal oxides play two important roles: accumulation of dye molecules and transportation of injected photoelectrons. Among these wide band gap metal oxides, TiO2 has been found to exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency owing to its specific optoelectronic properties.6,7 However, low electron mobility in TiO2 is a possible reason for its high electron recombination rate, which eventually prevents the further improvement of power conversion efficiency.8 In addition to TiO2, several studies have reported the merits and demerits of other metal oxides, including ZnO, SnO2, WO3, and Nb2O5, in DSSCs.9–12 Among these semiconducting metal oxides, SnO2 is an n-type semiconductor with many advantageous features compared to TiO2, such as: (a) electron mobility in SnO2 (∼100–250 cm2 V−1 s−1) is two orders of magnitude greater than TiO2 (∼0.1–1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1),13 suggesting a faster diffusion transport of the photo-induced electrons, (b) SnO2 has a higher band gap (3.4 eV) than anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV), which creates fewer oxidative holes in the valence band (fewer oxidative holes facilitate long-term stability lower dye-degradation rate and higher stability under long-term UV irradiation), and (c) SnO2 can easily form anisotropic structures, such as nanorods, nanowires and nanoflowers, which exhibit unique electronic and optical properties.14 However, a DSSCs device with SnO2 photoanode suffers from poor power conversion efficiency (less than 1.5%) because of faster electron-hole recombination rate, significantly decreased dye adsorption and smaller Voc value due to the 300 mV positive shift in conduction band edge of SnO2 (with reference to the TiO2 band position), leading to lower open-circuit voltage and smaller short-circuit photocurrent.15 During the past several decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of SnO2 photoanodes with varied morphological architectures ranging from zero,16 one,17 and two18 to complex three-dimensional structures.19 To date, various physical and chemical methods have been used to synthesize SnO2 photoanodes including core–shell building blocks through sol–gel,20 template-assisted fabrication,21 hydrothermal,22 and solvothermal growth etc.23
For efficient DSSCs device operation, the interaction of charges at interface between metal oxide and electrolyte/hole transporter, as well as with dye, is a crucial aspect.24 Careful engineering of the interface is needed to minimize electron loss as well as to provide correctly matching energy levels. Deposition of a blocking layer that can inhibit electron recombination and enable a higher degree of dye loading can reduce interface problems for metal oxides. This action also shifts the Fermi energy level of host photoanode such that the charge transportation can be easier and faster.25 Metal oxides, such as MgO, ZrO2, Al2O3 and SiO2, have been envisaged for this purpose.26–29 Moreover, the high isoelectric point of La2O3 can enhance dye adsorption on/in to the surface of SnO2 photoanode. Herein, we present a facile spin-coating La2O3 blocking layer approach to overcome the interfacial problem of SnO2 photoanode. The application of La2O3 as an electron blocking layer improved the charge collection efficiency by reducing the number of charge carriers lost via recombination.30 Lanthanide ions (La3+) are known for their ability to form complexes resulting from co-ordination bonding between the f-orbitals of lanthanides and lone electron pairs of various Lewis bases (e.g., acids, amines, aldehydes, alcohols, and thiols).31,32 Here, La3+ ions were successfully incorporated in/on to a SnO2 structure for improving the adsorption of dye molecules, shifting the conduction band position and reducing surface defects. Therefore, the surface modification of SnO2 photoanode would be an ideal strategy for improving the performance of DSSCs.
In this article, we propose a simple modification method which can superimpose a compact La2O3 blocking layer as an efficient photoelectron transport layer fabricated on/in to SnO2. We expect that this new structural configuration will collectively tackle the electron leakage and low electron transport efficiency issues. The improved charge transfer rate and higher power conversion efficiency are anticipated because of the widened electron pathways and the reduction of scattering of free electrons among inter-particles. The SnO2-La2O3 photoanode exhibited a higher open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), a superior short-circuit current density (Jsc), a prolonged electron lifetime (τη) and an increased dye loading amount in comparison with only SnO2 photoanode. The overall power efficiency (η%) of La2O3-SnO2 photoanode was about twice that of a SnO2 photoanode.
2. Experimental details
All the chemicals used as reactants were of analytical grade, and used without any further purification. The SnO2 photoanodes were prepared using a simple hydrothermal method, first using fructose as the oxidizing agent and SnCl4 as the source for Sn4+ ions via chemically induced self-assembly. In a standard experimental procedure, 2.80 g of SnCl4·5H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%) and 1.44 g of fructose (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) were mixed in 80 mL distilled water (Milli-Q water; 18.2 MΩ cm). The mixture was constantly stirred for 30 min and then transferred into a 100 mL-Teflon lined stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 190 °C for 24 h. On completion of the reaction, the autoclave was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature (27 °C). The resulting black product (Sn(OH)2, possibly due to excess of Sn4+ ions) was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed several times with distilled water and ethanol to remove the unexfoliated compound. The product was heated in air at 600 °C for 2 h to form SnO2 as a white powder containing spherical nanocrystallites. To obtain viscous slurry, 1.0 g of SnO2 powder was mixed with 8.0 mL ethanol, 0.2 mL acetic acid, 4.5 g α-terpineol, and 0.5 g ethyl cellulose, and then stirred for 6 h to form uniform and homogenous slurry. After the sonication of SnO2 slurry for 90 min in an ultrasonic bath, SnO2 photoanodes were obtained using the doctor-blade method onto an FTO substrate (15 Ω, TEC 8, Pilkington glass). Finally, the SnO2 photoanodes were heat treated at 450 °C for 1 h to evaporate solvents and to obtain compact SnO2 photoanodes.
Furthermore, the deposition of La2O3 blocking layers was carried out on SnO2 photoanodes using a spin-coating method. 0.05 M lanthanum nitrate was dissolved in an isopropanol solution and allowed to fix on SnO2 photonaodes under 2000 rpm for 60 s. We also attempted higher and lower spin rates, but the performance decreased in both cases. The lower spin rate performance was poor due to the formation of a thick La2O3 insulating layer that might not allow excited electrons to pass to SnO2. Therefore, all the photoelectrons could follow a reverse path with the possibility of major recombination. However, increasing the spin rate produced extremely thin La2O3 layers, through which quantum confinement could limit the passage of photoelectrons; therefore, a few photoelectrons might traverse in the reverse direction, reducing the performance. In this case, the DSSCs performance of 2000 rpm was superior to that of a SnO2 photoanode, indicating the importance of thin layer on the photoanode. The spin-coated SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes were heat-treated at 450 °C for 30 min. After the La2O3 layers were added, there was no obvious difference in the average thickness, i.e., ∼20 microns of SnO2 (see Fig. S1 of the ESI†). After annealing both the SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 electrodes were immersed in 0.03 mM N719 dye solution (ethanol + acetonitrile) for 24 h to adsorb the dye molecules. The surface digital photoimages of SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes were obtained via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Nova Nano SEM200-FEI). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) measurements were performed using an FEI TECNAI G2 S-TWIN instrument equipped with a LaB6 cathode and a GATAN MS794 P CCD camera. The micrographs were obtained at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes were separated from the substrate with a scalpel blade. The collected powders were separately suspended in ethanol and dropped onto Formvar/carbon, 200 mesh TH copper grids before HR-TEM measurements. The structural changes, if any, of the SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes were confirmed from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (XRD-6000, Shimadzu, Japan) obtained with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). Diffraction patterns were recorded from 20° to 80° with a 2° min−1 scan-speed. For X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a surface-sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique, spectra of the photoanodes were acquired with a PHI 5000 VersaProbe instrument (Ulvac-PHI) under high vacuum conditions (6.8 × 10−8 Pa) using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The data were collected from a spot size of 100 × 100 μm2. The carbon 1s peak (284.6 eV) was used for internal calibration as a reference. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer instrument. The amounts of dye molecules adsorbed onto the SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes were determined by dipping them in 0.1 M NaOH solution (ethanol and water in 50:50 ratio by volume) for 24 h at room temperature to desorb the attached dye molecules. The volumes of the solutions were kept constant at 5 mL for dye desorption. The photoanodes, free from the back mask, and each with an area of 0.25 cm2, were illuminated from the FTO side with simulated sunlight from a 150 W xenon lamp (Sun 2000 solar simulator, ABET Technologies, USA) equipped with an air-mass filter A.M. 1.5 G with a corrected intensity of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) at the photoanode surface. The current density–applied voltage (J–V) spectra of the SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky analysis measurements were recorded on an instrument from potentiostat (IviumStat Technologies, Netherland) with the frequency range varying from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz; the Mott–Schottky analysis measurements were obtained in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte with a three-electrode configuration. The three electrode system used platinum plate as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and SnO2/SnO2-La2O3 as the working electrode, i.e. photoanode. The photoluminescent (PL) spectroscopy was performed using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer unit. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of both photoanodes were measured using a xenon lamp; the IPCEs were recorded without bias under illumination with respect to a calibrated Melles-Friot silicon diode, and by changing the excitation wavelength (McScience K3100 Spectral IPCE measurement system and Polaronix® K102 Signal Amplifier).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Surface morphology and structure
The FE-SEM images of SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes are shown in Fig. 1 (a, b); there was no obvious difference in surface appearance. Both surfaces were unpolished and compact. Few voids were seen on the SnO2-La2O3 photoanode surface. The SnO2 photoanode was composed of agglomerated-type islands, with several 40–50 nm spherical crystallites. After La2O3 formation, the SnO2 nanocrystallites were in close proximity to each other and there was no gap as such between them. Both photoanodes were scanned for HR-TEM measurements, with the assumption that there would be a separate La2O3 layer in/on to the SnO2 crystallites. The low magnification HR-TEM images (Fig. 1 c, d) show individual nanoparticles. From these images, it was difficult to trace out the changes in lattice structure, and nothing was clearly observed. Continuous sharp circles in the SAED (selected area electron diffraction) patterns (insets of Fig. 1 c, d) confirmed polycrystalline nature of nanoparticles. Lattice images were clearly observed, indicating that these nanoparticles possessed high crystallinity. A lattice spacing of 0.33 nm, consistent with the reported results for the (110) plane of SnO2, was estimated.33 The EDX analysis (Fig. S2†) revealed that both the SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes were composed of Sn, O, and La. The absence of peaks corresponding to impurities confirmed the formation of pure and defect-free SnO2. Fig. S2 (b)† presents La and O peaks, which were certainly from the La2O3 blocking layer in/on to the SnO2 photoanode, quantitatively confirming the presence of La2O3 in/on to SnO2, which we failed to confirm from the TEM and XRD measurements (see later). The XRD pattern (Fig. 1e) of the SnO2 photoanode demonstrated that most of the Bragg reflection peaks were from tetragonal phase, with lattice constants a = 4.7382 Å and c = 3.1871 Å (JCPDS no. 41-1445).

For the SnO2-La2O3 photoanode, due to the extremely thin layer of La2O3, there was no conspicuous lattice distortion of XRD pattern, indicating that the thin La2O3 layer might either have covered empty spaces or formed a thin layer on the SnO2 spherical nanoparticles.
3.2 Optical, J–V and surface area studies

Fig. 2a shows UV-vis absorption spectra for the dye-absorbed SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes; in the latter case, due to increased number of dye molecules, a substantially high absorbance was obtained compared to SnO2. The amounts of dye covering SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes, estimated from UV-Vis spectra, were 0.68 × 10−7 and 1.23 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. The higher number of dye molecules on SnO2-La2O3 photoanode compared with the SnO2 photoanode was due to higher basicity of La2O3. If the blocking layer materials are more basic than SnO2, the carboxyl groups in N719 dye molecules are more easily adsorbed on surface of coating layers.34 The isoelectric point35 of ∼10.0 of La2O3 is considerably greater than that of SnO2 (∼5.5).36 This means that the surface of SnO2-La2O3 photoanode was more basic than that of SnO2, leading to a significant improvement in dye absorption. Fig. S3† illustrates the J–V behaviors of SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes under dark; for all the electrodes, the dark current density was lower than that of La2O3 embedded SnO2 electrodes (for simplicity, we also measured the J–V performances of SnO2 electrodes under dark and light with various layers of La2O3, i.e. 2, 4, 6 and 8 rounds of spin-coating, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4†). The forward-biased dark current density in the SnO2 photoanode, a result of an electrochemical reaction that involves the redox couple, was higher than in the SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes, indicating the highest leakage current in the SnO2 photoanode, on account of its higher charge-transfer resistance across the electrode/electrolyte interface compared to SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes. The dark current density was initially higher for SnO2 photoanode surface, and slowly reduced when La2O3 blocking layer was in/on to the SnO2 photoanode. Excess charge leakage from SnO2 photoanode might favour a higher dark current density, which decreases for SnO2-La2O3 photoanode due to increase in the thickness of La2+/dye complex layer blocking charge carrier transport ions. Fig. 2b shows the J–V measurements of SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes (with 1 spin coating, as the performance for 2 spin coatings was less; see Fig. 2 (b) and Table S1† for more details). The detailed DSSCs parameters are listed in Table 1. Among all SnO2-La2O3 electrodes, the DSSCs performance of the SnO2-La2O3 photoanode with 1 spin-coating layer was superior to that of the SnO2 photoanode and the SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes with 2, 4, 6 and 8 layers, signifying the importance of encapsulation in DSSCs. It is noteworthy that the performance of all La2O3 encapsulated SnO2 photoanodes was higher than that of SnO2.

SnO2 electrode showed poor DSSCs performance, with a Voc value of 0.40 V, Jsc of 8.30 mA cm−2, FF of 0.49, and power conversion efficiency of 1.61%. The lower Voc of 0.40 V was due to the more positive conduction band edge of SnO2.37 The SnO2-La2O3 photoanode revealed a two-fold improvement in DSSCs parameters compared to SnO2 photoanode. The Voc value was increased to 0.46 V from 0.40 V, Jsc was increased to 13.70 from 8.30 mA cm−2, and efficiency was increased to 3.0% from 1.61%. There was no obvious difference in fill factor values. The improvement in Voc was due to an increase in the conduction band level towards more negative side after the surface modification of SnO2 by La2O3 layer. Enhancement in Jsc was attributed to (a) excess dye amount (see Fig. 2a), (b) greater active surface area, (c) higher iso-electric points and slower electron recombination rate due to the La2O3 layer.38 Furthermore, the electron recombination rate in DSSCs can be characterized by open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements. These measurements were conducted when a steady state Voc of the DSSCs was obtained under solar light illumination, and the decay of Voc was monitored when the illumination was stopped. It is well-established that Voc is highly dependent on the quasi-Fermi level, i.e., the electron density at conduction band of photoanode.39
Therefore, the decay of Voc can be used to reflect the regression of electron density in the conduction band of the photoanode. OCVD measurement has been widely used as a kinetic parameter, which contains useful information on the rate constant of electron transfer process in DSSCs. The electron lifetime (τη) was calculated by fitting photovoltage decay plot obtained from the OCVD measurements and applying an equation developed by Bisquert et al.40 The longer electron lifetime for the SnO2-La2O3 photoanode implied a lower charge recombination rate and improved electron transfer efficiency.41 Moreover, the La2O3 blocking layer on the SnO2 photoanode might improve interparticle connection, which could plausibly provide the shortest pathway for efficient transfer of electrons into the conduction band, and then into the external circuit. The shortest pathway for electron transfer either helps to reduce electron recombination, or considerably boosts the transfer velocity of electrons.42 Therefore, the electron lifetime of SnO2-La2O3 photoanode was significantly extended (Fig. 2 c, d) compared with SnO2 photoanode. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore diameter (not shown) of the SnO2 photoanode were 12.19 m2 g−1 and 31.11 nm, respectively, while for the SnO2-La2O3 photoanode, the respective parameters were 12.84 m2 g−1 and 27.67 nm. The high surface area and smaller pore diameter of the SnO2-La2O3 photoanode could responsible for the increased adsorption of dye molecules43 compared to the SnO2 photoanode.
3.3 Surface analysis
XPS measurements were used to examine the chemical states and surface composition of SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes to corroborate the results of EDX analysis (Fig. 3a–c). The XPS spectrum of SnO2 (Fig. 3a) shows Sn, O, and C peaks. Fig. 3b shows the XPS survey spectrum after La2O3 layering; Sn, La, O, and C peaks were detected, and there was no trace of any other peak.
 Fig. 3  XPS plots for (a) SnO2, (b) SnO2-La2O3, and (c) La3d of SnO2-La2O3. 
A new peak of La was detected by XPS, indicating the presence of La2O3 layer on SnO2 photoanode. The carbon peak at 284.8 eV was assigned to residual carbon in the sample, and hydrocarbons from the XPS instrument itself. As shown in Fig. 3c, binding energy peaks for the SnO2-La2O3 photoanode were obtained at 834.8 eV, 840.4 eV, 851.8 eV, and 856.4 eV, which correspond to the 3d states of the La element, qualitatively supporting the existence of La2O3 in/on SnO2.44
3.4 Charge transport kinetics
To further understand the interfacial charge transfer kinetics, we performed EIS measurements for SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes. The EIS spectra for these two photoanodes were measured from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. Two semicircles were clearly visible for both the devices. The semicircle on the left hand side (high frequency region) was due to charge transfer resistance (R1) between the counter electrode and electrolyte, and the semicircle on the right hand side (low frequency region) was assigned to charge transfer resistance (R2) in the photoanode.45,46 The size of the second semicircle (the value of R2) is an important factor, which affects the photovoltaic parameters. The SnO2-La2O3 electrode exhibited a R2 value of 33.11 Ω, which was considerably smaller than that of SnO2 (38.85 Ω), indicating faster electron generation and transportation, as well as a lower hole-electron recombination rate in the former case compared to latter. The La2O3 layer tightly holds the spherical SnO2 nanocrystallites, permitting electron transportation over a longer distance with less diffusive hindrance.47,48 The electrochemical parameters obtained from Nyquist plots for both the electrodes are summarized in Table 2.

Fig. 4b compares the IPCE spectra of SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes. The SnO2 photoanode presented relatively lower IPCE, with a maximum value of ∼53%; this could be due to the fewer dye molecules adsorbed and the higher recombination rate. In addition, the SnO2-La2O3 photoanode demonstrated IPCE as high as ∼60% at 530 nm. The increase in IPCE was due to (a) excess of dye molecules, (b) reduced electron recombination, and (c) enhanced light scattering ability.49

The room temperature PL spectra of the SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes are shown in Fig. 4c. Here, the spectra were normalized by the UV emission peak at 350 nm. It was noted that the peak intensity of the visible emission of SnO2-La2O3 was much weaker than that of SnO2. We presumed that the formation of a La2O3 layer on SnO2 might reduce surface defects and minimize interface recombinations.50Fig. 4d shows Mott–Schottky plots for SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes measured in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte to determine the respective flat band potentials (Efb). The Efb of a photoanode is a very important parameter because Voc is closely related to the difference between redox potential in an electrolyte and Fermi level of a semiconductor. In this plot, a negative shift of Efb means a shift away from the redox potential, and therefore an increase of Voc. The calculated Efb values of the SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes were 0.37 and 0.32 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. Bandara et al. reported MgO surface modified SnO2 photoanodes with a negative shift of Efb due to their basic surface properties.51 The basic character of MgO (isoelectric point ∼12) produces a deprotonation and interfacial dipole on the SnO2 surface, which causes a negative shift of Efb. In our case, La2O3 showed basic characteristics (isoelectric point ∼10.5). The basic property of La2O3 might cause a negative shift in the Efb value in the present case, counteracting the effect of the lower-lying conduction band position of SnO2.52
The Tafel curves recorded for the cathodic polarization of SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes in dark are shown in Fig. 5. The difference in the behaviour of curves can be ascribed to different charge-transfer processes at photoanode interface.53 With a negative bias applied to a semiconductor electrode, the charge will first fill the empty surface states below the conduction band edge, and then accumulate in the space charge layer. A marked increase in the cathodic current will occur when the potential exceeds the flat band edge in the negative scan direction.54 The difference in cathodic polarization behaviours indicated that the flat-band edge of SnO2-La2O3 shifted negatively compared to SnO2 photoanode; this result was consistent to previously mentioned Mott–Schottky measurements (Fig. 4 d).

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes using a two-step process, viz., hydrothermal and spin-coating. The effects of La2O3 layering on the structure, morphology, surface state and binding energies of SnO2 were investigated. The presence of La2O3 on SnO2 was quantitatively studied via energy dispersive X-ray analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Dye adsorption in/on to the SnO2 electrode was increased in the presence of La2O3. Both the SnO2 and SnO2-La2O3 photoanodes were loaded with N719 dye for 24 h, and changes in their DSSCs properties (J–V, OCVD, IPCE and EIS) were monitored. Due to the increased optical density caused by excess of dye molecules and reduced charge transfer resistance, a remarkable two-fold improvement in power conversion efficiency (3.0%) was obtained for the SnO2-La2O3 electrode compared with only SnO2 photoanode (1.6%). The PL spectra showed a decreased peak intensity for SnO2-La2O3, suggesting a reduced number of surface states. Moreover, the Mott–Schottky analysis of the SnO2-La2O3 photoanode showed a negative shift in flat band potential, suggesting an enhanced electron density and charge transportation rate of photoelectrons.
