    , Accepted 8th May 2013First published on 10th May 2013AbstractOver the last decades, iodine-free redox couples have been widely investigated as alternatives for the ubiquitous triiodide/iodide redox shuttle in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). This is mainly motivated by desires to overcome the disadvantages associated with the latter, such as large energy loss in the dye regeneration process, visible light absorption and corrosiveness towards current-collecting metal grids. However, conventional Pt cathodes show poor catalytic activity towards those iodine-free redox couples, resulting in poor fill factors and relatively moderate power conversion efficiencies. The ultimate solution to address this challenge is to develop alternative economical Pt-free catalysts. This review selectively discusses and summarizes the recent advances in novel cathode materials for electrolytes free of iodine-based redox couples, mainly including inorganic transition metal compounds, organic conductive polymers and carbonaceous materials (particularly carbon nanotubes and graphene). Most of these advances have been realized by judiciously controlling the morphology of nanomaterials or by utilizing the collective properties of nano-assembly systems. Finally, this review highlights the importance of matchup between catalysts and the redox couples, and points to crucial issues that should be addressed in the pursuit of developing low-cost and high-catalytic cathodes for DSCs.

Broader context
Interest in solar energy conversion and development of associated materials has been consecutively growing due to concerns over carbon dioxide emissions and increasing pressure on supply of fossil fuels nowadays. Mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have emerged as a credible alternative to solid-state p–n junction photovoltaic devices in virtue of their great potential to enable more affordable solar-generated electricity using resource-abundant raw materials and energy-saving device processing techniques. Over the last decades, iodine-free redox couples have been widely investigated as alternatives for the ubiquitous triiodide/iodide redox shuttles in DSCs, yielding a new power conversion efficiency record of 12.3% by using a porphyrin sensitizer coupled with a co-sensitizer and Co(II/III)(2,2′-bipyridine)3 complex redox shuttle. However, conventional platinum cathodes show poor catalytic activity towards those iodine-free redox couples, thus resulting in poor fill factors and relatively moderate power conversion efficiencies. The ultimate solution to address this challenge is to develop alternative economical platinum-free catalysts. Many investigations of various alternative platinum-free catalysts have been pursued. This review selectively summarizes the recent advances in novel cathode materials for electrolytes free of iodine-based redox couples, and discusses crucial issues that should be addressed in the pursuit of developing low-cost and high-catalytic cathodes for DSCs.

1 Introduction
Interests in solar energy conversion have been growing due to concerns over carbon dioxide emissions and increasing pressure on supply of fossil fuels.1–4 Meanwhile, introduction of the solar powered devices made from nanomaterials has the potential to impact global economic developments.5–7 Mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have recently emerged as a credible alternative to solid-state p–n junction photovoltaic devices in virtue of their great potential to enable more affordable solar-generated electricity using resource-abundant raw materials and energy-saving device processing techniques.8–10 A diagram illustrating the key kinetic processes occurring in a working DSC is given in Fig. 1. Mimicking the natural photosynthesis process, light is first absorbed by an organic chromophore adsorbed to the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles (k1). The excited dye molecule rapidly injects an electron into the TiO2 conduction band (k2) which is ultimately the source of photocurrent. A redox shuttle in the organic solution is employed to regenerate the dye (k3), while diffusion of the oxidized form of the redox shuttle (Do) to be reduced at the cathode completes the circuit. Concurrently, these processes compete with several back reactions which inhibit the efficient operation of a DSC including the decay (either radiative or nonradiative) of the chromophore's excited state (k−1) prior to injection as well as back-electron transfer from the TiO2 nanoparticle to the oxidized dye (k4) or the oxidized form of the redox shuttle (k5).

The relevant processes of the redox shuttle described in the text: dye regeneration (k3), diffusion (Do), and charge recombination with the injected electron in TiO2 electrode (k5). Inset shows the energy levels of various redox couple electrolytes. 
Currently, certified record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 11% has been achieved in conjunction with polypyridylruthenium complex sensitizers and an organic electrolyte containing the ubiquitous I−/I3− redox couple.11 Although recent studies on cobalt polypyridine complexes redox shuttles have raised the PCE to 12.3% accompanied with an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) up to 1 V,12,13 the I−/I3− redox shuttle is still under intense investigations in the community.14–17 Nevertheless, there are several substantial drawbacks of this I−/I3− redox shuttle hindering its practical application and further efficiency enhancement,14 which mainly include (a) corrosiveness towards most metal substrates or metallic current-collectors in commercial modules, (b) large mismatch between its oxidation potential (0.35 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and the dye oxidation potential (∼1.0 V vs. NHE), and therefore limitations on the achievable Voc and (c) restrictions on the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) arising from competitive absorption of visible light by triiodide species, which will be more significant in back-illuminated devices or devices with ionic liquid electrolytes containing a much higher iodide/iodine concentration.18
Clearly, to overcome these disadvantages, developing non-corrosive redox mediators,19–28 with reduced mismatch between the oxidation potential of the dye and the redox couple is of vital importance not only to address the current PCE bottleneck, but also to promote the commercialization of such promising photovoltaic devices.29–33 Wang et al. reported a promising organic disulfide/thiolate redox couple, 5,5′-dithiobis(1-methyltetrazole)/1-methyltetrazole-5-thiolate (T2/T−). A PCE up to 6.4% was achieved in conjunction with a Z907Na sensitizer under standard test conditions (STC) (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).28 Following this pioneering work, this organic T2/T− redox couple has attracted special interest due to its negligible corrosion properties in combination with weak visible light absorption and reasonable PCE.34–38 Meanwhile, by employing a bulky organic chromophore in conjunction with a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple, Udo and Spiccia et al. have demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating a 7.5% efficiency DSC measured under standard testing conditions.27 More importantly, studies on the replacement of I−/I3− redox system by cobalt polypyridine complexes have drawn massive attention due to their lower visible light absorption, higher redox potential and the reduced corrosiveness towards metallic conductors.23,39–41 However, the initial overall PCE obtained with these cobalt electrolytes was inferior compared with the I−/I3− couple, especially under higher incident light intensities. This has been attributed to the slower mass transport42,43 and faster charge recombination of the injected electrons with the oxidized redox species.44,45 The real boost in efficiency was achieved with the use of Co2+/3+ redox shuttles attaining a large open-circuit photovoltage in the order of 0.9 V by the groups of Sun and Hagfeldt in 2010.25 In order to further increase the PCE, many efforts since then have been focused on the molecular structure of organic dyes,46–51 TiO2 films' morphology, thickness and porosity,52,53 cobalt mediators' redox potential,54,55 and cathode composition,56–58 reaching efficiencies of more than 10%.12,13 For instance, recent evidence suggests that the introduction of long-chain alkyloxy groups in the dye structure or incorporation of a blocking layer on the TiO2 surface could efficiently retard the unwanted charge recombination process.25,45,59 Donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) sensitizers, endowed with such specific blocking groups, have recently shown to achieve Voc values exceeding 0.8 V in conjunction with Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl) redox electrolytes.22,25,46–48 Furthermore, meticulous device and sensitizer engineering have recently made it possible to reach a new PCE record up to 12.3% by Grätzel et al.13 The specific molecular design of [5,15-bis(2,6-dioctoxyphenyl)-10-(bis(4-hexylphenyl)amino)-20-(4-carboxyphenyl ethynyl)porphyrinato]zinc(II) (YD2-o-C8) greatly retards the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film to the oxidized cobalt mediator, which enables attainment of strikingly high Voc approaching 1 V. These reports explore new opportunities towards further optimization of the DSCs performance, especially by modifying the optoelectronic properties of the organic dyes to reduce the effective optical gap, fine tuning the novel redox shuttle structures to control their redox potential, using alternative solvents to better dissolve the redox couple and facilitate diffusivity, and importantly developing alternative cathode materials for those novel iodine-free redox shuttles (Fig. 2), which is the focus of this review.

As a popular choice in high-efficiency DSCs, Pt has been recognized as a benchmark material in the field of cathodic catalyst owing to its excellent conductivity and high catalytic activity.60–63 Nevertheless, Pt has obvious drawbacks, particularly, the high cost and limited availability,64 which restricts its application to the mass production of DSCs. In addition, recent studies have shown that Pt might be dissolved in electrolytes containing the iodide/iodine redox couple, forming PtI4 compound and consequently leading to a 40% increment in the activation energy and a drop in the current density for the triiodide reduction.65–68 It has been widely identified that the contribution of a cathode to the total series resistance occurs in two ways: (a) by a charge transfer resistance at the cathode surface, Rct, and (b) by an ohmic layer resistance, Rs. Conventional Pt cathodes show poor catalytic activity toward the aforementioned promising iodine-free redox couples and a high Rct, which results in a poor fill factor (FF) and relatively moderate PCE.39,48 It has been pointed out that a low FF with sulfur-functionalized redox mediators most likely resulted from the adsorption of the sulfur atoms on the cathode surface and thus slowed the catalytic reduction of the oxidized species at the Pt cathode.28,36,37 Therefore, it is imperative to seek suitable Pt-free catalysts for these promising redox shuttles. During the last decade, with the introduction of a series of low-cost, high efficiency cathode catalysts, such as CoS,69 TiN,70 carbon materials,71 and some organic polymers (poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene, PEDOT),72,73 and polyaniline74), the research interests on alternative Pt-free catalysts has increased drastically. It is believed that the breakthrough in cathode catalysts could promote progress towards reducing material costs of DSCs, thus rendering them more competitive among various photovoltaic devices.
Recently, many investigations of various alternative Pt-free catalysts have been pursued. In this review, we selectively discuss and summarize the recent advances in novel cathode materials for iodine-free redox couples based electrolytes for DSCs, such as inorganic transition metal compounds, organic conductive polymers and various forms of carbonaceous materials. Apparently, most of the recent advances in these efficient catalysts have been realized by judiciously controlling of the morphology of nanomaterials or by utilizing the collective properties of nano-assembly systems. Finally, this review also highlights the importance of matchup between redox couples and suitable catalysts, as well as the crucial issues that should be addressed in the pursuit of developing low-cost and high-catalytic cathodes for DSCs.
2 Inorganic transition metal compounds
As early as 2003, it has been reported that some early transition metal nitrides have shown noble metal-like behaviour due to the similarity of the electronic structure of the metal nitrides to that of noble metals.75,76 Therefore, it is likely that certain metal nitride may replace Pt as cathode material in DSCs. In this regard, TiN nanotubes arrays, prepared by the anodization of a metallic Ti foil substrate and the subsequent simple nitridation in an ammonia atmosphere, were investigated for usage as Pt-free cathodes in DSCs.70 It is found that highly ordered TiN nanotubes arrays on the metallic Ti foil substrate show an excellent catalytic performance, displaying a Rs of 5.68 Ω and a Rct of 1.51 Ω, which is significantly lower than the value of conventional Pt cathode (21.88 and 7.58 Ω, respectively) with iodide electrolyte. The subsequent work demonstrated that incorporation of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with TiN nanoparticles could provide simultaneous high electrical conductivity and superior electrocatalytic performance, addressing the issue of poor electron transport efficiency across TiN nanoparticles.77 Furthermore, Pt-like electrocatalytic activities of other metallic nitrides such as MoN, WN, and Fe2N were investigated. Among these transition metal nitrides, MoN has superior electrocatalytic activity and a high photovoltaic performance.78 As summarized in Table 1, these breakthroughs have triggered massive research interests in developing other earlier transition metal compounds catalysts, such as surface-nitrided nickel foil,79 VN, Mo2N,80,81 TiN loaded hierarchical catalysts, for instance, micro/nano-structured TiN spheres,82 ordered mesoporous TiN-carbon nanocomposite through a soft-template synthesis,83 and TiN-conductive carbon black composite,84 as well as other sulphides, carbides, oxides and phosphides.

To develop alternative noble metal-free materials capable of replacing Pt as electrocatalysts in DSCs, CoS was firstly introduced and showed better catalytic and photovoltaic performance than ubiquitous platinized cathodes in conjunction with fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass cathode (1.3 Ω cm2).65 The remarkable stability of the cells under prolonged light soaking and thermal stress were demonstrated, which rendered CoS to be an extremely interesting candidate to replace Pt in DSCs. When applied in conjunction with the organic T2/T− ionic liquid electrolyte, CoS cathode showed better photovoltaic performance than the ubiquitous platinized cathode, delivering an efficiency of 4.44% under 0.1 sun irradiation and 5.0% under 0.05 sun irradiation.34 Following these pioneering works, different fabrication methods were utilized to synthesize sulphide cathode, with the target of a higher electrocatalytic active surface area and facile fabrication procedures, such as potentiodynamic electrodeposition,85–87 solution processed transition metal sulphides ((Ni, Co, Cu) sulfides),88 NiS cathodes electrodeposited by a potential reversal technique,89 doctor-bladed WS2 cathode,90 NiS nanoparticles via electrostatic self-assembly.91
MoS2 and WS2 are proposed as cathode catalysts in the I−/I3− and T2/T− based DSCs system by Ma et al.92 The I−/I3− based DSCs using MoS2 and WS2 cathodes achieved a PCE of 7.59 and 7.73%, respectively, which could be compatible with the photovoltaic performance of the DSC (7.64%) using a conventional pyrolysis Pt cathode. When combined with the T2/T− organic redox electrolyte, the photovoltaic parameters for the DSCs using MoS2 and WS2 were superior to that using a Pt cathode. As listed in Table 1, the PCE was 3.70, 4.97 and 5.24% for Pt, MoS2 and WS2 cathode, respectively. These represent improvements of 34 and 41% in PCEs as compared with Pt cathode, mainly arising from the FF enhancements. The results prove that MoS2 and WS2 are more effective than Pt in the regeneration of T2/T− redox couple.
Transition metal carbides have also been studied extensively as new catalytic materials because of their interesting physicochemical and catalytic properties, which resemble those of noble metals.93–96 WC, in particular, has been studied as electrocatalysts in virtue of its low cost, high catalytic activity, selectivity, and good thermal stability under extreme conditions.97–102 The redox mechanism of these highly catalytic metal carbides has been investigated in DSCs.103–106 For instance, WC was reported as a viable cathode catalyst for triiodide-to-iodide as well as disulfide-to-thiolate reduction in DSCs, and a significant improvement in FF in the latter case was observed.36 A high PCE of 5.34% has been achieved by synthesized WC/ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), higher than the efficiency of a conventional Pt cathode by 45% in conjunction with a T2/T− redox electrolyte. The FF enhancement was mainly attributed to the significantly decreased Rct value at the cathode/electrolyte interface, which obtained 2.63 Ω and 60.8 Ω for WC-OMC and Pt cathode, respectively, thus highlighting the superior catalytic activity of the WC-OMC cathode in the disulfide-to-thiolate reduction.
Other forms of early transition metal compounds, such as WO2 nanorod,107 NbO2,108 and sulfur-doped NiO thin film109 have been proposed for highly efficient cathode materials in DSCs with iodide/iodine electrolyte. Xia et al. used V2O5/Al as cathode material in solid DSCs with the hole transfer material 2,2′, 7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD).110 It has been observed that the performance of the solid DSCs depends on the thickness of V2O5 film. After optimization, a solid DSC device with a 10 nm thick V2O5 cathode reached a PCE of 2.0%, close to the performance of the DSC using noble Ag cathode. WO2 imbedded in mesoporous carbon (WO2-MC),111 in which WO2 serves as a catalyst and MC serves as an electrical conductor, was obtained by in situ synthesis technique and then introduced as a versatile cathode catalyst in I−/I3− based redox electrolyte and organic T2/T− redox electrolyte. The I−/I3− based DSC using WO2-MC showed a high PCE of 7.76%, which rivalled the performance of the DSC using a traditional Pt cathode (7.55%). In addition, WO2-MC and WO2 nanorods exhibited higher catalytic activity than Pt for the regeneration of T2. The PCE of T2/T− based DSCs using WO2-MC, WO2, and Pt cathodes were 5.22, 4.66, and 3.09%, respectively. The Rct values of MC, WO2, and WO2-MC based symmetrical cells are 18.7, 6.9, and 5.8 Ω, much lower than that of conventional Pt cathode, 42.5 Ω. However, it should be mentioned that the large diffusion impedance (36.0 and 111.2 Ω) in the WO2-MC and WO2 cathode in catalyzing T2 reduction to T− contributed to a major obstacle to further enhance the photovoltaic performance of these promising catalysts.
Furthermore, MoP, Ni5P4, and carbon supported Ni5P4 (Ni5P4/C) were proposed as cathode catalysts for both conventional I−/I3− redox couple and organic T2/T− redox couple.112 For I−/I3− redox couple, DSCs incorporated with MoP and Ni5P4 cathodes yielded a PCE of 4.92 and 5.71%, and the DSC using Ni5P4/C composite cathode showed a high PCE of 7.54%, comparable to that of the device with a Pt cathode (7.76%). Promisingly, in conjunction with T2/T− redox couple, Ni5P4/C performed much better than Pt counterpart and showed a PCE of 4.75%, much higher than that of the DSC using Pt cathode (3.38%). From cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of these electrodes for T2/T− redox electrolyte, it has been recognized that ΔEp (peak to peak separation) for Ni5P4/C is 0.60 V, considerably lower than that of Pt analog (ca. 0.87 V). Moreover, ΔEp varied inversely with the charge transfer rate (ks) at the cathode surface. Ni5P4/C exhibited a notably larger ks value in comparison with Pt cathode, which corresponded to its high catalytic activity. Besides these advantages, the current densities of Ni5P4/C are also much higher than those of Pt. The high catalytic activity of Ni5P4/C for T2/T− was attributed to the synergistic effect of Ni5P4 and mesoporous carbon, in which the mesoporous carbon improves the conductivity and relative open-structure facilitates the T2/T− electrolyte diffusion. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned the notable peak splitting in the CV plot suggested a higher series resistance in the Ni5P4/C electrode compared to the Pt cathode, which agreed well with fitted impedance results. More significantly, the diffusion resistance in the composite cathode was almost seven-fold higher than Pt analog, posing a further restriction on the final FF of the device.
Recently, cobalt polypyridine complexes have drawn massive attention as substitutes of prevalent I−/I3− redox system in virtue of their low visible light absorption, high redox potential and the reduced corrosiveness towards metallic conductors.23,39,40 However, the volume of cobalt complexes is larger than those of other redox couples, which limited the charge transfer rate and mass transport of the cobalt redox couple in the electrolyte. Therefore, it is necessary to control the thickness and porosity of nanocrystalline TiO2 film and the highly catalytically active cathode materials to ensure an effective charge transfer rate and consequently high photovoltaic performance. Several highly catalytic Pt-free transition metal compounds catalysts for Co2+/3+ complex have been investigated by Ma et al. recently.113 DSCs based on TiC cathodes showed the highest PCE of 4.13%, which was 42% higher than that based on a typical Pt cathode. The other Pt-free catalysts (such as NbO2, OMC and activated carbon (AC)) also displayed excellent photovoltaic performance. Based on EIS and Tafel-polarization studies, the Pt-free catalysts showed higher catalytic activity than that of the Pt. Notably, the derived Rct of TiC, OMC, NbO2, AC cathodes were 0.7, 1.1, 2.8 and 7.0 Ω, much lower than that of conventional Pt cathode, 113.3 Ω, thus manifesting the higher catalytic activity of these Pt-free cathodes in the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+. Tafel polarization curves exhibited a much higher cathodic slope in the symmetrical cells of Pt-free catalysts as compared to that of Pt counterpart, indicating a high exchange current density (J0) on the cathode surface of the non-Pt catalysts, which meant these Pt-free catalysts could push the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ more effectively than conventional Pt cathode. These results demonstrated that non-Pt catalysts might be potential alternatives to the expensive and scarce Pt for low-cost and iodine-free DSCs.
Lately, several other economical Pt-free catalysts, such as various nanoscale early transition-metal catalysts (mainly focused on carbides, nitrides and oxides),80in situ grown Co0.85Se and Ni0.85Se films,114 Cu2ZnSnSe4 film,115 as well as copper zinc tin sulfide electrodes116 appeared in the literature, demonstrating a satisfactory electrocatalytic activity in combination with the prevalent I−/I3− redox electrolyte. These economical inorganic transition metal compounds might also find wide applications in recent well-investigated iodine-free redox couple based electrolytes. However, a fundamental understanding for the high Pt-like catalytic activity of these compounds is necessary. Previous theory suggests that small atoms, such as C or N, when inserted into the interstitial sites of early transition metals, produce a series of interstitial compounds with unique physical and chemical properties.117 However, the direction and extent of electron transfer process between the interstitial atoms and host transition metals still need further investigations.
3 Organic conductive polymers
Recently, extensive studies have been performed using conducting polymers as alternative cathodes in DSCs due to their excellent catalytic activities, low cost, high transparency, good conductivity, easy preparation and good environmental stability. As indicated in Fig. 3, various forms of organic conductive polymers, such as PEDOT,118–124 porous poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT),53,125 polypyrrole (PPy),126–128 polyaniline (PANI)74,129–137 and polythiophene (PTs),138 were commonly applied with conventional I−/I3− redox electrolytes, displaying a comparable catalytic activity and PCE with prevalent Pt cathode. These materials have proven themselves capable of competing with Pt as electrocatalysts in DSCs.

Table 2 presents the photovoltaic performances of several typical conductive polymer cathodes in conjunction with different redox couples. Research on these materials focuses on the development of facile synthesis procedures for nanostructured thin films with high specific surface area. In particular, PEDOT electrodeposited on conducting substrates,120,121 and PProDOT deposited from hydrophobic ionic liquids,64 increased the PCE of DSCs to 8–9%, which were close to that of a conventional Pt cathode. Therefore, conductive polymer films with sufficiently high specific surface area as cathodes for DSCs have shown performance on par with those made with Pt cathode. Furthermore, organic electrocatalysts could produce transparent films deposited by easy procedures, and also allow the use of flexible plastic electrodes. In the same spirit, conductive polymers have also been mixed with inorganic compounds (such as nanostructured TiN,139,140 CoS141) or carbon nanostructures (such as carbon black,142,143 carbon nanoparticles,144,145 graphene,146,147) in order to increase the roughness and, subsequently, specific surface area and electrocatalytic activity.

Interestingly, one dimensional PEDOT nanotube arrays148 and nanofibers149 have been applied as cathodes in DSCs, proved the idea that one-dimensional nanostructures could be used for efficient charge transport.150,151 As investigated by Trevisan et al.,148 PEDOT nanotube arrays (Fig. 4a and b) improved the cathode's catalytic activity compared with their dense and flat counterparts. Furthermore, PEDOT nanotube cathodes presented a performance comparable with platinized cathode, or even better depending on the employed electrolyte. The main factor to determine a superior cathode for the final performance of a DSC is the total series resistance that affects the FF of the cells. Additionally, a poor performing cathode can limit the Jsc and Voc. Moreover, it was observed that Rct depended not only on the type of cathode materials, but also on the type of electrolyte, while the presence of PEDOT typically increased Rs independently of the electrolyte.

Sun et al. recently reported that organic PEDOT exhibited significant improvement in electrocatalytic activity towards sulfide-mediator leading to a high PCE of 6.0% with an organic dye (TH305).35 Detailed studies using EIS and linear-sweep voltammetry revealed that the reduction of disulfide species was more efficient on PEDOT cathode surface than on the commonly platinized electrode, demonstrating a considerably lower Rct at the electrolyte/PEDOT interface and therefore offering a lower potential for the reduction of disulfide. This gave a higher FF value and thus PCE than Pt cathode. However, the observed Voc value using PEDOT cathodes was lower than that of Pt cathode. It was mentioned by the authors that the electron lifetime (τe), extracted from the angular frequency (ωrec) in the Bode phase plots, gave a lifetime of 93 ms for DSCs based on PEDOT cathode, which was significantly lower than that of the platinized FTO cathode (250 ms). The underlying reason for this difference in electron lifetimes is not well understood and further investigation is highly deserved.
It has been widely recognized that conventional Pt cathode presents low catalytic activity for thiolate electrolyte, featuring a high Rct at the platinized cathode interface. Therefore, conductive carbon blacks with several polymers were applied to fabricate highly active composite catalysts for thiolate regeneration.152 An Rct as low as 2 Ω was obtained from the highly active conductive carbon black and PEDOT composite cathode. In combination with a high-absorptive ruthenium dye C106 sensitized TiO2 film and an organic thiolated electrolyte, such a DSC device has generated an overall PCE up to 7.6%.
Further PCE enhancement up to 7.9% was obtained in conjunction with T2/T− redox electrolyte recently by judicious modification of the electrolyte composition and cathode/electrolyte interface.38 At 20 °C, a relatively low Rct of 7.8 Ω cm2 for the T2/T− based electrolyte was achieved with PEDOT/FTO/glass cathode compared to 30.5 Ω cm2 for a Pt cathode. The corresponding values for CoS and PEDOT cathodes on flexible substrates are 33.8 Ω cm2 and 15.2 Ω cm2, separately. The temperature-dependent Rct measurements enable the calculation of the apparent activation energy (Ea) for the electron transfer process at the cathode interface. It has been derived that in the case of T2/T− redox electrolyte, Pt electrode yields an Ea of 30.9 kJ mol−1. Similar results were obtained for the two PEDOT electrodes on different substrates, having values for PEDOT/FTO/glass and PEDOT/ITO/PET of 37.8 kJ mol−1 and 38.1 kJ mol−1, respectively. However, these activation energies were still significantly higher than that in the case of conventional I−/I3−/Pt system (18.4 kJ mol−1).
Significant progress on alternative Pt-free catalysts has also been made in conjunction with the cobalt complex redox electrolyte, which directly led to recent efficiency boost.13 Yum reported that nanoporous PProDOT electrodes exhibited significant improvement in electrocatalytic activity in conjunction with a Co3+/2+ redox mediator, leading to a PCE of 10.08%.12 A comparatively high Rct at Pt cathode with cobalt redox system was observed despite its promising PCE. To reduce the overpotential at the cathode, a high surface area-cathode material (that is, nanoporous PProDOT layers) was exploited to replace the Pt. With the incorporation of the PProDOT as cathode material, the FF was strongly improved owing to a lower Rct and thus the PCE increased to 10.08%. The PProDOT film showed a drastically lower Rct, 2.5 Ω in comparison to the 50 Ω of Pt cathode. The lower Voc, which is plausibly ascribed to the downward shift of the TiO2 band edge, was compensated by a higher FF.
Replacing the standard Pt cathode with PEDOT cathode could dramatically reduce the heterogeneous Rct and reduce mass transport limitations of the photocurrent. This gives rise to a superior photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 10.3% in conjunction with the recently reported organic 3-{6-{4-[bis(2′,4′-dihexyloxybiphenyl-4-yl)amino-]phenyl}-4,4-dihexyl-cyclopenta-[2,1-b:3,4-b]dithiphene-2-yl}-2-cyanoacrylic acid (Y123) dye.58 Highly porous cathodes based on PEDOT were prepared by electro-oxidative polymerization from an ionic liquid solution. It has been shown that the PEDOT cathode exhibited much lower Rct for the cobalt complexes, leading to an improved FF and also linear response of the Jsc to light intensity up to 1 sun, as indicated in Fig. 5. As suggested by the disappearance of the photocurrent decay in the current transients (Fig. 5b), the current reduction due to diffusion limitations of the Co(III)(bpy)3 was alleviated by using PEDOT cathode. This effect was further reflected by the observed linear rise of the Jsc with light intensity for PEDOT in contrast to Pt based cathode devices (blue and green curves in Fig. 5c, respectively). It has been suggested this effect may be due to the 3-dimensional structure and porous morphology of the PEDOT layer, thus reducing the diffusion distance and generating diffusion fields with radial symmetry.

More recently, a series of cobalt complexes with various polypyridyl ligands, where the redox potentials fall into the range from 0.17 to 0.34 V vs. ferrocene, were used as one-electron redox mediators in DSCs together with polymer based cathode.153 The performance of DSCs using the molecularly engineered cobalt redox shuttle and poly(3,4-alkylthiophenes) based cathode was better than that with I3−/I− redox shuttle and platinized cathode. Moreover, implementation of high surface area PProDOT films allowed higher catalytic activity thus minimizing the cathode/electrolyte interface resistance. It has been proposed that the obtained highly porous microstructure of the PProDOT film was possibly due to the use of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), which not only worked as a supporting electrolyte in the synthesis of polymers but also altered the reaction pathways and product microstructures due to their hydrophobicity. With the proper choice of RTILs, the shape and pore size of a polymer material can be tuned easily. With the change of anion in the RTILs, the microstructure changes from small fibril shapes to elongated fibril to sponge like morphology. Such a distinct morphologies obtained with the use of RTILs was attributed to the insertion of both cation and anion in the polymer matrix.154 In conjunction with an organic dye Y123, devices with porous PProDOT film cathode conferred a Voc of 999 mV, a FF of 0.78 and a PCE of 9.9%, which were considerably higher than that of platinized cathode device accompanied with a FF of 0.74 and a PCE of 8.24%.
4 Carbonaceous materials
4.1 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the unique emerging nanoscale materials with the combined advantages of large surface area, high electrical conductivity and chemical stability, have recently attracted numerous attention as practical alternatives for Pt-free cathodes in DSCs and exhibited reasonable performance.71,155–162 Specifically, aligned MWCNTs arrays have been widely used to replace the Pt cathodes to catalyze the reduction of triiodide in DSCs with the target of better performance and lower material cost.68,155,163–167 Promisingly, highly purified and aligned CNTs, directly grown by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, were used as the cathode for the iodide mediated DSC, where a PCE over 10% was recorded for the first time, which was considerably higher than 8.80% for a reference Pt cathode.156 As listed in Table 3, a remarkable enhancement of FF of 0.65 to 0.73 was observed when altering the cathode from Pt to vertically aligned CNTs. Using the thermal CVD approach to synthesize the CNTs electrodes, the electron conduction path between the electrolyte and the FTO glass was significantly improved. It has been suggested that the higher FF with a direct-grown CNTs cathode could be attributed to the faster redox reaction on the cathode surface. However, studies on the exploration of these aligned CNTs electrodes in iodine-free electrolytes were quite sparse.

Recently, vertically aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes (VASWCNTs) have been implemented as efficient Pt-free cathode in sulfide-mediated DSCs.168 High quality VASWCNTs arrays were firstly grown in a CVD system at 750 °C, and then transferred onto FTO glass substrates to produce robust cathodes. Apparently, as indicated in Fig. 6a, incorporation of the VASWCNTs promoted a significantly reduced diameter of the high-frequency semicircles, demonstrating a Rct of only 12.66 Ω for the VASWCNTs cathode, a value six-fold lower than that of conventional Pt cathode (76.28 Ω) under similar measurement conditions, thus highlighting the superior electrocatalytic activity of the VASWCNTs towards T2/T− redox couples. Furthermore, obvious shift of the characteristic response peaks in the high-frequency regime of Bode plot (Fig. 6b) implies a faster electron transfer at the interface between VASWCNTs and electrolyte with respect to conventional Pt cathode. In addition, it is also observed that the VASWCNTs electrodes exhibit a notably larger double-layer capacitance than the Pt electrodes, which is consistent well with the higher specific surface area in the CNTs cathodes.
 Fig. 6  Nyquist (a) and Bode plots (b) of the symmetrical dummy cell towards T2/T− electrolyte and aqueous polysulfide electrolyte ((c) and (d)), as well as the Tafel polarization plots (e).168 
The superior electrocatalytic activity of VASWCNTs electrodes towards T2/T− electrolyte further inspired the implementation of this cathode in other sulfide electrolyte systems, such as the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte commonly applied in quantum dots-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). In combination with an aqueous polysulfide electrolyte, dramatic reduction in the Rct of VASWCNTs electrode was observed in comparison with that of Pt electrode as depicted in Fig. 6c–e. In parallel with previous studies on the catalytic activity for polysulfide solutions,169–174 Pt electrode exhibited a huge Rct in the order of 105 Ω, mainly due to the poor catalytic activity. Encouragingly, utilization of the VASWCNTs greatly enhanced the electrocatalytic activity, yielding a small Rct value of only 21.22 Ω. Such an Rct value is the lowest ever seen in the polysulfide electrolyte, even compared with recently reported PbS175 and Cu2S cathodes.176 Complementarily, significant high-frequency shift of the characteristic response peaks in the Bode plot were observed. The anodic and cathodic branches of the Tafel polarization plots for VASWCNTs electrodes exhibited an obviously larger slope than the conventional Pt cathodes, indicating the presence of a large exchange current density (J0) on the electrode surfaces. Moreover, a higher limiting current density (Jlim) is noted in conjunction with VASWCNTs cathode, which suggested a higher diffusion coefficient of the polysufide redox couple in the electrolyte compared to that of Pt electrode. Therefore, the highly catalytic VASWCNTs cathodes are believed to be a versatile candidate for further improvement of the PCE of other iodine-free redox couple based DSCs and polysulfide electrolyte based QDSCs.
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that super-aligned carbon nanotube (SCNT) array, firstly grown on silicon wafer using CVD method,177 can be easily converted into continuous films by convenient cross-stacking technique, with aligned CNTs parallel to the direction of drawing.178 Such SCNT films opened up new possibilities of fabricating CNTs devices with uniform properties on a large scale, which are currently attracting worldwide interest in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Novel applications of these freestanding thin films have been developed, such as transparent conductive films, electron sources, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids, loudspeakers, touch panels, electrodes for lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, and so on.179 These exciting applications of the SCNT triggered the exploration of its electrochemical utilization as inexpensive cathode in DSCs with recently developed T2/T− redox shuttle on account of its superior conductivity and chemical stability.180
The cross-stacked (CS) sheet was obtained by sequential stacking along one direction followed by stacking in its perpendicular direction. Notably, as depicted in Fig. 7, the Rct of the CSCNT cathode was only 1.26 Ω cm2, which was one order of magnitude lower than that of conventional Pt cathode (12.55 Ω cm2) under similar measurement conditions. Importantly, this value is considerably lower than that of recently recognized porous PEDOT cathode (7.8 Ω cm2).38 Compared with previous study on the VASWCNTs cathode,168 the CSCNT cathode also exhibits higher catalytic activity, mainly due to the higher degree of defects in the multi-walled CNTs cathode.181,182 Furthermore, as indicated in the inset of Fig. 7a, the characteristic response peak shifted from 2539 Hz to 17580 Hz when changed from Pt cathode to CSCNT cathode, implying a considerable faster electron transfer rate across the CSCNT cathode/electrolyte interface with respect to Pt cathode. In addition, it is also observed that the CSCNT cathode exhibited a notably larger double-layer capacitance (Cdl, 2.57 × 10−6 F) than Pt electrode (4.22 × 10−8 F). This is in accordance with the recent results of other nanostructured cathode with a high porosity.162,183 More importantly, as shown in Fig. 7b, Pt cathode yielded an apparent activation energy of 32.67 kJ mol−1, which is in agreement with recent values observed by J. Burschka et al. (30.9 kJ mol−1).38 Spectacularly, the CSCNT cathode demonstrated greatly decreased apparent activation energy of only 6.90 kJ mol−1, a value almost 4-fold lower than that of Pt cathode. This value is very impressive even compared with the recently recognized highly catalytic materials for T2/T− redox couples, such as CoS (33.8 kJ mol−1) and porous PEDOT (37.8 kJ mol−1).38 The electrochemical stability of CSCNT cathode in the electrolyte surroundings was further tested by consecutive measurements of EIS at room temperature. The CSCNT cathode survived this test without apparent changes in terms of Rs and Rct, but the electrocatalytic activity of Pt cathode decreased in each subsequent measurement. The possible reason for the deactivation of Pt cathode in the sulfur-functionalized electrolyte with time most likely resulted from the specific adsorption of sulfur atoms on the cathode surface and thus the reduced rate of the catalytic reduction of the oxidized species at the Pt cathode.28,36,37

Insets of (c) show the derived apparent activation energies from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots.180 
A new organic electrolyte system composed of 1-methyl-3-propylimidazole-2-thione (T) and 2,2′-dithiobis(1-methyl-3-propyl-2-imidazolinium) ditriflate (DT) has been formulated and used in iodine-free DSCs.184 CNTs webs were implemented as cathodes with references to thin films of Pt and CoS on FTO. It has been noted that CoS cathode showed much better electroactivity towards the regeneration of the thiolate electrolyte compared to classical Pt cathode. In addition, electroactive layers of MWCNTs webs have been investigated as cathode in such a T/DT-based electrolyte. Cathodes with a configuration of 20 layers of the webs showed great performance towards the reduction of DT. An efficiency up to 4.12% has been attained in a DSC with 20 layers of MWCNTs webs, whereas by using a CoS based cathode a slightly lower efficiency (3.99%) was measured.
4.2 Graphene
In recent years, graphene, atomically thick two-dimensional carbon lattice structure arranged in a hexagonal “honeycomb”, is a rapidly rising star in nanomaterial research.185 Monolayer graphene possesses a high carrier mobility (>200000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at an electron density of 4 × 109 cm−2),186,187 a high specific surface area (2600 m2 g−1)188 and a high optical transparency (97.7%).189 These unusual properties have stimulated the extensive exploration of graphene for use in many applications such as transparent electrodes,190,191 filed emission,192 supercapacitor193 and lithium-ion batteries.194 Graphene has also been demonstrated to be a promising cathode material for DSCs due to its excellent conductivity, transparency, corrosion resistance and high electrocatalytic activity.176,195–219 Several studies have shown the correlation between the structure of graphene and its electrochemical properties, especially for its charge transfer reactions.218,219 Roy-Mayhew et al. reported that graphene sheets have the catalytic and electrical properties required for a cathode material, as well as excellent flexibility.218 They showed that the performance of DSCs could be controlled by controlling the C/O ratio of graphene, following a reduction by a thermal process. Kavan et al. further demonstrated that the electrocatalytic properties of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) that took part in the redox reaction were related to the defects and the concentration of oxygen-containing groups.220 According to the literature, defect-rich graphene has unique properties that enable its use as a catalyst due to its abundant active sites and its hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups.181,182
Recently, GNPs in the form of thin semi-transparent film on FTO conducting glasses exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity for Co3+/2+ mediators, outperforming the activity of platinized FTO for the cobalt shuttle.57 The exchange current densities for Co3+/2+ redox reaction scaled linearly with the GNPs film's optical absorbance, which were by 1–2 orders of magnitude larger than those for I−/I3− couple on the same electrode. The electrocatalytic activity of GNPs films with optical transmission below 88% outperformed the activity of platinized FTO for Co3+/2+ redox reactions. DSCs with Y123 dye adsorbed on TiO2 photoanode achieved efficiencies between 8% and 10% for both GNPs and Pt-based cathodes. However, the cell with GNPs cathode was superior to that with Pt cathode particularly in FF and in the efficiency at higher illumination intensities.
Following this study, in conjunction with Y123-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes and Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox shuttle, DSCs using this GNPs cathode exhibited superior photovoltaic performance to that with the Pt cathode particularly in FF and PCE at higher illumination intensity coupled with excellent electrochemical stability under prolonged potential cycling.56 More importantly, the electrochemical stability of GNPs electrodes was tested by repeated measurements of electrochemical impedance after some time of aging at room temperature and open circuit. Apparently, the Rct for Pt cathode, which was originally 5.5 Ω cm2 in the first cycle, gradually increased up to 19.3 Ω cm2 in the 10th cycle. On the other hand, the G96 GNPs electrode exhibited Rct of 3.3 Ω cm2 independent of the cycle history.
By using ethyl cellulose as a sacrificial binder partially thermolyzed, functionalized graphene sheet (FGS) electrodes were constructed exhibiting lower effective Rct (<1 Ω cm2) than the thermally decomposed Pt electrodes (as depicted in Fig. 8).204 This performance was achieved not only for the classical I−/I3− redox couple, but also for the two other major redox mediators used in DSCs, based on cobalt and sulfur complexes, showing the versatility of the functionalized graphene sheet cathodes. DSCs using these FGS electrodes demonstrated efficiencies equal to or higher than those using thermally decomposed Pt electrodes in each of the three major redox mediators: iodide redox electrolyte (PCEFGS = 6.8%, PCEPt = 6.8%), cobalt electrolyte (4.5%, 4.4%), and sulfide electrolyte (3.5%, 2.0%). However, it has been pointed out that beside the high surface area of a cathode catalyst, two other important characteristics should also be considered to get a satisfactory catalytic performance: (a) enough residue in the composite to maintain structural stability and prevent restacking of FGSs upon the introduction of the solvent, and (b) this residue must not disperse in the electrolyte.

4.3 Other carbonaceous materials
Beside aforementioned CNT and graphene catalysts, other forms of carbonaceous materials have also been exploited as alternative cathode materials in DSCs. Carbon electrodes and carbon derivative cathodes are extensively employed in DSCs due to their low cost, good catalytic activity, excellent electrical conductivity, high thermal stability, and high corrosion resistance. Various form of carbon materials, such as amorphous carbon,222 carbon black,223 mesocellular carbon foam,224 pyrolytic carbon,225 inverse opal carbons,226 commercial fountain pen ink,227 mesoporous carbon,228–236 hierarchical nanostructured carbon,172,237–239 and low-dimensional carbon nanofibers (CNFs)183,240,241 have been widely applied with traditional I−/I3− redox electrolytes. Recently, nine kinds of carbon materials were introduced into DSCs system as low-cost cathode catalysts.242 The catalytic activity of these carbon materials for the reduction of triiodide to iodide was systematically measured by CV, EIS and Tafel-polarization curve. Various kinds of carbon materials including synthesized well-ordered mesoporous carbon, activated carbon, carbon black, conductive carbon, carbon dye, carbon fiber, commercial CNTs, discarded toner of a printer and fullerene were investigated. Interestingly, all these carbon materials displayed electrochemical catalytic activity for triiodide reduction. Particularly, the well-ordered mesoporous carbon showed excellent electrochemical catalytic activity which can be comparable to the performance of conventional Pt cathode. After optimizing the composition and fabrication procedures of the carbon paste, the DSCs based on these carbon cathodes achieved PCE in the range of 2.8–7.5%, comparable to that of 7.5% for a Pt cathode. This results undoubtedly demonstrate that carbon material is a promising substitute for the expensive Pt cathode for low-cost DSCs, especially for the large-scale implementation of DSC technology.
Large-effective-surface-area polyaromatic hydrocarbon (LPAH) was used as an efficient catalytic layer for the cathode in DSCs.243 The LPAH particles showed a uniform size around 10 nm and exhibited more than 3-fold higher specific surface area as well as 45% enhanced pore diameters compared with those of carbon black particles. The increased active surface to volume ratio of the LPAH layer makes it possible to accelerate the charge species diffusion and catalytic reactions at the cathode surface. Consequently, a LPAH cathode based DSCs showed superior electrocatalytic activity and thus higher PCE to that of Pt electrode. In addition to replace Pt cathode with LPAH as the catalyst, the conventional FTO substrate for cathode was also replaced by a graphite film to further reduce the cell internal resistance and thus improve cell efficiency. In this way an all carbon cathode delivered nearly 9% of PCE as measured with a masked frame. Promisingly, this efficiency was more than 20% higher than that of Pt cathodes based DSCs.
Carbonaceous materials have also shown excellent electrochemical activity towards iodine-free redox electrolytes. As early as 2002, Bignozzi et al. first reported the spray-coated carbon outperformed Pt in initial tests with a number of cobalt complexes of substituted polypyridine ligands, revealing a dramatic and unexpected electrode surface dependence to the electron-transfer kinetics.39 It has been observed that gold electrodes exhibited the most reversible and ideally shaped CV curves for the cobalt complex electrolyte, while glassy carbon electrodes also produced quasi-reversible voltammograms, although less reversible than the gold cathode. Quite unexpectedly, the voltammetry on conventional Pt electrodes was quite irreversible with large anodic and cathodic peak separations (ΔEp) or, in some cases, peaks that were too broad to be distinguishable. Therefore, these results suggested that, while Pt electrode was the cathode of choice for the prevalent I−/I3− redox mediator, it appeared not to be the optimal one for cobalt complex-based mediators. On the contrary, while carbon was a poor cathode for I−/I3− redox mediator system, it could be acceptable for the cobalt systems. However, the carbon cathode was unstable for extended periods due to the poor connection between the graphite particles. Nevertheless, these results demonstrated the proof-of-concept that a stable carbon cathode could function well in cells based on these cobalt mediators for the first time.
Later on, screen-printed carbon electrodes associated with tris(4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine) cobalt(II) as redox mediator were investigated as possible alternative to the volatile and corrosive I−/I3− system, but its performance was inferior to that of Pt cathode and iodide redox electrolyte.244 Screen printed carbon electrodes were prepared by using a carbon ink containing carbon, epoxy resin, and hardener. Di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether was used to adjust the ink viscosity. It has been pointed out that the chemical composition of the outer surface of the carbon electrodes could have a strong influence on the electron transfer kinetics, i.e., polymer residues used in the preparation of the ink could act as an insulating layer, increasing the activation barrier for the electron transfer and causing a limitation of the electron transfer rate at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, surface polishing was found to affect the electrochemical behaviour of the Co2+ complex. With the aid of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, it was found that there was a significant change in surface composition with a strong decrease of the O1s and N1s components associated to a simultaneous increase of the C1s component after the polishing process, demonstrating the removal of the insulating binder from the carbon electrode surface (the binder was initially used in the formulation of the screen printing carbon paste), thus exposing pure conductive graphitic phase, capable of displaying a satisfactory electrochemical response towards the Co3+/2+ redox couple.
Carbonaceous materials have also been investigated with the sulfide-based redox couples in light of their low costs and high conductivities. Recently, Wu et al. reported graphite sheets as the substrates and catalytic materials for T2/T− redox couple, demonstrating a PCE of 4.79% compared with a 3.97% of Pt cathode under similar experimental condition.37 In contrast, when conventional Pt was used as cathodes, PCE values were 3.97% and 7.13% for electrolyte containing T2/T− and I−/I3− redox couples, respectively. With respect to the dramatic photo-voltage difference, CV and EIS were applied to study the catalytic behavior at electrolyte/cathode interface. In particular, EIS measurements indicated that the interfacial Rct (1.1 Ω cm2) of the graphite sheet for T2/T− redox electrolyte was one-order of magnitude lower than its Rct (10.2 Ω cm2) for I−/I3− electrolyte. However, the Rct of Pt cathode (7.7 Ω cm2) for T2/T− was more than twice the Rct (3.0 Ω cm2) of I−/I3−, clearly demonstrating the high catalytic selectivity of graphite and Pt cathode for the above two redox couple systems.
5 Conclusions and outlook
During the last decade, iodine-free DSCs have attracted more attention and this field has been advanced rapidly. Although the conventional choice of cathode material, Pt, functions well for regeneration of the I−/I3− redox couple, the obvious disadvantages such as high cost, limited resource, corrosion by the I−/I3− redox couple and inadequate electrocatalytic activity towards recently developed iodine-free redox electrolytes greatly hindered its practical DSC applications in the future. Therefore, developing alternative low-cost and high-catalytic catalysts to replace Pt is of great importance. Promisingly, significant progress has been advanced in this respect recently by selective controlling of the morphology of nanomaterials or utilizing the collective properties of nano-assembly systems. In summary, we selectively present the recent advances in novel cathode materials for these iodine-free redox couples based electrolytes, such as inorganic transition metal compounds, organic conductive polymers and carbonaceous materials (such as CNTs and graphene).
Early transition metal compounds (especially carbides, nitrides, carbides and nitrides) have drawn considerable research interests as classical Pt cathode substitutes recently, demonstrating excellent catalytic activity towards the organic T2/T− and cobalt redox electrolytes. Organic polymers (PEDOT, PPy and PANI etc.) also offer a promising alternative as flexible and transparent cathode materials, even outperforming prevalent Pt cathodes in conjunction with iodine-free redox electrolytes, conferring a new efficiency record up to 12.3%. Very recently, low-dimensional carbonaceous materials, in particular, aligned CNTs arrays and graphene films, have found wide application in these iodine-free DSCs. Superior electrocatalytic activity and significantly lower apparent activation energy have been witnessed in the CNTs cathode/sulfide electrolyte interface. Satisfactory electrochemical stability has also been obtained with sulfide- and cobalt-redox electrolyte surroundings.
It should be pointed out that the FF of device is generally governed by the total resistance in the cells, which includes the Rct at the cathode/electrolyte interface, the electron transport resistance in the semiconducting electrode Rt, the series resistance Rs as well as the diffusion resistance in the electrolyte and cathode materials. However, these emerging alternative cathodes generally presents promising catalytic activities toward iodine-free electrolytes by displaying lower Rct than conventional Pt electrode, but always accompanying a huge inherent Rs and high diffusion resistance in the cathode due to the poor conductivity and micrometer-scale thickness of the electrodes. Therefore, utilization of these materials cannot guarantee an increase in the device FF and final photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, novel composite cathode of two or more proper materials with specific functions can be constructed for the sake of satisfactory catalytic activity and attenuation of the total resistance, which paves a rationable way to design high-efficiency catalysts for iodine-free DSCs.
Remarkably, some new catalysts exhibits significant catalytic selectivity towards various redox electrolytes, thus highlighting the importance of the matchup between suitable catalysts and the redox couples. For the disulfide redox couples (e.g. T2/T−), nanoporous conductive polymer films (e.g. PEDOT, PProDOT) exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity, leading to a new PCE record up to approximate 8%. Nevertheless, recent studies showed promising potential of CNTs arrays towards this disulfide redox couples, especially in terms of apparent activation energy for the charge-transfer process and long-term stability in the electrolyte environment. Graphene films and conductive polymer films could effective catalyze the cobalt complex redox system, rendering a high Voc up to 1 V and a PCE around 12%. Some transition metal compounds showed promising catalytic activity towards these iodine-free electrolytes, but the high electrolyte diffusion resistance in such films presents a major obstacle to achieve a satisfactory FF and PCE for these devices.
It has been noticed that mastering the dynamics of charge transfer that take place in the iodine-free DSCs employing alternative redox electrolytes is the key to further improve the photovoltaic performance. It is imperative to deepen our understanding of the factors that govern these charge transfer processes. Therefore, studies on the fundamental electrocatalytic mechanisms of novel cathode catalysts for iodine-free redox couple regeneration are needed. Furthermore, the stability test of alternative cathode materials was quite sparse in the literatures, more rigorous accelerated stability tests of new cathode materials for DSCs using new cathode catalysts, especially with these novel iodine-free redox electrolytes were highly demanded to enhance the reproducibility of the results. Given the superior electrochemical stability of CNTs and graphene based cathodes, it has been found that the defects and functional groups of these carbonaceous materials play a critical role in the electrocatalytic sites in such DSC cathodes. Therefore, sensible tuning of the defects and searching for effective functional groups for these carbonaceous cathodes might be promising research directions for future cathode candidates for iodine-free DSCs.

Broader context
Interest in solar energy conversion and development of associated materials has been consecutively growing due to concerns over carbon dioxide emissions and increasing pressure on supply of fossil fuels nowadays. Mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have emerged as a credible alternative to solid-state p–n junction photovoltaic devices in virtue of their great potential to enable more affordable solar-generated electricity using resource-abundant raw materials and energy-saving device processing techniques. Over the last decades, iodine-free redox couples have been widely investigated as alternatives for the ubiquitous triiodide/iodide redox shuttles in DSCs, yielding a new power conversion efficiency record of 12.3% by using a porphyrin sensitizer coupled with a co-sensitizer and Co(II/III)(2,2′-bipyridine)3 complex redox shuttle. However, conventional platinum cathodes show poor catalytic activity towards those iodine-free redox couples, thus resulting in poor fill factors and relatively moderate power conversion efficiencies. The ultimate solution to address this challenge is to develop alternative economical platinum-free catalysts. Many investigations of various alternative platinum-free catalysts have been pursued. This review selectively summarizes the recent advances in novel cathode materials for electrolytes free of iodine-based redox couples, and discusses crucial issues that should be addressed in the pursuit of developing low-cost and high-catalytic cathodes for DSCs.


 	Fig. 1  Schematic energy diagram displaying the major kinetic processes in the operation of DSCs. The relevant processes of the redox shuttle described in the text: dye regeneration (k3), diffusion (Do), and charge recombination with the injected electron in TiO2 electrode (k5). Inset shows the energy levels of various redox couple electrolytes.
