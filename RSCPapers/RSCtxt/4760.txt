    AbstractSol–gel reaction conditions that enable the growth of one-dimensional (1D) anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructures from fluorine-doped indium tin oxide (FTO) substrates are described. The generation of these linear nanostructures is achieved using acetic acid (HOAc) and titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4) in anhydrous heptane in the absence of an external bias or template. The procedure requires the functionalization of base-treated substrates with Ti-oxide nucleation sites, which serve as a foundation for the growth of linear Ti-oxide macromolecules. Calcination of these macromolecules at 450 °C under an ambient atmosphere produce uniform films of randomly oriented anatase TiO2 nanowires. The nucleation and growth processes are both acutely sensitive to the relative molar ratio (R) of HOAc to Ti(OiPr)4. Optimal surface coverage of the nucleation sites is observed when the R value utilized for the nucleation phase (denoted Ri) is equal to 1.3. The highest quality nanowire films were obtained when the R value employed during the gelation phase (denoted Rf) was held between 8.5 and 14. Characterization of the films by electron microscopy revealed a uniform film of disordered anatase TiO2 nanowires with high aspect ratios. The dimensions of the nanostructures correspond to lengths of ca. 1–10 μm and widths of 54 ± 10 nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques demonstrate that the anatase nanowires are a linear arrangement of crystallites ranging in size from 13 to 19 nm. A systematic evaluation of how reaction conditions (e.g., solvent volume, stoichiometry of reagents, substrate base treatment) affect the generation of these TiO2 films is presented.
Introduction
One-dimensional semiconducting metal-oxide nanostructures have received significant attention in a wide range of applications primarily due to their ability to constrain the movement of electrons and photons in one direction.1–3 In the context of electronic and photoelectrochemical applications (e.g., dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)4–6), the electrical and structural anisotropy within this class of materials has proven to be a particularly effective means of increasing the rate of electron transport and charge collection at the supporting anode (Fig. 1).7–9 The vast majority of linear nanostructures that have been successfully incorporated into photovoltaic devices, such as the DSSC, have been based predominantly on ZnO7–9 and TiO2.10,11 Although the crystalline nature of ZnO is more accommodating to axial growth,12,13 it is susceptible to degradation in acidic media,14 which compromises the power output of the DSSC. Devices containing a TiO2 anode have been shown to exhibit relatively high power conversion efficiencies;15,16 however, the growth of TiO2 nanowires from a substrate is inherently more difficult due to the crystal structure and symmetry of the respective materials.17

While there is a broad set of electrochemical,11,18 solvothermal19–24 and hydrothermal25,26 techniques capable of generating TiO2 nanoscale wires, rods, and/or tubes in the bulk phase, the attachment of these structures to a support is often more challenging.27,28 This shortcoming has important implications in the construction of device structures because the covalent attachment of the nanowire array to a substrate is often a necessary prerequisite for optimal charge collection. Notwithstanding, a host of techniques leading to nanowire arrays have recently been documented; e.g., hydrothermal treatment;29 alumina or ZnO nanorod templating;18,30,31 thermal deposition;32 and electrochemical anodization.11,33 Despite these synthetic advances, the scale of these methods is generally limited by the need for exotic reagents or templates, multiple reaction steps, and/or energy-intensive procedures.
On this basis, recent independent reports by Grimes et al.27 and Aydil et al.34 detailing the sol–gel growth of oriented rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays from transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates in the absence of a template and/or external bias, represent important advancements in the field. The implementation of these nanowire films in the DSSC produced reasonable power conversion efficiencies (η) of ca. 3–5%; however, this value is still significantly less than the η > 10% that can be produced with films based on anatase TiO2 nanoparticles.35 The lower performance of the films with the linear nanostructures can be ascribed to a lower available surface area necessary for dye loading.9,34 Moreover, the rutile phase of TiO2 typically exhibits higher charge recombination rates and lower transparencies relative to anatase TiO2 nanoparticulate films of comparative thickness.36
We have therefore focused our efforts on the growth of anatase TiO2 nanowires from TCO substrates using facile synthetic sol–gel techniques.37,38 Achieving this goal is challenging because anatase TiO2 adopts a distorted octahedron edge-sharing packing arrangement, whereas the octahedron corner-sharing motif of the thermodynamically more stable rutile phase is more accommodating to axial growth (Fig. 2).17,39 Moreover, the lattice matching factor between FTO and rutile TiO2 is < 2%,34 a feature that facilitates the linear growth of the rutile phase directly from the substrate. This same structural attribute cannot be exploited in the case of anatase TiO2 because of a large lattice mismatch of ca. 19%.40 Despite said obstacles, we outline herein a molecular self-assembly approach that overcomes the challenge of generating anatase TiO2 arrays on TCO substrates using sol–gel chemistry without the aid of an external bias or template.

The synthetic conditions we use to grow films of anatase TiO2 nanowires follow design principles that have been shown to produce high aspect ratio TiO2 nanostructures in the bulk phase.22 For example, we have shown previously that the treatment of Ti(OiPr)4 with HOAc in non-polar media suppresses the rapid precipitation of particles to favor the formation of linear macromolecules that form anatase TiO2 nanowires upon calcination.38 It has also been documented in other solvothermal processes that the identity of the acid plays an integral role in determining the crystalline phase of the TiO2 product; e.g., there is a progressively greater preference for the anatase phase over rutile when the hydrolyzing acid is HOAc > H2SO4 > HNO3 > HCl, respectively.41,42 Indeed, the aforementioned studies by Grimes et al.27 and Aydil et al.34 using HCl produced the rutile form of TiO2. While we note that this acid dependence does not always hold,25 we demonstrate in this work that HOAc does facilitate the preferential formation of linear TiO2 macromolecules to ultimately afford anatase nanowires on TCO substrates that have been previously coated with Ti-oxide nucleation sites. We provide a systematic evaluation of how reaction conditions affect the nucleation and growth of the Ti-oxide macromolecules, and how these parameters affect the surface coverage and morphologies of the anatase TiO2 nanostructured films.
Results and discussion
This study details how an appropriate ratio of HOAc and Ti(OiPr)4 in anhydrous heptane fosters the axial growth of linear Ti-oxide macromolecules from TCO substrates that render anatase TiO2 nanowires upon calcination. We have observed that the following steps are critical to achieving robust, uniform films of anatase TiO2 nanowires attached to a TCO substrate: (i) base treatment of the substrate; (ii) formation of Ti-oxide nucleation sites on the surface; (iii) growth of linear Ti-oxide macromolecules from the nucleation sites; (iv) gelation; and (v) calcination (Fig. 3). While the morphology of the film is sensitive to a number of factors, we have determined that an optimal molar ratio (R) of HOAc to Ti(OiPr)4 during two distinct phases of the reaction is fundamental to nanowire growth. Specifically, the first phase, or nucleation phase, requires an initial R value, denoted Ri (where Ri = moli HOAc/moli Ti(OiPr)4), near unity, while the subsequent growth phase requires a final R value, denoted Rf (where Rf = (moli HOAc + molf HOAc)/moli Ti(OiPr)4), greater than 5. Calcination conditions were held constant for all trials: 450 °C for 2 h at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 (temperatures > 500 °C led to the onset of the rutile phase, and are not discussed in this study). The specific roles of these reaction parameters, as well as the effects of stirring, substrate pretreatment and solvent volume, on the growth process of the nanostructures are addressed in sequence below (experimental conditions are summarized in Table S1, ESI†).

Substrate and pretreatment
The surface of the substrate plays an integral role in the binding of TiO2 nanostructures; thus, the initial phase of our studies evaluated the growth processes from ITO and FTO substrates. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging shows that the surface roughness of ITO (Rrms = 2.2 nm) is less than that of the FTO surface (Rrms = 31.2 nm; Fig. S1, ESI†). Moreover, the AFM images show that the ITO surface consists of small grain sizes that are on the order of tens of nanometres, while the FTO substrate exhibits granular features with diameters in the 50–150 nm range. The grain morphology and size of the FTO is known to affect the growth of oriented nanostructures. Aydil et al.34 noted that the convergent crystal lattice parameters of FTO (a = b = 4.687 Å)43 and the rutile phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 88-1175, a = b = 4.594 Å) enabled the growth of rutile nanowires directly from the substrate. The lattice parameters of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272, a = b = 3.782 Å), however, are markedly different than those of FTO; thus, this same feature cannot be easily exploited to grow anatase structures in the same manner.
These observations prompted us to implement a synthetic protocol that involves the initial functionalization of the surface with Ti-oxide nucleation sites. Initial base treatment of the substrate was found to enhance the affinity of the nucleation sites for the surface. FTO substrates that are not subject to base treatment lead to a poor coverage of TiO2 nanowires when holding the other reaction parameters at parity. An overnight treatment of FTO with 0.5 M NaOH, however, produced significantly better surface coverage (Fig. S2, ESI†). The hydrophilic OH− sites present on the surface of the FTO facilitate the rapid hydrolysis of the Ti4+ precursor at the heptane/FTO interface. The base treatment of the ITO substrates also improved the surface coverage of the TiO2 nanostructures, but the resultant substrate properties were poor relative to the FTO substrates (e.g., the electrical conductivity of the ITO was compromised by thermal sintering). Notably, a minor decrease of ∼1 Ω cm−2 in sheet resistance for the FTO substrates was observed after chemical and thermal treatment. Based on these collective observations, FTO films treated with 0.5 M NaOH for 24 h were used for our examination of the other reaction parameters.
Substrate functionalization: role of Ri
The nucleation procedure involves the addition of base-treated substrates to a reaction flask containing an initial molar ratio of HOAc to Ti(OiPr)4 (Ri) in heptane at 60 °C. In order to delineate the nucleation and subsequent growth processes, a series of experiments were carried out where Rf was held constant at 14 while adjusting Ri over the 0.5–14 range (Table S1, ESI†). While various TiO2 nanostructures consisting of variable aspect ratios were obtained for all experiments, the Ri value appears to primarily govern surface coverage (Fig. 4). When Ri = 0.5, for example, there is non-uniform coverage of TiO2 nanowires on the substrate. At Ri = 1.3, optimal surface coverage is observed (Fig. 4); reasonable surface coverage at Ri ≥ 2 is also observed, but the films are relatively poor in comparison with those obtained at Ri = 1.3. Note that the films at Ri = 1.3 contain a random collection of residual particulates that collect on the surface of the wires during film growth that can be easily removed by transparent tape.

Cross-sectional field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of an FTO substrate after the nucleation phase (prior to the growth phase) provide a snapshot of the nucleation sites on the surface (Fig. 5a). The plan view SEM image highlights the uniformity of the nucleation sites over the entire FTO surface, while the cross-sectional image (Fig. 5a, inset) reveals the aggregation of clusters approximately 30–50 nm in diameter. It is evident at this early stage of the reaction that there is a preference for axial growth from the irregular surface of the FTO. The cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the TiO2 film following wire growth provided in Fig. 5b shows clear evidence that the wires originate from nucleation sites on the substrate surface. The orientation of wire growth appears to be orthogonal to the irregular faces of the FTO grains (Fig. 5b, inset), thereby driving wire growth in different directions.

A quantitative assessment of the surface coverage is a difficult task because many of our conclusions are made after gelation has occurred, thereby providing an indirect evaluation of the nucleation mechanism. Notwithstanding, our results indicate that Ri directly affects the uniformity of the surface coverage of the wires (Fig. 4 and 5), with a lesser effect on the subsequent macromolecular growth process and morphology of the calcined film. The fact that the best coverage of non-aggregated nanowires was obtained when Ri = 1.3 is striking in that it resonates with an acid:Ti ratio that has been shown to promote the formation of hexanuclear molecular intermediates; e.g., Ti6O6(OAc)6(OiPr)6.22,38,44,45 It has been shown that these molecular clusters can be generated in solution in < 1 min at R = 1.3, and suggested that the ligand arrangement about the Ti-oxide core of the cluster facilitates axial condensation at higher R values to form macromolecular chains.38 On this basis, we postulate that the Ti-oxide clusters form in solution and then dehydratively couple to the surface hydroxyl groups of the base-treated substrate; axial condensation is not likely to occur until an additional acid treatment (i.e., Rf).
In experiments where Ri < 1, a limited quantity of Ti(OiPr)4 is hydrolyzed; thus, the production of precursors that can bind to the substrate surface is restricted. As a consequence of a low Ri, the subsequent addition of HOAc to this reaction mixture facilitates the rapid reaction of unreacted Ti(OiPr)4 to produce aggregated particulates that stunt the growth of nanostructures at the substrate surface. Conversely, Ri > 2 favors the rapid hydrolysis of Ti(OiPr)4 resulting in large aggregated wire-like clusters that also lead to poorly covered FTO. In effect, values of Ri that deviate substantially from 1.3 lead to similar results; i.e., incomplete surface coverage and non-uniformity of TiO2 nanostructures.
Growth of nanowires: role of Rf
With the reaction conditions affording uniform surface coverage of the nucleation sites established, the effects of the subsequent acid addition (expressed by Rf) on the TiO2 film morphologies were investigated. Recall that Rf represents the molar ratio of HOAc to Ti(OiPr)4 over the entire reaction sequence. Experiments were carried out over the Rf = 1–20 range using substrates treated with 0.5 M NaOH and an Ri value of 1.3; the excess HOAc addition was delivered 10 min after the nucleation phase was initiated. SEM images of a representative film are presented in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  SEM images of TiO2 films obtained at Ri = 1.3 and Rf = 7. (a) Solution perturbation after nucleation and substrate addition; (b) solution is not stirred. Rf = 7 conditions were chosen to illustrate the densification of nanowire growth because at Rf > 8.5 a higher density of nanowires makes the changes in solution perturbation more difficult to distinguish. 
Inspection of the SEM images reveals that both the Rf value and stirring have a dramatic effect on the density and morphology of the TiO2 nanostructures. Reactions carried out at Rf ≤ 7 produce isolated islands of particulates on the FTO surface, whereas stirring affects the size and density of the islands (Fig. 6a). While stirring solutions over the Rf = 7–10 range improves surface coverage, a uniform bed of wires is not observed at Rf < 14. This observation is presumably because the perturbation of the solution reduces the residence time of the macromolecular precursors near the FTO surface. Poor surface coverage was observed at Rf = 20 (not shown), which indicates that a specific range of acid ratio is, indeed, required. The unperturbed solutions show a lower sensitivity to Rf value; i.e., a uniform coverage of nanowires is obtained within the Rf = 8.5–14 range. It was determined that the parameters Ri = 1.3 and Rf = 8.5–14, with no stirring after introduction of substrate, produced the best reaction conditions for nanowire nucleation and growth. A higher density of nanowires is observed at higher Rf values, presumably due to the static solution favoring the self-assembly of macromolecular precursors.
The importance of the volume of solvent on the formation of the nanostructured films was also examined by conducting a series of experiments where Ri = 1.3 and Rf = 14 using 0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mL of anhydrous heptane, respectively. This procedure was performed with stirring in order to maintain homogeneity of the reagents in solution. Representative images of sintered films are collected in Fig. S3, ESI†. Ideal wire growth was observed when the volume of heptane was set at 20–30 mL. Solvent volumes of less than 20 mL resulted in a collection of bundles of agglomerated wires and other particulates on the FTO surface. Excess heptane (> 30 mL) improves the dispersion of the wires, but also resulted in poor FTO surface coverage. Although the scale of the reaction likely dictates the optimum volume of heptane, the experiments in this study were all carried out in 20 mL of heptane for the sake of brevity.
Physical characterization
The nanowires grown from the substrate, as well as those grown concomitantly in the bulk phase of the reaction vessel, were evaluated by extensive electron microscopy and powder XRD experiments. TEM images of the bulk TiO2 nanowires at Ri = 1.3 and Rf > 8.5 reveal the amorphous nature of the linear macromolecules prior to annealing (Fig. 7a, inset), which is verified by powder XRD measurements. Sintering the smooth linear structures at 450 °C for 2 h results in anatase TiO2 nanowires with relatively uniform morphologies; e.g., widths of 54 ± 10 nm and lengths in excess of 1 μm (Fig. 7). The TEM images indicate that the nanowires are made up of anatase crystallites that are 16 ± 3 nm in diameter (Fig. 7a). The active surface area of the wires, which was determined by spectrophotometrically monitoring the adsorption of dye molecules to the TiO2 films, was measured to be 3 × 10−9 moles per cm2 – a value that is resonant with other low-density nanowire films.3,9

Powder XRD patterns were obtained for nanowires in the bulk phase (in the absence of an FTO substrate) over Rf = 5–14 to gain insight into the growth process. These materials display behavior that is consistent with the thin-film data (Fig. S4, ESI†): the nanowires are amorphous prior to sintering and take on the anatase form of TiO2 after calcination at 450 °C (characteristic diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ = 25.3°, 37.8°, and 48.0° corresponding to the (101), (004), and (200) crystal planes, respectively; Fig. 7a). Analysis of the most intense diffraction peak located at 2θ ≈ 25° (i.e., the anatase (101) diffraction peak) revealed that the average crystallite sizes were on the order of 11–12 nm (according to the Scherrer equation19), and sensitive to the Rf value. A plot of the average crystallite size versus Rf reveals a decreasing trend with a slope of −0.16 nm/Rf (not shown), while the relative intensities of the (004) and (200) diffraction peaks (located at 2θ = 37.8° and 48.0°, respectively) suggest anisotropic growth of the crystallites along the a and c axes on the basis that a higher ratio corresponds to axial growth.46 As a benchmark comparison, 20 nm spherical anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (Alfa Aesar 10 nm APS Powder, S.A. 100–130 m2 g−1) exhibit a (004) to (200) ratio of ∼0.52, while high aspect ratio nanowires have been shown to exhibit a (004) to (200) ratio of >0.70 (Fig. 8b).46 Analysis of materials produced at Rf = 5 reveals a (004) to (200) ratio of 0.69 indicating only a slight preference for crystallite growth along the c-axis; however, the (004) to (200) ratio is found to increase to 1.06 as Rf approaches 14. This feature indicates a preference for axial growth as Rf increases.

(b) Plot of the ratio of anatase (004) and (200) diffraction peaks indicating anisotropic growth along the c-axis of the crystallites. 
The crystalline phase of the TiO2 nanowires grown directly from the substrate were detached and characterized by HRTEM (Fig. 9). The selected-area electron-diffraction (SAED) ring patterns confirm that the nanowires are composed of polycrystalline anatase TiO2; i.e., the Debye–Scherrer concentric rings of (101), (004), (200), (105), (204), (220), and (215) planes in Fig. 9a match the atomic spacing of the anatase crystal lattice. Powder XRD techniques also corroborated the anatase crystalline phase of the films on the surface of the FTO slides based on the observation of 2θ = 25.3° and 48.0° diffraction peaks arising from the (101) and (200) crystal planes.

Conclusions
This study establishes the conditions necessary to grow anatase TiO2 nanowires from the surface of transparent conducting FTO glass substrates. The procedure presented herein requires base pretreatment of the substrate to facilitate nucleation and growth of nanostructures on the surface. While nanowire growth is sensitive to a number of factors, we tentatively assign a growth mechanism that requires, as a first step, the binding of Ti-oxide molecular clusters to the base-treated surface. A series of subsequent hydrolysis steps facilitate the axial growth of linear macromolecules normal to the plane of the FTO crystal faces. The linear nature of these structures is retained after calcination resulting in a thin film of anatase TiO2 nanowires tethered to the FTO surface. Extensive imaging and XRD diffraction studies reveal that the nanowires consist of a collection of anisotropic crystallites that exhibit a preference for axial growth.
The relative quantities of HOAc and Ti(OiPr)4 appear to govern the nucleation and growth processes. While we have found that there is a strong correlation of nucleation to Ri and growth to Rf, there is clearly interplay between the two parameters. Of the reaction conditions explored in this investigation, the best anatase TiO2 films were achieved at Ri = 1.3 and Rf = 8.5–14. Films produced at Ri ≠ 1.3 led to poor coverage of FTO by TiO2 nanostructures regardless of Rf value. While the wire morphology was similar over the Rf = 8.5 − 14 range, the XRD data indicate that a higher Rf value enhances the anisotropy of the crystallites. Lower quality films were obtained at Rf = 20, thereby indicating the relationship between Rf value, crystallite anisotropy and film quality should be considered in the further development of this chemistry. Studies are currently underway to examine how other molecular precursors affect the growth of these wires, as well as an investigation defining the electrical properties of this class of materials.
Experimental
Materials
Materials Ti(OiPr)4 (97%), AcOH (99.7%) and anhydrous heptane (99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. FTO glass substrates (F:SnO2; Tec 8; 8 Ω cm−2) were purchased from the Hartford Glass Company. All manipulations were carried out under ambient atmosphere unless otherwise specified.
Preparation of substrates
FTO glass substrates approximately 2 cm × 2 cm in size were subject to consecutive ultrasonic treatments in Alconox® detergent for 15 min, deionized H2O for 5 min, and ethanol for 15 min. The substrates were exposed to UV light and O3(g) for 15 min, and then submerged in 0.5 M NaOH(aq) overnight. The substrates were removed from the solution, air dried for 15 min, and used immediately.
Preparation of TiO2 nanostructures on FTO Glass
Base functionalized FTO substrate was placed in a dry 50 mL round bottom flask charged with 20 mL of anhydrous heptane and heated to 60 °C. To the flask was added stepwise 1.30–1.68 mL of HOAc (23.0–29.2 mmol; Ri = 1–1.3) and 6.75 mL of Ti(OiPr)4 (22.0 mmol) (Table S1, ESI†). After the reaction flask was left to stand for 10 min, 4.90–17.0 ml of HOAc (92.0–296.0 mmol; Rf = 5–14) was added followed by gentle stirring until the solution became translucent. After the reagents were stirred for 10 min, the magnetic stirrer was stopped (in some experiments; refer to Table S1 for details†) and the reaction mixture was left to stand at 60 °C to facilitate gelation (4 h) and aging (2 d). The substrates were then dried under reduced pressure for 12 h, blown free of debris using compressed air and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h (ramp rate of 5 °C min−1).
Dye loading studies
The TiO2 films were immersed in a 1.0 M EtOH solution of the Ru(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)2(NCS)2 (Solaronix) for 12 h. The dye was then desorbed from the TiO2 film by soaking for 30 min in 1.0 M NaOH. The absorbance band at ca. 500 nm was used to determine the amount of desorbed dye against a calibration curve ranging from 6.0 × 10−5 M to 6.0 × 10−8 M in 1.0 M NaOH.
Physical methods
UV-ozone treatment of the glass substrates was carried out using a PSD-UVO3 (Novascan Technologies) system. The powder XRD patterns of the films were recorded using a Rigaku MiniFlex II Desktop diffractometer (scan speed = 2.000° min−1, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å). Morphological and lattice structural information were examined by tungsten-filament SEM (FEI XL 30, accelerating voltage 20 kV) and tungsten-filament TEM (Hitachi H7650, AMT 16000 digital camera, accelerating voltage 80 kV). SEM imaging of cross sections was performed on a Hitachi S4800 with an accelerating voltage of 30 kV. HRTEM imaging and SAED patterns were collected on an FEI Tecnai F20 FEG TEM using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Contact mode AFM was performed on a Molecular Imaging PicoSPM instrument with a scan rate of 0.25 Hz. Samples for cross-sectional TEM imaging were embedded in an EPON resin mixture and cured at 60 °C, trimmed for sectioning (70–90 nm, Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome with a diamond knife) and collected on single-hole grids with Formvar supporting film. Alternatively, TEM samples were prepared by detaching the TiO2 nanowires from the substrate and transferred to a holey carbon TEM grid.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Nanostructured film architectures.	 

 	Fig. 2  Distorted octahedron (a) edge-sharing and octahedron (b) corner-sharing atomic arrangements in the solid-state for the anatase and rutile forms of TiO2, respectively.39	 

 	Fig. 3  Reaction steps outlining the formation of anatase TiO2 nanowires from a substrate: (a) formation of Ti-oxide nucleation sites (affected by Ri); (b) growth of linear Ti-oxide macromolecules (affected by Rf); (c) gelation.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM images of anatase TiO2 nanowire films obtained at Ri value 1.3, Rf = 14 (scotch taped surface).	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Plan-view SEM and cross-sectional FE-SEM (inset) images of TiO2 films prior to wire growth highlighting a uniform film of nucleation sites. (b) Cross-sectional FE-SEM images of TiO2 nanowire films at Ri = 1.3 and Rf = 8.5; the thickness of the film is ∼5 μm.	 

 	Fig. 6  SEM images of TiO2 films obtained at Ri = 1.3 and Rf = 7. (a) Solution perturbation after nucleation and substrate addition; (b) solution is not stirred. Rf = 7 conditions were chosen to illustrate the densification of nanowire growth because at Rf > 8.5 a higher density of nanowires makes the changes in solution perturbation more difficult to distinguish.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) TEM image of anatase TiO2 nanowires generated in the bulk phase before (inset) and after calcination. (b) Powder XRD pattern of anatase TiO2 nanowires (bulk phase). Vertical bars represent the standard diffraction pattern of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272).	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of bulk anatase TiO2 nanowires obtained at varying Rf values (Ri = 1.3). The diffraction pattern for 20 nm spherical anatase TiO2 nanoparticles is provided for comparison. (b) Plot of the ratio of anatase (004) and (200) diffraction peaks indicating anisotropic growth along the c-axis of the crystallites.	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) SAED diffraction pattern and corresponding HRTEM image (inset) of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals (Ri = 1.3, Rf = 14). (b) Higher magnification HRTEM image of a crystallite and its fast fourier transform (inset) highlighting the anatase diffraction pattern.
