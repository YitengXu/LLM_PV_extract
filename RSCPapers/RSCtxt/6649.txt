    , Accepted 5th August 2015First published on 19th August 2015AbstractWe herein report a novel noble-metal-free photocatalytic H2-production system by immobilizing CdS nanocrystals on ultrathin Co0.85Se/graphene nanosheets. The well-designed composite material was prepared by a simple solvothermal method and achieved a dramatically enhanced H2-evolution performance when compared with other bulk counterparts. Under optimal conditions, the H2-evolution efficiency can reach up to 17.60 μmol mg−1 h−1 after 10 h of LED visible light irradiation, which is comparable to that of noble Pt nanoparticles (18.60 μmol mg−1 h−1). It is proposed that the unusual catalytic rate arises from the special nanostructure of Co0.85Se and a positive synergetic effect between Co0.85Se and graphene. The results show that the ultrathin Co0.85Se which possesses a half-metallic character is a promising noble-metal-free cocatalyst for practical photocatalytic hydrogen production application.
Introduction
Conversion of solar energy to renewable hydrogen fuel has been considered as one of the promising strategies to meet the growing energy demands in modern society.1–4 Over the past two decades, various conventional semiconductor photocatalysts, such as TiO2,5 ZnO,6,7 CdS,8,9 C3N4 (ref. 10 and 11) and so on, have been widely developed for solar water splitting and achieved enormous progress. However, their efficiency is limited and there are a lot of hurdles awaiting to be overcome.12 It is anticipated that semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) with a quantum confinement effect may offer potential solutions to modify the disadvantages of bulk materials.13 Firstly, NCs have superior light absorption efficiency and photostability.14 Secondly, the band gap of NCs can be readily tuned by controlling the particle size, which leads to favourable thermodynamic potential for photocatalytic water splitting.15 Furthermore, a shorter transportation path for delivering electrons can be achieved in the minimal structure.16 For all the above reasons, heterostructures combining NCs with various cocatalysts, such as Pt and Pd, have been extensively studied and achieved optimal hydrogen production efficiency.17,18 However, noble metals do not meet the global energy demand and exploring alternative cocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements has been considered as the state-of-the-art in this field.19–27 For instance, Han et al. reported a robust hybrid system assembled from CdSe NCs and Ni2+ in acidic aqueous solution and showed predominant photocatalytic H2-evolution under visible light irradiation.28 Li et al. demonstrated that an assembly of Coh-CdTe NCs also possessed excellent photocatalytic efficiency.29 Therefore, a broad application of adopting high quality NCs in photocatalytic systems to achieve enhanced photocatalytic performance is viewed.30,31
Apart from the in situ formed cocatalysts, a variety of noble-metal-free cocatalysts, such as MoS2,32 NiS,33 Ni(OH)2,34 and Ni2P,35 have been widely explored and optimized. However, in order to realize practical application, developing novel materials and improving the present systems are still urgent. Cobalt selenide (e.g. CoSe2) has mainly been applied in the fields of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,36 water oxidation,37 dye-sensitized solar cells,38 oxygen reduction reactions,39 hydrazine hydrate decomposition40 and so on. Nevertheless, the use of cobalt selenide as a cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production was seldom investigated. Very recently, Ullah et al. constructed a bulk CoSe2/TiO2 photocatalyst for water reduction.41 However, the efficiency was quite modest and the UV light source was employed which only accounts for 4% of the solar spectrum. Therefore, increasing the photocatalytic rate of cobalt selenide is still critical.
Morphology optimization is one of the most effective approaches to improve the efficiency of catalysts.42–44 Graphene, which is an excellent two-dimensional (2D) material with only a single layer of graphite, has attracted much attention due to its high specific surface area, outstanding charge carrier mobility and excellent chemical stability.45 Furthermore, the facilely modified surface makes it a desired matrix to synthesize various kinds of foreign materials.46 Herein, we employed polyethyleneimine (PEI) modified graphene oxide (GO) as a template to obtain ultrathin Co0.85Se nanosheets, which not only achieved a larger surface for photocatalyst loading, but also provided sufficient reduction sites for water reduction. In this work, CdS NCs are chosen as a photocatalyst because of the merits of easy preparation and relatively high quantum efficiency. Consequently, a robust photocatalytic H2-evolution system is established by introducing the well-designed Co0.85Se/reduced GO–PEI (Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI) as a cocatalyst, CdS NRs as a photocatalyst and L(+)-lactic acid as an electron donor. It is worth noting that the PEI modified RGO not only contributes to the formation of ultrathin Co0.85Se nanosheets but also plays a role of an electron transfer layer between CdS and Co0.85Se, which leads to enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.
Experimental section
Sample preparation
All materials were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Cadmium chloride hydrate CdCl2·H2O, sulphur, cobalt acetate tetrahydrate Co(OAC)2·4H2O, ethylene glycol and sodium selenite Na2SeO3 were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Oleylamine, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI, MW. 70000, 50 wt% aq. solution) were purchased from Alfa Aesar.
Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by chemical oxidation according to the Hummers' method and dehydrated by freeze-drying.47 To synthesize PEI modified RGO–PEI, 50 mg obtained GO and 50 mg PEI were dispersed in 50 mL deionized water and stirred magnetically at 60 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, the RGO–PEI product was isolated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and freeze-dried for the next step reaction.
A one-pot method was used to synthesize Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI nanosheets. RGO–PEI (10 mg) and Co(OAC)2·4H2O (25 mg) were dispersed in 25 mL ethylene glycol and sonicated for another 30 min. After that, 25 mg Na2SeO3 was added into the mixture and heated to 180 °C for 6 h under an Ar atmosphere. The prepared Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI nanosheets were washed with water and ethanol three times and dried in a vacuum oven. For comparison, Co0.85Se/PEI, Co0.85Se/GO and pure Co0.85Se were synthesized following a similar procedure but in the absence of GO, PEI or both, respectively. The weight percentage of Co0.85Se in the final product was detected by ICP-AES.
Water soluble spherical CdS NCs were synthesized by a two-step process according to the reported method with slight modification.48 In a typical procedure, 402 mg CdCl2·H2O was dissolved in 25 mL oleylamine and heated to 90 °C for 1 h, which was purged in prior with argon for 20 min. Then, 32 mg sulphur was dissolved in 5 mL oleylamine and injected into the above solution. The mixture was heated to 160 °C and kept for another 6 h. After the reaction was cooled to room temperature, acetone (30 mL) was added to form a yellow precipitation, which can be separated by centrifugation. The obtained CdS NCs were further transferred to water soluble NCs by capping ligand exchange. 1.2 mL MPA was dissolved in 10 mL methanol and the pH was adjusted to 10.0 by using NaOH solution (0.5 M). Then, 100 mg obtained CdS NCs were dissolved in 20 mL n-hexane solution and added to the methanol solution. The mixture was heated to 60 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed by evaporation and the product was washed with ethanol.
The CdS/Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI hybrid was prepared by mixing different ratios of CdS NCs and Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI, which was sonicated in 10 mL H2O for 1 h and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The obtained hybrid was used directly for photocatalytic reactions without further processing.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å). The morphology, lattice fringe, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses were performed by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM 2100F) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed by using a PHI 5300 ESCA system. An Al Kα X-ray source with a power of 250 W was used. The charge effect was calibrated using the binding energy of C 1s (250.0 eV). The concentrations of Co0.85Se were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Varian 710-ES, USA). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were conducted by using a scanning probe microscope (SPM, Bruker Multimode 8). Electrochemical impedance analyses were carried out on a Shanghai Chenhua Model CHI660C instrument in a conventional three-electrode system with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The samples were spread on ITO glasses as working electrodes using Nafion (0.5%) aqueous solution.
Theoretical calculations
The present first-principles calculations were performed by the plane-wave pseudopotential method49 implemented in the simulation package CASTEP50 based on density functional theory (DFT).51 The ion–electron interactions are modeled by the ultrasoft pseudopotentials.52 In this model, Co 3d74s2 and Se 4s24p4 electrons are treated as the valence electrons, respectively. In order to better describe the 3d electron-states of Co atoms, the LDA + U density functional method was adopted for the calculations of electronic structures.53 The value of an additional on-site orbital-dependent correlation Hubbard U for Co 3d electrons is set at 6.0 eV. The kinetic energy cut-off of 360 eV and Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes of 0.04 per Å3 in the Brillouin zone were chosen.54
Photocatalytic activity measurements
The photocatalytic hydrogen-production experiments were performed in a 60 mL quartz tube sealed with a silicone rubber septum. A white LED (30 × 3 W, λ > 420 nm, Fig. S1†) was used as the irradiation light source and all the experiments were performed at room temperature. In a typical experiment, 5 mg CdS/Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI hybrid and 3 mL L(+)-lactic acid were added to a tube and the total volume of the mixed solution was adjusted to 15 mL with distilled water. The system was deoxygenated with argon for 30 min. The samples were positioned 2 cm away from the LED lights and the mixture was continuously kept stirring during irradiation. The produced hydrogen was measured by using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu, with argon as a carrier gas), which was equipped with a 5 Å molecular sieve column (3 m × 2 mm) and a thermal-conductivity detector. The number of incident photons was 1.36 × 1017 photons per s which was measured by using an irradiance meter. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated according to the equation below:  
Results and discussion
Powder XRD tests were carried out to characterize the prepared samples. The pure GO displays a strong peak at around 2θ = 11°, which belongs to the (001) reflection (Fig. S2†). After modification with PEI, the GO peak weakened dramatically, indicating that GO was reduced by PEI under the hydrothermal conditions, consistent with the literature report55 (Fig. S3†). This is due to the fact that the amine groups on PEI could readily react with carboxyl groups on GO, which results in reduced graphene (RGO–PEI). It is well known that RGO has superior conductivity characterization to GO. Thereby, the modification of GO with PEI has a double advantage. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, three characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.3°, 44.7° and 50.6° were perceived for the Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI sample, which match well with the (101), (102) and (110) reflections of the standard hexagonal phase of Co0.85Se (JCPDS no. 52-1008). Notably, the signals of RGO are not discernible in this situation owing to its poor reflection. On account of the large particle sizes, the bulk pure Co0.85Se and Co0.85Se/GO showed better crystallinity with six recognizable peaks located at 2θ = 33.3°, 44.7°, 50.6° 60.4°, 61.9° and 69.9° corresponding to the (101), (102), (110) (103), (112) and (202) reflections (Fig. S4 and S5†), whereas, because of the existence of the surface capping agent of PEI, the Co0.85Se/PEI particles also have weaker XRD reflection peaks (Fig. S6†). The Co0.85Se peak almost disappeared after CdS NCs loading (Fig. S7†). The diffraction peaks at 26.5°, 44.0°, and 52.1° match well with the main (111), (220) and (311) reflections of cubic CdS (JCPDS no. 65-2887). This phenomenon correlates well with the previous reports. It is supposed that the ultrathin and small amount of Co0.85Se have relatively poor crystallinity compared with CdS NCs.56

XPS measurements were further utilized to identify the chemical composition of the obtained samples. Fig. S8† shows the XPS survey spectra of GO, RGO–PEI and Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI. The results indicate that the significant content of N was doped for RGO–PEI and confirm that GO was successfully modified by PEI (Fig. S8a and c†). Moreover, from the C 1s spectrum of GO, an oxidation peak of C–O at 287.2 eV can be obviously observed. However, the oxidation signal is ignorable in the RGO–PEI sample, which further illustrates that GO was successfully translated into the reduced state (Fig. S8b†). For Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI samples, other than the appearance of the expected N element, a large amount of Co and Se elements were also detected, which supports that Co0.85Se was successfully loaded on the RGO–PEI substrate (Fig. S8c–e†). Furthermore, the percentages of surface atoms on the related samples were calculated by XPS and are summarized in Fig. S8f.† For the N atoms, the percentage values were 0.42, 17.02 and 10.32 for GO, RGO–PEI and Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI, respectively. That is to say that the surface of GO was modified greatly by PEI. The calculated ratio of Co to Se is 0.82 in the sample of Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI, which is close to the expected value.
All the prepared samples were characterized by TEM. The results display that there are negligible morphological changes for GO after modification with PEI, in which the pendent amino groups provide abundant anchored sites for Co2+ ion coordination (Fig. S9†). After loading Co0.85Se, the hybrid still retains the original ultrathin morphology as evidenced by visual inspection of the TEM image (Fig. 2a). When detected by HRTEM, it can be clearly observed that a layer of Co0.85Se was uniformly grown on the surface of RGO–PEI (Fig. 2b). The lattice spacing of 0.26 nm is also clearly demonstrated in the HRTEM image, which corresponds to the [101] plane of Co0.85Se. The selected EDXS data further confirm the existence of C, O, N, Co and Se elements for Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI (Fig. 2c). The Cu and parts of C and O signals come from the carbon-coated copper grid substrate. In addition, the corresponding SAED pattern depicts three main bright rings, which belong to the (101), (102) and (110) reflections, respectively, and match well with the XRD signals (Fig. 2d).

AFM images offered solid evidence on the formation of ultrathin Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI samples. As depicted in Fig. S10,† the thickness of pure graphene was about 1 nm and after Co0.85Se loading, the thickness was increased to 5–10 nm. It means that the Co0.85Se nanosheets have a thickness of less than 10 nm. By contrast, bulk and agglomerate Co0.85Se particles were formed when there is a lack of either GO or PEI. As shown in Fig. S11 and S12,† large particles of hundreds of nanometers in diameter and nearly 30 nm thickness were formed on the surface of GO in the absence of PEI (Co0.85Se/GO). For Co0.85Se/PEI and Co0.85Se, serious aggregation occurs with a diameter of ∼200 nm and 1000 nm, and a thickness of ∼80 nm and 500 nm, respectively (Fig. S13–S16†). Therefore, both GO and PEI played critical roles in optimizing the morphology of Co0.85Se. In addition, it can be clearly perceived from the TEM image that the ultrathin Co0.85Se nanosheets supply sufficient surfaces to support CdS NCs (Fig. S17†) and the close contact between different components of CdS, Co0.85Se and RGO could effectively promote the electron transfer efficiency and thus improve the photocatalytic H2-production rate.
The H2-photocatalytic evolution of CdS/Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI using L(+)-lactic acid (20 vol%) as an electron donor was evaluated under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) at room temperature. The H2-production efficiency was dependent on the amount of Co0.85Se (Fig. 3a). The highest efficiency was achieved when 5 wt% Co0.85Se was loaded at a fixed amount of total 5 mg catalyst. 882 μmol H2 was obtained after 10 h of visible light irradiation with an excellent photocatalytic rate as high as 17.60 μmol mg−1 h−1 and the corresponding quantum yield was 21.7%. Neither higher nor lower loading amounts could obtain the optimal efficiency. It is presumable that small ratios of cocatalysts cannot provide sufficient catalytic sites for water reduction, whereas light-absorption efficiency of CdS could be blocked when higher amounts of black Co0.85Se existed. Similar phenomena have been observed in other reported systems.57 Control experiments showed that all of the components (CdS, Co0.85Se, L(+)-lactic acid and light) were essential for effective hydrogen production (Fig. S18†). In order to evaluate the photocatalytic efficiency of the well-designed ultrathin Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI cocatalyst, classical noble metal Pt nanoparticles were chosen for the comparison. However, the CdS/Pt sample shows much lower photocatalytic efficiency when the loading amount of Pt is 5.0 wt% and the optimized loading value of Pt is 0.1 wt% with a H2-evolution rate of 18.60 μmol mg−1 h−1 (Fig. S19†). Therefore, the results indicate that the photocatalytic efficiency of the CdS/Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI hybrid is comparable to that of the noble Pt/CdS system and that is to say, the ultrathin Co0.85Se/GO–PEI can serve as a cheaper alternative catalyst to replace Pt nanoparticles. By contrast, the bulk Co0.85Se/GO, Co0.85Se/PEI and Co0.85Se samples exhibit much lower efficiency with respect to Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI. As depicted in Fig. 3b, rates of 6.02 μmol mg−1 h−1, 5.06 μmol mg−1 h−1 and 3.90 μmol mg−1 h−1 were obtained for CdS/Co0.85Se/GO, CdS/Co0.85Se/PEI and CdS/Co0.85Se systems, respectively. The enhanced catalytic efficiency can be attributed to the ultrathin Co0.85Se distributed on RGO, which has a much higher surface area and provides plenty of active photocatalytic sites for reduction reactions. Furthermore, it is notable that CdS NCs can be readily loaded on the surface of Co0.85Se, which is beneficial to conduct effective electron transfer between CdS NCs and Co0.85Se. Moreover, the graphene sheets, known as conductive electron transfer highways, could effectively improve the interfacial charge transfer and be beneficial for Co0.85Se to accept electrons from CdS and RGO. From the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 4), it can be obviously observed that the semicircle is much shorter for Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI than pure Co0.85Se. This result indicated that the interface layer resistance and the charge transfer resistance on the surface of the Co0.85Se apparently decreased after introducing RGO.58 Therefore, it is evident that RGO in the Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI hybrid plays an effective role in transferring electrons between different components for H2-production. Herein, it is reasonable that the synergetic effect between CdS NCs, Co0.85Se nanosheets and RGO leads to the noticeable improvement of water reduction reactions.

(c) Photocatalytic stability test for CdS/Co0.85Se (5 wt%)/RGO–PEI, 5 mg CdS NCs and 1 mL LA were added at the indicated time. All the experiments are conducted in 15 mL aqueous solution containing 3 mL L(+)-lactic acid and 5 mg hybrid photocatalyst.

Other than high photocatalytic activity, long-term stability is another significant parameter to evaluate the practicability of photocatalysts. The stability of the CdS/Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI hybrid was further investigated under visible light irradiation using 3 mL L(+)-lactic acid as an electron donor. Fig. 3c indicates that the system continues to produce hydrogen at an effective efficiency for over 50 h and no obvious change can be perceived from XRD patterns before and after irradiation (Fig. S20a†). From the TEM image, it seems that the CdS NRs agglomerated to larger particles after irradiation. However, it should be noted that the structure of Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI is still maintained after 50 h of irradiation (Fig. S20b†). After adding appropriate CdS NCs and LA, the rate dramatically increased to the initial value, which demonstrated that the cocatalyst of Co0.85Se remained stable and the decreased efficiency might be on account of the photocorrosion of CdS NCs and oxidation of LA to pyruvic acid.33,35 It is notable that 1109 μmol mg−1 H2 was obtained after 105 h of irradiation and manifested that Co0.85Se nanosheets can be introduced as a robust cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2-evolution under acidic conditions.
XPS experiments were carried out to examine the characteristics of Co0.85Se. As revealed in Fig. 5a, the peak located at 778.5 eV can be assigned to the Co 2p3/2 species in Co0.85 Se, which is slightly positively shifted to metallic Co (777.9–778.2 eV).59,60 The peak at 781.2 eV is assigned to the oxidized cobalt due to air contact. The binding energies located at 55.3 and 54.5 eV belong to the Se 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 signals with some negative shift compared with elemental Se (3d3/2 55.7 eV and 3d5/2 54.9 eV) (Fig. 5b).61 Therefore, it can be presumed that the character of Co0.85Se resembles that of the transition metal phosphides (e.g. Ni2P,35 CoP,57 and Co2P62) reported. There is small electron density transfer from Co (δ+) to Se (δ−), which serves as electron and proton acceptance sites for hydrogen production, respectively.57 Apart from having the charge transfer characteristics, Co0.85Se also possesses similar properties of zero-valent metals. To further verify this, theoretical studies of DFT were introduced to clarify the electronic structure of Co0.85Se.63,64 As depicted in Fig. 6, the total and partial densities of states (DOS/PDOS) confirmed that the Co0.85Se possesses a half-metallic character resembling that of the reported CoSe2.63 It is found that there is strong hybridization between the Co 3d and Se 4p spin-up (alpha) electrons, whereas a bandgap exists for the spin-down (beta) electrons, which indicated the half-metallic characterization of Co0.85Se. In addition, based on the calculated band structure of Co0.85Se, there is an overlap between the alpha electrons, whereas a bandgap for beta electrons with nearly 0.57 eV can be observed close to the Fermi level, which further indicates typical half-metallic characteristics (Fig. S21†). Herein, it can be speculated that the half-metallic behaviour of Co0.85Se can significantly promote electron transportation in the photocatalyst; that is, the photogenerated electrons of CdS can be easily transferred to the reduction sites of Co0.85Se and used for hydrogen production. The proposed mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 7.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a robust photocatalytic H2-evolution system was well designed using ultrathin Co0.85Se/RGO–PEI nanosheets as a cocatalyst for CdS NCs and L(+)-lactic acid as an electron donor. The optimized ultrathin Co0.85Se nanosheets showed dramatically enhanced photocatalytic efficiency compared with other counterpart Co0.85Se particles possessing different morphologies. The PEI modified GO not only plays a role of a template to obtain ultrathin Co0.85Se nanosheets, but also acts as highways for electron transfer between CdS NRs and cocatalysts. Therefore, it is believed that the positive synergetic effect between Co0.85Se, graphene and PEI gives rise to highly efficient photocatalytic activity. Under optimal conditions, the H2-production rate can reach up to 17.60 μmol mg−1 h−1 after 10 h of LED visible light irradiation, which is comparable to that of the noble Pt/CdS system. Moreover, Co0.85Se exhibits outstanding photocatalytic stability in acidic solution and 1109 μmol mg−1 H2 was obtained after 105 h of irradiation. This study showed that the Co0.85Se, which contains noble-metal-free elements and possesses a half-metallic character, can act as a highly active cocatalyst for photocatalytic water reduction reactions and it sheds more light on designing ultrathin and novel photocatalysts with abundant active sites.
