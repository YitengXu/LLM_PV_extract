    , Accepted 11th January 2019First published on 14th January 2019AbstractA novel p-type organic semiconductor (p-OS), P2TBR, based on a non-fused ring structure of thiophene–benzene–thiophene (TBT) as the core and 2D-conjugated benzodithiophene (BDT) units as π spacers and 3-ethylrhodanines as terminal groups, was synthesized and used as the donor material for all-small-molecule organic solar cells (SM-OSCs). P2TBR shows strong absorption, a low-lying HOMO energy level, high hole mobility and good thermal stability. The optimized P2TBR:IDIC film exhibits face-on and edge-on co-existent texture and three dimensional (3D) charge pathway, which is far better than the face-on orientated blend film without any treatment. As a result, a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.5% and a satisfactory fill factor (FF) of 70.1% are achieved. This efficiency is the highest PCE for non-fullerene SM-OSCs reported in the literature so far. Overall, the results indicate that P2TBR is a promising candidate p-OS donor material for use in SM-OSCs, and the molecular design strategy for P2TBR provides the possibility that the simple-structured and easy to chemically modify non-fused unit can also be used as a building block in high performance p-OS donors.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures have attracted remarkable attention because of certain inherent advantages, including their easy fabrication, simple device structure, low cost, and capability to be fabricated into lightweight, semitransparent and flexible devices.1–8 In BHJ-OSCs, the photoactive layer is made of the blend of a conjugated polymer or p-type organic semiconductor (p-OS) as the donor and fullerene derivatives or an n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as the acceptor. Following on from the widely investigated fullerene derivatives,9–13 a series of n-OS acceptors with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure have been developed and synthesized because of their easily tuned energy levels, wide and strong light absorption and diverse chemical structures.8,14,15 And these non-fullerene OSCs show efficient charge generation with small driving energies, resulting in high photocurrent and low voltage losses at the same time.16–27 Consequently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) higher than 14% have been achieved in these non-fullerene OSCs.28–31 The n-OS acceptors based on a fused-ring electron-donating core along with two strongly electron-withdrawing end-groups have become dominant electron acceptor materials in high efficiency single-junction OSCs. The planar ring-fused non-fullerene acceptor IDIC is one of the notable n-OS acceptors, and high PCEs of over 11% (ref. 32–34) were realized in IDIC-based polymer solar cells (PSCs). Besides, IDIC was also used in non-fullerene all-small-molecule organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) with a p-OS as the donor and an n-OS as the acceptor and achieved excellent PCEs.35–38
Small molecules possess advantages of well-defined molecular weight, easy purification and small batch-to-batch variation, which give good reproducibility in device performance and provide reliable analyses of the molecular properties and device performance relationship. Besides, small molecules have a lower viscosity and better structural order that can be used to manipulate the active layer morphology and performance.5 Therefore, solution-processed p-OS (or called organic small molecules) donor materials have also attracted great attention. Significant progress has been made with small molecule donors, and OSCs with efficiencies over 10% were realized when they were blended with fullerene acceptor materials.12,39–41 Naturally, researchers would think to investigate SM-OSCs in order to take advantage of both p-OS and n-OS. For example, Hou et al. reported a wide bandgap molecule, DRTB-T, with an alkylthienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) trimer as the central unit and 3-ethylrhodanines as the end-capping groups; the DRTB-T:IDIC-based SM-OSCs obtained a PCE as high as 9.1%.35 Then they designed a group of model compounds to demonstrate that the length of the end alkyl chain has great influence on the molecular orientation and photovoltaic performance; a top PCE of up to 11.24% was achieved with a DRTB-T-C4:IT-4F-based device, which is the highest value reported for SM-OSCs at that time.42 Li et al. reported a series of wide bandgap small molecules based on benzodithiophene and ethyl cyanoacetic acid ester, H11,36 BDT(TVT-SR)2,43 SM1,37 and H22.38 Upon fine-tuning the π bridge unit and conjugated side chain of BDT, they all exhibited excellent photovoltaic performance, and the PCEs are 9.73%, 11.1%, 10.11% and 10.29%, respectively, when they were blended with IDIC to construct SM-OSCs. The structures of these small molecule donors are listed in Fig. S1 in the ESI† and their photovoltaic data are shown in Table S1 in the ESI.† However, the PCEs of these SM-OSCs are still lower than those of non-fullerene PSCs, and so continued efforts should be made to design and synthesize a suitable p-OS donor to combine with an n-OS acceptor to construct a high efficiency all-small-molecule system.
Considering various donor materials for solution processed OSCs with high photovoltaic performance, BDT is a promising building block for both polymers and small molecules due to its symmetric and planar conjugated structure.11,13,27,31,44–49 In addition, the small molecules containing BDT as the central building block also set new PCE records for SM-OSCs (Table S1, ESI†).35–37,42,43 Therefore, the structure of BDT is chosen as a bridge to design a new small molecule donor material, which is different from previous ones (Fig. S1, ESI†). The small molecules with non-fused ring structures exhibited good chain planarity and crystalline intermolecular organizations in films because of their non-covalent interaction, which is beneficial to the charge transfer and transmission.50–52 Besides, the non-fused ring structure is very simple and can be synthesized easily, and the corresponding small molecules show easily adjustable absorption spectra, molecular energy levels, and charge mobility by simple chemical modification.53 3-Ethylrhodanine has been widely used as a capping moiety to expand the conjugation and enhance the electron-accepting ability of small molecule donors, which makes it an efficient unit for high-performance OSCs.35,54 The presence of the ethyl group not only inhibits the hydrogen bonding associated with the non-alkylated rhodanine, but also increases the solubility.
Based on the analysis mentioned above, we designed and synthesized a new small molecule, P2TBR, with thiophene-2,5-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzene-thiophene (TBT) as the central building block, 2D-conjugated benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units as π spacers and 3-ethylrhodanines as terminal groups. P2TBR possesses good solubility in common solvents and good thermal stability, which is beneficial for device fabrication. IDIC having complementary absorption and matched energy levels with P2TBR was chosen as the acceptor for the SM-OSCs with P2TBR as the donor. After fine tuning the morphology of the active layer with solvent vapor annealing (SVA), the SM-OSCs demonstrated an outstanding PCE of 11.5%, with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 17.5 mA cm−2, and a satisfactory fill factor (FF) of 70.1%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 11.5% is the highest value for non-fullerene SM-OSCs reported to date.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and properties of P2TBR
The structure of the p-OS donor P2TBR is shown in Fig. 1a, and the synthetic route is displayed in Fig. 1b. Compounds 1 and 2 were prepared according to the reported literature.35,55,56 The intermediate compound P2TBR-CHO was synthesized through the Stille coupling reaction between compounds 1 and 2 using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. Then a typical Knoevenagel condensation reaction of P2TBR-CHO with 3-ethylrhodanines afforded the target organic small molecule P2TBR. Detailed synthesis procedures are described in the ESI.† The chemical structure of P2TBR was characterized using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MALDI-TOF, and elemental analysis techniques shown in the ESI.† The synthesized P2TBR exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at room temperature, which is beneficial for the device fabrication. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that P2TBR possesses good thermal stability with a thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of 390 °C with 5% weight loss.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to obtain the properties of P2TBR at the molecular electronic energy levels. The optimized molecular conformations and wavefunction distributions of the frontier orbitals of P2TBR are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The electron density distributions at the LUMO are localized on the entire molecule with higher density at the end groups, while the electron density distributions at the HOMO are highly localized on the central core units. The BDT unit and terminal 3-ethylrhodanine moieties form a nearly flat plane and the dihedral angle is 0.81°, and the central TBT and BDT units exhibit a dihedral angle of 6.03°. The small dihedral angle means the small molecule P2TBR exhibits a highly coplanar conjugated backbone structure, which should be favorable for the π–π stacking and charge transport. P2TBR shows a relatively high hole mobility of 2.21 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S4a, ESI†), which was measured via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.57
Absorption spectra and electronic energy levels

Fig. 2a shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of P2TBR in diluted chloroform (CHCl3) solution and film. In solution, P2TBR exhibits absorption in the range of 300–620 nm with a maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 543 nm. In thin films, the λmax peak is red-shifted to 554 nm and a strong electronic vibration shoulder peak appeared at 594 nm, which is ascribed to the π–π* transition due to strong intermolecular π–π interactions in the solid state.35 The optical band gap (Eoptg) of P2TBR estimated from absorption onset (644 nm) is 1.93 eV, which is calculated from the equation Eoptg = 1240/λonset. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted to investigate the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of P2TBR. From the CV plot in Fig. 2b, the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined to be −5.36 eV and −3.64 eV, respectively. The electronic energy levels of P2TBR as a p-OS donor match well with those of the n-OS acceptor IDIC (Fig. 2b), which should be able to afford enough driving force for charge separation.

Photovoltaic performance
IDIC possesses strong absorption between 500 and 800 nm, a suitable LUMO energy level (−3.91 eV), and a high electron mobility of about 1.10 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.58 Thus, the combination of the p-OS P2TBR donor and the n-OS IDIC acceptor can afford broad absorption spectra and appropriate molecular energy levels, which are two key factors for realizing the efficient harvest of sunlight and the generation of free charges. BHJ all-small-molecule solar cells were fabricated with a conventional configuration of indium tin oxide, (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P2TBR:IDIC/ZnO/Al, and characterized to investigate the photovoltaic performance of P2TBR. Chloroform was employed as the processing solvent, and the total concentration of the donor and the acceptor was 14 mg mL−1 with a donor:acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of 1:1. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 3a and b, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The as-cast devices showed inferior performance: a Voc of 1.00 V, Jsc of 6.7 mA cm−2, FF of 34.1%, and PCE of 2.3%. The high Voc benefits from relatively low-lying HOMO energy levels of the p-OS donor P2TBR.

SVA has been proven to be a very effective approach to control the morphology and achieve promising enhancement in device performance.35,40,59–61 Therefore, the morphology of the P2TBR:IDIC blend film was optimized to further improve the device performance by SVA treatment. With the blend active layer processed by SVA with CS2, the OSCs displayed a remarkably improved Jsc from 6.7 to 17.5 mA cm−2 and an obviously increased FF from 34.1% to 70.1% simultaneously, while the Voc was slightly reduced to 0.94 V. The reduction in Voc is found to originate from the charge recombination induced by the quasi-Fermi level variation between the donor and acceptor materials.60 Finally, the champion PCE of 11.5% was achieved for the optimal device, which is the highest value reported for the all-small-molecule OSCs to date.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) tests were performed to verify their high Jsc values and probe photo harvesting and charge collection processes of the OSCs. The calculated Jsc values of the as-cast and optimal devices, integrated from their corresponding EQE curves, were 6.6 and 16.8 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree well with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. Compared to the as-cast device, the optimal device shows higher EQE values in the whole wavelength range of absorption, indicating that both P2TBR and IDIC contributed greatly to the photocurrent. The EQE response of the optimal device reached over 70% in the range of ca. 440–700 nm and had a maximum value up to 74% at 660 nm (Fig. 3b). After the SVA treatment, the hole and electron mobilities were estimated using the SCLC method (Fig. S4b and c, ESI†) to be 3.54 × 10−4 and 3.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the μh/μe was 1.06. The high and balanced μh/μe for the P2TBR:IDIC OSCs with SVA treatment is beneficial to suppress space charge accumulation and thus promote charge extraction, leading to their better Jsc and FF.
Exciton dissociation and charge recombination
The dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was measured to evaluate the exciton dissociation and charge extraction efficiencies. Jph is defined as JL−JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities of the devices under illumination and in the dark, Veff is defined as V0−V, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0 and V is the applied external voltage bias. Therefore, Veff determines the electric field in the bulk region and thereby affects the carrier transport and the photocurrent extraction. At high Veff values, mobile charge carriers rapidly move toward the corresponding electrodes with minimal recombination. The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) can be estimated from the ratio of Jph/Jsat; Jsat is the value where the Jph reaches its saturation at high reverse voltage, which means all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated to free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes.62 Under short-circuit and maximum power output conditions, the Pdiss values were calculated to be 95.86% and 81.47% for the P2TBR:IDIC blend with SVA treatment, respectively (Fig. 4a), implying that the P2TBR:IDIC OSCs have an efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction process, which is beneficial for realizing large Jsc and FF. The dependence of Voc on light intensity (Plight) can be used to describe the order of the recombination process. The slope of Vocversus ln Plight lines at 2kT/q indicates that the dominant recombination mechanism is the Shockley–Read–Hall or monomolecular recombination, while a slope of kT/q means that only bimolecular recombination takes place in the devices (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge).63 As shown in Fig. 4b, a slope of 1.13 kT/q for the P2TBR:IDIC-based devices with SVA treatment is far from 2 kT/q and close to kT/q, which means that the dominant recombination mechanism is bimolecular recombination. The dependence of Jph on P was measured to further study the charge bimolecular recombination behavior under short-circuit conditions of the devices. The relationship between Jph and P can be depicted by a power-law equation, Jph ∝ PS, where the value of S indicates the degree of bimolecular recombination. It is generally assumed that if more free charges can be swept out and effectively collected in individual electrodes prior to recombination, the slope of S is closer to 1.64 As shown in Fig. 4c, in logarithmic coordinates, the S value of the fitted lines was calculated as 0.976 for the devices based on P2TBR:IDIC blend films with SVA treatment. The higher S value indicates that there is very little charge carrier recombination in the device, which would reasonably enhance the utilization rate of excitons and improve the transport properties of carriers, facilitating the enhancement of Jsc and FF.

Film morphology
The morphology of the active layer is a critical factor to determine the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs.65–71 The big difference in the morphology is supposed to be the main reason for the different PCEs of the P2TBR:IDIC OSCs. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to investigate the surface and bulk morphology of the active layers and understand the relationship between the evolution of the active layer morphology and device performance. In the AFM images (Fig. 5a and b), the P2TBR:IDIC blend film presented a uniform and smooth feature with a relatively small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.55 nm. After the SVA treatment, the RMS roughness of the blend film dramatically increased to 5.96 nm and exhibited an apparent aggregation feature (Fig. 5d and e). The large RMS roughness is similar to that of some of the reported all-small-molecule systems (H11:IDIC, RMS = 6.94 nm;36 DRTB-T:IDIC, RMS = 5.75 nm,35 all of them possess relatively high PCEs. The RMS values of the all-small-molecule blend films are generally larger than those of the polymer based blend films. And the big difference of the RMS may be due to the stronger self-aggregation of the OSs with a lower entropy barrier.36 The results suggest that the SVA treatment induced the aggregation of P2TBR and IDIC in the blend film. The TEM image clearly showed large morphological changes upon SVA treatment, which agreed well with the AFM morphology observations.

The molecular packing and texture of the neat and blend films were investigated by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).72 The diffraction images and the related in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) line-cut profiles are displayed in Fig. 6. The P2TBR neat film shows a complicated molecular ordering. There is a pronounced (100) laminar packing diffraction peak at 0.34 Å−1 in both IP and OOP directions. Meanwhile, a (010) π–π stacking peak at 1.66 Å−1 in the IP and OOP direction is also observed, indicating that P2TBR has both edge-on and face-on crystalline orientations. The IDIC neat film shows a predominant face-on orientation relative to the substrate, as evidenced by the (100) peak at 0.38 Å−1 in the IP direction and a strong π–π stacking peak at 1.77 Å−1 in the OOP direction (Fig. 6a and b). These structural features remain in BHJ blends. As seen from the as-cast blend film, the P2TBR (100) diffraction peak at 0.34 Å−1 can be clearly observed in IP patterns with a broad azimuthal angle spreading. The π–π stacking peak area is dominated by the peak of IDIC, centered at 1.74 Å−1, which is slightly away from that of the neat thin film. This indicates a favoured face-on orientation relative to the substrate. SVA can effectively change the structural order of the BHJ blend film, leading to great changes of scattering features. As seen from Fig. 6a and b, some new and weak scattering spots are present in the 2D GIWAXS plots upon SVA treatment, indicating that larger crystals were formed. Notably, a diffraction peak at 0.43 Å−1 is seen in both IP and OOP directions. A clear texture comprising face-on and edge-on crystallites was observed in the SVA treated film, indicating the co-existence of vertical and parallel charge transportation channels in a sandwich device structure. In 2016, Yang et al. reported for the first time that a mixed face-on and edge-on texture was far better than that of the face-on orientated host film in a ternary blend comprising PTB7-Th:DR3TSBDT:PC71BM.73 A similar texture feature is also disclosed in high efficiency SM-OSCs.35,36,74 Therefore, compared to the as-cast P2TBR:IDIC film with a face-on orientation, the SVA treated film displays better crystallization properties and three dimensional charge pathways, which are beneficial to intermolecular charge transfer.

The phase separation of blend films was studied using resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS).75–77 An X-ray photon energy of 284.2 eV was selected to enhance material contrast.78,79 As shown in Fig. 7, the BHJ thin film with SVA treatment led to an obvious R-SoXS intensity enhancement, indicating that the phase separation is better developed. R-SoXS can also reveal the average composition variations (relative domain purity) via integrating scattering profiles. A higher total scattering intensity (TSI) implies purer average domains.80 Upon SVA treatment, the domain purity of the device is improved because of the broadened scattering profile and enhanced scattering intensity, which is in agreement with the AFM and TEM results. It is beneficial to suppress bimolecular recombination and promote charge collection and extraction. Combining the GIWAXS and R-SoXS analysis of the P2TBR:IDIC system without and with SVA treatment, we can see that the SVA treatment can improve crystallinity and enhance phase purity of blend films. It is favorable for increasing FF, thereby higher PCEs after the SVA treatment were obtained.

Fig. S5† gives the PCEs of P2TBR obtained in this work and the other high efficiency small molecule donors which show PCEs of over 9% in SM-OSCs (Fig. S1 and Table S1 for the details in the ESI†). It is easy to find that these small molecule donors all contain a BDT central building block, while P2TBR has the non-fused ring (TBT) core. As previously stated, the non-fused ring molecule with non-covalent interaction has many advantages, such as good planarity, high crystallinity, and easy chemical modification. In this work, the small molecule P2TBR provides a state-of-the-art PCE of 11.5% in SM-OSCs, and the value is the highest PCE reported so far. Therefore, the exciting results further indicate that the non-fused ring structure is a good unit to use in high efficiency organic small molecule donors.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a new small molecule, P2TBR, with non-fused TBT as the central unit, BDT as conjugated π spacers and 3-ethylrhodanines as terminal groups was developed and used as a donor material in non-fullerene SM-OSCs. P2TBR shows strong absorption, a low-lying HOMO energy level, high hole mobility and good thermal stability. The P2TBR:IDIC based OSCs with solvent vapor annealing treatment by CS2 exhibited an outstanding PCE of 11.5%, with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 17.5 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.1%. This efficiency is the highest PCE for non-fullerene all-small-molecule systems reported to date. In other words, the results indicate that P2TBR is a promising candidate p-OS donor material for use in SM-OSCs, and the molecular design strategy for P2TBR provides the possibility that the simple-structured and easy to chemically modify non-fused unit can also be used as a building block in high performance p-OS donors.
