    , Accepted 19th May 2021First published on 20th May 2021AbstractGroup IV and V monolayers are promising state-of-the-art two-dimensional (2D) materials owing to their high carrier mobility, tunable bandgaps, and optical linear dichroism along with outstanding electronic and thermoelectric properties. Furthermore, recent studies revealed the stability of free-standing 2D monolayers by hydrogenation. Inspired by this, we systematically predicted and investigated the structure and properties of various hydrogen-saturated silicon phosphide (H–Si–P) monolayers based on first-principles calculations. According to the results, H–Si–P monolayers belong to indirect bandgap semiconductors with a highly stable structure. Their bandgaps and band edge positions assessed using accurate hybrid functional are shown to be effectively adjusted by applying a biaxial strain. Furthermore, the absorption spectra of these monolayers, simulated in the context of time-dependent density functional theory, exhibit their excellent potential for solar energy conversion and visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting. In this respect, this work provides valuable guidance for finding more 2D semiconductors and nanostructures for nanoelectronics and optoelectronic applications, as well as for photocatalytic water splitting.
I. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted much interest with respect to their integration into optoelectronic devices, e.g., graphene, MoS2, and MoSe2,1–8 due to the tunable bandgap that is the basis for broadband photoresponse. However, the in-plane isotropic structure of these materials impedes their application in polarization-sensitive photodetectors. In this respect, since 2014, tremendous attention has been paid to a novel 2D layered semiconductor material, known as black phosphorus (BP). Its in-plane anisotropic physical properties along zigzag and armchair directions along with prominent carrier mobility and thickness-dependent direct bandgap allowed BP to be considered as promising not only in polarization-sensitive photodetectors, but also in transistors, photonic and optoelectronic appliances, sensors, batteries, catalysis, and many other applications.9–17 Meanwhile, the extensive development of BP was hampered by its instability under ambient conditions, as well as by the lack of techniques for producing large-area and high-quality 2D nanofilms.18,19
In this regard, attempts have been made to discover analogues with improved characteristics, leading to group IV–V 2D semiconductors, such as GeP20 and GeAs21 materials, whose high in-plane anisotropic properties have become a hot topic in modern research. Among these, particular attention is paid to orthorhombic silicon phosphides (o-SiP, mm2 point group), for which various theoretical calculations predict a widely tunable bandgap (from 1.69 to 2.59 eV) and high carrier mobility similar to that of BP.22 However, there are still a few experimental studies that provide new information on the optical and electronic properties, especially on the in-plane anisotropic characteristics of o-SiP. One rare example is a study of Li et al.; they experimentally confirmed that o-SiP is an excellent optoelectronic 2D material with a large bandgap (1.71 eV), high mobility (2.034 × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1), and fast photoresponse.23 Nevertheless, the in-plane anisotropy of o-SiP, being important for the state-of-the-art devices, such as thin-film polarizers, polarization sensors, and plasmonic devices, has still remained beyond the scope of many studies.
In this study, we designed three hydrogen-saturated SiP monolayers, known as H–Si–P. Depending on the hydrogen position, they are HPSi, HSiP, and HSiPbp structures, respectively. HPSi means that hydrogen atoms are added to phosphorus atoms in the upward direction. HSiP refers to a structure where hydrogen atoms are attached to silicon atoms in the upward direction. HSiPbp indicates that hydrogen atoms are linked to silicon atoms in both the upward and downward directions. The HPSi and HSiP monolayers possess space-group symmetry P3m1, whereas the HSipbp monolayer is described to have a Pmn21 space group. Special attention is paid to a theoretical study of the optical and electronic properties of these monolayers simulated through density functional theory (DFT). In particular, their phonon spectra and cohesive energies show a highly stable structure of these compounds. The studies on bandgaps and band edge positions of H–Si–Ps monolayers have proved their semiconductor properties, which can even be tuned by applying the mechanical biaxial strains. The optical absorption spectra of the monolayered compounds reveal an increase in the potential efficiency of solar energy conversion and water splitting, proving that these nanostructures are promising for water splitting in a visible-light region.
II. Computational details
For a periodic H–Si–P monolayer, the optical and electronic properties were simulated in the context of the ab initio density functional theory (DFT) using the CASTEP package.24 During calculations, the norm-conserving pseudopotentials and the plane wave energy cutoff of 720 eV were used to relax the structure models along with the band structures via the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) expressed by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.25 The structures, including the primitive cells of the H–Si–P monolayer, were exposed to relaxation until the forces were smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1 and the energy tolerances were less than 1 × 10−7 eV per atom. A vacuum layer of 23 Å was used to avoid interactions between the neighboring layers. The k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone with 6 × 6 × 1 for HPSi and HSiP monolayers, and with 8 × 8 × 1 for HSiPbp, was performed by using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme.26 The phonon dispersions of monolayered H–Si–P were calculated using the linear response method.27 The band structures, density of states, and optical properties were evaluated using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof screened hybrid functional (HSE06).28 To further study the stability of these materials, we performed finite temperature molecular dynamics simulations at 273 K and 300 K by using the CASTEP package. The length of time-step was selected as 1 ps, and simulations with 1000 steps were executed. We used the 6 × 6 × 1 k-mesh and energy tolerances less than 1 × 10−6 eV per atom. For monolayered nanostructures, the collective plasmonic excitations were simulated in the direction parallel to the nanostructure plane using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) on the basis of the OCTOPUS real-space TDDFT code.29 The dangling bonds at the edges were passivated by hydrogen atoms using the Troullier–Martins pseudopotentials30 to elucidate the impact of different edge states and dimensional confinement on the collective plasmonic excitations of H–Si–P structures. Reparametrized PBE functional25 was used to determine the van der Waals interactions for the exchange potential and correlation potential used in both the ground-state and excited-state calculations. To obtain the linear optical absorption spectra of the studied structures, their initial states were excited by providing a small momentum E(t) = Ekickδ(t) to the electrons by assuming the time-propagating Kohn–Sham wave functions. The information about the excitations was deduced from the dipole-strength function and the excitation spectrum was obtained from the Fourier transformation of the dipole strength. The simulation zone was defined by assigning a sphere centered around each atom with a radius of 7 Å and a uniform mesh grid of 0.3 Å. In a real-time propagation, the Kohn–Sham wave function was evolved for typically 6000 steps with a time step of 0.003ℏ eV−1. The atoms were fixed in the XY plane of the Cartesian coordinate system. The zigzag edge of the nanostructure was assumed to be perpendicular to the X-axis, while the armchair edge was parallel to the X-axis.
III. Results and discussion
Three different structures, HPSi, HSiP, and HSiPbp, were simulated. Their full structural relaxations provided the structural parameters, including lattice constants, bond length, layer height, and bond angles as shown in Fig. 1. The corresponding values of the parameters evaluated for the above structures are shown in Table 1. To study the stability of H–Si–P monolayers, their cohesive energies along with the phonon dispersions were calculated using the equations below: (1) (2)

Eqn (1) was used for HPSi and HSiP structures. Eqn (2) was applied for HSiPbp. Here, Ecoh is the total energy of the H–Si–P monolayer, and ESi, EP, and EH are the ground-state energies of Si, P, and H free atoms, respectively, calculated by neglecting the interactions between the neighboring atoms in a cubic cell with a lattice constant of 20 Å. As shown in Table 1, the cohesive energies of HPSi, HSiP, and HSiPbp were found to be −4.498, −4.751, and −4.740 eV, respectively. The high enough cohesive energies of the three monolayered structures provide evidence about the high stability of H–Si–P monolayers.
The properties of phonons can be described using a harmonic approximation based on just one fundamental quantity, the force constant matrix: (3)here, μ refers to the displacement of a given atom and E is the total energy in the harmonic approximation. This force constant matrix (or Hessian matrix) can also be represented in a reciprocal space and the result is commonly referred as the dynamical matrix: (4)
Classical equations of motion can be written in the language of dynamical matrices, as an eigenvalue problem. Each atomic displacement is described in the form of plane waves: u(R,t) = εei(qR−ω(q)t)(5)where the polarization vector of each mode, ε, is an eigenvector with the dimension of 3N of the eigenvalue problem: Mω(q)2ε = D(q)ε(6)
The dependence of the frequency, ω, on the wave vector is known as the phonon dispersion.

Fig. 2 shows the phonon band dispersions of HPSi, HSiP, and HSiPbp structures along the high symmetric points of their Brillouin zones with respect to Fig. 1(g)–(i). Here, the stability of the calculated phonon dispersions lacking soft modes and the linear dispersion relationship of the acoustic branch around the G point indicate the outstanding kinetic stability of the simulated monolayered H–Si–P structures. In addition, we also performed finite temperature molecular dynamics simulations at 273 K and 300 K to further study the stability of single-layered HPSi, HSiP, and HSiPbp as shown in Fig. 3. We found that their crystal structures corresponding to the T = 273 and 300 K case, which are shown in Fig. 3, still show no significant structural differences compared with their initial crystal structures. This indicates that these materials are stable at freezing point of water and room temperature. Therefore, our calculations mentioned above provide an authentic test for the stability of single-layered H–Si–Ps.

Fig. 4 shows the band structures of monolayered H–Si–P systems, calculated using the HSE06 hybrid functional. Their bandgaps were found to be 2.74, 3.325, and 3.749 eV for HPSi, HSiP, and HSiPbp, respectively. Such wide bandgaps of the studied 2D materials allow one to refer them to 2D semiconductors that are suitable for applications in high-power electronic devices, field emission appliances, and optoelectronic tools operating under UV or visible light conditions. Furthermore, the bandgaps exhibit indirect behavior. For HPSi, the VB maximum (VBM) lies at point K, and the CB minimum (CBM) occurs along the G–M direction. For HSiP, the VBM intersects the G point, and the CBM crosses over the M point. For HSiPbp, the VBM arises along the Y–G direction, and the CBM lies at G point.

To understand the contribution of different orbitals to the electronic states and the bonding characteristics of monolayered H–Si–P, the TDOS and PDOS were calculated for monolayered H–Si–P. Fig. 4 shows the TDOS and PDOS calculated for monolayered H–Si–P. As shown in Fig. 5, the TDOS of all monolayered compounds, considered in this study, exhibit multiple van Hove singularities over the entire energy range, consistent with the 2D nature of a monolayered SiP material. In turn, the PDOS of monolayered compounds reveal the contributions from both the s and p orbitals of Si and P near the Fermi level. Obviously, the effects from the p orbitals of Si and P to the TDOS are much more pronounced than those from the s orbitals. Such a predominance of the p orbitals is due to the sp3-like bonding of P atoms and sp2-like bonding of group V forming the monolayer H–Si–P, and this feature is always observed in group IV diamond-like structures and monolayered honeycomb systems of group III elements. A thorough analysis of PDOS plots reveals that the state closest to the VBM of HPSi originates from the p orbitals of Si atoms, whereas the states closest to the VBM of HSiP and HSiPbp arise from the p orbitals of P atoms. For the states closest to the CBM, these refer to the p orbitals of Si atoms. Additionally, the specific distribution of VBMs and CBMs in the monolayered compounds is beneficial for the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thus reducing their recombination and increasing the photocatalytic activity.31

To determine the alignment of the CBM and VBM energies, the work functions of monolayered H–Si–P were calculated using the HSE06 functional. Fig. 6 shows the CBM and VBM energy levels with the redox potentials of water splitting. To make a semiconductor promising for water splitting, both the reduction and oxidation potentials must be located inside the bandgap. As shown in Fig. 6, their values are VH+/H2 = 4.44 eV and VOH−/O2 = 5.67 eV, respectively, which are obviously within the bandgaps of the studied materials, thereby revealing the energetically favorable redox process for these. In this respect, these monolayered materials are the candidates for photocatalytic water splitting. However, because the bandgaps of HSiP and HSiPbp monolayered compounds are within the UV light energy range, this impedes their application for visible-light-induced photocatalytic splitting of water. Moreover, even though the theoretical calculations predict the suitability of monolayered H–Si–P systems for photocatalytic water splitting in the vacuum, the situation may change when placing them in a liquid water environment. Therefore, further studies are necessary to understand the band structure behavior of these 2D materials in water.

Strain is inevitable in real systems due to the synthetic and application environments. Many experimental and theoretical studies32–36 have shown that applying mechanical strain to the sample is a powerful method for modulating its band structure and the optical properties. In this respect, monolayered H–Si–P systems were subjected to mechanical tensile and compressive biaxial strains to monitor the evolution of their band structures and optical properties. The mechanical biaxial strain was simulated by freezing one of the lattice constants as follows: η = (a − a0)/a0, where a0 is the optimized lattice constant and a is the lattice parameter along the strain direction. The positive and negative values of η can be attributed to tensile and compressive strain, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the cohesive energy as a function of strain η for the H–Si–P systems within a strain range from −10% to 10% at a spacing of 1%. According to these plots, the structures under consideration are highly stable under the applied loads, even though the stability of stretched and compressed monolayers is weaker than that before strain. Furthermore, the HSiP and HSiPbp systems are more stable than HPSi.

Fig. 8 shows the bandgaps versus strain η for the H–Si–P structures within the same strain range, as shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the bandgaps of all the studied H–Si–P monolayers exhibit an identical trend, increasing in a quasi-linear manner to a certain η value and then linearly decreasing with increasing η. Special attention is paid to the bandgap variation for monolayered HSiPbp (shown with a blue line in Fig. 8(a)), where two linear tendencies (a rise followed by a drop) of bandgap values are clearly observed. This can be interpreted as follows: At η > −1%, there is an increase in the distance between the Si and P atoms, making the overlap integral of the wave functions between them decrease and leading to a decrease in their bandgaps. At η < −1%, the distance between the neighboring Si atoms in the same sublayer becomes so close that the overlap integral of the wave functions for the inner electrons of these Si atoms increases, causing a decrease in their bandgaps while increasing |η|. It is thus clear that the bandgaps of the H–Si–P monolayer have a linear response within a certain biaxial tensile strain range, indicating their potential application in mechanical sensors. For HPSi, the bandgaps within a range of −10% < η < 10% vary from 1.628 to 2.056 eV, thus satisfying the requirements for photocatalytic water splitting under visible light. For HSiP, the bandgaps within a range of −10% < η < −3% vary from 1.866 to 3.136 eV, respectively, and when η = 8%, 9% and 10%, their bandgaps are 3.111, 2.857, and 2.613 eV, respectively. For HSiPbp, the bandgaps within a range of −10% < η < -5% vary from 1.862 to 3.129 eV, respectively, and bandgaps within a range of 5% < η < 10% vary from 3.117 to 2.556 eV, respectively. In this respect, the bandgaps of all presented 2D materials cover the visible-light range, indicating that these semiconductors exhibit a high light utilization rate.
The effect of strain on the band edge positions of monolayered compounds was elucidated by determining the corresponding CBM and VBM from the relaxed configurations by calculating the work functions. Fig. 8(b) shows the band edge positions of HPSi, HSiP, and HSiPbp undergoing biaxial strain. Therefore, Fig. 7 is shown to provide useful guidance for tuning the bandgaps along with CBM and VBM levels of monolayered compounds to maximize the solar energy conversion efficiency. For this reason, the data shown in Fig. 8 were further used to calculate the absorption spectra of monolayered H–Si–P to evaluate their sunlight utilization.

The absorption spectra of 2D monolayered structures were calculated by assuming the in-plane polarized light. First, the frequency-dependent dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω) was determined. Then the absorption coefficient was evaluated as a function of photon energy according to the following expression:37 (7)

Fig. 9 shows the absorption spectra of HPSi, HSiP, and HSiPbp under biaxial strain, simulated within a range of below 6 eV. For HPSi, absorption resonance peaks are present around 5 eV. Only for four structures of H–Si–Ps, absorption resonance peaks are present around 5 eV. No absorption resonance peaks are present around 5 eV for H–Si–P bps. No absorption resonance peaks arise within the visible (3.3–1.7 eV) range for all the structures. A periodic 2D graphene structure shows a resonance peak around 5.0 eV in its absorption spectrum.38–40 However, in the case of 2D graphene nanostructures, the boundary effect leads to absorption peak splitting in the low energy region.41,42 In this respect, one can assume the same situation for the monolayered H–Si–P nanostructures under consideration.

The HPSi nanostructure is composed of 27 silicon, 27 phosphorus, and 27 hydrogen atoms. The HSiP nanostructure is composed of 25 silicon, 25 phosphorus, and 34 hydrogen atoms in the HSiP nanostructure. The HSiPbp nanostructure is composed of 27 silicon, 27 phosphorus, and 37 hydrogen atoms. In all the structures, the dangling bonds at the edges are passivated by hydrogen atoms. 
To confirm or deny this suggestion, the absorption peculiarities were calculated for the monolayered H–Si–P nanostructures below 9 eV, as shown in Fig. 11. For this, the collective plasmonic excitations in the monolayered H–Si–P nanostructures were evaluated using the TDDFT.28 The linear optical absorption spectra of the systems were obtained following a scheme proposed by Yabana and Bertsch,43 where their excitation frequencies were determined from the momentum (κ) of the electron. The latter was achieved by transforming the ground-state wave functions propagating in some (finite) time: ψi(r,δt) = eiκzψi(r,0)(8)
The spectra could then be calculated from the expression of the dipole strength function presented below: (9)where α(ω) is the dynamical polarizability described by the Fourier transform of the dipole moment of the system d(t) as (10)
Using this definition, the Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn sum rule for the number of electrons (N) can be expressed using the integral: (11)

Fig. 11 shows the optical absorption spectra of monolayered H–Si–P systems, simulated using eqn (5). In comparison with the spectra shown in Fig. 8, those in Fig. 10 were extended toward the infrared (below 1.7 eV) region, where it shows the absorption splitting for all the studied H–Si–P systems by analogy with a monolayered graphene nanostructure, which is due to the finite size effects.39,40 Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of the graphene nanostructure also depends on the edge (zigzag or armchair) configuration.39,40 In this regard, the absorption spectra in Fig. 10 were simulated with respect to an impulse excitation polarized in the x-axis and y-axis directions, where the x-axis corresponded to the armchair edge direction and the y-axis referred to a zigzag edge. Clearly, changing the edge direction leads to pronounced alterations in the optical absorption spectra of all the simulated systems, which are especially manifested below 4 eV. When the impulse excitation is polarized in the armchair edge direction (x axis), the absorption peaks of HPSi are mainly located in the vicinity of the energy resonance points at 0.86, 1.51, and 2.53 eV; the absorption peaks of HSiP arise at 1.02, 1.53, 2.23, 2.88, and 3.89 eV, and those of HSiPbp are observed at 0.41, 1.37, and 2.62 eV. In the case of the impulse excitation polarized in the zigzag edge direction (y axis), the absorption peaks of HPSi emerge at 0.58, 1.16, and 1.98 eV; those of HSiP appear at 0.94, 1.48, 2.59, and 3.24 eV; and the absorption signatures of HSiPbp appear at 0.96, 1.64, 2.46, and 3.1 eV. The energy resonance points which are below 1.6 eV refer to IR radiation. Those between 1.6 eV and 3.2 eV refer to visible light. Those higher than 3.2 eV refer to ultraviolet light.

To elucidate the mechanism governing the behavior observed in the optical absorption spectra within the low-energy range for all the simulated structures, the spatial dependence of the induced charge response was analyzed at the resonance frequencies obtained from the time evolution in a plane. For this, the induced charge plane was assumed to be parallel to the graphene plane and the vertical distance between the top atomic layer of the nanostructure, and the induced charge density plane was estimated to be 0.9 Å. The low-energy resonances are localized in the boundary region. The induced charge density profiles for these plasmonic resonance points exhibit a dipole-like character. Moreover, the lower-energy plasmons follow the long-range charge transfer plasmon (CTP) mode attributed to the electronic motion along the direction in which electrons can propagate through longer distances. Fig. 12 shows the Fourier transforms of the induced charge densities of HSiPbp and HSiP nanostructures. The polarization direction was set along the armchair edge at the energy resonance points of 1.37 eV for HSiPbp nanostructures and at 2.23 and 2.88 eV for HSiP monolayers, as well along the zigzag edge direction at energy resonance points of 1.48 eV for the HSiP monolayer. Compared with periodic systems, the selected nanostructures exhibit highly tunable polarization-dependent enhanced plasmon resonance in a wide frequency region, which would be useful for water splitting in the infrared and visible light regions.

IV. Conclusions
In summary, HPSi, HSiP, and HSiPbp monolayers were theoretically studied based on the first-principles calculations. The calculations of the phonon spectra and cohesive energies revealed the high stability of the monolayered H–Si–P structures. According to the bandgaps and band edge simulated using the accurate hybrid functional, all the three monolayered structures belong to indirect bandgap semiconductors that were shown to be suitable for photocatalytic water splitting under visible (HPSi) and ultraviolet light (HSiP and HSiPbp). Furthermore, their bandgaps and band edge positions were found to be effectively adjusted by applying a biaxial tensile or compressive strain. Finally, the ability to use the simulated H–Si–P monolayers for light-induced photocatalytic water splitting was studied via the modeling of their optical absorption spectra without strain and under the ultimate biaxial tensile strain. The absence of absorption peaks within the visible-light range led to a need to calculate the absorption spectra of these nanostructures using a TDDFT method, which exhibited a series of absorption splitting within the visible range. In this respect, the simulated 2D nanostructures exhibit excellent potential for solar energy conversion and visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting. Thus, this study provides valuable guidance for discovering new 2D semiconductors and nanostructures for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices, as well as for potential photocatalytic water splitting applications.
