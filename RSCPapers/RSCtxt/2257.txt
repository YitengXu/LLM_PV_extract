    , Accepted 27th July 2018First published on 27th July 2018AbstractCesium lead iodide nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the best perovskites to date. The quality of CsPbI3 tends to degrade with time and many researchers have embarked on studies for the improvement of CsPbI3 stability. Herein, CsPbI3 nanoparticles were synthesized via a colloidal approach by varying the capping agent and the coordinating solvent. The effect of a phosphinic ligand on the synthesis of CsPbI3 was assessed with the aim of getting new properties and/or improving its existing properties. The stability of the synthesized CsPbI3 perovskites was evaluated through photoluminescence emission over time. A nearly cubic phase of CsPbI3 was obtained through synthesis with diphenylphosphinic acid (DPPA) in benzyl ether (BE). Smaller nanocubes with an average size of 14 nm were prepared using DPPA in BE. The emission intensity lasted beyond 6 days with only 40% emission lost compared to that of materials prepared using a mixture of solvents and the conventional method. In order to illustrate possible applications, the NCs were used in a simple solar cell device with the configuration substrate-FTO-TiO2-CsPbI3/NiO-Au. A power conversion efficiency and a fill factor of 2.0% and 38%, respectively, were obtained from a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD)-free solar device which was made of the more stable synthesized CsPbI3.
1. Introduction
Various types of materials are prepared in many shapes and sizes in order to suit specific applications. Perovskites can be prepared as bulk materials, thin films and nanomaterials.1–3 Halide perovskites can be inorganic such as cesium lead iodide or organometallic such as formamidinium lead iodide. Cesium lead iodide, CsPbI3, is one of the best materials required in perovskite-related applications including emerging solar cell technology. Attempts to improve the quality of perovskite materials have been made by many researchers.4–8 The hybrids of organic–inorganic perovskites, halide exchange, cation exchange and ligand exchange are the main endeavours. These are also pursued in order to get stable perovskites besides the improvement of their structural and optical properties.9,10 A power conversion efficiency of 19.50% has been reported in perovskite solar cells made of FA1−xCsxPbI3 films. The grain size of FA1−xCsxPbI3 was enlarged by adding a small amount of lead thiocyanate.7 However, many other reports have demonstrated that the use of inorganic materials improved the performance of fabricated solar cell devices in comparison with similar devices made of organic materials.11–15
Phosphine-containing compounds have been used in the synthesis of nanoparticles and the most utilized is trioctylphosphine (TOP).16–19 In a typical approach, lead iodate was dispersed in TOP and the solution was added to a hot cesium carbonate solution to form CsPbI3 possessing low recombination and enhanced chemical stability.18 This approach resulted in the slow dissolution of lead iodide in TOP which led to a relatively long time for full synthesis to take place. Attempts to improve the stability of CsPbI3 nanocrystals have been made through a post-synthesis treatment with TOP.19 This is seen as a ligand exchange process where TOP, instead of oleylamine, is adsorbed on the surface of nanocrystals which prevents further degradation of the synthesized CsPbI3.
In order to further minimize the use of organic materials, nickel oxide is used, which is one of the inorganic hole transporting materials that are relatively stable, cheap and simple to use in solar cell devices, instead of organic molecules.13–15
In this work, the effect of phosphinic acid on the synthesis of stable CsPbI3 nanocrystals is investigated. The properties of the synthesized perovskite nanocrystals are studied and the sample is applied in a 2,2,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD)-free solar cell device.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Cesium carbonate, lead iodide, diphenylphosphinic acid (DPPA), oleylamine (OLA), oleic acid (OA), benzyl ether (BE), octadecene (ODE), toluene, ethanol, nickel oxide nanopowder, dimethylformamide (DMF), hydrochloric acid, zinc powder from Sigma Aldrich and TiO2 paste from Solaronix were of analytical grade and used as purchased.
2.2. Conventional synthesis
The typical synthesis was done by placing 0.2 mmol PbI2 in 5 mL ODE, 0.5 mL OA and 0.5 mL OLA stirred in a 25 mL 3-necked flask. The flask content was degassed at 80 °C for 30 min. Under a nitrogen flow, the temperature was raised to 150 °C where 0.5 mL of Cs-OA (0.42 g Cs2CO3 dissolved in 8 mL at 150 °C) was swiftly injected. After 10 s, the flask was quickly cooled down to room temperature in a cold water bath. The nanocrystals (NCs) were directly washed via centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes followed by redispersion in toluene.
2.3. Modified routes

2.3.1. OLA–OA addition by hot injection. 
Modification of OLA–OA addition was done using the same template as per the conventional approach. OLA and OA were added after drying PbI2 in ODE at 120 °C for 1 hour. After all the PbI3 had dissolved under a nitrogen flow, the temperature was raised to 150 °C. Cs-oleate (0.5 mL) as prepared above was quickly injected and the remaining steps followed those for conventional synthesis.


2.3.2. ODE and OA replacements. 
The solvents and ligands were changed from those used in conventional synthesis. ODE and OLA were replaced by toluene and benzene ether (BE) when the effect of other ligands such as DPPA was studied. Since DPPA is solid, the use of specific solvents capable of dissolving DPPA and the precursors is required. Nevertheless, the same protocol as that for the conventional approach was followed.

2.4. Characterization of nanoparticles
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was done using a Nicolet 1550 FT-IR spectrometer with a diamond crystal. UV-vis spectroscopy was done using a Cary 50, and the photoluminescence was studied on a Cary Eclipse with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm. The morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles was assessed using an FEI Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope. The crystalline phase of the samples was determined using a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu LFF HRDK40 X-ray tube.
2.5. Fabrication and characterization of the CsPbI3 solar cell device
FTO-coated glass substrates were etched by sprinkling zinc powder on the surface followed by a few drops of HCl (2 M) to obtain the required electrode pattern. The substrates were sequentially sonicated in liquid detergent, distilled water, 2-propanol, acetone and ethanol for 10 min, respectively. Solaronix TiO2 paste was deposited onto the FTO coated substrate followed by sintering at 450 for 30 min. A CsPbI3 solution (5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on TiO2 at 1000 rpm for 30 s and then quickly baked at 100 °C for about 1 min. This cycle was repeated until the active layer completely covered TiO2. The hole transporting layer was made by 3 cycles of spin-coating with NiO solution in dimethylformamide (0.5 M) onto the active layer at 1000 rpm for 15 s. Gold film was then deposited using a shadow mask via a sputter coater to a thickness of 50 nm. A device made of substrate-FTO-TiO2-CsPbI3/NiO-Au with a pattern area of 0.06 cm2 was fabricated. Contacts between FTO and gold were connected to the current–voltage measurement kit and the current characteristics were collected using a solar simulator set at 100 mW cm−2 and under standard AM 1.5 conditions.
3. Results and discussion
CsPbI3 nanocrystals have known problems with instability and the study is focused on the investigation of different parameters that influence their formation. These include the use of different stabilizers and a mixture thereof. This follows an effort to fabricate a solar cell device using the nanocrystals. The nature of stabilizers on nanocrystals, emission peaks, and their optical stability and morphological characteristics are discussed. The electrical features of the fabricated solar device are also included to indicate the device behaviour.
The as-synthesized CsPbI3 nanocrystals were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy in order to investigate the capping ligands present on the surface. Fig. 1 shows that all the types of the synthesized nanocrystals possess an organic material bound on their surface. The bands at 2955 cm−1 and 2848 cm−1 are due to C–H and 1473 cm−1 is attributed to –CH2 bonds in the aliphatic chains of octadecyl (ODE) and oleyl groups (OA and OLA). The bands at 1505 cm−1 and 729 cm−1 are due to CC and C–H, respectively, in the benzene rings of DPPA and BE. The peaks at 1151 cm−1, 1074 cm−1 and 1030 cm−1 are due to P–H (DPPA), C–P (DPPA) and C–O–C (BE) bonds, respectively. These bands were all found on the surface of the CsPbI3 nanocrystals as they were used as capping ligands. For instance, only ODE–OA–OLA containing bonds were found in the nanocrystals synthesized using ODE as per the conventional method, whereas the presence of DPPA and BE in CsPbI3 synthesized using the last two organic materials was proven by their specific bonds such as aromatic CC and C–H, P–H, C–P and C–O–C.
 Fig. 1  FTIR spectra of CsPbI3 NCs synthesized using (a) ODE as per the conventional method, (b) DPPA/BE–ODE and (c) DPPA/BE. 
The photoluminescence of the synthesized NCs was determined and the emission spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The emission peaks were observed between 680 and 700 nm and this was also manifested by a strong red emission colour when all the freshly prepared samples were observed under a UV lamp. The emission peaks of the perovskite NCs prepared from conventional solvents, DPPA/BE in ODE and DPPA/BE were found at 700, 690 and 680 nm, respectively. This may be the result of the different structures of the three samples. These emission peaks indicate that the band gap energies of NCs synthesized using conventional solvents, DPPA/BE in ODE and DPPA/BE can be approximated to be slightly above 1.77, 1.8 and 1.82 eV, respectively. The FWHM values of 40, 34 and 33 nm were determined from the NCs obtained from synthesis using conventional solvents, DPPA/BE in ODE and DPPA/BE, respectively. All the FWHM values indicate a lower degree of polydispersity in all the three samples. The samples prepared using DPPA had a smaller FWHM value and higher intensity peaks compared to the ODE sample prepared by the conventional method.

Attempts to study the stability of these NCs (Fig. 3) showed positive aspects with both precursors prepared from DPPA/BE and DPPA/BE–ODE, as the emission peaks were persistent in comparison with the NCs synthesized through conventional parameters where almost all the emission intensity is lost in a single day. Considering the initial PL emission of each material as a whole unit (100%), the decrease in the percentage emission of each sample was determined throughout a time interval of 0–6 days (Fig. 4). A drastic decrease in PL emission was found in the sample prepared from ODE using the conventional method. Nearly non-emissive particles were observed within a day. BE-synthesized particles resulted in a relatively slow decrease in PL emission. Only 40% PL emission was lost in 6 days when the DPPA capped nanoparticles were synthesized using BE as the sole solvent. This is enough evidence of stability of perovskite nanoparticles when synthesized using DPPA as the capping agent in BE. A similar effect manifested in the sample prepared from BE–ODE as the solvent system but the corresponding nanoparticles proved to be less stable with nearly 74% PL emission lost. On the one hand, ODE is one of the best solvents for the synthesis of nanocrystals due to its high temperature stability and its role as a ligand through the double bond functional group. On the other hand, DPPA could not be dissolved in ODE. BE was used to facilitate the dissolution of DPPA and both molecules can mostly play the role of capping agents, as also shown from the FTIR spectra. Therefore, the resulting DPPA synthesized perovskites were further used for solar device trials.

The XRD patterns (Fig. 5) showed that the peaks of the NCs prepared from the conventional method using ODE matched well with those in PDF cart number 980027979 which is an orthorhombic phase of CsPbI3. The particles prepared using the BE–ODE system gave CsPbI3 with a dominant orthorhombic phase (PDF 980027979) alongside a smaller cubic phase (PDF 980181288), whereas the counterpart sample prepared using BE only gave CsPbI3 with a dominant cubic phase (PDF 980181288) alongside smaller impurities of orthorhombic CsI. This may also play a role in the optical behaviour observed from the PL analysis. The XRD patterns of the NCs prepared from the DPPH/BE system did not show any change in the peaks after 6 days of stability test. The preparation of a pure cubic phase would play a critical role as many reports have confirmed its positive effects on the properties of the perovskites.9,10,20

The morphology of the NCs was assessed using TEM (Fig. 6). The crystals were mostly cubic and the average sizes of the particles synthesized from ODE–OLA–OA, BE–ODE and BE solvents were 50 nm, 30 nm and 14 nm, respectively. The use of BE as the sole coordinating solvent allows the formation of 0D crystals within a narrower size range and with a well-defined cubic shape compared to the use of a mixture of solvents which yielded 3D materials. The difference in morphology of all the synthesized materials corroborates with the XRD findings where the crystallinity of the nanocrystals synthesized in BE only was different from that of the perovskites synthesized from a mixture of solvents. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in the inset of Fig. 6c confirmed that the nanoparticles are highly crystalline. There was no noticeable difference in morphology between the freshly prepared CsPbI3 nanocrystals and those stored after days. The stable nanocrystals could maintain their structures, whereas the less stable samples might have already degraded during the time between synthesis which is 0 day and analysis which happened in 0–6 days since the samples were stored under ambient conditions.

The mechanism of synthesis may be explained by the growth of nuclei capping ligands leading to structures shown in Fig. 6. The ligands made of aliphatic chains did not provide optimum conditions for the nuclei to grow for the formation of uniform nanoparticles. Furthermore, the use of BE as a cyclic chain did not bring enough change to ODE behaviour although the particles seemed to have been formed in smaller sizes. The chemical structure of BE shows some similarities with DPPA. The phenyl groups allowed for better growth of nuclei and the formation of uniform nanocrystals when the DPPA/BE system was used. Phenyls are cyclic and aromatic groups, hence they protected the phosphine group and favoured better attachment of ligands on the particles. This resulted in uniform growth and stability of the nanoparticles in comparison with the ODE/OLA system which has aliphatic chains. The proposed mechanism does not include all the conditions that researchers may set for the synthesis of nanocrystals. Other capping agents, precursors and methods of synthesis are some of the variables that researchers may still investigate.
The electrical parameters of the device assembled with the substrate-FTO-TiO2-CsPbI3/NiO-Au configuration were assessed, as shown in Fig. 7. A fill factor and a maximum power of 38% and 3.3 mW cm−2, respectively, were obtained with the device based on CsPbI3 NCs capped with DPPA in BE. A PCE of 2.0% was determined and this value proved that the device could further be optimized for better performance. The current device was assembled in air and no spiro-MeOTAD was used. A similar lower PCE was obtained in other studies using a DSSC device configuration.21 Many parameters have to be studied for a competitive solar cell device besides the desired properties of the active layer. The thickness of each layer, electron or hole affinity, solvent compatibility, the conditions for device fabrication, etc. are some of the parameters that researchers consider during the optimization of photovoltaic performance.22–25 As such, the thickness of the active layer was monitored in perovskite devices with the configuration Cu/Al/perovskite (or PCBM/perovskite)/PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate, resulting in efficiencies ranging from 9.59 to 11.99%.22

4. Conclusion
The synthesis of cesium lead iodide nanocrystals using DPPA as the capping agent showed improvement on the perovskite properties. Relatively small DPPA-capped nanocubes 14 nm in size on average, possessing a cubic crystalline phase and having a longer lifetime were successfully synthesized. The properties of the DPPA-synthesized nanocrystals were exploited in a simple solar cell device configured under normal laboratory conditions. The fill factor and power conversion efficiency were 38% and 2.0%, respectively, showing that the DPPA-synthesized perovskite nanocrystals are good candidates for modern technological needs covering various areas such as those targeting green energy.
