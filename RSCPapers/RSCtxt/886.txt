    , Accepted 6th June 2018First published on 8th June 2018AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic and all-inorganic metal halide perovskites have been one of the most intensively studied materials during the last few years. In particular, research focusing on understanding how to tune the photoluminescence features and to apply perovskites to optoelectronic applications has led to a myriad of new materials featuring high photoluminescence quantum yields covering the whole visible range, as well as devices with remarkable performances. Having already established their successful incorporation in highly efficient solar cells, the next step is to tackle the challenges in solid-state lighting (SSL) devices. Here, the most prominent is the preparation of white-emitting devices. Herein, we have provided a comprehensive view of the route towards perovskite white lighting devices, including thin film light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) and hybrid LEDs (HLEDs), using perovskite based color down-converting coatings. While synthesis and photoluminescence features are briefly discussed, we focus on highlighting the major achievements and limitations in white devices. Overall, we expect that this review will provide the reader a general overview of the current state of perovskite white SSL, paving the way towards new breakthroughs in the near future.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic and all-inorganic metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a game-changer material in optoelectronics.1–3 On the one hand, nearly defect-free, crystalline films prepared using solvent-based techniques at low temperature exhibit a broad absorption spectrum, a long-range ambipolar transport, and efficient charge collection upon excitation, yielding solar cells with a verified record efficiency of 22.1%.4 On the other hand, perovskite materials also show efficient charge injection regardless of the type of electrode and/or charge injection layers, a high charge carrier diffusion length, and an efficient electron–hole recombination process.5–8 What is more, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of metal halide perovskites has significantly been enhanced, reaching average values of ca. 40% and 90% in bulk thin films9,10 and nanoparticles (NPs),11,12 respectively. Finally, this comes along with a narrow emission (20–50 nm) and an easy emission tunability covering the whole visible range.13
Since the pioneering work of Friend and co-workers in 2014,14 the features above have been fueling the interest in developing perovskite-based solid-state lighting (SSL), achieving impressive device figures-of-merits.15,16 For instance, the so-called thin-film perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have reached external quantum efficiencies (EQE) as high as 8.5% and current efficiencies of ca. 43 cd A−1 using a multi-layered device architecture – i.e., glass/SOCP (100 nm)/CH3NH3PbBr3 (∼100–200 nm)/TPBI (50 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al (100 nm); SOCP refers to self-organized conductive polymer, CH3NH3PbBr3 is methylammonium lead tribromide, TPBi is 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) – and reducing the grain size of perovskite films by means of a nanocrystal pinning approach.17 A brightness record of 20000 cd m−2 has been reached tailoring charge injection with metal oxide layers18 and even flexible PeLEDs have been realized.19 Even though this has been achieved in green devices using CH3NH3PbBr3 films, many authors have shown that color tunability is easily realized by controlling the chemical composition, the morphology, and the quantum confinement effects.13 To refer to some examples, Tan et al.14 fabricated infra-red PeLEDs (λmax = 754 nm) using a 15 nm thin layer of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, sandwiched between titanium dioxide (TiO2) and poly(9,9′-dioctyl-fluorene) (F8) layers, effectively confining radiative excitons in the perovskite layer. They reported an irradiance of 13.2 W sr−1 m−2 at a current density of 363 mA cm−2 and EQEs of 0.76%. Sadhanala and co-workers20 demonstrated blue-green (λmax = 425–570 nm) devices using MAPb(BrxCl1−x)3 [0 ≤ x ≤ 1] perovskites prepared from lead acetate. Blue devices (λmax = 440–490 nm) can also be prepared using all-inorganic perovskite materials – i.e., CsPbX3; X is a halide. Li et al.21 reported PeLEDs with a brightness of 8.7 cd m−2, (λmax = 480 nm) while Song et al.22 achieved a brightness of 742 cd m−2 (λmax = 455 nm) using CsPbX3 quantum dots (QDs). Interestingly, even though there are a few reports on intrinsic white-emitting perovskite materials (Section 2.2),23 they have not been applied to PeLEDs yet. Here, the preparation of bright and efficient blue PeLEDs is one of the main roadblocks towards white devices as described in Section 3.
Another approach in perovskite SSL is their use as color down-converting coatings applied to blue-, UV-, and cold white-LED chips in hybrid light-emitting diodes (HLEDs).16,24 Snaith and co-workers25 pioneered this approach in 2015, showing excellent white sources using a combination of several color down-converting films.
Since then, the progress of this strategy has been astonishing. For instance, Bi and co-workers31 reported high efficiencies (∼85 lm W−1) along with a color rendering index (CRI) of 89 for warm white LEDs bearing red CsPb(Br1.44I1.56) QDs, while Yoon et al.32 achieved an outstanding CRI of 96 by employing five different types of perovskite QDs onto a blue LED. Nonetheless, some major drawbacks remain, such as device stability, moisture and oxygen sensitivity, and lack of stable and bright blue-emitting perovskites. Several approaches, such as encapsulation in mesoporous silica (MS),33–35 ethyl cellulose (EC),36,37 polystyrene (PS),25 and alkyl phosphate matrices,38 among others, have been proposed to protect the perovskite core. Despite efforts, the longest stability reported so far by Sun et al.33 is 227 h at a driving current of 20 mA. As such, the field offers challenging opportunities and much room for improvement as summarized in Section 4.
Following these lines, the aim of this manuscript is to highlight the most significant advances towards white emission in the field of perovskite SSL, involving both PeLEDs and HLEDs. The main intention is to complement recent excellent reviews focused on the synthesis and characterization of perovskites, as well as their application to monochromatic lighting devices.2,15,39–42 To this end, we have divided this contribution into four follow-up sections including (i) a brief description of both monochromatic and white-emitting perovskites, highlighting the best materials and successful concepts to date – Section 2, (ii) a part focused on white PeLEDs, in which we briefly introduce the device architecture and mechanism as well as highlight the importance of developing blue PeLEDs and the strategy towards white PeLEDs – Section 3, (iii) the recent advances in white HLEDs using perovskite color down-converting filters, in which the matrix, fabrication method, ambient stability, and light quality are key aspects thoroughly discussed – Section 4, and (iv) a conclusion and outlook based on the main results acquired from the literature up to this moment – Section 5.
2. Brief description of emitting perovskites
2.1 Monochromatic perovskites
In general, perovskites are a class of compounds that adopt an octahedral ABX3 structure, where A and B are cations of various valence and ionic radii, and X is an anion – Fig. 1. For metal-halide hybrid perovskites, the A component is usually a monovalent organic cation (i.e., methylammonium (CH3NH3+ = MA+) or formamidinium (HC(NH2)2+ = FA+)), a metal cation (typically Cs+) or a mixture. The B component is often a divalent metal cation – e.g., Pb2+, Sn2+ or a mixture – and the X component is a halide anion – e.g., Cl−, I−, Br− or a mixture thereof.43–49 The synthesis is usually performed in solution, from which bulk (e.g., single crystals and films), layered or nanostructured (e.g., QDs, nanoplatelets and nanowires) perovskite materials can be obtained – Fig. 1.50–52 Noteworthily, Liu et al.53 and Shi et al.54 have also shown that large-sized perovskite single crystals with dimensions exceeding 10 mm with a high crystalline quality can easily be grown. The rich chemistry and structural versatility of metal halide perovskites enable numerous ways to control the band gap by, for example, changing metals, halides, and organic components. The interested reader will find more information in the following reviews.39,40,55–61 Detailed description about the photophysical features of perovskites is also provided in the following reviews.2,41,62

In the following, we will provide a short overview of the type of emitting perovskites with respect to their structure, highlighting the best materials and limitations in terms of their photophysical features.

2.1.1 3D perovskites. 
The first 3D perovskite films, which consisted of CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles (NPs) incorporated into the porous alumina layer, were reported in 201263 and since then research has intensively developed. Many methods have been used to prepare hybrid and all-inorganic halide perovskite thin films, such as spin-coating, one-step and sequential deposition, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), silk-screen printing, thermal evaporation and chemical vapor deposition.45,62,64,65 A high PLQY of 70% has been reported for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films on spectrosil®, annealed in air, and capped with a thin PMMA layer by Deschler et al.,66 while different approaches, such as mixing Cs and MA cations, have shown to increase the PLQY67–69 – Fig. 2. Notably, there is a large deviation in the PLQY values attained in 3D perovskites, which is mainly attributed to the film preparation procedure. In general, both PLQY and EQE are greatly limited due to the effective competition from the defect-states trapping (first order decay process) with the slow electron–hole bimolecular radiative recombination (second order decay process), highlighting the necessity of high purity thin, pin-hole free films – Section 3. The solubility of precursors, the preparation conditions (atmosphere, temperature), the type of substrates and/or the use of interfacial layers are parameters that limit the quality of the perovskite films.18

2.1.2 2D and quasi-2D perovskites. 
Decreasing the dimensionality introduces a significant versatility to incorporate different organic cations as templates to produce new structures.60 Here, there are two types of 2D perovskites that consist of single-70,71 and multi-layered72–74 2D perovskites – Fig. 1. Noteworthily, the latter have shown enhanced chemical stability compared to 3D perovskite materials, as the longer organic cations are hydrophobic, rendering the devices moisture stable. In addition, 2D perovskites exhibit a high crystallinity along with PLQYs > 80% for multi-layered structures, covering the visible spectrum – Fig. 2.
In general, these materials can be tuned through multiple pathways: (i) number of layers, (ii) halide anion and metal cation, and (iii) the type of organic spacer cation.51,75 To highlight several examples, Kamminga et al.76 prepared layered perovskites by replacing MA in 3D MAPbI3 with different phenylalkylammonium cations. They showed a change in the band gap from 2.12 to 2.48 eV on increasing the alkyl chain length. Interestingly, Hu et al.77 studied the composition dependence of the structural parameters and their effect on the white-light luminescence properties of mixed-halide 2D hybrid perovskites as described in Section 2.2.
Finally, quasi-2D layered structure perovskites of the general formula (RNH3)2An−1MnX3n+1 – i.e., n = 1 refers to a pure 2D layered structure and n = ∞ refers to a 3D structure – are formed when the cations do not fit in the MX6 octahedral cavity. These layered nanostructures can be considered as natural quantum-well structures, where the inorganic layers act as “wells” and the organic molecules act as “barriers”. As a result of the strong confinement in two dimensions and wide compositional flexibility, these layered perovskites are ideal for lighting applications. However, the efficiencies in PeLEDs are limited by poor carrier mobility.78
As far as the photoluminescence features are concerned, green/yellow/red CH3NH3PbI3 2D nanoplatelets exhibit PLQYs up to 20–30%,79 while blue CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoplatelets show a PLQY of ≈18% (λmax = 475 nm). Self-organization of these nanoplatelets led to the formation of green wire-like structures with a PLQY of 15% (λmax = 530 nm).50 In a different approach, thin square-shaped sheets of layered perovskite (CH3(CH2)nNH3)2PbBr4 (n = 3 and 7) have also been reported.80–82 The thinnest sheets (≈1.6 nm) showed deep-blue emission and a PLQY of 26% (λmax = 406 nm). The high PLQY, compared to <1% of the bulk crystal, is attributed to quantum confinement effects. Multi-layered structures of CH3NH3PbBr3 have exhibited the highest values of PLQY of 85%,50 while the corresponding inorganic CsPbBr3 has shown a PLQY of 78%.83 The chemical exfoliation method adopted by the group of Hintermayr et al.84 has led to a PLQY of 70% (λmax = 610 nm). With a similar multilayered structure, MAPbBr3 perovskites have shown PLQYs ranging from 80to 90% with an optimum of 5 layers.85,86 Mixed organic–inorganic perovskite MA2FAPB2I6Br films have reached a PLQY of 67% (λmax = 763 nm).87 With an emission centered at 410 nm, PLQYs of 46.5% have been reached with (PEA)2PbBr4 perovskites, whereas the equivalent (PEA)2PbI4 has yielded a PLQY of 34.5%.88
Finally, several authors have recently reported different approaches to overcome the problem of changing the morphology with the selected ligands and/or during the post-processing and purification methods. As an example, Yuan et al.89 described a one-pot synthesis approach towards nanoplatelets with 100–150 nm thickness and 1–4 μm length and a narrow blue emission with a PLQY of 53% (λmax = 410 nm). The PLQY can be improved up to 85% if smaller methyl amine ligands are used.


2.1.3 1D perovskites. 
Low-dimensional perovskites in the form of 1D nanowires (NWs) and nanorods (NRs) exhibit an excellent crystalline quality, long carrier diffusion lengths, and a high PLQY – Fig. 1 and 2. Therefore, they are expected to be potential building blocks for future perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. To date, only a few reports have been published on the preparation of halide perovskite NWs for LED,90,91 lasing92 and photodetector93 applications.
Although various preparation protocols are available to grow 1D hybrid perovskites, this field is still under active exploration. In short, they have generally been formed in situ on substrates using both physical and chemical methods. For instance, Wong et al.91 have demonstrated MAPbBr3 nanorods that were vertically grown on a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)-coated ITO substrate by using lead acetate and CH3NH3Br as reactants. The MAPbBr3 nanorods can be further converted to MAPbI3 by halide vapor exchange without changing the morphology, providing a facile way to accomplish a continuous color tuning. Chemical vapor deposition has also been shown as another effective method to produce NWs.94 The group of Wang et al.95,96 has also demonstrated a combined solution process and a vapor-phase conversion method to produce high-quality perovskite NWs. Very recently, several groups have investigated solvent-based routes to fabricate this family of perovskites. This involves a two-step procedure, in which a thin layer of lead acetate is prepared via spin-coating and further transformed into vertically aligned CH3NH3PbBr3 NR arrays and NWs by simple immersion in CH3NH3X solution and CH3NH3Br isopropyl alcohol at 80 °C52,94. Another synthetic approach for one-dimensional organic lead bromide perovskites (C4N2H14PbBr4) that has yielded moderate PLQY (20% for the bulk single crystals and 12% for the microscale crystals) has been proposed by Yuan et al.,30 in which the edge sharing octahedral lead bromide chains are surrounded by the organic cations to form the bulk assembly of core–shell quantum wires. This structure enables strong quantum confinement with the formation of self-trapped excited states that give efficient bluish white emission.
Oener et al.97 have introduced a method to fabricate free-standing solution-based vertical NWs with arbitrary dimensions, without embedding the perovskite inside a matrix, by applying a pressure gradient to extrude the solution from the free-standing templates. The free-standing NWs are shown to be single crystalline and exhibit a PLQY up to 29% (λmax = 535 nm). Zhang et al.98 have demonstrated the synthesis of brightly emitting colloidal CsPbX3 NWs using highly monodisperse CsPbBr3 NWs as templates to control the anion-exchange reaction. This led to NWs with PLQY ranging from 20% to 80%. Fluorescent NWs of CsPbBr3 have also been synthesized using a mixture of alkyl amines and a short alkyl carboxylic acid as growth medium. They demonstrated PLQYs ranging from 12% (λmax = 524 nm) to 77% (λmax = 496 nm), depending on the nanowires' width.99 Likewise, Zhang et al.90 have presented single crystal ultrathin CsPbBr3 NWs with a diameter of 2.2 ± 0.2 nm and length up to several microns with a high PLQY of 30% (λmax = 535 nm) after surface treatment.100
Generally speaking, the instability of 1D perovskites with respect to facing water and many polar organic solvents constitutes the main bottleneck for their synthesis and their broad application.


2.1.4 0D perovskites. 
0D perovskites involve QDs and NPs – Fig. 1.101 Perovskite QDs exhibit quantum-size effects, like size-dependent tunable bandgap that can span the entire visible spectrum, narrow full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) owing to the direct transition from the bandgap edge, high absorption cross section, fast radiative excited-state lifetime, and high PLQYs approaching unity at room temperature – Fig. 2.
The preparation of QDs has been achieved using two methods. Firstly, the ligand-assisted re-precipitation (LARP) technique was demonstrated by Zhong and co-workers.102 This method provides both hybrid perovskite QDs and all-inorganic QDs with PLQYs of 92% and 60%, respectively.11 The second one is the hot-injection technique, which involves the fast addition of a cold precursor (at ∼25 °C) to a hot metal–organic precursor (typically at temperatures >225 °C), enabling the separation of nucleation and growth processes.103 Thus, nearly monodisperse products with high crystallinity are obtained. For instance, CsPbX3 QDs exhibit emissions covering the entire visible spectral region on controlling the composition and crystal size, while at the same time exhibiting high PLQYs.22,50,53,104
The first report on colloidal NP synthesis was realized by Perez-Prieto and colleagues,105 where CH3NH3PbBr3 with nanoparticles of 6 nm in size was prepared via re-precipitation, exhibiting initially rather low PLQYs of 20% (λmax = 527 nm). However, they recently improved up to 83% on optimizing the molar ratio between the precursors and the ligands – i.e., the MABr/PbBr2 ratio.105 The synthesis can also be controlled by varying the temperature at which re-precipitation occurs, resulting in very high PLQYs ranging from 74% to 93%.12 In addition, an alkyl-amine-assisted re-precipitation strategy has been used to prepare materials with a PLQY of up to 70% at room temperature and low excitation fluencies.102 For the inorganic counterparts, CsPbX3 compounds have exhibited size-dependent band-gap tunability across the entire visible spectral region of 410–700 nm, with high PLQYs of up to 90%.50 For instance, Huang et al.11 employed an emulsion synthesis method for yielding PLQYs between 80 and 92%, while Li et al.106 prepared QDs following a supersaturated recrystallization process reaching PLQYs of 80%, 95%, and 70% along with FWHMs of 35, 20, and 18 nm for red, green, and blue emissions. Overall, it has been well established by now that the Br counterpart presents the optimum values (>80%).107,108
Despite the high PLQYs and colloidal stability of CH3NH3PbX3 NPs (>5 months in air under dark conditions105), a major shortcoming arises from the instability of CH3NH3PbX3 in polar solvents. To circumvent this, Vybornyi et al.79 synthesized CH3NH3PbX3 without the use of polar solvents. Although the precipitate displayed lower PLQYs (25–50%) than previously reported values for CH3NH3PbBr3 NPs, it demonstrated that an alternative synthesis route without polar solvents is possible.
In general, the moderate crystallinity and the appearance of different phases remain as a major issue, while the use of capping agents is a key aspect towards enhancing the radiative deactivation process.

2.2 White-emitting perovskites
Particularly interesting for optoelectronic applications are intrinsic white-emitting compounds, since problems related to self-absorption, phase separation, and color instability caused by mixing two or more different emitters are circumvented.109,110 Several groups have devoted much efforts in developing white perovskites as described in the following, andTable 1 provides an overview of their photoluminescence features.

2.2.1 2D perovskites. 
In 2014, Dohner and collaborators23 reported on 2D hybrid perovskites as novel white-emitting materials – Fig. 3. In a first contribution, they employed the organic cation N′-methylethane-1,3-diammonium (N-MEDA) to achieve 110-oriented perovskites layers. Owing to the corrugated nature of the (110) sheets, the primary ammonium group of N-MEDA can form hydrogen bonds with halides from two adjacent inorganic sheets, stabilizing the 110 structure. Upon 380 nm excitation, it showed a broad emission with a higher-energy shoulder peak at ∼420 nm, and a broader and more intense energy band with a maximum at 558 nm and a FWHM of 165 nm. Both x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.36/0.41 and a color correlated temperature (CCT) of 4669 K suggest its suitability for indoor lighting. The same group further synthesized mixed halide perovskites (N-MEDA)[PbBr4−xClx] (x = 0–1.2) in order to tune the emission color. Here, (N-MEDA)[PbBr3.5Cl0.5] presented x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.31/0.36 and a CCT of 6502 K along with a CRI of 85. The group hypothesized that the broad emission arises from excitons trapped through elastic lattice deformations. Strong vibronic coupling between excitons and the lattice can cause a broad emission since the excited state is highly distorted with respect to the structure of the ground state. Here, the corrugated sheets may allow for greater lattice distortion and stronger electron–nuclear coupling. Importantly, the organic cation plays a fundamental role in determining the formation and properties of the corrugated structure. Unfortunately, the PLQY was low, reaching a maximum value of 0.5% – Table 1.

In a second contribution, they greatly enhanced the PLQY by employing (EDBE)X2 (EDBE = 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylammonium); X = Cl, Br, and I) as the organic cation.111 Two materials were studied, namely (EDBE)PbBr4 and (EDBE)PbCl4, with a PLQY of 9% and 2%, respectively.111 The bromide derivative showed warm white emission with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.39/0.42, a FWHM of 215 nm, a CCT of 3390 K, and a CRI of 84. The enhanced photoluminescence features were attributed to the increase of the red-emitting part related to favourable distortions induced by bromide. For comparison purposes, (EDBE)PbCl4 exhibited x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.33/0.39, a FWHM of 208 nm, a CCT of 5509 K, and a CRI of 81 – Table 1. This hypothesis about the emission nature of single crystals of (C6H11NH3)2PbBr4 was later corroborated by (i) Yangui et al.113 using time-resolved photoluminescence techniques to establish the first insights into the emission mechanism, (ii) Hu et al.77 using ultrafast spectroscopy, which allows one to collect information on the fast free carrier trapping and the formation of self-trapped excitons,77 and (iii) Cortecchia et al.114 using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which shed light on energy inter-band transitions. Additional information on intrinsic white emitting perovskites can be found in the following review.42
All the groups have agreed that broadband emitting perovskites have the general chemical formula (R-NH3)2MX4 or (H3N-R-NH3)MX4, where R is an organic group, M a divalent metal, and X a halogen. The carriers are confined in the inorganic part formed by MX62− octahedra and the organic part acts like a potential barrier. Moreover, the high dielectric contrast between the organic and inorganic parts contributes to strengthen the 2D confinement by image charge effects. These mechanisms lead to the existence of excitons with a large binding energy of a few hundreds of meV. As a consequence, an important Stokes shift (ca. 100 nm) was noted, along with a broad emission – i.e., FHWM of 180–220 nm.
Following the example of Dohner and collaborators, several groups recently enlarged the list of white 2D layered perovskites – Table 1. Mao and co-workers112 synthesized a new kind of corrugated 2D perovskites with a distorted octahedral structure – Fig. 3. This group focused on three different perovskites, namely (i) α-(DMEN)PbBr4, where DMEN is 2-(dimethylamino)ethylamine, (ii) (DMAPA)PbBr4, where DMAPA is 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine, and (iii) (DMABA)PbBr4, where DMABA is 4-dimethylaminobutylamine. Interestingly, they found a linear correlation between structure distortion and the FWHM. The most distorted structure – α-(DMEN)PbBr4 – yielded the broadest emission, that is, a FWHM of 183 nm along with the longest excited-state lifetime of 1.39 s. Its emission showed x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.28/0.36, a CCT of 7863 K, and a CRI of 73. These values are similar to those of a fluorescent lamp. By comparison, (DMAPA)PbBr4 and (DMABA)PbBr4 presented shorter averaged lifetimes of 0.23 ns and 0.73 ns and x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.17/0.16 and 0.20/0.26, respectively. Moreover, the 100-oriented (DMAPA)PbBr4 and (DMABA)PbBr4 have much smaller distortion with a more regular octahedron. An enhanced distortion allows the population of more self-trapped exciton states, resulting in a broader emission and longer lifetimes. However, the authors did not disclose the PLQY.
In a second contribution, they tuned the white emission in single cation three-layered 2D perovskites (EA)4Pb3Br10−xClx (EA: ethylammonium, x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9.5, and 10).115 Because of the larger size of the cation, these materials showed a high distortion level in their inorganic structures, with EA4Pb3Cl10 having a much larger distortion than EA4Pb3Br10. This results in broadband white-light and narrow blue emission for the Cl- and Br-based perovskites, respectively. As such, the white emission can be modulated upon changing the halide concentrations. In particular, EA4Pb3Br2Cl8 and EA4Pb3Br0.5Cl9.5 showed x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.30/0.35 and 0.30/0.38 along with FWHMs of 187 and 228 nm, respectively.
Neogi et al.116 synthesized a novel broadband emitting hybrid 2D perovskite (CyBMA)PbBr4 based on the highly flexible cis-1,3-bis(methylaminohydrobromide)cyclohexane (CyBMABr) cation. The reason underlying the uncommon choice is the bidentate nature of CyBMABr, which brings the layers of [PbBr6]4− octahedra closer compared to the other monodentate ligands. This perovskite showed a broad emission centered at 400 nm and x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.23/0.29, which correspond to a cold white light – Fig. 3. In order to obtain an emission closer to the white point, they also synthesized mixed (CyBMA)PbBr4−xClx perovskites. With a Br:Cl ratio of 9:1, they noted x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.25/0.30.
Thirumal et al.117 highlighted the role of both organic and inorganic components in a solution-processed phenylethylammonium lead chloride [(C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbCl4] perovskite, proving that white emission is independent of surface defects – Fig. 3. This material provided emission with a CRI of 84, x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.37/0.42, and a CCT of 4426 K. Unfortunately, the PLQY was reported to be <1% – Table 1. Likewise, Wu et al.118 reported on a CRI as high as 93 with a white 2D perovskite based on N-(3-aminopropyl)-imidazole-PbCl4. This material presents a highly distorted structure, leading to an emission covering a broad range of 400–800 nm (Fig. 3), unfortunately accompanied by a PLQY of only 1%.


2.2.2 1D perovskites. 
White 1D perovskites have recently been reported by Yuan et al.30 in the form of both bulk and micro-crystals. They consisted of C4N2H14PbBr4, in which the edge sharing octahedral lead bromide chains are surrounded by the organic cations to form the bulk assembly of core–shell quantum wires. They reported PLQYs of 20% and 12% for the bulk and micro-crystals, respectively. They are the highest reported so far – Fig. 4. The emission covers a broad part of the visible range with λmax = 475 nm for both materials and x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.21/0.27 and 0.21/0.28 for bulk and microscale crystals, respectively.

2.2.3 0D perovskites. 
The first intrinsic white perovskite QD was reported by Teunis et al. in 2016.119 Here, methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite nanoclusters with an average size of 1.5 nm (∼2 unit cells) were synthesized via a new colloidal synthetic method. As described in Section 2.1, QDs present narrow band-edge emission, which makes them appealing for display applications, but renders the fabrication of white-emitting QDs difficult. As such, the authors exploited defect trap states to induce low-energy emission features.
In detail, they proposed to coat the perovskite surface with primary amines, which are known to be weak σ-donating, L-type ligands. The bonding with Pb2+ would lead to the formation of electron trapping mid-gap states located below the conduction band of the bulk material, resulting in a broad emission upon UV-excitation. Moreover, the broadband emission is promoted by the high relative number of atoms on the surface that increases as their size decreases. The white perovskites presented emission with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.30/0.35 (λmax = 503 nm), a PLQY of 12%, and an excited-state lifetime of 20 ns.

3. White-emitting PeLEDs
3.1 General view
In general, the device architecture of PeLEDs can be classified into multi- and single-layered device structures – Fig. 5. A typical multi-layered PeLED consists of (i) a front transparent electrode – e.g., ITO, (ii) electron/hole transport and hole/electron blocking layers, (iii) a perovskite emitting layer, and (iv) a back electrode – e.g., Au or Al. The thickness, energy levels, and interfaces are optimized to maximize the electron–hole recombination at the perovskite layer, where the exciton relaxes radiatively. Therefore, the device mechanism is similar to that of OLEDs, in which charge injection and transport as well as radiative electron–hole recombination are performed by different layers.
 Fig. 5  Device configuration of multi- and single-layered PeLEDs, including typical example of materials used as components for the different layers used in the devices. 
A single-layered PeLED is composed of a blend of perovskite and a polymer matrix directly sandwiched between anode and cathode electrodes – Fig. 5. Here, both charge injection and transport are assisted by the formation of electrical double layers at the electrode interfaces. This behavior is unique in perovskites as they combine the abilities of (i) performing an efficient p- and n-doping at high applied voltages and (ii) generating a strong electric dipole moment caused by the redistribution of the ions present in the lattice.120 Indeed, this behavior and how it rules the devices' mechanism are still under debate.121–126 Both theoretical and experimental studies suggest the ion-migration under an applied electric field. In brief, computational simulations predict vacancy-assisted diffusion activation energies of 0.33–0.50 and 0.55–0.80 eV for halide and MA+ vacancies, respectively. In contrast, the Pb2+ is assumed to be immobilized with activation energies >2 eV.127–129 In parallel, Wen et al. have demonstrated the accumulation of halide and MA+ diffusion at the interface when an external electric field is applied using fluorescence imaging,130 while Costa and co-workers16,126 have combined static/dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and different poling schemes to demonstrate the dynamic behavior of thin film perovskite devices. Here, they found that the dynamic mechanism of single-layered devices is very similar to that of light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), that is, (i) the formation of electrical double layers at the electrodes’ interfaces, (ii) the slow growth of the doped regions assisted by the ion reorganization, and (iii) the formation of a non-doped region in the bulk. This was corroborated using both organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic perovskites. In addition, Zhang et al. supported this conclusion in multilayered devices using EIS.131
In light of the above mentioned, it is not surprising that the first examples of single-layered perovskite lighting devices were prepared following the LEC concept.16 In brief, Costa et al.16 reported the first perovskite LEC, blending MAPbBr3 and FAPbBr3 NPs with an ionic polyelectrolyte – i.e., poly(ethylene oxide) derivative and LiTf – using an easily up-scalable spray-coating technique. Here, the authors achieved a remarkable stability over months when the device was stored under ambient conditions. Li et al.132 demonstrated that the inorganic salt has a dramatic impact on the device performance, achieving an order of magnitude enhancement in brightness using a blend with linear poly(ethylene oxide). Other approaches involve the use of an electroactive polymer matrix. For instance, Ling et al.89 and Li et al.133 realized highly efficient devices by combining perovskite nanoplatelets with (poly(9-vinylcarbazole):2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole) (PVK:PBD) or by blending perovskite NPs with a polyimide precursor dielectric (PIP). More detailed information is provided in the following reviews.16,120,134,135
Regardless of the type of device architecture, a key aspect in the perovskite lighting field is the preparation of pin-hole free films using solvent-based deposition techniques. The latter are critical as they decrease the overall conductivity, increase current leakage, and increase non-radiative recombination paths. These aspects limit the efficiency of the PeLEDs. In the following, we provide a general overview of the most recent findings.
Different solution-deposition routes to enhance the coverage of the emitter, such as altering the crystallization rates and inducing nucleation, have been reported.136–138 Here, the choice between TiO2/ZnO and PEDOT:PSS underneath layers is critical in terms of crystallinity, roughness, and growth rate of the perovskite films. In general, compact TiO2 layers lead to large size crystalline domains with high roughness and PEDOT:PSS layers to an amorphous and compact layer with small sized crystalline grains. While the latter are desired for PeLED fabrication, there is a prominent exciton quenching that can be prevented using interfacial polymer layers, such as polythiophenes. A similar approach is generally used with TiO2/ZnO layers to form surface dipoles increasing the work function and, in turn, charge injection. Efforts to further enhance the EQE were focused on increasing the electron mobility using ZnO along with surface modifiers (e.g., poly(ethylenimine) (PEI)), and using a hole transport layer with a high electron affinity – e.g., poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-(4-(3-methylpropyl))diphenylamine), TFB.14 Since then, great advance has been made, raising the device EQE up to 11.7%, using solution processed self-organized multiple quantum wells.87
A different approach is to embed the perovskite materials in a polymer matrix. For instance, pin-hole-free films were obtained from polyimide or poly(ethylene oxide)133 matrices and improved luminescence performance was displayed. Additionally, it has been suggested that the formation of metallic Pb – e.g., from incomplete perovskite formation at stoichiometric precursor ratios – may lead to non-radiative decay pathways originating from defect trap states, thus posing a challenge to highly efficient devices. Another approach to improving film quality relies on additives that reduce the solubility of the precursors (anti-solvents) and induce fast nucleation, resulting in reduced grain size and increased uniformity and coverage of the perovskite film.
All of the aforementioned indicates that there is plenty of room for improvement with respect to (i) a well-thought proposition of the best device architecture – e.g., electron/hole charge and injection layers, additives and matrices for the emitting layer, and poling schemes – and (ii) fully understand the device mechanism which, in principle, resembles that of LECs. In addition, the design of different emitting perovskites is also a crucial aspect – Section 2. The most remarkable achievements are briefly provided in the introduction section. The interested reader is requested to read the excellent reviews dealing with a comprehensive description of the above aspects.130,131 As a complement to them, Section 3.2 provides a description of the recent achievements in white-emitting thin film perovskite devices.
3.2 White PeLEDs
Similar to LECs or OLEDs, the major bottleneck towards white PeLEDs is the fabrication of stable and efficient blue devices.134,139–145 In this respect, numerous groups are investigating the underlying reasons for the instability of blue PeLEDs focusing on designing more stable perovskite materials and enhancing the layers’ interfaces.146 To date, blue PeLEDs have only been achieved using all-inorganic perovskites. In 2015, Song and co-workers22 developed CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) QDs and implemented them in devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/QDs/TPBi/LiF/Al architecture. The QDs were synthesized by the hot-injection method and the luminescence wavelength was tuned by both the size of the QDs and the variation of the halide composition. The blue devices revealed a luminance of 742 cd m−2 with an EQE of 0.07%.
Soon after this contribution, Li and co-workers21 presented a multi-layered device (ITO/ZnO/CsPbCl1.5Br1.5/TFB/MoO3/Ag). The key aspect of this work is a new solution-processed thin film based on applying a new trimethylaluminum vapor-based crosslinking method. This leads to hard films that are stable upon depositing a charge-injection layer on top. Even though green, orange, and red devices showed good performances, blue devices showed an emission centered at 480 nm, a brightness of 8.7 cd m−2, and an EQE of 0.0074%.
Pan et al.148 presented another approach, preparing films of CsPbX3 QDs capped with a halide ion pair – e.g., di-dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB), a relatively short ligand that facilitates carrier transport in the QD film. The synthesis of these films was performed through a ligand-exchange strategy that included an intermediate step to desorb protonated oleylamine (OAm), which enabled the utilization of halide-ion-pair-capped CsPbBr3 QDs in green PeLEDs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly(9-vinlycarbazole) (PVK)/QDs/2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzenetriyl)tris[1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole] (TPBi)/LiF/Al, achieving a maximum EQE and luminance of 3.0% and 330 cd m−2, respectively. By optimizing the device architecture, they capped CsPbX3 QDs with a halide ion pair, achieving blue PeLEDs (λmax = 490 nm; FWHM = 19 nm) with an EQE of 1.9% at 5.5 V and a maximum luminance of 35 cd m−2 at 7.5 V.148 Recently, Suh et al.149 prepared PeLEDs based on CsPbX3 using a ligand exchange strategy between aromatic acid/amine capping agents in a regular ITO/PEDOT:PSS/QDs/TPBi/LiF/Al device structure. This led to a luminances of 1889 cd m−2 together with current efficiencies of 6.28 cd A−1.
Despite efforts on blue PeLEDs, the first white PeLED was only recently presented by Yao and co-workers147 – Fig. 6. The authors obtained blue perovskites by mixing Cl− and Br− halides in CsPbBrxCl3−x, with x varying from 0 to 3, featuring interesting blue emission features. This emission was modulated taking into account that pure CsPbBr3 and pure CsPbCl3 show emissions centered at 510 nm and 390 nm associated to PLQYs of 80% and 1%, respectively. Hence, a mixture of the two halides can furnish a compromise between high PLQY and blue emission. Using spin-coating from different solvents, the crystal grain size of perovskite films were controlled to be around 15 nm. By designing the preferred device structure – i.e., ITO/NiOx/CsPbBrxCl3−x/TPBi/LiF–Al, the brightness reached 350 cd m−2 and the current efficiency 0.18 cd A−1. Starting from the bright blue device, the authors demonstrated a white LED by blending an orange emitting conjugated polymer – i.e., poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH:PPV) – with CsPbBrxCl3−x QDs as the active layer, using a similar device structure – i.e., ITO/NiOx/CsPbBrxCl3−x:MEH:PPV(9:1)/TPBi/LiF:Al. Nickel oxide (NiOx) was proposed as the hole-transport layer as it provides enhanced thermal and chemical stability which increases the reproducibility yields. The commonly used electron-transport and hole-blocking material TPBi was directly deposited on the active layer – Fig. 6. The authors studied active layers with several weight ratios ranging from 1:0, 18:1, 9:1, 3:1, and 0:1 of CsPbBrxCl3−x:MEH:PPV, noting that the 9:1 device presented the optimum Dexter and Föster resonance energy transfer processes from the formed excitons of the perovskite to the conjugated polymer. This device showed encouraging performances including white light with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.33/0.34 and a maximum brightness of ca. 100 cd m−2 at 7 V – Fig. 6.

4. White HLEDs using perovskite-based color down-converting coatings
4.1 General view
White HLEDs are fabricated using three configurations, namely (i) UV-LED chip coated with a mixture of organic phosphors that totally converts the UV light to a broad white light, (ii) blue-LED chip coated with color down-converting phosphors that partially absorb blue light and emit yellow, green, and red lights, and (iii) a cold white LED that is transformed into a warm white LED using a red coating.24,147,150–160 Owing to the presence of rare earth materials and the moderate color quality of all-inorganic white LEDs, increasing production cost, sustainability issues, and health concerns are fueling efforts to develop HLEDs. To date, luminous efficiencies of up to 120 lm W−1 and high color quality with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.30–3/0.30–3, CRI >85, and CCT from 2700 K to 6500 K have been achieved.24,135,154–157,159,160 However, the device stability is typically limited to a maximum of a few hundred hours, with the exception of organometallic complexes, which reached more than 1000 hours.135,156,160
As key aspects, the organic phosphors must feature high photo- and thermal-stability, PLQYs close to unity, and high photon flux saturations, while the matrix must efficiently protect the organic phosphors from the environmental moisture. As explained in the introduction, the photophysical features of perovskites are ideal for HLEDs. Moreover, the narrow FWHM of monochromatic perovskites makes them excellent candidates for display applications. To date, QDs are the rising star material. Unfortunately, the major drawback is the poor stability related to moisture and air. Detailed information about the state-of-the-art of this limitation can be found in the following excellent reviews.27,57,58 As far as the matrix is concerned, polymers, such as poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) or an epoxy resin, are usually used. Typically, a highly viscous solution is directly dried on top of the LED chip forming the perovskite coating. An overview of the employed matrices is provided in Table 2.

In the following, we provide a comprehensive overview of WLEDs with perovskite-based color down-converting coatings. The approaches followed to date are commonly two, namely (i) a red perovskite coating placed onto a commercial cold white LED (GaN or InGaN/YAG:Ce2+) to improve the light quality and (ii) mixing either green and red perovskites or green perovskite with another red phosphor coating that is placed on top of a blue emitting LED chip. A more seldom approach consists of employing a UV LED coated with a color filter based on blue, green and red perovskites. Here, both the low efficiency of UV-LEDs and the low stability of blue perovskites (Section 2) are the major bottlenecks. The overview of perovskite-based white HLED performance is provided in Table 3.

4.2 Perovskites as color down-converting materials

4.2.1 HLEDs using cold white chips. 
In 2016, Zhou et al.161 synthesized a series of red CsPbBrxI3−x QDs obtained via the hot injection technique and presented a cubic shape. Among the QDs, CsPbBrI2 QDs featured a stable red emission (λmax = 656 nm) with a PLQY of 65%. They were mixed with PMMA in chloroform and then spin-coated on top of a yellow-emitting phosphor-in-glass, that is, YAG:Ce2+ sintered in a low-melting glass. The color down-converting layer was placed on top of a blue InGaN-chip. This device exhibited a luminous efficiency of 58 lm W−1 associated to x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.33/0.32, a CCT of 5907 K, and a CRI of 90 at a driving current of 20 mA. Additionally, the efficiency remained remarkably stable even at high driving currents, yielding, for example, 40 lm W−1 at 350 mA. Nonetheless, no information about the device stability over time was provided. In a follow-up work,162 they focused on the mixed red-emitting CsPbBr1.2I1.8 QDs. This improved the stability compared to, for example, CsPbI3 QDs.39 This was ascribed to the fact that the addition of bromide yields a stronger and more stable cubic structure. The material was also obtained via the hot-injection method and presented λmax = 628 nm, a FWHM of 27 nm, and a PLQY of 69%. Additionally, its PLQY showed only a 10% change after 30 days of storage under ambient conditions. The QDs were used as red-emitting phosphors to modify a commercial white LED, reaching high luminous efficiencies of 78.4 lm W−1 and an excellent CRI of 92 under an operation current of 20 mA.
Singh and co-workers163 also showed another example of refining for red Cs-based perovskite QDs. Here, the authors proposed the CsPbBr0.9I2.1 QDs as the color down-converting phosphor. The QDs featured λmax = 650 nm, a FWHM of 35 nm, and a PLQY of 70%. Here, the QD solution was mixed with silicon resin in hexane and dropped onto the LED chip. The devices exhibited a luminous efficiency of 19 lm W−1, x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.40/0.37, a CCT of 3328 K, and a CRI of 85 at 20 mA. The device stability over time was unfortunately not mentioned.
Bi et al.31 addressed the poor stability of CsPbBrxI3−x QDs by proposing the fabrication of hybrid lighting devices directly from QD solutions. This prevents photoluminescence quenching due to aggregation of QDs in solid-state and the so-called coffee ring effect, taking place during QD solidification.164,165 Firstly, the YAG:Ce2+ phosphor was mixed with PMMA and placed onto a blue LED chip. Next, the QD solution was mixed with PMMA (15 wt%) in chloroform, and injected onto the modified chip. Finally, the chip was sealed with glue. The x/y CIE color coordinates were tuned by changing the amount of iodine and bromine, as well as by adjusting the concentration of QDs in the solution. As such, they fabricated warm white (3717 K), neutral white (5227 K), and cool white (7851 K) LEDs using a driving current of 20 mA. Moreover, the luminous efficiency was around 85 lm W−1 with CRI > 75.
Recently, Di and co-workers34 further exploited the use of CsPb(Br1−xIx)3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) QDs proposing the post-coating of the surface with mesoporous silica (MS) to enhance their stability. The silica shell not only protected the QDs from air and humidity, but also hindered the anionic exchange, allowing the use of mixed halide perovskites. As a proof of success, the emission was maintained for months under ambient storage conditions. Two different approaches to get white light were followed, namely (i) the embedded red QDs were then stacked on a yellow emitting YAG:Ce2+ phosphor-in-glass substrate using screen-printing, and (ii) green CsPbBr3 and red CsPbBr1.2I1.8 QDs were placed onto a blue LED chip. The first approach stood out with a luminous efficiency of 75 lm W−1, x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.34/0.32, a CCT of 5198 K, and a CRI of 92. In contrast, the second one achieved a luminous efficiency of only 14 lm W−1, x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.33/0.33, a CCT of 5893, and a CRI of 82. This was ascribed to the better stability and optical properties, as well as the enhanced thermal management of the inorganic yellow phosphor.
Finally, Chen and co-workers166 fabricated MAPbBr3−xIx (x = 0.5 and 1.0, with λmax of 600 nm and 620 nm, respectively) perovskites to coat a YAG:Ce2+ phosphor-in-glass on top of a blue GaN chip. They achieved warm white LEDs with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.42/0.37 and 0.41/0.40, and CCT of 2908 K and 3525 K for MaPbBr2.5I1.5 and MaPbBr2.0I1.0, respectively. Although the operating voltage was quite high (10 V), the WLED showed only around a 20% loss in the electroluminescence intensity after seven days – Fig. 7.

4.2.2 HLEDs using blue chips and green/red phosphors. 
In 2016, Li et al.106 developed highly emissive CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) QDs with a room temperature synthetic method based on supersaturated recrystallization. The latter takes place when the constrainedly sustentative non-equilibrium state of a soluble system is activated by an accident, such as stirring, or by the presence of impurities. Consequently, the supersaturated ions precipitate in the form of crystals until the system reaches an equilibrium state again. These QDs presented PLQYs of 70%, 95%, and 80% associated to FWHMs of 18, 20, and 35 nm for CsPbClBr2 (λmax = 478 nm), CsPbBr3 (λmax = 513 nm) and CsPbBr1.2I1.8 (λmax = 628 nm), respectively. The authors ascribed such high PLQY values to a halogen-rich surface that prevents exciton trapping. Green and red QDs were dispersed into a PMMA/chloroform solution to form QDs/PMMA coatings placed on a blue chip. Color tunable red-white, green-white, and warm-white LEDs were achieved by varying the green and red perovskite mass ratio. In particular, coatings with a green/red mass ratio of 1:5 provided devices with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.33/0.30 and a CCT of ca. 6000 K.
The same year Sun et al.33 encapsulated green and red CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr1.2I1.8 QDs in a silica matrix – Fig. 8 and Table 3. Such a strategy allowed preserving the PLQY (ca. 73%) from a few hours to over three months under environmental conditions. Here, the authors employed (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) as both the capping agent and the precursor for a silica matrix. All chemicals were mixed in a water-free synthesis system to form perovskite QDs. Once the synthesis was completed, the system was opened to the air and trace water vapor could react with APTES and provide its hydrolysis, leading to the formation of the matrix. In this way, a silica matrix was slowly formed, but the perovskite QD core was successfully protected. Using green and red QDs@silica composites in a mass ratio of 4:1 on top of a blue LED chip (λexc = 460–470 nm), white light-emitting devices with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.33/0.33 and a maximum luminous efficiency of 61.2 lm W−1 were achieved. At the driving current of 20 mA, the half-life of the devices was of 227 hours – Fig. 9. This represents the most stable white hybrid LED based on perovskite down-converting coatings up to date. Song et al.36 demonstrated that green-emitting CsPbBr3 QDs are compatible with Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ red-emitting phosphor for the fabrication of white HLEDs. In order to stabilize QDs, they were encapsulated pouring them into an ethyl cellulose solution under stirring – Table 3. Then, they were doctor bladed onto the PET substrate to yield 100 μm thick films featuring a PLQY of 37.2% and a FWHM of 21 nm. The inorganic red phosphor was blended in silicone and was placed on top of the QDs–cellulose layer. The white HLEDs presented a high luminous efficiency of 68 lm W−1 at 20 mA, a CCT of 7540 K, and a CRI of 68. In a follow-up contribution, they decided to address the stability issue of the red CsPb(Br0.4,I0.6)3 perovskite QDs by encapsulating them in ethyl cellulose.37 The material as synthesized presented emission with a narrow FWHM of 32 nm, x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.66/0.29, and a PLQY of 34.5%. The same approach as in their last contribution was used to enhance the QD stability. This procedure allowed the QDs to become water resistant with a PLQY of 19% after 200 h of immersion in water. To build HLEDs, the QDs–ethyl cellulose mixture was doctor bladed onto a PMMA polymeric substrate. The latter was detached from the substrate and placed onto a YAG:Ce2+ phosphor layer placed onto an InGaN blue LED chip. These devices showed a lower luminous efficiency (47 lm W−1) than in the previous works, but an enhanced light quality with a CRI of 90.3 and a CCT of 3897.9.

Di and collaborators35 adopted an approach similar to those proposed by Sun et al.,33 that is, encapsulation of the material in a MS shell. This was achieved by simply stirring the CsPbBr3 QDs together with commercial MS in a toluene solution for an hour under an inert atmosphere, followed by centrifugation and drying. After the encapsulation, the emission stability under water increased from 20 s to more than 3 h. Moreover, the PLQY of the encapsulated material decreased less than 10% under 120 h of UV irradiation. By comparison, the non-encapsulated perovskite showed a 40% PLQY loss. The group built white HLEDs using green CsPbBr3-MS materials and the red Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphor. As a second precaution to avoid thermal quenching, the group separated the phosphor layer from the blue chip. By varying the mass ratio, the absolute concentrations, and the driving current, the white emission was optimized. As the best performance, white LEDs with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.34/0.34 and an efficiency of 47.6 lm W−1 were reported at driving currents of 20 mA. Compared to Sun's work, a slightly less efficient emission – i.e., 47.6 lm W−1vs. 61.2 lm W−1, respectively – was reached with a comparable color quality at the same driving current. This can be explained upon comparing the PLQYs – i.e., 43% vs. 73% – of the QDs reported by Di's and Sun's groups, respectively. Surprisingly, the efficiency value reported by Di and co-workers for QDs-MS based blue LEDs was remarkably higher that reported in QDs-MS based cold white LEDs (Section 4.2.1) – i.e., 46.735 and 14.134 lm W−1, respectively, despite their comparable PLQYs. However, more information on device stability and performance over time is required to justify the results.
In another contribution, these authors affirm that PMMA is not sufficiently protective towards photo-oxidation owing to its relatively high oxygen diffusion coefficient.169 As such, they propose an inorganic glass matrix as the encapsulation system due to its good mechanical, thermal and chemical stability. CsPbBr3 QDs were precipitated in phosphor-silicate glass using conventional melt-quenching and a subsequent heat-treatment method – Table 3. The green glass presented a PLQY loss of only 47% compared to 80% of the non-encapsulated CsPbBr3 QDs when heated up to 125 °C. Additionally, they were found to be stable over 2 months under UV irradiation, while the non-encapsulated QDs degraded after 6 days. As a drawback, the PLQY of the encapsulated QDs was only 42%, while the non-encapsulated ones showed a PLQY of around 80%. In order to obtain white light, the commercial red phosphor Eu2+:CaAlSiN3 was spin-coated on top of the glass and put on top of a GaN blue chip. The emission spectrum remained mostly unchanged upon variation of the current from 20 to 150 mA, while the x/y CIE color coordinates changed from 0.40/0.38 to 0.39/0.35, the CCT from 3674 to 3809, and the CRI from 83.4 to 82.2, respectively. In addition, a good efficiency of 50.5 lm W−1 was reached at 20 mA.
The concept of an inorganic stabilizer was also followed by Park et al.,170 who fabricated green-to-red stable CsPbBr3−xIx (x = 0, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, and 3) inorganic silica composites using perhydropolysilazane (PHPS) as a SiO2 precursor – Table 3. In contrast to SiO2 formed by the alkoxysilane-based sol–gel process, PHPS-derived SiO2 exhibited higher chemical stability and hardness compared with tetramethylorthosilicate-based SiO2.172 As a confirmation, the composite QDs showed a PLQY loss of only 29.2% compared to 63% for the bare QDs when heated up to 125 °C. Additionally, the PLQY recovered to 96% of the original one on decreasing the temperature to 30 °C, while the bare QDs did not show any recovery. The green CsPbBr3–SiO2 composites with a PLQY of 74% (λmax = 510 nm) and the red CsPbBr1.2I1.8 with a PLQY of 79% (λmax = 616 nm) were then selected to fabricate white HLEDs, featuring x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.33/0.36, a CCT of 5623 K, and a luminous efficiency of 35.4 lm W−1 at a driving current of 20 mA.
Xuan et al.38 recently reported another approach to improve the water and thermal stability of CsPbBr3 QDs by coating them with an alkyl phosphate layer – Table 3. In detail, 1-tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA) was used both as the ligand for the CsPbBr3 QDs and as the precursor for the formation of alkyl phosphate. The as-prepared CsPbBr3/TDPA QDs presented a high PLQY (68%), a FWHM of 22 nm, as well as excellent water and thermal stability (>5 h immersion and 100 °C, respectively). The as-prepared QDs were combined with the red K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphors to fabricate a WLED that exhibited an efficiency of 63 lm W−1, x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.31/0.29, a CCT of 7072 K, and a CRI of 83. Furthermore, the luminous efficiency decreased at around 10% after 15 h of continuous operation at 20 mA.
Huang et al.167 developed another matrix, that is, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) – Table 3. The molecule combines the cage-like structure of an inorganic siloxane core with eight surrounding organic corner groups that allows for increased water resistance and hindered halide exchange. Green POSS-CsPbBr3 with a PLQY of 61% and red POSS-CsPb(Br/I)3 with a PLQY of 50% were placed onto a blue chip. The WLED presented x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.35/0.38, a CRI of 81, and a moderate efficiency of 14.1 lm W−1.
CsPbBr3−xIx QDs were also chosen by Li and collaborators173 to yield white HLEDs in conjunction with a red phosphor. However, the group highlighted the necessity of a controlled synthesis to increase the quality of the QDs in terms of PLQY and narrow emission width. As a matter of fact, groups working with, for instance, CsPbBr3 obtained quite different PLQYs, varying from ∼40% to 95%, depending on the synthetic method, the processing solvent, and the use of binders and encapsulating matrices174,175 – Section 2. Li's group reported that the growth of the QDs is better controlled in solvents with low polarity, such as tetra-ethylene glycol dibutyl ether.173 CsPbBr3 QDs showed a PLQY of 72% and were mixed in an epoxy resin with the red (Ba:Ca:Sr)3SiO5:Eu2+ and placed onto the LED chip. The WLED featured x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.33/0.36, a CRI of 93.2, and a CCT of 5447 K at a driving current of 20 mA.
In 2015, Pathak et al.25 reported the first white HLED using organic–inorganic perovskite nanocrystal (5–10 nm) mixed halides to deliver emission spanning the entire range of the visible spectrum with high PLQYs – Table 3. They fabricated perovskites with the composition CH3(C8H17)NH3PbX3 (MA(OA)PbX3), where X = Br, I, and Cl and the mole ratio of methylammonium:octylammonium (MA:OA) was settled to be 0.7:0.3. In addition to green and far-red films – i.e., (0.3OA:0.7MA)PbBr3 with λmax = 520 nm and (0.3OA:0.7MA)PbI3 with λmax = 775 nm – they synthesized the red mixed halide (0.3OA:0.7MA)PbI1.98Br1.02 with λmax = 678 nm. However, mixed crystal solutions of different halide compositions exhibited compositional instability with a continuous change in the emission spectrum over time. This instability is due to fast anionic exchange. To address this problem, they used a PS-encapsulation that strongly inhibited anionic exchange and rendered the emission stable. Next, they stacked green, red and far-red films on top of a 450 nm GaN LED in a cascade fashion. A broad emission covering the entire visible spectral region from 410 to 770 nm was noted with a CRI of 86 and a CCT of 5229 K. However, they did not disclose either the efficiency or the stability.
Yang et al.171 fabricated MAPbBr3/NaNO3 nanocomposites in order to enhance stability towards irradiation and moisture – Table 3. In particular, bare perovskites showed a 90% PLQY loss after 14 h of UV irradiation, while the nanocomposite retained 80% of the original emission (27%). To fabricate white LEDs, they mixed green-emitting MAPbBr3/NaNO3 nanocomposites with red K2SiF6:Mn4+ in a silicone resin. The device featured x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.28/0.32, a CRI of 86.6, and an efficiency of 22.4 lm W−1. The group also reported a lifetime of 4 hours under a driving current of 20 mA. To make a comparison, bare MAPbBr3 perovskites showed the same stability at a current of only 5 mA. However, the shorter lifetime compared to that reported by Sun and collaborators – vide supra – may be related to both the organic cation (all-inorganic perovskites are indeed more stable) and the less efficient encapsulation.
Finally Chen and co-workers176 studied the performances of a green phosphor Cs4PbBr6 as an alternative to the more common CsPbBr3. The perovskite was obtained by stirring a solution of synthesized material, presented micrometric scale, and a high PLQY of 40–45%. By comparison, micrometric CsPbBr3 yielded a value of 1%. The reason for the enhanced PLQY was ascribed to the rhombohedral geometry that maintains the structural stability in the excited state and originates direct recombination of excitons, leading to enhanced PLQYs as well as a narrow FWHM of only 15 nm. To highlight its promising role in optoelectronics, the group fabricated a white HLED with the green Cs4PbBr6 and the red phosphor Eu2+:CaAlSiN3. The color down-converting layers were blended in a silicone gel and directly painted onto a blue InGaN LED chip. At a driving current of 20 mA, a low CCT of 3675 K along with a high CRI of 83 was reported.


4.2.3 HLEDs using UV chips. 
Palazon et al.177 achieved white emission employing either blue/green emitting CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets/nanocubes and CsPbI3 nanosheets (λem = 610 nm) (all-perovskite approach) or the former with red Cu–In–Zn–S (CIZS) or CdSe/CdS giant-shell nanocrystals (GS) – Table 3. They used the same perovskite CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 in two different shapes to obtain a broader emission. In fact, they reported in a previous contribution that quantum confinement of CsPbB3 in nanoplatelets shifts the emission from 515 nm (nanocubes) to 465 nm.181 In the all-perovskite approach, their strategy to avoid anion exchange in solution consisted of applying an X-ray treatment under vacuum after each layer deposition. The all-perovskite approach yielded 1.9 Cd at the maximum excitation power of 800 mW, while the CIZS and GS yielded 28.6 and 114 Cd, respectively.
Yuan et al.182 proposed the micro/nanocrystalline quasi 2D perovskite (EDBE)PbBr4 (EDBE = 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylammonium)) as the single-component broadband phosphor for color down-converting UV LED light into white light. Compared to the bulk single crystal counterparts reported by Dohner et al. (Section 2),111 the microsized perovskite presents an easy and fast synthesis, much higher PLQY up to 18%, better thin film processability, as well as great stability in both solution processed neat films and doped polymer films. However, the crystals show a size of 1–3 μm and a rectangular shape, with a corrugated 110-oriented hybrid structure, and a high thermal stability of 260 °C. Its emission spanned the entire visible spectrum with a maximum at 523 nm and a FWHM of 171 nm that is attributed to the distorted excited states due to strong electron–phonon coupling in a deformable lattice, as well as inhomogeneous broadening resulting from the distribution of trap states – Section 2. To prepare white devices, a UV-LED (365 nm) was coated with a thin film of the phosphor mixed with cyanoacrylate. They were operated at 3.0 V and featured x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.30/0.42, a CCT of 6519 K, and luminances of 54.5, 68.1, and 114 cd m−2 at different UV light intensities of 3, 5, and 8 mW. Importantly, the spectrum showed little to no change upon variation of the applied voltage.
Zhang et al.178 reported a novel approach using organic–inorganic FAxMA1−xPbX3 (X = Br and I) QDs. By tuning the percentage of the organic cations in the QDs, emission spanning the whole visible range was obtained. Additionally, the material presented a high PLQY varying from 60 to 75%. In order to construct the white HLED, a cascade-like coating was followed. In detail, a layer of blue FA0.5MA0.5PbBr3 (λem = 438 nm and PLQY = 65%) was coated with a second layer of green FA0.2MA0.8PbBr3 (λem = 530 nm and PLQY = 60–75%) and a third layer of red FAPbI3 (λem = 665 nm and PLQY = 60–75%). The QDs were mixed with PMMA and then added to a silicon resin. Even at a high driving current of 350 mA, the devices featured a luminous efficiency of 40.2 lm W−1 along with x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.32/0.30 and a CRI of 85. In a qualitative way, this device configuration could be compared to that reported by Zhou et al., who used all-inorganic perovskite QDs. However, both the efficiency and the CRI resulted to be increased with the all-inorganic approach.

4.3 Market-related applications
Focusing on market-oriented applications, Yoon et al.32 developed six-color white HLEDs to reproduce true-to-life spectral distributions – Fig. 9. In detail, they considered the importance of the spectral distribution to our perception of colors and, in turn, they fabricated white HLEDs with two different approaches, namely (i) a RGB QD-based white HLED and (ii) a six color multipackage BCGYOR (blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, and red, respectively). The blue component (B) was provided by a commercial InGaN LED chip. As such, they synthesized the mixed halide perovskites CsPbBr2.25Cl0.75 (Cy, λmax = 495 nm), CsPbBr3 (G, λmax = 515 nm), CsPbBr1.5I1.5 (Y, λmax = 540 nm), CsPbBr1.95I1.05 (O, λmax = 578 nm) and CsPbBr1.05I1.95 (R, λmax = 635 nm). A toluene solution of either the RG or the CGYOR QDs was mixed with a UV binder (i.e., Norland optical adhesive 63® (NOA 63)), cured and placed onto the chip. Upon controlling the driving current, the CCT of both the RGB and BCGYOR WLEDs could be controlled, and varied from 2700 to 6500 K. In particular, the six color multipackage was driven at 120 mA and the tri-color at 60 mA, featuring luminous efficiencies of 62 and 56 lm W−1 along with CRIs of 95–97 and 4–19 depending on the CCT, respectively. Interestingly, both white colors have different color tones and hues even at similar CCT and CIE color coordinates, due to the different spectral power distributions of the white colors – Fig. 9. The group underlined the need for accurate analytical methods to characterize newly developed QD-based lighting systems considering their effects on the vision, color, and circadian sensors in the human retina.179 Two new parameters have been recently introduced to characterize smart WLEDs, namely the color fidelity index (CRf) and the color gamut index. In addition, the circadian efficacy of radiation (CER) should be taken into account to characterize smart sources that are able to vary their color during the day, according to the sunlight. This can be achieved by simply changing the driving current in a multi-package LED.

The group evaluated the response of three (BGR), four (BGAR), five (BCGAR) and six (BCGYOR)-Package LEDs using the perovskite-QDs mentioned above, where B is a blue InGaN chip. As expected, the six-package LED was able to reproduce the widest color gamut and scored significantly high CRf scores varying from 90 to 94 for all the CCTs. As such, it allows perceiving any color in the wavelength range of visible light, namely, close to sunlight.
Perovskite QDs are also under the hot spot for display applications. For the best performing display, the most important factor is color gamut, which is determined by the position in the CIE color diagram of R/G/B three colors. The x/y value of color gamut is regulated by the National Television Standard Committee (NTSC), and is 0.67/0.33, 0.21/0.71 and 0.14/0.08 for pure red, green, and blue, respectively (CIE 1931). The NTSC standard for commercial liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and wide-color-gamut televisions is approximately 72% and 96%, respectively.175 Perovskite QDs show outstanding results in terms of color gamut, owing to their narrow-band emission. In addition, their emission color can be easily tuned and their PLQYs are comparable to or higher than normal Cd-based QDs and inorganic phosphors.
Zhang et al.102 have reported already in 2015 on MAPbBr3 nanocrystals for display applications. Pulsed current white LED devices were fabricated by combining MAPbBr3 QDs and red rare-earth phosphor K2SiF6:Mn4+ with blue GaN chips, and they covered 130% of the NTSC space. Wang et al.104 used CsPbBr3−xIx (x = 0 and 1.8) green and red QDs in white-light LEDs for backlight application. The QDs were embedded in mesoporous silica nanoparticles to form highly stable composites mixed with silicon resin, and put onto a blue GaN chip. The white LEDs showed x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.24/0.28 and an efficacy of 30 lm W−1. The color gamut overlap of the NTSC space was approximately 113%, which was higher than that of a previously designed regular phosphor LED (NTSC 86%) and Cd-QD LED (NTSC 104%). Zhang et al.180 compared the green CsPbBr3 PQDs with a green β-SiAlON:Eu2+phosphor. The x/y CIE color coordinates and the NTSC space of phosphor and QD based white LEDs were 0.26/0.23 and 0.27/0.23, and 89% and 102%, respectively. Zhou et al.168 focused on PVDF films of green MAPbBr3 nanocrystals together with the red phosphor K2SiF6:Mn4+ on top of a blue chip. The reasons underlying the choice of PVDF were its high transparency and hydrophobic properties. The composite films exhibited indeed a PLQY of 94% and sound stability (>400 h) in water and under UV light. The WLEDs presented x/y CIE color coordinates of 0.27/0.28, a high efficiency of 109 lm W−1 and a wide color gamut of 121% NTSC standard at 20 mA current. As such, using PVDF as an encapsulating material may be the winning choice. All-in-all, those outstanding results encourage further research and implementation of perovskites for display and lighting. Unfortunately, none of the groups reported on white LEDs’ performances over time.
Bakr's group15 demonstrated the use of CsPbBr3 to generate white light for visible light communication (VLC) in 2016 – Fig. 10. This is an emerging technique that employs LEDs as a light source for data transmission. Compared to other lower-frequency communication methods, such as WiFi or Bluetooth, VLC is regarded as promising due to its high energy efficiency and security, unregulated communication spectrum, and no RF interferences.183,184 The green CsPbBr3 nanocrystals were drop-cast on top of a red nitride phosphor (LAM-R-6237, Dalian Luming Group) and placed on top of a blue GaN laser diode. Operating at 200 mA, the device generates a warm white light (CCT = 3236 K) with a CRI value of 89, as calculated after its emission passes through the phosphor mixture. The key parameter for VLC applications is the capacity of a communication channel, which, in turn, is related to bandwidth and lifetime. Short lifetimes and huge bandwidths are regarded as appealing. CsPbBr3 phosphor-converted light exhibits a relatively high bandwidth of 491.4 MHz, along with a short lifetime of 7.0 ± 0.3 ns.

5. Conclusion and outlook
As highlighted in this review, the development of emitting perovskites has been astonishing during the past few years. The intensive study of their properties and application in lighting has continuously been unravelling new breakthroughs beyond the state-of-the-art SSL with respect to color quality, efficiency, and versatility. Still the material design (e.g., shape, composition, hybrid assemblies), the synthesis protocols, and the stabilization strategies (e.g., type of matrix, coating fabrication, and type of hybrid) are not mature enough, suggesting that perovskites still have a long way ahead, having the stability as the major concern.
As far as PeLEDs are concerned, the most efficient devices have been green PeLEDs, which have reached the highest EQE to date. The main reason for the low performing blue PeLEDs might be related to the electrochemical stability and the PLQY values <50%. Both can be attributed to surface defects that inherently induce the nonradiative electron–hole recombination. Therefore, many groups have explored ways to passivate the surface defects without affecting charge transport. As an example of recent works on this aspect, Tian et al.185 have recently proposed a core–shell structured cubic CsPbBr3@amorphous CsPbBrx material with a PLQY of 84% which is significantly higher compared to that of conventional CsPbBrx (54%). It is meant that the amorphous shell protects the crystalline core from the surrounding solvent and oxygen, and also that it is involved in the formation of excitons as the emission is independent of the lattice mismatch between core and shell. Therefore, this type of material could be also electroactive, raising high expectations for blue PeLEDs.
Besides the material design, it is important to remark the need of optimizing the fabrication conditions to obtain high-quality, pinhole-free, crystalline films on top of both substrates and active layers that might complement the emission ascribed to the perovskite layers. Here, both single- and multi-layered approaches might benefit from using blends of well-known electroluminescent materials and perovskite materials as recently reported in the first white PeLED. Still open questions like the right mixture of active compounds, electron and energy transfer events, and nanostructured films are unanswered. Finally, a white PeLED based on only perovskite materials has not been realized yet. Hence, the versatility and tailoring properties of both already available electroluminescent materials and perovskites as well as device architectures provide a very broad range of improvement pathways in PeLEDs that look very promising.
A different scenario is faced in the white HLED field. On the one hand, single-component white-light emitters are rare, but they are regarded as absolutely appealing for SSL applications, as they do not present phase separation, emission quenching, and color instability. Intrinsic white perovskites represent a field in its infancy, and further efforts are required in order to increase the relatively low PLQYs. However, remarkable results have been already obtained, as the PLQY has increased from 0.5–1.5% up to 9% by simply changing the organic cation and up to 20% by changing the dimensionality. Future studies should focus on the emission mechanism, and particularly on the nature of the self-trapped states, and should clarify the influence of defects upon the broad photoluminescence. On the other hand, the use of all-inorganic perovskites is, in general, preferred. The use of QDs is also highly preferred due to easy synthesis and high PLQYs. However, the PLQY of even the same emitter varies significantly according to the synthetic procedure, processing solvent, purity of reagents, and the encapsulating matrix. The latter plays a key role in determining the air, moisture and thermal stability of perovskites. As an example, the simple use of a mesoporous silica shell can increase water stability from 20 s to 3 h35. It is, therefore, not surprising that the highest reported stability on a white HLED (227 h) is related to QDs embedded in mesoporous silica.33 The outstanding differences in QD stability with and without an encapsulating matrix highlight the fact that highly stable and efficient WLEDs are possible with the right synthetic method, matrix, and encapsulating shell. However, the lack of data about the device stability and the degradation mechanism of the white LEDs – i.e., loss of efficiency and color changes (CRI, CCT, etc.) – complicates the path through new achievements toward highly stable LEDs. Nonetheless, we believe that perovskites have a bright future in SSL.
Overall, this review honors the excellent work of the groups applying perovskites to lighting schemes. Both the breakthroughs in device performance – i.e., color quality, efficiency and stability – and the versatility towards market-related applications – i.e., smart lighting sources, displays, and VLC – promise a bright horizon of this rising material involving the efforts of chemists, material scientists, physicists, and engineers.
