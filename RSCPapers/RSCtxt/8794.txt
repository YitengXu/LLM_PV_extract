    , Accepted 26th June 2017First published on 28th June 2017AbstractA facile and simple hydrothermal assisted sol–gel route was developed to prepare nitrogen doped carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 nanocomposites (denoted as NVP@C–N) as cathodes for sodium ion batteries (NIBs). An ionic liquid (EMIm-dca) was used as the nitrogen doped carbon source. The optimized N-doped carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (denoted as NVP@C–N150) displays a very thin and uniform N-doped carbon coating layer (thickness: ∼2 nm), showing an excellent sodium storage performance (85 mA h g−1 at 20 C after 5000 cycles) and high rate capability (71 mA h g−1 at 80 C). Such a superior sodium storage performance derives from the nitrogen doping carbon coating, triggering amounts of extrinsical defects and active sites in the N-doped amorphous carbon layer, which highly accelerates Na-ion and electron transport. This approach is simple, facile and shows easy scale-up. It could be extended to other materials for energy storage.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of renewable resources such as wind power and solar energy, developing a high performance rechargeable battery for large-scale energy storage systems is urgent and necessary.1,2 Lithium (Li) ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used as power sources for portable electronic devices, because LIBs have many advantages, such as high energy density and good charge efficiency.3–5 However, for large scale application, the major issue of LIBs is the unevenly distributed availability of lithium and the high cost of lithium-based compounds.6 As alternatives to LIBs, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have gained increasing attention due to the low price and abundance of Na resources in nature.7,8 Regarding the radius, the Na ion is much larger than the Li ion, which causes grievous structural degradation accompanied with huge volume change during the repetitive intercalation/deintercalation process, finally leading to the poor electrochemical performance of NIBs.9–11 Currently, increasing attention has been focused on the polyanion based cathodes because of their open 3D host frameworks with strong covalent bonds, leading to their outstanding thermal stability and superior cycle life.12 Among these polyanion compounds for NIBs, a promising cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 (denoted as NVP) with a NASICON structure has attracted considerable attention due to its strengths of high conductivity, tiny volume expansion (∼8%), moderate potential plateau (3.4 V) vs. Na/Na+, impressive theoretical energy density (400 Wh kg−1) and so on.13–15 Nevertheless, the poor electronic conductivity of NVP makes it difficult to access the theoretical capacity and therefore the high rate performance is far from being achieved.16
Various strategies have been carried out to solve the poor electrochemical performance of NVP. Many researchers focus on downsizing the NVP particles to reduce the transport lengths of the electrons and Na ions.17–19 Coating an NVP with a conductive layer or embedding an NVP into a carbon matrix has been demonstrated as another effective process to enhance the electronic conductivity of the NVP.15,20,21 Recently, heteroatom (i.e. nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), boron (B), sulphur (S)) doping in carbon materials has been shown to be an effective way to tailor their electrical properties.22,23 Heteroatom doping can introduce multitudinous extrinsic defects and active sites, and thus improves the electronic conductivity of carbon and decreases the energy barrier of ion penetration.24–26 Among these heteroatoms, nitrogen is the most extensively investigated one, because nitrogen doping could create extrinsic defects and lead to enhanced reactivity and electronic conductivity.27,28 Zhang's group has reported NVP/nitrogen-decorated carbon hybrids, showing improved sodium storage performance.29 But the electrochemical performance is still not satisfying, partly due to the inhomogeneity of both nanoparticle size and surface carbon coating.
Herein, we employed a hydrothermal assisted sol–gel method to synthesize nitrogen-doped (N-doped) carbon coated NVP (NVP@C–N) for high performance room temperature NIBs.30,31 In our work, an ionic liquid named 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (denoted as EMIm-dca) consisting of C, N, and H elements, was used as the precursor to build a 3D hybrid N-doped transitive matrix in NVP@C nanostructure particles. The ionic liquid was employed as a novel precursor to acquire N-doped graphitized carbon.31–33 Different amounts (130 μl, 150 μl, 170 μl, 0 μl) of EMIm-dca were added into the NVP precursor solution (60 ml) and the obtained products were named NVP@C–N130, NVP@C–N150, NVP@C–N170, and NVP@C, respectively. After coating with N-doped carbon, the NVP shows improved electrochemical performance, including superior cycling capacity, outstanding rate capability, and pretty low polarization. Such a special structure of NVP coated with N-doped carbon results in a series of advantages. First, ionic liquids could penetrate into the carbon layer easily compared with conventional solid carbon precursors owing to their fluidic properties, which is highly efficient and essential to construct new electrode materials. Second, the EMIm-dca can be pyrolyzed completely at 400–1000 °C due to its excellent biodegradability, which is favorable to form a thin uniform coating layer on the particle surface.34 Last, the core–shell configuration can effectively inhibit the growth of particles during the heat treatment procedure and shorten the diffusion length of the ions/electrons.35 While the designed NVP@C–N150 was surveyed as the cathode material for NIBs, it displayed ultralong cycle capacity (85 mA h g−1 at 20 C after 5000 cycles, only 9% capacity fade) and a superior rate capacity (a reversible value of 91, 83 and 71 mA h g−1 at 50, 60 and 80 C, respectively).
2. Results and discussion
The fabrication procedures of the as-designed NVP@C–N150 cathode are presented schematically in Scheme 1. Briefly, vanadium pentoxide, sodium carbonate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate were poured together into deionized water and stirred magnetically. Then, polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG-400) and ascorbic acid were added. EMIm-dca was then added into the precursor solution before hydrothermal treatment, in which NVP precursors were formed during the subsequent hydrothermal reaction. Finally, the NVP precursors converted into the NVP@C–N150 product after freeze drying and thermal treatment in Ar atmosphere. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the N-doped carbon layer with extraordinary core–shell structure can provide a shorter electron/sodium ion transportation pathway. As a contrast, the NVP@C–N130, NVP@C–N170 and NVP@C were also prepared according to the same process but the amount of ionic liquid is changed slightly. Compared to NVP@C, NVP@C–C1 and NVP@C–C2 were prepared to explore the influence of carbon content on the NVP electrode (Experimental section in the ESI†).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these four NVP-based samples are displayed in Fig. 1a; every diffraction peak is accurately indexed to the well crystallized NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 structure, indicating that there are no impurities in all the samples.15,20,25 No differences are observed in the XRD patterns among all NVP products, implying that nitrogen doping has no impact upon the crystal pattern of NVP. Thermogravimetry (TG) analyses (Fig. 1b) indicate that precise carbon content in NVP@C, NVP@C–N130, NVP@C–N150 and NVP@C–N170 is 11.20%, 13.95%, 14.40% and 14.87%, respectively. The ionic liquid used as precursor offers a little bit of carbon. Element analysis (Table S1 in the ESI†) shows a different ratio of carbon and nitrogen; the nitrogen contents of NVP@C–N130, NVP@C–N150 and NVP@C–N170 are 2.36%, 2.77% and 3.22%, respectively. Fig. 2a & b display that the particle size of NVP@C and NVP@C–N150 are about 40 nm. Compared to NVP@C (Fig. 2a), NVP@C–N150 (Fig. 2b) shows the aggregation of small particles, which is most probably due to the addition of the high viscosity ionic liquid (EMIm-dca). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of NVP@C–N150 and NVP@C are 36.3 and 77.6 m2 g−1, respectively, demonstrating that the particle aggregation of NVP@C–N150 could result in smaller specific surface area (ESI, Fig. S1†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) are displayed in Fig. 2c & d. The particles are coated by a homogeneous carbon layer (thickness: ∼2 nm). The stripe d-spacing of 0.624 nm corresponds to the (012) interplane of NVP.30 As presented in Fig. 3, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping analyses were characterized to survey element distribution in NVP particles, in which C, N, Na, V and P elements are distributed uniformly; the quantitative EDX results are given in Table S2 in the ESI.†

Furthermore, Raman spectra were obtained to check the influence of N-doping in the coated carbon matrix (Fig. 4). Typical carbon based materials are confirmed by the peak group of the D-band (1345 cm−1) and G-band (1595 cm−1). There are no Raman fingerprints of NVP between 250 and 1100 cm−1, indicating that the NVP materials are coated by carbon with high graphitization. The D-band (ID) can be assigned to the disordered carbon including edge defects, dangling bonds, vacancies and so on. However, the G-band (IG) is associated with graphitic ordered carbon.36,37 Hence, the graphitization degree can be reflected by the ratio value of ID/IG (ID/IG = 1.05, 1.02, 0.98 and 0.94 for NVP@C–N150, NVP@C–N130, NVP@C–N170 and NVP@C, respectively). Obviously, NVP@C-150 has the highest value of ID/IG, indicating the existence of numerous extrinsical defects and active sites in the N-doped amorphous carbon layer. The doped nitrogen in the carbon layer could form more defects and active sites that can facilitate the Na+ ion/electron transport.37

The electrochemical behaviors were characterized in sodium half-cells. Fig. 5a displays the discharge/charge voltage profiles for the four NVP-based cathodes at 1 C in the voltage of 2.7–3.8 V (1 C = 110 mA g−1). The initial discharge capacities of NVP@C, NVP@C–N170, NVP@C–N150 and NVP@C–N130 are 90, 105, 113 and 99 mA h g−1, respectively. NVP@C presents the worst capacity while NVP@C–N150 displays the best reversible capacity (corresponding to 97% of the theoretical capacity), demonstrating that nitrogen doping is an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical behaviors. The quite flat plateaus located at 3.4 V correspond to the V3+/V4+ redox couple, which is consistent with previous reports.38 NVP@C–N150 exhibits the lowest polarization voltage (0.19 V). Fig. S2† shows the charge–discharge profiles of NVP@C–N150 at 1–80 C over a potential window of 2.7–3.8 V. At the initial lower rate of 1 C, it exhibits a flat voltage plateau at the potential of about 3.4 V and displays a discharge capacity of 110 mA g−1. As the current density increases from 2 to 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 C, the discharge capacity decreases slightly from 109 to 107, 105, 100 and 99 mA h g−1, respectively. It should be noted that the discharge plateau is still obvious and stable even at 50 C, which confirms good cyclability of NVP@C–N150 at high current densities. Rate performances of the four NVP cathodes were systematically explored at different current rates (2 C–80 C), as shown in Fig. 5b. NVP@C–N150 delivers almost constant capacity in a wide rate range from 2 C to 30 C (109 mA h g−1 and 100 mA h g−1 at 2 C and 30 C, respectively). The capacity decreases slightly from 40 C to 50 C (94 mA h g−1 and 89 mA h g−1, respectively). Even at an ultrahigh rate of 80 C, a superior capacity of 71 mA h g−1 still could be obtained, corresponding to 66% of the value achieved at 2 C. When the rate is tuned back to 1 C after 90 cycles at different current densities, a reversible capacity of 110 mA h g−1 still can be acquired, implying the remarkable reversibility of Na+ insertion/desertion in the NVP@C–N150 electrode. For comparison, the capacities of NVP@C–N130 and NVP@C–N170 are inferior to that of NVP@C–N150 but superior to that of NVP@C. NVP@C only delivers 89 mA h g−1 at 2 C, and displays no reversible capacity when the current density exceeds 10 C. Fig. 5c shows the specific rate capabilities of the four NVP-based cathodes. Fig. 5d compares the long cycle life of the four NVP samples at 1 C for 200 cycles. All NVP electrodes could deliver a quite steady reversible capacity. The initial coulombic efficiencies of the four electrodes are ordered as follows: NVP@C–N150 (97.0%) > NVP@C–N130 (93.3%) > NVP@C–N170 (91.2%) > NVP@C (89.5%). The initial capacity loss is partly attributed to the formation of a thick solid–electrolyte-interphase (SEI) layer on the electrode surface during the first cycle. The reversible capacity after 200 cycles for NVP@C–N150 is 109.8 mA h g−1 (96.5% of the first discharge capacity), but only 102.5, 96.5, and 87.2 mA h g−1 for NVP@C–N130, NVP@C–N170, and NVP@C, respectively. The enhanced sodium storage performance of NVP@C–N150 could be ascribed to the N-doped carbon layer which facilitates the mobility of Na+ ions and electrons. Furthermore, ultralong cycling performance is investigated at a higher rate of 20 C for 5000 cycles for the NVP@C–N150 cathode (Fig. 6). A remarkable capacity of 85 mA h g−1 could be reached, corresponding to 91% of the initial value with an ultralow decrease of 0.0016% per cycle, which indicates the superstability of this NVP-based material. After initial capacity loss, almost 100% of coulombic efficiency can be achieved, indicating the excellent reversibility of the sodium insert/extract in/out of NVP@C–N150. To investigate the influence of the weight ratio between carbon and NVP on electrochemical performance, the cycle capacities of NVP@C, NVP@C–C1 and NVP@C–C2 are tested at 1 C in the voltage range of 2.7–3.8 V (Fig. S3†). The initial discharge capacities are 90, 83 and 80 mA h g−1, respectively; NVP@C exhibits superior electrochemical performance among them. Thus, it is necessary to control the ratio of carbon and NVP for better electrochemical property. The outstanding electrochemical property of the N-doped NVP-based materials can be ascribed to (a) the homogeneous N-doped carbon coating matrix that enhances the ionic and electron conductivity and (b) the open 3D crosslinked conducting network formed among NVP particles that effectively facilitates the Na+ insertion/extraction process.

In order to figure out the effect of EMIm-dca derived carbon on the NVP-based samples, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out (Fig. 7). For NVP@C, the dominant peak of the C 1s spectrum at 284.6 eV is ascribed to the sp2-hybridized carbon with CC configuration (Fig. 7a). The sp3-hybridized carbon spectrum can be resolved into three peaks at 285.8, 287.8 and 289.3 eV, relevant to C–O, CO and O–CO configurations, respectively.24 After introducing the ionic liquid, all the oxygen related sp3-hybridized carbon spectra almost disappear entirely, which is displayed in Fig. 7b–d. The emerging peak situated at 287.1 eV corresponds to the C–N configuration, revealing that nitrogen from the EMIm-dca is doped into the carbon matrix of NVP@C–N successfully, which triggers the improvement of electronic conductivity in the electrode material.

To further explore the reason for NVP@C–N150 delivering optimal performance in all NVP-based cathodes, the XPS data of N 1s were analyzed and compared (Fig. 8a–c). The high resolution of the N 1s spectrum is divided into three peaks at 398.7, 401.1 and 403.4 eV, which is ascribed to pyridinic nitrogen (N1), pyrrolic nitrogen (N2) and graphitic nitrogen (N3), respectively. Apparently, the peak-N2 dominates in the whole N 1s spectrum, followed by peak-N1 and peak-N3 for all NVP@C–N electrodes. It has been proposed that N1 and N2 are formed via replacing the C species by N species in hexagonal rings and pentagonal rings, respectively. The replacement of elements could result in minimal damage to carbon skeletons and bring suitable structure defects. Nevertheless, the fabrication of N3 via substituting a carbon atom by N is accompanied with no destruction to the carbon skeletons.39,40 Based on the systematical dissection of the data, a recommended model of the N-modified carbon matrix is illustrated in Scheme 1. Table 1 presents the calculated atomic proportion of the N element in different NVP@C–N electrodes according to the XPS data. For NVP@C–N150, the proportions are 38.87% (N1), 54.44% (N2) and 6.69% (N3), respectively, in which the total amount of N1 + N2 is much higher than that in NVP@C–N130, followed by NVP@C–N170. These consequences demonstrate the more the total of N1 + N2, the more the extrinsical defects and active sites in the N-modified amorphous carbon layer, coinciding with the Raman results, which extremely enhance the reversible capacity by producing a quick channel for ion and electron transport.25

Fig. 9a exhibits the Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) profiles of four NVP-based cathodes with a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. All electrodes display a redox pair corresponding to the V3+/V4+ redox couple.41 NVP@C–N150 presents sharper and more symmetric redox peaks which display little detachment, revealing the excellent reversibility and much lower polarization during the Na+ insertion/extraction reaction.42 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was investigated to check these four samples. Fig. 9b illustrates the Nyquist plots (2 cycles later at 1 C) and the equivalent circuit. At high frequency, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) could be represented by the depressed semicircle.36,43 NVP@C–N150 exhibits the lowest Rct value (254.6 Ω) compared to the other three electrodes, indicating that an optimized N-doped level for the NVP@C material can facilitate electron and Na+ transport effectively, which finally could result in enhanced rate capability and remarkable cycling ability.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have rationally designed Na3V2(PO4)3 coated by N-doped carbon via a hydrothermal assisted sol–gel method, in which the ionic liquid EMIm-dca was employed as the nitrogen doped carbon source. This process is facile and easy to scale-up. The N-doped carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode shows excellent sodium storage performance, including long cycle life (85 mA h g−1 at 20 C after 5000 cycles) and outstanding rate behavior (71 mA h g−1 at 80 C). This improved electrochemical behavior could be attributed to the specific core–shell structure. The N-doped carbon coating layer could not only prevent the agglomeration and the growth of Na3V2(PO4)3, but it could also improve the electronic conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3. This effective process could be extended to other electrode materials with low electronic conductivity for high performance energy storage device application.
