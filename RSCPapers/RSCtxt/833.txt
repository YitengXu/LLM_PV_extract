    , Accepted 9th April 2014First published on 9th April 2014AbstractIn this paper, well defined GdOF:Yb3+/Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+ nano/submicrocrystals with multiform morphologies were prepared via the urea-based precipitation method without using any surfactants. The morphologies of the GdOF products, including spindles and spheres with different sizes (30–550 nm), could be easily modulated by changing the fluorine sources, and the possible formation mechanism has been presented. XRD, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, as well as up-conversion (UC) photoluminescence spectra were used to characterize the prepared samples. Under 980 nm NIR excitation, the relative emission intensities and emission colors of Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+ and Yb3+/Ho3+ doped GdOF could be precisely adjusted over a wide range by tuning the Yb3+ doping concentration. The strategies for color tuning of UC emission proposed in the current system may be helpful to achieve efficient multicolor luminescence under 980 nm laser excitation. In addition, the corresponding UC mechanisms in the co-doping GdOF systems were analyzed in detail based on the emission spectra and the plot of luminescence intensity to pump power.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the synthesis of nanomaterials with high uniformity and specific morphology has attracted extensive interest due to their widespread application, such as catalysis, drug delivery, solar cells, biolabeling, and optical sensing.1–8 Especially, lanthanide-doped upconversion (UC) luminescence nanomaterials have aroused fast growing interest because of their superior physicochemical features such as long-lived luminescence, anti-Stokes shifts, narrow emission bands, high resistance to photobleaching, remarkable light penetration depth in tissue and low toxicity as compared to conventional molecular probes like organic dyes and quantum dots.9–14 Hence, UC nanomaterials provide new opportunities for the development of the next generation of agents for biological imaging and photodynamic therapy techniques.15–18 However, it is still a significant challenge to establish an efficient method to synthesize size and morphology controlled nanoluminescent materials by simple, green, economic and mass production processes, because this would provide not only a great deal of opportunities for studying the relationship between the structures and properties of the nanomaterials obtained by a simple approach, but also a clue to design new types of nanomaterials with desired properties through referencing a given methodology.19–25
Lanthanide oxyfluorides (LnOF) have been considered as excellent luminescent host materials for achieving efficient UC luminescence, due to their better chemical durability, thermal stability and low phonon energy compared with those of fluorides and oxides.26–29 Specifically, Gd3+ ions can act as an intermediate sublattice to enhance the efficiency of activators; moreover, Gd3+ as a paramagnetic relaxation agent can introduce magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality.5,30–32 Up to now, the majority of research on GdOF has been done on its bulk crystals or irregular particles obtained by some limited chemical routes.26,28,33,34 However, the recently developed hydro/solvothermal process usually suffers from the low yield and a long reaction time. In addition, the required toxic organometallic precursors and/or the corrosive acid used in the thermolysis method for the synthesis of GdOF are dangerous, which gives rise to the need to be more careful during the experimental process.35,36 Furthermore, this method is not very convenient for mass production, which needs to be considered for practical applications.37 Therefore, developing an economical mass production and environmentally friendly method which produces GdOF nanocrystals with reproducible shapes and dimensions should be highly desired.38
Herein, we firstly report the extension of the urea-based homogeneous precipitation (UBHP) technique which has been successful in fabricating monodisperse colloidal spheres of single-component Ln2O3 for the synthesis of uniform GdOF nanomaterials with various morphologies (nanospindles and nanospheres).1,39,40 Compared with the organometallic precursors and/or the corrosive acid, urea is much more safe and convenient to be used in the laboratory. The synthesis route developed in this work is environmentally benign without adding any chelating agents and organic solvents, and especially easy to be scaled up. Interestingly, the evolution process from nanospindle to nanosphere structures can be modulated by simply altering the fluoride sources. In addition, the UC emission properties of the prepared GdOF:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm and Ho) are investigated in detail. We systematically investigated the influence of the doping Yb3+ concentration on the UC emission spectra of GdOF:Yb3+/Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+, and analyzed the UC mechanisms in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
The rare-earth oxides RE2O3 (RE = Gd, Er, Yb, Ho and Tm) (99.999%) were purchased from Science and Technology Parent Company of Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry and other chemicals were purchased from the Beijing Chemical Company. All chemicals were analytical grade reagents and used directly without further purification.
2.2 Preparation
RE(NO3)3 stock solutions of 0.5 M were obtained by dissolving the corresponding metal oxides in dilute HNO3 solution under heating with agitation. In a typical procedure, 1 mmol of NaF and a certain quantity of CO(NH2)2 were added into 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 1 mmol Gd(NO3)3. Then, dilute HNO3 was introduced rapidly into the vigorously stirred solution until pH = 2 and the beaker was wrapped with polyethylene film. After additional agitation for 15 min, the mixed solution was heated on a hot plate with stirring to 90 °C within 60 min and maintained for 2 h. The suspension was cooled to room temperature naturally and the resulting precipitates were separated by centrifugation, and washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol respectively, in sequence three times, and then dried at 85 °C in air for 12 h. The final GdOF products were retrieved through a heat treatment of the precursors at 700 °C in air for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. Other samples were prepared by a similar procedure except for different F− sources. The doped GdOF samples were prepared by introducing appropriate amounts of RE(NO3)3 (RE = Yb, Er, Tm, Ho) together with Gd(NO3)3 into the solution as described above.
2.3 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a D8 Focus diffractometer at a scanning rate of 10° min−1 in the 2θ range from 20° to 80°, with graphite monochromatized CuKα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer 580B IR spectrophotometer using the KBr pellet technique. The morphology and composition of the samples were studied using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a FEI Tecnai G2S-Twin with a field-emission gun operating at 200 kV. Images were acquired digitally on a Gatan multipole CCD camera with an integration time of 1/8 s. Up-conversion (UC) emission spectra were obtained using a 980 nm LD Module (K98D08M-30W, China) as the excitation source with a pump power density of about 50–200 mW mm−2 and detected using R955 (HAMAMATSU) from 400 to 700 nm. All the measurements were performed at room temperature (RT).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase and morphology
The composition and phase purity of the samples were first investigated by XRD. Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized precursor sample, GdOF, Yb3+/Er3+ doped GdOF samples calcined at 700 °C as well as the JCPDS card (no. 50-0569) for GdOF, respectively. No obvious diffraction peak can be observed from the precursor, implying that the sample is amorphous. However, after calcining at 700 °C for 3 h, well-defined diffraction peaks appear, which can be assigned exactly to the rhombohedral phase of GdOF. Fig. 1 and Table S1 (ESI†) show the observed, calculated, and difference patterns of the GdOF:0.01Er3+, GdOF:0.02Yb3+, 0.01Er3+ and GdOF:0.10Yb3+, 0.01Er3+, confirmed from Rietveld analysis, which reveals a good quality of fit. This compound belongs to the rhombohedral crystal system with the R3 space group. The Gd3+ ions are coordinated to four oxide and four fluoride anions and all ions (F−, O2− and Gd3+) occupy the six-fold 6c Wyckoff positions with the same C3v site symmetry.28 After doping with RE3+ (RE = Er, Yb, Tm and Ho) ions, a portion of the Gd3+ ions will be substituted in the C3v sites, as shown in Fig. S1c (ESI†). The effective ionic radii for eight-coordinated Gd3+, Er3+, Yb3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+ are 1.053, 1.004, 0.985, 0.994 and 1.015 Å, respectively. Considering the similar valence and ionic radius, the RE3+ ions are expected to efficiently dissolve in the GdOF host lattice by replacing the Gd3+ sites; thus, no other phase or impurity phase can be detected. However, the sequential peak shifts towards high diffraction angles with the increase of RE3+ concentration owing to the substitution of Gd3+ by the smaller RE3+ ions. Interestingly, the diffraction peaks gradually broaden with increasing RE3+ concentration, indicating a reduction of the average crystallite size, which is confirmed by the SEM images in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the values of the lattice constants and unit-cell volumes according to XRD results as shown in Table S1 (ESI†).41

In order to further examine the conversion process, FT-IR spectroscopy was performed for both the precursor and synthesized GdOF, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The COO− group generates the bands of δ-CO32− (712 and 739 cm−1), π-CO32− (850 and 880 cm−1) and νasO–C–O (1410 and 1520 cm−1). Furthermore, the broad absorption band located at 3410 cm−1 is due to the O–H stretching vibration of water on the surface.42 The new absorption band at 485 cm−1 due to GdOF appeared after annealing the precursor at 700 °C, indicating the well defined crystallization of GdOF.43 In addition, the EDX spectra of the precursor sample proved the presence of C, O, F and Gd elements as shown in Fig. 2c. When annealed at 700 °C for 3 h, the element C almost disappeared, and the sample mainly consists of O, F, and Gd (Fig. 2d), which is consistent with the above results.

It should be mentioned that there was not much difference in the morphologies of GdOF doped with other lanthanide ions under the same experimental conditions except for a little size shrink, as the typical SEM images show in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Thus, we only take the GdOF without doping as an example for simplicity. Fig. 3 shows the low/high-resolution SEM and TEM images of the precursor and the GdOF prepared with NaF as the fluoride source. SEM images reveal that the precursor is mainly composed of a great number of highly monodispersed nanospindles with a mean length of about 560 nm and width of about 200 nm (aspect ratio of about 2.8), as shown in Fig. 3a and b. It is apparent that GdOF still retains the nanospindle morphology except for a little shrink in size (a length of about 520 nm, a width of about 170 nm and an aspect ratio of about 3.05) because of the gradual elimination of organic elements during the calcining process.44 The TEM images (Fig. 3e and f) also confirm the morphology of nanospindles in the GdOF samples, corresponding well with the above SEM results. In the HRTEM image (Fig. 3f), the obvious lattice fringes confirm the high crystallinity of the samples. The distance between adjacent lattice fringes can be calculated to be 0.165 nm, which can be well indexed to the d-spacing value of the (116) plane of GdOF.

A series of control experiments demonstrate that the morphological evolution of GdOF is influenced by external factors such as F− sources in the initial solution. Note that the crystalline phases of the as-prepared products remain unchanged when NH4F, LiF and KF were used as the F− sources and the other reaction conditions remain unchanged. However, the morphologies of the products are quite different from those we have observed in the NaF system, as shown in Fig. 4. Nanospindles with a length of about 430 nm, a width of about 200 nm and an aspect ratio of about 2.87 were obtained through the replacement of NaF by NH4F. For the LiF system, the products are mainly composed of well-separated nanospindles (a length of about 550 nm, a diameter of about 260 nm and an aspect ratio of about 2.12) and nanospheres (a diameter of about 100 nm). When KF was used as the F− source, monodispersed nanospheres with a diameter of about 35 nm were obtained with a uniform size, as shown in Fig. 4f and g. In our current system with XF (X = Na, NH4, Li and K) added, the only difference lies in the cations in the initial solutions. It is anticipated that cations are absorbed on the surface of the initial nuclei at the early stage of the reactions, due to the strong interactions between Na+, NH4+, Li+, and K+ cations and F−, OH−, CO32− anions on the particle surface. However, the ion affinities of these cations (Na+, NH4+, Li+, and K+) are different from each other, which would influence the growth process of the formed colloidal particles. As a result, the growth rate of the crystalline plane is different, leading to the formation of a variety of morphologies.45,46 Especially, the product obtained from the KF system varied dramatically from the other systems, because K+ ions have the strongest ion affinity. Besides, these nanospheres have the highest crystalline quality owing to the smaller particle size which results in a more uniform heat distribution during the calcination process. Thus, the diffraction peaks of the KF source show a number of splittings as compared to LiF and NH4F sources as shown in Fig. 4a. A schematic illustration of the formation and subsequent evolution of the morphologies of GdOF with different F− sources is summarized in Scheme 1. In conclusion, the above results prove that our approach is environmentally benign without adding any chelating agents or organic solvents and efficient to synthesize nanomaterials with controlled morphologies.

In order to investigate the growing process of the GdOF nanospindles, time-dependent experiments were carried out by keeping other reaction parameters unchanged (90 °C, pH = 2 with NaF as F− source), which is presented in Fig. 5. At the early stage of the reaction (10 min), the OH− and CO32− were released from the decomposition of urea at high temperature in aqueous solution.47 Subsequently, a fast nucleation process occurred and a large number of small particles can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 5a. As the reaction time is increased to 20 min, a large number of monodispersed nanospindles with a size of about 500 nm length and 100 nm width are obtained (Fig. 5b), which may be due to the influence of Na+ cations and F− anions.45 These ions can be selectively adsorbed on specific facets of the initial nuclei and change their surface energy, thus, leading to the formation of nanospindles.48 Considering the fact that no impurity phase appears during the growth process of the reaction, we can reasonably infer that the evolution of nanospindles is a continual nucleation growth process. At a reaction time of 1 h (Fig. 5d), these incomplete nanostructures completely evolve into uniform nanospindles. At the same time, the size of the nanospindles has grown larger in all directions and the size uniformity is greatly improved. In addition, the aspect ratio decreases with the increase of reaction time because of the fast growth rate along the width. The product obtained after 2 h shows a similar shape and dimensions to the sample prepared at 1 h (Fig. 5f). On the basis of the time-dependent results, we can conclude that there is a morphology evolution from amorphous nanoparticles to nanospindles with a high aspect ratio, and then to nanospindles with a low aspect ratio with high uniformity in the nucleation-growth process. On the basis of the above experimental results and analysis, a schematic illustration for the formation of GdOF nanospindles is presented in Fig. 5g.

3.2 UC luminescence properties of GdOF:Yb3+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm and Ho)
In this work, we focus on investigating the UC luminescence of GdOF:Yb3+/RE3+ (RE = Er, Tm and Ho) nanospindles which were synthesized at pH = 2 with NaF as the F− source. Fig. 6a–f show the UC emission spectra of GdOF:xYb3+, 0.01Er3+ (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30) nanospindles and their corresponding luminescent photographs upon 980 nm laser excitation. In the emission spectrum of GdOF:0.01Er3+ (Fig. 6a), two primary bands appear in the green emission region peaking at 545 and 555 nm, which are assigned to the Er3+ 2H11/2–4I15/2 and 4S3/2–4I15/2 transitions, respectively, with some weak bands at 649, 655 and 670 nm due to the 4F9/2–4I15/2 transition of Er3+.9,35,49,50 The intensity of the green emission lines is much stronger than that of the red ones, resulting in bright green emissions from the sample, as confirmed by its photograph shown in the inset in Fig. 6a. Co-doping with sensitizer ions can not only increase the luminescence efficiency but also induce the variation of the emission colors.51,52 Generally, Yb3+ is always chosen as the sensitizer ion in UC luminescence systems, because it possesses a large absorption cross-section at 980 nm and a much longer excited-state lifetime.9,53,54 In our present work, it can be observed that the UC emission color changes obviously from green through yellow and finally to red when Yb3+ ions were codoped with Er3+ into the GdOF host lattice. Besides, the red (4F9/2–4I15/2), green (2H11/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2) emission intensity and the corresponding ratio of red/green of GdOF:xYb3+, 0.01Er3+ as a function of the Yb3+ concentration have been measured as shown in Fig. 7a, basically agreeing well with the above results. On the basis of the proposed UC mechanism of GdOF:Yb3+/Er3+ in Fig. 6g, we can understand the changes in the relative intensities and output colors by tuning the Yb3+ doping concentration in GdOF:xYb3+, 0.01Er3+. With the increase of Yb3+ concentration (from 0.02 to 0.10), more Yb3+ ions become available to be excited and transfer the energy to the Er3+, leading to the increase of green and red emission intensity simultaneously. In addition, the enhancement of red emission is more efficient than green emission, which results in yellow and red emissions as shown in Fig. 6b–d. However, a further increase of the Yb3+ concentration (from 0.20 to 0.30) will result in the decrease of the interatomic distance of Yb3+ and Er3+, which can efficiently accelerate the back-energy transfer process from Er3+ to Yb3+ ions 4F7/2(Er3+) + 2F7/2(Yb3+) − 4I11/2(Er3+) + 2F5/2(Yb3+).55 This energy back-transfer subsequently depopulates the excited state 4F7/2(Er3+) and then suppresses the population of Er3+ ions in levels 2H11/2 and 4S3/2, resulting in the decrease of green (2H11/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2) emission. Meanwhile, the energy transfer of 2F5/2(Yb3+) + 4I13/2(Er3+) − 2F7/2(Yb3+) + 4F9/2(Er3+) is more favorable due to the intrinsic lifetime of the 4I13/2 level being much longer than that of 4I11/2, which can directly populate the 4F9/2 level, leading to the enhancement of red (4F9/2–4I15/2) emission.9,14,56,57 At the same time, the resonant energy transfer between Yb3+ and Er3+ would accelerate because of the aggregation of activators at high concentration, thus, a portion of the energy would be lost at killers or quenching sites, accompanied by the decrease of the red and green emission intensity.58 The green emission intensity decreases sharply compared with the red emission. As a result, the red emission becomes the dominating color as shown in Fig. 6e and f. In order to determine the number of photons involved in the UC process of the GdOF:Yb3+, Er3+ nanospindles, the relationships between laser diode power and emission intensities for the red and green emissions are depicted in Fig. 8a. The slopes of the linear fits for the red and green emissions are 1.72 and 1.76, which indicates that the two photon process is involved in producing the red and green emissions in the Yb3+/Er3+ doped GdOF system.33,59

The UC luminescence properties of Yb3+/Tm3+ or Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped GdOF with different Yb3+ concentrations were also investigated and shown in Fig. 9. From the UC emission spectra of GdOF:yYb3+, 0.01Tm3+ (y = 0.02, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15), two strong blue emission bands centered at 473 and 485 nm as well as two weak red emission bands centered at 650 and 690 nm can be observed (Fig. 9a). These four emission bands can be assigned to the 1D2–3F4, 1G4–3H6, 1G4–3F4 and 3F3–3H6 transitions of the Tm3+ ion, respectively.19,60–62 The red (1G4–3F4, 3F3–3H6) emission is quite weak compared to the blue emission due to the concentration quenching effect of the fluorescence. Therefore, the tendency for the output color to change is not obvious compared with the Yb3+–Er3+ system (Fig. 9c), as confirmed by the ratio of red/blue in Fig. 7b. Notably, GdOF:0.05Yb3+, 0.01Tm3+ has the highest blue emission intensity. Fig. 9b shows the luminescence spectra of GdOF:zYb3+, 0.01Ho3+ (z = 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20). As demonstrated, a strong broad emission band centered at around 535 nm and a relatively weak emission band at 650 nm can be observed, which were caused by 5S2, 5F4–5I8, and 5F5–5I8 transitions of Ho3+ ions, respectively.44,63–65 Moreover, the ratio of red/green intensity increases obviously with the increase of doped Yb3+ concentration. Thus, for GdOF:zYb3+, 0.01Ho3+, the output colors change obviously from green to yellow with the increased Yb3+ concentration, as displayed in Fig. 9d. For the GdOF:yYb3+, Tm3+ system, when the Yb3+ concentration increases from 0.02 to 0.05, more Yb3+ ions furnish and transfer the energy to the Tm3+, resulting in the increase of red and blue emission intensity simultaneously. However, as the Yb3+ concentration increases from 0.05 to 0.15, the distance between neighboring ions becomes much shorter, the back-energy-transfer from Tm3+ to Yb3+ 1G4(Tm3+) + 2F7/2(Yb3+) − 3H5(Tm3+) + 2F5/2(Yb3+) will be enhanced, which may have a restraining effect on the population of the 1G4 excited level and decrease the 1G4–3H6 emission because of the cross relaxation process of 1G4 + 3F4 − 3H4 + 3F2. However, the 1D2 transitions could not be directly populated by the energy transfer from Yb3+ to the 1G4 level. Instead, the cross relaxation (CR) process of 3F2 + 3H4 − 3H6 + 1D2 between Tm3+ ions may play an important role in decreasing red (1G4–3F4, 3F3–3H6) and blue (1D2–3F4, 1G4–3H6) emissions.66,67 A similar situation holds for the red and green emissions in GdOF:zYb3+, 0.01Ho3+. Firstly, the intensity of red and green emissions increases with the increase of Yb3+ concentration due to the efficient energy transfer process from Yb3+ to Ho3+. However, by further increasing the doping Yb3+ concentrations, the red and green emissions decrease simultaneously because of the concentration-dependent quenching. As shown in Fig. 8b and c, the blue emission in GdOF:Yb3+, Tm3+ needs a three photons process, while the red and green emissions in GdOF:Yb3+, Ho3+ all need a two photon energy transfer process, basically consistent with previous reports.29,38,44

4. Conclusions
In summary, we presented a facile urea-based homogeneous precipitation (UBHP) technique followed by heat treatment for the synthesis of high quality GdOF nanomaterials for the first time. The shape evolution and the formation mechanism were well discussed, which is beneficial to the study of fabrication of high quality lanthanide oxyfluorides. Multicolor UC emissions of as-prepared GdOF:xYb3+, Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Tm, Ho) nanospindles can be achieved by altering the Yb3+ concentrations. As a result of the unique luminescence properties and controlled morphology, GdOF:Yb3+, Er3+/Tm3+/Ho3+ may find potential applications in the fields of authentication and security in general, display and lighting technology.
