    , Accepted 24th June 2016First published on 24th June 2016AbstractIn this paper, we report a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize low-cost, high-catalytic-activity, and stable niobium-doped hexagonal tungsten trioxide nanowires (Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs); these NWs were employed as catalysts to improve the electrocatalytic activity of graphite felt (GF) electrodes for use as positive electrodes in an all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). The effect of Nb doping and its composition on the electrochemical performance of GF electrodes for a VRFB was investigated. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results showed that Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs with a Nb/W atomic ratio of 0.03 exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activities for VO2+/VO2+ couples among all the tested electrodes. This observation was attributed to the optimal Nb-doping concentration producing moderate defect states, thereby creating structural disorders, such as oxygen vacancies, in WO3 and leading to the generation of more active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction on the electrode. Moreover, in charge–discharge tests, a VRFB single cell using the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW (Nb/W = 0.03) catalyst demonstrated an excellent energy efficiency of 78.10% with a current density of 80 mA cm−2. This efficiency is much higher than that demonstrated by VRFB cells with untreated GF (67.12%) and heat-treated GF obtained through the conventional method (72.01%). Furthermore, in the stability test of a VRFB single cell with the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW (Nb/W = 0.03) catalyst, almost no decay of the cell was observed even after 30 cycles. This observation indicates the outstanding stability of the cell during the redox reaction of vanadium ions under highly acidic conditions.
1 Introduction
The environmental impact of fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas, and oil—which are unsustainable and environmentally unfriendly energy sources—contributes to the global energy crisis and attention has been focused on the accelerated utilization of clean and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy. However, these sustainable energy sources are random and intermittent sources because they generate electrical power according to the temporal and climatic availability of the resources, which limits their practicability. A large-scale energy storage technique is a promising solution to these problems, because it can provide a temporary medium to convert electrical energy into chemical energy and reversibly release it according to the demand.1–5
Among the currently available large-scale energy storage techniques, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), originally proposed by Skyllas-Kazacos in the 1980s, are considered the most promising and extensively investigated flow battery system owing to their long cycle life, high safety, high energy efficiency, independent power and energy ratings, flexible design, environmental friendliness, and low maintenance cost.6 More notably, during charging and discharging, a VRFB employs the same metal (vanadium) of the active species in both positive V(IV)/V(V) and negative V(II)/V(III) electrolytes; this strategy precludes crossover contamination caused by the transfer of metal ions across the ion exchange membrane.4,7–10 However, despite these merits, VRFBs have limited practicability because of their low energy efficiency; the efficiency of VRFBs is significantly influenced by the electrochemical activity of the electrode because the redox reaction of vanadium ions occurs at the electrode surface.11 Therefore, selecting suitable electrode materials is crucial in VRFB design.5
Carbonaceous materials such as carbon paper, graphite felt, carbon cloth, and graphite powder have been investigated as electrode materials for VRFBs.12,13 Among them, graphite felts (GFs) are the most widely used because of their porous three-dimensional network structure; low cost; high electrical conductivity, chemical and mechanical stability, and specific surface area; resistance to corrosion in acidic solutions; and a wide operating potential range. However, these materials have insufficient wettability toward hydrophobic surfaces and low electrochemical activity because of poor kinetics and reversibility, especially for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. These shortcomings often restrict the use of GFs as active electrode materials. Therefore, the development of GF materials with high electrocatalytic activity toward the redox reactions in a VRFB system is crucial.14–17 To address these problems, numerous methods, including thermal treatment, acid treatment, electrochemical oxidation, plasma treatment, nitrogen doping, and modification with metals, have been reported by several research groups.3,16,18–22 Precious metals such as Au, Ir, Pt, Pd, and Ru deposited as catalysts on the surface of GFs have shown high catalytic activity for the VO2+/VO2+ couple reaction. However, such metals are costly and susceptible to occurrences of the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction; these factors limit their commercial applications in VRFBs.9,10
Recently, many efforts have been made to develop low-cost metals and metal oxides, such as Bi, Mn3O4, Nb2O5, PbO2, CeO2 and WO3, to enhance the energy efficiency of VRFBs.3,15,23–26 Among the numerous transition metal oxides, tungsten oxide (WO3) has attracted tremendous attention for a multitude of potential applications, such as secondary batteries, electrocatalysts, electrochromic materials, gas sensors, and photocatalysts, because of its unique electronic and optical properties.27–31 More specifically, hexagonal WO3 (h-WO3) has been identified as a promising electrocatalyst owing to its hexagonal and trigonal tunnel structure.30,32 Other advantages of h-WO3 are its high stability in acidic solutions, earth abundance, nontoxicity, and facile preparation. Further, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures are favorable because of their unique chemical and size-dependent properties that make them suitable for various applications. Therefore, many efforts have focused on the synthesis of 1D h-WO3 nanostructures such as nanowires (NWs), nanorods, nanosheets, and nanotubes.30,33
From the literature, it is clear that most research efforts have been devoted to enhancing the electrocatalytic activities of GFs by depositing transition metal oxides on the GF surface. However, the electrocatalytic effect of metal-doped transition metal oxides deposited on the GF surface has rarely been reported. In this paper, we report a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize low-cost and high-catalytic-activity Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs as catalysts to improve the electrochemical activity of GF electrodes for use in VRFBs. A VRFB single cell using the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF electrode yielded an excellent energy efficiency of 78.10% at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. This efficiency is much higher than those of VRFB single cells using untreated GF (67.12%) and heat-treated GF (72.01%).
2 Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs on GFs
All chemicals used in this study were commercially available analytical-grade reagents and were not purified further. A 6.5 mm-thick PAN-based pristine GF sample was pretreated at 400 °C for 30 h in air and subsequently cooled to room temperature prior to use. The main purpose of the thermal pretreatment of pristine GF was to enhance its wettability and eliminate impurities. h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GFs were synthesized through a hydrothermal method as follows. Two grams of Na2WO4·2H2O were dissolved in 45 mL deionized water under stirring at room temperature, and 0.27 g of NbCl5 was dissolved in 10 mL ethanol by using a magnetic stirrer. The precursor solutions were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of these two solutions (Nb/W atomic ratios = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06) in the precursor solutions. Subsequently, 5 mL of a 3 M HCl solution was added dropwise to the resultant solution under continuous stirring. Subsequently, 35 mL of a 0.5 M ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) solution was added to this solution, and a homogenous solution was obtained after continuous stirring for 30 min. Then, 20 mL of the resulting mixed solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with 120 mL capacity. Pretreated GF was immersed into this solution. The sealed Teflon-lined autoclave was loaded into a muffle furnace and heated at 180 °C for 24 h for subjecting it to a hydrothermal process. When the reaction was completed, the autoclave was allowed to cool down naturally to room temperature. The modified GF was taken out from the autoclave, washed three times with deionized water to remove unreacted materials, and dried overnight in air at 50 °C.
2.2 Characterization of materials
Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a Bruker D2-phaser diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54056 Å), scanning between 10 and 70° (2θ) at a scan rate of 2° min−1 in steps of 0.02°. The morphology of the samples was examined through field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM 6500F, JEOL) and field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) which was used to determine the elemental content. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermal K-Alpha) was used to identify the chemical compositions of the samples and oxidation states of the elements.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical characterization of the samples was performed using a typical three-electrode system at room temperature; a platinum wire and a standard Hg/Hg2SO4/sat. K2SO4 (0.658 V vs. NHE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A GF modified electrode with a geometric area of 1.58 cm2 was used as the working electrode; it was placed in a holder and connected with a golden wire to the electrochemical instrument. The modified working electrode was prepared by cutting a circular sample (1.58 cm2) from the modified GF sheet. The amount of catalyst on the surface of GF was calculated based on the weight difference of GF before and after depositing the functional material. The average measured amount of the Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs (Nb/W = 0.03) on the GF was 2.1 mg cm−2. A cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was conducted in 0.05 M VOSO4 in a 2.0 M H2SO4 solution in the potential range between approximately 0.36 and 1.66 V vs. NHE at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The electrolyte was purged with nitrogen gas to prevent unnecessary oxidation. Further, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was performed by applying an AC voltage of 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range from 105 to 10−2 Hz at the open circuit potential. All electrochemical measurements were conducted using a Bio-Logic (SP-240) potentiostat/galvanostat controlled by EC-Lab® software.
2.4 VRFB single cell test
A VRFB performance single cell test was conducted to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the modified electrodes. The area of the modified electrodes on both the positive and negative sides was 5 cm2. The single cell was connected to two glass tanks containing a balanced electrolyte volume of 60 mL on each side. A pristine Nafion® 117 membrane was used as a separator. Initially, the electrolyte on both sides was 1.6 M VOSO4 in a 2.5 M H2SO4 solution; subsequently, the VRFB became fully charged and converted vanadium ions into VO2+ and V2+ at the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The flow rate of the electrolyte was maintained at 30 mL min−1. The charge–discharge test of the VRFB was evaluated using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Bio-Logic, EC-Lab® software) at a constant current density within a fixed potential range of 0.7 to 1.6 V.
The coulombic efficiency (CE), energy efficiency (EE), and voltage efficiency (VE) of the cell were calculated from charge–discharge curves according to the following equations. (1) (2) (3)where I is the current, td is the discharge time, tc is the charge time, Vd is the discharge voltage, and Vc is the charge voltage. Vd and Vc are functions of time. Eqn (2) expresses the average energy efficiency during the complete charge–discharge processes.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the structure and morphology of h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF

Fig. 1 depicts the XRD patterns of GF electrodes containing undoped h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs with various Nb/W ratios. All samples showed a characteristic peak at around 26.61° that corresponds to diffraction from the graphite (111) plane (JCPDS no. 01-075-2078) in GF. The peak intensity of the GF (111) plane in the Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs was higher than that of undoped h-WO3 NWs, indicating that the doping of Nb decreases the crystallinity of the resulting samples. Additional intense diffraction peaks were observed at around 14.0°, 22.8°, 28.2°, and 36.6°, all of which were significant characteristic peaks of h-WO3 corresponding to diffraction from the (100), (001), (200), and (201) planes, respectively. Similarly, undoped h-WO3 could be well indexed to the pure hexagonal phase of WO3 with lattice parameters a = 7.298 Å and c = 3.899 Å (JCPDS no. 01-075-2187) belonging to the space group of P6/mmm (191). After doping WO3 with Nb ions, the original h-WO3 XRD peaks did not change substantially. However, a new diffraction peak at around 32.2° gradually appeared with increasing Nb content. The new peak could be indexed to the (−713) plane of Nb2O5 (JCPDS no. 00-027-1311), and the intensity of (100), (200), and (201) peaks decreased gradually. Moreover, as the amount of Nb ions was increased from a Nb/W atomic ratio of 0 to 0.06, the diffraction of (001) peaks shifted to a lower degree, indicating an increase in lattice parameters owing to Jahn–Teller distortion.34,35 Nb doping of h-WO3 NWs expands the crystal of the WO3 lattice and thus induces local distortions as a result of this slight lattice expansion.31 This crystal lattice distortion can induce defects such as oxygen vacancies, which have been suggested to be active sites in heterogeneous catalysis.36 In addition, the intensity of the (001) plane was stronger than that of the rest of the planes, implying that (001) is the preferential growth direction of h-WO3 along the c-axis. Notably, typical Nb2O5 XRD peaks were not observed for a Nb/W atomic ratio of 0.01, possibly because the Nb doping concentration was too low to detect through XRD, as reported in previous studies.37,38

Fig. 2 presents the FESEM images of untreated GF, bare heated GF, and undoped h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GFs with various Nb/W atomic ratios. In the case of untreated GF (Fig. 2a), some impurities were observed on the GF surface; these impurities may hinder electron transfer and adsorption of vanadium ions. After the treatment, as shown in Fig. 2b, bare heated GF exhibited a rough and pure surface that was beneficial for increasing the specific area of GF to a large extent.39Fig. 2c shows the FESEM image of undoped h-WO3 NWs deposited onto the GF surface. The doping of Nb atoms into h-WO3 NWs affected the morphology of the final products. Fig. 2d–f present the FESEM images of Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GFs with various Nb/W ratios; the NWs became shorter and thicker with increasing Nb content. When the Nb/W ratio was 0.03 (Fig. 2e), the NWs showed a more uniform distribution than that shown by the NWs in other samples. When the Nb/W ratio was increased to 0.06 (Fig. 2f), the NWs tended to aggregate, resulting in the formation of a mixture of nanorods and nanosheets.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) untreated GF, (b) bare heated GF, (c) undoped h-WO3 NW-modified GF, and from (d) to (f), Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GFs, the atomic ratio of Nb/W is (d) 0.01, (e) 0.03, and (f) 0.06. 
Further morphological and structural characterization of the undoped h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs (Nb/W = 0.03) was performed using TEM, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a and b show undoped h-WO3 NWs and Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs, respectively; the NWs had uniform wire-like morphologies with diameters of 5–8 nm. However, the length of the latter was shorter than that of the former; this result is consistent with observations from SEM images. Fig. 3c illustrates the TEM image of undoped h-WO3 NWs, showing lattice fringes of a crystallographic plane parallel to the NW axis. From these fringes, the d-spacing was calculated to be approximately 0.388 nm (shown in the inset digital micrograph), corresponding to the (001) plane of h-WO3. This result demonstrated that the growth direction of h-WO3 NWs was along the c-axis. Fig. 3d shows the TEM image of Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs. As shown in the inset digital micrograph, the calculated d-spacing between the lattice planes was approximately 0.392 nm, corresponding to the (001) crystal plane of h-WO3. The lattice fringes of Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs were slightly distorted, indicating that the growth of h-WO3 NWs along the (001) direction was inhibited. This is due to the incorporation of Nb5+ into the WO3 framework, which causes lattice distortion, inducing more defects.31,37 Because Nb5+ has a large ionic radius, it intercalates into the WO3 lattice and replaces W6+ or W5+ ions. This causes the lattice fringe of h-WO3 NWs to distort, leading to the appearance of many crystal defects that provide suitable location sites for Nb5+.31,37 Furthermore, Nb5+ may exist in the form of Nb2O5. The formation of Nb2O5 might occur at the tips of h-WO3 NWs, prohibiting 1D growth and resulting in shorter NWs.31,40 Furthermore, the addition of sulfate ions might affect the specific morphologies of the final products. WO3 nuclei served as seeds and grew along the [001] direction of a h-WO3 unit cell because the sulfate ions were preferentially adsorbed on faces parallel to the c-axis of the WO3 nanocrystal, resulting in the formation of NWs.41,42 High angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF and the corresponding elemental mapping (see Fig. S1 of the ESI†) clearly demonstrate the uniform distribution of Nb in the composite.

The chemical composition of the samples and the oxidation states of the elements present in undoped h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs were further confirmed through XPS spectra (Fig. 4). From the wide-scan survey spectrum of Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs with a Nb/W atomic ratio of 0.03 (see Fig. S2d of ESI†), all indexed peaks could be attributed to C, W, O, and Nb. Narrow-scan Gaussian fitting curves for O, W, and Nb elements were obtained to further investigate their binding states. In Fig. 4a, the XPS spectrum of W 4f from undoped h-WO3 NWs showed two characteristic peaks centered at binding energies of 35.90 and 37.94 eV, associated with the spin–orbit doublets of W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, respectively. These two peaks were well separated without any shoulders, indicating that all W atoms were in the +6 oxidization state; this result is in agreement with the literature values for W6+ present in WO3.43,44Fig. 4b shows the narrow-scan O 1s XPS spectrum of undoped h-WO3 NWs. Two components of O 1s were observed in the figure: a major peak at a binding energy of 530.65 eV, which could be assigned to O2− ions in the WO3 lattice and a smaller peak at a binding energy of 531.2 eV, assigned to O− ions (adsorbed oxygen).45 The narrow-scan W 4f XPS spectrum of Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs (Nb/W = 0.03; Fig. 4c) could be fitted with two doublets. The peak positions of the first doublet were 35.80 and 37.95 eV, corresponding to W6+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively. The peak positions of the second doublet were 35.10 and 37.20 eV, corresponding to W5+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively. Thus, Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs contained W6+ as well as W5+ oxidation states. The curve fitting analysis of W 4f peaks showed that W in Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs (Nb/W = 0.03) consists of 18.2% W in the form of W5+. Fig. 4d shows the narrow-scan O 1s XPS spectrum of Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs. Two separate peaks at binding energies of 530.7 and 531.2 eV, corresponding to O2− and O− ions, respectively, could be observed. Compared with that of undoped h-WO3 NWs, the intensity of peaks for O− states increased while that for O2− states considerably decreased. Thus, the doping of Nb ions could induce oxygen vacancies, which played a major role in enhancing the catalytic activity.38 The narrow-scan Nb 3d XPS spectrum of Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs is presented in Fig. 4e; it could be fitted with doublet peaks at binding energies of 207.30 and 210.05 eV, corresponding to Nb 3d5/2 and Nb 3d3/2 transitions, respectively. The peaks were not well resolved because of the low Nb concentration in the sample. However, the intensity of the peaks increased with increasing Nb doping concentration, and the peaks became well resolved (see Fig. S2c, f and i of the ESI†). The curve fitting analysis of Nb 3d peaks confirmed that the oxidation state of Nb in Nb2O5 is +5 and that the Nb/W atomic ratio is 0.029, which is almost equal to the default ratio during the preparation of the Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs.31,46,47

3.2 Electrochemical characterization of h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF
The CV curves shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate the electrochemical activities for the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple reaction in 0.05 M VOSO4 + 2 M H2SO4 solutions at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 by using bare heated GF, undoped h-WO3 NW-modified GF, and Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF with various Nb/W atomic ratios as electrodes. The Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) showed better electrochemical catalytic activity than the other samples. Table 1 lists the behaviors of the specific samples corresponding to their CV curves. The oxidation and reduction peaks corresponding to a VO2+/VO2+ couple appeared at approximately 1.4 and 0.7 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The oxidation peak current densities (Jpa) of the samples in a decreasing order were as follows: Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) > Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.01) > Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.06) > undoped h-WO3 NW-modified GF > bare heated GF. Moreover, the reduction peak current densities (Jpc) of the samples showed the same trend. The highest redox peak current densities, Jpa and Jpc, of the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) suggested that it had the most favorable electron-transfer kinetics for the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple reaction owing to the presence of the largest number of active sites on the electrode among all samples. The oxidation and reduction peak current density ratios (Jpa/Jpc) of all samples were almost close to the ideal value (i.e., unity), indicating that all samples possess good symmetry. In addition, the peak potential separation (ΔEp = Epa − Epc) was calculated for all samples to assess the reversibility of the redox reaction. Among the five types of electrodes, the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) electrode exhibited the lowest ΔEp for the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple, indicating that it possesses relatively the best electrochemical reversibility toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. Thus, the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) electrode exhibited the optimal electrocatalytic activity and reversibility toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction.

To obtain supporting evidence for the performance of the electrodes, their electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded at the open-circuit potential. As shown in Fig. 6, each Nyquist plot contained a semicircle part and a sloping straight line part, indicating that the electrochemical process was mix-controlled by charge transfer and diffusion steps. The semicircle part in the high-frequency region could be attributed to the charge transfer process occurring at the electrolyte/electrode interface, and the sloping straight line part in the low-frequency region corresponded to vanadium ion diffusion through solutions.10,24 The radius of the semicircle is related to the charge transfer resistance, implying that a smaller semicircle radius indicates lower charge transfer resistance, which in turn indicates a faster electron transfer reaction. Consequently, the EIS for different electrodes could be fitted with an equivalent circuit diagram of the Randles circuit, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6, and the obtained fitting data are listed in Table 2. In the equivalent circuit, Rct represents the charge transfer resistance, Rs represents the bulk solution resistance of the electrolyte and electrode, and CPE is the constant-phase element, which represents the double-layer capacitance of the electrode/solution interface. Note that the impedance of the CPE is given by  where Q is the CPE prefactor; ω is the angular frequency; i is the imaginary unit; and a is its exponent (0 ≤ a ≤ 1). W is the infinite Warburg impedance. The bulk solution resistances of all electrodes were almost equal. The charge transfer resistances of the electrodes in a decreasing order were as follows: bare heated GF > undoped h-WO3 NW-modified GF > Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF. Evidently, the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) electrode, which showed the best electrochemical activity toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction, exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance.

3.3 VRFB single cell performance
A charge–discharge test was performed using a VRFB cell to further understand the catalytic effect of undoped h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF on the electrochemical performance of the cell. Fig. 7 shows the charge–discharge curves for untreated GF, bare heated GF, undoped h-WO3 NW-modified GF, and Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF with various Nb/W atomic ratios at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. Compared with the other electrodes, the VRFB cell with Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) as the electrode demonstrated a longer charge–discharge time, a higher discharge voltage plateau, and a lower charge voltage plateau, leading to higher voltage and energy efficiency. This is because the introduction of Nb ions provided more active sites for the vanadium redox couples on the surface of GF by producing moderate defect states and resulting in more uniform distribution of Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs on the GF surface, leading to lower electrochemical polarization of the redox reaction. The CE, VE, and EE data obtained from Fig. 7 are summarized in Table 3. The Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) showed the highest efficiencies among all samples.

Fig. 8 presents the charge–discharge curves for the cell with Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF electrodes at different current densities, and the corresponding efficiencies are listed in Table 4. As the current density increased, the CE increased slightly owing to the reduced time of vanadium ion crossover through membranes caused by the reduction in the charge–discharge time. However, the VE and EE decreased because a fast charge–discharge rate caused a large charge–discharge overpotential.3

Fig. 9 shows the CE, VE, and EE after 30 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 9a, the average CE values of the cells with heat-treated GF, undoped h-WO3 NW-modified GF, and Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs-modified GF were nearly equal. This is due to a similar overall effect of self-discharge on each electrode.48 However, the average VE (Fig. 9b) and EE (Fig. 9c) of the cell with Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF were much higher than those of the cells with undoped h-WO3 NW-modified GF and heat-treated GF. The stability test results revealed no apparent decay in the efficiencies, implying that both undoped h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF have high stability during the redox reaction of vanadium ions under highly acidic conditions.

The excellent performance of the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF could be attributed to the following reasons. The optimal Nb doping concentration produced moderate defect states, creating structural disorder in WO3, such as oxygen vacancies, which provided active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction on the GF surface.38 Furthermore, the relatively uniform NWs of Nb-doped h-WO3 (Nb/W = 0.03) deposited on the GF surface provided more active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ couple redox reaction. Therefore, the EE of a VRFB that employed Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) as a catalyst was significantly enhanced by boosting the chemical conversion of the electroactive species.
Here, we summarized several papers in order to compare the electrochemical performance of the present material with those of previously reported metal/metal oxide based materials for VRFBs, as listed in Table 5. It is well known that a higher concentration of electrolyte and lower current density lead to a higher efficiency of VRFBs. For instance, the EEs of most of the previously reported metal/metal oxide based materials were <81% at a current density of 40 mA cm−2. In our case, a VRFB cell using the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF electrode exhibits the excellent EEs of 85.13% and 78.10% at the current densities of 40 and 80 mA cm−2, respectively, which are much higher than those of the previously reported metal/metal oxide based electrodes.

4 Conclusions
In summary, undoped h-WO3 and Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs were synthesized for VRFB applications through a hydrothermal method in the presence of ammonium sulfate. The optimum Nb/W atomic ratio played a key role in enhancing the electrochemical performance of VRFBs. Among all the tested electrodes, the GF electrode modified using Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs (Nb/W = 0.03) as a catalyst exhibited the optimal electrocatalytic activity and reversibility for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. According to the experimental results, the optimal Nb doping concentration produced moderate defect states; this created a structural disorder in h-WO3, such as oxygen vacancies, and thus provided active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction on the GF surface. Consequently, a VRFB cell using the Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) electrode exhibited an excellent energy efficiency of 78.10% with a current density of 80 mA cm−2. This efficiency was much higher than those of VRFB cells using untreated GF (67.12%) and heat-treated GF obtained by the conventional method (72.14%). Moreover, the stability test of this VRFB cell showed that Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF has outstanding stability during the redox reaction of vanadium ions under highly acidic conditions.
