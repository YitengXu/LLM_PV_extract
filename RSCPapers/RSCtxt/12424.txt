    , Accepted 10th August 2022First published on 10th August 2022AbstractMultifunctional flexible pressure sensors with high sensitivity and a wide sensing range can meet the requirements of various complex applications. Herein, metal (Au or Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced onto a MXene-coated nonwoven fabric (MNWF) using a self-reduction strategy to build a “brick–mortar” hierarchical structure (AuNPs or AgNPs@MNWF). This method is green and environmentally friendly because the self-reduction properties of MXene endow noble metal NPs with uniform sizes and controlled densities to be introduced without using reducing agents or surfactants. The introduction of metal NPs and the construction of composites considerably improve the piezoresistive properties of MNWF, resulting in a 4-fold increase in sensor sensitivity (a linear sensitivity of 24.5 kPa−1 at 0–100 kPa). Moreover, the excellent electrical conductivity and unique plasmonic effect of metal NPs also contribute toward enhancing the heating performance and expanding the antibacterial applications of MNWF. In particular, compared to MNWF, AgNPs@MNWF as a dual energy-driven flexible wearable heater exhibits an electrothermal enhancement of 25.3 °C (at 7.5 V) and a photothermal enhancement of 5.6 °C (at 100 mW cm−2). Notably, the antibacterial efficiency of AgNPs@MNWF is as high as 99.9%, indicating the potential of this material for applications in the medical and health field, such as in intelligent mattresses. Overall, noble metal NPs can enhance the sensing performance as well as the Joule heating, and photothermal and antibacterial properties of MNWF. Thus, this work extends the applicability of the self-reduction strategy, providing a general strategy for expanding the applications of multifunctional fabric-based flexible sensors.
1 Introduction
Recently, the gradually increasing demand for smart wearable devices has driven the development of various types of flexible pressure sensors, including capacitive,1,2 piezoelectric,3,4 piezoresistive,5–7 and triboelectric sensors.8–10 These sensors can convert continuous external mechanical stimuli into electrical signals for further analysis and processing, thus enabling a wide range of applications, such as the detection of physiological health parameters.11 In particular, piezoresistive sensors are considered promising because data acquisition is simple, and transient/dynamic deformations can be detected.12 However, the trade-off between high sensitivity and a wide linear range remains a bottleneck, which has restricted the further development of flexible piezoresistive sensors.13
To date, improvements in the performance of flexible piezoresistive sensors have mainly been achieved by introducing microengineered structures or selecting appropriate active materials.14–16 Flexible substrates such as polymers and textiles have been optimized by constructing microstructures, including pyramids,17 domes,18 bionic leaf microstructures,6,19,20 and sandpaper structures,21,22 to adjust the contact resistance. In addition, multidimensional conductive nanomaterials with various structures and properties, such as zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles (NPs), one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets, have been used to optimize the performance of sensing components and achieve high sensitivity.23,24 Although considerable progress has been made toward improving sensor performance, device versatility is also required to adapt to more complex applications, which remains a major research challenge.
A number of unique substrates and active materials have been found to be beneficial for the development of multifunctional devices.23,25,26 For example, a fabric-based triboelectric nanogenerator with a three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb structure and the triboelectric effect can realize self-power generation and sensing for applications in fire prevention and fire escape rescue systems.27 In addition, among many active materials, MXenes, an emerging class of transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, with unique electrical, optical and mechanical properties present broad and desirable applications in electromagnetic shielding, energy conversion, cancer theranostics,28 and sensors.29,30 Of particular interest to us are Ti3C2Tx MXene metallic electrical conductivity, near-infrared light absorption, biocompatibility, and solution processability that help in the creation of multifunctional wearable flexible devices.31,32 Studies have shown that Ti3C2Tx MXene as a filler can promote the electrothermal and photothermal functions of composites.33–35 Wang et al.36 have prepared MXene/aramid nonwoven fabrics using spraying–drying method, and the obtained functional electronic fabrics exhibit excellent flame retardant properties, electromagnetic shielding and electrothermal/photothermal conversion properties. As an alternative approach for achieving multifunctionally, functional units such as plasmonic metal NPs and conductive polymers have been introduced into flexible substrates. For instance, wearable, transparent, and healable materials with a wide range of applications have been designed using elastic polyurethane as a substrate and AgNPs@MXene as a photothermal filler.37
Metal NPs are ideal conductive nanomaterials for designing wearable, flexible pressure sensors owing to their excellent electrical conductivity, good flexibility, unique plasmonic effects, excellent antibacterial properties, and satisfactory biosafety.38,39 Therefore, the introduction of metal NPs into the active layer is a promising general strategy for enhancing the sensing, photothermal, Joule heating, and antibacterial performance. Current methods for the deposition of metal NPs on the surfaces of flexible substrates typically involve electroless plating or electrochemical methods.40,41 However, these preparation processes are complicated and environmentally unfriendly, as they inevitably require the use of reducing agents or high energy consumption and have hindered the development of wearable electronics.42 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop simple, efficient, low-carbon, and environmentally friendly strategies for constructing controllable 0D metal NP/2D nanosheet structures toward the fabrication of multifunctional pressure sensors with high sensitivity and wide sensing ranges.
Herein, a general approach for enhancing the sensing performance and endowing the multifunctionality of materials by constructing 0D/2D multidimensional structures was proposed. Metal NPs@MXene-coated nonwoven fabric (AuNPs@MNWF or AgNPs@MNWF) composites were prepared by utilizing the self-reduction properties of MXene to deposit AuNPs or AgNPs. The composite fabrics were characterized, and their sensing performance, electrothermal and photothermal conversion properties, and antibacterial activities were evaluated and compared with those of MNWF itself. The multifunctionality of the prepared composites was advantageous for numerous applications. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the construction of 0D NP/2D nanosheet composites is a promising strategy for enhancing the sensing performance as well as photothermal, electrothermal, and antibacterial properties.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Ti3AlC2 (400 mesh, 99%) and lithium fluoride (LiF, 99%) were purchased from Shandong Xiyan New Material Technology Co., Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%) was acquired from Shanghai Titan Technology Co., Ltd. Anhydrous ethanol (analytical grade) and silver nitrate (AgNO3, analytical grade) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4, Au  47.5%) was purchased from Beijing Inokay Technology Co., Ltd. The spunlace nonwoven fabric (NWF, cellulose to polyester fiber mass ratio of 55:45) was obtained from Dongguan Guanrun Textile Co., Ltd. Conductive silver paste (DJ002) was purchased from MECHANIC. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer (Dow Corning 184) was obtained from Suzhou Heidisi Network Technology Co., Ltd. All reagents were used as received without further purification. Flexible transparent polyimide interdigitated electrodes (PI-IDE) were purchased from Guangzhou Mecart Sensor Technology Co., Ltd.
2.2 Synthesis of Ti3C2Tx MXene
Ti3C2Tx MXene was prepared according to the minimally intensive layer delamination (MILD) method, as reported previously.43 First, 40 mL of 27–28% HCl and 3.2 g of LiF were mixed as an etching reagent and then transferred to a Teflon liner, which was placed in an ice water bath to neutralize the heat of the reaction. After complete cooling, 1.98 g of Ti3AlC2 was slowly added to the etching reagent, and etching was allowed to proceed for 24 h while maintaining the temperature at 45 °C. The obtained product was centrifuged and washed until the pH of the supernatant was neutral. During this process, Ti3C2Tx began to delaminate spontaneously, resulting in a supernatant containing single-layered Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets (s-Ti3C2Tx) and a precipitate that mainly consisted of multilayered Ti3C2Tx MXene (m-Ti3C2Tx). To improve the delamination and exfoliation efficiency, the precipitate was collected and added to approximately 200 mL of deionized water, followed by shaking for 60 min, ultrasonication for 60 min (ice water bath, argon protection), and centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 60 min. Finally, the upper black solution was collected and used as an s-Ti3C2Tx MXene colloidal solution.
2.3 Preparation of MNWF
MNWF was prepared by a simple dip-coating method. First, a rectangular NWF sample (2 cm × 1.5 cm) was ultrasonically washed to remove impurities from the fabric surface. Then, the NWF sample was immersed in a 5 mg mL−1 Ti3C2Tx dispersion for 5 min. The fabric surface was blotted with filter paper to remove any incompletely absorbed MXene, and the sample was then thoroughly dried in an oven at 50 °C for 1 h. The filter paper absorption step was omitted during the preparation of high-performance composite fabrics for Joule heating. The MXene contents of the MNWF samples were controlled by adjusting the concentration of the Ti3C2Tx dispersion (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 mg mL−1). The prepared samples were named MNWF−y, where y is the concentration of the MXene dispersion.
2.4 Spontaneous growth of metal NPs on MNWF
Metal NPs@MNWF composites were fabricated by exploiting the ability of MXene to adsorb noble metal ions and spontaneously reduce them to NPs. In a typical procedure for the synthesis of AuNPs@MNWF, 100 μL HAuCl4 solution was first dripped on a piece of MNWF for 30 min at 30 °C to allow the spontaneous growth of AuNPs. Then, the sample was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 1 h. The obtained composite fabrics were named AuNPs−x@MNWF−y, where x is the mass of metal NPs in the composite fabric relative to the mass of MXene (x = 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 wt%). The distribution density of AuNPs on the composite fabric was controlled by changing the concentration of HAuCl4 (metal content: 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.332, 0.415 mg mL−1). To demonstrate the universality of self-reduced metal NPs@MXene heterojunctions, AgNPs@MNWF composites with different concentrations of AgNO3 were also prepared using the same procedure.
2.5 Fabrication of Metal NPs@MNWF flexible pressure sensors
The procedure for assembling a flexible pressure sensor based on metal NPs@MNWF is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). First, the metal NPs@MNWF placed on a PI-IDE was immobilized by encapsulation between two PDMS films. To prepare PDMS films, the base and curing agents were uniformly mixed at a mass ratio of 10:1, and the mixture was degassed and coated on a glass plate to form a film (80 °C, 2 h). Finally, copper wires (diameter: 0.1 mm) were connected to both ends of the PI-IDE using conductive silver paste.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Design of metal NPs@MNWF composites

Fig. 1(a) shows the preparation process of AuNPs@MNWF composites, which involves three main steps: (1) s-Ti3C2Tx MXene synthesis via an in situ HF method; (2) MNWF preparation by layer-by-layer self-assembling of Ti3C2Tx MXene on the NWF surface; (3) the uniform deposition and spontaneous growth of noble metal NPs on the surface of MNWF, driven by unique self-reduction properties of Ti3C2Tx MXene. The Al atomic layer in the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase with a bulk layered morphology was selectively etched to obtain m-Ti3C2Tx by using the improved MILD method. s-Ti3C2Tx MXene was then successfully synthesized by ultrasonication. The morphologies of the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase, m-Ti3C2Tx MXene, s-Ti3C2Tx MXene and the corresponding elemental distributions are shown in Fig. 1(b)–(d). In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results confirmed the structural evolution from the MAX phase to s-Ti3C2Tx (Fig. S1–S5, ESI†). The exfoliated MXene nanosheets exhibited a typical 2D-layered morphology with a large specific surface area and a lattice spacing of ∼2.6 Å, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig. S6, ESI†). Selected area electron diffraction patterns also confirmed the hexagonal arrangement of atoms in the s-Ti3C2Tx flakes (inset, Fig. 1(d)). Furthermore, the thickness of s-Ti3C2Tx was determined to be only 2.4 nm by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which is consistent with the previously reported thicknesses of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (Fig. S7, ESI†).44 Notably, owing to the abundant surface functional groups (–OH, –O, –F) introduced during the etching process, the MXene nanosheets were highly hydrophilic (Fig. S8a–e and Tables S1, S2, ESI†). Consequently, s-Ti3C2Tx could be uniformly dispersed in an aqueous solution, exhibiting the typical Tyndall phenomenon (Fig. S9, ESI†).

According to our previous work, NWFs are superior to other textile substrates for designing high-performance MXene/textile-based piezoresistive sensors owing to their crisscross structure.45 A commercially obtained NWF consisting of numerous randomly intertwined fibers with micrometer widths was used as a flexible substrate for depositing MXene nanosheets (Fig. S10a–c, ESI†). The pristine NWF exhibited excellent hydrophilicity, with a contact angle of only 34.4°, mainly because of the large number of hydrophilic groups in the cellulose macromolecules (Fig. S11, ESI†). As a result, the NWF could be easily penetrated by the MXene aqueous solution, and the color of the fabric rapidly changed from white to black (inset, Fig. S11 and Video S1, ESI†). The XRD pattern of MNWF showed characteristic peaks of both MXene (002) plane and cellulose (1−10, 110, 200) planes, indicating that MXene was successfully attached to the fibers in the NWF (Fig. 1(g)).46,47 Moreover, as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the facile and strong adsorption of MXene nanosheets on the surface of the cellulose fibers could be promoted by hydrogen bonding between the abundant hydrophilic groups of MXene and cellulose. Fig. 1(h) shows the FTIR spectrum of the MXene, NWF, and MNWF. It can be seen that the frequency of –OH in MNWF is red-shifted at 3335 cm−1 compared to NWF, indicating the formation of H-bonds with weakly interacting anions.48 Furthermore, the stretching vibration absorption peaks of –OH of MXene at 3436 cm−1 and 558 cm−1 become broader and less sharp in MNWF. These results demonstrate the formation of H-bonds between MXene and NWF, as documented in other reports.49,50 Thus, a uniform and dense MXene coating was formed on the NWF (Fig. 1(e) and Fig. S10a–f, ESI†), which is expected to be favorable for the subsequent uniform growth of metal NPs.
Owing to its abundance of reduction sites, Ti3C2Tx can adsorb and reduce noble metal ions from the solution.51–53 Importantly, this self-reduction strategy can be used to control the loading of noble metals on the surface of MXene without the use of reducing agents. Using the self-reduction strategy, the MNWF surface was decorated with a layer of uniformly distributed AuNPs (or AgNPs). The distribution density of the metal NPs on the composite fabric was successfully adjusted by changing the metal to MXene mass ratio (Fig. S13, ESI†). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping further confirmed that both AuNPs and AgNPs were uniformly distributed on MNWF (Fig. 1(f) and Fig. S14, ESI†). The XRD patterns of the metal NPs@MNWF composites showed characteristic peaks corresponding to the (111) and (200) planes of the metal NPs and the (002) plane of MXene, indicating the successful incorporation of metal NPs to form metal NPs@MXene composites (Fig. 1(g) and Fig. S15, ESI†).54 Thus, this simple, efficient, and green self-reduction strategy enables the controllable growth of metal NPs on the surface of flexible substrates, providing a new approach for constructing multidimensional (0D/2D) conductive networks.
The AuNPs/Ti3C2Tx MXene composites were characterized by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (aberration-corrected-STEM) with a resolution of <0.1 nm to verify the ability of Ti3C2Tx to reduce noble metal ions when the relative content of Au was 2 wt% (Fig. 1(i)). The aberration-corrected-STEM image of the obtained AuNPs and the corresponding fast Fourier transform pattern yielded a d-spacing of 1.44 Å for the (220) crystal plane, which is consistent with the reported literature.55 Corresponding EDS mapping confirmed the distribution of Au on the Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheet. To further explore the self-reduction mechanism, changes in the binding energies and valence states on the MNWF surface before and after AuNP growth were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Fig. 1(j), (k), Fig. S16, ESI†). Fitting of the narrow scan spectra of Ti 2p revealed that the most common forms of Ti in Ti3C2Tx were metastable Ti2+ and Ti3+ (total of 91.29%) (Fig. 1(j) and Table S3, ESI†). As these species have lower standard electrode potentials, they can reduce metal ions (AuCl4−, Ag+, and other noble metal ions) with higher standard electrode potentials (Table S4, ESI†). Notably, in the Ti 2p spectrum of AuNPs@MNWF, the bimodal area associated with TiO2 was increased, indicating that metastable Ti2+ and Ti3+ were partially oxidized to Ti4+ upon the reduction of AuCl4−. In addition, the high-resolution Au 4f spectrum of AuNPs@MNWF showed two characteristic peaks at 87.9 and 84.2 eV corresponding to the binding energies of Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2, respectively, thus confirming that AuCl4− was successfully reduced to Au0 (Fig. 1(k) and Table S5, ESI†).56 A mechanism for the spontaneous redox reaction of AuCl4− on MXene is proposed in Fig. 1(l). Similarly, in the high-resolution Ag 3d spectrum of AgNPs@MNWF, characteristic peaks were observed at 368.4 and 374.4 eV corresponding to the binding energies of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2, respectively, indicating that Ag+ also underwent redox reactions with MXene (Fig. S17 and Table S5, ESI†).37 Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†), the valence states of C, O, F, and other elements in the composite fabric were consistent with those of the elements in MXene (Tables S6–S8, ESI†). Thus, the self-reduction process involves a redox reaction between metastable Ti2+ (and Ti3+) and noble metal ions.
Despite the formation of AuNPs@MXene heterojunctions on the surface of the NWF, the air permeability of the fabric was not affected, reaching an excellent value of 237.7 mm s−1 (Fig. S19a and b, ESI†). Additionally, after vigorous washing, the resistance of the composite fabric only increased slightly. Furthermore, the color of the AuNPs@MNWF composite did not change after washing in deionized water at 600 rpm min−1 for 12 h (Fig. S20, ESI†), indicating the excellent adhesion fastness between the AuNPs@MXene heterojunction and the substrate, which is advantageous for applications in wearable smart textiles.
3.2 Sensing performance
To ensure the flexibility of the pressure sensor, a flexible transparent PI-IDE was selected for electrical signal transmission (Fig. S21a–c, ESI†). The assembled sensor was ultrathin (thickness: 0.75 mm) and could be easily supported by a leaf (Fig. S22a–c, ESI†). To evaluate the sensing performance, the pressure sensor was placed on a force measuring platform and connected to an electrochemical workstation through copper wires to record the current signal in real time (Fig. S23, ESI†). Sensitivity (S), an essential parameter for evaluating sensor performance, is defined as the ratio of the changes in current and pressure (S = (ΔI/I0)/ΔP, where I0 is the current without external pressure, ΔI is the change in current, and ΔP is the change in applied pressure).57 A comprehensive comparison of MXene loading, surface resistance, mechanical properties, and sensor sensitivity for MNWF composites with different MXene concentrations showed that the MNWF−5-based pressure sensor had the best sensing performance (Smax = 6.6 kPa−1) (Fig. S24a–f, ESI†). A suitable MXene solution concentration allowed the conductive material to be evenly distributed on the fiber surface without stacking, thus establishing a stable and continuous conductive network, which is beneficial for enhancing sensing performance.
It is desirable to develop flexible pressure sensors with both high sensitivity and a wide linear sensing range. Although the MNWF-based pressure sensor exhibits a wide linear sensing range, satisfactory sensitivity has not yet been achieved. The synergy effect of components with different dimensions may be effective for developing flexible piezoresistive sensors with high sensitivity and a wide linear sensing range.24 Therefore, to improve the sensitivity of the MNWF-based pressure sensor, a “brick–mortar” hierarchical structure (MNWF as “bricks” and 0D metal NPs as “mortar) was constructed by introducing metal NPs and forming 0D/2D composites with MXene. Noble metal NPs are ideal conductive nanomaterials for preparing flexible pressure sensors owing to their high electrical conductivity, plasmonic effect, and good antibacterial activity.38 Here, the mass ratio of Ti3C2Tx was fixed at 2.1 wt%, and the effect of varying the AuNP content on sensor sensitivity was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S25 (ESI†), the device current increased as the AuNP content increased, which was attributed to the excellent electrical conductivity of AuNPs. However, the sensitivity first increased and then decreased with the increase in the AuNP content. The AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 pressure sensor achieved a maximum sensitivity of 24.5 kPa−1, which was 4 times higher than that of the MNWF−5-based sensor (Fig. 2(b)), indicating that the construction of moderate AuNPs@MNWF composites effectively increases the pressure–electrical response. Interestingly, the composite fabrics with different AgNP contents also showed enhanced pressure sensing performance (Fig. S26a–c, ESI†). Therefore, we believe that the introduction of 0D metal NPs to construct metal NPs–MXene nanosheet hierarchical composite structure via this simple, controllable, and green self-reduction method is an effective general strategy for enhancing the pressure sensing performance.

(c) Sensitivity of flexible AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 pressure sensors. (d) I–V curves at low static pressures (0–2 kPa). (e) Effect of the compression rate on the ΔI/I0 curves at 50 kPa. (f) Response/recovery times. (g) Stability over 6000 loading/unloading cycles at 60 kPa. (h) Comparison of AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 with the reported pressure sensors with respect to sensitivity, working range, response/recovery times, and durability. 
Furthermore, the sensing performance of the AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 flexible piezoresistive sensor was investigated. According to the relationship between the relative current change (ΔI/I0) and pressure, the sensitivity of AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 exhibited two linear regions, with a high sensitivity of 24.5 kPa−1 at 0–100 kPa and a somewhat lower sensitivity of 16.34 kPa−1 at 100–150 kPa (Fig. 2(c)). This high sensitivity was mainly attributed to the hierarchical structure of the AuNPs@MXene composites and the synergistic effects of 0D/2D nanomaterials. Under static pressures in the range of 0–120 kPa, the device exhibited linear current–voltage (I–V) curves that passed through the origin (Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S27, ESI†). This behavior indicates that a good ohmic contact was formed between the AuNPs@MNWF active layer and the PI-IDE. As shown by the output sensing signal versus the dynamic input pressure curve at an applied pressure of 50 kPa, the output sensing wave matched the input pressure wave (Fig. S28, ESI†). Thus, the output sensing signal was able to accurately track and reflect the input pressure signal. Furthermore, ΔI/I0 was found to gradually increase with an increase in the applied pressure, indicating that this sensor could identify the weight of an object by effectively distinguishing between different degrees of pressure (Fig. S29, ESI†).
To demonstrate the suitability of the sensor for various practical application conditions, the sensor response to repetitive force was evaluated at various speeds. The sensor showed excellent adaptability to changes in speed (Fig. 2(e)). The response and recovery times were determined to be 40 and 60 ms, respectively, indicating that this sensor could respond quickly to external stimuli and then return to its original state (Fig. 2(f)). The long-term stability and durability of the sensor were evaluated by applying 60 kPa to the sensor for 6000 continuous compression–release cycles for up to 50000 s (Fig. 2(g)). Surprisingly, no significant attenuation of the output electrical signal was observed during cycling (inset, Fig. 2(g)), indicating the suitability of this sensor for long-term use. Compared with the previously reported fabric-based flexible pressure sensors,58–64 the AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 sensor exhibits high sensitivity, a wide linear sensing range, excellent durability, and a fast response time (Fig. 2(h) and Table S9, ESI†). This excellent performance was attributed to the construction of multidimensional composites and the unique hierarchical structure of the fiber network in the NWF.
The prepared pressure sensor is composed of three parts: the encapsulation layer (PDMS film), the active layer (metal NPs@MNWF), and the electrode layer (PI-IDE). Since the PDMS film is water repellent and moisture impermeable, it protects the device from humidity. We compared the current change of the sensor under the same pressure in air and water, as shown in Fig. S30 (ESI†). Although the current of the sensor in water is slightly lower than that in the air, which is mainly due to the combined action of water pressure and buoyancy, the signal of the sensor is still very stable, and the trends between the two are entirely consistent, which indicates that the presence of an external encapsulation layer enables the sensor to exhibit excellent resistance to humidity interference.
3.3 Sensing mechanism
The piezoresistive sensing mechanism of the AuNPs@MNWF flexible pressure sensor was systematically investigated. The efficient established conductive network was analyzed from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives using conductive path theory to explain the sensing mechanism. Fig. 3(a) shows a schematic of the sensor with and without pressure. The resistance of the sensor can be divided into two main components: Rc, which originates from the contact between the conductive fabric and the PI-IDE, and Rf, which originates from the contact between the loose fiber network in the conductive fabric and the MXene nanosheet–metal NP composites. That is, Rtotal = Rc + Rf. Together, these components form a complete conductive path. Under pressure, the relative resistance changes of the pressure sensor depend on the contact area of each part, which is called the contact area change mechanism.
 Fig. 3  Sensing mechanism. (a) Schematic of the sensing mechanism of the AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 pressure sensor. SEM images of the cross-section of the AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 pressure sensor at the same position (b)–(d) without pressure, (e)–(g) with a low pressure, and (h)–(j) with a high pressure. 
To study the evolution of the conductive network under pressure, a cross-section of the sensor was observed using SEM. There was only partial contact between the conductive fabric and the PI-IDE in the absence of applied pressure. Furthermore, the fiber network structure in the conductive fabric was loose, with only a few of the conductive fibers in contact with each other. Consequently, few conductive paths were constructed and the total resistance of the device was high (Fig. 3(b)–(d)). When a low pressure was applied, the distance between the conductive fabric and the PI-IDE was compressed, which increased the contact area and caused Rc to decrease sharply (Fig. 3(e)–(g)). As the pressure increased further, the conductive fiber network was gradually compressed, and the contact area between the conductive fibers increased, resulting in an increase in the number of conduction paths and a decrease in the resistance of the fabric (Fig. 3(h)–(j)). Under a high pressure, the metal NPs@MXene heterojunctions on the fibers became stacked, similar to fish scales, which reduced the spacing between the sheets. As a result of this closer contact between the sheets, Rf was further reduced. To visualize the sensing mechanism, a series circuit was constructed by connecting the device, an LED lamp, and a 3 V power supply, as shown in Fig. S31a (ESI†). The brightness of the LED lamp increased when a heavier weight was placed on the device, indicating that the current in the circuit increased gradually with pressure, which is consistent with the previous analysis (Fig. S31b–f and Video S2, ESI†).
3.4 Sensing applications
Based on the satisfactory sensing performance of the AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 flexible pressure sensor, various practical applications were evaluated. When cups containing different volumes of water were placed, ΔI/I0 increased with the increase in water volume, indicating that the sensor could be used for fingertip pressure measurements during finger gripping (Fig. 4(a)). As shown by the real-time signal output under finger touch (Fig. 4(b)), the sensor displayed a sensitive and fast response to continuous dynamic touch. Moreover, the sensor accurately recognized the 26 letters of the alphabet when written with a pen on the sensor surface. Moreover, similar current waveforms were observed for each letter when repeated 3 times, confirming the high sensitivity and good stability of the sensor (Fig. S32, ESI†). In addition, the sensor was used to monitor the flexion and extension of human joints, such as fingers and wrists (Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S33, ESI†). When the joint was bent, the sensor was squeezed in the vertical direction, the resistance decreased, and the current response increased. By contrast, when the joint was extended, the squeezing force disappeared, the sensor returned to the initial state, and the current response decreased to the initial value. Therefore, the fabricated sensor shows promise for use in human motion monitoring.

(h) Images of the electronic skin sensor array in the flat and curled states.

Pulse waves are an essential physiological signal in humans and contain important health information related to physical conditions, including blood pressure, vascular aging, exercise, medication, and sleep status.65,66 The pulse detection ability of the sensor was evaluated when fixed to the wrist of a 26 year old female volunteer. A pulse rate of 78 beats per min was detected by the sensor (Fig. 4(d)), which is consistent with the normal pulse range of adult women (60–100 beats per min). Moreover, the three characteristic peaks of a single pulse (P-wave, T-wave, and D-wave, which correspond to the percussive, tidal and diastolic waves, respectively) were clearly detected owing to the high sensitivity of the sensor (inset, Fig. 4(d)). The radial enhancement index (Alx = P2/P1) can be calculated based on these waves to obtain important information on arteriosclerosis. As the obtained AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 sensor can accurately identify the pulse, it has potential as a wearable clinical diagnostic device.
COVID-19 has profoundly affected everyday life, and wearing a mask remains the easiest and most effective way to prevent infection. Smart masks can easily and continuously monitor breathing information, which is beneficial for maintaining personal health and preventing the spread of diseases.67 To explore the applicability of AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 in respiratory monitoring, the sensor was implanted in the middle layer of a conventional mask to avoid direct contact with facial skin (Fig. 4(e)). The response of the sensor under different breathing conditions was tested (Fig. 4(f)). With smart masks, breathing conditions, such as normal breathing, gasping, and coughing, can be successfully monitored, and these different breathing conditions can be accurately distinguished based on differences in the signal waveforms. Both gasping and coughing exhibited higher amplitudes than normal breathing, and the waveforms corresponding to coughing were randomly distributed. Thus, the AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 sensor can potentially be used in smart masks for the continuous monitoring of respiratory conditions to prevent respiratory-related epidemics.
Spatial pressure resolution cannot be achieved using a single sensor. Therefore, for applications in fields such as electronic skin and human–computer interactions, it is necessary to fabricate integrated pressure sensor arrays.19 Here, a 4 × 4 pixel flexible electronic skin sensing array was fabricated using 16 flexible pressure sensors (Fig. 4(g)). The flat electronic skin sensing array could be easily rolled into a cylinder, demonstrating its thinness and flexibility (Fig. 4(h)). This sensing array accurately recorded and reflected the spatial pressure distribution by detecting the changes in the current in each pixel. When three different objects (carrot-shaped pen, wrench, and tape) were placed on the electronic skin sensing array, the corresponding pressure distributions were clearly visualized (Fig. 4(i)). Moreover, the obtained current response was related to the applied pressure, which depended on the weight of the object, with a higher weight producing a darker color at the corresponding position. These results demonstrate the spatial pressure recognition and localization ability of the electronic skin sensing array, which is expected to be beneficial for human–computer interactions.
3.5 Electrothermal conversion properties
In addition to interesting sensing properties, flexible conductive smart textiles are increasingly being developed with various additional functions to address the requirements of complex applications. For example, heating in extremely cold environments is necessary for polar explorers. Thus, sensors that can monitor the vital signs of an explorer while also maintaining warmth would be of considerable utility. Furthermore, smart seat cushions or mattresses with both sensing and heating functions could provide heat, thus meeting comfort requirements, while also detecting human sleep conditions or posture.
Owing to the superior electrical conductivity of metal NPs, the composite fabrics were expected to exhibit Joule heating performance. Joule heating measurements were performed using a DC power source to apply a series of constant input voltages to a composite fabric sample (size:1.5 cm × 2 cm) and an infrared (IR) camera to record the temperature evolution on the fabric surface (Fig. 5(a)). The electrothermal conversion performance of the three composite fabrics (MNWF−5, AgNPs−6@MNWF−5, and AuNPs−6@MNWF−5) at a constant voltage of 7.5 V was compared (Fig. 5(b)). AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 exhibited the superior electrothermal conversion performance because the AgNPs significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity of the composite fabric. The conductor with a smaller resistance will generate more Joule heat under the same voltage, resulting in a higher temperature on the conductor surface.36 As shown in Fig. 5(c), the saturation temperature of the AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 composite increased with the voltage. At a low voltage of 3 V, a saturation temperature of 32 °C was achieved within 15 s, whereas the saturation temperature increased further to 95 and 130 °C at 7.5 and 9 V, respectively. Thus, the ideal saturation temperature can be rapidly achieved. Moreover, the moderate driving voltage is safe for humans and will allow such devices to be easily powered using a portable battery. The gradient heating process at 3–9 V showed that the electrothermal conversion performance of the composite fabric is controllable, and the corresponding IR thermograph revealed a uniform temperature distribution on the surface of the fabric during the heating process (Fig. 5(d)). Furthermore, the saturation temperature could also be adjusted by tailoring the size of the fabric sample.

(b) Joule heating performance of MNWF−5, AuNPs−6@MNWF−5, and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 at the constant voltage of 7.5 V. (c) Joule heating performance of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 at voltages of 3–9 V. (d) Gradient heating curves of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 at 3–9 V and the corresponding IR thermograms. (e) Long-term heating performance of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 at the constant voltage of 6 V over 1500 s. (f) Cyclic heating performance of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 at the constant voltage of 6 V. (g) Cyclic heating procedure and the corresponding IR thermograms. (h) IR images and the corresponding temperatures of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 in the stretched, twisted, and bent states. 
To evaluate the stability and cyclability of the electrothermal conversion performance, the surface temperature of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 was observed over time at a constant voltage of 6 V (Fig. 5(e)). Notably, the saturation temperature of the composite fabric reached 65 °C at a high heating rate and then remained relatively stable over 1500 s, confirming excellent long-term heating reliability. In addition, when a constant voltage of 6 V was repeatedly applied and removed, the observed temperature changes were consistent over 10 cycles, indicating excellent heating cyclability (Fig. 5(f) and (g)). The IR images and the corresponding temperatures of the composite fabric in different states (stretched, twisted, and bent) are shown in Fig. 5(h). Interestingly, despite the composite fabric not being flat, the electrothermal conversion performance was not affected, indicating that the fabric heater can maintain excellent heating capacity on curved surfaces, which is very promising for wearable applications. For comparison, the corresponding electrothermal conversion properties of the other two composite fabrics (MNWF−5 and AuNPs−6@MNWF−5) were also evaluated (Fig. S34 and S35, ESI†). Compared with the metal NPs@MNWF composite, the Joule heating performance of MNWF is slightly inferior, which is attributed to the better electrical conductivity of the composite fabric by the metal NPs. These findings indicate that the addition of metal NPs can effectively improve the electrothermal conversion capability of the composite fabric. This enhancement was attributed to the excellent electrical conductivity of the metal NPs, which can effectively reduce the resistance of the composite fabric. Therefore, the introduction of metal NPs into composite fabrics can be considered as a general strategy for improving the electrothermal conversion performance.
3.6 Photothermal conversion properties
Although the composite fabrics exhibited excellent electrothermal conversion properties, the use of electrical energy limits the extended applications of heaters both temporally and spatially. Thus, it is desirable to develop smart wearable fabric heaters that can be driven by solar energy, which is a green, renewable, and free resource.68 MXene nanosheets can absorb the full solar spectrum owing to their unique structure and physical properties, and MXene-coated fabrics have been reported to exhibit promising photothermal conversion performance.31,36,69 In addition, metal NPs with plasmonic effects, including AgNPs and AuNPs, can absorb more light in certain wavelength ranges owing to resonant coupling of the incident light dipole, thus enhancing the conversion of incident light into heat.37 Consequently, compared with MNWF, AgNPs@MNWF and AuNPs@MNWF were expected to exhibit improved photothermal conversion performance.

Fig. 6(a) shows a schematic of the photothermal conversion process. IR imaging technology was used to visualize the surface temperature changes of the fabrics. The thermal images of the four fabrics (NWF, MNWF−5, AuNPs−6@MNWF−5, and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5) were acquired over time, and the corresponding time–temperature curves were recorded under simulated sunlight irradiation at the power of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 6(b) and (c)). The surface temperatures of all the samples, except NWF, increased gradually with time. Higher temperatures were observed for AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 than for MNWF−5, which is likely due to the synergy between the plasmonic effect of the introduced metal NPs and the MXene nanosheets. In addition, AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 exhibited the best photothermal conversion performance, reaching a saturation temperature of 61.3 °C after irradiation for 100 s. Furthermore, IR thermograms of composite fabrics with different AgNPs contents were collected under simulated sunlight irradiation at a power of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. S36, ESI†). The UV–Vis absorption spectra showed that the light absorption intensities of the AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 solutions were higher than that of the MXene solution at the same concentration, confirming that the introduction of metal NPs enhanced the light absorption capacity of these materials (Fig. 6(d)). Notably, the absorption of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 was enhanced at all wavelengths, which explains why this material exhibited the best photothermal conversion performance.

(b) IR thermograms of NWF, MNWF−5, AuNPs−6@MNWF−5, and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 irradiated at 100 mW cm−2 for different times. (c) Surface temperature curves of NWF, MNWF−5, AuNPs−6@MNWF−5, and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 under irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. (d) UV–Vis absorption spectra of MXene, AgNPs@MXene, and AuNPs@MXene. (e) Time evolution of the surface temperature of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 at different irradiation powers (100, 150, and 200 mW cm−2). (f) Cyclic heating performance of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 (100 mW cm−2). (g) Image and the corresponding IR thermogram of bent AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. (h) IR thermograms of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 attached to a hand. 
The saturation temperature of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 increased with the irradiation power, reaching a maximum of 75.2 °C at 200 mW cm−2 (Fig. 6(e)). In addition, the cyclability of the photothermal conversion of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 was investigated by repeated irradiation with simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2. The observed changes in temperature were consistent over six cycles, indicating that the fabric has good cyclability (Fig. 6(f)). Interestingly, when the composite fabric was folded or wound, the light-to-heat conversion performance was not affected (Fig. 6(g) and Fig. S37, ESI†). In addition, as shown in Fig. 6(h), when the fabric was placed on the palm of a volunteer, the surface temperature increased rapidly under irradiation with simulated sunlight, reaching 48.4 °C within 180 s. This result demonstrates the potential of such devices for wearable heater applications, and this strategy is also promising to enhance photothermal properties to other flexible wearable devices.
3.7 Antibacterial properties
For smart cushions or mattresses, effective antibacterial properties are essential. In the context of COVID-19, the development of products with antibacterial and bacteriostatic effects is also important for epidemic prevention and control. MXenes are among the most promising antibacterial nanomaterials, and the prepared metal NPs@MNWF composites are expected to provide enhanced antibacterial activity.

Fig. 7(a) shows the colony growth of E. coli and S. aureus treated with NWF, MNWF−5, AuNPs−6@MNWF−5, and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5. Compared with NWF, the number of E. coli colonies and S. aureus colonies treated with MNWF−5 was considerably reduced. Notably, only a few or no colonies grew, which were treated with AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5. In particular, the bacterial reduction rates of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 on E. coli and S. aureus were as high as 99.9% and 98.6%, respectively. Besides, the bacterial reduction rates of AuNPs−6@MNWF−5 on E. coli and S. aureus were 90.6% and 81.4%, both higher than those of MNWF (81.3% and 58.9%) (Fig. 7(b)). It is indicated that the addition of noble metal NPs can significantly enhance antibacterial activity on both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria.
 Fig. 7  Antibacterial properties. (a) Image of agar plates onto which E. coli and S. aureus bacterial cells were recultivated after treatment with NWF, MNWF−5, AuNPs−6@MNWF−5, and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5, respectively (left to right); (b) bacterial reduction rate of NWF, MNWF−5, AuNPs−6@MNWF−5, and AgNPs−6@MNWF−5; (c) schematic antibacterial mechanism of the AgNPs@MNWF composite. 
In addition, the antibacterial activity of the AgNPs−6@NWF containing only AgNPs on E. coli was tested, as shown in Fig. S38 (ESI†). The bacterial reduction rate of AgNPs−6@NWF is 22.05%, much lower than that of AgNPs−6@MNWF−5, which is caused by the low content of AgNPs (only 0.12 wt% of NWF). Benefiting from the synergistic antibacterial effect of MXene nanosheets and AgNPs, AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 is endowed with an excellent antibacterial effect. The antibacterial mechanism of the AgNPs@MNWF composite is shown in Fig. 7(c). The hydrophilic and negative ion surfaces of the MXene nanosheets can adhere to the bacterial surface and destroy the bacterial cell wall, resulting in the leakage of a large amount of bacterial cytoplasmic components.35 However, AgNPs release Ag+ into bacterial cells, which can bind to the sulfhydryl compounds in cellular enzymes, thereby destroying the bacterial respiratory chain and generating reactive oxygen species, resulting in bacterial oxidative stress and cell damage.70 These synergistic effects were responsible for the excellent antibacterial properties of the composite fabric. These results show that the introduction of metal NPs significantly improves the antibacterial properties, indicating that the composite fabrics are safe to use, especially in healthcare products. Thus, the introduction of metal NPs is promising as a general strategy for producing flexible wearable devices with antibacterial properties.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a general strategy was developed to enhance the sensing performance of MNWF composites and realize multifunctional applications by introducing metal NPs. The metal NPs@MNWF composites obtained by the self-reduction strategy exhibited a 0D/2D/3D “brick–mortar” hierarchical structure, in which metal NPs were highly dispersed on the surfaces of MXene nanosheets. In the self-reduction process, the reduction of noble metals was found to be mainly driven by metastable Ti species on the surface of MXene. The introduction of noble metal NPs significantly improved the performance of the flexible pressure sensor, with an increase in sensitivity from 6.6 to 24.5 kPa−1 and good stability over 6000 cycles. Simultaneously, the introduction of noble metal NPs considerably improved the photothermal, electrothermal, and antibacterial properties of the flexible devices. For example, the Joule heating performance of the AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 composite was enhanced by 25.3 °C at a voltage of 7.5 V owing to the excellent electrical conductivity of the metal NPs. Under irradiation by simulated sunlight, the photothermal performance was improved by 5.6 °C, mainly due to the plasmonic effect of the metal NPs. Furthermore, the AgNPs−6@MNWF−5 composite exhibited a bacteriostatic efficiency as high as 99.9% owing to the synergistic antibacterial mechanisms of AgNPs and MXene. Therefore, the introduction of noble metal NPs is promising as a general strategy for endowing flexible devices with multifunctional properties.
