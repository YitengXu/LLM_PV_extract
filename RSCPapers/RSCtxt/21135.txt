    , Accepted 14th October 2019First published on 16th October 2019AbstractLow-temperature deposited gallium nitride (GaN) thin-films have been introduced into planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as electron transport layers (ETLs) for the first time. Compact and amorphous n-type GaN layers were uniformly coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates via plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) technology, in which an optimized deposition temperature of 280 °C was identified and adopted. The as-prepared GaN thin-films were subsequently employed to fabricate planar PSCs with the device configuration FTO/GaN/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Interestingly, although a conduction-band-minimum (CBM) mismatch of 0.59 eV is found at the interface of the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN/perovskite, a significantly enhanced device efficiency from 10.38% to 15.18% has also been achieved relative to the ETL-free PSCs. Meanwhile, the current–voltage hysteresis and device stability of GaN-based PSCs can be remarkably improved. It is found that the GaN layer can promote the electron extraction and reduce recombination at the FTO/perovskite interface. This work demonstrates the feasibility and potential of GaN films as ETLs in planar PSCs.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have tremendous potential due to low-cost processing methods and excellent optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials. The latest certified efficiency for PSCs has reached values up to 25.2% within only a few years of efforts due to the development of more efficient materials and structures, as well as the deep understanding of carrier dynamics.1–10 However, some issues still need to be urgently solved, such as hysteresis and long-term stability, which are related to the imperfect carrier transport and interfacial contact. Generally, n–i–p PSCs can be typically fabricated in either mesoporous or planar configurations based on electron transport layers (ETLs), but both configurations consist of a transparent conducting oxide (FTO or ITO), a mesoporous or planar ETL, a perovskite light absorber, a hole transport layer (HTL) and an electrode (Au, Ag, carbon, etc.). Among these, the ETL is of crucial importance to accelerate electron extraction, transportation and collection from the perovskite layer to the transparent electrode as well as to restrain the unfavourable interfacial charge recombination.11–13 General requirements for ETLs in PSCs are considered to include the following: (i) high electron mobility for fast charge transport and good electrical conductivity for minimal series resistance (Rs); (ii) favourable energy level alignment with the perovskite layer for fast electron extraction and hole blocking; and (iii) a pin-hole-free structure to avoid direct contact between hole-transportation and the transparent electrode.14,15 Although fast electron extraction and injection have been achieved for the most common TiO2 ETL, it still has drawbacks such as relatively low electron mobility and poor photostability. Moreover, a high-temperature sintering (400–500 °C) is usually required for TiO2 ETLs.16,17 Therefore, other inorganic ETLs such as SnO2 and ZnO, as well as organic ETLs, such as fullerene and its derivatives, have also been studied to replace TiO2.18,19 However, to achieve higher photovoltaic performance, efforts are still essential to constantly explore new materials and technologies for the ETLs in PSCs.
Gallium nitride (GaN) is a direct-gap semiconductor with a bulk bandgap of 3.4 eV (wurtzite crystal) similar to metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, etc.),20,21 and is a promising ETL candidate for PSCs due to its merits of good transparency, chemical stability, and high theoretical electron mobility (up to ∼1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K).22,23 So far, GaN has been applied in high electron mobility transistors, InGaN based solar cells and photodetectors.24 However, to the best of our knowledge, only Alex Zettl et al. have reported a type of GaN ETL-based PSC, in which GaN ETLs were prepared through a relatively complicated treatment of the commercial GaN on a Si wafer.25 GaN films are normally deposited on SiC, sapphire or crystalline silicon (c-Si) substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).26,27 Although GaN epitaxial films with high electron mobilities have been achieved by MOCVD or MBE, the need for up to 800 °C deposition temperatures restricts their application in solar cells, far beyond the tolerable temperature of the frequently used transparent electrodes (FTO or ITO). Therefore, exploring alternative low-temperature deposition methods for high quality GaN films on FTO or ITO substrates may open up new opportunities for their use in solar cells.
So far, deposition of GaN films in the temperature range of 300–600 °C has been achieved by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and electron cyclotron resonance plasma enhanced MOCVD technology.28,29 Besides, GaN films have also been deposited by RF-magnetron sputtering below 150 °C.30 Plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) is a typically low-temperature deposition technology. Besides, PEALD offers unique advantages such as high control of film uniformity, conformality, and sub-nanometre thickness due to its self-limiting growth mechanism; typically, it can significantly lower GaN growth temperature below 300 °C.31–33 However, the quality of GaN thin films obtained by this way is relatively poor, with significantly reduced electrical conductivity and mobility compared to those prepared by MBE or MOCVD. In previous studies, Ozgit-Akgun et al. deposited GaN thin films at 100–500 °C by PEALD, and proved that a self-limiting ALD mode was feasible in the temperature range between 185 and 385 °C.34 Shih et al. prepared GaN thin films on Si(100) substrates by remote plasma ALD, and obtained GaN films with uniform and almost atomically flat surfaces at 200–500 °C.35 In our previous work, GaN thin films were grown on a Si(100) substrate by PEALD at the temperatures of 200–350 °C. We found that the crystalline quality can be improved by increasing deposition temperatures, that is, an ∼18 nm-thick amorphous layer was formed followed by a polycrystalline layer upon GaN deposition at 350 °C.36 Obviously, these research studies provide the possibility of the growth of GaN films on FTO substrates, even though thin film properties are related to the underlying substrate.
Here, a kind of low-temperature deposited GaN thin film on FTO substrates has been obtained via PEALD with a preliminary optimized deposition temperature of 280 °C. The effect of deposition parameters on the morphology, composition and photoelectric properties of the GaN thin films is systematically investigated. Subsequently, PEALD-prepared GaN is incorporated into planar PSCs by assembling a FTO/GaN/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au configuration. The effect of GaN thickness on interfacial electron transport, charge recombination and photovoltaic performance in planar PSCs was carefully evaluated. The results show that a device with a 50-PEALD-cycle GaN ETL can reach an efficiency of 15.18%, much higher than the 10.38% of ETL-free PSCs. This work shows the feasibility of using nitrides as ETLs in PSCs. Further work is underway to evaluate the potential of using doping to improve the GaN electronic mobility and to pattern GaN surfaces to improve the quality of perovskite films.
Results and discussion
The GaN films used here are deposited on FTO substrates at an optimized temperature of 280 °C by using triethylgallium (TEG) as the Ga precursor and Ar/N2/H2 (1:3:6) plasma as the N source. The specific PEALD-GaN deposition process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1; a complete ALD cycle consists of a TEG dose for 0.5 s and an Ar purge for 30 s followed by a plasma exposure for 30 s and a reaction time of 45 s and an Ar purge for 30 s. A Si(100)/GaN sample was prepared under the same conditions as a reference, because the FTO glass substrate is too fragile to be ion milled during sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurement. In general, higher quality GaN thin films can be obtained more easily on c-Si substrates than on rougher FTO glass. According to the high-resolution TEM image in Fig. S1,† an ∼18 nm-thick GaN layer obtained on the Si(100) substrate is still amorphous, and it is thus inferred that the GaN grown on FTO is also amorphous.
 Fig. 1  Schematics of the PEALD deposition process used for the growth of GaN thin films. 
The thickness of the GaN film depends on the number of PEALD cycles, and a deposition rate (growth per cycle, GPC) of ∼1.0 Å per cycle was determined by ellipsometry. Here, for ease of characterization, a relatively thick GaN layer with 200 PEALD cycles (∼19 nm thickness) is selected as a representative sample to study the morphology, composition, and optical absorption. Fig. 2a and c show the AFM images of blank FTO glass and of the FTO/GaN sample, respectively, whereas Fig. 2b and d show the complementary SEM images. It can be seen that the GaN layer uniformly covers the FTO crystal surfaces and smoothens the sharp FTO crystal edges, and as a result, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the FTO surface is decreased from 16.6 nm to 15.5 nm. A similar phenomenon has also been reported in the literature for metal oxides grown on FTO glass by ALD.37

UV-vis absorption spectra of a 200-PEALD-cycle GaN film on FTO glass are given in Fig. 3a. For comparison, an obviously thinner GaN film (50 PEALD cycles) is also measured to determine the effect of GaN thickness on the absorption properties. Two peaks are found in these two samples, the peak located at 325 nm is attributed to the absorption peak of GaN related to the bandgap.38 The absorption peak is red-shifted from 325 to 350 nm when the film thickness is increased from 50 to 200 PEALD cycles; however, its intensity decreased. A thicker GaN film tends to have lower dislocation densities due to the thickness dependent inter-diffusion effects at the interface of GaN/substrates.39 Thus, the longer-wavelength peak could be a defect-related peak. The relationship of (αhν)1/2versus hν (where α is the optical absorption coefficient and hν is the photon energy) is plotted in Fig. S2† to estimate their bandgap values. Bandgap values of 3.62 eV and 3.71 eV were calculated for the 200-PEALD-cycle and 50-PEALD-cycle GaN films, respectively. Besides, from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results shown in Fig. 3b, poor crystallinity of the 200-PEALD-cycle GaN film is found. However, this situation could be improved for the obviously thicker 750-PEALD-cycle GaN film, which is similar to the above TEM analysis for the GaN/Si sample.

The bonding states of the 200-PEALD-cycle GaN thin film are analyzed by XPS, as shown in Fig. 3c, d and S3.† The N 1s XPS peak is deconvoluted into two peaks at 397.3 and 393.9 eV, which are assigned to N–Ga and Auger Ga, respectively. The Ga 3d XPS peak is also deconvoluted into two components at 20.1 and 20.6 eV corresponding to Ga–N and Ga–O bonds (Fig. 3c). Further quantitative analysis of the XPS measurements reveals that the GaN layer contains 32 at% Ga and 26 at% N as well as 27 at% C and 15 at% O. The detected C element is mainly derived from the unreacted precursor, while the Ga–O impurity is ascribed to the residual oxygen in the chamber.
The electrical properties of the GaN thin films, 50 (∼5 nm), 100 (∼9 nm) and 200 (∼19 nm) PEALD cycles of GaN thin films on glass substrates, such as their resistivity, mobility, and carrier density were determined from Hall effect measurements, as presented in Table 1. The room temperature Hall measurements reveal n-type conductivity for all the samples. Besides, the GaN film thickness has some effects on Hall mobility, that is, the 19 nm-thick GaN film shows a higher mobility (3.3 cm2 V−1 s−1) than the 4 nm-thick GaN film (0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1).

The as-prepared GaN films as the ETL on the FTO substrates are fabricated into planar PSCs, whose thickness is in the range between 10 and 80 PEALD cycles. The transmittance spectra shown in Fig. 4a clearly indicate that the transparency of the FTO glass is only minimally affected by the deposited GaN layer, a desirable result for solar cell application. An FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite absorber layer is subsequently deposited on top of the GaN films via the one-step spin-coating method described in the Experimental section. The wettability of the perovskite precursor on the GaN layers is evaluated using contact angle measurements (Fig. S4†), and the contact angles between the perovskite solvents (DMF and DMSO) and the GaN layers were found to be less than 50°. A bandgap of 1.55 eV was calculated for the perovskite layer based on the absorption edge at 794 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 4b).

It is well known that the energy level alignment between the GaN and perovskite layers is crucial for charge extraction and recombination in PSCs. Here, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to estimate the valence band minimum (VBM) and work function (Φ) values of the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN and perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 4c–f. Fig. 4c and d show the UPS spectra (for the Fermi edge and secondary electron cut-off, respectively), from which an ionization energy (IE) of 7.05 eV and a Φ of 4.27 eV were measured. A CBM value of 3.34 eV is further calculated based on the band-gap of 3.71 eV, also confirming that the as-prepared GaN film is n-type. Similarly, from the UPS spectra of the sample after perovskite deposition in Fig. 4e and f, it can also be inferred that the perovskite film is a p-type semiconductor with a CBM of 3.83 eV. This film is similar to the perovskite film grown on TiO2 in our previous report.40 By combining the CBM, VBM and Φ results of the p-type perovskite and n-type GaN, a p–n heterojunction model for the perovskite/GaN interface can be suggested.
PSC devices are further assembled by incorporating spiro-OMeTAD and Au electrodes. Unexpectedly, a 0.59 eV CBM mismatch is found at the interface of the GaN and perovskite layers in that case, which is usually considered unfavourable for device performance. In our cases, however, this energy-level mismatch does not seem to cause a severe deterioration in the cell performance, as will be shown in the next section.
Planar PSCs using GaN as the ETL are fabricated by following a FTO/GaN/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au structure, as shown schematically in Fig. 5a. According to the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 5b, an ∼700 nm-thick perovskite layer is coated on the FTO/GaN surface, followed by a 200 nm-thick spiro-OMeTAD layer and an 80 nm-thick Au electrode. From the top-view SEM image shown in Fig. 5c, it can be assessed that the perovskite layer deposited on the FTO/GaN surface is pin-hole free with an average grain size of ∼300 nm. Good crystallinity of the perovskite film grown on GaN which is crucial for high-efficiency PSCs could be obtained in our device. The effect of GaN thickness on the quality of perovskite films has been studied by comparing the top-view SEM images of the perovskite films grown on bare-FTO as well as on 10, 30, 50 and 80 PEALD cycle GaN layers, respectively. As shown in Fig. S5† it can be clearly observed that the perovskite films grown on 10–80 PEALD cycle GaN layers present a flatter surface and larger perovskite grains than those grown on a bare-FTO surface, suggesting that the introduction of the GaN layer improves the quality of perovskite films. However, no macroscopic difference can be distinguished for the perovskite films grown on the different GaN layers.

The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs is characterized via J–V measurements under AM 1.5G illumination, as summarized in Fig. 5d and Table 2, respectively, and backward scanning curves (from forward bias to short circuit) are adopted. As a reference, a device without any GaN layer (GaN-free PSC) is also prepared, and its efficiency is 10.38% with a Jsc of 19.91 mA cm−2, Voc of 952 mV, and FF of 0.548. The low performance is mainly ascribed to the serious charge recombination in the perovskite film due to poor electron extraction capacity. After a 10-PEALD-cycle GaN layer is introduced, the cell performance is improved with similar Jsc and Voc but a significantly enhanced FF (0.656) compared to that of the reference device. Upon increasing the GaN film thickness from 10 to 50 PEALD cycles, both Jsc and FF clearly improved, and the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based device presents an efficiency of 15.18%, with a Jsc of 22.56 mA cm−2, Voc of 977 mV and FF of 0.689. However, further increasing the GaN film thickness (to 80 cycles) will lead to obvious reduction in the Jsc and FF, thus leading to a lower efficiency (11.42%). Therefore, a too thick GaN layer is not beneficial to carrier transportation. For comparison, a TiO2 ETL-based PSC with the same configuration was also prepared using our previous method.40 The perovskite film on the TiO2 layer shows a similar morphology to that on a GaN layer (Fig. S6a†). From Fig. S6b,† the TiO2 ETL-based PSC shows a higher efficiency of 19.52% than the GaN ETL-based PSC, due to higher Voc and FF. Besides, the intensity of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum in the whole wavelength range increases with the GaN thickness increasing up to 50 PEALD cycles, indicating more efficient photo-responses and electron collection when increasing the GaN thickness, but reduces for the 80-PEALD-cycle GaN-based device (consistent with the J–V results), as shown in Fig. 5e. Fig. 5f depicts an integrated current (JI) of 21.96 mA cm−2 for the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based cell, close to the corresponding Jsc value (22.56 mA cm−2). Fig. S7† gives the statistic results of the GaN-free and 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based devices, whose average efficiencies are 10.12% and 14.92%, respectively. Meanwhile, the narrow distribution of the device efficiencies reflects good reproducibility.

Possible hysteresis effects are also studied by comparing the J–V curves measured in both forward and backward directions for the reference device (Fig. 5h) and the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based cell (Fig. 5g). For the reference device, a large hysteresis is observed between the forward and reverse scan efficiency (4.38% vs. 10.38%), whereas the hysteresis was significantly reduced for the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN ETL-based device (11.87% vs. 15.18%), as shown in Fig. 5h. It is generally believed that the most common reason for this hysteresis in the J–V curve may be halide ion migration, interfacial defects or unbalanced charge extraction.41 It appears that the properties of the perovskite/GaN interface in our cells play an important role in that hysteresis behavior. Relatively low electron mobility in the as-prepared GaN layer may result in charge accumulation at the GaN/perovskite interface, which is supposed to be partly responsible for this hysteresis in the PSCs. Obviously, further improving the electron mobility of our PEALD-GaN layer as well as the properties of the GaN/perovskite interface will be explored in our future work in order to minimize these effects. We also evaluated the ambient stability of the non-encapsulated 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based PSC, which was stored in the dark under ambient conditions (25 °C and ∼40 RH%). The cell was tested each day for 30 days. As shown in Fig. 5i, the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based PSC can retain 89% of its initial efficiency after 30 days of storage, clearly superior to the GaN-free PSC. Moreover, to check the long-term light and temperature stability, both the GaN-free and 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based PSCs were placed at 65 °C and ∼30 RH% in a nitrogen atmosphere without any encapsulation, and tested at the maximum power point under continuous AM1.5G illumination over 80 h. The evolution of normalized efficiency values during the test is depicted in Fig. S8.† The efficiency of the GaN-free device decreases to 29% of its initial value after 80 h because of the decrease of both Jsc and Voc. However, a gentle degradation of efficiency for the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based device can be seen, and the device retains 92% of its initial efficiency. According to previous reports, the potential reasons for this degradation include photo-activated defects and band alignment variation upon illumination, which lead to charge accumulation and recombination at the FTO/perovskite interface.42 Therefore, we speculate that the introduction of the GaN layer facilitates faster charge extraction and reduced interface recombination, thus leading to better stability.

Fig. 6 schematically shows the energy-level diagram of the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based PSCs, and a CBM mismatch of 0.59 eV at the GaN/perovskite interface can be clearly seen. In general, well-matched energy levels can boost electron extraction and reduce recombination. However, Minemoto et al. thought that the optimum CBM position of the buffer or blocking layer was 0.0–0.3 eV higher than that of the perovskite layer, taking into account the interface recombination.43 Kuang et al. reported that a CBM mismatch of 0.69 eV at the SnO2/perovskite interface does not cause a severe deterioration of the cell performance.42 As the tunneling strongly depends on tunneling-layer thickness, in our case, electron tunneling is supposed to occur in the ∼5 nm-thick GaN layer according to previous work on PbI2 or in the insulating tunneling contacts in PSCs.44–46 Consequently, the degraded efficiency of our 80-PEALD-cycle GaN-based PSC could be ascribed to the fact that the increased GaN layer thickness reduces the electron tunneling rate.

To further investigate the influence of the GaN layer on cell performance, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FTO/perovskite and FTO/GaN/perovskite systems were measured. As shown in Fig. 7a, the PL intensity was significantly quenched after inserting the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN layer between FTO and perovskite, indicating that the GaN layer can facilitate electron extraction effectively. The electron transport dynamics at the GaN/perovskite interfaces is further investigated by time-resolved PL, as shown in Fig. 7b. The average PL lifetime (τ) is estimated by fitting the curve with a double-exponential function, and relevant fitting parameters are listed in Table S1.† In general, shorter PL lifetimes can be attributed to better electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface. Indeed, when the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN layer is introduced between FTO and perovskite, the PL lifetime decreases from 47 to 21 ns. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurement helped us understand the charge transport and recombination properties of the PSCs with and without the GaN layer. Fig. 7c shows the Nyquist plots in the dark at 0.8 V, and the fitting results derived from the equivalent circuit model are summarized in Table S2.† Similar series resistance (Rs) values of ∼22 Ω for both the devices are evaluated from the high frequency intercept on the x-axis, indicating that the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN layer has a negligible effect on the contact resistance. The arc at the high frequency area represents the charge transport resistance (Rct) at the FTO/perovskite or GaN/perovskite interface. Based on the fitting results, the Rct value of the GaN-based device (82.6 kΩ) is slightly decreased compared to that of the GaN-free device (87.5 kΩ), reflecting an improvement of carrier transport to some extent. The other arc at the low frequency region corresponds to the charge recombination resistance (Rrec). The 50-PEALD-cycle GaN layer results in an increase of Rrec value from 137.5 to 169.1 kΩ, which indicates that the GaN layer can restrain the recombination at the FTO/perovskite interface.

Experimental
Reagents and materials
PbI2 (99.9985%), PbBr2 (99.9985%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and chlorobenzene were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium bromide (MABr), methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were purchased from Shanghai Materwin New Materials Co., Ltd. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp, and triethylgallium (TEG) (99.9999%) was acquired from Nanjing Aimouyuan Scientific Equipment Co., Ltd. All these chemicals were used directly, without further purification. Laser-patterned FTO glass (Pilkington, 2.2 mm thick, sheet resistance = 15 Ω sq−1) was sequentially cleaned with a mild detergent, distilled water and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, and finally dried under a nitrogen stream.
Deposition of GaN thin films
GaN thin films were deposited on FTO glass substrates using an Angstrom-dep III PEALD reactor (Thin Film Technologies Ltd., USA), equipped with an inductively coupled remote plasma (ICP) source. TEG is the Ga precursor, and a high-purity Ar/N2/H2 (1:3:6, 99.999%) plasma is the nitrogen source; high-purity Ar gas (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas for the precursor. The flow rates of both the carrier gas and the gas used in the plasma were set at 5 sccm, and the radio-frequency (RF) power and plasma frequency were 60 W and 13.56 MHZ, respectively. Cleaned FTO glass substrates were put on the reactor chuck in the PEALD system and pumped down to the system base pressure of ∼0.15 Torr, then the substrate chuck was heated to the growth temperature and left to equilibrate for 20 min. Initially, 5 plasma cycles were run to remove any residual oxygen from the surface. An ALD-GaN cycle consisted of a plasma exposure for 30 s and a purge for 30 s, followed by a TEG dose for 0.5 s and a reaction time of 45 s, and then a purge for 30 s. As indicated, for one ALD-GaN cycle, the exposure times used for TEG and plasma were set at 0.5 s and 30 s, respectively, and pumping gas times of 30 s were required in between for purging the excess TEG and H2O. A growth rate per cycle (GPC) of ∼1.0 Å was determined by in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) for the thin films grown on FTO glass at 280 °C. Compact GaN layers with various thicknesses (10, 30, 50 and 80 PEALD cycles) were used to fabricate planar PSC devices.
Cell fabrication
The fabrication method used for the PSCs was very similar to that reported in our previous work.40 Specifically, an FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite light absorber was deposited on the top of the GaN film by using a perovskite precursor solution prepared by mixing different molar quantities of 1.32 M PbI2, 0.12 M PbBr2, 1.08 M FAI, 0.24 M MAI and 0.12 M MABr solutions in 1 L of solvent with a 4:1 volume ratio of DMF and DMSO. The perovskite films were fabricated by a one-step anti-solvent method, that is, the perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto the GaN layer and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s; 150 μL of chlorobenzene solution was dripped onto the spinning substrate at 15 s during the high speed step. The as-prepared films were heated at 150 °C in a N2 atmosphere for 10 min and then at 100 °C in a vacuum for 40 min. A 200 nm-thick spiro-OMeTAD layer was spin coated onto the top of the perovskite film at a speed of 3000 rpm, then heated at 60 °C for 5 min. The perovskite film fabrication process was carried out in a glovebox. Finally, an Au electrode about 80 nm thickness was deposited by thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 10−7 Torr.
Characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out using a Bruker Dimension Icon instrument. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 SEM. Absorption and transmittance spectra were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu) that covers wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 850 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the GaN films were carried out using a Smartlab GIXRD. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were acquired using a Thermo Escalab 250Xi instrument. Contact angles were measured by using an OCA25, DataPhysics instrument. Hall measurements were performed by using a Phys Tech RH 2030 system at room temperature, under a DC magnetic field of 0.39 T. The valence band (VB) spectra were measured with a monochromatic HeI light source (21.2 eV) and a VG Scienta R4000 analyser. A sample bias of −10 V was applied to observe the secondary electron cut-offs (SEC). The work functions (Φ) were determined from the difference between the photon energy and the binding energy of the secondary cutoff edge. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) from a Zolix SS150A lamp that was calibrated with a standard silicon reference cell, and recorded using a digital source meter (Keithley model 2602). The solar cells were masked with a black aperture to define an active area of 0.1 cm2, and the J–V curves were measured during a forward bias scan going from −0.05 to 1.1 V and a reverse scan from 1.1 to −0.05 V at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were measured using a lab-made setup with the wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 850 nm. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a PL spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS 900) with a xenon lamp as the excitation source. The transient PL spectra were measured with the same instrument together with a pulsed diode laser (EPL-445, 0.8 μJ cm−2) run at a pulse frequency of 1 MHz. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation in the dark in the frequency range from 0.1 to 106 Hz at a bias voltage of 0.8 V.
Conclusions
Low-temperature deposited GaN thin-films have been introduced into planar PSCs as ETLs for the first time. GaN thin-films are deposited on an FTO glass substrate by PEALD at 280 °C. This GaN film is compact and amorphous, and exhibits good transparency. Electron mobilities for the ∼5 nm and ∼19 nm-thick GaN layers on glass substrates are 0.4 and 3.3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. GaN layers with various thicknesses (10–80 PEALD cycles) are employed to fabricate planar PSCs. It is found that, even though a CBM mismatch of 0.59 eV exists at the n-GaN/p-perovskite interface, the 50-PEALD-cycle GaN-based cell can also exhibit 15.18% efficiency with less hysteresis, higher than the GaN-free device with 10.38% efficiency and severe hysteresis behavior. It is found that the GaN layer promotes the electron extraction at the FTO/perovskite interface and decreases charge recombination. Moreover, the GaN-based PSCs also display good long-term stability, demonstrating the feasibility and potential of GaN films as ETLs in planar PSCs. Further work to improve the GaN electronic mobility as well as to pattern GaN surfaces to improve the quality of perovskite films is underway.
