The reaction centre and light-harvesting units are assembled by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and π–π interactions. This article presents various strategies to assemble artificial photosynthetic reaction centres composed of multiple light harvesting units and charge-separation units, which are connected by non-covalent bonding as well as covalent bonding. First light-harvesting units are assembled on alkanethiolate-monolayer-protected metal nanoparticles (MNPs), which are connected with electron acceptors by non-covalent bonding. Light-harvesting units can also be assembled using dendrimers and oligopeptides to combine with electron acceptors by π–π interactions. The cup-shaped nanocarbons generated by the electron-transfer reduction of cup-stacked carbon nanotubes have been functionalized with a number of porphyrins acting as light-harvesting units as well as electron donors. In each case, the photodynamics of assemblies of artificial photosynthetic reaction centres have revealed efficient energy transfer and electron transfer to afford long-lived charge-separated states.Shunichi FukuzumiShunichi Fukuzumi earned his Ph.D. degree in applied chemistry at Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1978.

1. Introduction
The development of artificial photosynthetic systems using solar energy has been highy desired because of the rising concern of environmental pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels.1–3 Solar energy has the potential capacity to fulfill global human energy demands in an environmentally benign manner, if efficient, low-cost systems other than natural systems can be developed for making clean fuels such as hydrogen.1–3 In natural photosynthesis, the photosynthetic reaction centre is associated with a number of light harvesting units in which the harvested light energy is efficiently transferred to the reaction centre where the charge-separation occurs for the primary energy conversion reactions of photosynthesis.4,5 Extensive efforts have so far been devoted to develop artificial photosynthetic reaction centres, which can mimic the energy and electron-transfer processes in photosynthesis.6–13 However, covalent syntheses of large molecular arrays are highly inefficient and costly. Thus, an appropriate combination of covalent synthesis with the use of non-covalent interactions is required in order to construct functionally integrated ordered architectures from functional building blocks at both the molecular and supramolecular level.
In this article, we would like to focus on recent advancement in construction of hierarchial assemblies of artificial photosynthetic reaction centres by combination of covalent syntheses and the use of a variety of non-covalent interactions. First, nanoparticles are used to assemble artificial photosynthetic reaction centres. Dendrimers, oligopeptides and carbon nanotubes are also utilized to assemble electron donors and acceptors. We have also used a new type of nanocarbon material with controlled size and shape and also porphyrin nanotubes to construct artificial photosynthetic reaction centres. With regard to the lifetime of the charge-separated (CS) state of the artificial photosynthetic reaction centres, a long CS lifetime has been achieved by choosing a suitable chromophore and a redox component.

        Assemblies on nanoparticles
2.1. 
          Gold nanoparticles


          Alkanethiolate-monolayer-protected gold nanoclusters (AuNPs) have merited significant interest, because they provide three dimensional (3D) architectures, which are stable in air and soluble in both nonpolar and polar organic solvents, and also capable of facile modification with other functional thiols through exchange reactions or by couplings and nucleophilic substitutions.14–19 Thus, AuNPs can be used as excellent materials to assemble artificial photosynthetic reaction centres (vide infra).
Extensive studies have so far been done to construct artificial photosynthetic reaction centres starting from dyads, triads, tetrads, and even pentads, which are composed of a chromophore, electron donor(s), and/or acceptor(s), mimicking a multistep photoinduced electron-transfer processes in the photosynthetic reaction centre.20–25 The multistep photoinduced electron transfer from the spatially defined chromophore to the terminal electron acceptor through a series of electron mediators has well been established to attain fine-tuned and directed redox gradients along donor–acceptor linked arrays for the formation of the long-lived charge-separated state with high efficiency.20–25 However, such a long-lived CS state has only been attained in compensation for a significant energy loss during the multi-step electron-transfer processes, because each step loses a fraction of the initial excitation energy with the increase in the distance between the positive and negative charges. Instead of using multistep photoinduced electron-transfer processes, one-step photoexcitation of simple electron donor–acceptor dyads has also been reported to afford long-lived CS states.26–35 Among them, the 9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium ion (Mes–Acr+), which has a small reorganization energy (λ) of electron transfer because the overall charge remains the same in the charge-shift electron transfer, is capable of fast photoinduced electron transfer but extremely slow back electron transfer to form a long-lived electron-transfer state and a π-dimer radical cation between the ground state and electron-transfer state of the dyad.34 Such a simple molecular dyad capable of fast charge separation, but extremely slow charge recombination, has obvious advantages with regard to synthetic feasibility.36
Mes–Acr+ was assembled on AuNPs by a condensation reaction.36 A carboxylic acid group is introduced in the N-methyl group in Mes–Acr+ as shown in Fig. 1.37 First, N-(2-methoxyethoxymethyl)-9-acridone (1) was synthesized by the reaction of 9(10H)-acridone with 2-methoxy-ethoxymethyl chloride. Then, 9-mesitylacridine (2) was obtained by the reaction of N-protected acridone with 2,4,6-trimethylphenylmagnesium bromide. 2 was reacted with the triflate of benzylglycolate (3), which was obtained by the reaction of benzyl glycolate with triflic anhydride to yield 10-benzyloxycarbonylmethyl-9-mesitylacridinium triflate (4). Finally the acridinium ester protected by a benzyl group 4 was reacted with hydrogen bromide/acetic acid to yield 10-carboxylmethyl-9-mesitylacridinium hexafluorophosphate (Mes–Acr+–COOH, 43% yield). A reference compound, Mes-Acr+–COOPh, was prepared by condensation of Mes–Acr+–COOH and phenol under similar conditions as described above.
 Fig. 1  Synthetic scheme for Mes–Acr+–COOH. 
Then, the carboxyl-terminated Mes–Acr+–COOH was directly coupled to 4-mercaptophenol-functionalized Au nanoparticles (PhS-AuNPs) in the presence of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIPC)38 and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridinium-4-toluenesulfonate (DPTS) as the standard coupling agents as shown in Fig. 2a.36 The coverage of Mes–Acr+–COOH on the PhS–AuNP was calculated to be 58 molecules per particle (75%).36 The TEM image (Fig. 2b) revealed the mean diameter of the Au to be 1.7 ± 0.3 nm.36

Nanosecond laser flash photolysis measurements of the reference compound (Mes–Acr+–COOH) revealed the transient absortion at 500 nm and a broad absorption band at 1000 nm in the NIR region as shown in Fig. 3a,36 which are the same as observed in the case of Mes–Acr+.39 The absorption band at 500 nm was previously assigned to the triplet excited state of the Acr+ moiety.40,41 However, the absorption band at 500 nm is accompanied by an NIR absorption, which was clearly assigned to the π-dimer radical cation formed between the electron-transfer state (Mes˙+–Acr˙) and the ground state of Mes–Acr+.39 The same NIR absorption band was observed in intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer from mesitylene to the singlet excited state of the 10-methylacridinium ion (1AcrH+*).39 A similar near-IR absorption was also observed for the π-dimer radical cation formed between the electron-transfer state of 2-phenyl-4-(1-naphthyl)quinolinium ion and the ground state.42,43 Thus, upon photoexcitation of Mes–Acr+–COOPh, the electron transfer state (Mes˙+–Acr˙–COOPh) is formed and then the π-dimer radical cation [(Mes˙+–Acr˙–COOPh)(Mes–Acr+–COOPh)] is formed with Mes–Acr+–COOPh (Scheme 1).36 Such π-dimer radical cations have been well known to be formed between π-conjugated compounds and the radical cations, which exhibit NIR absorption.44–46 The decay of the π-dimer radical cation obeyed second-order kinetics, because the intermolecular back electron transfer predominates due to the slow intramolecular back electron transfer as observed in the case of Mes–Acr+.36

 Scheme 1  Photoinduced electron transfer of Mes–Acr+–COOPh and subsequent formation of the π-dimer radical cation. 
It should be pointed out that the energy of the acridinium triplet was previously reported to be 1.96 eV, which is lower than the the electron-transfer state (Mes˙+–Acr˙),40 but this value corresponds to the strong phosphorescence of the corresponding acridine, which remains as an impurity according to the reported synthetic method.40 It is known that the triplet energy of the acridinium ion is significantly higher than that of the corresponding acridine.47–49 It should be emphasized that the electron-transfer state (Mes˙+–Acr˙) has both strong oxidizing ability and reducing ability, which enables it to act as an excellent photocatalyst in various photoinducd redox reactions.50–56

Femtosecond laser flash photolysis measurements of Mes–Acr+–COOPh with excitation at 420 nm revealed formation of the electron-transfer state as shown in Fig. 4a, where no NIR absorption due to the π-dimer radical cation was observed at 500 ps, because no intermolecular reaction occurred at the time scale in Fig. 4a. In sharp contast to this, femtosecond laser excitation at 420 nm of Mes–Acr+–PhS–AuNPs revealed a transient absorption band at 490 nm together with a broad transient absorption band in the NIR region due to the formation of the π-dimer radical cation of the ET state of Mes–Acr+ (Mes˙+–Acr˙–PhS–AuNPs) with the neighboring Mes–Acr+ molecule. From the distance between two Au atoms (4.06 Å) of the crystal lattice of Au, the distance between two neighboring Mes–Acr+ molecules on the Au surface is estimated to be 8.3 Å.36 Such close proximity of Mes–Acr+ molecules on the AuNPs makes it possible to form the π-dimer radical cation via an intramolecular π–π interaction upon photoinduced electron transfer. The π-dimer radical cation decays with lifetime of 1.9 ps by rapid electron transfer from the benzenethiol linker to the π-dimer radical cation (Mes˙+–Mes) moiety and back electron transfer to the ground state with the lifetime of 380 ps as shown in the energy diagram in Fig. 5.36

 Fig. 5  Energy diagram of photoinduced electron transfer in Mes–Acr+–PhS–AuNPs. 
Thus, AuNPs provide an excellent scaffold to assemble Mes–Acr+ molecules and the photoexcitation resulted in rapid formation of the electron-transfer state (Mes˙+–Acr˙), accompanied by formation of the π-dimer radical cation with the neighbouring Mes–Acr+ on AuNPs, whereas such π-dimer radical cation formation occurs at a much slower time scale for the reference compound (Mes–Acr+–COOPh) by the intermolecular reaction between Mes˙+–Acr˙–COOPh and Mes–Acr+–COOPh.

nanoparticles

Mes–Acr+–COOH and the reference compound (Acr+–COOH) without the donor moiety (Fig. 6) can also be assembled on TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) by immersing warmed TiO2NPs (80–100 °C) in an acetonitrile mixture containing Mes–Acr+–COOH and Acr+–COOH for 12 h, respectively.57 After adsorbing Mes–Acr+–COOH and Acr+–COOH, TiO2NPs were filtered, and subsequent washing with acetonitrile and drying gave Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2NPs and Acr+–COO–TiO2NPs (Fig. 6).57 The dye molecule was completely desorbed from the TiO2NPs into solution by immersing TiO2NPs modified with the dye moieties in methanol overnight. The amounts of Mes–Acr+–COOH and Acr+–COOH adsorbed on TiO2NPs relative to the total weight were determined as 1.5 × 10−5 and 1.5 × 10−5 mol g−1, respectively.57

Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2NPs were electrophoretically deposited onto the OTE/SnO2 electrode in suspended solution to prepare the OTE/SnO2/(Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2)nelectrode.57 A mixed cluster suspension of Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2 and C60 was also prepared in the total concentration range from 0.025 to 0.13 mM (molecular ratio of Mes–Acr+:C60 = 1:5) in acetonitrile/toluene (3/1, v/v).57 The clusters suspended in acetonitrile/toluene mixed solvent were assembled electrophoretically as thin films on a conducting glass electrode surface to obtain films of (Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2 + C60)n on nanostructured SnO2 films cast on an optically conducting glass electrode, OTE/SnO2/(Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2 + C60)n.57 A broader wavelength absorption in the visible region was observed in the OTE/SnO2/(Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2 + C60)n film relative to those in the OTE/SnO2/(Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2)n and OTE/SnO2/(C60)n films, suggesting the charge-transfer (CT) interaction between Mes–Acr+ moiety and C60.57 The scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the OTE/SnO2/(Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2 + C60)n film in Fig. 7 exhibits closely packed clusters of about 20–100 nm size with a networked structure due to a supramolecular interaction between Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2 and C60 in the TiO2 nanoparticle matrix.57 Thus, TiO2 nanoparticles play an important role in the cluster formation on the films.

Photocurrent measurements of the OTE/SnO2/(Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2 + C60)nelectrode as a photoanode in acetonitrile containing NaI (0.5 M) and I2 (0.01 M) under the bias of 0.2 V vs.SCE revealed a significant increase in the photocurrent as compared with those without TiO2.57 The incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) value of 37% was obtained for the OTE/SnO2/(Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2 + C60)nelectrode, whereas the maximum IPCE value of the OTE/SnO2/(Acr+–COO–TiO2 + C60)nelectrode without the electron donor moiety (Mes) was significantly smaller (14%).57 This indicates that photoinduced electron transfer from the donor moiety (Mes) to the acceptor moiety (Acr+) occurs, followed by electron transfer from the resulting acridinyl radical moiety (Acr˙) to C60 in the supramolecular complex, leading to enhancement of the photocurrent generation.
In the case of the OTE/SnO2/(Mes–Acr+–COO–TiO2 + C60)nelectrode, the long lifetime of the electron-transfer state (Acr˙–Mes˙+) ensures efficient electron-transfer from Acr˙ to C60 (C60/C60˙− = −0.2 V vs.NHE)58 to produce the C60 radical anion. The formation of C60˙− was confirmed by the nanosecond laser flash photolysis measurements of a deoxygenated toluene–acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) solution of 9-mesityl-10-methyl-acridinium ion without carboxylic acid (Mes–Acr+)34 in the presence of C60, which clearly exhibits a broad absorption band at 1050 nm due to C60˙−.59,60 The reduced C60 clusters inject electrons into the conduction band of SnO2, whereas the oxidized mesityl moiety (Mes˙+) undergoes the electron-transfer reduction with iodide ion in the electrolyte.57

          Platinum nanoparticles

Among various metal nanoparticles, Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) have been known to be the most reactive as hydrogen evolution catalysts.61 There have been extensive studies on hydrogen evolution using metal complexes as photosensitizers combined with electron mediators and hydrogen-evolution catalysts.62–67 In order to improve the catalytic efficiency of hydrogen evolution, an electron mediator (methyl viologen) was linked to PtNPs.68 The methyl viologen-modified platinum clusters (MVA2+–PtNPs) were prepared by applying the same method as the preparation of alkanethiolate-modified AuNPs,69 as shown in Fig. 8a, where the reduction of H2PtCl4 with NaBH4 was performed in water containing MVA2+ (MVA2+/H2PtCl4 = 1/1). The mean diameter of the platinum core (2RCORE) of MVA2+–PtNPs determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM in Fig. 8b) is 1.9 nm (Fig. 8c), which is similar to the diameter reported for the water-soluble PtNPs.70 The number of MVA2+ on the Pt surface is determined to be 67 from the elemental analysis of MVA2+–PtNPs.68
 Fig. 8  (a) Preparation of MVA2+–PtNPs. (b) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and (c) core size histograms of MVA2+–PtNPs. 

          MVA2+ and MVA2+–PtNPs were reduced by Na2S2O4 in aqueous solution at pH 7.0. The formation of a π-dimer radical cation between MVA˙+ and MVA on PtNPs is recognized in the UV-vis spectrum of MVA˙+–PtNPs in comparision with that of MVA˙+ in Fig. 9. The absorption band of MVA˙+–PtNPs is blue-shifted from 605 nm of MVA˙+ to 525 nm, accompanied by the appearance of the NIR absorption (Fig. 9b) as observed in the case of the formation of the π-dimer radical cation between Mes˙+–Acr˙ and Mes–Acr+ in Fig. 3 and 4. This results from closely packed MVA molecules on the Pt surface.68 The formation of the π-dimer radical cation between MVA˙+ and MVA2+ at close proximity on PtNPs resulted in the positive shift in the first one-electron reduction potential of MVA2+–PtNPs from −0.67 V vs.SCE of MVA2+ to −0.50 V vs. SCE because of the stabilization by the π-bond formed between MVA˙+ and MVA˙+.
 Fig. 9  
UV-vis spectra of (a) MVA2+–PtNPs, (b) MVA˙+–PtNPs, (c) MVA2+ and (d) MVA˙+ in aqueous solution at pH 7.0. 
The hydrogen-evolution efficiency was compared using the photocatalytic systems composed of NADH, Mes–Acr+ and MVA2+–PtNPs at pH 4.5 vs.NADH, Mes–Acr+ and a mixture of the same amounts of MVA2+ and PtNPs under the same experimental conditions.68 The amount of hydrogen evolution of the NADH/Mes–Acr+/MVA2+–PtNPs system increases with the photoirradiation time linearly and the rate was estimated to be 2.4 μmol h−1, which is ten times faster than the rate of the NADH/Mes–Acr+/MVA2+/PtNPs system.68 The more efficient hydrogen evolution in the NADH/Mes–Acr+/MVA2+–PtNPs system certainly results from the assembly effect of MV2+ on PtNPs, which facilitates electron transfer from MVA˙+ to PtNPs, as compared with intermolecular electron transfer from MVA˙+ to PtNPs.

Scheme 2 summarizes the mechanism of hydrogen evolution in the NADH/Mes–Acr+/MVA2+–PtNPs system.68 The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution starts by photoexcitation of Mes–Acr+, which results in the formation of the electron-transfer state (Acr˙–Mes˙+). This is followed by the rapid electron-transfer oxidation of NADH and/or the electron-transfer reduction of MVA2+ in MVA2+–PtNPs. Both processes are thermodynamically feasible, because the one-electron oxidation potential of NADH (Eox = 0.76 V vs.SCE)71,72 is less positive than the one-electron reduction potential of the Mes˙+ moiety of Mes˙+–Acr and the one-electron oxidation potential of the Acr˙ moiety in water (Eox = −0.57 V vs.SCE) is more negative than the one-electron reduction potential of the MVA2+ moiety in MVA2+–PtNPs (E0red = −0.50 V). In contrast, electron transfer from Acr˙–Mes˙+ (Eox = −0.57 V vs.SCE) to MV2+ (Ered = −0.67 V) is energetically unfavorable, because the Eox value of Mes˙+–Acr˙ is more positive than the E0red value of MV2+. In this case, MV2+ is reduced by NAD˙, which is produced via deprotonation of NADH˙+, because the electron transfer from NAD˙ (Eox = −1.1 V vs.SCE)71,72 to MV2+ (Ered = −0.67 V) is highly exergonic. Thus, MVA2+–PtNPs are more reactive in electron transfer from Mes˙+–Acr˙ and also electron transfer to PtNPs, leading to the 10 times faster H2 evolution.

          Porphyrin assembled metal nanoparticles
In order to expand the potential applications of metal nanoparticles (MNPs), systematic studies on chromophore-modified MNPs are required. Brust et al. developed a facile synthetic method in which a quaternary ammonium salt is used to assist the transfer of gold ion [(AuCl4)−] and reducing agent (BH4−) from aqueous phase to organic phase to yield air-stable functionalized MNPs with a mono dispersity.14 This method was utilized to prepare porphyrin-modified metal nanoclusters with different metal and different size of gold core (H2PC11AuNPs, H2PC11AuNPs, H2PC11AuNPs, H2PC11PdNPs, H2PC11PtNPs, H2PC11Au/AgNPs), as shown in Fig. 10.73
 Fig. 10  Schematic structures of porphyrin-modified gold nanoclusters H2PCnAuNPs. 
The different size of metal core was obtained by changing the concentraion of porphyrin alkanethiol (Por-SH) as shown in the TEM images of H2PC11AuNPs (Fig. 11).73 Based on the elemental analysis, there are 25, 57 and 136 porphyrin alkanethiolate chains on the gold surface for H2PC11AuNPs with the mean diameter 2RCORE = 1.4 nm, 2.1 and 2.9 nm, respectively.19 The coverage ratios of porphyrin alkanethiolate chains of H2PC11AuNPs with 2RCORE = 1.4 nm, 2.1 and 2.9 nm to surface Au atoms (γ) were determined to be 46%, 40% and 46%, respectively. These γ values are remarkably large compared with the coverage ratio (γ = 6.5%) of 2D porphyrin SAM H2PC11–Au(111).74 Such enhanced packing of the large porphyrins is made possible by the highly curved outermost surface of the AuNPs, where the spacer is splayed outward from the gold core to relieve steric crowding significantly. Similar results were obtained for H2PC11Au/AgNPs, H2PC11PdNPs and H2PC11PtNPs.73
 Fig. 11  
            Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of H2PC11AuNPs with different sizes; (a) 2RCORE = 1.4 nm with a standard deviation (σ = 0.4 nm), (b) 2RCORE = 2.1 nm with σ = 0.3 nm and (c) 2RCORE = 2.9 nm with σ = 0.7 nm. The dark spots correspond to the metal core. 
Although there are many porphyrins attached on MNPs, there is no significant interaction between porphyrin molecules on MNPs, because the λmax values of the Soret band of H2PC11MNPs in benzene, THF and CHCl3 are nearly identical to that of Por-ref in the three solvents. The surface plasmon absorption due to the gold,75palladium,76platinum70b and alloy gold–silver77 nanoparticles is much weaker than that of the porphyrin moiety.
Fluorescence lifetimes of H2PC11AuNPs with 2RCORE = 1.4 nm, 2.1 and 2.9 nm were determined to be 0.17 ns (97%), 0.10 ns (96%), 0.12 ns (73%), respectively.73 The similar quenching efficiency reveals that the difference in metal size (1.4 nm–2.9 nm) has no appreciable impact on the quenching of the porphyrin excited singlet state by the metal surfaces. It should be noted that the fluorescence lifetime of H2PC11Au/AgNPs [0.22 (81%) and 7.0 ns (19%) in CHCl3 (λobs = 720 nm)] is significantly longer than those of monometal H2PC11AuNPs.73 This suggests that interaction between the surface of the gold-silver alloy and the porphyrin excited singlet state is attenuated considerably relative to the mono-metal systems. Thus, porphyrin-modified metal alloy nanoclusters are highly promising as new types of light-harvesting materials, photocatalysts, and chemical and biochemical sensors.78
These porphyrin-modified MNPs form π-complexes with fullerene molecules and they were clusterized in an acetonitrile/toluene mixed solvent.79 Then, the highly colored composite clusters were assembled as a three-dimensional array onto nanostructured SnO2 films to afford the OTE/SnO2/(H2PCnMNPs + C60)melectrode (n is the number of alkyl chains) using an electrophoretic deposition method.79 The film of the composite cluster with gold nanoparticle exhibits an incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) as high as 54% and broad photocurrent action spectra (up to 1000 nm).79 The energy conversion efficiency of this system reaches 1.5%, and this value is 45 times higher than that of the reference system.79 Such remarkable enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance as well as broader photoresponse in the visible and infrared relative to the reference systems demonstrates that the porphyrin-AuNPs and fullerene composites provide promising perspective for the development of efficient organic solar cells.

        Dendrimer supramolecular complexes
Because the morphology and the photochemical function of porphyrin dendrimers are similar to those of the light-harvesting units in photosynthesis, porphyrin dendrimers have attracted considerable interest as a unique way to assemble porphyrins, harvesting solar light in artificial photosynthesis.80–83Porphyrin dendrimers can also be used to combine light-harvesting units with reaction centre units. For example, a zinc porphyrin dendrimer [D(ZnP)16]84 is combined with an electron acceptor, N-methyl-2-(4′-pyridyl)-3,4-fulleropyrrolidine (PyC60), which has a pyridine binding site,85 to form a supramolecular complex as shown in Fig. 12.86 The porphyrin dendrimers were synthesized by coupling of the porphyrin activated ester [5-amino-2-{5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)}]-5-oxopentanoic acid 2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl ester with the appropriate first, second, or third generation polypropylenimine dendrimer.83
 Fig. 12  A supramolecular complex between a zinc porphyrin dendrimer [D(ZnP)16] and PyC60. 
Photoexcitation of the Soret band of D(ZnP)16 at 438 nm in PhCN results in fluorescence at λmax = 609 and 645 nm.11b The fluorescence was efficiently quenched by addition of PyC60 to a PhCN solution of D(ZnP)16.11b The fluorescence intensity decreases to reach a constant value with increasing concentration of PyC60. The formation constant (K) of 1:1 ZnP monomer unit–PyC60 complex was determined from the fluorescence quenching to be 5.0 × 104 M−1, which is significantly larger than the K value (1.6 × 104 M−1) determined from the absorption spectral change.11b The larger K value determined from the fluorescence quenching results from the excited energy migration between the porphyrin units, because the fluorescence of the unbounded ZnP moiety is quenched by PyC60 bound to a different ZnP moiety via the energy transfer. In contrast to the case of D(ZnP)16, a ZnP monomer cannot form the supramolecular complex with PyC60 in a coordinating PhCN solution, when no fluorescence quenching occurred by PyC60.11b This indicates clearly that the dendrimer affects the binding and excited energy migration.
The occurrence of photoinduced charge separation (CS) in the supramolecular complex was confirmed by nanosecond laser flash photolysis measurements of the D(ZnP)16–PyC60 complex in PhCN as shown in Fig. 13.11b The absorption band due to PyC60˙− is clearly observed at 1000 nm together with that due to ZnP˙+ at 630 nm after laser excitation at 561 nm where only the ZnP moiety is excited (Fig. 13a).11b This indicates that the CS state of the supramolecular complex is formed via photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the ZnP moiety to the PyC60 moiety. The quantum yield (Φ) of the CS state of the D(ZnP)16–PyC60 complex is determined to be 25%.11b The decay of the absorption band at 1000 nm due to PyC60˙− obeyed clean first-order kinetics with the same slope irrespective of different laser power intensities (Fig. 13b).11b Because intermolecular back electron transfer would obey second-order kinetics, the first-order decay of the CS state results from back electron transfer in the supramolecular complex. The lifetime of the CS state is determined as 0.25 ms at 298 K.11b

Organic photovoltaic cells were constructed using clusters of supramolecular complexes of porphyrin dendrimers with fullerene exhibiting remarkable enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance as well as broader photoresponse in the visible and near-infrared regions.84,86 This clearly indicates that the π–π interaction between porphyrins and fullerenes in the supramolecular clusters plays an important role in improving the light energy conversion efficiency.

        Porphyrin
oligopeptide supramolecular complexes
In contrast to porphyrin dendrimers (Fig. 12) in which the geometries of porphyrins are rather fixed, porphyrin oligopeptides provide more flexible structures to assemble porphyrins.87,88 Thus, zinc porphyrinic oligopeptides with various numbers of porphyrin units [P(ZnP)n; n = 2, 4, 8]87–89 are used as light-harvesting multiporphyrin units, which are bound to electron acceptors of fulleropyrrolidine bearing a pyridine (PyC60)85,90 or imidazole coordinating ligand (ImC60)91 as shown in Fig. 14.92
 Fig. 14  Supramolecular complex composed of the porphyrin–peptide octamer [P(ZnP)8, Ar = 3,5-(tert-Bu)2C6H3] and PyC60 or ImC60. 
The fluorescence of P(ZnP)8 is strongly quenched by the intrasupramolecular electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the ZnP moiety (1ZnP*) in P(ZnP)8 to the bound PyC60.92 The formation constant (K) of the supramolecular complex of P(ZnP)8 with PyC60 was determined from the fluorescence quenching to be 1.5 × 105 M−1, which is significantly larger than the K value (2.4 × 104 M−1) determined from the absorption spectral change.92 As in the case of the supramolecular complex of zinc porphyrin dendrimers with PyC60 (vide supra), the larger K value determined from the fluorescence quenching results from the excited energy migration between the porphyrin units in P(ZnP)8. It should be noted that the K value determined from the fluorescence quenching of P(ZnP)8 by PyC60 (1.5 × 105 M−1) is significantly larger than the corresponding value of D(ZnP)16 (5.0 × 104 M−1) but that the K values determined from the absorption spectral change are similar between P(ZnP)8 and D(ZnP)16.92 This suggests that the flexible structure of the oligopeptide chain enables more efficient energy migration as compared with the rigid structure of the dendrimer. The flexibility of the oligopeptide chain was clearly observed as the disappearance of the Cotton effect originating from the porphyrin Soret band at 428 nm in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of P(ZnP)16 by the formation of the supramolecular complex with C60, which indicates the α-helix structure was changed to accommodate C60 between the porphyrin rings by π–π interaction.93
As in the case of the D(ZnP)16–PyC60 supramolecular complex in Fig. 13a, the occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer in the supramolecular complex in PhCN was confirmed by nanosecond laser flash photolysis measurements of the supramolecular complex of P(ZnP)8 with PyC60, which revealed the formation of the CS state, exhibiting the transient absorption band due to PyC60˙− at 1000 nm together with that due to ZnP˙+ at 630 nm.92 The CS state decayed obeyed clean first-order kinetics and the first-order plots at different initial CS concentrations afforded linear correlations with the same slope. If there is any contribution of intermolecular back electron transfer from unbound PyC60˙− to ZnP˙+, the second-order kinetics would be involved for the decay time profile. Thus, the decay of the CS state results from back electron transfer in the supramolecular complex rather than intermolecular back electron transfer from PyC60˙− to ZnP˙+.92
The CS lifetimes of the supramolecular complexes of other porphyrins [P(ZnP)n: n = 2, 4] and fullerene derivative (ImC60) become longer with increasing generation of porphyrinic oligopeptides.92 This may also result from efficient hole migration between the porphyrin units following photoinduced electron transfer in the supramolecular complex. The longest CS lifetime was attained as 0.84 ms at 298 K for the P(ZnP)8–ImC60 supramolecular complex.92 Such a long-lived CS state was also confirmed by the EPR measurements under photoirradiation of the supramolecular complexes of P(ZnP)8 with PyC60 and ImC60 in frozen PhCN at 173 K. Under photoirradiation, the isotropic EPR signals corresponding to the zinc porphyrin radical cation and fullerene radical anion were observed at g = 2.002 and 2.000, respectively.92
The clusters of supramolecular complexes of porphyrin-peptide oligomers with fullerenes can be assembled on nanostructured SnO2 electrodes by an electrophoretic deposition method to construct purely organic supramolecular solar cells.93 There were significant effects of the number of porphyrins in a poly-peptide unit [P(H2P)n and P(ZnP)n (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)] and of the types of porphyrins (H2Pvs.ZnP) and fullerenes (C60vs. C60 derivatives) on the structures, spectroscopic, and photoelectrochemical properties of the porphyrin–C60 composite electrodes.93 The best performance was obtained for the (P(H2P)16 + C60)m system exhibiting a fill factor (FF) of 0.47, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 320 mV, a short circuit current density (Isc) of 0.36 mA cm−2, and the overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.6% at input power (Win) of 3.4 mW cm−2, which is 40 times higher than the value (0.043%) of the porphyrin monomer (P(H2P)1 + C60)m modified electrode.93b The broad photocurrent action spectra (with photoresponse extending up to 1000 nm) show the ability of these composites to harvest photons in the visible and NIR. Thus, a supramolecular approach between porphyrins and fullerenes with flexible polypeptide structures seems to be promising, making it possible to further improve the light energy conversion effciency by using a much larger number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit.

        Porphyrin
assembly on size-controlled cup-shaped nanocarbons
In addition to fullerenes described above, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)94 also exhibit excellent chemical and physical properties that have been revealed by various potential applications.95–99 Thus, extensive efforts have so far been devoted to assemble electron donor and acceptor molecules on SWNTs.7,100–106 However, the fine-control of size (i.e., length) of SWNTs remains a formidable challenge, because SWNTs have seamless cylinder structures made up of a hexagonal carbon network, which leads to the difficulty of solubilisation/functionalization without treatment of strong acid or vigorous sonication.107,108 On the other hand, the cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs) that consist of cup-shaped nanocarbon units, which stack via van der Waals attractions, have merited special attention from the viewpoint of conventional carbon nanotube alternatives.109–112 The tube-tube van der Waals energy between cup-shaped nanocarbons has been counterbalanced by the thermal or photoinduced electron transfer multi-electron reduction due to electrostatic repulsion, resulting in highly dispersible cup-shaped nanocarbons with size homogeneity.113,114
The cup-shaped nanocarbons (CNC) with controlled size have been functionalized with a large number of porphyrin molecules.115 The general procedure for the synthesis of the porphyrin-functionalized cup-shaped nanocarbons [CNC–(H2P)n] is shown in Fig. 15a.115 The cup-shaped nanocarbons are first functionalized with aniline as the precursor for the further functionalization with porphyrins. The aniline-functionalized nanocarbons react with the porphyrin derivatives to construct the nanohybrids.
 Fig. 15  (a) Synthetic procedure of CNC–(H2P)n. (b) TEM image of CNC–(H2P)n. 
The structure of the cup-shaped nanocarbons of the CNC–(H2P)n nanohybrids is shown by the TEM in Fig. 15b, which reveals cup-shaped nanocarbons with a hollow core along the length of the nanocup with well-controlled diameter (ca. 50 nm) and size (ca. 100 nm).114 The weight % of porphyrins attached to the cup-shaped nanocarbons was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analysis to be ca. 20%.114 This corresponds to one functional group per 640 carbon atoms of the nanocup framework for the CNC–(H2P)n nanohybrid. Thus, the π-framework of the CNC is not destroyed despite attachment of a large number of porphyrin molecules on the CNC.
Spectroscopic evidence for the covalent functionalization of the CNC–(H2P)n nanohybrid was obtained by an intensity increase of the Raman signal at 1353 cm−1 (D band) in the functionalized CNC as compared with the pristine CSCNTs,115 because the D band has been used for monitoring the process of functionalization which transforms sp2 to sp3 sites.116 The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the CNC–(H2P)n nanohybrid agreed with that of the superposition of the reference porphyrin [tetrakis(N-octadecyl-4-aminocarboxyphenyl)porphyrin] (ref-H2P) and cup-shaped nanocarbons, indicating that there is no significant interaction between attached porphyrins and CSCNTs in the ground states.115
The fluorescence lifetime of CNC–(H2P)n was determined to be 3.0 ± 0.1 ns, which is much shorter than that of ref-H2P (14.1 ± 0.1 ns).115 The fluorescence emission at 650 nm was also quenched in CNC–(H2P)n.115 The short fluorescence lifetime of CNC–(H2P)n and an efficient fluorescence quenching of porphyrins in CNC–(H2P)n as compared to the ref-H2P may result from the photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of H2P (1H2P*) to CNC in CNC–(H2P)n. The occurrence of the photoinduced electron transfer to afford the charge-separated (CS) state of CNC–(H2P)n was confirmed by nanosecond laser flash photolysis measurements in Fig. 16, where the absorption bands in the visible and NIR region are attributed to H2P˙+, which are clearly different from the triplet–triplet absorption of ref-H2P.115 The formation of the CS state was also confirmed by EPR measurements under photoirradiation of CNC–(H2P)n in frozen DMF at 153 K. The observed isotropic EPR signal at g = 2.0044 agrees with that of ref-H2P˙+ produced by the one-electron oxidation with [Ru(bpy)3]3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) in deaerated CHCl3.115 The EPR signal corresponding to the reduced carbon-based nanomaterials was too broad to be detected probably due to delocalization of electrons in CNC.115
 Fig. 16  (a) Transient absorption spectra of (a) CNC–(H2P)n taken at 20 μs and 1.8 ms after laser excitation at 426 nm and (b) ref-H2P in deaerated DMF at 298 K taken at 100 μs and 1.6 ms after laser excitation at 426 nm. (c) Decay time profiles and (d) first-order plots at 470 nm with different laser powers (5, 3, 2, and 1 mJ/pulse). 
The CS state of CNC–(H2P)n detected in Fig. 16a decays obeying clean first-order kinetics: the first-order plots at different initial CS concentrations afford linear correlations with the same slope (Fig. 16b).115 Thus, the decay of the CS state results from back electron transfer in the nanohybrid rather than intermolecular back electron transfer from CNC˙− to H2P˙+. The CS lifetime was determined from the first-order plots in Fig. 16b to be 0.64 ± 0.01 ms, which is the longest lifetime ever reported for electron donor-attached nanocarbon materials.115 Such a long CS lifetime may be ascribed to the efficient electron migration in the cup-shaped nanocarbons following the charge separation.
The reduction potential (Ered) of the CNC moiety was estimated by redox titration to be −0.15 V vs. SCE,115 which is about the same as the reported value of the one-electron reduction potential of CNT.117 In the presence of TCNQ (Ered = 0.19 V vs. SCE), which acts as an electron acceptor, photoinduced electron transfer from H2P to CNC in CNC–(H2P)n was followed by subsequent electron transfer from CNC˙− of the CS state to TCNQ to produce TCNQ˙− (λmax = 846 nm), whereas the absorption bands due to H2P˙+ at 480 nm and the near-infrared region remain the same as shown in Fig. 17.115 This serves as crucial testimony for the existence of the photolytically generated CNC˙− (i.e., CNC˙−−(H2P)n˙+).

(b) Transient absorption spectrum recorded at 1 μs after 426 nm laser excitation of a deaerated DMF solution of CNC–(H2P)n in the presence of TCNQ (1.0 × 10−6 M). Inset: Absorption-time profile recorded at 830 nm. 

Porphyrin-functionalized cup-shaped nanocarbons CNC–(H2P)n have also been assembled onto nanostructured SnO2 films using an electrophoretic deposition method to examine the photoelectrochemical properties.118 The resulting nanohybrid film afforded the drastic enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance as well as the broader photoresponse in the visible region as compared with the reference CNC system without porphyrins.119 The enhancement of photocurrent generation is caused by the efficient electron injection from the long-lived charge-separated state of CNC–(H2P)n upon photoexcitation (vide supra).
6. Conclusions
In contrast to natural photosynthesis, where only a single reaction centre is combined with light-harvesting units, multiple reaction centres can be combined with light-harvesting units by utilizing metal nanoparticles, dendrimers, oligopeptides and nanocarbon materials, in which charge-separation molecules are assembled in artificial systems as described above. The construction of composites of multiple photosynthetic reaction centres and light-harvesting units described in this article will hopefully open a new strategy to develop efficient light-to-energy conversion systems including organic solar cells and artificial photosynthesis for production of solar fuels.
