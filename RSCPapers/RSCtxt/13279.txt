    , Accepted 19th February 2020First published on 11th March 2020AbstractAlkyl chain engineering has been widely applied in the preparation of high-performance organic solar energy conversion materials. In this study, a series of high-performance acceptor–donor–acceptor–donor–acceptor non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with core units functionalized with different alkyl chains (1-dodecyl, 2-ethylhexyl, 2-butyloctyl, and 2-hexyldecyl) and chlorinated end groups were designed and synthesized. All these molecules exhibited strong and broad absorption from 600 nm to 950 nm, low band gaps (1.34–1.39 eV), and high electron mobility. Furthermore, the single crystal of BTIC-BO-4Cl was successfully grown. The analysis of the single crystal revealed that this molecule formed a three-dimensional (3D) interpenetrating network due to multiple strong and short S⋯O, Cl⋯S, and Cl⋯π interactions among the adjacent BTIC-BO-4Cl molecules. This 3D interpenetrating network would definitely be beneficial for the transport of charge carriers and thus increase the electron mobility of the corresponding acceptor. When blended with the donor polymer PBDB-TF, it was found that the chlorinated non-fullerene acceptor with 2-butyloctyl-substituted side chains at the N positions displayed the highest device performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.43% among those acceptors. Our study demonstrates that the use of branched alkyl chains on nitrogen atoms is beneficial for the high efficiency of the core unit compared to those with linear chains, and the size of branched alkyl chains also has great effects on the resultant material and the corresponding device performance.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention from industries and the academic community due to its outstanding advantages of low cost, lightweight, large area and flexiblity.1–3 In the past, fullerene and its derivatives were the most widely used acceptors in OSCs.4–8 However, due to their inevitable shortcomings (poor visible absorption, limited energy tunability, and morphological instability), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of fullerene-based OSCs could only reach 11%, which is much lower than those of other photovoltaic technologies. In contrast, nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have made great progress since 2015, yielding impressive PCEs over 16% in a single-junction device.9–11 Compared with fullerene acceptors, they possess many significant advantages, such as strong absorption in the near-infrared region, simple synthesis process, ease of purification, and adjustable energy levels,12–16 which motivated the researchers in the field to make considerable efforts on NFAs, especially the fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Basically, the design strategies of FREAs focus on three aspects, namely the central fused-ring core, side-chain engineering, and the electron-withdrawing end groups,17–20 to tune the absorption wavelength, ionization energy and electron affinity.
It is known that the side chains of the NFA molecules play an important role in their processing capability and device fabrication. It was found that differences in the alkyl chains showed considerable effects on the photovoltaic properties of NFAs due to the variations in molecular packing and film morphology. For example, Li's group developed a low band gap acceptor (m-ITIC) by engineering the side-chain isomerism of the alkyl-phenyl substituent of ITIC.21 Higher film absorption coefficient, larger crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility were achieved, and consequently boosted the fill factor (FF) and PCE. Wang and coworkers designed four propeller-shaped TPH-based NFAs with different lengths of branched alkyl side chains at the imide positions.22 TPH-7, which had the longest alkyl chain, showed the best photovoltaic property due to its stronger crystallinity and higher charge transport. In addition, the effects of the side chains of the terminal groups23 and the side chains of the π-bridges24 on NFA performance were also investigated in-depth from the literature. Recently, a high-performance NFA named Y6 was reported with an outstanding PCE of 15.7%.25 In the molecular structure of Y6, two types of alkyl chains were existent (two branched alkyl chains attached to the N atom, and two linear alkyl groups connected to the thiophene unit) and provided enough processing capability and good morphology for excellent solar conversion. Lately, the PCE of the Y6 family molecule with branched alkyl chains in the 3rd-position could be further improved to over 16% with a ternary device strategy.26 Considering that the subtle change in the alkyl chains could greatly affect the photovoltaic properties of this high-performance NFAs, it is very important to investigate the effect of different types and sizes of alkyl chains on the properties of this family of molecules, especially by understanding their real molecular packing and arrangement.
Therefore, in this work, four NFAs – one with a long linear alkyl chain and three with branched alkyl chains – named BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl (Chart 1), were employed to study the significance of the chlorine-substituted acceptors. In the past three years, our group has developed a series of chlorinated polymer donors27–29 and acceptors30,31 to explore the role of chlorination in the optimization of solar conversion. These chlorinated high-performance acceptor–donor–acceptor–donor–acceptor (ADADA) NFAs32,33 would help in revealing the critical issues in pumping the device performance using such substitutions. The influences of the different alkyl chains in these chlorinated acceptors on the OSC performance were systematically investigated in parallel. The results showed that these four acceptors possessed strong absorption in the 600–950 nm region, low band gaps (1.34–1.39 eV), and high electron mobility. The devices based on the blends of these acceptors and the polymer donor PBDB-TF exhibited various PCEs in the range of 9.38% to 16.43%. The optimal PCE was achieved with BTIC-BO-4Cl that contains 2-butyloctyl branched side chains, which showed good solubility and processing capability in chlorobenzene. Based on the dramatic enhancement of PCEs using this system, it could be inferred that alkyl side chain engineering has a remarkable influence in tuning the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance of NFAs. With appropriate side chains, we can eventually develop better solar conversion materials with high solar conversion and good processing capability for real commercial applications.

Results
Synthesis and characterization

Chart 1 shows the chemical structures of the four NFAs and the polymer donor (PBDB-TF) used in this study. PBDB-TF:Y6 and PBDB-TF:chlorinated Y6 (named as BTIC-EH-4Cl) could easily achieve outstanding PCEs over 15% in OSCs, according to previously reported results.11,30 However, these two blends, especially the BTIC-EH-4Cl blend, showed limited solubility in some common solvents, such as chloroform (CF). Herein, three longer alkyl side chains, namely the branched 2-butyloctyl and 2-hexyldecyl chains, and the linear 1-dodecyl group, were introduced to solve this problem. This way, we successfully demonstrated that a branched alkyl chain of suitable size was critical and important for their processing capability and photovoltaic performance.
As shown in Scheme 1, the Stille coupling of tributyl (6-undecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-yl)stannane and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole afforded compound 1 with a high yield (84.8%). Compound 2 was synthesized by the double reductive Cadogan ring-closing reaction of compound 1 with triphenylphosphine (PPh3) in the o-dichlorobenzene solvent.34 Compounds 3a–3d were obtained by the alkylation procedure with different brominated alkyl chains using NaOH as the base. The dialdehyde compounds 4a–4d were prepared as orange-red solids by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction using POCl3 and DMF with 3a–3d. The desired target molecules BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl were finally synthesized with yields in the 53–80% range by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 4a–4d with IC-2Cl. It should be noted that here we used another stable and efficient method to synthesize the key intermediate 2 using PPh3 as the organophosphorus compound. All intermediates were characterized by 1H NMR, and the final compounds were further confirmed by high-resolution mass measurements.

The thermal stability of these four acceptors was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Fig. S1†). According to the TGA curves, all the four compounds showed good thermal stability with 5% weight loss with the decomposition temperatures (Td) varying from 277 to 305.6 °C under nitrogen flow, which was sufficient to meet the requirement of device fabrication. In the range of 50–250 °C, their DSC measurements did not show obvious crystallization and melting peaks, suggesting strong intermolecular interactions after the introduction of chlorine atoms. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the four acceptors were measured in chloroform (CF) solutions (10−5 mol L−1) and the film state. As shown in Fig. 1a, the four acceptors had similar strong and broad absorption spectra in the range of 600–850 nm, and all their absorption peaks were located at 746 nm since the change in the alkyl chains did not affect the conjugated aromatic backbone. However, the measured absorption coefficients at the maximum absorption peaks of these four molecules were different (1.55 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 for BTIC-C12-4Cl, 1.68 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 for BTIC-EH-4Cl, 2.22 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 for BTIC-BO-4Cl, and 1.43 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 for BTIC-HD-4Cl), indicating that the alkyl side chain had a significant influence on the ground state electronic structure.25 The longer branched side chains led to larger absorption extinction coefficients, likely due to their enhanced intermolecular packing property. In the thin-film state (Fig. 1b), all the acceptors showed large red-shifts of about 50 nm (BTIC-C12-4Cl) and 86 nm (BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl) compared to their corresponding absorption peaks in solution. Thin films of all of the branched alkyl-substituted molecules showed absorption peaks at nearly the same wavelength of 832 nm, which was much larger than that of the linear alkyl-substituted molecule (796 nm). The optical band gaps of BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl were measured to be 1.34 eV, while that of BTIC-C12-4Cl was slightly larger at 1.39 eV. The smaller band gap compared with that of the linear-substituted acceptors implied more ordered aggregations of the branched alkyl-substituted acceptors. The absorption spectra of the blended films of PBDB-TF:BTIC-C12-4Cl, PBDB-TF:BTIC-EH-4Cl, PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl, and PBDB-TF:BTIC-HD-4Cl showed a slight blue-shift compared with the pure thin films of these acceptors, as shown in Fig. 1c. The peak intensity of PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl (824 nm) in the long-wavelength region was the highest among the four blend films, indicating that the strongest π–π intermolecular interactions were present in the PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl blend films. Above all, the broad optical absorption range and the high absorption coefficient of BTIC-BO-4Cl would beneficial for the effective utilization of solar photons.11

The cyclic voltammetry method was employed to study the electrochemical properties of the four acceptors (Fig. S2†). The onset oxidation potentials (Eox)/onset reduction potentials (Ered) of BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl were 0.76/−0.64 V, 0.78/−0.61, 0.74/−0.66 V, and 0.78/−0.66 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. Their corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy levels were estimated at −5.56/−4.16 eV, −5.58/−4.19 eV, −5.54/−4.14 eV, and −5.58/−4.14 eV, respectively (Fig. 1d and Table 1). These results implied that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were mainly determined by the molecular backbone, and the alkyl chains substituted at the N positions had a negligible effect on the molecular energy levels of the four molecules. The small ΔEHOMO offset (0.09–0.13 eV) between the four chlorinated acceptors and the PBDB-TF donor would provide sufficient driving force for charge separation and prove beneficial in achieving low energy loss.25 The electrochemical band gaps (Eecg) of BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl were measured to be 1.44, 1.40, 1.40, and 1.40 eV, respectively, and were very close to their optical band gaps (1.34–1.39 eV).

In addition, the single crystal of BTIC-BO-4Cl was successfully prepared by the slow diffusion growth method from the poor solvent ethanol to the good solvent chloroform to investigate the molecular configuration and packing behavior (Fig. 2 and S4–S6†). As shown in Fig. S4,† the distance of S⋯O was 2.67 Å in single BTIC-BO-4Cl molecules, which endowed this acceptor with good planarity and a small dihedral angle of 7.6° between the central core and the dichlorinated end groups. The two 2-butyloctyl chains on the N atom were situated in completely opposite directions (Fig. S5†), demonstrating that the size of the alkyl chains, especially the length of the side chains, would greatly influence the packing of nearby molecules. This phenomenon could explain why the different sizes and different types of alkyl chains led to very different device performances. Though both 2-butyloctyl chain (BTIC-BO-4Cl) and the 1-dodecyl chain (BTIC-C12-4Cl) have the same number of carbon atoms, the π–π distance between two BTIC-C12-4Cl molecules was larger than that between two BTIC-BO-4Cl molecules due to its relatively longer length linear of the C12 alkyl chain. Therefore, its efficiency was much worse than that of BTIC-BO-4Cl. BTIC-BO-4Cl exhibited short π–π distances ranging from 3.29 Å to 3.53 Å between two adjacent molecules (Fig. 2c) due to the end-group interactions, which resulted in the J-aggregation of the whole molecules. Despite two large chlorine atoms at the end groups, short π–π distances of 3.29 and 3.45 Å were obtained between the end groups of two adjacent molecules. Especially, the two end groups with the π–π distance of 3.29 Å were almost completely overlapped, which was beneficial for achieving efficient electron hopping between these molecules. The short π–π distances of BTIC-BO-4Cl was benefit from the multiple interlocked Cl⋯S (3.57, 3.56, and 4.01 Å) and Cl⋯π (3.28 Å) interactions as measured from its single crystal. As shown in Fig. 2d and S6,† these interactions allowed BTIC-BO-4Cl to present a kind of closed spiral ring microstructure that consisted of four molecules in three layers in the vertical direction (Fig. 2a and b). Each ring was connected with two adjacent molecules through strong interactions, so as to eventually form a three-dimensional (3D) interpenetrating network, which could be beneficial for the electron transport in multiple directions, thus leading to increased electron mobility.

Computational stimulation
To gain deeper insights into the electronic properties and molecular structures of these small molecules, theoretical calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.35 To simplify the calculations, the alkyl groups were replaced by methyl groups. As shown in Fig. S3,† the HOMO energy levels of these acceptors were mainly concentrated at the central cores, and the LUMO levels were widely distributed across the whole molecules and showed even higher distribution at the dichlorinated end groups. The dihedral angles between the chlorinated end groups and the core were calculated to be 0.24°, which implied the negligible steric hindrance when the Cl atoms were designed to the tail ends of the NFAs. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of these acceptors were −3.65 eV and −5.67 eV, respectively. The low HOMO levels indicated that the chlorination strategy on the end groups of the NFAs could efficiently lower the energy levels.
Photovoltaic properties
The effects of the different alkyl chains on the photovoltaic properties of these acceptors were investigated by fabricating BHJ OSCs with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-TF:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. Here, PBDB-TF was used as the donor material due to its strong absorption in the 300–750 nm region,36 which matches with the energy levels of these four chlorinated acceptors. Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, and the key device parameters are summarized in Table 2. The PBDB-TF:BTIC-C12-4Cl-based device achieved a PCE of 11.36% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.84 V and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.82 mA cm−2 when CF was used as the processing solvent. The relatively lower PCE was mainly caused by its low current density. The PBDB-TF:BTIC-EH-4Cl-based device showed a PCE of 9.38% due to its limited solubility in CF. In this context, when chlorobenzene (CB) was chosen as the processing solvent, a VOC of 0.83 V, along with an enhanced JSC of 25.13 mA cm−2 and FF of 68.64% were achieved, and the PCE dramatically improved to 14.28% (Fig. S7†). The unsatisfactory PCE of this acceptor in CF pushed us to understand that the 2-ethylhexyl substituent was not sufficient to meet the solubility requirement of this core structure. Therefore, the longer alkyl chains, namely 2-butyloctyl and 2-hexyldecyl, were introduced to solve this problem. When 2-butyloctyl side chains were introduced, the PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl-based device showed much higher JSC (24.80 mA cm−2) and FF (72.20%), and a PCE of 15.13% was obtained in CF. However, when the side chains became a little bit longer in BTIC-HD-4Cl, only a lower PCE of 13.95% could be achieved in the CF solution. Due to the impressive photovoltaic performance of BTIC-BO-4Cl, we also tested its devices using CB as the processing solvent, which showed further improved FF (76.25%) and JSC (25.26 mA cm−2), eventually leading to an excellent PCE of 16.43% in this system. From these results, we could conclude that branched alkyl chains are crucial to achieve high efficiency in this fused core system, and the device performance dramatically improved when the size of the branched side chains was optimized.

The Eloss values were calculated to be 0.65, 0.58, 0.61, and 0.63 eV for the devices based on BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl, respectively, where Eloss is defined as Eloss = Eg − eVOC (Eg of the blend films were determined from the intersection of the extrapolated EQE edge and the local EQE maximum at the edge of the EQE spectrum).37,38 It was found that the Eloss values of the three branched-chain acceptors (0.48–0.63 eV) were smaller than that of the BTIC-C12-4Cl-based device (0.65 eV). Due to their lower Eloss, the three branched-chain acceptors could still maintain a relatively high VOC upon significantly broadening their spectral range. Compared with the devices of the other three acceptors, the BTIC-BO-4Cl-based devices showed higher JSC and FF values. High JSC stems from the balanced intermolecular interactions of the different alkyl chains, and high FF is due to the enhanced mobility and favorable morphology of the blend films. The improved JSC value of PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl was also further evidenced by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves. As shown in Fig. 3b, all these devices showed a broad response in the EQE curve range of 300–930 nm. The PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl-based devices showed broader photo-responses than those of the other devices, especially in the long-wavelength region. The maximum EQE value of the PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl-based device was 81%, which was higher than those of the PBDB-TF:BTIC-HD-4Cl (79%), PBDB-TF:BTIC-C12-4Cl (66%), and PBDB-TF:BTIC-EH-4Cl (71.7%)-based devices, indicating more efficient charge generation and collection in the PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl-based OSCs. The integrated JSC calculated from the EQE spectra of BTIC-C12-4Cl (CF), BTIC-EH-4Cl (CF), BTIC-BO-4Cl (CF), BTIC-BO-4Cl (CB), and BTIC-HD-4Cl (CF) were 18.99, 18.72, 23.73, 24.58, and 22.26 mA cm−2, respectively, which were very close to the values obtained from the J–V measurements (<5% error).
The diagrams of photocurrent (Jph) vs. effective voltage (Veff) of the devices were also investigated to study the exciton dissociation and charge collection process in the four devices (Fig. 3c). Jph is defined as JL–JD, where JL is the current density under illumination, and JD is the current density in the dark. Veff is defined as V0–Va, where Va is the applied voltage and V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero. All the four devices reached their saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) when Veff was at about 1 V, suggested reduced charge recombination at higher voltages. In addition, the charge dissociation and charge collection probability P(E,T) values could be calculated via the equation Jph/Jsat and were determined to be 90%, 91%, 96%, and 92% for the BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl-based devices, respectively. The highest P(E,T) value indicated that the BTIC-BO-4Cl-based devices exhibited the most efficient charge dissociation and collection process compared with those of the BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl-based devices.
To further study the charge recombination behavior under the short-circuit condition, the correlations of JSCversus light density (P) were also measured for the four blends (Fig. 3d), which could be described by the equation JSC ∝ Plightα. The α value for the BTIC-BO-4Cl-based OSCs was calculated to be 0.99, which was a little higher than those of BTIC-C12-4Cl (0.96), BTIC-EH-4Cl (0.93), and BTIC-HD-4Cl (0.98), demonstrating that the bimolecular recombinations in the BTIC-BO-4Cl-based OSCs were weaker than the other three device types.
Hole mobility
The hole and electron mobility of the BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl blend films were determined by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method using the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-TF:acceptor (1.1:1, w/w)/MoO3/Ag (Table S1 and Fig. S8†). The hole mobilities of BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl were 1.9 × 10−4, 5.7 × 10−5, 3.6 × 10−4, and 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The electron mobilities were determined to be 8.7 × 10−5, 7.7 × 10−5, 2.4 × 10−4, and 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It was found that BTIC-BO-4Cl showed higher values for both hole and electron mobilities than the other three acceptors. At the same time, more balanced hole/electron mobility (μh/μe) was also obtained for the PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl film (1.5), whereas it was about 2.2 for PBDB-TF:BTIC-C12-4Cl and 2.3 for PBDB-TF:BTIC-HD-4Cl. Both high mobility and charge balance are favorable for charge transport and efficient carrier collection, and would have led to the high JSC and FF values for the PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl-based devices, as shown above.39
Morphological characterization
To further study the morphology of the blend films of these four acceptors, AFM and TEM measurements were also performed. As shown in Fig. 4a–d, the blended films of PBDB-TF:BTIC-C12-4Cl, PBDB-TF:BTIC-EH-4Cl, PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl, and PBDB-TF:BTIC-HD-4Cl exhibited quite smooth and uniform surfaces with similar root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values of 0.724, 0.923, 0.773, and 0.773 nm, respectively. The TEM (Fig. 4e–h) images also showed that all four acceptors exhibited uniform morphology with appropriate domain sizes. The branched alkyl-substituted acceptor blend films showed slightly bigger domain sizes than that of the linear alkyl-substituted acceptor. This was likely due to the faster crystallization rate of BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl, which might have resulted in a more ordered condensed state and larger phase domain sizes in the blend films. It could help the branched side chain-substituted acceptors attain higher phase purities and eventually, elevate the Jsc and FF values of their photovoltaic devices.40

The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) method was used to determine the correlation between the microstructure of the blend films and the photovoltaic performance of the devices. All the three branched-chain acceptors (Fig. 5a–c) showed clear (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction, suggesting the dominant existence of the face-on orientation, while the PBDB-TF:BTIC-C12-4Cl blend showed a predominantly edge-on preferred orientation (π–π distance: 3.9 Å), as shown in Fig. 5d. In detail, the (010) diffraction peaks of PBDB-TF:BTIC-EH-4Cl, PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl, and PBDB-TF:BTIC-HD-4Cl showed the π–π distances of 3.9, 3.8 and 3.8 Å, respectively (Fig. 5f), whereas almost no diffraction peak could be observed in this region for the PBDB-TF:BTIC-C12-4Cl blend film. In the in-plane direction, the lamellar packing distances for PBDB-TF:BTIC-C12-4Cl, PBDB-TF:BTIC-EH-4Cl, PBDB-TF:BTIC-BO-4Cl, and PBDB-TF:BTIC-HD-4Cl were determined to be 25.6, 22.2, 22.2, and 22.2 Å, respectively. This implied that PBDB-TF:BTIC-C12-4Cl blend film had the largest lamellar packing distance of these four blends due to the longest linear alkyl chain. Therefore, it looks like the incorporation of different lengths of branched alkyl chains into these acceptors did not obviously affect the intermolecular interactions in the blend films, but the linear C12 chain turned the molecular orientation to edge-on dominant, and thus hindered its performance as active material in OSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, four chlorinated nonfullerene acceptors with different alkyl chain substituents at the N position, namely BTIC-C12-4Cl, BTIC-EH-4Cl, BTIC-BO-4Cl, and BTIC-HD-4Cl, were synthesized and characterized. The films of the branched alkyl-substituted molecules exhibited larger red-shifts in absorption and better phase separation compared with that made of the linear alkyl-substituted molecule. Based on the single-crystal analysis, BTIC-BO-4Cl exhibited short π–π distances (3.29–3.53 Å) between the adjacent molecules due to multiple interlocked Cl⋯S and Cl⋯π interactions. Because of the S⋯O, Cl⋯S, and Cl⋯π interactions, this nonfullerene acceptor formed a 3D interpenetrating network, leading to high electron mobility. As a result, the acceptor with 2-butyloctyl side chains (BTIC-BO-4Cl) delivered an excellent PCE of 16.43% in combination with PBDB-TF due to its short π–π stacking distance, good morphology formation, and better charge transport property. The linear alkyl-substituted molecule (BTIC-C12-4Cl) showed a much lower PCE of 11.36% in the parallel device test. All these results indicate the great potential of chlorinated end-capped nonfullerene acceptors in high-efficiency polymer solar cells and that alkyl chain engineering plays a very important role in these systems, with strong non-covalent intermolecular interactions optimizing the final device performance.
