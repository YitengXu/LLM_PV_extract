    , Accepted 8th February 2023First published on 8th February 2023AbstractWe report a heterostructure photocathode composed of the optimal gradient of nickel cobalt disulphide layers (NiCo2S4 NS) over a p-Si nanowire (Si NW) surface designed for the solar-assisted water reduction process. The optimal Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS heterostructure exhibits enriched solar water reduction activity with a photocurrent density of 15 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V vs. RHE applied bias and an onset potential of 301 mV vs. RHE under simulated solar irradiation. Moreover, the fabricated heterostructure photocathode (Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS) at the applied bias of −0.3 V vs. RHE produces a hydrogen gas evolution rate of around 53.75 μmol cm−2 h−1. The accomplished catalytic activity of the heterostructure can be attributed to the HER electrocatalyst properties of NiCo2S4 as an interfacial layer, such as interfacial energies, charge transfer kinetics, and solar-driven water reduction activity at the photocathode/electrolyte interface. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study demonstrates a significant reduction in charge transfer resistance that results in rapid electron transfer at the interface for efficient charge separation and migration processes. The density functional theory calculations reveal that NiCo2S4 NS has a suitable electronic band alignment with a water redox potential advancing the catalytic efficiency owing to barrier-free electron transport with near-zero Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption on hetero-interface sites (ΔGH* = 0.02 eV at Co1 site). Consequently, the proposed heterostructure scheme is a promising strategy for designing a high-performance Si photocathode for solar water reduction.
Introduction
Global energy demand has become one of the most serious issues in current decades and is expected to increase to 20 TW by 2050. However, our traditional fuels, such as oil, coal, and natural gas, are rapidly increasing in demand and requirement, posing a serious threat to environmental pollution.1–3 In this direction, recent studies have focused on solar energy conversion technology because it is the most abundant alternative renewable energy source and is a clean and green resource on earth.3–5 Furthermore, one-thousandth of the amount of solar energy that reaches our planet is more than enough to meet the entire global energy demand (36 TW) using an efficient carbon-free approach.6 Nowadays, solar-powered photoelectrochemical water splitting is a sustainable route for converting solar energy into green chemical fuels, such as hydrogen gas.3–5 Typically, photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC) under solar irradiation is an efficient technique for producing hydrogen and oxygen gases using a device that comprises a photoactive electrode as an anode/cathode immersed in an aqueous electrolyte. Additionally, the generated charge carriers on the photoelectrode surface are efficiently separated and migrated at the electrode/electrolyte interface via a drift and diffusion process for the redox process of water under solar irradiation.6–8 Thus, the design and development of photoactive semiconductor electrodes are essential criteria for achieving proper photo-generated charge carrier transport from a photo-absorber to a solid/liquid interface, where catalytic active sites can oxidise or reduce water.8–10
Typically, p-silicon (Si) is a favourable candidate for photocathode owing to its unique electronic/optical band structure and estimated theoretical maximum photocurrent density of 44 mA cm−2.6,10,11 Previously, numerous PEC water reduction studies of Si photocathode reveal that the low-dimensional nanostructures, including nanowires (NW) and nano-belts, possess good anti-reflectance, high surface to volume ratio and unique electrical properties over their counterpart.12–14 However, ineffective charge-transfer kinetics at Si/electrolyte, and limited hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active sites remain difficult and challenging to fabricate highly efficient p-Si photocathodes.6,10–16 Therefore, researchers are devoting more time and effort to the design and development of efficient low-dimension nanostructures of Si as photocathodes using various surface modification strategies.16–19 Among them, the formation of photoelectrode heterostructures with various non-precious HER co-catalysts is an effective tool for attaining the desired properties for the solar-driven water splitting process.19–21 To achieve low-cost substitutes, transition metal carbides (Mo2C, WC, V8C7), nitrides (MoN, CoMoNx, NiCoON), phosphides (CoPi, Ni12P5, NiP2), and chalcogenides (MoS2, WS2, VS2) have been extensively investigated in modern years as competent HER electrocatalysts for PEC water reduction.7,21–23 Currently, Ni–Co sulphide as a bimetallic sulfide (NiCo2S4) has been found to be a preferred HER electrocatalyst candidate that provides a rich redox reaction with a higher electrochemical reaction than single metal sulphide (Ni3S2, CoS2, Co3S4) owing to the different valence states of Ni and Co.24–26 However, several experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that NiCo2S4 material has a more metallic nature than narrow band gap semiconductor, advanced electrode material for superior supercapacitor and electrocatalytic performance. In particular, the NiCo2S4 nanostructure offers more metal active sites for HER materials in acidic and alkaline electrolytes and higher charge carrier density conductivity to facilitate various catalytic reactions, such as the water redox process.25–28 For example, NiCo2S4 nanostructure exhibits strong redox reactions and higher electrical conductivity, which is nearly 100 times greater electron conductivity than NiCo2O4.29,30 From the aforementioned perspective, the HER electrocatalyst layered structure of NiCo2S4 NS deposition on the Si NW surface as a heterostructure photocathode could be a promising way to reduce the surface kinetic barrier and promote the redox process at the electrode/electrolyte interface for PEC water reduction activity. However, an ultrathin layer of NiCo2S4 over the Si NW surface remains a more favourable interface for the transfer of electrons from the space charge region to the electrolyte, resulting in improved charge separation and migration efficiency.23,31–34 To date, no reports have been published on NiCo2S4 NS as a HER cocatalyst deposited on Si NW surfaces as heterostructure photocathodes for solar-driven PEC water reduction under simulated solar illumination.
Herein, a generalised heterostructure approach is developed for the first time to anchor the bimetallic sulphide (NiCo2S4 NS) over the Si NW surface for PEC water reduction activity. In the heterostructure procedure, NiCo2S4 NS modified on vertically aligned Si NW surfaces is formed using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique, while Si NWs is employed by the metal assistant chemical etching method. The different assessments are used to examine the structural, morphological, electrical transport and PEC solar water reduction performance of fabricated heterostructure photocathodes. The effects of NiCo2S4 NS as an interfacial layer on the interfacial energetics, charge transfer and PEC water reduction activity of Si NW as photocathodes are investigated in detail with respect to different deposition cycles of NiCo2S4 NS (1, 3 and 5 cycles). In PEC analysis, the optimized heterostructure photocathode (Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS-3 cycles) demonstrates enhanced photocatalytic HER activity with a maximum photocurrent density of 15 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V (vs. RHE) under 0.5 M of H2SO4 electrolyte condition. Additionally, a heterostructure photocathode produces the solar water reduction process with an anodic onset potential of 301 mV, whereas a bare Si NW photocathode produces 45 mV. Such improved PEC performance of heterostructure facilities is credited to efficient photon-induced charge carrier separation with a prolonged lifetime, as evidenced by the electrochemical impedance measurement. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations give insights into the charge density distribution and superior electron transfer progression on the heterostructure surface with HER accessible active sites. Thus, the observed experimental and theoretical evidence shows that the proposed strategy could be versatile for the solar-driven PEC water reduction process.
Experimental section
Fabrication of Si nanowires
Using a p-type Si (100) substrate as a starting wafer, a two-step metal-aided chemical etching procedure was employed to fabricate the Si nanowires. Prior to the wet etching process, the Si substrates were ultrasonically cleaned using acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and de-ionized water for 15 minutes before being immersed in a concentrate hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution to remove organic residues and native oxides. Following the substrate cleaning procedure, Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were deposited on the cleaned Si wafer surface by immersing the wafer in an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (0.01 M AgNO3) and HF (4.8 M) for 30 seconds at room temperature. Subsequently, Ag NPs deposited Si substrates were etched for 20 minutes at room temperature in an optimum etching solution containing 40% HF (4.6 M) and 30% H2O2 (0.6 M). Trace amounts of Ag particles were eliminated by immersing the etched sample in a concentrated HNO3 aqueous solution for 30 min to achieve vertically aligned Si NWs.
Deposition of NiCo2S4 NS on the Si NW surface
NiCo2S4 NS, as an electrocatalyst layer, was effectively deposited as a thin layer on etched Si NWs using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process at room temperature. Immersing the substrate in separate anionic and cationic precursor solutions and then washing it with double distilled water between each immersion to remove loosely bound metal ions is a standard SILAR process. As shown in Scheme 1, the net SILAR method comprises four beakers, two of which are filled with distilled water and the other two with anionic and cationic precursor solutions. The anionic salts of 0.005 M of Ni (NO3)2·6H2O and 0.01 M of Co (NO3)2·6H2O were mixed and dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water. Similarly, 0.01 M of Na2S cationic salt was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water to prepare the resultant anionic cationic solutions. The HF-treated etched Si NW substrate was dipped into Ni2+ and Co2+ ionic solutions for 10 seconds before being immersed in distilled water (second beaker) for 5 seconds in the first SILAR cycle. After that, the anionic deposited Si NW was immersed in S2− solutions for 10 seconds before being dipped in distilled water for 5 seconds to complete one cycle, and the same protocol was used to complete 3 and 5 cycles of NiCo2S4 on the Si NW surface. Thereafter, the resultant samples were dried at 100 °C for 4 hours to obtain the Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS heterostructure sample.

Material characterization
The crystal structure of the prepared heterostructure was analysed using X-ray diffraction measurement (PANalytical) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Carl Zeiss, Sigma) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (Oxford instruments) at a 10 keV accelerating electron beam was used to analyse the surface morphologies and elemental analyses. Further, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEMLEBRA 200 TEM-Carl Zeiss) was used to examine the atomic structure and interface of the prepared heterostructure. The surface elemental analysis and elemental electronic state of the samples were examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The anti-reflectance property of the heterostructure was evaluated using UV-visible spectroscopy with a range of 400 to 1100 nm.
PEC measurements
PEC water splitting studies were conducted in a three-electrode cell using an electrochemical workstation (Biologic SP150) with as-prepared Si-based photocathodes as working electrodes, a Ag/AgCl (1.0 M KOH) as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. The experimentally measured potentials versus Ag/AgCl were computed to the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation:  where  and EAg/AgCl is measurement potential versus Ag/AgCl reference and electrolyte 0.5 M H2SO4 (pH ∼ 0). To achieve ohmic electrical contact with the working electrode, a silver paste was fixed using copper wire with the backside of the working electrode. All the PEC measurement of prepared photocathode was carried out under the Xe lamp (Oriel 300 W & 100 mW cm−2) with an AM 1.5 G filter (1 sun condition). In addition, the evolved H2 gas rate of the fabricated photocathode was estimated using a gas chromatography (Shimadzu-GC 2014) unit equipped with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) under solar irradiation. Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 1 MHz with 5 mV AC amplitude.
Computational details
The electronic and catalytic properties of the Si/NiCo2S4 heterostructure were investigated using first-principle calculations implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) version of generalized gradient approximation was considered the exchange-correlation functional. The projector-augmented wave method with a cut-off energy of 500 eV was employed. The supercell size of the Si/NiCo2S4 heterostructure is taken as 6.7 Å × 11.6 Å × 38 Å along with a vacuum of 20 Å, along the z-direction to avoid interactions between images created owing to periodicity. The spin-polarization calculations were performed using a Γ-centered k-point grid of 5 × 3 × 1 (9 × 7 × 1) to sample the Brillouin zone for self-consistent (DOS). The conjugant gradient algorithm was used for geometrical optimization, with a convergence threshold set at 10−5 eV for energy and 10−3 eV Å−1 for the Hellman–Feynman force on each atom. Moreover, the charge distribution and transfer between the H atom and the surface are estimated using Bader charge analysis.
The catalytic activities of the Si/NiCo2S4 heterostructure towards hydrogen evolution were verified through the change in Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) and referred to as a key descriptor of the HER activity and defined as ΔGH* = ΔEH + ΔEZPE − TΔSH, where ΔEZPE and TΔSH were the change in zero-point energy and entropy between adsorbed hydrogen H* (intermediate state) and hydrogen in the gas phase (final state), respectively. For the gas a phase, the entropy is calculated under the standard condition, and the value of TΔS at T = 300 K is calculated as −0.20 eV. The contribution of ΔEZPE for H adsorption is relatively small and is usually 0.04 eV. Therefore, the adsorption free energy related to the HER mechanism is calculated using the equation: ΔGH* = ΔEH + 0.24, and the hydrogen binding energy ΔEH can be calculated using , where ECat+H and Ecat are the total energies of the catalysts with and without adsorbed hydrogen, respectively.
Results and discussion
The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs of the etched Si NW and Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS heterostructure reveal the surface morphology features, as shown in Fig. S1.† The plain and cross-section views of the etched Si FESEM micrograph illustrate vertically aligned nanowires perpendicular to the Si substrate with a homogeneous distribution of nanowires over the whole wafer. Moreover, well-separated and vertically oriented NWs with an average length of 10 μm were achieved. The FESEM image (shown in Fig. S1†) displays the discontinuous network structure of highly transparent NiCo2S4 NS anchored on the side-wall surface Si NWs and covered on the top surface. However, the energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) mapping of the prepared heterostructure depicts the good distribution of Ni, Co and S elements over the Si NW surface, which indicates that the NiCo2S4 NS is efficiently loaded on the Si NW surface without any impurities, as shown in Fig. S2.† To further understand the surface features and atomic structure of the prepared samples, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) characterization were carried out. The samples were prepared by scratching NWs from the etched substrate and then dispersed on a TEM grid for electron microscopic studies. The ultra-thin NiCo2S4 NS layer wrapped on a single NW is clearly noticeable in the obtained TEM micrograph of the Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS heterostructure, as shown in Fig. 1. The surface features are consistent with the FESEM micrographs. The HR-TEM image depicts a pristine etched single Si NW as a smooth surface with a computed lattice spacing of 3.11 Å, which corresponds to the (111) plane of the cubic structure (as shown in Fig. 1b and c).35,36 As shown in Fig. 1e–g, the HR-TEM micrograph of the heterostructure exhibits lattice fringes with a spacing of 2.85 Å corresponding to the (311) plane of NiCo2S4 NS cubic spinel phase on the Si NW surface. Moreover, the proposed heterostructure demonstrates intimate contact between the Si NW and NiCo2S4 NS, which could accelerate photon-induced charge separation and migration at the interface; thus, the prepared heterostructure provides efficient photocatalytic activity.33,37

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyse the chemical state of the elements on the surface of the prepared samples. The characteristic peaks of Si, Ni, Co, S, C and O elements are obtained from the survey level XPS spectra of the prepared heterostructure, as presented in the ESI (Fig. S4†). The universal XPS peaks of the C and O elements are purely attributed to surface oxidation and contamination by exposure to air. The high-resolution core-level XPS spectra of Si 2p, Ni 2p, Co 2p and S 2p are depicted in Fig. 2. The observed two binding energy (BE) peaks at 99.4 (Si 2p1/2), 98.7 (Si 2p3/2) and 103.5 eV in the Si 2p XPS spectra are assigned to bare Si and SiOx bonding, respectively. When exposed to air, the SiOx bond forms on a native silicon oxide on the Si surface.39,40 The core-level spectrum of Ni 2p shows two spin-orbital doublets of Ni 2p3/2 (856.2 eV) and Ni 2p1/2 (873.8). Further, the deconvolution of the Ni 2p peaks reveals the coexistence of Ni3+ and Ni2+ as well as shakeup satellite peaks attributed to oxidized Ni species due to surface oxidation. Similarly, the Co 2p core region is diverse into two spin-orbital doublets, such as Co 2p3/2 (780.1 eV) and Co 2p1/2 (795.4 eV), along with the other two small peaks spotted. Moreover, the observed Co 2p spectra deconvoluted with four peaks can be assigned as Co3+ and Co2+. The deconvoluted peaks at 161.6 eV and 162.8 eV are associated with S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively.38,41 Overall, the obtained XPS results demonstrate the presence of mixed-valence states of both metal ions (Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+) in the prepared heterostructure, which further confirms the presence of NiCo2S4 NS on the Si NW surface.

As shown in Fig. 3a, the PEC performance of the Si NW heterostructure photocathode was characterised and compared to a controlled photocathode in 0.5 M H2SO4 under simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). At a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, the potential window of the prepared photocathodes is a sweep from positive to negative in the range of 0.3 V to −0.8 V vs. RHE. The Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS was investigated with the various SILAR cycles (1, 3 and 6) to determine the optimal HER co-catalyst content on the Si NW surface for efficient PEC water reduction performance. Fig. 3a depicts the photocurrent density vs. potential (J–V) profile of the photocathode, demonstrating the significance of constructing the heterostructure of NiCo2S4 NS as a HER catalyst with Si NW. Upon illumination, the heterostructure photocathode provides higher photocurrent density with the cathodic shift in onset potential of a Faradaic chemical reaction than the pristine photocathode, which is attributed to the efficient photocatalytic activity with abundant HER active sites on the heterostructure surface.40,42 The current density of all photocathodes examined in this study shows an insignificant dark current, as demonstrated in the ESI (Fig. S6†). The Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS-3 cycles have a higher photocurrent density of 15 mA cm−2 achieved at −0.80 V vs. RHE applied bias with higher positive onset potential (301 mV vs. RHE) than pristine Si wafers. However, the observed photocurrent density of the heterostructure shows a 15-fold increment over the control (1 mA cm−2). Furthermore, the onset potential of the heterostructure positively increases from 5 mV to 301 mV (vs. RHE), indicating enhanced transfer of photogenerated carriers at semiconductor/electrolyte interface when compared to a pristine photocathode.39,42,43 Thus, the improved PEC performance of heterostructure photocathodes can be linked to the charge separation/transfer kinetics and enhanced catalytic activity at Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS/electrolyte interface.

Fig. 3b shows the photocurrent versus time plot for fabricated photocathodes measured under simulated solar light illumination with 30 s light on/off cycles to analyse transient photocurrent response behaviour. In comparison with the pristine Si NW photocathode, the Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS photocathode exhibits very good photo-switching performance with a higher photocurrent (3.5 mA cm−2) and a greater steady-state photocurrent density that matches the observed J–V profile. Fig. 4a shows the sustained operation of the heterostructure photocathode compared with the pristine photocathode at −0.4 V vs. RHE as applied bias under continuous solar irradiation. Compared with the Si photocathode, the heterostructure photocathode offers enhanced photocurrent density with no sign of deterioration during the continuous operation of the solar water reduction process. The observed photocurrent density versus time profiles of the heterostructure demonstrates excellent photostability and the opposite effect of the catalytic layer on the stability of the solar water reduction process. Furthermore, the solar water reduction activity was performed to estimate the hydrogen gas evolution rate on the photocathode (Si NW/NiCo2S4-3 cycles) surface using gas chromatography analysis. Fig. 4b illustrates the comparison of the amount of hydrogen gas evolution via experimentally and theoretically estimated hydrogen production (using ESI eqn S7†) with respect to different solar irradiation times at −0.3 V vs. RHE applied bias. It can be found that the heterostructure photocathode produces a higher hydrogen evolution rate of around 53.75 μmol cm−2 for 1 hour, which is nearly 28 times higher than its counterpart (1.92 μmol cm−2). Therefore, the heterostructure photocathode clearly indicates the positive effect of NiCo2S4 as an HER catalytic layer at the photocathode/electrolyte interface and evolves hydrogen gas via Faradaic reaction with good stability under solar irradiation.

Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of prepared photocathodes were performed to understand the electron transport kinetics at the interface. The EIS measurement of the prepared photocathodes is performed at −0.2 vs. RHE as an applied bias in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 1 MHz under light illumination, as shown in Fig. 5. The Nyquist impedance plots of the prepared samples illustrate two distinct semicircles in the higher and lower frequency regions. However the scatter points and solid lines correspond to experimental and fitted data to an equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 5a). Typically, the semicircle in the high-frequency range (Rct1) is caused by a depletion layer in the semiconductor, while the semicircle in the low-frequency range (Rct2) is caused by charge transfer resistance at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The smallest semicircle (Rct2) at a low frequency represents the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the Si photocathode and electrolyte, which directly reflects catalytic activity.44 The significant reduction in the overall impedance of the heterostructure (Rct = Rct1 + Rct2: 4005 Ω) can be attributed to the appropriate band bending and electron shuttling of the electrode-to-electrolyte in the presence of an interfacial layer (NiCo2S4) NS, which is faster than that of its own pristine (Rct = Rct1 + Rct2: 70025 Ω). Consequently, the observed EIS suggests a lower charge transfer resistance at the Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS/electrolyte interface, indicating a good correlation with remarkably increased photocurrent density.42,44 Furthermore, the carrier transport/recombination process in the semiconductor is analysed using a Bode plot as a phase in response to frequencies, as shown in Fig. 5b. From the Bode plot, the carrier lifetime of electrons was calculated using the measured frequency at the maximum phase (illustrated in ESI as eqn S8†). As per the Bode plot, the characteristic peak frequency (fmax) value of the prepared heterostructure photocathode shifted towards a lower value (from 175 to 5 Hz), implying a longer electron lifetime (τ) than the bare photocathode. Additionally, the estimated lifetime of electrons of the prepared photocathodes provides an extended lifetime of electrons (τ: 29.27 ms), whereas Si NW holds for 0.90 ms.45 As a result of the overall EIS measurement, the heterostructure-based photocathode has reduced charge transfer resistance with a prolonged lifetime at the Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS/electrolyte. Thus, the observed EIS studies provide direct evidence of efficient photon-induced charge separation and migration for an improved solar-driven water reduction process.

The fabricated heterostructure was analyzed by calculating the band structure and projected density of states using first-principles calculations to validate the experimental HER catalytic activity. The catalytic activity of Si/NiCo2S4 heterostructure was performed at five different binding sites (Co atom, Ni atom, and S atom) on the NiCo2S4 (111) surface for hydrogen adsorption (side and top views are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively). The top view of the optimized heterostructure shows the bond formation between NiCo2S4 and the Si surface using Si–S chemical bonding at the interface. The surface geometry of Si/NiCo2S4 heterostructure is performed to simulate the adsorption sites of hydrogen absorbed (as shown in Fig. 6b). Fig. 6b shows the five possible hydrogen adsorption sites on the surface: (1) top Ni sites (Ni-site), (2) top Co sites (Co1 and Co2 sites) and (3) top S sites (S1 and S2 sites). The equilibrium distance between the H atom and the corresponding base atom/site is 1.47 Å, 1.92 Å, 1.5 Å, and 1.36 Å for the Co1, Co2, Ni, and S2 sites, respectively, to study the HER performance of the proposed heterostructure. In the case of the S1 site, after relaxation, the H atom becomes attached to the Co1 atom, and the equilibrium distance between the H atom and the Co1 atoms is 1.46 Å. The charge density difference at the interface between the H and Co1 atoms reveals that electrons accumulate near hydrogen as yellow lobes. In contrast, charge depletion zones, such as blue lobes, are detected at the nearest S atoms, as shown in Fig. 6c and d.

(c) and (d) Side and top views of charge density difference of H adsorbed at Co1 site (iso-surface = 0.01 e Å−3). The charge accumulation and depletion regions are represented by yellow and cyan colors (Si, Ni, Co, S, and H atoms are represented by blue, green, magenta, yellow and white spheres, respectively). 
According to the thermodynamical system, the Gibbs free energy of the adsorbed H* (ΔGH*) is a common descriptor for estimating HER performance. The ΔGH* should be close to zero for an ideal catalyst to benefit from faster Had* formation and rapid concomitant hydrogen release. Fig. 7a depicts the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) diagram of all five possible adsorption sites along with the Si surface calculated to describe the HER activity. Fig. 7a demonstrates that the H atom at the Co1 site shows the lowest ΔGH* of 0.02 eV, indicating the superlative catalytically active site, whereas Ni, Co2, S1, and S2 sites provide higher ΔGH* of 0.79 eV, 0.72 eV, 0.023 eV and 0.25 eV, respectively. In the case of the silicon surface, ΔGH* = −1.32 eV, which is significantly below the ideal value and hence considered a catalytically inert surface. The extremely high negative value of ΔGH* around −1.32 eV on the Si sites exhibits very high binding strength of the hydrogen molecule, leading to the slow release of the resultant gaseous H2 molecule on the catalyst site. As a result, the NiCo2S4 as HER co-catalyst heterostructure formation with the Si surface provides a lower value of (ΔGH*). Additionally, the obtained value indicates the presence of higher HER activity, attributed to their interface electronic coupling structure, and insistent down the value of (ΔGH*) by increasing the H* adsorption energy at the Co2 active site.42 The calculated projected density of states (PDOS) and Bader charge analysis have been systematically studied, as shown in Fig. 7b.
 Fig. 7  (a) Calculated total and projected density of states (DOS) and (b) Gibbs free energy diagram of the Si/NiCo2S4 heterostructure. 
The calculated PDOS of the heterostructure illustrates that a strong interaction between Si and NiCo2S4 originates via strong hybridization near the Fermi level (both below and above). The states near the Fermi level (both below and above) primarily comprise the Co-3d, Si-3s + 3p, and S-3s + 3p orbitals, revealing their intrinsically metallic properties and a faster rate of charge transfer. The electron localization function of both Si and Si/NiCo2S4 (111) heterostructures are calculated, as illustrated in Fig. 8a and b, for further insights into the charge transfer towards hydrogen. Among the active sites, the Co1 site has the highest HER activity as well as metallic nature (Co-3d) and fast electron transfer for the HER process. Compared to the Si/NiCo2S4 heterostructure, electrons are localized at the Si (111) surface, showing partial delocalization around the Co site metal atoms and closer to the Si atoms.

However, photon-induced electrons are effectively transferred into the heterostructure surface via an interfacial layer (NiCo2S4) that acts as an HER electrocatalyst, whereas the obtained electrons are utilized in electrochemical water reduction. The suggested heterostructure has a lower standard Gibbs free energy than a bare Si surface, favouring the hydrogen evolution reaction under solar light. Moreover, the overall result demonstrates the possible pathway of photon-induced charge separation and migration on the heterostructure surface under light irradiation, as illustrated in Fig. 8c and d. Owing to increased electrical conductivity and a reduced charge carrier recombination rate, the subsequent photogenerated electrons are easily transferred from Si to NiCo2S4 and injected into the surface of the catalyst layer for the solar water reduction process. As a result, the bi-metallic HER co-catalyst (NiCo2S4) effectively accelerates electron transfer to the photoelectrode surface and exhibits excellent surface HER activity sites, resulting in exceptional PEC water reduction performance.
Conclusion
In summary, cost-effective bimetallic sulphide as an HER electrocatalyst and vertical standing nanowires are interfaced successfully using wet etching and the SILAR technique. The optimized Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS (1D/2D) multidimensional photocathode enables superior photocatalytic performance in acidic media under simulated 1 sun solar illumination. Moreover, the heterostructure photocathode produces a maximum photocurrent density of 15 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V vs. RHE. The improved PEC performance of the heterostructure is mainly attributed to the effective improvement of the HER catalytic active site, photon-induced charge carrier separation and migration density with prolonged lifetime at the Si NW/NiCo2S4 NS/electrolyte interface, as evidenced by EIS measurement. Moreover, the obtained experimental results correlated well with the density functional theory calculations, confirming and validating our findings, such as improved charge separation/migration and catalytic active interface sites. Thus, this study offers a new strategy that emphasizes the impact of the bimetallic sulphide layer structure as an HER electrocatalyst on the photoactive semiconductor surface to enhance PEC hydrogen evolution, leading to the next generation of solar hydrogen energy conversion systems.
