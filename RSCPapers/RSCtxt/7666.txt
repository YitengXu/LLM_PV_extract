    , Accepted 19th June 2013First published on 5th July 2013AbstractThe synthesis of new π-conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers containing tetraaryl-diketopyrrolo[3,2-b]-pyrrole (isoDPP) as the building block is described. Polymers were prepared upon palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling of 3,6-bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)-1,4-diphenyl-pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole-2,5-dione (M1) with 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (M2) or (4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (M3). The polymers exhibit low band gaps of 1.53 and 1.67 eV, broad absorption bands with maxima of 523 nm and 620 nm, and high extinction coefficients of 6.5 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1, and 2.6 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1, respectively. Low fluorescence quantum yields between 0.13% and 0.82% were detected. Quantum chemical calculations indicated a nearly planar backbone with highly delocalized HOMO orbitals and localization of the LUMO electrons at the thienyl-isoDPP units. The X-ray structure analysis of M1 indicated a dihedral angle of 14.1° between the thienyl groups and the isoDPP core, and a 76.6° dihedral angle of the lactam phenyl group and the isoDPP core, the latter preventing any π-stacking of the monomers. The polymers show high glass transitions (Tg) and excellent thermal stability. Photoirradiation studies indicate that the polymers are extremely stable to UV and visible light in solution. Spectroelectrochemical studies indicated a reversible electrochromism with isosbestic point near 710 nm.
Introduction
Increasing energy consumption and the rising costs for energy are driving forces to develop new technologies for harvesting solar energy. Polymer solar cells have attracted considerable attention due to their low-cost manufacture and large-area production through solution processing.1–3 In recent years, extensive research efforts have been made to enhance the power conversion efficiency while until now, the photovoltaic levels of polymer-based devices have not met commercial requirements for application. The non-ideal results were considered to be mainly related to poor hole mobility, spectral mismatch between the polymer absorption and the terrestrial solar spectra, and short life times of the devices.4,5 In order to prepare a long life time device, it is necessary to use a polymer with excellent thermal stability and photostability. In order to enhance the hole mobility and the absorption of sunlight, and to obtain broader spectra of polymers, the most powerful strategy is to introduce internal D–A structures by incorporating electron-rich and electron-deficient segments in the polymer backbone.6–8
Many kinds of electron-rich building blocks containing thiophene derivatives have been proven to be particularly useful, among them being dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as fused-ring thiophene donor building blocks. They have attracted much attention in the past few years due to their strong donor ability and large planar conjugated structure, which favor a high charge carrier mobility.9 Furthermore, the 4-position of DTS has been replaced with a silicon atom which might induce a low-lying LUMO and low band gap in the polymers due to the effective orbital mixing of the Si–π* orbital with the π* orbital of the butadiene fragment.9b,10 Chu et al. synthesized D–A copolymers with DTS as the donor which gave a PCE up to 7.3%, while Hou et al. reported BDT D–A copolymers with a high PCE of 7.40%.11,12
Diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) represents a key structural unit in an important class of red pigments with deep color, which were commercialized in the 1980s.13 It was shown that DPP-containing polymers exhibit good light-emitting and photovoltaic properties. IsoDPP is a regioisomer of DPP, which can be prepared efficiently upon condensation of two equivalents of ethyl arylacetates with one equivalent of oxalic acid bis(arylimidoyl) dichloride.14 Until now, only a few monomers based on isoDPP have been reported, and only a few reports have been published on polymers based on isoDPP.15 Some examples of deeply colored copolymers containing tetraaryl-isoDPP in the main chain have been synthesized by Welterlich et al., which exhibit absorption maxima at only 439 and 489 nm in solution. Song et al. reported on polymers containing dithienyl-isoDPP units, which exhibit absorption maxima around 548 nm.16
In this article, we report on two new polymers consisting of isoDPP as the electron accepting unit, and DTS or BDT with large planar conjugated structure as the electron-donating building block. The polymers of the D–A type, P-IsoDPP-DTS and P-IsoDPP-BDT were synthesized upon palladium-catalyzed Stille reactions of M1 with 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (M2) or (4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethyl-stannane) (M3) (Scheme 1). The key compounds were investigated using spectroscopic methods (NMR, UV/vis, fluorescence), cyclic voltammetry, TGA, DSC, X-ray diffraction and quantum chemical calculations (B3LYP/6-31G*) by GAMESS.17 In addition, studies on the photostability of polymers in solution upon UV and visible light irradiation are described, and a spectroelectrochemical study of anodic oxidation of P-IsoDPP-DTS is presented.

Experimental section
Materials

Reagents. Monomer M1 was prepared according to literature methods.15M2 and M3 were obtained from Zhongsheng Huateng company without further purification.

Polymer

P-IsoDPP-DTS
. In a Schlenk flask, M1 (0.2 g, 0.26 mmol), M2 (0.19 g, 0.26 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (12.3 mg, 0.01 mmol) were dissolved in dry DMF (10 mL). Then the mixture was heated and kept at 100 °C under nitrogen for 18 hours. Then the reactant was cooled to room temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by adding 50 mL methanol, filtered, and then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol and hexane. The polymer was dried under vacuum for 1 day and was obtained as dark solid (0.17 g, yield: 64%). Molecular weight (GPC, THF): Mw = 14.8 kDa, Mn = 8.5 kDa, and PDI = 1.74. 1H-NMR (300 MHz, d1-CHCl3) δ ppm: 7.25–7.41 (br, 6H), 6.63–7.17 (br, 4H), 2.65–2.76 (br, 4H), 1.69 (s, 4H), 1.35 (s, 2H), 1.15–1.20 (br, 16H), 0.70–0.98 (br, 18H). UV/vis (DCM): 587 nm; ε (587) = 64887 L mol−1 cm−1. PL (DCM): 744 nm (excitation at 450 nm); PL quantum yield Φf: 0.13%.

Polymer

P-IsoDPP-BDT
. The synthesis was carried out as described for P-IsoDPP-DTS except that M3 instead of M2 was used as the monomer. A dark solid was obtained (0.18 g, yield: 62%). Molecular weight (GPC, THF): Mw = 5.7 kDa, Mn = 3.8 kDa, and PDI = 1.50. 1H-NMR (300 MHz, d1-CHCl3) δ ppm: 7.25–7.70 (br, 6H), 6.61–7.12 (br, 4H), 3.69–3.79 (m, 4H), 2.65–2.76 (br, 4H), 1.61–1.77 (br, 2H), 1.19–1.47 (br, 16H), 0.87–1.08 (br, 18H). UV/vis (DCM): 502 nm; ε (502) = 26485 L mol−1 cm−1. PL (DCM): 680 nm (excitation at 450 nm); PL quantum yield Φf: 0. 82%.
Methods

Instrumentation. UV/vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 14 spectrometer. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrometer. Photoluminescence quantum yields of the polymers were measured in dichloromethane. The values were calculated by comparing with Rhodamine 6G in ethanol (Φf = 0.95). The photostability was recorded using a 200 W Hg lamp (Oriel Instruments 6283) at a distance of 20 cm. Care was taken that the polymer solution was not heated during light exposure. The polymer concentration in solution was 50 mg L−1. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker DPX 300 spectrometer, which operates at 300 MHz. Molecular weights were determined upon gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Waters 1515 HPLC) equipped with Styragel columns. All measurements were carried out in tetrahydrofuran at 45 °C. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using a potentiostat PG 390 from Heka Company. The thin films of the polymers were cast on an ITO electrode and cycled in acetonitrile (saturated with nitrogen) containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the electrolyte salt. Reference and counter electrodes were platinum. The voltage data were calculated for the standard calomel electrode (SCE). Scan rate: 100 mV s−1; temperature: 20 °C. Structures, and HOMOs and LUMOs were obtained using GAMESS.17 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL min−1) using a NETZSCH 204F1 and a NETZSCH 209F1. DSC and TGA traces were determined at heating rates of 10 °C min−1 (DSC) and 20 °C min−1 (TGA), respectively. The single crystal structure of M1 was determined with a Nonius Kappa CCD-Diffractometer Mo-Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) controlled by COLLECT (Nonius). The structure was solved using Shelx197 and refined by Shelx197.
Results and discussion
The two polymers were prepared by Stille coupling of M1 and M2 (P-IsoDPP-DTS), and M1 and M3 (P-IsoDPP-BDT), the yields being 62–64% (Scheme 1). P-IsoDPP-DTS shows excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as toluene, dichlorobenzene and tetrahydrofuran, while P-IsoDPP-BDT is only moderately soluble in dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide and dichloromethane. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of the polymers are 14.8 kDa (P-IsoDPP-DTS) and 5.7 kDa (P-IsoDPP-BDT) and the polydispersity indices (PDI) are 1.7 (P-IsoDPP-DTS) and 1.5 (P-IsoDPP-BDT), respectively. The molecular structures were analyzed using 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1). The chemical shifts at about 0.80–2.76 ppm are typical for the protons of the alkyl group, while the broad signal with a chemical shift at about 6.60–7.70 ppm originates from the protons of phenyl and thiophene groups. The signals at around 3.69–3.79 ppm can be ascribed to the protons of the methylene group attached to the oxygen of the BDT unit.

Crystal structure of M1
Single crystals of M1 were prepared with 0.2 × 0.1 × 0.03 mm size from benzene solution and the crystal structure was determined by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2). The unit cell with two molecules was found to be monoclinic with a P21/c space group and the crystallographic center of symmetry being located at the midpoint of C17 and C17a. The core of isoDPP is fully coplanar, which ensures full conjugation. There is a 14.3° dihedral angle between the thiophene units and the isoDPP core, which is 4.4° larger than the torsional angle between the thiophene units and the N-terminal hexyl chain of thienyl-DPP.18 This indicates that thienyl-isoDPP is less coplanar than thienyl-DPP. The dihedral angle between the lactam phenyl ring and the isoDPP core is 76.6°. The bond lengths from C2 to C3 to C4 to N1 to C17a to C17 were found to be 1.448, 1.492, 1.411, 1.386 and 1.446 Å. Due to the large distance of adjacent isoDPP cores of 6.969 Å, a direct π–π interaction can be ruled out. In DPP the relevant distance is only 3.614 Å causing strong π–π interactions.18

Optical properties
In Fig. 3, the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of the polymers and the UV-vis absorption spectrum of M1 in dichloromethane are shown. The polymer solutions are deeply colored. The extinction coefficients of the strongest bands are 64877 L mol−1 cm−1 for P-IsoDPP-DTS, and 26485 L mol−1 cm−1 for P-IsoDPP-BDT, respectively. P-IsoDPP-DTS forms a blue solution with absorption maximum at 587 nm, while the solution of P-IsoDPP-BDT is purple, the main absorption of the π-conjugated backbone occurring at 509 nm. Compared with monomer M1, the absorption of P-IsoDPP-DTS is red-shifted by 151 nm, while the red-shift of P-IsoDPP-BDT is 73 nm. The red-shift originates from the extended π-conjugation of the backbone and, in addition, can be ascribed to D–A interactions between the dithienyl-DTS or dithienyl-BDT units and the adjacent isoDPP core (without the two thienyl groups) giving rise to an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The absorption maxima of P-IsoDPP-BDT and P-IsoDPP-DTS are 30 and 98 nm red-shifted compared with the copolymer synthesized by Welterlich et al., which contained thienyl comonomer units instead of BDT or DTS. The red shift can be ascribed to a stronger D–A character originating from the DTS and BDT units. In addition, the higher molecular weight, which induces a longer π–π*-conjugated system, may also play a role. Furthermore, the large planar conjugated structure and the silicon atom of the DTS unit provide the polymer with a low-lying LUMO and a low band gap due to the effective orbital mixing of the Si–π* orbital with the π* orbital of the butadiene fragment.9b,10 The two polymers exhibit a weak fluorescence with maxima at 744 nm for P-IsoDPP-DTS, and 660 nm for P-IsoDPP-BDT, respectively (Fig. 3). The fluorescence quantum yields are very low (0.13% for P-IsoDPP-DTS and 0.82% for P-IsoDPP-BDT) resulting in unsmooth fluorescence spectra in dichloromethane solution.
 Fig. 3  UV/vis absorption and emission spectra of polymers and M1 in dichloromethane solution (left) and UV/vis absorption spectra of polymers in thin films (right). 
UV/vis absorption spectra of the polymer films are very broad and red-shifted (33 nm for P-IsoDPP-DTS and 14 nm for P-IsoDPP-BDT) compared with the solution spectra. The long-wavelength tail of the absorption bands is extended to the infrared region. This indicates a gain of planar conformation, whereas a gain of π–π interchain association seems unlikely because of the strong tilt of the phenyl units of isoDPP shown by the structure analysis. The polymers' absorption bands are very broad ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm, which might be advantageous for solar cell applications, since the absorption is extended to the region where the solar photon flux is most intense (that is in the 600–800 nm range).19 The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) calculated from the absorption edges of the P-IsoDPP-DTS and P-IsoDPP-BDT films are 1.42 eV and 1.39 eV, respectively. The photophysical data are summarized in Table 1.

In order to investigate the photostability of the polymers, we used a 200 W Hg lamp (Oriel Instruments 6283) and irradiated P-IsoDPP-DTS and P-IsoDPP-BDT in toluene, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the absorption maxima of P-IsoDPP-DTS and P-IsoDPP-BDT are only slightly diminished after irradiation for 60 min. This indicates that P-IsoDPP-DTS and P-IsoDPP-BDT are very stable in UV-light, and more stable than DPP/DTPP-based polymers.20

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the two polymers were investigated using cyclic voltammetry. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were estimated from the onset of the oxidation and reduction curves, respectively (see Fig. 5 and Table 2). P-IsoDPP-BDT shows a single broad and irreversible oxidative peak with maximum at +0.71 V and a quasi-reversible reduction peak at −1.74 V which is reverted at −1.54 V. Anodic oxidation of P-IsoDPP-DTS takes place at a low potential of 0.35 V, and further peaks appear at 0.58 and 1.08 V. The oxidation behavior is irreversible. The cathodic wave sets in at a potential of −1.43 V.

From the onset of anodic and cathodic waves HOMO and LUMO values as well as electrochemical bandgaps (Eecg) were calculated. As shown in Table 2, the Eecg of P-IsoDPP-DTS is 0.17 eV smaller than for P-IsoDPP-BDT since the silicon atom of DTS might cause a low-lying LUMO and a low band gap in the polymer due to the effective orbital mixing of the Si–π* orbital with the π* orbital of the butadiene fragment.9b,10 The electrochemical bandgaps are slightly larger than the optical ones due to the interfacial barrier for charge injection.21
Theoretical calculation
For a better understanding of the electronic structures of the polymers, quantum chemistry calculations by the density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G*) method were performed. In order to make computation possible, we chose repeating units with methyl instead of 2-ethylhexyl substituents as simplified models. The optimized structures reveal that there are 19.1° (P-IsoDPP-DTS) and 18.9° (P-IsoDPP-BDT) dihedral angles between the thiophene units and the isoDPP core. This is about 4.5° larger than the dihedral angles determined from the crystal structure analysis. The dihedral angles between the thienyl-isoDPP and DTS or BDT units are 20.8° and 16.1° for the model compounds of P-IsoDPP-DTS and P-IsoDPP-BDT, respectively. It seems that P-IsoDPP-BDT is more planar than P-IsoDPP-DTS. This is surprising, because the absorption maximum of P-IsoDPP-DTS is more red-shifted than for P-IsoDPP-BDT. The reason probably is that the silicon atom of the DTS unit changes the HOMO–LUMO band gap due to the effective orbital mixing of the Si–π* orbital with the π* orbital of the butadiene fragment.
As shown in Fig. 6, we found that the LUMO orbitals of the two polymers are localized at the thienyl-isoDPP unit, while the HOMO orbitals are delocalized nearly along the conjugated backbones. This indicates that the LUMO electrons are localized at the thienyl-isoDPP units, while the HOMO electrons are delocalized along the backbone. There exists an electron transfer from the conjugated backbone to the thienyl-isoDPP unit when the polymers are excited. The phenyl groups attached to the isoDPP core make very little contribution to the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of the polymers.

Spectroelectrochemistry of P-IsoDPP-DTS
While measuring the CV diagrams it was noticed that the color of the polymers changed upon anodic oxidation. Therefore the electrochromic behavior was investigated with a UV-vis spectrometer at various applied potentials (Fig. 7). Because of the poor solubility of P-IsoDPP-BDT, we only investigated P-IsoDPP-DTS. P-IsoDPP-DTS was dissolved in dichloromethane (6 mg mL−1) and drop-cast on clean ITO-coated glass slides. The spectroelectrochemical study was carried out using TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte in acetonitrile solution. The neutral P-IsoDPP-DTS showed one strong intense absorption band with maximum at 620 nm originating from the π–π* transition. If the potential was increased, the absorption band diminished, and a new band at 915 nm with a long wavelength tail ranging into the infrared region appeared at an isosbestic point of about 710 nm. The new band can be ascribed to the formation of cation radicals and dications along the polymer backbone, which is similar to DPP polymers and other conjugated polymers. The experiment matches well with the occurrence of the first oxidative wave at 0.35 V seen in the CV of P-IsoDPP-DTS. At decreasing potential, the π–π* transition of the oxidized polymer film at 915 nm diminished, and the band at 620 nm increased again. The spectroelectrochemical experiment was associated with a reversible color change from blue to dark blue. Similar behavior was found for DPP-based donor acceptor polymers either containing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) or iminoarylene groups as donor compounds. For those polymers reversible color changes from 626 to 900, or 648 to 893 nm were found.22

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of the two polymers were studied using DSC and TGA (Fig. 8). From the DSC trace no melting transition is apparent in the range from 50 to 200 °C. This indicates that crystallisation (or chain aggregation) of the polymer chains or alkyl side groups does not occur. High Tg values are observed for P-IsoDPP-DTS at 153.2 °C and for P-IsoDPP-BDT at 143.5 °C, respectively. The high Tg values can be ascribed to the hairy rod structure of the backbone with strongly reduced segmental mobility. TGA analysis shows that the copolymers exhibit excellent thermal stability with 5% weight loss occurring for P-IsoDPP-DTS at 378 °C, and for P-IsoDPP-BDT at 341 °C, respectively. P-IsoDPP-DTS is more stable than P-IsoDPP-BDT since the molecular weight of P-IsoDPP-BDT is much lower. The high value of Tg and the excellent thermal stability, which should prevent morphological changes and suppress the formation of aggregates, are desirable for potential optoelectronic applications of the polymers.

Conclusions
Two new polymers consisting of isoDPP and BDT or DTS units were prepared using established palladium-catalyzed Stille-coupling. It was found that the absorption of the polymers is considerably red-shifted (30 nm for P-IsoDPP-BDT and 98 nm for P-IsoDPP-DTS) compared with previously synthesized isoDPP-based polymers containing 2,5-thienylene comonomer units instead of DTS or BDT.15 Long-wavelength absorption of π-conjugated polymers may originate from a high planarity of the π-system, a high molecular weight giving rise to a long and extended π-system, π–π-interactions between adjacent chains, or charge-transfer interactions within the backbone and between adjacent chains. In addition, oxidation or reduction of the backbone with formation of cations, anions and/or radicals may also cause a red-shift. The theoretical calculation indicates that the π-plane of the isoDPP core, the adjacent thienyl group, and the BDT or DTS comonomer units are tilted to each other by only a few degrees so that the polymer chains are highly planar and the HOMO orbitals are delocalized along the backbone. The LUMO orbitals, however, are mainly localized at the thienyl-isoDPP core unit so that the excitation of the polymers causes a strong electron transfer from the backbone to the thienyl-isoDPP core (acceptor) units. The crystal structure analysis of M1 confirms the low tilt between the thienyl and isoDPP units, but shows a very strong tilt of the N-phenyl groups by about 76°. If this is also true for the polymer, π–π interactions between adjacent isoDPP units and also between adjacent polymer chains become highly unlikely. Thus the red-shifted absorption of P-IsoDPP-DTS and P-IsoDPP-BDT are mainly due to the high planarity of the backbone, and donor–acceptor interactions along the chains. The difference in the red-shift of P-IsoDPP-DTS and P-IsoDPP-BDT has two origins. First, the DTS unit provides P-IsoDPP-DTS with a low-lying LUMO and a low band gap due to effective mixing of the Si–π* orbital with the π* orbital of the butadiene fragment,9b,10 and second, the BDT-containing polymer has a low molecular weight with less extended π-system. Further red-shift of the absorption may be possible, if a higher molecular weight can be obtained, and if the N-phenyl units of isoDPP are replaced by N-alkyl chains. This would improve π-stacking of the chromophores and lower the band gap. A corresponding study has been reported recently, which confirms our assumption. However, it turned out that N-alkylated isoDPPs are difficult to synthesize, and the yields are very low (10 to 23%).23 Our studies also indicate that a red-shift of the absorption can also be reached upon oxidation of the polymer backbone. The effect is reversible and indicates the electrochromic properties of the polymers.
In summary, the polymers exhibit high Tg, excellent thermo- and photostability, broad and intense absorption with maxima between 523 nm and 620 nm, absorption coefficients up to 64887 and 26485 L mol−1 cm−1, and small band gaps of 1.53 eV and 1.67 eV, respectively. This renders the polymers interesting for optoelectronic applications, for example in solar cells.
