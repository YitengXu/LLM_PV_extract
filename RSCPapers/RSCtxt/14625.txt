    , Accepted 11th May 2016First published on 12th May 2016AbstractNano-carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphene oxide) have potential application for photovoltaics because of their excellent optical and electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that a single-walled carbon nanotubes/graphene oxide buffer layer greatly improves the photovoltaic performance of organo-lead iodide perovskite solar cells. The carbon nanotubes/graphene oxide buffer layer works as an efficient hole transport/electron blocking layer. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 13.3% was achieved in the organo-lead iodide perovskite solar cell due to the complementary properties of carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide. Furthermore, the great improvement of photovoltaic performance stability in the perovskite solar cells using carbon nanotubes/graphene oxide/polymethyl methacrylate was demonstrated in comparison with that using a typical organic hole transport layer of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene.
Introduction
Studies of solar cells based on organo-lead halide perovskites CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have been attracting much interest.1–3 Organo-lead halide perovskites with a direct bandgap play important roles in solar cells not only as strong light harvesters, but also as efficient carrier conductors because of their large absorption coefficients and high charge carrier mobilities.4–6 Perovskite solar cells constructed of mesoporous scaffolds, perovskite light absorbers (such as CH3NH3PbI3), and organic hole transport layers have exhibited outstanding performance to date and are leading to revolutionary research on photovoltaic devices.7–10 Continuous improvement and engineering of interfaces,2 solvents,11 and materials12 during the past five-years have led to a significant increase in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells from the first reported value of 3.8 to >20%.13,14 However, there remain many issues to solve such as instabilities of both perovskite and organic transport layers in the atmosphere toward the realistic application of organo-lead halide perovskite solar cells.3,15
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are excellent candidates as charge transporting materials in optoelectronic devices due to their high conductivity, and chemical stability.16–18 In photovoltaic applications, carbon nanotubes have been extensively studied as dopants and scaffolds for organic19–22 Si heterojunctions,23–25 and sensitized solar cells.26–28 Studies of carbon nanotubes as electrodes, hole transport layers, and dopants in perovskite solar cells have also been reported.29–31 However, shunt current leakage can occur in porous SWNT networks due to the conduction band (CB) bottom of semiconducting SWNTs (∼−4.1 eV from vacuum level) being lower than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (∼−3.9 eV), which can lead to large photovoltaic losses due to carrier recombination between carbon nanotubes and Au anode. Such recombination losses greatly reduce the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc), thus limiting the application of SWNTs in solar cells. To improve performance, an electron-blocking material must be introduced as a barrier layer. Graphene oxide (GO) is one among many environmentally friendly and solvent-dissoluble electron-blocking layers.32 Therefore, it is anticipated that a combination of SWNTs with efficient carrier transport abilities and GO with a strong electron-blocking capability should function as an efficient carrier-transport layer for organo-lead iodide perovskite solar cells. Moreover, a polymer such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) with high stability, and mechanical flexibility, is expected to form a compact layer with these nano-carbon materials (SWNTs and GO) by strongly crosslinking to protect the perovskite layer from oxygen and moisture.
Herein, we report the application of a SWNT/GO/PMMA thin film as a hole conductive protecting layer in perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells. The application of nano-carbon materials (SWNT/GO) as efficient selective carrier-transport layers greatly enhances the PCEs of perovskite solar cells. The PCE of perovskite solar cells fabricated by the sequential deposition method drastically increased from 3.3% in a cell without a SWNT/GO/PMMA layer to 11.0% in a cell with a SWNT/GO/PMMA layer under Air Mass (AM) 1.5 conditions. The PCE was improved to 13.3% in the perovskite solar cell with SWNT/GO/PMMA fabricated by the one step method. Moreover, the stability in air of the PCE of a perovskite solar cell containing a SWNT/GO/PMMA layer was greater than that of a perovskite solar cell with a typical organic hole-transport layer of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the device architecture of the CH3NH3PbI3/SWNT/GO/PMMA solar cells used in this study. The organo-lead iodide perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3) were fabricated on compact TiO2 layers via the standard method described in the Experimental section. The SWNT thin film (see Fig. S1, ESI†), which had a transmission of approximately 70% at a wavelength of 550 nm, was then transferred to the perovskite layer. Next, the GO modified by octadecylamine (ODA) was spin-coated on the SWNT film to construct the SWNT/GO layer. Note that GO penetrates into the SWNT network to form a composite structure of SWNT/GO. Finally, PMMA was spin-coated on the SWNT/GO layer to maintain the environmental stability of the device. The SWNT/GO/PMMA layer has a composite structure and the SWNT network retains contact with an electrode even in a thicker PMMA layer with a thickness of 100 nm, as shown in SEM images (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Fig. 1b and c show a top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the SWNT thin film and a cross-sectional SEM image of the solar cell device, respectively. The SWNT film exhibits a spider web-like structure consisting of interconnected nanotube bundles with diameters ranging from several to tens of nanometers. The typical thicknesses of the compact TiO2, mesoporous TiO2, and CH3NH3PbI3 layers are approximately 25, 200, and 300 nm, while those of the SWNT/GO and PMMA layers are approximately 15 and 100 nm, respectively.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of a perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA solar cell with illumination from the FTO side under Air Mass 1.5 conditions are shown in Fig. 2a. The J–V curve of the solar cell exhibits a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.9 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.02 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.60, resulting in a PCE (η) of 11.0%. Variation in the photovoltaic performance of 25 perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA solar cells was also investigated. The inset in Fig. 2a shows a histogram of the PCE values, which varies only slightly in the range of 9.2% to 11.7% and has an average value of 10.5 ± 0.8%.

Fig. 2b shows the spectrum of the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) for a perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA solar cell. The IPCE response from ∼300 to ∼780 nm suggests that the perovskite layer plays a role in both solar light absorption and photocarrier generation in the solar cell,1 while the SWNT/GO layer mainly functions as an efficient carrier dissociation, collection, and transport layer. This is also supported by the absorption spectra for perovskite and perovskite/SWNT/GO (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The integrated current is also calculated using the overlap between the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum and the AM 1.5 G solar photon flux for the cell. Note that the calculated integrated photocurrent yield for the current density is 17.3 mA cm−2, which is consistent with that of the photocurrent density (17.9 mA cm−2) determined from the J–V curve in Fig. 2a.
The GO layer plays an important role in improving the photovoltaic properties of the cell. The J–V curves of perovskite solar cells without a hole-transport layer and with SWNTs, SWNT/GO, and SWNT/GO/PMMA layers are investigated to understand the roles of each layer, as shown in Fig. 3. The perovskite solar cell directly in contact with the Au anode, denoted as free in Fig. 3, exhibits a PCE of 3.3% due to low Jsc and Voc values (Table 1), which mainly result from large recombination losses at the interface of the perovskite layer and the anode and the low built-in voltage.4 The SWNT layer serves to assist photogenerated carrier extraction/transport and separates the perovskite layer from the anode. Therefore, after insertion of the SWNT layer, the PCE of the perovskite solar cell increased from 3.3 to 4.9%, a 50% increase which is mainly attributed to an increase in the Jsc value due to more efficient charge transport and suppression of carrier recombination. The series and shunt resistances evaluated from the J–V curve are also improved upon insertion of the SWNT layer, as shown in Table 1, suggesting that efficient hole transport and suppression of carrier recombination occurred in the cell. However, the SWNT thin layer barely separates the light absorber (CH3NH3PbI3) and the electrode (Au), and does not exhibit substantial charge carrier selectivity.33 Thus, the Jsc and Voc values are still much lower than those in organo-lead iodide perovskite solar cells with spiro-OMeTAD organic hole transport layers.

The perovskite solar cell using the bi-component SWNT/GO buffer layer exhibits a two-fold higher PCE of 9.8% compared to that of the cell with only a SWNT layer (perovskite/SWNT; Fig. 3) due to higher Jsc (19.1 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.89 V) values, which is the first report of about 10% by using SWNT/GO as a hole transport layer in organic solar cells. This experimental result implies that the built-in potential (Vbi) across the device drastically increases upon insertion of the GO layer.34 The large bandgap of a major portion of the GO (∼3 eV, see Fig. S4 in the ESI†), which is associated with the interfacial dipole moment between the SWNT/GO and perovskite active layers, may be the origin of the enhanced Vbi of the cell structure.35 The turn-on voltage of the perovskite solar cell containing GO is larger than that without GO, indicating that the built-in voltage is greatly improved by the GO layer (Fig. S5 in the ESI†).20 The large increase in the Jsc value from 10.5 to 19.1 mA cm−2 (an increase of 82%) suggests that the GO acts as an electron-blocking layer and substantially improves the carrier transport selectivity in the SWNT network. The conductivity of SWNT, GO and SWNT/GO was also checked by the four probe method. The sheet resistance of the SWNT/GO film (2.1 kΩ sq−1) is slightly larger than that of the SWNT film (1.2 kΩ sq−1), which is in agreement with the series resistance of the perovskite solar cell using SWNT/GO and SWNT films. The top PMMA layer is utilized to protect the active layer from exposure to moisture, because humidity is known to decrease the performance of perovskite solar cells.29 As can be seen in Fig. 3, the addition of the PMMA layer to the perovskite/SWNT/GO solar cell also contributes to a further increase in the PCE to 10.4% with enhancement of Voc, possibly due to a further decrease in carrier recombination losses. Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells with the GO, PMMA, and GO/PMMA layers is investigated to understand the role of these layers; the J–V curves of these solar cells are shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.†

Fig. 4a shows the energy levels of a perovskite/SWNT/GO solar cell, where the bandgaps for CH3NH3PbI3 and semiconducting SWNT films (diameter: 1.6 nm) were approximately 1.6 (ref. 36) and 0.9 eV,37 respectively. Band alignment is important for understanding the carrier dissociation process and determines the built-in field in a cell. Insertion of the SWNT layer causes an increase in the Jsc values, as shown in Fig. 3, which suggests that the SWNT functions as an efficient carrier dissociation and hole extraction layer in the band alignment. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy provides insightful information on the charge carrier extraction properties of solar cells. CH3NH3PbI3 is a highly luminescent material, thus, the quenching of its PL intensity with a hole-conducting material is used as a measure of the charge extraction ability of the perovskite layer. Fig. 4b shows the PL spectra of perovskite and perovskite/SWNT thin films (see the Experimental section for sample preparation details). The PL spectrum of the perovskite film shows an intense peak at ∼768 nm (1.61 eV), which is in good agreement with the absorbance spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). In contrast, the PL intensity of this peak in the perovskite/SWNT spectrum is drastically decreased. The large PL quenching in the perovskite/SWNT thin film suggests that the SWNT layer plays an effective role in charge carrier dissociation and extraction across the interface between the perovskite and SWNT layers. Time-resolved PL spectroscopy was performed to evaluate the crystallization of the lead-iodide perovskite layer and probe the charge dissociation assisted by the SWNT and GO layers. Fig. 4c shows the PL decay curves of just the lead-iodide perovskite film (CH3NH3PbI3), the perovskite film covered by a SWNT layer (perovskite/SWNT), and the perovskite film covered by a GO layer (perovskite/GO) under low power conditions of 1.5 μJ cm−2 with excitation at 550 nm. A single exponential PL decay of 6.1 ns in the perovskite film indicates the high crystalline quality of the samples.38 The PL decay times of 1.35 and 0.83 ns in perovskite/GO and perovskite/SWNT were evaluated using a fitting analysis for the PL decay curves. The shorter PL decay time of perovskite/SWNT compared to that in the perovskite film is consistent with the experimentally observed PL quenching in the perovskite/SWNT (Fig. 4a). The PL decay times drastically decreased in the lead-iodide perovskite covered by the SWNT thin film due to efficient charge extraction from the perovskite layer by SWNTs.

(c) PL decay profiles of perovskite (solid green line), perovskite/GO (solid blue line), and perovskite/SWNT/GO (solid red line) films. The instrumental response function (IRF) in this experiment (solid gray line) is also shown. 
Insertion of the GO layer leads to increases in the Jsc and Voc values, as shown in Fig. 3, suggesting that the GO functions as an efficient electron-blocking layer and increases the built-in potential in the band alignment. The theoretically predicted Voc maximum for perovskite solar cells has been determined to range from 1.32 to 1.34 V.39 SWNTs, which have a narrower bandgap than perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3), cannot block the electron leakage and reduce the recombination losses at the interface, and therefore, a relatively low Voc value of 0.73 V is obtained. In contrast, the much larger bandgap of GO (3 eV, see Fig. S4 in the ESI†) compared to those of the perovskite and SWNTs may enable GO to serve as an effective electron-blocking layer. The energy barrier between the perovskite and GO layer effectively limits electron diffusion, preventing carrier recombination loss at the anode and increasing the Voc (160 meV) value from 0.73 V for the control device to 0.89 V.
The photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells with SWNT/GO/PMMA and spiro-OMeTAD organic hole transport layers was then compared. Note that the organo-lead iodide perovskite used to fabricate the two cells was taken from the same production batch. Fig. 5a shows the J–V curves for the perovskite cell with spiro-OMeTAD (perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD) and the cell with the SWNT/GO protected by a PMMA layer (perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA). The perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA cell exhibits a high PCE of 11.7% (Jsc, Voc, and FF values of 20.1 mA cm−2, 0.95 V, and 0.61, respectively), as shown in Fig. 5(a), and its photovoltaic performance is comparable to that of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD cell with a PCE of 12.1% (Jsc, Voc, and FF values of 19.0 mA cm−2, 0.94 V, and 0.68, respectively). Similar PCE values for the perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD cells suggest that SWNT/GO/PMMA layers may have practical applications in perovskite solar cells, and also indicate that there is further room for improvement of the performance of perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA cells.

(b) Performance stability of the perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA (red circles) and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD (black squares) solar cells stored in air (humidity: 70–80%, temperature: 298 K) as a function of time. The stability in air was evaluated every two days for ten days. 
The stability of photovoltaic properties is an important factor in the performance of perovskite solar cells, and was thus also investigated for the perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA solar cell. Fig. 5b shows the changes in the PCE values, i.e., the stabilities of the perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD solar cells stored under moist air mass conditions (humidity: 70–80%, temperature: 298 K), as a function of time. Each solar cell was evaluated in air for ten days at two-day intervals. The PCE of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD solar cell clearly declines from 10.5% to 5.8% during the ten days. Here the PCE decay is defined by Δη = (η0 − ηt)/η0, where η0 and ηt are the PCE at the start and after ten days, respectively. The perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD solar cell exhibits significant degradation (Δη ∼45%) in performance by the tenth day in air. In contrast, the perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA cell exhibits very stable performance, with the PCE value changing only slightly from 10.5% to 10.0% by the tenth day (Δη ∼5%). This result is attributed to the PMMA layer, which functions as an effective barrier to moisture and oxygen penetration and prevents degradation of the organo-lead perovskite. In addition, the SWNT/GO layer is more stable than spiro-OMeTAD.15 The stability of the PCE performance of perovskite/SWNT/GO solar cells with different PMMA layer thicknesses was also evaluated (ESI 7†). The perovskite/SWNT/GO solar cells with thicker PMMA layers are more stable. However, their PCE values are lower due to the insulating nature of PMMA; thicker layers prevent efficient carrier transport from the perovskite layer to the anode. Importantly, though, as can be seen in Fig. 4b, both high photovoltaic performance and stability of the perovskite/SWNT/GO solar cell can be achieved by choosing an appropriate thickness for the PMMA layer. The hysteresis of the J–V curve in the perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA solar cells was also investigated (ESI 8†). The evaluated hysteric index (HI) of about 0.015 in the perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA solar cells is smaller than that (HI = 0.034) of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD solar cell, which also suggests a superior photovoltaic performance of perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA solar cells.
Moreover, the perovskite/SWNT/GO solar cell was optimized using the perovskite layer fabricated by the one-step method40 (see Active layer fabrication in Experimental section) to further improve the PCE. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves for the perovskite/SWNT/GO solar cell. The high PCE of 13.3% was demonstrated, which is one of the highest values for perovskite solar cells containing an inorganic buffer layer.41–43

Conclusions
In conclusion, the photovoltaic performance of organo-lead iodide perovskite solar cells with efficient SWNT/GO hole-transport layers was studied. A perovskite/SWNT/GO solar cell with a protecting layer of PMMA exhibited a high PCE of 13.3%, which was comparable to that of a perovskite solar cell containing a spiro-OMeTAD organic hole-transport layer. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the PCE value for perovskite/SWNT/GO/PMMA decreased only slightly compared to that of perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD under air mass conditions. With their respective efficient carrier extraction/transport and electron-blocking properties, the combination of SWNTs and GO in the perovskite solar cell contributes to a reduction in carrier recombination losses and an increase in the open-circuit voltage, resulting in a high PCE. These findings regarding the performance of SWNT/GO films as an efficient carrier transport layer shed new light on device physics and suggest that these materials have significant potential for use in optoelectronic applications.
Experimental
FTO was purchased from Asahi Glass Co., Ltd, Japan. PbI2 and mesoporous titanium oxide (PST-18NR) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd, PMMA was purchased from Sigma Aldrich Co., Ltd. Dehydrated (H2O < 8 ppm) N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 2-propanol, and chlorobenzene purchased from Wako Chemical Co., Ltd, were used after drying. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Wako Chemical Co., Ltd and used as received unless noted otherwise.
Fabrication of the SWNT network films
SWNT films were grown using the floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition method.37,44,45 CO (200 sccm) used as the carbon source was passed through a temperature-controlled cartridge containing ferrocene powder catalyst particles. Additional CO (200 sccm) and CO2 (3 sccm) were then introduced into the furnace at a growth temperature of 850 °C. The SWNT films were collected at room temperature on a membrane filter comprising cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose. The SWNT film thickness was controlled by varying the collection time.
Fabrication of the chemically modified graphene oxide solution
The chemically modified GO was prepared by following previously reported procedures.32 The GO (10 mg) and ODA (100 mg) were mixed and dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB, 5 mL) under intermittent ultrasonication at room temperature. The dispersion (3 mL) was mixed with THF (15 mL), and the resultant solution was sonicated and then centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 1 h to separate the sediment from the supernatant. The separated, functionalized GO was washed once using ethanol (10 mL) and then three times using THF (1 mL), and finally dried under vacuum at room temperature. The prepared GO flakes and the chemically modified GO with ODA were then weighed and dissolved in chlorobenzene. Fig. S11 (ESI S9†) shows the Raman spectra of the GO before and after ODA modification, confirming that no changes in the innate properties of the GO occurred during the procedure.
TiO2 layer fabrication46
A patterned and cleaned transparent conducting oxide substrate (FTO, 25 mm × 25 mm, Asahi Glass Co., Ltd, Japan) was covered with a 20–40 nm-thick TiO2 compact layer via spray pyrolysis of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in 2-propanol, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd, Japan) solution in ethanol (0.05 M) at 450 °C. Subsequently, the substrate was immersed in a solution of TiCl4 (440 μL, special grade, Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd, Japan) in 100 mL water at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by rinsing twice with distilled water. The substrate was sintered at 500 °C for 20 min. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was formed by spin-coating an ethanol suspension of a TiO2 paste (PST-18NR, particle diameter ca. 20 nm) followed by drying at 125 °C and annealing at 500 °C.
Active layer fabrication46
In an Ar-filled glovebox, a 1.0 M solution of PbI2 in DMF (70 °C) was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 substrate (slope 5 s, 6500 rpm, 5 s, slope 5 s), followed by drying at 70 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the resulting yellow film was dipped in a 0.06 M solution of CH3NH3PbI3 in 2-propanol for 40 s and then immediately annealed on a hot plate at 70 °C for 1 h. As a one-step method, in an inert gas filled glove box, a 1.1 M solution of PbI2 and CH3NH3I in DMSO was deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 by spin-coating at room temperature, and 0.5 mL of toluene was dropped on the rotating substrate. The resulted transparent film was annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min.
Hole transport layer and electrode fabrication
The SWNT film on the membrane filter was placed in direct contact with the top surface of the active layer. A fiber wiper was then applied to the substrate with adequate pressure to release the SWNT film from the membrane filter and create a connection between the film and the substrate. The prepared GO solution (5 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) and PMMA (40 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) were each subsequently and sequentially spin-coated on the substrate at a rotation speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by drying for 30 min at 70 °C. Finally, a gold layer (80 nm) was thermally deposited on the hole-transporting layer.
Characterization and measurements
The optical absorption spectra of the perovskite films were obtained using a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-4100). To perform photovoltaic testing, the devices were irradiated using a solar simulator (San-Ei Electric, XES-40S1) under AM 1.5 conditions (100 mW cm−2), and the J–V data were recorded using a source meter (Keithley, 2400) with a 2 × 2 mm2 mask. The AM 1.5 conditions for the solar simulator were confirmed using a standard cell (Bunkoukeiki, BS-500BK). The solar cells were tested without light pre-soaking and with a voltage sweep rate of 50 mV s−1. For the IPCE measurements, the devices were tested using a monochromatic xenon arc light system (Bunkoukeiki, SMO-250III). The microstructure of the SWNT film and the cross-sectional structures of the devices were characterized using SEM (JEOL, JEM-6500F).
Preparation of the samples for PL analysis
For PL analysis, a CH3NH3PbI3 thin film with a thickness of approximately 100 ± 10 nm was directly fabricated on a glass substrate using the same substrate cleaning and CH3NH3PbI3 fabrication processes as those used for the solar cells. The excitation wavelength and power density for PL spectroscopy were 550 nm and 1.5 μJ cm−2, respectively. Steady-state PL spectroscopy was performed under weak excitation power density and vacuum conditions in order to prevent degradation of the perovskite film.
