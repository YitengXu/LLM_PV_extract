    , Accepted 24th December 2016First published on 26th December 2016AbstractFerromagnetic character and biocompatible properties have become key factors for developing next-generation spintronic devices and show potential in biomedical applications. Unfortunately, the Mn-containing monolayer is not biocompatible though it has been extensively studied, and the Cr-containing monolayer is not environmental friendly, although these monolayers are ferromagnetic. Herein, we systematically investigated new types of 2D ferromagnetic monolayers Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) by means of first principles calculations together with mean field approximation based on the classical Heisenberg model. The small cleavage energy and high in-plane stiffness have been calculated to evaluate the feasibility of exfoliating the monolayers from their layered bulk phase. Spin-polarized calculations together with self-consistently determined Hubbard U were utilized to assess a strong correlation energy, which demonstrated that Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers are ferromagnetic. The calculated Curie temperatures for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 were 31, 56 and 87 K, respectively, which may be increased by external strain, or electron or hole doping. Moreover, the Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers exhibited strong visible and infrared light absorption. The biocompatibility, ferromagnetism and considerable visible and infrared light absorption render the Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers with great potential application in next-generation biocompatible spintronic and optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Ultrathin, transparent and flexible properties render two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials as promising and outstanding candidates for next-generation spintronic devices.1–3 The novel electronic, mechanical and thermal properties of graphene4–7 have inspired researchers to seek new 2D materials, particularly those that are biocompatible, ferromagnetic and with considerable visible or infrared light absorption.8,9 Magnetism is a result of corporate interaction of local magnetic moments. Since almost all of the existing pristine 2D materials are not spin polarized, it is difficult to create local magnetic moments and produce ordered magnetism.10 Biocompatible and ferromagnetic 2D materials with a high surface area ratio have attracted increasing research attention. Tumor cells could be effectively destroyed by magnetically directed drug delivery combined with an alternating magnetic field or near infrared light induced hyperthermia.8 The pivotal requirements in the potential candidate materials for these applications are ferromagnetism and biocompatibility. It is unfortunate that pristine graphene and several other 2D materials (silicone,11 BN sheets,12 MoS2, and WS213etc.) are intrinsically nonmagnetic. Although it is feasible to use a doping process for introducing magnetism into 2D systems, there are still some serious problems with the ambient conditions and synthesis processes that greatly affect the distribution of doped atoms14–17 Considering these problems, we attempted to design a pristine 2D monolayer with transition metal (TM) atoms in its own intrinsic structure that possesses ferromagnetic and biocompatible properties with considerable visible and infrared light absorption. Numerous studies have proven that Mn-containing monolayers (MnX2 (X = S, Se), Mn–CN, MnO2, etc.)18–20 and Cr-containing monolayers CrX3 (X = Cl, Br or I)8 are ferromagnetic with rather high Curie temperatures. Nevertheless, the neurotoxic Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions could cross the blood–brain barrier to enter the brain and cause permanent neurological damage;21 Cr3+ also has a toxicity rank only second to Cr6+, and it can react with acids to form Cr6+.22 In addition, no evidence has been presented to conclude that these monolayers possess considerable visible or infrared light absorption.
Herein, we systematically investigated the latent candidates of Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers. The 4d45s1 electronic configuration of Nb possesses a large atomic magnetic moment. Furthermore, the Nb ion is nontoxic, biocompatible and stable in atmosphere.23–25 Although several research groups have theoretically predicted some 2D monolayers with strong ferromagnetism,26,27 to date, no certification has been afforded to prove that these 2D monolayers can be experimentally synthesized. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, layered 2D materials with these multiple outstanding properties do not exist in nature. Herein, we exhibited that niobium halides, Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) may fill this hole. The ultimate reasons are as follows: (1) similar to graphene and MoS2,28–30 niobium halides Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) are another category of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials. It is possible to exfoliate the monolayers from their layered bulk phase. (2) The Nb ions contained in the exfoliated Nb3X8 monolayers are nontoxic and biocompatible. (3) The Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) crystals stand a good chance to exhibit ferromagnetic behavior when they are exfoliated into monolayers. We further confirmed these expectations via comprehensive first-principles calculations.
Using the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), combined with mean field approximation based on the classical Heisenberg model, the stability, electronic, magnetic and optical properties of Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) were systematically studied. The calculated cleavage energies were comparable to or even lower than that of graphite, which indicates that it is very easy to exfoliate them from the layered bulk phase. In addition, Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers could sustain free-standing planarity due to the relative high in-plane stiffness. The ferromagnetic ground state with semiconducting properties are found in 2D Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers. The Curie temperatures, estimated by mean field approximation based on the classical Heisenberg model were 31, 56 and 87 K, for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8, and Nb3I8, respectively, and might increase by external strain, or electron or hole doping. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers exhibited strong visible and infrared light absorption. These findings demonstrated that Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers are potential candidate materials for biocompatible spintronic and optoelectronic devices.
Methods
All our first principles calculations are implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP), on the basis of spin-polarized density functional theory with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)31 to the exchange–correlation potential.32 The kinetic energy cutoff of the plane wave was set to 500 eV on a Monkhorst–Pack special k-point scheme of 8 × 8 × 1 for geometry optimization and 18 × 18 × 1 k-points for band structure calculations. The self-consistent convergence accuracy was set to be 1 × 10−6 eV per atom, the maximum displacement was 1.0 × 10−3 Å, and the convergence criterion for the force between atoms was 0.03 eV Å−1. The geometry of the structure was optimized using a Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) minimizer. An adequately large 20 Å vacuum region was set to avoid any interaction among the adjacent layers along the c-axis. The charge analysis was determined using the Hirshfeld method.33 The long-range van der Waals interactions were accounted using the Grimme's DFT-D dispersion correction.34,35 It is well known that GGA function cannot adequately describe the strong correlated systems, which contained the partially filled d subshells. Herein, the on-site Coulomb repulsion of Nb 4d electrons were taken into account using the LDA + U method36,37 for comparing the energy between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states at the same calculation level. We have taken a semi-empirical parameter 2 eV of U into the calculations. It should be mentioned that we also used the hybrid (HSE06) functional38,39 to verify and confirm the spin-polarized band structure of the Nb3X8 monolayers.
To assess the thermal stability of Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with GGA-PBE functional were performed using DMol3 code. In the MD simulations, the initial configurations of Nb3X8 monolayers with 3 × 3 supercell (27 Nb atoms and 72 X atoms) were annealed at 310 K. At each temperature, the MD simulation in NVT ensemble lasted for 8 ps with a time step of 2.0 fs, and the temperature was controlled using the Massive NH method.
The optical properties were calculated with a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV, and the K point mesh was set to 10 × 10 × 1. The frequency-dependent dielectric matrices were determined by the Fermi golden rule within the dipole approximation to calculate the optical properties of the Nb3X8 monolayers. The imaginary part of the dielectric function due to the occupied and unoccupied electronic states is defined as follows:40 (1)where the delta function δ ensures the conservation of energy, the subscripts c and v denote the conduction and valance states associated with the energies Ec(K) and Ev(K), L is the vertical height between the sheets in the periodic supercell, A is the sheet area, e is charge of electron, 〈 〉 is the momentum transition matrix, and ħ and m are the Planck's constant and effective mass, respectively. The absorption coefficient can be obtained by the following formula:41 (2)
Results and discussion
Exfoliated capabilities, geometrical structures and stability
The layered transition metal halides Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) were first synthesized by Magonov et al. in 1993.42 As shown in Fig. 1(a), the bulk Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) had a boundless layered structure along the vertical direction. The interlayer adjacent vertical distance d0 was 3.104 Å for Nb3Cl8, 2.453 Å for Nb3Br8, 2.609 Å for Nb3I8, which imply a weak interaction. Thus, the 2D Nb3X8 monolayers could be exfoliated using strategies such as the microscopic exfoliation.43,44

First, we calculated the cleavage energy to inspect the exfoliating feasibility of a monolayer from the bulk phase Nb3X8. The reliability of this method was confirmed in numerous studies.17,45–48 The structure of bulk Nb3X8 (space group RM) is shown in Fig. 1(a). Herein, we calculated the cleavage energies of these structures according to the following steps: (1) introducing a fracture in the bulk; (2) stage by stage increasing the distance between the two fractured components and (3) surveying the change of the total energy. The total energy of the fractured system increased with increasing the d − d0 separation at the beginning and then it tardily converged to a certain energy value that is the ideal cleavage energy. The calculated cleavage energies were 0.18, 0.31, and 0.38 J m−2 for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8, respectively (Fig. 1(b)). All the abovementioned cleavage energies are comparable to or smaller than that of graphite (0.37 J m−2),49 demonstrating that it is easy to cleave 2D Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers from their layered bulk phases.
Afterwards, we optimized the structures of the Nb3X8 monolayers. The atomic positions and geometric configurations of Nb and X atoms in the 2D monolayers were almost the same as the bulk system, as shown in Fig. 2. The lattice constants were a0 = 6.744, 7.117 and 7.675 Å for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8, respectively. Compared with the bulk phase, the calculated lattice constants of the monolayers were slightly expanded (a0 = 6.730, 7.080 and 7.600 Å for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8, respectively), which may be caused by lowering the dimensionality; clearly, this effect was not significant for these structures.
 Fig. 2  Top and side views of the optimized geometric structures of Nb3X8 monolayers. In each Nb3X8 monolayer, the top X atoms sheet and bottom X atoms sheets are not equivalent. On the top X atoms sheet, the X(1) and X(3) atoms are contained. The bottom X atoms sheet contain the X(2) and X(3) atoms. 
We then studied the geometrical structures of Nb3X8 monolayers. In Nb3X8 (X = CI, Br or I) monolayers, the Nb atom sheet is sandwiched between the X atom sheets. In the Nb atom sheet, triangular Nb clusters were formed by the Nb atoms and therefore every Nb atom was in a distorted octahedral environment.42 The calculated lattice constants and bond lengths of Nb3X8 monolayers are comparable with those in bulk Nb3X8. Therefore, Nb3X8 sheets retain the geometries of those found in Nb3X8 crystals very well, which implies a structural rigidity of these sheets after the exfoliation process. The detailed structure parameters are listed in Table 1.

For new 2D nanosheets, the stability of structure and feasibility in experiment are recognized as rather significant features. Primarily, we evaluated the dynamic stability of the Nb3X8 monolayers by calculating their phonon spectrum and frequency DOS. In general, there were eleven atoms in a unit cell, which formed thirty-three phonon dispersion bands, as shown in Fig. 3. We can conclude that the Nb3X8 monolayers are dynamically stable because no imaginary frequency phonon was found at the discretionary wave vector.

We further performed AIMD simulations to evaluate the thermal stabilities of Nb3X8 (X = CI, Br or I) monolayers at 310 K. The snapshots of geometric structures at the end of the AIMD simulations for the Nb3X8 monolayers are presented in Fig. 4, which show that the atomic configuration of the monolayers remained nearly intact after heating for 8 picoseconds, indicating that the monolayers were thermally stable as all of them remained almost invariant during the simulation.

High in-plane stiffness is necessary for the 2D materials because we need to acquire a freestanding membrane and avoid the curling or bulking for the future experimental exfoliation process. We calculated the uniaxial strain energies in order to evaluate the in-plane stiffness of the Nb3X8 monolayers. The strain energy curves are presented in Fig. 5. The in-plane stiffness has been determined using the 2D Young's modulus, which is calculated from the strain energy curves and define as follows: (3)
 Fig. 5  Strain energies of (a) Nb3Cl8, (b) Nb3Br8 and (c) Nb3I8 monolayers under uniaxial strain. 
The uniaxial strain we calculated is in range of −4% to 4% (e = (a − a0)/a0, where a0 is the original lattice parameter and a is the lattice parameter under uniaxial strain); the strain energy is defined as Es = E(ε) − E (ε = 0), and A0 is the superficial area of the 2D monolayer surface. The entire system departed from the equilibrium state when the uniaxial strain was applied, and the energy of the system increased correspondingly (Fig. 5). The Young's moduli for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 monolayers were found to be 65.15 N m−1, 61.77 N m−1 and 45.80 N m−1, respectively. Compared with several other theoretically predicted layered materials, the in-plane stiffness of the Nb3X8 monolayers was higher than the ones of MnPSe3 (36 N m−1),17 CrX3 (X = Cl, Br or I)8 and CrGeTe3 (38.3 N m−1).50 This relatively high in-plane stiffness would capacitate the Nb3X8 monolayers to strive against their own weight and keep the planarity of the freestanding structure. Nevertheless, the in-plane stiffness of the Nb3X8 monolayers was about 14%–20% to that of the ultrastrong graphene, which suggests that the Nb3X8 monolayers are soft and flexible materials. Then, the typical out-of-plane deformation h induced by gravity could be estimated according to elastic theory as follows:51 h/L = (ρgL/Y2D)1/3(4)where ρ is the density of the Nb3X8 monolayer and g is the gravitational acceleration. For a large Nb3X8 flake with length L ≈ 100 μm, we calculated the h/L ≈ 3.3 × 10−4, 3.8 × 10−4 and 4.5 × 10−4 for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 monolayers, respectively. This implies that the Nb3X8 monolayers are strong enough and capable of forming a freestanding 2D Nb3X8 membrane. The abovementioned comprehensive simulation results of high stability, low-cleavage energy and relative high in-plane stiffness indicated that the Nb3X8 monolayers can be exfoliated from bulk Nb3X8.
Magnetic ground states and electronic structures
To identify the preferred magnetic ground state of Nb3X8 systems, the ferromagnetic (FM) and three typical antiferromagnetic (AFM) states (AFM1, AFM2 and AFM3) are considered, as shown in Fig. 6. Weperformed spin-polarized calculations to seek the magnetic ground state of the Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers. The isosurface of the spin density (ρ↓ − ρ↑) for FM Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers are shown in Fig. 7; we can clearly see that the triangular Nb clusters carried almost all of the magnetic moment, and the adjacent X (X = Cl, Br or I) atoms almost do not possess spin polarized characteristics. In the AFM state, each Nb cluster carries one spin density, regardless of the spin direction of the individual Nb atom. We deduce that the spin density of AFM state was dominated by the triangular Nb clusters of the monolayer in order to balance the whole spin density. To further confirm the most preferable magnetic coupling between the Nb ions, the corresponding energy differences between AFM and FM are listed in Table 2. The exchange energy, defined as Eex = (EAFM − EFM)/unit cell, and the largest values for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 are 3.749, 6.916, and 10.553 meV, respectively, indicating that the FM state is the ground state for the Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers. Moreover, from chloride to iodide, the ferromagnetic coupling became stronger, which may be caused by the difference in adjacent Nb–Nb distances.

To get a deeper insight into the ferromagnetic properties of Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers, the spin-polarized electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) were calculated. As shown in Fig. 8, it is clear that all Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers have semiconducting properties. The energy gaps for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 were 0.638, 0.701 and 0.459 eV, respectively. Moreover, we further calculated the band structures via hybrid HSE06 function (Fig. S1†), and the energy gaps for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 are 1.164, 1.125 and 0.758 eV, respectively. From the calculated atom projected density of states (PDOS), it is clear that the valence bands (VB) and the conduction bands (CB) near the Fermi level are mainly contributed by the Nb atoms; in addition, the X (X = Cl, Br or I) atoms slightly contribute to them. However, exfoliated products are preferred to consist a few layers rather than monolayers, as occurring in graphene and phosphorene systems. The number of layers may have a huge impact on the properties of the Nb3X8 nanosheets. To investigate the effects of the layer number on the electronic and optical properties of Nb3I8, the Nb3I8 bilayer was considered. More details are shown in Fig. S2–S4.† The results indicated that Nb3I8 bilayer also exhibits a nearly invariable band gap and considerable visible and infrared light absorption.

Estimation of Curie temperature
Curie temperature (Tc) is defined as the temperature that separates the paramagnetic phase in the magnetic moments that are randomly oriented from the ordered ferromagnetic phase. The Curie temperature of the materials can be approximated using the classical Heisenberg model, in which the Hamiltonian operator can be written as , where J1 and J2 stand for the nearest and the next-nearest exchange parameters, (i, j) and (k, l) are the nearest site pairs and the next-nearest site pairs, and mi is the magnetic moment at site i, respectively. Herein, due to the third neighbor exchange parameters being quite small and negligible, we only considered the nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions. There exist several approximations to find Tc from the ΔE value. Herein, we use the mean field approximation,52–54 which is kBTc = (2/3)ΔE, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, Tc is the Curie temperature and ΔE is the energy difference between the AFM and FM states. This approximation led to 31, 56, and 87 K Curie temperaturesfor Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 monolayers, respectively. In addition, the mean field approximation method was validated in predicting the Curie temperature of transition metal halides, and did not have a significant deviation compared to the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.48
Optical properties and characterization analysis
To investigate the performance of the Nb3X8 monolayers under light, we will discuss them based on the adsorption coefficient.55,56 The absorption coefficients with polarization vectors parallel to the layers plane for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 monolayers are shown in Fig. 9. The decay of light intensity spreading in a unit length of medium is defined as the absorption coefficient. The Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 monolayers exhibited prominent optical absorption in the visible region. Moreover, all of those monolayers have absorption peaks in infrared light region, indicating a certain amount of infrared light adsorption. It was clear that the absorption coefficient of the Nb3I8 monolayer was stronger than those of Nb3Cl8 and Nb3Br8, implying that the Nb3I8 monolayer has extraordinary light harvesting ability in the entire visible light wavelength range. Generally, the Nb3X8 monolayers absorb considerable light over the entire sunlight spectrum. If the indirect band gaps of Nb3Cl8 and Nb3Br8 could be tuned to a direct one like the that of recently investigated technetium dichalcogenides (TcX2, X = S, Se),57 they may have potential application in solar cells. The power conversion efficiencies of Nb3X8 monolayers are critically important for solar cell materials; however it still needs more investigation.58,59

We further calculated the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images in order to gain more insights into the electronic structure and surface morphology and also assist future experimental characterization. To help identify these new monolayers in experiments, STM images of all Nb3X8 were simulated at a +1.0 V bias (Fig. 10). We expect that these features of 2D Nb3X8 provide more information for identifying these monolayered 2D structures, and also accelerate the possibility to exfoliate them in the near future.

Conclusion
In this study, we executed comprehensive first principles calculations to investigate the stability, electronic, magnetic and optical properties of Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers to evaluate the feasibility of the biomedical applications of these monolayers. In contrast to previously existing structures, the Nb3X8 monolayers have the following advantages: (1) the feasibility to exfoliate Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers quite well due to their rather moderate cleavage energies that are comparable to or lower than that of graphite; (2) the in-plane stiffness of the 2D Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers are strong enough to avoid the gravity that would result in buckling or curling. Thus, these monolayers can retain their planar structure; (3) the Young's moduli were about 14%–20% to that of graphene but higher than that of MnPSe3, CrX3 (X = Cl, Br or I) and CrGeTe3; (4) all these three monolayers are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.638, 0.701 and 0.459 eV for Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8, respectively. (5) These monolayers have ferromagnetic ground states, and the Curie temperature increased in the order of Nb3Cl8 < Nb3Br8 < Nb3I8 due to the reinforced p–d exchange interactions. This temperature may be further increased by external strain, or electron or hole doping. (6) Different from the Mn-containing or Cr-containing monolayer with the toxic property, the Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers are biocompatible and environmentally friendly due to the niobium ion content. Thus, together with the ferromagnetic characterization, the Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers are potential candidates for use in future biomedical or biological devices. (7) The Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers exhibited strong visible and infrared light absorption. Therefore, based on these analyses, the unique ferromagnetic semiconducting characteristics, biocompatible properties, considerable visible and infrared light absorption render Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br or I) monolayers with great potential for the applications of next-generation biocompatible spintronic and optoelectronic devices. We are optimistic and believe that our peers will realize the potential of these monolayers and will stimulate more experimental effort in this area.
