    , Accepted 22nd March 2022First published on 22nd March 2022AbstractAn asymmetric small molecule donor, TTBT-R, incorporated with 4,5-di(2-ethylhexyl)oxybenzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as the core, was exploited for high-performance ternary organic solar cells (OSCs), and possesses a complementary absorption band and cascaded energy levels with PM6 and Y6. The ternary blend film (PM6:TTBT-R:Y6 = 0.9:0.1:1) attains the most optimized morphology with a nanofiber-like structure and small domain size as well as strong face-on molecular packing, which leads to the most balanced charge transport, highest charge mobilities and lowest charge recombination in its device. In addition, TTBT-R possesses a lower-lying HOMO energy level than PM6, which brings about higher Voc in ternary OSCs. Accordingly, the ternary OSC with 10 wt% TTBT-R achieved a PCE of 18.07% due to the comprehensively improved Voc (0.863 V), Jsc (27.38 mA cm−2), and FF (76.46%) values compared with the PM6:Y6 binary OSC. This work provides not only a small molecule with 4,5-dialkyloxybenzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as the core but also an asymmetric strategy with a non-fused structure to tune the molecular packing, energy levels and absorption spectrum of small molecules for constructing high-performance ternary OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been drawing widespread attention owing to their excellent characteristics for new energy technologies, such as flexibility, light weight and translucency.1–4 In the last several years, numerous single-junction OSCs and tandem OSCs have been reported and achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 19%.5–11 However, the development of binary OSCs is still largely limited by some shortcomings of existing active layer materials, such as narrow absorption,12,13 large energy loss,14,15 and strong charge recombination.16,17
Thankfully, ternary organic solar cells (TOSCs) provide a possibility to overcome these limitations.18 It has been well recognized that rationally selecting the third component is beneficial to extend the absorption range, improve exciton dissociation efficiency and weaken charge recombination of active layers because of the optimized phase morphology and molecular packing in ternary blend films.19–27 To this day, TOSCs constructed with two acceptors are being widely studied because of their easily tuned energy levels and small difference of miscibility between the two acceptors,28–30 some of which achieved PCE values over 18%.9,31,32 However, less attention has been paid to TOSCs constructed with two donors to achieve well-overlapped absorption bands and a more complex distribution of the guest donor in the blends,33–37 which usually presented an unsatisfactory performance before 2020. In 2020, An et al. reported TOSCs with S3 as the second polymeric donor, and their PCE was 17.53%, exceeding the PCEs of previously reported TOSCs with two donors.38 In the last several months, TOSCs based on two polymeric donors have shown a rapid development, and the TOSC based on two polymeric donors and the acceptor BTP-eC9 showed PCE values over 18%.39,40 Moreover, introducing a small molecule as another donor has been considered as a competitive strategy to construct high-efficiency TOSCs because its high crystallinity can result in favorable morphology and molecular packing.41–43 Typically, TOSCs based on the PM6:Y6 blend as the host and a small-molecule donor as the guest have been developed, and the PCE values were improved to over 17% in the past year (Table S1†).44–48 However, they hardly exceeded 18%. For example, the TOSC based on PM6:G19(10%):Y6 only showed a PCE of 17.86% though the corresponding TOSC based on D18-Cl:G19(10%):Y6 achieved a PCE over 18%.49 Therefore, exploiting new small-molecule donors is still a meaningful challenge to boost the performance of TOSCs.
Up to now, most of the small-molecule donors used in TOSCs have possessed symmetrical configurations which lead to regular molecular packing. Recently, many asymmetric non-fullerene acceptors have been reported, which possess enhanced intermolecular packing, more efficient exciton dissociation and higher charge mobilities because of their higher intermolecular binding energy and larger molecular dipole moment than the corresponding symmetrical acceptors.50–52 To understand the availability of the asymmetric design strategy for a second donor in TOSCs, an asymmetric small-molecule donor, TTBT-R (Fig. 1a), incorporating 4,5-di(2-ethylhexyl)oxybenzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as the core, undecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene and hexylthiophene as π-conjugated units and ethylrhodanine as the terminal groups, was designed and synthesized, and was used to fabricate TOSCs and study the effects of the asymmetric donor on the performance of TOSCs. TTBT-R possesses a coplanar configuration, a lower-lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level, a complementary absorption and a suitable miscibility with the PM6:Y6 blend, which help to comprehensively improve the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) values of ternary OSCs. As a result, the TOSC with 10 wt% TTBT-R obtained an exhilarating PCE of 18.07% with a Jsc of 27.38 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.863 V, and FF of 76.46%. It may be one of the highest PCEs in TOSCs based on PM6:Y6 as the host blend and a small molecule as the guest donor.

Results and discussion
The synthetic route of TTBT-R is presented in Scheme S1,† and its chemical structure was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), 1H NMR and 13C NMR with the results provided in the ESI (Fig. S1–S11).† TTBT-R presents excellent solubility in chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene, etc. Its decomposition temperature (Td, weight loss of 5%) was measured to be 358 °C according to thermogravimetric analysis in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S12†), which indicates that it possesses the necessary thermal stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G level was applied to investigate the molecular conformation of the TTBT-R backbone (Fig. S13†). It is seen that the backbone of TTBT-R nearly shows a coplanar conformation with dihedral angles of 9.1° and 1.8° for alkylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene and alkylthiophene connected with the core respectively, which is good for orderly molecular packing and crystallization.
TTBT-R exhibits strong absorbance in the 400–600 nm band with the maximum absorption peak at 531 nm in chloroform solution (Fig. S14a†), which is due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Compared with the absorption spectrum in chloroform solution, the absorption spectrum of the film is significantly broadened. The maximum absorption peak is redshifted to 539 nm, and a new shoulder peak appears at 586 nm in film (Fig. 1b and Table S2†). That is to say, TTBT-R cannot exhibit intermolecular π–π stacking in chloroform solution due to the asymmetric structure and non-fused molecular backbone, while it exhibits strong intermolecular aggregation in film because the rotation of the backbone can be restricted in film.53 According to the equation: Eoptg = 1240/λonset, the optical band gap of TTBT-R was calculated to be 1.93 eV. As shown in Fig. 1b, PM6 and Y6 display strong absorption in the 500–650 and 600–900 nm band, respectively. Obviously, TTBT-R shows complementary absorption compared with PM6 and Y6. Moreover, the TTBT-R film presents a larger absorption coefficient of 7.10 × 104 cm−1 at 539 nm than that (5.72 × 104 cm−1) of the PM6 film at 619 nm. Therefore, there will be an enhanced light harvest of the active layer in the 445–560 nm wavelength band when TTBT-R is introduced as the guest donor into the PM6:Y6 host system, which is helpful for improving Jsc values in TOSCs.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to evaluate the energy levels of TTBT-R and PM6, and the CV curves are shown in Fig. S14b.† The HOMO and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels of TTBT-R were determined to be −5.56 eV and −3.55 eV, respectively (Fig. 1c). It is seen that the LUMO energy level of TTBT-R is lower than that of PM6 (−3.46 eV) and higher than that of Y6 (−4.10 eV (ref. 54)), and the graded LUMO energy levels are good for more efficient electron transfer as well as higher Jsc in ternary OSCs. Moreover, TTBT-R possesses a lower HOMO energy level than PM6, which would be helpful for higher Voc in ternary OSCs.
Morphology is a key factor to determine the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, so it is necessary to assess the molecular compatibility between TTBT-R, PM6 and Y6, which was estimated by the melting and crystallization processes of TTBT-R in pristine and blend films. As presented in Fig. 2a and S15a,† the melting point and crystallization point of TTBT-R appear at 174.5 °C (ΔH = 32.1 J g−1) and 121.3 °C (ΔH = 1.9 J g−1), respectively. It is noticed that the melting points of TTBT-R in the TTBT-R:PM6 (w/w = 4:1) and TTBT-R:Y6 (w/w = 4:1) blends decrease to 167.8 °C (ΔH = 28.2 J g−1) and 172.4 °C (ΔH = 27.3 J g−1), respectively. At the same time, the crystallization point of TTBT-R in the TTBT-R:PM6 and TTBT-R:Y6 blends decreased to 114.9 °C (ΔH = 1.2 J g−1) and 119.3 °C (ΔH = 1.6 J g−1), respectively (Fig. S15b†). These results indicate that TTBT-R possesses better compatibility with PM6 than Y6. To further verify the above viewpoint, contact angle measurements were performed to analyze the surface tensions (γ) of the films by applying a two-solvent (water and ethylene glycol (EG)) method (Fig. 2b), and the surface tensions of PM6, Y6 and TTBT-R, determined by the Owens model, are 22.77, 27.65, and 23.61 mN m−1, respectively. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ) were calculated according to the equation to evaluate molecular miscibility55 and are listed in Table S3.† The χ value between TTBT-R and Y6 is 0.159, while the χ value between TTBT-R and PM6 is only 0.008. These results further confirm that TTBT-R possesses better molecular compatibility with PM6 than Y6.47,56 That is to say, TTBT-R would rather disperse in the donor phase than in the acceptor phase in ternary blends, which would make for more efficient exciton dissociation and less charge recombination in ternary OSCs.57

Ternary and binary OSCs with the conventional structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN58/Ag) were fabricated to assess the performance of TTBT-R, and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are illustrated in Fig. S16a.† All the OSCs were fabricated with a constant donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 and a total concentration of 12.6 mg mL−1, and TTBT-R accounts for 5%, 10%, 20%, and 50% of the total donor weight in the ternary OSCs. The photoactive layers were prepared by spin-coating chloroform solution with 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the additive (0.5 vol%), which is in accord with the optimized conditions to fabricate the PM6:Y6 binary OSCs. The TOSC devices were preliminarily optimized by adjusting the D/A weight ratios and annealing time, and the representative J–V characteristics of the optimal TOSC devices are shown in Fig. 2c and S16,† and the photovoltaic parameters are provided in Tables 1 and S4.† The results indicate that the PM6:TTBT-R:Y6 blend prepared with a weight ratio of 0.9:0.1:1 and annealed at 110 °C for 10 min shows the best performance. Compared with the PM6:Y6 binary OSC, the ternary OSCs show incremental Voc values from 0.862 V to 0.885 V when the weight ratio of the TTBT-R donor increases from 5% to 50%, which could benefit from the relatively deeper HOMO energy level of TTBT-R (−5.56 eV) than that of PM6.38 In other words, the energy losses (Eloss) of the ternary OSCs have been effectively inhibited when TTBT-R is added to the active layers.26 It is observed that the TTBT-R:Y6 binary device only displays a lower Voc of 0.670 V than a theoretically prospective Voc value, and it is highly probable that the inferior morphology could lead to serious charge recombination and low Voc in the TTBT-R:Y6 film.59 The Jsc of the PM6:Y6 binary OSC is 26.75 mA cm−2, and the Jsc values of the ternary OSCs increase to 27.15 and 27.38 mA cm−2 when the ratios of TTBT-R are 5 wt% and 10 wt%, respectively. This should be attributed to the enhanced absorption in the short wavelength band and possibly optimized morphology of ternary blend films. External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves give some proof (Fig. 2d). The ternary OSC with 10 wt% TTBT-R presents an obviously increased photoresponse between 400 and 500 nm compared with the binary device (PM6:Y6), which results in an enhanced Jsc in the ternary device. It is noticed that the Jsc values of the ternary OSCs drop to 26.59 and 23.36 mA cm−2 when the ratios of TTBT-R are 20 wt% and 50 wt%, respectively, even dropping to 1.43 mA cm−2 in the TTBT-R:Y6 binary OSC (Fig. S16a†). This result implies that too much TTBT-R in the blend film could lead to poor morphology of the active layers, which would result in low efficiency exciton dissociation, inferior charge transport and low Jsc.39 The integrated photocurrent values of the OSCs based on PM6:Y6, PM6:TTBT-R:Y6 (0.9:0.1:1) and TTBT-R:Y6 blends were calculated from the EQE spectra to be 25.95, 26.56 and 1.39 mA cm−2, which are in accord with the measured Jsc within 5% error. The FF values of the OSCs present a similar tendency to the Jsc values, and the ternary OSCs with 10 wt% TTBT-R achieved the maximum FF value of 76.46%, which is evidently higher than that of the PM6:Y6 binary OSC (73.28%). That is to say, low-content TTBT-R would contribute to better morphology and more efficient photoelectric conversion efficiency, but high-content TTBT-R would induce a negative impact on the morphology and photovoltaic performance in ternary blend films.30 As a result, ternary OSCs with 10 wt% TTBT-R achieved a PCE of 18.07%, which should be one of the highest PCE values of ternary OSCs composed of the PM6:Y6 blend as the host and a small-molecule donor as the guest.

Moreover, a series of inverted OSCs have been fabricated by using PBDB-T:ITIC, PM6:IT-4F and PM6:Y6 blends and their ternary blends as the active layers. As shown in Table S5 and Fig. S17,† all the TOSCs with 10% TTBT-R present higher Voc and Jsc values than the binary OSCs, and their PCE values are almost ten percent higher than those of the corresponding binary OSCs. That is to say, TTBT-R works well with these D/A blends and contributes to better photovoltaic performance in TOSCs.
To assess the impact of TTBT-R on the ternary system, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to explore the morphology of binary and ternary blends. It is seen that the PM6:Y6 film shows a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.23 nm (Fig. 3a), while the ternary blend film with 10 wt% TTBT-R shows a relatively smoother surface with a smaller RMS of 0.90 nm (Fig. 3b). At the same time, the ternary blend film (Fig. 3e) shows a better nanofibrous nanophase separation structure with smaller domain size in comparison with the PM6:Y6 film (Fig. 3d), which is beneficial to exciton dissociation and charge transport. Therefore, the ternary OSC with 10 wt% TTBT-R presents higher Jsc, FF and PCE values than the binary OSC (PM6:Y6). However, the TTBT-R:Y6 binary blend presents a maximum RMS value of 1.25 nm, the largest domain size and no nanofibrous structure (Fig. 3c and f), which could be mainly because a small χ value (0.159) between TTBT-R and Y6 results in low domain purity in the blend film. That is to say, the TTBT-R:Y6 blend film could possess the worst exciton dissociation and charge transport capability. Therefore, the binary OSC (TTBT-R:Y6) shows the lowest Jsc, FF and PCE values.

To further understand the effect of TTBT-R on molecular aggregation in blends, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization was carried out to investigate the molecular packing and orientation in films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and corresponding line-cuts are shown in Fig. 4, and Tables S6 and S7.† The PM6:Y6 blend film presents a strong π–π stacking peak (010) at 1.732 Å−1 (d = 3.63 Å) in the OOP (out-of-plane) direction and a lamellar stacking peak at 0.288 Å−1 (d = 21.82 Å) in the IP (in-plane) direction, which indicates that the PM6:Y6 blend film prefers a face-on molecular orientation.54 The ternary blend film with 10 wt% TTBT-R shows a stronger (010) diffraction peak at 1.732 Å−1 (d = 3.63 Å) in the OOP direction and a (100) diffraction peak at 0.299 Å−1 (d = 21.01 Å) in the IP direction. In addition, the crystalline coherent length (CCL) of the ternary blend film with 10 wt% TTBT-R is 24.76 Å for the (010) peak and 81.91 Å for the (100) peak, which are all larger than the corresponding values (24.52 Å for the (010) peak and 76.00 Å for the (100) peak) of the PM6:Y6 binary blend film. That is to say, the ternary blend film with 10 wt% TTBT-R possesses stronger and more orderly molecular packing and orientation, which leads to higher Jsc, FF and PCE values in the corresponding ternary OSC. Simultaneously, the ternary blend films with 5 wt% and 20 wt% TTBT-R show a similar and slightly lower (010) diffraction peak at 1.732 Å−1 (d = 3.63 Å) compared with the ternary blend film with 10 wt% TTBT-R (Fig. S18 and Tables S6 and S7†), so their OSCs show slightly lower photovoltaic performance than the others. Moreover, the TTBT-R:Y6 binary film presents a weak (010) peak at 1.732 Å−1 (d = 3.63 Å) and a weak (100) peak at 0.293 Å−1 (d = 21.44 Å) in both the OOP an IP directions (Fig. 4c), which indicates that molecular packing is disordered in the film, no matter π–π* stacking or lamellar stacking. Consequently, the TTBT-R:Y6 binary OSC shows very low Jsc, FF and PCE values.

To investigate the effect of introducing TTBT-R on charge transport in ternary devices, space charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements were carried out to characterize charge mobilities. The SCLC curves are shown in Fig. S19,† and the data are listed in Table S8,† respectively. The hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) of the PM6:Y6 blend are 4.78 × 10−4 and 2.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the ratio of μh to μe is 1.67. After introducing 10 wt% TTBT-R into the blend film, the μh and μe values are remarkably improved to 7.67 × 10−4 and 5.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the device shows a more balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.29. Therefore, the higher charge mobilities and smaller μh/μe ratio contribute to enhanced Jsc, FF and PCE values in the ternary OSC with 10 wt% TTBT-R.60 The charge mobilities of the ternary devices decrease when TTBT-R content further increases because of its inferior morphology and less face-on molecular packing as discussed before.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine PM6, TTBT-R and the PM6:TTBT-R films were characterized. TTBT-R and PM6 films show a strong emission peak at 655 nm and a weak emission peak at 681 nm when they are excited at 539 nm (Fig. 5a) and 619 nm (Fig. S20a†). However, the PM6:TTBT-R blend film with 10 wt% TTBT-R shows an obviously weakened PL emission originating from PM6 without the PL emission of TTBT-R, which implies that there would be an energy transfer between PM6 and TTBT-R.42 Therefore, the OSC based on PM6 and TTBT-R (PM6:TBT-R = 1:1) also shows an obvious photovoltage and a weak photocurrent density (Fig. S20b†). In addition, the PM6:Y6 binary film and the ternary blend with 10 wt% TTBT-R present almost completely quenched PL emission intensity, suggesting efficient charge transfer between the donors and Y6 in these photoactive layers.

The dependences of Voc and Jsc values on light intensity were studied to further inspect charge recombination in the OSCs. The relationship between Voc and Plight can be expressed as Voc ∝ nkT/qln(Plight) (where k, T and q are the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature and elementary charge, respectively). The n values of the PM6:Y6 binary OSC and the ternary OSC with 10 wt% TTBT-R were calculated to be 1.23 and 1.12 according to the slopes in Fig. 5b, respectively, which indicates that trap-assisted recombination in the ternary OSC is more efficiently suppressed compared with that in the binary OSC.61 The relationship between Jsc and light intensity can be described as Jsc ∝ (Plight)α. The α values of the binary and ternary devices are 0.949 and 0.991, respectively (Fig. 5c), which indicates that the ternary device exhibits less bimolecular recombination compared with the binary device.62 This is the reason that the ternary OSC possesses better charge transport and a higher FF value. The curves of Jph (photocurrent density)–Veff (effective voltage) were recorded to understand the influence of TTBT-R on the charge generation and collection process (Fig. 5d). The charge collection probability P(E,T)63 of the ternary OSCs is 0.95, which is higher than that of the PM6:Y6 binary device (0.92), indicating that the introduction of TTBT-R facilitates exciton dissociation and charge collection.53
Conclusions
An asymmetric small-molecule donor, TTBT-R, with 4,5-di(2-ethylhexyl)oxybenzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as the core has been designed and synthesized as the second donor to prepare high-performance TOSCs. The results reveal that TTBT-R presents crystallinity and better compatibility with PM6 than Y6, which lead to a better nanofibrous nanophase separation structure, smaller domain size and face-on molecular packing in the ternary blend film, more balanced charge transport, higher charge mobilities and less charge recombination in the TOSCs. Therefore, the TOSC with 10 wt% TTBT-R achieved a PCE of 18.07% because of the synchronously improved Voc (0.863 V), Jsc (27.38 mA cm−2), and FF (76.46%) compared with the PM6:Y6 binary OSC. All in all, this work provides a donor based on 4,5-di(2-ethylhexyl)oxybenzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene as the core and an asymmetric strategy with a non-fused structure to tune the molecular packing, absorption spectrum and energy levels of small-molecule donors for constructing high-performance ternary OSCs.
