    , Accepted 24th October 2012First published on 24th October 2012AbstractA novel 3D donor material (SF8TBT) based on spiro-fluorene has been developed. Compared with the corresponding 1D linear molecule, the OPVs of this 3D donor exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 4.82%, much higher than that of 1D small molecules (1.69%).
Driven by the urgent need for a next generation clean energy source, organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies, especially the blended bulk hetero-junction approach, have been developed very fast since the mid-1990s.1 When fabricated at room temperature by printing technology, OPVs exhibit several unique advantages such as fast fabrication, and in addition, they are light weight and flexible. These advantages are pushing OPVs to the leading position in low-cost flexible thin film solar cells.2 Recently, small molecule donors based on solution processes, with higher solubility than polymeric analogues, have become a competitive alternative to the conjugated polymer donor materials and these small molecule donors can be finely purified using standard organic chemistry protocols.3 Compared to narrow band gap conjugated polymers, small molecule donors have been expected to show completely reproducible properties due to their mono-disperse characteristics and lack of end-group variations. Another major advantage of small molecules over polymers is their tendency to self-assemble into ordered domains, resulting in superior levels of crystallinity and high charge-carrier mobility. The active layer in the bulk hetero-junction architecture consists of a blended film of two compounds, a donor materials and a fullerene-derived acceptor. It is increasingly evident that the active layers must fulfil very stringent morphology requirements to optimize the device performance. Specifically, ideal active layers in bulk hetero-junction solar cells require phase separation on a scale comparable to the exciton diffusion length (10–20 nm) for charge separation, as well as percolation pathways to each electrode to allow uninhibited charge transport.4 These specifications cannot easily be controlled during facile device fabrication processes, such as spin-coating and printing. To enhance the OPVs efficiency, whilst maintaining simplicity of production, several strategies have been employed to optimize the morphology in functional blends, including regulation of the solvent evaporation rate, solution concentration or material ratio during thin film formation. Particularly promising strategies, involving thermal treatment of the cast films and high boiling temperature solvent additives, have shown some success in manipulating phase separation.5 Thermal annealing can accelerate the self-assembly in the active layer and the solvent additives are understood to alter the phase separation of blends by changing the relative solubility, hence drying times of components during casting. All these efforts have been responsible for improving the morphologies of unremarkable devices based on conjugated polymer donor materials, to produce some of the most efficient systems to date.6 However, considering that small molecules have better crystalline ability than polymers, which leads to over-sized phase separation and a large amount inefficient exciton diffusion, it is extremely important to develop new technologies to optimize the phase separation in small molecular donor based OPVs, instead of apply the methods for polymer OPVs mechanically. Compared with polymers, material designs including tuning the isomer and increasing dimensionality, have unique advantages for small molecular designs for controlling the morphology in OPVs due to their precise structures.
Most of the donor materials are 1D linear structures, which rely on the intermolecular stacking and steric hindrance of side chains to push out the PCBM to a certain distance from the conjugated backbone toward favourable nanoscale phase separation. This strategy relies on influencing the complicated interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic factors, aiming to control the non-equilibrium blend morphology. Donors with 3D structures, including small molecular and dendritic macromolecular structures, have been expected to start a completely new self-assembly approach and increase the amount of stable morphologies by increasing the dimensions of the donor molecules.7 Inspired by this, a novel 3D mono disperse spiro macromolecular donor (SF8TBT, Scheme 1), which was constructed by a non-conjugated connection of two linear small molecular donors and can be purified as small molecule, has been developed in this contribution to investigate the influence of 3D structure on device performances. The resulting OPVs based on SF8TBT exhibited much higher fill factors (FFs) and short circuit current density (Jsc) than the corresponding 1D linear small molecule (LF8TBT), leading to dramatically improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 1.69% to 4.82%.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structure and ball-and-stick model of SF8TBT and LF8TBT. 
SF8TBT, a spiro-fluorene with four rigid arms, was obtained by a standard Pd-mediated Suzuki condensation reaction with a yield of 58%. The resulting material, exhibiting excellent solubility in organic solvents such as chloroform and toluene, can be easily purified by column chromatography as small molecules. The molecular weight of SF8TBT was 3060, determined by mass spectrometry, which was the same as the calculated results. LF8TBT, a 1D linear small molecule corresponding to SF8TBT, was also synthesized by a standard Pd-mediated Suzuki condensation reaction with a yield of 45%. Compared with LF8TBT, SF8TBT was expected to give high-quality films by the spin-coating technique due to its much higher molecular weight. Its straight forward synthesis procedure and variable low bandgap structures provided a possibility towards further increasing device performances. The stick-with-ball model of SF8TBT and LF8TBT are depicted in Scheme 1. SF8TBT has a spiro-fluorene centered X-shaped 3D system, fixing a cruciform arrangement of two mutually orthogonal conjugated backbones by covalent bonding. Compared with LF8TBT, SF8TBT has increased dimensionality due to the non-conjugated connection, providing a much larger intrinsic 3D character than PC71BM, which was used as the acceptor in the OPVs. No obvious melting point was observed in the DSC results when raising the temperature from RT (room temperature) to 250 °C (Fig. SI 2, ESI†). The glass transition temperatures of SF8TBT and LF8TBT were determined to be 140 °C and 110 °C, respectively.
The SF8TBT optical spectra in toluene reveal λmax = 527 nm and a spun cast film from chloroform (20 mg mL−1) exhibits a red-shifted λmax of 7.5 nm, suggesting molecular aggregation in the solid state. The absorption onset for the spun cast film is 630 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of ∼1.97 eV. Circular voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded referenced to an Ag/Ag+ (0.01 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) electrode, which was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple below the vacuum level (−4.74 eV). Estimated from the onsets of oxidation and reduction, SF8TBT showed a HOMO energy of −5.34 eV and a LUMO energy of −3.55 eV, in keeping with the calculated bandgap. The low-lying HOMO and LUMO of SF8TBT, which are the same as its corresponding conjugated polymer, provide the necessary characteristics for large open circuit voltages (Voc) in BHJ blends with the standard electron acceptor PC71BM.8 As showed in Fig. 1, the absorption spectrum of LF8TBT in toluene is almost the same as that of SF8TBT, which shows a maximum absorption at 524.5 nm. However, the maximum absorption of LF8TBT's film is 554 nm, which is 19.5 nm more red-shifted than that of SF8TBT, which can be attributed to the much stronger intermolecular stacking in LF8TBT's film (Table 1). The absorption onset for the spun cast film is 660 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of ∼1.87 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energies of LF8TBT were estimated to be −5.35 eV and −3.60 eV, respectively, agreeing with the UV calculations. According to the above results, the designed spiro-fluorene structure can be applied to optimize the intermolecular stacking of conjugated organic molecules.

When LF8TBT and PC71BM were used as the electron donor and the electron acceptor respectively, OPVs with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/LF8TBT:PC71BM(1:2)/Ca(10 nm)/Al(150 nm) were fabricated without any thermal annealing and high boiling temperature additive in the solutions. Measured under simulated solar illumination AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) with an optimized thickness of 55 nm, the resulting devices based on as-cast LF8TBT:PC71BM films showed an Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 5.49 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.32 and a PCE of 1.69% (Fig. 2a). The IPCE curves of LF8TBT exhibited a broad response covering 350–750 nm, with a monochromatic IPCE maximum of 44.6% at 511 nm, as shown in Fig. 2b. Following the same device fabrication process as LF8TBT, and with a thickness of 65 nm, the OPVs based on a SF8TBT:PC71BM (1:2, W/W) blend exhibited a maximum PCE of 3.50%, combined with an Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 6.37 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57%. Compared to that of the LF8TBT, the dramatically increased PCE of SF8TBT-based devices originated from its much better FF. The Jsc and incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the SF8TBT-based on device were also slightly higher than that of LF8TBT, which may be attributed to the slightly thicker active layer. Further optimization of SF8TBT-based devices could be achieved with a thickness of 105 nm, corresponding to an IPCE maximum of 60% at 512 nm. A PCE of 4.82% can be obtained due to the dramatically improved Jsc (8.7 mA cm−2) after increasing the active layer thickness from 65 nm to 105 nm (Fig. 2 and Table 2).

In summary, a new strategy for electron donor materials in OPVs and a 3D mono disperse macromolecule (SF8TBT) based on spiro-fluorene has been developed. Compared with the corresponding linear small molecule, the 3D spiro structure can be used to optimize intermolecular stacking of the donors in the active layers. The resulting OPVs based on solution processes exhibited dramatically higher FF than the 1D linear small molecule, as well as much larger Jsc due to the possibility of using a thicker active layer, resulting in an improved PCE from 1.69% to 4.82%.
