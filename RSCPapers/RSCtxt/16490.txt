    , Accepted 23rd November 2012First published on 23rd November 2012AbstractA series of donor–acceptor low band gap polymers composed of alternating dithienopyrrole or its derivative as donors and phthalimide or thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as acceptors (P1–P4) are synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization. All polymers show strong absorption in the visible region, for P2 and P4 possessing thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as an acceptor, their film absorption covers the region of 500–800 nm and 500–750 nm respectively, which makes them attractive as low band gap polymer solar cell (PSC) materials. With the incorporation of thiophene bridges, P3 and P4 have 0.24 and 0.21 eV higher HOMO energy levels than P1 and P2, respectively. A bandgap as low as 1.66 eV is obtained for P2. An up-scaling experiment is performed on bulk-heterojunction PSCs with an inverted device geometry fabricated on a small scale by spin coating and on a large scale using roll-to-roll (R2R) slot-die coating and screen printing. In both cases the best performing polymer is P2 with a Voc of 0.56 V, a Jsc of −12.6 mA cm−2, a FF of 40.3%, and a PCE of 2.84% for small spin coated devices, and a Voc of 0.56 V, a Jsc of −8.18 mA cm−2, a FF of 30.7%, and a PCE of 1.40% are obtained for R2R-fabricated devices with a significantly better performance than a standard P3HT/PCBM driven device.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention as one of the possible renewable energy sources of the near future, because of the possibility of manipulating properties of the polymer materials, combined with their advantages in processing, such as low cost, light weight, facile solution processibility and compatibility with flexible substrates using roll-to-roll (R2R) techniques.1–5 In the last decade, increased focus on syntheses of new polymer materials,6–8 optimization of the device fabricating conditions,9,10 and improvement of their stabilities11–14 have resulted in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 8%15–17 in small area solar cells. When it comes to scalable fabrication methods for large area PSCs, e.g. via R2R, pointing beyond the laboratory setting, a large array of techniques have been identified and explored so far by a limited number of groups.3,5,18–26 However, all but a few reports have used P3HT as a polymer donor.19–22 Thus there is a lack of common knowledge of how those new breeds of high performing materials will behave when upscaled to a R2R processing. In contrast, it has been argued that due to the inherent differences in processing, many of the achievements of small area PSCs are proven difficult to retain using R2R methods.18 In order to close this gap of knowledge, an increasing effort must be put on the testing of new promising materials in R2R fabricated PSCs. In this study we report on the process from synthesis to implementation in large area PSCs of a series of newly designed low band gap polymers. To achieve high efficiency, polymer donors should have a good solubility and miscibility with the fullerene acceptor, a relatively low energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for a high open circuit voltage (Voc), and a low band gap to efficiently absorb more photons in the near infrared region of the solar radiation.27,28 The most widely accepted strategy to lower the bandgap of the conjugated polymers is to consist alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient aromatic units along the polymer backbone.29 Among the donor units, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) has been widely used as a promising building block due to its strong electron-donating ability, good molecular planarity and ease of synthesis.30,31 In last several years, many polymers containing DTP unit were synthesized by us and several other groups,32–48 and low band gaps between 0.70 and 1.90 eV were obtained. When these polymers were used as active materials in PSCs and thin film transistors, a PCE as high as 2.80% (ref. 35) and a maximum hole mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 34) were obtained by us and McCullough, respectively. However one shortcoming of the current DTP-based low band gap polymers is their high HOMO, leading to a low Voc (0.36–0.55 V) of the PSCs. Efforts have been made in our group and Zhou et al. to overcome this shortcoming by synthesizing new donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers combining phthalimide (PDTPPH)49 and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD, PDTPTPD)43,50 as acceptor moieties, which both have a compact, symmetric and planar structure, and have been used as building blocks in polymers for PSCs52–56 and thin film transistors.57,58 As a result, high Vocs of 0.66–0.78 V were obtained. But the power conversion efficiencies of these polymer cells are still relatively low, which are 0.25–1.90%,43,49,50 probably due to the unsuited side chain structure, low molecular weight and poor solubility.
In this paper, low bandgap polymers consisting of alternating dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole as donor units and phthalimide or thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as acceptor units were re-designed and synthesized. The new polymers P1 and P2 have a more appropriate side-chain structure and much higher molecular weight to gain better absorption, higher charge mobility, and better solubility to fit the solution processibility and appropriate miscibility with PCBM. Meanwhile, another two polymers P3 and P4 with thiophene bridges between DTP-donor and phthalimide or thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione acceptor units51 were also synthesized. Compared to P1 and P2, introducing thiophene bridges improves planarity and enhances effective conjugation of the polymer backbone, which results in broader and stronger absorption, and different electronic structures. The effect of thiophene bridges on absorption, electrochemical properties, film morphology and photovoltaic properties of the copolymers was fully investigated. Finally, P1, P2 and P3 were implemented in fully roll-to-roll processed large area PSCs, reproducing the trends in the photovoltaic properties found for small area spin-coated cells, and general high performance as compared to P3HT.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The structures and synthetic route to the polymers P1–P4 are shown in Fig. 1 and Scheme 1, respectively. Compounds 1, 4 and 7 were prepared according to the literature procedure.35,55,57 Compounds 3 and 6 were synthesized by an identical approach. Dithienyl-substituted compounds 2 and 5 were prepared from 1 and 4 by means of a Stille coupling reaction with 2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)thiophene, followed by bromination of 2 and 5 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), which gave the dibrominated monomers 3 and 6 in yields of 92% and 91%. Polymers P1–P4 were synthesized via Stille cross-coupling reaction between 2,6-di(trimethyltin)-N-(1-pentylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]-pyrrole (7) and compounds 1, 4, 3 and 6, respectively. The yields were relatively high for P1–P3 (84–98%) except for P4 (13%), which can be ascribed to the poor solubility of P4 in toluene. The molecular weights of these polymers were determined by GPC with THF as an eluent and polystyrene as a standard, the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of P1–P3 are in the range of 18000–20100 g mol−1, while P4 has a relatively low Mn of 13800 g mol−1. Recently, a polymer having a similar structure to that of P4 but with different side-chains was published by Zhou et al., in which their polymer PDTP-DTTPD has better solubility but lower molecular weight.51 The thermal stability of P1–P4 was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S1,† the decomposition temperatures (1% mass loss) of these four polymers are all above 420 °C, evidencing sufficient thermal stabilities for PSC applications.

Photophysical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers P1–P4 were acquired in both solution and thin films (Fig. 2), and related data are collected in Table 1. In the solution spectra (Fig. 2a), all the polymers possess a π–π* transition in the 360–420 nm range and charge transfer (CT) transitions (between the donor–acceptor entities). It is remarkable that the CT bands of P2 and P4 split up into two and the CT band of P2 is significantly red shifted about 160 nm relative to P1 both in solution and film spectra. This can be ascribed to the higher electron affinity (EA) of the TPD moiety than the phthalimide unit, and a better coplanarity of P2 than P1, as proved by density functional theory (DFT) calculations (shown in Fig. S2†), which results in better conjugation and intramolecular charge transfer in P2 than that in P1. Then the optical bandgap of P2 is therefore 0.4 eV even lower than that of P1 (Table 1). The maximum absorption of P1 and P2 is 535 and 699 nm respectively. There are 73 nm and 95 nm red-shifts compared to PDTPPH and PDTPTPD that we had synthesized with lower molecular weights,49,50 meanwhile, P2 is red-shifted by 111 nm compared to PDTP-TPD43 synthesized by Zhou et al. When thiophene bridges were added to the DTP unit of P1, the CT band of P3 is 36 nm red-shifted and the spectrum is broadened, indicating a better conjugation. From P2 to P4, the absorption maximum exhibits a blue shift of 37 nm, but the spectrum was also broadened. P4 is red-shifted by 14 nm compared to PDTP-DTTPD in the literature.51 Moreover, a low-energy absorption shoulder of P2 indicated that a certain degree of packing has been formed even in the diluted solution.53

From solution to film, the spectra of P1, P2 and P4 exhibit little blue shifts (5–19 nm), while P3 remains the same. We suppose that the blue shifts in absorption of polymer films may originate from the aggregation of the polymer chains formed in solution which is confirmed by our further studies at an elevated temperature. The absorption maximum of P2, P3 and P4 in chlorobenzene solution at 70 °C exhibits blue shifts of 5, 6 and 13 nm, respectively, while P1 also exhibits a minor blue shift of 1 nm (Fig. S4†). The absorption edges of P1–P4 are red-shifted, implying that the polymer chains have stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state. P2 and P4 show strong absorption in the region between 500–800 nm and 500–750 nm, and they are very attractive for harvesting more solar photons. The optical bandgaps of P1–P4 in the solid state were derived from the absorption edges of the film spectra, which are 2.05, 1.66, 1.86 and 1.71 eV, respectively (Table 1).
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical characteristics of P1–P4 in thin films were studied by cyclic voltammetry. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels, together with the electrochemical band gaps (Eecg) are listed in Table 1. The experimental results have nearly the same tendency as our calculated results, which are shown in Fig. S3,† it implies that the HOMO energy levels are independent of the identity of the acceptor moiety, while the LUMO levels are mostly dependent by that. The oxidation onsets (Eonsetox) of P1 and P2 are very close (0.43 vs. 0.45 V), leading to comparable HOMO energy levels of −5.23 and −5.25 eV. While the reduction onsets (Eonsetred) of P1 are 0.32 eV higher than P2, which can be ascribed to the higher electron affinity of the TPD unit in P2 than phthalimide unit in P1. This is also evidenced by the nearly same ionization potential of P3 and P4 but higher Eonsetred of P4 than that of P3. The oxidation onsets of P3 and P4 are lower than those of P1 and P2, leading to 0.24 and 0.21 eV higher HOMO energy levels, respectively. While P3 and P1 have similar LUMO energy levels, P4 has a 0.10 eV higher LUMO energy level than P2. This is in agreement with the optical red-shifts of P3 relative to P1, caused by both the enhanced donor property and enlarged conjugating length in P3. The electrochemical bandgaps (Eecg) of P1–P4 calculated from Eonsetox and Eonsetred are 2.06, 1.76, 1.81 and 1.65 eV, respectively, which is in good agreement with their optical bandgaps.
Photovoltaic properties in small area solar cells
An initial series of small area PSCs (0.25 cm2) were fabricated in an effort to optimize the device performance with regard to polymer–fullerene ratio and active layer thickness. An inverted device geometry was chosen as it has proven to be both more stable in air as well as being compatible with the R2R processing used for the large area PSCs, which will be presented in the next section. The device structure is ITO/ZnO/polymer:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. Typical performance data of the devices with different polymer:PCBM ratios are listed in Table 2, and the corresponding current–voltage curves are illustrated in Fig. 3. The best performance was obtained at the polymer:PCBM ratio of 1:2 for all the polymers. The best device of P1 shows an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.68 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of −2.70 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 31.4%, leading to a PCE of 0.58%. The best device of P2 shows a Voc of 0.56 V, a Jsc of −12.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 40.3%, giving a PCE of 2.84%. Their performances are all much higher than those of normal geometry solar cells fabricated from two similar polymers that we have synthesized before (Table 2)49,50 and in the literature,43 especially the short circuit currents, which are twice as high as before. This improvement can be ascribed to the much higher molecular weight of the new polymers, which is one of the demanding factors for high-performance PSCs.2 High molecular weight polymers will give better absorption and higher charge carrier mobility, which usually results in high Jsc and FF. Unfortunately, the Vocs of P1 and P2 are lower than those of PDTPPH and PDTPTPD, this might be attributed to the hydroxyl groups and oxygen on the ZnO electron transport layer causing charge trapping at the interface, and also the imperfect spatial distribution of the ZnO nanoparticles over a large area on ITO, which can lead to the Voc loss.16,59,60 For P3 and P4, the performance is unexpectedly much lower than those of P1 and P2, with the best devices having PCEs of 0.39% and 0.16%, respectively. The much lower efficiency of P4 compared to PDTP-DTTPD in the literature51 is possibly due to the different device geometry, different acceptors (PC60BM vs. PC70BM) and low solubility.

Depicted in Fig. 4 are absorption spectra of the polymer/PCBM blends (1:2) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding PSCs. The photovoltaic response range of the devices is largely consistent with the absorption range of the blend, indicating that all the absorption of the polymers contributed to the photovoltaic conversion. The EQE values of P1 and P2 are noticeably higher than those of P3 and P4 in the entire absorption region (Fig. 4b). Particularly, P2 has a response over the whole visible region, at 380 nm, P2 exhibits an EQE of 48%, and the EQE is still as high as 40% at 710 nm in the near-infrared region.

It has been reported that film morphology could significantly affect the performance of PSCs.9,10 Therefore, the film morphology of polymer:PCBM (1:2) was studied in order to understand the reason for the large difference of the device performance between P1 and P3, and also P2 and P4. As shown in Fig. 5, semi-contact mode AFM studies show that the films for all the polymers have low root mean square (RMS) roughnesses, which are 2.59, 1.48, 0.83 and 2.04 nm for P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively. However, the films have very different morphologies. The film of P1:PCBM exhibits phase separation into large floating domains with a size between 0.25 and 1.5 μm, this kind of morphology is unfavorable as it results in insufficient interface area for efficient exciton separation leading to the low photocurrent.2 The domain sizes are also suggested to affect bimolecular recombinations,61 which could explain the relatively higher Voc of P1:PCBM based cells when compared with P2:PCBM based ones, which exhibits phase separation into much smaller islands scaling ∼100 nm. In contrast such a difference in Voc would not be expected to be resulted from the very similar HOMO levels. The film of P3:PCBM shows small aggregates sizing between 200 and 300 nm, while P4:PCBM presents a similar film morphology as P2:PCBM but with smaller domain size. The film morphologies of P3 and P4 are more uniform than those of P1 and P2, therefore it seems that the lateral component of the film morphology cannot explain the big difference observed in device performance. This indicates that further analysis of factors such as vertical morphology, domain intermixing and blend crystallinity would be desirable,9,61 which however remains beyond the scope of this study.

Performance of R2R coated cells
Ambient R2R processing of large area PSCs puts high demand on the chemical and morphological stability of the active materials even at elevated temperatures (<140 °C).19,22 This is one possible reason why a convincing substitute for P3HT has not been found yet. Another factor is that large material consumption is often viewed as being a prerequisite for the use of rapid R2R fabrication. However, through the use of slot-die coating that enables processing with very little loss of active material,18 we were able to fabricate close to 100 devices using less than 2 mL of active layer solution, thus demonstrating how only small amounts of polymers are sufficient to evaluate the performance of a given active material.
The devices were based on a flexible substrate (polyethyleneterephthalate, PET) pre-patterned with ITO. The device structure was the same as for the small area spin coated devices. All layers were R2R slot-die coated, apart from the Ag back electrode which was R2R screen printed. The active layers consisted of P1–P3 mixed with PCBM (1:2), while PSCs based on P4 were not fabricated because of the low synthesis yield and poor solubility. Fig. S5† shows the process of coating active layers. The experiment produced 51, 63 and 14 cells for P1, P2 and P3, respectively, alongside 83 reference cells, consisting of P3HT:PCBM (1:1). The photovoltaic performances of the devices are summarized in Fig. 6. P1, P2, P3 and P3HT show mean efficiencies of 0.30%, 1.10%, 0.10% and 0.40%, respectively. The photovoltaic data for the best devices are listed in Table 3, and the corresponding current–voltage curves are shown in Fig. 7. All in all, the trend in photovoltaic properties for the three polymers is reproduced by the R2R experiment: P2 gives cells with the highest PCE, with a maximum at 1.40%, due to its superior photocurrent (Jsc as high as 8.18 mA cm−2). This is a noteworthy result, as the Jsc of P2 is almost twice as high as compared to the P3HT reference devices which are only able to reach a Jsc of 4.62 mA cm−2. Similarly to the spin-coated devices, P1 again delivers the highest Voc, with a maximum of 0.67 V (as shown in Fig. 6), while a detrimentally low photocurrent keeps both P1 and P3 from competing with P3HT.

In summary the R2R experiment reveals a very interesting candidate for further studies, P2, which performs better than P3HT in all key photovoltaic parameters apart from the FF. Albeit a generally low performance of the P3HT reference cells is observed as compared to what has previously been achieved,5,24 this is ascribed to the nature of the PET/ITO substrate and is assumed to exert a similar effect on all devices in the R2R experiment.
Conclusions
The four low bandgap polymers, P1–P4, composed of alternating dithienopyrrole or its derivative as donors and phthalimide or thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione as acceptors, were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization and used as polymer donors in an upscaling experiment, going from small spin-coated PSCs to complete R2R fabricated large area PSCs, using only small amounts of the polymer material. Their thermal stabilities, photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties were fully characterized. All polymers exhibited decomposition temperatures beyond 420 °C, and show strong absorption in the visible region, the film absorption of P2 and P4 covers the region of 500–800 nm and 500–750 nm respectively, which is very attractive for harvesting more solar photons. With the incorporation of thiophene bridges, the absorption of P3 and P4 is broadened. A bandgap as low as 1.66 eV was obtained with P2. Small spin coated bulk-heterojunction PSCs with an inverted geometry were fabricated, with the best device performance for P2 with a Voc of 0.56 V, a Jsc of −12.6 mA cm−2, a FF of 40.3%, and a PCE of 2.84%. Large area PSCs, using P1–P3, were fabricated on a PET substrate using R2R slot-die coating and screen printing. The trends in photovoltaic properties were reproduced in the R2R experiment, with P2 yielding the highest efficiency with a maximum PCE of 1.40%, thus performing significantly better than reference devices based on P3HT.

Measurements

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer 2400 system. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were conducted on an Agilent 1260 infinity system using polystyrene as a standard and THF as an eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Netzsch STA 449C Jupiter simultaneous thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under argon flow. UV-vis absorption was recorded on a Varian 50 Bio UV-vis spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI660a electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments) using a three-electrode cell set up with 0.1 M Bu4NBF4 in acetonitrile as an electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A glassy carbon working electrode with a diameter of 1 mm, a platinum-counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ pseudo reference electrode had been applied. The potential was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+, 4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were estimated by the equations: HOMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetox), and LUMO = −(4.80 + Eonsetred). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed in semi-contact mode on a NTEGRA life instrument (NT-MDT), with an Olympus AC240TS cantilever at a resonance frequency of 140 kHz. The WSxM Program was used for image data processing.62
Small area solar cells fabrication and characterization
Small area PSCs were fabricated with the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned for 10 min subsequently with isopropanol and water before being modified by a thin layer of ZnO (∼30 nm) by spin coating of a ZnO nanoparticle solution from acetone, prepared as earlier described.63 A monolayer of C60–COOH was formed onto the ZnO according to the literature.64 Then the active layer with a thickness of 90–110 nm was prepared by spin-coating the chlorobenzene solution of the polymer and PCBM on the substrate. A PEDOT:PSS buffer layer was applied by spin coating a solution of PEDOT:PSS (Orgaconelp 5010, Agfa) diluted with isopropanol (2:1). Finally an Ag anode was deposited at a vacuum level of 4 × 10−4 Pa. The effective area of the unit cell is 0.25 cm2. The current–voltage (I–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 SourceMeter. A sulphur plasma lamp delivering an AM 1.5 G spectrum was used as the white light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a QEX10 system (PV measurements).
Roll-to-roll processed solar cells
A PET substrate was prepared with patterned ITO and a slot-die coated layer of water based ZnO solution as described in ref. 5. The active layer was then prepared by slot-die coating of the given solution (P1–P3:PCBM (1:2) or P3HT:PCBM (1:1)) at a web speed of 2 m min−1, such that each type of the active layer was covering a stripe along the roll (Fig. S5†).
A layer of PEDOT:PSS was slot-die coated using the ink described in the previous section, at a web speed of 0.6 m min−1 followed by passage through 4 meters of an oven held at 140 °C.
The back electrode was applied by screen printing of a solvent free Ag paste (Toyo UV) cured by subsequent passage under a UV lamp.
The final roll was cut into modules, containing single cells having an active area of ∼4.2 cm2, and I–V tested using the setup described in the previous section.
Finally the devices were laminated in a R2R process.5
