    , Accepted 9th February 2017First published on 9th February 2017AbstractDirect heteroarylation has emerged as a versatile and powerful tool to access π-conjugated materials through atom-economical Pd-catalyzed carbon–carbon bond forming reactions. Employing this synthetic protocol has enabled the facile evaluation of a series of organic dyes in a PDI-dye-PDI framework. Material properties are largely dictated by the PDI components, but the incorporation of either thienoisoindigo, diketopyrrolopyrrole or isoindigo has been shown to influence the ionization potential and absorption profiles of the final materials. Solution-processable organic solar cell devices were fabricated to investigate the influence of the different dye cores on photovoltaic performance when paired with the donor polymer PTB7-Th. It was found that the diketopyrrolopyrrole-based material out-performed the other organic dyes, demonstrating energy losses of less than 0.6 eV, promising efficiencies when cast from non-halogenated solvents and the ability to dictate self-assembly induced by small volume fractions of the high-boiling solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane to reach best device efficiencies of 4.1%.
Introduction
The use of solution-processable π-conjugated materials as the active component in electronic devices has proven to be a promising low-cost alternative to current commercial technologies.1–3 In particular, utilizing these types of materials in organic solar cells (OSCs) has demonstrated the potential to deliver a low-cost and scalable route to solar energy conversion.4–8 In the last few years, OSC devices have reached threshold efficiencies that support the commercial viability of this technology; however, in the pursuit of high performance active layer materials the importance of low-cost and scalable organic compounds has often been overlooked. While the development of traditional high performance materials has been crucial in identifying molecular trends and design strategies, a transition towards a simpler and more sustainable approach to this technology is crucial if OSCs are to become a practical renewable energy source.9–12
Our contribution to the development of a more sustainable approach to organic solar cells has focused on the design and synthesis of low-cost electron-deficient organic π-conjugated materials as fullerene alternatives.13–17 Fullerene derivatives18 have traditionally been used as the acceptor component in solution-processable bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs but suffer from expensive syntheses and purification to access a material with low absorption coefficients and limited structural versatility. All of which are major obstacles for commercialization. These deficiencies have stimulated the rapid growth of alternative electron-deficient materials to replace fullerenes.19–28 There exist several classes of molecular electron-deficient materials; however, perylene diimide (PDI)29,30 is arguably the most popular, and most effective, alternative. PDI-based materials are ideal for electron transport, offering a low-lying electron affinity and strong light absorption in the visible region. PDI precursor materials are low in cost with widespread availability, facilitating a scalable and sustainable synthesis of high performance materials.
Recently, our research group has reported on the synthesis and device performance of an N-annulated PDI derivative.17,31 Following the popular design strategy of high-performance PDI-based materials, two N-annulated PDI monomers were dimerized through their bay-positions to form a non-planar structure. This N-annulated PDI material was accessible from a straightforward synthesis on multi-gram scale, exhibited high solubility in a range of organic solvents, and reached efficiencies of ∼8% with a notable VOC of 1.1 V when tested in BHJ organic solar cell devices.17 To take advantage of this versatile N-annulated PDI building block we set out to target more intricate structures by introducing a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) organic dye between two N-annulated PDI building blocks through a direct heteroarylation approach. Incorporating the DPP dye into the framework influenced the self-assembly tendencies of the final material. In OSC devices employing the donor polymer PTB7-Th, efficiency increases from 2.2 to 5.6% PCE were observed upon post-deposition solvent vapour annealing.13
To expand on the design strategy of incorporating an organic dye between two N-annulated PDI building blocks we have synthesized new materials that incorporate thienoisoindigo and isoindigo organic dyes. The nature of the different organic dye cores should impart key influences on the optoelectronic properties leading to unique materials that all share the same advantages imposed by the PDI terminal units. To correlate structure–property relationships with material performance solution-processable BHJ organic solar cell devices were fabricated in an air-processed and air-tested method to coincide with the simple and sustainable approach employed in material synthesis. Through this analysis of structure–property relationships, complemented by device performance, the best dye-based structure was identified for future device optimization and material designs.
Materials design
This series of non-fullerene acceptors are based on a simple acceptor-weak acceptor–acceptor (A–A′–A) design motif (Fig. 1). To act as the weak acceptor at the core of the framework we have incorporated three different organic dyes; thienoisoindigo (TII), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), and isoindigo (ISI). These three dyes have been commonly used in the synthesis of electron deficient π-conjugated materials and each offer different characteristics desired to be imparted on their respective final materials. TII32–36 has the lowest energy absorption of the three, extending to the near-infrared (near-IR) region of the solar spectrum. DPP37–41 is the most popular dye of the series, with a reputation for favourable response to post-processing morphological changes. ISI14,15,42,43 is known for its low-cost, electron-deficient core with broad optical absorption in the visible region. The terminal acceptors that flank the dye-based molecular core are N-annulated perylene diimide (PDI) units.17 The PDI building block is well-known to be among the best molecular electron-transporting materials contributing both a strong electron-deficient character with an electron affinity (EA) of approximately 3.6 eV and strong light absorption in the 450–600 nm range.29 N-Annulation44–46 at the bay-position provides an additional alkyl side chain as a synthetic handle to influence solubility and self-assembly tendencies.

While we maintained the same PDI-dye-PDI design motif from our previous work,13 we switched from n-octyl chains to branched 2-ethylhexyl side chains in all of our three final materials to facilitate their solubility in a more inclusive range of solvents, increasing our options for solution-processing conditions.
Utilizing this framework provides a series of molecules in which the contribution of PDI to material properties remains consistent, facilitating a comparison of the different dyes and their influences on synthetic reactivity, optoelectronic properties, self-assembly tendencies and solar cell device performance.
Synthesis
Mindful of the importance of simple, efficient, and sustainable synthetic access,9–11,47,48 all of these building blocks were chosen so that the final materials could be easily assembled through direct heteroarylation couplings49–51 utilizing a silica-supported catalyst,52,53 a protocol optimized by our research group.36,54–58 When first explored, this method was utilized for small thiophene-based molecular materials, and now, employing the same conditions, we have realized much larger and more complex structures. All three final materials were synthesized by the exact same method (Fig. 1), and were isolated in appreciable yields, TII-B (61%, 0.44 g), DPP-B (74%, 0.24 g) and ISI-B (67%, 0.38 g). For full synthetic details see the ESI.† Unsurprisingly, based on the favourable reputation for direct heteroarylation couplings with DPP,59,60DPP-B was synthesized in the highest yield of the three final materials. ISI-B and TII-B were both isolated in similar yields to previously synthesized materials utilizing these cores in an analogous framework.15,36
The purification of all new compounds was carried out by column chromatography. This method proved to be effective for the removal of residual dye starting material and mono-substituted product, a common impurity resulting from the sometimes sluggish (and step-wise) nature of SiliaCat® DPP-Pd.36,54,58 Upon removal of these residual compounds with a CH2Cl2 gradient (50–100%) the final product can be eluted efficiently upon the addition of 5.0 v/v% NEt3.
All final compounds were identified by 1H, 1H–1H COSY, 13C NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Analysis of the aromatic region in the 1H NMR spectra of the three different final materials highlights the influence of introducing the PDI unit onto the dye core (Fig. 2). The PDI terminal units (aromatic peaks from 8.2–9.2 ppm) are relatively non-polarizable and do not significantly change upon coupling with the dye core. On the other hand, the increased polarizability of the respective organic dye results in noticeable movement of the aromatic protons on the thiophene bridging units (Fig. 2, labelled a and b). The aromatic protons on TII and ISI dyes are shifted downfield 0.3–0.4 ppm upon the conjugation of the PDI units. Similarly, the b proton on DPP shifts downfield 0.3 ppm; however, a much more substantial 1.8 ppm downfield shift is observed for a, indicating that DPP is the more polarizable dye of the series. Based on the reported shifts in the 1H NMR spectra it is clear the PDI terminal units are, as expected, exerting an electron-withdrawing influence on the organic dyes at the core of the framework. Further optical and electrochemical characterization of the materials will reveal whether the electron-withdrawing nature of PDI in this system is a mesomeric effect or only an inductive one.

Optical properties
The optical properties of TII-B, DPP-B, and ISI-B were characterized by solution and thin-film UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis). Solutions were prepared at 1.0 w/v% in CHCl3 and diluted for solution UV-vis (0.02 mL/4 mL), thin-films were cast from the same 1.0 w/v% CHCl3 solution at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. Optical data is summarized in Table 1.

The UV-vis profiles of all three materials display prominent contribution from the PDI terminal acceptors17 (Fig. 3A), highlighted by similar λmax in solution (532–534 nm) and in the thin-film (534–536 nm). While PDI dictates the λmax in all three materials, the nature of the dye core exerts its influence in the molar absorptivity and onset of absorption of the respective materials.

The molar absorptivities of each compound offer extinction coefficients that are greater than the PDI terminal acceptor on its own (83800 M−1 cm−1 at 534 nm). DPP-B (142100 M−1 cm−1 at 532 nm) and ISI-B (139700 M−1 cm−1 at 534 nm) exhibit a significant increase in molar absorptivity. While TII-B also displayed an increase in molar absorptivity, it is the lesser of the three (125300 M−1 cm−1 at 532 nm).
To help visualize the contribution of the different organic dyes to the thin-film optical absorption spectra, overlaid profiles of each material and their individual components are shown in Fig. 3B. In the thin-film, TII-B has a characteristic absorption band at 750 nm which leads to a λonset of 836 nm, demonstrating that the TII core has imparted its near-IR absorption into the target molecule TII-B. Introducing the DPP dye contributes to the absorption profile of DPP-B in the form of a low-energy shoulder which extends out to 770 nm, albeit with very low absorption at these wavelengths. With ISI as the core we observed the characteristic broadening of the absorption bands42 in the spectrum of ISI-B centered around the λmax (536 nm). This broadened profile offers significant contribution from 425–675 nm compared to the much sharper profiles of TII-B and DPP-B.
The fact that we do not see any absorption bands at lower energy wavelengths than the respective starting materials suggests that there is no significant extension to the π-conjugated system of either component. This supports the idea that the PDI terminal units are acting only as inductive electron-withdrawing groups. If a mesomeric electron-withdrawing effect was present a narrowing of the optical band gap would be expected as a result of the combination of molecular orbitals;61 however, the profiles are not decidedly different from their respective precursor compounds. These similarities in the final material UV-vis profiles to those of the individual components suggest that there is limited electronic communication between the core and the PDI terminal acceptors. It is therefore proposed that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is localized on the PDI terminal units and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) on the dye core, a result of inefficient π-orbital overlap.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of TII-B, DPP-B, and ISI-B were characterized by solution cyclic voltammetry (CV). Electrochemical results were collected in a three-electrode configuration with ferrocene as the internal reference. The electron affinity (EA) and ionization potential (IP) were calculated62 using a conversion factor of 4.80.63 Electrochemical data is summarized in Table 2, cyclic voltammograms including ferrocene reference can be found in the ESI.†

The cyclic voltammograms of all three compounds display three reversible reductions (Fig. 4A), all beginning at approximately −1.2 V. This reduction and the next one that follows are proposed to be attributed to the reduction of the PDI terminal acceptors, while the third reduction is anticipated to result from the reduction of the dye core. These assignments of reduction potentials are based on the overlaid cyclic voltammograms of the final materials and their individual components (Fig. 4B). In this case, the electron affinities of the final materials appear to be dictated by the PDI terminal units resulting in identical EA values of 3.6 eV regardless of the identity of the dye core. Similar trends were observed in the oxidation segment of the voltammograms, where the first one (ISI-B) or two (TII-B and DPP-B) oxidation potentials are attributed to the oxidation of the dye core, and the last oxidation assigned to the PDI terminal unit. The ionization potentials highlight the influence of the dye core on the electronic properties, IPs increase from TII-B (5.0 eV) to DPP-B (5.3 eV) to ISI-B (5.6 eV). This same trend is observed when comparing the optical and electrochemical band gaps, where TII-B is the narrowest (1.5 eV and 1.4 eV) and ISI-B is the widest (1.8 and 2.0 eV). Based on this analysis, the ionization potentials of each compound appear to be dictated by the identity of the dye core, which facilitates tailoring of the IP and band-gap in materials that utilize this framework.

The assignment of oxidation and reduction potentials correlates well with the relative intensities of the electrochemical waves where those assigned to PDI are roughly twice the size of those assigned to the dye core. Furthermore, the suggested origin of the oxidation and reduction potentials lends further evidence to the idea that the dye core and the PDI terminal acceptors are independently contributing to the optoelectronic material properties.
Computational analysis
Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out on truncated structures (i.e. all alkyl groups simplified using methyl groups) of TII-B, DPP-B, and ISI-B, to explore the trends observed in optoelectronic characterization. The use of computational methods to investigate the theoretical properties of π-conjugated materials has been a well-documented method to screen and compare related structures.64–67 For this study, molecular geometries were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory with time-dependent calculations completed using TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) to predict the optical and electronic properties of this series of materials. Complete computational data is included in the ESI.†
Experimental data shows that the absorption spectra and cyclic voltammograms are a sum of the individual components suggesting a localization of orbitals. The DFT results support this notion (Fig. 5), except for TII-B where a discrepancy exists, which predicts a lower-lying LUMO energy level and the presence of a HOMO to LUMO orbital transition.
 Fig. 5  DFT predictions for geometry optimization, energy level determination, π-orbital delocalization, and optical transitions for (A) TII-B (B) DPP-B and (C) TII-B. 
The ground-state geometries of the three materials are all predicted to contain a large dihedral angle between the thiophene bridging unit and the PDI terminal acceptor. This angle is smallest for TII-B (62°) and larger for ISI-B (78°) and DPP-B (82°). The non-planar π-conjugated backbones influence the electronic properties of the materials and help to explain the experimental data.
Investigation of the HOMO and LUMO depictions reveals that for DPP-B and ISI-B, the LUMO is localized on the PDI units while the HOMO is localized on the dye core. LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −3.22 eV for both, while the HOMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.20 eV and −5.46 eV, for DPP-B and ISI-B, respectively. The trends correlate well with the CV data for these two materials but the same cannot be said for TII-B. TD-DFT predicts the LUMO energy level of TII-B to be −3.26 eV, yet the experimental results show that all three compounds have the same electron affinity. This discrepancy in the LUMO energy level for TII-B is carried through to the orbital depictions and predicted transitions. With the smallest dihedral angle (62° vs. ∼80°) our model predicts a HOMO to LUMO transition to be observed for TII-B, with apparent orbital delocalization from the PDI units through the TII core. This does not correlate with TD-DFT results for DPP-B and ISI-B, or the experimentally observed optoelectronic trends for the entire series and therefore, further investigation of this structure was required.
Considering the significant difference in the dihedral angle of TII-B and the other two materials, we looked at the influence of the HOMO and LUMO orbital delocalization and orbital transitions as a function of dihedral angle (Fig. 6). When we increase the dihedral angle to 90° we see a complete loss of the predicted HOMO to LUMO transition and the formation of localized orbitals that conform to the trend established by DPP-B and ISI-B. Alternatively, if we planarize the framework at the thiophene-PDI junction the probability of the HOMO to LUMO transition is increased with respect to the other transitions. As expected, the HOMO to LUMO transition is dependent on efficient π-orbital overlap and unless the backbone is sufficiently planar this transition is not observed as large dihedral angles will obstruct π-orbital delocalization. Based on these observations it is clear that the dihedral angle between the thiophene bridge and the PDI units in TII-B is in reality significantly larger than what was predicted by TD-DFT. With this small adjustment to the TD-DFT predictions for TII-B a stronger correlation can be made with the experimental results, which, in combination with the DFT predictions for DPP-B and ISI-B, lends further support the idea that the PDI units are acting independently from the dyes in this framework.

Space-charge limited-current devices
To assess the utility of this series of materials in organic electronic devices, their electron mobilities were measured by space-charge limited-current devices (SCLC). SCLC measurements were carried out using the following device architecture: ITO/active layer/LiF/Al with TII-B, DPP-B or ISI-B as the solution-processed active layer component. Electron mobilities (μe) were measured between 1.0 and 1.2 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 (ESI, Fig. S34†). The similarities in μe for this series of materials confirms that the electron mobilities are dictated by the PDI terminal units, considering that the same values are obtained regardless of the identity of the dye core.
Organic solar cell devices
To assess the influence of the different dye cores on photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies, organic solar cell devices were fabricated following our previously published methods.13 The OSC devices were constructed using a solution-processable bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in an inverted device architecture: ITO/ZnO/BHJ/MoOx/Ag (Fig. 7A) with an active layer blend using a 40:60 ratio of PTB7-Th:acceptor. When PTB7-Th (Fig. 7B) is paired with our acceptor materials the active layer blend offers suitable energy level offset to limit potential energy losses and maximize open-circuit voltages (Fig. 7B). The donor:acceptor blends also exhibit near panchromatic optical absorption profiles to achieve photocurrent generation across the visible spectrum, extending into the near-IR region (Fig. 8A), and photoluminescence quenching of PTB7-Th, indicative of efficient charge transfer processes (Fig. 8B). To ensure a simple and reproducible method, active layers were solution processed at room temperature in air and devices were tested under ambient conditions. Full details on device fabrication, optimization, current–voltage curves and device statistics can be found in the ESI.†

Data collected from as-cast devices spun at 1500 rpm from 10 mg mL−1 CHCl3 solutions using a 40:60 donor acceptor ratio. 
As-cast
Active layer BHJ blends were fabricated using CHCl3 as the processing solvent at 10 mg mL−1 concentrations and cast at 1500 rpm. Device efficiencies were 0.2% PCE (TII-B), 2.2% PCE (DPP-B) and 1.7% PCE (ISI-B). All devices with an as-cast active layer attained high open-circuit voltages (VOC, 0.9–1.0 V), but suffered from small fill factors (FF < 35%), while the short circuit current (JSC) was the parameter that really differentiated this series of materials.
The high VOC of approximately 1 V observed in this series of materials translates to an average of 0.65 eV in energy lost, TII-B (0.69 eV), DPP-B (0.60 eV) and ISI-B (0.66 eV). We calculated Eloss by subtracting the VOC from the energy at the onset of photocurrent generation (Fig. 8D). The small voltage losses in these devices indicates that we are close to reaching the maximum potential available from the active layer blend, while also approaching the values of some of the lowest reported energy losses.68,69 As determined by cyclic voltammetry, the electron affinities of these materials are dictated by the PDI terminal units, which remain unchanged upon substitution of different organic dyes. This suggests some important design criteria where the inclusion of two terminal PDI units serve to fix the electron affinity at 3.6 eV.
The variability in JSC highlighted the influence of the dye core on this device parameter. TII-B suffered from considerably lower short-circuit current (JSC < 0.8 mA cm−2) than the other two derivatives, which can explain the lower performance. This is well represented in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) profiles where both DPP-B and ISI-B show appreciable photocurrent generation from 400–800 nm, while TII-B exhibits negligible photocurrent in this region (Fig. 8D). This lack of photocurrent generation affected efficiencies of all active layers employing TII-B in this device optimization. Furthermore, the use of the thienoisoindigo building block in the general design of molecular materials has been met with low efficiencies,34,70,71 suggesting that there are some underlying issues with this dye in molecular systems.
Overall, device performance demonstrated that DPP-B and ISI-B achieved the better efficiencies (2.2 and 1.7% PCE) and TII-B was unable to match their performance (0.2% PCE) (Fig. 8C, Table 3). In an effort to increase efficiencies, a selection of different processing techniques were screened to help identify the best material in this series.

Solvent vapour annealing
Having identified the JSC and FF as the photovoltaic parameters that require improvement to increase device efficiencies, the active layers were treated with post-deposition CHCl3 vapour annealing.72–74 For this series of materials, no changes in the UV-vis profiles upon solvent vapour annealing were observed at 2 minute intervals up to 10 minutes (ESI, Fig. S29†). The absence of change in the UV-vis profile can be correlated with the lack of significant improvement in device efficiencies when using this post-deposition technique (Table 3, ESI Fig. S35, S40 and S44†). Based on these results, and comparison to our previous work,13 it has become evident that substituting n-octyl side chains on the dye core for 2-ethylhexyl entirely mitigates the response to CHCl3 vapour annealing.
High-boiling solvent additive
As an alternative method to influence the JSC and FF, a high-boiling solvent additive was also investigated (Table 3, ESI Fig. S37, S41 and S45†). 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was selected as the solvent additive owing to is wide spread use in OSC processing.75–77 We selected 0.5 v/v% DIO to processes the active layer blends as this is a common value used for PDI based BHJs,78 and was found to be optimal for BHJ blends using acceptors with linear side chains (see Structural evolution section). Processing PTB7-Th:TII-B active layers with 0.5 v/v% DIO resulted in no significant changes in the device performance, but the performance of PTB7-Th:DPP-B based devices was found to increase, a result of an improved FF (+15%) and efficiencies rose to 2.9%. On the other hand, the use of a DIO additive for processing the PTB7-Th:ISI-B active layers led to a dramatic increase in thin-film roughness from RMS = 1.04 nm for as-cast to RMS = 50.15 nm for DIO processed (AFM images in ESI, Fig. S55†) which resulted in a lower photovoltaic response (0.5% PCE) than the as-cast devices (1.7% PCE).
High-boiling processing solvent
Enabled by the use of 2-ethylhexyl side chains, which have afforded solubility in a range of solvents, devices were processed from o-xylenes instead of chloroform as an extension from a high-boiling solvent additive to a high-boiling processing solvent (Table 3, ESI Fig. S38, S42 and S46†). All as-cast o-xylene devices were fabricated from 10 mg mL−1 solutions cast at 600 rpm and were met with increases in JSC (+0.3–0.9 mA cm−2) and FF (+2–7%) leading to the best efficiencies for all materials (TII-B: 0.4%, DPP-B: 2.6%, and ISI-B 2.6% PCE). Notably, 2.6% PCE for ISI-B is one of the best reported efficiencies for non-fullerene molecular acceptors based on the isoindigo dye to date. For a building block that has reached promising efficiencies in polymeric and molecular donors,42,43,79 it remains a challenging dye to integrate and achieve high PCEs when used as a molecular acceptor.14,15,80,81
Summary
Ultimately, the relatively small increases in device efficiency were not considered sufficient enough to warrant a full scale optimization for this work. While efficiency increases are possible with further device engineering and screening a range of donor materials, we decided to instead focus on molecular engineering via organic synthesis to help identify the best structure in the series.
Structural evolution
Materials DPP-B and ISI-B with diketopyrrolopyrrole and isoindigo dye cores, respectively, vastly out-performed TII-B, with a thienoisoindigo core. Yet, the similarities between the DPP and ISI structures required further investigation to identify the best material design. Based on our previous work,13 it has become clear that the use of linear octyl side chains on the dye core affords a stronger morphological handle where the as-cast organization in the thin-film can be modified with post-deposition solvent vapour annealing, and observed in the optical absorption spectrum. To highlight the best dye core in this framework we have functionalized the isoindigo derivative with n-octyl side chains, ISI-L, and compared its performance with the DPP analogue DPP-L (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  Structures, AFM images, and optical absorption profiles of the active layer morphological changes upon the use of 0.5 v/v% DIO additive for (A) DPP-L and (B) ISI-L. 
The synthesis and characterization of DPP-L can be found in our previous work,13 and in the ESI† for ISI-L. The optoelectronic properties of these materials were nearly identical to their branched derivatives (ESI, Fig. S16, S17, S26 and S27†), yet favourable differences were highlighted in the solution-processing of thin-films. As previously demonstrated, DPP-L undergoes distinct changes to its thin-film UV-vis profile under CHCl3 vapour annealing conditions. While ISI-L does not exhibit the same behaviour (ESI, Fig. S32†), both ISI-L and DPP-L show a dramatic response to the use of a small volume fraction DIO additive, observed by thin-film UV-vis, offering an analytically adjustable processing method to compare these materials (ESI, Fig. S33†).
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated in the same manner as the 2-ethylhexyl derivatives and the as-cast devices were compared to a range of DIO additives (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0 v/v%). DPP-L demonstrated successive increases in PCE from as-cast up to 0.5 v/v% DIO, highlighted by substantial increases in JSC (+3.0 mA cm−2) and FF (+20%) which saw PCEs rise from 1.7% to 4.1% (Table 4, Fig. 10). Increasing the DIO content to 1.0 and 3.0 v/v% saw decreases in JSC and FF, accompanied by PCE drops to 3.1% and 1.9%. This response to the use of a DIO additive observable by UV-vis (Fig. 9A) is further highlighted by an increase in the quantum efficiency of the active layer blend in the region of the spectrum where DPP-L is absorbing light (500–600 nm, Fig. 10B). These results show that the change in the UV-vis profile of DPP-L upon the use of DIO additives can be correlated with an increase in photocurrent generation by this acceptor which leads to substantial efficiency increases compared to the as-cast devices.

The use of DIO additives with ISI-L was not accompanied by similar increases in device performance, and instead led to dramatic increases in thin-film roughness, as shown by AFM images (Fig. 9B) and no devices with greater than 0.5 v/v% DIO showed any photovoltaic performance (Table 4, ESI Fig. S52–54†). It is evident that the increase in thin-film roughness was detrimental to device performance, highlighting that although a response to DIO additives is observed by thin-film UV-vis (Fig. 9B), the changing morphology is not a favourable one for improved photovoltaic performance.
Summary
Identifying a post-deposition treatment or solvent additive that can change the as-cast UV-vis absorption profile of these acceptor materials can influence device performance, and has been correlated with thin-film re-organization dictated by these acceptors. This re-organization was beneficial for DPP-L, increasing JSC and FF to reach a best efficiency of 4.1%. Alternatively, for ISI-L it was detrimental, dramatically increasing thin-film roughness and deteriorating device performance. These influential changes were not observed to the same extent in the UV-vis profiles or device performance of the branched side chain derivatives TII-B, DPP-B, or ISI-B. This suggests that the steric bulk of the branched side chain mitigates re-organization by these selected methods. While the linear side chain derivative of DPP was found to be the superior structure in this study, other post-deposition methods or additives may be more suitable for the branched derivatives and are of interest for future work with these materials.
Conclusions
Considering our results, it has become evident that the use of a diketopyrrolopyrrole dye core between PDI terminal acceptors is the superior framework in this series.
While all final materials proved to be sufficiently amenable to our optimized direct heteroarylation coupling with a silica-supported catalyst, in terms of precursor synthesis, diketopyrrolopyrrole holds the advantage. Diketopyrrolopyrrole is assembled from its starting materials to include flanking thiophene units, and can be subsequently functionalized with a range of alkyl side chains from the unalkylated form of the dye. On the other hand, both thienoisoindigo and isoindigo require an additional step to install the flanking thiophene units required for the direct heteroarylation coupling. Furthermore, the thienoisoindigo dye core cannot be assembled in its unalkylated form, which complicates alkyl side chain derivatization.
In terms of optoelectronic properties, in all cases, the electron affinity was dictated by the PDI terminal units and the materials were differentiated by their ionization potentials. TII-B offers a unique low-energy absorption, but its ionization potential is quite low and likely hinders a channel II charge separation process. While ISI-B does not offer the low-energy absorption of TII-B, it does have a higher ionization potential to facilitate a channel II process. DPP-B offers a compromise between these two materials, a higher ionization potential than TII-B, and a more red-shifted absorption profile than ISI-B.
Solar cell device performance highlights the photocurrent deficiencies of TII-B, but DPP-B and ISI-B remained difficult to differentiate. Following structural modification to substitute branched 2-ethylhexyl side chains on the dye core for linear n-octyl the DPP-based material was identified as the best structure. DPP-L and ISI-L both exhibited thin-film re-organization observed by UV-vis upon the use of a DIO additive; however, this re-organization was only favourable with DPP-L which saw efficiencies rise from 1.7 to 4.1% when subjected to a 0.5 v/v% DIO additive. The use of a DIO additive with ISI-L dramatically increased the active-layer roughness and deteriorated device performance.
To summarize, the DPP core exhibited the best combination of optical and electronic properties, while also being the most synthetically accessible and amenable to the direct heteroarylation coupling procedure. Side chain engineering demonstrated how good performance could be achieved with both branched and linear side chains, each offering their own unique solution processing advantages.
Identifying DPP as the best dye in this series of non-fullerene acceptors correlates with a recent review highlighting the wealth of high-performance DPP-based materials in the literature.82 For this PDI-dye-PDI framework in particular, our work has highlighted the DPP dye core as the most promising non-fullerene acceptor to pursue for further device optimization with a range of donor materials, and has provided a structural foundation on which to build future material designs.
