Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, possessing the advantages of low-cost, high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths and high charge carrier mobilities, have been extensively studied in the field of photovoltaics in the past few years.1–3 The record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a perovskite based single-junction solar cell has reached 25.2%,4 approaching its theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit (∼30.5%).5 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are typically composed of a mesoscopic or planar perovskite layer as a light absorber, sandwiched between an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL). To date, most ETL materials are inorganic metal oxides including TiO2 and SnO2, which require a high temperature sintering or annealing process,6,7 and the most widely used HTL material is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) which exhibits a high conductivity after doping.8,9 Recently, there have been some reports on utilizing novel dopant-free organic molecular semiconductors as HTL or ETL materials in PSCs with enhanced device performances. For instance, pentacene,10 TIPS-PEN,11 perylene10 and tetracene12 were employed as HTL materials in PSCs with improved device stability and PCE. Several groups applied perylene diimides (PDIs) as ETL layers in PSCs and obtained a higher efficiency compared with that of traditional TiO2 ETL based devices.13–15 One common property of these organic molecules arouses our interest, that is, they all undergo a singlet fission (SF) process in a film or a crystalline structure.16–20 Are these SF molecules only working as HTLs or ETLs in PSCs? Is singlet fission involved in carrier dynamics in a perovskite/SF molecule bilayer structure?
Singlet fission (SF), an exciton multiplication process in organic semiconductors which converts one singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, is a promising way to reduce thermalization loss and circumvent the Shockley–Queisser limit in conventional single-junction solar cells.21 TIPS-pentacene (6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene), abbreviated as TIPS-PEN hereafter, is one of the most widely studied SF prototype materials, with SF proceeding on a sub ps time scale in a polycrystalline film.17,22,23 Kazim et al. fabricated TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3/TiO2 based solar cells with 11.8% efficiency, and suggested TIPS-PEN works as a HTL to receive holes from the MAPbI3 perovskite.11 Later on, Lee et al. studied the carrier dynamics in a TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer film and proposed that there is electron transfer from triplet states generated by SF in TIPS-PEN to the MAPbI3 perovskite.24 Therefore, the carrier dynamics in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer structure is still ambiguous up till now.
In this work, we studied the charge transfer dynamics between a SF molecule and a perovskite by performing transient absorption (TA) spectroscopic measurements on pristine MAPbI3, TIPS-PEN, and TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer films. A fast conversion process (1.5 ps) was observed between the correlated triplet pairs of TIPS-PEN and MAPbI3, and indicates that ultrafast electron transfer occurs from the correlated triplet pair states generated via SF in TIPS-PEN to the MAPbI3 perovskite. Time-resolved PL measurements suggest that hole transfer from MAPbI3 to TIPS-PEN proceeds on a time scale of tens of ns. Our study unveils the carrier dynamics in the TIPS-PEN/perovskite bilayer structure, and explores important perspectives of utilizing singlet fission sensitizers to improve the PSC performance.
Results and discussion
To minimize the impact of inhomogeneity from film to film, we fabricated MAPbI3, TIPS-PEN and their interfacial bilayer structures on the same glass substrate using a sequential two-step spin-coating procedure described in Fig. 1a. The detailed fabrication procedure can be found in the Experimental section. The thickness of the MAPbI3 or TIPS-PEN layer is around 85 nm, characterized using the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1b). It is worthy of note that this film is relatively thin compared to those of the practical perovskite solar cells owing to the large extinction coefficient of MAPbI3, since a nonopaque sample is desired in order to obtain the TA spectra in a broad spectral range. The steady-state absorption spectra of MAPbI3, TIPS-PEN and their interfacial bilayer are plotted in Fig. 1c, consistent with previous reports.2,17,24 The absorption band at 700 nm in the TIPS-PEN layer is indicative of good film crystallinity.25

To reveal the ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer film, we performed femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurements with a broad probe wavelength range (470–1000 nm). First, 800 nm was employed as the pump wavelength to excite MAPbI3 and TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 layers. In this case, the MAPbI3 perovskite is selectively excited since TIPS-PEN has a higher HUMO–LUMO energy gap and does not absorb at 800 nm (Fig. 1c blue curve). The obtained TA spectral features are similar in both MAPbI3 (Fig. 2a) and TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 (Fig. 2b), showing the representative TA spectra of MAPbI3, featuring a ground state bleaching (GSB) band at 750 nm and a photoinduced absorption (PIA) band at around 695 nm.2 Compared with pristine MAPbI3, the GSB spectral feature between the 800 and 900 nm region is missing in TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3, which can be attributed to the reduction of surface and grain boundary defects via introducing the organic molecules (TIPS-PEN) into the perovskite layer during spin-coating.26,27 Apart from this, no new TA bands are observed in TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3. The TA kinetics in MAPbI3 and TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 show a negligible difference within 6 ns (Fig. 2c), with detailed fitting parameters listed in Table S1 (ESI†). It suggests that the morphology of the MAPbI3 was not dramatically modified by spin-coating TIPS-PEN on top, and we can neglect the effect of surface passivation or additional trap states induced by spin-coating TIPS-PEN on top of MAPbI3.

Next, we performed TA measurements under excitation at 650 nm in order to excite TIPS-PEN. In this scenario, both MAPbI3 and TIPS-PEN were excited. The obtained TA spectra of the pristine MAPbI3 film are shown in Fig. 3a, and are similar to the TA spectra under 800 nm excitation (Fig. 2a). There are three main features in the TA spectra of the TIPS-PEN film (Fig. 3b): (i) two GSB bands at 585 and 700 nm, corresponding well to the steady-state absorption spectrum (Fig. 1c); (ii) a PIA band at around 530 nm due to absorption from triplet states generated via a singlet fission process (T1 → Tn);23,28,29 (iii) a broad NIR PIA band at around 860 nm spanning the spectral region from 735 to 1000 nm. There were only a few studies reported on this NIR TA band due to the limited spectral bandwidth. Moreover, the origin of this NIR TA band is still disputable. Yost et al.30 and Herz et al.23 proposed that this TA band was due to T1 → T2 transition, while Yong et al.31 and Stuart et al.32 attributed this TA band to the absorption of the correlated bound triplet pair 1(TT) which does not dissociate into two free triplet states. The TA spectra of the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer film under 650 nm excitation (Fig. 3c) contain TA spectral features from both MAPbI3 and TIPS-PEN. Normalized TA kinetics at 735 nm in MAPbI3 and TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 are plotted in Fig. 3d for comparison. The reason for choosing 735 nm is because it is not only within the GSB band of MAPbI3, but also a quasi-isosbestic point in the TA spectra of TIPS-PEN (Fig. 3b), i.e., the TA signal intensity from TIPS-PEN does not vary much with delay times. Therefore, we choose to compare the MAPbI3 TA kinetics at 735 nm in MAPbI3 and TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 to rule out the influence from TIPS-PEN. As shown in Fig. 3d, there is an additional rise time component of 1.49 ± 0.04 ps, obtained from fitting the results for the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer compared to the pristine MAPbI3 film. Furthermore, the relaxation lifetime also becomes longer in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer. The TA kinetics in a 5 ns time window (Fig. 3d–f), together with the detailed fitting parameters are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S2 (ESI†). These differences indicate that there is either charge or energy transfer from excited TIPS-PEN to MAPbI3 proceeding on an ultrafast ps time scale in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer film. It is known that the TIPS-PEN film undergoes ultrafast (∼100 fs) singlet fission which converts the excited singlet state S1 into two triplet states T1.33–35 The energy of T1 (0.85 eV (ref. 36 and 37)) in TIPS-PEN is much lower than the bandgap of MAPbI3 (∼1.6 eV), if energy transfer occurs, it would be expected to originate from S1 to MAPbI3 and should be fast enough to compete with the SF. Furthermore, energy transfer, either Dexter or resonant energy transfer (RET), is known to result in an excited state in the acceptor. In the case of the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer, energy transfer from TIPS-PEN to MAPbI3 will result in an increase of electron and hole densities in MAPbI3. It is known that free carriers (electrons and holes) are generated in the MAPbI3 perovskite upon photoexcitation.38 Therefore, the carrier dynamics in MAPbI3 follows the second order recombination model, i.e., dN/dt ∝ −kNeNh. It means that the higher the carrier density, the faster the carrier recombination. Therefore, we would expect the TA kinetics of MAPbI3 becomes shortened if energy transfer occurs from TIPS-PEN to MAPbI3 due to the increase of electron and hole densities. However, Fig. 3d suggests that the TA kinetics of MAPbI3 became slightly slower rather than shortened in the bilayer structure compared to the pristine MAPbI3 film. It indicates that energy transfer from TIPS-PEN to MAPbI3 is not the dominant carrier relaxation pathway in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer after photoexcitation.

It is known that energy level matching is a criterion for efficient charge transfer. As reported previously, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of TIPS-PEN in the solid state depend on the film thickness.39 Therefore, it is necessary to precisely determine the energy levels of TIPS-PEN and MAPbI3 layers employed in our study. UPS measurements were then carried out. The HOMO energy of the TIPS-PEN layer was determined to be −5.06 eV from the UPS spectrum (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The lower bound for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of −3.35 eV was calculated by adding the HOMO–LUMO gap obtained from the (αhν)2 − hν plot (Fig. S2b, ESI†). Similarly, the valence and conduction band energies of MAPbI3 were determined to be −5.46 and −3.95 eV, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†), in agreement with a previous report.40 The energy level of TIPS-PEN triplet states is estimated by adding the triplet energy of pentacene 0.85 eV (ref. 36 and 37) to the HOMO level. Regarding the energy level of 1(TT), previous literature reported that the 1(TT) state is nearly iso-energetic with S1 or twice energy of T1 in materials with high SF efficiencies.41,42 Therefore, we use the energy of 2E(T1) to represent the energy level of 1(TT) in the TIPS-PEN film. Based on the above, the energy level diagram of the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer is plotted in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that the triplet state energy level is ill-suited for charge transfer to the MAPbI3 conduction band (endothermic by ∼0.25 eV). Therefore, we can expect that the charge transfer from triplet states of TIPS-PEN to the conduction band of MAPbI3 will not be efficient. The other possible charge transfer path is electron transfer from the correlated bound triplet pair state (denoted by 1(TT) hereafter) generated via SF in TIPS-PEN to the MAPbI3 conduction band. This charge transfer route is further confirmed in our study by comparing the TA kinetics at λprobe = 900 nm and was attributed to 1(TT) states of TIPS-PEN.31,32 As shown in Fig. 3f, the lifetime of the 1(TT) state in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer is much shortened compared to the pristine TIPS-PEN film. Detailed fitting results are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The first decay component τ1 = 1.50 ± 0.09 ps of the 1(TT) state (λprobe = 900 nm) is in excellent agreement with the rise time component τ0 = 1.49 ± 0.04 ps obtained for TA kinetics of MAPbI3 (λprobe = 735 nm) in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer. A more straightforward comparison of the two TA kinetics is shown in Fig. 4a. Therefore, we conclude that ultrafast electron transfer proceeds from the correlated triplet pair state generated via SF in TIPS-PEN to the MAPbI3 conduction band on a time scale of ps, as shown in Fig. 4b (solid blue arrow). In Fig. 3e, the TA kinetics at 530 nm in TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 also shows a slight shortening compared to pristine TIPS-PEN, in agreement with a previous report.24 We assign this to the charge transfer from the long-lived S1 or Tn states generated by triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) in TIPS-PEN to the MAPbI3 conduction band. It is also possibly due to the spectral overlap between 1(TT) and T1 in the visible range since it is always difficult to completely separate the spectral features of T1 and 1(TT). However, it is noteworthy that this charge transfer route is much less efficient compared to the direct triplet pair charge transfer route mentioned above. Lee et al. also observed the NIR TA band in the TIPS-PEN film, however, with a much lower amplitude.24 This weak NIR band was fully covered by the negative GSB signal from MAPbI3 in the bilayer structure. In our study, the NIR TA band is much more pronounced. We believe the main origin of this difference is from the morphology variations of the TIPS-PEN layer. In ref. 24, the bilayer film was heated at 60 °C for 1 hour after depositing TIP-PEN on top of MAPbI3. We annealed the TIPS-PEN film at 80 °C for 1 h, which results in a more ordered TIPS-PEN film which favours the formation of a triplet pair state and allows observing the ultrafast CT channel from 1(TT) to MAPbI3. Direct multielectron transfer from the 1(TT) state has been reported previously.31,37,43,44 The first reported system is the pentacene/C60 bilayer by Zhu et al. through a time-resolved two photon photoemission spectroscopy study, which suggests that two-electron transfer (2ET) from 1(TT) of pentacene to C60 occurs in 400 fs and dominates the relaxation pathway, whereas one-electron transfer (1ET) from free triplets proceeds on a longer timescale.37 A follow up study reported that tetracene also undergoes 2ET from the 1(TT) state to C60 but with much lower efficiency.43 In our study, the TA kinetics in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer suggests that direct two-electron transfer (2ET) from 1(TT) of TIPS-PEN to MAPbI3 is the most plausible dominant electron transfer pathway. Since if only one-electron transfer (1ET) occurs from 1(TT), one triplet state will be left as a product after 1ET.37 Therefore, we would expect to observe a rise component of ∼1.5 ps in the T1 kinetics which corresponds to the ultrafast decay of 1(TT). However, as shown in Fig. 3e, there is no visible additional rise component in the T1 kinetics in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer. In order to mimic the practical working conditions of a solar cell under illumination with broad solar spectrum, broadband excitation TA spectra were also measured, shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The fitting results are presented in Table S3 (ESI†). Similar to the results obtained under narrowband excitation at 650 nm, the electron transfer from 1(TT) to MAPbI3 proceeds within 1 ps.

There was no detectable steady-state photoluminescence (PL) in the TIPS-PEN film,45 due to the efficient PL quenching by the ultrafast singlet fission process. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 5a, the steady-state PL spectra of MAPbI3 and TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 only show the PL signature from MAPbI3, centered at around 775 nm.2 Furthermore, under identical experimental conditions, the PL intensity of MAPbI3 is apparently reduced when interfaced with the TIPS-PEN layer. Moreover, the PL lifetime of the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer is also shortened compared with the pristine MAPbI3 layer (Fig. 5b), with fitted average lifetimes of 28.3 ns and 9.3 ns for MAPbI3 and TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3, respectively. Detailed fitting parameters of the time-resolved PL traces are shown in Table S4 (ESI†). The PL intensity decrease or lifetime shortening of MAPbI3 in the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer is expected to originate from either charge or energy transfer from MAPbI3 to TIPS-PEN. The transfer time can be estimated to be around 13.8 ns using the equation: 1/τ0 + 1/τtransfer = 1/τ1, where τ0 is the original PL lifetime in the pristine perovskite film (28.3 ns), and τ1 is the PL lifetime of the bilayer film (9.3 ns). As mentioned previously, the carrier dynamics in MAPbI3 follows the second order recombination model, i.e., dN/dt ∝ −kNeNh.46 The ultrafast electron transfer from TIPS-PEN to MAPbI3 will increase the electron density, thus, enhance the carrier recombination, resulting in a shorter PL lifetime in MAPbI3. However, as shown in Fig. 4a and Table S2 (ESI†), the amplitude percentage of a 1.4 ps rise component in the TA kinetics of MAPbI3 is about 38%. Thus, we can estimate the electron density in MAPbI3 increases by 38% due to electron transfer from 1(TT) of TIPS-PEN to MAPbI3. However, this could not explain why the PL lifetime is shortened by 3 times and the steady state PL intensity shows an apparent decrease. The other possible reason is that charge or energy transfer takes place from MAPbI3 to TIPS-PEN. The energy level alignment in Fig. 4b shows that hole transfer is energetically favoured than electron or energy transfer from MAPbI3 to TIPS-PEN. Kazim et al. fabricated solar cells using TIPS-PEN as a hole transporting layer with a PCE of 11.8%.11 Nienhaus et al. recently reported that MA0.15FA0.85PbI3 thin films can function as efficient triplet sensitizers of rubrene through sequential electron and hole transfer, with a triplet sensitization rate of τ = 15 ns.47 This transfer rate agrees well with our extracted PL quenching rate (13.8 ns), which indicates that besides hole transfer to the HOMO of TIPS-PEN, electrons could also possibly transfer to TIPS-PEN to form a bound triplet, and delayed PL from TIPS-PEN could be expected via a triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) process. However, as mentioned above, except for the PL feature from MAPbI3, we did not observe any visible shorter PL emission which could be attributed to TIPS-PEN in the steady state PL spectra. Therefore, it is unlikely that triplet sensitization could be the dominant PL quenching channel investigated here. Therefore, we attribute the MAPbI3 PL quenching to hole transfer from MAPbI3 to TIPS-PEN, with a transfer rate of around 13.8 ns. It is noteworthy that this hole transfer is much slower than that reported in the MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD heterostructure (0.75 ns).2 However, Kazim et al. reported a higher PCE (11.8%) and a short-circuit current density Jsc (20.84 mA cm−2) using the MAPbI3/TIPS-PEN based device than the PCE (9.77%) and Jsc (18.61 mA cm−2) of MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD based device.11 It indicates that except for hole transfer, there is another channel which increases the carrier density thus enhancing the current density and device efficiency. It could be possibly explained by the ultrafast electron transfer from 1(TT) of TIPS-PEN via SF to the MAPbI3 perovskite in our study. In SF based photovoltaic blends, charge transfer can occur from triplet pair states with >100% photon-to-charge conversion efficiency.31 Utilizing the exciton multiplication merit of SF, thermalization energy loss in conventional single junction perovskite solar cells can be reduced. Therefore, it is highly promising that SF molecules could be applied as sensitizers to further improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells towards breaking the Shockley–Queisser limit.

Conclusions
To summarize, we performed an extensive spectroscopic study to elucidate the carrier transfer behavior in a TIPS-pentacene/MAPbI3 perovskite heterojunction film. We demonstrated that singlet fission (SF) is involved in the carrier dynamics in the TIPS-pentacene/MAPbI3 bilayer structure. Ultrafast electron transfer is verified to directly proceed from the correlated triplet pair states of TIPS-pentacene generated by SF to the MAPbI3 conduction band within 1.5 ps. Hole transfer from MAPbI3 to TIPS-pentacene proceeds on a much longer time scale of tens of ns. The results observed in this study may also apply to other SF sensitized photovoltaic devices. Future work exploring different SF molecules for fine tuning their energy levels and optimizing the thickness of the SF layer is desired to improve the charge transfer efficiency towards highly efficient SF sensitized photovoltaics.
Experimental section
Materials
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) powders were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp (purity >99%). TIPS-PEN (purity >99%, HPLC grade) was purchased from Ossila Ltd. Anhydrous DMF was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chlorobenzene (purity >99.5%) was purchased from Macklin. All chemicals were used as received without further purification unless otherwise stated.
Sample preparation
The MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 28.6 mg MAI and 77 mg PbI2 (1:1 molar ratio) in 1 mL anhydrous DMF, resulting in a precursor solution with a concentration of 10 wt%. TIPS-PEN was dissolved in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 40 mg mL−1. The MAPbI3 precursor solution and the TIPS-PEN solution were stirred at 70 °C until all components were fully dissolved. Glass substrates were cleaned using the Hellmanex III solution (1%) and isopropanol solution in an ultrasonication system for 5 min respectively, sequentially dried with a compressed air gun, and then cleaned with ultraviolet/ozone treatment for 30 min.
The MAPbI3, TIPS-PEN and TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer films were fabricated on a single glass substrate using a sequential two-step spin-coating procedure described in Fig. 1a. One third of the glass substrate was first covered using masking tape (Scotch 810, 3M) and then spin-coated with the MAPbI3 precursor (4000 rpm). After removing the masking tape, the glass was transferred to a hot plate for annealing at 80 °C for 30 min until the film colour turned from yellow into dark brown, resulting in two-thirds of the glass covered with MAPbI3. Half of the MAPbI3 film was covered with another masking tape and sequentially spin-coated with TIPS-PEN on top (3000 rpm). After detaching the masking tape, the obtained film was finally annealed on the hot plate at 80 °C for 10 min to remove the residual solvent. The whole fabrication procedure was conducted in a nitrogen filled glove box. The sample was used as is without intentional encapsulation. After spin-coating, we performed the optical characterization immediately on the as-fabricated film. The as-fabricated film could survive around 3–5 days under our lab conditions with a constant temperature of 23 °C and a humidity of 35%. The tape mask does not influence the properties of the MAPbI3 layer, as demonstrated in Fig. S4 (ESI†). In addition, the oxygen quenching effect on the triplet states can be ruled out due to the low triplet energy of TIPS-PEN (0.85 eV, significantly lower than the transition energy of triplet oxygen → singlet oxygen). It is further confirmed by the TA measurements on the TIPS-PEN film stored in a vacuum using an Optistat DN-V2 optical cryostat (Oxford Instruments) and in air as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
Steady-state characterization
The cross-sectional (SEM) image of the TIPS-PEN/MAPbI3 bilayer film was recorded using a Hitachi SU8220 field emission microscope operated at 10 kV. The steady-state absorption spectra were measured with a Shimadzu UV 3600 Plus spectrometer. The steady-state PL spectra were recorded using a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) under excitation at 600 nm. To minimize the scattering or other influence on the excitation light intensity, for all optical characterization, we illuminated the sample from the MAPbI3 side, i.e., from the glass substrate side for both single layer or bilayer structures.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)
The UPS spectra were recorded using an X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer/ESCA (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The measurements were performed in a multi-chamber ultra-high vacuum system with a base pressure of 5 × 10−10 mbar, using He I (21.22 eV) with a resolution of 10 meV. To obtain the secondary electron cut-off (SEC), a sample bias of −5 V was applied in the normal emission geometry. The Fermi level edge of a sputtered clean Au film was measured to calibrate all UPS spectra and used to define the reference zero binding energy.

Time-resolved PL measurements were performed using the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) module of a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorometer. The excitation light source is a pulsed laser diode (570 nm, 1 MHz repetition rate). The overall time resolution is 1.6 ns as determined from the deconvolution of the instrument response function (IRF).
Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy
The TA spectra were collected using an amplified Ti:sapphire laser system (Solstice Ace, Spectra Physics), with an output of 800 nm at a 1 kHz repetition rate, a 35 fs pulse width, and a power of 6 W. Broadband pulses (470–1000 nm) are produced by spectrally broadening the output 800 nm pulse in a neon-filled hollow-core fiber. Pulse compression by the chirped mirrors yields a pulse width of 8 fs. The broadband pulses were split into two beams using a beamsplitter. The weaker one was used as a probe beam, and the stronger one was used as the broadband excitation pump beam. The 650 nm pump pulse is selectively generated by inserting a bandpass filter (center at 650 nm, 10 nm bandwidth) into the original broadband pump pulse path. 800 nm excitation TA experiments were performed using the fundamental output from the amplifier as a pump pulse. The probe pulses were generated by focusing 800 nm pulses on a 3 mm sapphire window to generate white light continuum. A pump fluence of 650 nm is 283 μJ cm−2 (50 fs, 1 kHz) and an excitation fluence of 800 nm is 566 μJ cm−2 (50 fs, 1 kHz). A computer-controlled, piezo-driven high precision translation stage (Physik Instrumente) incorporated with a long travel range motorized stage (Newport) was placed in the pump beam arm to generate a time delay between pump and probe pulses with a 1 fs time delay precision and a 8 ns time window.
