    , Accepted 21st December 2018First published on 21st December 2018AbstractRational molecular design towards high-performance photovoltaic materials with superior large-area capability is critical but still a challenge for the research field of polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we design and synthesize a new dialkylthio-substituted conjugated polymer donor (namely PBN-S) to address this issue. PBN-S shows strong absorbance in the wavelength range of 500–700 nm and has a low-lying HOMO level of −5.48 eV, which matches that of the nonfullerene acceptor IT-4F. Optimized PSCs based on PBN-S:IT-4F demonstrate a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.10%, benefitting from the efficient charge separation, high and balanced charge mobility, ordered molecular packing and aggregation of the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer. In addition, the PCE of a PBN-S based semitransparent PSC reaches 9.83% with an average visible transmittance of 32%. What is more, remarkable PCEs of 10.21% and 10.69% were realized from spin-coated or blade-coated PSCs with an active area of 100 mm2, respectively, indicating the great potential of PBN-S as a donor in high-performance large-area PSC application. More importantly, the PBN-S based devices show excellent shelf-life stability, retaining over 80% of their initial PCE after 100 days storage in a nitrogen-filled glove-box or in air. These results demonstrate the promising capability of PBN-S as a donor material for future PSC applications.

Broader context
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been regarded as a very promising photovoltaic technology due to their unique advantages of being lightweight, semitransparent, and their capability to be fabricated into large area flexible devices. To realize high-performance PSCs, rational design of polymer donor materials with broad absorption spectra, suitable energy levels, and appropriate crystallinity to match the features of acceptor materials is essential. In this work, we designed and synthesized a dialkylthio-substituted conjugated polymer donor (namely PBN-S), which exhibits great potential in high-performance nonfullerene PSC applications. A PBN-S based opaque device exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.10% and a semitransparent device demonstrated a promising PCE of 9.83%, with a notable average visible transmittance of 32%. What is more, a remarkable PCE of 10.69% was achieved from blade-coated PSCs with an active area of 100 mm2.

1. Introduction
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have several unique merits such as being lightweight, semitransparent, and easily manufactured into large-area flexible devices.1–4 Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blend films of donor and acceptor materials are the key components for PSCs, and thus photovoltaic material innovations are the major forces to push forward the development of PSCs.5–16 In particular, the emergence of nonfullerene acceptors has significantly driven the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs to over 13% in recent years.14–16 Unlike fullerene derivatives, narrow bandgap A–D–A (acceptor–donor–acceptor) type small molecule acceptors present the advantages of easy tuning of the bandgaps and energy levels, and intermolecular π–π interactions by molecular design. Such unique features of nonfullerene acceptors enable various abilities to broaden the absorption range, minimize energy loss, and render favorable molecular packing and nano-scale phase separation of blend films.11
To realize high-performance nonfullerene PSCs, rational design of polymer donor materials to match the unique features of nonfullerene acceptors is essential. First of all, polymer donor materials should have complementary absorption to nonfullerene acceptors to enhance the light harvesting capability of the active layer. Secondly, suitable energy levels of polymer donors are required to ensure efficient charge separation and to maximize Voc. Thirdly, polymer donor materials should have appropriate crystallinity matching with nonfullerene acceptors to realize favorable morphologies and face-on orientations for efficient charge transport. Based on the above molecular design criteria, several high-performance D–A copolymer donors based on the bithienyl-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) donor unit with different acceptor units such as benzotriazole13 and benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione units have been developed.16
Despite the fact that much progress has been made in nonfullerene PSCs, rational molecular design towards high-performance photovoltaic materials with superior large-area capability is still a challenge. In 2011, we first reported a new naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione (NTDO) acceptor unit which possesses a planar structure and offers several loci in the phenyl ring for functionalization,17 and the NTDO-based D–A copolymer donor exhibited promising photovoltaic performance in fullerene PSCs.17,18 In addition, Cui et al. found that introducing alkylthio side chains onto the BDTT unit can effectively down-shift the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) levels (since the sulfur atom can function as a moderate π-acceptor group when the alkylthio chains are attached to the conjugated unit), red-shift the absorption, and improve the hole mobility of the resulting conjugated polymer donors, leading to an overall enhanced photovoltaic performance.19,20 In contrast, the strong electron-donating effect of alkoxy chains significantly increases the HOMO level of the conjugated polymer, resulting in lower Voc values.19 From a material synthesis point of view, it is more challenging to use electron-withdrawing chains (such as amides (–CONHR) and esters (–COOR)) to functionalize the NTDO unit, since the NTDO unit is prepared by the Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction in which the electron-deficient group on the phenyl unit will lead to a very low (or even no) product yield. Motivated by the unique advantages of alkylthio chains and with the purpose of designing a NTDO based polymer donor with a deep HOMO level, in this work, we attach alkylthio chains on the NTDO unit to develop a dialkylthio-substituted NTDO based copolymer (PBN-S) (see Fig. 1a) as a donor material for application in nonfullerene PSCs. With the benefits from the positive effect of dialkylthio-substitution in the NTDO unit and the suitable delocalized frontier molecular orbitals of the π-conjugated system, PBN-S shows a deep HOMO level of −5.48 eV, and thus a high Voc of 0.891 V can be obtained from an optimal PSC device with PBN-S as a donor and IT-4F16 as an acceptor. Meanwhile, owing to the efficient charge separation, high and balanced charge mobility, and ordered molecular packing and aggregations of the PBN-S:IT-4F blend, a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.03 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.699 were achieved, leading to a notable PCE of 13.10%. In addition, PBN-S:IT-4F based semitransparent PSCs yielded a promising PCE of 9.83%, with an average visible transmittance (AVT, calculated from 370 to 740 nm) of 32%. What is more, remarkable PCEs of 10.21% and 10.69% were realized from spin-coated or blade-coated PSCs with an active area of 100 mm2, respectively. More importantly, PBN-S based devices showed excellent shelf-life stability, with 88% of their initial PCE after 100 days (2400 hours) storage in a nitrogen-filled glove-box and over 80% of their initial value after 100 days storage in air. These results demonstrate the great potential of dialkylthio-substituted NTDO in highly efficient polymer donor design and the promising feature of PBN-S as a polymer donor for high-performance and large-area PSC applications.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and optoelectronic properties
The synthesis route of PBN-S is provided in Scheme S1 in the ESI† and detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† PBN-S shows good solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. A number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 16.2 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.36 was estimated for PBN-S, measured by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 160 °C.
The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PBN-S and IT-4F are shown in Fig. 1b. PBN-S displays almost identical absorption profiles in solution and the thin film form with shoulder peaks at 632 and 625 nm, respectively, indicating the existent polymer aggregation and effective stacking of the polymer chains both in solution and in the solid state. In particular, a weaker but still clear shoulder peak can still be identified in the absorption spectrum of the polymer solution even when the solution temperature is increased to 100 °C (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), meaning that the polymer is still in an aggregated state even at high temperature. The absorption of the PBN-S film is mainly located in the wavelength range of 500–700 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.75 eV (estimated from the absorption onset of the PBN-S film, 710 nm). PBN-S exhibits complementary absorption spectra to IT-4F, which can effectively broaden the absorption range of the blend film for facilitating the light harvesting of PSC devices.
The energy levels of PBN-S were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S2 (ESI†), PBN-S exhibits a pretty low HOMO level of −5.48 eV and a LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of −3.52 eV. The low-lying HOMO of PBN-S should be beneficial for obtaining high Voc, and the LUMO energy offset (0.38 eV) between PBN-S and IT-4F is sufficient for charge separation. Theoretical calculation with density functional theory (DFT) was performed to provide further insight into the molecular architecture of PBN-S. As depicted in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† the electron density distributions at the LUMO are mainly localized in the NTDO units, while the HOMO surfaces are well-delocalized along the entire conjugated backbone. PBN-S shows relatively good molecular planarity with small dihedral angles (θ2, θ3, and θ4) of the conjugated backbone (Fig. S3 in the ESI†), which should facilitate charge transportation.
2.2. Photovoltaic properties
PSC devices with a conventional configuration of glass/ITO/PDEOT:PSS/PBN-S:IT-4F/ZnO/Al were fabricated to study the photovoltaic performance of PBN-S. As shown in Table S1 and Fig. S4 in the ESI,† the optimal donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio is 1:1 (w/w) for the devices (active area = 2 × 2 mm2). Further optimization of the PBN-S based devices involves thermal annealing (TA) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) solvent additive processing, and the optimal treatment conditions are using 1% DIO (v/v) as an additive and then thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min (as shown in Table S2 in the ESI†). The key photovoltaic parameters of the PBN-S based devices are summarised in Table 1 and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a.

Benefiting from the low-lying HOMO level of PBN-S, a notable Voc of 0.908 V was obtained from the as-cast PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) based device, with a high PCE of 10.16% and an encouraging Jsc of 19.01 mA cm−2. Using 1% (v/v) DIO as an additive to process the blend film, the Voc was slightly decreased to 0.887 V, while an enhanced FF of 0.649 was obtained, leading to a higher PCE of 12.12%. Importantly, the dual treatment with 1% DIO and TA at 100 °C for 10 min leads to the best PCE of 13.10% for the PBN-S based device, with Voc = 0.891 V, Jsc = 21.03 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.699. It is worth noting that an encouraging Jsc of over 21 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.699 were still realized in the PBN-S:IT-4F based device in spite of the low photon energy loss (Eloss = Eg − qVoc) of 0.63 eV. The high Jsc of the devices is mainly attributed to the complementary absorption of PBN-S and IT-4F, which is evidenced by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (as shown in Fig. 2b). The optimal PBN-S:IT-4F based device showed a broad EQE response from 300 to 850 nm, and EQE values of over 70% were recorded over the broad range of 514–760 nm, with a maximum EQE of 82.2% at 580 nm. The integral Jsc value calculated from the EQE curves is rather consistent with the value (within 7% mismatch) obtained from the J–V measurements.
Considering the fact that the PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend shows high transparency in the wavelength range of 400–600 nm, which is most sensitive to human eyes, we further exploited the application of PBN-S in semitransparent PSCs (ST-PSCs). Semitransparent devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w)/ZnO/Au (1 nm)/Ag. The ultrathin Au (1 nm) acts as a seed layer to form the nucleation center, causing the Ag electrode to be more uniform and then realize optimal conductivity and transmittance.21 Ag electrodes with thicknesses of 10, 15, and 20 nm were fabricated for the devices to balance the trade-off between transparency and efficiency. Table 2 lists the key parameters of the ST-PSCs, and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3a. As shown in Fig. 3b and Table 2, upon increasing the Ag electrode thickness, the average transmittance (AT, calculated from 400 to 600 nm) and AVT of the devices decrease, while an overall better photovoltaic performance was observed. Notably, the semitransparent device with a 20 nm Ag thick layer yielded a promising PCE of 9.83%, with an encouraging AT of 39% and AVT of 32%. Such terrific photovoltaic performance and transparency of the PBN-S based ST-PSCs is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art PSCs reported in the literature.22,23 The color transparency perceptions of the PBN-S based ST-PSCs were further investigated by using the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1931 chromaticity diagram. The color coordinates of the transmitted light of the ST-PSCs with Ag cathodes with different thicknesses are listed in Table S3 and Fig. S6 in the ESI.† The PBN-S based ST-PSC with a 20 nm thick Ag cathode has color coordinates of (0.205, 0.231) and a color rendering index (CRI) of 92. The high CRI indicates accurate color rendering upon illumination through the PBN-S based semitransparent devices. Fig. 3c and d show photographs of the PBN-S based ST-PSCs without or with the 20 nm Ag cathode; that is, the background pattern can be clearly seen through the semitransparent device.

2.3. Charge transport properties and recombination mechanisms
The high and balanced charge-carrier mobility of the active layer is essential for highly efficient PSCs. The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the charge transport properties of the pristine PBN-S and PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend films. As shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI,† the pure PBN-S film exhibited a high SCLC hole mobility (μh) of 5.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The as-cast PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend film showed a hole mobility of 3.56 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 6.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. When processed with 1% DIO and TA at 100 °C for 10 min, both a higher hole mobility of 2.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and electron mobility of 1.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained from the PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend film (Fig. S7 in the ESI†). In comparison with the as-cast device, the enhanced charge carrier mobility could result in a higher FF of the device with post-treatment.
To further clarify the role of 1% DIO and TA treatment in enhancing the FF value of the PSCs, saturation current density (Jsat) and charge dissociation probabilities P(E,T) measurements of the devices were performed. Fig. 4a plots the curves of Jph (Jsat = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current densities under light and in the dark) versus effective voltage (Veff) of the PSCs without or with 1% DIO and TA treatment. It is supposed that all of the photo-generated excitons were dissociated into free charges and collected by electrodes at a high Veff (Veff = 2 V in this case).24 The Jsat value for the as-cast device is 20.14 mA cm−2 and the dual treatment with 1% DIO and TA leads to a slightly higher Jsat value of 21.34 mA cm−2. The P(E,T) of the PSC device is defined as Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions.25 A P(E,T) of 95% was determined for the as-cast device, while the device processed with 1% DIO and TA at 100 °C for 10 min showed a higher P(E,T) of 98%, indicating good charge extraction in the PBN-S based devices. The dependence of Jsc on the light intensity (Plight) was measured to further understand the charge recombination kinetics of the devices. The correlation between Jsc and Plight can be described as Jsc ∝ Plightα, where the power-law exponential fact α implies the extent of bimolecular recombination.26 As depicted in Fig. 4b, the α value of the PBN-S based device without any post-treatment was fitted to 0.954. After processing with 1% DIO and TA at 100 °C for 10 min, a higher α of 0.977 was obtained, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination is effectively suppressed in the blend film after the post-treatment. The measurement of the dependence of Voc on the Plight was carried out to determine the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) based devices. As shown in Fig. 4c, slopes of 1.12 and 1.19 kT/q, which are close to 1 × kT/q, were fitted for the PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) as-cast or with 1% DIO and TA treatment, respectively, implying lower trap density and weak trap-assisted recombination in the PBN-S based devices.27 Relative to the as-cast device, the higher Jsat and P(E,T) values combined with the weaker bimolecular recombination of the PSC device with dual treatment with 1% DIO and TA should partially contribute to the improved FF.

2.4. Molecular packing and morphology analysis
2D grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to investigate the molecular packing properties of the neat polymer and blend films. As shown in Fig. 5, the neat PBN-S polymer film exhibited a clear (100) diffraction peak in the in-plane (IP) direction at 0.26 Å−1 with a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 8.06 nm. Stronger laminar packing diffraction (100 and 300) peaks at 0.29 Å−1 and 0.85 Å−1 were observed in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, respectively, indicating the crystallinity and ordered packing of the pristine PBN-S film. The as-cast PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend film showed high intensity lamellar stacking (100) peaks in both the IP (CCL = 16.06 nm) and OOP directions. Moreover, the (010) peak located at 1.76 Å−1 (CCL = 1.11 nm) in the OOP direction suggests a preferential face-on orientation for the as-cast blend film, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport in the vertical direction across the electrodes of PSCs.28 Importantly, the blend film processed with 1% DIO and TA treatment showed a stronger π–π stacking (010) peak in the OOP direction (CCL = 3.12 nm) than the as-cast blend, implying that the post-treatment effectively renders the face-on oriented π–π packing structure in the blend, thus resulting in a higher charge mobility and FF.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed to study the top surface of the PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend films without or with post-treatment. As depicted in Fig. 6a–d, the as-cast PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend film exhibited a rather smooth surface and defined crystalline bulk, with a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 2.58 nm. The dual treatment with 1% DIO and TA at 100 °C for 10 min leads to a smoother surface (Rq = 1.29 nm) and uniform crystalline bulk of the blend film (Fig. 6b and d). The bulk morphology of the blend film was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 6e and f, the as-cast blend film showed a well-developed fibrillar structure, while the blend film with post-treatment exhibited a better bicontinuous D/A interpenetrating network with more defined phase separation, which should favor highly efficient exciton dissociation and charge transportation.

2.5. Large-area device performance and long-term stability
With respect to the commercial application requirement of scaling-up devices from lab-scale area to industrial-scale large areas, the large-area capability of photovoltaic materials in yielding high efficiency is essential. One major obstacle hindering the photovoltaic performance in most large-area devices is the active layer thickness-dependence of the photovoltaic performance; that is, the optimal thickness should be precisely restricted to a small range and even a small variation in thickness across the device area will lead to a significant decrease in device performance.29 Encouraged by the promising features of the efficient charge separation, high and balanced charge mobility, and ordered molecular packing and aggregations of the PBN-S:IT-4F blend, we fabricated a PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) based device with a very thick active layer to preliminarily evaluate the potential application of PBN-S in large-area devices. As shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI,† a high PCE of 9.60% can be still realized from the device with an active layer thickness of 511 nm, with a Voc of 0.862 V, a Jsc of 21.63 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.515. Consequently, we fabricated PSC devices with active areas of 50 and 100 mm2 by the spin-coating method. The J–V curves of the devices with different active areas processed by spin-coating are shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI† and the key photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table 3. The device with an active area of 50 mm2 exhibited a notable PCE of 12.28%, with Voc = 0.883 V, Jsc = 22.01 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.632. Impressively, a high PCE of 10.21% can still be achieved from the device with an active area of 100 mm2, despite the relatively large thickness variation (ranging from 90 nm to 130 nm, as shown in Fig. S10, ESI†). The decreased FF of the large-area devices could be due to the increased series resistance of the ITO electrode. Furthermore, the blade-coating method was employed to fabricate PBN-S:IT-4F based devices with active areas of 50 and 100 mm2, respectively (a detailed fabrication procedure is presented in the ESI†). The blade-coated active layer exhibited relatively homogeneous active layer thickness (Fig. S10 in the ESI†). As shown in Table 3, a PCE as high as 11.90% was achieved from the blade-coated device with an active area of 50 mm2, with Voc = 0.878 V, Jsc = 20.93 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.648. Encouragingly, a promising PCE of 10.69% was realized from the blade-coated device with an active area of 100 mm2 (Table 3). We further probed the device processability by simply blading the PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) solution on the substrate with a piece of glass to form the active layer (namely the spreading method; a detailed description is provided in the ESI†). Although such a spreading method leads to a larger thickness variation of the active layer (Fig. S10 in the ESI†), the device with an active area of 4 mm2 exhibited a high PCE of 11.68%, which is comparable to those of the devices fabricated by the spin-coating method. Impressively, a high PCE of 7.69% can still be obtained from the device with an active area of 100 mm2, despite the fact that the active layer showed a large thickness variation ranging from 80 to 520 nm (Fig. S10 in the ESI†). The primary results demonstrate the great potential of PBN-S as a donor material for large-scale manufacture of PSCs. Besides, we also evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the inverted devices with the buffer layers deposited from solution, which is essential for roll-to-roll printed PSC modules. The detailed descriptions and discussions are provided in the ESI.†

In addition to the efficiency, the stability of the devices is also an essential factor but still a challenge for the application of PSCs.30–34 Developing photovoltaic materials with good oxidative and photochemical stability is an effective strategy to strengthen device stability.20,30 To estimate the stability of PBN-S:IT-4F based devices, the unencapsulated devices were stored (without light protection) in a nitrogen-filled glove-box or in air at room temperature. Fig. 7 shows the photovoltaic performance of the devices as a function of the storage time. The PBN-S:IT-4F based device stored in the nitrogen-filled glove-box exhibited good stability; that is, the device retains 90% of its initial PCE after 73 days (1752 hours) (Fig. 7a). After 100 days (2400 hours) storage, the device still retains over 88% of its initial PCE. The decreased PCE of the stored device mainly resulted from the FF loss, while the Jsc and Voc values show no major difference with increasing storage time. We fabricated the inverted device with a structure of glass/ITO/ZnO/PBN-S:IT-4F/MoO3/Al to further investigate the oxidative stability of the PBN-S based device, and the device was exposed to air under ambient conditions (without light protection) without encapsulation. In comparison with the devices stored in the nitrogen-filled glove-box, the unencapsulated devices exposed to air exhibited a rapid decay stage; that is, the PCE of the device sharply decreased to 82.8% within four hours (as shown in Fig. 7b). Impressively, the PBN-S based device was highly air stable after the rapid decline stage and the PCE retains over 80% of its initial value after 100 days storage in air. We finally explored the thermal stability of the PBN-S based device under continuous thermal aging in the nitrogen-filled glove-box. The normalized photovoltaic performances of the devices with different aging temperatures of 50 °C, 60 °C, and 70 °C are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). After 100 h of continuous thermal aging at 50 °C, the PBN-S based device retains 96% of its initial PCE without burn-in efficiency loss.34 When the thermal aging temperature was increased to 60 °C and 70 °C, 91% and 89% of its initial PCE was retained after100 h of continuous thermal aging, respectively. The decreased PCE of the devices under continuous thermal aging mainly due to the decreased FF (Fig. S12, ESI†). Overall, the PBN-S based devices show excellent storage lifetimes and good thermal stability.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a new D–A copolymer (PBN-S) based on the dialkylthio-substituted NTDO acceptor unit for application as a donor material in nonfullerene PSCs. PBN-S shows a strong absorption profile in the range of 500–700 nm, a low-lying HOMO level of −5.48 eV, and high crystallinity and ordered molecular packing properties. Optimized PSCs based on PBN-S:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) demonstrated a high PCE of 13.10%, which benefitted from the efficient charge separation, high and balanced charge mobility, ordered molecular packing and appropriate aggregations and complementary absorption in the active layer of the devices. And the PCE of ST-PSCs based on PBN-S:IT-4F reached 9.83% with an AVT of 32%. Notably, the device with an active area of 100 mm2 yielded an impressive PCE of 10.21%, indicating the superior large-area capability of the PBN-S-based PSCs. Moreover, the PBN-S based device showed good long-term shelf-life stability; that is, the device retained 88% of its initial PCE after 100 days (2400 hours) storage in a nitrogen-filled glove-box and over 80% of its initial efficiency after 100 days storage in air. The results demonstrate the great potential of dialkylthio-substituted NTDO in highly efficient polymer donor design and the promising feature of PBN-S as a polymer donor for high-performance and large-area PSC applications.

Broader context
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been regarded as a very promising photovoltaic technology due to their unique advantages of being lightweight, semitransparent, and their capability to be fabricated into large area flexible devices. To realize high-performance PSCs, rational design of polymer donor materials with broad absorption spectra, suitable energy levels, and appropriate crystallinity to match the features of acceptor materials is essential. In this work, we designed and synthesized a dialkylthio-substituted conjugated polymer donor (namely PBN-S), which exhibits great potential in high-performance nonfullerene PSC applications. A PBN-S based opaque device exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.10% and a semitransparent device demonstrated a promising PCE of 9.83%, with a notable average visible transmittance of 32%. What is more, a remarkable PCE of 10.69% was achieved from blade-coated PSCs with an active area of 100 mm2.
