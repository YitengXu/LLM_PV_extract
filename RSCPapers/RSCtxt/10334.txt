    , Accepted 16th October 2018First published on 18th October 2018AbstractUsing first-principles calculations, the photocatalytic performances of two dimensional (2D) few-layer group-III metal monochalcogenides MXs (M = Ga, In; X= S, Se) towards overall water splitting reaction are systematically investigated. On the basis of two criteria, i.e., the band edge positions need to straddle the oxidation potential of H2O and the reduction potential of H2, and an optimal band gap of ∼2.0 eV is required to enhance absorption in the visible range, it was found that few-layer GaSe is the most appropriate photocatalyst for overall water splitting. Further calculations revealed that: (i) with the number of layers increasing, few-layer GaSe tends to evolve into a direct bandgap semiconductor, and meanwhile, energy conversion efficiency of sunlight increases; (ii) carrier mobilities of few-layer GaSe are estimated to be as high as 880–7000 cm2 V−1 s−1, and photogenerated electrons and holes tend to spatially separate; and (iii) few-layer GaSe is predicted to be highly stable at room temperature. In brief, few-layer GaSe is demonstrated to have high stabilities, suitable band edge positions, optimal band gap value, high carrier mobility, and effective spatial separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs as well as excellent solar absorption, leading to its high promise as a next-generation 2D photocatalyst for overall water splitting in the visible range. Our results would motivate more experimental and theoretical research to further explore the potential of 2D few-layer GaSe as photocatalysts.
1. Introduction
The demand for renewable energies has never been so high due to the increase in population and the accompanying growing energy consumption. Hydrogen is an ideal renewable energy source as it is clean and abundant in nature with high energy yield and high energy storage capability in comparison with fossil fuels that are low-valued and highly polluting to the environment.
The generation of hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting is an extremely promising means to convert solar energy into clean energy sources.1,2 The key issue for photocatalytic water splitting is to develop high-efficiency photocatalysts. The basic principle for production of hydrogen via photocatalytic water splitting is as follows. The photocatalyst absorbs a photon with energy larger than the band gap, then excites an electron from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) forming pairs of electrons and holes.3 The excited electrons move to CB and take part in the hydrogen reduction reaction to generate H2; meanwhile, the produced holes in VB participate in the oxidation reaction to generate O2. To guarantee the occurrence of these two half-reactions for photocatalytic water splitting, two criteria must be satisfied. First, the band gap for overall water splitting should be over 1.23 eV and at most 3 eV to enhance optical absorption.4 Second, the band edge position of the photocatalyst should be suitable to promote water splitting. That is, the conduction band minimum (CBM) energy level should be higher than the hydrogen reduction potential (H+/H2, −4.44 eV) and the valence band maximum (VBM) energy level should be lower than the water oxidation potential (O2/H2O, −5.67 eV).5 Considering the driving forces which depend on the energy difference between the CBM/VBM band edge positions of the photocatalyst and the reduction/oxidation potentials of the water splitting reaction, and further making full use of sunlight, a band gap of around 2.0 eV is fit for photocatalysts in the visible range.6 However, few materials can meet all these requirements. Therefore, finding suitable photocatalysts for water splitting has become the heart of the matter.
Since graphene7 was successfully synthesized in 2004, research on two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),8,9 transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes),10,11 black phosphorene (BP),12,13 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),14,15 and monoelemental arsenene, antimonene,16 bismuthene,17 silicene,18 tellurene,19 as well as van der Walls (vdW) heterostructures,20,21 janus structures,22,23etc., have increased rapidly in recent years because of their unique properties and wide potential applications. On the one hand, the short migration distance of photogenerated electrons and holes before reaching the solid/water interface in 2D materials results in the possibility of electron–hole recombination reduction, which produces high quantum yields.24,25 On the other hand, the high specific surface area of 2D materials facilitates the redox reaction process, which enhances photocatalytic performance. Combined with ultra-high carrier mobility relative to traditional bulk materials, the 2D nanomaterials are highly promising as photocatalysts.
Lately, group-III metal monochalcogenides, MXs (M = Ga, In, X = S, Se), have emerged as a new class of 2D semiconductor materials with widespread potential applications in electrical, nonlinear optical and solar energy conversion devices.5,26–28 In particular, bulk MXs have band gaps in the range of 1.1–2.6 eV,29 which are well suited to the requirement of photocatalysis. However, the bulk carrier mobilities of GaS and GaSe are only ∼80 and ∼215 cm2 V−1 s−1,30 respectively. When these MXs are thin to few-layers, their band gaps enlarge to 1.3–3.3 eV due to quantum confinement effect, and their corresponding carrier mobilities are greatly increased; for instance, band gaps of atomically thin InSe reaches as high as 103 cm2 V−1 s−1.31 It is known that high carrier mobility accelerates charge separation and transfer to the surface, which is beneficial for photogenerated carriers to participate in their separate half-reactions in the photocatalytic process. Recently, 2D ultrathin GaS, GaSe and InSe have been successfully synthesized, which exhibit higher optical responses than graphene and other 2D material-based devices.27,31–33 Theoretically, the electronic properties of 2D monolayered MXs have been revealed. It was found that these MX monolayers present suitable band edge positions for overall water splitting.5 However, the unsuitable band gaps result in inefficient utilization of the majority of visible light in the solar radiation spectrum.
Measuring with the abovementioned two criteria, if the band gaps are modulated to ∼2 eV, and simultaneously the band edge positions are well maintained, 2D GaS, GaSe and InSe would be very promising as photocatalysts for overall water splitting. In this study, using first-principles calculations, layer-dependent electronic properties of 2D MXs are systematically investigated. Results show that few-layer GaSe is a highly promising photocatalyst in the visible range because it has suitable band gap, appropriate band edge positions, good optical absorption, high carrier mobility and effective spatial separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, as well as high stability.
2. Theoretical methods
All calculations were performed via density functional theory (DFT) using the projector augmented wave (PAW)34 method as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).35 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional was used.36 Considering interlayer vdW interactions, the dispersion-corrected DFT method (DFT-D3-BJ)37,38 was adopted for the bulk and few-layer MXs. Compared with DFT-D2,37 TS39 and dDsC40 methods, although the lattice parameters predicted by these different methods differ slightly, the layer distance described by DFT-D3 is more reliable as it is the closest to that of the corresponding experimental one. (Table S1, ESI†). The plane-wave energy cutoff was set to 450 eV and the convergence thresholds were set at 10−5 eV for energy and 10−2 eV Å−1 for force. 12 × 12 × 1, 12 × 12 × 1 and 12 × 12 × 4 k-point grids were employed for mono-, few-layer MXs and bulk MXs, respectively. To avoid interactions between two neighboring images, a vacuum space of more than 15 Å along z direction was adopted. To correctly predict band gap values, Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)41,42 was used for the exchange–correlation term. Spin-orbital coupling (SOC) was not considered as it has nominal effect on the band structures of MXs.43,44 Moreover, Born–Oppenheimer ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were employed to evaluate the stability of few-layer GaSe using 4 × 4 × 1 supercell and a Γ k-point at 300 K for 10 ps with a time step of 2 fs, where the Nosé algorithm45 was used to control temperature.
Carrier mobility μ2D is mainly dominated by phonon scattering in 2D nanomaterials, which can be calculated using the deformation potential theory46 and the deduced analytical expression:47  where e, ℏ, kB and T are the electron charge, reduced Planck constant, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. The elastic modulus C2D is derived from (E − E0)/A0 = C2D(Δl/l0)2/2, where E0 and E are the total energies before and after applying uniaxial strain (Δl/l0), respectively, and A0 is the equilibrium area of the system. The carrier effective mass m* is defined as m* = ℏ2(∂2EK/∂k2)−1 and average effective mass md is determined by . The deformation potential constant E1 is defined as E1 = ΔE/(Δl/l0), where ΔE is the shift in band edge due to the application of strain ε(Δl/l0).
3. Results and discussion
In our study, the numbers of layers in mono- and few-layer MXs (M = Ga, In; X = S, Se) are represented by nL, n = 1 to 5. The system of InS is excluded because no available literature demonstrates its experimental synthesis. We initially studied the geometric properties of bulk MXs and exfoliated monolayers. The bulk phase of MXs crystallizes in a space group of P63/mmc, which consists of monolayers held together by weak vdW interactions. The calculated lattice parameters of GaS, GaSe and InSe are 3.601, 3.780 and 4.045 Å, respectively, in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results and theoretical results calculated at the DFT+D level of theory (Table 1). Monolayers have a quadruple X–M–M–X atomic structure, as illustrated in the side view in Fig. 1a. From the top view, MXs monolayers share a double honeycomb structure as two M/X atoms along c direction are overlapped. The primitive hexagonal cell is labelled with black lines (Fig. 1a) and the corresponding first Brillouin zone is shown in Fig. 1b. Due to lack of interlayer interaction and so-called quantum confinement effect, the calculated lattice parameters of GaS, GaSe and InSe monolayers are larger than those of their bulk counterparts, which are 3.639, 3.821 and 4.100 Å, respectively, also in perfect accordance with previously calculated results (Table 1). To analyze the chemical bonding in MXs, the electron localization function (ELF) of GaSe48 is calculated as an example (Fig. 1c), where the values of 0 and 1 correspond to completely delocalized (or almost no electrons) and fully localized electrons, respectively, and 0.5 represents the distribution of electron-gas-like pairs. It can be seen that electron density around the X atom is completely localized as its ELF value is high. Moreover, the high ELF values between M–M indicate that they are strongly covalently bonded.

The electronic properties of bulk MXs and 2D monolayers are shown in Fig. 2. GaSe and InSe bulks display a direct bandgap feature at the Γ-point with band gaps ranging from 1.07 to 2.34 eV, while the VBM and CBM of GaS bulk locate on Γ- and M-point,6,49 respectively. Compared with experimental results, the calculated band gaps are systematically lower by 0.10–0.25 eV (Table 1). GaS, GaSe and InSe monolayers have indirect band gaps of 3.24, 2.65 and 2.12 eV, respectively, all of which are larger than those of the bulks due to the quantum confinement effect. Compared with results calculated at the same level in literature, the differences are within 0.1 eV, indicative of the calculation reliability (Table 1). The VBM positions are always located in the middle of Γ- and K-points for all MXs, while CBM positions are situated at the M-point for GaS and at the Γ-point for GaSe and InSe. Moreover, the top valence band forms a “Mexican-hat-like” shape around the Γ-point,50 which agrees with previous researches.43,51

Although the carrier mobilities are expected to be greatly improved with the decrease of dimension, band gaps of MXs monolayers are too large to effectively utilize solar energy as a suitable band gap of ∼2.0 eV is required for semiconductor catalyst of photocatalytic water splitting. Note that the electronic properties of 2D nanomaterials can be modified by altering the number of stacked layers.57,58 Thus, one can imagine that the band gaps of few-layer MXs can be modulated from those of bulks to those of monolayers, i.e., 2.34–3.24 eV for GaS, 1.85–2.65 eV for GaSe and 1.07–2.12 eV for InSe. The band gap of ∼2.0 eV is expected to be achieved at a certain layer number. In Table 1, the layer-dependent electronic band gaps of few-layer MXs are given.
For bilayer MXs, five possible stacking patterns are considered, namely AA, AB, AC, AD and AE, as shown in Fig. S1.† In Table S2,† we list the optimized lattice parameters and energy differences ΔE of bilayer and trilayer MXs with various stacking patterns. For bilayer GaS, AE stacking is most stable; however, for bilayer GaSe and InSe, AD stacking becomes the most stable with the energy preference of only 0.59 meV for GaSe and 4.2 meV for InSe. Note that this tiny energy difference is hard to capture using inappropriate vdW-DF functionals or calculating at a lower computational level, resulting in controversial preferential conformations in some references. Our predictions are supported by Li et al. and Yang et al., who have calculated at the same level of theory with consideration of dispersion forces.43,44 For trilayer MXs, four stacking patterns, i.e., AAA, ABA, ADA and AEA are considered. As described in the ESI and seen in Fig. S2 and Table S2,† AEA stacking is most stable for GaS while ADA is most stable for GaSe and InSe tri-layers. Likewise, ADAD⋯A and AEAE⋯A are sequentially superimposed for the preferred configurations of tetra-layer and penta-layer MXs.
In Table 1, all optimized lattice parameters, binding energies and band gaps of few-layer MXs with the most stable stacking are listed, along with available results calculated at the same HSE06 level in References. First, the calculated lattice parameters and band gaps of few-layer MXs are quite close to the values reported in ref. 5, 6, 29, 44, 49 and 51–55, with the exception of unavailable results of penta-layers. Second, the effect of quantum confinement on lattice parameters is significantly stronger than that of band gaps. As seen in Table 1, the lattice parameters converge to the values of bulk when two-layered MXs are formed. Although the band gap values fall between those of monolayer and bulk as expected, they still do not converge up to five layers.
To confirm the stabilities of these few-layer MXs, the interlayer binding energies are calculated through the formula Eb=(nE1 − En)/(nA), where E1 and En are the energies of monolayer and few-layer MXs, respectively, and A is the 2D unit cell surface area. The calculated Eb values are tabulated in Table 1 and the variation of Eb with the number of layers is illustrated in Fig. 3a. According to this definition, more positive Eb indicates more stability. From the Table, binding energies of all few-layer MXs are more than 60 meV Å−2. Compared with MoS2 (∼26 meV Å−2),59 MXs exhibit greater binding energies, indicative of higher stabilities. Moreover, from Fig. 3a, one can see the stabilities of MXs are in the order of GaS > GaSe > InSe. This situation is predictable as the corresponding electronegativity differences are 2.5–1.6 = 0.9, 2.4–1.6 = 0.8, and 2.4–1.7 = 0.7. In contrast to the fast convergence feature of lattice parameters, the binding energies converge slowly to the bulk value with the number of layers increasing, indicating that interlayer interaction plays an important role in stabilizing few-layer MX systems.
 Fig. 3  Binding energies (a) and band gaps (b) of layered MXs as a function of the number of layers. 
In Fig. S3,† all the band structures of few-layer MXs are depicted, and in Fig. 3b, the calculated band gaps as a function of layer numbers are given. As seen in Fig. S3,† band structure topologies of MXs are similar because of their identical geometric structures. It is interesting that with the increase in number of layers, few-layer GaSe and InSe gradually transition to a direct bandgap like their bulk counterparts, which is highly needed in optical devices as it can facilitate the efficiency of light absorption.16,56,58 As seen in Fig. 3b, the band gaps of MXs present the same sequence as the binding energies, i.e., GaS > GaSe > InSe. This is because the stronger covalent bonding strength and the resulting shorter bond length decreases the overlap of energy levels, thereby enlarging the energy splitting between the VBM and the CBM. In contrast to the enhanced stabilities toward the bulk limits, from 1 to 5L, the band gaps of MXs systematically decrease and gradually approach the limits of their bulk counterparts. Note that the band gaps are far from convergence for these group-III metal monochalcogenides. This is caused by two interplay factors: quantum confinement effect and interlayer coupling effect, as revealed by Sun et al.,58 who found that the band gap of 2D InSe converges up to ten layers because of the strong interlayer couplings. The slow variation of band gap with the number of layers leads to the electronic structures of MXs being subtly controlled by stacking with different thicknesses, providing a plausible way to modify the band gaps of these strong interlayer interaction systems.
Of particular concern is the search for materials with optimal band gaps around 2.0 eV. Obviously, the band gaps of GaSe with layer numbers of more than four and monolayer InSe are the most approximate (Table 1). Note that the requirement of 2.0 eV is optimal in utilizing the visible parts of solar energy, which does not mean 2D materials with other band gap values are impossible to be applied as water splitting photocatalysts. In fact, a broad range from ultraviolet, visible to near-infrared light photocatalysts are all needed for water splitting.
Besides the suitable band gaps for overall water splitting, the band edge positions need to straddle the oxidation potential of H2O and the reduction potential of H2. To further evaluate the photocatalytic abilities of 2D MXs, the valence and conduction band edge positions with respect to the vacuum level based on HSE06 calculations are presented in Fig. 4. As can be seen, at pH = 0, all monolayer MXs have suitable band edge positions for water splitting, suggesting that they could be applied in photocatalysis, in agreement with previously reported results.5 Among these, GaS monolayer can be used in the near-ultraviolet range as it has a larger band gap of 3.24 eV. GaSe has a lower band gap of 2.65 eV; thus it can be used in the visible range. Although InSe monolayer has the appropriate band edge position for overall water splitting in the visible range, the driving force toward H2 reduction is relatively weak. In particular, variation of pH would make it completely deactivated towards the H2 reduction (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Band edge positions of 1–5L MXs with respect to the vacuum level. Standard redox potentials for water splitting at pH = 0 and 7 are labeled by blue and red dotted lines, respectively. 
With the number of layers increasing, the VBM energy levels of all MXs significantly increase. In contrast, the energy changes in CBM are relatively small. The strong layer-dependent VBM energy may be caused by strong interlayer coupling, which is validated by a recent publication.60 Scrutinizing the variation of band edge position for each MX, we can see: (i) 2D GaS and GaSe meet the requirement of band edge position up to five layers; (ii) 2D InSe is inappropriate as an overall water splitting photocatalyst when the number of layers exceeds two due to deactivation towards H2 reduction reaction. Considering the variation of band gap values with the number of layers, few-layer GaS seems applicable as a near-ultraviolet or ultraviolet water splitting photocatalyst. Encouragingly, few-layer GaSe, especially N > 4, is what we seek, as it has both appropriate band edge position and optimal band gap value, which would be promising as overall water splitting catalyst in the visible range.
However, one may notice that the VBM position of few-layer GaSe is too close to the water oxidation potential, meaning that the thermodynamic force to drive this half-reaction is weak. Note that the hydrogen reduction potential of −4.44 eV and the water oxidation potential of −5.67 eV are standard results at the pH = 0 condition. Generally, such an acidic environment is not probable to be set in the experiment, and on some occasions compounds such as CdS and CdSe are unstable in acidic environments.24 It is known that the redox potentials of water splitting strongly depend on the pH of the solution. Therefore, we recalculated the redox potential of water splitting at pH = 7, using the formulae EH+/H2 = −4.44 eV + pH × 0.059 eV and EO2/H2O = −5.67 eV + pH × 0.059 eV. Realigning the band edge positions with the redox potentials at pH = 7 as shown in Fig. 4 (red dotted lines), it can be seen that few-layer GaSe retains its activity on overall water splitting, and importantly, the activity towards water oxidation reaction is significantly promoted, which makes few-layer GaSe a perfect photocatalyst for overall water splitting.
As a qualified photocatalyst in the visible range, the efficiency of optical absorption is of particular importance. Here, mono- and few-layer GaSe are chosen due to their suitable band gaps and band alignments. The dielectric functions are calculated based on HSE06 functional, and the optical absorption coefficients α are calculated by the formula:  where ε1 and ε2 represent the real part and the imaginary part of the dielectric function, respectively, as shown in Fig. S4.† It is well known that the optical properties of 2D materials are mainly predominated by the electron–hole interaction (exciton effect). To estimate the exciton binding energy, time-dependent Hartree–Fock (TDHF)61 computations are performed in order to obtain accurate dielectric functions. The exciton binding energies are calculated from the difference between the HSE06 band gaps and HSE06-TDHF optical gaps. Due to large computational burden, only mono- and bilayer GaSe are considered, and the obtained exciton binding energies are 0.10 and 0.06 eV, respectively. Such small exciton binding energies would facilitate exciton splitting into free charge carriers, which indicates that the 2D GaSe exhibits excellent energy conversion efficiency under visible-light irradiation.
To evaluate efficiency of incoming light absorption, the absorbance A of few-layer GaSe as a function of photon energy E is calculated according to:A(E) = 1 − e−α(E)d = 1 − e−2π(E/hc)ε2d,where α is the absorption coefficient, ε2 is the imaginary part of the dielectric function, and d is the thickness of the layers.

Fig. 5 shows the absorption coefficient α and the optical absorbance spectrum A(E) of the 1–5L GaSe. The main peak shows a red shift with the increase in the number of layers, in agreement with the band gap variation (Fig. 5a). The optical absorption coefficient of few-layer GaSe is approximately 105 cm−1 in the visible range (inset of Fig. 5a), showing an excellent absorption performance. Moreover, the absorbance A rises drastically with the increasing number of layers (Fig. 5b), indicating that few-layer GaSe enhances optical absorption.
 Fig. 5  The optical absorption coefficient α (a) and optical absorbance spectrum A(E) (b) of 1–5L GaSe. Absorption in the visible range is amplified in the insets. 
To further estimate energy conversion efficiency, the method developed by Shi et al.62 is used. The estimated upper limit of the converted power P is based on the overlap between the solar spectrum and the absorbance:  where λ is the photon wavelength, λmax is the longest wavelength that can be absorbed by few-layer GaSe and is determined by the following equation,  and W(λ) is the solar spectral irradiance at Air Mass 1.5.63A(λ) is the absorbance of the 2D materials and the term C(λ) is the conversion factor to account for the fraction of the photon energy converted to electronic energy,  where Eg is the minimum band gap of the 2D material.
As summarized in Table 2, the upper limits of the energy conversion efficiencies reach 0.29%, 0.43%, 0.62%, 0.82% and 1.11% for 1–5L GaSe, respectively, which are larger than that of MoS2 (0.27%).64 The increasing P with the number of layers indicates that few-layer GaSe can absorb more incident light, further confirming its bright prospects toward photocatalytic water splitting.

Carrier mobility is another important indicator for a good photocatalyst. Considering possible anisotropy, herein, an orthorhombic lattice is used instead of the hexagonal lattice to calculate the carrier mobilities of 1–5L GaSe (Table 3). The selected cell and corresponding first Brillouin zone are shown in Fig. 1a and b. To avoid a huge computational burden, the economic PBE functional is used as it has been confirmed to provide reliable data for carrier mobility, such as for graphene65 and 2D MoS2.66 The formula to calculate carrier mobility is given in the section of theoretical methods. We first calculate the elastic modulus C2D by parabolic fitting of the total energy shift as a function of the uniaxial strain along x and y directions (Fig. S5†). Then, the band edge positions of the VBM and CBM as a function of the uniaxial strain along x and y directions are linearly fitted to obtain the corresponding deformation potential constant E1 (Fig. S5†).

The obtained carrier effective masses (m*), C2D, E1 and the resulting carrier mobilities (μ2D) are listed in Table 3. We first analyze the effective mass. Three observations are seen: (i) electron has a lighter m* than hole; (ii) the value of m* is insensitive to the number of layers; (iii) the effective mass of electron shows a strong anisotropy. Careful examination of the carrier mobility results also yields three relevant observations: (i) the lighter m* does not mean higher μ2D; (ii) the value of μ2D is sensitive to the number of layers; (iii) the mobilities of both electrons and holes show relatively strong anisotropic features.
Specifically, the reason behind the first observation is that the values of μ2D are determined by three factors: m*, C2D, and E1. As seen in Fig. S5,† the CBM energy is very sensitive to external strain, which leads to excessively steep linear fittings. Thus, the resulting E1 values of electrons are 5–9 times than those of holes (Table 3). As μ2D is in inverse proportion with the square of E1, this difference brings a large variation in μ2D, which makes the lighter m* of electrons show smaller μ2D, although m* is directly proportional to μ2D. This scenario reminds one to be cautious when using the effective mass to measure carrier mobility. An analogous conclusion was also drawn for black arsenic–phosphorus monolayer.67 Moreover, the value of C2D linearly increases with the number of layers, which results in μ2D displaying a high sensitivity to the number of layers. Meanwhile, since m* of electrons along x is more than 2 times that of those along y direction, the mobility of electrons show a distinct anisotropy; however, although m* of hole has almost equivalent values for both x and y directions, the relative lower E1 along x direction for holes makes them also exhibit distinct anisotropy.
As seen in Table 3, the μ2D values of few-layer GaSe are more than 103 cm2 V−1s−1, which are much higher than those of monolayers and bulk counterparts, and also significantly larger than that of 2D MoS2 monolayer and nanoribbons (200 cm2 V−1s−1).68μ2D increases with the number of layers. High carrier mobility would result in rapid migration of photogenerated electrons and holes to the semiconductor surface to participate in the redox reaction. More importantly, the strong anisotropic features of carriers can lead to effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in space: electrons dominantly migrate along y direction whereas holes tend to migrate along x direction. In Fig. 6, we illustrate this observation, in which the electron–hole recombination possibility could be further reduced, resulting in photocatalytic activity enhancement for few-layer GaSe.

To further evaluate its practical application as photocatalyst, the stabilities of few-layer GaSe are investigated, in which the AIMD simulations at room temperature are employed, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 and S6.† After 10 ps simulation at 300 K, the atoms vibrate only slightly near their initial positions, indicating that few-layer GaSe is stable at room temperature.

It is known that the thermodynamics of hydrogen evolution reaction govern the rate of H2 production. Using tetra-layer GaSe as an example, it is found that H adsorption is energetically favorable as it has adsorption energy of −1.47 eV. With a remotely separated H adatom approaching, energy of the adsorbed system decreases by 1.05 eV (Fig. 8). Further aggregation of H atoms to form H2 molecules is highly exothermic with heat release of 2.82 eV. This value is comparable to that of H2 formation on 2D GeS surface24 but is more negative than that of H2 formation on 2D InSe surface.6 Finally, the formed H2 desorbs easily as the adsorption energy is calculated to be only −0.07 eV. The downhill feature of the energy profile demonstrates that H2 can be favorably generated on few-layer GaSe surface. These results further demonstrate that few-layer GaSe can indeed act as a new-generation photocatalyst with high capability for overall water splitting.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, on the basis of density functional theory computations, we systematically investigated the layer-dependent electronic properties and photocatalytic performance towards overall water splitting catalyzed by group-III metal monochalcogenide MXs. Our results show that with the increase in the number of layers, stabilities enhance to the limits of the bulk counterparts, whereas band gaps decrease to the limits of the bulk counterparts. The band gaps of few-layer MXs can be tuned in a wide range from those of monolayer to those of bulk, i.e., 3.24–2.34 eV for GaS, 2.65–1.85 eV for GaSe and 2.12–1.07 eV for InSe, from which a good photocatalyst for water splitting in the visible range with the optimal band gap of ∼2.0 eV is expected to be screened. Combined with another criterion that the band edge positions for overall water splitting photocatalysts need to straddle the oxidation potential of H2O and the reduction potential of H2, few-layer GaSe is found to be most suitable. Further calculations of optical absorption, effective mass, carrier mobility, stability as well as the activity of hydrogen evolution reaction validate that few-layer GaSe is indeed highly promising as overall water splitting photocatalyst in the visible range, especially at pH = 7.
