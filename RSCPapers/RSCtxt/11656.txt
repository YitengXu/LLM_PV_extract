    , Accepted 3rd October 2017First published on 4th October 2017AbstractOrganometal halide perovskites are emerging as potential materials for light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers due to their superior color purity, tunable band gaps, low cost and solution processability. However, the performance of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) is intrinsically limited by the poor morphology and undesirable trap states of the perovskite film, resulting in electric losses. Herein, we demonstrate a unique strategy to obtain high quality perovskite films through the integrated utilization of solvent engineering and moisture exposure. The synergistic effects of solvent engineering and moisture exposure could contribute to uniform and dense morphology meanwhile significantly reducing the trap density of the perovskite films. Strikingly, the controlled exposure to a relative humidity (RH) around 65% significantly improved the photoluminescence lifetime of the formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) film with α/δ phase junction from 14 ns to 35 ns. For the first time, we revealed that moisture treatment could be exploited in PeLEDs for significantly decreasing the trap density of perovskite films, thus enabling a fortyfold increase of external quantum efficiency from 0.03% up to 1.20% as well as a low turn-on voltage at 2.4 V. It is anticipated that this approach could be extended from FAPbI3 to other compositional perovskites and provide guidelines for optimum combination of moisture post-treatment to realize high-performance perovskite devices.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites have been intensively studied in various optoelectronic fields due to their superior electronic and optical properties in terms of excellent charge mobility, long exciton diffusion length, tunable band gap, broad light absorption, as well as solution processability and low cost.1–6 These perovskites have emerged as a strong candidate for solar cells, achieving an unprecedented rise in power conversion efficiencies (PCE) from 3.8% in liquid-based solar cells to over 20% in 5 years.1,6 Recently, these perovskites have also spurred growing attention as emitters in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to the superior color purity compared with organic counterparts.7–19 Very recently, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PeLEDs has boosted to over 8%,20–22 which indeed exploited the deep investigation of perovskites as emitters for LEDs. To improve the efficiency of PeLEDs, several groups prepared quasi-2D perovskites,10,21,22 such as MAxPEA1−xPbBr3 (MA = methylammonium, PEA = phenylethylammonium), MAxPEA1−xPbI3 or FAxNMA1−xPbI3 (FA = formamidinium, NMA = 1-naphthylmethylamine). PeLEDs based on the multiple quantum well exhibited a high efficiency up to 11.7% and fairly good stability.22 Most lately, Band et al. reported highly efficient PeLEDs based on the MAPbI3 system with an EQE of 10.4% and improved stability, which was achieved through the addition of long-chain ammonium halides in the precursor solution and thus the formation of self-assembled nanometre-sized crystallites.23 Meanwhile, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) were also utilized as emitters owing to the benefits of their colloidal state, such as access to quantum-size effects, the possibility of shape engineering, etc.24,25 The EQE of perovskite quantum dot LEDs based on CsPbBr3 has reached 6.2% with an emission peak located at 512 nm through balancing surface passivation and carrier injection via ligand density control.25
Previously, we have reported that the α/δ phase junction of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) by fine stoichiometry control could simultaneously enhance both photoluminescence (PL) and stability of the perovskite films, which might be an alternative way for realizing efficient and stable PeLEDs.26 Nevertheless, the preliminary performance of the PeLEDs based on such as-prepared films remained poor with EQE as low as 0.03%,26 which could be attributed to current leakage due to the poor surface coverage of the perovskite film.19 So far, efficient PeLEDs based on pure FAPbI3 film have not been realized. Normally, light emissions occur when injected electrons and holes meet in the perovskite layer and then radiatively recombine.14 However, it is easy for injected charges to bypass the perovskite layer through pinholes in the thin films, leading to non-radiative current losses and low efficiency.12–14 Therefore, a pinhole-free perovskite layer is one of the most important steps to ensure high-performance PeLEDs.
To date, anti-solvent engineering has been proven as an effective way to obtain highly uniform perovskite layers for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and PeLEDs.19–21,27–29 Lee et al. fabricated MAPbBr3 films with the assistance of chloroform to improve the morphology from scattered micrometer-sized cuboids to well packed nanograins with uniform coverage, which greatly reduced current leakage.20 Furthermore, the performance of PeLEDs could be severely curtailed by the trap-mediated non-radiative recombination dominating under weak excitation.21,22 Therefore, how to minimize trap density is another key issue to achieve more efficient PeLEDs. Snaith et al. have found that the trap states of perovskite films could be passivated through the treatment of the crystal surfaces with the Lewis bases thiophene and pyridine.29,30 However, the majority of Lewis bases are either poisonous or unfriendly to the environment. Moisture has been proven to be a double-edged sword for perovskite films and devices.31–33 Recently, several groups found that controlled moisture exposure could contribute to a reduction in the trap density and an increase in the PL of the perovskite films, thus improving the open-circuit voltages and the overall device performance of PSCs.31–33 As far as we know, moisture treatment has not been adopted in PeLEDs.
Inspired by this, for the first time we attempted to combine the moisture treatment and anti-solvent engineering to simultaneously improve the film coverage and inhibit the loss of PL by the undesirable trap states, thereby enabling highly efficient PeLEDs. Herein, the perovskite layer was the α/δ phase junction of FAPbI3 for near-infrared emission as previously reported.26 Highly uniform perovskite films with very few pinholes were obtained through chloroform solvent engineering (hereafter referred to as CSE). The nucleation, growth and uniform perovskite formation were promoted by the chloroform treatment during the fabricating process of the perovskite films. Especially, we found that further post-treatment of the perovskite films with optimal moisture exposure under 65% relative humidity (RH) could significantly improve the PL lifetime of the perovskite films from 14 ns to 35 ns. Confocal fluorescence microscopy correlated with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) revealed that such improvement originated from the significant decrease of trap density in the perovskite film. Electroluminescence at 769 nm was obtained with a maximum radiance of 0.72 W m−2 at 5.0 V and a maximum EQE of 1.20% at a current density of 13.9 mA cm−2.
Results and discussion
The FAPbI3 films with α/δ phase junction were readily prepared at a low annealing temperature (60 °C) from the stoichiometrically modified precursor (FAI:PbI2 = 1.2:1) as previously reported.26 In our previous work, we found that such α/δ phase junction could simultaneously enhance both PL and stability of the perovskite films compared with the pure α-FAPbI3.26 In this work, we performed further characterization of the composition of the as-prepared films. Firstly, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on the perovskite films with different stoichiometric ratios. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the Pb 4f spectra of the film with the optimal ratio (FAI:PbI2 = 1.2:1) showed two main peaks at ∼138 eV and ∼143 eV, which were attributed to the energy levels of Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2,20 respectively. However, for the control film prepared from the equimolar precursor (FAI:PbI2 = 1:1) and annealed at 170 °C to obtain α-FAPbI3, two additional peaks appeared around 136.4 eV and 141.3 eV. The two small shoulder peaks could be assigned to metallic Pb, which would degrade luminescence by increasing the non-radiative decay rate and decreasing the radiative decay rate.20,34 This result suggested that metallic Pb atoms in the perovskite films were successfully prevented by the appropriate excess of FAI in the precursor. Here, it is worth noting that no residue of excess FAI existed in the fresh film as revealed by the Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FTIR). As shown in Fig. 1b, for the pure FAI, the FTIR spectrum displayed two distinct transmittance peaks between 1000 cm−1 and 1050 cm−1.35 Similar peaks appeared in the perovskite film with FAI:PbI2 = 1:1, indicating the residue of FAI, which could be ascribed to the partial decomposition of FAPbI3 at high annealing temperature (170 °C) as previously reported.36,37 By comparison, those peaks were absent in the film with FAI:PbI2 = 1.2:1 at low annealing temperature (60 °C), indicating the complete removal of the excess FAI. On the one hand, some excess FAI might insert into the crystal lattice.26 On the other hand, the excess FAI could be consumed during air annealing.35 Overall, the adequate excess of FAI in the precursor prevented the formation of metallic Pb atoms, which would help to enhance the PL intensity.

For high-performance PeLEDs, uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films are required.12–14 Herein, solvent engineering with chloroform was employed for fabricating pinhole-free perovskite films. Firstly, we comparatively studied the morphology of the perovskite films with and without CSE under ambient conditions (30–50% RH) rather than under N2 conditions as previously reported.26 For the perovskite film without CSE, micrometer-sized cuboids were scattered on the PEDOT:PSS layer (Fig. 2a), where only a few cuboids interconnected and a large area of the surface remained uncovered. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2b, the perovskite films with CSE demonstrated perfect surface coverage with a well-packed assembly of tiny grains. The average grain size of the perovskite films was markedly decreased from around 750 nm without CSE to about 130 nm with CSE as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The crystal structures of perovskite films were further analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2c). The XRD patterns of FAPbI3 films both with and without CSE exhibited the diffraction peaks at 11.8°, 16.3° (corresponding to δ-FAPbI3) and 13.9° (belonging to α-FAPbI3). This result indicated that CSE treatment did not affect the α/δ phase junction of FAPbI3 even under ambient conditions.26,38 Notably, the crystallinity of the perovskite film with CSE was enhanced substantially as evidenced by the increase in the intensity of the perovskite peak. The optical properties of these FAPbI3 films were investigated by steady-state PL measurements (Fig. 2d). Strikingly, the relative PL intensity of the film with CSE was increased over 2-fold compared to the control film without CSE. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was then utilized to characterize the crystal morphology and optical behavior of the obtained FAPbI3 films. Notably, the perovskite films with CSE showed much denser and brighter morphology (Fig. S2, ESI†). Since the confocal images could qualitatively reflect the luminescence by the brightness of each film, the result was well consistent with the above SEM and PL spectra.39 To further explore their PL decay process, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was performed on these perovskite films (Fig. S2c, ESI†). The perovskite film with CSE exhibited a longer lifetime (14.0 ns) than the counterpart without CSE (11.4 ns), which indicated a reduction of non-radiative recombination due to its denser morphology.39–41 To conclude, CSE significantly improved the film morphology and enhanced the PL intensity.

Subsequently, we delved into the impact of moisture exposure on PL and morphology of the as-prepared FAPbI3 films. Here, firstly, all the perovskite films were treated by CSE and then annealed at 60 °C; secondly, all the films were then transferred into a chamber with controlled moisture (Fig. S3, ESI†). The relative humidity of the atmosphere in the chamber was controlled by systematically varying the volatilization velocity of the deionized water. We treated the films with moisture exposure in different ways. For clarity, we named the films as X% RH-Y min in the following discussion, where X represented the level of relative humidity, while Y represented the exposure time of the perovskite films. As revealed in Fig. 3a, the PL was markedly enhanced by simply storing the film in the chamber with RH of 65% for 30 min in comparison to the perovskite film without moisture treatment. The PL intensity reached its maximum for the film treated with 65% RH-60 min and decreased when further exposed for 90 min. Further increasing the humidity to 90% RH did cause complete PL quenching. Notably, there was a slight blue shift of 8 nm in the maximum peak of the original PL spectra (780 nm), which might be due to the reduced trap density as we would discuss later.39 In the meantime, we wondered whether the enhanced PL of the film via 65% RH-60 min moisture treatment would change after further heat treatment. Thus, we dried the film by heating at 65 °C in a dry nitrogen atmosphere for 60 min. Strikingly, the increased PL intensity of the film with the moisture treatment almost remained the same after the post-drying step (Fig. S4, ESI†) indicating that the beneficial effect of moisture treatment on PL is irreversible.

To better understand the compositional change during the moisture exposure, XRD patterns of the perovskite films treated under various conditions were measured. Fig. 3b shows that the α/δ phase junction still remained after 0% RH-60 min or 65% RH-60 min. This result was in accordance with the previous observation that the α/δ phase junction of FAPbI3 perovskite was stable under ambient conditions.26,38 However, for the film with RH 90%-30 min, the peak at 13.9° belonging to α-FAPbI3 disappeared, which indicated that α-FAPbI3 completely converted into δ-FAPbI3 due to the very high humidity.38 Indeed, we did observe an obvious color change from brown to yellow when the film was taken out from the chamber after the 90% RH-30 min treatment. The morphology of the films exposed to different humidity levels was further studied. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, there was almost no difference in both the grain size and film coverage of the FAPbI3 films treated with 65% RH-60 min and 0% RH-30 min. However, the surface grain size of the perovskite film in RH 90%-30 min tended to be enlarged due to the very high humidity up to 90% RH (Fig. S5, ESI†). In order to unveil how moisture affected the luminescent properties of the perovskite film, we performed in situ confocal fluorescence microscopy correlated with FLIM on the perovskite films. For this measurement, a 40 wt% solution of FAI:PbI2 = 1.2:1 in DMF was cast onto the glass substrate and then treated with CSE. Afterwards, the deionized water vapor treatment of the perovskite film was carried out using an automatic humidifier in a fume hood under ambient conditions. Fig. 4a–c shows the confocal images of the films before and after exposure to moisture. The entire film turned brighter after moisture exposure for 3 minutes. However, when the water vapor was further passed, the film gave no emission, which was proposed to result from the disappearance of α-FAPbI3 as discussed before. As shown in Fig. 4d, linear profiles of the emission intensity of the film demonstrated a notable increase of PL intensity due to adequate moisture exposure. Furthermore, we randomly selected two regions labeled as the blue square and yellow circle, respectively, and studied their local PL decays (Fig. 4e and f). The local PL lifetimes of both regions were 14.2 and 14.0 ns before moisture treatment, whereas their PL lifetimes significantly increased to 35.2 ns and 32.6 ns after adequate moisture exposure, respectively. In this light, adequate moisture exposure could substantially enhance PL intensity and carrier lifetime, providing great potential for improving the performance of the corresponding PeLEDs. Previous reports have found that moisture would induce the measurable formation of PbI2 which could lead to “self passivation” of perovskite crystallites and reduced recombination at the grain boundaries.42,43 However, in our cases, we did not detect the formation of PbI2 in the perovskite film after moisture exposure (Fig. S6, ESI†), which excluded the possible passivation by PbI2. The significantly enhanced PL intensity and carrier lifetime through adequate moisture exposure might be due to self-healing of the perovskite lattice.33

On the basis of the above observations, we fabricated PeLEDs based on the FAPbI3 film with CSE and compared them to the devices based on the FAPbI3 film with and without moisture exposure. The structure of our devices was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FAPbI3/4,6-bis(3,5-di(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-2-methylpyrimidine (B3YMPM)/Cs2CO3/Al, as illustrated in Fig. 5a. The EL spectra of the devices based on the moisture-exposed FAPbI3 films showed much higher intensity at the same voltage as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Besides, compared with the PL peak at 772 nm with moisture treatment and 780 nm without moisture treatment, there is a small blue-shift of the EL peak position at 769 nm with moisture treatment and at 777 nm without moisture treatment, which might result from a distribution of crystallite sizes with the smaller crystallites the more easily electrically populated.23 The shapes of the EL spectra with moisture treatment did not change at different bias voltages from 4 V to 9 V (Fig. S7, ESI†), indicating that the devices did not suffer from additional radiative recombination pathways. The current density versus voltage characteristics and the corresponding radiance of the PeLEDs are shown in Fig. 5c. For the device with CSE only, a clear turn-on of light emission was observed at 2.7 V. The value slightly dropped to 2.4 V after further moisture treatment, which should benefit from the reduction in trap density as evidenced by the significantly increased carrier lifetime. Also, the current density and luminance rose rapidly after turn-on, indicating efficient charge injections into the perovskite layer. In contrast, the turn-on voltage of the PeLED based on the FAPbI3 film without CSE treatment and moisture exposure reached 6 V.26 As shown in Fig. 5d, the EQE of the devices increased by more than 30-fold from 0.03% for the devices without CSE and moisture treatment to 0.94% for devices with CSE only, and an EQE of 1.20% was finally achieved by integrating CSE and moisture exposure.26 Thanks to the pinhole-free coverage of the perovskite films and the marked decrease of trap density with the assistance of CSE and moisture post treatment, the current density was reduced and the luminance was enhanced, thereby leading to a dramatic enhancement in device efficiency. The decline of EQE at high current density was attributed to the heating of the device under high current density.19,23 In comparison, we also fabricated PeLEDs based on the pure α-FAPbI3 perovskite film with CSE and moisture exposure (Fig. S8, ESI†), which exhibited a very low EQE around 0.0005%, indicating the unique superiority of the α/δ phase junction of FAPbI3 as previously reported.26 In addition, distributions of the device EQEs are displayed in Fig. S9 (ESI†), demonstrating good reproducibility of our devices.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a facile and simple strategy to realize pinhole-free perovskite films with significantly reduced trap density for enhanced PL and EL through the synergistic effects of chloroform solvent engineering and moisture exposure treatment. We found that the pinholes in the perovskite film were significantly inhibited through chloroform solvent treatment and subsequently the trap states within the perovskite film were remarkably reduced by means of adequate moisture exposure, thus enabling highly efficient PeLEDs. The PeLEDs with the as-prepared perovskite film based on the α/δ phase junction of FAPbI3 exhibited strong near-infrared EL at 769 nm and a fortyfold increase of external quantum efficiency from 0.03% up to 1.20%. This approach could also be extended from FAPbI3 to other compositional perovskites like MAPbBr3 (Fig. S10, ESI†) and provide guidelines for optimum integrated post-treatments to realize high-performance perovskite devices.
Experimental
Synthesis of perovskite precursors
Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used as received. Substrates were then cleaned sequentially in detergent, acetone, propan-2-ol and oxygen plasma. FAI was first prepared by directly mixing formamidine acetate and HI (45 wt% in water) at 0 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was collected by rotary drying at 65 °C for 30 min, which was followed by washing with a mixture of ethanol and diethyl ether by air pump filtration. The white solid was finally dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 2 days. Precursors with modified stoichiometry were prepared based on a fixed concentration of PbI2 at 1 M and molar ratios of FAI:PbI2 = 1.2:1.
Perovksite films and PeLED fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned successively with acetone and isopropanol, followed by 10 min oxygen plasma treatment. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was spin-coated onto the substrate at 3000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 200 °C for 10 min in an air atmosphere. The perovskite precursor solution (FAI:PbI2 = 1.2:1) was spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS at 4000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 60 °C for 15 min for obtaining the desirable α/δ phase junction and at 170 °C to obtain pure α-FAPbI3. 1 ml of chloroform was quickly added after 13–14 s and then the films were annealed at 60 °C for 15 min. Moisture post-treatments were carried out by leaving the films in a chamber with controlled moisture at room temperature for various time periods. B3PYMPM (4,6-bis(3,5-di(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-2-methylpyrimidine) as the electron-transport layer (30 nm), Cs2CO3 (2.5 nm) and Al (100 nm) were successively deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation. Devices were tested in N2 with encapsulation.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using Smart LAB instruments with the Cu Kα beam. Optical microscopy and spectroscopy were performed using a custom sample scanning confocal microscope by Olympus FV1200 fitted with an infinity-corrected 100× oil objective. For measuring the fluorescent lifetime, a 485 nm pulsed diode laser was used for excitation with repetition rates at 1 MHz. The steady-state PL spectra of the FAPbI3 films were measured by using a spectrofluorometer (FluoroMax-3) at room temperature. The morphology of the films was obtained on a Hitachi SU-8010 (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured using a PHI 5300 ESCA PerkinElmer spectrometer. All spectra were shifted to account for sample charging using inorganic carbon at 284.80 eV as a reference. The current–voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system and optical power was determined using a Newport 1936-C power meter coupled to a calibrated Newport 918D-UV-OD3 detector with a spectral response range from 200 to 1100 nm. The electroluminescence spectra of the PeLEDs were obtained using FluoroMax-3. The EQE of the PeLEDs was determined according to the literature method, by measuring the light intensity in the forward direction and assuming the external emission profile to be Lambertian.
