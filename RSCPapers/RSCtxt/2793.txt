    , Accepted 14th December 2022First published on 4th January 2023AbstractHighly efficient, environmentally friendly and renewable sources of energy are of great need today to combat increasing energy demands and environmental pollution. In this work, we have investigated the novel 2D allotropes, i.e., β-Te2X (X = S, Se), using first-principles calculations and study their potential applications in light harvesting devices. Both the monolayers possess high stability and semiconducting nature with an indirect band gap. The high carrier mobilities and excellent optical absorption of these monolayers make them potential candidates for solar conversion applications. We have proposed the type-II heterojunction solar cells and calculated their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The small conduction band offset and appropriate band gap of donor material in the case of β-Te2S(S-Side)/α-Te2S(Te-Side) heterojunction results in a PCE of ∼21%. In addition, the band alignments of these monolayers properly engulf the redox potentials of water. The overpotentials required to trigger hydrogen reduction (HER) and water oxidation (OER) half reactions reveal that HER and OER preferred acidic and neutral media, respectively. The calculated solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies of β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) monolayers turn out to be ∼13% (∼12%), respectively, which implies their practical applications in water splitting. Thus, our work provides strong evidence regarding the potential applications of these materials in the field of light harvesting devices.
1. Introduction
Clean and renewable energy sources have great relevance in today's economy and society in order to meet energy needs while lowering environmental issues. Solar energy conversion applications such as photovoltaics and photocatalytic water splitting can do wonders for the modern world. Since the discovery of solar cells in 1954,1 continuous efforts have been made by researchers to efficiently utilize solar energy. Excitonic solar cells have entered the mainstream in recent years due to their excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). These solar cells constitute type-II van der Waals heterostructures working on the donor–acceptor mechanism.2,3 The appropriate donor band gap (1.0–1.6 eV) and minimal conduction band offsets are the two main criteria for highly efficient solar cells.4 In addition to this, high migration and low recombination of photogenerated charge carriers enhance the PCEs of excitonic solar cells. These excitonic solar cells include the organic solar cells5–11 and inorganic two-dimensional (2D) heterojunction solar cells.12–14 In recent years since the discovery of graphene,15 two-dimensional (2D) excitonic solar cells have attracted a lot of interest because of their high carrier mobilities, tunable band gap, and good light harvesting capabilities.12–14,16
Apart from solar cells, photocatalytic water splitting is also a clean and renewable source of energy that can produce clean chemical hydrogen energy by utilizing solar energy. For an efficient photocatalyst, its solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency must exceed 10% for economical commercial use.17 In order to achieve such efficiency, the materials need to have high migration of charge carriers with low recombination, suitable band edge positions covering the redox potentials of water, and high solar energy harvesting capabilities. The majority of these properties are missing in conventional three-dimensional (3D) photocatalysts, leading to their low STH efficiency.18–21 In the last decade, 2D materials have emerged as efficient photocatalysts because of their high carrier mobilities with shorter migration paths, large surface area (leading to abundant active sites), and high light harvesting abilities.22–24 In addition to that, the tuning of their electronic properties with strain, functionalization, etc., can also be utilized to increase their STH efficiency.25,26 The first principles study has been widely used to predict the properties of novel 2D materials. For instance, the PdSeO3 monolayer was initially predicted to have potential use in photocatalytic water splitting applications27 which was experimentally synthesized later on.28 Similar research has been conducted on various 2D materials, including GeSe,29–31 GeTe,32,33 SnS2,34,35etc. Thus, the first principles investigation of 2D materials is widely accepted and acts as a fingerprint for experimentalists. Many 2D materials are therefore being investigated experimentally or theoretically for photocatalytic water splitting, including BN,36 phosphorene,37 PdSeO3,27 β-PdX2 (X= S, Se),38,39etc.
More intriguingly, a new class of 2D materials called Janus materials has an inherent electric field caused by out-of-plane asymmetry. Such intrinsic electric field improves the spatial distribution of charge carriers by reducing their recombinations, which is advantageous for applications involving efficient solar energy conversion.40 Additionally, these 2D Janus materials offer distinct atomic species for realizing the spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This results in boosting the STH efficiency of photocatalysts such as MoSSe,41 B2P6,42 WSSe,43 WSeTe,44 Pd4X3Y3 (X, Y = S, Se, and Te; X ≠ Y),45etc. Also, PCEs of heterojunction solar cells based on Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),46 In2SeTe,47 α-Te2S,48etc., are also found to be enhanced.
So far, mostly the solar energy conversion applications of Janus TMDs have been explored. However, monoelemental 2D materials from group VI have recently gained popularity due to their advantages over traditional 2D materials, including good stability, adequate band gap, and strong carrier mobilities.49–52 In this work, we have explored the Janus β-Te2X (X = S, Se) monolayers and their potential applications in photovoltaic and photocatalytic water splitting. Firstly, we have analyzed the stability of these monolayers by phonon and ab intio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Through indirect band gaps, the electronic properties have demonstrated their semiconducting nature. By creating type-II heterojunctions with other 2D materials, the solar cell applications of these monolayers are examined in the light of their semiconducting nature with suitable band gaps. Furthermore, the band alignments of these monolayers are found to straddle the redox potentials of the water. Thus, we have analyzed their ability for overall water splitting in terms of Gibbs free energy profiles in acidic and neutral media. Fortunately, these monolayers' STH efficiencies exceed the minimum criterion of 10% for commercial use. Finally, we examined the stacking effect on these monolayers' capacity for photocatalysis.
2. Computational details
The Quantum ESPRESSO package53 is used to perform the density functional theory (DFT)-based computations. For the treatment of electron-ion interactions and exchange–correlation energies, the projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials54 and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are employed, respectively. The plane wave energy cutoff of 80 Ry and k-point mesh of 16 × 16 × 1 is used for Brillouin zone integration. The structural parameters and atomic positions are relaxed up to the force and energy convergence of 10−6 eV Å−1 and 10−7 eV, respectively. A vacuum of 12 Å is applied to eliminate the unphysical forces between the neighboring layers along the z-direction. Using the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), the phonon dispersion is evaluated using a q-point mesh of 12 × 12 × 1 and a convergence threshold of 10−18 Ry.55 The AIMD simulations are done using the Nose–Hoover thermostat.56,57 The sophisticated HSE06 hybrid functional58 is used to evaluate the electronic properties that overcome the underestimation of band gap by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functionals.59 In order to deal with the long-range van der Waals interactions in heterostructures and bilayers, Grimme's DFT-D3 approach is used.60 The dipole corrections have been employed to evaluate vacuum potentials because of asymmetric layer arrangements of Janus structures. To evaluate the optical properties involving the exciton effects, the YAMBO code61 incorporated with the Quantum ESPRESSO package is used. After carrying out the DFT calculations, the G0W0 method is used to evaluate the quasi-particle energies using the plasmon-pole approximations. Then, the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) is solved to evaluate the dielectric response of the system involving the electron–hole interactions. The convergence is assured by taking the total of 200 bands and k-point mesh of 20 × 20 × 1. For obtaining the optical absorbance spectra, three valence bands and three conduction bands are used to solve the Bethe–Salpeter equations. Additionally, we employed the implicit solvent model in the Environ code62 of Quantum ESPRESSO utilizing the 78.3 dielectric constants for liquid water to account for solvent effects in simulations. The free energy and thermodynamic potential simulation details are provided in ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure and stability

Fig. 1 presents the optimized structures of Janus β-Te2X (X = S, Se) monolayers. It consists of alternatively arranged four and six-membered rings similar to that of β-Te49 with the replacement of one surface Te atom with the X (S, Se) atom. The central Te atom (marked by position 1, Fig. 1) is coordinated to four neighboring atoms, while the surface Te and X atoms are coordinated to three neighboring atoms (marked by position 2, Fig. 1). The relaxed lattice vectors of the β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) rectangular unit cell are as follows: a = 4.08 Å (4.10 Å), b = 5.30 Å (5.46 Å) and the out of plane thickness ‘d’ is 1.82 Å (1.92 Å). These lattice parameters show slight contraction when compared to their pristine monolayer β-Te (a = 4.22 Å, b = 5.69 Å and d = 2.07 Å), which is due to the smaller size of the X atom compared to that of the Te atom. The replacement of Te atom with X atom induces an intrinsic electric field from Te to the X atom due to the electronegative difference of the surface atoms. This intrinsic electric field causes the potential difference (ΔV) of 0.88 eV (0.52 eV) between the Te and S (Se) sides (Fig. S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Top and side views of the crystal structure of β-Te2X (X = S, Se) monolayers. 
We have now examined the stability of Janus β-Te2X (X = S, Se) monolayers. Firstly, we have calculated the cohesive energy (Ecoh) of monolayers as, Ecoh = (2ETe + EX − ETe2X)/3, where ETe, EX and ETe2X are the total energies of single Te, X, atom and β-Te2X unit cell, respectively. The cohesive energy values of β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) are 3.37 eV per atom (3.21 eV per atom), which is higher than that of β-Te (3.06 eV per atom) and α-Te (3.05 eV per atom),52 suggesting that Janus β-Te2X (X = S, Se) monolayers are energetically stable.
Furthermore, we have assessed the dynamic stability of these monolayers in terms of phonon spectrum over the Brillouin zone, as shown in Fig. S2(a and c), ESI.† The absence of substantial imaginary phonon modes in the spectrum indicates the kinetic stability of these monolayers. The small negative frequencies in the vicinity of the Gamma (Γ) point may be considered as the soft modes, which are the artifact of the computational parameters.63,64 The thermal stability of these monolayers is analyzed by AIMD simulations that have been done with a relatively large supercell (4 × 4 × 1) for 5000 fs at 300 K with a time step of 3 fs (Fig. S2(b and d), ESI†). The smaller fluctuations of total energy and temperature around the constant level with the time and preserved crystal structures after 5000 fs (inset of Fig. S2(b and d), ESI†) suggests the thermal stability of these monolayers.
Also, the mechanical stability of these monolayers is assessed in terms of stress-strain curves (Fig. S3, ESI†). The uniaxial strain is applied along the x and y-directions, corresponding to which the maximum tensile strength and strain are evaluated. The axis orthogonal to the stress direction is fully relaxed to make sure that the applied strain is uniaxial. To overcome the dimensional constraint, the equivalent stress is obtained by rescaling it with z/d0, where z is the vacuum length along the z-direction and d0 is the effective thickness of the system.65,66 The obtained values for maximum stress along the x and y-directions of β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) are 1.16 GPa (1.27 GPa) and 7.05 GPa (7.57 GPa), corresponding to the critical strain limits of 12% (10%) and 20% (34%), respectively (Fig. S3(a and c), ESI†). All these values are smaller than the corresponding values for β-Te,67 especially along the x-direction. This is due to the smaller Te-X bonds as compared to that of Te–Te bonds and their tendency to transform into the 1D helical atomic chains68,69 when strained along the x-direction. The obtained values of Young's modulus of β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) are 16.16 GPa (17.81GPa) and 37.34 GPa (30.08 GPa) along the x and y-directions, respectively. The difference in Young's modulus along the x and y-directions can be attributed to the anisotropic response to strain in β-Te2X (X = S, Se) monolayers (Fig. S3(a and c), ESI†). This anisotropic response is due to the tetragonal crystal structure, which creates a large puckered structure along the y-direction, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Additionally, it appears from the charge density analysis of β-Te2X (X = S, Se) monolayers (Fig. S4, ESI†) that the charge distribution along the x and y-directions is distinct. The more localized charge distribution along the x-direction compared to the overlapping distribution along the y-direction results in the formation of anti-bonding and bonding-like states along the x and y-directions, respectively. Because bonding states are stronger than anti-bonding states, it is therefore more difficult to stretch along the y-direction than the x-direction. This causes the stress–strain curve to have a greater slope along the y-direction, which results in higher Young's modulus values and less flexibility along the y-direction than the x-direction. Also, the smaller stress of β-Te2S as compared to β-Te2Se monolayers is due to the difference in the atomic radius and electronegativity of sulfur and selenium atoms that results in different bonding strengths in these monolayers. We have also calculated the Poisson ratio values from transverse-axial strain relation (Fig. S3(b, d), ESI†), which are 0.24 (0.31) and 0.22 (0.24) along the x and y-directions, respectively. These results indicate the anisotropic and higher mechanical flexibility of Janus monolayers as compared to their pristine counterpart, i.e., β-Te.
3.2 Optoelectronic properties

3.2.1 Electronic band structure. 
After the confirmation of the stability of β-Te2X monolayers, we examined their optoelectronic properties. Firstly, the electronic band structures depict the semiconducting nature of β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) monolayers with an indirect band gap of 2.12 eV (2.05 eV) with hybrid HSE06 functional (Fig. 2). Note that GGA-PBE band gap of β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) monolayers are calculated to be 1.49 eV (1.41 eV). The valence band maximum (VBM) is located at the Γ point, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is located between the Y and Γ points in the Brillouin zone. The projected density of states (PDOS) indicates that the VBM is mainly contributed by the p-orbitals of surface Te and X atoms, while the CBM is contributed by a mixture of p-orbitals of all the atoms. Due to the heavy Te atom, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect is depicted with the GGA + PBE level of theory. The SOC effect results in the slight reduction of band gaps (0.11 eV and 0.17 eV for β-Te2S and β-Te2Se monolayers, respectively) due to the splitting of the bottom of the conduction band (Fig. S5, ESI†). Such a reduction of band gaps is unlikely to affect the overall results regarding the band alignments of the monolayers. Therefore, computationally intensive calculations of SOC impacts are not taken into consideration for further study.

3.2.2 Carrier mobilities. 
The transportation of charge carriers is a very important aspect of materials for their applications in light harvesting devices. We have evaluated the migration of charge carriers in terms of carrier mobilities (μ) using the deformation potential theory according to the longitudinal acoustic phonon limited model proposed by Lang et al.,70 as: (1)where, C2D, m, and E are the elastic modulus, effective mass, and deformation potential of carriers (a = electron or hole) and these have been assessed by fitting the curves between energy and strain (Fig. S6(a–d), ESI†). Our calculated results reveal the carrier mobilities of holes (∼103 cm2 V−1 s−1) are one order higher than that of electrons (102 cm2 V−1 s−1). The values of carrier mobilities are listed in Table 1. Such higher carrier mobilities are mainly due to their smaller effective masses and demonstrate the high migration capability of charge carriers. The difference in the mobilities of holes and electrons is primarily caused by their different effective masses, which changes their diffusion lengths (Lp = (μkbt/e)1/2) and prevents carriers from recombining.71 The efficiency of light harvesting devices will therefore be improved by these materials' high carrier mobilities and low carrier recombination rates. These mobilities are comparable to that of β-Te49 and higher than that of TMDs such as MoS2, MoTe2, WS2, etc. (∼102 cm2 V−1 s−1).72,73

3.2.3 Optical response. 
Next, we have calculated the optical absorbance of β-Te2X monolayers to provide an intuitive representation of its light-harvesting capabilities. We used the G0W0+ BSE approach, which takes into account the exciton effects to calculate the optical absorbance (A(ω)) of the monolayers. We have used the following equation to evaluate A(ω) from the imaginary part of the dielectric function (ε2(ω)) (Fig. S7 (a, c), ESI†):74,75 (2)where L is the length of cell in the z-direction.
The absorbance spectra of both the monolayers cover most of the UV-visible region (∼2–8 eV), with the first prominent peaks lying in the visible region (Fig. 3). Thus, it indicates that both the monolayers have a remarkable capacity for light harvesting. The inherent structural anisotropy of β-Te2X (X = S, Se) monolayers is responsible for the anisotropic optical absorbance. Due to this structural anisotropy, charges are localized differently along the x and y-directions (Fig. S4, ESI†), which results in differing band dispersions along the x and y-directions (Fig. S7 (b and d), ESI†). Different band dispersions cause the change in effective masses of electrons and holes that leads to change in e–h interactions and hence results in different optical absorbance spectra along x and y-directions. To ensure adequate free photo-excited carriers, the photon absorbed electron–hole pairs must be efficiently separated. For this, the exciton binding energy (Eb) is a very important parameter, which is calculated as Eb = EQP − EOPT, where EQP is the direct quasi-particle band gap and EOPT is the optical gap corresponding to the first absorption peak. The quasi-particle band structures are shown in Fig. S7 (b and d), ESI.† Our calculated exciton binding energies for β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) monolayers are 0.48 eV (0.40 eV), which are smaller than that of β-Te (0.84 eV).76 Due to the difference in the electronegativities of surface atoms, the built-in electric field causes lower exciton binding energies of Janus monolayers. The more electronegative atom (X = S, Se) will attract the electrons towards itself, resulting in the reduction of electron–hole recombination and lowering their binding energies. As a result, these monolayers have a greater potential for extremely effective energy conversion applications.

3.3 Excitonic solar cells
Next, we have explored these monolayers for their applications in heterojunction solar cells because of their semiconducting nature, high carrier mobility, and good light harvesting capability. Four type-II van der Waals heterostructures made up of minimal lattice-mismatching β-Te2X (X = S, Se), α-Te2S, and H-MoX2 (X = S, Se) monolayers, have been proposed (Fig. S8, ESI†). The lattice parameters, band gaps, and band dispersions of constituent monolayers are given in ESI† (Table S1 and Fig. S9). The low binding energies and larger interlayer distance demonstrate the van der Waals interactions between the constituent monolayers (Table S2, ESI†). Therefore, the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of individual monolayers will remain preserved in the heterojunctions. Thus, we have used the Anderson method77 to evaluate the conduction band offsets (ΔEc) by utilizing the band alignments of monolayers constituting the heterostructures.78,79 The different surface atoms result in the electrostatic potential difference and will induce band bending. As a result, we examined the band edge positions in relation to the vacuum levels on different surfaces that make up S, Se, and Te atoms (Fig. 4(a–d)). The smaller ΔEc and appropriate band gap of donor material will result in highly efficient solar cells. Fortunately, our proposed heterojunction (β-Te2S(S-Side)/α-Te2S(Te-Side) has very small ΔEc (0.08 eV) and appropriate donor band gap of 1.49 eV that will result in highly efficient heterojunction solar cell. Note that in heterojunction solar cells, the materials that have a greater (lower) CBM value compared to the CBM of the other materials in the type-II heterostructures serve as donors (acceptors).

The PCEs of our proposed heterojunction are calculated by the widely used method proposed by Scharber et al.80 At 100% external quantum efficiency, PCE's highest limit can be formulated as follows: (3)where βff, Voc, Jsc and Psolar are the band fill factor, open circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and total incident solar energy, respectively.
All these values are evaluated with the help of the above formalism using the donor band gap (Eg), ΔEc, and air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) solar energy flux at energy ħw (P(ħw)). The βff is approximated to be 0.65 using the Shockley–Queisser limit.2 The β-Te2S(S-Side)/α-Te2S(Te-Side) heterojunction has the maximum PCE (21.13%) from our proposed heterostructures attributed to its outstanding open circuit voltage (1.11 V), lower ΔEc, and appropriate donor band gap. The PCE of our proposed heterojunctions are depicted in Fig. 4 as a function of ΔEc and Eg and their values corresponding to Voc are listed in Table S2, ESI.† The PCEs of other heterojunction solar cells are listed in Table 2 for comparison. The PCEs of the suggested heterojunctions are comparable to or higher than many of the previously reported heterojunction solar cells.

3.4 Photocatalytic properties of β-Te2X
Next, we investigated the band alignments with respect to vacuum levels to unveil the photocatalytic properties of β-Te2X monolayers. In general, the material must have a band gap between 1.23 eV and 3 eV, provided that its VBM and CBM must span the water oxidation (−5.67 eV at pH = 0) and reduction (−4.44 eV at pH = 0) potentials, respectively to act as a water splitting photocatalyst. However, because the different surface sides of Janus materials offer different vacuum levels, they work in concert to enable the HER and OER. In our case, the conduction band edge of the Te-side and the valence band edge of the X-sides both exceed the redox potentials, providing sufficient activity for HER and OER, respectively (Fig. 5a). The external potentials of photogenerated carriers that directly impact the photocatalytic activity are calculated according to previous literature.27,43 The potential of photogenerated electrons (Ue) for HER (difference between conduction band edge and hydrogen reduction potential) and holes (Uh) for OER (difference between conduction band edge and hydrogen reduction potential) at pH = 0 are calculated to be 1.40 eV (1.31 eV) and 1.60 eV (1.26 eV), respectively, for β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) monolayers. The reduction potential will alter as a function of pH as; −4.44 + 0.059 × pH (eV). As a result, an increase in pH will cause the potential of photogenerated holes (electrons) to rise (fall). At pH = 7, the values of Ue and Uh for β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) monolayers come out to be 0.99 eV (0.90 eV) and 2.01 eV (1.67 eV), respectively. The positive values of Ue and Uh are an indicator of the possible photocatalytic activity of these monolayers in neutral and acidic environments.

(b) Proposed photocatalytic pathways and the atomic configuration of absorbed intermediate species for hydrogen reduction (HER) and water oxidation (OER). (Note: white balls = hydrogen atoms; red balls = Oxygen atoms). 
Further, we assess the stability of photocatalyst in the aqueous solution under illumination using the method proposed by Chen et al.86 We have calculated the thermodynamic oxidation (ϕox) and reduction (ϕre) potentials shown by violet and red lines in Fig. 5(a). The calculation details can be found in ESI.† For both the monolayers, the ϕox (ϕre) is lower (higher) than that of the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (reduction potential of H+/H2). This implies that the photogenerated carriers will reduce or oxidize the water molecules rather than the photocatalyst.86 As a result, the β-Te2X monolayers exhibit good photoinduced corrosion resistance. In addition to the suitable band edge positions and stability in an aqueous solution of β-Te2X monolayers, the feasibility of adsorption of water molecules on the surfaces of these monolayers also needs to be examined. This has been done by evaluating the adsorption energies of water molecules using a model of one H2O molecule adsorbed on a 2 × 2 supercell of β-Te2X. The adsorption energy (Eads) is calculated as: Eads = E*H2O − E* − EH2O(4)where E*H2O, E* and EH2O are the total energies of adsorbed monolayer with adsorbed H2O molecule, a pristine monolayer, and a water molecule, respectively. Fig. S10, ESI† shows the H2O adsorption structures on both (Te and X) surfaces. The adsorption energies on the Te and X sides of β-Te2X are calculated to be approximately −0.15 eV and −0.10 eV, respectively. The negative adsorption energies indicate the feasibility of water adsorption on β-Te2X monolayers.

3.4.1 Overall water splitting of β-Te2X monolayers. 
In addition to the suitable band edge positions, the photogenerated electrons and holes in the β-Te2X monolayers need to have a sufficient driving force to initiate the overall water splitting. To this purpose, in order to acquire a better understanding of the photocatalytic activity of β-Te2X monolayers, we methodically explored the mechanisms and Gibbs free energy profiles of both the half-reactions of hydrogen reduction and water oxidation. The details of the computations are given in ESI.† Note that in order to characterize the thermodynamics of chemical processes at the solid/liquid interfaces, we also incorporate the solvation effects.
Firstly, we will discuss the much simpler hydrogen reduction (HER) on the Te-side of the β-Te2X monolayer, which is a two-step process, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The first step involves the combination of proton and electron with β-Te2X monolayer to form the *H species; the second step is accompanied by the release of H2 molecule when the *H species bond with the proton and electron. The first step is endothermic (at pH = 0, 3, 7, U = 0) with positive values of free energy change (HER barrier), while the second step is exothermic. Thus, the first step is not energetically favorable in the absence of light irradiation (U = 0). However, under the potential of photogenerated electrons (U = 1.40 eV and 1.31 eV for β-Te2S and β-Te2Se, respectively), both the steps at pH = 0 become downhill, making the HER feasible in the acidic medium under illumination (Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 7(a)). At pH = 7, external potential (ηHER) of 0.65 eV (0.73 eV) for β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) is required to trigger the HER (Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 7(b)) and is less than that of SiP2 (0.83 eV),87 PE-AgBiP2Se6 (1.06 eV),88 and FE-AgBiP2Se6 (1.62 eV).88 This is due to the fact that an increase in pH lowers the potential of photogenerated electrons and raises the HER barrier. It can be concluded that the HER is more feasible on the Te-side of β-Te2X in the acidic medium than in the neutral medium.
 Fig. 6  The free-energy changes for (a and b) HER and (c and d) OER at pH = 0, 7 of the β–Te2S monolayer. The blue, violet, and green lines represent the situation without any light irradiation, with light irradiation (at potential of photogenerated carriers), and with external potentials, respectively. 
 Fig. 7  The free-energy changes for (a and b) HER and (c and d) OER at pH = 0, 7 of β–Te2Se monolayer. The blue, violet, and green lines represent the situation without any light irradiation, with light irradiation (at potential of photogenerated carriers) and with external potentials, respectively. 
The half reaction of water oxidation (OER) is a four-step reaction that takes place on the X-side of β-Te2X monolayers, as shown in Fig. 5(b). In the first step, the oxidation of water molecule takes place to form *OH species; in the second step, *OH species is oxidized to *O species with the release of proton and electron; the third step is accompanied by the oxidation of *O species with another water molecule to form *OOH species; finally, the free oxygen molecule is released by the oxidation of *OOH species. The corresponding free energy profiles at pH = 0, 7 are given in Fig. 6(c-d) and Fig. 7(c-d). The step involved in the formation of *OOH species (third step) at pH = 0, 3, 7, U = 0 has the maximum free energy change that can be considered as an OER barrier. In the presence of potential photogenerated holes, the third step remains uphill at pH = 0, 3, 7. Thus, to make all the steps exothermic and oxidation half reaction feasible on the X-side of β-Te2X monolayers, an external potential is required (ηOER). With the decrease in the OER barrier and increase in the potential of photogenerated holes with an increase in pH, the required external potential to trigger the oxidation half reaction decreases. The values of ηOER lower down from 2.01 eV (1.30 eV) to 1.25 eV (0.48 eV) for β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) with the change in pH from 0 to 7. The values of ηOER in the neutral medium are lower than that of many reported 2D materials such as GaAs (1.39 eV),89 g-C3N4 (1.45 eV),90 CuCl (1.53 eV),91etc. This implies that the neutral medium is more favorable than the acidic medium for OER. Note that the free energy profiles of β-Te2X monolayer for HER and OER at pH = 3 are also provided in ESI† (Fig. S11 and Fig. S12). Note that the external potentials required to initiate the HER and OER can be reduced for efficient photocatalytic activity by using several strategies, such as single-atom catalysts,92 defect engineering,93 strain engineering,94etc.


3.4.2 Solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. 
In β-Te2X monolayers, the active sites for HER and OER are on two different surfaces, which points to these monolayers as potential candidates for efficient photocatalytic characteristics. The STH efficiency (ηSTH) is a standard tool to measure the performance of a material as a photocatalyst that depends upon the band gap and overpotentials for HER (χ(H2)) and OER (χ(O2)). The ηSTH is calculated as ηabs × ηcu, where ηabs and ηcu are light absorption and carrier utilization efficiencies, respectively. The ηabs mainly depends upon the band gap values and for higher ηcu, the χ(H2)and χ(O2) should have the appropriate levels. The calculation details of ηabs and ηcu are given in ESI.† In Janus materials, the intrinsic electric field that facilitates the electron-hole migration is also taken into account in terms of potential difference (ΔV) and the corrected STH efficiency (ηSTH)40 is given by: (5)
The corrected STH efficiencies at different pH values are listed in Table S5, ESI,† as a function of χ(H2) and χ(O2). The light absorption efficiencies of β-Te2X monolayers are higher than 30% and carrier utilization efficiencies of β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) monolayers reach up to 47.29% (37.58%) at pH = 7. As a consequence, the maximum corrected STH efficiencies of β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) monolayers at pH = 7 are 13.46% (12.09%), respectively. These values fulfill the 10% efficiency criteria for producing hydrogen for commercial use by photocatalytic water splitting.17
Additionally, we compared our computed STH efficiencies with previously reported values, and the results demonstrate that they are on par with or even higher than those of many reported 2D materials. (Table S6, ESI†).

3.5 Photocatalytic ability of β-Te2X bilayers
Further, we have proposed different stacking patterns of β-Te2X bilayers and analyzed the photocatalytic ability of the most stable configurations in terms of their band alignments. The six kinds of stacking models denoted by AAn and ABn (n = 1, 2, 3) are depicted in Fig. S13, ESI.† Firstly, we have analyzed the stability of these bilayers by calculating their binding energies (Eb) as: Eb = 2Emonolayer − Ebilayer(6) where Emonolayer and Ebilayer are the total energies of monolayer and bilayer, respectively. The values of binding energies and their interlayer distances are listed in Table S7, ESI.† The values of binding energies imply that the AB stacking models are more stable than the AA stacking models. We can divide these six stacking patterns into two types depending upon the electrostatic potential difference (ΔV): AA1 and AB1; AA2, AA3, AB2 and AB3 patterns. The former type has almost double the ΔV as that of corresponding monolayers, while the latter type has zero ΔV because of the healing of out-of-plane symmetry breaking of monolayers (Fig. S14 and Table S7, ESI†). Out of these two types, we have chosen AB1 and AB3 stacking patterns depending upon their binding energies and electrostatic potential differences.
To analyze the photocatalytic ability of these bilayers, we have studied their electronic properties using HSE06 functional. The electronic band gaps of AB1 and AB3 stacking patterns are 1.36 eV (1.18 eV) and 1.58 eV (1.28 eV) for β-Te2S (β-Te2Se) bilayers, respectively (Fig. S15, ESI†). The band alignments with respect to vacuum levels of β-Te2X bilayers are shown in Fig. 8, which demonstrates that only the AB1 stacking of β-Te2S has proper band edge positions for photocatalytic activity over a pH range of 0 to 7, with Te- and S-sides suitable for HER and OER. However, the AB3 stacking of β-Te2S can show photocatalytic properties in acidic medium, while the bilayers of β-Te2Se do not have the proper band alignments for photocatalytic properties.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a comprehensive study based on first-principles calculations on 2D β-Te2X (X = S, Se) monolayers has been performed for their potential applications in photovoltaic and photocatalytic water splitting applications. Firstly, these monolayers are found to exhibit energetic, dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stability. The optoelectronic properties revealed their semiconducting nature with high carrier mobilities and pronounced light absorption abilities. The proposed heterojunction solar cells based on these monolayers exhibit high PCEs, especially in the case of the β-Te2S(S-Side)/α-Te2S(Te-Side) heterojunction in which the PCE reaches up to 21.13%. Further, we have investigated their photocatalytic properties as the redox potentials of water are found to be within the band edge positions relative to different surface vacuum potentials. The Gibbs free energy profiles reveal that the HER can proceed spontaneously in acidic medium under illumination. However, the external potentials of 0.65 eV and 0.73 eV are required in cases of β-Te2S and β-Te2Se, respectively, to trigger the HER in the neutral medium. In contrast to the HER, the OER is more favorable in a neutral medium with required external potentials of 1.25 eV and 0.48 eV for β-Te2S and β-Te2Se, respectively. Greater than 10% STH efficiency of these monolayers in the neutral environment describes their potential practical applications in the commercial production of hydrogen. At last, the stacking impact on these monolayers' photocatalytic activity shows that only bilayers of β-Te2S have the proper band alignments for photocatalytic water splitting. Thus, these monolayers can be a potential candidate for futuristic solar energy conversion devices.
