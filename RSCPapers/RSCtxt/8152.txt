1. Introduction
With the fast growing gap between the world's energy demand and fossil fuel resource consumptions, as well as the worsening environmental conditions, the field of renewable energy has become a research hot spot. Electrochemistry, a traditional discipline comprising of batteries,1–5 supercapacitors,6–8 electrocatalysts,9–13 and so on, has been developing to address these problems due to its environmental benignity, sustainability, and compatibility with current energy infrastructures. Present research foci of this area include: (1) lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors featuring long operation life and a tunable balance between energy density and power density, (2) electrochemical water splitting to generate hydrogen as a fuel, and (3) oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in fuel cells. These studies are among the ongoing endeavors towards electrochemical energy storage for portable electronics14 and solar energy utilization.15–18 However, current energy conversion and storage materials are often subject to low electrical conductivity and poor durability, which can severely impede their performances.19,20 For example, the considerable volume change of LIB electrodes of transition-metal oxides occurs via the reversible intercalation of Li ions during charging and discharging cycles, resulting in gradual structure and performance degradation.21,22 For electrocatalysts, the lack of surface reactive sites and inferior charge transport capabilities pose a substantial barrier on the realization of effective electrocatalysts with scalability.23 In this regard, developing efficient and economical energy storage, conversion materials, and devices for large-scale industrial applications has, and will, become central to current and future research.
Nanoscopic materials possess short path lengths for the transport of electrons and ions, which generate fast charge–discharge rates, excellent conductivity, and can better overcome mechanical strain compared to bulk materials.24 Nonetheless, they are still prone to adverse side reactions due to their high surface area, large surface free energy, and low volumetric energy density caused by the inferior packing of the particles.25 Similarly, in fuel cells and water-splitting devices, the nanoscopic materials’ high surface area, controllable size and composition, and structure and surface engineering enable more reactive sites and tunable catalytic activities, while the undesirable secondary reactions still impact the selectivity of the targeted product.26
One effective method to alleviate these undesirable effects is to incorporate nanoscopic materials with a carbon framework. A variety of synthetic approaches have been reported for NP/carbon nanocomposites.27–29 Among them, carbon-coated NP superlattices are a recently developed material architecture for energy applications. NP superlattices are highly-ordered, close-packed NPs with long-range periodicity, whose lattice structures resemble atomic lattices but are fundamentally different. The interaction in atomic lattices involves strong chemical bonds, while the neighboring NPs in NP superlattices are linked via weak van der Waals interactions. The self-assembly of NPs into superlattice structures was first reported for Au30 and CdSe31 NPs around two decades ago. Since then, a large range of semiconducting,31–33 metallic,30,34–36 and magnetic37–39 NP-based superlattices, with single or multi-component NPs,40–42 have been obtained in one-dimensional (Fig. 1a),43,44 two-dimensional (Fig. 1b and c),42,45 and three-dimensional forms (Fig. 1d–f).38,46–48 NP superlattices were originally studied for their collective optical phenomena, where NPs within the superlattice structures do not have to be electrically-conductive.49 However, to be applied in energy conversion and storage, the electrical conductivity of the materials is one crucial requirement. Thus, carbon-coating is adopted mainly to play the role of a conduction framework. Carbon-coated NP superlattices boost the advantages of colloidal NPs, such as well-controlled size, shape, composition and structure, and the ordered organization of NPs within the superlattice context provides predictable control over the geometry, structure, and electronic effects for energy conversion and storage applications.24 Moreover, transformation of the organic surfactants of NPs into carbon coating layers of NP superlattices can avoid the process of removing surfactants from NP surfaces and the addition of carbon support materials, making carbon-coated NP superlattices more economical and environmentally friendly. The integration of carbon with NP superlattices enables enhanced electrical conductivity, high tensile strength, and inertness to undesirable side reactions at the interfaces between NPs and electrolyte. Thus, the carbon-coated NP superlattices inherit the merits of NPs superlattices such as tailorable components, well-defined interparticle spacing, and high volumetric packing density that differ from their isolated/disordered NP counterparts. A typical way to synthesize the carbon-coated nanoparticle superlattices is by a solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly method followed by annealing.23,50 Monodisperse metal/metal oxide nanoparticles with surface-coated ligands are first synthesized from a metal–oleate complex precursor via a micellization and nucleation process,51,52 which is critical for the subsequent assembly of highly ordered superlattices. With a slow evaporation of solvent, the ligand-coated nanoparticles are assembled into a highly ordered superlattice structure, which is subsequently calcined to convert the surface ligands into a carbon framework.

This minireview summarizes the scientific background underlying the recent developments on carbon-coated NP superlattices with precise synthetic control of size, shape, surface chemistry, and composition that are beneficial for excellent electrochemical characteristics of electrode materials. We illustrate this topic through three sections (Fig. 2). In section 2.1, the intermetallic NP cores can be accurately regulated over crucial factors like surface energy, atomic-type binding affinity, and so on, to achieve both high activity and stability in practical energy applications. Structural information on the coordination environment can be provided by various techniques, including extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), confirming the correlation between atomic scale alloying characteristics and electrocatalytic performances. In section 2.2, the fabrication of long-ranged ordered NP superlattices is discussed, which can be realized by combination of monodisperse NPs synthesis and self-assembly methods, showing properties that differ from individual NPs and disordered bulk samples. Then in section 2.3, the methods and effects of carbon coating over the NPs are demonstrated. Carbon coating generated from thermal carbonization of surface ligands can provide high tensile strength and good conductivity. These structural designs benefit potential applications for energy conversion and storage in electrochemistry and photochemistry (Fig. 2). It is noted that although carbon coating is not prominent in sections 2.1 and 2.2, it is applicable by means of coating methods discussed in section 2.3, such as using heat treatment to convert the capping ligands to an electrically conductive carbon layer. This minireview mainly focuses on electrochemistry, which is described using the recently developed carbon-coated NP superlattices for lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, and electrocatalysts. At the end, a summary of the current research status and perspectives on carbon-coated NP superlattices for energy applications are provided.

2. Precisely engineered NP superlattices and their energy applications
2.1 Intermetallic structure
Bimetallic NPs with selected transition metals can form nanoalloys that improve electrocatalytic activities, especially when oxygen activation is involved. The structures of bimetallic NPs have three main categories: core/shell (Fig. 3a),53 hetero-structure (Fig. 3b),54 and intermetallic and alloyed structures (Fig. 3c).54,55 The understanding of the degree of segregation, coordination, and atomic-scale chemical/structural ordering provides significant implications for the electrocatalytic properties.56 Especially under the standard fuel cell operating conditions, NPs are inclined to have inferior electrochemical catalytic activity during cycling due to dissolution, oxidization, detachment from substrate, and agglomeration.57

Among the aforementioned three bimetallic NPs, intermetallics and alloys are both homogeneous mixtures of two metals and metal–metal bonds form with random atomic ordering for alloys and long-range atomic ordering for intermetallics. Intermetallics with long-range ordering can be accurately regulated over key parameters such as surface energies of the constituent, bond strength of homoatomic vs. heteroatomic, charge transfer between various atomic types, and level of difficulty for binding to surface and support materials.58 As a result, a balance of these factors can be kept synergistically on the preparation and usage condition in activating oxygen and controlling surface oxygenated species. Thus, ordered intermetallic NPs are one of the most promising candidates to achieve both high activity and stability in practical fuel cell applications.54,56
Besides, platinum (Pt) has been regarded as the most important element for electrocatalysis. However, the scarcity and high cost of Pt have been hindering its uptake for widespread energy applications.59 PtM (where M stands for earth-abundant transition metals) nanoalloys are extensively studied for their electrocatalytic performances in various applications such as Pt3Ni nanoframes11 and Mo-doped Pt3Ni NPs60 that were reported to have remarkable activity and durability in ORR.
Hyeon and co-workers reported the synthesis of highly durable and active intermetallic ordered face-centered tetragonal (fct)-PtFe NPs coated with a “dual purpose” N-doped carbon shell. Ordered fct-PtFe NPs with sizes of only a few nanometers were obtained by thermal annealing of polydopamine-coated PtFe NPs, and the N-doped carbon shell in situ formed from dopamine coating could effectively prevent the coalescence of NPs (Fig. 4a).61 The electrochemical tests showed that the ordered fct-PtFe/C nanocatalyst coated with an N-doped carbon shell exhibited 11.4 times-higher mass activity and 10.5 times-higher specific activity than commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 4b).61 The increase in electrocatalytic activity for ORR was attributed to the change in the oxygen adsorption energy by electronic structure modification and geometric effects. The authors showed that, compared to disordered face-centered-cubic (fcc)-Pt Fe NPs, the ordered fct-PtFe NPs had smaller lattice constants and shorter Pt–Pt and Pt–Fe bond lengths (Fig. 4c and d),61 revealing their lower oxygen adsorption energy, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

(c) Model structure of ordered fct-PtFe. (d) Fitting results of the EXAFS data. Reprinted with permission from ref. 61. Copyright 2015, American Chemical Society. 
EXAFS, a kind of synchrotron-based X-ray technique, provides structural information on the coordination environment around each component for assessing the alloy formation in terms of coordination number and the atomic species immediately surrounding the selected element.62 The information is more extended structural/chemical ordering across the entire NP, regardless of whether the particle is crystalline or amorphous.63 Zhong and co-workers gained deep insight into the atomic-scale chemical and structural ordering by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES)/EXAFS,56 which was demonstrated as a powerful method to confirm the chemical state and local atomic structure for the selected atomic species, neighboring metal–metal coordination, formal oxidation state, metal oxide content, electronic properties, and charge transfer ability in the studied alloys, which are closely correlated with the electrocatalytic performances of the fcc-type lattice change and the atomic scale alloying characteristics. For example, an intriguing phenomenon has been found in the PtNiFe/C electrocatalysis towards ORR due to atomic scale structural correlation. It is suggested that the Pt enrichment on the surface sites contributes to the higher mass activity of catalysts treated at lower temperatures, while an improved Pt-alloying surface sites generate higher specific activity for the catalysts treated at higher temperatures.64
2.2 Long-range ordering of NPs
The controlled assembly of uniform-sized NPs enables the well-aligned assembly of inorganic NPs and exhibits collective properties that are different from individual NPs or disordered bulk samples.49,65–67 Generally, periodically ordered arrays of NPs are prepared through the evaporation-driven method68,69 or the destabilization-driven method.48,70 The evaporation-driven method is the slow evaporation of solvents to form dense periodic packing of NP on the substrate. It can directly assemble NP superlattices on the electrode and needs a relatively shorter preparation period than the destabilization-driven method. It is also able to fabricate more complex NP superlattices using binary/ternary components or anisotropic shape NPs.71 However, a substrate is required in the evaporation-driven method. The separation and transition of NP superlattices from the substrate to the desired electrode for further characterization/testing is not convenient compared with the destabilization-driven method, which could produce large amounts of free standing supercrystals. On the other hand, the destabilization-driven method is the self-assembly of NPs into free standing NP supercrystals during the diffusion of a more polar solvent into a less polar one where the destabilization-driven assembly occurs. It does not require using substrates or templates and produces strictly ordered NP assemblies. In addition, by removing the NP core from NP supercrystals, one can obtain a high quality 3D carbon mesoporous framework.39 However, the destabilization-driven method typically takes a longer period of preparation time. In addition, currently only single component spherical NPs can be assembled with the destabilization-driven method. Solvent evaporation40 and non-solvent46 diffusion are the major approaches to fabricate NP superlattices. A survey of several representative methods that have found use in the controlled assembly of particles into well-organized structures is presented.72 The goal of these techniques is to collect the particles, organize them, and bind the structure into a stable architecture. The collection can be obtained by simple sedimentation,73,74 directed by convection and capillarity,75,76 or driven by external fields.77–80 The organization can be attributed to confining the particles to initiate crystallization,80–83 or templating them on surfaces.84–86 The binding can result from simply adding (poly)electrolytes of opposite charge,87,88 or complicated steps of directing key-and-lock recognition of proteins or DNA molecules.89–92 Single-component NP building blocks can be induced to order primarily by van der waals force, dipolar coupling, magnetic interaction, steric repulsion and entropy attributed to both the core and capping ligands.93 Multicomponent superlattices have also been achieved from two or more sets of monodisperse NPs through a liquid–air interfacial assembly.49 These processes are generally more complicated than single-component ones with a number of distinct pairwise interactions combining with hard-sphere space-filling rules.40
To realize good assembly of long-range NP ordering, the synthesis of monodisperse NPs is crucial and a detailed discussion has been elucidated elsewhere.49,94,95 A NP consists of an inorganic/organic core and a surface layer of capping ligands, which are organic molecules to stabilize the NP. Thus, its chemical/physical properties and functions are determined by the core, capping ligands, the size as well as the morphology.96 A wide range of NPs with silica, carbon, metallic, metal oxides have been synthesized.49,97 Appropriate molecular precursors need to meet the requirements of good solubility in a nonpolar organic solvent, ideal stability at room temperature, enough reactivity at elevated temperatures, rarely undesired side reactions with capping ligands or solvent, and a high purity for targeted products. The rate of nucleation and growth of NPs needs to be effectively separated in colloidal synthesis, which can result from different temperature dependence on nucleation and growth kinetics.51 For instance, the formation of monodisperse NPs can be achieved via rapid injection of precursors into a hot solvent, in which fast nucleation occurs followed by slower growth from the oversaturated solutions.52 The manner of introducing precursors not only contributes to the nucleation and growth kinetics, but also allows to adjust shapes of the resulting NPs without a size-sorting process.
The excellent size-, shape-, and compositional-tunabilities of colloidal NPs are beneficial for their utilization as electroactive materials in the corresponding electrochemical applications. Intensive research works have been focused on nanostructured cathodes and anodes derived from monodisperse NPs for LIBs to solve the problems of poor electronic or ionic conductivity, slow reaction kinetics, or large structural changes.14,50 As suggested in Fig. 5a,14 colloidal NPs can be assembled into aggregates of NPs (secondary particles), which can reduce the overall active material–electrolyte and electrode–electrolyte interfacial areas. The physical separation between active materials and electrolyte causes reduced reactivity, which decreases the amount of the solid-electrolyte interfacial (SEI) while it enhances the SEI stability in LIBs. The corresponding effect is crucial for the alloying/conversion of electrode materials as it reduces the irreversible capacity loss at the first cycles and contributes to higher Coulombic efficiencies and desirable cycling stabilities. Within the NP superlattices, efficient electronic and ionic transport can be realized by embedding NPs into a conductive carbon matrix.

The formation of such NP superlattices has also been shown in several reports for electrocatalysis by solvent evaporation methods, enabling monodisperse NPs to form long-range ordered assemblies (superlattices). Zheng and co-workers developed a highly ordered carbon-coated Co–Mn oxide NP superlattice by a solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly method followed by annealing, during which nitrogen dopants were further incorporated into the carbon framework in the superlattices (designated as CoMnO@CN).23 SEM and TEM images showed that the CoMnO@CN superlattices retained a closely packed NP assembly with a long-range ordering with few cracks, agglomeration or other defects (Fig. 5b and c).23 This bottom-up solution approach allowed for the synthesis of multivalent NP assembly with versatile composition/structures, high uniformity, and long-range order. The obtained superlative acted as an efficient bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalyst due to several attractive features (Fig. 5d).23 On the morphology level, the interconnected NP superlattice structure enabled more reactive sites with good retention of conductivity and stability. For the electronic tuning, the CoMnO NPs with octahedral Co2+ and tunable Mn doping levels offered an optimized electronic structure for OER, and the metal oxide NPs inside carbon framework provided facile electron transfer for HER. The nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) framework presented an excellent electronic structure for HER, in the meantime serving as a charge transporting layer for CoMnO NPs. This bifunctional superlattice catalyst exhibited much enhanced current densities and electrochemical stability in overall water splitting, substantially exceeding most of single- or bifunctional electrocatalysts previously reported.
2.3 Carbon coating
Before integration into actual electrodes, the protective layer of capping molecules such as ligands and surfactants must be removed or displaced by conductive species while keeping the integrity of NPs.98–101 There are various approaches towards this goal. Firstly, heat treatment23,102 is a facile means of achieving carbon coating as the heating atmosphere, temperature, and treatment time can be designed to convert the capping ligands to an electrically conductive carbon layer. With elevated temperatures, highly graphitic frameworks with ordered mesoporosity and high surface area can exhibit even better performances. Secondly, plasma etching103 and heating in weak/dilute acids53 can also clean the surface of NPs to expose conductive/active NP cores. Thirdly, introducing extra carbon support104 before removing the surfactant can also be employed. For materials with high thermal stability such as iron oxide, thermally induced carbonization of ligands into a thin conductive layer of carbon is a practical and convenient approach.105–107
The superlattice structure is an important factor for stability during the carbonization step.39 The formation of uniformly sized NP superlattices can be generated by slow evaporation of the volatile nonpolar solvent, with highly dense periodic or random packing within each aggregate.52 Combined with thermal carbonization of the ligands, the construction of Fe3O4/carbon nanocomposites can be formed. The potential advantages of periodic packing include a well-defined interparticle spacing and a high volumetric packing density, i.e., ca. 74% for face-centered-cubic or hexagonal-close-packed packing in single component assemblies or 50–80% for binary component mixtures, showing much more resistance to sintering than disordered packing.108
According to the reaction mechanism in LIBs, carbon-coated NP superlattices are specifically beneficial for the electrode/electrolyte interface to achieve higher charge–discharge rates, better accommodation of the strain of Li+ insertion/extraction to improve cycle life, and short transport paths for Li+ and electrons to facilitate operation with lower ionic/electronic conductivity and higher power.109,110
Hyeon and co-workers reported a single-step method for the direct preparation of self-assembled ferrite/carbon hybrid nanosheets with long-range ordered arrays and their applications to high-performance LIB.22 By using metal–oleate complexes as the precursors for both ferrite and carbon and using sodium sulfate salt powder as a sacrificial template, two-dimensional nanostructures were obtained (Fig. 6a).22 The well-ordered ferrite/carbon nanosheets exhibited good resistance to mechanical deformation. TEM images showed that the shape, size and the assembled nanosheet structure of the electrodes were sustained without peeling off after 10 charge–discharge cycles at a rate of 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 6b–e).22 It has been reported that the presence of carbon coating can reduce mechanical deformation by buffering the volume change of the electroactive materials.111,112 The encapsulating carbon shells help to maintain the structure of ferrite/carbon nanosheet electrodes. The regularly spaced carbon walls between the NPs enabled high tensile strength and more room to expand in the vertical direction of the carbon sheet, contributing to good cycle performance of the ferrite/carbon nanosheets (Fig. 6f).22 The ferrite/carbon nanosheets showed much better performance than the three-dimensional nanocomposite due to the short diffusion path and large accessible surface for the effective insertion of lithium ions (Fig. 6g).22 Moreover, the size of the ferrite NPs had a significant impact on the electrochemical performances at high charging–discharging rates. Smaller-sized ferrite NPs were more efficient for fast diffusion processes, and the Coulombic efficiency of the nanosheets were less inclined to be affected by the electrolyte decomposition on the electrode surface, as the ferrite NPs were protected by carbon shells.

To obtain better electronic conductivity and chemical stability for LIB, Dong and co-workers reported a strategy of preparing highly ordered mesoporous graphene frameworks (MGFs) with well-defined mesoporosity and high surface area, of three to six stacking graphene layers, based on the conversion of self-assembled superlattices of Fe3O4 NPs.39 This approach to prepare ordered mesoporous carbons differs significantly from previous templating methods, in which Fe3O4 NPs served as both template and graphitization catalyst, generating a partially graphitic wall of ordered mesoporous carbons (Fig. 7a).39 At a high temperature (∼1000 °C), the partially graphitic ultrathin pore walls were converted into stacking graphene layers, resulting in MGFs with well-maintained structural ordering, as indicated by TEM images and fast Fourier transformed patterns (Fig. 7b).39 HRTEM images revealed that the pore walls of the mesoporous graphene frameworks were composed of three to six stacking graphene layers depending on the thickness (Fig. 7c and d).39 The MGFs exhibited excellent cycling stability and rate performances when used as anode materials for LIBs, retaining a specific capacity of 520 mA h g−1 at a current density of 300 mA g−1 after 400 cycles (Fig. 7e).39 The excellent electrochemical performance of MGFs was attributed to their 3D interconnected ordered mesoporosity, along with the large surface area of MGFs for electrode and electrolyte contact, thus facilitating the access of Li ions into the electrode. The ultrathin pore walls greatly reduced the barriers for Li+ intercalation and extraction, and the continuous highly graphitic frameworks enhanced electron transport, which were beneficial for improving lithium-storage properties.

It has also been reported that highly ordered and dense assemblies of Ni113 or MnO114 within an amorphous carbon matrix were obtained in a single step of oleate-assisted deposition/calcinations process. This process generated metal oxide NPs followed by the carbonization of surface oleate groups. These oleate-oriented carbon-coated materials were demonstrated to be supercapacitors for energy storage.113 The mesoporous Ni@C composite grown on a flexible carbon fiber exhibited a capacitance of ∼700 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The mesoporous carbon coating provided entries for electrolyte ions, conduction frameworks for efficient charge transfer, inhibition of the aggregation, and dissolution of Ni particles during charge–discharge cycles.
3. Prospects and challenges
The rapidly growing demand for energy and aggravating environmental issues have been pushing us to actively explore clean and renewable energies. Carbon-coated NP superlattices are a category of novel and promising material architecture that are expected to efficiently improve the efficiency and durability of electrochemical applications. This minireview summarizes the design and synthesis of carbon-coated NP superlattices, particularly the precise control over intermetallic structure, long-range ordering, and carbon coating. Compared to their isolated or disordered NP bulk counterparts, the carbon-coated NP superlattices present several attractive characteristics including facile electron transport, short diffusion length, and abundant reactive sites for reactions at interfaces via enhanced coupling between close-packed NPs, which allow them to overcome some of the current challenges for energy applications.
It is encouraging to see significant progress in understanding how the individual structural parameters influence the performance. Nonetheless, it remains unresolved how to systematically harness these parameters and precisely adjust them to achieve the best electrochemical results.115 A number of challenges remain ahead to leverage the NP superlattices into real-world applications. First, most of the current designs in this field are focused on single-component NP superlattices and their NP cores, for example, through alloying selective metal with its corresponding oxide to tune their catalytic performances. The application of binary or multi-component NP superlattices in electrocatalysis is still at a preliminary stage. Second, carbon coating is an excellent method for enhancing conductivity and geometric confinement, but the stability during carbonization and durability during electrochemical application may be an issue.113 Third, carbon is well known to have plenty of unique forms such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon spheres that surely provide carbon-coated NP superlattice structures with tremendous advancing space for electrocatalytic developments. However, the carbon layer has mostly been utilized as an electrically conducting framework, while their capabilities for providing catalytically active sites has not been studied systematically, for example, by doping or tuning the elemental contents. Fourth, the approach to scalable self-assembly is still limited to certain types of NPs such as Fe3O4, CdSe, PbS, and Au. More NP structures should be studied to allow one to explore their collective electrochemical performances. Future studies will surely continue to develop a thorough understanding of the underlying formation mechanisms as well as the chemical and physical properties of monodisperse NPs and their superlattices.
