Broader context
Green and inexhaustible solar energy along with clean electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies are reliable and promising to alleviate the current energy and environmental issues. Still, there are issues in solar energy exploitation during the process of visible-light adsorption, charge carrier separation and recombination. Besides, problems of insulation, processability, activity, capacity, stability, etc. in electrochemical processes also restrict the energy source and technology utilization. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging crystalline porous materials sharing merits of abundant molecular design, sufficient building blocks, adequate synthetic strategies, high conjugated and modifiable structures, large surface area and porosity. Therefore, COFs exhibit bright prospects in dispelling the abovementioned impediments. In this review, we systematically summarized utilizing COFs for solar energy harnessing, energy storage, energy conversion and mass transfer to give indexes to present research status, trends, existent challenges and possible future directions. We hope that this review could provide inspiration for developing better COFs for clean energy applications and boost the enduring research enthusiasm in this field.

Introduction
Aggressive consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels has caused a severe energy crisis and environment issues, while global warming is getting increasingly serious due to the excessive emission of greenhouse gases.1,2 Hence, clean and sustainable energy sources, energy conversion systems and energy storage technologies are in great demand to alleviate the dramatically increasing global energy needs and environmental issues.3–5 Solar energy is clean and inexhaustible and it has been harnessed as a clean energy source in photocatalysis such as water splitting, organic synthesis and environmental governance, etc.6 Invigorated attempts have been devoted to developing senior energy conversion and storage systems, for instance, water splitting, CO2 reduction, fuel cells, supercapacitors and metal ion/sulfur batteries.7,8 As to photocatalysis systems, extended and enhanced visible-light absorption, rational band structures and physicochemical stability are the basic requirements for semiconductor materials in transforming solar energy into chemical energy or energy fuels.9–11 As to energy conversion systems, including water splitting, CO2 reduction and fuel cells, researchers put emphasis on developing effective catalysts for key reactions involved in these systems, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),12,13 oxygen evolution reaction (OER),14,15 oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)16–18 and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).19,20 As to energy storage systems including supercapacitors and metal-ion/sulfur batteries, electrode materials with enhanced conductivity and specific configurations are in high demand. In addition, constructing mass transfer materials is crucial for enhancing the efficiencies of electrochemical conversion systems and the capacities of electrochemical energy storage devices, as well as solving safety issues. Various materials have been illustrated for energy conversion (photocatalysis and electrocatalysis), energy storage (supercapacitors, batteries) and mass transfer, but before meeting practical requirements, there is still a long way to go.
As an emerging family of porous crystalline materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received intensive research focus because of their flexible molecular design and synthetic strategies, high conjugated and modifiable structures, large surface area and porosity.21–26 Attention has been paid to exploring the functionality of COFs, such as gas adsorption and separation,27 sensing,28 biological medicine,29 catalysis30 and optoelectronics.31,32 Recently, promising pictures of pristine COFs, COF composites and COF-derived materials in the field of energy conversion and storage have been demonstrated,33–38 and breakthrough achievements have been realized due to the following merits: (1) through flexible molecular design and subsequent synthetic strategies, the conjugation degree, band structures, functional groups and porous properties of COFs can be finely tuned which are crucial for superior photocatalytic performance. Extended conjugation degree and rational band structures facilitate light harvesting, promoting visible light utilization during a photocatalytic process. By introducing functional groups into the skeletons or pore channels of COFs, efficient photo induced charge carrier separation and transfer are facile to implement, which are important in photocatalysis. Furthermore, COFs with high surface area and good pore size can facilitate mass transfer and accommodate active species to further boost photocatalytic performance. (2) Through flexible molecular design and subsequent synthetic strategies, conductivity and activity issues can be properly overcome when harnessing COF based materials for electrocatalysis. Electron transmission pathways can be constructed between the building blocks, which can promote electrocatalytic performance. Because of their large conjugation, COFs can be integrated with conductive carbon nanotubes or graphene through non-covalent interactions. Introducing active sites such as metal sites or functional groups into the frameworks of COFs, electrocatalytic performances are improved. When introduced as carriers for metal sites, their size can be tuned through controlling the pore size. Unhindered mass transfer originating from regular pore channels is also important for electrocatalysis. Furthermore, due to their heteroatom nature, carbon materials acting as carriers for active catalysts can be derived when utilizing COFs as precursors. (3) Through flexible molecular design and subsequent synthetic strategies, COFs with highly conjugated structures can be prepared which can speed up the electron conductivity during electrochemical storage processes. Redox-active sites can be easily drawn into the structures of COFs providing fast kinetics, which is significant for capacity improvement. By synthesizing COFs with specific structures, shortened pathways can be realized during electrochemical processes. Furthermore, armed with high surface area and regular pore structures, more electrolytes can be held within COFs, enhancing their capacitance. Through molecular design, COFs with physical or chemical sulfur confinement can be designed and realized by synthesis. In hosting sulfur, higher content can be easily achieved in COFs with high surface area and pore volumes. (4) Through flexible molecular design and subsequent synthetic strategies, COFs with regular pore structures for accommodating proton or ion conductors can be prepared. Furthermore, COFs with pristine proton or ion conduction can also be realized.
In this review, we begin with summarizing the recent developments in the molecular design and synthetic strategies of COFs which can be divided into “monomers to COFs” and “polymers to COFs” concerning representative imine, CC, triazine, and cyclic, etc. linkages. Secondly, the photocatalytic applications of COFs including water splitting, CO2RR, and degradation of organic pollutants will be discussed in detail. Subsequently, the electrochemical conversion and storage combined with mass transfer potentially useful in batteries and fuel cells are discussed. The strategies for how to boost specific energy applications of COFs through molecular design and synthetic strategies to realize highly conjugated and modifiable structures, large surface area and porosity are elaborated vividly in the corresponding sections. Finally, perspectives and challenges in synthesis and functionalities are discussed. We hope that this review will hopefully give guidance and inspiration for future studies on COF based nanomaterials for promising energy storage and conversion applications.
Designing COFs for energy conversion and storage
During the past decade, topological design and synthetic strategies, two base aspects of the COF field, have seen boosted development, which greatly complemented our molecular design and functionality exploration capability.39 To date, over 20 kinds of linkages have been invented in constructing COFs, including the well-established imine, boronic esters and the newly developed CC, triazines, etc.40 In addition, other kinds of linkages such as amide, thiazole, etc. were also developed by elaborate post synthetic modifications. The current synthetic strategies of COFs can be categorized into two major branches, the “monomers to COFs” and the “polymers to COFs” strategies, which stands for constructing COFs through monomer condensation and the transformation of the polymers, respectively. In the following sections, most representative achievements in these two aspects will be discussed in detail.
Monomers to COFs
In most cases, the synthesis of COFs from monomers was finished under solvothermal conditions, hence, the monomers, solvents, catalysts and synthetic strategies have a profound impact on the final COF's crystallinity, topology, porosity and functionality. The recent developments concerning these aspects for the synthesis of COFs with representative imine, CC, triazine and other linkages with high stability are elucidated. In addition, an introduction to microwave-assisted and mechanochemical synthesis is also included.
To enhance the crystallinity and porosity, monomers with functional groups, stacking ability and enhanced planarity were developed for constructing 2D COFs, where at least two monomers bearing different functional groups are needed. Furthermore, these monomers essentially did not motivate the synthetic strategy or structures of COFs. Chen et al. developed a “two in one” strategy (Fig. 2a) by integrating two different functional groups (formyl and amino groups) in one monomer molecule to prepare COFs.41 This strategy delivered excellent solvent adaptability where COFs could be afforded in CH2Cl2, CHCl3, THF, CH3OH, CH3CH2OH, CH3CN, and DMAC, etc. This strategy was also suitable for preparing COF films on different substrates. Very recently, Zhao et al. verified that not only the building block symmetry but also their connecting sequence made crucial differences in determining the crystalline structures of COFs.42 When changing the connecting sequences of the building blocks with the same symmetry, four 2D COFs with different structures were obtained. Wang et al. showed that the steric hindrance of the monomers could affect the structures of the final COFs.43 Starting from biphenyl-based monomer, 2D COF (2D-BPTA-COF) with an AB stacking model or 3D COF (3D-BMTA-COF) with a 7-fold interpenetrated structure with pts topology could be synthesized from the one without/with methyl groups at the ortho positions. In another case, by a simple and effective enhancing-steric-hindrance strategy, 3D COFs with stable mesopores and excellent surface areas could be obtained.44

In contrast to a time-consuming solvothermal method, fast and facial synthesis of highly crystalline and porous COFs can be realized in ionic liquids (ILs) due to their special characters.45 The first constitutional COF isomers were achieved via condensation of 4′,4′′′,4′′′′′,4′′′′′′′-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayl)tetrakis([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carbaldehyde) (ETTBC) and 2,5-diaminotoluene (DAT) by altering the solvothermal reaction solvents and these isomers displayed different porous properties and stabilities (Fig. 2b).46
In most cases, COFs with imine linkages were prepared under solvothermal conditions with aqueous CH3COOH as a catalyst. These conditions often generated microcrystalline powders and moderate porosity. COFs with imine linkages can be prepared utilizing Lewis acidic metal triflates as catalysts (Fig. 2c).47 Among metal triflates, Sc(OTf)3 can dramatically facilitate the formation and exchange of imine within 10 min at low temperature. In another case, a self-standing TAPB–PDA COF film was synthesized via Sc(OTf)3 catalyzed interfacial condensation.48
COFs with imine or β-ketoenamine linkages were obtained with high quality and shortened time through the formal transamination of N-aryl benzophenone imines.49 A stepwise strategy was developed to synthesize COFs via linking macromolecular and infinite building blocks.50 In this strategy, 1D ribbons of COF-76 bearing free amines, were first synthesized, and then these 1D ribbons were linked to form 2D COF-77 and COF-78. By covalently self-assembling mesoscale COF nanospheres in the liquid interface between DCM and H2O, Banerjee et al. transformed these spheres into self-standing COF films.51 Based on a supramolecular strategy, Lin et al. developed the first D–A type Intercalated-COF with alternating PDI-based covalent 2D layers and perylene guest layers which could give a z-direction modulation of the 2D COFs.52 Rigid or flexible COFs can be obtained within minutes under electron beam irradiation with controlled received dosage via new reaction pathways (Fig. 2d).53 Additionally, this strategy favours the formation of COFs in high yields, promising for large-scale synthesis to realize practical applications. Assisted by cationic surfactant micelles, sub-20 nm colloidal solutions of COFs were prepared under room temperature and ambient pressure in water.54
Sp2 carbon-linked COFs with full π-conjugated structures prepared from Knoevenagel55,56 or Aldol condensation57,58 have exhibited improved stability and optical ability. Very recently, Jiang et al. reported a topology-templated strategy to obtain COFs with CC linkage (Fig. 2e).59 Seeded on the (001) facets of imine-linked COFs, sp2 carbon-linked COFs were constituted. This strategy was also suitable for constructing CC linked COFs with different topologies and even COFs which could not be prepared via direct polymerization. Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are often obtained with amorphous structures.60 To address this issue, Tan et al. developed an in situ oxidation strategy where the nucleation rate was controlled to prepare crystalline CTFs.61 Through this strategy, a collection of CTFs with impressive photocatalytic performance were developed. Furthermore, they pointed out that by controlling the feeding rates of the monomers, the crystallization process could be governed in a controlled manner at open systems.62 They further verified that the base reagent played an important role in the final crystallinity: the stronger the base, the higher the crystallinity of the final CTF.63
Developing COFs with robust linkages is of crucial importance to take full advantage of the conjugated structures. By utilizing cascade reactions, a series of COFs (LZU-190, 191, and 192) were developed with benzoxazole linkages, which improved the COFs stability greatly.64 In another case, multicomponent reactions (MCRs) were introduced to develop ultrastable COFs with cyclic linkages.65 Robust imidazole-linked COFs were prepared via one of the MCRs, Debus–Radziszewski reaction, where monomers first went through one-pot covalent assembly and subsequent condensation.
Microwave synthesis provides a highly convenient way of constructing porous materials and the preparation time can be greatly shortened. When preparing 2D (COF-5) and 3D (COF-102) COFs, mild microwave synthesis was introduced and shortened the synthetic time sharply (200 times faster).66 The obtained COFs delivered higher or comparable porous properties (COF-5: 2019 m2 g−1; COF-102: 2926 m2 g−1) as compared to those synthesized under solvothermal conditions (COF-5: 1590 m2 g−1; COF-102: 3472 m2 g−1). This is the first example of utilizing a microwave-assisted strategy for synthesizing COFs. Mechanochemical methods are simple, fast, eco-friendly, and suitable for preparing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with a surface area over 3500 m2 g−1.67 Mechanochemical synthesis has also been well-demonstrated for preparing COFs. TpPa-1 (MC), TpPa-2 (MC) and TpBD (MC) with high chemical and thermal stability were developed via mechanochemical grinding under room temperature within 40 min for the first time.68 Compared with their parent COFs synthesized through a solvothermal method, TpPa-1 (MC), TpPa-2 (MC) and TpBD (MC) delivered graphene-like morphologies during grinding exfoliation. After this contribution, strategies like liquid assisted grinding,69 salt-mediated crystallization approach,70 two-step synthesis71etc. were also reported to enhance the porosity, crystallinity, and functionality of the obtained COFs.72
Polymers to COFs
Basically, the structure of COFs can be divided into two components: one is the linkers (building units), and the other is the linkages (bonds between theses building units). Accordingly, the “polymer to COFs” strategy can be classified into the post-modification of the linkage and the exchange of the linkers.
Under mild oxidative conditions, two COFs (TPB-TP-COF and 4PE-1P-COF) with imine linkages were transformed to their corresponding amine linked COFs, where the original crystallinity and the porosity were preserved (Fig. 3a).73 This is the first attempt at obtaining COFs from polymers by post modifying the linkage. Through direct reduction of the corresponding imine linkage, two highly crystalline COFs with 2D (COF-300-AR) or 3D (COF-366-M-AR) dimensions were developed, and after reduction the structural stabilities were enhanced.74 V. Lotsch et al. verified that during the vulcanization process, imine linkages can be transformed into thiazole linkages.75 Compared with the parent imine COFs, thiazole linked COFs delivered ameliorative chemical and electron irradiation stability. Robustness and π-delocalization improvement were realized in the porous aromatic frameworks resulting from anchoring reversible imine linkages in COFs through aza-Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction.76 It is noteworthy that the obtained COFs with quinoline-linkages not only preserved the original structures, but also displayed the ever before stability, and could endure strong acids, bases and a redox environment. Thieno[3,2-c]pyridine could be obtained through oxidative cyclization between the reactive imine linkage and the neighboring thiophene (Fig. 3b).77 Through this methodology, Zhao et al. developed two stability- and π-conjugation-enhanced COFs through a two-step synthetic strategy. At first, they synthesized two COFs (B-COF-1 and T-COF-1) with imine linkages and the fully conjugated COFs (B-COF-2 and T-COF-2) with thieno[3,2-c]pyridine linkages were synthesized via the Pictet–Spengler reaction between the β-carbon of the thiophene and the carbon of the imine.

Combining vertex-truncation and multiple linking-site design, COFs possessing complicated topologies were developed (Fig. 3c).78 Two triple-pore COFs were developed through the condensation between TPTCA with 1,4-diaminobenzene and 4,4′-diaminobiphenyl, respectively. By the reaction between TP-COF-BZ with 1,4-diaminobenzene under solvothermal conditions, TP-COF-DAB was obtained, achieving a COF-to-COF transformation for the first time. Constructing COFs from amorphous covalent organic polymers (COPs) has remained a huge challenge for a long time. Zeng et al. terminated this challenge by introducing a linkage replacement strategy.79,80 In this procedure, polyimide/imine-linked COFs were obtained via substituting the imine/polyimide-linked COPs using anhydride/aldehyde, respectively. Large scale (>100 mg) synthesis of 2D COF nanosheets with high yield (>55%) was achieved by an imine-exchange strategy.81 During condensation between aldehydes and amines, excess 2,4,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde was added to restrain the π–π stacking when growing crystals. Furthermore, structural transformation in 3D COFs (COF-320 to COF-300, COF-320-to-300-15) and dimensional changes from 3D to 2D (COF-301 to TPB–DHTP-COF) were achieved through heterogeneous linker exchange.82
By integrating merits of post modification of the linkage and the linker exchange strategy, two COFs with thiazole (COF-921) and oxazole (LZU-192) linkages were developed by first substituting 1,4-phenylenediamine linkers in ILCOF-1 with 2,5-diaminobenzene-1,4-dithiol dihydrochloride or 2,5-diaminohydroquinone dihydrochloride, followed by cyclization and oxidation to generate thiazole (COF-921) and oxazole (LZU-192) linkages.83 Following the same protocol, a carbamate-linked COF via a multistep solid-state organic method was prepared through three consecutive post synthetic modifications.84 Finally, COF-170 was transferred into COFs with carbamate or thiocarbamate linkages where these linkages were unreported or inaccessible through de novo synthesis.
In most cases of “polymer to COF”, high time/energy consumption and trial-and-error were indispensable. Furthermore, challenges existed to avoid COF framework collapse and retain pristine crystallinity. To solve these issues, Dong et al. developed a new strategy which could generate new COFs with new linkages through multicomponent one-pot in situ Strecker and Povarov reactions (Fig. 3d).85 They demonstrated this strategy to be general and viable by synthesizing a series of COFs which couldn’t before be obtained by the post synthetic methodology. Monitoring the time-dependent COF-to-COF process and uncovering the transformation mechanism was realized by Feyter et al. (Fig. 3e).86 They prepared COFs on the surface of the newly synthesized HOPG with the aid of an electric field. By controlling the bias between the STM tip and the HOPG surface, COFs could switch from one with boroxine linkages (sCOFs-1) to one with boronate ester linkages (sCOFs-2). Based on experimental results, they pointed out that this transformation was attributed to thermodynamic differences and the size-dependent crystalline stabilization process.
COF-oriented materials for energy conversion
Photocatalysis
Photocatalysis, a technology harnessing “green” and inexhaustible sunlight to alleviate tremendous fossil energy consumption and the corresponding environmental crisis, strengthens the blueprint for a sustainable and carbon-neutral world. Due to the diffuse, intermittent and large visible-light nature of sunlight, searching for photocatalysts with high stability, visible-light response and efficiency plays a crucial role in the field of photocatalysis. To date, various inorganic (TiO2, CdS, Ag3PO4, MOFs, etc.) and organic semiconductors (g-C3N4) have been constructed, but they always suffer from issues like inferior visible-light utilization efficiency, heavy metal toxicity, photocorrosion effect and limited structural diversity.87 COFs recently demonstrated great potential in phorocatalysis by virtue of their superior advantages: (1) the covalent connection between the building blocks endows COFs with high thermal and chemical stability, hence prolonging the service life. (2) High conjugation degree and rational band structures, which broadens the visible-light adsorption range, can be easily realized via flexible molecular design and synthetic strategies. (3) In most cases, COFs for photocatalysis often consist of a donor–acceptor structure and the electrons transfer from the donor to the acceptor improves the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers. (4) Constructing a heterojunction between COFs and other semiconductors with rational band structures can further improve the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers. (5) The periodical structures of the π conjugated system favor the electron transportation and photoconductivity. (6) The regular channels and nanopore structures could hold more active sites and provide abundant access to these active sites.
Water splitting
Hydrogen has been viewed as a promising alternative for fossil energy due to its high energy density and environmental superiority. Producing hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting can directly transform solar energy into hydrogen energy. Provided with crystallinity, high surface area, porosity and modifiable structures, increasing achievements have been achieved based on COFs as photocatalysts for water splitting to generate H2.
The first example harnessing COFs for photocatalytic water splitting was reported by Lotsch et al. (Fig. 4a).88 A H2 generation of 1970 μmol h−1 g−1 could be reached and no evident activity decline was observed in the hydrazine-linked COF with a Pt cocatalyst and triethanolamine sacrificial donor. Afterwards, they tuned the nitrogen content of the COFs at the molecular level and evaluated the corresponding effects toward photocatalytic H2 generation (Fig. 4b).89 As shown in Fig. 4c, the photocatalytic H2 generation rate increased with accumulated C–H substitution by nitrogen in the central aryl ring. The average hydrogen generation rate for N0, N1, N2 and N3-COF reached 23, 90, 438 and 1703 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively. Similarly, they verified the photocatalytic H2 generation improved with increasing nitrogen numbers in the peripheral aromatic units of COFs where the thermodynamic driving force decreased with increased nitrogen numbers (Fig. 4d).90 All these studies paved the way toward photocatalytic water splitting applications by COFs.

Dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone is one of the most attractive building blocks for constructing conjugated polymers with pronounced photocatalytic H2 generation ability.91 Cooper et al. developed two sulfone-contained COFs named as S-COF and FS-COF to explore the crucial figures of sulfone groups in affecting photocatalytic H2 generation.92 S-COF and FS-COF exhibited excellent H2 generation rate of 4440 and 10100 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, superior to sulfone-free TP-COF (1600 μmol g−1 h−1) and amorphous analogue FS-P (1120 μmol g−1 h−1). After dye sensitization of FS-COF with Eosin Y, a 60% promotion in H2 generation was achieved, reaching up to 16300 μmol g−1 h−1, which is the best HER performance among COF-based photocatalysts to date. In addition, thin films were fabricated by drop-casting FS-COF colloidal solution on glass substrates, displaying comparable photocatalytic HER performance to dye sensitized FS-COF. The authors ascribed the fantastic HER performance to the introduction of sulfone moieties which brought a combination of several structural and electronic effects (Fig. 5a).93 Sun et al. explored the effect of different functional groups attached to COF backbones on photocatalytic HER performance.94 Mechanism investigations demonstrated that the better the electron donating ability of the functional groups, the more efficient the separation and transfer capability of the photo-induced charge carriers. Hence, a superior H2 generation rate was achieved in TpPa COF-(CH3)2 compared with TpPa COF-H and TpPa COF-NO2. Thomas et al. synthesized two β-ketoenamine linked COFs bearing –CC– (TP-EDDA) and –CC–CC– (TP-BDDA) functionalities, and through comparing their H2 generation rates, the value of diacetylene diad moieties in the corresponding photocatalytic performance was emphasized (Fig. 5b).95 Superior performance in TP-BDDA was attributed to the better porous properties, easier accessible –CC–CC– moieties and considerable chemical stabilities. Yu et al. constructed a COF with thioether-functionality (TTR-COF), which exhibited special affinity to Au ions, acting as a cocatalyst, delivering impressive photocatalytic HER performance from seawater for the first time.96 The promising performance originated from the synergistic effects of Au nanoparticles promoting photo-induced charge transfer and triazine groups in the COF backbone narrowing the bandgap.

COFs with higher π conjugation can conflate merits like enhanced light-harvesting, narrowed bandgap, improved exciton migration and electron transfer for photocatalytic water splitting. Imine-, hydrazone- or azine-linked COFs only allow for partial π conjugation for the trisubstituted aryl core at the knot position to interdict π conjugation extension.97 Fully conjugated sp2 carbon linked COFs with high stability have been synthesized and applied for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Jiang et al. reported a fully conjugated 2D COF with sp2 carbon linkage for photocatalytic water splitting (Fig. 5c).98 This COF could hold its crystalline structure in harsh conditions including organic solvents, HCl (12 M), NaOH (14 M), and air exposure. sp2 c-COFERDN was obtained when decorating the lattice periphery with 3-ethylrhodanine (ERDN) and the π conjugation was further enhanced through donor–acceptor push–pull effect. Extended π conjugation facilitated the light adsorption, decreased the bandgap, enabled exciton migration and finally, sp2 c-COFERDN delivered a photocatalytic HER rate of 2120 μmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 5d). In addition, sp2 c-COF achieved an oxygen evolution rate of 22 μmol g−1 h−1 with AgNO3, Co(NO3)2, and La2O3 as an electron acceptor, cocatalyst, and pH buffer agent, respectively. Similarly, Zhang et al. developed two COFs with a triazine core, g-C18N3-COF and g-C33N3-COF, where the olefin linkages were unsubstituted (Fig. 5e).99 Both COFs exhibited semiconducting features including firm light harvesting, charge separation, tuneable band gaps and photocatalytic abilities.
Photocatalytic HER performance revealed that g-C18N3-COF was better than g-C33N3-COF (292 vs. 74 μmol g−1 h−1, Fig. 5f), in line with both the photocurrent and EIS results. They further constructed a series of sp2 carbon-linked COFs connected by trans-disubstituted CC bonds via condensation of arylmethyl and applied for photocatalytic water splitting.100 Endowed with pyridinyl groups, honeycomb-like structures and good porous properties, g-C40N3-COF could display a H2 generation rate of 2596 μmol g−1 h−1.
Owing to the high stability and nitrogen contents stemming from the triazine rings, covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) have delivered promising prospects in energy applications.60,101 Tan et al. developed crystalline CTFs which can be assigned to the subclass of COFs. Through condensation of aldehydes and amidines under low temperature and mild conditions, CTFs (CTF-HUSTs) were developed and applied for photocatalytic water splitting. Compared with CTFs synthesized under ionthermal conditions, CTF-HUSTs displayed superiority in the HER. Impressively, CTF-HUST-2 exported the highest HER rate of 2647 μmol g−1 h−1 among all CTFs and COFs reported at the time (Fig. 6a and b).102 They further enhanced the crystallinity of CTFs by controlling the reaction rates or monomer feeding rates.62 The reaction rates were controlled by in situ oxidizing alcohols into aldehydes in DMSO gradually, and a series of crystalline CTFs (CTF-HUST-C1, 5 and 6) were acquired (Fig. 6c).61 Photocatalytic experiments (Fig. 6d) demonstrated that CTF-HUST-C1 exhibited better HER performance than CTFs with a low crystallinity or amorphous structure, benefitting from the easier electron transformation and enhanced light adsorption. To achieve overall water splitting, crystallinity and hydrophilicity were believed to be the critical factors. They further synthesized CTFs displaying higher crystallinity by tuning the basicity of the base reagent (Cs2CO3, K2CO3, KOH, EtOK, and tBuOK) in the reaction (Fig. 6e).63 The results revealed that the stronger the basicity, the higher the crystallinity of the CTF, while the hydrophilicity was enhanced by introducing monomers with benzylamine groups. CTF-HUST-A1-tBuOK could achieve a photocatalytic HER performance of 9200 μmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 6f). Furthermore, the overall water splitting rate was calculated to be 25.4 and 12.9 μmol g−1 h−1, for H2 and O2, respectively, where 4.5 wt% NiPx and 3.0 wt% Pt dual cocatalysts were deposited on HUST-A1-tBuOK. They further elaborated the nanoparticle size of the cocatalyst on the photocatalytic HER performance of crystalline CTFs (Fig. 6g).103 The results demonstrated that Pd possessed superior affinity toward the pyridinic nitrogen of the CTFs than Pt and thus smaller nanoparticles were formed, promoting superior electron–hole pair separation. In addition, strong interaction between Pd and the pyridinic nitrogen facilitated photo-generated electron transfer. Consequently, 1 wt% Pd@CTF-HC6 and 1 wt% Pd@CTF-N can achieve a hydrogen production rate 11 and 5 times more than 1 wt% Pt@CTF-HC6 and 1 wt% Pt@CTF-N, respectively.

Constructing composites by rationally combining the merits of organic and inorganic semiconductors is an effective way to enhance the photocatalytic HER performance of COFs. Banerjee et al. prepared a series of hybrids by depositing CdS nanoparticles on the surface of 2D COFs for photocatalytic H2 generation (Fig. 7a).104 Benefitted from the well porous properties and existence of abundant hetero-interface, an HER performance of 3678 μmol g−1 h−1 was achieved in CdS-COF (90:10) (Fig. 7b). Mo3S13@EB-COF composites were prepared by encasing [Mo3S13]2− clusters into the cationic EB-COF (EB: ethidium bromide) through an ion exchange strategy.105 Mo3S13@EB-COF showed excellent photocatalytic H2 generation rate up to 13215 μmol g−1 h−1 and no obvious decline was seen after 4 cycles. Yan et al. modified g-C3N4, one of the most promising photocatalysts,106 with COFs through imine linkage, and the obtained composites exhibited a H2 generation rate of 10100 μmol g−1 h−1, mainly coming from the efficient transfer of photo-induced charge carriers.107 Following this concept, they further modified g-C3N4 nanosheets.108 The obtained CNS-COF composites can reach a rate up to 46400 μmol g−1 h−1. Zhang et al. integrated COFs with TiO2 tightly through covalent bonds forming heterojunctions.109 In particular, TiO2–TpPa-1-COF (1:3) displayed the optimal photocatalytic HER performance of 11190 μmol g−1 h−1, 5.3 and 3.0 times higher than TpPa-1 and TiO2/TpPa-1-COF, respectively. Mechanism investigation indicated that the superior HER activity from the covalent connections between COFs and TiO2 can significantly enhance the transportation of photo-induced charges of COFs. Zhao et al. demonstrated that the photocatalytic performance of COFs improved with increasing β-ketoenamine content, and they in situ grew COFs (NTU–BDA–THTA) onto NH2-Ti3C2Tx MXene through covalent bonding.110 Optimized HER activity (14228.1 μmol g−1 h−1) was realized when the mass ratio between NTU–BDA–THAT and NH2–Ti3C2Tx was 8:4, better than pristine NTU–BDA–THAT (1127.1 μmol g−1 h−1) and other heterostructures where counterparts combined via non-covalent interactions i.e. hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces. The improved photocatalytic HER performance was from the strong covalent connection, improved conductivity and enhanced charge transfer.

Due to their regular structures, well porous properties, excellent light adsorption and tuneable band gaps, the novel COF/MOF hybrids exhibited attractiveness in photocatalytic water splitting.111 Lan et al. integrated NH2-UiO-66 onto the surface of TpPa-1-COF through covalent bonding. The obtained hybrid preserved high crystallinity and delivered high surface area (Fig. 7c).112 NH2-UiO-66/TpPa-1-COF (4:6) could achieve a photocatalytic HER rate of 23.41 mmol g−1 h−1, ∼21 times that of TpPa-1-COF (Fig. 7d). Good light absorbance from TpPa-1-COF, matched band structures between the constituents and effective charge separation at the covalent heterojunction worked together to boost the photocatalytic HER performance. Jiang et al. constructed a core–shell hybrid structure by growing COF (TFPT–DETH) with hydrazine linkage on the surface of NH2-UiO-66.113 This hybrid structure displayed impressive photocatalytic HER performance, which came from the synergistic effect within the hetero-structure, enhanced light adsorption and the effective exciton separation (Table 1).

Pt cocatalyst was inevitable to suppress the fast recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs in most of the COF-based photocatalysts.114 This appears to limit the development and environmental benefits of solar-driven H2 generation systems. V. Lotsch et al. integrated a COF (N2-COF) with azine linkages as a photoabsorber and non-noble metal Co based molecular cocatalysts (Co-1, 2, and 3) for photocatalytic HER.115 A HER performance of 782 μmol g−1 h−1 and a turnover number (TON) of 54.4 can be achieved. Due to the solubility issue of a molecular cocatalyst, organic solvents were needed, while in prolonged photocatalysis, the molecular cocatalyst would decompose, leading to sharply declined photocatalytic HER performance. To solve these insufficiencies, they subsequently developed a COF with thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-linkage as a photoabsorber and nickel–thiolate cluster assembled in situ in water as a cocatalyst for sustained H2 generation.116 A maximum H2 generation rate of 941 μmol g−1 h−1 and a TONNi more than 103 during a long term H2 production process (>70 h) were achieved. Along this path, MoS2/TpPa-1-COF composites were developed by in situ growing TpPa-1-COF on the surface of exploited MoS2 in DMF.117 MoS2-3%/TpPa-1-COF delivered a better photocatalytic HER performance than that with the same Pt loading. Subsequently, they constructed a series of Ni(OH)2-modified COF composites, Ni(OH)2-X%/TpPa-2 (X stands for molar ratio, Fig. 7e).118 The photocatalytic HER performance of Ni(OH)2-2.5%/TpPa-2 was comparable to TpPa-2 loading 0.3 wt% Pt (Fig. 7f). Moreover, they developed COF-based Z scheme hybrid structures by integrating TpPa-2 with α-Fe2O3 as a noble-metal-free photocatalyst.119 The α-Fe2O3/TpPa-2-COF (3:7) hybrid exhibited optimal H2 generation rate up to 3770 μmol g−1 h−1, 53 times higher than TpPa-2 and comparable to TpPa-2 with a Pt (2%) cocatalyst. Zhao et al. exploited a supramolecular system of NUS-55/[Co-(bpy)3]Cl2 displaying photocatalytic H2 generation rate up to 2480 μmol g−1 h−1, 8 times that of NUS-55(Co) coming from modifying NUS-55 with Co(NO3)2.120 Very recently, Yang et al. presented that photocatalytic water oxidation could be achieved in a bipyridine-based COF (Bp-COF) after coordinating with Co2+, with an O2 evolution rate up to 152 μmol g−1 h−1.121
CO2 reduction
Excessive CO2 emission resulting from fossil fuel burning poses a great threat to the environment and human sustainable development. During the carbon cycle, utilizing CO2 as a carbon source through a photochemical or electrochemical process to obtain value-added carbon products is a promising approach to settle the energy crisis and global warming issues. This photochemical or electrochemical process consists of two main aspects: (1) fixing CO2 into epoxides for fabricating carbonates122,123 and (2) reducing CO2 to CO, CH3OH or other value-added chemicals. With crystalline and adjustable structures, COFs can be adopted for these processes according to the following reasons: (1) porous properties facilitating the adsorption of CO2, (2) easy functional modification and (3) the electron transmission properties can be tuned through molecular design. In this section, emphasis is put on elaborating COFs in photocatalytic reduction of CO2.
Liu et al. adopted two triazine based imine-linked COFs (COF-JLU6 and COF-JLU7) as organocatalysts for photocatalytic cycloaddition of CO2 (Fig. 8).124 With more heteroatoms in the pore channels, COF-JLU7 exhibited a capacity of 151 mg g−1 toward CO2 adsorption (273 K, 1 bar) and delivered higher efficiency for CO2 cycloaddition in the presence of cocatalyst tetra-nbutylammonium bromide (TBAB).

Baeg et al. firstly employed visible light active COF film, 2D CTF, for photocatalytic reduction to CO2 to HCOOH (204.14 μmol, 2 h).125 Through the condensation between cyanuric chloride and perylene diimide, triazine based COF films were prepared. These films were endowed with enhanced light adsorption capacity resulting from a molecular structure with rational band gap and electron channel where all these features facilitated charge carrier separation and transfer. Two azine-based COFs (ACOF-1 and N3-COF) were developed and utilized for CO2 adsorption and subsequent photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into CH3OH in the presence of H2O (Fig. 9a).126 These two COFs delivered higher performance over other semiconductor counterparts because of the extended conjugation degree and affinity toward CO2. This was the first attempt at adopting a COF for CO2 photoreduction without any sacrificial agents. Utilizing an imine-exchange strategy, Jiang et al. prepared ultrathin and freestanding 2D COF nanosheets (NSs) where large rigid groups were sneaked into the reaction systems to constraint π–π stacking (Fig. 9b).127 Superior efficiency was achieved in COF-367-Co than physically mixed COF-367 NSs and Co2+ when converting CO2 to CO, demonstrating that the active sites were Co–N4 moieties rather than the isolated Co2+ ions. A series of porphyrin-tetrathiafulvalene COFs (TTCOF-M, M = 2H, Zn, Ni, Cu) were built for CO2 reduction without any photosensitizers or sacrificial agents (Fig. 9c and d).128 Under visible light irradiation (420–800 nm), electrons transferred from the electron-efficient TTF donor to the electron acceptor porphyrin, which accelerated the separation and transfer of electron–hole pairs. During these processes, two half reactions, i.e. oxidation of H2O and reduction of CO2, were lined and H2O worked as an electron donor for CO2 reduction. The optimal TTCOF-Zn achieved the highest CO evolution of 12.33 μmol after 60 h and selectivity (almost 100%) among TTCOF-M. COF-semiconductor heterojunctions were developed by integrating COFs and semiconductors including TiO2, Bi2WO6, α-Fe2O3etc. for photoreduction of CO2 to CO with H2O as an electron donor without extra photosensitizers and co-catalysts (Fig. 9e).129 COF-318 based Z-scheme heterojunctions can achieve a generation rate of 69.67, 57.1, and 31.43 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, superior to pure COF-318, TiO2, and also their mixture. Mechanism inquiry revealed that electrons transferred from semiconductors to the COF skeleton through chemical bonding for CO2 reduction, while the accumulated positive holes in semiconductors drove the H2O oxidation. Along the concept proposed by Lan et al.,128 Kong et al. designed and synthesized a donor–acceptor (D–A) COF via condensation between the carbazole-based donor and triazine-based acceptor (Fig. 9f).130 The D–A structures could improve exciton dissociation and charge carrier transfer where CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation were permitted without co-catalysts. Mechanism investigation indicated that COOH* might be an essential intermediate and nitrogen atom in triazine rings might be the true active sites.

For designing effective photocatalyst systems, incorporating photosensitizers with COFs can further boost their photocatalytic performance. In 2018, Huang et al. developed a photoactive COF via condensation between triazine and dipyridyl monomers, and Re-COF was received by decorating this COF with Re(CO)5Cl, which exhibited obvious light adsorption and charge separation properties (Fig. 10a).131 This hybrid could effectively reduce CO2 to CO with high selectivity (98%) and yield (15 mmol g−1 for more than 20 h, Fig. 10b), superior to Re(CO)5Cl. Spectroscopy characterization verified the electron transferred from the COF backbones to Re(CO)5Cl in the excited state, which improved the CO2 reduction performance. Through a similar molecular design and synthesis vision, Zou et al. fixed Re(CO)5Cl into the pores of TpBpy forming Re-TpBpy, and the CO generation amount by Re-TpBpy was twice as high as that by Re(CO)5Cl.133 The favorable crystallinity and porosity may have positive effects on CO2 reduction for COFs (Fig. 10c).132 A stable CC linked, bipyridine-containing COF, Bpy-sp2c-COF, and its amorphous polymer counterpart were prepared by changing the solvents from a 1,2-dichlorobenzene/1-butanol mixture to 1,4-dioxane. After metalation, Re-Bpy-sp2c-COF delivered an average CO generation rate of 1040 μmol g−1 h−1 for more than 17.5 h (Fig. 10d) while the amorphous one exhibited significantly lower CO2 reduction efficiency with a TON of 2.3 compared with 12.9 for Re-Bpy-sp2c-COF.

Developing active metal functionalized COFs is a reasonable and promising strategy in enhancing photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, as metal centers could activate CO2 molecules during photoreduction.134,135 As shown in Fig. 11a, the first example of a metalized COF for CO2 photoreduction was reported by Lan et al.136 Investigation of a series of anthraquinone-containing COFs anchored with transition metals has verified that the anthraquinone groups facilitated electron transport, adsorption and metal ion bonding.137,138 They found that DQTP COF-Co showed superior CO generation (Fig. 11b) while DQTP COF-Zn delivered high-ranking selectivity toward HCOOH generation (Fig. 11c). The differences in activity and selectivity were elaborated in a “two-pathway” mechanism. Ni-TpBpy showed outstanding CO2 photoreduction performance which was prepared through the chelation of dipyridyl building blocks of TpBpy (Fig. 11d).127 With the existence of TEOA and Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O, a CO generation rate of 811 μmol g−1 h−1 and a 96% selectivity over H2 evolution were achieved (Fig. 11e). The synergistic effects of the COF skeleton and Ni sites together contributed to this superior performance, where TpBpy acted as a host for CO2 and the Ni sites activated CO2 and suppressed H2 evolution.

Organic transformation
Photocatalytic organic transformations driven by visible-light are green and inexhaustible, and can overcome the drawbacks such as cost and environmental issues faced in traditional industry. Due to their tuneable bandgaps, structural merits and stability, COFs have drawn considerable attention in recent years as promising platforms for photocatalytic organic transformations including redox and coupling reactions.
Through a “killing two birds with one stone” strategy, COFs (LZU-190, 191 and 192) with benzoxazole linkage were developed by Wang et al. where the benzoxazole linkages not only improved the stability of the COFs but also acted as functional groups for photocatalytically oxidizing arylboronic acids to phenols (Fig. 12a).139 They first adopted the transformation of 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid as a model reaction. Interestingly, with iPr2NEt as a sacrificial agent, LZU-90 can achieve a 99% reaction yield for at least 20 cycles under air. They further enlarged the substrate scope to explore the generality of LZU-90. The results revealed that arylboronic acids with electron-withdrawing substituents exhibited excellent transformation yields while prolonged time was needed to realize satisfactory yields for arylboronic acids with electron-neutral or donor substituents. The main reason for this fantastic photocatalytic performance was that benzoxazole linkages decreased the optical bandgap and enhanced the visible-light absorption. Similarly, Chen et al. synthesized a BBO-COF with imine linkage through a “two-in-one” strategy41 for photocatalytically transforming arylboronic acids to phenols with excellent substrate endurance and cycling stability.140

Selectively oxidizing sulfides to sulfoxides via singlet oxygen (1O2)141–143 is another important photocatalytic transformation since sulfoxides are pivotal intermediates in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Alemán et al. developed imine linked COFs with laminar, spherical and 3D architectures, and they verified that the crystallinity facilitated the photocatalytic sulfoxidation reactions of COFs with laminar and spherical morphology while showing little effect on 3D structured COFs.147
Xiao et al. constructed a series of porous materials based on pyrene, tetraphenylethylene and thiadiazole with different crystallinity and topology, and investigated the relationship between these factors and photocatalytic performance (Fig. 12b).144 In addition, they explored the influence of lattice symmetry, visible-light absorption and band position on the photocatalytic ability of the corresponding COFs for the first time. Under 10 W LED irradiation (>420 nm), Py-TD can achieve an efficiency of 84% compared to 51% for Py-TD POP in converting α-terpinene into ascaridole, which illustrated the importance of crystallinity. This efficiency is also about 1.6–3.5 times higher than other COFs. Enhanced visible light absorption and proper bandgap structures were responsible for the superior efficiency of Py-TD over Etta-Py and Py-Py. As to Etta-Td, it possessed broader light absorption and lower LUMO energy level, but delivered inferior performance. The authors attributed this result to the differences in charge-carrier lifetime. The valence band of Py-Td with C2/m symmetry delivered more significant dispersion than Etta-Td with P6m symmetry, thus giving better charge-carrier mobility. Furthermore, Py-Td displayed excellent efficiency, selectivity and long cycle stability in photooxidizing thioanisole to the corresponding sulfoxide. Wang et al. selectively designed and prepared two porphyrin-based COFs with 2D (2D-PdPorCOF) and 3D dimensions (3D-PdPorCOF), and for the first time, they explored the influence of the dimensions of COFs on their functionalities.148 More exposed palladium porphyrin sites, cooperating with size selectivity, endowed 3D-PdPorCOF with better photocatalytic performance in photooxidizing thioanisole to the corresponding sulfoxide than 2D-PdPorCOF.
Photocatalytic reductive reactions are substantial constituents of organic synthesis. A Pd doped core–shell MOFs@COFs hybrid was developed for photocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins.149 In comparison with pristine TiATA, Pd/TiATA and TiATA@LZU-1, Pd/TiATA@LZU1 delivered better performance (99% conversion rate and selectivity of styrene in 15 min) where the Pd nanoparticles, MOF core and COF shell acted as a reactive center, electron donor and mediator for electron transfer, respectively. Similarly, Kim et al. constructed a sandwich structure for photocatalytic hydrogenation of styrene, which existed in the interfaces between Ti-MOF@Pt and DM-LZU1.150 In this hybrid structure, Pt facilitated the charge separation produced by Ti-MOF, and the DM-LZU1 shell enriched the reactants. As a result, full conversion of styrene to ethylbenzene was realized in 40 min with a TOF of 577 h−1. Liu et al. presented a donor–acceptor (D–A) type new COF (COF-JLU22) with good porous properties and stability, broad range visible-light absorption and good photoelectric response for reductive dehalogenation of phenacyl bromide derivatives.151 Under optimized conditions, COF-JLU22 can deliver a 99% conversion in dehalogenation of phenacyl bromide. Furthermore, no conversion differences were captured when the substrate scope expanded to those bearing electron-withdrawing or donating constituents. Tang et al. scrutinized the factors that affected the photocatalytic performance of COFs in a dehalogenation reaction.152 The results revealed that COFs possessing –OH and triazine constituents delivered the best photocatalytic performance, as –OH groups narrowed the band gaps, while triazine rings not only narrowed the bandgap but also enhanced the charge separation and conductivity.
Directly and efficiently transforming C–H to C–C is highly desirable in organic synthesis. Wu et al. developed a COF with hydrazine linkages (TFB-COF) which was applied in a photocatalytic cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction.153 TFB-COF delivered highly efficient performance in catalyzing CDC reactions between tetrahydroisoquinolines and wide nucleophiles. This high efficiency originated from the well porous and light-harvesting properties. Liu et al. also researched the aerobic CDC reaction using the designed donor–acceptor (D–A) type imine COF (COF-JLU5) as a photocatalyst (Fig. 12c).145 Owing to the combined features including crystallinity, porosity, stability, and columnar arrays, COF-JLU5 could efficiently catalyze C–H functionalization with wide substrate scope and recyclability. Xi et al. prepared a series of D–A 2D COFs (TTCOF-1, 2, and 3) with imine linkages via [4+3] condensation.154 With tetraphenylethylene moieties as electron donors and triazine moieties as electron acceptors, TTCOFs displayed superior activity in catalyzing CDC reactions.
Selective oxidation of amines into imines has become one of the most promising chemical transformations in photocatalysis since some influential work.155 Yang et al. developed a hydrophilic COF (TFPT-BMTH) by introducing 2-methoxyethoxy into the pore channels of a COF.156 TFPT–BMTH could achieve conversion efficiency over 97% in photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amines at room temperature under ambient conditions. Highly selective conversion from amines to imine in minutes was realized by combining Por-sp2c-COF with CC linkage photocatalysis and TEMPO under red (623 nm) LED (Fig. 12d).146 Conversions with selectivity over 90% were seen in 30 and 20 min for primary and secondary amines, respectively.
The regeneration process of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is the crucial step for exploiting solar energy utilization and biomass production.158 Zhao et al. designed a photosystem I (PSI) using a fully conjugated COF (TP-COF) with CC linkage for regeneration of NADH (Fig. 13).157 The CC linkage endows TP-COF with high stability and extended electron-delocalization range. Due to the introduction of triazine constituents, a band gap of 2.36 eV with −3.23 eV LUMO was realized for TP-COF, giving it potential in artificial photocatalysis PSI. As a proof, NADH regeneration was carried out for photocatalytically synthesizing L-glutamate using TP-COF as a catalyst, and a record-breaking yield of 97% in 12 min was achieved. This is the first report on harnessing COFs as an artificial PSI. Similarly, through the post oxidative cyclization, they further developed two ultrastable conjugated COFs with a thieno[3,2-c]pyridine linkage for photocatalytic NADH regeneration.77 B-COF-2 and T-COF-2 displayed an NADH regeneration efficiency of 5.5% and 74.0%, respectively, better than their corresponding COF precursors with imine linkages.

Apart from the abovementioned photocatalytic redox, coupling and NADH regeneration, COFs also delivered promising prospects in photocatalytic asymmetric reactions,159E–Z isomerization of olefins,160 arylation and alkylation,161 free radical polymerization,162 radical addition–cyclization163etc.
Degradation of pollutants
Organic dyes including methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB) etc. released from industries such as paper, leather and food have posed a significant threat to ecology and public health.106 When harnessing COFs as photocatalysts, active species can be generated which participate and accelerate degradation processes.164 Research of COF-based materials for photocatalytic pollutant degradation is still at its infancy and only discrete examples have been reported.
Cai et al. integrated a C3N4 component into a COF backbone and the obtained COF, TpMA, could decompose methyl orange (MO) and phenol (Fig. 14a and b).165 In this COF, the triazine moieties, cyclic ketone constituents, and conjugated structure served as photoactive sites, electron-withdrawing units and a photo-generated electron shift platform, respectively. TpMA exhibited superior photodegradation performance toward MO and phenol than g-C3N4. Afterwards, they investigated the influences of active site density and conjugation degree on photocatalytic performance (Fig. 14c and d).166 A series of COFs using the identical aldehyde and three different nitrogen-containing monomers with diverse steric and electronic variations were developed. COFA+C showed superior photocatalytic performance than COFA+B and COFA+D resulting from its rational active sites and band structure. Zhao et al. synthesized TpMA at a large scale through a mechanochemical route and by controlling the solvent and catalyst amount during the preparation process, COFs with thread and ribbon-like morphology were obtained.167 The ribbon-like one delivered higher efficiency in charge transportation than the thread one and comparable activity in depredating phenol toward the one prepared through a solvothermal method. By employing periodic and ultrasmall pore structures, Lu et al. stabilized and encapsulated Au clusters into their newly developed thiol-modified 2D COFs and obtained Au@COF (Fig. 14e).168 The photostability was enhanced by combination of ultrasmall pores and S–Au bonding. In addition, a Z-scheme photocatalytic system was established by a COF-S–Au bridge, which improved the charge separation efficiency and further promoted the photocatalytic performance (Fig. 14f). Through modulating the spatial distribution of the Au nanocrystals in COFs, the photoinduced charge-carrier separation and utilization were improved.169 COFs with sparsely distributed Au nanocrystals, Au3SP/COFs, exhibited impressive photocatalytic RhB degradation performance, where over 95% content was removed in 2 h. Introducing COF as the interface engineering agent, Zhang et al. prepared ultrafine and well dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles ranging from 1.4–3.2 nm with Fe doping.170 Impressively, 5Fe–TiO2@COF can degrade MB at a trace amount (0.4 mg). The outstanding performance originated from the following aspects according to the authors: the COF utilization can (1) control the growth of TiO2 nanoparticles at ultrafine size and stabilize them; (2) enhance adsorption of organic dyes and (3) accelerate mass transportation processes. Zhang et al. explored hybrid porous materials by intergrading MOFs and COFs (Fig. 14g–i).171 The obtained hybrid materials, NH2-MIL-68@TPA-COF, expressed valid photocatalytic RhB degradation performance.

In short, COFs display great promising superiorities in photocatalysis including the HER, CO2RR, organic transformation and environmental remediation. By introducing functional groups, increasing the conjugation degree, improving the crystallinity of the CTFs, constructing hybrids, etc. issues like cost, stability, light harvesting, and recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers have been settled. Still, more considerations should be taken to further enhance the photocatalytic performance even for practical application: (1) lack of systematical regulations and methodologies to ensure the crystallinity of the COFs. (2) At present, COFs often just show their power in the laboratory and bear large-scale synthesis limitations and the cost of the building blocks. (3) COFs are linked via dynamic bonds to ensure the crystallinity of the COFs; hence, the stability should also be taken into account. (4) When applied for photocatalytic HER, noble metals, like Pt metal, are indispensable as a cocatalyst. In addition, utilizing COFs for overall water splitting needs more attention.
Electrocatalysis
At present, energy related electrocatalysis is mainly focused on the water and carbon energy cycle. The water cycle is mainly focused on water electrolytic cells and the hydrogen–oxygen fuel cell. By electrolysis of water through the HER and OER, clean hydrogen production is achieved. By subsequent ORR and HOR in a hydrogen–oxygen fuel cell, electricity is produced. Reutilizing CO2via electrochemical reduction to form value added chemicals in an ideal way compared with other CO2 fixation strategies. For either the water or carbon energy cycle, their performances are dominated by the electrocatalysts. Hence, developing electrocatalysts with favorable activity, selectivity and durability is of crucial importance. In particular, the catalytic activity and selectivity are dominated by the exposed active sites. Noble metal catalysts, such as Pt/C, RuO2, IrO2, etc. deliver favorable electrochemical performance, but stability and scarcity issues prevented them from large-scale application.172 COFs have the following advantages when applied for electrocatalysis: (1) the covalent bonding between the building blocks endows COFs with high chemical and thermal stability. (2) Various secondary building blocks favor the synthesis of COFs with specific architectures and functionalities. (3) The porous structure could load more active sites. (4) The tunable pore size within COFs could be of benefit for confining active moieties with different size, such as single atom catalysts, and nanoparticles. (5) The periodic and regular structures enable exact catalytic site control and thus provide a possibility toward structure-performance relationships. (6) Endowed with abundant heteroatoms, COFs can act as precursors to produce heteroatom doped carbons.
HER
Due to its zero-carbon emission, high gravimetric energy density and far-ranging sources, hydrogen has been regarded as a promising alternative for fossil energy to meet nowadays the energy demand and solve environmental issues. Sustainable hydrogen generation has always been imprinting the minds of researchers all over the world. HER through electrocatalytic or photocatalytic water splitting has been considered as the most reliable, efficient and hopeful route for sustainable production of hydrogen. Rapid development in using COF-based materials for photo-/electrocatalytic water splitting hydrogen generation has been achieved. In this section, COF-based materials for electrocatalytic HER will be discussed.
Pradhan et al. for the first time, harnessed a metal-free pristine 2D COF (SB-PORPy-COF) for electrochemical HER application (Fig. 15a).173 SB-PORPy-COF exhibited permanent microporosity, appropriate surface area, and superior chemical stability. The π-electronic conjugation between pyrene and porphyrin building blocks constructed conducting channels. SB-PORPy-COF displayed a favourable onset overpotential of ca. 50 mV and cycling stability with no obvious activity loss after 500 cycles under acid conditions (Fig. 15b). Bimetallic COF-derived carbon materials were applied for the HER.174 With abundant Co and Fe nanoparticles (NPs) and hierarchical pore structures, C–Fe,Co-COF delivered an onset potential of −0.12 V, an overpotential of 280 mV (10 mA cm−2) and a Tafel slope of 100 mV decade−1 at 0.5 M H2SO4. At 1 M KOH, the overpotential negatively shifted to 330 mV and the Tafel slope increased to 149 mV decade−1. To boost the HER performance under alkaline conditions, COF-bpy-TPP was developed (Fig. 15c).175 Pt NPs were grown within COF-bpy-TPP and the size and distribution of the Pt NPs was constrained. With a Pt NP size of about 3 nm and narrow size distribution, PtNPs@COF can achieve a H2 generation rate of 17.4 mmol mg−1 in an hour, 14 times that of Pt/C with the same Pt loading under alkaline conditions (CO2-saturated NaHCO3 solution, pH = 8.3, Fig. 15d).

ORR and OER
Oxygen electrocatalysis including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a critical role in sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies, like metal–air batteries. Despite the superiorities including safety, eco-friendliness, and high theoretical energy density, metal–air battery practical application was restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the ORR and OER during the discharging/charging process, respectively. To solve these issues, precious metal catalysts were developed for oxygen electrocatalysis including Pt/C for ORR, and IrOx/RuOx for OER. Not only did the scarcity and high-cost of these catalysts add practical application burdens, but their catalytic and endurance performance were also barely satisfactory. Hence, developing cost-effective and high-performance ORR and OER catalysts is crucially important and under extensive effort. Due to their fascinating porous properties, tuneable structures and functionalities, COFs have attracted extensive research interest as ORR and OER catalysts. Compared with noble metal catalysts, pure COFs share low cost, but bear low conductivity and activity. Post synthetic modifications, elaborate molecule design and synthetic strategies are necessary for enhancing COF-based oxygen electrocatalysis performance.
Introducing active sites such as metal ions, metal complexes into COFs or combing COFs with conductive carbon materials including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene etc. was a practicable way to solve the low catalytic or conductivity issue of COFs. A sp3-nitrogen-rich IISERP-COF2 with flexibility was presented for supporting CoxNiy(OH)2 NPs (Fig. 16a).176 The NP size was limited to about 2 nm and displayed even distribution when growing within the COF support which enhanced the electronic interaction between them. At 10 mA cm−2, the composites can achieve an overpotential of 258 mV (Fig. 16b, 5) and a Tafel slope of 38.9 mV dec−1 (Fig. 16c, 5). Benzimidazole-linked IISERP-COF3 with low bandgap was subsequently developed for supporting and constraining the growth of Ni3N NPs (Fig. 16d).177 The obtained composites could catalyze the OER with an inferior overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 16e) and oxygen generation rate of 230 mmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 16f). The skeleton of IISERP-COF3 not only contributed to the even distribution of active NPs, but also accelerated charge carrier transfer, boosting the OER performance. By coordinating Co2+ ions with bipyridine edges, TpBpy COF was introduced as an OER catalyst under neutral conditions (Fig. 16g).178 Co-TpBpy delivered high accessible areas and stability with an overpotential of 400 mV (1 mA cm−2) and can sustain over 1000 cycles. A layer-structured porphyrin COF (POF, about 4 nm) was coated on the surface of CNTs and harnessed as a Zn–air battery cathode material for accelerating the ORR and OER process (Fig. 16h).179 The CNT@POF cathode delivered 0.71 V voltage gap, 237 mW cm−2 power density (Fig. 16i) and over 200 routine endurances, superior to noble metal catalysts (Pt/C, Ir/C). A cation exchange strategy was introduced to prepare Co, V bimetallic co-doped COF toward OER catalysis.180 Firstly, –SO3H-anchored COF, COF-SO3H, was synthesized, and then COF-SO3H was ammoniated using NH3·H2O forming NH4+ anchored COF, NH4@COF-SO3H. Metal incorporated catalysts, CoxV1−x@COF-SO3 were obtained through the exchange between NH4+ and Co2+ and V3+. Under alkaline conditions (1 M KOH), optimized Co0.5V0.5@COF-SO3 could achieve a TOF of 0.098 s−1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, superior to most reported Co-based OER catalysts. The excellent performance was from the high metal-atom utilization efficiency, and the strong electronic effects of Co and V also exhibited their contribution. Furthermore, catalytically active Co0.5V0.5@COF-SO3 can be recycled to catalytically inert COF-SO3H after HCl treatment.

Pyrolysis is a conducive way of transforming insulated COFs to conductive carbons. According to this strategy, several COF-derived carbons have been developed for oxygen electrocatalysis. It should be pointed out that during calcination, how to maintain the original structural features including porous and regular properties is a huge challenge. Mao et al. utilized COFs as precursors for developing efficient M/N/C-type ORR catalysts via pyrolysis for the first time (Fig. 17a and b).181 By pyrolyzing previously developed Co-COF,182,183 a series of COF-derived carbons (Co-COF-x, x = 600, 700, 800, and 900) were developed. Co-COF-900 delivered effective ORR performance comparable to Pt/C. This work gave new ideas for preparing high performance novel metal free ORR electrocatalysts. Modifying Tp-Bpy-COF with bipyridine linkages with Fe and Co ions, Fe,Co-COF was received and calcinated to generate C–Fe,Co-COF (Fig. 17c–f).184 C–Fe,Co-COF exhibited impressive multifunctional electrochemical performance toward the ORR, OER, and HER. Compared with Pt/C, C–Fe,Co-COF displayed a 50 mV more positive E1/2 potential, higher jlimit, and smaller Tafel slope. C-Fe,Co-COF delivered overpotentials of 330 mV (HER) and 360 mV (OER) for the HER and OER, respectively, in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm−2. High N content, mesoporous structures and sufficient active sites contributed to the superior multifunctional electrochemical catalytic performance. Compared with single N heteroatom doping, co-doping or multi-doping will further enhance the oxygen electrocatalysis performance of carbon-based materials. Duan et al. developed a N,P co-doped carbon material by first pyrolysis and subsequent phosphorization of a 2D COF.185 The derived co-doping carbon displayed excellent ORR performance with 0.81 V half-wave potential, 0.57 mA cm−2 limiting current density, 72 mV decade−1 Tafel slope and CH3OH tolerance to that of commercial Pt/C. A ZIF-67/COF composite was prepared by growing ZIF-67 on the surface of a COF with benzoic acid modification, and then the composite was calcinated to form N-doped carbon (NPC) with uniform Co3O4 distribution resulting from the regular rearrangement of nanopores within the COF (Fig. 17g–i).186 For OER evaluation, Co3O4/NPC-2 showed an onset potential of 1.5 V and an overpotential of 330 mV (10 mA cm−2) derived from the cooperation of Co3O4 nanoparticles and NPC. In addition, Co3O4/NPC-2 exhibited a 79 mV decade−1 Tafel slope, a mass activity of 130 A g−1 (400 mV overpotential) and long cycling stability. By introducing COFs as sacrificial precursors, Vaidhyanathan et al. developed two RuO2 based OER catalysts by utilizing a soft-pyrolysis strategy.187 Owing to confinement from the pores of graphitic carbons obtained from soft-pyrolysis of the COF, the growth of RuO2 nanoparticles was limited, with a 2.5–4 nm pore size distribution. These catalysts exhibited lower overpotential and Tafel slope compared with commercial RuO2 toward OER performance, which came from the ultra-small RuO2 nanoparticle and uniform distribution in the graphitic carbon derived from the COF.

Generally, direct pyrosis of 2D COFs will lead to the loss of structural and porous properties of the precursors and the electrolyte accessible surface area, and thus mass transfer would be decreased in the derived carbons. Combining 2D skeleton design merits of COF and template guidance during the pyrolysis process would facilitate the formation of 2D graphitic carbons with good conductivity and porous properties. PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000 was obtained by pyrolyzing phytic acid (PA) loaded PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF at 1000 °C under a N2 atmosphere and then it was pyrolyzed at 900 °C under an NH3 atmosphere to obtain the final ORR catalyst, PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000NH3 (Fig. 18a–d).188 During pyrolysis, PA acted as a guidance template and P heteroatom source. PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000NH3 displayed 2D structures with mirco/mesopores and abundant N and P dopant. For the ORR, compared with commercial Pt/C, PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000NH3 displayed a positive shift of the onset and half-wave potentials by 30 and 50 mV, respectively, and an enhanced limit current by 1.2 mA cm−2. For the OER, PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000NH3 displayed a current density of −10.2 mA cm−2 at 0.97 V, 10 times that of Pt/C (1.01 mA cm−2). Superior performances of PA@TAPT–DHTA-COF1000NH3 rooted from the micro/meso porous structures, where mesopores accelerated the transport of both reactants and products toward active sites. To further enhance the content of mesopores in the COF-derived carbon materials, Thomas et al. introduced silica nanoparticles as a template during p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) assisted mechanochemical synthesis of bipyridine-containing COF, SiO2@TpBpy (Fig. 18e–h).189 Fe and N doped carbon, mC–TpBpy–Fe, with abundant mesopore structures was obtained via carbonatization and subsequent template removal procedures. mC–TpBpy–Fe delivered a comparable half-wave potential to Pt/C (0.845 V vs. 0.852 V) and a superior limit current density than Pt/C (5.92 mA cm−2vs. 5.57 mA cm−2). When harnessing mC–TpBpy–Fe as a catalyst for Zn–air batteries, a high open-circuit potential (OCP) of 1.5 V and specific capacity of about 625 and 543 mA h gZn−1 at 20 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively, could be achieved. Furthermore, they use the similar hard template strategy to develop pristine COFs with micro/macro pore structures where micropores enhance the surface area and macropores accelerate mass transport when harnessed as an OER electrocatalyst.190 The macropore structures and compositions of the COFs can be tuned by utilizing the size of polystyrene spheres (PSs, hard template) and the selection of precursors. After Co ion coordination, macro-TpBpy–Co exhibited superior OER electrocatalytic performance compared with a single microporous Co ion coordinated COF and other Co-based polymer catalysts.

As an emerging research frontier, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have shown promising potential in energy conversion and storage technologies due to it reducing material costs and changing the pathways in catalytic processes. Endowed with abundant N atoms with lone electron pairs for coordinating metals, imine-linked COFs are potential platforms for shouldering SACs. Two COF-300 derived carbon materials, Co@COF900 and COF900, were obtained by pyrolyzing Co2+@COF-300 and COF-300 under 900 °C (Fig. 19a–d).191 With 0.17 wt% Co content loading, Co@COF900 can achieve a 0.93 V E0 value, 0.86 V E1/2 and 6.2 mA cm−2jlimit, superior to Pt/C. The electron transfer number for Co@COF900 was determined to be 3.75–3.91 with trace H2O2 generation (2–6%), evidencing a 4-electron ORR mechanism while this number for COF900 was 3.2–3.6 with a H2O2 yield of 19–46%. The ORR performance of Co@COF900 was decreased under acid conditions (0.1 M HClO4), as only Co–Nx sites were active for the ORR under acid conditions, while both Co–Nx sites and NPCs worked for the ORR under base conditions. This conclusion was deducted from the poisoning of the catalyst with SCN− and leaching of the Co with OER measurements. To explore the influence of multiatom Fe–N–C existence in its SAC toward ORR performance, Zeng et al. developed an NPC with both atomic Fe–N4 and Fe clusters constituted by several atoms (FeAC@FeSA–N–C) distribution utilizing TAPB–PDA COF as a precursor. Pure NPC (N–C) and SAC catalysts, FeSA–N–C, were also synthesized for comparison.192 In 0.1 M KOH, FeAC@FeSA–N–C delivered the largest positive peak at 0.82 V compared with the lowest 0.66 V of N–C, indicating the crucial role of the Fe atom in boosting the ORR performance. FeAC@FeSA–N–C exhibited a superior E1/2 and smaller Tafel slope compared with commercial Pt/C. FeAC@FeSA–N–C and FeSA–N–C demonstrated an almost 4-electron pathway with trace H2O2 generation like Pt/C, while N–C delivered a 2-electron dominant ORR mechanism, corresponding to the Tafel slopes. DFT calculations revealed that the superior ORR performance was mainly from the Fe–N4 active sites, while the Fe clusters could further enhance the performance. Currently, the synthesis of M–N–C type electrochemical catalysts is highly reliant on the pyrolysis process at high temperature. A high temperature pyrolysis process inevitably causes structural changes and even destroys the material structure and active sites, leading to complicated preparation procedures and poorly reproducible electrocatalytic performance, finally. Xiang et al. developed a pyrolysis-free strategy through the intermolecular interaction between fully-conjugated Fe-phthalocyanine COF (COFBTC) and graphene for preparing SACs with high ORR performance (Fig. 19e–i).193 In addition to being pyrolysis free, active Fe–N–C obtained through this strategy displayed more even distribution. At 0.85 V, the obtained SACs, pfSAC-Fe, achieved an E1/2 of 0.91 V and 25.86 mA cm−2 kinetic current density, compared to 0.86 V and 6.49 mA cm−2 of Pt/C in KOH solution. When utilizing pfSAC-Fe as an electrocatalyst for a Zn–air battery, a 1.41 V OCP, power density (123.43 mW cm−2) and capacity (732 mA h gZn−1 at 100 mA cm−2) were achieved. Through absorption-pyrolysis procedures, Li et al. prepared a collection of noble metal free SACs including Fe, Co, and Ni anchored on COF-derived carbon spheres as an ORR electrocatalyst.194 The as-obtained Fe-ISAS/CN exhibited more positive overpotential and higher kinetic current density than the commercial Pt/C, with good stability and CH3OH tolerance.

Developing pristine COFs for high-performance oxygen electrocatalysis is challenging and important for it simplifying the preparation process, reducing the needed materials, and saving cost. Under the guidance of theoretical calculation, a planar phenazine-linked COF with satisfactory stability, COF-C4N, was designed and synthesized and presented high OER activity (Fig. 20a).195 COF-C4N displayed a 349 mV overpotential (10 mA cm−2, Fig. 20b) and a 64 mV dec−1 Tafel slope. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that the superior OER performance was from the high crystallinity and stability, rational band gap, and the fact that the C atoms were activated as catalytic sites by the neighboring N atoms. Imine-linked 2D COF was synthesized and exploited into COF nanosheets (CONs) for ORR electrocatalysis (Fig. 20c).196 As an electron deficienct group, naphthalene diimide building blocks can accept electrons from the oxygen atom, making NDI-COF a candidate toward the ORR. To solve processable issues of COFs toward devices, a soluble COF, COFBTC, with regular Fe single atom distribution and conjugated structures was created (Fig. 20d).197 Calculations exhibited that Fe single atoms could form strong interactions with solvent molecules, thus, COFBTC was in situ charge exploited and the hydroxyl groups inserted the stack layers of COFBTC forming a true solution (pH = 13). COFBTC delivered superior ORR catalytic performance with a 0.9 V E1/2. COFBTC true solution can be directly harnessed for a Zn–air flow battery. Compared with Pt/C, the Zn–air flow battery with COFBTC solution displayed better long cycle endurance (Fig. 20e). Bhaumik et al. prepared a new thiadiazole-based COF, C4-SHz COF, through the condensation between 1,3,5-tris(4-formylphenyl)benzene and 2,5-dihydrazinyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole.198 Resulting from its regular structure, high surface area and abundant active sites, C4-SHz COF showed high OER activity with 270 mV onset potential and lower overpotential. For precise and controllable synthesis of active sites in pristine COFs for the ORR, Fang et al. elaborately designed and synthesized two thiophene-sulfur COFs (Fig. 20f).199 The results revealed that the thiophene-containing COF delivered superior ORR performance compared with that without thiophene, and the ORR performance enhanced with increasing thiophene content (Fig. 20g and h). All these results demonstrated that the thiophene–sulfur building blocks were the true active sites.

CO2 reduction
Electrocatalysis is a proven strategy for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals i.e. CO and CH3OH7,200,201 or converting chemical energy into electricity through fuel cells.202 Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been regarded as a straightforward and efficient route for the interconversion between chemical energy and electricity for a simple device, environmental compatibility and the possibility of combining other renewable resources including wind, solar, etc. Yaghi et al. firstly utilized an imine linked COF platform for electrochemically reducing CO2 to CO (Fig. 21a and b).203 They developed two Co porphyrin based COFs, COF-366-Co and COF-367-Co, via Schiff base reaction. Owing to the precise control of the active metal site distribution within a COF structure, expanding and functionalizing frameworks without changing the topological structures, and electronically tuning the coordination environment, these COFs delivered superior faradaic efficiencies and turnover numbers compared with molecular Co complexes. Optimized CO2 reduction performance was achieved in COF-367-Co which possessed a higher surface area, channel width and interlayer distance. To further enhance the conversion, building block heterogeneity was introduced and the heterogeneous structure was demonstrated showing positive influences in improving selectivity and activity. Furthermore, they functionalized the reticular parent with different electro-withdrawing groups obtaining COF-366-Co, COF-366-(OMe)2-Co, COF-366-F-Co, and COF-366-(F)4-Co to explore the influence of electronic tuning of the active sites toward electrochemical performance (Fig. 21c and d).204 Resulting from the strong electron-withdrawing ability affecting active sites (Co), a negative cathodic shift and higher current density were seen in COF-366-F-Co compared with COF-366-Co. This work opened an avenue achieving high electrochemical CO2RR performance through constructing electronic character-function for COF-based electrocatalysts. COF-based electrocatalysts with high chemical stability are desirable, but ambivalence stems from the linkage strength and the microscopic reversibility needed for the crystallization procedure.206 Deng et al. enhanced the covalence of both 2D and 3D COF (COF-300-AR and COF-366-M-AR, AR stood for “after reduction”) by reduction of the imine linkages into amine linkages (Fig. 21e and f).74 COF-300-AR was deposited on a Ag electrode for electrochemical CO2RR and the CO conversion faradaic efficiency advanced from 13% to 53% (−0.7 V vs. RHE) and 43% to 80% (−0.85 V vs. RHE) compared with the pure Ag electrode, respectively. To improve the low CO FE of COF-based electrocatalysts (<90%), which might be from the worse electron transmission efficiency or oriented electron pathway, Lan et al. developed a series of COFs, M-TTCOFs, by condensation between the well-known electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and metalloporphyrin as an electron acceptor (Fig. 21g and h).205 M-TTCOFs possessed merits of not only high porosity and chemical stability, and uniform active site distribution, but also an oriented electron transmission pathway from TTF to metalloporphyrin when harnessed as a catalyst for electrochemical CO2RR. Finally, a high efficiency (>91%, −0.70 V) and long cycling endurance (>40 h) were released for M-TTCOFs toward electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. Furthermore, an FECO over 90% at a wide voltage range (−0.6 to −0.9 V) and almost 100% FECO at −0.8 V were fulfilled when M-TTCOFs were exfoliated into nanosheets at about 5 nm, which was an unprecedented value among COF-based catalysts.

It has been demonstrated that CO2 could be utilized as an energy carrier to store renewable energy by means of Li–CO2 batteries which followed the discharge reaction: 4Li+ + 3CO2 + 4e− → 2Li2CO3 + C (E0 = 2.80 V versus Li/Li+).207 COFs possess regular 1D channels which facilitate mass transport (including CO2 and Li+) when applied as cathode materials for Li–CO2 batteries. Furthermore, through elaborate molecular design and painstaking synthesis processes, ideal COFs with impressive CO2 adsorption ability can be utilized as CO2 collectors during a discharge process, increasing the CO2 concentration, enhancing the battery capacity, and facilitating Li2CO3 decomposition during the charging process. Despite merits of COFs for Li–CO2 batteries, secluded trails of COFs in this field were left.208,209 Meng et al. pioneered a way of utilizing COFs as a cathode catalyst in Li–CO2 batteries (Fig. 22a).208 An imine-linked COF with good CO2 capture performance (>42 cm−3 g−1) was in situ grown on graphene, obtaining graphene@COF composites. Graphene@COF could enrich and confine CO2 in its nanopores which would improve electron and Li+ conduction through shortening the CO2 diffusion pathway and finally, limit the formation of oversized Li2CO3 nanoparticles. After 30 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, the particle size of the discharged product Li2CO3 for graphene@COF was about 500 nm, while the size for pure graphene was over 10000 nm. A smaller discharging product will alleviate the polarization and lower the overpotential. In addition, a graphene@COF cathode could achieve a discharge capacity over 2.78 × 104 mA h g−1 (Fig. 22b) and sustain a low overpotential of 3.5 V at 0.5 A g−1 for 56 cycles. Ru was considered as an effective catalyst for the reduction of CO2 and decomposition of Li2CO3/C in Li-CO2 batteries.210 Loh et al. synthesized a hydrazide-containing COF, and then hybridized it with Ru nanoparticle decorated carbon nanotubes, and applied the obtained composites, COF-Ru@CNT as a cathode material in Li–CO2 batteries (Fig. 22c).209 COF-Ru@CNT delivered a CO2 uptake capacity of 34.2, 23.2, and 13.4 cm−3 g−1 at 248, 273, and 298 K at 1 atm, respectively. In a fuel cell, the ordered 1D channels of the COF skeleton guided CO2 gas and Li+ ion transport to Ru(0) which acted as a catalyst for accelerating the charge/discharge process. The COF-Ru@CNT cathode can achieve an ultrahigh capacity of 27348 mA h g−1 (Fig. 22d) and an ever-reported rating capability among Li–CO2 batteries. Moreover, due to the enhanced kinetics, no obvious charge/discharge voltage decay was delivered after 200 charge/discharge journeys.

Apart from the abovementioned energy conversion processes, COFs can also be utilized in the field of photovoltaics,211,212 photo-dynamic/thermal therapy (PDT/PTT),213,214 microreactors,215 and heterogeneous catalysis216–219etc. Although advances have been made in harnessing COFs for electrocatalysis, research in this field is still in its infancy. Huge development space exists in this field: (1) the relationship between precise molecular design and the desired properties and performance is unclear. (2) Strategies and building blocks are too few to further enhance the electrocatalytic performance. (3) Controlling the spatial distribution of the active sites is ambiguous. (4) More attention should be paid to the mechanism investigation which would provide guidance for searching for better electrocatalysts. It should be pointed out that when applying pristine COFs for electrocatalysis, the COFs may undergo structural changes in specific electrolytes and potential windows. From this point, the true electrochemical active sites may change, and the researchers should be careful of this and until now, there are no works related to this topic.
COF-oriented materials for energy storage
The ability to store energy is increasingly important with modern day's persisting energy technology and demands compared with energy harvesting and conversion. Due to their high π conjugation structures, good porous properties including high surface area and controllable pore size distribution and tunable functionalities, COFs are promising materials for energy storage applications. In the following section, the representative applications of COFs in supercapacitors and metal ion/sulfur batteries will be summarized.
Supercapacitors
According to the charge storage mechanisms, two individual families of supercapacitors (SCs) can be categorized into electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.60,220,221 EDLCs store charge at the electrode and electrolyte interfaces without electrons transferring between these two aspects. Pseudocapacitors store energy through reversible and fast redox reaction or rapid intercalation courses on electrode surface. At present, there are three main kinds of materials for SCs: carbon materials (EDLCs), conducting polymers (pseudocapacitor) and metal oxides/hydroxides (pseudocapacitor). Compared with these electrode materials, COFs deliver advantages when applied for SCs: (1) high surface area and controllable pore structures could provide room for the electrolyte. Semiconducting skeletons are able to conduct electrons. These two features enable COFs for electrochemical double layer energy storage. (2) Redox active constituents could be introduced into the permanent pore structures of the COFs through flexible molecular design and various synthetic strategies. These features endow COFs with pseudocapacitive energy storage ability. It was Dichtel et al. that introduced COFs to SCs application first and led the trend of COFs for SCs since then.137
COFs for pseudocapacitors
The advancements with each passing day of this field are mainly summarized based on the following 4 strategies: (1) introducing redox-active groups into the skeleton of COFs; (2) morphology control; (3) hydrogen bonding and (4) constructing hybrid systems with metals, oxides or CPs. All these strategies aim to settle the capacitance or conductivity issues of 2D COFs.
In 2013, Dichtel et al. synthesized two chemically stable (strong acid electrolyte)-ketoenamine linked 2D COFs, DAB–TFP COF and DAAQ–TFP COF (Fig. 23a).137 Through optimizing the synthetic conditions, these two COFs could achieve surface areas of 2420 and 1800 m2 g−1, respectively. The results showed that DAAQ-TFP COF was endowed with impressive capacitance and cycling endurance, indicating the importance of redox-active sites. Due to the poor electrochemical accessibility of the COF powders, the electrodes presented general capacitance of only 40 F g−1 (Fig. 23b). Tang et al. prepared pyridine containing redox active COFs and applied them for faradaic electrode materials.222 TaPa–Py COF can reserve 92% initial capacitance after 6000 routines. Gu et al. developed highly conductive 2D COFs (Ni-COF) with square Ni coordination structures.223 High conductivity, extended planar structure and quantities of active sites worked cooperatively to endow Ni-COF with high capacitance (1257 F g−1). Moreover, 94% capacitance value was preserved after 10000 routines at 1 A g−1.

To address the capacitance issue, Dichtel et al. grew oriented β-ketoenamine COF thin films on electrodes (Fig. 23c).224 The thin film thickness could be regulated between 60 and 560 nm by changing the initial monomer concentration. When the thickness of thin film was controlled under 200 nm, 80–99% of reactive groups (anthraquinone groups) were electrochemically accessible, forming sharp comparison with the microcrystalline COF powders where only about 3% redox active sites were accessible. Finally, the capacitance of DAAQ-TFP COF was enhanced dramatically from 0.4 to 3 mF cm−2 (Fig. 23d). This work elaborated the importance of morphology control when taking full advantage of 2D COFs for energy storage application. To facilitate the electrical conductivity and energy storage performance of 2D redox active COF films, they further introduced conducting polymers into the pores of DAAQ-TFP COF through electropolymerization.225 A thicker film (about 1 μm) sustaining fast charging rates (1600C), enhanced electrochemical accessibility at high scan rates and better conductivity compared with unmodified one can be obtained. Finally, improved capacitance (197 F g−1), volumetric energy and power density coming up to other porous carbon-based materials can be captured. Kuo et al. synthesized a collection of triphenyltriazine (TPA) based 2D COFs with different planarity, nitrogen content and symmetry.226 Because of the numerous redox active TPA groups and high conjugation of the COFs, TPA–TPA-COF-1 afforded the largest capacitance of 51.3 F g−1. Afterwards, they obtained 2D COFs with different structures under the Ostwald ripening mechanism control.227 The as-prepared carbazole-based COFs had different hollow structures (microspherical or microtubular) through one pot (3+3) like condensation reaction. CV curves displayed the shape of the EDLCs and pseudocapacitance verifying the large surface area and vigorous redox reaction of the COFs in this work. Among them, the Car-TPT COF with microtubular structure output the best capacitance of 17.4 F g−1.
Banerjee et al. firstly introduced and uncovered the role of hydrogen bonding in redox-active COFs for supercapacitor applications.228 The as-prepared TpBD–(OH)2 could give a capacitance of 416 F g−1 which came from the reversible transformation of hydroquinone/benzoquinone (H2Q/Q). Subsequently, they developed an ultrastable COF, TpOMe–DAQ, which could endure 18 M H2SO4, 12 M HCl and 9 M NaOH (Fig. 23e).229 The outstanding stability was from the steric and hydrophobic protection of CN bonds and the interlayer hydrogen bonding. Taking the stability merit of TpOMe–DAQ, the as-prepared supercapacitor could be tested in harsh conditions (2 M H2SO4/PVA gel) and 65% capacity was preserved after 50000 cycles (Fig. 23f). Through a one-pot synthesis method, Gu et al. developed a new benzobisthiazole-linked COF (PG-BBT) with plentiful intramolecular hydrogen bonds which improved electron transfer on the COF skeleton and enhanced electrochemical performance.232
Nickel nanowires with COF nanocoatings were designed and fabricated.233 Due to the favourable conductivity of nickel and redox properties of TpPa-COF, the NiNWs@TpPa-COFs could achieve a capacitance of 426 F g−1. More impressively, when promoting the current density to 50 A g−1, 74% initial capacitance was reserved. Fe3O4, Co3O4 and NiO based COF composites were prepared through a two-step method: mechanical grinding combined with recrystallization.71 Fe3O4/COF-5d delivered the most impressive capacitive performance (112 F g−1) due to the combination of well-defined pore structures, and magnetic and redox-active properties. Electron transporting “highways” were formed in redox active AQ-COF channels through catalyst-free in situ solid state PEDOT polymerization (Fig. 23g).230 The as-obtained composites delivered prominent 1.1 S cm−1 conductivity, a billion-fold enhancement compared with AQ-COF. PEDOT@AQ-COF exhibited admirable capacitance (1663 F g−1, 1 A g−1, Fig. 23h), rate capability (998 F g−1 at 500 A g−1), and long cycle durability (10000 cycles, Fig. 23i). The composite, COFBTA–DPPD–rGO, was obtained via pyridine containing COF in situ growth on rGO.234 Redox processes from pyridine units and conductivity improvement from rGO together endowed COFBTA–DPPD–rGO with a capacitance of 239.1 F g−1. Zhang et al. harnessed Knoevenagel condensation to prepare CC linked conjugated COFs and obtained the COF/CNT hybrid film.235 When introduced as an electrode material for a microsupercapacitor (MSCs), the highest areal capacitance (15.2 mF cm−2) and energy density (7.3 mW h cm−3) could be achieved among the reported MSCs.
A post-modification strategy was widely adopted to enlarge the application of polymers with target functionality. Jiang et al. converted the conventional COFs into a redox-active one by decorating the channels of COFs with TEMPO radicals (Fig. 23j).231 The received [TEMPO]100%–NiP-COF could display a capacitance of 167 F g−1 (Fig. 23k). Such a strategy made it possible to transform conventional COFs into energy storage materials. However, the employment of this method was rarely reported because of the poor solubility of COFs.
COFs for EDLCs
COFs can be utilized for SCs based on the following two merits: (1) permanent pore structures which can store the electrolyte; (2) large conjugation of the frameworks facilitating electron transportation. Low conductivity and capacitance issues have to be solved when introducing pristine COFs for EDLCs, while less work referred to this topic.236,237 In this section, we will mainly put emphasis on strategies improving the conductivity of COFs centering on COF-derived carbon, COF hybrids with a conductive template, and then pristine COF.
By introducing the molten-salt (MS) route, Xu et al. acquired B-doped carbons via carbonizing COF-5 with ZnCl2 at different temperatures (Fig. 24a).238 During pyrolysis, ZnCl2 (1) prevented the pore collapse of the precursors and (2) acted as a porogen inducing hierarchical pores. The obtained BC-MS-700-14 showed a capacitance of 160 and 140 F g−1 at 10 (Fig. 24b) and 50 mV s−1, respectively. Developed from a new C3-symmetric aldehyde, the BTT COFs were processed under 700 °C with ZnCl2 as a salt template.239 The interaction between the electrolyte and COF-700s corresponded to their sp2 carbon content, verifying the relationship between their structures and properties. The structural features of the COFs were inevitably destroyed after the pyrolysis procedures. To solve this issue, Jiang et al. utilized PPZS spheres as a template, and after calcination, a series of porous carbons (TAPT–DHTA-COFx@PPZSy) were obtained with high conductivity, microporosity and heteroatom content.240 TAPT–DHTA-COF0.1@PPZS900 output a capacitance of 411 F g−1, immensely superior to other COF-based materials at that time. ACOF-1, with an azine linkage, was carbonized to prepare nitrogen doped carbon materials (carbonized ACOF-1).241 The released nitrogen during carbonization facilitated micropore formation. Nitrogen doping, micropores and high surface area promoted the capacitance where a capacitance of 234 F g−1 was realized in ACOF-1. Coronado et al. found that COFs could adsorb metal ions which facilitated the formation of corrugated graphene upon pyrolysis without any templates.242 The graphene materials coming from ferric iron derivate ((N)G2) exhibited excellent capacitive performance (460 F g−1).

Growing COFs on conductive substrates including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and conductive polymers (CPs) was considered to be another efficient way to enhance the conductivity of COFs.224,243 Wang et al. grew highly ordered 2D COFs on the surface of amino-modified CNTs and the obtained NH2-f-MWCNT@COFTTA-DHTA delivered a capacitance of 127.5 F g−1 (Fig. 24c and d).244 This fantastic performance was from the high crystallinity, chemical stability and conductivity enhancement brought by CNTs. TpPa-COF was in situ packed onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).245 The interface of the formed composite could be tuned efficiently at the molecular level, so the hybrid combined the merits of redox properties of COFs and the conductivity of SWCNTs, and a capacitance of 153 F g−1 was realized. Talyzin et al. constructed 2D materials by introducing graphene oxide (GO) to expand the nucleation sites and control the morphology during COF synthesis, where COF-1 nanosheets grew perpendicular to the GO surface.246 The carbonaceous v-CNS-RGO output impressive electrochemical performance as its initial morphology possessed good conductivity, B-doping and a specific geometry.
Compared with pristine COFs applied for pseudocapacitors, pristine COFs applied for EDLCs are still in their infancy because of the conductivity issue and lack of active sites. Mesoporous (3.4 nm) 2D porphyrin-based electroactive COFs with an A–A stacking mode, moderate surface area and high stability were developed and chemically exploited into a thin-layer structure (average thickness: 22 nm) for EDLC applications (Fig. 24e).247 The obtained e-COF can achieve an areal capacitance of 5.46 mF cm−2 and after 10000 cycles, almost 100% capacitance was retained. A τ0 value (minimum time required to discharge more than 50% energy) of about 121 ms was determined, further emphasizing the high charge/discharge rate and capacitive response of e-COF. Most importantly, e-COF delivered almost DL storage behaviour at 30000 mV s−1. In another work, Kuo et al. prepared microtubular structured benzobisoxazole (TPT-DAHQ COF) linked COF with triazine moieties and sponge-like shells through the template free (3+2) condensation reaction.248 The prepared COFs exhibited high surface area, crystallinity, thermal stability and large pore size. TPT–DAHQ COF delivered decent capacity (256 F g−1), cycling stability (98% retention after 1850 routines) and satisfactory energy density (43 W h kg−1). The presence of the electron-rich N and O atoms on the framework could invigorate faradaic storage via redox reaction. Hence, the superior capacitance can be attributed to the combination of the double-layer and the pseudocapacitive charge storage process.
COFs present great potential for SCs, whose porous properties and stability can be guaranteed to endow COFs with relatively high capacitance. Although progress has been made, it should be pointed out the capacitance of the COFs is relatively low, which can be attributed to the worse conductivity and the slow charge transfer rate resulting from the full organic structure of COFs. Furthermore, at present, most electrode materials are prepared from COF powders, which limits their potential elaboration in SCs fields (Table 2).

Metal-ion batteries
Metal ion batteries (MIBs) have been developed over the last two decades for improving the environment, cost efficiency in the field of smart electronics and large-scale energy storage applications. The current energy storage device market is undoubtedly occupied by lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high energy density, large cycling stability and promising efficiency. Nevertheless, LIBs suffer from cost and safety issues due to the resources distribution, flammable organic electrolyte and reactive electrode surface toward electrolytes.249,250 The capacity of the commercialized inorganic electrode materials is dominated by the oxidation-state variation of the transition metal center and charge balance is achieved when the counterions are inserted. To ensure the crystal lattice and structure stability of the electrode materials, there are requirements regarding the radius of the counterions, which would limit the energy density improvement. The abovementioned factors also weaken the versatility of the electrode materials, that is, one successful LIB electrode material is not suitable for other metal ion batteries. Furthermore, in terms of economy and environmental aspects, the transition metal based electrode materials are not suitable for large-scale energy storage.251 Due to these concerns, organic compounds could be an alternative of commercialized transition metal based electrodes for battery technology because of their inherent properties of light weight, flexibility, large availability, transparency and sustainability.252,253 COFs have drawn attractive attention in the field of MIBs because of the π-conjugated skeleton for fast charge transportation.36 The details about COF-based materials for MIBs will be discussed in the sections below.
Lithium ion batteries
The energy storage performances of LIBs are controlled cooperatively by the electrode, electrolyte and separator. COF-based materials applied for electrode materials, electrode protection, and separators will be discussed in detail in the following section.
Compared with other materials, the conjugated structures of COFs facilitated the conductivity improvement, which made them better candidates for LIBs. In 2016, Zhao et al. prepared two conjugated COFs as anode materials for LIBs (Fig. 25a).254 Because of their uniform porosity, outstanding stability and conjugated structures, high capacity and cycle stability were realized in these two COFs. Furthermore, two conjugated COFs (PA-COF and TB-COF) with imine linkage were developed via a mechanochemical strategy. Due to their high stability and capacity, they exhibited a reversible discharge capacity of 401.3 and 379.1 mA h g−1, respectively.255

Integrating redox-active sites within the skeletons of COFs can further expand their application in LIBs. Jiang et al. constructed COFs with redox-active bicarbazole groups arranged along the pore channels as anode materials.256 Benefiting from the large pores and easy accessibility of redox active sites, Cz-COF-1 could achieve a 628 mA h g−1 capacity. In another case, Tp-Azo-COF, with dual redox active sites including CO and CN groups was developed where the electrochemical activity and capacity were improved (Fig. 25b).257 The conductivity was enhanced and the solubility in electrolyte was reduced, coming from the strong π–π interactions. Due to these merits, the Tp-Azo-COF anode achieved a capacity of 305.97 mA h g−1 and almost 100% capacity was retained after 3000 routines (Fig. 25c).
Because of the strong π–π interactions, COFs generally present as closely packed structures, and the active sites are imbedded between layers, causing inaccessibility and limiting redox active site utilization. To solve this issue, one way is to control the growth of COFs. Wang et al. synthesized a few layered COFs resulting from CNT trapping (Fig. 25d).258 COF@CNTs displayed outstanding electrochemical performance (1536 mA h g−1; 500 cycles). Based on experimental and theoretical results, Li+ storage in COF@CNTs was via a 14-electron redox chemistry. From another point, a mechanical or chemical exfoliation strategy could improve the efficiency of active sites through delaminating the stacked structures of COFs. Vaidhyanathan et al. developed a self-exfoliated COF containing triazole and phloroglucinol units, where both could bind Li+ strongly, as an anode material for LIBs (Fig. 25e).259 The shortened Li+ diffusion pathway provided by the nanosheets facilitated the ultrafast kinetics for Li+ insertion which endowed IISERP-CON1 with a capacity of 720 mA h g−1 (Fig. 25f). Furthermore, DFT calculation results showed that there was no strong Li-skeleton bonding at an optimized structure, which enabled unhindered insertion/desertion processes, realizing cycling stability. Chemical stripping is another route for the exfoliation of COFs. Wang et al. exfoliated bulk 2D COFs, 2D TFPB-COF into few-layered E-TFPB-COF and E-TFPB-COF/MnO2 nanosheets through a chemical method (Fig. 25g).260 Compared with bulk 2D TFPB-COF, E-TFPB-COF and E-TFPB-COF/MnO2 exposed more redox-active sites and improved ion/electron transfer kinetics, hence, higher capacity was achieved in E-TFPB-COF and E-TFPB-COF/MnO2. In another case, maleic anhydride was introduced as a COF chemical exfoliation agent.261 The capacity enhancement was not only from the exfoliation but also from the newly generated Li-interactive carbonyl groups during an exfoliation process.
When introducing COF-based materials as cathode materials, similar strategies used in anode materials like utilizing pristine COFs with a nanoporous and robust framework,262 introducing redox-active sites,263–266 exfoliation of bulk COFs into nanosheets,267 growing COFs on a conductive substrate,268–270 and electrode protection271 were adopted to improve their electrochemical performance.
In addition to acting as electrode materials, COF-based materials can also serve as solid–electrolyte-interphase (SEI) or a separator for LIBs. Si is a normal anode material for LIBs, but cracking and rupture issues are often met when the Si nanoparticle sizes are reduced to the nanoscale. Lou et al. coated the Li+ conducting COF onto the surface of Si nanoparticles acting as an artificial SEI for the Si anode (Fig. 26a).272 During the electrochemical process, COF SEI can (1) eliminate the electrolyte decomposition, improving the CE and cyclic performance; (2) accelerate the Li+ transfer toward the Si anode. Finally, Si@COF can achieve a high capacity of 1864 mA h g−1, and more than 60% value was reserved after 1000 endurances (Fig. 26b). When introducing transition metal oxide as cathode materials, common separators like PP or PE cannot prevent the transition metal ions (TMIs) moving to the anode, which would deposit on the anode surface, increasing the internal resistance and decomposing the electrolyte.273 Li et al. coated COF on PS acting as a separator (PS@COF) which can regulate the ionic transportation.274 Theoretical calculations revealed this regulation: negatively charged –OCH3 groups in COF could transport the Li+, and the CN linkage with lone pair could chelate TMIs (Fig. 26c). Compared with PS, enhanced Li+ transference number and isolated TMIs from the anode were demonstrated using PS@COF separator. Finally, the rating and cycling performance of LIBs were significantly enhanced (Fig. 26d and e).

Sodium ion batteries
As promising alternatives to LIBs, SIBs suffer from huge volume expansion during Na+ insertion, leading to electric contact loss and fast capacity decline. Organic materials generally possess soft and flexible structures which would buffer the volume change during Na+ insertion. COFs prepared with Schiff base chemistry could form CN bonds, which play crucial roles during electrochemical processes. From this point, a triazine-based COF (TFPB–TAPT) was developed as an anode material for SIBs (Fig. 27a).275 TFPB–TAPT COF could achieve an initial capacity of 246 mA h g−1 (Fig. 27b). Mechanistically, the sodium storage was confirmed through the disorder of the COF structure. When introducing organic compounds as electrode materials, it is inevitable to form intermediates, which delivered high reactivity and kinetics, beneficial for capacity enhancement.276 From another point, the increasing reactivity of intermediates is detrimental to the cycling stability. Hence, balancing the activity and stability of the radical intermediates to realize optimal performance is crucially important. Lu et al. prepared a β-ketoenamine linked DAAQ-COF as an anode material for SIBs and demonstrated that the C–O and α-C radicals delivered profound effects during the sodiation/desodiation process (Fig. 27c).277 Interestingly, by controlling the COF nanosheet thickness, the reactivity and stability of the intermediates could be tuned, where reduced thickness facilitated stabilization of the radical intermediates without capacity loss. Finally, the 4–12 nm sample showed a capacity of 420 mA h g−1, superior to that of the 100–250 nm (154 mA h g−1), 100–180 nm (208 mA h g−1), and 50–85 nm (310 mA h g−1) samples (Fig. 27d). In another case, a nitrogen-rich COF with abundant carbonyl groups, TQBQ-COF, was developed as a cathode material for SIBs (Fig. 27e).278 TQBQ-COF shared the merits of: (1) abundant CN and CO groups combining Na+; (2) mesopores accommodating Na+, preventing volume expansion; (3) linked via active pyrazine components. Finally, this insoluble electrode exhibited high specific capacity (452 mA h g−1, Fig. 27f), durable performance (96% reserved after 1000 cycles) and rating performance.

Introducing COFs as precursors, nitrogen doped carbons (NPCs) were prepared as anode materials for SIBs. By carbonizing TPPA-COFs at 600 °C, the as-obtained NPC-2 showed a capacity of 237.7 mA h g−1 and excellent cycling performance (5000 cycles).279 In another case, interconnected, highly porous, nitrogen doped carbon materials were prepared via pyrolysis of COFs at different temperatures.280 The COF(800 °C) could reach a 303 mA h g−1 capacity and durable stability due to nitrogen improving the conductivity and wettability of the material.
Potassium ion batteries
Due to their abundant resources, low electrolyte cost, and better kinetics from the weaker Lewis acidity, potassium ion batteries (PIBs) have been considered another alternative toward LIBs.282 From another aspect, dendrites are easier to form due to the high activity of K, hence, it is urgent to develop anode materials for PIBs. Introducing organic materials as an electrode is a good option to overcome the challenges that inorganic materials face in accommodating oversized K+.36 COFs present designable and robust frameworks, high stability and regular pore channels suitable for electrolyte ion transport, making them promising candidates toward energy storage. In addition, the powerful π-K+ interaction endows COFs with magnificent possibilities for potassium storage.283 Consequently, Wang et al. prepared COF-10@CNT as an anode material for PIBs via in situ growing COF-10 with boronic ester linkage on CNTs (Fig. 27g).281 The layered structure of this composite exposed more active sites and provided fast kinetics. After 500 cycles, COF-10@CNT could still maintain a reversible capacity of 288 A h g−1. Mechanism investigation indicated that the π-K+ interaction mainly contributed to this performance. To improve the conductivity and optimize the performance, Lu et al. fabricated nitrogen doped carbon (NPC) from COF-JLU2 precursor via a simple pyrolysis process for PIBs.284 Because of the nitrogen doping, the conductivity and ion transport of the as-prepared NPC were enhanced, which brought high capacity and excellent cycling performance.
Other metal ion batteries
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) are superior to monovalent MIBs such as LIBs, SIBs, PIBs, etc. in terms of cost, safety, and reliability.285,286 Until now, limited organic molecules have been developed for ZIBs which suffer from low stability and leaching issues during practical applications.287,288 COFs possess tuneable structures, good porosity and high stability, making them suitable for ZIBs. Banerjee et al. demonstrated a β-ketoenamine linked COF (HqTp) via a mechanochemical strategy for aqueous ZIBs.289 This COF was endowed with abundant nucleophilic sites which can interact with Zn2+ during an electrochemical process. Furthermore, the interlayer interaction between Zn2+ and CO and N–H moieties from the neighbouring layers further contributed to the capacity enhancement. Combined with porous properties, when introducing HqTp as a cathode material, a discharge capacity of 276.0 mA h g−1 was achieved.
Metal sulfur batteries
Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) have received widespread concern due to their high theoretical capacity and energy density. With the usage of a sulfur cathode instead of conventional insertion cathode materials, LSBs demonstrate merits including environmental, economic and practical aspects. Despite the promising aspects, the practical application of LSBs is hampered by: (1) the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and the corresponding discharge products; (2) volume changes during the charge/discharge process; and (3) the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides (PSs). Compared with general carbon materials which trap polysulfides merely via physical confinement, COFs show superiorities in MSBs including: (1) The permanent pore structures could offer a pathway for ion (lithium, sodium, potassium, etc.) transport. (2) The skeleton of the COFs could react with ions via reversible ionization/deionization processes. (3) Through flexible molecular design, the reactive sites, which could chemically anchor sulfur, could be introduced into the skeleton. 2D COFs have delivered promising aspects in LSBs acting as a sulfur host material, separator, and anode stabilization material.
Practice utilizing COFs for LSBs began with introducing CTF-1 as a sulfur host material (34 wt%) in 2014 (Fig. 28a).290 The obtained CTF-1/S@155 °C can deliver a discharge capacity of 1197 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and after 50 routines, the capacity was still maintained at 762 mA h g−1 (Fig. 28b). CTF-1/S@155 °C also displayed good rating behaviour and high coulombic efficiency, indicating that the shuttle effects were suppressed effectively. To improve the sulfur loading and the performance of LSBs, they further developed a porphyrin based COF, Por-COF.291 Due to its favourable porous properties, a sulfur loading of 55 wt% was achieved. At 0.5C, Por-COF/S delivered a capacity of 929 mA h g−1 and in the following 200 routines, an average 0.16% degradation per cycle was captured. Then, they developed Py-COF with higher sulfur loading (70 wt%) rooting from the surface area (2093 m2 g−1).292 Py-COF/S was endowed with good rating performance and long cycling stability. After 550 cycles at 5C, a 482.1 mA h g−1 capacity was held accompanied by a capacity decay of 0.048% per cycle. Cai et al. explored the influence of conductive additives on the performance of LSBs.293 The performance of TAPB–PDA-COF/S@A-B and TAPB–PDA-COF/S@S-P was 991 and 1357 mAh g-1, respectively, where acetylene black (A-B) and super-P (S-P) were adopted as conductive additives. The performance discrimination was from the differences in conductivity. TpPa-COF was pyrolyzed to prepare nitrogen doped carbon for LSB.294 The derived carbon material, N-GC, could achieve a 67.5 wt% sulfur loading and a discharge capacity of 1598 mA h g−1 at 0.03C.

Although imine linked COFs could promote even distribution of sulfur, they trapped PSs indirectly through the N–Li+ interaction and this is inferior to the direct trapping one. COFs with a boroxine linkage aroused LSB application concern as the B atoms with positive polarization and O atoms with negative charge could adsorb Sx2− and Li+ simultaneously.294,295 COF-1/S was obtained after COF-1 vulcanization and due to the effects of B and O, PS solution was inhabited during the discharging process.295 COF-1/S could generate an initial capacity of 1628 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and after 100 endurances, 929 mA h g−1 was kept. With triazine and boroxine linkages, TB-COF could adsorb Li+ through lithiophilic interaction of triazine rings and PSs through boroxine linkages, which will further alleviate the shuttling effects of PSs and improve the cycling performance (Fig. 28c).296 At 1C, TB-COF/S can deliver the highest capacity of 808 mA h g−1 and 663 mA h g−1 was retained after 800 routines, equivalent to an average decay of 0.023% every cycle (Fig. 28d). COF-5 was in situ grown on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and a B and O codoped carbon carbonaceous BOC@CNT was received after calcination.297 Benefitting from the PS trapping ability and enhanced conductivity, BOC@CNT/S could achieve an initial capacity of 1434 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. After cycling for 500 routines (1C), 794 mA h g−1 was reserved, 0.07% capacity decay per cycle.
Physical or electronic interactions confining sulfur and polysulfides are not valid in preventing the shuttle effect and eventually obtain unsatisfactory LSB energy storage performance. Zhang et al. obtained highly fluoro-substituted COF and chemically confined PS shuttle effects via C–S bonding (Fig. 28e).298 The as-obtained COF-F–S could achieve a 60 wt% sulfur loading and an initial discharge capacity of 1120 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. After 1000 routines at 1C, 257 mA h g−1 was reserved where 0.045% capacity degradation per cycle was achieved. Afterwards, Han et al. prepared COF-F-SeS2 as a cathode material for LSBs through a similar strategy.299 Chemical/physical confinements of polysulfides/polyselenides combined with conductivity enhancement of the cathode materials boosted the performance of LSBs. COF-F-SeS2 can achieve a primary capacity of 1633 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and after 200 cycles (1C), 520 mA h g−1 was retained. Recently, Jiang et al. elaborated that the imine linkage in COFs could launch the sulfur polymerization, forming PS chains and integrate them into the pore channels of 2D COF through chemical bonding (Fig. 28f).300 PS chains chemically bonded on the walls could restrain the shuttle effect, accelerate the ion transportation and enhance charge conduction and redox kinetics. Finally, polysulfide@TFPPy–ETTA-COF could yield an increased capacity of 1069 mA h g−1 (Fig. 28g), and almost unchanged capacity between the 60th and 130th cycle at 0.1C indicating good cycling performance. Segura et al. developed a porphyrin-based imine linked 2D COF, which was endowed with reactive allyl moieties in the skeleton.301 During the subsequent vulcanization process, sulfur was physically confined by the porous structure and chemically bonded by the allyl moieties. The fatal shuttling effects of polysulfide were alleviated by these two interactions and the cycling performance of the final LSB was improved.
In addition to physical or chemical trapping of the PSs to avoid their shuttle effects, accelerating the dissociation of PSs is also of crucial importance to achieve high LSB performance. Zang et al. developed a cationic COF (EB-COF-PS) after replacing the Br− with PSs in the initial COF (EB-COF-Br).302 When harnessing EB-COF-PS as a cathode material, S@EB-COF-PS can achieve a capacity of 1136 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. Compared with electrically neutral COFs, this cationic COF also delivered superior cycling stability even at high current density (468 mA h g−1 retention after 300 routines at 4C). Mechanism investigations revealed (1) chemical confinement of PSs within micropores suppressing their dissolution and (2) cationic sites accepting electrons from the anode during the discharge process facilitating the disintegration of the PSs working together to improve the LSB performance. DFT calculations were conducted to explore the adsorption and catalysis performance toward PSs when utilizing metal phthalocyanine COFs (MPc-COFs, M = Ti, V, Mn, Cu, and Zn) as a cathode303 The results showed that MnPc-COFs possesses high conductivity, sulfur fixation ability and a rational energy barrier in catalyzing transforming PSs, which made it an ideal candidate for LSBs.
Blocking the PS shuttle effects across the separator and reusing PSs is another effective way to enhance LSB performance. Microporous COF-1 was in situ grown on mesoporous CNTs forming a COF net on the CNT net hybrid architecture and utilized as an interlayer for LSBs (Fig. 29a).304 The micropore (0.7 nm) and the B, O atoms along the channel structures displayed affinity for selectively binding Li2Sx without impairing their charge carrier conductivity. The COF-1 NN interlayer could provide an eminent durable performance enhancement where 84% capacity was sustained after 300 cycles at 2C, while only 16% capacity was retained for the one without interlayer (Fig. 29b). COF-1, after ultrasonic dispersion, was deposited on the surface of graphene.305 Due to the π–π interaction, most 2D COF-1 nanosheets were parallel to the rGO plane, forming double-layer structure. When introduced as a separator, the COF–rGO double-layer membrane acted as an ionic sieve and suppressed the shuttle effect, boosting the long-term cycling stability. The shuttle effect was effectively suppressed by coating DMTA-COF on the surface of a ceramic separator, and the assembled LSB delivered superior electrochemical performance compared to the pristine ceramic and super-P coated one.306 The LSB using redox-active TP-BPY-COF modified separator can realize a capacity of 977 mA h g−1 at 0.2C after 100 routines, 5.2 times higher than that with pure Celgard 3501 as the separator.307 Redox active sites along the channels enhancing adsorption of PSs and catalyzing the charge/discharge process were the main reason for this superior performance. Although the deposited layer on the separator could suppress the shuttling of the PSs, the Li+ transport was sacrificed to some extent. Recently, Jiang et al. constructed lithiated 2D covalent organic nanosheets (Li-CONs) which could suppress the shuttling of PSs and facilitate the transport of Li+.308 The corresponding LSB using Li-CON@GN/Celgard as a separator displayed a preliminary capacity of 982 mA h g−1 at 1C, and only 0.057% decline per cycle could be seen in the following 600 cycles.

To solve the internal short circuit issues in LSBs, a COF film (thickness: 10 nm) was coated on the surface of the Li anode as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) (Fig. 29c).309 Mechanical experiment showed that the COF film was endowed with high Young's modulus (6.8 GPa) which could resist the growth of Li dendrites and further enhance the safety and stability of the Li anode. A symmetrical cell assembled from COF-Li could cycle stably over 400 h. The assembled COF-Li/S battery could steadily run for over 300 cycles without a short-circuiting phenomenon (Fig. 29d).
From the abovementioned examples, we can conclude that when utilizing COFs for metal ion/sulfur batteries, COFs usually bear low conductivity, less and insufficient utilization of the redox active sites, low yield and high cost issues. Furthermore, the stability should also be taken into account when long-term cycling performance is essential (Table 3).

Mass transfer
Proton conduction
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the proton conduction mechanisms can be principally separated into the Grotthuss one and the vehicular one.310 In the Grotthuss mechanism, also known as a proton-hopping mechanism, the hydrogen bonding networks build up the path for proton conduction. The vehicular mechanism transports protons through the diffusion of the proton carriers, such as H3O+, NH4+etc. where protons bonded to H2O, NH3etc. carriers. The activation energy (Ea) calculated from the ac impedance data is often adopted to distinguish these two proton conduction mechanisms. Lower Ea value (<0.4 eV) is needed for the Grotthuss mechanism due to the lower cleavage energy of the hydrogen bonding while higher Ea value (>0.4 eV) is essential for transporting larger ionic species in the vehicular mechanism. Proton conducting membranes play crucial roles in boosting the efficiency of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), one of the bright energy devices, and hence significant research in this field has been carried out. Nafion based proton conduction membranes display high proton conductivity (about 0.1 S cm−1) under moderate temperature (60–80 °C) and elevated humidity (98% RH), but their cost and low efficiency under increased fuel working temperature (120 °C) issues have urged researchers to search for substitute materials. COFs show peculiarity as proton conduction candidates due to: (1) the ordered channels can accommodate or transfer guest molecules or ions; (2) through flexible molecular design, COFs with intrinsic proton conductivity can be realized, such as COFs with conductive functionalities or ionic COFs; and (3) furthermore, COFs are connected by chemical bonding which endows COFs with high chemical and thermal stability.
Inorganic/organic acids and salts have been impregnated into the ordered channel structures of COFs as proton carriers to realize proton conduction in insulating COFs. Banerjee et al. presented the first report introducing COFs as proton conduction materials (Fig. 30a).311 The COF with azo and stilbene functionality (Tp-Azo and Tp-Stb) with keto-enamine form delivered high chemical and thermal stability. Protonated Tp-Azo was obtained after H3PO4 impregnation, where azo groups acted as anchoring sites and H2PO42− ions were stabilized by hydrogen bonding. PA@Tp-Azo exhibited proton conductivity of 6.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 with a 0.11 eV activation energy (Ea), while the less crystalline and porous Tp-Stb displayed poor proton conductivity at 2.3 × 10−5 S cm−1 (Fig. 30b). They further developed a COF with bipyridine functionality through a mechanochemical strategy.312 After loading H3PO4, PA@TpBpy-MC was introduced as a membrane electrode for PEM, PA@TpBpy-MC could interfere the fuel crossover and establish 0.93 V open circuit voltage (OCV, 50 °C) with a 1.4 × 10−3 S cm−2 proton conductivity. Very recently, Jiang et al. confined H3PO4 in a dually stable, CN linked COF (TPB–DMeTP-COF) which was synthesized through a topology guided synthetic strategy.313 The pore structure of TPB–DMeTP-COF was stabilized by the linker induced hyperconjugation and inductive effects. In addition, through the hydrogen-bonding interactions between H3PO4 networks and nitrogen atoms on the pore walls, an anhydrous 1.91 × 10−1 S cm−1 conductivity was achieved in H3PO4@TPB-DMeTP-COF. With a solid skeleton, this COF displayed high organic proton carrier loading capacity within its mesopores and thus the resulting improved proton conductivity.314 After loading 180 wt% triazole (trz) and 155 wt% imidazole (im), anhydrous conductivities of 1.1 and 4.37 × 10−3 S cm−1 were arrived at, respectively. These values were three times higher than that of its amorphous analogue im@TPBTP-COF, which elucidated the importance of crystallinity. Wang et al. Verified that the proton conductivity of COFs was enhanced as the imine bond hydrogen donation ability increased.315 Banerjee et al. further developed a range of flexible COF membranes (COFMs) with the mediation of p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA·H2O) for proton conduction.316 PTSA·H2O provided two advantages: (1) acting as a co-reagent, improving the porosity and crystallinity of the resulting COFMs; and (2) the entrapped PTSA·H2O acting as a proton carrier endowed COFMs with conductivity. PTSA@TpAzo showed the impressive conduction of 7.8 × 10−2 S cm−1 (Fig. 30c and d).

Synthesis situations and guesting molecules have crucial impacts on the conductivity and processability when utilizing COFs toward fuel cells. Zamora et al. synthesized two COFs with m-cresol or CH3COOH as solvents, RT-COF-1 or RTCOF-1Ac/RT-COF-1AcB, where the guest molecules were H2O and CH3COOH, respectively.317 Electrochemical results indicated that the conjunction of H2O and guest ions pairs affected the proton conduction pathways significantly. LiCl@RT-COF-1, with LiCl as a guest molecule showed the highest hydrophilicity concluded from H2O adsorption experiments, and displayed superior ionic conductivity to RT-COF-1 with other guest molecules, reaching 6.45 × 10−3 S cm−1. Furthermore, with CH3COOH as guest molecules, RT-COF-1AcB could be slickly processed into films achieving optimal balance between mechanical properties and ion conductivity under operating conditions. Finally, satisfactory power density (12.95 mW cm−2) and current density (53.1 mA cm−2) were achieved when introducing RT-COF-1AcB film as an ion exchange membrane.
In the abovementioned illustrations, the conductivity of COFs was actually from the supported proton carriers where practical application was restricted by the leakage issues under high humidity and temperature working conditions. One alternative strategy is to construct COFs with intrinsic proton conductivity. Two sulfonated COFs with intrinsic proton conductivity where pore channels were embellished with hanging sulfonic acid groups were synthesized through a mechano-assisted strategy (Fig. 30e).69 NUS-10(R) delivered a conductivity of 3.96 × 10−2 S cm−1. When blended with PVDF, the as-fabricated membrane exhibited favourable conductivity (1.58 × 10−2 S cm−1, Fig. 30f) with an Ea of 0.21 eV. At the same time, Banerjee et al. impregnated phytic acid in sulfonic acid functionalized COF (TpPa-SO3H).318 By decorating the COF backbone with sulfonic acid and immobilizing guest molecules with low pKa value, intrinsic and extrinsic proton conduction in one COF was achieved, even at high temperature and under anhydrous conditions. TpPa–SO3H can deliver the maximum conductivity of 1.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 120 °C where the sulfonic acid units and the polar groups (SO, NH, and CO) acted as proton source and transporters, respectively. This is the first demonstration of combining intrinsic and extrinsic proton conductivity in COFs. Following this concept, Zhang et al. prepared a series of highly hydrophilic and stable COFs (12 M NaOH, HCl, and boiling water) through a stepwise synthesis for proton conduction applications.319 The integrated –OH groups in the benzene ring allowing for internal proton conduction and azo functionalities binding external proton conductors together facilitated the proton conduction in NKCOFs. TFP–BTDA-COF, with triazole linkage, was developed, where the proton conduction was along the skeleton.320 Due to the π–π stacking, the N–H in triazole arranged periodically and regularly in the layers of TFP–BTDA-COF, forming an ordered array. Via the intermediary of H2O, protons could transfer along the pore channel, reaching 1.4 × 10−3 S cm−1.
To reduce synthetic difficulties, Mirica et al. set up a collection of COFs with aza-fused π-conjugated structures for facile proton conductivity.321 The phenanthroline groups within structures promoted the H2O adsorption and thus brought in impressive proton conductivity. At 332 K under 98% RH, aza-COF-1 displayed a 1.51 × 10−5 S cm−1 conductivity, which verified the importance of hydration under high humidity for nonintrinsically proton conductive materials. To solve the uneven distribution and leaking issues met in doping and postfunctionallized COFs, Babu et al. prepared a crystalline 2D-polymer, BIP, with benzimidazole linkage (Fig. 30g).322 In BIP, pyrene and benzimidazole worked in concert facilitating the transfer of protons where a conductivity of 3.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 was achieved at 95 °C under 95% RH.
In addition to constructing COFs with intrinsic proton conductivity, constructing ionic COFs anchoring guest ligands to control the ion–dipole effects toward polar water molecules is believed to be an effective way to promote proton transfer by expediting the hydrogen-bond network within COFs.323 Zhu et al. developed a thermally and chemically stable cationic COF via condensation between cationic ethidium bromide (EB) and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (TFP) (Fig. 30h).324 By subsequent ion exchange, a set of COFs (EB-COF:X, X = F, Cl, Br, and I) with charge were fabricated. When decorating the cationic COFs with polyoxometalate anions, the EB-COF:PW12 was transformed into a superior proton conductor, reaching 3.32 × 10−3 S cm−1. This benign conductivity was from the H2O cluster formation connected by the hydrogen bonding networks. To further strengthen the hydrogen-bond networks, Chen et al. established a collection of ionic COFs with gel guest assistance, showing excellent proton conductivity.325 Decorating the COFs with Li+ and Na+ generated strong electric fields and thus brought in abundant hydrogen-bond networks of H2O, resulting in great proton conduction improvement. Furthermore, pyrrole/PA guests were innovated into the ionic COFs, forming membranes through an in situ gelation process which further enhanced the conductivity.
Ion conduction
Developing solid state electrolytes (SSEs) can solve the issues met in LIBs including narrow voltage windows, flammability, low energy density and charge rate. Because of their high electron transference number, wide electrochemical window and good conductivity, ceramic type metal oxides/sulfides are considered as the most promising SSEs, but instability, incompatibility with anode metals and brittleness issues firmly restrict their practical applications. To solve these disadvantages, solid polymer electrolytes are developed like the poly-(ethylene oxide) (PEO), while they suffer from crystallization and inferior ion transference number issues.326 Easy functionalization, tailorable 1D channels and stability against temperature-dependent phase change have engendered COFs as auspicious participants for solid-state electrolytes.326 Nevertheless, due to their poor intrinsic conductivity, post-modification or new molecular designing concepts are indispensable for improving the Li ion conductivity of COFs.
To enhance the conductivity of COFs, researchers incorporated organic solvents into COFs. Zhang et al. synthesized two ionic COFs with spiroborate linkage via condensation of diol and trimethyl borate in the presence of base (Fig. 31a).327 The counter cations within COFs could be changed from NH4+ to Li+ depending on the base used. When introducing organic solvent propylene carbonate (PC) into the as-fabricated ICOF-2:PVDF membrane, a conductivity of 3.05 × 10−5 S cm−1 was achieved (Fig. 31b) with a 0.24 eV Ea and a Li+ transfer number value of 0.8 ± 0.02. They further developed a series of single-ion conducting imidazolate-containing ionic COFs.328 After being lithiated by n-butyllithium and immersed in PC, Li+ conductivity enhancement was attained compared with the as-prepared COFs without PC at 25 °C with an Ea of 0.1 eV. Further research revealing a high transference number (0.91) and wide electrochemical window (4.5 V) can be achieved.

Impregnating COFs with Li salts is another effective way of raising Li+ conductivity. Uribe-Romo et al. demonstrated that a mechanical shaping process could affect the crystallographic alignment of COFs.329 After infiltrating 3.77 mol% LiClO4 into COF-5, a conductivity of 2.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 was achieved with an ultralow Ea of 37 ± 4 meV. Simply incorporating Li salts into COFs tends to confer Li salts as closely associated ion pairs, thus leading to sluggish ionic conduction dynamics. Chen et al. separated the ion pairs in ionic COFs through dielectric screening (Fig. 31c).330 Through an anion exchange strategy, the Cl− in ionic covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) was replaced by TFSI−, forming CON-TFSI. Li-CON-TFSI could achieve a binary-ion conductivity of 5.74 × 10−5 and 2.09 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 and 70 °C, respectively (Fig. 31d). Following the ion-exchange strategy, Han et al. prepared Im-COF-TFSI by replacing counter Br− with TFSI−, and the obtained composites displayed a conductivity of 4.64 × 10−4 and 4.04 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 353 and 423 K, respectively.331 Furthermore, they developed a set of 2D COFs with various defect degrees and imidazolium functionalities.332 After replacing Br− with TFSI− and doping with LiTFSI, the obtained dCOF-ImTFSI-60@Li displayed maximum conductivity of 7.05 × 10−3 S cm−1. Jiang et al. developed a COF whose pore walls were decorated by oligo(ethyleneoxide) chains (TPB–BMTP-COF).333 After complexation with Li+, oligo(ethylene oxide) chains offered Li+ pathways in COF 1D channels by forming a polyelectrolyte interface. Hence, Li+@TPB–DMTP-COF could achieve a 1.66 × 10−4 S cm−1 ion conductivity, 30 times higher than that without decoration. They further tuned the composition and density of the ionic interface and thus constructed the relationship between the interface and ion conduction performance.334 Periodic 2D COFs with hydrazone linkage were reticulated with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) by Horike et al., which could solvate Li+ for fast ion transport.335 When doped with LiTFSI, the obtained composites, COF-PEO-9-Li, could achieve a 1.33 × 10−3 S cm−1 conductivity. Finally, a battery using COF-PEO-9-Li as the electrolyte was fabricated, showing a 120 mA h g−1 capacity.
The combination of organic solvents and Li salts can further boost the ion conductivity of COFs. A 3D anionic COF (CD-COF) was developed via microwave-assisted strategy, where the γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) components were linked by spiroborate (Fig. 31e).336 After immersing in 1.0 M LiPF6 (solvent: ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate), the obtained composites were pressed into pellets for ion conduction. At 303 K, CD-COF-Li could achieve a 2.7 × 10−3 S cm−1conductivity with a 0.26 eV Ea. Only limited enhancement in ion conduction could be realized through simply incorporating salts into the pores of COFs due to the strong electrostatic interaction and deficiency of transporting medium. Afterwards, they introduced polyethylene glycol (PEG) into ionic COF channels to improve ion conduction.337 After confinement of PEG, PEG–Li+@EB-COF-ClO4 could achieve a 1.78 × 10−3 S cm−1 conductivity with a 0.21 eV Ea at 303 K.
In the abovementioned work, additional Li salts or organic solvents were obligated to enable the ion conduction. However, during practical applications, unwanted interfacial side reactions may happen between the electrode and mobile ions and organic solvents. Lee et al. developed a lithium sulfonated COF (TpPa–SO3Li) as a solvent and ion free single Li+ conductors (Fig. 31f).338 With axially stacked pores, O atoms of keto groups combined with the freely mobile anions, TpPa–SO3Li could achieve a 2.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 conductivity with a 0.18 eV Ea and a Li+ transference number of 0.9. In addition, TpPa–SO3Li could attain electrochemical windows up to 4.0 V. Wang et al. developed a germanate COF with an anthracene linker.339 The germanate centers with low charge to radius ratio enhanced Li+ conductivity, reaching 1.1 × 10−6 and 1.0 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 303 K and 373 K, respectively.
Despite their promising future, there is much more room for improvement: (1) processing powder COFs to membranes; (2) lowering the activation energy for mass transfer and improving their conductivity; (3) collaborations of scientists among organic chemistry, polymer science, electrocatalysis, and batteries. Despite rare examples utilizing COFs for mass transfer and the existence of abundant challenges, the existing research has shown the bright future of COFs in this emerging field (Table 4).

Challenges and perspectives
Rapid developments including molecular design, synthesis, and functionality exploration for COFs have been achieved in the past few decades. These developments have endowed COFs with possibilities to address challenges in environment and energy. In this review, we have summarized the recent new achievements of COFs concerning synthesis and energy applications including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, energy storage, and mass transfer. Although COFs have shown great potential in energy applications, the research of this field is still in its fancy. Further investigations and explorations are indispensable to conquer decisive issues and challenges before their practical applications.
Expanding the visible light absorption, improving the separation efficiency of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs and suppressing the recombination of these charges are the three main directions to enhance the performance of photocatalysts. Increase of conjugation degree and introduction of photoactive building blocks into the frameworks of COFs could expand the visible light absorption and range. Predesign or construction of COFs with D–A, D–A–A, D–A–A structures or constructing heterojunctions or composites is considered as an efficient way to facilitate electron transfer and charge-carrier separation efficiency. However, wettability and long cycle stability are important issues concerning photocatalytic water splitting, CO2RR, and pollutant degradation. In addition, more attention should be paid in harnessing COFs for photocatalytic OER and using them to expand the reaction and substrate scopes of organic transformations. Furthermore, when referring to practical applications, stability, synthesis, large-scale production and the cost should be taken into account while the recently developed full conjugated sp2 carbon linked COF and crystalline CTFs display promising prospects in this field.
Solving the low activity and conductivity issues is at the center of improving the electrocatalytic performance of COFs. Through post synthetic modifications such as introducing metal ions, metal complexes or integrating COFs with conductive substrates, the conductivity and activity of the COFs can be obviously enhanced. Furthermore, COFs can act as precursors to prepare carbon materials with metal clusters or single atom catalysts, which deliver superior electrocatalytic performance. Exploiting COFs to nanosheets or constructing COFs with active sites is indispensable for electrocatalysis. Importantly, combining experiments and theoretical calculations to uncover underlying mechanisms during electrocatalysis is beneficial for developing COFs with high performance. When thoughts moved to practical electrocatalysis, robust frameworks and abundant active sites are essential for pristine COFs. Considering the cost and synthetic difficulties, use of COFs as a precursor to prepare carbon materials is not encouraged, but utilizing COFs as precursors to prepare SACs may be an intriguing direction. From the point of view of the authors, developing COFs with plentiful active sites like COFBTC or using COFs to develop SACs may show the power of COFs in practical applications.
When applying COFs for electrochemical energy storage, the enhancement of conductivity of COFs is still in the core location. First, improving the conjugation degree of the skeletons, post-synthetic modification or hybridization with conductive materials would improve the conductivity of the COFs. Second, rational pore size will be beneficial for fast transportation of the ions. Third, high stability and good wettability with the electrolyte pave the way toward long-term cycling stability. For supercapacitors, high surface area and optimal pore size would generate more electrostatic charge layers and facilitate the electrolyte ion transportation, which would increase the capacitance of the electrode materials. By modifying COFs with redox-active moieties, pseudocapacitance is introduced, which would further improve the capacitance. Hence, the COFs, possessing optimal porous properties, and accessible and abundant redox-active sites like the e-COFs, may share a place in the practical applications. For batteries, COFs with high conductivity and stability, and accessible and abundant redox-active sites are also in high demand. Hence, stable, conductive and redox-active COFs may have potential for practical MIB applications such as the E-TFPB-COF/MnO2 nanosheets for LIBs. For LSBs, suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfide via physical and chemical confinement through the pore structures and chemical bonding of COFs is the key point to improve their discharge capacity, rating and cycling performance. The polysulfide@TFPPy-ETTA-COF, which can physically and chemically confine the shuttle effect, may display their potential in practical applications.
At present, only limited COFs with a few linkages have been developed and applied for mass transfer. Improving the processability while maintaining high proton or ionic conductivity is the core idea to design effective mass transfer COFs. Before practical applications, there are still many challenges to be properly addressed: (1) scope of the linkages, functional groups, the dimension of COFs, etc. should be fully developed to build up a clear structure-performance relationship. (2) The research of COF-based conductors just focusses on the ionic conductivity rather than applying them for fuel cells or batteries. (3) Further efforts should be paid to widening the range of applications in addition to fuel cells and batteries, such as sensors or biological applications.
In addition, the abovementioned strategies, applications, and challenges are based on 2D layered COFs. Accordingly, great efforts should be devoted towards exploring 3D COFs in the field of energy applications. Overall, the relationship between structure and performance should be well established.

Broader context
Green and inexhaustible solar energy along with clean electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies are reliable and promising to alleviate the current energy and environmental issues. Still, there are issues in solar energy exploitation during the process of visible-light adsorption, charge carrier separation and recombination. Besides, problems of insulation, processability, activity, capacity, stability, etc. in electrochemical processes also restrict the energy source and technology utilization. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging crystalline porous materials sharing merits of abundant molecular design, sufficient building blocks, adequate synthetic strategies, high conjugated and modifiable structures, large surface area and porosity. Therefore, COFs exhibit bright prospects in dispelling the abovementioned impediments. In this review, we systematically summarized utilizing COFs for solar energy harnessing, energy storage, energy conversion and mass transfer to give indexes to present research status, trends, existent challenges and possible future directions. We hope that this review could provide inspiration for developing better COFs for clean energy applications and boost the enduring research enthusiasm in this field.
