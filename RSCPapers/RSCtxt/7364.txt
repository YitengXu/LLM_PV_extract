    , Accepted 23rd December 2019First published on 26th December 2019AbstractElucidations on the structure–activity correlations of non-Pt coordination polymer (CP)-based photocatalysts are highly significant for both the enhancement in catalytic activity and large-scale industrial applications of sustainable hydrogen from water splitting. Herein, three isostructural [Cu(HL)2(R-BDC)]n (denoted as Cu-CP-R, HL = 4′-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,2′:6′,4′′-terpyridine, R-BDC = 2-R-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, R = NO2, OH and Br) CPs were solvothermally synthesized by varying the substituents attached to benzenedicarboxylate, which together with two previously reported analogues (R = NH2 and H) were used as photocatalysts to systematically explore the substitution effect on the hydrogen evolution activity. These five CPs feature isomorphic layered motifs with axially elongated CuII octahedra extended alternately by ditopic HL and R-BDC2− connectors, in which R behaves structurally as a non-coordinate group. The hydrogen production rate over the Cu-CP-R photocatalysts increased from 0.21 to 2.34 mmol g−1 h−1, which followed the order of –NH2 > –NO2 > –H > –OH > –Br. Furthermore, the combined experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the free R moiety significantly dominates the photocatalytic activity by shifting the d states of the CuII ion towards the Fermi level, controlling the potential of the conduction band and quickening the charge transfer ability. These important findings can provide informative hints for the design of high-performance, earth-abundant non-noble metal CP-based semi-conductive photocatalysts.
Introduction
The severe environmental pollution and increasing energy crisis have recently made the search for sustainable and clean energy extremely necessary and urgent.1 Due to the high energy conversion efficiency from solar energy to hydrogen energy and abundant water source on earth, molecular hydrogen production from photocatalytic water splitting has emerged as one of the promising hydrogen evolution methods.2 Therefore, the deep understanding of the inherent structure–activity correlations as well as the development of earth-abundant, highly active and long-term durable photocatalysts is of particular importance, which can significantly dominate the large-scale industrial and commercial applications of photocatalytic water splitting.3
Non-Pt coordination polymers (CPs) constructed from π-conjugated organic ligands and cheap transition metal centers/clusters have recently become excellent candidates to efficiently photocatalyze water splitting.4–7 To date, the hydrogen evolution rates of water reduction over the known ZnII, NiII/III, CoII and CuI/II-based CP photocatalysts have been greatly improved from 32 μmol g−1 h−1 to 19.3 mmol g−1 h−1, which is almost 600-fold enhancement in the catalytic performance.8–15 Apparently, the great improvement in the catalytic activity has significantly benefited from the various effective strategies to enhance the photocatalytic mechanism of CPs. For example, to harvest and extend the light absorption ability of CPs, well-known light-sensitive dye molecules or fluorescent groups have been covalently incorporated with the conjugated organic ligand of photocatalysts, significantly resulting in ultrafast charge separation processes with high quantum yields and effective suppression of electron–hole recombination at the dye–semiconductor interface accounting for the increased catalytic performance.6–9,16 To mimic the active sites of natural [NiFe] hydrogenases with high hydrogen evolution performance and long-term robust stability, layered binuclear and nonanuclear nickel cluster-based photocatalytic systems have been fabricated, which have simultaneously exhibited high solar conversion and water utilization efficiency.10,11 Recently, the π–π interactions from the organic ligand of CP-based photocatalysts were observed to be beneficial for the transmission of photo-generated holes, efficiently inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.12–15 Nevertheless, the structure–catalytic activity relationships over CP-based photocatalysts are still unclear, which has limited their feasible applications in photocatalytic water splitting to different extents. In our efforts to develop low-cost transition metal CP-based hydrogen production photocatalysts for water splitting, we found that the free amino group attached on layered complexes can boost their hydrogen evolution activity by increasing the electron density around the CuII center.17 Herein, to gain more insight into the effect of ligand substitution on the photocatalytic activity, three new Cu(II)-based CPs with different substituents appended on the auxiliary terephthalate ligand, [Cu(HL)2(R-BDC)]n (denoted as Cu-CP-R, HL = 4′-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,2′:6′,4′′-terpyridine, R-BDC = 2-R-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, R = NO2, OH and Br), were solvothermally synthesized and used as catalysts to drive hydrogen production from water splitting under visible-light irradiation. The single-crystal structural determination revealed that these three CPs are isostructural to our previously reported photocatalysts with R = H and NH2,18 which affords a good chance to systemically investigate the substituent effect in the present photocatalytic system. Herein, the synthesis, structure and photocatalytic performances of five analogous Cu-CP-R photocatalysts were explored and further compared to establish the structure–catalytic activity relationship.
Experimental
Materials
All raw chemicals were purchased from either J&K Scientific or Tianjin Chemical Reagent Factory and used as received without further purification. Double-deionized water was used during the conventional synthesis. 4′-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-4,2′:6′,4′′-terpyridine (HL) was synthesized according to the previously reported method.19
Physical measurements
Elemental analyses for C, H and N were carried out with a CE 440 (Leeman-Labs) analyzer. Fourier transform (FT) IR spectra (KBr pellets) were measured on an Avatar 370 (Nicolet) spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Shimadzu simultaneous DTG 60A compositional analysis instrument from room temperature to 800 °C under an N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), with a scan speed of 0.1 s per step and a 2θ step size of 0.01°. The simulated PXRD pattern was calculated using the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and processed with the free Mercury v1.4 program provided by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center. UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured on a U-4100 UV-vis spectrophotometer (HITACHI) equipped with an integrating sphere assembly. The quantum yield of the photocatalyst at 520 nm was measured using the same experimental setup for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with an additional band pass filter to obtain monochromatic light (λ = 520 nm). The power density was found to be ca. 36.7 mW cm−2. The quantum yield was evaluated using the percentage ratio of the number of evolved hydrogen molecules and the number of incident photons.
Synthesis of [Cu(HL)2(NO2-BDC)]n (Cu-CP-NO2)
A mixture of CuSO4 (20.0 mg, 0.1 mmol), HL (16.3 mg, 0.05 mmol), 2-nitrobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (NO2-H2BDC, 10.5 mg, 0.05 mmol) and aqueous HCl solution (1.0 mol L−1, 100 μL) was added to a mixed C2H5OH–DMF–H2O solution (5.0 mL, v:v:v = 2:2:1). The resulting mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (23.0 mL) and heated at 120 °C for 72 h. Afterwards, the mixture was slowly cooled to 25 °C at a rate of 1.3 °C h−1, and blue block-shaped crystals were grown directly, separated manually and dried in air (yield: 25% based on the HL ligand).

Synthesis of [Cu(HL)2(OH-BDC)]n (Cu-CP-OH)
CuCl2·2H2O (17.1 mg, 0.1 mmol), HL (16.3 mg, 0.05 mmol), 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (OH-H2BDC, 18.2 mg, 0.1 mmol), aqueous HCl solution (1.0 mol L−1, 50 μL), C2H5OH (2.0 mL), DMF (2.0 mL) and water (2.0 mL) were sealed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel (23.0 mL). The vessel was heated at 90 °C for 72 h. Afterwards the mixture was slowly cooled to 25 °C at a rate of 1.3 °C h−1, and blue block-shaped crystals of Cu-CP-OH suitable for X-ray single-crystal structural determination were grown directly, separated manually and dried in air (yield: 20% based on the HL ligand).

Synthesis of [Cu(HL)2(Br-BDC)]n (Cu-CP-Br)
The synthetic procedure for Cu-CP-Br was similar to that of Cu-CP-OH except that the reactant mixture sealed in the vessel was changed to CuCl2·2H2O (34.2 mg, 0.2 mmol), 2-bromo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (Br-H2BDC, 24.5 mg, 0.1 mmol), HL (16.3 mg, 0.05 mmol), C2H5OH (3.0 mL), DMF (2.0 mL), aqueous HCl solution (1.0 mol L−1, 50 μL) and water (3.0 mL). Blue block-shaped crystals of Cu-CP-Br suitable for X-ray single-crystal structural determination were grown directly, and separated manually and dried in air (yield: 10% based on the HL ligand).

X-ray data collection and structure determination
Diffraction intensities of the as-synthesized complexes were collected on a Bruker APEX-II QUAZAR diffractometer equipped with a graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation source with a radiation wavelength of 0.71073 Å using the φ–ω scan technique at a specific temperature. There was no evidence of crystal decay during data collection. Semiempirical Multiscan absorption corrections were applied by SADABS20 and the program SAINT21 was used for the integration of the diffraction profiles. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-2014/7 programs.22 The crystallographic data and selected bond lengths and angles are presented in Tables S1 and S2,† respectively.
Computational methods
All calculations were carried out with density functional theory within the projected-augmented plane wave method as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).23,24 The generalized gradient approximation as suggested by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof was employed to accurately describe the weak interaction.25 The Monkhorst–Pack mesh26 of 2 × 2 × 2 and 6 × 6 × 6 k-points were used to sample the Brillouin zone for geometry optimizations and electronic structure calculations, respectively. The kinetic energy cutoff was set to be 500 eV for the plane-wave basis set. Geometry optimizations were performed with a convergence threshold of 10−5 eV in energy and 0.02 eV Å−1 for the force using the conjugated gradient method.
Photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction
Photocatalytic water splitting experiments were conducted in a top-irradiation-type Pyrex reaction cell connected to a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. Photocatalyst (5.0 mg) and Eosin Y (EY, 5.0 mg) were added to a mixture of water and triethanolamine (TEOA, 100.0 mL, v:v = 99:1, pH = 10 adjusted by aqueous HCl solution) in a round-bottom quartz flask. The mixture was evacuated several times to remove air completely prior to irradiation and the flask was placed in a water jacketed beaker controlled to 25 °C. The system was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300) with a cut-off filter of 420 nm (wavelength: 420–780 nm). The hydrogen gas was analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-7920) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical Mott–Schottky plots were measured on an AMETEK Princeton Applied Research (Versa STAT 4) electrochemical workstation using the Cu-CP-R/FTO combination as the working electrode, platinum foil as the counter electrode and saturated Ag/AgCl/KCl as the reference electrode. A 300 W xenon lamp (CEL-HUV300) with a 420 nm cut-off filter (420–780 nm) was used as the light source. The working electrode Cu-CP-R/FTO was prepared by dropping a suspension (50 μL) containing photocatalyst (3.0 mg), ethanol (1.0 mL) and Nafion (20 μL) directly onto an FTO plate. The surface area of the working electrode exposed to the electrolyte was about 0.64 cm2. Mott–Schottky curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and transient photocurrent response experiments of the catalyst of different electrodes were measured in 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution with pH = 10 adjusted by 1.0 M aqueous NaOH solution.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and IR spectra
All three new Cu-CP-R were solvothermally obtained by varying the substitutes attached on the parent terephthalate. The molar ratio of the reactants and pH of the media were found to significantly govern the formation of the target crystalline CPs. In the FT-IR spectra, the broad absorption centered at ca. 3500 ± 77 cm−1 is attributed to the characteristic stretching vibration for the phenolic hydroxyl group from the neutral HL ligand. No apparent band was observed at 1695, 1707 and 1672 cm−1, indicating the full deprotonation of the R-substituted terephthalate coligands in the resulting CPs. Multiple strong adsorptions for the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate group were located at 1586 ± 10, 1557 ± 25, 1400 ± 6 and 1364 ± 2 cm−1.27 Additionally, a weak band for the stretching vibration of nitro group was found at 1537 cm−1 in Cu-CP-NO2.28
Crystal structure
All three new CPs with different coligands are crystallographically isostructural (Table S1†), also possessing the same structure as that of our previously reported Cu-CP-H and Cu-CP-NH2.18 Due to their similar motifs, only the structure of Cu-CP-NO2 is described herein as a representative example, and the differences will be mentioned where appropriate. Cu-CP-NO2 crystallizes from the triclinic P space group, exhibiting a two-dimensional (2D) layered framework with octahedral CuII ions alternatively extended by anionic R-BDC2− and neutral HL ligands. The asymmetric unit of Cu-CP-NO2 includes half of a CuII ion, a neutral HL ligand and half of a doubly deprotonated NO2-BDC2− anion.
As shown in Fig. 1a, the centrosymmetric CuII ion is in the N2O4 donor set, in which two pyridyl Npyridyl and two phenolic Ophenolic donors in the equatorial plane are from four separate HL ligands, and two axial carboxylate Ocarboxylate atoms belong to two symmetry-related NO2-BDC2− anions. The coordination configuration of the CuII ion can be described as an axially elongated octahedron with an axial Cu–Ocarboxylate 0.6 Å longer than that in the equatorial plane due to the Jahn–Teller effect (Table S2†). The neutral HL ligand presents phenoxo and pyridyl moieties to coordinate with the CuII ion in a bidentate bridging mode. By contrast, the doubly deprotonated NO2-BDC2− anion is centrosymmetric, serving as a ditopic linker to extend the neighbouring CuII ions through two unidentate carboxylate segments. Notably, the nitro group attached on the terephthalate acts only as a non-coordination group.

The individual CuII octahedra are extended by neutral HL and anionic NO2-BDC2− connectors, leading to a (4 4) layer with the intralayer CuII⋯CuII distances of 11.2054(16) Å and 13.898(2) Å (Fig. 1b). The adjacent layers are further stacked together through interlayer π⋯π interactions, giving rise to a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular architecture with an interlayer separation of 13.898(2) Å (Fig. S1†). The non-coordinating R group appended on the parent terephthalate only slightly influences the bond lengths (0.019 Å < Δr < 0.047 Å) and angles (Δθ < ±0.06°) around the CuII ion (Table S2†). Thus, the modulations on the electronic structures of these five CPs are hopefully expected through the pendant R groups.
PXRD patterns and thermogravimetric analysis
The PXRD pattern of each as-prepared sample matches well with the computer-simulated pattern (Fig. S2†), evidencing that the bulk obtained samples are homogeneous and have the same phase structure with that of the single-crystal data. Moreover, the PXRD pattern of the recovered sample from aqueous solution with pH = 10 is also consistent with that of the pristine sample, suggesting that the non-precious Cu-CP-R are water stable and can be used to accelerate the photochemical water splitting in an alkaline environment. The compositional stability of the five products were further investigated via TGA (Fig. S3†). The first weight-loss temperature of Cu-CP-NO2 is lower by 27 °C than that of the other four CPs (281 °C vs. 308 °C), suggesting the slight compositional instability of Cu-CP-NO2. Upon further heating, the mixed organic ligands of the CPs were lost obviously. Thus, all the CPs examined herein have excellent thermal and water stability and can be used as photocatalysts to trigger water splitting.
Optical properties
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the CPs were recorded at room temperature to explore their optical properties, together with the two previous reported complexes Cu-CP-NH2 and Cu-CP-H for comparison. As shown in Fig. 2, the five isostructural CPs exhibit two broad absorptions between 250 and 480 nm and between 486 and 800 nm, resulting in slightly different crystal colors of the resulting CPs (Fig. 2 inset). The former absorption should be attributed to the π → π* and n → π* transitions of the two different organic ligands,13,29 and the latter results from the d–d transition of the CuII ion. Further comparison revealed that the substituents can slightly affect the absorption edges of the former absorption, which are important for the band gaps. Based on the UV-vis DRS data, the band gap (Eg) of the CPs were calculated using the Kubelka–Munk function.30,31 The obtained Eg values are 2.60 eV for Cu-CP-NO2, 2.50 eV for Cu-CP-OH and 2.20 eV for Cu-CP-Br (Fig. S4†). Apparently, all three CPs have a semiconductive nature, and can be potentially used as photocatalysts for water reduction.
 Fig. 2  UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the five CPs (inset: digital photographs of the five CPs). 
The CB potentials of the three semi-conductive CPs were further obtained through flat band position measurements using their electrochemical Mott–Schottky curves. The positive slope for the plot of C−2vs. potential indicates that they are typically n-type semiconductors (Fig. 3),32 consistent with the two known analogues. The flat band potentials were determined to be −1.14 V, −1.08 V and −1.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Thus, the CB potentials are −1.04 V, −0.98 V and −0.95 V (vs. NHE), which are between the CB of EY* (−1.20 V vs. NHE)8 and the redox potential of H+/H2 (−0.59 V vs. NHE, pH = 10),33 meaning that the Cu-CP-R can accept the photo-excited electrons from the photosensitizer and further transfer them to water substrate in an alkaline environment. More importantly, the CB potentials of these photocatalysts are non-coordinating substituent dependent, which gradually shift from −0.95 V to −1.10 V (vs. NHE) with the R group in the order of –Br < –OH < –H < –NO2 < –NH2. The more negative the CB potential, the stronger the reduction ability of the photocatalyst. It should be noted that the order of the CB potential for the five CPs is inconsistent with the Hammett substituent constant, suggesting the important role of the CuII ion in the CB potential of the resulting semi-conductive photocatalyst. The inherent electronic interactions from the d electrons of the CuII ion and p orbitals of the substituent were further considered by theoretical calculations.

Theoretical calculation
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed based on the structure models shown in Fig. 1 to investigate the significant roles of the non-coordination R substituents. The projected density of states (PDOS) of the Cu atom and R groups were calculated and shown in Fig. 4. The d orbitals of the CuII ion are significantly hybridized with the p orbitals of the substituents. Also, both the VB and CB of Cu-CP-R are pushed downward in energy following the substituent group sequence of –NH2, –NO2, –H, –OH, and –Br, which is consistent with the experimental Mott–Schottky results.34,35 Moreover, as illustrated by the PDOS in Fig. 4, the d states of the CuII ion move towards the Fermi level due to the modulation of the R moiety, which is associated with promoted adsorbate–metal interaction, thus leading to higher activity of the CuII site.

Photocatalytic activities
The hydrogen evolution performance of photocatalytic water splitting over Cu-CP-R was estimated in slightly basic medium with EY as the photosensitizer and TEOA as the sacrificial electron donor under visible light irradiation. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, as the reaction proceeded, the hydrogen production increased to different degrees over the three Cu-CP-R catalysts. The average hydrogen production rate was 1.33 mmol g−1 h−1 for Cu-CP-NO2, 0.43 mmol g−1 h−1 for Cu-CP-OH and 0.21 mmol g−1 h−1 for Cu-CP-Br. The two previous analogues showed the hydrogen rates of 2.34 mmol g−1 h−1 for Cu-CP-NH2 and 1.06 mmol g−1 h−1for Cu-CP-H.18 A control experiment without any photocatalyst was also performed in the presence of EY and TEOA, and only a small amount hydrogen gas was detected (0.20 mmol g−1 h−1). Apparently, as compared with the control experiment, the five semi-conductive photocatalysts with different non-coordinating R groups could dramatically photocatalyze hydrogen production following the order of –NH2 > –NO2 > –H > –OH > –Br. The quantum yields of the three CPs were further determined at the optimized wavelength of 520 nm, which are 0.39‰ for Cu-CP-NO2, 0.18‰ for Cu-CP-OH and 0.15‰ for Cu-CP-Br. Apparently, the substituent-dependent catalytic activity is consistent with both the CB potentials and the quantum yields of the Cu-CP-R CPs.

After the photocatalytic reaction, the PXRD pattern of each recovered catalyst was measured and found to be almost the same as that for the as-synthesized sample (Fig. S2†), indicating the high framework stability of these photocatalysts during the photocatalytic reaction. As a typical example, the reusability of Cu-CP-NO2 was evaluated. After three consecutive catalytic runs, the hydrogen production rate decreased from 1.33 to 0.34 mmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. S5†). The decay in its catalytic performance may be significantly due to the slight partial decomposition of the extended structure of the photocatalyst.
Accepting and transfer ability for photo-excited electrons
To compare the accepting and migrating ability of the photo-excited electrons during the catalytic reaction, steady fluorescence quenching, transient photocurrent response and EIS measurements were performed for these photocatalysts. It was found that the emission intensity of EY at 541 nm gradually decreased with an increase in Cu-CP-R (Fig. S6†), suggesting that the photo-excited electron transfer occurs from EY* to the photocatalyst. The quenching constants (KSV) were approximately calculated to be 190 M−1 for Cu-CP-NO2, 220 M−1 for Cu-CP-OH and 65 M−1 for Cu-CP-Br according to the Stern–Volmer equation.10 The non-substituted and amino-substituted photocatalysts have the quenching constants of 230 M−1 (Cu-CP-H) and 190 M−1 (Cu-CP-NH2), and TEOA has the smallest KSV value of 4.05 M−1.18 The larger KSV value of each photocatalyst than that of TEOA suggests that Cu-CP-R can more favorably accept photo-generated electrons than TEOA. However, it should be noted that the quenching efficiency of the five Cu-CP-Rs on EY* is inconsistent with their CB potentials. The relatively small change in the fluorescence intensity in the complicated heterogeneous dispersion system should be responsible for this inconsistency. Additionally, as depicted in Fig. 6, the strongest photocurrent response signal and the smallest radius of the arc in the Nyquist diagram of Cu-CP-NH2 indicate the quickest charge movement and smaller charge transfer resistance in the solid interface of the electrode. Additionally, the experimental resistance data are consistent with the theoretical calculation results. As shown in Fig. 4, the electronic states of the Cu-CP-R CPs with different substitutions are located at different positions relative to the Fermi level. Cu-CP-NH2 is in the metallic state with an enhanced carrier density at the Fermi level. Cu-CP-NO2 has two narrow electronic states distributed up and down the Fermi level, indicative of its quasi-metallic nature, which is also responsible for its relatively high electrical conductivity. By contrast, the electronic states of the other three CPs are further away from the Fermi level to different extents, suggesting a decrease in electron density. The higher electron density at the Fermi level leads to higher electrical conductivity, which is consistent with the results of the resistance test. These results are also in accordance with the sequence of catalytic activities over the five Cu-CP-R photocatalysts. The combined results from the steady fluorescence quenching, transient photocurrent response and EIS measurements suggest that the charge transfer resistance of Cu-CP-R is much more important for boosting the hydrogen production than the accepting ability from the photosensitizer.

Conclusions
The substitution effect on the hydrogen production activity for water splitting was established over a series of five isostructural non-Pt CP-based photocatalysts. The combined theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that the non-coordinating groups attached on the layered Cu(II)-based CPs can shift the d states of the CuII ion to the Fermi level, regulate the favorable conduction band potential and decrease the charge transfer resistance of the resulting semi-conductive photocatalysts through the interactions between the p orbitals of the R group and d states of the CuII ion, resulting in an improvement in the hydrogen evolution rate from 0.21 to 2.34 mmol g−1 h−1, following the substituent sequence of –NH2 > –NO2 > –H > –OH > –Br. These observations present a new strategy for the design of highly-efficient non-noble metal-derived CP photocatalysts through electronic structure modulation.
