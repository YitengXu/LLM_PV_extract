Copper–indium is a non-noble metal catalyst with high activity towards CO production. However, there is a lack of control of parameters which enhance the selective CO production on copper–indium oxide. Here, the role of oxygen vacancy (VO) defects in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ERC) to selective CO production is reported. CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites with different VO concentrations were synthesized under different synthesis environments. CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites prepared in an argon environment exhibited higher VO concentrations as compared to nanocomposites prepared in an air environment. DFT calculations demonstrated that the activation barrier decreases from 0.48 eV to 0.31 eV for the nanocomposite having a higher VO concentration, thus exhibiting a CO yield with 85% faradaic efficiency at −0.895 V vs. RHE, suggesting that VO defects serve as the active sites for CO2 adsorption. This study provides a novel route for the enhancement in selective ERC to CO by inducing the optimum concentration of VO in CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites.
1. Introduction
The production of clean, sustainable, and carbon-neutral energy is the most important scientific and technical challenge facing the 21st century.1 An efficient means of converting CO2 into industrial feedstock and chemicals is a sustainable and promising approach to attain a carbon-neutral cycle that can potentially mitigate impending environmental crises.2–5 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop stable and energetically feasible electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2, which can minimize the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).
The production of CO is important as it is widely used as a feedstock for industrial synthesis of hydrocarbons and liquid fuels.6,7 There have been extensive studies on copper-based electrocatalysts owing to the low cost and higher selectivity of CO2 to CO conversion.8–11 However, the relatively high overpotential requirements and incomplete understanding of the factors affecting product selectivity are the key challenges for this approach.12 Numerous strategies have been reported in the literature to enhance the faradaic efficiency of CO production (FECO), such as utilization of bimetallic copper alloys with Pd and In,9,13,14 bimetallic Co with Ag,15 different stoichiometric mixtures of Cu with Sn and Au,16,17 composites of Cu with indium oxide (IO),18 carbon-coated indium oxide nanobelts,19 Cu–In co-doped TiO2,20 and the introduction of oxygen vacancy (VO) defects in Ga2O3, Co3O4 and ZnO electrocatalysts.21–23 Moreover, recent investigations have been focused on Cu–In electrocatalysts as the presence of In is known to suppress the HER.24 Bimetallic Cu–In electrodes were found to improve the FECO to 85% at the moderate potential of −0.6 V (vs. RHE) in comparison with an oxidized Cu electrode.25 Kink sites of Cu, which are active for HER, were covered by In, thus suppressing the HER, and enhanced selectivity for CO on the bimetallic Cu–In electrodes was achieved.25 This is supported by the observation that an In alloy supported on Cu nanowires displays CO formation with a FECO of 90% at −0.6 V (vs. RHE).26 It has also been observed that the dendritic morphology of the Cu–In bimetallic alloy further enhances the selectivity of the reaction.14 Syngas formation can be tuned on the Cu/In2O3 catalyst maybe due to enhancement in binding strength of *COOH on its surface because of lattice compression and Cu doping in the In2O3 shell.27 Additionally, metal oxide–metal oxide surfaces are found to contain more active sites for CO2 reduction as compared to metal–metal surfaces, which further leads to the enhanced selectivity for CO formation.18
Recent investigations have suggested that introducing VO defects in electrocatalysts could facilitate the activation of CO2 and dissociation of the products by tailoring the properties of the electrode surface.23 For example, periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations of CO2 hydrogenation on an In2O3 (110) surface has also suggested that the presence of VO could assist in CO2 activation and stabilization of key reaction intermediates.21 A study of the VO defect sites on Ga2O3 has shown that the oxygen atom of CO2 is adsorbed on the VO sites of Ga2O3 which lowers the adsorption energy of CO2 from −0.13 eV to −0.31 eV.21 The selectivity for the formation of formate was found to increase to 85% for VO-rich Co3O4 in comparison with Co3O4 containing fewer VO defects (∼67.3%) due to a decrease in the rate-limiting activation energy barrier from 0.51 to 0.40 eV, respectively.22 In a separate study, the efficiency for the formation of formate was enhanced to 83% in VO-rich ZnO nanosheets as the introduction of VO sites modified the surface properties and increased the binding strength of CO2 on the catalytic surface.23 However, enhancement in selective product formation and high overpotential requirements still remain a big challenge to the use of these catalysts at the industrial level.
In the present study, we engineer different VO concentrations in CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites which were used as electrocatalysts for the selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO at low overpotential. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies have not demonstrated a direct correlation between the presence of VO defect concentration and ERC. Also, there is a lack of data on the effect of VO defect concentration in CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites on ERC. Here, we report an effective and economical chemical protocol to optimize the concentration of VO defects in CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites for ERC. Indium oxide was used as the supporting material in the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite, as indium requires a higher potential for the adsorption of hydrogen as compared to Cu, which suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction.24 Photoluminescence (PL), X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy were utilized to demonstrate that the nanocomposites synthesized in an argon environment contain a higher concentration of VO defects and thus exhibit higher faradaic efficiency for CO formation (FECO) as compared to nanocomposites with lower VO defect concentration. Moreover, we conduct electrochemical measurements and DFT modeling to gain an in-depth understanding of the plausible correlation between VO defect concentration and the CO2 reduction capabilities of the nanocomposites. We demonstrate that the concentration of VO defects in CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites controls the amount of selective CO production through electrochemical reduction of CO2 at low overpotential values.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
The chemicals used to synthesize the bare CuO nanorods and CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites were obtained from commercial sources: copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 95%, CDH, India), indium(III) nitrate hexahydrate (In(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.9%, Sigma Aldrich, India), and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, Sigma Aldrich, India). The chemicals for the electrochemical measurements, such as Nafion® 117 and porous carbon paper (thickness of 180 μm and 77% porosity) were purchased from Fuel Cell Store, USA, and Cetech, Taiwan, respectively. All of the chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized water (18 MΩ cm) was used during all of the experiments.
2.2. Electrocatalyst synthesis

2.2.1. Preparation of CuO nanorods. 
The CuO nanostructures were prepared by a modified sol–gel method.28 For the preparation of CuO nanorods, 5 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was added to 100 ml distilled water to obtain a homogeneous solution, and the pH was adjusted to 9.0 by dropwise addition of NH4OH. The solution was stirred at 80 °C for 2 hours to obtain a precipitate that was washed with distilled water to remove unreacted species. The precipitate was dried in an oven at 120 °C for 7–8 hours. The product was powdered and calcined at 500 °C for 4 hours in a tubular furnace for complete phase transformation of Cu(OH)2 to copper oxide (CuO). Finally, two different CuO samples with different concentrations of VO defects were obtained by changing the environment (air and argon at a flow rate of 100 sccm) in a tubular furnace during the calcination step of the synthesis process.


2.2.2. Preparation of CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. 
Different concentrations of In2O3 (5%, 10% or 15%) were used for the synthesis of the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. 5 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and 0.25, 0.50 or 0.75 g of In(NO3)3·6H2O were added to 100 ml distilled water for the preparation of 5%, 10% or 15% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites, respectively. Then NH4OH solution was added dropwise to the homogenous Cu–In solution to adjust its pH to 9.0. The solution was stirred at 80 °C for 2 hours to obtain a precipitate that was washed with distilled water to remove unreacted nitrate ions and dried in an oven at 120 °C for 7–8 hours. The dried precipitate was powdered and calcined at 500 °C for 4 hours in a tubular furnace for complete phase transformation of In(OH)3 to In2O3 and Cu(OH)2 to CuO. The 5%, 10% and 15% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites with different VO defect concentrations were obtained by changing the calcination environment (air or argon at a flow rate of 100 sccm) in a tubular furnace.

2.3. Electrocatalyst characterization
The XRD patterns of bare CuO nanorods and CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites were obtained by using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer equipped with monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) as the X-ray source and scanned in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. The morphology of the samples was determined by scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss SEM EVO 18 Special Edition). The elemental composition of the samples was determined using a Swift ED 3000 instrument attached to a TM 3000 Tabletop Microscope. A JEOL JEM 1400 electron microscope with LaB6 filament was used for particle size determination of the CuO nanorods and CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Tecnai G20) was used to analyze the grain size, crystallographic facets, and structures of CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to quantify the defects in the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. Spectra were obtained by XPS (Kα+ Thermo Fisher Scientific Instruments, UK, operating in ultrahigh vacuum with a pressure of 2 × 10−9 mbar). The XPS spectrometer uses an Al Kα X-ray source, operating at 6 mA beam current and 12 kV. The instrument was calibrated with Ag3d (352 eV). The XPS peak position was referenced to the carbon C 1s peak (284.8 eV).
Photoluminescence spectroscopy (HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution) with an excitation wavelength of 514 nm (green laser) was used for the determination of the concentration of VO and copper vacancy (VCu) defects in the electrocatalysts. Cryogenic continuous-wave (cw) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements were performed to confirm the VO defects in the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. The cw EPR spectra were obtained on a custom-designed cw/pulsed X-band Bruker Elexsys 580 EPR spectrometer at 5.5 K using a dual-mode ER 4116-DM resonator (Bruker BioSpin Corporation) equipped with a continuous-flow E900 cryostat (Oxfordshire, UK). The cw EPR spectra were acquired at an operating microwave frequency of 9.64 GHz with a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 3 G, and microwave power of 2 mW. A Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) (BELSORP-MINI) surface area analyzer at 77 K in a N2 atmosphere was used to determine the porosity and surface area for each CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite. For surface area measurement, 0.15 g of each electrocatalyst was used. The electrochemical measurements were performed using a PGstat-320N, Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat.
2.4. Electrode preparation
A catalyst ink solution was prepared by ultrasonication of a mixture of 10 mg of synthesized samples, 5 μl Nafion solution (5 wt%) and 5 ml ethanol for 60 minutes. To obtain the working electrode, the ink solution was uniformly coated on the surface of porous carbon paper (2 cm2) by using an air spray technique with nitrogen as the carrier gas.8,15
2.5. Electrochemical setup
A two-chamber electrochemical cell with a three-electrode assembly was used to perform the electrochemical reduction of CO2.8 The cathodic and anodic chambers of the cell were separated by a pre-treated Nafion-117 membrane. Both chambers contained 20 ml of 0.5 M KHCO3 solution, and a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl/(1 M KCl), CH Instruments) and the working electrode (catalyst coated on carbon paper) were placed in the cathodic chamber. A platinum rod was used as a counter electrode in the anodic chamber. The electrolyte in the cathodic chamber was saturated with CO2 gas that was also continuously purged through the chamber at a flow rate of 15 ml min−1. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 was performed at various potentials using a potentiostat/galvanostat. All of the potentials were converted to reference hydrogen electrode (RHE) by using the relation ERHE (V) = EAg/AgCl (V) + 0.23 (V) + 0.059 pH (V). The gaseous products from the cathodic chamber were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, NUCON 5765) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H2 gas and a flame ionization detector (FID) for CO and hydrocarbons. The presence of CO was analyzed in the FID after conversion to CH4 using a methanizer.4 All electrochemical experiments were conducted at 25 °C temperature and 1 atm pressure.
2.6. Density functional theory calculations
Our theoretical methodology involves first principles calculations under the framework of density functional theory (DFT) using a plane-wave basis set as implemented in Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).29 PAW potentials were used within generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) and a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.30,31 Initially, we determined the global minimum configurations of a wide range of CuxInyOz clusters using a cascade genetic algorithm.31 Here, the x and y stoichiometry was varied to match the composition of the experimentally synthesized nanocomposites (viz. 5% In and 95% Cu [Cu19In1], 10% In and 90% Cu [Cu18In2] or 15% In and 85% Cu [Cu17In3]). Following this, the oxygen content (z) was varied in the range from zero to the maximum number of atoms that can be adsorbed onto the cluster to determine the most stable phase under the oxygen environment. For each stoichiometry, the total free energy was minimized with respect to the chemical potential of oxygen to determine the minimum free energy configuration that is likely representative of the model systems [Cu17In3O15] to mimic the experimentally determined nanostructures. All of the DFT calculations were performed with energy and force tolerance values that converged at less than 10−5 eV and 10−3 eV Å−1, respectively. A plane wave cut-off value of 600 eV was used in all of the calculations with a Γ-centered K-mesh.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Physical characterization
The structure and phase data of the bare CuO nanorods and CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites, synthesized in both air and argon environments, were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The peaks at 32.50°, 35.46°, 38.73°, 48.74°, 53.46°, 58.31°, 60.67°, 66.27°, 68.14°, 72.43° and 75.26° (2θ) corresponding to the (110), (11), (111), (02), (020), (202), (13), (11), (220), (311) and (22) plane with the monoclinic phase of CuO (JCPDS: 41-0254) are shown in Fig. S1.† There were no extra peaks observed in the XRD pattern of CuO. The diffraction peaks of the 5%, 10% and 15% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites synthesized in an air and argon environment are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The peaks at 21.49°, 30.57° and 51.03° correspond to the (211), (222) and (440) plane, respectively, that are well indexed to the body centered cubic phase of In2O3 (JCPDS: 06-0416). The peaks at 32.50°, 38.73°, 48.74°, 53.46°, 58.31°, 66.27°, 68.14°, 72.43° and 75.26° (2θ) correspond to the (110), (111), (02), (020), (202), (11), (220), (311) and (22) plane, respectively, that are in agreement with the monoclinic phase of CuO. However, some of the peaks were associated with both the materials. The peaks at 35.46° and 60.67° match well with the (400) and (622) plane of In2O3 and the (11) and (13) planes of CuO in the nanocomposites. No significant shift in peak positions of the nanocomposites was observed revealing that the nanocomposites with different concentrations prepared in different environments have the same crystal structure. The crystallite sizes of the catalysts are shown in Table S1.†

The morphologies of all of the electrocatalysts are shown in Fig. S2.† Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements were used to determine the elemental composition of the nanocomposites. These measurements revealed the presence of In, O, and Cu in the samples and an aluminium peak in each EDX spectrum appeared due to the instrument stub which was used to mount the samples for measurements (Fig. S3†).
To further examine the nanocomposites in real and reciprocal space, we performed TEM and HRTEM measurements, which confirmed that the nanoparticles were arranged in a 1D morphology (Fig. S4a–f†). The nanocomposites were highly agglomerated when prepared in argon (Fig. S4d–f†) in comparison to air (Fig. S4a–c†). Moreover, it is interesting that some of the nanoparticles were deposited on the fiber-like morphology of the nanocomposites as highlighted by yellow circles in Fig. S4f.† The HRTEM images (Fig. S4g and h†) reveal the crystalline nature of the nanocomposites, as we observed well-organized lattice fringes of interplanar spacing, d = 0.29 nm and d = 0.25 nm, corresponding to the (222) plane of In2O332 and the (11) plane of CuO,33 respectively. The planes were obtained by relating the corresponding d-spacing with JCPDS data marked on the electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig. S4g and h†). The elemental mapping images revealed the presence of Cu, In and O elements (Fig. S4i–l†).
In order to determine the relative concentration of VO in the CuO and CuO/In2O3 nanostructures, we performed a series of measurements using various techniques. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra with excitation wavelength λex = 514 nm of the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites and CuO nanostructures are shown in Fig. 2a–d. For the PL measurement, a uniform film of each electrocatalyst was obtained by dropcasting of the solution on an n-type silicon wafer; this solution was prepared by ultrasonicating a mixture of 3 mg of each electrocatalyst in 5 ml of ethanol for 30 minutes. In the PL spectra (Fig. 2a–c), the peak at 781 nm was attributed to singly ionized VO of CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites arising from the recombination of a photogenerated hole with a singly ionized electron in the valence band and the peak at 906 nm corresponds to VCu defects in bare CuO nanorods and CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites (Fig. 2a–d).34,35 There were no shifts in the wavelength of the PL spectra of the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite and CuO nanostructures; however, the concentration of defects was different for nanocomposites and nanostructures synthesized in air and argon environment. The PL spectra revealed the presence of higher concentrations of both singly charged VO as well as VCu defects in the nanocomposites synthesized in argon in comparison to nanocomposites that were synthesized in air (Fig. 2a–c).

The higher concentration of VO in CuO/In2O3 synthesized in an argon environment might be due to the inert nature of the gas. Moreover, in the case of the bare CuO nanorods that were synthesized in argon, there was a significant increase in the VCu defects as compared to nanorods synthesized in air (Fig. 2d). The PL intensity curve (Fig. S5†) revealed that the 10% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite that was synthesized in argon exhibited the highest number of VO and VCu defects amongst all of the nanocomposites. Thus, the samples prepared in argon are termed as VO-rich, while those that were prepared in air are referred to as VO-poor samples.
The density of defects and the chemical state of copper and indium in both the VO-rich and the VO-poor 10% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites were determined by XPS measurements (Fig. 3). The purity and crystallinity of the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite were confirmed by an XPS survey scan which revealed that there were no impurities present (Fig. S6†). In the XPS spectra of In 3d, the peaks at 452.0 eV and 444.8 eV correspond to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 transition, respectively (Fig. 3a).32 This suggests that indium was present as In3+ in the nanocomposites. There were no horizontal shifts in the XPS pattern of In 3d in VO-rich and VO-poor CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. However, the intensity values of the In 3d spectra of VO-rich samples were more as compared to those of VO-poor CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. This factor had significantly affected the hydrogen evolution reaction during ERC which is discussed in a later section. In the Cu 2p XPS spectra (Fig. 3b), the peaks at 953.8 ± 0.2 eV and 933.8 ± 0.2 eV correspond to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively, and the strong satellite peak leads to the formation of CuO.36 The O 1s XPS spectra (Fig. 3c and d) displayed a peak at 529.9 ± 0.2 eV that corresponded to lattice oxygen (OL) enclosed by either copper or indium, and the highest binding energy peak at 532.2 ± 0.2 eV was related to the near-surface oxygen (ON) atom or OH group attached or H2O in the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite.36,37 The peak arising at 531.1 ± 0.2 eV (OV) was attributed to VO defects in CuO of CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites.36 There was no significant shift in peak positions for both 10% VO-rich and VO-poor nanocomposites. The presence of relative VO concentrations in both VO-rich and VO-poor nanocomposites was analyzed by calculating their relative peak area ratio of the oxygen vacancy peak (OV) using the relation OV/(OL + OV + ON). Fig. S7† shows that the relative peak area for the O-vacancy peak in the VO-rich nanocomposite was 35.9%, while for the VO-poor CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite, it was 20.7%. Thus, the VO-rich nanocomposite had a relatively higher VO concentration in comparison to the VO-poor CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite.

We conducted electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements to gain further insight into the number of defects and the oxidation state of the dopant ion in the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. The cw EPR spectra of the 5%, 10% and 15% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites shown in Fig. 4a–c, respectively, display an intense peak at 3200 G (g value of ∼2.15) that could arise due to either VO or Cu2+ defects in each sample.38 There was no shift in the g value of the EPR signal in VO-rich and VO-poor nanocomposites. However, there was an increase in the intensity of the signal that was accompanied by line broadening in VO-rich CuO/In2O3 in comparison with the analogous VO-poor sample. The broadening of the EPR signal was due to spin–spin coupling between the VO defects in VO-rich CuO/In2O3. Additionally, the EPR spectra also revealed that the 10% VO-rich CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite had the highest concentration of defects amongst all of the nanocomposites. This was in agreement with the PL (Fig. S5†) and XPS (Fig. 3) observations. In comparison with the nanocomposites, the EPR spectrum of CuO displayed a negligible concentration of VO defects (Fig. 4d). It is important to note that the signals arising from the Cu2+ and VO defects overlap in the g ∼2 region of the EPR spectra which makes it difficult to distinguish between their respective contributions.

We conducted cryogenic EPR measurements on an inorganic Cu(II) model complex, Cu2+(Phen)2(H2O)(NO3)2, to determine the dominant defects in the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite, which indicated that the microwave power saturation behaviors of the Cu2+ and VO signals are indeed very different. As shown in Fig. S8a–d,† the microwave power saturation curves of Cu2+(Phen)2(H2O)(NO3)2 at 20 K and 7 K confirm that Cu2+ EPR signals saturate at 4 mW and 1 mW, respectively. This confirmed that the EPR spectra of the 5%, 10% and 15% CuO/In2O3 that are shown in Fig. 4a–c were dominated by the spectral contribution of the VO defects in all of the nanocomposites.
The pore size and surface area of the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites and CuO nanorods were determined by their N2 adsorption and desorption behavior at 77 K (Fig. S9†). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm was classified as a type IV isotherm with hysteresis, where the desorption energy was higher than the adsorption energy.39 The CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites that were synthesized in argon exhibited larger hysteresis and higher N2 adsorption capacity at relatively higher pressures, indicating a larger surface area in comparison with the analogous CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites that were synthesized in air. The insets of Fig. S9† represent the slope of the respective N2 adsorption and desorption which was used to calculate the surface area of the electrocatalyst. The BET surface area, mean pore diameter and pore volume for all of the nanocomposites are shown in Table S2.† The VO-rich nanocomposites display a higher surface area as compared to the VO-poor analogs (Table S2†). Moreover, the VO-rich 10% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite exhibits the highest surface area amongst all the samples.
3.2. Electrochemical measurements for ERC on electrocatalysts
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of bare CuO nanorods and all of the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites were conducted in N2 saturated and CO2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solutions. The 10th CV cycles of all the electrocatalysts are shown in Fig. 5. Multiple cycling led to the reduction/oxidation along with the dissolution/re-deposition of the electrocatalyst that aided in achieving a steady state,40 which was evidenced by the superimposable CV scans as shown in Fig. S10.† During the negative scan from 0.5 V to −1.25 V, some differences in the reduction current densities of the two solutions can be seen for all the electrocatalysts (Fig. 5a, b and d). This difference in current densities was maximized for the VO-rich 10% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite (Fig. 5c), which indicates that it should have the lowest FE towards the HER and the highest FE towards the ERC, suggesting that the presence of VO defects favors the ERC.

The reduction peak observed in the region from −0.5 V to 0.0 V for all of the electrocatalysts in both N2 and CO2 saturated solutions corresponds to the copper oxide reduction (Fig. 5a). A minor shift in the reduction peak was observed with the increased indium concentration in the nanocomposites, which was due to a change in the electronic properties with the addition of indium. Moreover, a shift in this peak was also observed in N2 and CO2 saturated environments, which could be attributed to the difference in the pH of the N2 and CO2 saturated solutions. The corresponding re-oxidation peak for Cu was observed at around 1.0 V. However; there were no distinct reduction/oxidation peaks for indium (Fig. S11†). The consistency of the CV measurements on the electrocatalysts described earlier was independently confirmed by chronoamperometry, as shown in Fig. S12.†
The electrocatalytic performance of all the electrocatalysts towards the ERC was observed for one hour in the potential range of −0.4 V to −1.4 V vs. RHE. During the ERC, current and faradaic efficiencies remained constant, indicating the stable nature of the electrocatalyst. Moreover, CO was formed as the sole ERC product along with H2. The selectivity of the electrocatalysts towards the HER and ERC products are presented in terms of the faradaic efficiency of H2 (FEH) and CO (FECO) as a function of the applied potential (Fig. 6). All of the electrocatalysts displayed a similar behavior with a bell-shaped profile for FECO as the potential was changed from −0.4 to −1.2 V. Among all the electrocatalysts, bare CuO nanorods synthesized in both the environments (air and argon) had the minimum FECO (∼16.6%) and the highest HER (Fig. 6a1 and a2). The CuO nanorods synthesized in argon contained a higher concentration of VCu defects in comparison with those synthesized in the air environment as seen in their PL spectra (Fig. 2d). However, the FECO was found to be similar for both CuO nanorod electrocatalysts. This suggests that the concentration of VCu sites in CuO did not play a significant role in the enhancement of FECO. As discussed earlier, in the Cu–In system, indium covers most of the kink sites of Cu (which are HER active).25 Moreover, a higher potential is required for the adsorption of hydrogen on indium, which suppresses the HER.24 Thus, the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite formed by the addition of indium into Cu led to the suppression of the parasitic parallel reaction, the HER (Fig. 6b1–d2).

Additionally, the XPS spectra (Fig. 3a) revealed that a higher amount of indium was present on the surface (covering the HER sites) of VO-rich as compared to VO-poor CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites. Thus, VO-rich catalysts exhibit lower HER activity as compared to VO-poor CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites (Fig. 6b1–d2). Among all VO-poor CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites, the 10% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite displayed a maximum FECO of ∼63% at −0.645 V vs. RHE. Moreover, FECO was approximately similar with an increase in the indium concentration from 5% to 15% in the nanocomposites (Fig. 6). As mentioned earlier, the concentration of VO defects was higher in the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites that were synthesized in argon (Fig. 2).
Thus, the electrocatalysts synthesized in argon had higher FECO, with the VO-rich 10% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite displaying the highest FECO of ∼85% at −0.895 V vs. RHE. However, it is interesting that minimal variation was observed for FECO upon varying the indium oxide concentration from 5% to 15% in electrocatalysts synthesized in either air or argon environment. In the case of pure In2O3, the maximum FECO observed was only 23.5% at −0.645 V vs. RHE (Table S3†), whereas at −0.895 V, FECO was 8.9% but FEH was only 34.4%, indicating that some liquid products were forming. In the reported literature, formates were obtained by electrochemical reduction of CO2 on indium oxide.32 This means that the sole role of indium in the nanocomposite was to suppress the HER. This means that VO defects were the primary contributors to the increase in the FECO during the ERC.
Moreover, post reaction analysis revealed that copper indium oxide was reduced to its metallic state as shown in Fig. S13.† This reduction occurs during the initial few minutes of the ERC.8,41 The morphology of VO-rich and VO-poor CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites did not change after the reaction, indicating that no segregation has occurred (Fig. S14†). PL spectra confirm the presence of defects in VO-rich and VO-poor nanocomposites after the CO2 reduction reaction (Fig. S15†). Thus, the VO defects were stable in both VO-rich and VO-poor CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites (Fig. S15†). Hence, under the applied potential, VO defects were not completely removed. Thus, the concentration of VO defects in CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites is a dominant factor in the enhancement of FECO, while the indium oxide content (5%, 10% and 15%) does not have a significant influence on the enhancement of the ERC. Thus, it can be concluded that the presence of higher concentrations of VO defects enhances the ERC and improves the FECO by modifying the charge transport and surface properties of catalyst.
3.3. DFT modeling
The effect of introducing oxygen vacancy defects to the electronic and geometric structure of the CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites was studied by DFT.29–31 Initially, we induced different point defects, namely, single O-vacancy, single Cu-vacancy and simultaneous Cu and O vacancies in the Cu17In3O15 cluster and adsorbed a *COOH group along with one H+ ion at various sites, viz. Cu, In, O and VO to determine the favorable sites for reduction of the COOH group to CO according to the reaction: *COOH + H+ + e− → * + CO + H2O.23,26,27
We found that among the various sites, the reduction of the COOH group was possible only on sites proximal to the O-vacancy defects. Additionally, the bare Cu17In3O15 and the cluster with VCu defects did not catalyze the formation of CO. Thus, we may infer that the catalytic activity of the nanocomposites is mainly due to the presence of the VO defects in the system. It is important to note that the reduction of CO2 to CO takes place in two steps. In the first step, CO2 adsorbed on the surface of the nanocomposite reacts with H+ ions to yield *COOH. Following which, *COOH reacts with a second H+ ion to produce CO and H2O. The first step is endothermic while the second one is exothermic. The enthalpy of the first step determines the ease with which the reduction reaction takes place in a particular configuration. In the second step, protons are transferred to the system and *COOH reacts with H+ to yield CO with the formation of H2O and the release of energy.
In order to confirm the role of the VO defects in the catalytic activity of the nanocomposite, we calculated the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the two-step reduction process of CO2 on the cluster with one and two VO defects. Fig. 7 shows the two-step mechanism of the reduction process of CO2 on the Cu17In3O15 composite having one and two VO defects. We find that in case of a single VO defect, the ΔG of first step was 0.48 eV, while in the presence of two VO defects, it was 0.31 eV. Hence, we conclude that an increase in the concentration of VO defects in the system leads to a decrease in the activation barrier that is required for the reduction of CO2 to CO. This could be because of the presence of VO defects that provide additional electrons to the system, which facilitates the reduction of CO2 to COOH. In addition to this, energy evolved during the second step was more in case of two VO defects in comparison to one VO defect in the system. Thus, the concentration of the VO defects at an optimum level favors the ERC. Thus, the number of oxygen vacancy defects that are required depends upon the number of electrons that are needed for the completion of the ERC.

4. Conclusion
In summary, oxygen vacancies engineered in non-noble metal oxide catalysts were a proficient and cost-effective approach for enhancement of selective ERC. The controlled concentrations of oxygen vacancy defects were induced in CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites by a novel chemical synthetic route for the efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. PL, XPS and EPR measurements revealed that the samples synthesized in an argon environment contain higher concentrations of VO defects as compared to those synthesized in air. The VO-rich 10% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite exhibited the maximum FECO of ∼85% at −0.895 V vs. RHE, while the VO-poor 10% CuO/In2O3 nanocomposite showed a maximum FECO of ∼63% at −0.645 V. The BET results indicated that the VO-rich samples possess a higher surface area than the VO-poor samples, which demonstrated that the former samples contained more active sites for CO2 adsorption. Finally, DFT calculations revealed that the activation barrier decreased from 0.48 eV to 0.31 eV as the concentration of VO increased in the composite system for completion of the ERC. Thus, we have successfully demonstrated that VO defects in highly active, stable, and cost-effective CuO/In2O3 nanocomposites is a dominant factor for selective and efficient ERC of CO2 to CO.
