, Accepted 11th July 2013First published on 15th July 2013AbstractA new method for enhancing the upconversion (UC) emission of rare-earth doped nanoparticles is reported, in which Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles are deposited on to the surface of photonic crystal (PC) films. The UC emission of the Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles on the PC surface was notably enhanced when the UC emission bands of the Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles were within the range of the photonic band gap of the PCs, indicating that the PCs were efficient and selective reflection mirrors. The results show that PCs may have potential applications in UC optoelectronics and lighting devices.
1 Introduction
Rare earth ion doped materials exhibiting upconversion (UC) luminescence, from near infrared radiation to visible (or near infrared) light, have received much attention for use in a variety of applications such as lasers, solar cells, next-generation lighting, three-dimensional displays, and so on.1–3 Recently, much effort has been devoted to preparing UC nanoparticles doped with rare earth ions, because they provide a new alternative for biological labeling.4–9 In contrast to other biological fluorescent materials such as organic dyes and quantum dots, UC nanoparticles doped with rare earths have many advantages such as weak background fluorescence and a wide detection range, plus they cause less photo-damage to biological tissues. Unfortunately, UC nanoparticles generally suffer from low emission efficiency due to structural defects and dipole forbidden transitions. Meanwhile, the small absorption cross sections of UC nanoparticles also limit their excitation efficiency. Therefore, finding methods to improve the UC emission intensity is very important for the application of UC nanoparticles. At present, many methods have been developed to enhance the emission intensity of UC nanocrystals. For example, placing metal nanoparticles in close proximity to the surface of UC nanocrystals has been extensively used for this purpose, because having metal nanoparticles in close proximity to UC materials can cause an enhancement of UC luminescence by influencing both the absorption of the excitation light and the emission of the rare earth ions.10–14 Very recently, several papers have reported that UC emission can be enhanced by using photonic crystals.15–17 A decrease in the UC emission of dopants, the range of their band gap, as well as an obvious enhancement at the band gap edge have been obtained in photonic crystals.15 Meanwhile, short wavelength UC emission from the upper state can be notably enhanced due to an inhibition of spontaneous UC emission from the intermediate excited state in inverse opals.16 In another report, an enhancement of UC emission was realized by enhancement of the energy transfer in inverse opals.17 Despite the fact that an enhancement in UC emission has been observed in previous works, other interesting phenomena have not been demonstrated in UC photonic crystals. For instance, there have been no experiments reported on the enhancement of UC emission using the effective Bragg reflection of photonic crystals. Herein, we report the enhancement of the UC emission of Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles deposited on to the surface of a photonic crystal film.
2 Experimental section
Sample preparation
Face-centered cubic opal photonic crystal (PC) films, with differing band gaps, on glass substrates were fabricated by a self-assembly technique using commercially available suspensions of polystyrene microspheres (PS) with diameters of 205, 230, 275, 335 and 380 nm. High purity (99.99%) Y2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3 and Er2O3, and analytical reagent grade trisodium citrate, NaF and NH4F were used as raw materials. All chemicals were used directly without further purification. RE(NO3)3 (RE = Y, Yb, Er, Tm) compounds were prepared by dissolving the corresponding RE2O3 compound in hot HNO3 solution. The Yb (20 mol%)/Er (2 mol%) or Yb (20 mol%)/Tm (1 mol%) co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles were prepared via a hydrothermal method. Initially, either Yb(NO3)3 and Er(NO3)3 or Yb(NO3)3 and Tm(NO3)3 were dissolved in a mixed solution of ethanol and trisodium citrate. NaF and NH4F were dissolved in hot water, then the two solutions were mixed together. After vigorous stirring for 30 min, the as-obtained mixed solution was transferred into a Teflon bottle held in a stainless steel autoclave, then sealed and kept at 200 °C for 50 h. After the solution was cooled naturally, the nanoparticles were precipitated from the solution and washed with ethanol and deionized water three times in sequence. The washed nanoparticles were dispersed in ethanol, and then deposited on to the surface of a PC film using a chemical bath technique.
Measurements
The UC emission measurements of the samples were carried out using a F-7000 spectrophotometer under 980 nm excitation. Transmittance spectra were obtained with a HITACHIU-4100 spectrophotometer. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data of the NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ nanoparticles were obtained using a D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at a wavelength of 1.5406 Å. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken using a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The SEM images of the opal films were obtained with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (QUANTA200), after sputtering the samples with a thin layer of gold.
3 Results and discussion
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 1. The positions and relative intensities of all of the diffraction peaks in both the Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles are all in good agreement with the standard pattern of cubic phase NaYF4 (JCPDS no. 77-2042), indicating that a single cubic phase of NaYF4 was obtained with the various dopants. This implies that a dopant concentration of up to 22% does not change the crystal structure of NaYF4, when Y3+ ions in the NaYF4 host are substituted with other Ln3+ ions (Er3+, Tm3+, Yb3+). The average crystallite size of the nanocrystals was calculated according to the Scherrer equation:18 
D = kλ/βcosθ
(1)where K is a constant that depends on the particle shape (K = 0.89 was assumed, which corresponds to spherical crystallites), D represents the crystallite size, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray produced by the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), β is the half width of the diffraction peak, and θ is the Bragg angle of the diffraction peak. According to eqn (1) above and using the half width of the main diffraction peak at 28° in Fig. 1, the average size of the Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles was calculated to be about 59 and 87 nm, respectively.

The TEM images provide direct information about the sizes and typical shapes of the as-synthesized NaYF4 nanoparticles. Fig. 2(a) and (b) show TEM images of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ nanoparticles, respectively. It can be seen that the synthesized nanoparticles appear irregular in shape and monodisperse. The average diameter of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ nanoparticles is around 65 and 80 nm, respectively, which are in good agreement with the XRD calculated results. In the high-resolution TEM images, the lattice fringes of the individual nanoparticles are clearly distinguishable, indicating that the prepared nanoparticles are highly crystalline, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The crystallinity of the synthesized nanoparticles was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1. The distances between the lattice fringes of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanoparticles were measured to be about 0.32 nm, which corresponds to the spacing of the (111) lattice planes of cubic NaYF4.

Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of opal films constructed with single microspheres 205, 230, 275, 335 and 380 nm in diameter. The packed microspheres form into a highly ordered face centered cubic (fcc) structure with the (111) plane parallel to the surface of the glass substrate. The opal films made of 205, 230, 275, 335 and 380 nm microspheres were denoted as PC-I, PC-II, PC-III, PC-IV and RS, respectively. Transmittance spectra of the opal films are recorded from their (111) plane. Fig. 4(a) shows the transmittance spectra obtained from the opal films along the (111) plane. The band gap positions of PC-I, PC-II, PC-III, PC-IV and RS are 480, 550, 645, 800 and 890 nm, respectively. Theoretically, the photonic band gap of opals can be calculated using the modified form of Bragg's law:19λ = 1.633D(n2eff − sin2θ)1/2neff2 = n2PSfPS + nair2(1 − fPS)where λ, D, θ and fPS denote the position of the photonic bandgap, the diameter of the microsphere, the angle between the incident light and the normal line of the plane and the volume fraction of the microspheres, respectively. neff, nair (1) and nPS (1.59)20 represent refractive indices of the opals, air and microspheres, respectively. The volume fraction of the microspheres is 74% for the opal. Based on the microsphere diameter, the calculated photonic band gap positions are 488, 548, 655, 798 and 905 nm for PC-I, PC-II, PC-III, PC-IV, and RS, respectively.

To investigate the influence of the photonic band gap on the UC emission properties of nanoparticles, the NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ nanoparticles were deposited on the surfaces of PC-II, PC-III and RS. While NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ nanoparticles was deposited on the surfaces of PC-I, PC-IV and RS. The SEM images of the NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ nanoparticles decorated on the 230 nm opal template surfaces are shown in Fig. 3(f). The homogeneous distribution of the NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ nanoparticles was observed on the inverse opal surface. Transmittance spectra of the opals after deposition of nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 4(b). The results show that the photonic band gaps still remained with no change after nanoparticles were deposited on the PC film surfaces.
The UC emission spectra of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ on the surface of PC-II, PC-III and RS are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). UC emission bands from Er3+ were observed, located at 525 (2H11/2 → 4I15/2), 546 (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and 659 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2). In the UC emission process, the UC emission intensity (Iup) is proportional to the nth power of the pump power (P) as Iup ∝ Pn, where n is the number of absorbed infrared photons required for the emission of one visible photon. The pump power dependence of the visible emission bands was measured in the reference sample. A plot of logarithm Iup versus logarithm Pn yields a straight line of slope n. Fig. 6(a) shows the log–log plot of the emission intensity as a function of the excitation power for NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+. The values of n for the 525 (2H11/2 → 4I15/2), 546 (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and 659 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) transitions of the Er3+ ions are close to 2, indicating that the green and red emissions of Er3+ originate from a two-photon population process. The mechanisms of the UC emissions are shown in Fig. 7. The Er3+ ion is excited to the 4I11/2 state from the ground 4I15/2 state by an energy transfer (ET) between Yb3+ and Er3+ and/or ground state absorption (GSA). The excited state electrons at the 4I11/2 level can then be promoted to the 4F7/2 state, by excited state absorption (ESA) and/or ET. Next, the electrons at the 4F7/2 level relax nonradiatively to the nearby 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels. The electrons at 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 can undergo a radiative transition to the ground state 4I15/2, resulting in emissions of 525 and 546 nm, respectively. For the 659 nm red emission, the electrons in the excited state at the 4I11/2 level relax nonradiatively to the nearby 4I13/2 level, then the electrons at the 4I13/2 level can be excited to the 4F9/2 level by ESA and/or ET. The red emission occurs due to the transition of electrons from the 4F9/2 to the 4I15/2 level. On the other hand, some of the electrons in the 4S3/2 level can further relax and populate the 4F9/2 level, leading to a red UC emission from the 4F9/2 to 4I15/2 transition. The UC luminescence properties and mechanisms of Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped materials have been extensively reported.21,22 For example, Zhou et al. reported a detailed study of the UC luminescence of Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped Y2O3, in which UC emission bands at 525 nm, 560 nm (green), and 660 nm (red) were observed.21 Studies indicate that two-photon processes are responsible for the red and green UC luminescence. The UC emission mechanism is consistent with our present investigations. Fig. 6(b) shows the log–log plots of the emission intensity as a function of excitation power for NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+. The values of n for the 476 nm (1G4 → 3H6) and 806 nm (3H4 → 3H6) transitions of Tm3+ were determined to be 3.2 and 2.1, respectively. This indicates that the blue and near infrared UC emissions of Tm3+ are due to a three- and two-photon population process, respectively. For the emission mechanisms of Tm3+, energy transfer (ET) is responsible for its UC emission, because the Tm3+ ions are unable to absorb the incident photons. Electrons in the ground state of the Tm3+ ions are promoted to the 3H5 excited state by ET. The excited state electrons at the 3H5 level undergo nonradiative relaxation, occupying the nearby 3F4 level. Tm3+ ions in the 3F4 excited state are then promoted to the 3F2 level by the same ET, then the Tm3+ ions in the 3F2 level decay through a nonradiative transition to the 3H4 level. A radiative transition from the 3H4 to 3H6 level results in the observed 806 nm UC emission. In addition, some of the electrons in the 3H4 level can be further excited to the 1G4 level by the ET, and the 476 nm UC emission arises from a 1G4 → 3H6 transition. In general, the blue three-photon and near infrared two-photon UC emissions have been reported for Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped materials,23 which is consistent with our present results.

As shown in Fig. 5(a), the Er3+ transition at 525 and 546 nm is affected due to the band gap of the PC-II, which ranges from approximately 500 to 600 nm. When the UC emission intensity of the two emission spectra shown in Fig. 5(a) is normalized at 650 nm, the UC emission intensities of the bands at 525 and 546 nm are enhanced. For PC-III, with a band gap at 655 nm, the 659 nm UC emission of Er3+ is enhanced in intensity when normalized at 545 nm, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The UC emission spectra of NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+ on the surface of PC-I, PC-IV and RS are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). The 476 and 806 nm UC emission can be attributed to the 1G4 → 3H6 and 3H4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+, respectively. Fig. 5(c) and (d) demonstrate a similar photonic band gap effect for Tm3+ UC emission in PC-I and PC-IV. The UC emission bands from the 1G4 → 3H6 and 3H4 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+ on the surface of PC-I and PC-IV have been obviously enhanced, when the UC emission bands of Tm3+ are in the range of the photonic band gaps of the photonic crystals.
In photonic crystals, the UC emission intensity is related to the photonic band gap effect and the thickness of the opal template, etc. It is well known that a photonic crystal can strongly modify spontaneous emission, when the emitter is embedded in the photonic crystal. By manipulation of the photonic density of states, the photonic crystals can cause an enhancement of spontaneous emission near the band edge or an inhibition of the spontaneous emission in the band gap region. Hyoung Sun Yoo et al. reported the phenomenon of the luminescence enhancement of active centers embedded in three-dimensional ordered or disordered opal templates.24 In their study, the photonic band gaps were located far from the emission bands of the active centers. Therefore, the photonic band gaps did not affect the emission intensity of the embedded active centers, and the effective excitation was considered to be the factor responsible for the enhancement of the emission intensity. In their work, the emission intensity of the photonic crystals film increased 2.8 fold, due to the excitation enhancement in contrast to a plain film prepared without photonic crystals.24 The luminescence enhancement of the active centers embedded in the photonic crystals depends on their thickness. Here, we have investigated the influence of the thickness of the photonic crystals on the UC emission. PC-II was prepared in various thicknesses, with the thickness controlled by changing the volume fraction of the PS microspheres used (0.20, 0.35, 0.5 and 0.65%). The thickness of PC-II was measured using SEM, as shown in the ESI.† The thicknesses of the four kinds of PC-II were 7.5 μm (denoted as PC-a), 18.5 μm (denoted as PC-b), 28.0 μm (denoted as PC-c) and 38.0 μm (denoted as PC-d). The UC emission spectra of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ on the surface of PC-a, PC-b, PC-c and PC-d are shown in the ESI.† It can be clearly observed that the UC emission intensity of NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ is not significantly changed on the surface photonic crystals with different thicknesses. Therefore, we consider that the photonic band gap effects are responsible for the difference in the UC emission intensity of Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles coated on to the surface of the photonic crystal samples.
In the present work, Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles were deposited on to the surface of photonic crystal films. There are two factors responsible for the enhancement of the UC emission. The first is the Bragg reflection of the photonic crystal surface. Fig. 8 shows the UC emission enhancement mechanism related to the Bragg reflection of the photonic crystals. The photonic band gap inhibits the propagation of light within a particular wavelength range that satisfies the Bragg condition. When the UC emission light produced by the nanoparticles overlaps with the photonic band gap, the light is unable to travel through the photonic crystals and is effectively reflected in the direction of the band gap. The part of the light that was reflected can be collected, which results in the enhancement of the UC emission, as shown in Fig. 8(a). In contrast, the UC emission light from the nanoparticles on the surface of RS transmits through the photonic crystal film and can’t be collected when the UC emission is out of the range of the photonic band gap, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Therefore, the UC emission enhancement can be attributed to the effective and selective reflection of the photonic crystal surface. The other reason is the presence of surface states at the surface of the photonic crystal film. The photonic density of states is increased by surface states that exist in the photonic band gap, leading to an enhancement of the upconversion emission. The influence of surface states on the spontaneous emission has been reported in previous work. Song et al. found that the spontaneous emission of active centers at the surface of photonic crystals can be enhanced when the excitation light overlapped with the photonic band gap, which was attributed to the enhancement of the excitation field because of its coupling with the photonic band gap.25 Here, we demonstrate experimentally that the UC emission of Yb3+/Er3+ or Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles at the surface of photonic crystals can be enhanced due to the coupling between the UC emission light and surface states. In previous works, various methods have been explored to improve the efficiency of UC nanoparticles, such as changing the host lattice and doping ions of the UC nanoparticles, designing core–shell structures and organic–inorganic composites, using the surface plasmon induced field enhancement of noble metal nanoparticles, etc.26–29 Additionally, luminescence enhancement has been realized using photonic crystals to improve the excitation efficiency.25 Although the above mentioned methods are effective for luminescence enhancement, the experimental processes involved are relatively complicated. Here, we have proposed a simple, effective and practical method to enhance the UC emission of nanoparticles in the solid state, which depends on the effective reflection of a Bragg mirror of photonic crystals and coupling between the UC emission light and surface states.

4 Conclusions
Yb3+/Tm3+ or Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles were prepared via a hydrothermal method. The nanoparticles were deposited on to the surface of photonic crystal films and their UC emission was investigated. The UC emission of the nanoparticles deposited on to the surface of the PCs was notably enhanced, when the UC emission wavelength overlapped with the photonic band gap of the selected photonic crystals, due to the efficient and selective Bragg reflection of the photonic crystals. This enhancement in the photonic crystals could be extended to other light-emitting materials. Application of this strategy could lead to a new generation of UC lighting devices.
