    , Accepted 18th July 2017First published on 18th July 2017AbstractThe optimization of multiple interfaces in hematite (α-Fe2O3) based composites for photoelectrochemical water splitting to facilitate charge transport in the bulk is of paramount importance to obtain enhanced solar-to-fuel efficiency. Herein, we report the fabrication of ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH multi-layer nanowires and a series of systematic experiments designed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the interfacial coupling effect of the quaternary hematite composite. The hierarchical ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH nanowires display photocurrents that are more than an order of magnitude greater than those of pristine Fe2O3 nanowires (from 0.205 mA cm−2 to 2.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and 1 Sun), and higher than those of most of the recently reported state-of-the-art hematite composites. Structural, compositional and electrochemical investigations disclose that the surface states (SS) are finely regulated via the atomic addition of an Fe2TiO5 layer and FeNiOOH nanodots, while the upgrading of back contact conductivity and charge donor densities originate from the epitaxial relationship and enhanced Sn doping contributed from the ITO underlayer. We attribute the superior water oxidation performance to the interfacial coupling effect of the ITO underlayer (Sn doping and back contact conductivity promoter), the atomic level Fe2TiO5 coating (Ti doping, surface state density and energy level modulation) and the FeNiOOH nanodot electrocatalyst (regulating surface state energy level). Our work suggests an effective pathway for rational designing of highly active and cost-effective integrated photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Broader context
Conversion of solar energy to hydrogen energy using photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the key technologies to tackle serious energy and environmental problems. Hematite is a promising candidate for PEC photoanodes as its bandgap is well-suited for absorption of the solar spectrum. However, issues like poor charge transport, surface charge recombination, and slow charge transfer kinetics have limited its practical application. In light of this, an increasing number of investigations have focused on hematite heterostructures that incorporate a second material to tackle some of the inherent material limitations. While individual components of these heterostructured materials have been studied independently, there remains a wealth of untapped knowledge concerning the integration strategy. Herein we report the design and fabrication of ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH multilayer nanowires which display greatly enhanced PEC performance. By systematically comparing the pristine and representative integrated electrodes, we shed light on the working mechanism of the integrated heterojunction photoanodes. The function of each component in the integrated photoanodes has been identified, as well as the ways in which they couple together to regulate the donor density and surface state density. Additionally, the investigation of the charge transfer kinetics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface highlights the role of the surface state density/donor density ratio in determining the charge transfer efficiency. This report presents a more complete and clear picture with which to understand the integrated photoanodes for PEC water splitting.

1. Introduction
Hematite based photoanodes have been intensively investigated on account of several promising properties which make them a potential candidate as a water splitting photoanode. Hematite materials are low cost, and environmentally friendly owing to their high natural abundance. More importantly, in terms of its applications in PEC, hematite possesses high photo-chemical stability, a narrow bandgap (1.9–2.2 eV), and a theoretical maximum solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 15.4%, corresponding to 12.5 mA cm−2 at Air–Mass 1.5 Global solar illumination, which exceeds the STH benchmark efficiency of 10% required for practical applications.1,2 However, its relatively low absorption coefficient, short excited-state lifetime (10−6 s),3,4 poor oxygen evolution reaction kinetics, short hole diffusion length, and poor electrical conductivity lead to multiple electron–hole recombination pathways occurring in the bulk, interfaces, and surfaces and significantly limit the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of hematite.2 Since rapid charge transport and transfer between the back substrate, photoactive semiconductor, catalyst and electrolyte is necessary for efficient STH performance, the electronic and structural properties of back substrate/semiconductor/catalyst/electrolyte interfaces play a vital role in PEC performance.5–10 The electron–hole recombination at the interface of the back substrate and hematite is critical for electron transport from bulk hematite to the current collector and thus affects the overall PEC photocurrent response.2,9,11–14 For instance, Zheng et al. reported an integrated hematite, TiOx and FeOOH photoanode and obtained a photocurrent of around 1.5 mA cm−2, which is still much lower than the theoretical value (12.5 mA cm−2) of hematite.12 Even though this design simultaneously reduces charge recombination in the bulk and surface of hematite, the obtained photocurrent response suffers from intensive back electron–hole recombination between hematite nanowires and the FTO substrate. This phenomenon is likely derived from the Sn loss in the FTO substrate during the high temperature (1000 °C) sintering treatment which leads to poor electron conductivity in the back contact.13,14 Therefore, it is essential to optimize the back interface of the FTO substrate and hematite. This may be accomplished by introducing a conductive buffer layer, such as an ITO underlayer between hematite and the FTO substrate. Moreover, the energetic and electronic structures of hematite can be tuned by forming an advantageous heterojunction interface, which can reduce the charge recombination at the semiconductor junction interface and thus facilitates hole transport to the electrolyte for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).10,12 Recently, we prepared a mesoporous hematite–Fe2TiO5 heterojunction film, with an optimized 10% TiO2 doping, which possessed a 15-fold photocurrent increment (up to 1.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE).10 Furthermore, iron–nickel oxide hydroxides (FeNiOOH) have attracted widespread attention as oxygen evolution catalysts (OEC) due to their unique structure and good OER activity in alkaline medium, whose OER activity can be adjusted according to film thickness.15–17 Coupling FeNiOOH OECs on hematite photoanodes is supposed to effectively suppress the electron–hole pair recombination and accelerate reaction kinetics at the photoactive semiconductor/electrolyte interface (SEI).18,19 In light of this, it is therefore of high interest to design an integrated quaternary multilayer photoanode with a high electrical conductive underlayer (ITO layer, to protect against Sn loss from the FTO substrate), an advantageous heterojunction (Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5),10 and an efficient OEC layer (FeNiOOH) to simultaneously reduce the interfacial, bulk and surface charge recombination as well as to enhance its PEC performance.
On the other hand, the kinetic process of water oxidation at the SEI10,20–22 and the identification of the active sites23–25 for water splitting have drawn the attention of many researchers. Peter et al. employed photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) for the kinetic analysis of the multistep water oxidation reaction and proposed that the OER in hematite involves high-valent iron states formed at the surface.20 Water oxidation on the hematite surface is a 4-electron process, which occurs following eqn (1–4), with the holes being ‘stored’ in the Fe(IV) and Fe(V) intermediate states.20 hν→ h+ + e−(1) Fe(III) + h+ → Fe(IV)surf(2) Fe(IV)surf + h+ → Fe(V)surf(3) 2Fe(V)surf + 2H2O → 2Fe(III)surf + O2 + 4H+(4)Hamann et al. illustrated a general physical model and systematically discussed the suitable equivalent circuit for illustrating the EIS data for the hematite electrode, including surface states (SS) at the SEI where holes accumulate.21 Most recently,. Hamann et al. investigated the water-oxidation reaction on hematite via in situ infrared spectroscopy; and the existence of an FeIVO group (an intermediate in the PEC water oxidation reaction) was directly observed, which is the origin of the presence of hematite surface states.26 Moreover, our previous investigation proposed a charge transfer mechanism through hole trapping at the surface state and its isoenergetic transfer to water for a hematite/Fe2TiO5 composite system and demonstrated that the surface state density of hematite can be tuned by controlling the amount of TiO2.10 In addition, it is well established that SS exist due to the termination of lattice periodicity at the species' surface, and the unpaired electrons in the dangling bonds of surface atoms interact with each other forming an electronic state with a narrow energy band (mid band) at the semiconductor band gap.27,28 In this regard, we propose that, by integrating the hematite nanowires with an ITO underlayer, and Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH coating layers step-wise, the SS would be finely regulated because the chemical environment of FeIVO present at the SEI will vary slightly during the water oxidation process.29–32
2. Results
Based on the wealth of reported band gap information for In2O3, hematite, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH,10,33 a type II band alignment composed of multiple ITO/hematite/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH interfaces can be constructed via gradual incorporation of ITO, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH layers in hematite nanowires.27,34 As illustrated in Scheme 1, upon light illumination, the pristine Fe2O3 electrode suffers from a large recombination rate that yields a low photo-current, as holes are sluggishly transferred to water. For the ITO/Fe2O3 electrode, since both In2O3 and hematite are n-type semiconductors with different work functions, a heterojunction with a potential barrier will form at their interface. In2O3 (main ingredient of ITO) has a lower work function compared to hematite, thus the electrons in the Fermi level (Ef) of In2O3 will migrate to the Ef of Fe2O3 until their Ef equalize.33 At the equilibrium state, an electron depletion layer (marked as double layer charge between hematite and In2O3) will be generated at the heterojunction interface and thus a built-in electron field will be formed, which will accelerate the separation of photo-generated charge carriers and reduce the recombination rate and thus result in enhanced photocurrent.27,35 Since Fe2TiO5 and hematite's relative conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge positions enable a cascade of charge migration, holes are transferred from Fe2O3 to Fe2TiO5 and conversely electrons are transferred from Fe2TiO5 to Fe2O3 in a conveyor belt fashion.10 Upon coating of ultrathin Fe2TiO5 onto ITO/Fe2O3 nanowires, the hematite nanowires can accommodate the ultrathin pseudobrookite phase shell at the surface, forming the advantageous Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 heterojunction. The heterojunctions in the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode reduce the grain boundary recombination by preventing charge accumulation in the nanowires and at the interfaces, and thus are expected to further enhance the photocurrent response. Finally, there is consensus that coupling FeNiOOH on photoanodes effectively suppresses the charge recombination and accelerates reaction kinetics at the SEI.36–42 The deposition of FeNiOOH onto the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 nanowires should further increase the surface work function, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the barrier height and built-in electric field for the migration of photogenerated holes to the electrode surface.36–38 With this in mind, an ITO/hematite/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH heterojunction nanowire was designed and fabricated via a combination of sputtering, hydrothermal, ALD and photo-electrochemical deposition techniques, as displayed in Fig. 2 (top).

2.1 XPS spectrum
The surface electronic states and composition of each electrode were analysed by XPS and all binding energies were corrected for sample charging effects regarding the C 1s line at 284.6 eV. Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†) present the Sn 3d, O 1s, Fe 2p, In 3d, Ti 2p and Ni 2p core level XPS scans at higher resolution over smaller energy windows. The Fe 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks at the binding energies of 710.39 eV and 724.00 eV confirm the presence of the Fe element in these four electrodes. Additionally, two satellite peaks of the Fe 2p main line are present at approximately 8.1–8.5 eV lower energy than the main line, indicating the presence of Fe3+ species.10,43 A positive shift of the Fe peaks after the sputtering of the ITO underlayer reflects a decrease in the electron density of the Fe2O3 due to electron transfer from Fe2O3 to the ITO layer. Conversely, a negative shift of the Fe peak is detected after the deposition of Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH layers. These shifts can be ascribed to the surface binding interaction between ITO, Fe2O3, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH, which induces an electron transfer in the integrated photoanode following the order: FeNiOOH → Fe2TiO5 → Fe2O3 → ITO as depicted in Scheme 1.44 The Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 peaks (Fig. S1, ESI†) at 494.80 and 486.26 eV with a splitting energy of 8.54 eV are consistent with reported values of Sn4+.33,45 Furthermore, the In 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 core level XPS spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI†) has two weak, broad peaks around 451.60 and 444.76 eV, in good agreement with In2O3.33 Compared with the strong intensity of the Sn 3d peaks, the relatively weak intensity of the In 2p peaks means that the formation of In3+ ions is closer to the substrate, indicating that Sn doping dominates the Fe2O3 nanowires rather than In doping. The Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks at 463.26 and 457.27 eV reveal the successfully coating of Fe2TiO5 for ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 and ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrodes.10 Coinciding with the observed shift of Fe 2p peaks, after the FeNiOOH deposition, the Ti peaks shift in the negative binding energy direction, again implying electron transfers from the FeNiOOH to the Fe2TiO5 layer. Moreover, the presence of Ni in FeNiOOH was also investigated. The weak Ni 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 core level XPS peaks located at 872.60 eV and 854.86 eV and the associated satellite peaks at 862.14 eV and 879.40 eV are observed in the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode, confirming the presence of FeNiOOH.44 The O 1s XPS spectrum of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode is composed of three peaks. The low binding energy at 529.41 eV and the higher binding energy component at 531.05 eV are attributed to the coordination of oxygen bound to iron atoms from the Fe2O3 moiety and surface absorbed OH groups, respectively.46 The shift behaviour of these two O 1s peaks of Fe2O3 is in accordance with shifts observed for the Fe 2p and Ti 2p peaks. Whereas, the 531.00 eV O1s peak can be assigned to the OOH bonding likely to the FeNiOOH species.44 The consistent shifts in the binding energy observed in the XPS data for these electrodes indicate charge transfer processes that benefit electron–hole separation, further supporting the well-constructed multiple ITO/hematite/Fe2TiO5/ FeNiOOH heterojunction with type II band alignment.

2.2 Structural characterization
The morphology and crystal phase evolution of these electrodes were monitored by SEM, EDS, XRD, TEM and STEM-EELS maps. Vertically aligned Fe2O3 nanowires were grown on an FTO or 105 nm ITO coated FTO substrate (the corresponding SEM images of these two substrates are displayed in Fig. S18, ESI†) via a previously reported hydrothermal method.47 The Fe2O3 nanowires have a diameter range of 50 to 100 nm (Fig. 2A–D). Subsequently, an ultrathin TiO2 layer was coated onto the ITO/Fe2O3 nanowires by ALD (30 cycles). The surface TiO2 was subsequently transformed into Fe2TiO5 through a post-quenching process in ambient atmosphere at 750 °C for 30 min. As displayed in Fig. 2E and F, the Fe2TiO5 coating onto ITO/Fe2O3 is homogeneous with no change in the nanowire configuration. Interestingly, the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 nanowires appear to be straighter than the ITO/Fe2O3 nanowires; this is likely due to the confinement effect from the ultrathin Fe2TiO5 layer (this phenomenon is similar to the function of SiO2 in the fabrication of mesoporous Fe2O3 reported by K. Sivula et al.).48 When 10 mC FeNiOOH was further photo-electrodeposited onto the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 nanowires, no visible nanostructure could be observed on the nanowire surface (Fig. 2G and H), indicating its ultrathin configuration. The crystal phase and elemental information were characterized by XRD (Fig. S2A, ESI†) and EDS (Fig. S3, ESI†), confirming the presence of In2O3, hematite, pseudobrookite and FeNiOOH in the corresponding electrodes.

To identify each crystal phase via HRTEM and probe the spatial distribution of these components in the integrated electrodes, we created crystal models based on the single crystal data in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), as displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†). With these crystal models, the diffraction patterns visualized from different zone axes of each phase can be simulated. Then, the simulated diffraction pattern is compared with the power spectrum (FFT) obtained on the atomic resolution HRTEM experimental images for the identification of the crystal phases in the composite electrodes. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows low magnification TEM images of the Fe2O3 electrode with nanowire-like morphology, while its HRTEM and detailed atomic structure are displayed in Fig. 3A. The corresponding temperature coloured power spectrum (Fig. 3A right) indicates that the structure corresponds to the trigonal Fe2O3, [R3-CH]-space group 167, also known as hematite, with lattice parameters of a = b = 0.50342 nm, c = 1.37483 nm, and α = β = 90° and γ = 120° as visualized along the [21−2] direction. The HRTEM and atomic structure detail of the ITO/Fe2O3 electrode in Fig. 3B demonstrate that the modification of the FTO substrate with a 105 nm ITO underlayer does not alter the crystal phase of the Fe2O3 nanowires. The temperature coloured power spectrum (right of Fig. 3B) of the ITO/Fe2O3 electrodes indicates that the nanowires retain their single crystal hematite nature as visualized along the [110] direction; this is further supported by Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†). Fig. 3C (left) shows the HRTEM image of the edge region of a single ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 nanowire extracted from the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode nanowire array. The corresponding power spectrum (Fig. 3C right) shows that the nanowire is composed of a hematite core (Fe2O3) and a Fe2TiO5 shell ([BBMM]-space group 63, with lattice parameters of a = 0.9793 nm, b = 0.9979 nm, c = 0.3732 nm, and α = β = γ = 90°), as visualized along the [42−1] and [001] directions, respectively. RGB coloured phase filtered images corresponding to the selected area of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode in Fig. 3C are exhibited on the right. Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†) clearly confirm the homogenous coating of the Fe2TiO5 layer on the surface of the Fe2O3 nanowires. Moreover, the atomic density profile in the inset of the left HRTEM image in Fig. 3C, reveals that the thickness of the Fe2TiO5 shell is 0.78 ± 0.02 nm, in agreement with the estimated 0.81 nm from the ALD process. Fig. 3D displays a HRTEM image (left) of the electrode after the deposition of FeNiOOH to form the quaternary ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH structure. The presence of hematite and pseudobrookite phases was identified from their power spectrum (Fig. 3D middle). It is noteworthy that the crystal diffraction spots of FeNiOOH, while visible, are weak showing few crystallites (low magnification TEM images are displayed in Fig. S10, ESI†), consistent with the XRD results indicating that it is primarily amorphous.44,49–52 Moreover, the corresponding RGB phase filtered image (Fig. 3D right) illustrates the localized presence of hematite (nanowire core), pseudobrookite (shell) and FeNiOOH nanodots (surface crystallites in blue, showing a 0.256 nm plane distance corresponding to its (021) plane).52–55

The chemical compositions of the interfaces in the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrodes were investigated by EELS mapping using the K edge for O, M edges for In and Sn, and L edges for Fe, Ti and Ni. The STEM-EELS composition maps of the Fe2O3 (Fig. S11 and S12), ITO/Fe2O3 (Fig. S13 and S14) and ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 (Fig. S15 and S16) electrodes are included in the ESI.† As displayed in the STEM image of Fig. 4, the Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH composite nanowire (green squared region) is grown directly onto the ITO matrix (brighter bottom region). The individual Fe, Sn and Fe + Sn RGB composite EELS maps in Fig. 4 show that the Sn from the ITO matrix diffuses into the hematite nanowires, revealing an intensive Sn doping throughout the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode as compared to the weak Sn signal detected in the nanowires corresponding to the Fe2O3 electrode (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†). By contrast, In, in the form of In2O3, is only present in the bottom region of the electrode corresponding to the ITO underlayer, as supported by the individual In and O EELS mappings shown in Fig. 4 and HRTEM result in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Together with the STEM-EELS maps obtained in the ITO/Fe2O3 electrode (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†) and the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode (Fig. S15 and S16, ESI†), these data demonstrate that there is almost no In doping into the Fe2O3 nanowires upon the sputtering of the ITO underlayer, which is consistent with the XPS result. The Fe, Ti and Fe + Ti RGB composite EELS elemental maps obtained on the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode (Fig. 4) show complete coverage of the ultrathin Fe2TiO5 shell over the Fe2O3 nanowires. The individual Fe, Ni, and O EELS elemental maps illustrate the presence of discontinuous distributed FeNiOOH species decorated on the nanowires, in good agreement with the nanodot-like FeNiOOH structure observed in Fig. 3D and Fig. S10, S17 (ESI†). RGB composite EELS elemental maps of In + Fe, In + Fe + Ti and In + Fe + Ti + Ni together illustrate the successful construction of the quaternary ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH heterojunction nanowires via step-wise incorporation of ITO, Fe2O3, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH.

2.3 PEC performance characterization
To determine the optimum conditions for the integration of ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrodes, different synthesis parameters, including ITO thickness, TiO2 cycles, post-quench sintering conditions and FeNiOOH deposition charge, were examined (for details see Fig. S18–S27 and associated discussions in the ESI†). The PEC performance measured for the optimized four representative photoanodes is displayed in Fig. 5. The CVs of pristine Fe2O3 nanowires (Fig. 5A) show a relatively low photo-response over the whole potential window with a photocurrent density of 0.205 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, the thermodynamic potential for the OER. Upon introduction of the ITO underlayer, the photocurrent density increases to 1.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The onset potential of ITO/Fe2O3 still remains at 0.85 V, which is the same as that of the pristine Fe2O3 electrode. Besides, the CV curve of Fe2O3 and ITO/Fe2O3 electrodes at high potential region (over 1.7 V) exhibits the same trend, indicating the presence of a similar Fe2O3|electrolyte interface.15 In contrast, the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode exhibits an anodic shift in the onset potential to 1.0 V vs. RHE, along with an increase in the photocurrent density to 1.56 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The positive shift in the onset potential upon coating Fe2TiO5 onto the hematite nanowires is consistent with the result reported by Zhong et al.,53 which is probably due to the suppressing of the surface state density at a potential lower than 1.0 V vs. RHE when compared with that of the ITO/Fe2O3 electrode, as displayed in Fig. 7A. While, the CV curve of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrodes at high potential (over 1.7 V) is somehow suppressed compared with that of the Fe2O3 and ITO/Fe2O3 electrodes, illustrating its SEI variation. Despite some improvement, the PEC performance for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 nanowires remains unsatisfactory, likely caused by the slow water oxidation kinetics.54 Thus, an optimized OEC (Fig. S24 and S25, ESI†), 10 mC FeNiOOH, was deposited on the surface of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 nanowires. In the case of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode, a cathodic shift in the onset potential for the OER to 0.95 V is observed relative to the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode. Its photocurrent density of 2.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE represents the highest value among these four photoanodes, and is even higher than the photocurrent response of recently reported state-of-the-art Fe2O3 composite photoanodes (Table S2, ESI†). The tremendous increment of the photocurrent at high potential (over 1.6 V, dominated by the dark current response from the OEC) implies the successful combination of the merits of the photocatalytic activity of ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 and the electrocatalytic activity of FeNiOOH.15 Besides, there is a photocurrent plateau for all electrodes, which is derived from the transition of the hole acceptor from OH− to water in the electrolyte according to the report of Zhao et al.22 Furthermore, transient photocurrent measurements, based on the CVs under chopped light illumination, were performed for each photoanode. As shown in Fig. 5B, all electrodes exhibit a prompt and reproducible photocurrent response with respect to the irradiation signal ON–OFF cycles. The current density of these electrodes under illumination follows an ascending order of: Fe2O3 < ITO/Fe2O3 < ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 < ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH photoanodes. This is in good agreement with the CV results and further demonstrates the enhancement in PEC performance provided by addition of ITO, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH to hematite nanowires.

All polarization potentials reported here are relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and current densities are per geometric area. 
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured to understand the relationship between the photocatalytic activity and light absorption. All samples exhibit photocatalytic activity in the visible light region (Fig. 5C). The maximum IPCEs obtained at 350 nm for Fe2O3, ITO/Fe2O3, ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5, and ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH photoanodes are 2.1%, 14.8%, 18.6%, and 28.7%, respectively. The large enhancement of IPCE for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH nanowires further supports the integrated coupling effect of ITO, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH to the PEC performance. Additionally, the IPCE curves for all of these electrodes correlate with the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of Fe2O3 presented in Fig. S2B (ESI†), indicating that the Fe2O3 indeed acts as the sole visible light responsive semiconductor material. Thus, the enhanced PEC performance is preliminarily attributed to a synergistic effect between ITO, Fe2O3, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH rather than the primitively tandem function of each semiconductor material. The photoelectrochemical stability is operated by chronomperometric response at a constant applied working potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE, as shown in Fig. 5D. The photocurrent of Fe2O3 slightly decreases from 0.205 mA cm−2 to 0.17 mA cm−2 over the course of the 2 h experiment. In contrast, no photocurrent degradation was observed for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode during the stability test and it maintained a photocurrent of 2.2 mA cm−2 throughout.
2.4 PEIS and OER mechanism investigations
All the above results illustrate that the incorporation of ITO, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH largely improves the PEC performance of the hematite nanowire photoanode. A physical model of the illuminated SEI for SS-mediated, indirect hole transfer has been well established and occurs in two consecutive steps: (i) hole trapping by SS, and (ii) hole transfer from SS to water molecules at the SEI.10,23,24 To gain further insight into the mechanism of this interfacial coupling effect, primary PEIS (Fig. S28 and S29, ESI†) has been employed to identify the functions of the ITO, Fe2O3, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH in the integrated ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrodes. PEIS measurements were performed at potentials ranging from 0.65 V vs. RHE (before the onset of photocurrent) to 1.36 V vs. RHE (before the light-flux limited photocurrent region) because the effect of SS is more prevalent when unaffected by the light-flux limited and dark oxygen evolution factors.10 The obtained PEIS data was fitted based on the equivalent circuit displayed in Scheme S1A (ESI†).
Typically, the Rs, series resistance, includes the resistance at the interface between the FTO substrate, or ITO underlayer, and Fe2O3 nanowires.9,20 A substantial reduction in Rs is observed from ca. 70 Ω cm−2 for the pristine Fe2O3 electrode to ca. 35 Ω cm−2 for the composite Fe2O3 electrodes modified with the ITO underlayer, as displayed in Fig. 6A. These results mean that the ITO underlayer is able to efficiently improve the back electrical contact and facilitate the electron transport from Fe2O3 to the FTO substrate. This improvement is attributed to the enhanced Sn doping in hematite nanowires13,14 and the epitaxial relationship between the Fe2O3 and In2O3 phases, as demonstrated by the HRTEM and STEM-EELS map results. However, the capacitance associated with charge accumulation in the bulk (Cbulk, Fig. S30, ESI†) was measured to be on the same order of magnitude for these electrodes with the exception of an abrupt peak at ca. 0.9 V for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5, and ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrodes. It may be due to the addition of the ultrathin Fe2TiO5 shell, which slightly changes the electronic state of the electrodes.35Fig. 6B shows the lowest value of Rtrapping for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode as compared to the Fe2O3, ITO/Fe2O3 and ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrodes at the potential window (0.9 V to 1.36 V).10 This is consistent with the correlation of a dip in the Rct,trap and a peak in the Ctrap profile resulting in more efficient charge transfer kinetics during PEC.55 Work by Hamann and coworkers21,56,57 suggests that a large Ctrap and a low Rct,trap would eventually render larger photocurrents, provided that the charge is transferred from the SS to the electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 6C, for each of these four electrodes, a gradual decrease in Rct,trap is observed as the applied potential increases implying a increment of the associated photocurrent response. Notably, the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH photoanode possesses a relative minimum Rct,trap from 0.9 V to 1.25 V, in line with the larger photocurrent variation at this region dominated by SS (Fig. 5A). The Rct,trap at 1.25 V for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH photoanode is ca. 34 times lower than that of the pristine Fe2O3 nanowires, further evidencing its best photocurrent response. Meanwhile, the Cbulk (Fig. S30, ESI†) and Ctrap (Fig. 6D) show opposite tendencies. With the potential increase, the Cbulk decreases, whereas the Ctrap increases, implying a larger percentage of charge located on SS; similarly, a relative optimum value (Ctrap/Cbulk at 1.23 V vs. RHE) is observed in the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode. Fig. S31 and Table S1 (ESI†) reveal that the bulk donor density for the ITO/Fe2O3 electrode (2.75 × 10+19 cm−3) is 6 times higher than that for the pristine Fe2O3 electrode (4.60 × 10+18 cm−3). This effect is derived from the enhanced Sn doping in the hematite nanowires that results from the addition of the ITO underlayer (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†) and is in good agreement with the significantly improved photocurrent response of the ITO/Fe2O3 electrode.13,14 With the coating of Fe2TiO5 onto the ITO/Fe2O3 electrode, the bulk donor density is further improved to 5.80 × 10+19 cm−3, indicating that there may be a small amount of Ti doping in the Fe2O3 nanowires and thus additional photocurrent enhancement (1.56 mA cm−2) observed for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode.10

Error bars stem from the goodness of the EIS data fittings.

(The inset shows its magnified plot.)

Nd was estimated from the slopes of the Mott–Schottky plots in the dark (Fig. S31, ESI†), whereas NSS was obtained from integration of the DOSS profiles (A). Colour bar with a unit of μm is plotted on the right Y axis for NSS/Nd. (D) Ratio of the charge transfer rate constant (kct) and the sum of kct and trapping rate constant (ktrapping) at different potentials, calculated with eqn (6). 
The general behaviour of the integrated multi-layer nanowires has been interpreted and phenomenologically correlated with the SS; a deeper investigation of the photo-induced processes (i.e. charge generation and the subsequent transport to and transfer from the interfaces) is required to elucidate the interfacial charge transfer mechanism. In order to highlight the role of SS in the interfacial charge transfer process, we calculated the values for their density of surface states (DOSS) from the Ctrap using eqn (5):10,21 NSS(E) = Ctrap(E)/q(5)where NSS(E) is the DOSS (cm−2 eV−1) as a function of applied potential and q is the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C). As shown in Fig. 7A, it is possible to observe the SS energy distribution located below the photocurrent onset with its Fermi level pinned at the SS.21
Our previous report10 demonstrated that there is a direct correlation between the percentage of available filled surface states (larger DOSS) near the thermodynamic potential for the OER, and the observed photocurrent response at 1.23 V vs. RHE due to the required isoenergetic hole transfer process at the SEI.21,58 As displayed in Fig. 7A, the Nss of the four photoanodes follows the order: Fe2O3 < ITO/Fe2O3 < ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 < ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH across the entire SS dominated region (0.9 V to 1.36 V). The extended SS distribution from 0.65 V to 1.36 V in Fe2O3 and ITO/Fe2O3 electrodes probably spans inside the CB and triggers a deleterious Fermi level pinning at SS, which could be responsible for their relatively low photocurrent response. Moreover, the potential of the DOSS peak for the photoanodes shifts to more positive values, e.g., 0.9 V, 0.95 V, and 1.25 V for the Fe2O3, ITO/Fe2O3, ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrodes, respectively. Interestingly, the DOSS curve for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode displays two peaks located at ca. 1.1 V and 1.3 V. This peak splitting phenomenon displayed by the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH photoanode was further investigated by obtaining the CV curves scanned in the cathodic direction in the dark at 20 mV s−1 of these electrodes immediately after holding the electrode potential at 1.85 V vs. RHE for 1 min under illumination to photoelectrochemically oxidize the surface states.26,29,59 As displayed in Fig. 7B, for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode, two cathodic peaks appear at around 1.05 V and 1.35 V, which is relatively consistent with the DOSS peak positions for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode. Besides, Hamann et al. quantitatively correlated the Ctrap measured by both cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy with the absorption peak at 572 nm via operando UV-vis experiments, corresponding to the formation of an Fe(IV) intermediate.29 The splitting of one Ctrap peak into two Ctrap peaks was also observed upon coating an ultra-thin ALD aluminium layer onto the hematite film, which is derived from the insufficient covering of the aluminium overlayer and partial exposure of the hematite film.29 Moreover, Irie et al. investigated preliminary in situ UV-vis absorption spectra of FeNiOOH; and the incorporation of Fe into NiOOH was found to induce an increase in the absorption peak similar to that observed for the hematite electrode, demonstrating the formation of an Fe(IV) intermediate in the FeNiOOH during the electrochemical test.30 In our case, the DOSS peak splitting performance of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode can be attributed to the incomplete coverage of FeNiOOH nanodots on the nanowire surface in a manner consistent with the aluminium coated hematite reported by Hamann et al.29 The peak located at 1.1 V vs. RHE likely arises from FeIVO surface intermediates on the partially exposed Fe2TiO5 coating,31 as the same DOSS peak is observed for the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode. The DOSS peak located at 1.3 V can then be assigned to the FeIVO intermediates localized on the discontinuously distributed FeNiOOH nanodots.30 In brief, the atomic level of the Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH nanodot coatings can regulate the surface state density and energy level of the hematite nanowires, which is probably attributed to the chemical environment variation of FeIVO intermediates. After all, the identification of OER active sites in the integrated hematite photoanode60 and further insights into the evolution of FeIVO intermediates in these electrodes will need in situ TEM experiments,61 which is beyond the scope of this work.
A combined comparison of the Nss, Nd and NSS/Nd ratio is presented in Fig. 7C and Table S1 (ESI†). A large NSS/Nd ratio does not ensure good photoactivity because the number of donors in the hematite nanowires may not be high enough to endow the nanowires with good conductivity. This is demonstrated by the pristine Fe2O3 electrode which displays a high NSS/Nd ratio but poor PEC performance. In stark contrast, the ITO/Fe2O3 and ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrodes display a relatively low NSS/Nd ratio, and possess enough donors in the nanowires to provide good conductivity, but a lack of surface reactive sites still limits the PEC performance of these electrodes. In the case of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode, a relatively high NSS/Nd ratio corresponds to a scenario in which Nss and Nd are both numerous enough to give a larger photocurrent response. In addition, the charge transfer efficiency at the SEI is estimated through (eqn (6)):10,20 (6) where kct and ktrapping are the charge transfer and trapping rate constants, respectively. The charge transfer efficiency obtained from the PEIS data is shown in Fig. 7D. The abnormally high transfer efficiency (TE) in the low applied potential region (before the onset potential) might be due to deviations of the charge transfer kinetic models at the region, where the effect of SS is less prevalent.10,62 In essence, although the application of the ITO underlayer provides an additional Sn doping amount, it does not affect the rate of surface electron–hole recombination at the Fe2O3|electrolyte interface, evidenced by the same trend of TE values in the Fe2O3 and ITO/Fe2O3 electrodes. In both cases, significant surface electron–hole recombination is expected. The surface electron–hole recombination in the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 and ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrodes has been suppressed; and in the case of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode, over 80% of the holes are being transferred into the electrolyte at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The calculated TE values of these electrodes also agree well with the steady-state current-voltage relationship (Fig. 5A). Our result here highlights the effectiveness of the atomic level Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH nanodot coating on regulating the surface state density and energy level of hematite nanowires as well as reducing the surface electron–hole recombination rate to speed up the water oxidation rate.
3. Conclusions
In summary, an ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH nanowire electrode with a quaternary multilayer heterostructure has been successfully integrated by stepwise deposition of an ITO underlayer, ultrathin Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH nanodots onto Fe2O3 nanowires. The resulting quaternary multilayer nanowires exhibit significantly enhanced PEC performance, including a large photocurrent (2.2 mA cm−2) and a high stability. A deep and careful investigation into the mechanism responsible for the enhanced PEC performance has been conducted. These studies show that: (i) the ITO underlayer is used as a high quality electrical back contact to reduce the back-contact interface charge recombination and as a Sn doping source for tuning the donor density, (ii) the atomic level Fe2TiO5 coating serves as the surface state density and energy level modulation layer, and effectively suppresses the charge recombination at the semiconductor junction interface, and (iii) the FeNiOOH nanodots increase the surface active sites, and thus accelerate the OER kinetics at the SEI. The interfacial coupling effect between the ITO underlayer, the ultrathin Fe2TiO5 and the FeNiOOH nanodots in the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH photoanodes simultaneously enhances the charge separation and water oxidation efficiency, and suggests a path forward to design improved integrated photoanodes.
4. Experimental
4.1 Chemicals and materials
All commercially available reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification unless otherwise indicated. All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. If not specified, all solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (ca. 18.2 MΩ cm resistivity). The fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate (735167-1EA, 7 Ω sq−1) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
4.2 Electrode preparation
FTO substrates were cut into small pieces with 1 cm × 3 cm area and washed by sonicating in a (1:1:1) mixture of acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) and water. After rinsing the FTO substrates thoroughly with distilled water, the substrates were washed in ethanol (Fluka, 99.8%) and then dried in air at 300 °C for 1 h (heating rate: 8.5 °C min−1). A part of the substrates (ca. 1 cm × 2 cm) was covered using a polymer tape (Kaptons® Foil, VWR International) prior to the following process. The uncoated part of the FTO was later employed as the electric contact for the electrodes in the photo-electrochemical cell.

Fe2O3 electrodes. 
Hematite nanowires were prepared following a slightly adapted procedure.47 A 200 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was filled with 60 ml of an aqueous solution containing 0.15 M ferric chloride (FeCl3, 97%) and 1 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 99%) and 316 μl hydrochloric (HCl, wt 37%). Six pieces of washed FTO substrate were put into the autoclave and heated at 95 °C for 4 hours. A uniform layer of iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) nanowires was formed on the FTO substrate, as displayed in Fig. S32 (ESI†). The FeOOH-coated substrate was then washed with deionized water to remove any residual salt, and subsequently sintered in air at 550 °C (heating rate: 8.5 °C min−1) for 2 hours. During this pre-sintering process, the FeOOH nanowires were converted into hematite nanowires without deterioration of the nanowire structure, as shown Fig. S33 (ESI†). To further reduce the surface defective sites, the hematite nanowires were treated at 750 °C for an additional 30 min and subsequently quenched in air within 1 min (post-quenching process).


ITO/Fe2O3 electrodes. 
Different thicknesses (49 nm, 105 nm, 149 nm, 196 nm and 245 nm) of indium doped tin dioxide (ITO, In2O3:SnO2 = 90/10 wt%) were deposited onto the FTO substrate by DC-pulsed sputtering according to our previous report.63 After that, the ITO coated FTO substrates were subjected to the same hydrothermal and pre-sintering process for Fe2O3 electrode as described above to grow hematite nanowires on the surface of the ITO/FTO substrates. For the post-quenching process of ITO/Fe2O3, a quenching condition at 750 °C for 30 min has been employed.


ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrodes. 
The obtained ITO/Fe2O3 samples after the pre-sintering process were further subjected to a TiO2 atomic layer deposition (ALD) process.64 The ALD was performed in an R200 Picosun Atomic Layer Deposition system at 150 °C with TiCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and water as the precursors in an 8 mbar N2 flow atmosphere, reaching a growth rate of 0.27 Å cycle−1. The typical pulse time for the TiCl4 and water was 0.1 s and the purge time was 10 s. The TiO2 thickness of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode was controlled by changing the number of deposition cycles, i.e., 15 cycles, 30 cycles, 50 cycles, 100 cycles and 150 cycles. After that, a varying quenching time slot (10 min, 30 min, 40 min and 80 min) at 750 °C has been tuned to optimize the sintering conditions and transform the ALD TiO2 into Fe2TiO5.


ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrodes. 
The optimized ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrodes were further coated with FeNiOOH via photo-electrodeposition.18,39,41,54 Photo-electrodeposition of FeNiOOH on the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrodes was carried out in a mixture solution containing 0.01 M FeSO4·7H2O (≥99%) and 0.1 M NiSO4·6H2O (99%). Prior to the photo-electrodeposition of FeNiOOH, the solution was purged with nitrogen gas for 30 min. A three-electrode cell was used, composed of an ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode (work electrode), Pt wire (counter electrode), and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl, reference electrode). A 150 W AM 1.5G solar simulator (Solar Light Co., 16S-300-002 v4.0) with an incident light intensity set at 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) was used as the light source, and the light density was calibrated using a thermopile (Gentec-EO, XLPF12-3S-H2-DO) coupled with an optical power meter (Gentec-EO UNO). The light was illuminated through the glass side (back-side illumination) and the light intensity was 100 mW cm−2. For clarification, the FeOOH grown on the back side of the FTO glass during the hydrothermal process has been carefully removed for all samples by lens wiping paper before the sintering treatment. To facilitate the photoelectrodeposition, an external bias of ca. 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) was applied. During illumination, the holes generated in the valence band of Fe2O3 were used to oxidize Fe2+/Ni2+ ions to Fe3+/Ni3+ ions, which precipitate as FeNiOOH on the surface of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 electrode (Fe2+/Ni2+(aq) + h+ + 3OH− → FeNiOOH(s) + H2O).18,54 Various deposition charges (i.e., 5 mC, 10 mC, 15 mC and 20 mC) were deposited onto the surface of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5 nanowires by controlling the deposition time. The fabrication process of the ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrode is displayed in Fig. 2 (top).

4.3 Optical, structural and morphological characterization
The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on a Bruker D4 X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (1.54184 Å) and a 1D Lynkeye detector, which is equipped with a Gobel mirror in the incident beam and equatorial Soller slits in the diffracted beam (51 incidence angle, 2° step−1). Optical properties of all electrodes were characterized by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, Perkin Elmer) equipped with an integrating sphere (150 mm diameter sphere covered with Spectralon as the reflecting material, Perkin Elmer). Absorbance (A) measurements were obtained from measured reflectance (R, %) and transmission (T, %), using a wavelength range of 350 to 800 nm and a step of 5 nm, respectively. The morphology of the films was characterized using a field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Zeiss Series Auriga microscopy) equipped with an electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a Phoibos 150 analyser (SPECS GmbH, Berlin, Germany) in ultra-high vacuum conditions (base pressure 4 × 10−10 mbar) with a monochromatic aluminium Kα X-ray source (1486.74 eV). The energy resolution as measured by the FWHM of the Ag 3d5/2 peak for a sputtered silver foil was 0.8 eV. All the samples for HRTEM and STEM were prepared by using a mechanical process, as displayed in Scheme S2 (ESI†) and published elsewhere.65 HRTEM and STEM images have been obtained by using a FEI Tecnai F20 field emission gun microscope with a 0.19 nm point-to-point resolution at 200 kV equipped with an embedded Quantum Gatan Image Filter for EELS analyses. Images have been analysed by means of Gatan Digital Micrograph software. Atomic supercell modelling was performed by the Eje-Z, Rhodius and JMOL software packages with the corresponding crystal phase parameters of each species obtained from ICSD, which were verified by HRTEM and STEM-EELS mapping.65–68
4.4 Photo-electrochemical measurements
Photocurrent (j, mA cm−2) vs. potential (E, V) curves were taken using an undivided three-electrode cell. The working, counter and reference electrodes were the aforementioned composite hematite nanowires (1 cm2 geometric area), a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) electrode (Metrohm, E = 0.203 vs. NHE), respectively. The electrolyte was a 1 M NaOH solution (pH 13.6). The electrolyte was purged with N2 during the experiments. CV was taken using a computer-controlled potentiostat (VMP3, BioLogic Science Instruments). The potential was scanned from −0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl to 0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl, with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The photocurrent density is referenced to the geometric area. All potentials were corrected at 80% for the ohmic drop, which was determined using the automatic current interrupt (CI) method implemented by the potentiostat,15 and are converted and reported with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE): E (V vs. RHE) = E (V vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.0592 × pH + 0.203. Light illumination was performed using a 150 W AM 1.5G solar simulator (Solar Light Co., 16S-300-002 v 4.0) with an incident light intensity set at 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2), as measured using a thermopile (Gentec-EO, XLPF12-3S-H2-DO) coupled with an optical power meter (Gentec-EO UNO). In the PEC characterization, the light came from the front side (electrode–electrolyte interface, front side illumination). PEIS data were acquired with an alternate current (AC) perturbation of 5 mV in amplitude and a 100 mHz to 1 MHz frequency range, both in the dark and under illumination, and under selected direct current (DC) potentiostatic conditions (−0.45 to 0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Nyquist plots (imaginary vs. real components of impedance, ZImvs. ZRe) were fitted to the corresponding equivalent circuits using Z-fit (BioLogic Associates). Fitted capacitances and resistances are referred to the electrode geometric area (1 cm × 1 cm). Error bars stem from the goodness of the EIS data fittings.
4.5 Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE)
IPCE was characterized using a xenon light source (Abet 150 W Xenon Lamp) coupled with a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator). The wavelength was scanned from 350 to 800 nm (step: 10 nm step−1) keeping the voltage fixed at 1.23 V vs. RHE. To calculate IPCE, the following relation was used:55 IPCE (%) = (1240/λ) × (I/Jlight) × 100(7)where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) obtained using a potentiostat (mentioned earlier) recording the i–t curve at 1.23 V vs. RHE, λ is the incident light wavelength (nm) from monochromatic light, and Jlight (mW cm−2) is the power density of monochromatic light at a specific wavelength. A source meter (Keithley Instruments Inc., model no. 2400) coupled with the standard Silicon Photodiode (Thorlabs, S120VC) was used to measure the power density of monochromatic light.

Broader context
Conversion of solar energy to hydrogen energy using photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the key technologies to tackle serious energy and environmental problems. Hematite is a promising candidate for PEC photoanodes as its bandgap is well-suited for absorption of the solar spectrum. However, issues like poor charge transport, surface charge recombination, and slow charge transfer kinetics have limited its practical application. In light of this, an increasing number of investigations have focused on hematite heterostructures that incorporate a second material to tackle some of the inherent material limitations. While individual components of these heterostructured materials have been studied independently, there remains a wealth of untapped knowledge concerning the integration strategy. Herein we report the design and fabrication of ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH multilayer nanowires which display greatly enhanced PEC performance. By systematically comparing the pristine and representative integrated electrodes, we shed light on the working mechanism of the integrated heterojunction photoanodes. The function of each component in the integrated photoanodes has been identified, as well as the ways in which they couple together to regulate the donor density and surface state density. Additionally, the investigation of the charge transfer kinetics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface highlights the role of the surface state density/donor density ratio in determining the charge transfer efficiency. This report presents a more complete and clear picture with which to understand the integrated photoanodes for PEC water splitting.

 	Scheme 1  Top: Thermodynamic scheme for the charge transfer processes at 1.23 V vs. RHE of SEI under illumination for the Fe2O3, ITO/Fe2O3, ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5, and ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrodes. The black arrows indicate the bandgap of In2O3 (ITO matrix), hematite and Fe2TiO5. The dark blue arrow refers to the hole transfer process at the heterojunction interfaces. The purple arrow refers to the electron transfer process present at the heterojunction interfaces. For simplicity, interfacial charge transfer is considered to occur through the EV and/or EC states directly, without the intervention of interfacial SS. In all photoanodes, 4 electron–hole couples per visible active semiconductor are depicted. In2O3 (main ingredient of ITO matrix): green; Fe2O3: red; Fe2TiO5: indigo; FeNiOOH: yellow. Bottom: The atomic supercell models illustrate the interfaces existing at In2O3 (ITO matrix), hematite, Fe2TiO5 and FeNiOOH species in the integrated electrodes.

All polarization potentials reported here are relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and current densities are per geometric area.

Error bars stem from the goodness of the EIS data fittings. (B) CV curves scanned in the dark at 20 mV s−1 immediately after holding the electrode potential at 1.85 V vs. RHE for 1 min under illumination of the Fe2O3, ITO/Fe2O3, ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5, and ITO/Fe2O3/Fe2TiO5/FeNiOOH electrodes.
