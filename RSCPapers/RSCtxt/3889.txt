    , Accepted 16th July 2015First published on 20th July 2015AbstractBi2O3–SnO2 nanocomposites formed at a nominal molar ratio of 3:1 and loaded with Pd/Pt nanoparticles synthesized by a sol gel-hydrothermal method with the aid of a template were thoroughly characterized by X-ray diffraction, TEM-EDX, N2 sorptiometry, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, FTIR, photoluminescence and electrical conductivity. It has been shown that Pd and Pt stimulate the existence of β-Bi2O3 and SnO2, respectively together with the key component Bi2Sn2O7. The photocatalytic results indicate that Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 revealed a remarkable performance for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye as compared to the Pt/SnO2–Bi2Sn2O7 and Bi2O3–SnO2 samples in both the UV and visible regions. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 nanocomposite is primarily attributed to the broad contact between the β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7 phases, which indicates high mesoporosity and heterojunction structures resulting in separation efficacy between photo-induced electron–hole pairs. Specifically, the photosensitive β-Bi2O3 is easily excited and released electrons to be accepted by Bi2Sn2O7 and Pd that might be deposited in the interlayer between β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7. The degradation mechanism of MB over Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 in the visible region showed that the dye degradation proceeds through evolution of ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals as evaluated using photoluminescence and free radical trapping experiments. An insight into the electrical properties including the dielectric constant and impedance of the materials indicates that Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 has the highest conductivity based on increasing the ionic transport and defects at the β-Bi2O3/Bi2Sn2O7 heterojunction. This material displayed an improved photocurrent response of a higher power conversion efficiency, exceeding that of Pt/SnO2–Bi2Sn2O7 and SnBi3 by 50% and 250%, respectively, in dye-sensitized solar cells. Picosecond-resolved photoluminescence (PL) and polarization gated PL anisotropy measurements were combined to clarify the process of FRET from the excited Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 to SD N719. This indicates that the latter structure can be proposed as a multifunctional candidate for use in dye-sensitized solar cells, as an electrical material and as an efficient photocatalyst based on its versatile structure.
1. Introduction
Mixed metal oxides offer a higher degree of freedom compared to single metal oxides in the sense that these oxides facilitate the design of nanomaterials with superior stability and a lower optical band gap. In this context, tin oxide (SnO2), which is extensively used in optoelectronic devices and gas sensors, is hybridized with bismuth oxide (Bi2O3), which is used in various applications such as microelectronics and sensor technology,1,2 to form multiphase catalysts. Bismuth oxide, with its unique optical and electrical properties and many crystallographic polymorphs, among which the β-phase has a band gap energy of 2.3 eV, which is lower than that of the α-phase (2.85 eV), has been widely explored as a visible light photocatalyst.3–6 However, three main problems limit further applications of β-Bi2O3 in photocatalysis. Firstly, it is a metastable phase and simply transforms to the α-phase or to bismuth carbonate during a photocatalytic reaction. Secondly, it has a low quantum efficiency thus offering fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Finally, the VB of β-Bi2O3 is relatively negative, thus the oxidability of the photogenerated holes in the VB is relatively weak.7–9 Accordingly, exploiting the advantages of the binary SnO2–Bi2O3 mixed oxides has been considered, and indeed they have catalyzed several reactions such as isobutene-to-methacrolein conversion,10,11 oxidative dehydrodimerization of propylene,12 oxidative dehydroaromatization of isobutene,13 and oxidative coupling of methane.14 It has also been shown that the mentioned mixed oxides are working via a key component named bismuth pyrostannate (Bi2Sn2O7), that has also motivated other kinds of applications such as gas-sensing devices.15,16 In addition, a mixture of SnO2 and Bi2Sn2O7 displayed a high catalytic activity in the total oxidation of isobutene17 and a high selectivity in sensing CO gas.18 However, this mixed oxide suffers from lower reactivities toward photocatalytic reactions unless β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7 form interfaces with either one of the oxides.19 Recently, Bi2Sn2O7 has also been demonstrated to exhibit visible light driven photocatalytic activity. Conversely, its limited activity was usually attributed to the decrease in surface area as well as structural defects developed during synthesis.19 Accordingly, for improving the photocatalytic performance of β-Bi2O3 under the irradiation of visible light, the hybridization of Bi2Sn2O7 and β-Bi2O3 of varied work functions is expected to reveal new heterostructures for photocatalytic applications. Consequently, a β-Bi2O3/Bi2Sn2O7 hybrid doped with Pd showed unprecedented activity towards fluorene oxidation under UV light irradiation, which exceeded that of Pd/Bi2O3.19,20 The above mentioned results highlight the importance of Bi2Sn2O7 in designing an efficient hybrid consisting of SnO2–Bi2O3 not only in modifying the electronic structure but also as a charge separator.21 Under visible light irradiation, the Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles exhibited high photocatalytic activity in the oxidization of arsenite (AsO3)3− to arsenate (AsO4)3−.22 Superior photocatalytic properties for rhodamine B degradation were observed for the Bi2−xLaxSn2O7 (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20) system in both the UV and visible regions. The pseudo first order rate constants were found to increase in lanthanum-containing compositions and the dye degradation was found to proceed via different routes in the UV and visible regions.23 Accordingly, as a way of stabilizing the β-Bi2O3 phase to be applied in visible light assisted reactions, embedding SnO2 into Bi2O3via a template technique was performed. In this study, a novel visible light active β-Bi2O3/Bi2Sn2O7 photocatalyst is successfully prepared by incorporating SnO2 into Bi2O3 at a ratio of 1:3 using the sol gel-hydrothermal technique and loaded with Pd nanoparticles. The latter photocatalyst was compared with that composed of SnO2/Bi2Sn2O7, which was stimulated based on anchoring Pt nanoparticles, and this was observed to enhance the visible light activity. These catalysts were tested for methylene blue (MB) degradation via employing UV and visible light irradiation together with evaluating the reactive intermediates responsible for the dye degradation under visible light illumination. These materials were also employed as working electrodes of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) for the purpose of evaluating the electrocatalytic ability of the nanocomposites formed of Pd/SnO2–Bi2O3, Pt/SnO2–Bi2O3 and SnO2–Bi2O3 photocatalysts. The synthesized catalysts were thoroughly characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy-EDX, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, electrical conductivity, N2 sorptiometry, picosecond-resolved photoluminescence (PL) and polarization gated PL anisotropy measurements and FTIR spectrometry.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation

2.1.1. Synthesis of Pd(Pt)/SnO2–Bi2O3 nanostructures. 
In a typical procedure, appropriate amounts of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and Sn(NO3)4 were used so as to obtain a 3:1 atomic ratio in the final product. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was first dissolved in water containing pluronic-123 (100 ml) [poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)]; on average, Mn was ∼ 5800, which was the same for Sn(NO3)4. Sn(NO3)4 solution was poured onto the Bi(NO3)3·5H2O solution under vigorous stirring. The pH adjustment to a value of 8.8 via drop-wise addition of ammonia solution (18%, v/v) was performed until complete precipitation and thus the reacting solutions were kept at 85 °C under strong stirring until a gel was formed. Then, the gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave (400 ml capacity) at a temperature of 140 °C for 24 h via incubation in an electric oven. The system was then cooled to ambient temperature naturally. The as-prepared sample was collected and washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol several times, vacuum-dried and then calcined at 500 °C for 6 h to obtain SnO2–Bi2O3 nanostructures. This sample was denoted as SnBi3 where 3 accounts for the atomic ratio of 3:1 (Bi:Sn). Palladium nitrate [Pd(NO3)2] and sodium hexachloroplatinate [Na2PtCl6] to obtain a 2 wt% loading are taken as the starting material to dope the SnBi3 material, which has been dissolved in distilled water forming an emulsion using a ball mill. After mixing, sodium borohydride at a concentration of 2 g per 100 ml was added step-wise to the mixture for the sake of Pd/Pt ion reduction. The mixture was left for one day under stirring, then was filtered and washed with distilled water several times. Then it was dried at 110 °C for 5 h and calcined at 500 °C for 6 h. The samples were denoted as Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3.

2.2. Catalyst characterization

2.2.1. X-ray diffraction. 
The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of various solids were measured using a Philips 321/00 instrument. The patterns were run with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) at 36 kV and 16 mA with a scanning speed of 2° in 2θ min−1. The XRD phases present in the samples were identified with the help of ASTM powder data files.


2.2.2. N2 adsorption. 
The surface properties, namely the BET surface area, total pore volume (Vp) and mean pore radius (r), were determined from N2 adsorption isotherms measured at 77 K using conventional volumetric apparatus. The samples were out-gassed at 473 K for 3 h under a reduced pressure of 10−5 Torr before starting the measurement. The total pore volume was taken from the desorption branch of the isotherm at P/P0 = 0.98, assuming complete pore saturation.


2.2.3. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. 
Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) of the powder samples was carried out at room temperature using a Perkin Elmer Lamda-900 spectrophotometer in the range of 200–800 nm. The UV-Vis spectra were processed with Microsoft Excel software, consisting of calculation of the Kubelka–Monk function, F(R∞), which was extracted from the UV-Vis DRS absorbance. The edge energy (Eg) for the allowed transitions was determined by finding the intercept of the straight line in the low-energy rise of the plot of [F(R∞)hν]2, for the direct allowed transition, vs. hν, where hν is the incident photon energy.


2.2.4. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
TEM micrographs were measured using a Philips model Tecani Feil2, at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The powder samples were put on carbon foil with a microgrid. TEM images were observed with minimum electron irradiation to prevent damage to the sample structure. The elemental compositions of the composite material were investigated using energy-dispersive X-rays attached to the TEM equipment. The average particle diameter (d) was calculated by the following formula: d = ∑nidi/∑ni, where ni is the number of particles of diameter di in a certain range, and ∑ni is more than 100 particles on the TEM images of the sample. Computer-assisted counting of the nanoparticle images and an automated image analysis based software package including KONTRON KS 400 (Zeiss-Kontron) were used.


2.2.5. Photoluminescence and picosecond-resolved photoluminescence spectra. 
PL measurements of solids were conducted at room temperature using a He–Cd laser (370 nm) as an excitation source. For picosecond-resolved results, we have solubilized the as-prepared nanocomposites with citrate solution followed by 3 h of extensive mixing. Then, they were filtered out (by a syringe driven filter of 0.22 μm in diameter) and the UV-Vis optical absorption of the resulting filtrate solution was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer using a quartz cuvette of 1 cm in pathlength. The characteristic fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the citrate-nanocomposite solutions were recorded on a Jobin Yvon Model Fluoromax-3 fluorimeter. During the capturing of the fluorescence micrographs, in the case of both excitations (300 and 375 nm), the excitation light powers and integration times were kept constant. The picosecond-resolved fluorescence transients were measured using a Life Spec-ps spectrophotometer from Edinburgh Instruments, UK for the 375 nm excitation (80 ps instrument response function, IRF). For the 300 nm excitation, we have utilized the third harmonic laser beam of 900 nm (0.5 nJ per pulse) using a mode locked Ti–sapphire laser with an 80 MHz repetition rate (Tsunami, Spectra Physics), pumped by a 10 W Millennia (Spectra Physics) followed by a pulse-peaker (rate 8 MHz), and a third harmonic generator (Spectra Physics, model 3980).

2.3. Measurements of photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic properties of the various samples were evaluated by monitoring the degradation of MB (100 ml, 20 ppm) in the presence of 100 mg catalyst at room temperature. The photo-oxidation experiments were performed in a photoreactor made of quartz and equipped with a specific tubular space for the UV-Vis lamps as well as a cooling jacket. A medium pressure Hg lamp (120 W) equipped with a UVA responsive to 254–400 nm, and presenting strong emission lines at 325, 343, 365, 366 and 391 nm, manufactured by Vilber Lourmat, France was used as an UV light source, with an average light intensity equal to 60 mW cm−2. On the other hand, a medium Hg lamp (150 W) with a special UV cut off filter (λ = 420 nm) offering a visible light source was also used. It was placed at a specified position using a special rod in the reactor. A continuous cold water (16 ± 1 °C) supply was maintained during the experiment to control the temperature of the reaction mixture. Prior to irradiation, the catalyst and methylene blue solution were allowed to stir in the dark for 60 minutes prior to illumination to allow for adsorption of the methylene blue onto the surface of the catalyst. Aliquots of the solution were collected at different time intervals for a total of 150 minutes. Degradation of the methylene blue dye was traced by its absorption peak at 665 nm. This absorption data was used in the determination of the degradation of the dye through comparison with the absorbance at a certain time as a percentage of the initial absorbance. For detecting the active species (hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), superoxide radicals (˙O2−) and holes (h+)) as well as their role in the photocatalytic reaction, the following scavengers were added: 1.0 mM isopropanol (IP, a quencher of ˙OH), p-benzoquinone (BQ, a quencher of ˙O2−), and triethanolamine (TEOA, a quencher of h+). The method was similar to the former photocatalytic experiments.
2.4. Photovoltaic efficiency measurements
The photoelectrochemical solar cell was synthesized using a viscous paste of the produced SnBi3, Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 samples. It was prepared by adding 1 ml of triton X-100 to 0.5 g of each sample. The colloidal solution was sprayed over the conducting glass F-doped SnO2 layer (Pilkington Kappa Energy Float), of sheet resistance ∼20–22 V cm. The colloidal film was fired at 673 K for 1 h. The sintered colloidal SnBi3, Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 films were coated with N719 dye by soaking the film for ca. 36 h in 2.73 × 10−4 mol l−1 ethanol to get SnBi3, Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 electrodes with 17 mm thickness. A counter electrode consisting of the same conducting glass coated with a graphite film was also made. The counter electrode was placed directly on the top of the dye coated SnBi3, Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 films, leaving the two ends of the glass for application of the electrical contact. The electrolyte containing 0.3 M KI and 0.03 M I2 in acetonitrile was soaked up by the capillary force into the inter electrode space. The I–V characteristic for the cell was examined in the presence of light using an ELH-lamp at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The voltage was recorded using a Keithly voltammeter 175 A and the current was recorded using a Keithly electrometer 614. The fill factor was calculated using the following relation:24 FF = VmIm/VocIsc, where Vm and Im are respectively the voltage and current for the maximum power output. The solar cell efficiency (ηy) is calculated using the following relation:24ηy = VocIscFF/Pin where Pin is the power of the incident light. Monochromatic incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured using a home-made lock-in-based setup equipped with a calibrated Si/Ge photodiode, as a reference detector. The light from the halogen and Xenon lamps was spectrally dispersed using a monochromator with a set of gratings to cover the wavelength range from 300 to 900 nm. The obtained current densities were converted into incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) using the equation: IPCE = ((1240/λ) × (I/Pin)) × 100, where Pin = 30 W.
2.5. Electrical properties
The electrical properties of the prepared oxides were demonstrated via compressing the powder of the sample under a pressure of 6 tons cm−2 to form pellets. The two parallel surfaces of the pellets (7 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness) were coated with silver paste to ensure good electrical contact. Each pellet of the sample investigated was located in a sample holder inside an oven with a temperature controller of ±0.1 °C accuracy. All the samples were heated to 473 K for 1 hour before measuring to confirm the non-exiting of the hydrated water on the oxide surfaces. The electrical measurements were carried out at a constant voltage (1 volt), in a frequency range from 300 Hz to 1 MHz, and in a temperature range from 25 to 500 °C using a programmable automatic LCR bridge (model RM6306 Philips Bridge).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD and TEM investigation
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the metal-free SnBi3 composite as well as the Pd/Pt-containing composites are shown in Fig. 1. In the Sn- and Bi-rich composite, formed at the nominal ratio of 1:3, an appearance of the Bi2Sn2O7 phase is noticed via the existence of sharp and strong peaks at 2θ = 24.14° (220), 33.6° (444) and 59° (622). This pattern also shows peaks for tetragonal SnO2 at 2θ = 26.01° (110), 36.9° (200), 60.09° (310) and 68.2° (112) (comparable to the values of JCPDS 41-1445) together with peaks ascribed to the tetragonal β-Bi2O3 phase (PDF No. 27-50) at 2θ = 32.69° (220), 46.22° (222), 50.08° (440), 54.27° (203) and 55.48° (421). A residual peak at 2θ = 41.5 (221) due to the α-Bi2O3 phase is also depicted. The XRD pattern of Pd/SnBi3 indicates major peaks for the Bi2Sn2O7 phase at 2θ = 24.0° (220), 28.2° (222), 31.9° (220), 33.6° (444) and 53.1° together with peaks ascribed to the β-Bi2O3 phase at 2θ = 27.4° (120), 31.76° (002), 46.22° (222), 54.27° (203), 55.27° (421) and 57.75° (402). This pattern showed additional small intensity peaks at 2θ = 40° and 46° attributable to the (111) and (200) planes of the deposited Pd nanoparticles,25 as compared to the pattern of SnBi3. These peaks are indexed to face-centred cubic Pd (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) Card No. 05-0681, a = 3.889 Å). It appeared that Pd incorporation stimulates the evolution of new peaks for the Bi2Sn2O7 (28.2° (222), 31.9° (220), and 53.1°) and β-Bi2O3 (27.4° (120), 31.76° (002) and 57.75° (402)) phases, and declining peaks belonging to the SnO2 phase appeared in the diffraction of SnBi3. Accordingly, the disappearance of the SnO2 phase in favour of Bi2Sn2O7 growth signifies the dissolution of SnO2 in Bi2O3. Furthermore, the α-Bi2O3 phase was completely faded supporting the exposure of the β-Bi2O3 phase. This highlights that the adopted procedure as well as Pd incorporation has succeeded in obtaining a more stabilized phase of β-Bi2O3 than that obtained from the procedures reported in the literature,26 which are used to verify the stability of α-Bi2O3 at high temperatures. A significant decrease in the crystallite sizes of the Pd/SnBi3 sample was observed relative to the SnBi3 sample as the former suffers a significant decrease in crystallization intensities.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of (a) SnBi3, (b) Pd/SnBi3 and (c) Pt/SnBi3. 
On the other hand, the Pt/SnBi3 pattern, of a comparatively decreased intensity to the latter, shows nearly all the diffraction peaks that are indexed to the tetragonal SnO2 (2θ = 26.4 and 51.64) and tetragonal Bi2Sn2O7 structure (JCPDS: 34-1203) with peaks localized at 2θ = 24.14°, 29.06°, 33.55°, 51.6° and 54.78°. Simultaneously, peaks correlated to β-Bi2O3 are also shown via exposing diffractions at 2θ = 32.46° and 46.68°. Small bands at 2θ = 40°, 46° and 68° due to the 111, 200 and 211 spacings respectively, attributable to Pt metal crystallites,27 are depicted. Pt incorporation did not affect the SnO2 phase, as has been seen for Pd, but indeed decreases its percentages compared to those present in the SnBi3 sample. Accordingly, there is a slight increase in the lattice constants of the composites compared to pure SnO2, which indicates that some of the Pt4+ ions (with ionic radius 7.7 nm) incorporate into the Sn4+ sites of the SnO2 (7.2 nm) lattice rather than with Bi2O3 (10.3 nm). The average crystallite sizes estimated from the prominent diffraction peaks of SnO2 (2θ = 26.4°), Bi2Sn2O7 (2θ = 28.8°) and β-Bi2O3 (2θ = 29.16°) in the latter sample using Scherrer's equation were 12 nm, 14 and 7.8 nm, respectively. These values were the lowest compared to the metal-free and Pd-containing SnBi3 samples proposing that the introduction of Pt nanoparticles into the crystalline matrix of SnBi3 led to crystalline imperfection that in turn causes a decrease in signal intensities.
The morphologies of the synthesized samples were examined by TEM. The TEM image of SnBi3 shows an irregular polyhedral crystalline structure composed of tetragonal and hexagonal shapes with average sizes equal to 72 ± 2 nm (Fig. 2a). This image also shows an amorphous region with no agglomeration. The TEM image of Pd/SnBi3 shown in Fig. 2b reveals a polyhedral-like structure consisting mainly of cubic and hexagonal shaped nanocrystallites with an average size equal to 44 ± 2 nm. The HRTEM image of the nanoparticles (seen as an inset) exhibited resolved lattice fringes at 1.54 Å and 1.38 Å indexed to the (220) and (400) planes of β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7, respectively. This indicates the close proximity of the crystallized β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7 phases. This close interconnection between the two phases is supposed to favor the photo-induced electron transfer between the phases that are assumed to reduce the recombination of the photo-induced electrons and holes and improve the photocatalytic activity of the catalysts. The inset of Fig. 2b also shows the SAED image of Pd/SnBi3. The planes (220), (444) and (002) that appear in the SAED image, correlated respectively to Bi2Sn2O7 and β-Bi2O3, are in agreement with the results obtained from XRD analysis. This clear and bright SAED image indeed confirms the intimate contact between the β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7 phases, depicted previously via HRTEM. Fig. 2c presents the TEM image of Pt/SnBi3. It shows a wrinkled sheet-like structure with average sizes equal to 22 nm that encapsulate Pt nanoparticles of a circular shape. The HRTEM inset in this figure shows distances at 3.36 Å and 3.05 Å, which correspond to the (110) and (220) planes of the SnO2 and Bi2Sn2O7 phases, respectively. This signifies the close proximity of the two phases and the facile electron transfer between them. The average crystallite size of this sample was comparatively small compared with Pd/SnBi3, as confirmed previously via XRD analyses, explaining the role of the pluronic-123 template in slowing the nucleation rate via the sol gel technique. Accordingly, Pt interacted in a different way with SnBi3 and resulted in homogeneous nucleation so as to produce such regular cubic and hexagonal structures, and rather stimulates the existence of SnO2 rather than Bi2O3, which is promoted by the presence of Pd.

(c) TEM image of Pt/SnBi3 and the inset figure is the magnification of the area under the red arrow, where white arrows point to Pt nanoparticles. 
3.2. FTIR spectroscopy

Fig. 3 shows the FTIR spectra of the SnBi3 and Pd(Pt)/SnBi3 samples calcined at 500 °C. The observed spectra show similar prominent bands related to O–H stretching vibrations, OH deformation modes and CH2 stretching modes at 3422 cm−1, 1629–1636 cm−1 and 2850 (2920) cm−1, respectively. In concordance with the latter bands (2850 and 2920 cm−1), a mode at 1385 cm−1 due to C–H stretching existed in all the samples characterizing the presence of residual amounts of the pluronic template. Only in Pd/SnBi3 is a band at 1228 cm−1 due to C–O stretching modes observed, reflecting the extent to which the template is chemically grafted to the surface of this sample, as is also estimated from increasing the intensity of the bands in the region from 1550 to 1050 cm−l. However, this is not the case in Pt/SnBi3. Accordingly, this signifies distinctive reaction approaches for Pt and Pd towards SnBi3 nanocomposites and to the pluronic template. In this context, Pt/SnBi3 indicates lower intense bands compared to the rest of the samples demonstrating that the extent of interaction of the Bi–O and Sn–O bonds with Pt was much stronger than with Pd. This former strong interaction affected severely the intensity as previously influenced the crystallinity, as traced by the XRD of this sample. At lower wavenumbers, several bands characteristic of the oxygen–metals/stretching mode at 846, 625 and 533 cm−1 (for all samples), together with another band at 920 cm−1 (only shown for Pd/SnBi3) are present.28,29 The former bands are assigned respectively to the vibrational absorption of the Bi–O–Bi bonds, the Sn–O stretching vibration and the vibrations of Bi–O bonds in the distorted BiO6 octahedral units. The broad band at 920 cm−1 can be assigned to Bi(3)–O–Bi(6) specific vibrations and/or to vibrations of pyrochlore Sn2Bi2O7 units25 since this specific sample, Pd/SnBi3, indicates high percentages of pyrochlore compared to the rest of the samples, as confirmed from the XRD results. The broadness of the 920 cm−1 band explains that Sn2Bi2O7 in Pd/SnBi3 was not completely pure probably due to its association with the crystalline β-Bi2O3 phase, as also revealed via XRD and TEM investigations. A regular shift of the OH deformation modes to high frequencies from 1629 cm−1 in SnBi3 to 1631 cm−1 (Pd/SnBi3) and 1636 cm−1 (Pt/SnBi3) was observed. This can be explained by an increase in the force constant when the atomic number increases.

3.3. Surface texturing properties

Fig. 4 displays the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of metal-free SnBi3 as well as Pt(Pd) supported on SnBi3 nanostructures. The nitrogen sorption isotherms of all samples are similar and belong to type IV with clear hysteresis loops, indicating the formation of mesoporous structures. However, shifting the loop to a relatively higher pressure (P/P0 = 0.72–1) in the case of Pd/SnBi3 suggests an increase in the size of the mesopores, which may result from the stacking of SnO2 and Bi2O3 crystallites. Furthermore, the BET surface area of the SnBi3 sample was calculated to be 25 m2 g−1, exceeding that of the Pt (19 m2 g−1) and Pd (12 m2 g−1) containing SnBi3 composites. The marked decrease in the specific surface area following Pd(Pt) loading reflects the good dispersion of these metal nanoparticles deep inside the nanocomposite pores. It seems also that Pd (12 m2 g−1) incorporation led to more dispersion than Pt (19 m2 g−1) as is also confirmed from the diminishing pore volume and pore radius of the former sample compared to the latter (not shown). Moreover, the pore size distribution curves, plotted using the BJH method, for the SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 samples exhibited average pore diameters maximized at 2.5 and 10 nm whereas Pd/SnBi3 indicated trimodal distributions maximized at 2, 2.5 and 20 nm. Comparing the pore size distribution profiles of the former samples relative to the latter indicates that Pd incorporation stimulates the existence of wide mesopores via evolution of the pore size at 20 nm. All the isotherms belong to the category H3 type of pores, which do not exhibit limiting adsorption at high P/P0, and arise due to aggregation of plate-like particles giving rise to slit-shaped pores. This indicates that the assembly of SnO2 and Bi2O3 heterostructures using the structure directing template pluronic-123 provoked a mesoporous array, most probably reflected by the Bi2Sn2O7 formation. This is ascertained in the Pd/SnBi3 sample that indicates high mesoporosity percentages and in the same time evokes high percentages from the Bi2Sn2O7 structure.

3.4. Optical study
The optical absorption of metal-free SnBi3 as well as Pd/Pt-containing SnBi3 nanostructures was measured by UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy and the results are shown in Fig. 5. The absorbance edge of the as-prepared SnBi3 sample is located at a wavelength of 550 nm whereas those of the Pd/Pt-containing composites are located in the wavelength range from 500 to 800 nm. The band gap energies of the as-prepared SnBi3, Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 samples synthesized hydrothermally at 120 °C, using pluronic-123, and determined from the plot of (EA)2vs. energy (E) (inset Fig. 5), are found to be about 2.50, 2.30 and 2.34 eV, respectively. Such differences may be ascribed to the changes in the crystalline phase and defects that might be created following Pd/Pt incorporation. Decreasing the band gap value of Pd/SnBi3 relative to the rest of samples emphasizes that exposing β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7 besides the adopted hydrothermal method could have a positive impact on decreasing the band gap energy. The band gap value of SnBi3 was lower than those reported in previous studies30 correlated to pure SnO2 and Bi2O3 phases. For the Pt/SnBi3 and Pd/SnBi3 samples, the UV-Vis absorption was shifted into the visible region probably due to the good dispersion of the Pt/Pd nanoparticles within the nanocomposites and the introduction of isolated energy levels in the band gap of the composite semiconductors. This indeed indicates that the capabilities of these nanocomposites toward harvesting visible light are expected to increase as well as their photocatalytic performances. A significant increase in the absorption at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm for SnBi3 exceeding those of the Pd/Pt-containing samples was noticed and assigned to the intrinsic band gap transition of the SnO2 and Bi2O3 nanocrystallites6 as well as to the transition from the impurity level in the semiconductors obtained via the strong adherence between them, rather than when metal incorporation takes place. The sample Pt/SnBi3 has shown the lowest absorption and indicated a blue shift for the 300–350 nm band (305 nm) apart from the corresponding metal-free mixed oxide (SnBi3, 335 nm) and Pd/SnBi3 (320 nm) samples due to the decrease in crystallite size, as estimated from the XRD and TEM results. On the other hand, no special surface plasmon peak was noticed for Pd/Pt doped SnBi3 (which used to be at 390–450 nm) probably due to the good dispersion of the Pd/Pt nanoparticles, and to the presence of isolated energy levels in the band gap of the semiconductor19 composite. Accordingly, the peak at 395 nm cannot be assigned to surface plasmon resonance of the Pd/Pt nanoparticles since it appeared in the Pd-free SnBi3 sample.

3.5. Electrical properties

3.5.1. Frequency and temperature dependency of AC conductivity. 
The AC electrical conductivity (σAC) is a thermally activated process. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the temperature dependence of σAC for the SnBi3, Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 nanocomposites. It was found that the AC conductivity increases with an increase in temperature signifying the semiconductor behavior of the samples. As a consequence of structural changes, the electrical conductivity could intensely be modified. The temperature dependence of σAC also indicates that the electrical conduction in the material is governed by the Arrhenius relation: σAC = σ0exp(Ea/kBT)(1)Where σ0 is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energies of the mobile charge carriers, kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in K. This relation shows two linear regions with different slopes indicative of the existence of two different conduction mechanisms in the measured temperature range. It was observed that the activation energies Ea1 and Ea2, which correspond respectively to the temperature ranges 303–593 K and 593–773 K, performed at different frequencies which indicates that the Ea1 values were lower than those of Ea2. This difference may be due to the different conduction mechanisms and the instability of the SnO2/Bi2O3 nanocomposites in the mentioned temperature range as established via DTA curves, in which an endothermic peak at ∼300 °C for all samples was depicted. Oxygen vacancies and space charge polarization, generation of charge carriers and evolution of new phases may be responsible for the change in activation energy as a function of temperature.31 Oxygen vacancies may be created with an increase in the temperature. Bi2O3 may form a solid solution with SnO2 according to the following equation that has been confirmed via the XRD results: (2) As indicated in eqn (2), the formation of a solid solution in the SnO2 lattice should increase the oxygen vacancy concentration.32 In addition, Bi2O3 should contribute to the increase of negative charges due to the creation of the atomic defect Bi·Sn at the interface, inducing the formation of positive oxygen vacancies.33 Accordingly, bismuth oxide is responsible for the increase in the defect concentration at the heterostructure grain boundaries by improving the electrical properties. Accordingly, Pd/SnBi3 indicates very high conductivity compared to Pt/SnBi3 (Fig. 6) whereas SnBi3 reflects very low conductivity. This is conceivably due to the inclusion of Pd metal within the nanocomposites. SnBi3 has established structural changes via exposing the Bi2Sn2O7 and β-Bi2O3 phases with the absence of the SnO2 phase, which is known as an insulator. Whereas Pt metal comprehends the appreciable presence of the latter phase, as confirmed from the XRD results. In addition, lowering the bang gap energy of the Pd doped sample (2.3 eV) as well as its good dispersion in SnBi3 (SBET = 12 m2 g−1) influences the conductivity. The introduction of additives which increase the concentration of cation vacancies can accelerate diffusion and facilitate the polymorphic transition. In this case, at high temperatures, the activation energy (relaxation energy) is large enough to create vacancies that are summing up the energy required for vacancy creation and the motion of charge carriers into vacancies.31,32 On the other hand, Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows also that AC conductivity increases with increasing frequency according to the expression:33,34 σAC = Aωs(3)where σAC is the AC conductivity, A is a constant independent of frequency, s is the frequency exponent, and ω is theangular frequency. It was found that the value of s lies in the range 0 < s < 1 and this type of behavior represents a variable type of hopping conduction, which is in concordance with Elliot et al.35 within certain temperature and frequency regimes.36

3.5.2. Frequency and temperature dependency of the dielectric constant. 
The dielectric constant or relative permittivity ε′ is calculated using the following simplified form: ε′ = (C/ε0)(d/A)(4)where C is the capacitance, d is the thickness of pellets, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1) and A is the pellet area. The temperature dependence of the dielectric constant ε′ of the samples is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It can be seen that the dielectric constant increases with temperature and decreases with frequency. This indicates a major contribution of ionic conductivity to the dielectric constant. The dielectric polarization mechanisms that contribute to the enhanced behavior of nanomaterials are space charge polarization (SCP) processes.37 The SCP process plays an important part in our sample. Generally, nanostructured materials have about 1019 interfaces per cm3, which is much higher compared to that of bulk solids.38 The value of the dielectric constant ε′ of SnO2 nanoparticles is very high as compared to that of bulk SnO2, reported at room temperature.39 The interfaces with a large volume fraction in the nanostructured compacted samples contain a large amount of defects, such as microporosities, dangling bonds and vacancy clusters. These defects can cause a change of positive and negative space charge distributions in interfaces.39,40 Negative and positive spaces in interfaces move towards the positive and negative poles of the electric field, respectively. As they are trapped by defects, newer dipole moments will exist and the SCP process will indeed take place in the sample. Because the volume fraction of the interfaces of the nanosize sample is larger than that of bulk materials, SCP is stronger than that in the bulk materials. Thus, ε′ of the SnBi3, Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 nanoparticles is higher than that of the corresponding bulk material. It was found that the dielectric constant of the synthesized samples was in the following order: SnBi3 < Pt/SnBi3 < Pd/SnBi3, maximizing the influence of defect sites and polarization in the doped SnBi3 samples.


3.5.3. Temperature and frequency dependency of impedance. 
Impedance is a far more general concept compared to resistance because it takes phase difference into consideration. With AC the resistance R is replaced by Z which is the sum of resistance and reactance. Impedance is given by: Z = Z′ + Z′′(5)where Z′ is the real part and is expressed as Re(Z) = Z′ = |Z|cosθ and Z′′ is the imaginary part of Z expressed as Im(Z) = Z′′ = |Z|sinθ, with θ being the phase angle. The plot of these graphs in the complex plane is known as a Cole–Cole plot for the SnBi3, Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 samples (Fig. 7). The impedance spectra exhibit single semicircular arcs with their centers lying below the real axis at a particular angle of depression. These plots suggest an electrical equivalent circuit composed of a resistance R and a capacitance C connected in parallel.41 It is observed that the size of the plots decreases in the order: SnBi3 < Pt/SnBi3 < Pd/SnBi3, which is attributed to the decrease in the value of the bulk resistance (R) in the same order. This indicates the increasing of the charge transfer of Pd/SnBi3 compared to the other samples. The impedance spectra of Pd/SnBi3 show a smaller circular radii compared to the other samples involving the role of the grain boundary contribution substantiated from the adherence of the β-Bi2O3/Bi2Sn2O7 phases, which is confirmed from the XRD and TEM-EDX results.

3.6. Photocatalytic performance of the synthesized nanocomposites
Methylene blue (MB) was adopted as a representative organic pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized samples. The photocatalytic activities of the as-synthesized samples are shown in Fig. 8. The degradation efficiency is defined as C/C0, where C0 and C are the initial and reaction concentrations of MB, respectively. As seen in Fig. 8, the order of the photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized samples was Pd/SnBi3 > Pt/SnBi3 > SnBi3. It is obvious that the photocatalytic activity of the Pd/SnBi3 photocatalyst is significantly higher than those of the metal-free SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 nanocomposites either under UV or visible light irradiation. The removal efficiency of SnBi3 in the dark exhibits the maximum absorption of 25% in 60 min. This remarkable absorption indeed improved the photodegradation rate to reach 70% under UV irradiation and 43% under visible illumination for 150 min reaction time. On the other hand, Pt/SnBi3 and Pd/SnBi3 indicated a MB dark adsorption of 30%. Although they indicate a similar dark adsorption, they present different activities under UV light illumination (77% for Pt/SnBi3vs. 98% for Pd/SnBi3) whereas under visible irradiation Pt/SnBi3 exhibited a removal efficiency of 50% compared to 78% for Pd/SnBi3. This shows that Pd/SnBi3 is more active than Pt/SnBi3 under both UV and visible light irradiation and indeed exceeds those values related to SnBi3. These differences in the catalytic activity are dependent on spatial variations in the charge transfer at the Pd/SnBi3 and Pt/SnBi3 interfaces. To figure out if the photocatalytic activity is related to the dynamics of the separation and recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes, a photoluminescence (PL) study is carried out and illustrated in Fig. 9. It can be seen that at the excitation wavelength of 380 nm, the nanocomposite samples displayed strong and broad emission peaks at ∼460 nm. The emission intensity is significantly decreased in the Pd/SnBi3 sample comparatively. This possibly indicates that the latter sample acted as traps for the photo-induced charge carriers. On the other hand, SnBi3 can indeed absorb light to excite the valence band electrons to produce electron–hole pairs, however, it recombines rapidly followed by the Pt/SnBi3 sample. Accordingly, the heterostructure consisting of β-Bi2O3/Bi2Sn2O7 derived from Pd/SnBi3 is considerably active if compared with SnO2/Bi2Sn2O7 in Pt/SnBi3. Besides, the adsorption performance of the nanocomposites, the active species in the reaction process, is another key factor that influences the photocatalytic reaction. To figure out the reactive intermediates exposed following irradiation of Pd/SnBi3 and their role in the photodegradation reaction, the scavengers BQ (a quencher of ˙O2−), TEOA (a quencher of h+) and 2-propanol (IP) (a quencher of ˙OH) were employed. As is shown in Fig. 10, the rate of MB degradation at a low concentration of 2-propanol indicates great inhibition showing that the hydroxyl radicals are the major active species during the photocatalytic oxidation reaction. Further trapping experiments for detecting other active species were again conducted during the photocatalytic degradation of MB in the presence of Pd/SnBi3 under visible light irradiation. As observed, the degradation efficiency of MB was highly affected by the addition of 1 mM BQ (a quencher of ˙O2−), but apparently was not decreased with the addition 1 mM TEOA (a quencher of h+). Therefore, the results show that ˙OH and ˙O2− are the two main active species playing key roles in the degradation of MB, rather than h+. To further confirm the evolution of ˙O2− as a reactive species, bubbling N2 gas (30 ml min−1) in the reaction medium while irradiating Pd/SnBi3 by visible light indicates a marked decrease in the activity to 40%. Thus, under visible illumination, the heterostructure Pd/SnBi3 is excited to produce electron–hole pairs in both β-Bi2O3 (2.3 eV) and Bi2Sn2O7 (2.7 eV)42 since the energy of the visible light photon (2.9 eV) is greater than that of the latter oxides (Scheme 1). Accordingly, electrons in the valence band of β-Bi2O3 can be excited in an easier way compared to Bi2Sn2O7 to produce electrons and holes. Conversely, the holes from the VB of Bi2Sn2O7 were injected into that of β-Bi2O3. This creates an internal electrostatic potential in the space charge region that is beneficial to the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. The electrons then react with O2 molecules to form ˙O2− to degrade MB in water together with the provoked ˙OH. Indeed, Bi2Sn2O7 also shares in enhancing the photocatalytic activity not only due to the formed heterojunction with β-Bi2O3 but also due to it accepting migrated electrons from β-Bi2O3 and thus delaying the expected fast recombination between the holes and electrons. On the other hand, doping by Pd increases the optical response across the entire visible spectrum, as seen in diffuse reflectance results, which reflects that Pd might make its way between the interlayers between β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7 or on their surfaces due to the varied ionic radii of Pd (0.86 Å) and β-Bi2O3 (1.03 Å) unlike the case between Pt and SnO2. Pd metal is acknowledged to be used in an electron reservoir or electron transfer systems to optimize and/or improve the spatial charge carrier separation and transfer across the interfacial domain between Bi2Sn2O7 and β-Bi2O3 upon visible light irradiation. The possible electron transfer processes that can occur in the Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 system during the photocatalytic degradation of MB are a transfer of electrons from (1) the sensitized dye to the conduction band of β-Bi2O3, (2) the sensitized dye to the Pd particles, (3) the CB of β-Bi2O3 to Pd, and (4) the CB of β-Bi2O3 to its VB (recombination) and the sensitized dye to the shallow trap levels in the band gap of β-Bi2O3. Both processes (1) and (2) are possible in the case of Pd because of the position of its energy level. This electron transfer will continue until the overall Fermi level of the metal-modified β-Bi2O3 system shifts toward a more negative potential. Once this level is reached, Pd discharges the stored electrons in to the solution where they react with dissolved oxygen to form ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals in turn. These active oxygen species react with the dye molecules and degrade them. On the other hand, the close proximity between the SnO2 and Bi2Sn2O7 phases in Pt/SnBi3, and the delay in the facile electron transfer between them as compared to the β-Bi2O3/Bi2Sn2O7 phases in Pd/SnBi3, based on the consideration that Pt nanoparticles can form local Schottky junctions,27 is probably due to the back donation expected from Pt (6.1 eV) metal of a high work function compared to Pd (5.4 eV). Accordingly, Pd can serve as electron reservoirs to accept the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band (CB) of Bi2Sn2O7.

 Scheme 1  Plot for the electron–hole separation and transport at the visible light driven Pd/SnBi3 photocatalyst interface. 
It seems also that the mesoporous character of Pd/SnBi3 plays an important role in enhancing the catalytic properties and has also been substantiated via the existence of the trimodal pores (2, 2.5, 20 nm) compared to the other samples. This proposes that the reaction can take place inside the pores as well as on the catalyst surfaces. In addition the existence of a C–O band in the FTIR results, never seen in the other samples, could also facilitate the formation of ˙O2− upon irradiation. On the other hand, the comparative decrease in the photocatalytic performance of SnBi3 under ultraviolet and visible light irradiation conveys the lower importance of the α-Bi2O3 phase and indeed the presence of substantial amounts of SnO2 together with the β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7 phases which constitute the most active sites. The decreased crystallinity of the Pt/SnBi3 sample, as derived from the XRD and IR data, could also affect the electron transfer in a facile way comparatively. Specifically, these defects are considered as important factors influencing the photocatalysis process since they could act as electron–hole recombination centers, resulting in a low photocatalytic activity. The aforementioned enhanced photocatalytic and electrical conductivity capabilities of our synthesized mesoporous nanocomposites, and most importantly Pd/β-Bi2O3/Bi2Sn2O7, indicate that these materials could be advantageous for application in DSSCs.
3.7. Photovoltaic properties

Fig. 11 shows the current density–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs with different nanocomposite counter electrodes under visible light illumination (100 mW cm−2). The derived photovoltaic parameters, such as the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (ηy) are summarized in Table 1. The DSSC with Pt/SnBi3 as the working electrode performs poorly, with the photovoltaic parameters being Jsc = 0.063 mA cm−2, typical to that of SnBi3, Voc = 230 mV, FF = 0.33 and ηy = 0.04%. The poor photovoltaic performance of the DSSC with Pt/SnBi3 compared to Pd/SnBi3 (of a greater conversion efficiency, reaching 0.2%) as the electrode can be attributed to the high voltage losses on the electrode of the former photocatalyst due to its insufficient electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. Accordingly, increasing the FF value of the latter photocatalyst indicates that the heterojunction Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 was responsible for improving the Jsc performance. The Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 heterojunction film exhibited an almost 1.7-fold higher photocurrent density (0.108 mA cm−2) than the Pt-containing nanocomposite (0.063 mA cm−2) and the metal-free SnBi3 film (0.062 mA cm−2) under illumination. This enhanced photoelectrochemical performance is probably due to the increased optical absorption and efficient photogenerated carrier separation at the Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 interface. Additionally, the β-Bi2O3 film has a more negative onset potential compared to the Bi2Sn2O7 film (see Scheme 1). Accordingly, the dye absorbs photons (light) and becomes photo-excited, and in turn injects electrons into the conduction band of β-Bi2O3 (donor–acceptor interface) i.e. the photo-excited state is formed at the interface where the charge separation takes place, for the sake of increasing the photodynamic efficiency (light-to-electricity conversion). Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the IPCE as a function of wavelength for the three cells. It has been acknowledged that the IPCE was dominated by the light-harvesting efficiency, the quantum yield of electron injection and the efficiency of collecting the injected electrons.43 Compared to the Pt/SnBi3 cell, the IPCE of Pd/SnBi3 and SnBi3 gives values equal 58% and 43% at 580 nm and 605 nm, respectively whereas the former indicates an IPCE of 27% at 580 nm. The films of both Pd/SnBi3 and SnBi3 had a higher IPCE in the wavelength range from 500 nm to 850 nm than Pt/SnBi3. This is in agreement with the photovoltaic values and specifically those of the conversion efficiency presented in Table 1. However this is not the case for the data in Fig. 5 in which the sequence in the visible light absorption was dominated by Pt(Pd) followed by the mother sample. This indicates that the weak photovoltaic energy conversion of Pt/SnBi3 could be due to the presence of defects at the disordered surface, enhancing the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. This is emphasized earlier via increasing defects, at which an electron–hole recombination process occurred, on Pt/SnBi3 due to decreasing its crystallinity comparatively. Interestingly, the working electrode assembled of Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 displayed an improved photocurrent response over those prepared with GO/α-Bi2O3 and Ag/GO/α-Bi2O.44

3.8. Picosecond-resolved spectra
Both the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Pd/SnBi3 capped by citrate ions are shown in Fig. 12. The absorption maximum is noticed to be at 330 nm (Fig. 12a). As can be observed in Fig. 12b, upon 300 and 375 nm laser excitation, strong emissions at 420 and 480 nm (Fig. 12c) were respectively developed. A significant overlap between the excitation (usually similar to the optical absorption curve of the pure compound) of Pd/SnBi3 and its emission bands was obtained, which is one of the key criteria for Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamics. Indeed, we propose FRET between the donor–acceptor pair transition of Pd/SnBi3 nanocomposites in which the mechanism involves a donor excited electronic state, which may transfer its excitation energy to a nearby acceptor in a non-radiative fashion through long-range dipole–dipole interaction.45 More specifically, the heterojunction between β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7 is the key for charge transfer in the nanocomposite, as emphasized in Scheme 1 and supported by the TEM-EDX and PL data. The appearance of different states of the free exciton reflects the good optical properties of the Pd/SnBi3 nanoarchitecture. In principle, if the fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor molecule overlaps with the absorption spectrum of an acceptor molecule, and if the two are within a minimal distance from one another (1–10 nm), the donor can directly transfer its excitation energy to the acceptor via exchange of a virtual photon.46 The donor thus decays to the ground state while the acceptor is still excited. A significant decrease in the Pd/SnBi3 lifetime was observed in the following sequence: 420 > 460 ≈ 500 nm, as shown in Fig. 13a and b. In particular, the fast component, which contributes nearly 90% of the decay, shows a major increase in lifetime from 0.04 to 0.118 ns (at 460 nm) and 0.138 ns (at 500 nm) in the Pd/SnBi3 nanocomposite. This indicates that a major population of the charge injection process occurs with a greater rate constant as high as 109 s−1 if we compare only the fast component of the emission transients. 90% of the emission decay of the Pd/SnBi3 nanocomposites occurs with a lifetime of 0.04 ns indicating that the major fraction of the charge injection event occurs on an ultrafast time scale. A significant decrease in the Pd/SnBi3 fluorescence lifetime (τav) is observed in the sequence 420 > 500 ≥ 460 nm and these fluorescence lifetimes are summarized in Table 2. On the other hand, the decreased efficiency of the Pt/SnO2–Bi2Sn2O7 heterojunction was due to the slower component of 0.04 ns that generates a contribution comprised of 60% whereas the decay in the SnBi3 composite indicates a contribution equal to 40%. This means that decreasing the percentage of carriers at the ultrafast time scale affects seriously the activity of the photo-responsive reactions of the Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 and Pt/SnO2–Bi2Sn2O7 samples. The photoluminescence lifetime of Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 and Pt/SnO2–Bi2Sn2O7 was in the order of nanoseconds, and the photoluminescence lifetime of the former exceeds that of the latter. A longer PL lifetime means that there is a lower recombination rate of the electron–hole pairs, and thus a higher photocatalytic activity is obtained for the former comparatively.

4. Conclusion
The synthesized composite consisting of β-Bi2O3 and Bi2Sn2O7 stimulated by Pd has demonstrated high electrical and photocatalytic functionality. The enhanced photocatalysis of Pd/β-Bi2O3–Bi2Sn2O7 during MB degradation under visible light irradiation (9.2 ×10−3 min−1), which was 4-fold the value of Pt/SnO2–Bi2Sn2O7 (3.0 × 10−3 min−1), was due to the facile charge transfer on an ultrafast time scale, as derived from picosecond data, facilitated by the heterojunction exhibited between the β-Bi2O3/Bi2Sn2O7 phases, and to the enhanced mesoporosity. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the latter photocatalyst was also assisted by the evolution of O2˙− and ˙OH radicals emphasizing the role of photogenerated electrons rather than holes in the photo-oxidation reaction. In order to explore the multifunctionality of this unique bismuth-containing system, this material is explored as the counter electrode of DSSCs and exhibited an improved electrocatalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox reaction and an enhanced electrolyte diffusion capacity. This sample (Pd/β-Bi2O3/Bi2Sn2O7) accordingly indicated very high electrical conductivity compared with Pt/SnO2/Bi2Sn2O7 whereas SnBi3 reflects no conductivity. This conceivably could lead to the inclusion of Pd metal within the nanocomposites due to its influence in establishing structural changes via exposing the Bi2Sn2O7/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction in the absence of the SnO2 phase, which is known as an insulator.
