    , Accepted 15th July 2022First published on 18th July 2022AbstractDirect Z-scheme photocatalytic systems are very promising composite photocatalysts, and their photocatalytic performance is highly associated with the quality of the interface within them. Herein, a novel direct Z-scheme heterojunction with a coherent interface has been presented for the first time. Specifically, the heterojunction was constructed by dispersing pre-prepared BiVO4 crystals into the reaction system to synthesize Cu3SnS4, followed by a hydrothermal reaction. It is shown that Cu3SnS4 was deposited on the surface of each pre-prepared BiVO4 crystal as a thin layer via heterogeneous nucleation to acquire a core–shell heterojunction. The BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 heterojunction was found to possess an atomic coherent interface, which is formed through the bonding between the (121) plane of BiVO4 and the (112) plane of Cu3SnS4, originating from the matching in the crystalline lattice between the two planes. The coherent interface facilitated the charge transfer from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4 owing to the difference in their Fermi levels, thereby forming a built-in electric field pointing from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4. Reduced fluorescence emission and a shortened carrier lifetime reveal an obvious reduction in the inter-band charge recombination for the optimal BVO@CTS-0.19 sample. Consequently, BVO@CTS-0.19 shows remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance in MO degradation, Cr6+ reduction and oxygen evolution. The Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism for BVO@CTS-0.19 was verified by a suite of techniques. This work provides a universal strategy for building a coherent interface to develop high-performance direct Z-scheme heterojunctions.
1. Introduction
Photocatalysis as a green technology has potential applications in contaminant degradation, water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, selective organic synthesis, etc.1 Semiconducting photocatalysts are the key to this technology, and are required to meet several criteria related to the band gap, band positions, stability, and efficiency.2–5 In view of the difficulty of meeting all those criteria simultaneously for a single semiconductor, combining two or more semiconductors has proven to be an effective way to develop high-performance photocatalysts.6–9 Among the various composite photocatalysts, direct Z-scheme heterojunctions are the most attractive, receiving increasing attention.10–12 This is because direct Z-scheme heterojunctions not only can promote the separation between the photogenerated electrons and holes without sacrificing the reducibility of electrons and the oxidizing capacity of holes but also have the merit of simple preparation as they have no need for solid (or liquid) electron mediators.13–15 When constructing a direct Z-scheme heterojunction, the absence of an electron mediator means that the interface between the two semiconducting components must be elaborately designed to allow for electron transfer. That is, the interface should facilitate the photogenerated electrons with lower reduction potential transfer from one component to the other to recombine with the photogenerated holes with lower oxidizing capacity, thus leaving the corresponding holes with higher oxidizing capacity and electrons with higher reduction potential for surface redox reactions. Evidently, the quality of an interface is highly associated with the photocatalytic activity of a direct Z-scheme heterojunction.
A coherent interface refers to that in which the atoms on the interface are exactly at the nodes of the lattices of the two phases, that is, the lattices of the two phases are connected to each other, and the atoms on the interface are common to both. It has been reported that building a coherent interface has been proven as an effective approach to reducing the interfacial charge scattering, thus improving the interfacial charge transfer efficiency.16–18 For instance, Jabar et al.16 reported that including Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 nanoparticles into Bi2Te3 to build a large number of coherent boundaries resulted in high electron mobility as well as an increase in the power factor by 11%. More recently, Min et al.19 built a coherent interlayer between a SnO2 electron-transporting layer and a halide perovskite light-absorbing layer, thereby leading to a reduction in interfacial defects and then an improvement in electron extract and transfer from the perovskite layer. The obtained solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of as high as 25.8% (certified 25.5%) under 1 sun illumination. In this context, it can be inferred that, selecting two semiconducting components with appropriate band positions to build the coherent interface, is expected to develop a novel direct Z-scheme heterojunction with high photocatalytic performance. However, except for the direct Z-scheme heterojunction of the semicoherent FAPbBr3/Bi2WO6 interface,20 no heterojunction with a coherent interface has been reported yet.
In this work, a direct Z-scheme heterojunction with a coherent interface was explored for the first time. Specifically, the monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 and the tetragonal sulphur tin copper Cu3SnS4 were chosen as the two components since Cu3SnS4 possesses a (112) crystal plane with an inter-planar spacing of 0.312 nm, very close to the (040) and (121) crystal inter-planar spacings of 0.290 nm and 0.310 nm, respectively, of BiVO4. Moreover, the valence and conduction band positions (−0.68 eV and 0.77 eV, respectively21) of Cu3SnS4 match well with those (0.35 eV and 2.79 eV, respectively22) of BiVO4 to enable the formation of a direct Z-scheme heterojunction. Concretely, the pre-prepared BiVO4 crystals were dispersed in a reaction solution to synthesize Cu3SnS4 using a hydrothermal method. It was found that the surface of each BiVO4 crystal was fully covered with Cu3SnS4 as a thin layer with a thickness of around 10 nm to construct a core–shell heterojunction. More impressively, along the interface between BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4, both the crystalline lattices of the (112) plane (d = 0.312 nm) for Cu3SnS4 and the (121) (d = 0.310 nm) plane of BiVO4 could be clearly distinguished, resulting in a coherent interface formed as designed. The coherent interface favored the electron transfer from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4, thus facilitating the formation of a built-in electric field. The BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 junction was verified as a direct Z-scheme. Under illumination, the built-in electric field facilitated the photogenerated electron transfer via the coherent interface from the conduction band of BiVO4 to the valence band of Cu3SnS4 to combine with the holes located there, thereby, suppressing the inter-band recombination within both BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4. As a result, the BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 heterojunction exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity in the MO degradation, Cr6+ photoreduction, and oxygen evolution. This work sheds light on developing a high-performance direct Z-scheme heterojunction by building a coherent interface.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, 99%), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99%), and ammonia solution (NH4OH, 25%–28%) were purchased from Aladdin's reagent. Cupric acetate monohydrate (CuAc2·H2O, 99.99%), tin tetrachloride (SnCl4·5H2O, 99%), thiourea (CH4N2S, 99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%), methyl orange (MO, 96%), and nitric acid (HNO3, 68%) were purchased from Alfar Aesar. Ethanol (C2H6O, 99.9%) was purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemicals Reagent Factory. All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification, and the water used in all experiments was deionized water.
2.2. Sample preparation

Synthesis of BiVO4. 
BiVO4 was prepared using a facile hydrothermal synthesis method.23 In a typical procedure, 10 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was completely dissolved in 60 mL of a 2 M HNO3 aqueous solution, followed by adding 10 mmol of NH4VO3 under vigorous stirring. A precursor solution was then obtained by further addition of 10 mL of an ammonia solution (25–28 wt%) dropwise with strong stirring to adjust the pH value to 2.0. After continuous stirring for about 1 h at room temperature, such precursor solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, followed by maintaining it at 180 °C for 10 h. The resulting yellow product was centrifugally separated, washed with ethanol and deionized water in sequence five times, and vacuum-dried at 60 °C, and the obtained sample was denoted as BVO.


Synthesis of BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 composite. 

Fig. 1 shows the process for preparing the BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 composites. In brief, 0.3 mmol of Cu(ac)2·H2O, 0.1 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O, and 0.4 mmol of thiourea were dissolved in 45 mL of DMF, followed by stirring for 1 h to obtain a reaction solution for preparing Cu3SnS4. Subsequently, BVO was added to the reaction solution at different molar ratios of Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4, followed by ultrasonically dispersing for 1 h. Afterwards, the suspensions were transferred into 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves, followed by maintaining them at 180 °C for 12 h, respectively. Finally, the obtained products were centrifugally separated, washed, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h to acquire the BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 composites, named BVO@CTS-x (x was the molar ratio of Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4, which was set at 0.11, 0.15, 0.19, 0.29, or 0.59). For comparison purposes, a Cu3SnS4 sample, denoted as CTS, was fabricated directly from the reaction solution by the identical process without the addition of BVO. Besides, a contrast sample, named CTS-BVO-m, was prepared by mixing BVO and CTS directly with a mole ratio of CTS to BVO of 0.19.

2.3. DFT calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the CASTEP module based on the plane-wave-pseudopotential approach. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used as the exchange–correlation function. An ultrasoft pseudo-potential was employed to describe the interaction between valence electrons and the ionic core. A kinetic energy cutoff of 571 eV and Monkhorst–Pack special k-point meshes of 5 × 5 × 1 were proposed to carry out the geometry optimization. The structure model was built from Cu3SnS4 and BiVO4 with a build layer. A 15 Å vacuum layer was used to separate the periodic structures to avoid false interactions between the periodic systems. During the geometry optimization, the convergence thresholds of maximum displacement, maximum force, and energy were smaller than 0.03 eV Å−1, and 1.0 × 10−5 eV per atom, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and morphologies of BVO@CTS composites
The crystalline phases of CTS, BVO, and BVO@CTS-x were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 2a, the diffraction peaks of BVO are located at 2θ of 18.6°, 18.9°, 28.9°, 30.5°, 34.5°, 35.2°, 39.7°, 42.4°, 45.6°, 46.7°, 50.3°, 53.3°, 58.5° and 59.2°, which can be assigned to (110), (001), (121), (040), (200), (002), (211), (051), (231), (240), (202), (161), (321), (123) planes of monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS No. 14-0688), respectively. CTS exhibits seven intense peaks at 28.3°, 33.1°, 47.9°, 56.4°, 69.5°, 76.7°, and 88.5° (Fig. S1†), which could be indexed to (112), (200), (220), (132), (008), (332), and (244) planes, respectively, of tetragonal Cu3SnS4 crystals (JCPDS No. 33-0501). No other impurity phases were observed. These results suggest that the as-prepared sample is pure tetragonal Cu3SnS4. The XRD patterns of BVO@CTS-x are very close to that of BVO, implying that the crystal structure of BVO was not destroyed during the hydrothermal reaction. No obvious diffraction peaks of CTS were found in BVO@CTS-x, mainly due to the low CTS content in them. Moreover, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to observe the prepared samples. BVO (Fig. 2b) presented a decahedral shape with a smooth surface and sharp edges, and the crystals had an average size of about 1.5–2 μm. CTS (Fig. 2c) consists of flower-like particles with an average particle size of about 0.5 μm. Notably, BVO@CTS-x (Fig. 2d) also appeared as decahedral crystals, although their surfaces are not smooth. As x increases (the molar ratio of Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4), more and more particles are deposited on the surfaces of the crystals (Fig. S2†). According to the preparation process of BVO@CTS-0.19, it can be inferred that the BVO crystal retains its decahedral morphology unchanged during the hydrothermal reaction, while Cu3SnS4 was deposited on the surfaces of each BVO crystal by the heterogeneous nucleation.

A transmission electron microscope (TEM) was further used to observe the microstructure of BVO@CTS-0.19, together with those of BVO and CTS. BVO has a decahedral shape with a smooth surface and defined edges (Fig. S3a†), and CTS consists of flakes (Fig. S3b†). Notably, the surfaces of the crystal for BVO@CTS-0.19 (Fig. 3a) are fully covered with Cu3SnS4 as a thin layer with a thickness of ∼10 nm. The difference between BVO and BVO@CTS-0.19 can be clearly observed from their amplified views (the insets of Fig. S3a† and Fig. 3a). TEM observations further confirm the deposition of Cu3SnS4 on the surfaces of the BVO crystals. It is revealed that, when BVO was dispersed into the reaction system, the heterogeneous nucleation leads to the deposition of Cu3SnS4 with a thin layer on the surface of each BVO crystal, and then the homogeneous nucleation takes place to generate the Cu3SnS4 particles, especially at the relatively high x values (Fig. S2†). The priority in the heterogeneous nucleation of Cu3SnS4 on the surface of the BVO crystal could be attributed to the match in lattice between BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4. Intriguingly, the HRTEM image (Fig. 3b) of BVO@CTS-0.19 verifies the match in lattice between BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4. Along the interface between BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4 (the dashed line), both the crystalline lattices of the (112) plane (d = 0.312 nm) for Cu3SnS4 and the (121) (d = 0.310 nm) planes for BiVO4 can be clearly distinguished, resulting in a coherent interface formed between them. The coherent interface helps reduce the interface state density between BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4, thereby providing an excellent channel for charge transfer between them.17

Furthermore, DFT calculations were conducted to elucidate the bonding between the (112) plane of Cu3SnS4 and the (121) plane of BiVO4. Note that there are two possibilities between the (112) plane of Cu3SnS4 and the (121) plane of BiVO4 (Fig. S6†): In one case, the side of S in the (112) plane of Cu3SnS4 could weld to the side of O in the (121) plane of BiVO4. In the other case, the side of Cu in the (112) plane of Cu3SnS4 could weld to the side of O in the (121) plane of BiVO4. Subsequently, the total energy for each case was calculated. It is found that the energy is −33072.532 eV for the side of Cu to weld to the side of O while −33072.223 eV for the side of S to weld to the side of O. According to the minimum energy principle, the side of Cu in the (112) plane of Cu3SnS4 with that side of O in the (121) plane of BiVO4 is more stable and thus more likely to form at the interface contact, as illustrated in Fig. 3c.
Moreover, the typical SAED patterns of BVO, CTS, and BVO@CTS-0.19 are shown in Fig. 3d–f. BVO and CTS were revealed to be single crystalline and polycrystalline, respectively. As for BVO@CTS-0.19 (Fig. 3f), both the diffraction spots of BiVO4 and the diffraction rings of Cu3SnS4 exist in its SEAD pattern. More significantly, the diffraction spots for the (121) lattice planes of BiVO4 overlap with the diffraction rings for the (112) planes of Cu3SnS4 at the junction region, further confirming the formation of the coherent interface.24 Besides, the HAADF mapping (Fig. 3g) clearly shows the complete coverage of Cu3SnS4 on the surface of BVO, further verifying the priority in the heterogeneous nucleation of Cu3SnS4 on the surface of the BVO crystal. Notably, Cu, Sn, and S elements are uniformly distributed in BVO@CTS-0.19, so also are Bi, V, and O elements, as observed from the HAADF mapping and SEM-mapping images (Fig. 3g and Fig. S4a†). The atomic percentages of each element for BVO@CTS-0.19 were obtained from EDS (Fig. S4b†), which were 1.15% for Cu, 0.38% for Sn, 1.29% for S, 14.63% for Bi, 12.39% for V, and 70.16% for O. It was found that S vacancies existed in BVO@CTS-0.19, which was verified from the solid-state EPR spectrum of CTS (Fig. S5†).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to analyze the chemical states of CTS, BVO, and BVO@CTS-0.19. BVO@CTS-0.19 contains all the Cu, Sn, S, Bi, V, and O elements of both Cu3SnS4 and BiVO4, and no other impurity elements are found (Fig. S7†). Specifically, the Cu 2p spectrum of CTS (Fig. 4a) reveals the presence of Cu+ and Cu2+ on its surface.25 The Sn 3d spectrum of CTS (Fig. 4b) consists of two peaks, ascribed to Sn 3d5/2 (495.2 eV) and Sn 3d3/2 (487.3 eV), respectively, indicating that Sn is in both Sn2+ and Sn4+ oxidation states.26 The S 2p spectrum (Fig. 4c) reveals the presence of Cu+–S, Cu2+–S, Sn2+–S, and Sn4+–S on the CTS surface.27 Notably, the Cu 2p and Sn 3d high-resolution XPS spectra of BVO@CTS-0.19 are similar to that of CTS, while slightly shifting to lower binding energies (red arrows) for the corresponding peaks. It should be mentioned that the S 2p spectrum of BVO@CTS-0.19 is hard to analyze, due to its location between the two high peaks of Bi 4f. Besides, the Bi 4f (Fig. 4d) and V 2p (Fig. 4e) high-resolution XPS spectra of BVO@CTS-0.19 exhibit slight shifts to higher binding energies (red arrows) for the corresponding peaks, compared with those of BVO. This positive shift could be explained as following. After the built-in electric field was formed within BVO@CTS-0.19, the electrons in the conduction band of the BiVO4 component within the heterojunction could transfer to the Cu3SnS4 component through the atomic coherent interface driven by the electric force, followed by recombining with the holes in the valence band of the Cu3SnS4 component. This would lead to the increase in the electron density of the Cu3SnS4 component along with the decrease in the electron density of the BiVO4 component in BVO@CTS-0.19.28 As for the O 1s spectra (Fig. 4f), BVO presents two peaks: the one at 529.9 eV corresponding to the lattice oxygen in the monoclinic phase BVO, and the other one at 531.3 eV can be ascribed to the adsorbed oxygen.29 CTS also shows two peaks: the one at 530.6 eV could be attributed to the adsorbed oxygen, and the other one at 531.8 eV could be ascribed to the OH species on the CTS surface.30 As for BVO@CTS-0.19, its O 1s spectrum consists of three peaks: the peaks at 530.1 eV and 531.4 eV can be ascribed to the lattice oxygen in the monoclinic phase BVO and the adsorbed oxygen, respectively, while the peak at 531.8 eV could be ascribed to the OH species. It is revealed that, compared to BVO, BVO@CTS-0.19 exhibits a shift in the binding energy of the lattice oxygen from 529.9 eV for BVO to 530.1 eV. To summarize, both the shifts to lower binding energies for Cu3SnS4 and the shifts to higher binding energies for BiVO4, imply a strong interaction between the two semiconducting components of BVO@CTS-0.19.31

3.2. Optical absorption property and photocatalytic activity

Fig. 5a shows the diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) of all the samples. BVO shows a light absorption edge of about 516 nm, responding to a limited part of the visible light region. While the spectrum of CTS covers the entire visible light region. As for BVO@CTS-x, these composites exhibit a red shift in the absorption edge as well as an enhancement in the visible light absorption (more than 550 nm in wavelength), compared to BVO. The enhanced visible light absorption is owing to the combination with CTS, and this enhancement increases with x. Furthermore, the band gap values of all the samples were estimated from the plots of (αhν)2vs. (hν) (Fig. 5b). As the value of x increased, the band gap of BVO@CTS-x gradually decreased from 2.41 eV for BVO to 2.23 eV for BVO@CTS-0.59. Both the reduction in the band gap and the enhancement in visible light absorption endow BVO@CTS-x with improved light harvesting capacity, compared to BVO, thereby generating more photoinduced electron–hole pairs to participate in photocatalytic reactions.

(d) Schematic diagram of the formation of the built-in electric field within BiVO4@Cu3SnS4. (e) PL spectra of the as-prepared BVO, BVO@CTS-x and BVO-CTS-0.19 m. (f) Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra (excitation wavelength: 450 nm) of BVO, CTS and BVO@CTS-0.19. 
Furthermore, the band positions of BVO and CTS were determined by measuring their Mott–Schottky (M–S) curves (Fig. S8†), XPS valence band spectra (Fig. S9†), and optical band gaps (Fig. S10†). After several calculations (the details for calculating the conduction band positions of BVO and CTS are provided in the ESI†), the conduction band positions of BVO and CTS could be estimated to be at 0.25 V and −0.70 V (vs. NHE), and the valence band positions of BVO and CTS were calculated to be at 2.66 V and 0.8 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The band alignment between BVO and CTS is illustrated in Fig. 5c. Consequently, constructing the heterojunction between Cu3SnS4 and BiVO4 can be speculated as follows. As illustrated in Fig. 5d, when the two semiconductors are combined with each other, the difference in their Fermi levels leads to the electron transfer from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4via the coherent interface formed between them. As a result, an upward bending occurs for the energy bands of Cu3SnS4, while the received electrons induce the energy bands of BiVO4 to bend downwards. As the Fermi levels of Cu3SnS4 and BiVO4 become equal, a dynamic equilibrium state for the charge transfer is achieved within the heterojunction, thus forming a space charge layer (built-in electric field). The direction of the built-in electric field is pointed from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4, which facilitates the electron transfer from BiVO4 to Cu3SnS4, thereby satisfying the requirement for the charge transfer of a direct Z-scheme heterojunction consisting of Cu3SnS4 and BiVO4.
The fluorescence emission spectra of the samples were recorded to investigate their charge recombination behavior. Both BVO (Fig. 5e) and CTS (Fig. S11†) have a strong fluorescence peak, meaning that severe charge recombination occurs in both. As for BVO@CTS-x, the fluorescence emission intensity decreased first and then increased with an increase in x, and BVO@CTS-0.19 showed the lowest emission intensity. The increase in the emission intensity with a further increase in x from 0.19 to 0.59 is probably due to the excess Cu3SnS4. This suggests that the charge recombination within the two semiconducting components can be effectively suppressed by constructing a heterojunction between them at a suitable mole ratio, especially with a coherent interface. The reason for this can be attributed to the built-in electric field (Fig. 5d), which facilitates the transfer of the photogenerated electrons at the conduction band of BiVO4via the coherent interface to combine with the photoinduced holes at the valence band of Cu3SnS4, thereby suppressing the charge recombination for both. Moreover, a sample, BVO-CTS-0.19 m, was prepared by mixing CTS and BVO at a mole ratio of 0.19 for comparison. Notably, the fluorescence peak of BVO-CTS-0.19 m is very close to those of both BVO (Fig. 5e) and CTS (Fig. S11†), but obviously higher than that of BVO@CTS-0.19. The obviously reduced emission manifests the superiority in suppressing charge recombination of the heterojunction with a coherent interface.
To further determine the lifetime of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs, the time-resolved PL decay spectra of BVO, CTS, and BVO@CTS-0.19 were recorded (Fig. 5f). The lifetime (τA) of BVO@CTS-0.19 is 3.75 ns, shorter than those of BVO (5.32 ns) and CTS (5.06 ns), owing to the transfer of the photogenerated electrons from BiVO4 to Cu3SnS4via the coherent interface, driven by the built-in electric field (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, note that τ1 and τ2 represent the non-irradiative recombination and inter-band recombination, respectively, and A1 and A2 are the corresponding amplitudes.32 Apparently, the decreases in both τ2 and A2 are found for BVO@CTS-0.19, suggesting the reduced inter-band recombination. These results reveal that the coherent interface within BVO@CTS-0.19 is conducive to improving the electron transfer efficiency, and thus the inter-band recombination can be effectively suppressed.
The photocatalytic performance of the prepared samples for degrading pollutants was evaluated, in which a relatively stable methyl orange (MO) and Cr6+ were selected as the target pollutants. Fig. 6a shows the photodegradation curves of MO over different samples. After irradiation for 90 min, the removal rate of MO is only 5.9% for BVO and 28.8% for CTS, indicating their poor photocatalytic performance for the degradation of MO. Notably, BVO@CTS-x samples exhibit higher photocatalytic activity compared to both CTS and BVO, suggesting that the construction of the BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 heterojunction does play a positive role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Specifically, as x increases from 0.11 to 0.19, the BVO@CTS-x samples show a gradual increase in the photocatalytic activity, and the removal rate of MO for BVO@CTS-0.19 is up to 98.4%. However, with further increasing x to 0.29 and 0.59, a decrease in the activity occurs. The dependence of the activity with x is close to that of the fluorescence emission intensity with x. This means that the charge separation efficiency is the key factor influencing the activity. Impressively, the removal rate of MO over BVO@CTS-m is only 11% after the irradiation for 90 min, which is just higher than that of BVO. This originated from its lack of a coherent interface for efficient electron transfer to suppress the charge recombination. Furthermore, the constant k, defined as ln(C0/C) = kt, was acquired from the plots of ln(C0/C) vs. t (Fig. 6b). The k values of BVO, CTS, and BVO-CTS-m are 0.0006 min−1, 0.0029 min−1, and 0.001 min−1, respectively. While, BVO@CTS-0.19 showed a high k value of 0.0457 min−1, 76.17 times than BVO, 45.70 times than BVO@CTS-0.19 m, 15.76 times than CTS, as illustrated in Fig. 6c. It should be mentioned that BVO@CTS-0.19 exhibits higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO than the previously reported BVO-based composite photocatalysts, as listed in Table S1.† Moreover, the mineralization degree of MO in the presence of BVO@CTS-0.19 was evaluated by measuring the total organic carbon. As shown in Fig. 6d, after the visible light irradiation for 90 min, the mineralization degree of MO reaches 95%, verifying the high activity of BVO@CTS-0.19. Besides, the stability in photocatalytic activity of BVO@CTS-0.19 was examined for the degradation of MO through a cycle test. After the 3 cycles, the decline in the degradation efficiency is negligible for BVO@CTS-0.19, and its structure was not changed (Fig. S12a–d†). These results reveal that BVO@CTS-0.19 possesses good stability in both photocatalytic activity and structure.

(h) Oxygen evolution rate of different samples and (i) comparison of the oxygen evolution rate of BVO and BVO@CTS-x. 
As for the photocatalytic reduction of Cr6+, BVO@CTS-0.19 shows good performance, and the removal rate is up to 99.7% after irradiation for 90 min (Fig. 6e). However, both BVO and CTS showed poor Cr6+ reduction performance. BVO@CTS-0.19 showed a high k value of 0.0634 min−1, 24.38 times that of CTS and 45.29 times that of BVO, as illustrated in Fig. 6f and Fig. 6g. Meanwhile, BVO@CTS-0.19 exhibits higher photocatalytic activity for the reduction of Cr6+ compared to the previously reported BVO-based composite photocatalysts, as listed in Table S2.†
Besides, the photocatalytic oxygen evolution yield of the prepared sample is shown in Fig. 6h. Oxygen evolution was not detected over CTS, even in the presence of the sacrificial agent. The main reason is that the valence band position of CTS is located at 0.81 V, more negative than that of the oxygen evolution potential (0.82 V) (Fig. 5c). Consequently, the holes in the valence band of CTS do not possess sufficient oxidizing capacity to produce oxygen. BVO can produce oxygen in the presence of the sacrificial agent, showing a yield of 659.2 μmol g−1 within 3 h. As for BVO@CTS-x, their oxygen evolution yields are higher than that of BVO. Specifically, as x is increased from 0.11 to 0.19, an increase in the oxygen evolution occurs, and the highest oxygen evolution yield, achieved by BVO@CTS-0.19, is 2318.6 μmol g−1 oxygen in 3 h. On further increasing x to 0.29 and 0.59, the oxygen evolution yields are 1674 μmol g−1 and 1034.2 μmol g−1, respectively, suggesting a gradual decrease. The dependence of the oxygen evolution with x is the same as that of the MO degradation performance with x. The oxygen production rate of BVO@CTS-0.19 was 778.3 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 3.44 times that of BVO (as shown in Fig. 6i). These results reveal that the combination with Cu3SnS4 obviously improves the photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity of BiVO4. It should be mentioned that BVO@CTS-0.19 exhibits higher photocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution than that previously reported for most BVO-based composite photocatalysts, as listed in Table S3.†
3.3. Z-Scheme identification of BVO@CTS-0.19
In order to identify the charge transfer route of BVO@CTS-0.19, the free radicals trapping experiments were conducted in the degradation of MO and the reduction of Cr6+ over BVO@CTS-0.19. Specifically, isopropanol (IPA), p-benzoquinone (P-BQ), silver nitrate (AgNO3), and ammonium oxalate ((NH4)2C2O4), were added in the two reaction systems, which were used as the hydroxyl radical (˙OH) superoxide radical (O2˙), electronic (e−) and hole (h+) scavengers, respectively. As seen in Fig. 7a, for the degradation of MO, the degradation efficiency decreases from 98.4% in the absence of any scavengers to 96.8% in the presence of the e− scavenger, indicating that the photogenerated electrons slightly affect the degradation of MO. While, when the O2− and ˙OH scavengers were added, the degradation efficiency decreased to 65.3% and 56%, respectively, suggesting the effects of the two radicals. Notably, a very low degradation efficiency was found when employing the (h+) scavenger, revealing that h+ plays a dominant role in photocatalytic degradation. As for the reduction of Cr6+ over BVO@CTS-0.19, only 15.6% reduction efficiency was found after adding AgNO3, while no decrease was found when (NH4)2C2O4 was added. It is revealed that the key active species are the photocatalytic electrons, rather than the holes. When the ˙O2− and ˙OH scavengers were added, the degradation efficiency decreased to 75.8% and 85.6%, respectively. These decreases could be attributed to the participation of the photogenerated electrons during the generation of ˙O2− and ˙OH.33,34

Furthermore, electron spin resonance (EPR) experiments were carried out using the DMPO and TEMPO trapping agents. According to the band positions of CTS and BVO (Fig. 5c), the reducibility of the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of BVO is not sufficient to generate superoxide radicals, while the oxidizing capacity of the holes in the valence band of CTS cannot oxidize water into hydroxyl radicals. For this reason, we conducted the superoxide radical capture for both CTS and BVO@CTS-0.19 and the hydroxyl radical capture for both BVO and BVO@CTS-0.19. As shown in Fig. 7b, in the dark environment, the superoxide radical signals are detected for neither CTS nor BVO@CTS-0.19. After the irradiation for 5 min, the superoxide radical signals are present for both, and the signal intensity of BVO@CTS-0.19 is significantly stronger than that of CTS. This indicates that the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of Cu3SnS4 were not transferred into the conduction band of BiVO4 in BVO@CTS-0.19 since the electrons at the conduction band of BVO did not have enough reducing ability to generate superoxide radicals. Moreover, as displayed in Fig. 7c, in the dark environment, the hydroxyl radical signals were detected for neither BVO nor BVO@CTS-0.19. After the irradiation for 5 min, the hydroxyl radical signals were present for both, and the signal intensity of BVO@CTS-0.19 was significantly stronger than that of BVO. This indicates that the holes in the valence band of BiVO4 were not transferred into the valence band of Cu3SnS4 in BVO@CTS-0.19 since the holes in the valence band of Cu3SnS4 do not have sufficient oxidizing ability to produce hydroxyl radicals. The above analyses suggest that the heterojunction formed between BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4 is the direct Z-scheme one, rather than the type II one.
Besides, in situ irradiation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to further verify the Z-scheme charge transfer for the BVO@CTS-0.19 sample. As shown in Fig. 8, under light irradiation, the binding energies of Cu 2p and Sn 3d shift towards lower energies, while those of Bi 4f, V 2p, and O 1s move to higher energies. These results imply an increase in electron density for CTS as well as a reduction for BVO, meaning that the photogenerated electrons prefer to migrate from BVO to CTS.35–38 Consequently, the photoinduced Z-scheme mechanism works for BVO@CTS-0.19, agreeing with the EPR results.

3.4 Enhancement mechanism in the photocatalytic performance of BiVO4@Cu3SnS4
In order to further elucidate why BVO@CTS-0.19 exhibits much better photocatalytic activity than both BVO and CTS, their photoelectrochemical properties were compared. As shown in Fig. S13a,† BVO@CTS-0.19 exhibits higher photocurrent response intensity than both BVO and CTS, resulting from its enhanced optical absorption and suppressed charge recombination. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to study the charge transfer property at the interface between the photocatalyst and electrolyte. The obtained EIS Nyquist plots and the corresponding simulated equivalent electrical circuit are shown in Fig. S13b,† where Rs and Rct are the electrolyte solution resistance and the interfacial charge-transfer resistance, respectively.39 The Rct values of the three samples are shown in Fig. S13b.† It was found that the charge transfer resistance is substantially decreased for BVO@CTS-0.19 compared with that for both BVO and CTS. The above results indicate that BVO@CTS-0.19 has better charge separation and migration properties, which can be attributed to its enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO, Cr6+ reduction, and oxygen evolution. Moreover, a comparison in surface areas was made for the three samples. Specifically, as shown in Fig. S14,† CTS has a relatively large specific surface area (40.78 m2 g−1) due to its flower-like structure. The specific surface area of BVO@CTS-0.19 is 26.30 m2 g−1, which is higher than that of BVO (12.33 m2 g−1) but less than that of CTS. These results imply that the specific surface area is not a critical factor affecting the photocatalytic activity.
Consequently, the enhanced mechanism in the photocatalytic activity of BVO@CTS-0.19 can be explained as follows. Among the three processes of, charge separation and transport, and surface reaction are revealed as the critical processes determining photocatalytic activity.40–43 Specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 9, the BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 heterojunction, constructed by growing Cu3SnS4 on the surface of the BiVO4 crystals using the hydrothermal method, was found to possess a coherent interface. The coherent interface favors the electron transfer from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4 owing to their different Femi levels, resulting in the formation of the built-in electric field with the direction from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4. Under this illumination, the BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 heterojunction was verified as a direct Z-scheme charge transfer. That is, the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of BiVO4 transfer via the coherent interface to the valence band of Cu3SnS4 to combine with the holes located there, thereby suppressing the inter-band recombination within both BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4. Consequently, the BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 heterojunction retains more photogenerated electrons with higher reducing ability at the conduction band of Cu3SnS4 and holes with larger oxidizing capacities at the valence band of BiVO4, for participating surface redox reactions.
 Fig. 9  Enhanced mechanism of photocatalytic activity for the BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 heterojunction with the coherent interface. 
As for the surface redox reactions, when the BiVO4@Cu3SnS4 heterojunction, BVO@CTS-0.19, is employed for the degradation of MO (Fig. S15a†), the holes are the key active species. Meanwhile, the superoxide free radicals and hydroxyl free radicals also have some effect on the degradation process. During the reduction of Cr6+, the photogenerated electrons are the key active species for reducing Cr6+ on the surface of BVO@CTS-0.19 (Fig. S15b†). That is, Cr6+ with higher toxicity is reduced to Cr3+ with less toxicity by the photogenerated electrons. For the O2 evolution since the valence band position of BVO is located at 2.67 V, more positive than the oxygen evolution potential, the holes in the valence band of the BiVO4 component of BVO@CTS-0.19 can oxidize water to produce oxygen (Fig. S15c†).
4. Conclusions
To sum up, a novel direct Z-scheme heterojunction with a coherent interface was constructed by combining BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4. The heterojunction presented as the deposition of Cu3SnS4 with a thin layer on the surface of each pre-prepared BiVO4 crystal by the heterogeneous nucleation. The coherent interface was formed through the bonding between O at the (121) plane of BiVO4 with Cu at the (112) plane of Cu3SnS4, thereby leading to the appearance of the Cu–O bond in the heterojunction. The built-in electric field was built through the charge transfer via the coherent interface within the heterojunction, in which, the field was pointed from Cu3SnS4 to BiVO4. Reduced fluorescence emission and a shortened carrier lifetime revealed the reduced inter-band recombination of the heterojunction. Consequently, BVO@CTS-0.19 showed obviously enhanced photocatalytic performance in the MO degradation, Cr6+ reduction, and oxygen evolution. The Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism was verified for the heterojunction formed between BiVO4 and Cu3SnS4 with the coherent interface, which allowed for more photogenerated electrons with higher reducing ability at the conduction band of Cu3SnS4 and holes with larger oxidizing capacity at the valence band of BiVO4 to participate in the surface redox reactions. This work presents a universal strategy for building a coherent interface to develop high-performance direct Z-scheme heterojunctions.
