    , Accepted 18th November 2020First published on 18th November 2020AbstractLead-based semiconducting organic–inorganic halides such as CH3NH3PbI3 are promising materials for optoelectronic applications. However, the toxicity of lead and the instability of these materials could raise environmental issues if they are applied on a large scale. Herein, two new 2D lead-free bimetallic iodide-based hybrid compounds are presented, namely (C12H30N4)Cs3BiI8 (CsBiI-1) and (C14H35N4)CsBiI7 (CsBiI-2), using different amines: C6H14N2 = cyclohexane-1,4-diamine (CDA) and C7H16N2 = 2-piperidinoethylamine (PDA). These two compounds show optical band gaps of 2.18 eV and 2.39 eV for CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2, respectively. Both materials yield high surface coverage films from spin-coating. Moreover, CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 are stable under moisture and present photocurrent responses. Thus, these materials have the potential for use in light detection.
Over the past decade, hybrid organic–inorganic halide materials have been widely investigated and have received great attention due to the discovery of their unprecedented photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties. Among these materials, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is the most notable one with power-conversion efficiencies (PCE) approaching 26% in just a few years.1 Nevertheless, the toxicity of lead, its poor stability against moisture/air and temperature remain the principal problems impeding its commercialization and wide-scale implementation.2–4
In the literature, many researchers used environmentally friendly divalent metal ions as a substitute for lead. However, these divalent metals such as Sn(II) or Ge(II), can be oxidized rapidly into Sn(IV) and Ge(IV), respectively, in air. Whereas for Mg2+ and Ba2+ the perovskite structure is unstable, and the band gaps of the Ca2+ and Sr2+ based compounds are too large due to the lack of lone pairs of electrons.5–7 As bismuth(III) also has a strong spin–orbit coupling effect and 6s2 lone pair electrons,8,9 it is generally believed to be an environmentally friendly alternative for lead. Moreover, it is also possible to use other environmentally friendly semimetal ions, such as In3+, Ga3+ and Cr3+ to replace lead. However, all these metal ions are formally trivalent, which cannot balance the additional charge of the Pb2+ when replaced. Hence, an effective method to solve this problem is to combine a monovalent cation, such as Ag+, Au+, Cu+, K+, or Ti+, which can compensate for the surplus charge of the trivalent metal ions.10–14
The fabrication of a bimetallic hybrid compound with a high PCE is still challenging. A few years ago, there was important progress in terms of the combination of a trivalent cation (MIII) and monovalent (MI) into this type of material. Many scientists reported various bimetallic hybrid compounds such as (CH3NH3)2TlBiBr6, (CH3NH3)2AgInBr6, (CH3NH3)2AgBiBr6, (CH3NH3)2KBiCl6, (CH3NH3)2KGdCl6 and (CH3NH3)2KYCl6.10–12,15,16 More recently, Seshadri and co-workers synthesized a series of lead free, new layered hybrid halides (chloride or bromide) with propylammonium (PA), octylammonium (OCA), and 1,4-butyldiammonium (BDA) cations. The band gaps of these materials vary from 2.41 eV to 3.96 eV,17 and these band gaps are too wide even for tandem solar cells.18 To obtain narrower band gaps, iodide analogues are preferred.
For iodide-based hybrid materials, there are just a few reports, which show interesting physical properties. In 2017, Han and co-workers synthesized ((CH3NH3)2AgBiI6) double perovskite with an indirect band gap of 1.96 eV.19 Then, in 2019 Bi et al. reported a 2D perovskite compound (C6H16N2)2[BiAgI8]·H2O (AgBiI) [C6H14N2 = 1,4-cyclohexane-diamine] and isolated the first Cu–Bi iodide hybrid 2D lead-free double perovskites (C6H16N2)2[BiCuI8]·1/2H2O (CuBiI) using a simple one-pot hydrothermal reaction. The optical band gap of AgBiI and CuBiI are determined to be 1.93 and 1.68 eV respectively.20 Deng and co-workers developed a mixed antimony-silver organic inorganic compound (CH3NH3)2SbAgI6 with a band gap of 1.93 eV. This hybrid material exhibits a high stability in ambient conditions (for 370 days).21 Very recently; a series of nine new layered double perovskite Cu–Bi and Ag–Bi halides with cyclic aliphatic amines were reported by the authors of this paper.14,22 These compounds showed narrow optical band gaps ranging from 1.53 eV to 2.02 eV and a strong photocurrent response between Ilight and Idark, indicating the potential application of these materials for light harvesting and for optoelectronic devices. Compared to MAPbI3, Cu–Bi and Ag–Bi materials are stable under temperature and moisture enabling their use in futuristic applications in the real world. Alternatively, substituting halogen with nitrate, Ye and co-authors reported 2D organic–inorganic hybrid rare-earth double perovskite ferroelectrics A4MIMIII(NO3)8, where A is the organic cation, MI is the alkaline metal or ammonium ion, and MIII is the rare earth ion. These ferroelectrics have achieved high-temperature ferroelectricity and photoluminescent properties.23
The previous discussions indicate that this field of interest has only just started in the last few years and is still in its infancy. There is still a lot of development to do in this area. In this present paper, for the first time two 2D Cs(I)/Bi(III) bimetallic iodide hybrid materials, namely (C12H30N4)Cs3BiI8 (CsBiI-1) and (C14H35N4)CsBiI7 (CsBiI-2) using two different amines: C6H14N2 = cyclohexane-1,4-diamine (CDA) and C7H16N2 = 2-piperidinoethylamine (PDA). Both compounds show semiconducting behavior with band gaps of ca. 2.18 eV and 2.39 eV for CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2, respectively, and can be easily processed into pin hole free, smooth thin films using a spin-coating procedure. Furthermore, the photocurrent measurements conducted under xenon lamp irradiation indicate their obvious photoresponse, suggesting that these materials possess potential as semiconductor hard radiation detector materials.

CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 were grown using a hydrothermal method in which stoichiometric amounts of cesium iodide, bismuth iodide and CDA or PDA in a concentrated hydroiodic acid (HI) were added and the mixture was kept for six hours at 160 °C (see ESI† for details).
It should be mentioned here that measuring single crystals at 298 K and 150 K gave the same results and because the resolution at 150 K was better, the structures described next are those obtained using the low temperature data. Structural analyses revealed that CsBiI-1 belongs to the orthorhombic system with a space group of Ibam (Table S1, ESI†). The structure of CsBiI-1 consists of infinite inorganic 2D [Cs3BiI8]2− layers separated by organic (NH3C6H10NH3)22+ cations (Fig. 1a). The layered structure for CsBiI-1 is derived from surface sharing [BiI6], [CsI4] and [Cs2I4] building units (Fig. 2a). As seen from Fig. 2a and Fig. S1a (ESI†), there are two crystallography independent Cs(I) atoms which exhibit different coordination environments: one has a [Cs2I4] coordination environment and the other displays a [CsI4] coordination environment. For Cs1, each cesium atom shares four-coordinating I atoms with the Cs–I bond lengths varying between 3.8613 (14) Å and 4.4273 (12) Å. Whereas the Cs2 atom is bonded to four I atoms with an equal Cs2–I bond length of 4.3460 (17) Å (Table S2, ESI†). The bond distances of Bi–I range from 3.0550(8) to 3.0654(6) Å.

 Fig. 2  Perspective views of the 2D inorganic structures of CsBiI-1 (a) and CsBiI-2 (b). The colors are used to indicate the following: bismuth: violet, iodine: pink, and cesium: clear green. 
The Ieq–Bi–Ieq (eq refers to equatorial) range from 87.97 (3)° to 92.03 (3)° and the Iax–Bi–Iax (ax refers to axial) angles are exactly 180.0°, indicating that they are slightly distorted from the ideal octahedron.
Using PDA to replace CDA, the complex CsBiI-2 is generated. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal that CsBiI-2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system at 150 K, with a space group of P21/c. The asymmetric unit of CsBiI-2 is shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†), and the crystallographic data are listed in Tables S1 and S3 (ESI†). The structure of CsBiI-2 consists of 2D inorganic layers of [CsBiI7]3− separated by the organic (C14H35N4)3+ cations (Fig. 1b). The inorganic 2D structure for CsBiI-2 is derived from one bridge shared between one independent [BiI6] octahedron and one tetrahedron [CsI4] (Fig. 2b). The geometry of the [BiI6] octahedron is characterized by a range of Bi–I bond lengths from 3.0467 (9) to 3.1239 (8) Å and corresponding I–Bi–I angles ranging from 88.03 (2)° to 178.83 (2)° (Table S3, ESI†). These Bi–I bond lengths are closer to the sum of the ionic radii of iodide and bismuth(III) (ri = 2.2 + 1.03 = 3.23 Å) rather than to that of their covalent radii (re = 1.39 + 1.48 = 2.87 Å), proving that these bonds are ionic in nature. The coordination environment of the Cs(I) ion involves four iodides forming a tetrahedron geometry [CsI4], with the Cs–I bond distance ranging from 3.4008 (11) Å to 4.4801 (12) Å and the I–Cs–I bond angles varying between 64.067 (16)° and 141.151 (19)°, indicating a distorted tetrahedron.
The CDA and PDA show a regular spatial configuration with normal values of C–C and C–N bond lengths varying from 1.480 (13) Å to 1.55 (13) Å, whereas C–C–C, C–N–C and C–C–N angles range between 108.9 (8)° and 114.6 (8)° (see Tables S2 and S3, ESI†). Moreover, CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 exhibit many intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the cationic and [Cs3BiI8]2− or [CsBiI7]3− anions of the type N–H⋯I and C–H⋯I listed in Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†).
The purities of the two materials were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses, and the results were consistent with the curves simulated by the single crystal structures (Fig. S2, ESI†).
In order to obtain a better understanding of intermolecular interactions within the crystal structure of CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2, Hirshfeld surface analyses and finger prints of crystals were performed using CrystalExplorer using the results of X-ray studies.24 The Hirshfeld surface mapped with dnorm is displayed in a red–white–blue scheme, indicating the intermolecular contacts: shorter (red), around (white), and longer (blue) than the van der Waals separation (Fig. S3, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3a and b, three remarkable spikes represent the most significant interactions of CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 and are located between Cs⋯H, H⋯H and H⋯I according to the red area on the Hirshfeld surface, which is consistent with the observation in single crystal structural analyses. Other intermolecular contacts such as Cs⋯I (4.9% for CsBiI-1 and 2% for CsBiI-2), C⋯H/H⋯C (1% for CsBiI-1 and 0.4% for CsBiI-2) contribute less to the Hirshfeld surfaces and were also calculated for the title compounds (Fig. 3c and d).

Importantly, CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 are highly soluble in dimethyl formamide (DMF). A volume of 2 ml of DMF can dissolve more than 1 g of the compounds. Using the spin coating method, 40 mg of CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 single crystals were dissolved in 1 ml of DMF and coated on ITO glass.
The obtained film annealed at 75 °C for 10 min, was then cooled at room temperature. Details of the preparation can be found in the ESI.† Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of surface morphology are shown in Fig. 4a, b and d, e demonstrate that the thin films of CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 are smooth, pinhole free and cover the entire substrate with an average grain size of ∼700 and ∼1200 nm for CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2, respectively. It clearly shows the uniform, regular and compact nature of the CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 thin films. Moreover, the cross-sectional images in Fig. 4c and f revealed that the films had the thicknesses of ∼350 nm for CsBiI-1 and ∼450 nm for CsBiI-2. Fig. 4h and g show that the XRD patterns of the CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 films agree well with the patterns generated from the single crystal data. The XRD spectrum for the film of CsBiI-1 shows a strong (002) reflection and that for CsBiI-2 shows a principal reflection of (020), which reveals the vertical growth of the compound on the substrate.

To estimate whether CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 are suitable for light-absorbing applications, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were used to determine the optical band gap. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance data of the solid-state samples were measured and converted to absorbance using the Kubelka–Munk function (Fig. 5a).25,26 The absorption band edges of CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 at 566 nm (2.18 eV) and 518 nm (2.39 eV), respectively, are similar to most of the Bi-based organic–inorganic compounds previously reported.18,27–30 As shown in Fig. S4a and b (ESI†), using direct and indirect fitting scenarios, the optical band gap of CsBiI-1 was estimated to be 2.20 eV (direct) and 2.13 eV (indirect) and that of CsBiI-2 was estimated to be 2.46 eV (direct) and 2.35 eV (indirect), obtained from the intercepts of the curves of (F(RN)hν)1/n (n = 2 or n = 1) versus the energy according to the Tauc equation.31 Interestingly, these materials can be coupled with silicon as has been demonstrated for CH3NH3PbBr3 (Eg = 2.26 eV) used as the absorber for a tandem solar cell.32 The absorption peaks of the thin films, CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 were also determined to be 556 nm (2.23 eV) and 514 nm (2.41 eV), respectively, (Fig. 5b), both a bit higher than those of the powder samples, which may due to the scattering and is in agreement with Mie theory.33–35

To complement the experimental results, first-principle simulations of CsBiI-2 were performed to determine the nature of the electronic states in the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) near the band gaps. As shown in Fig. 5c, the VBM and CBM are both situated at the G point, revealing a direct band gap with relatively flat band edges. It is important to note that the energies at the G and D point are near the conduction and valence bands, signifying that the electrons are localized along the G–D direction. The calculated energy is 2.68 eV which is in good agreement with the experimental results (see previously). The projected density of states (DOS) more clearly shows the lack of the Cs orbital role despite the presence of Cs–I liaisons (Fig. 5d and Fig. S5, ESI†), as the VBM of CsBiI-2 is dominated by I-p states with some contribution from Bi-s orbitals, whereas the CBM are predominantly contributed to by Bi-p and I-p states.
The photoconductivities of CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 were measured using pellet samples. Under 11 V bias-voltage and irradiation from a 350 W solar-simulating xenon lamp, the I–V curve presents a linear relationship for both samples (Fig. 6a and b). Both CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 show similar photocurrent responses. For CsBiI-1 the photocurrent increases from <4.8 nA (dark) to <21.5 nA (photocurrent), whereas for CsBiI-2, the photocurrent is enhanced from <1.7 nA (dark) to <17.2 nA (photocurrent) (Table 1). The photocurrent presented a stable and reproducible response, which could be observed for various consecutive on–off cycles at ambient conditions (Fig. 6c and d), suggesting that these materials have potential for light detecting applications.

To study the stability of both CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 towards moisture, as-synthesized powders and films of CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 were stored in the dark at 55% relative humidity for 7 and 30 d. Afterwards the PXRD patterns show the powder and the film samples of CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 remain almost the same as those of the freshly prepared samples (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). Hence, these two materials are very stable and robust in moisture when compared to MAPbI3.36
Conclusions
In conclusion, two new 2D lead-free bismuth/cesium based organic–inorganic hybrid materials were isolated. These two compounds show semiconducting features, with Eg = 2.18 eV for CsBiI-1 and Eg = 2.39 eV for CsBiI-2. The DFT calculations show no band edge contribution from the Cs orbitals. Moreover, crystals of CsBiI-1 and CsBiI-2 can be readily processed into smooth thin films using one-step spin coating. Both samples exhibit prompt photocurrent responses and high stability under moisture, indicating the possibility for use in light detection applications.
