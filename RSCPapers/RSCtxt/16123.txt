    , Accepted 29th December 2015First published on 29th December 2015AbstractTwo D–A copolymers PThBDTD and PTTBDTD with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDTD) as the acceptor unit and thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the donor unit were developed. They have medium optical bandgaps, deep HOMO levels, broad absorption and good hole mobilities. PThBDTD:PC71BM and PTTBDTD:PC71BM solar cells gave power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 6.32% and 6.00%, respectively.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells1 usually contain two components, a conjugated polymer or a small molecule as the electron donor and a fullerene derivative, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), as the electron acceptor. D–A copolymers with an alternating electron-donating unit (D) and an electron-accepting unit (A) have been widely used in BHJ solar cells. High-performance D–A copolymers possess: (1) suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels for high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and efficient exciton dissociation; (2) broad absorption to match the solar spectrum for high short-circuit current (Jsc); (3) suitable solubility for processing and a favorable nanostructure in the active layer.2 Currently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for single junction BHJ cells have reached 10.8%.3
Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDTD)4 and its derivative benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD)5 have been used as the acceptor units for developing efficient D–A copolymers (Fig. 1). In 2011, Li et al. reported D–A copolymers based on naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione and achieved a PCE of 5.21%.6 In 2012, we developed BDTD4avia replacing the benzene ring of naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione with a thiophene ring. After that, Hou et al. reported benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),5a and its copolymer PBT1 gave a PCE of 6.88%. Recently, Huo et al. reported a new copolymer PDBT-T1 by using BDD as the acceptor unit and dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene as the donor unit, and PDBT-T1:PC71BM solar cells gave a high PCE of 9.7%.5b BDTD-based copolymers gave a PCE of 5.91%,4b and their photovoltaic performance needs further improvement. Thiophene (Th)7 and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT),8 as excellent donor units, have been widely used in constructing high-performance D–A copolymers. Thus, two D–A copolymers PThBDTD and PTTBDTD were developed by using BDTD as the acceptor unit and thiophene or TT as the donor unit (Fig. 2). By introducing two 3-(2-butyloctyl)thiophenes as the π-bridges, PThBDTD and PTTBDTD possess good solubility in toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, etc. PThBDTD:PC71BM and PTTBDTD:PC71BM solar cells gave PCEs of 6.32% and 6.00%, respectively.

The synthetic routes for the monomer and the copolymers are shown in Scheme 1, and the details for synthesis and characterization are provided in the ESI.† The starting material 5,7-dibromo-2-(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (1) was synthesized according to the literature.4a Stille coupling of tributyl(4-(2-butyloctyl)thiophen-2-yl)stannane and compound 1 gave compound 2 in 72% yield, which was then brominated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to give monomer 3 in 84% yield. Finally, copolymers PThBDTD and PTTBDTD were obtained by copolymerizing compound 3 with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene or 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, respectively. As estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as the standard and tetrahydrofuran as the eluent, the number average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI) of PThBDTD and PTTBDTD are 12.2 kDa and 1.51, and 17.9 kDa and 2.08, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the polymers were thermally stable with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss in nitrogen) of 380 °C for PThBDTD and 384 °C for PTTBDTD (Fig. S5†).

The absorption spectra for PThBDTD and PTTBDTD in chloroform and as thin films are shown in Fig. 3, and the optical data are listed in Table 1. In solution, PThBDTD and PTTBDTD showed absorption peaks (λmax) at 534 nm and 572 nm, respectively. While in the solid state, obvious red-shifts of the absorption spectra for two copolymers were observed with absorption peaks at 580 nm and 602 nm, respectively, which is due to the strong π–π stacking in the solid state. The absorption onsets for polymer films are located at 721 nm and 770 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.72 eV for PThBDTD and 1.61 eV for PTTBDTD, respectively. Compared with PThBDTD, PTTBDTD exhibited red-shifted absorption in both solution and solid state, which might be due to the stronger electron-donating capability of TT and possible stronger π–π stacking of PTTBDTD.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to investigate the electrochemical properties of the two polymers (Fig. S6† and Table 1). The oxidation onset potentials (Eonox) of PThBDTD and PTTBDTD were 0.78 and 0.63 V, respectively. According to the empirical formulae: HOMO or LUMO = −(Eonox or Eonred + 4.8) eV,9 the HOMO energy levels of PThBDTD and PTTBDTD were calculated to be −5.58 eV and −5.43 eV, respectively. PThBDTD has a lower HOMO level than that of PTTBDTD, which may lead to a higher Voc for the solar cells. Higher HOMO of PTTBDTD results from the stronger electron-donating capability of TT. PThBDTD and PTTBDTD showed the reduction onset potentials (Eonred) of −1.41 V and −1.42 V, corresponding to the LUMO energy levels of −3.39 and −3.38 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgaps for PThBDTD and PTTBDTD are 2.19 and 2.05 eV, respectively.
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the polymers, the conventional solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PThBDTD:PC71BM/Ca/Al were first fabricated. The best cells gave a PCE of 5.28%, with a D/A ratio of 1:1.0 (w/w), and an active layer thickness of 114 nm, by adding 2 vol% DIO additive into chlorobenzene solution (Tables S1–S3†). In order to further improve the efficiency, inverted cells with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PThBDTD:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. After systematic optimization, the PThBDTD cells achieved a PCE of 6.32% with a Jsc of 10.81 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.88 V and a fill factor (FF) of 66.2%. The photovoltaic properties of PTTBDTD were also studied via optimizing PTTBDTD:PC71BM inverted solar cells (Tables S5–S7†). The best cells, with a D/A ratio of 1:1.0 (w/w), and an active layer thickness of 113 nm, by adding 2 vol% DIO into chlorobenzene solution, gave a PCE of 6.00%, with a Jsc of 14.53 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.73 V and a FF of 56.5%. The J–V curves for the best cells are shown in Fig. 4a and the performance data are summarized in Table 2. The higher Voc of PThBDTD:PC71BM cells results from the deeper HOMO level of PThBDTD. The higher photocurrent from the PTTBDTD:PC71BM cell was confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The PTTBDTD cell shows a wider EQE spectrum (Fig. 4b), corresponding to the wider absorption spectrum of PTTBDTD. Besides, the PTTBDTD cell shows higher EQE at 398–860 nm than that of the PThBDTD cell and exhibits >60% EQE at 500–682 nm. The integrated currents from the EQE spectra are 10.61 and 14.06 mA cm−2 for PThBDTD and PTTBDTD cells, respectively.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the morphology of polymer:PC71BM blend films (Fig. S7†). After adding 2 vol% DIO, the RMS roughness for PThBDTD:PC71BM and PTTBDTD:PC71BM blend films increased from 0.60 nm and 2.28 nm to 10.40 nm and 6.45 nm, respectively. DIO might decrease the miscibility between the polymers and PC71BM. As a result, the blend films containing DIO in this work present a much rougher surface, which is quite different from other blend films.10 For both PThBDTD and PTTBDTD cells, after adding 2 vol% DIO, Jsc and FF increased remarkably (Tables S3 and S7†), which might result from the optimization of phase separation. More D/A interfaces and a favourable 3D transporting passage for the free charge carriers might build up, though it is difficult to get detailed information from the phase images. Hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al) were made to obtain the hole mobilities of the polymers. The mobilities were obtained by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier space-charge limited current (SCLC) (Fig. 5), which is described by  where J is the current density, μ is the zero-field mobility of holes (μh), ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, d is the thickness of the blend film, and V is the effective voltage. PThBDTD and PTTBDTD possess hole mobilities (μh) of 1.28 × 10−4 and 1.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Compared with thiophene unit, TT unit might improve π–π stacking and charge carrier hopping, thus increasing the hole mobility.11 The wider absorption spectra and higher hole mobility of PTTBDTD help to generate higher photocurrent.

PThBDTD and PTTBDTD films were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 6). Compared with the PThBDTD film, the PTTBDTD film shows a stronger peak at 2θ = 4.50° (corresponding to a lamellar d-spacing of 19.6 Å) and a stronger peak at 2θ = 24.15° (corresponding to a π–π stacking d-spacing of 3.68 Å). PTTBDTD possessed a shorter π–π stacking d-spacing than that of PThBDTD (2θ = 23.43°, corresponding to a π–π stacking d-spacing of 3.79 Å), indicating a stronger π–π stacking. The better crystallinity (reflected by the 4.50° peak) and π–π stacking of PTTBDTD lead to a higher hole mobility and a higher Jsc.

Conclusions
Two D–A copolymers PThBDTD and PTTBDTD were developed by using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione as the acceptor unit, thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the donor unit, and two thiophenes with side chains as the π-bridges. PThBDTD has a deep HOMO level of −5.58 eV, producing a higher Voc of 0.88 V. PTTBDTD possesses a broad absorption, a better crystallinity, and a higher hole mobility, giving a higher Jsc of 14.53 mA cm−2. PThBDTD:PC71BM inverted solar cells gave a PCE of 6.32%, which is slightly higher than that of PTTBDTD:PC71BM cells. Further work to use the BDTD acceptor unit to develop highly efficient D–A copolymers is under way.
