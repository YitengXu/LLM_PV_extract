    , Accepted 15th January 2019First published on 16th January 2019AbstractSb-Doped nanocrystalline SnO2 (SnO2:Sb) thin films functionalized with cyclometalated ruthenium complexes 1 or 2 on FTO conductive glasses have been prepared and characterized. These complexes contain a redox-active amine unit separated from the ruthenium ion by a phenyl or biphenyl linker, respectively, to modify the absorption wavelengths at different redox states. Near-infrared electrochromism of both films has been examined by oxidative spectroelectrochemical measurements and double-potential-step chronoamperometry. A contrast ratio (ΔT%) of 33% at 1070 nm and 63% at 696 nm has been achieved for the SnO2:Sb/1 film in two stepwise oxidation processes, respectively. The other film with complex 2 shows two-step electrochromism at 1310 and 806 nm with ΔT% of 36% and 76%, respectively. The response time of electrochromic switching is around a few seconds. Taking advantage of the good contrast ratio, the rapid response, and the long retention time of each oxidation state, these films have been successfully used to demonstrate surface-confined flip-flop memory functions with a high ON/OFF ratio.
Introduction
Nanocrystalline metal oxide films modified with redox- and photo-active molecular materials are widely used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)1 and photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPECs).2 These films can be readily prepared by a simple soaking process. They have good film stability, large surface area, and high dye loading. The interfacial properties of these films can be largely modulated by the combination of different metal oxide substrates and different dye molecules. These appealing features make metal oxide-dye films useful for other applications beyond solar energy conversions.3
Electrochromism is an electrochemically or electrically driven phenomenon accompanied by reversible spectral and color changes.4 Thin films showing high-performance electrochromism are useful in smart windows, information storage, electronic displays, and dynamic camouflage.4,5 Basic requirements for promising electrochromic films include the easy film fabrication, high dye loading, high coloration efficiency, high contrast ratio (ΔT%), short response time, and long-term cyclic stability. In addition to spin coating and electropolymerization,6 metal oxide–dye films stand out as promising platforms to realize high-performance electrochromism.7–9 For instance, electrochromic films of nanocrystalline TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2 films anchored with redox-active viologen derivatives,7 organic amine compounds,8 or transition metal complexes9 have been reported.
In conjunction with the recent interest in electrochromism based on metallopolymeric films,10 our efforts focus on the near-infrared (NIR) electrochromic materials that are potentially useful in optical telecommunications for signal transduction and switching.11 In particular, a series of metallopolymeric films based on cyclometalated ruthenium complexes have been prepared to show electrochromism in an absorption spectral range from 1000 to 2500 nm.12 In a very recent example, we have reported the electrochromism of two ruthenium-amine conjugated complexes 1 and 2 adsorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2 films (Fig. 1).13 Both films exhibit promising two-step electrochromism in the NIR region. The intense NIR absorptions arise from the charge transfer transitions of these complexes due to the high degree of conjugation between the ruthenium component and amine unit. A contrast ratio of around 40% was achieved for the FTO/TiO2/1 film at 1000 and 680 nm in the single- and double-oxidation process, respectively. The FTO/TiO2/2 electrochromic film shows a higher contrast ratio of around 60% at 1300 and 780 nm. These films could be readily prepared and they have good film stability. However, one drawback of these films is that the response time is rather long, typically of the order of a few tens of seconds. This severely hampers their further applications.

In order to shorten the response time of the above electrochromic films, we decided to use the nanocrystalline Sb-doped SnO2 (SnO2:Sb) substrate to prepare thin films of 1 and 2. Compared to nanocrystalline TiO2, SnO2 is a better electron acceptor as its conduction band is about 0.5 V lower in energy (−4.3 eV vs. vacuum for TiO2; −4.8 eV for SnO2) and has a ca. one-hundred times larger electron diffusion coefficient with respect to TiO2.14 These properties are beneficial for efficient electron collection from the adsorbed complexes and make SnO2 attractive for fast-response electrochromism. The conductivity of SnO2 nanocrystallines can be further enhanced by Sb-doping.15 High-performance electrochromism has been reported on SnO2:Sb films functionalized with ruthenium complexes or organic dyes.8,16 However, known examples do not show multistep NIR electrochromism and their further applications in other optoelectronic fields have not been examined. We present herein the electrochromic performance of the nanocrystalline SnO2:Sb thin films modified with complexes 1 or 2 and their comparison with the previously reported TiO2 films.13 In addition, the application of the nanocrystalline SnO2:Sb thin films in mimicking flip-flop logic gate functions is demonstrated.
Results and discussion
Film preparation and characterization
The SnO2:Sb colloidal solution and nanocrystalline thin films were prepared according to the published procedure.15 To prepare dye-anchored films, fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass covered with a thin layer of SnO2:Sb was fabricated (see details in the Experimental section). The thickness of the nanocrystalline layer is around 1.5 μm and the particle size is around 5–10 nm in diameter, as shown in the SEM pictures in Fig. 2. The film has a surface dimension of 0.8 × 1.5 cm2. This FTO/SnO2:Sb electrode was immersed in a solution of 1 or 2 in DMF (0.3 mM) at room temperature for 12 h to give the FTO/SnO2:Sb/1 and FTO/SnO2:Sb/2 films for subsequent measurements.

The presence of the ruthenium compounds 1 and 2 in these films was confirmed by XPS analysis (Fig. 3), which shows the Ru 3d5 signal at 280.6 and 280.7 eV for FTO/SnO2:Sb/1 and FTO/SnO2:Sb/2 films, respectively. The Sb/Sn atomic content ratio is 0.11 for both films. The observed Ru/N ratio is 0.12 and 0.11 for the films of 1 and 2, respectively, which is relatively smaller with respect to the theoretical value of 0.17 (1/6). This is possibly caused by the low intensity of the Ru 3d5 signal.

Electrochemical measurements
The above-obtained thin films were investigated by cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in CH3CN (Fig. 4). They show two well-separated redox waves at around +0.34 and +0.73 V vs. Ag/AgCl for SnO2:Sb/1 and two more closely spaced waves at +0.60 and +0.73 V for SnO2:Sb/2, respectively. The peak currents are linearly dependent on the scan rate (Fig. 4b and d), which is typical of surface-confined diffusionless redox behavior. The two redox couples are ascribed to the oxidations of the ruthenium and triarylamine components of 1 and 2.17 The wider potential separation of 1 with respect to 2 is partially caused by the stronger electronic coupling of the former complex. Based on the charge integration of each redox wave, the electrochemical surface coverage (Γechem) of these films was estimated to be around 2.9 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for SnO2:Sb/1 and 1.4 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for SnO2:Sb/2, respectively. The reason for the surface coverage difference between these two films is not clear at this stage (both films were prepared under the same conditions). The slightly bigger size of 2 might be partially responsible for the relatively lower coverage of the resulting film.

Spectroelectrochemical measurements

Fig. 5 shows the visible and NIR (vis-NIR) absorption spectral changes of the FTO/SnO2:Sb/1 film recorded during the in situ oxidative spectroelectrochemical measurements in CH3CN. When the applied potential was stepwisely increased from +0.20 to +0.56 V in the single-oxidation step, an intense charge transfer absorption band at 1070 nm appeared. Because the absorption spectral changes in the visible region are not significant, the color change of the film is not very distinct (from purple to gray brown). When the potential was further increased to +0.83 V in the double-oxidation step, the NIR band at 1070 nm decreased gradually and the appearance of a new intense absorption band at 696 nm was observed. The latter band is mainly attributed to an aminium radical cation-localized absorption.17 The color of the film changed from gray brown to blue in the double-oxidation step. These two-step processes are totally reversible. Similar absorption spectral changes were previously observed during the spectroelectrochemical measurements of the film of 1 on the TiO2 substrate.13
 Fig. 5  Vis-NIR absorption spectral changes of the FTO/SnO2:Sb/1 film upon stepwise oxidative electrolysis from (a) +0.20 to +0.56 V and (b) from +0.56 to 0.83 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M nBu4NClO4/CH3CN. The inset shows that the film color changes upon stepwise oxidation. The dimension of the film is around 0.8 × 1.5 cm2. 
Based on the observed absorbance of the film, the optical surface coverage of SnO2:Sb/1 (Γabs) was estimated to be 3.4 × 10−8 mol cm−2 by Γabs = A1070/(ε1070 × 1000),18 where A1070 was taken to be the absorbance difference of the film at 1070 nm between the original and the singly-oxidized state (0.36) and ε1070 to be the molar extinction coefficient of a trimethyl ester precursor of 1 at 1070 nm (10500 M−1 cm−1).17 The calculated Γabs value of SnO2:Sb/1 is in good agreement with the above-mentioned electrochemical surface coverage (Γechem = 2.9 × 10−8 mol cm−2). This situation is significantly different from the previous result on the TiO2 substrate, where Γechem of 1 is more than one order of magnitude smaller with respect to Γabs.13 This difference is believed to be caused by the different conduction mechanisms of the dye on different substrates. In TiO2/1 films, the conduction mechanism is dominated by the lateral charge transfer (hole hopping process; TiO2 is not directly involved) initiated at the FTO substrate,19 in which only a small fraction of the adsorbed dyes are electrochemically conductive within the time frame of CV measurements. However, SnO2 has a much lower conduction band edge than TiO2 and the conduction mechanism of the SnO2/1 film is believed to be dominated by the charge transfer between the dye and SnO2.14,15 In this sense, all adsorbed dyes on SnO2 substrates should be electrochemically conductive. The same situation applies to the film of 2 as discussed below.
The FTO/SnO2:Sb/2 film shows two redox waves at +0.60 and +0.73 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 4c). Spectroelectrochemical measurements show similar two step absorption spectral changes, albeit at slightly different wavelengths (Fig. 6). The optical coverage of SnO2:Sb/2 was estimated to be 1.7 × 10−8 mol cm−2 by Γabs = A1310/(ε1310 × 1000),18 where A1310 was taken as the absorbance difference of the film at 1310 nm between the original and the singly-oxidized state (0.20) and ε1310 as the molar extinction coefficient of a trimethyl ester precursor of 2 at 1310 nm (11900 M−1 cm−1).13 The Γabs of SnO2:Sb/2 is also close to its electrochemical coverage (1.4 × 10−8 mol cm−2). Fig. 6 shows that a ligand-to-metal (amine to ruthenium(III)) charge transfer band at 1310 nm appears during the single-oxidation step and the color of the film changes from purple to brown. During the double-oxidation step, this charge transfer band decreases and a new aminium radial cation band at 806 nm appears.

The inset shows that the film color changes upon stepwise oxidation. The dimension of the film is around 0.8 × 1.5 cm2. 
Electrochromic switching
The NIR electrochromism of the FTO/SnO2:Sb/1 film was then investigated by double-potential-step chronoamperometry accompanied by monitoring the transmittance changes at 1070 or 696 nm (Fig. 7). During the single-oxidation step, the applied potential was switched between +0.20 and +0.56 V. In this process, a best ΔT% of 33% at 1070 nm was acquired (Fig. 7a–c). The coloration efficiency (CE) for this process was calculated to be 109 cm2 C−1, according to the equation CE(λ) = log[Tb/Tc]/Qd, where Qd is the injected/ejected charge density (C cm−2) and Tb and Tc are the transmittance in the bleached (with low NIR absorbance) and colored (with high NIR absorbance) states at the indicated wavelength. During the double-oxidation process (Fig. 7d–f), a best contrast ratio of 63% has been achieved at 696 nm with a CE of 420 cm2 C−1. During the single-oxidation step, the response time needed to reach 90% of the maximum contrast ratio is around 1.9 s for the coloring process (tcolor) and 2.3 s for the bleaching process (tbleach), respectively (Fig. 7c). In the double-oxidation step, the tcolor and tbleach is 3.2 and 3.5 s, respectively. The response time of the FTO/SnO2:Sb/1 film is significantly shorter with respect to the previous film on the TiO2 substrate, which is around a few tens of seconds for the single- and double-oxidation step, respectively.13 A comparison of the electrochromic parameters of the films on the SnO2:Sb or TiO2 substrate is summarized in Table 1.

The FTO/SnO2:Sb/2 film also shows two-step electrochromism. Double-potential step chronoamperometry indicates that the SnO2:Sb/2 film displays a best contrast ratio of 36% at 1310 nm (CE = 122 cm2 C−1) at the single-oxidation step and 76% at 806 nm (CE = 438 cm2 C−1) at the double-oxidation step, respectively (Fig. 8 and Table 1). The response time is around a few seconds for both steps. Again, the response of 2 on the SnO2:Sb substrate is much faster with respect to that on TiO2 (Table 1).

(b, c) Transmittance changes at 1310 nm. (e, f) Transmittance changes at 806 nm. The response time is estimated by the time range of the indicated blue rectangle in (c) and (f). 
By comparing the data of four films in different substrates (Table 1), it seems that the films on TiO2 show slightly higher ΔT in the single-oxidation step; while in the double-oxidation step, the films on SnO2:Sb yield higher ΔT and CE. This comparison however should be used with discretion. The film thickness is different in two cases (around 4 μm for TiO2 films and 1.5 μm for SnO2:Sb films), which will lead to different surface coverage and ΔT values. Further optimizations of the ΔT and CE values of both films are possible. However, the comparison of the response time of different films does make a sense. The films on the SnO2:Sb substrate clearly show a much shorter response time with respect to those on TiO2. As was stated earlier, this improvement is caused by the better conducting properties and lower conduction band of Sb:SnO2, which allows electrons to tunnel easily in either direction between the adsorbed electroactive species and the conduction band.14–16
The above SnO2:Sb/2 film displays a contrast ratio of 36% at 1310 nm with a few seconds of response time, which makes it potentially useful as an optical attenuator in telecommunication.20 The wavelength at 1310 nm was selected to be measured because common silicon optical fibers have the lowest energy loss at this wavelength. Previous studies mainly focus on the NIR electrochromism at 1550 nm, which is another lowest-energy-loss wavelength of the silicon optical fiber.20 To date, the electrochromic performance at 1310 nm has been measured only for limited examples. For instance, Zhang and co-workers reported the electrochromism of lutetium phthalocyanine at 1300 nm with a contrast ratio of less than 10%.21 The electroactive pentacenediquinone-containing organic polymers reported by Wan and Wang show electrochromism at 1310 nm with a contrast ratio of less than 10% and a response time of a few tens of seconds.22 A number of other materials have been shown to display electrochromism in a similar wavelength region.11,23 However, electrochromic parameters have not been given at specific wavelengths.
Cyclic stability and retention time
The appealing electrochromic properties of the above films, in particular the significantly-shortened response time by immobilizing the ruthenium dyes on the SnO2:Sb substrate, prompted us to further test their electrochromic performance. The cyclic stability of both films was probed by monitoring the transmittance changes upon 1000 continuous double-potential-switching cycles (Fig. 9). After 1000 cyclic scans between +0.20 and +0.56 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the ΔT% at 1070 nm of the FTO/SnO2:Sb/1 film decreased from 34% to 29% (decreased by 15%). For the FTO/SnO2:Sb/2 film, a contrast decrease from 25% to 22% was observed (decreased by 12%) at 1310 nm after 1000 cyclic scans between +0.40 and +0.62 V. These data suggest that these films have good cyclic stability. As shown in Fig. 9, the transmittance at the transparent state of both films essentially remains constant upon cyclic switching. The decrease of the contrast ratio is mainly attributed to the attenuation of the transmittance at the colored state (the state with higher NIR absorbance). This is possibly caused by the decomposition of a small amount of dyes upon long-term switching.

Retention time is another important parameter for electrochromism, which refers to the capability of the film to maintain the present redox state when the power is switched off. Electrochromic films with a long retention time are appealing for memory applications. In contrast to metallopolymeric films with a retention time of a few tens of min,24 we previously found that electrochromic films made of cyclometalated ruthenium complexes usually exhibit long retention due to their low redox potentials.25 The retention time of the FTO/SnO2:Sb/1 and FTO/SnO2:Sb/2 films at different redox states was measured (Fig. 10). The redox states at +0.20 and +0.56 V for FTO/SnO2:Sb/1 and +0.40 and +0.62 V for FTO/SnO2:Sb/2 are all stable states. When the potential was switched off, the contrast ratio remains essentially unchanged after more than 30 min. The highest redox states of both films (+0.83 V in both cases), however, have a relatively short retention time of less than 10 min. The oxidized forms could be reduced by the solvent or the environment.

Mimicking flip-flop logic gate
A flip-flop logic gate is a binary logic circuit with memory functions built from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates (Fig. 11). The mimicking of a flip-flop logic gate needs two input signals and two output signals with a relatively long retention time, representing memory functions.26 Taking the FTO/Sb:SbO2/2 film as an example, the electrochemical potential at +0.62 and +0.83 V was used as the input 1 and 2 signals (In1 and In2), which was treated as the erase and write process, respectively. The transmittance at 806 and 1310 nm was taken as the output 1 and 2 signals (Out1 and Out2). Fig. 11 shows the input and output signal changes during the repetitive write–read–erase–read cycles. In each cycle, the electrochemical input was applied for 4 s, and the potential was then switched off for reading. Due to the long retention time of the film at different redox states, the output signal remains essentially constant during the read process (the read process lasted for 10 s). When In2 at +0.83 V is applied, the Out1 at 806 nm is high. The input and output strings are 0 1 and 1 0, respectively. In contrast, when In1 at +0.62 V is activated, the Out2 at 1310 nm is high. The input and output strings become 1 0 and 0 1, respectively. Note that, at the same time, only one input signal can be applied for the flip-flop logic gate operation. When the input string is 0 0 with no potential being applied, the output signal is retained at the previously memorized state. The ON/OFF ratio (the ratio between the high and low transmittance) is around 7.1 and 1.7 for Out1 and Out2, respectively. The fast response and long retention time of the FTO/Sb:SbO2/2 film are critical for the successful mimicking of the flip-flop logic gate operation.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the electrochromism of two ruthenium-amine conjugated complexes adsorbed on nanocrystalline Sb-doped SnO2 films has been investigated. These films display two-step redox processes at low potentials and NIR electrochromism with a good contrast ratio and coloration efficiency, indicating their potential applications in optical telecommunications. The response time has been shortened to a few seconds from a few tens of seconds of the previous films adsorbed on the TiO2 substrate.13 The high conducting properties and low conduction band energy of SnO2:Sb are believed responsible for this improvement. These films display good cyclic stability and long retention time at each readily accessible oxidation state, which provides an excellent molecular platform to mimic the surface-confined flip-flop operations. Further investigations of these films in applications such as information storage and photoelectric conversions will be performed in due course.
