    , Accepted 23rd March 2023First published on 18th April 2023AbstractThe transition from centralized electricity generation to distributed electricity, such as fuel cell power plants, is one of the promising strategies for decarbonization in the energy sector. However, the operation of hydrogen fuel cells could be problematic because liquefaction or compression processes for hydrogen storage are energy intensive and require high maintenance costs. In addition, if hydrogen in fuel cell-based power plants is supplied via natural gas steam reforming, direct carbon emissions to the atmosphere are caused. Therefore, this study investigates an ammonia-based electricity generation system through the sequential conversion of ammonia to hydrogen and hydrogen to power. This system can replace inefficient and costly hydrogen storage with the existing infrastructure of ammonia and reduce carbon emissions by using ammonia instead of hydrocarbon feedstock. With an ammonia price from the conventional production way, the system shows an electricity generation price in the range of 0.227–0.261 USD per kW h and a carbon intensity of 0.80–1.44 kgCO2-eq per kW h which are not feasible at present. Because ammonia price and emissions during production are the most significant factors for the feasibility of the system, five different scenarios considering various ammonia production pathways are established. Based on the scenario analysis, the feasible conditions and countries in terms of both economic and environmental aspects are identified. In the most optimistic scenario, the electricity generation price and carbon intensity are calculated to be 0.134–0.150 USD per kW h and 0.16–0.28 kgCO2-eq per kW h respectively, and the system can be competitive in 40 countries out of 134 countries.
1. Introduction
The transition from a conventional fossil-fuel-based economy to a clean energy society has been accelerated as abnormal climate changes threaten humankind. According to a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), electricity generation from solar photovoltaics has soared during a decade, from 32.2 TW h in 2010 to 1002.9 TW h in 20211, and remarkable growth has also been observed in electricity generation based on wind power. The cost hurdles for this energy have been overcome with technological development and massive investment. For example, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for photovoltaics rapidly declined from 0.417 USD per kW h to 0.048 USD per kW h (for newly commissioned utility-scale solar PV projects) over the same period, which corresponds to an 88% reduction.2 Accordingly, it is expected that decarbonization in the energy sector, which emits approximately 73% of global greenhouse gas emissions,3 can be achieved. However, after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, coal consumption strongly rebounded during the global economic recovery and was close to an all-time high global consumption.4 The shift towards power generation using coal implies that the global economy still heavily relies on fossil fuels, although installed renewable energy capacities in 2021 reached approximately 3064 GW worldwide.5
Besides the pandemic and the surge of natural gas prices driving the rebound to carbon-intensive electricity generation, renewable energy has the natural limitations of intermittency as well as seasonal and regional variations. The limitations restrict the power output from renewable energy, resulting in restricted curtailment rather than restricting base loads such as centralized and nuclear power plants. Inaccessible regions still have no choice other than the conventional electricity grid.6 To deal with the major problems of utilizing renewable energy, power-to-gas technology which enables the storage of renewable energy in the form of chemical energy has been emerging as a powerful solution.7 With surplus electricity that renewable energy produces excessively over the demand, hydrogen (H2) can be produced by electrolysis. Hydrogen shows a high energy content (120 MJ per kg) on a mass basis compared to other fossil fuels (e.g. gasoline has 44 MJ per kg)8 and solely emits water when it generates power in a fuel cell, so that hydrogen can store excess electricity and provide energy to regions inaccessible to renewable energy sources through transportation.9 However, the hydrogen economy faces several critical issues in terms of storage and transportation. It is challenging to store hydrogen in an energy-efficient way and it is mainly stored through either high-pressure compression (350–700 bar) or cryogenic liquefaction around −253 °C, with a relatively low volumetric energy density. Moreover, the most economically favorable way to produce hydrogen is steam reforming of methane,10 and some hydrogen fuel cell plants utilize natural gas infrastructure to supply feedstock of hydrogen, which means those systems still inevitably emit approximately 7–11 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kg hydrogen during natural-gas-based hydrogen production in general.11
Ammonia (NH3) is considered an efficient hydrogen carrier due to several beneficial properties. It has a high content of hydrogen (17.7 wt%) and a non-cryogenic boiling point of −33.4 °C at atmospheric pressure, which enhances the storage and transportation efficiency. Ammonia also has a higher volumetric energy density of 4.04 kW h per L compared to liquefied hydrogen (2.36 kW h per L) or high-pressure hydrogen (1.31 kW h per L).12 According to a 2019 analysis by the IEA,13 ammonia can be cheaper than high-pressure hydrogen gas for transmission distance above 3500 km. Additionally, transportation through ammonia can compete with other chemical forms of hydrogen carriers and domestic production of hydrogen in terms of cost. Ammonia itself can be used as a nearly zero-emission fuel through internal combustion engines, gas turbines, and fuel cells,14 despite having a relatively low heating value of 18.8 MJ per kg.15 As a result, many institutes and corporations in Europe and Japan are developing ammonia gas turbines and direct fuel cells to utilize ammonia as a clean fuel.16
Concerning the beneficial characteristics of ammonia, it has the potential to improve the efficiency and economy of storing and transporting hydrogen to distributed power plants. Ammonia can also be used as feedstock for hydrogen production in fuel-cell-based power plants, replacing liquefied natural gas. Ammonia decomposition generally requires a lower reaction temperature than the conventional steam reforming of natural gas,17 resulting in lower carbon emissions from the heat energy supply. Moreover, ammonia can be utilized as a sustainable fuel to supply heat in the decomposition unit. Therefore, hydrogen production based on ammonia decomposition has been extensively researched and many catalysts have been investigated to reduce the reaction temperature, increase the activity, and improve the stability.18 Among the several promising candidates for active materials, ruthenium-based (Ru) catalysts are the most active, and many support materials and promoters for the metal have been studied. Additionally, nickel-based catalysts (Ni) have been highlighted as competitors with the highly active ruthenium metal in terms of catalyst price.
While ammonia has several beneficial characteristics that improve the storage and transportation of hydrogen, only a few research works have systematically investigated the impacts of catalyst type and reaction temperature on the economic and environmental performances of an ammonia conversion system. Similarly, research on electricity generation based on ammonia has mainly focused on injecting ammonia into a gas turbine19 or a solid oxide fuel cell20 for direct use of ammonia as an energy source. However, gas turbines are typically used in centralized power plants and ammonia fuel cells still require technological development due to their low stability. But distributed electricity generation can be an alternative for remote areas with limited access to electricity21 and can reduce the energy waste during transmission and distribution.22 Therefore, this study proposes an ammonia-based distributed electricity generation system and classifies the system as several cases depending on the type of catalyst (ruthenium-based or nickel-based) for an ammonia decomposition reaction, the corresponding reaction temperature, and the fuel type (hydrocarbon, ammonia, and a mixture of them). The cases are comprehensively studied using process simulation, techno-economic analysis (TEA), and carbon footprint analysis to calculate the cost of the product (i.e., LCOE) and carbon intensity. Additionally, a parametric sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the most significant parameters. Based on the results of the sensitivity analysis, the best and worst scenarios are established and scenario analysis is carried out. The results of the scenario analysis are visualized on the world map to determine the regions where the proposed electricity generation system is economically and environmentally competitive.
2. Methods
2.1. System and case description
In this study, a distributed power generation system based on the Ammonia-to-Hydrogen-to-Power (A2H2P) conversion was investigated. The A2H2P system generates electricity through the sequential conversion of ammonia to hydrogen and hydrogen to power and the capacity was targeted at 1 MW. The system boundary was set from ammonia production to electricity generation in a fuel cell as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  A system boundary diagram of this study. 
The overall procedure of the A2H2P system involves several steps. Firstly, ammonia is cracked to produce hydrogen. Next, a mixture of unreacted ammonia, produced hydrogen, and nitrogen is purified. The purified hydrogen is then fed into a hydrogen fuel cell, where electricity is generated. Finally, heat energy is supplied based on combustion. Ammonia from its storage tank passed several pre-heaters and ammonia was converted to hydrogen as expressed in eqn (1).
A mixture of ammonia, hydrogen, and nitrogen is compressed and headed to the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit, which is one of the most widely used separation technologies for hydrogen and is suitable for the separation of the gas mixtures. The hydrogen separated from the PSA unit is then used in the hydrogen fuel cell and electricity is generated by a chemical reaction (eqn (2)).23 In this study, the hydrogen fuel cell is assumed to be a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which is a commercially used fuel cell.24 (1) (2)
To comprehensively investigate the potentially promising power generation system, several cases classified based on the catalyst type and reaction temperatures were considered. Depending on the active metal in an ammonia-cracking catalyst such as ruthenium and nickel, an operating window of reaction temperatures is correspondingly determined. The catalysts and cases in this study are tabulated in Table 1.

The case number is classified depending on the catalyst type, and the subcase number is determined according to the fuel type, which could be hydrocarbon, a mixture of hydrocarbon and ammonia, or ammonia alone. The reason for classifying fuel is to compare the current (Subcase 1), intermediate (Subcase 2), and future (Subcase 3) cases by varying the portion of the zero-carbon fuel. Because the ammonia decomposition reaction is endothermic, higher the reaction temperatures generally result in higher ammonia conversion rates. However, the fuel required to supply sufficient heat energy should also be considered. This case study can provide critical insights because research on ammonia decomposition in terms of technical, economic, and environmental aspects is rarely touched.
2.2. Techno-economic analysis
First, the targeted process is designed using Aspen Plus® (V12) which is a widely used commercial chemical process simulator. Depending on the operating temperature and conversion of the reactant, process flowsheets are slightly different between the cases as shown in the Aspen flow sheet (Fig. S1†). A detailed description of the overall process is provided in ESI Note 1.† The parameters and assumptions used in the process design are presented in Table S1† and an explanation of the process unit used in the Aspen Plus flowsheet including the block type and input specification is given in Table S2.† For the PSA unit, the amount of adsorbed hydrogen and impurities is determined based on the experimental equations as presented in Fig. S2.†
The economic performance of the system is evaluated using the net present value (NPV) through a cumulative discounted cash flow diagram (CDCFD), and a comparison between the cases is made in terms of the LCOE, which considers the total expenses during a system's lifetime of electricity generation. To create a CDCFD and calculate the LCOE, the fixed capital investment (FCI) and the cost of manufacturing (COM) should be determined first. FCI can be calculated based on equipment capital expenses (CapEx), which is typically a function of capacity, operating pressure, and materials of construction.29 In this study, CapCost 2017, a free costing program,29 is used to estimate equipment costs in the proposed system. The effect of inflation on CapEx is considered using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI) and the year 2019 is used as the base year. The COM mainly includes raw materials, utilities, operating labor, consumables, and so on. In the proposed A2H2P system, the raw material is ammonia, the utilities are electricity consumption in electrical equipment and fuel consumption, and the operating consumables are the ammonia-cracking catalysts and adsorbents for ammonia and nitrogen in the PSA unit. The lifetime of the catalysts and adsorbents is assumed to be a year. In general, the cost of raw materials is the primary cost in a chemical process. In particular the ammonia price is inevitably significant in the A2H2P system because the raw material naturally includes the production cost of the intermediate (hydrogen). A detailed explanation of the economic analysis is provided in ESI Note 2† and the economic parameters used in this study are presented in Table S3.†
2.3. Carbon footprint analysis
The environmental impacts of generating electricity in the system are evaluated by calculating the carbon dioxide emissions per produced energy of 1 kW h, which is expressed as carbon intensity in kgCO2 equivalent per kW h (kgCO2-eq per kW h). The potential emission sources in the system include emissions during ammonia production, direct emissions from fuel combustion, indirect emissions from grid electricity for electrical equipment, and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the fired heater. The emissions during ammonia production are dependent on the raw materials and energy sources used, and are therefore considered in a scenario analysis. Direct emissions depend on the subcase, and are expected to increase when a hydrocarbon is used as a sole fuel due to carbon stoichiometry. However, fuels with a high content of ammonia can reduce direct emissions while increasing nitrogen oxide emissions. For electricity consumption, grid electricity is assumed to be purchased with a global average carbon intensity value of 0.475 kgCO2-eq per kW h (ref. 30). The total carbon dioxide emissions are the sum of all potential emissions, and are compared with the national carbon intensity values in different countries to assess the environmental feasibility of the system and viable operating conditions.
2.4. Parametric sensitivity and scenario analyses
A sensitivity analysis was carried out to account for operational variations in the processes, economic analysis uncertainties, and potential future improvement. The impact of several economic parameters on the LCOE was investigated, and the most significant parameter was identified. To examine various ammonia production pathways and production costs, five different scenarios were established (Table 2). Scenario 1 presents current ammonia production (Haber–Bosch) and the decade-average value of ammonia price. In this scenario, it is assumed that only hydrocarbon fuel is used to supply heat energy. Scenarios 2 and 4 include ammonia production based on fossil fuels, but equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS). As a result, carbon dioxide emissions are lower than in Scenario 1 but the costs become 50% to 10% greater, respectively. On the other hand, Scenarios 3 and 5 consider renewable-based ammonia production, which is one of the near-zero-emission technologies.

The carbon intensity and LCOE of each case in the scenarios were calculated and compared to the global average carbon intensity and electricity price (between the 25th and 75th percentiles) to ensure the feasible operating conditions. Furthermore, a comparison between a set of national electricity prices and carbon intensity in 134 countries and LCOE in the best possible scenarios was made to identify the regions where the electricity generation system can be successfully operated in terms of both economic and environmental aspects.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Technical and environmental performance

Fig. 2 shows the results of process design and carbon footprint analysis in terms of energy efficiency and carbon intensity of the cases calculated based on eqn (3) and (4). (3) (4)where EOut,FC is the power generated by the PEMFC, EIn,FS is the chemical energy from feedstock (ammonia), EIn,Fuel is the chemical energy by fuel, and EIn,Elec is the energy required in electrical equipment. Note that all energy is represented in kW and all chemical energy is calculated based on the lower heating value (LHV) and mass flow rate of chemical species i. Fi is the mass flow rate and GWPi is the global warming potential of species i. Subscripts prod., dir. and indir. refer to carbon dioxide emissions during production and direct and indirect emissions, respectively.
 Fig. 2  Results of technical performance in the cases in terms of (a) energy efficiency and (b) carbon intensity for electricity generation in the system and (c) proportion of sources for carbon dioxide emissions. 
It is observed that the energy efficiency decreases as the reaction temperatures increase (Fig. 2a). This is because the reaction is endothermic and requires more fuel as the reaction temperatures increase. Also, the utilization of heat energy in flue gas, which might have sufficient heat energy to generate energy, is not considered in this work (i.e., waste of heat energy increases as the reaction temperatures increase). In terms of the subcases, energy efficiency tends to decline when the portion of ammonia in the fuel stream increases (higher number in the subcases). Because ammonia has a lower LHV than the hydrocarbon fuel (isobutane), a higher amount of total fuel is needed to satisfy the heat energy requirement in the reaction resulting in a lower energy efficiency in the system. The trend in carbon intensity is opposite to the one in energy efficiency as shown in Fig. 2b. It is noticeable that carbon dioxide emissions during ammonia production account for the greatest portion regardless of the reaction temperature and fuel type. As the reaction temperatures increase, the carbon intensity increases mostly because more ammonia as fuel is required increasing emissions during ammonia production (Fig. 2c). In conclusion, it is favorable for the reaction to proceed at a lower temperature in terms of energy efficiency and carbon intensity. However, there is a trade-off between energy efficiency and carbon intensity concerning which fuel is used; a higher heating value of the hydrocarbon fuel is beneficial in terms of energy efficiency but it emits a greater amount of carbon dioxide. The mass flow rates of the raw material and fuel by component are presented in Fig. S3.†
3.2. Levelized cost of electricity
The economic performance in terms of LCOE in the A2H2P system with several cases is evaluated and compared with the global household electricity prices.
The NPVs for each case and subcase are provided in Fig. 3 for several electricity prices ranging from the minimum to the maximum values in global household electricity prices. It is observed that only the maximum electricity price of 0.4120 USD per kW h results in a profitable A2H2P system, regardless of the reaction temperature. The LCOE of the systems ranges from 0.227 to 0.261 USD per kW h for Cases 1-2, 2-2, 3-2, and 4-2. Interestingly, even though Case 1-2 has a higher energy efficiency than Case 2-2, the LCOE is lower due to the lower COM resulting from the higher conversion rate of ammonia. The CapEx increases as the reaction temperature increases due to higher construction of material costs, but this is offset by lower COMs in some cases.
 Fig. 3  (a) Net present values from each case using global household electricity prices for Cases 1–4 and (b) comparison between the levelized cost of electricity for all cases and 25%–75% of global household electricity prices; all cases in (a) correspond to subcase 2. 
The gap between the 25th and 75th percentile of global household electricity prices and the LCOE in the A2H2P system can be identified in Fig. 3b. It can be observed that all the calculated LCOEs in the A2H2P system, using the current ammonia production pathway and corresponding price, are unable to compete with recent global household electricity prices. Therefore, it can be concluded that the current technical and economic parameters in the TEA must be improved to make the A2H2P system competitive with the global household electricity prices.
3.3. Critical economic parameters
A parametric sensitivity analysis was conducted to verify the critical economic parameters in the proposed A2H2P system. The results of the sensitivity analysis, for Case 1-2 only, in terms of economic parameters are presented in Fig. 4. For the economic sensitivity, Case 1-2 is selected as a representative case and other cases are presented in Fig. S4.† It is observed that the order of importance of economic parameters is as follows: ammonia price, discount rate, CapEx estimation level, and so on.
 Fig. 4  Results of sensitivity analysis for the levelized cost of electricity in the proposed system (Case 1-2) in terms of economic parameters. 
3.4. Feasibility of each scenario
The results of LCOE and carbon intensity for each scenario, based on the established scenarios, are presented in Fig. 5. In general, Case 1 shows the lowest carbon intensity, whereas Case 2 presents the lowest LCOE in each scenario. Considering that ammonia price is the most significant economic factor and the process operates at a moderate reaction temperature, the lowest LCOE is observed in Case 2, even though the lowest quantity of ammonia is required in Case 4.
 Fig. 5  Comparison of the scenarios in terms of carbon intensity and levelized cost of electricity. 
In Scenario 1, all investigated cases are far above the global average household electricity price and are not environmentally feasible compared to the global average carbon intensity, meaning that the proposed A2H2P system does not always compete with the conventional electricity generation methods. The same is true for Case 4 in Scenarios 2 and 3. However, for Cases 1, 2, and 3, most cases are acceptable in terms of environmental aspect due to the utilization of CCS and renewables. Nevertheless, Cases 1–3 are still not feasible, considering the high ammonia production costs (585.0, 447.5, and 429.0 USD per tNH3 for Cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively). It is apparent that only Scenario 5, which assumes the clean ammonia production pathway with a low production cost, can reach the feasible region.
To visualize the regions in the world where the A2H2P system could be economically and environmentally feasible in the future, the regions where the LCOE and the carbon intensity in the proposed system (Case 2 in Scenario 5) are lower than the reported values of each nation (134 nations) are identified. The difference between the electricity price and the LCOE in the system is visualized in Fig. 6 for countries where the system is viable. As expected from the previous results of the scenario analysis, it is hardly achievable for the system to compete with current electricity generation methods due to either ammonia price or carbon dioxide emissions. Despite a reduction in emissions during production, the system is viable only in nine and twelve countries (Scenarios 3 and 4), respectively, due to the relatively high cost of the raw material. However, if a low production cost of ammonia is attained, the number of countries where the system is feasible becomes approximately triple (40 countries), as presented in Fig. 6b.
 Fig. 6  (a) Feasibility of electricity generation based on the ammonia-to-hydrogen-to-power system in terms of electricity price in the world (Scenario 5) and the number of feasible countries (b) by continent and (c) by carbon reduction scenario in each country. 
As the global carbon intensity is expected to decline for carbon neutrality, changes in the number of feasible countries with reduced carbon intensity in each nation are presented in Fig. 6c based on assumptions of 25% and 50% reduction. In Scenario 5, the total number of feasible countries reduces to 38 and 22 when a 25% and 50% emission reduction is achieved in each nation, respectively, implying that the system could be utilized as a bridge technology for electricity generation in some regions.
4. Conclusions
This study comprehensively investigated the A2H2P system based on process simulation, economic analysis, and carbon footprint analysis depending on the catalyst type and the corresponding reaction temperature. The results of the techno-economic and environmental assessment were then used to carry out parametric sensitivity and scenario analyses to identify the most influential parameters on the technical and economic performance of the system and the feasible operating window. Finally, the feasibility of the A2H2P system was verified in terms of cost and carbon emissions for electricity generation by comparing it with 134 countries.
All of the investigated cases demonstrate even higher carbon intensity values than the global average of 0.475 kgCO2-eq per kW h, mainly due to the substantial carbon dioxide emissions that occur during ammonia production. Furthermore, the emission of another greenhouse gas, NOx, is also significant and is identified as the second greatest emission source. From an economic standpoint, all of the base cases are deemed unfeasible in terms of LCOE due to the relatively high cost of ammonia, considering that ammonia is a synthetic chemical from fossil fuels.
In order for the proposed A2H2P system to be competitive, it was found that both ammonia price and reduction in carbon emissions during its production are significant factors. To investigate how the system can become economically and environmentally viable, five different scenarios were established based on different ammonia production pathways. The results of the scenario analysis showed that ammonia from conventional ammonia production is not suitable for this system in terms of both economic and environmental aspects. For short-term future scenarios (Scenarios 2 and 3), carbon intensity can be significantly lowered by using CCS and near-zero-emission technology. However, the ammonia production cost is still high, making it difficult to achieve an economic benefit. In Scenario 5, ammonia-based electricity generation becomes competitive with electricity from other sources when ammonia prices and emissions during production are low.
The comparison of the proposed system with approximately 140 countries, in terms of electricity price and carbon emissions for generating electricity, indicates that the system (Case 2 in Scenario 5) will be viable in 40 countries in the future. The transportation of ammonia was not considered in this study as it falls outside of the system boundary, which is focused on evaluating the feasibility of the system worldwide. Furthermore, the study did not take into account the capacity of renewable energy, the cost and capacity of ammonia production using renewable electricity, and the demand for distributed electricity in each country. Therefore, future research work should expand the system boundary to consider these factors to achieve carbon neutrality, including the ammonia production capacity, demand for ammonia-based electricity generation, and the supply chain of ammonia.
