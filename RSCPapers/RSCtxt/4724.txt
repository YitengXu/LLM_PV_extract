        Ru(II) heteroleptic complexes as photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are presented. The article outlines design strategies, synthetic routes, optical and photovoltaic properties of ruthenium dyes based on polypyridines as ancillary ligands containing π-conjugated electron-rich heteroaromatic groups. The integration of donor heteroaromatic substituents, typically thiophene-based moieties, strongly improves the optical properties of the sensitizers in terms of bathochromic and hyperchromic shift compared to prototypical dyes N3 and N719. These favorable properties in turn yield DSCs with superior light harvesting abilities, higher external quantum efficiencies, improved device photocurrents, and top-ranked power conversion efficiencies. In combination with excellent stabilities under thermal stress and light soaking, this class of DSC photosensitizer has great potential for practical applications.Alessandro AbbottoAlessandro Abbotto was born in Milano, Italy.

1. Introduction
Global energy needs are predicted to grow by a factor of three to four in the next few decades, making the exploitation of clean and renewable sources a priority of our modern society. The Sun is one of the most efficient supplies of energy to match future demand if we consider that the total solar power striking the planet surface is over 150000 TW, 4 orders of magnitude larger than world power consumption.1–3 Therefore, capture of sunlight has attracted an increasing interest in the scientific community and triggered the development of efficient and cheap photovoltaic (PV) materials and devices in academia and industry. Green4 and others have classified PV technologies according to three generations. The first generation is based on mono- and polycrystalline silicon and constitutes approximately 90% of the present PV market. Although very efficient and stable in the long-term, first generation PV are too expensive and not yet competitive with fossil fuels. A second generation PV, based on thin film technologies, has been developed in order to cut costs and produce cheap and reliable PV technologies. Third generation organic and hybrid PV cells now hold the promise of even lower costs and easier manufacturing processes. Unfortunately, their smaller efficiencies and limited stability have so far prevented widespread industrialization and commercialization.
Amongst new generation thin film PV technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) possess one of the most promising potentials in terms of cost-performance trade-offs.5 The pioneering work by O'Regan and Graetzel in 19916,7 sparked the development of a new generation of efficient hybrid cells now entering the PV market. The sensitizer dye which captures the sunlight likely plays the most strategic role of the whole PV process. The homoleptic Ru(II) complexes bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) 1 (N3),8 and its bis(tetrabutylammonium) salt 2 (N719),9 are the most representative DSC sensitizers, with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 11% (Fig. 1). The 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate (dcbpy) ligand has the function of anchoring, through the carboxylic functionality, the complex to the TiO2 nanoparticle surface in order to promote an efficient electron injection from the sensitizer to the n-type conductor oxide. These Ru(II) complexes present π → π* intraligand transitions in the UV region and two t2 → π* metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands in the near UV and Vis region (Fig. 2A).8 The low-energy absorption peak of N3 is 534 nm with a molar absorption coefficient ε of 14200 M−1 cm−1.8 Unfortunately, the limited absorption to the UV-Vis portion of the solar spectrum and its low molar absorptivity represent a serious limitation if one considers that almost half of the solar emission extends to the near-IR (NIR) range of the electromagnetic radiation. The mismatch between the light harvesting properties of the dyes and the AM 1.5 solar emission (Fig. 2B) has so far hindered a solid progress of the DSC technology in terms of energy conversion efficiencies, which have leveled off to the unsurpassed value of approximately 11%. In addition, although accelerated tests have shown the ability to enter the market, the long term stability under thermal stress and light soaking for N719-based cells and modules is not optimal yet and has prevented widespread practical applications.10,11 However, it should be stressed that a number of pilot production activities for commercialization of DSC technology have now started or are underway.5c

In order to circumvent these drawbacks, researchers have started to design substituted polypyridine ligands for heteroleptic complexes in order to improve photophysical properties and, eventually, light harvesting abilities and PV efficiencies. Sensitizers with enhanced absorption properties are compatible with thinner TiO2 films for optimal photocurrent densities and reduced recombination losses. A successful approach consisted of replacing one of the two dcbpy anchoring ligands in N3 or N719 with an ancillary ligand carrying an electron-rich donor benzenoid substituent, such as in the alkoxystyryl derivatives 3 and 4, for improved properties (Fig. 3).11,12 The extension of the π-conjugated framework of the bipyridine (bpy) core induced a bathochromic and hyperchromic shift of the MLCT transitions (Table 1). This in turn resulted in improved light harvesting properties and higher photocurrent densities. The most common structure of the new Ru(II) heteroleptic complexes is represented by the general formula A, where two types of bpy ligands are present: one anchoring ligand for grafting to TiO2 and one ancillary ligand for tuning of additional properties arising from the presence of the conjugated substituent X (Fig. 4). After the first benzenoid derivatives,11,12 it was apparent that an efficient molecular design for new polypyridine ligands was based on the π-conjugation with X units containing electron-rich five-membered heteroaromatic rings.

 Fig. 4  Formal conversion of the prototypical homoleptic complex N3 to the heteroleptic complex A. 
The strong π-donor character of these heteroaromatics13,14 has been successfully exploited for the preparation of many heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes with improved optical properties and overall energy conversion efficiencies up to 11%. This contribution will outline representative classes of Ru(II) sensitizers based on polypyridine ligands carrying π-excessive five-membered rings as conjugated substituents of the polypyridine coordinating core. We will classify the sensitizers on the basis of the coordinating fragment and of the conjugated substituent, with focus on the structural design, synthetic approach, optical properties, and PV performance. The presentation of the sensitizers is organized in order of increasing structural complexity and not in a chronological order following the publication time. This work should not be meant as a comprehensive review on the topic. For this scope the reader is encouraged to refer to the recently published reviews on DSCs.5 The presented sensitizers are consecutively numbered in the manuscript along with their short names or acronyms as reported by the authors. As a method of choice, sensitizers which have been exclusively described in patents will not be considered.
2. Photovoltaics and operational principles of DSCs
A few basic concepts of DSCs and photovoltaics will now be introduced. A DSC is a multi-component device comprising: a) a dye-sensitizer S; b) a n-type semiconductor metal oxide (typically TiO2); c) a p-type semiconductor or a redox electrolyte (typically the I−/I3−redox couple); d) a transparent working anode and a counter electrode (based on fluorine-doped tin oxide, FTO) (Fig. 5). In a typical cell assembly15 one or more mesoporous layers (ca. 10 μm) of transparent 20-nm and/or scattering 350–450-nm titania nanoparticles are deposited on a previously cleaned transparent FTO conducting glass sheet. After sintering, the FTO-TiO2 substrates are immersed into a solution (10−3–10−4 M) of the sensitizer for ca. 20–24 h. A Pt counter electrode is prepared by depositing a drop of a 10−2–10−3 M alcoholic solution of H2PtCl6 and firing to ca. 400–450 °C so to leave a thin layer of Pt catalyst. The dye-coated working electrode and the Pt counter electrode are then assembled in a sandwich type cell. After sealing with a hot-melt ionomer-class resin (e.g., Dupont Surlyn®), the liquid electrolyte is introduced by vacuum backfilling via a pre-drilled hole. Under light irradiation the sensitizer S is promoted to its excited state S* from which an electron injection into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 takes place, leaving the dye in its oxidized state S+. The collected electrons at the photoanode are then transferred through the external load to the counter electrode where, viaPt catalysis, reduce triiodide to iodide which, in turn, regenerates the sensitizer (S+ → S). If a p-type semiconductor is used in place of the electrolyte, dye-regeneration occurs via hole-transfer from S+ to the HOMO of the hole transporter. A DSC is a very efficient scheme where, formally, one photon is converted to one electron with no chemical change, in principle allowing an unlimited number of cycles. In addition to the main processes, a number of undesired pathways and losses are present including recombination of injected electrons from TiO2 to either S+ or the oxidized form of the electrolyte, incomplete light harvesting, and inefficient electron transfer from S*. The main source of loss-in potential of a DSC is the high overpotential needed to regenerate the dye, which strongly limits the maximum attainable photovoltage (see Fig. 5).16
 Fig. 5  Left: scheme of a dye-sensitized solar cell (dye energy levels refer to N719). Right: Current–voltage characteristics under light irradiation. 
The performance of a DSC, or in general of a PV cell, is determined by measuring the overall power conversion efficiency η (sometimes referred to as PCE) from the ratio of maximum output power density (Pout, in W m−2) and the input light irradiance (Pin, in the same units) (eqn (1)). Under standard reporting conditions the light intensity Pin is 1000 W m−2, the sun spectrum is AM 1.5 G,17 and the sample temperature is 25 °C.18,19 According to the Shockley-Queisser model the maximum theoretical efficiency for a single junction device under non-concentrated sunlight is ∼ 30%.20 The maximum power point Pout of a cell is given by eqn (2) where Jmp and Vmp represent the current density and voltage at the maximum power point. By defining the fill factor ff as the ratio (values between 0 and 1) of Pout and the product of the maximum attainable voltage (open circuit conditions) Voc (in V) and current density (short circuit conditions) Jsc (in mA cm−2) (eqn (3)), the efficiency relationship of eqn (1) can be rewritten as eqn (4), which is used to determine the cell performance. The Jsc, Voc, and ff values are measured by plotting the current density as the bias voltage is varied while irradiating the PV cell by means of a calibrated solar simulator. A typical diode current/voltage characteristic is shown in Fig. 5 (right). DSC researchers usually report J and V as positive values, but other J/V curve notations are used as well.  (1) Pout = VmpJmp(2) (3) (4)
An additional PV parameter which is routinely employed to determine the quality of a PV device is the external quantum efficiency (EQE), usually referred to as the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) by the DSC community. IPCE(λ) is defined as the number of collected electrons under short circuit conditions per number of incident photons at a given excitation wavelength λ and gives the ability of a cell to generate current as a function of the wavelength of the incident monochromatic light. IPCE is calculated by eqn (5) measuring the short-circuit photocurrent as a function of the monochromatic photon flux. IPCE is determined by the sensitizer light harvesting efficiency at λ (LHE), the quantum yield for electron injection from S* to the semiconductor oxide (Φinj), and the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll), the product of the latter two parameters giving the absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) or internal quantum efficiency. The integral of IPCE with the AM 1.5 G spectrum gives the photocurrent, which should match that measured under the solar simulator. Therefore higher IPCE and broader spectra correspond to higher Jsc. The IPCE plot of N719 is shown in Fig. 2C, with a IPCEmax of ca. 90% between 550 and 600 nm. It can be seen that IPCE goes to zero, that is no electrons are photogenerated, when the excitation wavelength exceeds 800 nm.  (5)
For the sake of clarity it should be remarked that PV measurements of different works are not directly comparable to each other, although all of the data reported in this review are always referred to standard solar radiation AM 1.5. This arises from the fact that cell fabrication and performance are dependent on a variety of parameters such as working conditions, commercial materials, chemical and morphological nature of the TiO2 layers, electrolyte and the counter electrode. For these reasons researchers usually compare the PV performance of new dyes with those of N3 or N179 with the same cell assembly materials, procedure and measuring conditions. The values reported in this work for N3 and N719 are those retrieved from reference works and represent optimized values. We also clarify that all of the values (e.g., photovoltaic efficiencies) listed in this article are collected from peer-reviewed journals under known conditions. We do not exclude that different values or even higher performances might have been communicated in other reports or at conferences.

        Bipyridine ligands with thiophene-based substituents
Structure

Thiophene rings have been widely used in materials science due to their peculiar structural and electronic properties.21 In particular, thiophene is a π-excessive heteroaromatic five-membered ring with a lower resonance energy than benzene.14 The electron-rich nature of thiophene is estimated by the Hückel approach, which predicts an excess of π-electron density on the ring carbon atoms, albeit lower than in other π-excessive rings such as pyrrole.13,22 Furthermore, thiophene-derived chromophores are usually endowed with enhanced photo- and thermal stability. From the synthetic point of view thiophene rings are highly versatile building blocks, easily undergo aromatic electrophilic substitution and can be conveniently converted into formyl or halogen derivatives, which are precursors for condensation and metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions,23 respectively, affording a large variety of functionalized derivatives.24 Based on these premises thiophene rings have been largely exploited in electro-optic25 and multiphoton26 absorption molecular materials. Polythiophenes are the most investigated semiconductor polymers and have been reported in many optoelectronic research fields.27–29 Amongst their other applications, polythiophenes have been largely employed as π-conjugated semiconductors for organic electronics and as donor polymers in organic bulk heterojunction PV cells in combination with fullerene derivatives.30 One of the major advantages of the thiophene ring is the possibility of introducing side substituents, strongly enhancing solubility in organic solvents and film processability. Poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) is one of the most investigated semiconducting polymers in organic PV.
It is thus not surprising that the thiophene-substituted bpys have been the first and most common ligands to be investigated for the synthesis of Ru(II) heteroleptic complexes as DSC sensitizers. Fig. 6 collects representative ruthenium dyes of this class, including the following thiophene-based units: A) Monocyclic thiophene derivatives: the simple alkyl-substituted thiophene ring in 531 and 6;32 a linear bithiophene and a dendritic terthiophene in 733 and 8;34 a thioalkyl substituted thiophene ring in 9;35B) Fused polycyclic derivatives: the two-cycle thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ring in 10;36 the three-cycle indeno[1,2-b]thiophene ring in 11 and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) ring in 12;37C) Thiophene rings substituted with donor nitrogen groups: carbazole-substituted thienyl and bithienyl units in 1338 and 14;39D) Vinylene derivatives: a thienyl-vinylene unit in 15,40 a 1,3-di(2-thienyl)benzo[c]-thiophene in 16,41 and bis-fluorenylamino substituted benzothiophene ring in 17.42 The first sub-group A includes mono- and oligothiophene rings, which have been amongst the first systems demonstrating the potential of thiophene-derived Ru(II) sensitizers. Concerning the polycyclic fused systems (sub-group B) we note that not only has the common CPDT43 spacer been described in only one example, but other common fused rings such as dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d]thiophene44 or dithienosiloles45 have not been reported in Ru(II) DSC dyes, with the exception of a patent application in the former case. In contrast, these rings have been incorporated in various efficient metal-free organic DSC sensitizers.43–45 The sub-group C contains hole-transport antennas for multifunctional dyes with enhanced performances. The role of the hole-transport carbazole moiety is to provide stability to the form S+ and thus retard the charge recombination from TiO2. It is worth noting that all of the derivatives so far described have the thiophene unit directly coupled to the bpy core. This fact likely arises from the most preferred, though not always versatile, synthetic approach, as we will see in a moment. In fact, very few vinylene-spaced species have been investigated. This is very surprising if one considers that vinylene-linked units might carry a series of important advantages including planarization of the conjugated arms, extended π-conjugation, efficient delocalization and, accordingly, enhanced optical properties.46 The few reported vinylene-spaced thiophene-derived ruthenium dyes are shown in sub-group D. Most of the thiophene-derived units carry hydrophobic alkyl chains in order to improve solubility and processability and limit water-induced dye desorption from the TiO2 surface.10 A second family of thiophene-based Ru(II) complexes, shown in Fig. 7, has been recently developed. In dyes 1847 and 1948 the anchoring carboxylic functionality is no longer provided by the dcbpy ligand, as for the previous dyes, but has been incorporated in the thiophene-derived unit. This allowed the design of homoleptic complexes as 18.

Synthesis
In all of the cases where the thiophene-derived arm is directly linked to the bpy core the synthetic approach to the substituted ancillary ligand consisted of a convergent metal catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between a proper metal-thiophene precursor and 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyiridine (Fig. 8A). The Suzuki and the Stille cross-coupling reactions are ones of the most viable methods for the formation of C–C bonds over the past 50 years. These involve the coupling of organoboron and organotin compounds, respectively, with various organic electrophiles, mediated by a palladium complex such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) Pd(PPh3)4.23 These reactions are proven to be very versatile for synthetic methodologies involving thiophene derivatives. Indeed, boron/tin and halogen thiophene derivatives are readily available. Thiophene organometal precursors can be easily prepared from α-lithium or α-halogen precursors using a variety of commercial borylation or stannylation reagents. Despite the fact that organotin reagents are endowed with some practical difficulties such as structure determination and removal and disposal of excess toxic reagent, the Stille coupling has been preferred (synthesis of 5–7, 9, 10, 13, and 14) to the Suzuki approach (8, 11, and 12). Knoevenagel-like, Wittig, or Horner–Emmons double condensation reactions were used for the synthesis of the vinylene-based ancillary ligands starting from the substituted 2-thiophene-carbaldehyde and the bis-anion of a proper 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyiridine derivative (Fig. 8B). The ancillary ligands were then converted into the corresponding heteroleptic complexes by the sequential reaction with the dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer, to afford the resulting mononuclear complex, followed by the addition of the anchoring ligand dcbpy and an excess of ammonium thiocyanate usually via a one-pot synthetic procedure. In some cases the metallation reaction was significantly improved by using microwave-induced conditions. The complex was typically purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column using methanol as an eluant.

Optical properties
The heteroleptic complexes typically present two intense UV intraligand π → π* transitions of the anchoring and thiophene-derived ancillary ligands. The Vis region includes the characteristic MLCT bands that we have introduced for N3/N719 (see Fig. 2). Table 1 summarizes the low-energy MLCT band properties of the complexes listed in Fig. 6 and 7. The low-energy MLCT band is the transition directly involved in the electron injection from the excited dye to TiO2. In principle this MLCT band can come either from dcbpy or the thiophene ancillary ligand. Due to the electron-poor properties of the COOH groups, at variance with the electron-rich properties of the thiophene ring, the LUMO of the anchoring ligand is lower than that of the ancillary ligand. Therefore the low-energy transition corresponds to metal-to-dcbpy charge transfer, as confirmed by computational studies.
The integration of thiophene units in the ancillary ligand induces a constant and significant red-shift and increase of the molar extinction coefficient. The bathochromic shift with respect to N3/N719 spans from a few nm to a maximum of 23 nm in complexes 7 and 10, where linear and fused bithienyl groups, respectively, are present. The large shift of 18 is the result of embedding both thiophene and anchoring functionalities into the same bpy ligand. In fact, the attachment of COOH to the thiophene units in 18 and 19 lowers the LUMO energy level of the sensitizers. It is worth noting that in general the heteroaromatic-derived dyes better perform with respect to their benzenoid predecessors 3 and 4, for which a relatively lower red-shift has been recorded. Very importantly, a strong hyperchromic shift has been observed for all the thiophene sensitizers compared to N3/N719, 3, and 4. This result is strategic for improving light harvesting properties of the corresponding devices, leading to optimal photocurrents and reduced recombination losses thanks to the use of thinner TiO2 films. As for the position of the absorption peak, the strongest effects were observed for the multicycle thiophene moieties as in 14. The MLCT band of Ru-DTBT-NCS is exceptionally intensive due to an additional contribution of the ancillary bpy, which presents, as a free ligand, an absorption band at 486 nm.
The red-shift and higher absorption coefficient of the absorption bands is evident from the examples shown in Fig. 9. The electronic spectra of the absorbed dyes on TiO2 (Fig. 9B) show similar features, with a small shift of the absorption onset. If the same molar absorption coefficients in solution and in TiO2 films are assumed, the latter spectra can be used to estimate the adsorbed amounts of the dye onto the oxide surface, concluding, in this particular case, that the new dyes have loadings comparable to that of N3. The strong improvement of optical properties, in particular in terms of hyperchromic shift, is also evident from Fig. 10, which compares the electronic spectrum of the fused derivative 10 with that of N719 and of the amphiphilic heteroleptic complex 20 (Z907).10

Semiempirical (ZINDO)32,33 and ab initio (Density Functional Theory DFT and Time Dependent Density Functional Theory TD-DFT)35,36,39 computational investigations have confirmed the identity of the different UV-Vis bands of the heteroleptic Ru(II) dyes. Fig. 11 shows the graphical representation of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals involved in the low-energy MLCT transition of complex 7. The HOMO and HOMO-1 orbitals are located on the metal center and the thiocyanate ligands, similarly to N3. The thiophene-derived ligand contributed to the LUMO+1 whereas the LUMO orbital is centered on the anchoring ligand, from which electron injection to TiO2 takes place.

Photovoltaic properties

Table 2 lists the main PV parameters of DSC based on the thiophene-embedded sensitizers. As a consequence of the higher molar absorptivities the photocurrent densities have been generally improved compared to N3 and N719. For bithienyl dye 7 a record value of ca. 24 mA cm−2 has been recorded. The vinylene-derivative 15 also showed a remarkable value of 20 mA cm−2, which is higher than that of N719 (19 mA cm−2) measured under the same conditions. The improved light harvesting abilities were also evident from the photocurrent action spectra, the integral of which yields Jsc. Fig. 12 compares the IPCE plot of derivative 18 with that of N719 measured under the same conditions (3-μm TiO2 films), highlighting the greater fraction of absorbed incident light from the former dye. In particular, 18 induces a significantly higher IPCE value in the 400–500 nm region, with a 15% increase of IPCEmax, and a red-shifted onset. In terms of overall power conversion efficiencies the most performing dye is 5, where the bpy ancillary ligand contains simple alkylthiophene substituents. As a matter of fact, the reported η value of 11.0% is the highest amongst the organometallic sensitizers reviewed in this article. An even higher value of 11.9% for 5 has been mentioned,35 but in this case no details are given for cell fabrication and characterization parameters. This value, as stressed by the authors, would represent the first case of a sensitizer surpassing the performance of N719. By substituting the alkyl in 5 with the alkylthio chain in 9 an efficiency very close to 11% has been recorded as well. It is worth noting that this value reaches a top value of 11.4%, once again higher than that of N719, by increasing the temperature to 30 °C.35

The larger size of the complexes can sometimes hamper efficient TiO2 nanoparticle adsorption. Very recently, a Ru(II) complex with an ancillary bpy ligand substituted by a carbazole-thienyl group was investigated as a co-sensitizer in combination with an organic dye. Due to ineffective penetration into the inner TiO2 layers the complex yields relatively low efficiencies (7.3%), but a η value higher than 10% was reached when assembled with the organic co-sensitizer.49 In a recent study Burn and Meredith have systematically investigated the combined effects of molecular volume and optical properties on the photovoltaic response of DSC sensitizers.50 Interestingly, they have found that the enhanced optical absorption can be converted to higher PV efficiencies only in the presence of efficient TiO2 chemisorption, which decreases as the molecular size is increased. This in turn yields lower LHE for the larger complexes. The net result is that dyes with the same π framework and similar optical properties but larger molecular volume have much lower η, because of the less efficient dye uptake and light harvesting.
As anticipated, the superior harvesting qualities have been properly exploited in DSC devices with thinner oxide layers for minimized recombination losses. For example, DSC based on dye 19 exhibited higher efficiencies (5.7%) than devices with the reference complex Z907 (5.4%) using a 3-μm TiO2 layer. Similarly, high-molar-extinction-coefficient dyes were particularly useful when incorporated into iodide/iodine-free solid-state DSC (ssDSC)51 devices using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-para-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the organic hole-transporting material.36b The thienothiophene sensitizer 10 was able to exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency of ca. 5%, which is one of the best ssDSC efficiencies to date. Similarly, ssDSC with 19 showed a η value of 3.6%, which was larger than that of Z907 (3.1%) under similar conditions. Excellent stabilities under a light-soaking test at 60 °C for 1000 h were also demonstrated in these and other cases.
It should be noted that overall power conversion efficiencies, though relatively high and in some cases larger than 10%, were not improved with respect to N719, which still holds the present unsurpassed record value, with the very few exceptions described above. This can be mainly ascribed to the following factors. Firstly, it should be noted that the best PV performances for N719 refer to extremely optimized devices. In fact, when compared to N719-based DSCs assembled and measured under similar conditions, the new sensitizers were generally more efficient. Secondly, photovoltages and fill factors did not generally benefit from the introduction of the π-extended ancillary ligands. This is not completely unexpected since the enhancement of these parameters requires the optimization of other components as well.52 The fill factor mainly depends on the diode quality factor, the photovoltage, the electron transfer coefficient from TiO2 to the electrolyte, and the total resistance of the cell, whereas Voc mainly originates from the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the metal oxide and the Nerst potential of the redox couple. Inefficient recombination/interception pathways (dark current) can increase the quasi-Fermi level and reduce the loss-in-potential from the dye excited state. Both photovoltage and fill factor may indirectly benefit from the use of thinner oxide films allowed by the higher molar extinction coefficient of the dyes, resulting in reduced dark currents and electrolyte resistance. Finally, as we have anticipated, the larger size of the thiophene-based Ru(II) complexes might play a strategic role in setting the PV performance.49,50 Indeed, replacing one of the two dcbpy anchoring ligands in N3 or N719 with an ancillary ligand containing a thiophene-based substituent significantly increases the dye molecular volume, which in turn could afford lower TiO2 adsorption, smaller LHE and, eventually, reduced power conversion efficiencies.

        Bipyridine ligands with alkoxy-thiophene based substituents
Structure and synthesis
The electron-rich nature of thiophene is lower than that of the other five-membered rings such as pyrrole. Although pyrrole-substituted bpys have recently been described,53 the most common strategy to enhance the electron-donating capacity of the thiophene rings consisted of the addition of donor alkoxy groups in the β ring positions. The 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT)54 ring has been widely used as a constituting unit in semiconducting polymers and other materials science fields. Accordingly, the DSC community has developed a number of EDOT-conjugated bpy ancillary ligands for heteroleptic complexes (Fig. 13). The same design principles of the most representative thiophene-base dyes also apply to the EDOT sensitizers and include: mono-EDOT in 2155 and 22,32,56 bis-EDOT in 23,57carbazole-substituted EDOT in 24,58 and vinylene-EDOT in 25.53a,59 As for the thiophene-derived bpys, we note that all of the ancillary ligands present direct EDOT-bpy bonding, with only one exception in 25.
 Fig. 13  
            Ru(II) DSC sensitizers based on EDOT-conjugated bpys as ligands. 
The synthetic approach resembles that used for the thiophene derivatives but in this case only the Stille coupling was used, starting from the proper stannyl-EDOT derivative and 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyiridine (Fig. 8C). The vinylene ancillary ligand in 25 was prepared by double Knoevenagel-like59 or Horner–Emmons60 condensation between the bis-anion of the proper 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine derivative and EDOT-2-carbaldeyde, which is readily available from EDOTvia Vilsmeier formylation (Fig. 8D). The ruthenium complexes were then obtained in a similar manner as described for the thienyl-derived dyes.
Optical properties

Table 3 collects the main optical parameters of the EDOT sensitizers of Fig. 13. The favorable optical properties discussed for the thiophene-derived dyes are further improved by the integration of the EDOT pendent group, thanks to its stronger electron-donating capacity and extended π-conjugation arising from the additional alkoxy donor substituents. Fig. 9 clearly shows the substantial absorption enhancement in the 400-nm and low-energy MLCT region of the EDOT dye 22 with respect to its thiophene analog 6 and N3. When two EDOT rings are coupled in the same conjugated arm optical properties are further enhanced. The sensitizer 23 has an extremely high molar extinction coefficient in comparison with mono-EDOT (21 and 22) and bis-thienyl (7) derivatives, and approximately twice that of N719. Fig. 14 shows the two intense MLCT bands of this EDOT dye in the Vis region. In particular, we emphasize the presence of a strong absorption peak at 453 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 54300 M−1 cm−1. The comparative behavior of 23 with reference dyes is even more impressive when observing the absorption spectra of the sensitizers anchored on TiO2 films (Fig. 14B). In particular 23 possesses a very strong absorption in the blue region, which can compete, as noted by the authors, with the dissipative absorption of the electrolyte. Similarly, the ε value of the carbazole derivative 24 is higher than that of its thiophene counterpart 13.

For the only reported vinylene derivative 25 detailed DFT/TDDFT calculations have been performed both in solution and for a TiO2 nanoparticle model, highlighting the factors affecting the measured optical and PV characteristics. The HOMO (Fig. 15B) is computed as a combination of Ru t2g and SCN π orbitals mixed with a π EDOT character, at variance with dyes such as Z907 for which a pure Ru-SCN HOMO is present. This supports the hypothesis that the positive charge of the oxidized dye following electron injection into TiO2 is partially localized on the ligand and effectively stabilized by the donor EDOT substituent. Fig. 15A shows the good agreement between the experimental and calculated absorption spectra, in particular for the most characteristic low-energy MLCT transition. This transition results from the combination of three major contributions having the LUMO+1 as the arriving state, resident on the EDOT ancillary ligand. The lowest excited state is subsequently originated from the transition to the LUMO orbital, localized on the anchoring ligand, from which the electron is transferred to TiO2. Therefore, considering the ligand π character of the HOMOs, some π–π* character is present in the MLCT transitions. We can thus conclude that the conjugated π-excessive heteroaromatic ring provides directionality to the excited state and induces enhanced oscillator strength.

Photovoltaic properties
The PV performances of DSC based on the EDOT dyes are summarized in Table 4, which typically refers to devices with a double oxide layer and a liquid electrolyte. The data are generally in line with those of the best thiophene counterparts, with photocurrents of ∼20 mA cm−2 and efficiencies of ∼10%, although in most cases EDOT derivatives performed better. The octylEDOT dye 22 produced a solar cell with a very high photocurrent density of 21.6 mA cm−2, which is 22% higher than that of the octylthiophene 6 sensitized cell using the same device-fabrication process. Accordingly, the η value increased from 7.4 to 9%, highlighting the beneficial role of the EDOT group. Interestingly, the light-harvesting abilities of 22 have been effectively exploited in a plastic DSC with a photoanode prepared from a binder-free TiO2 paste and an ITO-coated polyethylene naphthalate substrate, reaching an efficiency of 6.3%.56Fig. 16 compares the PV performance of devices based on the mono- and bis-EDOT sensitizers 21 and 23 with that of Z907, highlighting the higher photocurrents for the former dyes. Unfortunately, higher photocurrent densities were not associated to higher, or at least unvaried, photovoltages (Fig. 16, right), as consistently observed for the other heteroleptic sensitizers compared to N3 or N719. The authors associated the Voc decrease for 23 to the larger size of the dye, which induced deeper electrontrapping states and faster charge recombination between the oxide and the electrolyte.57 Shorter electron diffusion lengths in the electron conductor, as determined by electrical impedance analysis, were also attributed to the increased lateral diameters of sensitizers. Fig. 17 shows the J/V characteristics and the photocurrent action spectrum of the solar cells sensitized with the vinylene derivative 25, where a very high IPCE plateau of 87% has been reached. In this case the photocurrent density was further improved (19.1 to 19.7 mA cm−2) by using an electrolyte containing a high concentration of LiI. The adsorption of Li+ ions onto the TiO2 surface lowers the CB and thus enhances the driving force for electron injection from the sensitizer.

The favorable optical properties and enhanced photocurrents have been properly exploited in solvent-free devices61 in combination with thinner nanocrystalline titania films, which is important for practical applications. A very encouraging ε value of 8.5% was obtained for cells sensitized with 21 and containing a solvent-free electrolyte.55 Similarly, an all-solid state device based on the carbazole derivative 24 exhibited a relatively high efficiency of 3.8%.58 More importantly, EDOT based DSCs exhibited excellent long-term stability under light soaking stress at high temperature. For example, a negligible decrease of less than 10% was recorded for the cell efficiency with dye 21 after 1000 h of full sunlight soaking at 60 °C.55 This impressive result represents the present state of-the-art for stable and robust DSCs and demonstrates the strong industrial potential of this technology.
5. 
        Bipyridine ligands with other electron-rich five-membered heteroaromatic substituents
π-Excessive heteroaromatic rings other than thiophene have been rarely employed as substituents of ancillary bpy of DSC ruthenium sensitizers. Functionalized bpys with the strong donor pyrrole ring have been reported53,62 but never investigated in solar cells. In contrast, furyl derivatives have been reported as DSC dyes with very good efficiencies, despite the lower π-donor character of the heterocycle. From HMO calculations, the total π-electron excess of five-membered rings varies in the order pyrrole > thiophene > furan, with furan and thiophene possessing almost equal π-donor character and considerably lower than that of pyrrole.13Furan has a lower (∼75 kJ mol−1) resonance energy than thiophene (∼120 kJ mol−1) and is the least stable system between five-membered rings with one heteroatom. Fig. 18 collects investigated alkylfuran 2631 and alkylthiofuran 2763 sensitizers along with a selenophene derivative 28.64 The selenophane ring is less aromatic than thiophene but more aromatic than furan.65 In terms of synthetic access a much lower number of commercial furyl building blocks are available compared to thiophene. The furyl- and selenophane bpy ancillary ligands of 26–28 were prepared viaStille coupling reaction with 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine in good yields.
 Fig. 18  
          Ru(II) DSC sensitizers based on bpys ancillary ligands with substituent π-excessive heteroaromatics other than thiophene. 
The optical properties of complexes 26 and 27 are almost indistinguishable from those of the corresponding thienyl derivatives 5 and 9 (Table 5), as graphically supported in Fig. 19A. In contrast, the IPCE of the furyl dye 26 is lower than that of 5 (Fig. 19B). The authors attributed this finding to the lower absorptivity of the mesoporous titania film. Accordingly, the device photocurrent decreased from 18.6 to 17.8 mA cm−2, resulting in lower η values (Table 6). The optical properties of the selenophene derivative 28 were slightly improved with respect to their thiophene and furan counterparts 26 and 5. This in turn resulted in an excellent PV performance with efficiencies exceeding 10% (Table 6). As for thiophene derivatives, the long-term stability of furan-based DSCs was very high. A device using 27 and a solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte retained 96% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h aging at 60 °C.

        Quaterpyridine and other pyridine-based ligands

Bpy is the most widely used ligand in chemistry66 and consequently substituted bpy were by far the most investigated ligands for DSC complexes. However, a not negligible number of other pyridine based ligands conjugated with thiophene moieties have been investigated as Ru(II) DSC dyes. Fig. 20 collects selected ruthenium DSC sensitizers with thiophene-derived ligands other than bpy. These ligands include: a quaterpyridine in 29,672,2′-dipyridylamine in 30 and 31,68 and [1,10]phenanthrolines in 32 and 33,69 and 34–37.70

Thiophene-derived Ru(II) sensitizers with pyridine-based ligands other than bpy. 
Linear 2,2′-polypyridines other than bpy have been very rarely investigated, which is surprising considering the remarkably high efficiency (>11%) of the carboxylated terpyridyl complex of tris-thiocyanato Ru(II) (black-dye).71 To the best of our knowledge no thiophene-derived terpyridine tris-thiocyanato Ru(II) complexes have been reported as DSC sensitizers. Compound 29, which we have very recently described, is the first example of a heteroaryl π-conjugated quaterpyridine (qpy) Ru(II) complex. The design of 29 originated from the encouraging panchromatic properties of the previously reported alkyl-substituted qpy complex.72 The EDOT-vinylene qpy ligand of 29 has been obtained through a convergent-like Stille cross-coupling reaction with 6,6′-dibromo-4,4′-methoxycarbonyl-bpy. Reaction with dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer and KNCS, followed by hydrolysis of the ester groups to COOH, afforded the complex 29. Table 7 and Fig. 21A highlight the actual panchromatic response of this dye extending from the UV to the NIR region. The absorption spectrum shows two intense bands at 298 and 400 nm (intraligand π–π* transitions) and a rather broad MLCT transition covering the entire visible range, with a flat maximum at 615 nm. The unprecedented absorption broadness originates from the extended π-system of the qpy core and recalls that of the black-dye.71 The beneficial effect of integrating the EDOT moiety is even more evident in the 400–450 nm region where 29 shows a molar extinction coefficient of 35500 M−1 cm−1 to be compared with the value of 10300 M−1 cm−1 at 395 nm of the alkyl substituted qpy complex.

The encouraging light harvesting abilities of 29 afforded the impressive IPCE curve shown in Fig. 21B, which deeply extends inside the NIR region. It is worth noting that the external quantum efficiency of the qpy complex is still over 30% at 800 nm, where the vast majority of DSC sensitizers have zero or negligible response. Unfortunately, the excellent photocurrent is negatively compensated for by the poor photovoltage, with an overall power conversion efficiency lower than 6%. The low Voc stems from the composition of the Li-rich and TBP-free electrolyte, which was introduced in order to have an adequate electron injection driving force from the computed low-lying excited state energy of the dye. In addition, computational studies have highlighted the unfavorable geometrical adsorption mode of 29 compared to N719 (Fig. 22), which increases charge recombination from the oxide.

The extension of the π-conjugated system arising from the thiophene substitution can also be appreciated in the positive performance of DSCs with the dipyridylamine sensitizers 30 and 31. In particular, the IPCE curves showed an enhancement in the red region, with red-shifted onsets, compared to N719 (Fig. 23A). The increased light harvesting is confirmed by the higher device photocurrent than that of N719 under the same conditions, though overall conversion efficiencies were not improved (Table 8). The thienothiophene dye gave an excellent efficiency of 7.0% and excellent long-term stability when inserted in a device with a quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte. As we have described for bpy ligands, the 2,2′-bithienyl substituent was able to provide a remarkable performance in DSCs containing the imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline ligand of 35, with IPCE of ∼80% in the 400–600 nm range and a maximum over 92% at 523 nm. The measured η was close to 10% and higher than that obtained for N3-based devices (Fig. 23B).

7. Conclusions and outlook
Research teams have designed a great variety of polypyridine ligands for Ru(II) DSC sensitizers conjugated with π-excessive five-membered heteroaromatic species over the past five years. Thiophene derivatives have been by far the most studied species, from the simple monocyclic rings to linear oligothienyl and fused polycyclic fragments. Further extended π-frameworks were obtained by embedding the stronger donor species EDOT. The design of the ancillary ligands mostly relied on a direct aryl-aryl coupling between the thienyl unit and the pyridine ring of the coordinating core and relatively few heteroaryl-vinylene conjugated groups have been reported.
Regardless of the chemical nature of the heteroaromatic conjugated substituents, as a general trend the new ligands provided superior optical properties with respect to benchmark dyes N3 and N719 as well as to benzenoid predecessors Z-910 and K-19 and amphiphilic heteroleptic complex Z907. The bathochromic and hyperchromic effects on the absorption properties in turn afforded higher photocurrents and more intense and broader IPCE responses. On the basis of these distinct features, Grätzel referred to this class of compounds as DSC “supersensitizers.5f Although photovoltages and fill factors of DSC based on the new dyes were unvaried or, in some cases, smaller than N719, the measured overall power conversion efficiencies, typically ∼10% and in a few cases even exceeding 11%, were usually larger than those obtained by the reference sensitizers under the same conditions.
The improved light harvesting abilities proved to be particularly useful in devices containing oxide thinner films or solid-state configurations. These architectures limited the recombination pathways reducing dark currents and electrolyte resistance. Thanks to the inherent thermal and photochemical stability of the thiophene moieties,25DSC were able to withstand temperatures of ∼60 °C for long periods under light soaking, without significant decrease of performance. Very robust devices have been prepared paving the way for practical applications.
Although a great amount of work has been done, the general impression is that more research on ruthenium dyes is still needed. Relatively few conjugated substituents of the nitrogen aromatic ligands have been investigated, mostly limited to thiophene rings, with very few polycyclic examples. Apart from isolated exceptions, substituted ter- and quaterpyridine ligands still represent a virgin and challenging field of investigation, considering the impressive panchromatic properties of the few known examples. Furthermore, the larger molecular size of the functionalized complexes compared to N719 might represent an important drawback in terms of reduced dye uptake, smaller light harvesting efficiency and, ultimately, lower PV performances, suggesting that the control of the molecular volume is strategic for an optimal response. In conclusion, further search for new efficient ruthenium dyes is likely to be successful and provide, in combination with studies on metal-free organic sensitizers,73 the key to higher efficiencies and, ultimately, to cheap and efficient devices capable of matching the energy needs of future society.

Table Content:
Alessandro Abbotto	Alessandro Abbotto was born in Milano, Italy. He received his MS degree in Chemistry (1989) and Ph.D. in Chemistry (1993) from the University of Milano under the guidance of Prof. G. A. Pagani working on heteroaromatic-based carbanions. He then was a NSF post-doctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley (1994–95) in the group of Prof. A. Streitwieser and a NATO fellow at the University of Erlangen-Nuernberg with Prof. P. v. R. Schleyer (1995) with studies on structure and reactivity of anionic species. After his postdoc work he moved to the University of Milano-Bicocca where he is currently a Full Professor (since 2010) in Organic Chemistry and Materials. His current research interests include materials and devices for organic and hybrid photovoltaics, opto-electronics, and (nano)photonics.
Norberto Manfredi	Norberto Manfredi was born and raised in Milan, Italy. He received his Masters degree in Materials Science from the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, in 2005. He then worked with Prof. Giorgio A. Pagani studying heteroaromatic materials for non-linear optics and electrocromics. In 2008 Norberto joined the group of Prof. Alessandro Abbotto at the University of Milano-Bicocca working on the synthesis of novel organic and organometallic sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells and on the development of photovoltaic devices. He is currently involved in the Milano-Bicocca Solar Energy Research Center (MIB-SOLAR).
