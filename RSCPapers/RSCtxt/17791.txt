    , Accepted 30th October 2018First published on 30th October 2018AbstractA photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) in an aqueous medium is among the most promising methods to produce renewable fuels with the sun and water as the energy and electron source. But a high negative bias remains a prerequisite to achieve an appreciable conversion at present due to the large overpotential of CO2 reduction. This communication describes a PEC CRR with low onset potential on an amorphous silicon (a-Si) photocathode decorated with grain-boundary-rich gold catalysts. Syngas, with high throughput and desirable CO/H2 ratios such as 1:2 and 1:1, was produced in a wide PEC range from the equilibrium potential E0(CO2/CO) of −0.1 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) to as positive as 0.4 VRHE, leading to a half-cell conversion efficiency of 0.42%. This performance represents the highest half-cell efficiency and lowest onset potential for CO2 reduction ever reported among aqueous PEC cathodes under 1 sun illumination. The a-Si/TiO2/Au photocathodes exhibit excellent stability in a wide potential range, with a high CO mass activity up to 180 ampere per gram of gold at −0.1 VRHE. Controlling the grain boundary provides powerful potential to adjust the product selectivity in PEC CO2 reduction.

Broader context
The immoderate dependence on fossil fuels has resulted in an energy crisis and detrimental global climate fluctuation. Converting emitted CO2 back to fuel powered by clean energy provides alternative routes for realizing carbon-neutral recycling while meeting the ever-increasing energy demand. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction in an aqueous medium is among the most promising methods to produce renewable fuels with the sun and water as the energy and electron source. Nonetheless, unlike PEC water splitting, a large overpotential for CO2 reduction and limited catalyst activity greatly restrict the photocurrent and onset potential in PEC CO2 reduction systems. In the present communication, we have realized a high PEC performance towards syngas production with adjustable CO/H2 ratios, by integrating a TiO2-protected amorphous silicon absorber that produces a large photovoltage with a grain-boundary-mediated gold catalytic layer. The adjustable CO/H2 ratio originates from the strong correlation between the intermediate bonding strength and grain boundary density of gold, which can be easily adjusted by varying the gold deposition amount. As a consequence, this system achieves the highest half-cell efficiency and lowest onset potential for CO2 reduction among PEC cathodes in aqueous media under 1 sun illumination. This work presents new insights into controlling the grain boundaries towards efficient PEC catalytic systems.

Introduction
Over the past one and a half centuries, the atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased from 280 to 408 ppm as a result of intensive fossil fuel consumption.1 Furthermore, the world's energy demands continue to rise and will expand by 48% between 2012 and 2040.2 The urgency of limiting global warming has led to intense research on CO2 reduction driven by renewable sources, which provides effective strategies to close the carbon cycle and address the energy needs of the future.3 Harvesting and storing solar energy into carbon-based chemical bonds directly, as nature accomplishes by photosynthesis, is a highly desirable CO2 reduction approach that entails the synergy of light-absorbing and catalytic components.4 Solar-powered CO2 conversion to fuels such as CO or syngas has been well demonstrated in photovoltaic–electrochemical (PV + EC) devices5,6 or solar thermal–chemical systems.7 Like in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, the aqueous PEC cell is a promising artificial photosynthesis configuration that is expected to realize efficient solar fuel production directly from CO2 reduction where water acts as the electron source.8,9 Up to now, a few studies have been reported for aqueous PEC CO2 reduction on various photocathodes, including p-Si,10–14 ZnTe,15,16 CuFeO2,17 p-GaP,18,19 p-GaN,20 and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS).21,22 However, most of these photocathodes have a limited photovoltage or an unsuitable band alignment with the electrolyte, leading to a large external bias required to drive PEC CO2 reduction and a small photocurrent in the PEC potential range. Hence, pursuing an inexpensive photocathode with low onset potential and high photocurrents remains a challenge in PEC CO2 reduction.
Recently, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si) photocathodes have drawn increasing attention in PEC water splitting, owing to their high photovoltages, low cost, adjustable/scalable fabrication processes, and high-temperature adaptability.23–30 Likewise, a-Si should be a good photocathode candidate for CO2 reduction, if coupled with electrocatalysts that are of high efficiency and selectivity. Grain boundaries (GBs), one of the structural defects that affects materials’ mechanical strength, ductility, and conductivity,31 have lately illustrated significant enhancement in catalytic activity of metal nanocatalysts.32–39 In particular, research studies on Au and Cu nanocatalysts by Kanan et al. indicate a linear correlation between the GB density and specific activity toward CO2 electro-reduction.33,34,37,39 DFT calculations also reveal that GB sites hold different chemical bonding ability and stabilize key intermediates to promote CO2 reduction.40,41 Therefore, the control of the GBs on photocathodes holds great potential for PEC CO2 reduction.
This study describes the design and fabrication of a simple CO2 reduction photocathode with a TiO2-protected p–i–n a-Si thin film as the light absorber, and GB-rich Au nanoparticles as the catalytic layer for CO2 reduction (Fig. 1). By tuning the GB density of the Au layer, an important feedstock – syngas with different carbon hydrogen ratios could be obtained in a wide PEC range from −0.1 VRHE (V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) to as positive as 0.4 VRHE. The product includes the most desirable CO/H2 ratios of 1:2 and 1:1, which meets the requirements for methanol42 and dimethyl ether43 synthesis, and is also suitable for iron or cobalt based catalysts in Fischer–Tropsch processes44,45 to produce wax and diesel. The solar-to-fuel system here provides a renewable alternative for syngas production that traditionally relies on fossil fuels.46
 Fig. 1  Schematic energy band diagram of a-Si photocathodes for CO2 reduction to syngas, with FTO as a conducting substrate, a-Si (p–i–n) as a light absorber, TiO2 as a protective layer, and GB-Au as a catalyst. The photocathode is illuminated through the FTO side. ECB is the conduction band edge, EVB is the valence band edge, and EF is the quasi-Fermi level under illumination. Vph is the photovoltage generated by p–i–n junctions. 
For the electrode fabrication, 700 nm thick a-Si was first deposited in a sequence of 15 nm p-type layer, 650 nm intrinsic light-absorbing layer, 30 nm n-type layer (p–i–n) by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on FTO glass (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Above a-Si, a 40 nm dense TiO2 protective layer47 was deposited (Fig. S1b, ESI†) by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The TiO2 thickness was also confirmed by ellipsometry results (details in the ESI†). On the top of TiO2, Au layers with different thickness were prepared via e-beam evaporation. In this configuration (Fig. 1), photo-carriers are first generated in the intrinsic a-Si region under illumination, following which electrons and holes are separated by the built-in electric field from the p–i–n junction. Former work revealed that the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 could form suitable band alignment with both the CB of silicon and H2O/H2 redox in the electrolyte.48,49 Therefore, photo-electrons could be conducted through the CB of TiO2 to the Au/electrolyte interface, for CO2 reduction to syngas. Photo-holes are conducted to the FTO back-contact and transported to the counter electrode.
As the surface catalytic layers, 2, 4, 7, 11 and 20 nm (average thickness) Au films were deposited onto a-Si/TiO2 electrodes at a rate of 1 nm min−1. These a-Si/TiO2/Au samples are denoted as ST-2Au, ST-4Au, ST-7Au, ST-11Au and ST-20Au, respectively (selected electrode pictures are shown in Fig. 2). The average thickness of the Au films is determined using a quartz crystal monitor (QCM) next to the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms metallic Au and Ti4+ (TiO2) compositions on the electrode surface (Fig. S2, ESI†). The surface morphology after Au deposition was explored via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. 2a–e). Au films grow in the Volmer–Weber growth mode,50 where they evolved from small droplet-like (ST-2Au and ST-4Au, Fig. 2a and b) and cross-linked islands (ST-7Au and ST-11Au, Fig. 2c and d), to partially coalesced large worm-like islands (ST-20Au, Fig. 2e) before merging into continuous films. Therefore, Au nanoparticles (NPs) with different sizes could be obtained. To analyze the particle sizes and GB densities of Au NPs, Au films were scraped off from the electrodes and ultrasonically dissolved in ethanol for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the initial stage of Au growth (ST-2Au), small islands are scattered on TiO2 (Fig. 2a). The average Au size of ST-2Au is 4.9 ± 1.2 nm (Fig. 2f and Fig. S3a, ESI†), and the majority of these NPs are small single crystals with few observed GBs (marked in white arrows, Fig. 2k). For ST-4Au, the electrode surface is closely packed with Au NPs (Fig. 2b), and the average Au size is 7.8 ± 1.8 nm (Fig. 2g and Fig. S3b, ESI†). Most of the Au NPs for ST-4Au are polycrystalline with several GBs (Fig. 2l and Fig. S4, ESI†). It should be noted that when the Au thickness reaches 7 nm, a great proportion of cross-linked islands are formed, as observed in Fig. 2h and Fig. S5 (ESI†). The cross-linking between NPs provides substantially more GBs, apart from those within isolated NPs. For ST-11Au, nonetheless, the NP density on the electrode is reduced and less substrate is covered by Au despite a higher loading amount (Fig. 2d). This is due to the island coalescence and thickening through Ostwald ripening, which also considerably reduces the GB density (Fig. 2n).50 The following ST-20Au sample exhibits the same trend as ST-11Au, with a larger particle size (Fig. 2j) and a further reduced GB density (Fig. 2o). In other words, the GB density increases from initial nucleation to a maximum in the ST-7Au sample, and then decreases when Au NPs grow larger.

For PEC measurements, the samples after Au deposition were encapsulated as electrodes without further treatment. Light-driven CO2 reduction on the electrodes was performed under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 under ambient conditions (Fig. 3a). All electrodes show negligible currents in the dark. Bare a-Si yields a small photocurrent (several μA cm−2) that degrades quickly in seconds (Fig. S6, ESI†). TiO2 protected a-Si exhibits an enhanced photocurrent but is no more than 1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3a). In contrast, greatly enhanced photocurrents are observed for Au decorated a-Si/TiO2 electrodes. Both ST-4Au and ST-7Au samples present a high photocurrent of 6 mA cm−2 at −0.2 VRHE and an early onset potential at around 0.5 VRHE, where ST-7Au holds a better onset slope. For the a-Si/TiO2 electrode, the faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of H2 at all potentials are close to 100% with no CO production (Fig. 3b), indicating that all of the photo-carriers extracted are used to reduce water to H2 on the TiO2 surface. For the ST-4Au sample, considerable CO was produced, and the CO/H2 ratios can be tuned between 1:2 and 1:3.1 by changing the applied bias (Fig. 3c).

These compositions are suitable for methanol production42 or cobalt-based Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.45 On ST-7Au electrodes, FEs of CO can be further improved (Fig. 3d), resulting in syngas with CO/H2 ratios of 1:1 in a wide potential range from −0.1 to 0.3 VRHE, which is favorable for a single-step syngas-to-dimethyl ether process43 or iron-based Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.44 It is worth noting that FE of CO still achieves 40% at 0.4 VRHE (a photovoltage gain of 500 mV), implying the lowest onset potential for CO2 reduction ever reported among aqueous PEC cathodes under 1 sun illumination. Meanwhile, no liquid products were detected via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S7, ESI†).
We note that CO selectivity is strongly associated with the GB density of the Au catalytic film, which can be easily adjusted by varying the Au thickness (Fig. 2). Due to the back illumination configuration (Fig. 1), Au layers will not compete with a-Si for light absorption. The total photocurrents of ST-4Au, ST-7Au and ST-20Au show little difference, while ST-2Au and ST-11Au yield much smaller currents (Fig. S8a, ESI†), which is probably due to a smaller coverage of Au on the surface (Fig. 2a and d). The photocurrent trend is reproducible on five different batches of samples. For ST-2Au, ST-11Au and ST-20Au whose GB densities are relatively low, CO FEs are no more than 20% (Fig. S8b–d, ESI†). The altered product distribution between these samples is reflected by CO partial current densities (total current density times FE of CO) and CO/H2 ratios (Fig. 4). The highest CO partial current densities are achieved by ST-7Au within the whole potential range, followed by ST-4Au, ST-11Au, ST-20Au and ST-2Au, in consequence (Fig. 4a). Notably, compared with ST-2Au or ST-20Au, ST-7Au exhibits a 300 mV promotion of onset potential for CO2 to CO, which even exceeds the enhancement of oxide-derived Au electrocatalysts.51 CO to H2 ratios at different potentials on various a-Si/TiO2/Au electrodes are illustrated in Fig. 4b. An interesting trend is observed, where the CO/H2 ratio first increases with the Au thickness to the highest for ST-7Au, and then decreases when the Au thickness further increases. This is consistent with the trend of GB density versus Au thickness as mentioned above. Lattice strain at the surface and local spatial asymmetry induced by GBs increase the metal-to-adsorbate bonding strength,41,52 which effectively stabilizes the COOH intermediate and enhances the CO2 reduction activity. Therefore, by simply controlling Au deposition thickness, the CO/H2 ratios in the syngas products can be adjusted to the desired values for liquid fuel synthesis.

In addition to GBs, the metal/oxide interface plays an important role in CO2 reduction53–55 in (photo)electrochemical systems. For example, the Pt/TiO2 interface shows an elevated CO production in a PEC cathode based on GaN nanowires/Si structures.53 The Au/CeOx interface facilitates CO2 adsorption and activation in an electrochemical system.54 The interface of copper oxide and indium promotes the conversion of CO2 to CO on a microfabricated electrode.55 In our a-Si/TiO2/Au configuration for PEC CO2 reduction, however, the Au/TiO2 interface might contribute more to hydrogen evolution than CO2 reduction, since the FE of H2 ranges from 50% to more than 90% on different samples while the highest FE of CO is only 50%. This is also illustrated in Au–TiO2 photocatalytic systems, where the Au/TiO2 interface greatly improves the rate of hydrogen evolution.56,57
The best-performing ST-4Au and ST-7Au photocathodes were tested at −0.1 VRHE for a long-term period up to 10 h (Fig. 5). The current densities remained nearly unchanged throughout the stability tests. Moreover, FEs toward CO and H2 remained steady, producing syngas with ratios close to the desired 1:2 and 1:1 on ST-4Au and ST-7Au photocathodes, respectively. The surfaces of the photocathodes maintained the initial morphology and Au NPs were still highly polycrystalline with rich GBs (Fig. S9, ESI†). A dense ALD-TiO2 protective layer helps improve the corrosion–resistant property of photocathodes in near-neutral electrolytes. 40 nm is the optimized thickness for ALD-TiO2 to achieve an excellent protective effect (Fig. S10, ESI†), which is consistent with former investigations.58 Meanwhile, 150 °C as the ALD deposition temperature has nearly no effect on the performance of a-Si photocathodes (Fig. S11, ESI†). As a result, the photocathodes reveal an excellent stability in a wide PEC potential range (−0.1 to 0.4 VRHE, Fig. S12, ESI†), which is crucial for practical applications. Another crucial parameter for CO2 reduction applications lies in the requirement of catalysts with high mass activities, especially for noble metal catalysts. We calculated the mass activities of CO2 reduction for a-Si/TiO2/Au photocathodes (Fig. S13, ESI†). Taking −0.1 VRHE as a reference potential, ST-7Au achieves a CO mass activity that exceeds 160 A g−1 and ST-4Au attains the highest CO mass activity as high as 180 A g−1. This performance even surpassed the value in the best Au-based electrochemical CO2 reduction system.59

More importantly, the PEC CO2 reduction system in this work stands out for its early onset potential and high photocurrent in the PEC range, as shown in Fig. S14a (ESI†). Compared with other representative photocathodes in aqueous PEC systems, ST-7Au reported here holds a much earlier turn-on potential and a larger current density, contributing to an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.42%, which is the highest among aqueous PEC CO2 reduction cathodes under 1 sun illumination (Fig. S14b and Table S1, ESI†). This performance is only next to a benchmark ABPE of 0.87% with an onset potential of 0.47 VRHE, which was realized on pn+/GaN/Pt–TiO2 photocathodes under 8 sun illumination.53 Photovoltage scales logarithmically with the photon flux and concentrated light could enhance the power conversion efficiency.60 Therefore, a-Si/TiO2/Au in this work achieves an unprecedented efficiency under normal 1 sun illumination. The extremely early onset potential is attributed to the large photovoltage provided by the p–i–n junction obtained from a-Si as well as the fast surface reaction kinetics on GB-Au co-catalysts.
Finally, unassisted overall CRR was demonstrated in a PEC tandem cell composed of a-Si/TiO2/Au photocathodes and BiVO4/FeOOH/NiOOH photoanodes,61 where light was shone from the BiVO4 side (Fig. 6). The J–V curves of BiVO4 and a-Si/TiO2/Au (behind BiVO4 and the proton exchange membrane) were conducted in 1 M borate buffer (KBi, pH 9.2) and CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 (pH 6.8) in three-electrode configurations, respectively. A theoretical unbiased photocurrent of 0.25 mA cm−2 was expected for both ST-4Au and ST-7Au with BiVO4 by the intersection of the J–V curves under the same RHE reference (Fig. 6b). The two unbiased PEC tandem cells exhibit robust performances towards syngas production for a duration of up to 2 h. The actual unbiased photocurrents for ST-4Au||BiVO4 and ST-7Au||BiVO4 in two-electrode configuration are 0.22 and 0.24 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6c and d), with calculated overall solar-to-syngas efficiencies of 0.27% and 0.29%, respectively (details in the ESI†).

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a grain-boundary-mediated a-Si/TiO2/Au photocathode for efficient and robust CO2 reduction in an aqueous PEC system. The large photovoltage provided by the a-Si p–i–n junction and the excellent activity of GB-Au realize high-yield syngas synthesis in an unprecedentedly wide PEC potential range from −0.1 VRHE to as high as 0.4 VRHE, leading to the highest ABPE and lowest onset potential for CO2 reduction ever reported among PEC cathodes in aqueous media under 1 sun illumination. Moreover, the compositions of syngas, including the most desirable CO/H2 ratios of 1:2 and 1:1, are highly adjustable by tuning the GB densities in the surface catalytic layers. The design strategy in this work opens up new approaches to develop solar-driven syngas synthesis from CO2 and H2O towards renewable and carbon-neutral energy demands.

Broader context
The immoderate dependence on fossil fuels has resulted in an energy crisis and detrimental global climate fluctuation. Converting emitted CO2 back to fuel powered by clean energy provides alternative routes for realizing carbon-neutral recycling while meeting the ever-increasing energy demand. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction in an aqueous medium is among the most promising methods to produce renewable fuels with the sun and water as the energy and electron source. Nonetheless, unlike PEC water splitting, a large overpotential for CO2 reduction and limited catalyst activity greatly restrict the photocurrent and onset potential in PEC CO2 reduction systems. In the present communication, we have realized a high PEC performance towards syngas production with adjustable CO/H2 ratios, by integrating a TiO2-protected amorphous silicon absorber that produces a large photovoltage with a grain-boundary-mediated gold catalytic layer. The adjustable CO/H2 ratio originates from the strong correlation between the intermediate bonding strength and grain boundary density of gold, which can be easily adjusted by varying the gold deposition amount. As a consequence, this system achieves the highest half-cell efficiency and lowest onset potential for CO2 reduction among PEC cathodes in aqueous media under 1 sun illumination. This work presents new insights into controlling the grain boundaries towards efficient PEC catalytic systems.
