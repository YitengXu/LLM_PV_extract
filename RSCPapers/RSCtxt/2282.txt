    , Accepted 14th October 2020First published on 15th October 2020AbstractHydrogen has attracted extensive attention due to its versatile applications in various fields. As the starting step, hydrogen production is a critical technique for the practical application of hydrogen-related technologies. Solar-driven water splitting is considered one of the cleanest methods for hydrogen production because solar power is abundant and clean, and the products are only hydrogen and oxygen. Consequently, strategies to increase the efficiency of solar-to-hydrogen conversion have been widely explored. Based on the basic requirements, loading of co-catalysts for photocatalysis is emerging as an effective method to improve the efficiency of solar-driven water splitting. In this review, we shall systematically discuss the recent developments in two-dimensional (2D) materials, including graphene, 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and MXenes, for their application as co-catalysts in photocatalytic/photoelectrochemical H2 evolution. It is noted that highly efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by electrocatalysis can be used as superior co-catalysts for photocatalysis. Therefore, various methods to improve the HER activity of co-catalysts, such as phase-control, doping, defect engineering, hybridization, and functionalization, have been adopted to increase the photocatalytic performances of decorated photocatalysts, which are also systematically discussed. Through a comprehensive literature review, we summarize and propose this concept, that is, “electrocatalysts can be used as co-catalysts in photocatalysis for the improvement of solar-driven H2 evolution”. We believe that this concept will shed light on the development of technologies in photocatalytic hydrogen production for practical applications. At the same time, we trust that efficient, inexpensive and stable co-catalysts will be designed and fabricated not only to promote the efficiency of solar-driven hydrogen production on a large scale, but also to be beneficial for other catalytic processes.Rui TongDr Tong is a lecturer in the school of science at the Hubei University of Automotive Technology.

1. Introduction
With the dramatic increase of the world's population, the demand for energy has increased correspondingly, which has promoted the over-exploitation and utilization of fossil energy. The consumption of fossil fuel has caused many environmental problems, such as acid rain, ozone layer destruction, and greenhouse gas emissions.1–3 Thus, it is necessary for us to find green energy sources that can replace fossil fuels. In order to achieve the sustainable development of society, green energy harvesting and storage are crucial. Healthy energy management needs to reasonably consider the effective utilization of green energies, which are only available during a certain period in a day or a year (Fig. 1). For example, we may convert green energies into chemical energies in the forms of biofuel and hydrogen, which are easy to store and transport as liquid or gas. Hydrogen is considered an efficient energy carrier because of its highest energy density per unit mass (142 MJ kg−1) and an alternative energy source to fossil fuels because it is clean, renewable and abundant and has multiple applications in industry, such as in chemical engineering, hydrogen power generation, and fuel cells.4–6

There are many ways to produce hydrogen, such as steam methane reforming, coal gasification, electrolysis of water, and photocatalytic water splitting.7–10 Although steam methane reforming is the predominant method to produce hydrogen in industry, there are a lot of drawbacks, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, complicated operation and high consumption of fossil fuels. Hydrogen production from the electrolysis of water has many advantages, such as no pollution and easy operation, but the intermediate steps may increase the cost. Photocatalytic hydrogen production is considered the most sustainable, cleanest and easiest method to produce hydrogen because solar energy is abundant, green and renewable, and there is no intermediate step in the process.11,12 Therefore, it has been actively pursued for practical applications. However, the conversion efficiency for solar-to-hydrogen is still low for commercial installations.
Extensive efforts have been devoted to improving the efficiency of solar-to-H2 conversion since the discovery of the TiO2 electrode for water splitting under ultraviolet (UV) illumination in 1972.13 The efficiency is limited by various factors, such as the wide bandgap (Eg) of photocatalysts and high recombination rate. Fundamentally, the photocatalysts with high efficiency should satisfy a few basic requirements:14,15 (i) optimal bandgap (Eg: 2.0–2.4 eV) to maximize the use of solar energy; (ii) suitable band alignment with the redox levels;16 (iii) low recombination rate; and (iv) abundant surface active sites for hydrogen production. For a photocatalyst, meeting these conditions simultaneously is difficult, thereby leading to limited photocatalytic activity. Novel strategies, including co-doping, hydrogenation, defect engineering, sensitization, formation of heterojunctions, metal decoration, band-edge-state modification and design of novel cell structures, have been investigated and summarized to guide the design of photocatalysts for efficient production of hydrogen by photocatalysis with an expectation of achieving the above requirements.16,17 Recently, loading of co-catalysts has attracted much attention because it is a simple, controllable and effective method which can meet all the above requirements.
Noble metals, such as Pt, have been used as effective co-catalysts to boost the solar-driven H2 evolution.18,19 But its scarcity and high price restrict its practical use. Hence, earth-abundant materials are in high demand for replacing noble metals as co-catalysts with superior activity and low cost. The co-catalyst in P-HER or PE-HER can extract photogenerated electrons and host active sites for catalytic hydrogen evolution. Basically, an efficient co-catalyst should meet the following prerequisites:16,20–24 (i) to extract and transfer electrons from the photocatalyst to protons (i.e., H+) and (ii) to have outstanding catalytic activity for the HER. To satisfy the first requirement, the Fermi level of the co-catalyst has to be right below the CBB of the photocatalyst, resulting in the smooth flow of photo-excited electrons and the separation of electron–hole pairs. For the second requirement, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) on the co-catalyst should be near zero, so that the thermal-neutral conditions lead to easy adsorption of protons and fast release of hydrogen molecules with the lowest activation energy, which is in perfect agreement with the requirements for a superior HER electrocatalyst.22 Therefore, we propose that an electrocatalyst with high HER activity can be used as an efficient co-catalyst to improve photocatalytic H2 production.
Two-dimensional (2D) materials refer to materials in which electrons can move freely (plane motion) only on the nanometer scale (1–100 nm) in two dimensions.25 The concept of “2D materials” was proposed along with the successful separation of a single atomic layer of the graphite material, graphene, in 2004. 2D materials have strong in-plane bonds and weak interlayer Van der Waals forces. In recent years, 2D materials, such as graphene, g-C3N4, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MXenes, graphdiyne, phosphorene and 2D alloys, have attracted a lot of interest because of the exciting chemical and physical performances and diverse applications in batteries, electronics, optoelectronics, catalysts, sensors, etc.26–28 For example, 2D g-C3N4 with a suitable band structure has become the focus of research as the main catalyst in the photocatalytic field since it was reported as a photocatalyst by Wang et al. in 2009.29
In particular, 2D materials have a large surface area, which can enable the easy access of protons and hydroxyl anions to the catalyst and enhance the probability of carriers reaching the surface. Additionally, the electronic structures and catalytic activities of these 2D materials can be tuned by controlling the edges, defects, and surface. Therefore, they have been extensively investigated as electrocatalysts for the HER. Compared with non-2D materials as co-catalysts, 2D materials with high electrocatalytic activity as co-catalysts have some advantages:30 (i) 2D materials have a special 2D layered structure and can be used as a support to immobilize semiconductor nanoparticles, which will facilitate charge transfer and avoid the agglomeration of nanoparticles. This helps maintain the activity and stability of the photocatalyst. (ii) 2D materials have a high specific surface area, which can provide more active sites and promote the HER. However, a limited number of systematic summaries on 2D materials as co-catalysts in solar-driven hydrogen evolution are available. In this review, we will present our understanding of the design and fabrication of highly efficient electrocatalysts as co-catalysts for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (P-HER), discuss recent progress in the photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PE-HER), and provide our perspectives for the future development of solar-driven hydrogen production. In particular, we shall focus on graphene, 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and MXenes for their applications as co-catalysts in solar-driven H2 evolution, as well as the strategies (including phase-control, doping, defect engineering, hybridization, and functionalization) to improve the activity of 2D materials for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (E-HER) to enhance the photocatalytic properties of decorated photocatalysts.
2. P-HER and E-HER
2.1 P-HER
A schematic diagram of photocatalytic water splitting is shown in Fig. 2a. It mainly involves three processes:31–33 (i) when a semiconducting photocatalyst is irradiated by light with an energy greater than or equal to the bandgap energy of the semiconductor, the semiconductor absorbs light to generate photo-generated electron–hole pairs. The electrons in the valence band (VB) of the semiconductor are excited to the conduction band (CB), leaving photo-generated holes in the valence band; (ii) the photo-generated electrons and holes transfer to the surface of the photocatalyst, and at the same time, recombination of electrons and holes also takes place; (iii) the photo-generated electrons (e−) on the surface of the photocatalyst are negatively charged and have reducing properties and react with H+ to generate hydrogen. In contrast, the photo-generated holes (h+) are positively charged and have oxidizing ability and can oxidize H2O to oxygen. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was used to evaluate the photoelectron conversion efficiency, which can be calculated using the equation:34 AQE (%) = (number of produced H2 × 2)/(number of incident photons) × 100%.(1)

Various semiconductors (e.g. chalcogenides, oxides and nitrides) have been studied for their applications as photocatalysts in hydrogen production (Fig. 3).35–38 To improve P-HER activity, co-catalysts have been widely applied. The co-catalysts play three important roles in the improvement of photocatalytic water splitting performances:39,40 (i) after loading a co-catalyst, more interfaces are formed between the co-catalyst and the semiconductor, which facilitates the separation and transport of photo-generated electron–hole pairs (Fig. 2b). Under visible light, electrons are excited from the conduction band to the valence band, and then transferred to the surface of the co-catalyst for the reduction of H+ to H2. At the same time, the photo-generated holes left in the valence band move to the surface for the oxidation of H2O to O2. A suitable heterojunction formed between the co-catalyst and the semiconductor will shorten the charge transport distance and effectively hinder bulk recombination. (ii) Co-catalysts with a large number of active sites could reduce the activation energy for the HER. Photo-generated electrons transferred to the surface of the co-catalyst can quickly participate in the photocatalytic HER process, thereby effectively improving the photocatalytic water splitting efficiency. (iii) Co-catalysts can also hinder photo-corrosion and improve the durability of photocatalysts. For example, some semiconducting photocatalysts, such as nitrides or sulfides, are easily oxidized by photo-generated holes, resulting in self-decomposition.41 After loading of co-catalysts, photo-generated holes can efficiently transfer and participate in the oxygen evolution reaction, thereby effectively preventing photo-corrosion and improving the stability of photocatalysts.

2.2 E-HER and its roles in the P-HER
The electrocatalytic HER (E-HER) refers to the electrochemical method for the production of hydrogen on electrocatalysts at an applied voltage. The mechanism of the electrocatalytic HER is commonly believed to consist of three elementary steps (2.1–2.3):42 H+ + e− → Had(2.1) Had + H+ + e− → H2(2.2) Had + Had → H2(2.3)
Reaction (2.1), commonly referred to as the Volmer step, is the electrochemical adsorption and reduction of H+ ions from the solution. This reaction is succeeded by a desorption step, either the electrochemical desorption reaction (2.2) (Heyrovsky step) or the chemical desorption reaction (2.3) (Tafel step). However, the P-HER is an artificial photosynthesis to dissociate water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) on photocatalysts under sunlight. The mechanism of the P-HER is discussed above. In general, electrocatalysts with metallic characteristics have negligible P-HER activity, and semiconducting photocatalysts exhibit poor E-HER activity due to the poor electrical conductivity.14,20,22–24
Being a good electrocatalyst is a prerequisite for an excellent co-catalyst, because the electrocatalysts and co-catalysts share the main commonalities: large specific surface area, abundant active sites, and high electrical conductivity. Selecting a co-catalyst from excellent electrocatalysts can narrow the search range of co-catalysts. Nowadays, various co-catalysts with high electrocatalytic activities, such as metals (Ni, Co and Mo), nitrides (Ni3N and Mo2N), sulfides (NiS, MoS2 and WS2), carbides (Ti3C2, W2C and Co2C) and phosphides (Ni2P and CoP), have been studied.43–46 Taking tungsten carbide as an example, it has been regarded as a remarkable electrocatalyst with a low overpotential and high durability because of its abundant active sites, high conductivity and low |ΔGH|.47,48 Ultrafine WC1−x nanocrystals with high electrocatalytic activity have been reported to be an effective co-catalyst to modify graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for improving the photocatalytic activity.20 After loading 5 wt% WC1−x, the g-C3N4/WC1−x nanocomposite exhibited an optimal photocatalytic H2 generation rate of 2490 μmol h−1 g−1, which was over 56 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4.
Optimal E-HER activity can be acquired according to the following principles: (i) enhancing the electrical conductivity to boost the charge transfer between active sites and the electrolyte, (ii) increasing the number of catalytically active sites, and (iii) regulating the electronic structure to lower the |ΔGH| of the electrocatalyst. A lot of strategies, such as doping, defect engineering, hybridization, and integration with nanocarbon, have been adopted to enhance the HER activity of electrocatalysts. For example, V doped WS2 nanosheets on carbon cloth (V-WS2/CC) exhibited a higher E-HER activity with a lower overpotential (134 mV at 10 mA cm−2) than pure WS2 nanosheets on carbon cloth (278 mV at 10 mA cm−2).49 Compared with pure FeP, FeP integrated with graphene exhibited an improved catalytic activity with a smaller overpotential (123 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and Tafel slope (50 mV dec−1).50 The electrocatalysts with improved HER activity may be more efficient co-catalysts for further improving the P-HER activity of decorated photocatalysts.
3. 2D materials as co-catalysts
3.1 Graphene
Metal-free carbon nanomaterials have shown great potential for catalysis because of their numerous unique advantages, such as high specific surface area, tunable morphology and good conductivity. In addition, the abundance and non-toxic nature of carbon make carbon nanomaterials a low-cost and environment-friendly candidate for many applications. Therefore, various carbon nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, carbon dots and graphene, have attracted widespread attention. In particular, graphene, a novel two-dimensional (2D) carbon material made up of hexagonally structured sp2-hybridized carbon atoms,51–55 has been applied in various fields, such as energy storage (supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, etc.) and energy conversion (electrocatalytic H2 generation, photocatalytic H2 production, photocatalytic CO2 reduction, etc.), since its discovery in 2004.56–60 Graphene exhibits superior conductivity and electron mobility,61,62 leading to its predominant applications in electrocatalysis.51,52 For example, 3D graphene networks with a high density of sharp edge sites were reported for the E-HER with an extremely low onset potential of about 18 mV in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution as well as good stability.52

3.1.1 Graphene as the co-catalyst for P-HER. 
Owing to the wide application of graphene in the electrochemical HER,51,52 graphene could be used as the co-catalyst to improve the P-HER properties. Because the structure of graphene is relatively stable, it is usually mixed with semiconductor photocatalysts by hydrothermal, solvothermal, or low-temperature calcination methods. For example, Ye et al. prepared RGO/ZnIn2S4 nanocomposites by a facile solvothermal method and used them as effective photocatalysts for the visible-light P-HER.63 Pure ZnIn2S4 exhibited rather poor P-HER activities due to the low separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and slow transportation ability. After introducing RGO (1.0 wt%), an optimal visible-light P-HER rate of 40.85 μmol h−1 was obtained, which was about 4.3 times as high as that of pure ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 4a and b). The remarkable improvement of P-HER activity is attributed to the existence of RGO, which served as a useful co-catalyst to accept the photo-generated electrons from the CB of ZnIn2S4 and transfer them to the surface to participate in HER. Meanwhile, ZnIn2S4 decorated with RGO with a higher degree of reduction could further enhance P-HER performances because of the improved conductivity. Therefore, increasing the reduction degree of RGO could be a useful method to make it a more efficient co-catalyst in the P-HER.

Due to the stable in-plane sp2 hybridization and out-of-plane Pi bonding, pure graphene shows poor electrocatalytic activity for the HER.64 Various methods, such as doping, structural engineering and hybridization, have been adopted to improve the HER activity of graphene. For example, Ito et al. successfully prepared nitrogen and sulfur co-doped nanoporous graphene for the E-HER. N and S co-doping enhanced the electrocatalytic HER activity of nanoporous graphene at low operating potential comparable to pure graphene, N doped graphene and S doped graphene (Fig. 5a and b).65 Doped graphene with improved HER ability as a co-catalyst could further enhance the P-HER performance. Han et al. reported that N and S co-doped RGO (NS-RGO) with an optimal doping concentration could enhance the solar-driven hydrogen production rate of CdS, and the highest rate was up to 1701 μmol h−1 g−1 obtained by tuning the weight ratio of NS-RGO (Fig. 4c).66 The density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the N and S co-doping could optimize the HER Gibbs free energy, leading to the enhanced HER activity of graphene.

Reprinted with permission from ref. 67, Copyright © 2015 Royal Society of Chemistry. 
In addition, hybridizing graphene with other electrocatalysts can also improve the HER activity of graphene. For example, Ma et al. reported that graphene oxide (RGO) hybridized with CoP nanoparticles exhibited an improved catalytic activity with a smaller Tafel slope (104.8 mV dec−1) and a larger exchange current density (4.0 × 10−2 mA cm−2) (Fig. 5c and d).67 Therefore, hybridized graphene can be used as a co-catalyst for the P-HER with enhanced photocatalytic activity. For example, MoS2 and graphene were hybridized as the co-catalyst to decorate ZnIn2S4 for the P-HER.68 The optimal P-HER rate of MoS2-graphene/ZnIn2S4 was 4169 μmol h−1 g−1, which was 22.8 and 5 times higher than those of pure and RGO-decorated ZnIn2S4, respectively. The ternary CdS/WS2/graphene composite with an excellent visible-light P-HER rate of 1842 μmol h−1 g−1 and an AQE of 21.2% at 420 nm was reported by Xiang's group (Fig. 4d).69 Zhang et al. reported a co-catalyst composed of Ni metal and graphene (GN) to improve the P-HER. The optimal P-HER rate of GN/Eosin Y is 9430 μmol h−1, corresponding to an AQE of 30.3% at 470 nm.70
The P-HER properties of photocatalysts with graphene-based materials as co-catalysts are summarized in Table 1. We can see that the P-HER performances of the photocatalysts decorated with graphene are improved. By hybridizing with other electrocatalysts, the P-HER performances were further enhanced.

3.1.2 Graphene as the co-catalyst for the PE-HER. 
Photoelectrochemical water splitting, a branch of solar-driven water splitting, has also been extensively studied because of its advantages of being clean, pollution-free and easy control.75–79 The PEC water splitting process contains the following reactions:80–82 Photocathode: 2H+ + 2e− → H2(g)(3.1) Photoanode: H2O(l) + 2h+ → 1/2O2(g) + 2H+(3.2) Overall reaction: H2O(l) → H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g)(3.3)
Under external bias and sunlight, the photo-generated electrons (e−) participate in the HER on the photocathode, and the holes (h+) take part in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the photoanode.83,84 Photocurrent density response is a key to evaluating the PE-HER performance. At the same light intensity and voltage, the stronger the photocurrent, the higher the PE-HER activity. In addition, applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) is another important parameter to confirm the conversion efficiency of the incident photon. The ABPE can be calculated using the equation:ABPE = [(Jph − Jdark) (mA cm−2) × Vb (V)/Pin (mW cm−2)] × 100 (%),where Jph is the photocurrent density obtained at an applied bias Vb, Jdark is the current density in the dark, and Pin is the light intensity of incident light.85 Higher ABPE values indicate higher light utilization.
As discussed above, the graphene-based co-catalysts boost the HER, thus enhancing the PE-HER accordingly. Based on a similar idea, graphene had been used as a co-catalyst to improve the PE-PEC performance of many photocathodes. For example, the PE-HER activity of CuBi2O4 was improved by spin coating RGO.86 The enhancement was attributed to RGO which collected electrons from the photocathode. The photocurrent density of CuBi2O4/RGO-4 (−0.94 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) was ∼2 times higher than that of CuBi2O4 (−0.48 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE) (Fig. 4e). Sim et al. used N-doped graphene quantum sheets (N-GQSs) as the co-catalyst to modify the silicon photocathode for the PE-HER.87 The saturated photocurrent density of the N-GQSs/planar Si was about −35 mA cm−2 below −0.8 V vs. RHE, which was higher than that of planar Si without N-GQSs (−33 mA cm−2). Meanwhile, the N-GQSs/planar Si showed an increased ABPE of 2.29%, which is greater than that of the bare Si system (0.91%).

3.2 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with a chemical formula of MX2 (M is the transition metal element, such as Mo, W, V, and Nb; X is S, Se or Te) are scientifically meaningful and industrially valuable. TMDs are considered one of the 2D graphene analogues. MX2 consists of three layers in which M is in the middle and the two X layers are on the sides (Fig. 6a).88–90 In layered structures, each layer typically has a thickness of 6–7 Å. Like graphite, the layered structure is bonded together by the Van der Waals interaction between two neighboring layers. In the intralayer MX bonds are predominantly covalent, in which the metal (M) atoms give four electrons to fill the bonding states of TMDs, so that M and X have a +4 and −2 valence state, respectively.91 The TMD monolayers exhibit different properties from semi-metallic graphene. For instance, monolayers WS2, MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 present a direct bandgap and can be applied in electronics as transistors and in optics as emitters and detectors.92–95 TMDs have abundant physical properties due to their rich compositions and tunable phases. For example, they can be insulators (e.g. HfS2), semiconductors (e.g. MoS2 and WS2), and metals (e.g. TiS2, VS2 and NbSe2).96–100 In addition, the bandgap (Eg) of a semiconducting 2D TMD can be tuned from 1 to 2 eV by changing the number of layers.101–104 For example, the bandgap of MoS2 can be increased from 1.2 eV (bulk material) to 1.8–1.9 eV (monolayer).105 TMDs have three common phases, 1T, 2H and 3R, in which the letters represent triangles, hexagons and rhombohedra and the figures represent the number of XMX cells in the cell, which is the order of the layers in the stacking (Fig. 6b).106–109 The three phases are not fixed. Under certain conditions, they can be transformed into each other. For example, MoS2 generally exists as a semiconducting phase (2H). But when ion migration occurs, it can be transformed into a metastable metallic phase (1T). So far, there have been many insightful comments on the preparation of TMD materials. Many methods have been demonstrated as effective approaches for preparing TMDs, such as CVD, the hydro(solvo)thermal method, electrostatic spinning, exfoliation, molecular beam epitaxy, the sol–gel method and so on.110–112

TMDs are widely used in energy storage (e.g. supercapacitors and batteries) and conversion (e.g. photocatalysis and electrocatalysis) due to their unique optical, electrical, and electrochemical properties.113–115 For example, in 2005, Hinnemann et al. adopted DFT calculations to evaluate the ΔGH of MoS2 and showed that |ΔGH| is near zero, indicating that MoS2 may be a potential HER electrocatalyst.116 Taking tungsten sulfide as an example, Cheng et al. reported ultrathin WS2 nanoflakes as an effective HER electrocatalyst with an impressively small overpotential of approximately 100 mV and a Tafel slope of 48 mV per decade in acids.117 More recently, Song et al. summarized the preparation of 2D TMDs and modulation strategies (creating more active sites, heteroatom doping, phase engineering, construction of heterostructures and synergistic modulation) to boost their electrocatalytic HER kinetics.118,119 TMDs as co-catalysts can greatly enhance the solar-driven H2 generation of the host photocatalysts according to the principles presented in the introduction. In this part, we shall systematically summarize the development of TMDs as co-catalysts for solar-driven H2 evolution.

3.2.1 MoX2 (X = S, Se) as co-catalysts for P-HER. 
At present, MoS2 is the most widely studied TMD as an electrocatalyst for the HER,120–122 which reveals its outstanding HER activity and leads to a good performance as the co-catalyst in photocatalysis. Many studies have demonstrated MoS2 to be an effective co-catalyst in improving the P-HER performances of varied photocatalysts, such as TiO2,123–127 Cu2O,128 CdS,129–133 ZnS,134,135 ZnIn2S4,136–139 CuInS2,140,141 KNbO3 (ref. 142 and 143) and g-C3N4.144–148 For example, Zhu et al. reported that the H2 production rate of MoS2-TiO2 (4.0 wt% MoS2) (753.5 μmol h−1 g−1) was 48.6 times higher than that of TiO2.123 Flower-like MoS2 was used as the co-catalyst to decorate non-toxic and clean g-C3N4 for improving the P-HER activity. Under visible light, the P-HER rate of g-C3N4 was enhanced 2.8 times after loading 0.5 wt% MoS2.149 Xu et al. reported that MoS2/CdS composites (2.0 wt% MoS2) showed an optimal P-HER rate of 4.06 mmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation, which was 17 times higher than that of pure CdS.150
Exfoliating molybdenum sulfide into single layers or a few layers can expose more active sites for the HER.151,152 For instance, Lukowski et al. reported significantly increased E-HER activity with a low overpotential of −187 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec−1 for metallic 1T-MoS2 nanosheets via chemical exfoliation of semiconducting 2H-MoS2 nanostructures grown directly on graphite.153 In addition, molybdenum sulfide with a few layers has also been used as the co-catalyst to improve the P-HER activity of photocatalysts. For example, He et al. prepared CdS nanowires loaded with ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets.131 An optimal visible-light P-HER rate of 95.7 mmol h−1 g−1 along with an apparent quantum yield of 46.9% at 420 nm was acquired over the ultrathin MoS2/CdS composites (Fig. 7a). Similarly, CuInS2 modified with few-layer MoS2 nanosheets was prepared by Yuan's group.140 The 3 wt% MoS2/CuInS2 photocatalyst showed an optimal P-HER rate of 202 mmol h−1 g−1 under sunlight irradiation, which was about 40 times larger than that of CuInS2 (Fig. 7b). Few-layer MoS2 not only attracted electrons fast to prevent carrier recombination but also provided rich active sites to boost the surface HER. Reducing the lateral size of MoS2 can further increase the HER active sites because of the presence of more exposed edges and improve the co-catalytic performance of MoS2 for the P-HER. Ye and co-workers reported a simple and facile liquid-phase exfoliation method to synthesize monolayer MoS2 with lateral sizes ranging from 9 to 42 nm.154 When the lateral size of MoS2 decreased from 42 nm to 9 nm, more active sites were exposed, thus resulting in better HER ability. The P-HER rate of MoS2/CdS increased with the decreasing lateral size of MoS2. CdS decorated with 9 nm MoS2 presented the highest P-HER rate of 6.8 mmol h−1 and an AQE of 77.2% at 420 nm (0.2 g) (Fig. 7c). The enhanced co-catalytic performance of smaller sized MoS2 monolayers was attributed to the abundant HER active sites at the edge and shortened photo-excited carrier migration distance (Fig. 7d). Kong et al. used MoS2 as the co-catalyst to decorate CO group connected g-C3N4 (CO-C3N4).155 The P-HER activity of CO-C3N4 was greatly increased after loading MoS2.

In addition, various methods, such as phase-control, doping, defect engineering and hybridization, have been adopted to improve the HER activity of MoS2 by achieving abundant active sites, high electrical conductivity and low |ΔGH|. The basal plane of 2H MoS2 is inert for the HER because of its semiconducting nature, while that of metallic 1T MoS2 is active.156–158 Phase transition from 2H to 1T may give rise to catalytically active basal planes due to the semiconductor-to-metal evolution, leading to abundant active sites on the surface. Li et al. confirmed that cracked monolayer 1T MoS2 (C-1T MoS2) exhibited a catalytic performance with an onset potential of −113 mV and an overpotential near −156 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, lower than that of 2H MoS2 (−161 mV and −274 mV) (Fig. 8a).159 Doping is a useful method to tune the conductivity and increase the catalytic sites.160,161 Different cations (Na+, Ca2+, Ni2+, and Co2+) were doped into 1T-MoS2 for the HER. Both calculations and experiments indicated that Na+ doped 1T-MoS2 had the highest conductivity and lowest |ΔGH|, which led to the best E-HER activity with the lowest onset potential of 183 mV vs. RHE and smallest Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8b).162 MoS2 with defects has more effective active sites for the HER because of the high concentration of uncoordinated S atoms.163,164 Ye et al. adopted H2-treatment on pristine monolayer MoS2 to create defects for improving the HER activity. The H2 treated MoS2 exhibited an obviously decreased onset overpotential and increased current density compared with the pristine MoS2 (Fig. 8c).165 Hybridizing MoS2 with Mo2C to form heterojunctions enhanced the charge transfer. So, MoS2/Mo2C hybrid nanosheets exhibited a better E-HER activity (an overpotential of 63 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1) than pure MoS2 (139 mV and 61 mV dec−1) and Mo2C (146 mV and 63 mV dec−1), respectively (Fig. 8d).166

As discussed above, the modified MoS2 with improved E-HER ability as the co-catalyst could further enhance the P-HER performance. For example, Liu et al. found that 1T-MoS2-decorated CdS showed a threefold higher P-HER rate (9.11 mmol h−1 g−1) than 2H-MoS2-decorated CdS (3.07 mmol h−1 g−1) (Fig. 9a).167 Chang et al. used MoS2 with different phases (1T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2) to modify P25 (TiO2) for the P-HER and found that P25/1T-MoS2 showed a ∼40 times higher P-HER rate of 4564 μmol h−1 g−1 than P25/2H-MoS2 and had an AQE of 14.5% at 365 nm.168 Kumar et al. used boron-doped MoS2 nanosheets (FBM) as the co-catalyst to enhance the P-HER activity of CdS.169 Incorporating boron into MoS2 activated the S atoms of the basal plane, leading to an increase of the catalytic sites for the HER. FBM/CdS nanorods (FBMC) showed a higher P-HER rate of 191 mmol h−1 g−1 than MoS2/CdS (125 mmol h−1 g−1). The optimal quantum yield was estimated to be around 31.5% at 425 nm (the rate of H2 production was 84 mmol h−1 g−1) over FBMC. Wang's group reported that P-doping effectively expanded the interlayer distance of MoS2,170 thus leading to abundant catalytic sites in P-doped MoS2 (P-MoS2). Accordingly, the P-MoS2/CdS composite showed a higher P-HER rate (58.9 μmol h−1 g−1) than MoS2/CdS (26.1 μmol h−1 g−1), and an AQE of 19.0% was achieved at 420 nm (Fig. 9b). CdS decorated with defect-rich MoS2 showed a ∼14.7 times higher P-HER rate (17203.7 μmol h−1 g−1) than 3 wt% Pt/CdS (1173.2 μmol h−1 g−1). In addition, the defect-rich MoS2/CdS displayed an optimal quantum yield of ∼24.2% at 420 nm (Fig. 9c).171 The introduction of a binary co-catalyst can further improve P-HER performances.172 Choi et al. reported that a CdS/Mo2S@Ni2P nanocomposite exhibited a better P-HER activity (an optimal P-HER rate of 72.76 mmol h−1 g−1) than CdS/Ni2P (∼27.98 mmol h−1 g−1) and CdS/MoS2 (∼37.37 mmol h−1 g−1) and had a high apparent quantum efficiency of 24.4%.173 MoS2/Mo2C-decorated CdS as a superior photocatalyst was reported by Pan's group.23 The Gibbs free energy of MoS2/Mo2C was closer to zero than that of MoS2 (Fig. 9d), thus resulting in improved E-HER performance (Fig. 9e). Hence, the MoS2/Mo2C/CdS composite displayed a higher P-HER rate (34 mmol h−1 g−1) than MoS2/CdS (6.7 mmol h−1 g−1) (Fig. 9f). An excellent apparent quantum efficiency of 41.4% at λ = 420 nm was achieved over the MoS2/Mo2C/CdS composite. Meanwhile, they used MoS2/Mo2C as the co-catalyst to couple with g-C3N4. Notably, MoS2/Mo2C/g-C3N4 also showed a higher P-HER rate (1.1 mmol h−1 g−1) than MoS2/g-C3N4 (0.19 mmol h−1 g−1), indicating the advantage of the MoS2/Mo2C binary co-catalyst architecture.

Compared with MoS2, MoSe2 exhibits higher intrinsic conductivity because of the more metallic nature of Se.174,175 In addition, DFT calculation showed that the |ΔGH| on MoSe2 edges was lower than that of MoS2, resulting in easier hydrogen adsorption.176 Zeng et al. reported that the hierarchical ZnIn2S4/MoSe2 nanoarchitectures showed high P-HER.177 The increased P-HER activity over ZnIn2S4/MoSe2 was ascribed to the MoSe2 layer, which boosted the carrier separation and transfer. The optimum nanocomposite of the ZnIn2S4/2% MoSe2 photocatalyst exhibited a high P-HER rate of 2.225 mmol g−1 h−1 and an apparent quantum yield of 21.39% at 420 nm. Similar to MoS2, the HER performance of MoSe2 can also be greatly enhanced using similar ideas to those mentioned above. For example, phase transition can control the catalytic activity of MoSe2 because 1T-MoSe2 is metallic.178,179 Jiang et al. evaluated that 1T-MoSe2 nanosheets presented outstanding kinetic metrics for the E-HER with a low onset potential of 60 mV and a small Tafel slope of 78 mV dec−1, which were better than those of the 2H-MoSe2.180 Phase-controlled MoS2 with enhanced HER activity as the co-catalyst can further improve the P-HER performance. Li et al. reported that the noble-metal-free multiphasic 1T/2H MoSe2 coupled with a 1D CdS semiconductor (1T/2H-MC) showed a P-HER rate of 93.4 mmol h−1 g−1, which was much larger than that of 2H MoSe2/CdS (2H-MC) (30.4 mmol g−1 h−1) and pure CdS (10.8 mmol h−1 g−1).181 The quantum yield of 1 T/2H-MC-10% was 33.2% at 420 nm, which was higher than that of CdS (0.8% at 420 nm). Interlayer distance-enlarged 1T-phase MoSe2 as the co-catalyst was reported by Xu's group to increase the visible-light P-HER activity of 2D-C3N4.182 Interlayer distance-enlarged 1T-phase MoSe2 (MS(IE/1T))-decorated 2D-C3N4 (MSCN(IE/1T)) exhibited a much higher P-HER rate (1672.6 μmol h−1 g−1) than the normal distance 2H-MoSe2 (MS(NS/2H))-modified 2D-C3N4 (MSCN(NS/2H)) (186.7 μmol h−1 g−1) and had a high apparent quantum efficiency of 5.2% at 420 nm. Peng and co-workers synthesized a mixed-phase MoSe2 co-catalyst to modify CdS-CdSe for the P-HER.183 The DFT calculations suggested that the mixed-phase MoSe2 had high HER catalytic capacity, thus leading to a remarkable co-catalytic activity. The (1T/2H) MoSe2/CdS-CdSe exhibited a higher P-HER rate (24.34 mmol h−1 g−1) than CdS-CdSe (4.67 mmol h−1 g−1) and CdS (2.56 mmol h−1 g−1). Meanwhile, a high apparent quantum efficiency of 28.5% at 500 nm was achieved over the (1T/2H) MoSe2/CdS-CdSe. Different from MoS2 and MoSe2, there is little research on MoTe2, which is mainly focused on the HER activity of bulk or mechanically exfoliated MoTe2 nanosheets. MoTe2 showed a poor E-HER activity with an overpotential of more than 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2.184 MoTe2 with poor HER activity has not been reported as a co-catalyst for the P-HER.

Table 2 summarizes the P-HER performances of MoX2 (X = S, Se)-based photocatalysts from recent work. The P-HER rates were remarkably increased after loading MoX2. Because different photocatalysts exhibit different P-HER activities and the P-HER conditions (light power and catalyst mass) are different, it is hard to compare the performances of MoX2 co-catalysts. However, we trust that the electrocatalysts that satisfy the basic requirements can dramatically enhance the P-HER. To compare the co-catalytic performances of MoX2 as fairly as possible, the P-HER rates before and after the addition of the MoX2 are given. We believe that this can be a useful guidance for the selection and design of high-efficiency co-catalysts.

3.2.2 Other TMDs as co-catalysts for P-HER. 
W and Mo are elements in the same group (VI B). The physical and chemical properties of WX2 (X = S, Se and Te) are quite similar to those of MoX2 (X = S, Se and Te).185–188 2H-WX2 (X = S, Se and Te) materials exhibit catalytic HER activity with the active sites located at the edges and defects. Among WX2 materials, WS2 is the most studied one. The abundant and cheap WS2 has been explored as a potential electrocatalyst since 20 years ago.189 Ultrathin WS2 nanoflakes were reported to show a high electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of about 100 mV and a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1.190 Due to its outstanding HER activity,191–194 WS2 has also attracted much attention as a co-catalyst for enhancing the P-HER. For example, Zhang et al. prepared 2D WS2 to decorate 2D CdS for the visible-light P-HER.195 Compared with pure CdS (1.72 mmol h−1 g−1), 10 wt% WS2/CdS presented a larger P-HER rate of 14.1 mmol h−1 g−1 (Fig. 10a). Zhou et al. reported that 0.3 wt% WS2/g-C3N4 presented a P-HER rate of 154 μmol h−1 g−1, which was even larger than that of 0.3 wt% Pt-g-C3N4 (138 μmol h−1 g−1) (Fig. 10b and c).196 Similarly, the 3 wt% WS2/ZnIn2S4 had a P-HER rate of 199.1 μmol h−1 g−1, which was 6 times larger than that of ZnIn2S4 (Fig. 10d).197

The same strategies (e.g. layer reduction, phase-control and hybridization) used for MoS2 have been used to improve the HER activity of WS2. For example, Liu prepared WS2 nanosheets from bulk WS2 by liquid exfoliation. Due to more active sites and lower |ΔGH|, the exfoliated WS2 nanosheets (E-WS2 NSs) showed a better E-HER activity (a low onset overpotential of 80 mV and a small Tafel slope of 70 mV dec−1) and stability than bulk WS2 (320 mV and 107 mV dec−1) (Fig. 11a and b).188 1T-WS2 exhibited better HER activity than the 2H-WS2 because the basal plane of metallic 1T-WS2 is active, while that of semiconducting 2H-WS2 is inert.198–202 Hybridizing WS2 with other active electrocatalysts (e.g. phosphides, sulfides, metals and carbides) can improve conductivity and increase the active sites, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic HER.203–211 Compared with Ni5P4-Ni2P and WS2, tungsten disulfide hybridized with nickel phosphide (WS2/Ni5P4-Ni2P) showed a better E-HER activity with an overpotential of 94 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 74 mV dec−1 (Fig. 11c and d).212

Modified WS2 can be used as a co-catalyst for the P-HER with enhanced photocatalytic activity. For example, Xu et al. adopted liquid phase exfoliation to successfully prepare 1–2 layer WS2 nanosheets,213 which had more edge active sites. Using the 1–2 layer WS2 nanosheets as the co-catalyst coupled with CdS, a 26-fold improvement in the P-HER rate was obtained on WS2/CdS compared to CdS. An AQE of >60% at 420 nm was achieved over the WS2/CdS. Meanwhile, with the increase of centrifugal speed, the number of layers of WS2 was reduced, and the P-HER rate of WS2-decorated CdS was further increased (Fig. 12a). Using a similar idea, Gopannagari et al. exfoliated few-layer WS2 nanosheets into bilayers and used them as co-catalysts to enhance the P-HER of CdS.214 The bilayer WS2 nanosheets provided catalytic sites for accelerating the surface HER and boosted the separation and transfer of photo-excited carriers. These led to a remarkable improvement of the P-HER. WS2-CdS exhibited a higher P-HER rate (185.79 mmol h−1 g−1) than the few-layer WS2-decorated CdS (54 mmol h−1 g−1) and had a high AQE of 40.5% at 425 nm (Fig. 12b).

Yi et al. used metallic 1T-WS2 as the co-catalyst to decorate g-C3N4.215 The optimal visible-light P-HER rate of 1T-WS2/g-C3N4 was 331.09 μmol h−1 g−1, which was 43.3 times larger than that of pure g-C3N4. The AQE was 1.12% at 420 nm. In addition, 1T-WS2/g-C3N4 exhibited better P-HER activity (331.09 μmol h−1 g−1) than 2H-WS2/g-C3N4 (171.51 μmol h−1 g−1) under the same conditions because of the efficient carrier separation and transfer and high catalytic activity for the HER (Fig. 12c). A 1T/2H-WS2/g-C3N4 composite was successfully prepared by Cao's group.216 2H-WS2 had a suitable band structure aligned to that of 2D-g-C3N4 to form a heterojunction, and 1T-WS2 as the co-catalyst exhibited superior conductivity and additional active sites, thus resulting in efficient carrier separation and transmission (Fig. 12d). 1T/2H-WS2/g-C3N4 showed an optimal visible-light P-HER rate of 350.75 μmol h−1 g−1. Reddy et al. reported that the CdS/WS2-MoS2 showed an optimal P-HER rate of 209.79 mmol h−1 g−1 under sunlight, which was about 1.7 and 1.24 times larger than that of CdS/MoS2 and CdS/WS2. Meanwhile, a high AQE of 51.4% at 425 nm was achieved over CdS/WS2-MoS2 (Fig. 12e).217
Similar to MoSe2, a WSe2 electrocatalyst can be used as a co-catalyst for enhancing the P-HER too. Few-layer WSe2 on RGO exhibited a small Tafel slope of 57.6 mV dec−1 and a low potential of ∼300 mV vs. RHE at a high current density of 38.43 mA cm−2.218 Guo et al. reported few-layer WSe2 nanosheets as the co-catalyst to decorate Zn0.1Cd0.9S for the P-HER.219 After loading 10 wt% WSe2, a maximum P-HER rate of 147.32 mmol h−1 g−1 was acquired, which was 11 times larger than that of Zn0.1Cd0.9S, due to a similar mechanism discussed above (Fig. 7f). The WSe2/Zn0.1Cd0.9S exhibited a high AQE of 39.5% at 425 nm. However, just like that of MoTe2, the electrocatalytic HER activity of WTe2 is poor, which leads to a poor performance of the WTe2 co-catalyst in photocatalysis, so few studies focused on WTe2 as the co-catalysts.
Pan et al. reported that the VS2 monolayer showed excellent electrocatalytic HER activity on its basal plane for the first time in 2014, and its nanoribbons with the edge saturated with S atoms were also found to be very active in 2015.220,221 In 2017, their experimental results confirmed that VS2 nanoflowers exhibited an outstanding E-HER activity with a low overpotential of 58 mV (54 mV for Pt) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 13a).222 VS2 exhibited much better E-HER properties than WS2 and MoS2 because of the abundant active sites both on the basal plane and at the edge.223–225 Therefore, VS2 showed great promise as a good co-catalyst for enhancing the P-HER of semiconducting photocatalysts. In 2018, Pan's group reported that VS2 as the co-catalyst can greatly enhance the P-HER of g-C3N4 for the first time.24 Owing to the effective transfer of electrons from g-C3N4 to VS2 for carrier separation and the abundant sites on sulfide to boost the surface HER, VS2-decorated g-C3N4 presented a 26 times larger P-HER rate (87.4 μmol h−1) than pure g-C3N4 (3.3 μmol h−1) and had an AQE of 5.5% at 420 nm. Compared with the Gibbs free energies of WS2 and MoS2, the Gibbs free energy of VS2 is close to zero (Fig. 13b). Hence, VS2/g-C3N4 showed a higher P-HER rate than MoS2/g-C3N4 (18.8 μmol h−1) and WS2/g-C3N4 (28.4 μmol h−1) (Fig. 13c). Similarly, Zhang et al. used VS2 as the co-catalyst coupled with phosphorus doped ZnCdS/CdS for the visible-light P-HER.226 The synergistic effects of phosphorus doping and VS2 decoration resulted in an improvement of the P-HER activity of ZnCdS/CdS. Meanwhile, for decorated P-ZnCdS/CdS, VS2 showed a better co-catalytic performance than WS2 and MoS2. The solar-driven H2 evolution rate exhibited a trend: P-ZnCdS/CdS-VS2 > P-ZnCdS/CdS-WS2 > P-ZnCdS/CdS-MoS2 > P-ZnCdS/CdS > ZnCdS/CdS (Fig. 13d).

ReS2, a new TMD, has attracted lots of attention and is considered a potential candidate to replace other TMDs in various fields.227–230 In addition, an easy synthetic method and suitable band structure make ReS2 a promising co-catalyst for photocatalysis.231,232 Ye et al. used inorganic ReS2 as the co-catalyst coupled with CdS nanorods for the P-HER and found that the CdS/ReS2 composite exhibited an optimal P-HER rate of 137.5 mmol h−1 g−1 in a lactic acid solution, which was 8.8 times larger than that of CdS. Meanwhile, an AQE of 53.6% at 420 nm was achieved over CdS/ReS2.233

3.2.3 2D TMDs as co-catalysts for PE-HER. 
TMDs with high HER activity can also act as co-catalysts to improve the PEC performances of photocathodes. For example, MoS2 fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD-MoS2) was used as the co-catalyst to decorate the Si photocathode.234 The transportation and separation of photo-generated carriers were boosted because of the type II heterojunction between MoS2 and Si. In addition, adopting post-sulfurization at high temperatures can maximize the activity of MoS2, thus further improving the PE-HER activity of the MoS2/Si photocathode. Under one sun illumination, the MoS2/Si photocathode exhibited a reduced overpotential of about 630 mV compared to bare Si and a saturation photocurrent density of 31 mA cm−2 (Fig. 14a). Yan and co-workers found that MoS2 as the co-catalyst not only further improved the PE-HER on the Sb2Se3 photocathode, but also prevented photocorrosion.235 Compared with the bare Sb2Se3/FTO photocathode, the photocurrent density of MoS2/Sb2Se3/FTO showed no significant decrease after three continuous LSV tests. Moreover, the photocurrent density of Sb2Se3/FTO decorated with 30 nm MoS2 at 0 VRHE is 10 mA cm−2, which is larger than that of the bare Sb2Se3/FTO (4.2 mA cm−2) (Fig. 14b and c). Dong et al. used MoS2 as the co-catalyst to modify the CdSe/NiO heteroarchitecture photoelectrode.236 In this system, the CdSe absorbed light and generated electron–hole pairs. The electrons were quickly attracted by MoS2 and took part in the PE-HER, thereby reducing the carrier recombination (Fig. 14d). The CdSe/NiO photoelectrode modified with MoS2 exhibited a significant improvement in the PE-HER properties.

Doping and phase-control can also further improve the co-catalytic performance of TMDs for the PE-HER. Heteroatom (Fe, Co, Ni) doped molybdenum sulfide (MMoSx, M = Fe, Co, Ni) was successfully synthesized and used as the co-catalyst in the PE-HER on a Si photocathode (Si@MMoSx).237 MMoSx with high electrocatalytic activity could offer more catalytic sites for the surface HER than pristine MoS2 (Fig. 14e). Therefore, Si@MMoSx exhibited better PE-HER activity than Si@MoS2. Meanwhile, the Si@CoMoSx photocathode showed an optimal PE-HER activity with a photocurrent density of −17.2 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE, which is much larger than that of the Si@MoS2 (−8.41 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE). The highest ABPE of Si@CoMoSx was ∼0.724% at 0.0857 V vs. RHE (Fig. 14f). Hu et al. prepared a 1T-rich MoS2/g-C3N4 photocathode for the PE-HER.238 An optimal photocurrent density of 37 μA cm−2 was achieved at −0.4 VAg/AgCl, which was 2.8 times larger than that of pure g-C3N4 (Fig. 14g).
Other TMDs can also be used as co-catalysts to improve the PE-HER of photoelectrodes. Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) modified with 2D-NbS2 with abundant HER active sites (edge and basal) as the co-catalyst for the PE-HER were evaluated by Kulandaivel's group.245 The 2D-NbS2-Si NW photocathode exhibited a better PE-HER activity with an anodic onset potential of 0.06 VRHE and a photocurrent density of −28 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE, which was much larger than that of bare Si NWs (0.34 VRHE and −1 mA cm−2) (Fig. 14h).
We summarized the PE-HER activity of recent semiconducting photocathodes modified with TMDs (Table 4).

3.3 MXenes
MXenes as new 2D materials were first reported in 2011241–244 and include few-atom-thick layers of transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides. MXenes exhibit metallic conductivity and have a hydrophilic nature due to their hydroxyl or oxygen terminated surfaces. MXenes have a formula of Mn+1XnTx, where n = 1–3, M is a transition metal (such as Ti, V, Mo, Nb, W and Ta), X is N or C, and T is the functional group (such as –F, –O and –OH).245–248 Generally, MXenes can be synthesized from MAX phases by selectively etching the “A” layer in solutions that contain a fluoride ion (F−), such as hydrofluoric acid (HF), ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2), and a mixture of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and lithium fluoride (LiF).249–256 In addition, MXenes can also be synthesized by the molten salt method in a Lewis acid (usually ZnCl2).257 MXenes have received much attention and been used in various fields, such as supercapacitors, batteries and catalysis, because of their high electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity.258–265 Pan et al. showed that the Gibbs free energies of some MXenes are close to zero, thereby rendering these MXenes potentially useful as superior electrocatalysts for the HER.266 Indeed, more and more researchers are now exploring the use of MXenes for the HER.267–271 For example, Yuan et al. prepared Ti3C2 nanofibers (NFs) and Ti3C2 flakes and compared their HER performances. Because of the more exposed active sites of Ti3C2 NFs, they exhibited a better E-HER activity (a low overpotential of 169 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 97 mV dec−1) than Ti3C2 flakes (385 mV and 188 mV dec−1).272 Definitely, as efficient electrocatalysts, MXenes can also be used as co-catalysts to enhance the solar-driven H2-evolution performance.273–275 In this section, we shall summarize the recent developments in the P-HER and PE-HER activity of photocatalysts coupled with MXenes.

3.3.1 MXenes as co-catalysts for P-HER. 
Among MXenes, Ti3C2 has been used as a co-catalyst to modify various semiconductors, such as CdS,275–277 g-C3N4,278–281 TiO2 (ref. 282–285) and CdLa2S4,286 to enhance the P-HER properties. Wu's group first reported that Ti3C2Tx MXenes served as co-catalysts with TiO2 for the P-HER in 2016. The 5 wt% Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 composite exhibited a 400% enhancement in the P-HER compared with bare TiO2 and had a high AQE of 0.15%.285 Then Qiao's group used Ti3C2 as the co-catalyst to decorate CdS nanospheres for the P-HER.275 A super high P-HER rate of 14342 μmol h−1 g−1 was obtained on 2.5 wt% Ti3C2/CdS (CT2.5), which is about 136.6 times larger than that on CdS. An AQE of 40.1% at 420 nm for CT2.5 was achieved. Moreover, CT2.5 presented a higher P-HER rate than 2.5 wt% Pt-CdS (10978 μmol h−1 g−1), 2.5 wt% NiS-CdS (12953 μmol h−1 g−1), 2.5 wt% Ni-CdS (8649 μmol h−1 g−1) and 2.5 wt% MoS2-CdS (6183 μmol h−1 g−1) (Fig. 15a), indicating the higher co-catalytic performance of Ti3C2. Similarly, Ti3C2/CdLa2S4 exhibited an optimal P-HER rate of 11182.4 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light and an AQE of 15.6% at 420 nm, which were 13.4 and 12 times higher than those of the pristine CdLa2S4.286 Pan's group reported 2D Ti2C as a co-catalyst coupled with 2D g-C3N4 for the P-HER.280 Because of the efficient carrier separation and fast surface HER process after introducing 2D Ti2C, Ti2C/g-C3N4 presented an excellent P-HER rate of 47.5 μmol h−1, which is 14.4 times higher than that of g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the AQE of the P-HER over Ti2C/g-C3N4 reached 4.3% at 420 nm (Fig. 15b and c).

Similar to graphene and TMDs, various strategies (e.g. layer reduction, surface functionalization and hybridization) were explored to improve the HER activity of MXenes. Adjusting the surface functional groups of MXenes can make them have strong interfacial interaction for proton adsorption, which may lead to enhanced HER activity. For example, Jiang et al. showed that O-terminated Ti3C2 had a better E-HER activity (an overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 60.7 mV dec−1) than OH- (217 mV and 88.5 mV dec−1) or F-terminated Ti3C2Tx (266 mV and 109.8 mV dec−1) (Fig. 16a and b).287 In addition, hybridizing MXenes with other highly efficient electrocatalysts can improve the HER performance. Hierarchical MoS2 nanosheets integrated with Ti3C2 were investigated for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The MoS2/Ti3C2 heterostructures exhibited a better E-HER activity with a low overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 compared to the pristine Ti3C2 (∼750 mV at 10 mA cm−2) (Fig. 16c and d).288

As mentioned above, the modified MXenes with enhanced HER activity as co-catalysts could further improve the P-HER performance. Few- or mono-layer Ti3C2 has more active sites for the surface HER than multilayer Ti3C2. Monolayer Ti3C2Tx as the co-catalyst was investigated by Wu's group.282 Compared with pure TiO2 and multilayer Ti3C2Tx/TiO2, the monolayer Ti3C2Tx/TiO2 (5-TC/TO) showed a 9-fold and 2.5-fold increase in the P-HER rate, respectively (Fig. 15d). The AQE of 5-TC/TO was 15.8% at 305 nm. Moreover, monolayer Ti3C2/g-C3N4 exhibited a better P-HER activity than the multilayer Ti3C2 modified g-C3N4.279 Sun et al. synthesized O-terminated Ti3C2 by annealing Ti3C2Tx in air.278 Compared with g-C3N4 modified with Ti3C2 or Ti3C2 annealed in N2, g-C3N4 decorated with O-terminated Ti3C2 exhibited a much higher P-HER rate of 88 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light. The AQE of O-terminated Ti3C2/g-C3N4 reached as high as 1.27%. DFT calculations also demonstrated that the Gibbs free energy of O-terminated Ti3C2 was closer to zero than those of bare Ti3C2 and F-terminated Ti3C2, suggesting the higher HER activity of O-terminated Ti3C2. An et al. reported that g-C3N4/Ti3C2/Pt showed a higher P-HER rate (5.1 mmol h−1 g−1) than g-C3N4/Ti3C2 (1.7 mmol h−1 g−1) and g-C3N4/Pt (1.275 mmol h−1 g−1), respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of g-C3N4/Ti3C2/Pt was about 3.1% at 420 nm.289 Non-noble MoSx and Ti3C2 as a dual co-catalyst with superior HER activity efficiently trapped and transferred photo-generated electrons (Fig. 15e).290 The MoxS@TiO2@Ti3C2 composite exhibited a maximum P-HER rate of 10505.8 μmol h−1 g−1, which was about 193 times larger than that of bare TiO2. An AQE of 7.535% was achieved for the P-HER over MoxS@TiO2@Ti3C2.
Besides Ti3C2, other MXenes can also be co-catalysts in photocatalysis. Su et al. used Nb2C as the co-catalyst to improve the P-HER of Nb2O5.291 Nb2O5/C/Nb2C showed an optimal P-HER rate of 7.81 μmol h−1 g−1, which was four times higher than that of bare Nb2O5. The highest AQE of Nb2O5/C/Nb2C was 0.11% at 305 nm.
We summarize the P-HER properties of MXene-based photocatalysts in Table 5. Layer reduction, functionalization and hybridization can further improve the P-HER performances.

3.3.2 MXenes as co-catalysts for PE-HER. 
The PE-HER activity of the photocathode can be improved by introducing MXenes as co-catalysts. H2 treated Ti3C2Tx (H:Ti3C2Tx) was used as the co-catalyst to modify a Cu2O photocathode for the PE-HER.294 The H:Ti3C2Tx/Cu2O exhibited a higher photocurrent density (−5.41 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE) than pristine Cu2O (−4.02 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE), Ti3C2Tx/Cu2O (−4.45 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE) and Au/Cu2O (−4.31 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE) (Fig. 15f). MXenes can also be used as co-catalysts to improve the PEC performance of the photoanodes. For example, 2D thin Ti3C2Tx-modified BiVO4 exhibited a photocurrent density of 3.45 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which was 1.64 times higher than that of pure BiVO4. A maximum ABPE of 0.78% was achieved for the Ti3C2Tx/BiVO4 at 0.87 VRHE, which was much higher than that of pure BiVO4 (0.45% at 0.89 VRHE).295 Similarly, Ti3C2/TiO2 showed a photocurrent density of 1.94 mA cm−1 at 1.23 VRHE and a maximum ABPE of 1.47%, which was about 6 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (0.32 mA cm−2 and 0.27%).296 The most commonly reported method of compounding MXenes and photoelectrodes is the simple spin coating method, which may make the interface unstable, thereby limiting performance improvement. Studying new methods to combine the MXene and photoelectrode closely is expected to further improve the PE-HER performance.

3.4 Other 2D materials

3.4.1 Other 2D materials as co-catalysts for P-HER. 
In addition to the 2D materials discussed above, other 2D materials, graphdiyne and phosphorene, can also be used as co-catalysts for improving the P-HER of semiconducting photocatalysts. Similar to graphene, graphdiyne is another 2D carbon allotrope whose structure is one-atom-thick planar sheets of sp and sp2-bonded carbon atoms arranged in a crystal lattice. Graphdiyne was put forward several years ago and previous studies mainly focused on the synthesis of monomeric and oligomeric substructures.297 Just recently, Li et al. successfully prepared large-area graphdiyne films on a copper surface by a cross-coupling reaction using hexaethynylbenzene.298 Due to the high conductivity of 2.5 × 10−4 S m−1 and large specific surface area,299 graphdiyne was introduced into g-C3N4 for the P-HER under visible light. 0.5 wt% graphdiyne (GD)/g-C3N4 exhibited a maximum P-HER rate of 39.6 μmol h−1, which was 6.7 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (Fig. 17a).300 Similarly, Lv et al. reported that 2.5 wt% graphdiyne/CdS exhibited the highest P-HER rate, exceeding that of CdS 2.6-fold (Fig. 17b).301 Phosphorene, a single layer of black phosphorous, is a 2D material and allotrope of phosphorus. There are two main methods, such as scotch-tape-based microcleavage and liquid exfoliation, to prepare phosphorene.302–304 Because of the large surface area and abundant active sites, phosphorene (1.0 wt%) modified CdS showed an optimal P-HER rate of 11192 μmol h−1 g−1, which was 11.6 times higher than that of pure CdS (Fig. 17c).305 Meanwhile, a high AQE of 34.7% at 420 nm was acquired over phosphorene/CdS. Moreover, the phosphorene/g-C3N4 nanocomposite showed a high P-HER rate of 571 μmol h−1 g−1, which was ∼13 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (Fig. 17d).306 1.8 wt% phosphorene/g-C3N4 exhibited an AQE of 1.2% at 420 nm.

3.4.2 Other 2D materials as co-catalysts for PE-HER. 
Graphdiyne can be applied as a co-catalyst for improving the PE-HER activity of photocathodes. For example, Li et al. prepared graphdiyne (GDY)/CdSe for the PE-HER with a high photocurrent density of ∼70 μA cm−2 at a potential of 0 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.8).307 GDY/BiVO4 showed a lower onset potential of 0.4 VRHE and a higher photocurrent density of ∼1.32 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE than a pure BiVO4 photoelectrode (0.6 VRHE and 0.66 mA cm−2).308 GDY with high hole mobility and conductivity as the co-catalyst effectively accelerated the separation and transmission of electron–hole pairs in the PE-HER process. However, the preparation process of GDY is complicated, and it is difficult to ensure that the transfer process does not destroy the structure of GDY when preparing PEC cells.309 It is very necessary to grow graphyne directly with well-designed structures on the substrate, which helps to maintain the good quality and special structures of GDY. Currently, the work on this topic still needs to further be explored.

4. Summary and perspectives
In principle, the P-HER process, where the electrons are generated by photons, is the same as the electrocatalytic HER, in which the electrons are provided by an external voltage source. Due to the similarity of the requirements (high conductivity, large specific surface area and abundant active sites) of electrocatalysts and co-catalysts, we propose a new concept that “electrocatalysts can be used as co-catalysts to improve solar-driven H2 production”, which will provide a clear direction for co-catalyst selection. A large number of reports and our previous works confirmed our concept.16,20,23,24,221,222,280 To be an efficient co-catalyst, the electrocatalyst needs to satisfy three basic requirements: (i) excellent HER activity, (ii) suitable band alignment with the semiconductor, and (iii) tight contact with the host matrix. Normally, co-catalysts with outstanding HER activity show excellent co-catalytic performances for enhanced solar-driven H2 generation.
In the review, we systematically review the P-HER and PE-HER properties of photocatalysts with 2D electrocatalysts as co-catalysts (2D co-catalysts), including graphene, TMDs, MXenes and other 2D materials. It is clearly shown that these 2D co-catalysts can improve the P-HER and PE-HER performances of semiconducting photocatalysts. Various methods to optimize the E-HER activity of co-catalysts, such as phase-control, doping, defect engineering, and hybridization, can be used to improve the P-HER performance of decorated photocatalysts (Fig. 18). Generally, for the same photocatalytic system, a co-catalyst with higher electrocatalytic HER activity can enhance the P-HER performance more effectively.
 Fig. 18  Representative methods for improving the P-HER performance of decorated photocatalysts. 
Although the 2D co-catalysts could enhance the photocatalytic activity of photocatalysts for hydrogen production, and encouraging results have been achieved, there are still some problems that need to be solved: on one hand, for graphene and TMDs, the rather weak bonding between the layers makes the structure amenable to exfoliation, which limits their wide application in photocatalysis. The large-scale preparation of MXenes by non-toxic methods is urgent for the practical application. On the other hand, a strict standard is urgently needed to fairly compare the performances of different photocatalysts. A simple comparison of H2 production rates is not rigorous enough because of the effects of different sacrificial agents, photocatalyst mass and light intensity. In addition, there are few studies on the interface between the co-catalyst and main catalyst, and more advanced characterization techniques (e.g. in situ TEM and in situ XPS) are urgently needed to detect the interface and observe the charge transfer at the interface during the photocatalysis process. Therefore, the study of efficient co-catalysts to improve the performance of photocatalytic H2-evolution and the practical application of photocatalytic hydrogen production still have a long way to go.
