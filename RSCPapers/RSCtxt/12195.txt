    , Accepted 19th December 2022First published on 19th December 2022AbstractAlthough flexible fiber supercapacitors with two-dimensional active nanomaterials are promising for powering miniaturized wearable electronics, there is difficulty in establishing full contact between fiber electrodes and electrolytes, which causes extremely tortuous ion pathways and sluggish ion kinetics, seriously limiting their electrochemical performances. In this study, numerous radially oriented channels were constructed in MXene/reduced graphene oxide/PEDOT:PSS hybrid fiber electrodes by hydrothermal assembly and subsequent radial-freezing to create the shortest ion diffusion pathways and significantly increase the kinetics of the surface electrochemical reactions. The optimal fiber electrode delivers a high capacitance of up to 475 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and a competitive rate performance of 366 F g−1 at 1000 mV s−1. The flexible fiber supercapacitor assembled with the fiber electrodes and the anti-freezing electrolyte with an ionic liquid not only exhibits a high energy density of 10.11 W h kg−1 at 80 W kg−1 but also possesses excellent cold resistance with a capacitance retention of 70.5% at an ultralow temperature of −40 °C. Constructing radially oriented channels in fiber electrodes offers a ground-breaking strategy to ameliorate ion accessibility and provide fast ion migration pathways for efficiently enhancing the electrochemical performances of flexible fiber supercapacitors at ultralow temperatures.
1 Introduction
The rapid development of foldable and wearable electronic equipment over the past few years calls for high energy storage devices.1–3 Flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitors are ideal for powering a wide range of wearable electronics because of their good wearability, light weight, fast charge and discharge ability, high power density, and good cycling stability.4–10 The electrode materials that can reversibly adsorb–desorb ions are of critical importance for fiber supercapacitors. Two-dimensional (2D) functional nanomaterials such as graphenes11 and MXenes12 have been extensively investigated for fiber electrodes because of their large surface area, high electronic conductivity, and strong interlayer forces.
Early transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) not only possess a high conductivity of ∼105 S cm−1 and a large specific surface area, but also could generate layered structures with adjustable interlayer spacing, benefiting their application as supercapacitor electrode materials for reversibly storing ions during charge–discharge processes.13–18 Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets can be obtained by selectively etching aluminum elements from layered carbide Ti3AlC2, followed by exfoliation.19–21 Different from the inert surface of conductive graphenes, conductive MXenes are hydrophilic because of their abundant surface terminal groups.22 Recently, MXene-based films,23–26 aerogels,27–29 hydrogels,30,31 and fibers32–35 have been fabricated as electrode materials of supercapacitors, exhibiting high capacitances, superior rate performances, and long cycling life. For example, Razal et al. used a conventional wet spinning process to prepare MXene/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) fibers and MXene/PEDOT:PSS hybrid fibers, which exhibited high capacitances of 341 F cm−3 and 285 F g−1, respectively.36,37 Gao et al. assembled MXene nanosheets into macroscopic fibers with a regular alignment on the basis of the synergistic effect between graphene oxide (GO) liquid crystals and MXene nanosheets, leading to a high capacitance of 890 F cm−3 by high-temperature hydroiodic acid reduction of GO.1 Gogotsi et al. obtained additive-free MXene fibers with a capacitance of 434 F g−1 by precisely controlling the nematic liquid crystal phase and the flake size of the MXene nanosheets.38 These results indicate that the MXene fibers are promising for high-electrochemical performance supercapacitor electrodes.
Despite these promising progresses, the dense structure of most MXene-based fiber electrodes is not conducive to full contact with electrolytes, and consequently, causes insufficient charge transfer at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces, and hinders ion diffusion in the electrolyte and ion transport in the electrodes, thus limiting the charge storage capacity of the fiber electrodes. The ion transport pathways in the electrode materials can be expressed by tortuosity, which is related to the effective diffusion rate of ions in the electrolyte to the electrode materials.39–44 The ion transport efficiency of a fiber supercapacitor can be increased by decreasing the tortuosity of the fiber electrodes via their structural design and optimization. The ionic transport along both the axial and radial directions is hard to be achieved in solid dense fiber electrodes, which has long been ignored in most studies.
Therefore, to improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics of fiber supercapacitors, in this work, for the first time, radially oriented porous channels were constructed in the fiber electrodes to minimize the tortuosity, thus improving the electron/ion transport efficiency significantly by efficiently increasing the ion accessibility and providing sufficient fast ion pathways. Ti3C2Tx MXene hybrid fibers with numerous radially oriented porous channels are synthesized by hydrothermal assembly of the MXene nanosheets in the presence of GO and PEDOT:PSS followed by radial-freezing and freeze-drying. During the hydrothermal assembly process, GO nanosheets are reduced chemically and assembled into an interconnecting RGO framework for accommodating the conductive MXene nanosheets.23,24,45 As a conductive binder, PEDOT:PSS can glue the MXene and GO nanosheets and inhibit the self-stacking of the MXene and GO nanosheets via electrostatic interactions, providing structural stability and flexibility that are essential for long-life cycling of the fiber electrodes.46–48 The numerous radially oriented porous channels in the fiber electrodes provide fast ion pathways and thus improve the energy storage performances. As a result, an optimal electrode shows a high capacitance of 475 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1, a competitive rate performance of 366 F g−1 at 1000 mV s−1, and a stable cycling performance of 83% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.
Besides, to address the challenges of poor performances of the fiber supercapacitors in cold environments,49 we designed an anti-freezing gel electrolyte by replacing partial water in conventional gel electrolytes with an ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate (EMIES), with both high ionic conductivity and extremely low freezing point,50,51 obtaining the EMIES/PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte. The fiber supercapacitor assembled with the fiber electrodes and the anti-freezing gel electrolyte achieves a high energy density of 10.11 W h kg−1 and a large power density of 1600 W kg−1. Impressively, the assembled fiber supercapacitor in this work exhibits excellent cold-resistance even at −40 °C, maintains transparency and foldability, and delivers a high capacitance retention of 70.5%, pioneering the utilization of MXene fiber supercapacitors at ultralow temperatures. By applying the as-assembled fiber supercapacitors with a solar panel, a day–night cycle self-powered system was designed to achieve sustainable energy conversion and storage.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets
Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets were prepared by selectively etching Al species from the Ti3AlC2 power purchased from 11 Technology (China). First, 4.8 g of LiF (Aladdin) was dissolved in 60 mL of 9 M HCl (Beijing Chemical Reagents) in a Teflon vessel. Then, 3 g of Ti3AlC2 powder was added slowly into the LiF/HCl solution, and the mixture was kept at 35 °C for 24 h under constant stirring to obtain a clay-like Ti3C2Tx dispersion. The solid residue (multilayered Ti3C2Tx) was obtained by centrifuging at 9000 rpm and washed with deionized water until the pH was close to 7. Subsequently, multilayered Ti3C2Tx was exfoliated to Ti3C2Tx nanosheets in water by sonicating under an argon flow for 60 min. Finally, the Ti3C2Tx dispersion was purified by centrifuging at 3500 rpm for 60 min and configured to a concentration of 10 mg mL−1.
2.2 Synthesis of graphene oxide nanosheets
Graphite oxide was synthesized by oxidizing graphite flakes (1000 mesh, Huadong Graphite Factory) by the modified Hummers' method.11,48 The obtained graphite oxide powder was configured to a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 and sonicated for 30 min to obtained the aqueous GO dispersion.
2.3 Synthesis of MXene/RGO/PEDOT:PSS hybrid fibers
The as-prepared Ti3C2Tx MXene and GO dispersions were mixed in a ratio of 8:1 under magnetic stirring and ultrasonicated for 30 min to achieve MXene/GO dispersion with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1. After a small amount of a PEDOT:PSS dispersion (10 mg mL−1 Heraeus Deutschland GmbH) was added into the MXene/GO dispersion (9 mL), the mixture was mixed with 10 mg of ascorbic acid (chemical reductant) and then injected into a capillary with an inner diameter of 0.9 mm for hydrothermal assembly. The capillary with both ends sealed was placed in an oven at 85 °C for 3 h, during which the nanosheets were self-assembled and the GO component was partially reduced to RGO. The resulting hydrogel fibers with 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mL of the PEDOT:PSS dispersions as raw materials were designated as MGP1, MGP2, MGP3, and MGP4, respectively. The MXene/RGO/PEDOT hybrid fibers with radially oriented channel structure were fabricated by radially freezing the hydrogel fibers. The n-hexane solution bath located in the ethyl acetate solid–liquid mixture cooled by liquid nitrogen was utilized as the −80 °C cold source. The hydrogel fibers were pulled out from their glass tubes and put vertically into the n-hexane coagulating bath for radial freezing for 5 min. Finally, the frozen fibers were freeze-dried at −80 °C and 20 Pa for 48 h to obtain the hybrid fibers with radially oriented porous channels.
2.4 Characterization
The microstructures of GO and MXene nanosheets were observed using a Hitachi HT-7700 transmission electron microscope (TEM). The surface morphology and cross-sectional structure of the fibers were characterized using a Hitachi S-4700 scanning electron microscope (SEM). SAXS measurements were performed using a Xenocs XEUSS 2.0 SAXS equipment with a Genix3D X-ray beam delivery system at 50 kV and 0.6 mA, and the signals were collected using a Dectris Pilatus3 R 200K-A detector, which were placed 2488 mm away from the samples. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the fibers were measured using a TriStar II 3020 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analyzer. The tensile properties of the fibers with a gauge length of 25 mm were measured using an Instron universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 5 mm min−1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and Raman spectra were obtained using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer and a LabRAM high-resolution Raman spectrometer. The chemical compositions of the hybrid fibers were analyzed using an ESCALAB 250 high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The zeta potentials of MXene, GO, PEDOT:PSS, and MGP hybrid suspensions were measured using a Malvern Nano-ZS Zetasizer. A Lecia TCS SP8 DLS laser confocal microscope was used to record the fluorescence of Rhodamine B in the cross-section of the fibers. The freezing point of the electrolyte was evaluated using a ETZSCH 214 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The sample was first cooled from room temperature to −120 °C and then heated to 20 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1.
2.5 Electrochemical performance measurements
Electrochemical performances of the fiber electrodes were measured using a Chenhua CHI 660 electrochemical workstation (China) including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Three-electrode electrochemical tests were performed in plastic Swagelok cells using a 3 M H2SO4 electrolyte with glassy carbon electrodes as current collectors. The Ag/AgCl electrode and activated carbon were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. A piece of cropped Celgard paper was used as the separator. The gravimetric specific capacitance (Cg) was calculated by the gravimetric charge integrated from the CV curves using eqn (1): Cg = 1/(ΔV × mv) ∫idV(1)where V is the potential window (0.8 V), m is the mass of the working electrode (g), v is the scan rate (V s−1), and i represents the current density (A g−1).
2.6 Fabrication and electrochemical measurements of fiber supercapacitors
First, 3 g of PVA (1799, Aladdin) was added into a mixture of 7.5 mL 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate (EMIES) ionic liquid and 22.5 mL DI water under stirring at 85 °C, obtaining a transparent and uniform EMIES/PVA solution. The gel electrolyte was prepared by adding 3 g of 98% H2SO4 into 30 mL of the EMIES/PVA solution (10 wt%) drop by drop. The symmetric fiber supercapacitor was fabricated as follows: two D-MGP3 fibers (1.5 cm, 0.04 mg each) were put in parallel on a polyethylene film substrate and the gel electrolyte was deposited on them, followed by drying at 40 °C for 40 min until the electrolyte became solid. The gravimetric specific capacitance (Cg) of the fiber supercapacitor was calculated from the GCD curves using eqn (2): Cg = i/(dV/dt)(2)
The gravimetric energy density (Eg) was calculated from the GCD curves using eqn (3): Eg = I(∫Vdt)(3)where I stands for the discharging current density, t is the discharging time, and V is the voltage of the symmetric cell. The power density (Pg) was further evaluated based on eqn (4): Pg = Eg/Δt(4)
3 Results and discussion
3.1 MXene/RGO/PEDOT:PSS hybrid fibers with radially oriented porous channels

Fig. 1 illustrates the synthesis process of MXene/RGO/PEDOT:PSS hybrid fibers and the formation mechanisms of the radially oriented channels. The MXene nanosheets were prepared by selectively etching the aluminum layers of the precursor Ti3AlC2 (MAX) with a LiF/HCl mixture.52–54 The exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets show ultrathin and rigid laminar structures with sizes of 0.5–1 μm (Fig. S1a†); while the GO nanosheets prepared by the Hummers' method have a larger size of 10–20 μm and wrinkled surfaces55 (Fig. S1b†). The conductive PEDOT:PSS binder was added into the MXene/GO suspension to connect both the MXene and GO nanosheets, which can alleviate the structural change of the fiber electrodes during subsequent charge/discharge processes.37,56 After adding ascorbic acid (VC) as a reducing agent of GO, the well mixed reactants were injected into a glass capillary, and both ends of the capillary were sealed. The GO can assist the assembling of the MXene sheets because of the strong gelation capability of the GO. The hydrothermal self-assembly of the reactants occurred at 85 °C for 3 h, during which the GO was partially reduced to RGO, while the MXene sheets were assembled onto the surface of the RGO framework, obtaining the MGP hydrogel fibers.

Subsequently, the hydrogel fiber was vertically placed in a −80 °C cold coagulation bath for radial freezing. The outer layer of the container contains a mixture of ethyl acetate and liquid nitrogen, while the inner layer is an n-hexane solution. Driven by the temperature gradients, the numerous ice crystals would grow along the radial directions of the fiber from the fiber periphery to the centre. After freeze-drying to sublime the ice crystals, the MGP fiber with radially oriented channels was obtained. The MXene/GO mass ratio of 8:1 is optimal for the hybrid fiber with optimal structure. The PEDOT:PSS/MXene mass ratios of 1/32, 1/16, 3/32, and 1/8 were also adopted, and the corresponding directionally-frozen hybrid fibers were designated as D-MGP1, D-MGP2, D-MGP3, and D-MGP4, respectively. For comparison, similar hybrid fibers were also prepared by random freezing and subsequent freeze-drying of the hydrogel fibers without the radial-freezing step, and denoted as U-MGP1, U-MGP2, U-MGP3, and U-MGP4.
The cross-sectional structures of the D- and U-type hybrid fibers were evaluated with SEM observation. The U-MGP3 fiber shows a tightly packed layered structure along the axis due to the steric hindrance effect during the hydrothermal self-assembly process (Fig. 2a–c). In contrast, D-MGP3 obtained through radial freezing at −80 °C exhibits obvious radial channels with a width of ∼5 μm (Fig. 2d–f). The growth of the ice crystals along the temperature gradients makes the MXene and RGO flakes align radially to form numerous radial porous channels. Compared to U-MGP3 with a dense mesh surface structure (Fig. S2a and b†), the D-MGP3 presents a large number of circular pores with pore sizes of about 5–10 μm (Fig. S2c and d†), which is consistent with the width of the channels in D-MGP3 (Fig. 2f), close to the size of an icicle.57 Similarly, D-MGP1, D-MGP2 and D-MGP4 fibers with different proportions of PEDOT:PSS also exhibit the radially oriented porous channels (Fig. S3†). However, the surfaces of the D-MGP1 and D-MGP2 fibers have less pores because the stacking of MXene and RGO nanosheets inhibits the ice crystal growth (Fig. S3d and h†). The channels in the D-MGP4 are not continuous and the polymer agglomerates are observed on the fiber surface due to the excess of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S3k and l†). Therefore, D-MGP3 with optimal radially oriented channels would be suitable for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes because of the constructed high-speed ion pathways. According to the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S4†), U-MGP3 has a specific surface area of 11.2 m2 g−1 and an average pore diameter of 5.14 nm with a pore volume of 0.011 cm3 g−1, while D-MGP3 has a higher specific surface area of 54.4 m2 g−1 and a higher average pore diameter of 7.83 nm with a larger pore volume of 0.083 cm3 g−1, which is attributed to the radially oriented channel structures. Besides, D-MGP3 exhibits good mechanical properties with a tensile strength of 118 MPa and an elongation at break of 100.9% (Fig. S5†). The radially oriented structures constructed with MXene and RGO are evaluated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns. As shown in the scattering patterns (Fig. 2g and h), compared to U-MGP3 with the same intensity in all directions, D-MGP3 presents the concentrated and intensive scattering intensity in the extracted azimuthal profile plot. D-MGP3 fiber exhibits a smaller full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the azimuthal plot at the (002) peak (Fig. 2i), confirming its higher orientation extent than that of U-MGP3.

The Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets were obtained by selectively etching the aluminum layer of Ti3AlC2 followed by ultrasonic exfoliation. As shown in the XRD patterns (Fig. 3a), compared with Ti3AlC2, Ti3C2Tx shows a strong (002) diffraction peak at a smaller 2θ of 6.7°, corresponding to an enlarged interlayer spacing of 1.31 nm. Fig. S6† shows the XRD patterns of RGO and GO. The (002) crystal plane diffraction peak of RGO becomes intense and shifts from 10.3° to 24.8°, corresponding to the decrease in interlayer spacing due to the partial removal of the oxygen-containing groups by the chemical reduction.58 The presence of Ti3C2Tx, RGO and PEDOT:PSS components in D-MGP3 was further confirmed by the XRD patterns (Fig. 3b). The (002) diffraction peak of Ti3C2Tx shifts from 6.7° to 6.1° of the D-MGP3, corresponding to an intra-gallery increase from 1.31 to 1.45 nm. These results prove the well-preserved structure of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets after the hydrothermal process and the enlarged interlayer spacing due to the intercalation of RGO and PEDOT:PSS. The FT-IR spectrum of the D-MGP3 with the characteristic absorption peaks of PEDOT:PSS also indicates the combination of MXene and RGO with PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S7†). Thanks to the abundant surface terminal groups (–F, –O, and –OH), the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets are hydrophilic and can be dispersed homogeneously in water.52,59–61 The same goes for GO nanosheets with abundant oxygen-containing groups. The zeta potential data (Fig. 3c) indicate that Ti3C2Tx, GO and PEDOT:PSS suspensions are all negatively charged. PEDOT:PSS can enhance the electrostatic repulsion between Ti3C2Tx and GO nanosheets, thereby facilitating their regular arrangement. Thus, stable MXene/GO/PEDOT:PSS colloidal suspension is readily obtained after stirring by virtue of the hydrophilicity and the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent nanosheets, evidenced by the typical Tyndall effect (Fig. S8†). During the hydrothermal process of D-MGP3, MXene and GO nanosheets are assembled by their van der Waals forces (Fig. 3d), and the π–π interaction between the thiophene ring of PEDOT and the GO can stabilize the structure.24,61Fig. 3e illustrates the interactions among the surface functional groups of Ti3C2Tx, RGO and PEDOT:PSS, consisting of hydrogen bonding between PSS and –COOH/OH of RGO, as well as the electrostatic interactions between the thiophene ring of the PEDOT/benzene ring of PSS and –COO– of RGO.62

(e) Interactions between RGO, Ti3C2Tx, and PEDOT:PSS. 
The Raman spectra of the hybrid fibers are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The two peaks of Ti3C2Tx at 198 and 715 cm−1 are attributed to the out of plane vibrations of Ti and C atoms, while its peaks at 280, 386, and 615 cm−1 correspond to the in-plane (shear) vibrations of Ti, C, and surface functional group atoms, respectively.24,63 The two broad bands at 1347 and 1593 cm−1 in the spectrum of RGO are typical D and G bands of graphitic carbon. As for PEDOT:PSS, its peaks at 1268 and 998 cm−1 bands are ascribed to C–C stretching and oxyethylene ring deformation, respectively. Its bands at 854 and 438 cm−1 are attributed to the C–O bending vibrations and C–O–C bond deformation, respectively.37 All the characteristics of Ti3C2Tx MXene, RGO, and PEDOT:PSS are present in the Raman spectrum of D-MGP3, proving that all species are well retained. To confirm the chemical composition and surface electronic states in the hybrid fibers, the XPS spectra of D-MGP3, MXene, RGO, and PEDOT:PSS are shown in Fig. 4c. The hybrid fiber is mainly composed of C, Ti, O, and F elements. Compared with pure Ti3C2Tx, the C 1s and O 1s signals of D-MGP3 are significantly enhanced because of the addition of GO. The newly appearing S 2s and S 2p signals derive from PEDOT:PSS. The high-resolution C 1s spectra of D-MGP3, Ti3C2Tx MXene, and RGO are shown in Fig. 4d. The C 1s spectrum of D-MGP3 can be fitted with five components centered at 281.8, 282.7, 284.8, 286.1, and 288.7 eV, which could be assigned to C–Ti, Ti–CO, C–C, C–O/C–S, and O–CO/C–F bonds, respectively.24Fig. 4e shows the high-resolution Ti 2p spectra of D-MGP3, and Ti3C2Tx MXene. The Ti 2p3/2 located at 455.2, 456.3, and 458.8 eV correspond to Ti–C, Ti(II), and Ti–O bonds, respectively; while the Ti 2p1/2 components of Ti–C, Ti(II), and Ti–O bonds are located at 461.2, 461.9, and 463.1 eV, respectively.42,64Fig. 4f shows that the position of S 2p components in D-MGP3 is consistent with that of PEDOT:PSS. These XPS results indicate that the intrinsic structure of Ti3C2Tx and RGO sheets are well retained during the hydrothermal assembly and radial freezing, which is essential to ensure the excellent electrochemical performances of the hybrid fiber electrodes.

3.2 Electrochemical behaviors of hybrid fibers
The electrochemical performances of the as-prepared hybrid fibers were evaluated using a three-electrode system with 3 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. Fig. 5a compares the CV curves of the D-MGP hybrid fibers with different PEDOT:PSS dosages at 10 mV s−1. Obviously, all samples exhibit a pair of broad redox peaks at −0.4–0.2 V, ascribed to a pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism of the reversible redox-active protons derived from the continuous oxidation state changes of the exposed Ti atoms in the MXene.65 The CV curves at 10 mV s−1 show that D-MGP3 has the largest area as compared with D-MGP1, D-MGP2, and D-MGP4, indicating its superior energy storage ability, which is consistent with the optimal radially oriented porous channel structure (Fig. 2d–f and S3†). These results indicate that the PEDOT:PSS dosage has an important effect on the regularity of the porous channel structure. On the one hand, the PEDOT:PSS can connect the nanosheets, facilitating the formation of continuous conductive paths and stabilizing the channel structure. On the other hand, the excessive macromolecular chains would agglomerate on the nanosheets. Fig. 5b shows the charge and discharge behaviour of the as-prepared hybrid fibers at 1 A g−1. All of the curves exhibit nearly symmetric nonlinear profiles with apparent inflections, deviating from the typical triangular shape of the electric double layer capacitance, further confirming the pseudocapacitance energy storage mechanism in nature with the reversible redox-activity.42,43,65–67 The EIS and the equivalent circuit fitting parameters of the Nyquist plots were used to explore charge transfer and ion migration behaviour in the hybrid fibers (Fig. 5c and d). In the equivalent circuit in Fig. 5c, Rs represents the series resistance including the internal impedance of the electrolyte and electrode, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. For the hybrid fibers with radially oriented channels, D-MGP3 shows the smallest series resistance of 0.579 Ω, as compared to those of D-MGP1 (1.315 Ω), D-MGP2 (1.091 Ω), and D-MGP4 (1.763 Ω), indicating that the optimum assembly structure can improve the conductivity of the hybrid fibers and hence benefit the enhancement in capacitance performance (Table S1†). The CV curves at scan rates of 5–1000 mV s−1 and the GCD curves at 0.25–2.5 A g−1 of the hybrid fiber electrodes are shown in Fig. 5e–h and S9.† D-MGP3 electrode exhibits the highest gravimetric capacitance of 475 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, much higher than those of D-MGP1 (400 F g−1), D-MGP2 (421 F g−1), and D-MGP4 (373 F g−1) (Fig. 5i), which is competitive to recently reported MXene-based electrode materials (Table S2†).

Fig. 6a compares the CV curves of D-MGP3 and U-MGP3 at 10 mV s−1. The CV curves at different scan rates and the GCD curves at different current densities of U-MGP3 are shown in Fig. S10.† As expected, the capacitance of U-MGP3 with a tightly packed layered structure is 397 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, much lower than that of D-MGP3 (475 F g−1, Fig. 5i). The tortuosity (τ) of the electrode is related to the porosity (ε) and Bruggeman exponent (α) according to the Bruggeman relationship as follows: τ = εα(5)

(i) Cycling stability under voltages of −0.6–0.2 V at a current density of 25 A g−1 after 10000 cycles with an inset showing the GCD curves of the last 10 cycles. 
Under the ideal condition, the nanosheets are continuous and vertically aligned (Fig. S11a†), the α value is 0; thus, the tortuosity would be the minimum value of 1, corresponding to a low-tortuous electrode with the fastest ion transport. In the case of the electrode composed of isotropic and randomly distributed nanosheets (Fig. S11b†), the α value is commonly less than or equal to −0.5, and the value of tortuosity (τ) is larger than or equal to ε−0.5, indexed to a tortuous electrode. Thus, the hybrid fibers with radial channels exhibit good electrochemical performances due to the fast ion transport pathways benefiting from the minimum tortuosity. (Fig. S11c†) The CV data at different scan rates are analysed to investigate the charge storage mechanisms of the hybrid fibers with the radially oriented channel structure. The relationship between current (i) and scan rates (v) obeys the power-law in eqn (6): i = avb(6)where a and b are adjustable parameters. The log(v)–log(i) plots can be linearly fitted and the b value can be obtained from the slope. For a diffusion-controlled process, of which the capacitance is from the battery-type faradaic intercalation, the b-value is 0.5, whereas for a non-diffusion controlled capacitive process, of which the capacitance is the sum of the electric double layer capacitance and surface pseudo-capacitance based on the fast faradaic charge transfer with surface atoms, the b-value is 1.43 All of the calculated b-values of D-MGP3 and U-MGP3 are shown in Fig. 6b and c. Almost all of the b-values are larger than 0.9, indicating the predominance of the non-diffusion controlled process. The b-values estimated from the anodic and cathodic peaks of the CV curves of D-MGP3 are 0.96/0.91, larger than those of U-MGP3 (0.93/0.89), indicating a higher non-diffusion controlled contribution, which is attributed to the fast ion pathways provided by the radially oriented porous channels.

Fig. 6d exhibits the EIS results of D-MGP3 and U-MGP3. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of D-MGP3 is 0.284 Ω, much lower than that of U-MGP3 (0.718 Ω, Table S1†), indicating that the radially oriented channels provide the fast and efficient transfer of charges at the interfaces due to the direct access available for the electrolyte ions to the surface of the fiber electrodes, which improves the overall capacitive performances. The increased charge storage ability for the hybrid fiber electrodes can be evaluated quantitatively by analysing the current response. i(V) is the combination of capacitor-like and diffusion-controlled behaviours calculated using eqn (7): i(V) = k1v + k2v1/2(7)
The above-mentioned formula could also be reformulated as follows: i(V)/v1/2 = k1v1/2 + k2(8)
By plotting i(V)/v1/2versus v1/2 under different potentials, the constants k1 and k2 could be evaluated from the slope and intercept (Fig. S12†). Thus, the current contribution from the capacitive effect (k1v) and the diffusion-controlled intercalation processes (k2v1/2) can be differentiated quantitatively. The non-diffusion controlled parts of D-MGP3 and U-MGP3 measured at 10 mV s−1 are shaded in yellow (Fig. 6e and f). The capacitive contribution of the D-MGP3 accounts for 86% out of the total charge storage at 10 mV s−1. The total non-diffusion controlled contributions (Fig. 6g and h) calculated at scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV s−1 are 83, 86, 87, 90, and 93% for D-MGP3, and 79, 81, 83, 87, and 90% for U-MGP3, respectively. These results indicate that the non-diffusion controlled charge storage rather than diffusion-controlled battery-type process dominates the entire capacitance, particularly at high scan rates. It is obvious that in D-MGP3 with the radial porous channels, the contribution of the non-diffusion controlled capacitance is larger than that of U-MGP3 with the random structure, indicating that the radial porous channels are beneficial for the capacitance performances. Besides, the hybrid fibers with the radial channels exhibit good rate performances due to the fast ion transport pathways. The capacitance retention of the D-MGP3 is 77% when the scan rate increases by 200 times (365 F g−1 at 1000 mV s−1), whereas U-MGP3 has a capacitance retention of 66% because of the poor structural stability and hindered ion transport (Fig. 5i).
The radially oriented channels of D-MGP3 increase the contact area between the fiber electrodes and the electrolyte, providing sufficient fast ion transport pathways in all directions in the electrolyte. To investigate the increased interface integration benefiting from the radially oriented channels, the hybrid fibers were immersed into the electrolyte dyed with Rhodamine B for 2 h, and a fluorescent microscope was used to observe the fluorescence intensity between the fiber and the electrolyte. As demonstrated in the cross-sectional images (Fig. S13†), compared to U-MGP3 that shows fluorescence only in the outer layer, D-MGP3 are filled with fluorescence, implying the excellent ion accessibility and sufficient contact between the D-MGP3 fiber electrodes and the electrolyte. Besides, D-MGP3 exhibits good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 83% and a coulombic efficiency of 96% after 10000 cycles in virtue of the structural stability (Fig. 6i).
3.3 Electrochemical performances of D-MGP3-based fiber supercapacitors
With the EMIES/PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte and the D-MGP3 electrodes, all-solid-state fiber supercapacitors were assembled, and their electrochemical performances were investigated in two-electrode symmetric cells. The CV curves of the fiber supercapacitor at different scan rates exhibit rectangle-like shape with no distinct redox peaks, which is typical for symmetric supercapacitors (Fig. 7a). The GCD curves show a triangular shape, confirming the dominant capacitive properties (Fig. 7b). The supercapacitor shows a capacitance of 113 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 96% (Fig. 7c). The supercapacitor exhibits a capacitance of 71 F g−1 at a current density of 4 A g−1, 63% retention of the initial capacitance, and 57 F g−1 at a current density of 20 A g−1, 50% retention of the initial capacitance, demonstrating the good rate performances of the supercapacitor. For scalability exploration, three of the fiber supercapacitors were directly integrated in series and parallel, which can increase the output voltage or total capacitances (Fig. 7d). The cycling stability of the fiber supercapacitor was investigated on the basis of the galvanostatic charge/discharge tests at a current of 1 A g−1. After 10000 charge/discharge cycles, the fiber supercapacitor retains 82% of the initial capacitance with a coulombic efficiency of 97%, exhibiting a long cycle life (Fig. 7e). Besides, the fiber supercapacitor exhibits a capacitance retention of 83% after 10000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. S14†). The Ragone plots of the D-MGP3-based fiber supercapacitor show the competitive volumetric energy density of 10.11 W h kg−1 at 80 W kg−1 (Fig. 7f), which are comparable with those of previously reported symmetric supercapacitors based on MXenes, rGO, and PEDOT:PSS, including MXene/rGO hybrid fiber (7.27 W h kg−1 at 329 W kg−1),1 rGO/PEDOT:PSS (1.41 W h kg−1 at 13.79 W kg−1),3 Ti3C2Tx/rGO aerogel (7.5 W h kg−1 at 500 W kg−1),27 knittable MXene/rGO hybrid fiber (3.84 W h kg−1 at 15.07 W kg−1),36 Ti3C2Tx/PEDOT:PSS fiber (2.99 W h kg−1 at 84 W kg−1),37 and porous Ti3C2Tx aerogel (6.1 W h kg−1 at 200 W kg−1).68

(i) Photographs of the self-powered system with the fiber supercapacitors charged by a solar panel for powering the lighting device. 
To use the sustainable solar energy, a solar panel that can convert clean solar energy to electricity was used to replace the electrochemical workstation to charge the fiber supercapacitors. The designed self-powered archetype consists of a solar panel and three fiber supercapacitors connected in series for energy storage (Fig. 7g). As shown in Fig. 7h, the red light-emitting diode (LED) supplied by a solar panel can be lightened only when the solar light is on, whereas it will extinguish instantly when the solar light turns off. The electricity generated by the solar panel can only be exported directly, but cannot be stored. In contrast, in the self-powered system, the solar light can not only be harvested and converted into electricity via the solar panel, but also be stored by the fiber supercapacitors, which can still supply energy when the solar light is off. As described in Fig. 7i and Video S1,† after absorbing ambient sunlight for 30 s only, the fiber supercapacitors connected in series can be charged with enough energy to light up the red LED. This integrated system of the solar panel and the supercapacitors for sustainable energy conversion, storage and output can store energy under sufficient sunlight illumination and release the energy in a dark environment, exhibiting a promising application prospect in day–night cycle self-powered system.
3.4 Low-temperature resistances of fiber supercapacitors
The EMIES ionic liquid is added in the gel electrolyte to decrease the freezing point of the electrolyte (Fig. S15†), thereby broadening the temperature limit for the application of the fiber supercapacitors. To evaluate the low-temperature resistances, the as-assembled fiber supercapacitor was placed in an environmental chamber for electrochemical behaviour tests. Fig. 8a–d shows the infrared thermal images of the fiber supercapacitor at different low temperatures. The CV curves and GCD curves of the fiber supercapacitor have good shape retention in the temperature range of 20 to −40 °C (Fig. 8e and f). For the supercapacitors with general aqueous electrolytes, their capacitances usually drop to below 60% at 0 °C due to the high freezing point of the electrolytes.49,69,70 In this work, the capacitance retention of fiber supercapacitor can reach 95.7% at 0 °C (108.2 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1), and 70.5% even at an ultralow temperature of −40 °C (80 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1). The fiber supercapacitor exhibits satisfactory low-temperature resistance, superior to recently reported all-solid-state supercapacitors assembled with anti-freezing electrolytes (Fig. 8g), such as PVA hydrogel consisting of LiCl, glycerol, montmorillonite, or carboxymethyl cellulose,71–73 zwitterionic hydrogel with anionic and cationic counterions on the polymer chains (e.g., random copolymerization of zwitterionic monomer and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate),74 and ionic liquid or ionogel (e.g., 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrauoroborate).75,76

(i) CV curves at 10 mV s−1 and (j) GCD curves at 1 A g−1 of the supercapacitor after 100 bending cycles at different angles (0–180°) at −40 °C. 
As shown in Fig. 8h, the fiber supercapacitor based on D-MGP3 electrodes and anti-freezing EMIES/PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolytes remains transparent and bendable at −40 °C. The CV and GCD curves of the fiber supercapacitor after 100 bending cycles at different angles at −40 °C show negligible changes, indicating the high flexibility and stability at extreme-low temperatures, which are essential for wearable electronics (Fig. 8i and j).
4 Conclusions
To create the shortest ion diffusion pathways and hence increase the kinetics of the surface electrochemical reactions, for the first time, we have constructed numerous radially oriented channels in the MXene/RGO/PEDOT:PSS hybrid fiber electrodes by a hydrothermal assembly followed by radial-freezing and freeze-drying for enhancing the electrochemical performances of the flexible fiber supercapacitors at ultralow temperatures. The optimized radially oriented channels of the fibers effectively increase the ion accessibility significantly and provide sufficient fast ion transport pathways, which is conducive to the reaction of ions in the electrolyte with massive exposed active sites on the surface of the fiber electrodes, promoting the electrochemical reaction kinetics efficiently, and thus increasing the electrochemical performance of the fiber supercapacitors significantly. The optimal D-MGP3 electrode exhibits a competitive specific capacitance of 475 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and a high capacitance retention of 77% (366 F g−1) at 1000 mV s−1. Benefiting from the high capacitance fiber electrodes and the anti-freezing gel electrolyte, the assembled fiber supercapacitor delivers a high energy density of 10.11 W h kg−1 at 80 W kg−1, a large power density of 1600 W kg−1 with good cycling stability, and high cold resistance with 95.7% capacitance maintaining at 0 °C and even 70.5% capacitance retention at the extremely low temperature of −40 °C, pioneering the first utilization of MXene fiber supercapacitors in ultra-cold environments. In particular, a day–night cycle self-powered system was designed by integrating a solar panel and the series-connected fiber supercapacitors for developing sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. This work reports a novel strategy of constructing radially oriented channels in fiber electrodes for high-performance fiber supercapacitors at ultralow temperatures.
