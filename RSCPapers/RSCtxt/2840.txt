    , Accepted 16th September 2021First published on 16th September 2021AbstractTwo-dimensional graphene-based nanocomposites have gained much attention due to their promising applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. We report the fabrication of c-axis-oriented ZnO nanorods (ZnO (NR)) and a ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure on a glass substrate via chemical bath deposition and hydrothermal approaches. The structural, morphological, and optical characteristics of the synthesized nanostructures have been studied in depth via XRD, FE-SEM, AFM, Raman, UV-vis spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy analysis. The homogeneous core–shell distribution was revealed via SEM and UV-vis spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of rGO within the pores of the ZnO (NR) array. The electrical properties of ZnO (NR) with {0001} facets and ZnO (NR) coated with rGO studied under different illumination conditions clearly suggest the huge potential of the core–shell geometry for UV-photodetector applications. Further, improvements in the degradation and stability properties of the ZnO (NR) and rGO composite were analyzed. UV excitation of the core–shell device may induce energetic electrons to jump from the ZnO surface to the rGO layer, thereby increasing the photocurrent. These results indicate that the incorporation of rGO into a ZnO matrix with core–shell geometry has great promise for other optoelectronic applications, including photovoltaics.
1. Introduction
The wide-bandgap semiconductor zinc oxide (ZnO) is a promising material for the development of nanoscale optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diode, photodetectors, thin-film transistors, solar cells, and photovoltaic cells. Among these applications, UV photodetectors based on ZnO nanostructures have gained much attention because of their interesting optical and electronic properties. Basically, ZnO has the strong tendency to form several morphologies with self-organized growth.1–3 Hence the controlled synthesis of various one-dimensional (1D) ZnO nanostructures, like nanorods, nanowires, and nanocables, plays a key role in UV photodetector performance, as these structures possess high surface-to-volume ratios, high optical gain, fast responses, and specific crystalline orientations.4 Amongst these, zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO (NR)) have emerged as promising building blocks for many applications, and they can be fabricated using several methods, including thermal oxidation,5 chemical vapor deposition,6 and chemical bath deposition.7 Of all the preparation techniques, chemical bath deposition is highly suitable because of its simple experimental set-up, cost effectiveness, and environmental friendliness.8,9
In addition, recent research into the oxidized form of graphene with a two-dimensional (2D) structure has received much interest, with a variety of applications.10–12 Derivatives of graphene, such as graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide, have excellent electrical and mechanical properties, high chemical stability, high thermal conductivity, and large specific areas.13 Due to their impressive properties, these 2D derivatives are popular for applications in areas such as batteries,14 supercapacitors,15 sensors,16 optoelectronic devices,17 and so on. A variety of methods has been established and reported for the synthesis of oxidized forms of graphene. The most widely used methods are the modified Hummers’ method,18 the Staudenmaier method,19 the Brodie method,20 chemical vapor deposition,21 mechanical exfoliation,22 e-beam evaporation,23etc. Above all, the modified Hummers’ method has been most widely used for the synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) because the prepared GO and rGO show equivalent conductivity to samples prepared via other methods, while large scale production is possible and no toxic gases are emitted during synthesis. Basically, graphene oxide is a thin carbon sheet layer decorated with hydroxyl, carboxyl, epoxy, and carbonyl groups, while reduced graphene oxide is obtained via reducing graphene oxide.24–26
Nowadays, the coupling of semiconducting oxide nanostructures with 2D structured carbon materials is an interesting prospect because of the tunable properties.27–29 In particular, ZnO (1D)–rGO (2D) hybrids have been widely studied, since the drawbacks of ZnO nanostructures can be overcome through combining with rGO, and the layer stacking of rGO can be overcome via combining with semiconductors like ZnO. Many reports have been written on the fabrication and applications of ZnO–rGO hybrids. Based on these, it is worth considering that Jana et al. successfully synthesized a ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure in powder form using a microwave-assisted technique.24 Several papers have reported the synthesis of core–shell structures in bulk form, while no reports were found on the synthesis of core–shell structures in thin-film form. The growth of nanocomposites of ZnO nanorods with carbon-based materials has been extensively studied, as rGO assists the charge transfer properties of metal oxides, improving the optoelectronic properties, storage properties, and photocatalytic abilities.26
Herein, we report the synthesis of c-axis-oriented ZnO (NR) and, for the first time, the fabrication of a ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure on a glass substrate. Our objective was to maximize the energy efficiency and simplicity of the reaction process. The hybrid structure was synthesized via a 3-step process, which includes seed layer preparation via spin coating, the formation of nanorods via chemical bath deposition, and, finally, core–shell formation using a hydrothermal technique. From studies, it can be said that all three steps included in the process are easy and cost-effective compared to other techniques. The synthesis route leads to the successful and uniform growth of ZnO (NR) and a ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure. The UV photodetector properties of synthesized samples were correlated with their morphological and structural properties.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Zinc acetate dehydrate (99%, OTTO), hexamine (AR grade, HPLC), 2-methoxyethanol (AR grade, HPLC), monoethanolamine (AR grade, HPLC), and de-ionized water were used as the starting materials for the synthesis of the zinc oxide nanorods. For the synthesis of graphene oxide, graphite powder with a particle size of 50 μm (99.5%, CDH), sodium nitrate (99.5%, HPLC), H2SO4 (97%, Ar grade, HPLC), potassium permanganate (AR grade), hydrogen peroxide (30%, ACS), hydrochloric acid (35%, ACS), and distilled water were used.
2.2 Synthesis of graphene oxide (GO)
Graphene oxide was synthesized via the modified Hummers’ method. Briefly, graphite powder (2 g) and sodium nitrate (2 g) were added to 90 ml of concentrated H2SO4 under continuous stirring for 4 h in an ice bath. Under vigorous stirring, KMnO4 (12 g) was slowly added to the suspension and the temperature of the reaction was maintained below 20 °C. After 2 h of stirring, the suspension was diluted with distilled water (190 ml). Then, the ice bath was removed, and the suspension was stirred for 2 h at 35 °C. Later, the suspension was treated with H2O2, and the solution color changed from brown to yellow. Finally, the suspension was filtered with Whatman paper and washed using centrifugation with 10% HCl and deionized water several times until the pH became neutral. The resultant solid graphene oxide was dried in a hot air oven at 70 °C for 24 h.
2.3 Growth of zinc oxide nanorods
In the first step, seed layer solution was prepared via a sol–gel technique. Typically, 0.2 M zinc acetate dehydrate was dissolved in a mixed solution of 2-methoxyethanol and monoethanolamine at a molar ratio of 1:1. The seed solution was stirred magnetically at 60 °C for 1 h and kept for 24 h for aging. The resultant solution was spin-coated onto an RCA-cleaned glass substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. After processing, the film was annealed at 180 °C for 10 min to remove the organic materials. The coating procedure was repeated 10 times to ensure uniform thickness and coverage of the ZnO seed material. The prepared film was finally annealed at 450 °C for 1.5 h.
In the second step, ZnO nanorods (ZnO (NR)) were grown on the seeded glass substrate via the chemical bath deposition method. 25 mM zinc acetate dehydrate (as a precursor), 25 mM hexamine (HMTA) (as a stabilizer), and 200 ml of deionized water (as a solvent) were blended together using a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm for 1 h at 45 °C. Then, seeded substrates were submerged vertically in the solution and stirred at 400 rpm for 3 h at 95 °C. After this process, the submerged substrates were removed from the solution, rinsed with deionized water, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h.
2.4 Synthesis of the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure
Here a simple hydrothermal technique was used for the synthesis of the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure. Firstly, 20 mg of graphene oxide was dispersed in 40 ml of deionized water through sonication for 1 h, with stirring continued for 30 min. The prepared solution was then transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, with the nanorod-grown substrates submerged in the solution horizontally. Then, the autoclave was placed in a furnace and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. After this process, the submerged substrate was rinsed with deionized water and dried at 70 °C for 12 h.
2.5 Characterization
Structural information about the prepared films was obtained using an X-ray diffractometer with parallel beam geometry (Rigaku Smartlab) and a 3 kW sealed X-ray tube producing Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 1.5406 Å. The surface morphologies of the grown nanorods and ZnO (NR)–rGO nanostructure were analyzed using field emission scanning electronic microscopy (FESEM). Topographies of films were studied using tapping mode (Tap 190Al-G) atomic force microscopy (Easyscan 2, Nanosurf) at room temperature. Raman data were recorded at room temperature using a Raman spectrometer with a Nd-YAG laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and energy of 50 mW (Renishaw UK). Optical energy bandgaps were estimated via UV-vis spectroscopy (UV-2600, Shimadzu Co.) using transmittance geometry with a thin-film attachment set up. Room temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy was carried out using a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer (Model fluorescence-55) with a varying slit width (excitation slit = 10 nm; emission slit = 5 nm). A pulsed xenon lamp was used as a source of excitation for model LS 55 series apparatus. Photoresponse measurements were carried out using the two-probe method with a source meter unit (Keithley 2614 B) under ambient, dark, and illuminated conditions. A black-box set-up was used, in which samples were secured and connected using source meter probes. For illumination, a UV source with a wavelength of 254 nm, power of 8 W, and a power intensity of 3.5 mW cm−2 was employed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphological study

Fig. 1 shows microstructural images of synthesized samples obtained using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The images were recorded without disturbing the original nature of the samples at room temperature. In-plane and cross-view images of ZnO nanorods grown on the ZnO-seeded glass substrate are presented in Fig. 1a and b. The surface of the ZnO-seeded glass substrate is well-coated with quasi-oriented ZnO (NR) arrays with a uniform hexagonal shape. The well-aligned vertical growth of the nanorods reveals the more-rapid growth of the (0001) facet compared to the other facets, exhibiting a polar Zn-terminated (0001) top and O-terminated (0001) bottom surface, which is bound with six crystallographic non-polar [010] planes. Thus, the growth structure of ZnO (NR) shows the most stable crystalline structure with a hexagonal shape grown along the c-axis.30 The core–shell structure between ZnO (NR) and rGO is clearly visible in Fig. 1c and d. The ZnO nanorods are well coated with rGO, suggesting strong association between the two materials. The formation of a core–shell structure between ZnO (NR) and rGO suggests that interfacial contact between the materials occurs via an electrostatic self-assembly approach.30 No difference in the size of the nanorods is observed upon coating with rGO. Basically, the charge-transfer mechanism of photogenerated charge carriers in the rGO–semiconductor composite is related to the interfacial interactions between rGO and the semiconducting material. Thus, it is possible that such interfacial contact would support the charge-transfer process, enhancing the photoresponse performance. The surface topographies of ZnO (NR) and ZnO (NR)–rGO films were studied using atomic force microscopy. Scanning was carried out in a 1 μm × 1 μm area. Fig. 2 shows 2D images of prepared samples along with histograms. Samples have smooth and crack-free surfaces. It can be clearly seen from the top image in Fig. 2 that the nanorods have a hexagonal structure, which is in agreement with the SEM analysis. The average surface roughness values of ZnO (NR) and ZnO (NR)–rGO were calculated to be 38.15 nm and 41.33 nm, respectively.31

3.2 Structural characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns of vertically grown ZnO (NR) obtained via the chemical bath deposition method and ZnO (NR) coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) obtained via the hydrothermal method are shown in Fig. 3. The diffraction patterns of all samples grown on glass substrates show a major (002) peak at around 34°, indicating a hexagonal wurtzite structure, which is in agreement with JCPDF 36-1451. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the XRD pattern of ZnO (NR) exhibits a strong (002) peak, suggestive of c-axis-oriented growth and a high-crystalline quality nanorod array. The SEM micrographs displayed in Fig. 1 and the c-axis-oriented growth revealed by the XRD patterns (Fig. 3) agree well with each other.32–34
 Fig. 3  The XRD patterns of the ZnO seed material, ZnO (NR), and ZnO (NR)–rGO. 
The (001) orientation of the rod structure of the ZnO seed thin film is attributed to the polar surface nature of ZnO. When the surface of ZnO is positively or negatively charged, the polar surface will try to obtain oppositely charged ions (i.e., OH− or Zn2+). The newly formed surface will again attract other positively or negatively charged ions to cover the surface, and the process repeats, forming and growing layers and leading to the (001) c-axis orientation.35 On the other hand, reduced graphene oxide shows a broad diffraction peak over a wide 2θ range (centered at 2θ = 25°), which originates from the (002) plane. A similar diffraction peak is observed at 2θ = 25° in the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell sample. Compared to the other crystalline peaks, the intensity of the rGO peak is found to be quite low, which may be due to the low concentration of weakly scattering graphene oxide (GO) used in the synthesis. The broad peak shows the successful reduction of GO to rGO, indicating the loss of long-range interactions between stacked carbon layers.36 No other diffraction peaks were present in either pattern, suggesting the successful fabrication of pure ZnO nanorods and the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure.
3.3 Compositional analysis
Raman spectroscopy is a very sensitive method used to identify the phase purity of a complex structure.37 Room-temperature Raman spectroscopy was carried out in the range from 100 cm−1 to 2000 cm−1 to characterize the level of disorder and defects, especially in the core–shell structure. Fig. 4 depicts the Raman spectra of synthesized samples excited with a 532 nm Nd-YAG laser at room temperature. The Raman spectra of the ZnO seed material and ZnO (NR) exhibit four prominent peaks at 215, 434, 652, and 1175 cm−1. The modes at 210, 652, and 1175 cm−1 are assigned to the second order acoustic mode (2TA), acoustic overtones, and a longitudinal optical multi-phonon peak. Further the peak at 434 cm−1 corresponds to the E2 (high) frequency mode, corresponding to the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO. The incorporation of rGO lowered the intensities of the ZnO peaks. However the presence of the peak at 434 cm−1 confirms the formation of the ZnO(NR)/rGO core–shell structure.38,39 The two prominent peaks at 1328 cm−1 and 1595 cm−1 observed in the core–shell sample (Fig. 4) correspond to the D and G bands of reduced graphene oxide, respectively. The D peak corresponds to defects created by oxygen functional groups on the carbon basal panel and the G peak corresponds to the first-order scattering of the E2g mode.40 Furthermore, the intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) was calculated to study the degree of disorder. The ratio was found to be 0.83, which revealed a decrease in the number of defects induced by oxygen functional groups. The presence of D and G bands in the hybrid core–shell sample reveals that the coating of rGO over ZnO was successfully carried out.41

3.4 Optical properties
Optical transmittance spectra of all synthesized films were recorded using UV-vis spectroscopy, as displayed in Fig. 5. The zinc oxide seed layer film revealed above 80% transmittance in the visible range, i.e., from 390 nm to 700 nm, while the nanorod-grown film showed a sharp fall from 68% to 10% in the visible range. Similarly, a decrease in transmittance is observed for the rGO-coated sample from 41% to 2%. The transmittance of the core–shell film showed the lowest value, which is due to the coverage of rGO on the nanorods, as can be seen in FESEM imaging (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 5  (a) UV-vis spectra and (b) Tauc plots (inset: Tauc plot of the ZnO seed layer) of the materials in this study. 
The optical bandgaps of the synthesized films were calculated using the equation αhν = A(hν − Eg)½, where α is the absorption coefficient, hν is the energy of a photon, A is a constant, and Eg is the bandgap of the sample.42 The calculated bandgaps of the ZnO seed layer, nanorods grown on the seed layer, and the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure are 3.9, 3.2, and 3.05 eV, respectively. Fig. 5(b) shows Tauc plots, where the bandgap is calculated based on the extrapolation of the linear portion of the plot. The results indicate a decrease in the bandgap upon the incorporation of rGO, which is due to photogenerated electrons jumping from ZnO to rGO.43
Photoluminescence analysis is used to study the internal structure of the ZnO (NR)–rGO core shell material. Basically, photoluminescence is produced by the recombination of electrons and holes. Room-temperature photoluminescence spectra of the ZnO seed layer, ZnO (NR), and ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure excited using a 325 nm laser are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen from the figure that the synthesized samples reveal two main features in the UV range (350–390 nm) and the visible range (400–700 nm). The narrow UV emission band is attributed to the excitonic-related recombination of electron–hole pairs, and the visible range emission is attributed to intrinsic defects, such as Zn interstitials, oxygen vacancies, oxygen interstitials, and oxygen antisites. Compared to the ZnO seed layer, the UV emission intensity of ZnO (NR) is high, which is due to ZnO (NR) grown on seed layer having lots of structural defects, such as grain boundaries and oxygen vacancies. It is well known that the luminescence efficiency of a ZnO nanostructure is deeply affected by the defect states and surface defects, which act as electron trap centers.8,44 On the other hand, a recent study of rGO revealed blue luminescence at ∼425 nm due to electron–hole recombination from a large amount of localized sp2 carbon embedded within the sp3 matrix. The enhanced defect emission intensity in the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell material compared to bare ZnO (NR) is due to the presence of rGO covering ZnO (NR), as seen in the FESEM images. Essentially, in the presence of rGO, electrons move from the conduction band of ZnO to the Fermi level of rGO (−4.6 eV). These highly mobile electrons then move to the defect level of ZnO, resulting in a decrease in electron–hole recombination. Thus, the density of electrons populating the ZnO defect states in the hybrid increases and so the intensity decreases. Thus, the incorporation of rGO covering the ZnO nanorods significantly modifies the emission characteristics of ZnO.45

3.5 Electrical properties
The optoelectronic properties of the synthesized core–shell hybrid structure were studied based on the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics at room temperature. For photoresponse measurements, a continuous voltage sweep of −5 V → 0 V → +5 V with a 0.1 V step-size was applied, and the currents were measured using two-wire geometry with a source meter unit (SMU Model 2614 B, Keithley).46 The data were collected with identical geometry under ambient light, dark, and UV illumination conditions, and the results are displayed in Fig. 7. It is observed from Fig. 7 that the I–V curves are linear and symmetric, indicating Ohmic contact between the hybrid structure and the silver electrodes. Under ambient and dark conditions, not much difference was noticed; to the contrary, under UV illumination all samples showed increases in the current values of nearly 2 to 3 orders of magnitude (Fig. 7). Further, the addition of rGO on and within the pores of the ZnO (NR) array resulted in a decrease in the photocurrent. This may be due to the coverage of rGO over the photosensitive ZnO (NR) facets, leading to a decrease in exposed ZnO and the prevention of light reaching the active area.47,48 These results suggest that the rGO-ZnO (NR) core–shell structure is highly sensitive to UV light.

The current level increases under UV illumination for all samples, which confirms the photogeneration of free carriers in the films. In the case of the ZnO seed layer and ZnO (NR) grown on the seed layer, the increase in current may be due to atmospheric molecules, such as O2 and H2O, that are absorbed on the surface of the film after exposure to air. These absorbed molecules behave like electron trapping surfaces and reduce the electron density of ZnO, and UV illumination causes the desorption of these absorbed molecules, i.e., electrons are released back into the conduction band, resulting in an increase in the current value. On the other hand, in the case of the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure under UV illumination, electrons transit from the valence band of ZnO to the defect level and create electron–hole pairs at the surface. As the voltage sweep was applied, photogenerated electron–hole pairs easily dissociate at the interface of ZnO (NR) - rGO and are collected through the electrodes without penetrating any barrier, which leads to the increase in the current value.49
The typical transient photoresponse characteristics of the fabricated films in the presence and absence of UV light under biases of 0.5 V and 1 V are shown in Fig. 8(i) and (ii). Both ZnO (NR) and the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure showed a prominent photoresponse under UV light illumination. To study the transient photoresponse, the films were illuminated under a UV light source for 30 s, during which the current was found to increase; next, after a 30 s delay, the source was switched off, and the current was found to decrease, as shown in Fig. 8. With repeated cycles of UV exposure with a duration of 30 s each, the current exhibited switching behavior. However, the current increase in response to “UV On” conditions and the current decrease in response to “UV Off” conditions did not reach saturation or fall back to the original value, respectively. Upon switching off the light source, the current decreases but does not drop to the initial value, which reveals detector behavior with persistent photoconductivity. Similar increase and decrease patterns were noticed in response to UV light exposure with on and off states with a duration of 300 s under biases of 0.5 V and 1 V, as shown in Fig. 9.50 The ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure showed a slower photoresponse compared to the ZnO nanorods, which is due to the high concentration of rGO on ZnO (NR), which results in faster carrier separation.51 However, the addition of rGO decreases the degradation and increases the stability of the device. The transient response of the material can be explained via the carrier transport mechanism shown in Fig. 10. Basically, under dark conditions, oxygen molecules from the atmosphere are absorbed on the ZnO layer. This adsorbed oxygen has the tendency to react with free electrons from the conduction band of ZnO and form negatively charged oxygen molecules. When the film is illuminated under UV light, electron–hole pairs are generated, which are pushed by the applied electric field in the same direction. The photogenerated carriers neutralize the absorbed oxygen on the surface of ZnO, leading to photo-desorption. The width of the depletion region decreases during photo-desorption, which results in an increase in free carriers and electrical conductivity. Under UV illumination, unpaired electrons become accumulated over time and the photocurrent increases. When the light is turned off, electrons and holes recombine rapidly. However, some electrons are unable to recombine, and oxygen molecules adsorb again on the ZnO surface.52

 Fig. 10  A schematic diagram of the charge transport mechanism. 
In order to gain further understanding, the device performance and detection limit of the photodetector are analyzed in terms of sensitivity, responsivity, detectivity, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) under a 1 V bias.53,54 Basically, the sensitivity is the ratio between the photocurrent and the dark current, represented mathematically as: (1)where Iph is the current under the UV light source and Id is the dark current. The responsivity of the detector is defined as the number of photogenerated charge carriers per incident number of photons: (2)where Popt is the optical power. The detectivity is the ability of the photodetector to detect a weak optical signal, i.e., it is a measurement of a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is represented as follows: (3)where A is the effective area of the photodetector, R is the responsivity, and e is the electronic charge.
The number of electron–hole pairs generated per incident photon for a given wavelength of illuminating light is termed the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency or the external quantum efficiency (EQE). The value of EQE can be calculated using the equation: (4)where hc is the photon energy. The calculated values are listed in Table 1.

4. Conclusions
ZnO (NR) and ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell nanostructures were synthesized successfully using simple chemical bath deposition and hydrothermal techniques. The growth of vertically aligned nanorods and ZnO (NR) core–rGO shell structure formation were confirmed via field emission scanning electron microscopy. The surface topologies, smoothness, and monodispersed grain distributions of the samples were revealed using atomic force microscopy. The crystallinity and structures of ZnO (NR) and the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure were studied using X-ray diffraction. The phase purity and defect bands of GO and rGO were analyzed via Raman spectroscopy, which showed a pure rGO phase, reduced from graphene oxide, and a wurtzite ZnO phase. The optical bandgap of ZnO (NR) was found to be 3.2 eV with high transmittance in the visible range. Upon coating the rGO shell onto ZnO (NR), the band gap was found to decrease to 3.05 eV with reduced transmittance. The enhanced UV emission and suppressed visible emission of the material related to interfacial charge transfer from Zn trapping centers was confirmed via PL spectroscopy. The I–V characteristics under different photon illumination conditions exhibited Ohmic conduction, with enhanced photocurrent (compared with ambient and dark conditions) and better device stability upon UV exposure being shown by the core–shell device. The dynamic photoresponse of the core–shell structure showed interesting and reproducible switching characteristics under UV illumination conditions. These results are direct evidence of the potential UV photodetector applications of the novel ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell nanohybrid structure. Our findings relating to chemically synthesized ZnO (NR) and the ZnO (NR)–rGO core–shell structure open up several promising applications, such as use in energy-harvesting devices (like solar cells), photodetectors, sensors, and photocatalysis, with improved performance.
