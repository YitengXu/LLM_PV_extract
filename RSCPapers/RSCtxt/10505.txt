    , Accepted 17th January 2019First published on 17th January 2019AbstractThermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted significant attention owing to their state-of-the-art performance in the field of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). TADF materials have the capability of harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons through reverse intersystem crossing, thus, the maximum internal quantum efficiency can be expected to be 100%. Thanks to TADF materials that are developed from pure organic entities so that they are inexpensive and external quantum efficiencies as high as 38% have been achieved to date. Despite the high performance of doped OLEDs, precise control of the host–guest ratio and phase separation at high driving voltages are the foremost challenges. In order to circumvent these demerits, the use of numerous small molecules, dendritic molecules, and polymers as non-doped emitters has been reported. Non-doped OLEDs consist of only a single molecule emitter in the emissive layer, thus simplifying the device fabrication process. Furthermore, non-doped OLEDs exhibit better device stability compared to doped devices, because the former do not exhibit phase separation or crystallinity and maintain a homogeneous surface film morphology during device operation. As a result, non-doped OLEDs are capable of overcoming the most pivotal issues of device complexity and stability, which makes them effective in rendering OLEDs commercially viable. Although maximum external quantum efficiencies of nearly 23.0% in blue, 22.0% in green, 22.0% in yellow, 17.0% in orange, and 10.0% in red emitting materials have been realized with non-doped OLEDs, still further progress is essential to reach the doped devices. This review systematically describes the molecular design, photophysical properties, and electroluminescence performance data of non-doped TADF emitters. We strongly believe that this review will be beneficial in terms of presenting a specific direction for the design of a variety of non-doped TADF emitters in the near future.

1. Introduction
Organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology has attracted immense attention in both academia and industry in the last three decades after the innovative report of Tang and Van Slyke in 1987.1 Particular advantages of OLEDs, such as low-cost, light weight, low driving-voltage, and fast response, have facilitated their implementation in numerous day-to-day applications like display technology, solid-state lighting, mobile phones, smart watches, and so on.2 The conversion of electricity to light takes place in OLEDs (which is the opposite phenomenon of what is observed in solar cells, where light is converted to electricity) through recombination of electrically generated hole and electron pairs, known as excitons. In this regard, hole-transport, electron-transport, and emissive layers have been sandwiched between the anode and the cathode. Electrons and holes are injected from the cathode and the anode, respectively, into the emissive layer through the charge-transport layers. The injected holes and electrons then recombine with each other in the emissive layer to produce singlet and triplet excitons in a 1:3 ratio, in accordance with the spin–statistics rule.3 In essence, only the singlet excitons of organic molecules can emit radiatively, while the majority of the triplet excitons deplete their energies non-radiatively in the form of heat. Therefore, fluorescent OLEDs are limited to an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of only 25% resulting in only a 5.0% external quantum efficiency (EQE), which is the key disadvantage. Therefore, researchers have concerned themselves with utilization of the remaining 75% triplet excitons in the form of radiative decay, which is the ultimate solution to surpass the poor device performance. In 1998, for the first-time, Baldo et al. demonstrated a platinum-based complex as a phosphorescent emitter that utilizes both singlet and triplet excitons attributed to strong spin–orbit coupling.4 Although this emitter realized only a 4.0% EQE, much effort has been devoted subsequently to developing a variety of rare earth metal, such as osmium, iridium and platinum, complex emitters, which have created a benchmark in terms of their high performances in OLED applications. Despite their high performance, the limited availability, cost-ineffective nature, and toxicity of rare earth metals are inadequate for their widespread applications. Organic entities are rather cheaper and easier to functionalize for the development of diverse materials. Therefore, by utilizing organic entities, several strategies such as triplet–triplet annihilation,5,6 hybridized local and charge transfer excitation,7,8 and triplet–polar annihilation (TPA)9 have been proposed to utilize the triplet excitons, however, each strategy can be controverted.
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has attracted much attention and tremendous success in the field of OLEDs, with the first breakthrough in the form of a >20% EQE achieved by utilizing pure organic entities, being reported by Adachi et al.10 Although TADF is a known phenomenon, its relevance in OLED applications was not revealed until Adachi's report. To date, TADF materials have realized EQEs of up to 38.0%,11,12 which demonstrate their great potential in OLED applications. TADF materials are capable of harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons through reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) resulting in 100% IQE, theoretically. To upconvert the lowest triplet (T1) excitons into the lowest singlet-state (S1), the energy gap (ΔEST) between the S1 and T1 states should be as small as possible (preferably <0.1 eV). Therefore, RISC and ΔEST oppose each other. A small ΔEST facilitates the RISC of non-radiative triplet-excitons from T1 to S1 to emit radiatively through the transition from the S1 to the S0 state. As a result, two kinds of fluorescence with discrete lifetimes can be expected, prompt fluorescence (τPF) and delayed fluorescence (τDF). The prompt fluorescence emission originates from the radiative emission of the singlet excitons directly generated with τPF on the order of nanoseconds, while the delayed fluorescence emission results from the radiative decay of the transformed singlet excitons from the triplet excited state, where τDF is in the range of micro to milliseconds.
Donor–acceptor (D–A) structures with twisted geometries are predominantly adopted to develop TADF materials. The twisted geometry can render the spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO distributions and results in a small ΔEST.13 Thus, as the dihedral angle between the D and A entities increases, ΔEST decreases. Another important parameter of TADF emitters is the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), which is a resultant of the overlap between the HOMO and the LUMO. Thus, ΔEST and PLQY are contradictory to each other from the perspective of overlapping of the HOMO and the LUMO. Hence, the connectivity of the D and A entities through a particular overlap between the HOMO and the LUMO is quite essential to realizing both small ΔEST and high PLQYs. Apart from this, a shorter τDF could be essential to reducing the number of triplet-excitons and self-quenching.14,15 Besides, balanced charge injection and transportation and suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels must be considered while designing TADF emitters. TADF materials are sensitive towards oxygen and temperature, which can further promote their applications as optical sensors for detecting oxygen and temperature levels.
With regard to device fabrication, vacuum thermal evaporation and solution processing are the most commonly used techniques. Undoubtedly, thermally evaporated devices exhibit high performance because they can form uniform and smooth films, however, this technique is quite expensive and hard to perform.11,12 Consequently, the fabrication of devices by using solution processes such as spin coating, screen printing, or ink-jet printing holds great promise for the mass production of OLEDs because of their advantages that include low-cost, easy fabrication, and large area applicability.16,17 However, it should be considered that the performance of solution-processed devices is still inferior to that of vacuum-processed devices. Although significant progress has been made in solution-processable OLEDs, more efforts are still needed to realize high-performing devices.
From the perspective of the emissive layer, most of the high-performing TADF emitters are apparently doped into an appropriate host matrix to reduce the energy loss due to triplet–triplet annihilation or concentration quenching. Typically, the host materials dominate (up to 99%) the dopant emitters and play a major role, therefore, the selection of the host material is an additional concern.18–20 Precise control of the host to guest ratio is very important to obtain high device performance, though it is very difficult. Moreover, the host–guest blend system induces phase separation and crystallinity, which can hamper the overall device performance. Considering these problems, it is highly desirable to develop OLEDs consisting of non-doped emissive layers. Much research has been carried out and reported on the use of numerous small molecules, dendrimers, and polymers as non-doped emitters in OLEDs.21–29 Certain reported non-doped emitters exhibit the additional photophysical property of aggregation-induced emission (AIE).30–32 In principle, AIE luminogens show low PLQYs in dilute solutions and high PLQYs in the aggregated state because in dilute solutions molecules retain fast intramolecular rotational and vibrational motions leading to fast nonradiative decay. However, those motions are greatly suppressed in the aggregated state and thus restrict fast nonradiative decay, resulting in improved PLQYs. In addition, AIE luminogens possess a twisted molecular geometry and thus they can weaken intermolecular π–π interactions in the aggregated state, which is favored to alleviate aggregation caused quenching and exciton annihilation. The PL spectra of AIE luminogens are blue-shifted in the aggregated state, due to the rigidification of the molecular structure, which can lower the reorganization energy in the aggregated state. The AIE behavior could be confirmed by recording the PL spectra in a tetrahydrofuran (THF):water mixture. The THF:water mixture is a much preferred solvent system since many organic molecules are highly soluble in THF and very poorly soluble in water. Emitters that simultaneously display TADF and AIE properties are particularly beneficial to realize high performance in nondoped systems and small efficiency roll-off, which is observed at high brightness.
This review deals with the emissive layers of OLEDs consisting of only a single component, without the aid of a host. This review has been classified into small molecules (Section 2), dendritic molecules (Section 3), and polymers (Section 4). All dendrimers and polymers were fabricated through solution processes, while the small molecules were fabricated by both solution and vacuum thermal evaporation processes. Hence, the small molecules section has been subdivided into solution processed (Section 2a) and vacuum thermally evaporated (Section 2b) non-doped OLEDs. The device structure and a comparison of non-doped OLEDs verses doped OLEDs are presented in Fig. 1. The relevant data of Section 2, 3 and 4 have been summarized in Tables 1–3, respectively.

2. Small molecules
Herein, small molecules are considered those having molecular weights less than 1000. Based on the device fabrication technique, this section has been classified into emissive layers prepared by solution processing (Section 2a) and through the vacuum process (Section 2b).
2a. Solution processing
Solution-processable devices have greater potential than vacuum-processed OLEDs because of their easy fabrication, inexpensive nature, and large area applicability. However, the fabrication of small molecules using solution processes is rather difficult because of their marginal solubility in common organic solvents. Therefore, the current state-of-the-art devices are constructed through the vacuum thermal process with multilayer configurations. As a result, there is an urgent demand for developing solution-processable non-doped TADF emitters to make the device fabrication process much easier.
Lu et al. developed two D–A type ortho-linked blue emitters containing triarylboron as the acceptor and carbazole (B-oCz) or 3,6-di-tert-butylcarbazole as the donor (B-oTC) (Scheme 1).21 Substantial intramolecular D–A interactions in both the emitters concurrently empowered charge transfer (CT) through the aryl linker as well as through space. The fluorescence spectra of these emitters show a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 56–60 nm, which is due to the large steric hindrance and strong intramolecular interactions. The narrow FWHM is particularly advantageous for realizing high-color-purity emission. DFT studies revealed a large dihedral angle between the ortho-substituted carbazole donor and the connecting aryl ring of the triarylboron moiety that was 85.68° for B-oCz and 83.38° for B-oTC. The large dihedral angle allowed for well separated HOMO and LUMO distributions and small ΔEST. Hence, the resulting ΔEST values were very small: 0.06 eV and 0.05 eV for B-oCz and B-oTC, respectively, ascertained in the neat film state. The PLQYs were observed to be 61% and 94% for B-oCz and B-oTC, respectively. Consequently, non-doped OLEDs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TFB/B-oCz or B-oTC/DPEPO/TyPMPB/LiF/Al. B-oTC as a non-doped emitter device displayed a higher performance, with a maximum EQE of 19.1% (CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.26) and EL at 474 nm), which is one of the best among solution-processable blue OLEDs, whereas, B-oCz exhibited only a 8.0% EQE (CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.17) and EL at 463 nm). All the important device characteristics are presented in Fig. 2. The best performance of B-oTC could be attributed to the presence of tertiary butyl groups on carbazole, which can inhibit intermolecular π–π stacking and thus promote the overall device performance.

5CzCN is a well-known blue TADF emitter that consists of cyano (CN) as the electron-acceptor and five carbazoles as the electron-donors, as reported by Lee et al. (Scheme 1).33 However, Tao's group replaced the CN of 5CzCN with a benzoyl group to obtain a new green-TADF emitter called 5CzBP. Although 5CzBP has a small ΔEST of only 0.01 eV, its PLQY was found to be very small, being only 8% in toluene solution and 24% in the film state. Subsequently, 5CzBP as a non-doped emitter showed only a 5.7% EQE, which slightly improved to 8.9% in a 1,3-bis(carbazol-9-yl)benzene (mCP)-hosted device. Moreover, the authors also implemented it as a host by selecting the known green-TADF emitter 2,3,5,6-tetracarbazole-4-cyano-pyridine (4CzCNPy), and the corresponding device revealed a maximum EQE of 12.7%. We believe that the poor performance of this keto derivative (5CzBP) compared to the corresponding cyano derivative (5CzCN) is attributed to the loss of triplet excitons through non-radiative decay instead of being converted into the singlet excited state through RISC.
2b. Thermal evaporation
Vacuum thermal evaporation is a familiar technique used to deposit thermally robust materials. Thermally evaporated films produce a smooth and uniform film morphology, which is one of the main parameters to achieve high device performance. This technique is particularly beneficial for the deposition of organic molecules having molecular weight less than 1000 (the preferred molecular weight is between 600 and 800).
Adachi et al. demonstrated two TADF small molecules, namely 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (DMAC) diphenyl sulfone (DPS) (DMAC-DPS) and bis[4-(9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine)phenyl]methanone (DMAC-BP) as non-doped emitters (Scheme 2).34 DMAC-DPS and DMAC-BP exhibit high PLQYs of 88% and 85%, respectively, in the neat film state. DMAC-DPS shows an ΔEST of only 0.08 eV and a small τDF (7.1 μs) in the doped films (mCP, 10 wt%), while DMAC-BP exhibits a small ΔEST of 0.07 eV and a shorter τDF of 2.7 μs. Because of the high PLQYs, short delayed fluorescence lifetimes, and excellent bipolar charge-transport abilities, DMAC-DPS and DMAC-BP were implemented as non-doped emitters in OLED applications. Single, double, and triple layered OLEDs have been investigated to achieve maximum device performance. Upon optimization, DMAC-DPS with the configuration of ITO/MoO3/mCP/DMAC-DPS/DPEPO/LiF/Al displayed the highest performance with a maximum EQE of 19.5% and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.29), which belong to the blue wavelength region. DMAC-BP as a non-doped emitter in the emissive layer with the configuration of ITO/MoO3/mCP/DMAC-BP/TPBI/LiF/Al exhibited a maximum EQE of 18.9% with CIE coordinates of (0.26, 0.55), corresponding to the green region. In particular, it is worthwhile to mention that the EQE was retained at 14.6% for DMAC-DPS and 18.0% for DMAC-BP at a practical luminance of 1000 cd m−2, which revealed reduced roll-off. The significantly reduced roll-off behavior for DMAC-BP compared to DMAC-DPS can be attributed to the shorter τDF. Moreover, the non-doped film of DMAC-BP showed superior device stability, with a half-life (LT50) of nearly 4 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m−2, compared to the doped device (mCP host, 10 wt%), the LT50 of which was limited to only 0.5 h.

Isobenzofuranone and chromone entities have been introduced as electron acceptors for the first time by Yasuda et al. and used to develop TADF blue emitters, such as MXAc-BF, MXAc-CM, and XAc-CM (Scheme 2).35 The PLQY values of neat films measured under a nitrogen atmosphere follow the decreasing order of MXAc-BF (78%) > MXAc-CM (71%) > XAc-CM (53%). The experimentally calculated ΔEST values of films 50 wt% doped into a bis(diphenylphosphoryl)dibenzo[b,d]furan (PPF) host are as follows: MX-Ac-BF (0.08 eV) = MX-Ac-CM (0.08 eV) < XAc-CM (0.11 eV). The non-doped OLEDs fabricated with the configuration of ITO/HATCN/α-NPD/CCP/EML/PPF/TPBi/Liq/Al exhibit a maximum EQE of ∼8.0% for XAc-CM, ∼16.2% for MXAc-BF, and ∼12.0% for MXAc-CM. The doped OLEDs fabricated by using PPF as the host showed maximum EQEs in the range of 12.1–16.2%. The 50 wt% doped PPF device of XAc-CM showed the highest EQE of 16.2%, with an EL emission peak at the shortest wavelength (462 nm) and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.19), which correspond to the deep-blue light region. On the other hand, the EL peak of MXAc-BF (an EQE of 15.0%) was observed at 478 nm, with the CIE coordinates being (0.17, 0.29); its pattern was very similar to that of the corresponding MXAc-CM devices (an EQEmax of 12.1%). The key device parameters are displayed in Fig. 3.

The same research group developed four new bluish-green emitters bearing xanthone (XT) as the acceptor-core (MCz-XT, PAc-XT, XAc-XT, and FAc-XT) (Scheme 2).36a MCz-XT showed a higher PLQY of 98.1% in the doped film (PPF host, 5 wt%) than in the non-doped film (49.8%). However, the non-planar spiro-acridine as a donor based emitter displayed negligible concentration PL quenching in the range 6.8–15%. For instance, the PLQYs of the non-doped and doped films of PAc-XT were 98.8% and 92.0%, of XAc-XT were 95.0% and 83.5%, and of FAc-XT were 97.0% and 81.5%, respectively. All the emitters revealed rather small ΔEST values, which were in the range 0.011–0.025 eV. The non-doped devices of MCz-XT, PAc-XT, XAc-XT, and FAc-XT displayed maximum EQEs of 5.2%, 11.2%, 14.1%, and 12.6%, respectively. On the other hand, the doped devices (PPF host, 75 wt%) revealed enhanced performances of 16.5%, 18.8%, 17.3%, and 7.6% for PAc-XT, XAc-XT, FAc-XT, and MCz-XT, respectively, owing to the suppressed triplet–triplet and triplet–polaron annihilation in the doped system. The concentration quenching of both PL and EL was constrained effectively for this series of emitters because of the terminal substituents that were appended via the sp3-hybridized carbon atom present in the acridine donor unit.
The same research group demonstrated dibenzohetera-borin as an acceptor for four new blue to green TDAF emitters, MPAc-BS, MPAc-BO, MPAc-BN and MPAc-Dip-BS, exhibiting high efficiency and low roll off along with rather small FWHM (Scheme 2).36b 2,7-Dimethyl-9,9-diphenylacridan (MPAc) was selected as a common D unit. The τDF values were observed to be 1.7, 2.4, 16 and 2.0 μs for MPAc-BS, MPAc-BO, MPAc-BN, and MPAc-Dip-BS, respectively, in the neat film state. The absolute PLQYs of both doped and non-doped films exhibit almost comparable values. For instance, 50 wt% doped films (2,8-bis(diphenylphosphoryl)dibenzo[b,d]furan, PPF as a host) showed a maximum PLQY of 100%, 99%, 75%, and 65%, for MPAc-BS, MPAc-BO, MPAc-BN and MPAc-Dip-BS, respectively, while the neat films realized a maximum PLQY of 99%, 98%, 32%, and 21%, respectively. The shorter τDF of MPAc-BS and MPAc-BO is particularly beneficial to show a similar PLQY in both doped and non-doped films by reducing aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ). Interestingly, thia-bridged MPAc-BS shows an increased kRISC of 3.5 × 106 s−1, which is 3.5-fold higher than the oxa-bridged MPAc-BO and 19-fold higher than that of aza-bridged MPAc-BN. The FWHM of these emitters is in the range of 56–68 nm in the film state. Because of the high PLQY and small ΔEST in doped films, initially the authors implemented all emitters in doped OLEDs using PPF as a host (50 wt%) with the configuration of ITO (50 nm)/HAT-CN (10 nm)/TAPC (50 nm)/CCP (10 nm)/EML (30 nm)/PPF (10 nm)/B3PyPB (40 nm)/Liq (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). The maximum EQEs with CIE coordinates were found to be 25.8% and (0.20, 0.51), 24.9 and (0.16, 0.38), 16.0% and (0.14, 0.23), and 16.4% and (0.19, 0.45) for MPAc-BS, MPAc-BO, MPAc-BN and MPAc-Dip-BS, respectively. The EQE values remained 25.0%/23.7%, 22.8%/14.7%, 7.6%/— and 12.7%/2.3% at 100 and 1000 cd m−2 for MPAc-BS, MPAc-BO, MPAc-BN and MPAc-Dip-BS, respectively. Furthermore, the authors used MPAc-BS and MPAc-BO as non-doped emitters because of their reduced concentration quenching as evidenced by higher kRISC. MPAc-BS and MPAc-BO show a maximum EQE with CIE coordinates of 22.8% and (0.15, 0.36), and 21.3% and (0.14, 0.23), respectively. These values remained 22.6%/19.0% and 18.3%/8.0% at 100 and 1000 cd m−2. The higher performance and extremely low roll-off behavior of MPAc-BS are attributed to the higher PLQY and faster kRISC. It is worthwhile to mention that MPAc-BS exhibits blue-shifted emission in non-doped devices as compared to the doped devices because of the nonpolar environment of MPAc-BS (μ = 1.3 D) compared to the PPF host (μ = 5.8 D). As a result, MPAc-BS is the best TADF emitter, which can give high performance and small roll-off in both doped and non-doped OLEDs. Later, they developed another two AIE-TADF emitters, PTZ-XT and PTZ-BP, by coupling a phenothiazine donor with a xanthone or benzophenone acceptor entity (Scheme 2).36c A dihedral angle of nearly 90° was observed between the donor and acceptor units of both emitters. The high dihedral angle is beneficial for effective electronic decoupling between donor and acceptor units resulting in small ΔEST. The ΔEST was calculated to be 0.024 and 0.015 eV for PTZ-XT, and PTZ-BP, respectively. The overall PLQY of PTZ-XT and PTZ-BP in the neat film state was observed to be 53 and 31%, respectively. AIE behavior of both the emitters was confirmed by recording PL spectra in various THF:water fractions. Non-doped OLEDs fabricated using PTZ-XT or PTZ-BP as an emitter in the emissive layer achieved a maximum EQE of 11.1 and 7.6%, respectively.
A blue-emitter, mSOAD, which is the positional isomer of the familiar DMAC-DPS emitter that is obtained by substituting DMAC at the 3,3′-positions of the DPS core, has been demonstrated by Li et al. (Scheme 2).37 The resulting molecule simultaneously exhibits both AIE and TADF properties. By adopting the meta-position, mSOAD had a highly twisted geometry and well-separated HOMO/LUMO distributions, which are beneficial to attain a very small ΔEST of 0.01 eV, compared to para-substituted DMAC-DPS (a ΔEST of 0.18 eV). AIE properties enabled mSOAD to achieve a higher PLQY of 71.8% in the film state than in diluted toluene solution (where the PLQY was only 9.1%). The devices containing mSOAD as the non-doped emitter achieved a maximum EQE of 14.0% (CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.32)), while DMAC-DPS showed only an 11.2% EQE (CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.30)). The devices obtained by doping mSOAD into DPEPO (36 wt%) showed a maximum EQE of 16.6%. Although the overall device stability did not display much progression, the non-doped devices exhibited rather higher device stabilities at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m−2, with a LT50 of 3.5 h, than the doped devices (a LT50 of 2.7 h; DPEPO, 24 wt%).
A D–A type green emitter, DMAC-TRZ, has been demonstrated by Wong et al. by tethering DMAC, the electron-donor, to 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (TRZ), the electron-acceptor (Scheme 2).23 DMAC-TRZ intrinsically possesses a twisted conformation with a comparatively large dihedral angle of 88° between the donor acridine and acceptor TRZ moieties, which is beneficial in breaking their conjugation. As a result, it shows an experimental small ΔEST of 0.046 eV and 0.050 eV for the neat and doped films, respectively. At room temperature and under a nitrogen atmosphere, the neat film of DMAC-TRZ has an 83.0% PLQY, which increases to 90% after doping into the mCPCN host. Furthermore, DMAC-TRZ exhibits a very small τDF of 3.6 μs and 1.8 μs for the neat and doped films, respectively. The non-doped device, fabricated through vacuum thermal evaporation with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/TAPC/mCP/DMAC-TRZ/DPPS/3TPYMB/LiF/Al, yields a high EQE up to 20.0%, which further increased to 26.5% after doping into the mCPCN host. Subsequently, Kaji and his coworkers implemented DMAC-TRZ as a non-doped emitter in solution-processable OLEDs.39 The authors tested the devices using two different electron transport layers (ETLs). Initially, they used BmPyPhB, having a higher LUMO level (−2.7 eV) than DMAC-TRZ (−3.1 eV), as the ETL, and the corresponding devices show a maximum EQE of 17.6%. However, the turn-on voltage is 4.8 V and the maximum EQE is only 2.9% at a practical brightness of 1000 cd m−2. In contrast, the OLEDs obtained by using B4PyMPM as the ETM, which possess a lower LUMO energy level (−3.7 eV) than DMAC-TRZ, show a maximum EQE of 16.8% along with a rather lower turn-on voltage of 4.0 V, because of the facilitated electron injection from the cathode. Particularly, the maximum EQE is retained at 13.7% at a practical brightness of 1000 cd m−2 in the latter devices.
Hong et al. developed two new intra and intermolecular exciplex-based green emitters, namely AmT and AmmT, by molecular engineering through the insertion of an additional phenyl group in the familiar DMAC-TRZ (Scheme 2).23,38 In general, the meta linkage between donor and acceptor units disables the ICT-induced absorption bands, and the resulting low oscillator strength leads to low luminescence. Nonetheless, AmT and AmmT exhibit strong emission with a large Stokes shift in the neat film state that is attributed to the intermolecular CT state (e.g., exciplex) corresponding to the difference between the HOMO of the emitter donor entity and the LUMO of the emitter acceptor unit. This phenomenon is a consequence of the more favorable formation of an intermolecular exciplex in the neat film than in solution due to the shorter intermolecular distances in the neat film. The ICT characters of both the emitters have been confirmed through photophysical experiments on the individual entities and their blended films. The PLQY values of the neat and doped films (DPEPO host, 20 wt%) of AmT are 52% and 27%, and of AmmT are 69% and 20%, respectively. The doped film of AmT shows a higher PLQY than that of AmmT, indicating that the formation of an intramolecular exciplex is more favored in AmT than in AmmT. However, the higher PLQY of the AmmT neat film than that of the AmT neat film indicates that the formation of an intermolecular exciplex is more likely in AmmT than in AmT. The experimentally calculated ΔEST values for the neat and doped films are 0.034 eV and 0.034 eV for AmT, and 0.057 eV and 0.032 eV for AmmT, respectively. Consequently, the non-doped devices based on AmmT show outstanding performance, with a maximum EQE of 18.66% (EL wavelength 504 nm), which was limited to only 5.30% (EL wavelength 554 nm) for AmT. Moreover, the devices obtained by doping AmT and AmmT into the DPEPO host (20 wt%) show much lower performance of only 4.19% and 3.28%, respectively. The higher performance of the non-doped devices compared to the corresponding doped devices demonstrates that the intermolecular CT excitons play a crucial role.
Zhang et al. introduced 10-phenyl-10H-phenothiazine 5,5-dioxide (2PTO) as an electron acceptor and developed a green-TADF emitter of PXZ2PTO by tethering phenoxazine as the electron donor (Scheme 3).40 This emitter exhibits both AIE and TADF features in solid films. From the peak values of the fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra, the ΔEST value was calculated to be 0.02 eV in 2-MeTHF solution. The PLQYs of the non-doped and doped films (DPEPO host, 80 wt%) are similar: 61.54% and 68.75%, respectively. The short τDF values were determined from the transient PL spectra to be 2.49 μs for non-doped and 2.61 μs for doped films (DPEPO, 80 wt%). The non-doped OLEDs fabricated from PXZ2PTO were found to have EQEs of up to 16.4% (EL at 504 nm, CIE coordinates of (0.27, 0.50)). A similar EQE of 16.3% was observed in the doped devices fabricated by using the DPEPO host (EL at 500 nm, CIE coordinates (0.24, 0.44)).
 Scheme 3  Chemical structures of various TADF small molecules as non-doped emitters. 
9-Phenyl-9H-carbazole derivatives (e.g., NCFCz, NCFMCz1, NCFMCz2, and NCFTCz) have been developed as AIE-TADF blue or green emitters by Grazulevicius et al. (Scheme 3).41 Depending on the substitution position, the PLQYs of the non-doped solid films of these emitters ranged from 17.0% to 53.0%. The PL spectra of solutions of NCFCz, NCFMCz2, NCFMCz1, and NCFTCz in toluene showed emission maxima at 433 nm (a PLQY of 29.48% in the film state), 529 nm (a PLQY of 16.95% in the film state), 510 nm (a PLQY of 52.17% in the film state), and 448 nm (a PLQY of 52.53% in the film state), respectively. The ΔEST values were observed to be in the range 0.05–0.21 eV. Among these, the authors implemented NCFMCz1- and NCFTCz- as non-doped emitters in OLEDs, which revealed EQEs of 7.2% and 3.2%, respectively.
Tao et al. demonstrated a carbazole and oxadiazole derivative as a bluish-green TADF emitter called 5CzOXD, which in turn is the derivative of the well-known 5CzCN (Scheme 3).42 A toluene solution of 5CzOXD showed bright-blue TADF emission, with an emission peak at 496 nm, and the PLQY was 8.6% under ambient conditions. The PLQY was enhanced to 58.2% after nitrogen purging. A PMMA-doped film of 5CzOXD showed a ΔEST of 0.22 eV. The non-doped OLED of 5CzOXD exhibited greenish-blue emission, with a maximum EQE of 3.6% (CIE values of (0.23, 0.43)), and, after doping into the mCP host, the EQE was enhanced to 9.3% and the emission color turned to blue, with CIE values of (0.18, 0.26). Because of the triplet energy being nearly 2.60 eV for 5CzOXD, it was implemented as a host material for green (4CzCNPy emitter) and yellow (4CzPNPh emitter) TADF emitters, which realized EQEs as high as 16.2% and 17.1%, respectively. Utilizing 5CzOXD as a blue and 4CzPNPh as a yellow TADF emitter, a two-color WOLED fabricated with the configuration ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/TAPC (40 nm)/5CzOXD:4CzPNPh (0.6 wt%, 10 nm)/BmPyPB (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al revealed a maximum EQE of up to 7.2%, with CIE coordinates of (0.35, 0.44).
Wang et al. developed a novel molecular model by connecting the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing moieties via a through-space and conjugation-forbidden linkage (D–spacer–A).43 10-Phenyl-DMAC and TRZ entities are associated through an ether linkage to obtain DMAC-o-TRZ (Scheme 3). This emitter effectively suppresses the intramolecular CT, while producing exciplex-type emission via intermolecular CT. The ΔEST was determined to be 0.018 eV in the neat film. The PLQY of DMAC-o-TRZ in the neat film (47.20%) is almost the same as that of its doped counterpart (mCP host, a PLQY of 52.06%), indicating that the intermolecular CT will considerably overwhelm the concentration quenching effect. DMAC-o-TRZ as a non-doped emitter with the structure of ITO/TAPC/TCTA/mCP/DMAC-o-TRZ/DPEPO/TmPyPb/LiF/Al realized a 14.7% EQE (CIE coordinates (0.22, 0.45)), and the doped device of the mCP host also showed a similar EQE of 15.5% (CIE coordinates (0.20, 0.42)).
B. Z. Tang and his coworkers demonstrated a variety of emitters that simultaneously exhibit TADF and AIE properties by constantly using keto as the acceptor entity while changing the donor moiety (Scheme 4). Initially, an unsymmetrical D–A–D′ type green-TADF emitter, namely DBT-BZ-DMAC, was developed (Scheme 4).30 The AIE property of this emitter was confirmed by using THF:water mixtures; as the water content increased, the PL intensity was greatly enhanced, along with blue-shifted emission (from 532 nm to 509 nm), because of aggregate formation. Indeed, the intramolecular rotational and vibrational motions are very active in the molecularly dispersed state in the solution. However, those motions are greatly restricted by aggregate formation, resulting in reduced nonradiative decay of the excited state, leading to strong radiative decay in the form of luminance. Rigidification of the molecular structure in the aggregated state can lower the reorganization energy, which is partially responsible for the blue-shifted emission compared to the corresponding dilute solution. The PL maximum of DBT-BZ-DMAC was observed at 505 nm in the neat film. DBT-BZ-DMAC shows an absolute PLQY of 80.2% in the neat film and the PLQY of the doped film in CBP (6 wt%) is moderately reduced to 65.9%. In general, in doped films, as the concentration of the dopant increases, ΔEST becomes smaller. For instance, ΔEST of the doped film of DBT-BZ-DMAC (6 wt%):CBP is 0.31 eV, while that of the DBT-BZ-DMAC (90 wt%):CBP doped film declines to 0.10 eV. In the end, the neat film of DBT-BZ-DMAC exhibits the smallest ΔEST of 0.08 eV. Non-doped OLEDs fabricated by using this emitter realize an excellent maximum EQE of 14.2% (CIE coordinates of (0.26, 0.55)), which predominantly remains the same at a high brightness of 1000 cd m−2. Although the EQE can be enhanced to 17.9% (CIE of 0.234, 0.510) by doping into the CBP host, the EQE is limited to only 10.9% at 1000 cd m−2 brightness. The AIE property allows small efficiency roll-off behavior in non-doped devices rather than in the doped devices, which is the main advantage of emitters displaying AIE. In particular, the non-doped OLEDs reveal a low turn-on voltage of 2.7 V at a luminance of 1 cd m−2, while it is 3.3 V for the doped devices. Subsequently, the same group extended their work to develop two new green/yellow emitters by replacing the donor DMAC of DBT-BZ-DMAC with phenoxazine (DBT-BZ-PXZ) or phenothiazine (DBT-BZ-PTZ), without disturbing the acceptor part (DBT-BZ-) (Scheme 4).44 The PL spectra of DBT-BZ-PXZ (λPLmax = 549 nm and a PLQY of 38.1%) and DBT-BZ-PTZ (λPLmax = 547 nm and a PLQY of 40.3%) in the film states are red-shifted by up to 40 nm and the PLQYs were reduced by up to 50% compared to the reference DBT-BZ-DMAC (λPLmax = 505 nm, PLQY 80.2%). Conversely, the PLQY of the doped film in CBP is enhanced to 57.5% for DBT-BZ-PXZ and 76.8% for DBT-BZ-PTZ, because the polarity of CBP is much weaker than that of the emitters. The measured ΔEST values for the neat films of DBT-BZ-PXZ (0.09 eV) and DBT-BZ-PTZ (0.05 eV) are comparable to that of DBT-BZ-DMAC (0.08 eV). Overall, the non-doped devices reveal maximum EQEs of 9.2% for DBT-BZ-PXZ and 9.7% for DBT-BZ-PTZ, which are inferior to that of DBT-BZ-DMAC (14.2%). On the other hand, the doped CBP devices of DBT-BZ-PXZ and DBT-BZ-PTZ display enhanced EQEs of 19.2% and 15.1%, respectively, while the DBT-BZ-DMAC-doped device exhibits up to a 17.9% EQE.

Furthermore, the aforementioned researchers replaced dibenzothiophene with 3,5-bis-carbazol-9-yl-phenyl (more familiar as mCP) by keeping the BZ-DMAC part the same as in DBT-BZ-DMAC to obtain a new green AIE-TADF emitter DCPDAPM (Scheme 4).45 The diluted THF solution (10−5 M) of DCPDAPM shows a weak PL intensity peak at 558 nm, with a very low PLQY of 6.2%; upon adding water (95%) to the THF solution, the PL maximum and the PLQY are drastically changed to 535 nm and 76.1%, respectively, because of the AIE property. ΔEST was calculated to be 0.10 eV in the solid state. The non-doped device of DCPDAPM has an EQE of 8.15% (EL peak λELmax = 522 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.28, 0.59)), while excellent performance in the form of a 19.67% (EL peak λELmax = 522 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.26, 0.56)) EQE was realized in films doped into the CBP host. Subsequently, by grafting 4-(phenoxazin-10-yl)benzoyl (-BZ-PXZ) from the reported DBT-BZ-PXZ, they developed a new series of yellow AIE-TADF emitters, DCB-BP-PXZ, CBP-BP-PXZ, mCP-BP-PXZ, and mCBP-BP-PXZ (Scheme 4).31 The crystal structure of CBP-BP-PXZ demonstrates that the torsion angle is 69.58° between the phenyl ring at the 10-position of PXZ and the CBP moiety, which adopts a tortile conformation, with large torsion angles of 87.58° and 58.58° observed between the phenyl ring and carbazole. It is well known that a highly twisted geometry can facilitate the separation of the HOMO and LUMO. The experimental ΔEST and PLQY values in the neat film state are 0.024 eV/69.0%, 0.020 eV/71.6%, 0.024 eV/66.0%, and 0.016 eV/71.2% sequentially for DCB-BP-PXZ, CBP-BP-PXZ, mCP-BP-PXZ, and mCBP-BP-PXZ. A benefit of the small ΔEST values is that high RISC rate constants, in the range 5.0–6.7 × 105 s−1, have been observed. Diluted THF solutions of the emitters show a short τPF of 4.6–8.3 ns and the τDF is hardly discernable. However, by adding a large quantity of water into the THF solution, not only does the PL intensity increase greatly but also the τPF becomes much longer with predictable τDF, which is evidence of AIE behavior. Non-doped OLEDs of these emitters reveal interesting results, with small turn-on voltages (2.5 V), stable yellow emission (542–548 nm; CIE coordinates of (0.39, 0.57)), and high luminances of nearly 100000 cd m−2. Moreover, all the emitters exhibit high EQEs in the range 21.4–22.6%, along with small efficiency roll-offs of 8.7–11.4%, even at a high luminance of 5000 cd m−2. The maximum power efficiency is also in the range 75.0–81.8 lm W−1. The high performance is ascribed to the balance between the holes and electrons of these emitters arising because of their ambipolar nature. The operational stability of CBP-BP-PXZ was also tested. The device shows LT50 values of 95, 56, and 31 h at an initial luminance of 500, 1000, and 2000 cd m−2, respectively. The key device performance and lifetime data are shown in Fig. 4.

In addition, D–A–D′ type green or yellow luminogens CP-BP-PXZ, CP-BP-PTZ, and CP-BP-DMAC exhibiting AIE and TADF characteristics have been designed and synthesized by the same research group (Scheme 4).32 The ΔEST values of these emitters are smaller, being in the range 0.016–0.033 eV, in the neat films than in doped films (CBP host; 0.039–0.072 eV). CP-BP-PXZ and CP-BP-PTZ display PLQYs of 58.0% and 45.3% in the neat film states, which further progress to 74.0% and 55.4%, respectively, in the doped films. This results from the reduced intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions and weakened intramolecular CT in the less polar doped films, compared with the more polar neat films. In contrast, CP-BP-DMAC shows a higher PLQY of 67.4% in the neat film than the doped film (40.8%). The important AIE characteristics are presented in Fig. 5. The non-doped OLED of CP-BP-PXZ shows the best performance, with a maximum EQE of 18.4% (EL peak λELmax at 548 nm) at a high luminance of 100290 cd m−2. In particular, the EQE remained as high as 18.2% at a high luminance of 1000 cd m−2. Moreover, the device obtained by doping CP-BP-PXZ in the CBP host (10 wt%) exhibits an improved EQE of 20.4%, however, its luminance is significantly lower (64490 cd m−2), and the operating voltages are increased at a particular luminance. The superior performance of CP-BP-PXZ can be attributed to the high PLQY, small ΔEST, and better charge balance.

Zhang et al. utilized the previously reported CPzPO (later, it was named OPDPO; Scheme 3), which is a yellow emitter, to fabricate white OLEDs in two different ways: (i) through a combination with the AIE-active emitter 2CzTPEPCz; and (ii) by using a simple TADF blue emitter (DMAC-DPS).46 OPPDO exhibits a maximum PL wavelength of 589 nm in the thin film state, along with a small ΔEST of 0.02 eV. In the first report, they mentioned that OPDPO-based non-doped OLEDs achieve a maximum EQE of 16.6% at a high luminance of 3600 cd m−2. The doped devices obtained by using CBP as the host (10 wt%) achieve the highest EQE of 26.7%. Moreover, the non-doped and doped (CBP:10 wt% OPDPO) WOLEDs fabricated by using the AIE-active blue emitter 2CzTPEPCz realize maximum EQEs of 14.6% and 10.7%, respectively. The EL spectra of both the doped and non-doped devices show that yellow emission is stronger than blue emission, which results in warm white-light emission, with CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.44) and a CRI of 70 for doped and CIE coordinates of (0.46, 0.46) and a CRI of 73 for non-doped devices. Fully non-doped WOLEDs in which DMAC-DPS is implemented as a blue and OPDPO as a yellow TADF emitter realize maximum EQEs of up to 19.8%.
Ma et al. developed two new orange emitters (SFDBQPXZ and DFDBQPXZ) by changing the number of fluorine atoms, which results in both AIE and TADF features being exhibited (Scheme 4).47 The degassed (with argon) toluene solution of SFDBQPXZ exhibits both prompt and delayed components, with lifetimes of 21.6 ns and 4.6 μs, while the corresponding numbers for DFDBQPXZ are 19.0 ns and 2.6 μs, respectively. Transient PL after degassing with argon in toluene displays their bi-exponential decay with prompt and delayed components with lifetimes of 21.6 ns and 4.6 μs for SFDBQPXZ and 19.0 ns and 2.6 μs for DFDBQPXZ, respectively. After doping into the CBP host, SFDBQPXZ and DFDBQPXZ show PLQYs of 99.6% and 88.3%, respectively. The non-doped devices of SFDBQPXZ and DFDBQPXZ show maximum EQEs of 10.1% (EL peak λELmax at 584 nm) and 9.8% (EL peak λELmax at 588 nm), respectively, which significantly improve to 23.5% (EL peak λELmax at 548 nm) and 16.8% (EL peak λELmax at 548 nm), respectively, upon doping into the CBP host. Interestingly, the doped device shows a rather low turn-on voltage of ∼2.7 V (non-doped ∼3.2 V). The same group developed another series of AIE-TADF green to red emitters (SBDBQ-DMAC, DBQ-3DMAC, SBDBQ-PXZ, and DBQ-3PXZ) by using DMAC or 10H-phenoxazine (PXZ) as the donor unit to a quinoxaline acceptor-framework (Scheme 4).22 The fluorescence emission peaks of SBDBQ-DMAC, DBQ-3DMAC, SBDBQ-PXZ, and DBQ-3PXZ in the film states are observed at 541, 551, 594, and 618 nm, respectively, displaying a wide range of colors that can be tuned from green to yellow to orange to red. According to the room temperature fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra that were recorded at 77 K, the ΔEST values are calculated to be 0.06, 0.06, 0.07, and 0.03 eV for SBDBQ-DMAC, DBQ-3DMAC, SBDBQ-PXZ, and DBQ-3PXZ, respectively. Moreover, the PLQYs of the doped films (10 wt% CBP) are observed to be 74%, 84%, 73%, and 76% for SBDBQ-DMAC, DBQ-3DMAC, SBDBQ-PXZ, and DBQ-3PXZ, respectively. The non-doped/doped (CBP host, 10 wt%) devices yield maximum EQEs of 10.1% (EL at 544 nm)/13.0% (EL at 532 nm), 12.0% (EL at 548 nm)/22.4% (EL at 536 nm), 5.6% (EL at 608 nm)/11.1% (EL at 572 nm), and 5.3% (EL at 616 nm)/14.1% (EL at 572 nm) for SBDBQ-DMAC, DBQ-3DMAC, SBDBQ-PXZ, and DBQ-3PXZ, respectively. Moreover, the roll-off of the devices is also observed to be lower. This study systematically shows how to tune the emitters’ colors.
A deep-red to NIR TADF-emitter (TPA–QCN) was developed by combining triphenylamine (TPA) and quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (QCN) as an electron donor (D) and acceptor (A), respectively, proposed by Liu et al. (Scheme 4).48 Deep-red and NIR emitters have wide applications in night vision, telecommunications, sensors, and bioimaging. TPA–QCN as a dilute solution in toluene (1.0 × 10−5 M) displays orange-red emission at a wavelength of 585 nm and a PLQY of 85%, whereas the crystals prepared by temperature-gradient vacuum sublimation exhibit deep-red emission at a wavelength of 677 nm and a PLQY of 38%; the vacuum processed neat thin films display NIR emission, with the emission wavelength, λemmax, being 733 nm and the PLQY 21%. Furthermore, ΔEST is estimated to be 0.23 eV from the emission maxima of the fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra obtained in toluene solution at 77 K. While the TPA–QCN crystal shows only a short τPF (45.0 ns), the neat thin film has both a short τPF (14.3 ns) and a long τDF (0.8 μs), indicating the predominance of TADF characteristics in the film state. Overall, the non-doped OLEDs have a 3.9% EQE, with a maximum EL wavelength of 728 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.69, 0.31). Although the maximum EQE is considerably boosted to 14.5% in doped films involving TPBi as the host, the maximum EL wavelength is bathochromic-shifted to the red region, with an EL maximum at 644 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.62, 0.38).
A NIR-TADF emitter of APDC-DTPA with wedge-shaped D–π–A–π–D structure was developed by Liao et al. (Scheme 4).49 The ΔEST value was estimated to be 0.14 eV by using the onset of the low-temperature fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra recorded in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. The absolute PLQY of APDC-DTPA was observed to be 17% for the neat film, which dramatically increased to 63% in a doped film (10 wt%) with the TPBi host. APDC-DTPA as a non-doped emitter exhibited a maximum EQE of 2.19% at a peak wavelength of 777 nm, which increased to 10.19% upon doping into TPBi, with an emission peak observed at 693 nm.
Yellow to red emitting AIE-TADF emitters with donor/acceptor-tethered Janus (Janus is a Roman God having two faces) o-carborane triads of PCZ-CB-TRZ, 2PCZ-CB, and TPA-CB-TRZ have been developed by Yasuda et al. (Scheme 5).50o-Carborane (1,2-closo-dicarbadodecaborane (C2B10H12)) is an electron-deficient icosahedral boron cluster consisting of three-center two-electron bonds and exhibits highly polarizable s-aromatic character. All three compounds exhibited blue emission in pure THF solution with very small PLQYs, which can be attributed to the fluorescence originating from the locally excited (LE) states of their corresponding segments. By adding water to the THF solution, the LE emission bands became negligible and new ICT bands appeared in the yellow to red wavelength region with higher PLQYs, which was indicative of AIE-active behavior. Vacuum-deposited neat films of PCZ-CB-TRZ, 2PCZ-CB, and TPA-CB-TRZ exhibited PL at 557 (a PLQY of 97%), 624 (a PLQY of 55%), and 571 nm (a PLQY of 94%), respectively. Consequently, the non-doped devices of these emitters displayed maximum EQEs of 11.0%, 10.1%, and 9.2%, respectively.

Herein, organic compounds with molecular weights greater than 1000 are considered as dendrimers. All the dendrimers were implemented through solution-processes in OLEDs.
Yamamoto's research group introduced for the first time high-molecular-weight green-TADF emitters, G1TAZ, G2TAZ, G3TAZ, and G4TAZ, composed of carbazole dendrimers that are attached to a triphenyl-σ-triazine core for solution-processable non-doped OLEDs (Scheme 6).24 The ΔEST values calculated from the fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra of the neat films followed the order G4TAZ (0.07 eV) > G3TAZ (0.05 eV) > G2TAZ (0.03 eV); all these values are small enough to allow the transfer of triplet excitons from the lowest triplet state to the lowest singlet state through RISC. The overall PLQYs were measured to be high in toluene solution at 94%, 100%, and 94%, and lower in the film state at 52%, 31%, and 8.5%, for G2TAZ, G3TAZ, and G4TAZ, respectively. The lower PLQYs in the film state for the higher generation dendrimers could be attributed to the long delayed fluorescence lifetimes. The non-doped OLEDs realized maximum EQEs of 2.4% (G2TAZ), 3.4% (G3TAZ), and 1.5% (G4TAZ). Subsequently, these researchers designed benzophenone as an acceptor core that was tethered with different generations of carbazole to obtain green-emitters (G1B, G2B, and G3B) that concurrently exhibited both AIE and TADF characteristics (Scheme 6).51 ΔEST was calculated to be 0.12 eV and 0.10 eV for G2B and G3B, respectively, in the neat film state, however, ΔEST was reported to be higher for G1B (0.21 eV) in the doped film,52 which indicated that the exchange integral of the HOMO and LUMO wave functions decreases as the generation of the dendrimer increases, allowing for smaller ΔEST. The total PLQY in the film state was 33.4% for G2B and 21.1% for G3B, which were about 1.4 times higher than those obtained in toluene. Solution-processed non-doped OLEDs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (70 nm)/PVK (20 nm)/G2B or G3B/TPBi (40 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (80 nm), where TPBi was deposited through the vacuum process or spin coating. When TPBi was deposited through the vacuum process, G2B showed a maximum EQE of 4.8% (an EL wavelength of 500 nm) and G3B displayed a 3.6% EQE (an EL wavelength of 513 nm). On the other hand, when TPBi was deposited by using spin coating, G2B realized a 5.7% EQE (an EL wavelength of 500 nm) and G3B exhibited a 2.9% EQE (an EL wavelength of 516 nm). Even the devices fabricated by doping into the mCP host or changing the ETL could not exhibit enhanced EQEs compared to those of all-solution processed G2B devices (5.7%). Furthermore, the abovementioned researchers recently modified G2B by substituting alkyl, alkoxy, or aryl groups and developed a series of green-TADF emitters, tBuG2B, MeG2B, MeOG2B, and PhG2B, for highly efficient all-solution-processed TADF OLEDs (Scheme 6).53 The PLQYs increased in the film state (10 wt% PMMA films) for tBuG2B (74%), MeG2B (34%), and PhG2B (41%), but decreased for MeOG2B (17%), compared to that of unsubstituted G2B (33.4%). ΔEST calculated for the neat film is smaller for tBuG2B (0.08 eV), MeG2B (0.09 eV), and MeOG2B (0.11 eV) and higher for PhG2B (0.14 eV) than G2B (0.12 eV). Similar to the above mentioned devices, they also fabricated non-doped OLEDs having the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/subG2B/SPPO13/LiF/Al, where the ETM SPPO13 was fabricated through vacuum deposition or spin coating. When SPPO13 was deposited by the vacuum process, the devices of tBuG2B, MeG2B, MeOG2B, and PhG2B had EQEs of 8.9%, 7.4%, 4.3%, and 7.3%, respectively. However, all-solution-processed OLEDs, including SPPO13, exhibited maximum EQEs of up to 17.0% for tBuG2B, 9.0% for MeG2B, 6.4% for MeOG2B, and 8.8% for PhG2B. Moreover, the all-soluble OLED of tBuG2B maintained a high EQE of 13.8% even at a high luminance of 1000 cd m−2. Similar devices of all the emitters were tested by using TPBi as the ETL. Among all, tBuG2B yielded the highest efficiency, with a maximum EQE of 14.5% for all-solution-processed OLEDs and 9.6% for TPBi as vacuum-processed devices. These studies proved that tBuG2B is the most noteworthy emitter for all-solution-processed OLEDs. However, tBuG2B had already been reported in 2016 by Jiang's group, who named it t-BuTCz2BP.54 The solution-processed OLEDs fabricated by using t-BuTCz2BP as the non-doped green-TADF emitter had a lower efficiency, with the maximum EQE being 4.3% and CIE coordinates of (0.257, 0.463). The Yamamoto group established another series of green-TADF emitters based on carbazole-triazine, G2TAZ, MeG2TAZ, tBuG2TAZ, and PhG2TAZ (Scheme 6).55 All the dendrimers show ΔEST in the range of 0.07–0.13 eV in their neat film states. The PLQY in the neat film state was calculated to be 52.0% for G2TAZ, 40.0% for MeG2TAZ, 44% for tBuG2TAZ, and 49% for PhG2TAZ. However, all the dendrimers exhibit PLQYs of over 85% in toluene. The OLEDs fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (spin coated)/PVK (spin coated)/dendrimers (spin coated film)/TPBi (vacuum deposited)/Ca/Al exhibit maximum EQEs of 6.2%, 7.5%, 8.1%, and 6.6%, for G2TAZ, MeG2TAZ, tBuG2TAZ, and PhG2TAZ, respectively. The lifetime data (LT85) was measured to be the highest for tBuG2TAZ, being nearly 60 min at a luminance of 100 cd m−2, which decreases to about 10 min at 1000 cd m−2. All-solution-processed OLEDs that included TPBi in the above configuration afford maximum EQEs of 6.0%, 9.4%, 9.5%, and 8.2%, in that order, which are slightly superior to those obtained with vacuum-deposited ETLs.
 Scheme 6  The green-TADF dendritic molecules as non-doped emitters developed by Yamamoto's research group. 
W. Jiang et al. demonstrated several dendritic TADF emitters by encapsulating a known TADF emitter in a suitable host material, which can suppress the intermolecular interactions and enable radiative decay (Scheme 7). Initially, they developed two self-hosting blue emitters, tbCz-SO and poCz-SO, consisting of 9,9′-(sulfonylbis(4,1-phenylene))bis(3-methoxy-9H-carbazole) as the emissive core that was encapsulated with tert-butyl-9H-carbazole (tbCz-SO) and 3,6-bis(diphenyl phosphoryl)-9H-carbazole (poCz-SO).56 ΔEST of tbCz-SO and poCz-SO was ascertained to be 0.21 eV and 0.11 eV, respectively, in toluene. The non-doped OLEDs consisting of tbCz-SO as the emitter realized a maximum EQE of 2.6%, with the CIE coordinates being (0.16, 0.19), while those containing poCz-SO exhibited an EQE of 6.2% with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.27). The dominance of the hole carrier capacity of the peripheral tbCz host part of tbCz-SO rendered reduced carrier balance, which narrowed the carrier recombination zone of the EML and resulted in a severe exciton quenching effect. However, the bipolar transporting capability of the poCz peripheral dendron of poCz-SO could facilitate the charge balance of the EML, leading to higher device performance. Slightly red-shifted emission of poCz-SO could be anticipated owing to the higher dipole moment of the poCz units. Subsequently, they incorporated the poCz entities at the 3 and 6-positions of the carbazoles of the above discussed poCz-SO dendrimer and developed a new TADF dendrimer named POCz-DPS (Scheme 7).57 The core blue emitter, bis[4-(3,6-dimethoxycarbazole)phenyl]sulfone, has been termed DMOC-DPS, which was connected through the hexyl linker of the host. The ΔEST value measured in toluene for POCz-DPS was 0.23 eV, which was similar to that of the parent DMOC-DPS (0.24 eV). The PL spectrum of the thin film state of POCz-DPS (PL wavelength, λPLmax, 460 nm) was blue-shifted by 10 nm relative to the parent DMOC-DPS (PL wavelength, λPLmax, 470 nm) because of the reduced intermolecular interactions as a result of the effective encapsulation of the peripheral dendrons. Moreover, the effective encapsulation suppressed the concentration quenching and facilitated the radiative decay of the parent core, which could result in higher PLQYs of 61%, for POCz-DPS, and 42%, for DMOC-DPS. The non-doped OLEDs fabricated with POCz-DPS showed a maximum EQE of 7.3% with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.30), while DMOC-DPS was limited to only a 0.6% EQE, with CIE coordinates of (0.26, 0.33). The superior performance of POCz-DPS could be attributed to the higher PLQY, balanced charge transfer, and pinhole-free film morphology, compared to DMOC-DPS. Moreover, the control device obtained by using the peripheral dendron PPO2 as the host and the parent emissive core DMOC-DPS (10 wt%) as the emitter achieved a maximum EQE of 4.8%, with CIE coordinates of (0.19, 0.32), which was inferior to that of POCz-DPS, suggesting the importance of a single-component emitter over a physically blended system.
 Scheme 7  The self-hosting dendrimers as non-doped emitters developed by Jiang's group. 
In another series of experiments, the aforementioned researchers selected the well-known green TADF emitter 4CzIPN as the emissive core and the familiar TCTA and mCP as the host, which were connected through hexyl chains (Scheme 7).10,58 The resulting dendrimer G-TCTA showed a very low PLQY of only 8.0%, which was enhanced to 90.0% for G-mCP. The very low PLQY of G-TCTA is due to the exciplex formation between the TCTA dendron and the emissive core, indicating that the intramolecular exciplex type would not be suitable for application in TADF single component OLEDs. ΔEST was calculated to be 0.09 eV for G-TCTA and 0.08 eV for G-mCP in toluene. The non-doped OLEDs consisting of G-mCP as the emitter in the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/G-TCTA or G-mCP/B3PYMPM/Cs2CO3/Al had the highest efficiency (EQE) of 16.5%, whereas it was limited to only 0.50% for G-TCTA. The individual host and emissive cores of the G-mCP blend OLEDs displayed only a 6.9% EQE. The more than two-fold higher performance of single-component OLEDs compared to the corresponding blended OLEDs shows that the single molecule system had better homogeneous film morphology, while the physical blending could weaken the phase separation and induce negative results. Subsequently, the familiar blue emitter 5CzCN59 was selected as the TADF core and encapsulated with carbazole to develop the green TADF emitter Cz-CzCN (Scheme 7).25 The conversion from blue to green was due to the substitution of oxygen at the fourth position of each carbazole entity. S1 of Cz-CzCN was ascertained from the onset of the fluorescence spectrum and T1 was calculated from the highest energy peak of the phosphorescence spectrum. Thus, the calculated S1 and T1 values were 2.83 eV and 2.66 eV, respectively, and the resulting ΔEST was 0.17 eV, which was similar to that of the core 5CzCN. The PLQY of Cz-CzCN in toluene was observed to be only 20% under ambient conditions, and it drastically improved to 88% after purging with nitrogen, which was indicative of TADF behavior. The PLQY of Cz-CzCN in the film state was measured to be 52%, while that of the core 5CzCN was only 21%, because of the reduction in intermolecular interactions as a result of exciton quenching in Cz-CzCN. The τPF and τDF values were calculated to be 13.5 ns and 2.8 μs, respectively. The authors systematically implemented four types of OLEDs (device A, B, C, and D) by using Cz-CzCN as the non-doped emitter and changing the ETL or its processing. Device-A had the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Cz-CzCN/TPBi/Cs2CO3/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and Cz-CzCN were deposited through solution processes, and the electron transporting TPBi was deposited through the vacuum process. The corresponding devices revealed a maximum EQE of 13.4% (CIE coordinates of (0.26, 0.52)). Device-B had the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Cz-CzCN/PhPO/Al, where PhPO is the ETM, which was deposited by using solution processes (all-solution-processed OLEDs); the EQE of this device was 15.5% (CIE coordinates of (0.25, 0.52)). The similar performance of devices A and B indicated that the PhPO layer facilitated electron injection and transport, compared with TPBi. The control device C consisted of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Cz-CzCN/PhPO/Cs2CO3/Al, where PhPO as the electron transport material was deposited by using the vacuum process, and also showed a similar EQE of 17.1% (CIE coordinates of (0.26, 0.52)). The devices B and C showed similar turn-on voltages (3.1 V) and the comparable device performance demonstrates that Cz-CzCN can impart resistance to the EML against the isopropyl alcohol used for processing the upper ETL. Moreover, device-B showed a rather low-efficiency roll-off at high luminance of up to 10000 cd m−2. The final device-D, without any ETL (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Cz-CzCN/Al), realized an EQE of only 2.1% (CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.52)), indicating that the ETL is essential to give efficient charge transport and exciton recombination.
A self-hosting NIR TADF emitter, namely MPPA-MCBP, was also developed by the same research group (Scheme 7).60 MPPA-MCBP exhibits a ΔEST of 0.17 eV that was measured in toluene, and the PLQY is 10% in the neat film state. Consequently, the non-doped device of MPPA-MCBP reveals a maximum EQE of 0.62% with a peak wavelength of 698 nm. The control device of the blended MPPA:MCBP (a molar ratio of 1:4) exhibits poor performance, with a maximum EQE of 0.11%, EL wavelength of 710 nm, and maximum luminance of 26 cd m−2.
Yang et al. developed three different series of single-component TADF emitters by appending carbazole dendrons to a known TADF emissive core. Initially, they selected the leading blue TADF emitter DMAC-DPS and encapsulated it with tert-butyl carbazole (CzDMAC-DPS) or its trimer (DCzDMAC-DPS) to develop blue or greenish-blue TADF emitters (Scheme 8).61 Both the dendrimers show CT behavior between the acridine donor and the DPS acceptor, as revealed by their absorption spectra. As the generation of carbazole dendrons increases, the absorption intensity of the CT bands is decreased, suggesting that the energy of the CT transition state is reduced. The PL spectrum of the neat film state of the parent DMAC-DPS exhibits a peak at 470 nm, however, this is red-shifted to 492 nm for CzDMAC-DPS and slightly blue-shifted to 464 nm for DCzDMAC-DPS. This phenomenon can be well explained through DFT studies. DMAC-DPS possesses well-separated HOMO and LUMO distributions that are localized on donor-DMAC and acceptor-DPS units, respectively. Similar to that of DMAC-DPS, the LUMOs of CzDMAC-DPS and DCzDMAC-DPS are also located on the acceptor-DPS unit. However, the HOMO of CzDMAC-DPS is delocalized over DMAC and the attached carbazole entities, thereby resulting in a strong CT feature that induces a redshift of the emission peak. On the contrary, the HOMO of DCzDMAC-DPS is mainly distributed over the outer carbazole dendrons, instead of over DMAC, which can weaken the CT nature and produce a blue-shift of the emission peak relative to those of DMAC-DPS and CzDMAC-DPS. ΔEST was calculated to be 0.09 eV and 0.20 eV for CzDMAC-DPS and DCzDMAC-DPS, respectively. The overall PLQY was measured to be 68% for CzDMAC-DPS and 48% for DCzDMAC-DPS in the films. The non-doped OLEDs based on DMAC-DPS and CzDMAC-DPS exhibit true blue emission, with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.31) and (0.18, 0.27), respectively; this emission is shifted to greenish-blue for the DCzDMAC-DPS-based devices with CIE coordinates of (0.22, 0.44). The CzDMAC-DPS devices display a maximum EQE of 12.2%, which is only 7.0% for DMAC-DPS and 2.2% for DCzDMAC-DPS. The high performance of CzDMAC-DPS is due to the high PLQY, small ΔEST, and homogeneous formation of a film with a small RMS roughness value.
 Scheme 8  Several non-doped TADF dendritic emitters. 
Subsequently, they chose another known green TADF emitter, DMAC-BP,34 which is derived from DMAC-DPS by replacing the sulfonyl (SO2) with a keto (CO) group, and developed two new green-TADF dendrimers CDE1 (a derivative of CzDMAC-DPS) and CDE2 (a derivative of DCzDMAC-DPS) (Scheme 8).62 ΔEST was calculated in the film state to be 0.11 eV and 0.15 eV for CDE1 and CDE2, respectively. The neat films of CDE1 and CDE2 show PLQYs of 77% and 75%, respectively. The non-doped OLEDs fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CDE1 or CDE2/TPBi/Liq/Al show maximum EQEs of 9.7%, for CDE1, and 3.3%, for CDE2, at room temperature. After exposing the EML to elevated temperatures such as 80, 120, and 160 °C, the CDE1-based devices have maximum EQE values of 12.0%, 8.8%, and 8.3%, and CDE2 5.2%, 5.2%, and 4.7%, respectively. The CDE1 device exposed to 80 °C not only has the highest efficiency of 12.0% but also retains a high EQE, which is 11.9% at 1000 cd m−2 and 10.3% at 5000 cd m−2; this indicates small efficiency roll-off behavior. Moreover, all the devices exhibit good color stability at the elevated temperatures, which is beneficial in practical applications. The EL spectra of these emitters are red-shifted by >23 nm, compared to the corresponding PL spectra, in the film state, which may be due to exciplex formation at the interface between the EML and the ETL. To prove this hypothesis, CDE1 was selected as the emitter to fabricate OLEDs with different ET materials such as 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BPhen), 4,6-bis(3,5-di-3-pyridylphenyl)-2-methylpyrimidine (B3PYMPM), and 1,3,5-tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]benzene (TmPyPB), which were compared with those without any ETL. The devices without any ETL show maximum EL at 528 nm, while the devices with an ETL are red-shifted by over 20 nm, thus exciplex formation was proved. The exciplex formation was further proven based on the steady-state PL spectra of TmPyPB:CDE1 films, which show gradual redshifts upon increasing the ratio of TmPyPB from 10 wt% to 50 wt%. Among all, TmPyPB as an ETL device shows slightly superior performance, with an EQE of 13.3%, compared to TPBi (EQE 11.9%), because of the high electron mobility and excellent hole blocking ability of TmPyPB. Another two green TADF emitters (2CzSO and 3CzSO) have been developed by appending carbazole dendrons to an eminent TADF emitter, 2,8-bis(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)dibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide (1CzSO).63,64 The ΔEST values measured in the film state follow the decreasing order of 1CzSO (0.35 eV) > 2CzSO (0.16 eV) > 3CzSO (0.08 eV). The PLQYs of 1CzSO, 2CzSO, and 3CzSO are 14%, 57%, and 31%, respectively. Non-doped OLEDs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1CzSO or 2CzSO or 3CzSO/different ETMs (TPBi or TmPyPB or BmPyPB)/Liq/Al. Among the different ETMs, TmPyPB as the ETM and 2CzSO or 3CzSO as the emitter have maximum EQEs of up to 10.7% and 7.3%, respectively.
Li et al. developed three new blue TADF-dendrimers (G1, G2, and G3) by selecting DPS as the electron-acceptor and carbazole or its higher generation dendrons as the donor (Scheme 8).65 The ΔEST values followed the decreasing order of 0.33 (G1) > 0.25 (G2) > 0.17 (G3). The PLQYs of G1, G2, and G3 were 42%, 58%, and 22%, respectively, in the film state. Among these, only G2 and G3 could be fabricated as non-doped EMLs in OLEDs, which showed maximum current efficiencies of only 4.1 cd A−1 and 1.07 cd A−1, respectively.
Phosphine oxide or sulfonyl (SO2) as an electron acceptor core encapsulated with carbazole dendrons was demonstrated as blue or bluish-green TADF emitters (TPPOCz and DBSOCz (this is the same molecule as that present in the previously discussed G2)) by J. Wang et al.66 TPPOCz and DBSOCz showed a ΔEST of 0.22 eV and 0.10 eV, respectively. TPPOCz exhibited a τDF of 1.29 μs, whereas τDF of DBSOCz was 0.87 μs. The non-doped OLEDs of TPPOCz and DBSOCz exhibited maximum EQEs of 2.0% and 7.65%, respectively. Without the ETL, the double-layered OLEDs were limited to maximum EQEs of 0.27% and 1.3%, respectively.
Our group systematically investigated two novel three-armed luminogens as TADF green-emitters, namely IAcTr-out and IAcTr-in, which consisted of triazine as the acceptor and indenoacridine as the donor (Scheme 9).67 Both the emitters showed not only TADF characteristics but also AIE. ΔEST measured in the film state was ascertained to be small, being 0.052 eV for IAcTr-out and 0.069 eV for IAcTr-in. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the PLQYs of IAcTr-out and IAcTr-in were found to be 32.8% and 30.4%, respectively, whereas, in the film state, they were enhanced to 47.7% and 64.5%, respectively. The increase in the PLQY from the solution to the film state indicated AIE behavior. Besides, both the emitters displayed intriguing AIE behavior, as evidenced by the PL spectra measured for different ratios of a THF:water mixture. The two emitters, IAcTr-out and IAcTr-in, exhibit yellow (PL peak at 562 nm) and orange-red emission (PL peak at 580 nm), respectively, in pure THF solution with rather low peak intensities. Upon the addition of a water fraction to the THF solution, the PL spectra were red-shifted to 579 nm and 594 nm, respectively, with the increase in intensity confirming the AIE property (Fig. 6). The non-doped all-solution-processed devices based on IAcTr-out showed a maximum EQE of 4.10%, and IAcTr-in exhibited the best performance of a 10.93% EQE; TPBi deposited through vacuum deposition achieved a maximum EQE of 3.8% for IAcTr-out and 11.90% for IAcTr-in. These studies clearly demonstrated that particularly IAcTr-in was the most effective, even among all-solution-processed OLEDs. Furthermore, the doped devices of IAcTr-out and IAcTr-in obtained by using the mCP host had maximum EQEs of 17.53% and 18.43%, respectively. The superior performance of IAcTr-in in various device configurations could be explained by the stronger AIE characteristics, which in turn led to higher PLQYs, smaller kTnr, and faster kRISC values.

Likewise, our group demonstrated a very simple structure solution-processed TADF-OLED, i.e., one without any hole injection or hole transport layer. In this regard, we have developed two new dendrimers, namely TB2CZ-ACTRZ and TB14CZ-ACTRZ.68 These emitters consisted of a known acridine–triazine derivative (DMAC-TRZ) as the emissive core that was encapsulated with di-tert-butyl carbazole or its higher generation dendrimer. TB2CZ-ACTRZ and TB14CZ-ACTRZ possessed a small ΔEST of 0.079 eV and 0.134 eV, respectively, in the film state. The absolute PLQYs of TB2CZ-ACTRZ and TB14CZ-ACTRZ were found to be 69.2% and 56.4%, respectively, in the film state. The excited-state τPF/τDF values were 21.7 ns/2.9 μs and 16.1 ns/25.2 μs, respectively, for the two emitters. TB2CZ-ACTRZ has the higher HOMO energy level of −5.30 eV, with that of TB14CZ-ACTRZ being −5.48 eV. Owing to the small ΔEST, high PLQY, and rather high HOMO energy levels, we attempted to fabricate them as non-doped emitters in simple structure OLEDs that did not contain any HIL or HTL. Such devices, fabricated with the configuration of ITO/TB2CZ-ACTRZ or TB14CZ-ACTRZ/TPBi/LiF/Al, demonstrated a maximum EQE of 9.5% for TB2CZ-ACTRZ and 8.1% for TB14CZ-ACTRZ, while the unencapsulated emitter core ACTRZ was limited to only a 1.2% EQE. In particular, the small dendritic TB2CZ-ACTRZ (EL λELmax of 520 nm) exhibited a similar EL wavelength to that of the core ACTRZ (EL λELmax of 520 nm), while the large dendritic TB14CZ-ACTRZ (EL λELmax of 496 nm) showed a significant blue-shift of up to 24 nm because of the enhanced non-polar circumstances and reduced intermolecular interactions of the emissive core (ACTRZ). Thus, it is further beneficial in the color tuning of emitters. Devices incorporating a HIL and HTL, with TB2CZ-ACTRZ and TB14CZ-ACTRZ, had maximum EQEs of 9.9% and 5.5%, respectively. These results showed the potential of these dendrimers as non-doped emitters in simple structure OLEDs. This is the only report of OLEDs without a HIL or HTL to date.
4. Polymers
Several polymers exhibiting TADF characteristics have been demonstrated as emitters without the assistance of a host in the emissive layer of OLEDs. In general, TADF polymers are designed by inserting a TADF moiety into the polymer backbone or grafting it as a side chain. It is also possible to design a charge-transfer complex based on donor–acceptor interactions through-space. Polymers are known to be ideally suited for solution processes. The following polymers were implemented through the solution process only.
Nikolaenko et al. demonstrated the “intermonomer TADF” concept based on a green-LEP polymeric emitter (Scheme 10).26 Aryl amine as the donor, triazine as the acceptor, and an alkyl chain as the spacer were selected. The resulting polymer exhibited a 43.6% PLQY, with a ΔEST of 0.22 eV in the film state. The maximum EQE of the LEP polymer was observed to be 10.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.58) in non-doped devices.
 Scheme 10  The various TADF polymers reported as non-doped emitters. 
C. Yang et al. developed a series of blue and bluish-green TADF polymers, P0, P3, P6, P9, and P12, by grafting the known TADF emitter 10-(4-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)phenyl)-10H-phenoxazine onto the backbone of polycarbazole (Scheme 10).69 Polycarbazole exhibits good hole-transporting ability and a high triplet energy (2.6 eV). Thus, the polycarbazole backbone functions as the charge transporting and host parts, while the grafted units enable other functionalities without affecting the electronic properties of the polymer backbone. The feed molar ratios between three different monomers have been changed to prepare a series of polymers, and the expected molar ratio was confirmed by proton NMR spectroscopy. However, all these polymers show moderate weight-average molecular weight (Mw) values of 5329, 7358, 5530, 6273, and 5806 for P0, P3, P6, P9, and P12, respectively. The total PLQY is 27.5% for P3, 27.2% for P6, 33.6% for P9, and 33.7% for P12 measured in the film state. The non-doped OLEDs fabricated by using P3 show a maximum EQE of 1.2% (EL λELmax of 478 nm), with the corresponding performance being 1.1% for P6 (EL λELmax of 492 nm), 4.0% for P9 (EL λELmax of 498 nm), and 4.3% (the highest) for P12 (EL λELmax of 506 nm).
In another series of experiments, they replaced oxadiazole with the strong acceptor DPS, along with some side chain engineering, to develop a series of polymers, PCzDP-0, PCzDP-5, PCzDP-10, PCzDP-15, and PCzDP-20 (Scheme 10).70 The polymer structures and molecular weights were confirmed through NMR and GPC studies. These polymers show an Mw of 5448, 11347, 8370, 15980, and 9205 for PCzDP-0, PCzDP-5, PCzDP-10, PCzDP-15, and PCzDP-20, respectively. The PLQYs of these polymers are in the range 50–67% in toluene and 39–74% in the film state. The experimental ΔEST was found to be very small for PCzDP-20 (0.02 eV), which is significantly smaller than that of the parent PXZ-DP-Cz (0.08 eV). Among these polymers, they tested only PCzDP-10 as a non-doped emitter, which shows a maximum EQE of 2.8% (CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.47)); this enhances to 5.0% (CIE coordinates of (0.29, 0.48)) after doping into the mCP host (50 wt%). Moreover, by adding DMAC-DP-Cz as an assistant dopant (because of its high PLQY of 94%) to the already doped devices, mCP:DMAC-DP-Cz:PCzDP-10 (5:1:4) realizes a maximum EQE of 16.1% (CIE coordinates of (0.22, 0.40)). The higher performance of the devices containing the assistant dopant is supported by the increase in the PLQY from 46% (PCzDP-10) to 78% (mCP:DMACDP-Cz:PCzDP-10). The proposed energy transfer of host:assistant TADF-dopant:TADF-emitter is demonstrated in Fig. 7.

Two alternately conjugated green-TADF polymers PAPCC and PAPTC were synthesized by Cheng's group (Scheme 10).27 The backbone of the polymers contains the donor carbazole and 9,10-dihydroacridine derivative units, and the phenyls containing the electron-withdrawing cyano or triazine were connected through the nitrogen atom of 9,10-dihydroacridine. GPC studies revealed that PAPCC and PAPTC both exhibit a high Mw of 38.56 kDa and 65.12 kDa, respectively. ΔEST calculated for PAPCC and PAPTC is 0.37 eV and 0.13 eV, respectively, in toluene. The rather small ΔEST for PAPTC is attributed to the twisted geometry. In particular, τDF was observed to be very short, being 0.50 μs for PAPCC and 0.68 μs for PAPTC in the film state. Both polymers display high PLQYs of 100% in the solution (toluene) as well as in the film state. The resulting non-doped devices based on PAPTC display superior performance, with a maximum EQE of 12.6% (CIE coordinates of (0.30, 0.59)), while PAPCC is limited to only 1.3% (CIE coordinates of (0.25, 0.47)). The superiority in the performance of PAPTC can be deduced from its higher PLQY and smaller ΔEST. In particular, PAPTC shows a very low turn-on voltage of only 2.6 V at a luminance of 1 cd m−2 owing to its higher HOMO energy level (−5.33 eV), which reduces the hole injection barrier. Subsequently, they tuned the backbone structure and replaced the tert-butyls with the phenyls of PAPTC to develop a series of green-emitting polymers PCzATD1, PCzATD5, PCzATD10, and PCzATD25 (Scheme 10).71 The replacement of the tert-butyl groups with the phenyl rings of triazine leads to a rigid geometry, which can enable TADF characteristics. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) values of these polymers are between 5.7 kDa and 10.6 kDa, and the polydispersity index (PDI) is in the range 2.0–2.3. The ΔEST values were calculated to be 0.08, 0.09, 0.12, and 0.14 eV for PCzATD1, PCzATD5, PCzATD10, and PCzATD25, respectively. The total PLQYs of PCzATD1–PCzATD25 are 90%, 89%, 87%, and 65%, respectively, in the neat film. The τPF and τDF values are in the ranges 25.2–29.0 ns and 1.0–1.4 μs, respectively, in the film state at RT. The non-doped OLEDs obtained by using PCzATD1 as the emitter show a maximum EQE of 14.6% (CIE coordinates of (0.39, 0.55)), whereas PCzATD5 shows a 15.5% EQE (CIE coordinates of (0.41, 0.55)), PCzATD10 a 14.7% EQE (CIE coordinates of (0.43, 0.54)), and PCzATD25 a 12.6% EQE (CIE coordinates of (0.46, 0.52)). Furthermore, advanced two-component host structures containing mCP as the main-host and DMAC-DPS as the sensitized TADF host were fabricated for PCzATD5. Such mCP:DMAC-DPS:PCzATD5 devices with a 7:1:2 ratio show similar performance, with an EQE of 16.0%, without displaying any mCP or DMAC-DPS emission. The non-doped devices show low turn-on voltages that are in the range 2.53–2.66 V, while those for the doped devices are in the range 2.61–2.84 V. The same group then turned their attention towards the pendant triazine unit in PCzATD polymers, which was replaced with benzophenone to achieve a new series of PABPC50, PABPC25, PABPC10, PABPC5, PABPC1, and PABPC0.5 green/yellow polymers (Scheme 10).72 The ΔEST values calculated in toluene are between 0.09 eV and 0.18 eV. The absolute PLQY values are in the range of 58–77% in the film state. The non-doped OLEDs of these polymers show maximum EQEs in the range 6.8–18.1%. Among these, PABPC5 exhibits not only a high EQE of 18.1%, but also this high value is retained at 17.8% at 1000 cd m−2, 15.9% at 5000 cd m−2, and 13.8% at 10000 cd m−2, which demonstrates that PABPC5 simultaneously displays high-efficiency and low-efficiency roll-off behavior at extremely high brightness. Further, the PABPC5 device maintains a low turn-on voltage of only 2.6 V.
Cheng's group also demonstrated the orange/red emitting TDAF polymers PFSOTT0.05, PFSOTT0.1, PFSOTT0.5, PFSOTT1, PFSOTT2, PFSOTT5, and PFSOTT10 (Scheme 10). These polymers consisted of alternating fluorene (F) and dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (SO) units through the diphenylamino fragment of 2-(4-(diphenylamino)-phenyl)-9H-thioxanthen-9-one-10,10-dioxide, with the thioxanthen-9H-one-10,10-dioxide segment as the pendant group.73 In toluene, PFSOTT2–PFSOTT10 having a higher content of the TADF unit shows dual emission, with a high intensity emission peak at 405 nm that originates from the backbone and a weak emission peak at 584 nm that can be attributed to the TADF unit. However, the polymers with a lower content of the TADF unit (PFSOTT0.05–PFSOTT1) reveal only a single peak around 405 nm, because of inefficient intramolecular energy transfer. In contrast, the neat film PL spectra of PFSOTT0.05–PFSOTT1 demonstrate more pronounced dual emission with almost comparable intensities, which is due to effective energy transfer in the condensed films. The intensity of the orange emission gradually enhances with increasing content of the TADF unit in the polymers, which represents enhanced energy-transfer from the backbone to the TADF unit. The PLQY values are rather high, in the range 38–89%, in the film state. The non-doped OLEDs show poor performance, with the maximum EQEs being in the range 0.3–4.8%. Interestingly, PFSOTT0.05 and PFSOTT0.1 simultaneously emit in the blue (438/440 nm; from the backbone) and orange (590/592 nm; from the TADF unit) regions. As a result, the CIE coordinates of the two polymers are (0.32, 0.31) and (0.36, 0.36), respectively, which match well with those of pure white light. Moreover, the high-performing PFSOTT2 was implemented in doped OLEDs by using mCP as the host, which accomplished a maximum EQE of 19.4% (a 40:60 ratio) and the emission peak wavelength was 592 nm. Regarding the doped devices of the remaining polymers, some of them show a red-shift, whereas a few of them emit cold white light. The PL and EL spectra of the polymers are displayed in Fig. 8.

Ren's group demonstrated a series of green/yellow copolymers comprised of similar TADF pendant groups by altering the electron-transporting phosphine oxide (POPT13, POPT25, and POPT41) or hole-transporting carbazole (PCzPT10, PCzPT19, and PCzPT43) spacers and their ratios (Scheme 10).74 The Mw values were determined to be in the range 11.7–15.9 kDa for the PCzPT-x series and 11.9–96.8 kDa for the POPT-x series. The PCzPT-x and POPT-x series possess ΔEST values in the ranges 0.05–0.07 eV and 0.09–0.13 eV, respectively. The ΔEST value and the content of the TADF unit in the polymers are inversely proportional to each other. The PLQYs of the POPT-x series are between 31 and 52% in toluene, which is larger than that of the PCzPT-x series (18–25%). The non-doped OLEDs of all the polymers realize very poor performance, with maximum EQEs in the range 0.31–0.86% and the maximum luminance being only 1084 cd m−2; the high turn-on voltages observed may be attributed to the severe annihilation of excitons in the TADF copolymers. The doped devices of the PCzPT-x series reveal similar performance to the non-doped devices (EQEs of 0.6–1.2%), while the POPT devices realize moderately good results, with EQEs in the range 3.5–5.2%. Among these, POPT-25 shows the best performance, with a 5.2% EQE, because of the highest PLQY, which indicates that the proper selection of monomers and their molar ratios is quite crucial to realizing high performance.
The novel concept of “charge-transfer through-space” was introduced and used to develop blue-TADF polymers (P-Ac95-TRZ5, PAc50-TRZ50, P-TBAc95-TRZ05, and PTBAc50-TRZ50), containing non-conjugated polyethylene backbones, by L. Wang et al. (Scheme 10).28 9,9-Dimethyl-10-phenyl-acridan (Ac) or 9,9-bis(1,3-di-tert-butylphenyl)-10-phenyl-acridan (TBAc) was selected as the pendant electron donor and TRZ as the pendant electron acceptor. The synthesized polymers achieve typical Mn of 30–100 kDa, with PDI of 1.70–2.50. P-Ac50-TRZ50 and P-Ac95-TRZ05 exhibit a ΔEST of 0.019 eV and 0.021 eV, respectively. Simple Ac-based emitters exhibit high PLQYs (up to 60%) compared to the TBAc derivatives (PLQYs of only 9%), because of the steric tert-butyls that restrict the charge-transfer through-space and TADF phenomenon. Among the Ac polymers, particularly PAc50-TRZ50 shows more red-shifted emission than the corresponding monomeric pendant groups, and the PL spectra are much more sensitive to the polarity of the solvent, while the TBAc polymers display similar behavior to the TRZ entity, which suggests that Ac polymers can predominantly exhibit CT behavior, while TBAc polymers cannot. Moreover, transient PL studies reveal that the Ac polymers possess both PF and DF lifetimes, while the TBAc polymers exhibit only PF lifetimes, which further confirmed the fact that only Ac polymers can show TADF behavior. Consequently, the non-doped OLEDs of P-Ac50-TRZ50, P-Ac95-TRZ5, P-TBAc50-TRZ50, and PTBAc95-TRZ5 reveal maximum EQEs of 3.1%, 12.1%, 0.21%, and 0.33%, respectively. Among these, P-Ac95-TRZ5 achieves the highest performance, with a maximum EQE of 12.1% that is maintained at 12.0% at 100 cd m−2 and 11.5% at 1000 cd m−2, which suggests small efficiency roll-off behavior. Indeed, P-Ac95-TRZ5 shows more blue-shifted emission at 472 nm (CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.27)) than PAc50-TRZ50 (497 nm; CIE coordinates of (0.22, 0.43)), and the TBAC polymers exhibit complicated EL emission. The physically blended devices of Ac and TRZ show poor performance, with EQEs of up to only 1.92%, demonstrating the importance of a single molecule emitter over a doped system. These polymers show that the phenomenon of charge-transfer through-space is more advantageous than charge-transfer through-bonds, particularly for the development of blue-emitting materials.
5. Conclusion
Undoubtedly, TADF OLEDs are the best alternatives in terms of device performance compared to conventional fluorescent OLEDs, which are limited to maximum external quantum efficiencies of only 5%, and in the aspect of cost compared to highly expensive PhOLEDs. Though many TADF OLEDs have realized EQEs above 30% in all three primary colors, almost all of them involve dispersion in a suitable host material to circumvent concentration quenching and triplet–triplet annihilation. The host–guest dopant ratio plays a crucial role in realizing high device performance. However, it is highly difficult to precisely control the dopant concentration, particularly in thermally deposited devices. The host–guest blend systems experience phase separation, which hampers the device performance at a high luminance, which is another demerit of the doped systems. In addition, the host material in the doped devices decides not only the overall device performance, but also the color purity; hence, careful selection of the host is needed.
To alleviate these disadvantages, the development of non-doped emitters is the best alternative. Many efforts have been made in this regard and a variety of non-doped emitters have been reported. The non-doped emitters are designed with simple structures such as small molecules or else small molecule emitters encapsulated with a suitable host part to make them dendrimers. In principle, to design TADF dendrimers different generations of carbazole dendrons, as the host part, are connected to the TADF core through direct linkage or by using an alkyl spacer to retain their essential properties. Carbazole dendrons as the host part are particularly attractive because of the high triplet energy and high hole mobility. To design non-doped TADF polymers, a TADF emitter has been embedded into a polymer backbone or grafted as a side chain. The non-doped TADF emitters with AIE properties have significant importance in OLED applications, not only to achieve high performance, but also to maintain low efficiency roll-off at practical brightness, because AIE luminogens give unique advantages such as decreased nonradiative decay, and suppressed aggregation-caused quenching and exciton annihilation in their aggregated state. However, further research progress in non-doped OLEDs is still needed to reach the performance of doped devices. In this context, this review will be helpful to researchers in designing a variety of non-doped emitters with superior performance.
