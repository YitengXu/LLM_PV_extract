The morphology, crystal structure, chemical state, and optical properties of the TiO2 film were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. The results showed that the film had a unique lower layer DWNT/upper layer coral structure with a mixed phase of anatase and rutile. The XPS results proved that the interstitial nitrogen atoms doped in the TiO2 crystal lattice as a Ti–O–N bond.

1. Introduction
In recent years, TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs) have been extensively used in solar cell devices, photocatalysis (PC), sensors, and energy storage because of their large specific surface area, stability in aqueous solution, and potential photoelectric conversion efficiency.1,2 The first generation of TNTs was produced in a hydrogen fluoride (HF) aqueous solution.3,4 The second generation of TNTs was produced in salt solutions containing fluorine, such as ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and sodium fluoride.5 In the third generation of TNTs, the electrolyte was replaced with organic solutions (ethylene glycol,6 dimethyl sulfoxide,7 and glycerol8) containing fluoride ions. Compared with the first and second generation of TNTs, the third generation of TNTs is relatively smooth and ordered and their length can be easily controlled.
However, a serious problem that restricts the application of TNTs is that they absorb only UV light because of their wide band gap (3.2 eV for anatase). Nonmetals, such as C, N, S, B, and F, have been successfully doped into TNTs to reduce the wide band gap, thereby enhancing the absorption of visible light.9–11 Moreover, the sensitization of TNTs with a narrow band gap semiconductor (CdS, Bi2S3, CdSe, CuS, and WO3)12,13 facilitates the injection of electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of TNTs. Moreover, loading precious metal nanoparticles (Pt, Au, Pd, and Ag) on the surface of TNTs14–16 is beneficial to suppress the recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs as an electron capture agent. Recently, new electrolyte systems have been developed to obtain TiO2 films with a novel geometrical morphology. Cabbage-like and baleen-like structures with high photocurrent have been successfully fabricated in HCl, H2O2, and ethylene glycol electrolytes.17
Ionic liquids (ILs) are not only good solvents but also suitable electrolytes for the electrochemical reaction because of their strong electrical conductivity and wide electrochemical window.18 At present, ILs have been used as templates and catalysts to prepare TiO2 nanoparticles with a larger specific surface area, enhanced light absorption, and higher photocatalytic activity.19–21 Although the use of ILs as electrolytes to prepare TNTs has been reported,22–24 ILs have not received considerable attention.
In the present study, we report a coral/double-wall nanotube array (coral/DWNTs) TiO2 film prepared via anodic oxidation in an ultrasonic bath in an organic electrolyte containing 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF4]) and ethylene glycol, followed by a rapid annealing process. The morphology, crystalline phase, chemical structure, and optical absorption of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film were investigated. In addition, the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activity of the film was evaluated via methyl orange (MO) degradation.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Morphology and crystal structure
The coral/DWNT TiO2 film was synthesized by a modified anodic oxidation in a [BMIM][BF4] containing electrolyte at 60 V for 20 min, followed by a rapid annealing process at 500 °C. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the film has a unique hierarchical structure. The upper layer contains many nanoholes and resembles corals, and the lower layer is composed of polygonal double-wall nanotubes (DWNTs) (inset of Fig. 1(a)). Fig. 1(b) shows the STEM image. The total thickness of the film is 286 nm. The average lengths of the upper layer coral structure, middle layer DWNTs and lower layer oxidation film between DWNTs and the Ti substrate are approximately 44 nm, 200 nm, and 42 nm, respectively. These DWNTs exhibit a uniform size small at both ends and big in the middle. The average diameter is 125 nm at the top of DWNTs and 177 nm in the middle, respectively, and the double-wall thickness is about 60 nm. What's more, the inner tubes are built by a nano-porous structure. In contrast to the single wall TNTs synthesized in the traditional NH4F electrolyte at 60 V for 20 min (Fig. S1, ESI†), the coral/DWNT TiO2 film has a larger specific surface area. Fig. 1(c) reveals that the film has a mixed phase of anatase and rutile. d-spacings of 3.25 Å and 2.49 Å correspond to the (110) plane and the (101) plane of rutile TiO2, respectively, and 3.51 Å corresponds to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2.

The growth process of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The coral/DWNT TiO2 film was fabricated in an ultrasonic bath in an organic electrolyte containing [BMIM][BF4]. [BF4]− is less aggressive than F−.25 As such, the upper layer can be chemically stable in the [BF4]− electrolyte. In the anodization process, the inconsistent degree of etch on the surface results in a coral structure that is self-organized on the upper layer, which is more conducive to the capture of light and improves the utilization rate of light.26 During the process, [BF4]−via the reaction can produce F−, which is a necessary factor for the growth of TNTs.2,27 Previous studies have indicated that the formation of DWNTs is relative to the dihydrate orientation of titanium hydroxide.28 The dihydrate orientation of the lower layer is vertical to the TNTs and formed smooth DWNTs.

Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film on the Ti substrate at different annealing temperatures from 400 to 700 °C. The as-anodized coral/DWNT TiO2 film was amorphous. Notably, the film has a mixed phase after annealing at 500 °C for 2 h, which is in good accordance with the result of HRTEM shown in Fig. 1(c). The mass fraction of anatase and rutile is approximately 2.4:1. In general, the transition temperature of the anatase to rutile phase is approximately 600 °C.29,30 The presence of ILs possibly promotes the transformation of anatase to rutile at low temperatures. The intensity of the anatase and rutile peaks decreased and increased, respectively, and the mass fraction of the two phases is approximately 0.7:1 when the temperature was increased to 600 °C. For the sample calcined at 700 °C, a totally rutile phase was observed. The sharp diffraction peaks indicate that the film has a high crystallinity. Detailed parameters of coral/DWNT TiO2 film at different annealing temperatures are listed in Table 1.

2.2. Chemical state analysis
The chemical states of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film annealed at 500 °C were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The film contains Ti, O, C, and N elements (Fig. 3(a)). The atomic ratio of Ti/O is 1:2.4, which is slightly higher than the stoichiometric ratio. The absorbed oxygen at the surface of the film is responsible for the excess O element.31 The atomic percentage of N is 4.54%, which is derived from ILs. The N 1s peak at approximately 400 eV is ascribed to the interstitial nitrogen atoms doped in the TiO2 lattice as a Ti–O–N bond (Fig. 3(b)).32 This is further confirmed by XPS spectra of Ti 2p and O 1s between the coral/DWNT TiO2 film and undoped TNTs (Fig. 3(c) and (d)). The Ti 2p3/2, Ti 2p1/2 and O 1s peaks are located at 458.5 eV, 464.3 eV and 530.2 eV for the undoped TNTs, respectively. While for the coral/DWNT TiO2 film, these peaks shift to 458.1 eV, 463.8 eV and 529.4 eV, respectively. The introduction of N atoms into the TiO2 lattice can lead to the shifts of the binding energies of Ti 2p and O 1s to lower binding energies.33,34 The C element existing on the film surface is derived from adventitious carbon contaminants or residual organic carbons. As such, the XPS data are not shown.

2.3. Optical absorption
UV-Vis absorption spectra are obtained to assess the optical absorption of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Ti foil, TNTs, and coral/DWNT TiO2 film show better absorption in the UV light region, especially for TNTs. However, the coral/DWNT TiO2 film shows a strong absorption in the visible light region. The band gap energy was determined from the (αhν)2versus photon energy curve (Fig. 4(b)). The band gap energy of TNTs is 3.2 eV, which is the intrinsic value of the anatase TiO2. The coral/DWNT TiO2 film shows a red shift, and the band gap decreases from 3.2 eV to 3.11 eV. Moreover, the coral/DWNT TiO2 film has an extrinsic band gap energy of 2.08 eV. First, the red shift and extrinsic band gap energy are attributed to the doped interstitial N atoms, which introduce impurity levels above the valence band,35 thereby reducing the excitation energy and facilitating the absorption of visible light. Second, the rapid annealing process caused lattice disorder in TiO2,36,37 which is beneficial to N doping in the form of the interstitial atom because the lattice structure was twisted. Third, the mixed phase enhanced the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs.38 Finally, the specific layered architecture significantly improved the utilization efficiency of incident light.

2.4. PEC degradation
The PEC activity of coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrodes was evaluated via MO degradation under sunlight (the illumination intensity of sunlight and outside temperature, see Table 2). For coral/DWNT TiO2 film and TNT electrodes, the decolorization efficiency can reach 85% and 56% after 150 min, while the TOC removal can reach only 59% and 30%, respectively (Fig. 5(a)). The TOC removal rates were obviously lower than the decolorization rates of MO. The results indicated that the breakage of chromophores was dominant at the initial stage. Some intermediates were generated in the decomposition of MO, and would take long time for its mineralization process. The PEC process fits a pseudo-first-order kinetic model (Fig. 5(b)). The kinetic constant of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrode is 2.17 times that of TNTs (Table 3).

The decolorization efficiency of MO in different processes, such as direct photolysis (DP), photocatalysis (PC), electrocatalysis (EC), and photoelectrocatalysis (PEC), was also evaluated for coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrodes (Fig. 5(c)). The decolorization of a MO solution in the DP process is almost negligible. Only 11.4% and 7.4% of MO were removed in the PC and EC processes, respectively. The decolorization efficiency of the PEC process can reach 85%, which is much higher than the summation of the DP, PC, and EC processes. This finding indicates that a strong synergetic effect exists between the PC and EC processes in MO degradation. These decolorization processes can be described as a first-order kinetic model, except for the DP process (Fig. 5(d)). Evidently, the kinetic constant of PEC is approximately 15 and 23 times higher than those of PC and EC, respectively (Table 3). The results further confirm that the light and electricity do have synergistic effects on the degradation processes. The photo-generated electron can be rapidly transferred by external bias voltage, which results in the separation of photo-excited electron–hole pairs efficiently. Consequently, the photoelectrocatalytic efficiency can be improved greatly.
Moreover, the unique layer structure increased the specific surface area of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film. The large surface area can provide more adsorptive and active sites. Meanwhile, the large surface area can enhance visible light absorption, which can promote the generation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. Based on the reasons previously discussed, the coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrodes exhibit excellent PEC activity.
3. Conclusions
In this work, a unique coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrode with a mixed phase of anatase and rutile was prepared. The coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrode shows strong absorption in the visible region and higher photoelectrocatalytic activity under sunlight. The synergetic effect of the interstitial N atom doping and disordered structure caused by the mixed phase as well as the large surface area make the coral/DWNT TiO2 film exhibit enhanced visible light photoelectrocatalytic efficiency. This work provides a feasible strategy to develop more powerful photosensitive photocatalysts.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
Ti foils (purity of 99.9%, thickness and size of 0.3 × 30 × 40 mm) were purchased from Baoji Jinbu Titanium Equipment Corporation, China. Graphite rod (99.9%) was purchased from Shanghai Zichen Corporation, China. [BMIM][BF4] was purchased from Lanzhou. Ethylene glycol, glycerine, absolute ethyl alcohol, NH4F, acetone, HNO3, HF, NaCl, and MO were purchased from National Medicines Chemical Corporation, China. All of the chemicals were of analytical grade, and deionized water was used in all experiments.
4.2. Preparation of coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrodes
Coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrodes were prepared via anodic oxidation in an ultrasonic bath in ILs, followed by a rapid annealing process. Ti foils were polished using abrasive papers and degreased in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min by using acetone, anhydrous ethanol, and distilled water. Thereafter, the Ti foils were chemically etched in mixed solution of HF/HNO3/H2O (1:4:5 v/v/v) for 30 s39 and then rinsed with deionized water. The Ti foil was used as the anode and the graphite rod was used as the cathode in the electrolyte (0.6 wt% [BMIM][BF4]–10 vol% H2O–EG). During the anodic oxidation process, a constant voltage of 60 V was applied to the two electrodes at a distance of 4 cm by a direct current power supply (HB172000SL 3A, Hong Bao Electric Group Co., Ltd, Shanghai). Anodic oxidation was conducted at an ultrasonic power of 480 W (KH-800KDE, Kunshan Hechuang Ultrasonic Instrument Co., Ltd, Jiangsu) for 20 min at room temperature. The sample was rinsed with distilled water, dried, and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in a muffle oven.
4.3. Characterization
The morphology of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrode was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4800). Focused ion beam (FIB) technology was used to prepare a cross-section sample to observe the microstructure of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a Tecnai F20 (FEI Company) operating at 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using a PANalytical X'pert Pro MPD, with a Cu Kα radiation source of wavelength λ = 0.1541 nm and a scanning rate of 0.0334° s−1 in the range from 20° to 90°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a Kratos Axis Ultra apparatus (Shimadzu Co. Japan). UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded in the range of 200 nm to 800 nm by using the UV-3150 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co. Japan).
4.4. PEC degradation experiments
The PEC activities of the coral/DWNT TiO2 film electrode were evaluated via MO degradation under sunlight. The coral/DNT TiO2 film electrode was used as the working electrode and the graphite rod was used as the counter electrode. The initial concentration of MO was 20 mg L−1, with a pH value of approximately 6.8 and a working volume of 40 mL. A bias potential of 2 V was applied to the two electrodes (the tests for choosing bias potential are shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1, ESI†). NaCl was chosen as the electrolyte at a concentration of 0.5 M. MO solution (1 mL) was used every 30 min to measure the absorbance at 464 nm via UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy (UV-3000). The MO decolorization efficiency (D%) and the first-order rate constant (K) were calculated as follows: (1) (2)where C0 (mg L−1) and Ct (mg L−1) are the MO concentration at time 0 and t (min), respectively.
The total organic carbon (TOC) was determined using a TOC analyzer (TOC-V CPH, Shimadzu). TOC removal was calculated using the following equation. TOC removal (%) = (TOC0 − TOCt)/TOC0 × 100(3) where TOC0 (mg L−1) and TOCt (mg L−1) are the initial concentration of total organic carbon and its remaining concentration of total organic carbon after reaction, respectively.
