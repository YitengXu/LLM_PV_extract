    , Accepted 23rd April 2015First published on 27th April 2015AbstractA group of dyes derived from coumarin was studied, which consisted of nine molecules using a very similar manufacturing process of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Optimized geometries, energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and ultraviolet-visible spectra were obtained using theoretical calculations, and they were also compared with experimental conversion efficiencies of the DSSC. The representation of an excited state in terms of natural transition orbitals (NTOs) was studied. Chemical reactivity parameters were calculated and correlated with the experimental data linked to the efficiency of the DSSC. A new proposal was obtained to design new molecular systems and to predict their potential use as a dye in DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) promise to convert solar light to electricity more cheaply than silicon cells1,2 and with greater energy conversion efficiencies (η);3–6 however, so far the DSSC has achieved only efficiencies of 15% using perovskite sensitized solar cells7 and 12% using ruthenium based complex dyes.8 Metal free organic dyes have shown an outstanding advance in few years with regard to conversion efficiency, such as coumarin derivative dyes up to 8%9,10 and triphenylamine based dyes up to 10%5 using the I−/I3− electrolyte. Recently, organic dyes have achieved higher conversion efficiencies up to 12.5% using carbazole11 and indenoperylene12 electron-donor based dyes and up to 12.8% using a triphenylamine based dye13 using the cobalt complex based electrolyte. Metal free organic dyes are the most advantageous because of their easy design and synthesis, and low cost;14,15 further, it demonstrates more possibilities for improving the efficiency. Hence the study and the understanding of the performance of metal free organic dyes are very important, and a useful and fast methodology for efficiency prediction is important as well. In this way, theoretical studies can effectively support the experimental research. In this sense, several organic dyes have been studied theoretically and experimentally, such as those based on triphenylamine16–19 and coumarin.20–26 Hara et al.9,27–30 have developed coumarin dyes that have been utilized as photosensitizers in dye sensitized solar cells that have reached high conversion efficiencies up to 8%.9 On the other hand, the conversion efficiency depends on the used dye31,32 in the DSSC. Several researchers25,33–37 have carried out theoretical studies regarding NKX coumarin derivatives and have attempted to understand the relationship between the molecular properties and the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSC. Some propose the necessity of using dye–TiO2 complexes for correctly predicting the mechanism in the DSSC such as charge transfer or recombination; nevertheless, the relationship of chemical reactivity of the dye with experimental data has not been studied for this group of molecules. Hence, a group of coumarin molecules was chosen for this study. This group was formed by different dyes evaluated in solar cells that were built and studied using a very similar construction process. The molecules used for this study (C343, NKX-2398, NKX-2388, NKX-2311, NKX-2586, NKX-2753, NKX-2593, NKX-2807, and NKX-2883) are shown in Fig. 1. The aim of this study was to calculate theoretical molecular properties and the chemical reactivity in order to compare and correlate with experimental data, such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and energy conversion efficiency (η). Our goal was to obtain a methodology for the efficient selection of donor–π linker–acceptor (D–π–A) type dyes.

2. Calculation details
A theoretical study has been carried out using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP38 and PBE039 hybrid GGA functionals and the M0640 hybrid meta-GGA functional combined with two basis sets: 6-31G(d)41,42 proposed by Pople and MIDIY43 developed by the Truhlar group at the University of Minnesota. Furthermore, the CAM-B3LYP44 range-separated hybrid functional was used with 6-31G(d). Ground state geometry optimization, energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and chemical reactivity parameters were obtained. Chemical reactivity parameters were obtained by energy calculations (ionic and neutral states).45,46 Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra were calculated in ethanol using the time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) with the non-equilibrium protocol47,48 and were processed using the Swizard program49,50 and the Gaussian model to read the oscillator strength (f) and the orbitals involved in the electron transition. A possible improvement to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of the electron transition is based on the representation of an excited state in terms of natural transition orbitals (NTOs).51 By performing a singular value decomposition of the transition density matrix, one may express the excited state as a transition from occupied to virtual NTO. The equations were solved for 20 excited states, and the solvent effect was considered using the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM),52 an implicit method. All levels calculated were similar with exception of CAM-B3LYP, but PBE0/MIDIY, PBE0/6-31G(d) and M06/6-31G(d) presented the most accurate results. Other theoretical models (M06/MIDIY, B3LYP/6-31G[d], B3LYP/MIDIY and CAM-B3LYP/6-31G[d]) are available in the ESI.† Values of maximum wavelength (λmax) and its electron transition were compared for different experimental efficiencies as well as the difference in energy between the dye LUMO and the TiO2 semiconductor conduction band. Furthermore, molecular properties and the chemical reactivity were correlated with experimental data, such as short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and light conversion efficiency. Pearson correlations and P values were calculated to choose the best correlation. All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 Revision D.01.53
3. Results and discussions
The maximum absorption wavelength (nm), the oscillator strength, the electron transition, and the HOMO and LUMO were studied and analyzed to choose the best molecule to be used in DSSCs. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation was calculated to obtain relationships between the chemical reactivity and the experimental results of conversion efficiency. The latter were reported by the group of Hara28–30 and are shown in Table 1. All levels of theory used describe similarly and the calculated molecular properties exhibit the same trend, with exception of CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d). Therefore, only the most approximate level to experimental maximum wavelengths is shown here, M06/6-31G(d). Other theoretical models can be found in the ESI.†

3.1 Ultraviolet-visible spectra
The values of theoretical and experimental maximum wavelengths are shown in Table 2 for comparison. Considering all the systems studied, for shorter molecules (without a π bridge) and longer molecules (with a larger π bridge), the M06 functional presents the best alternative according to the levels of calculation proposed here. It is mainly interesting to obtain the UV-vis spectra with good accuracy, which can be resolved using functionals with minor and major Hartree Fock (HF) exchange according to the study reported by Dev et al.54 A good option could be M06-L and M06-2X for shorter and longer molecules, respectively. In this case, we need to use only a functional to compare suitably the absorption theoretical data among the different molecules.

The theoretical ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the nine coumarin derivative dyes obtained at the M06/6-31G(d) level of theory are shown in Fig. 2. It was observed that more redshifted maximum wavelength corresponded to better experimental conversion efficiency, excluding NKX-2586 and NKX-2807. The above observation is due to the value of λmax, which is related to the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. Generally, when a dye absorbs closer to red where the energy of light is minor, the LUMO energy level is more negative; therefore, it is closer to the TiO2 conduction band.55 On the other hand, it was observed that the molecules with a λmax above 400 nm had a similar experimental efficiency; this region coincides with the area of greatest solar radiation.56–58 In this study, it is important to emphasize that all signals of maximum wavelengths (λmax) correspond to HOMO to LUMO (H → L) transitions, which are shown in Table 3. Furthermore there were other signals blueshifted with transitions involving different orbitals such as HOMO−1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO+1 that also contributed to light harvesting. Some authors consider the value of f (using the LHE: light harvesting efficiency) to be directly proportional to the Jsc in order to predict the molecule with the best efficiency;19,37,59,60 however, in molecules having several signals of absorption involved in harvesting and energy transfer, it is very difficult to select the best molecule with this criterion.

3.2 Energy levels of the molecular orbitals
In relation to the absorption spectral analysis and the electron transitions between the orbitals, it is important to observe the HOMO, HOMO−1, LUMO, and LUMO+1 energy levels that are shown in Fig. 3; these are the orbitals involved in such electron transitions. It is known that in a dye the position of the LUMO level must be above the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.0 eV),61 and the HOMO level should be below the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte (−4.8 eV)61 to allow for charge injection from the dye to TiO2 as well as the regeneration of the dye that receives electrons from the electrolyte. It can be observed that all molecules are suitable candidates as photosensitizers. Furthermore, a general tendency was noted that a lower LUMO energy level resulted generally in higher conversion efficiency, excluding NKX-2586 and NKX-2807. If NKX-2311 and NKX-2753 are compared, the first has a more negative LUMO level and a lower efficiency than the latter, but NKX-2753 has a minor band gap, and may require the HOMO level closer to the redox potential than NKX-2311, allowing a better efficiency. On the other hand, the DSSC with NKX-2753 received a treatment of TiCl4 in TiO2 that creates a slightly higher efficiency. NKX-2807 and NKX-2883 also were measured in DSSCs that received the aforementioned treatment. Despite the fact that NKX-2807 has a lower LUMO level than NKX-2883, it has a lower efficiency. However, it can be observed that both LUMO levels were very similar, and NKX-2883 has the HOMO level closer to the redox potential; therefore, there is a lower band gap. Also, it presented a second transition HOMO → LUMO+1 and HOMO−1 → LUMO with a smaller band gap than NKX-2807, which also contributes to light harvesting.
 Fig. 3  Orbital energy levels of coumarin derivative dyes at the M06/6-31G(d) level of calculation. 
Mapping of HOMO and LUMO orbitals is important for observing charge separation; hence, it was obtained and analyzed as shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that all molecules present a charge distribution similar to a photosensitizer,62 namely, the HOMO density was mostly concentrated in the coumarin donor region, while the LUMO density was mostly concentrated in the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor region where the TiO2 semiconductor is attached. Furthermore, as the π bridge was increased using vinylene chains, thiophene or phenyl, a better charge separation was obtained, although there is still an overlap of orbitals. Moreover, the NKX-2311 and NKX-2586 molecules were compared, and despite the fact that both have qualitatively the same HOMO and LUMO charge distribution, NKX-2311 presented a higher efficiency. Besides, NKX-2586 was more redshifted and nearer to the TiO2 conduction band than NKX-2311; therefore, theoretically NKX-2586 was estimated to be the best among them; however, Hara28 and co-workers reported that NKX-2586 had a low efficiency due to its aggregation on TiO2, according to the experimental results. Due to the above, NKX-2586 was considered to be an exception in our methodology of study.
 Fig. 4  HOMO and LUMO molecular orbitals at the M06/6-31G(d) level of calculation. 
Moreover, in the study of NKX-2807,30 Hara and co-workers expected a higher efficiency for this dye, for example, compared with NKX-2593, but this was not the case because NKX-2807 had a lower IPCE (incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency) that was related to the driving force of electron injection (the difference between the LUMO and the TiO2 conduction band edge). These researchers expected that a molecule with higher electron-withdrawing ability had higher conversion efficiency (η) and hypothesized that “the electrons first move from the donor part to the –CN group linked to the π-conjugation bridge, upon excitation, and then move to the ending acceptor part (i.e., cyanoacrylic acid)”. In this case, the problem was that the CN group attached to NKX-2593 (in the π bridge before thiophene) to obtain NKX-2807 increased the electron-withdrawing ability, but it was concentrated partly in this group and partly in cyanoacrylic acid as shown in Fig. 4. Hence the CN group perhaps interrupted the charge transfer instead of serving as a springboard. This leads to the idea that a dye need to have mainly the LUMO orbital in the anchor group instead of the π bridge as in the case of NKX-2807 that has a structure of D–A–π–A; note that it was seen that adding CN did not lead to a good result. NKX-2883 also has a D–A–π–A structure; however, the –CN group is more separated from the cyanoacrylic acid. Therefore, the LUMO was not concentrated in this group.
The nature of the first excited state can be determined by analyzing the corresponding NTOs (Fig. 5). As expected, the results for the transition of the most intense band are consistent with the HOMO and LUMO orbitals shown in Fig. 4. The excitation promotes an electron from an orbital that is dominant in the coumarin donor region to the one that is localized on the anchoring group (cyanoacrylic acid); the transition can be entirely described as electron removal from the occupied NTO (“hole” density) and electron accumulation into the virtual NTO (“particle” density). Orbital separation is more evident when the π bridge increases in size.

Electron Density Difference Maps (EDDMs) for the first excited singlet state at the M06/6-31G(d) level of theory is included in the ESI† (Fig. S3). The EDDMs show the changes in electron density for a given excitation, where the electron density loss in the excitation is represented in cyan, and the purple color indicates the electron density gain.
3.3 Chemical reactivity and correlation study
Using the molecular energies of the ionic and neutral species, the following chemical reactivity parameters were calculated (in eV): electron affinity (A), ionization potential (I), chemical hardness (h), electrophilicity index (ω), electron donating power (ω−), and electron accepting power (ω+). The values are shown in Table 4.

Mainly, chemical hardness is an important parameter that represents the resistance to intramolecular charge transfer;45,63 hence, a lower chemical hardness is desired. Fig. 6 shows a graph of chemical hardness (Table 4) and experimental efficiency (Table 1) of each coumarin molecule. It can be observed that the conversion efficiency increases, while the chemical hardness decreases. Exceptions again are NKX-2586 and NKX-2807, as explained above.
 Fig. 6  Chemical hardness and experimental efficiency of coumarin molecules. 
On the basis of the above results, we thought of performing calculations of Pearson correlation coefficients between the chemical reactivity and experimental efficiency parameters shown in Table 5, excluding the exception molecules NKX-2586 and NKX-2807. Taking into account that the Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship among two quantitative random variables, and if P value < 0.05 is obtained, it can be assumed that there really is a strength in association between the two variables.64 We used the method above to find a relationship between the theoretical molecular properties and the experimental results that could predict new D–π–A molecular systems. Furthermore, the strengh oscillator (f) and the driving force of electron injection (inject) were correlated. Electron affinity and ionization potential were not discussed since these are used for obtaining the rest of the chemical reactivity and can be redundant. An important aim was to consider a group of D–π–A dyes used in DSSCs with the same conditions of manufacture and measurements. The aim is to obtain a reliable comparison among them, althougth the number of molecules is small, therefore the results should be taken into account with caution. Despite the fact that only seven data were correlated, good results were obtained, namely, the chemical reactivity and the driving force of electron injection have an effect on the parameters of efficiency. For example, chemical hardness has an excellent correlation with the η (−0.977), Jsc (−0.960), and driving force of electron injection (0.955); furthermore, it had P values near zero: 0.001, 0.001 and 0.000, respectively. The effect of the theoretical results in each experimental datum can be analyzed. For example, the Jsc was inversely proportional correlated with chemical harness (−0.960, P = 0.001) and inject (−0.923, P = 0.003); this means that the best Jsc is obtained when the chemical hardness and the inject are smaller. The smaller inject corresponds to a LUMO energy level that is nearer to the TiO2 conduction band. Besides, Jsc presented an excellent positive correlation with electrophilicity (0.912, P = 0.004) and electron accepting power (0.911, P = 0.004), meaning that the higher energetic stability and electron-withdrawing ability result in a better Jsc and consequently in a better conversion efficiency (η). NKX-2807 has the same electron accepting power as NKX-2883, but it should be concentrated in the anchor group. The electron donating power presented a positive correlation with Jsc (0.897, P = 0.006). This means that a higher electron donating power represents a lower electron donating ability,38 namely, the molecule with the lowest electron donating capacity has the better efficiency in this study. Otherwise, the Voc had similar Pearson correlations to Jsc, but with poorer values. An exception was the oscillator strength where a Jsc and a Voc were found to be 0.717 (P = 0.017) and 0.845 (P = 0.070), respectively. Although the oscillator strength was obtained from the maximum wavelength and other absorptions were not considered, it presented a seemly correlation with the experimental data, which shows an effect on them (e.g., the efficiency; Pearson correlation = 0.693, P = 0.084).

The η is mainly affected by the same tendency as Jsc. Hence, the η will be better when the Jsc is higher, but it also has a higher Voc. Finally, the driving force of electron injection (inject) was found to be smaller with the lowest chemical hardness, and higher electrophilicity, electron donating power, and electron acepting power, and in general with a higher oscillator strength. The first selection criterion could be addressed to molecules with a lower chemical hardness and driving force of electron injection and also a higher electrophilicity and electron accepting power. It is important to note that there should be an equilibrium between electron accepting power and electron donating power. For example, Table 4 shows that NKX-2807 and NKX-2883 have the same electron accepting power, but NKX-2807 has a higher electron donating power, namely, both have the same electron-withdrawing ability, but NKX-2807 has less electron donating ability than NKX-2883. Consequently, this sensitizer has the highest conversion efficiency (η). The Pearson correlation coefficients reported here were consistent with those obtained by other chemical models included in the ESI.†
4. Conclusions
The methodology employed in this study that was used to select the molecule with the best conversion efficiency (η) was in accordance with the experimental data, i.e., both showed that NKX-2883 was the best dye of this group. Also, the driving force of electron injection is a useful criterion to choose the best dye; however, the chemical reactivity parameters, mainly chemical hardness, electrophilicity, electron donating power, and electron accepting power, allow a deeper study for predicting the dye with the highest efficiency, and it can be an auxiliary support previous to calculations on the dye–TiO2 complex. According to the above, if a big group of molecules is studied, it can be reduced to a little group to be synthesized and used in DSSCs, by simply performing calculations of geometry optimization and subsequently searching for the smaller chemical hardness and inject as well as for higher electrophilicity and electron accepting power. In this sense, it was observed that the π bridge had an important effect on the properties of the dyes. When the conjugation of the π bridge is augmented, the dye presents a lower chemical hardness and the LUMO energy is closer to the TiO2 conduction band. Consequently, there is higher electrophilicity and electron accepting power. The above parameters have a good correlation with the experimental efficiency parameters. Also, f was positively affected by the π bridge conjugation. Therefore, these molecular systems can be studied in the future.
