    , Accepted 29th April 2020First published on 29th April 2020AbstractEr3+ (10%) and Yb3+/Er3+ (10%/10%) doped tetragonal LiLuF4 microcrystals were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The upconversion (UC) luminescence of LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and LiLuF4:Er3+ microcrystals is studied under 1560 nm pulsed laser excitation. The UC luminescence spectra indicated that LiLuF4 with doped rare earth ions achieved emissions that come from 2–4 photon UC processes. In the Yb3+/Er3+ doped LiLuF4, the UC fluorescence shows enhanced emission of Er3+ ions in the infrared range of about 1 μm under 1560 nm laser excitation. The UC population processes of Er3+ and the energy transfer (ET) mechanism between Er3+ and Yb3+ played important roles in the as-prepared samples.
1. Introduction
Lanthanide-doped upconversion (UC) materials are famous materials, owing to their superior features, such as high photochemical stability, low toxicity and biocompatibility. The main characteristic of the nonlinear optical process is very interesting, which is that these materials can stay at the intermediate long-lived energy states and emit photons at a shorter wavelength than the pump wavelength by the successive absorption of two or more pump photons. This general concept was first recognized and formulated independently by Auzel et al. in the mid-1960s.1 In recent years, the research on UC materials has been expanding due to their potential applications in short-wavelength solid-state lasers, 3D color displays, biological labeling, biomedicines, solar cells etc.2–4 Among the Ln3+ doped UC materials, fluoride is usually selected as the up-conversion matrix material because of its high thermal and chemical stability and high refractive index.5 More importantly, rare earth fluorides possess lower phonon energy which prevents the intraionic non-radiative decay of the relevant emitting and intermediate energy levels.6–10
Silicon-based solar cells are still one of the most extensive photovoltaic devices on the market. But photons with a wavelength longer than 1100 nm cannot be utilized by silicon-based solar cells due to the energy gap of crystalline silicon, which is about 1.12 eV at 300 K. This means that at least 20% of the solar irradiation is lost.11 Now, the UC process is considered as the promising method to convert photons with a wavelength longer than 1100 nm to the shorter ones, which can be absorbed by crystalline silicon solar cells. The quantum efficiency of silicon solar cells can be improved in this way.12–14 Typically, Er3+ single doped or co-doped phosphors hopefully improve the infrared (IR) to near-infrared (NIR) UC performance. Because the UC emission of Er3+ ions occurs from 500–1100 nm they can be absorbed by crystalline silicon solar cells under irradiation in the 1500–1600 nm region. Among these UC materials, Er3+ ion doped LiLuF4 materials are an appropriate candidate to improve the working efficiency of solar cells through the UC process. Firstly, Er3+ ions can easily realize visible and even near-infrared light (1000 nm) by absorbing two or three 1560 nm photons to satisfy silicon-based devices. Secondly, it is reported that the UC process can be enhanced by increasing the concentration of rear earth ions in LiLuF4.15 Therefore, Er3+ion doped fluoride crystals offer further applications in crystalline silicon solar cells.
In this article, 10%Er3+ and 10%Yb3+ and 10%Er3+ doped LiLuF4 microcrystals (MCs) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. It is interesting that the UC luminescence (UCL) spectra of LiLuF4:10%Yb3+, 10%Er3+ (LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+) and LiLuF4:10%Er3+ (LiLuF4:Er3+) ranged from the visible to the near infrared region. By comparing the UCL spectra of LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and LiLuF4:Er3+, the emission peak at 1 μm can be enhanced by Yb3+ doping. These results show that the energy transfer (ET) process from Yb3+ to Er3+ played an important role in populating the high-energy states of Yb3+ and Er3+. The UC ET mechanism of Er3+ and Yb3+/Er3+ induced by 1560 nm laser excitation was also discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Analytical grade Yb2O3, Er2O3, Lu2O3, NaF, ethanol, and EDTA were obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagents, China. Deionized water was used for all subsequent dilutions. All other chemical reagents were of analytical reagent grade and were used without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of LiLuF4:Er3+ and LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ MCs
In a typical synthesis process, 1 mmol Rare Earth Nitrate aqueous solution (0.9 mmol of Lu(NO3)3/0.1 mmol of Er(NO3)3 or 0.8 of mmol Lu(NO3)3/0.1 mmol of Er(NO3)3/0.1 mmol of Yb(NO3)3) and 1 mmol of EDTA were dispensed into 20 mL of deionized water and magnetically stirred for 1 h, forming a chelated Ln-EDTA (Ln = Yb, Er, Lu) complex. Then 3 mmol of NaF and 3 mmol of LiF were added into the solution. After vigorously stirring for 1 h, the mixture was transferred into a 30 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and maintained in an oven at 200 °C for 16 h, and then cooled down slowly to room temperature. Subsequently, the final products were centrifuged and rinsed with distilled water and ethanol several times. The resultant product was dried under vacuum at 80 °C.
2.3. Characterization
The phase identification was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Model Rigaku RU-200b), using nickel-filtered CuKα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range from 10° to 70°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL 600 (USA) with an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The sizes and morphologies were characterized with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) scan profiles were obtained on a JEOL JSM-7500 F FESEM microscope coupled with an EDX spectrometer (Genesis Apollo XL). TEM and SEM samples were prepared by placing droplets of the cyclohexane dispersion on the silicon wafer and letting the cyclohexane to evaporate in air. UCL spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer with 1.0 nm slit width and 400 V power multiplier tube (PMT) voltage under 1560 nm laser excitation. All measurements were performed at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure and morphology

Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-obtained LiLuF4:Er3+ and LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ MCs. All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the tetragonal phase of LiLuF4 (JCPDS No. 27-1251). There are some effects on the lattice parameters of LiLuF4 MCs with Yb3+ and Er3+ doping. The diffraction peaks of LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ slightly shifted to larger diffraction angles than that of LiLuF4:Er3+, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The calculated lattice parameter a/c is 5.130/10.565 Å and 5.136/10.582 Å for LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and LiLuF4:Er3+, respectively. These changes suggest that the lattice parameters shrink after substitution of Lu3+ ions by Yb3+ and Er3+ due to the ion radii of Yb3+ (0.086 nm), Er3+ (0.088 nm) and Lu3+ (0.085 nm) ions. The sharp and narrow peaks indicated that the as-prepared LiLuF4 shows good crystallization. High crystallinity of the matrix is important for upconverter, because it generally means less traps and stronger upconversion luminescence.16

The morphologies of the as-prepared LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and LiLuF4:Er3+ macrocrystals were characterized by TEM, SEM and EDX, as shown in Fig. 2. The TEM images of Fig. 2(a) and (b) show that the samples are octahedron macrocrystals and the length of the samples was 1–2 μm on average. The SEM images of the as-prepared LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and LiLuF4:Er3+ samples are similar. The typical SEM image of the as-prepared samples is shown in Fig. 2(c). The SEM image of LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ shows a smooth surface and no obvious cracking or destruction. Fig. 2(d) and (e) show the EDX spectrum obtained for the surfaces of LiLuF4:Er3+ and LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ microcrystals. The obvious peaks associated with F, Lu, Yb and Er were confirmed. The Yb/Er atomic ratio is ∼1:1 in the LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ microcrystals, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(d).

3.2. The analysis of the UCL spectra of LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and LiLuF4:Er3+ MCs

Fig. 3 shows the photoluminescence emission spectra of LiLuF4:Yb3+/Er3+ and LiLuF4:Er3+ under 1560 nm excitation. In the spectra of LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and LiLuF4:Er3+, the emission peaks located at ∼521 nm, ∼552 nm and ∼669 nm correspond to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively. The near infrared emission at ∼972 nm and ∼1000 nm are attributed to the 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions or the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transitions of Yb3+ ions. It is interesting that the shape of the Er3+ ions emission at ∼1000 nm is different with Er3+ ions doped the different matrix. For example, for Er3+ doped beta-NaYF417,18 or NaLuF4,19 the peaks at 972 and 1020 nm are envelope shape. It is well known that the ground state (4I11/2) and excited state (4I15/2) of Er3+ ions will be split due to the Stark sublevels.20,21 The variation of the UC is attributed to the changes in the symmetry of the local crystal field.22,23 In addition, the crystal quality has an effect on the shape of UC emission, specially the ground state and lower excited state of rare earth ions. Such as, when Er3+ ions doped KGd(WO4)2 single crystals, it is easy to record a discrete peak at ∼1000 nm because Er3+ ions suffer less interference from the crystal field.24 Compared to the emission of LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and LiLuF4:Er3+ in the UCL spectra, the emission intensity of Er3+ increased upon doping Yb3+ ions at the near infrared region, which indicated the ET process between Yb3+ and Er3+,18 as shown in the inset of Fig. 3.

To study the ET process between Yb3+ ions and Er3+ ions, the fluorescence decay curves of 4I11/2 of Er3+ ions are recorded in Fig. 4. The luminescence lifetime of Er3+ (4I11/2 → 4I15/2 transition) in the LiLuF4:Er3+ and LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ MCs decreased from 1313 μs to 637 μs under 1560 nm excitation. The decreasing lifetime in LiLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ indicates ET from Er3+ ions to Yb3+ ions due to appropriate energy matching between 4I11/2–4I15/2 (Er3+) and 2F5/2–2F7/2 (Yb3+). The decrease of the lifetime might be caused by a back ET process (BET),25 but the high emission efficiency of the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition enhanced the ∼1000 nm NIR UC emission.26

To understand the n-photon UC processes well, the pumping power dependence of the fluorescence intensity has been investigated. For an unsaturated UC process, the emission intensity If is proportional to the nth power of the IR excitation intensity IIR: If ∝ InIR, the integer n is the number of laser photons absorbed per upconverted photon emitted.27Fig. 5 shows the double logarithmic plots of If as a function of IIR. The n values can be easily obtained from the slope of the linear fit. The values of slope n are 4.2, 3.9, 3.1 and 1.9 for 520, 552, 669 and 1000 nm emissions, respectively. This means that the population of states 2H11/2, 4S3/24F9/2 and 4I11/2 is attributed to 4, 4, 3 and 2 photon UC processes, respectively.

3.3. Mechanism
In order to understand the UC mechanism of these samples, the energy level population and emission process of UC would be discussed. Fig. 6 shows the energy level diagrams of Er3+ and Yb3+ ions and the possible UC population and emission process under 1560 nm excitation. First, the Er3+ ions are populated at the 4I13/2 state from the ground state 4I15/2 by the ground state absorption (GSA) process.28 And then the 4I9/2 and 2H11/2 states are populated by the successive excitation state absorption (ESA) process.28 Some of the Er3+ ions at 4I9/2 may nonradiatively relax to the 4I11/2 level, resulting in the ET from Er3+ (4I11/2) to Yb3+ (2F5/2). Due to the ET, Yb3+ ions will be excited to the 2F5/2 state, and the energy is transmitted to Er3+ ions by BET.25 Consequently, Er3+ ions are populated at the 4F7/2 level from the 4I11/2 level via absorbing a 1560 nm photon. Some of the Er3+ ions at state 4F7/2 nonradiatively relax to the 2H11/2 level. The 4S3/2 level is populated in the same way. Thus, the Er3+ ions from the 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 levels to the 2I15/2 state match with the emission peaks at 552 and 521 nm. The red emission peaks at 669 and 972 nm match with the transitions of 4F9/2 and 4I11/2. After codoping Yb3+ ions, the ET process of Er3+/Yb3+ ions occurred due to their close interatomic distance and the appropriate energy matching between 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 (Er3+) and 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 (Yb3+). The 4I11/2 energy levels of the Er3+ ions can transfer their energy to the 2F5/2 energy levels of Yb3+ ions, followed by the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 radiative transition at ∼1000 nm. Thereby, the emission at ∼ 1 μm could be enhanced by the Yb3+ ion doping.

4. Conclusions
In this article, LiLuF4:10%Yb3+,10%Er3+ and LiLuF4:10%Er3+ MCs were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The X-ray diffraction patterns and scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the samples were octahedron microcrystals with smooth surfaces and lengths of 1–2 μm. The UCL spectra indicate that LiLuF4 with doped rare earth ions achieved 2–4 order emission UC processes under 1560 nm laser excitation. And an ∼1000 nm UC emission can be enhanced with Yb3+ doping. The ET process between Yb3+ ions and Er3+ ions is confirmed. The present results may be beneficial to improving the silicon solar cell efficiency.
