1. Introduction
As one of the most significant processes, natural nitrogen fixation transforms solar energy into chemical energy in the form of “fixed” nitrogen, with ammonia (NH3) as the main product, which is critically essential for plants, animals and other life forms.1,2 This conversion is of great importance in the upcoming renewable energy era, especially considering the continuous growth of population worldwide. In this regard, there is an urgent need to develop artificial nitrogen fixation approaches to balance the global nitrogen cycle, which has spurred enormous interest among scientists since the 19th century. The primary method for industrial ammonia production is the well-known Haber–Bosch process, which was first introduced in the early 1900s. It should be noted that this process occurs at high temperatures (300–550 °C) and pressures (15–25 MPa),3 and is not only energy intensive (accounts for nearly 2% of global energy consumption), but also dependent on sophisticated reaction facilities and responsible for 1% of the global greenhouse gas emissions.4 In addition, ammonia production plants are also geographically highly centralized, while the consumption is distributed throughout agricultural regions.5 Undoubtedly, the distribution leads to limitations of increased transportation costs and emissions. These factors significantly motivate the development of new sustainable and distributed technologies for ammonia production to control the global nitrogen cycle.
In this realm, photocatalysis offers a sustainable and non-site-specific alternative, and is an area of intensive research in chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. Schrauzer and Guth reported photocatalytic nitrogen reduction over Ti-based nanostructured materials in 1977 for the first time, which is the preface of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.6 Although TiO2 has been positioned as the classic photocatalyst with advantages of low cost and non-toxicity, it is only active under ultraviolet (UV) light, thereby greatly limiting the solar utilization efficiency.7 Metal oxides,8,9 metal sulfides,10,11 g-C3N4,12 and biomimicking photocatalysts13 have been investigated for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation in recent years. However, research in this area is at the initial stage, which suffers from low solar-to-ammonia efficiency (rates around 100 μmol g−1 h−1 at best) and is far from industrial consideration.14 This is firstly ascribed to the general obstacle of low quantum efficiency in photocatalytic reactions, which is primarily ascribed to the ineffective utilization of visible light and high recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs. On the other hand, activation and cleavage of the strong nonpolar NN bond (941 kJ mol−1) remain a challenge in the photocatalytic nitrogen reduction process, which is an uphill reaction process involving the formation of high-energy intermediates (N2H and N2H2).15 These issues enlighten us that the optimization of the overall photocatalytic performance for an efficient light-driven nitrogen fixation system must systematically (i) engineer the light-harvesting performance and steer the charge flow to increase the availability of charge carriers of photocatalysts for the reduction of adsorbed N2, and (ii) promote nitrogen activation sites to enhance the sluggish N2 activation kinetics.
The band gaps, the positions of the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB), the band dispersion, and surface active sites affect the essential steps, thus fundamentally determining the performances of photocatalysts. It has been reported that the band edge formed by the p orbital or sp hybridization affects the physicochemical properties of catalysts, which leads to a higher activity under visible-light irradiation over photocatalysts containing p orbital elements.16 In general, the p electrons involved in the hybridization state can reduce the CB edge and/or increase the VB edge, resulting in a much narrower bandgap than that of d-block semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, etc.). This is desirable for the visible-light absorption of semiconductors toward optoelectronics and photocatalysis.17 In addition, the space anisotropic p and sp hybrid state could also lead to a highly dispersed band structure, which not only reduces the effective quality to promote the mobility of photogenerated charge carriers, but also enhances the charge separation and transport in the process of photocatalysis.18 All these unique features may make p-block semiconductors attractive for solar light-driven photocatalysis. As typical examples, bismuth-based photocatalysts feature high chemical stability, low toxicity, and low cost.19 Moreover, the high electrical conductivity and suitable intrinsic bandgaps endow them with promising photoactivities. Although Bi5+-based compounds can also be excited by visible light, Bi3+-based compounds have been studied extensively with better stability. The VB of such oxides is mostly hybridized by the 6s orbital of Bi and the 2p orbital of O. Due to the entry of the Bi 6s orbital, the VB of this kind of material is shallower than that of the oxide (2p orbital of O), which reduces the bandgap, thus achieving a visible light response.20 In addition, such compounds usually have a layered structure with strong intralayer covalent bonding and weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, which give rise to highly anisotropic structural, electrical, optical, and mechanical properties.21 In recent years, bismuth-based photocatalysts have been widely studied for photocatalytic degradation,22 photocatalytic water splitting,23 and photocatalytic CO2 conversion.24
It is worth noting that bismuth-containing systems have been extensively explored for photocatalytic N2 fixation. It has been reported that bismuth molybdate achieves enhanced photocatalytic NH3 productivity after the hydrogenation process under mild conditions.25 In addition, bismuth oxyhalides BiOX (X = Cl, Br, I) have attracted wide research attention, which possess a layered structure characterized by the staggered arrangement of [Bi2O2] sheets and two halogen atoms.26 The flexibility of selective exposure of different crystal facets by pH adjustment, phase transition, modulation of facet-related internal electric field (IEF) intensity, and generation of surface oxygen vacancies enables the engineering of the physicochemical properties of BiOX toward N2 adsorption and activation for solar N2-to-ammonia conversion.27 To date, many interesting and meaningful results have been reported over BiOX photocatalysts.28 In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the area of bismuth-based photocatalysts for nitrogen fixation to ammonia. The thermodynamic and kinetic principles of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation over bismuth-based photocatalysts and the commonly used ammonia detection methods are critically analysed to offer the best practices for reasonable and reliable investigations. The effect of material modification on the catalytic activities and the microscopic mechanism of photocatalytic N2 reduction are discussed. Finally, we cast a personal prospect on the future development of bismuth-based photocatalysts for nitrogen fixation to ammonia. It is hoped that this article could not only serve as a useful tutorial for those who are just starting the research on photocatalytic nitrogen fixation, but also inspire the rational design and fabrication of advanced bismuth-based photocatalysts for sustainable nitrogen reduction.
2. Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation

Fig. 1 shows the potentials of some reactions related to photocatalytic nitrogen reduction at pH = 0. Although the overall reaction of nitrogen reduction to ammonia (N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2NH3) is more favorable than the hydrogen evolution reaction from thermodynamic considerations, some key elemental bond cleavage potentials are extremely high. For example, it requires a reduction potential of −3.2 V vs. NHE for the very first hydrogenation of N2 (N2 + H+ + e− → N2H), which presents a grand challenge for most semiconductors without active sites to decrease the activation barrier. In addition, the competition between nitrogen reduction and hydrogen evolution is another obstacle for photocatalytic ammonia production. Theoretically, the Haber–Bosch process undergoes the dissociative mechanism (Fig. 2), which is characteristic of the NN triple bond cleavage requiring extremely high energy input as the initial step. Two different associative N2 reduction pathways have been considered, i.e., distal and alternating pathways, invoking distinctly different intermediates.29,30 As shown in Fig. 2, in the alternating pathway, two N atoms are hydrogenated alternately, forming hydrazine bound intermediates after four hydrogenation steps, and only the first NH3 is released in the fifth step. In comparison, in the distal pathway, a single N atom of N2 is hydrogenated in three steps until the first NH3 is released, and then the remaining nitride-N is hydrogenated three more times to produce a second NH3.

The thermodynamic considerations of the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation process can be divided into two types: the thermodynamics of the total reaction and the half-reaction independent of the catalyst, and the surface reaction thermo-dynamics and photon induction processes depending on the photocatalyst.31 In order to rationally design and formulate a photocatalytic nitrogen fixation scheme, taking the thermodynamics of the global reaction and the redox reaction into consideration is an indispensable condition. Medford et al. presented a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of the general nitrogen-containing compounds with clear entropy and enthalpy to determine the thermodynamic feasibility of various nitrogen-fixing pathways. Provided that the adsorption energy and vibrational energy of possible intermediates generated during nitrogen reduction are known, free energy can be calculated and then be used to measure the onset potential for the reaction. The thermodynamics of both oxidative and reductive reactions under ambient conditions based on values tabulated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are given in Table 1. Photocatalysts often exhibit certain limitations in the photocatalytic reaction process. The reduction potential required to break the N2 bond cleavage on the surface of the photocatalyst is −4.2 V vs. NHE, which is difficult to achieve in most semiconductors. Relatively multiple electronic processes are more feasible.

It is relatively easy to convert N2 to a single-nitrogen compound such as ammonia and nitrate, but the conversion of a diazo compound into a mono-nitrogen compound is more difficult from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. The fixation of nitrogen can be classified as a reduction or oxidation reaction, but under environmental conditions, the reductive product ammonia and the oxidative product nitrate can be observed simultaneously from titanium-based photocatalysts. Therefore, it is currently uncertain that the process is a separate oxidation or a reduction reaction. The mutual conversion of redox products is a complicated process. It is difficult to determine whether the fixation process between these interconnected pathways occurs through an oxidation reaction or a reduction reaction. In many studies, the oxidation of ammonia under environmental conditions is observed.33 The conversion of reduced products to oxidized products requires a driving force, so photocatalysis under environmental conditions may be a process of oxidation of the reduction product. However, the reaction voltage of the reduced oxidation product is a relatively low value relative to most nitrogen fixation reactions, and only requires less thermodynamic energy, and photo-reduction of the oxidation product occurs in the environment.
When a nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) occurs in a protic solvent, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) would be a competitor inevitably. Some promising materials that have been predicted to have high nitrogen-fixing catalytic activity also have a *H binding energy close to the ideal for hydrogen evolution,34 which may facilitate the competitive HER reaction. Consequently, the selectivity between the HER and NRR needs to be considered when designing metal cocatalysts for nitrogen reduction. Nørskov et al. investigated the relationship between the catalytic performance of nitrogen reduction and the binding energy of intermediates by density functional theory (DFT) on face-centered cubic (fcc) metals.34 Taking Re(211) as an example, the HER has a more positive limiting potential than the NRR. The difference between the limiting potentials of the HER and NRR on the (111) facet is smaller than that on the (211) facet and the metals present the difference in limiting potentials for these two reactions more than 0.4 V, which indicate that HER takes the advantage of selectivity (Fig. 3). When designing nitrogen reduction catalysts, the HER process should be retarded over the catalysts. When the metal-to-nitrogen bond is too weak, the rate-limiting step will be reductive adsorption of N2 to *N2H. When the metal-to-nitrogen bond is relatively strong, the hydrogenation of *NH to *NH2 or the evolution of *NH2 to NH3 determines the rate of the reaction. The ideal heterogeneous nitrogen reduction catalyst should have a strong interaction with nitrogen and a weak binding capacity with intermediate products.

3. To be rational to quantify ammonia concentration
As a basis for evaluating the activity of photocatalysts, quantification of ammonia produced by photocatalytic reduction of N2 is an important step, which still faces many challenges. Common methods for ammonia detection in water include spectrophotometric/colorimetric assays by using Nessler's reagent35 and indophenol blue,36 ion chromatography,37 fluorescence,38 ammonia ion-selective electrodes,39 or the 1H-NMR spectrum.40 Among them, the spectrophotometric detection method is widely used in the detection of ammonia in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The pH of the solution, the presence of certain metal ions, sacrificial agents, and nitrogen-containing chemicals can all adversely affect the reliable ammonia quantification.
The Nessler's reagent method is based on iodide ions and mercury ions reacting with ammonia under strongly alkaline conditions to form a reddish-brown complex according to the following reaction:2K2HgI4 + NH3 + 3KOH → Hg2NH2I + 7KI+ 2H2O
The resulting complex has a strong absorption peak at a wavelength around 420 nm, the intensity of which is proportional to the ammonia concentration, and the ammonia nitrogen content can be determined by measuring the absorbance of the reaction solution. The drawback of Nessler's reagent is the toxicity due to the presence of mercury ions. There are other things to note while using Nessler's reagent. For example, the shelf life of Nessler's reagent is about three weeks.41 In addition, the color development period also has an influence on the accuracy of the ammonia content.
Based on the Berthelot reaction when ammonia reacts with phenol and alkaline hypochlorite a deep blue color will be developed, and it has been modified for ammonia determination, as shown in the following reaction:  
The indophenol produced by the Berthelot reaction appears to be stable.42 If the solution is not exposed to carbon dioxide absorption or direct sunlight, the reported stabilization time range is 4–6 h and up to 24 h or even longer. It is worth noting that, in the determination of ammonia concentration by the indophenol blue method, the order of reagent addition will also affect the detection results. Usually, phenol is added first and then hypochlorite is added. The addition of hypochlorite for ammonia volatilization also leads to a decrease in sensitivity. At a high ammonia concentration, if hypochlorite is added first, indophenol may be produced less or even not. At a low concentration, hypochlorite may be added to maintain the sensitivity. The interval between the reagent addition is also important, and all reagents should be added quickly. As a result, it is recommended to keep the addition order consistent, on the other hand, the pH of the solution and the presence of metal ions may affect the sensitivity and accuracy of this method.43 The detection range of NH3 was explored using Nessler's reagent, indophenol blue and ion chromatography, and standard curves are presented in Fig. 4a–c. The three assays showed a high degree of linearity without interference. Fig. 4d shows that the results of the three methods are consistent at low concentrations in the wide range of NH3 concentrations. At higher concentrations, the results obtained by the Nessler's reagent and ion chromatography are more accurate meanwhile the indophenol blue method leads to an overestimation of the ammonia concentration. Zhao et al. investigated a series of factors that may affect the accuracy of ammonia detection, including pH, the presence of hetero ions, the choice of the water source, and the applicable concentration range.44 It has been found that pH is an important factor affecting the detection results. Results obtained using Nessler's reagent showed a good linear correlation with ammonia concentration in a large pH range, while indophenol blue showed a relatively stable performance in neutral and alkaline environments and a relatively obvious negative deviation under acidic conditions.

In some cases, a hole trapping agent is added into a photocatalytic nitrogen-fixing aqueous solution reaction system to consume photogenerated holes to prevent recombination of photogenerated electrons with holes. Commonly used hole trapping agents are methanol, ethanol, formic acid, etc., which are oxidized to compounds containing a carbonyl group. However, these organic compounds and their oxides may form a complex with NH3, which affects the measurement results.45 If a colored complex is formed, it is possible that the detection result is higher than the actual content. Especially, when alcohol is added as a hole trapping agent into the reaction system, the result by the Nessler's reagent method is greatly disturbed.45Fig. 5a shows the absorbance of varied amounts of ammonia standard solution. Fig. 5b and c show the light absorbance at 420 nm for Nessler's reagent and ammonia standard solution with 500 μg L−1 acetaldehyde and 80 μg L−1 acetone, respectively. These results confirm that both acetaldehyde and acetone also have an interference effect on the detection of ammonia by using Nessler's reagent. Although the oxidized carbonyl compound does not interfere with the cation exchange chromatography (CEC) process, the oxidized carbonyl compound affects Nessler's reagent detection, producing false-positive results. The experimental results show that the Nessler reagent is not suitable for ammonia detection in the presence of sacrificial agents. It is strongly recommended that, along with colorimetric assays, other methods such as 15N isotope and enzyme assays can be used as additional assays to avoid possible false-positive results. In addition to traditional spectrophotometry to detect ammonia concentration, new detection methods have been researched and developed in recent years. Meseguer-Lloret and co-workers used a mixture of o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) as a derivatizing agent for ammonium and the formed high fluorescence isoindole is selectively detected in the presence of an amine.46 Compared with commonly used ammonia detection methods, such as Nessler's reagent and ammonium ion-selective electrodes, the OPA-NAC method shows a lower detection limit, superior in sensitivity and selectivity, and is equally applicable to ammonia detection in solution.

The amount of ammonia produced by photocatalytic nitrogen fixation is small and the classical laboratory yield is between 10 and 1000 nmol. Various contamination sources, such as ammonia in the catalyst itself and the dissolution of gases in the environment, may increase the amount of ammonia detected. For example, the anions contained in the solvent include nitrogen in various oxidation states (NOx) and the impurity nitrogen oxides contained in the supply gas are easily reduced to nitrogen under ambient conditions. Gloves and glassware used in the experiment may also contain traces of nitrogen oxide contaminants, which may remain after repeated washings. This greatly restricts the progress of catalytic technology, including photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The reproducibility of photoactivity requires sufficient attention in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. In this context, control experiments are very necessary, and the rigorous processing of the experimental results is the basic law of scientific research.
Hydrazine (N2H4) is a potential product of photocatalytic nitrogen reduction, the detection of which is of importance to evaluate the selectivity of N2-to-ammonia conversion and understand the microscopic nitrogen reduction pathway. The detection and quantification of hydrazine in the reaction system can be achieved by the Watt–Chrisp method.47 When p-dimethylamino-benzaldehyde is added to hydrazine in dilute hydrochloric acid solutions, yellow color develops and changes along with the hydrazine concentration.47 Notably, it has been proven that the presence of ammonium ions does not interfere with the determination. This enables the reliable detection and quantification of hydrazine by the spectrophotometric method. In recent years, electrochemical methods have been investigated for hydrazine detection. Jayasri et al. synthesized a manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) modified graphite–wax composite electrode and applied it to the detection of hydrazine.48 The anodic current increased linearly with the increase of hydrazine concentration in the range of 3.33 × 10−5 mol L−1 to 8.18 × 10−3 mol L−1 and the detection limit was found to be 6.65 × 10−6 mol L−1.
4. Materials engineering of bismuth-based photocatalysts for nitrogen fixation
Despite the promise of bismuth-based functional materials for photocatalytic N2-to-ammonia conversion, a few limitations have been the bottlenecks of their photocatalytic performances, such as the large bandgap affecting the solar light utilization efficiency, high photogenerated electron–hole recombination, and limited surface active centers. Table 2 summarizes the advances in photocatalytic N2 reduction to ammonia by engineering bismuth-based functional materials. Since Li et al. first synthesized {001} facet exposed BiOBr with oxygen vacancies for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation in 2015,49 researchers have been committed to developing bismuth-based photocatalysts toward solar ammonia production, including bismuth oxide, bismuth oxyhalides, and bismuth-based polyoxometalates. Selective exposure of facets, defect engineering, and heteroatom doping have been adopted to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of N2-to-ammonia conversion. In addition, the construction of heterostructures by assembling two complementary components has been shown to be effective in achieving new properties that are not available in single phase materials (Fig. 6). The classification is mainly based on the aforementioned methods of material modification, which will be elaborated in detail in the following section.

4.1 Facet control of bismuth-based photocatalysts
Microscopic morphology regulation has been extensively studied in recent years, showing that the crystal facet engineering of semiconductors is an effective strategy for tuning catalytic performances. Since the photocatalytic process occurs on the surface of the semiconductor, the physical and chemical properties of the semiconductor surface (e.g., crystal face index, specific surface area, etc.) have an important influence on the photocatalytic activity. Methodologies to engineer the crystal facets of semiconductors have been widely studied in recent years, and it is an important factor to improve the photocatalytic activity. However, the main way to expose the active surface to determine photocatalytic performance remains to be explored. The crystal surface energy of different crystal face indexes varies in size. Generally, the crystal surface with higher surface energy tends to have better photocatalytic reactivity. However, according to the Wulff crystal growth theory, the surface energy can be compared under equilibrium growth conditions. The low crystal face has the highest probability of becoming the exposed face of the crystal. It is noteworthy that crystal planes with higher surface energy are also most likely to disappear during crystal growth. Therefore, by adding mineralizers and surfactants to change the conventional growth habit of crystals, it is of great significance to improve the performance of crystal photocatalysts by exposing highly active surfaces. Li et al. systematically studied the photocatalytic activity of BiOBr nanosheets with dominant exposure (001) and (010) facets (denoted as B001 and B010).75 Morphology investigations show that both the B001 and B010 are irregular nanosheets (Fig. 7a and d). The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the B001 (Fig. 7b) shows two perpendicular sets of lattice fringes with spacings of 0.277 nm (Fig. 7e), corresponding to (110) and (1–10) planes both of which are perpendicular to the (001) plane. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the B001 (Fig. 7c) shows clear ordered diffraction spots, indicating a single crystal structure and all the diffraction planes are perpendicular to the (001) plane. The HRTEM image of the B010 (Fig. 7e) shows three sets of lattice fringes with angles of 88.2, 45.9 and 45.9° and spacings of 0.201, 0.281 and 0.281 nm, respectively, corresponding to (004), (102) and (−102) planes which are vertical to the (010) plane. The SAED pattern of the B010 (Fig. 7f) also shows a single crystal structure and all the diffraction planes are vertical to the (010) plane. Based on the above results, it is concluded that the B001 nanosheets expose (001) facets on both the top and bottom surfaces and (010), (110) and (100) facets on the lateral surfaces (Fig. 7g), while the B010 nanosheets expose (010) facets on both the top and bottom surfaces and (001), (102) and (100) facets on the lateral surfaces (Fig. 7i). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that B010 has a higher surface electron density than B001. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and photocurrent results indicate that the reduced thickness and increased percentages (001) can accelerate the separation of photoinduced charge carriers, thereby increasing photocatalytic activity. For the BiOBr nanosheets, on the one hand, the layered structure provides an adequately large space to polarize related atoms and orbitals. The induced dipole between [Bi2O2]2+ and Br− slabs brings about an IEF along the z-axis (Fig. 7h and j) which accelerates the separation and transport of the photogenerated electrons (e−) and holes (h+) (Fig. 7g and i), and thus lowers the recombination efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. This work provides an important direction for the preparation and research of photoactivity of photocatalysts with different exposed facets.

The theoretical investigations by Liu et al. show that the photocatalytic N2 fixation performance is essentially related to the surface terminations.76 To be specific, results based on density functional theory (DFT) reveal that Bi-terminated BiOBr {001} facets may be good candidates for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation due to the stronger activation ability of N2 molecules compared with O-terminated BiOBr {001} facets with oxygen vacancies (OVs). Bai et al. synthesized two kinds of Bi5O7I nanosheet samples with the main surface exposure of {001} or {100} by molecular precursor hydrolysis and calcination (Fig. 8a), which are denoted as Bi5O7I-001 and Bi5O7I-100, respectively. Fig. 8b shows the band diagrams of Bi5O7I-100 and Bi5O7I-001. Negative CB positions are correlated with a high reduction power, which indicates that Bi5O7I-001 has a higher reduction activity for N2 fixation than Bi5O7I-100. Fig. 8c shows the photocatalytic activity of Bi5O7I-100 and Bi5O7I-001 for N2 fixation. In the absence of light irradiation, NH3 and NO3− were not detected in the absence of N2 gas and without photocatalyst (photometric control). Fig. 8d suggests that NO3− is not the major product of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation over Bi5O7I. It can be found that the Bi5O7I-001 had better photocatalytic nitrogen fixation performance (11.15 μmol g−1 h−1) than Bi5O7I-100 (4.76 μmol g−1 h−1). Fig. 8e shows the cycling experiments for Bi5O7I-100 and Bi5O7I-001. After five cycles (100 minutes per cycle), the photocatalytic NH3 formation rate of Bi5O7I-001 was slightly reduced by about 2% from 195.2 μmol L−1. The photocatalytic NH3 formation rate of Bi5O7I-100 decreased by about 5% from 85.2 to 81.1 μmol L−1.

Zhang and co-workers examined the photocatalytic activity of BiOCl on different facets with OVs.51 They claimed that the kinetics and mechanism of N2 fixation varied due to the dissimilar facets of BiOCl nanosheets. They highlighted that nitrogen fixation on the {001} facets with OVs followed a distal pathway (N2 → N–NH3 → N + NH3 → 2NH3), whereas the reaction on the {010} facets followed an alternative pathway (N2 → N2H3 → N2H4). The BiOCl (001) facets have a closely packed structure exposed to high density O atoms, while the BiOCl (001) facets have open structures with exposed O, Bi and Cl atoms (Fig. 9a). On the (001) surface, N2 can adsorb on OVs by combining with the two closest Bi atoms in the sublayer, thereby forming an end-linked end structure (Fig. 9b). The difference is that N2 exhibits a more stable side-bridged mode by combining with the two closest Bi atoms in the sublayer on the (010) surface and the next closest Bi atom in the sublayer (Fig. 9c). In addition, the N2 adsorption on the OV of the (010) surface is more stable (9.67 kcal mol−1) than that on the OV of the (001) surface (Fig. 9d). The temperature programmed desorption of N2 (N2-TPD) results reveal that the peak position for BiOCl (010) occurs at higher temperatures of 282 °C as compared to that of BiOCl (001), confirming that N2 chemisorbed on the {010} plane has a higher binding energy than that of BiOCl (001) (Fig. 9e).

4.2 Defect engineering of bismuth-based photocatalysts
Due to poor interfacial charge transfer, most photo-excited electrons are more likely to recombine with their twinborn holes rather than be trapped with adsorbed nitrogen, which limits the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation performance. In addition, high energy N2 intermediates in the reduced or protonated form (N2− or N2H) severely impede N2 fixation.77 Therefore, the fabrication of an electron donor semiconductor with a well-designed catalytic activation center, which can effectively activate the N–N triple bond, may open up a dynamic pathway for effective photocatalytic N2 fixation.78 Li et al. deliberately prepared BiOBr nanosheets with OVs (BOB-001-OV), which effectively immobilized N2 to NH3 in water at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Fig. 10a).49 The catalytically active oxygen vacancies designed on the {001} surface of the BiOBr nanosheet have the availability of local electrons for π-back-donation for N2 adsorption, providing the ability to activate the adsorbed N2 for the reduction to NH3 by interfacial electrons. Under visible light irradiation, BOB-001-OV generates a large amount of NH3 in the N2 atmosphere, and the concentration of NH3 linearly increases with time (Fig. 10b). In contrast, BOB-001-H without OVs exhibits negligible activity for the photogeneration of ammonia in both N2 and Ar. Similar to other conventional semiconductors, the conduction band (CB) potential of BiOBr does not directly reduce N2 or form solvated electrons (Fig. 10c). After 8 cycles of the cycle test, no significant decrease in photoreactivity was observed, indicating that the light-stable visible light N2 of BOB-001- was fixed to OVs (Fig. 10d). In order to directly visualize the N2 reduction on the OV of the {001} plane, an in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technique was used to monitor the functional groups of the functional groups on the BiOBr surface under visible light with time in the designed reaction (Fig. 10e). As for BOB-001-OV, several absorption bands were gradually increased in the N2 atmosphere for 0–30 minutes (Fig. 10f).

Compared with bulk materials, two-dimensional (2D) materials have a thinner structure and can effectively shorten the carrier diffusion distance and thus improve charge separation. Recently, Di and co-workers reported the work of designing surface defects in single-unit-cell Bi3O4Br nanosheets.52 Surface defects and the extremely thin single-unit-cell Bi3O4Br work together to promote both photometric and surface charge separation to improve photocatalytic efficiency. After the preparation of the single crystal cell structure, defects are controlled to regulate oxygen deficiency. Under the synergistic action of unique unit structure and surface defects, the local atomic arrangement and electronic structure can be adjusted, and the efficiency of charge separation is obviously improved. The recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is also a major factor hindering the development of photocatalytic reactions. 2D materials can improve the charge separation in the structure, and surface defects such as oxygen defects can act as charge separation centers, and during the formation of oxygen defects, it will effectively form the active site of the edge or corner. During the experiment, authors found that the Bi vacancy can greatly reduce the energy of the O vacancy formation, so the photocatalytic efficiency is further improved by controlling the concentration of the surface to adjust the oxygen vacancy structure.
The synergistic development of modern material characterization techniques and theoretical computational simulations also shows that the activity of heterogeneous catalysts is more closely related to the presence of surface structures, especially defects. Among the many material defects that are now recognized, oxygen vacancies (OVs) are the most common anion defects. Generally, OVs are generated by the non-aqueous solvent heat treatment to drag O atoms away through the strong interaction between the solvent ligand and O atoms. Hydrogenation can cause surface disorder due to the strong reducing power of hydrogen. Oxygen atoms can be activated and then can escape from the surface structure to form oxygen vacancies. However, O atoms can also be detached by ultraviolet irradiation, and the high concentration of O atoms in Bi5O7Br can easily generate light-induced OVs on the surface for a sufficient reaction. Wang et al. for the first time prepared Bi5O7Br nanotubes with a diameter of 5 nm, which are favorable for furnishing sufficient visible light-induced OVs to realize excellent and stable photoreduction of atmospheric N2 into NH3 in pure water.53 In water-assisted photochemical reaction systems, light-induced OVs on the catalyst surface can activate the original inert surface for solar-driven reduction reactions. In addition, after turning off light irradiation, the light-induced surface OVs are reflected by taking O atoms from water or oxygen, so that the original stable OV-free composition can be restored.
As a typical surface defect, OVs can reduce the recombination of charge carriers by trapping electrons. On the other hand, OVs promote the transfer of charge carriers to reactants.79 In addition, in situ activation of the adsorbed transient electronic states by transition metals can significantly reduce the energy barrier of interface charge transfer.80 Liu et al. for the first time demonstrated that the bismuth iron molybdate (Bi3FeMo2O12) with a band gap of 2.25 eV has nitrogen fixation performance under visible light.54 At the same time, oxygen vacancies were introduced into the bismuth iron molybdate material by calcination in an atmosphere containing hydrogen. The Mo–O–Fe center acts as an active site for nitrogen adsorption during nitrogen reduction. The oxygen vacancies caused by hydrogen treatment lead to Mo5+ species, which can serve as active sites for nitrogen reduction. Oxygen vacancies help to adsorb and stabilize N–H intermediate species and reduce the energy barrier for intermediate reactions.
Moreover, OVs can be induced by heat treatment under an inert atmosphere or a high vacuum. In these processes, high temperatures induce violent vibration of surface atoms, and oxygen atoms are easily detached from the surface lattice under an inert atmosphere leaving oxygen vacancies. Thermal reduction under a hydrogen atmosphere is also a common way to generate oxygen vacancies. Bi et al. obtained hollow microspheres of BiOBr with abundant OVs through calcination in hydrogen at low temperature.55
The theoretical research of the reaction pathway is also essential in the experimental process, which has a guiding and enlightening effect on the experiment. The necessity of OVs for N2 adsorption is further demonstrated by the calculation of the energy of the intermediate which may be produced in the reaction process.51 With the help of theoretical research, the relative energy of intermediates in the reaction process was calculated to discuss the fixation of OV-dependent N2. The entire nitrogen fixation process is exothermic, but the free N2 has an insurmountable energy barrier when it is further converted into N2H2 or N2H4 intermediates (Fig. 11a). Due to thermodynamic considerations, BOV-001 tends to use the remote approach, and BOC-010 tends to use the alternative approach to perform overall OV intervention for N2 fixation. The first hydrogenation step generating N2H is the most difficult step of free N2 fixation. As long as N2 was bound on the OV of BiOCl, this strongly endergonic step became rather exergonic with a free energy change of 41.72 kcal mol−1 for the terminal end-on N2 (1–2) and 53.25 kcal mol−1 (10–11) for the side-on bridging N2 (Fig. 11a and b). The important N2H2 intermediate 12 (NHNH*) or N2H4 intermediate 14 (NH2NH2*) during the N2 fixation in the OV of BOC-010 was generated in an exergonic process, in sharp contrast to the uncatalyzed reaction path. These theoretical snapshots highlight the indispensability of OVs in creating a molecular step that is thermally accessible but kinetically hindered by uncatalyzed N2 fixation.

Xu et al. prepared a basic bismuth carbonate (Bi2O2CO3, BOC) with a controllable defect density (BOC-X) using sodium bismuth (NaBiO3) and graphite carbon nitride (GCN) as precursors by a facile hydrothermal method.56 The defects of BOC-X may stem from the very slow decomposition of GCN during hydrothermal processes. The excellent photocatalytic performance of BOC-X is attributed to the surface defect sites. These defects in BOC-X cause the defect level in the forbidden band to increase, thereby extending the light capture area of the photocatalyst from ultraviolet to visible light. In addition, surface defects improve the separation efficiency of charge carrier pairs by containing photo-generated electrons at the defect level, thereby preventing electron–hole recombination. This work not only demonstrates a novel and scalable strategy for the synthesis of defective Bi2O2CO3, but also provides a new perspective for the synthesis of photocatalysts with controllable defect density.
4.3 Heteroatom-doped bismuth-based photocatalysts
The heteroatom doping strategy is a facile and effective method to improve the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic efficiency of single-phase semiconductor catalysts is often severely affected due to the low photogenerated electron–hole separation efficiency, and the doping of heteroatoms can effectively solve this problem.81 Heteroatom doping has become one of the common methods to regulate the catalytic performance of semiconductors and is often used to enhance the visible light absorption of photocatalysts. It has been observed that the nitrogen fixation reaction of photocatalysts can be promoted by doping modification, such as with Ce, V, Co, Mo, Ni, etc.82 The microcosmic regulation of the semiconductor electronic structure by heteroatom doping is mainly reflected in that, after bismuth-based catalyst doping, impurity ions can independently form dope levels in the semiconductor band gap.83 Meng et al. prepared an Fe doped Bi2MoO6 photocatalyst by a facile solvothermal method.57 Iron doping can reduce the surface work function of Bi2MoO6, which is beneficial to the charge migration to the surface and the catalyst has excellent nitrogen-fixing ability. In addition, an Fe3+/Fe2+ redox pathway is introduced, which can be used as the surface center for reducing N2.
Yasin et al. used density functional theory calculations and experimental model construction to investigate the nitrogen-fixing properties of cation doped (BixMy)2MoO6 as a photocatalyst.84 The relevant reaction pathway energy gap and thermodynamic energy barriers are also taken into consideration, and the physical phenomena are explained by expounding the bound electron state of the surface. This study shows that when H and N reach an equilibrium between the affinities in the La, Yb and Fe compositions of coordination, their orthogonal structure will pass through a certain reaction pathway to produce the lowest energy barrier. Adjustment of the composition of the structure can also result in strong covalent bonding.
Zeng et al. prepared carbon-doped BiOI by a hydrothermal method using Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, KI and glucose as raw materials. During the synthesis of the material, carbon clusters can enter the BiOI crystal layer and create vacancies.59 This defect caused by the carbon dope can reduce the band gap and improve the charge separation efficiency. The presence of surface carbon plays a non-negligible role in the adsorption of N2 on the catalyst. The influence of carbon doping on the morphology of the catalyst and the contribution of the comparative surface area plays a positive role in the photocatalytic performance. Wu et al. prepared bismuth oxychloride microsheets (BiOCl-OV) with abundant oxygen vacancies first by a surfactant-assisted solvothermal method.59 Due to selective surfactant adsorption, the prepared BiOCl-OV exposed a high percentage of {001} faces (Fig. 12a). Subsequently, the ion exchange process has been adopted, which not only introduces Br atoms, but also creates cavities in the crystal structure of Br-doped BiOCl-OV (Br-BiOCl-OV). The TEM image shown in Fig. 12b confirms that the sheet-like pattern of the pristine BiOCl-OV is well preserved. On the other hand, the HRTEM image indicates many cavities with a diameter of several nanometers in Fig. 12c, indicating that the surface of Br-BiOCl-OV is partially etched in the ion exchange. When the optimized Br-BiOCl-OV was used as a photocatalyst for N2 light fixation, it showed an ammonia generation rate of 6.3 μmol h−1 under visible light irradiation, which was much higher than that of the original BiOCl-OV (4.1 μmol h−1). As shown in Fig. 12d, no significant amount of NH3 is detected when Ar is used instead of N2, indicating the NH3 production solely comes from the N2 reactant. In addition, the cycling stability test indicates that Br-BiOCl-OV shows good stability, and no obvious efficiency reduction is observed after reusing 5 times (Fig. 12e). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that due to the introduction of Br atoms and oxygen vacancies, the nitrogen bond length of N2 adsorbed on Br-BiOCl-OV is greater than the length of the N bond adsorbed on the original BiOCl-OV, which is attributed to the effectively activated NN. According to the DFT calculation shown in Fig. 12f, the N2 adsorbed on the BiOCl-OV shows a bond length of 1.173 Å, which is greater than that of the triple bond (1.078 Å) of free N2, but lower than that of the double bond (1.201 Å) of diazene, indicating the effective activation of the inert N2 due to the back transfer of charges from OVs to the adsorbed N2.

4.4 Heterostructure construction

Fig. 13 shows different types of heterostructures based on bismuth-based photocatalysts reported so far toward N2 fixation, including those loaded with cocatalysts, type I heterojunctions, type II heterojunctions, and Z-scheme heterojunctions. Among them, semiconductor heterojunctions refer to the composites formed by combining two semiconductors with different band structures. After the recombination, different semiconductor materials cause structural or property changes, and typically exhibit new properties that are not available in single phase materials. For example, if the wide bandgap semiconductor is modified with a narrow bandgap semiconductor or two kinds of narrow bandgap semiconductors are combined, the light response range of the photocatalyst will be effectively expanded and the light energy utilization rate will be improved. Therefore, the construction of a heterojunction is effective in boosting the performances of bismuth-based photocatalysts. These different heterostructures will be introduced in detail in this section.
 Fig. 13  Illustration of the construction of different heterostructures toward photocatalytic nitrogen reduction to ammonia. 
Cocatalysts can provide reducing active sites, capture charge carriers, reduce activation energy to catalyze surface reactions, and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby effectively improving the efficiency of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. In order to maximize the function of the cocatalysts, the cocatalyst and the semiconductor photocatalyst should have compatible lattice and electronic structures, and a suitable band energy level. Xiao et al. synthesized (BiO)2CO3 modified with gold nanoparticles for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation and showed excellent catalytic performance.60 The strong interaction between surface plasmon resonance excitation and resonance photons can significantly improve the utilization of solar energy.85 Due to the plasmon resonance on the Ag surface, obvious traps are formed in the ultra-thin Ag-δ-Bi2O3 sheet, which not only inhibits the recombination of electron–hole pairs, but also generates light-induced oxygen vacancies under irradiation. At the same time, the transfer of photogenerated electrons from gold nanoparticles to the conduction band of the semiconductor can effectively enhance charge separation. The Ag-modified δ-Bi2O3 photocatalyst has a multi-layer ultra-thin structure, suitable absorption edges and many exposed surface parts, and exhibits effective photocatalytic activity for the generation of NH4+ under visible light irradiation.61
Guo et al. designed a 2D/2D ZnIn2S4/BiOCl heterostructure through in situ solvothermal treatment to overcome the poor response of BiOCl to visible light.62 Based on the 2D/2D feather of the substrate, carrier transportation of ZnIn2S4 is promoted. Zhou et al. adopted a strategy of in situ reduction of bismuth to synthesize oriented Bi2WO6.63 The metal Bi is used as a lattice junction to make Bi2WO6 highly oriented on the lattice structure. This directional structure obviously provides a tightly connected interface and transfer channels for photo-generated carrier separation, resulting in effective nitrogen fixation. Graphene quantum dots have the advantages of high biocompatibility, low toxicity, and high water solubility. Fei et al. used graphene quantum dots and Bi2WO6 for the first time to construct a heterostructure for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.64 The introduction of graphene quantum dots can efficiently separate photo-generated electrons and holes. The catalytic performance of the composite is 33.8 and 8.88 times as high as that of pure graphene quantum dots and Bi2WO6, respectively. Zhang et al. decorated Bi2WO6 with cyclized polyacrylonitrile (c-PAN), which serve as active sites for absorption and activation of N2 because the pyridinic N in c-PAN can transfer into the unsaturated state to bind with small molecules and donate electrons.65 The hybrid photocatalyst achieved superior nitrogen fixation performance (160 μmol h−1 g−1). To improve the nitrogen adsorption efficiency, Liu et al. designed hydrophilic-hydrophobic Bi4O5Br2/ZIF-8 composites.66 Because ZIF-8 is hydrophobic, it is different from other photocatalysts that can only utilize nitrogen dissolved in water. When nitrogen reduction occurs in aqueous solution, gas phase N2 can be directly transferred to the photocatalytic reaction interface to form a three-phase interface, thereby promoting photocatalytic performance.
Rong et al. reported typical type I heterostructures composed of Bi2Te3 and BiOCl.67 Under ultraviolet irradiation, the effective ammonia release rate over Bi2Te3/BiOCl reaches up to 315.9 μmol L−1 h−1. By analyzing the band gap and reduction potential of the two components, the electrons generated by BiOCl are attributed to N2 light fixation, while the photogenerated charges generated by Bi2Te3 excitation effectively inhibit the photo-generated hole electron recombination of BiOCl.
In the type II band alignment, the position of the valence band and conduction band of semiconductor B is higher than that of semiconductor A, and the steps in the conductive strip and the valence band are oriented in the same direction. Importantly, the difference in chemical potential between semiconductors A and B results in band bending at the junction interface. The bending causes the built-in magnetic field to drive the photogenerated electrons and holes to move in opposite directions, resulting in the spatial separation of electrons and holes on different sides of the heterojunction. Therefore, the formation of type II heterojunctions is an effective method to improve the efficiency of charge separation and can improve the photocatalytic nitrogen reduction efficiency. Most of the heterojunction photocatalysts reported in the literature are of this type.
The design and construction of type II heterostructure catalysts can significantly improve the efficiency of nitrogen fixation of the catalyst. The semiconductors and functional species play a synergistic role in effectively absorbing visible light solar energy, and the heterostructure can promote the separation and transformation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.86 For example, Gao and co-workers reported the fabrication of AgCl/δ-Bi2O3 nanosheets with a uniform thickness of approximately 2.7 nm by an economical hydrothermal controllable precipitation approach.68 The obtained AgCl/δ-Bi2O3 composite exhibited enhanced activity in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. This phenomenon can be attributed to the formation of a p–n heterojunction structure of AgCl/δ-Bi2O3 and provided abundant electrons for the reduction of N2 in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. In addition, large specific areas obtained by ultrathin 2D nanosheets induce the increase of active sites on the surface of catalysts along with ultimate two-dimensional anisotropy which can shorten the charge migration distance and improve the efficiency of electron–hole pair separation. Surface defects as well as disordered surface structure will also be beneficial to improve the performance of photocatalysis (Fig. 14a). From the TEM images of AgCl/δ-Bi2O3 (Fig. 14b), as-prepared 3% AgCl/δ-Bi2O3 displayed a 2D ultrathin structure, and 2D ultrathin nanosheets looked like squares with a length of approximately 250 nm. In the HRTEM images of AgCl/δ-Bi2O3 (Fig. 14c), AgCl particles could be observed as dispersed on the surface of δ-Bi2O3 thick sheets. According to Fig. 14d and e, as-prepared samples exhibited greatly increased capacity for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation, and with extension of the reaction time the yield of NH4+ concentration increased linearly. Among them, 3% AgCl/δ-Bi2O3 demonstrated superior NH4+ concentration (Fig. 14d) and a high rate of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation (Fig. 14e). Xue et al.69 used a simple solution phase method to prepare heterojunctions based on n-type Bi2MoO6 nanorods and p-type BiOBr nanosheets (Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr) with oxygen-rich vacancies. The surface of n-type Bi2MoO6 nanorods is covered by ultra-thin p-type OV-BiOBr nanosheets, which produces a nanostructured p–n junction, showing a wide range of light absorption and effective photogenerated charge separation/transportation rate. In addition, the hierarchical structure of the Bi2MoO6/OV-BiOBr heterojunction with a larger specific surface area can provide more active sites for nitrogen fixation. The large number of oxygen vacancies on the surface of OV-BiOBr nanosheets is very conducive to the adsorption and activation of inert N2 molecules. It can also be used as an electron trap to locate electrons for N2 fixation reactions. Xu et al. prepared a Bi2S3/BiOBr hybrid structure by an ion exchange method.70 Due to the narrow band gap of Bi2S3 and the staggered band structure of the Bi2S3/BiOBr hybrid band, the hybrid structure has enhanced light trapping ability and improved transmission efficiency of photo-generated carriers. Another example of the type II heterojunction of the Ag/AgI-δ-Bi2O3 photocatalyst has also been constructed by a simple hydrothermal and in situ photodeposition method.71 The nanocomposite exhibits excellent photocatalytic nitrogen fixation performance without any sacrificial agent in water, which is 420 μmol L−1 g−1 h−1. The introduction of Ag/AgI nanoparticles caused morphological changes of δ-Bi2O3, higher oxygen vacancy concentrations, and the construction of plasmon-sensitized heterojunctions, which improved light absorption and improved charge carrier separation and the strong N2 absorption and activation are the reasons for the excellent photocatalytic performance of Ag/AgI-δ-Bi2O3.

Artificial heterogeneous Z-scheme photocatalytic systems that mimic natural photosynthesis can overcome the shortcomings of single-component photocatalysts, enabling photocatalysts to have a wide absorption range, long-term stability, and high charge separation efficiency, and the redox capacity has great potential for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.87 Chen et al. synthesized an Ag/AgBr/Bi4O5Br2 nanocomposite through a combination of hydrothermal and ion exchange programs for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.72 The charge separation efficiency was significantly improved, which was achieved by the directed electron migration between AgBr and Bi4O5Br2 in the Z-scheme mechanism. Ag nanoparticles formed in situ by the decomposition of AgBr act as a bridge for charge migration. Although improved light absorption has also been observed, it is believed that increased charge separation is a major factor affecting photocatalytic performance. Shang et al. deposited BiOCl nanosheets on the surface of β-Bi2O3 and studied their photocatalytic reduction activity.73 The composite material exhibits excellent photocatalytic reduction activity. Under xenon lamp irradiation, the NH3 yield of the β-Bi2O3/BiOCl composite is about 25 times that of pure BiOCl. The results of photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show that the formation of β-Bi2O3/BiOCl heterojunctions helps to reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The Z-scheme mechanism explains the process of photocatalytic reduction activity on composites. This is because that if β-Bi2O3/BiOCl forms a type II heterostructure, photo-generated electrons are transferred from the CB of BiOCl to that of β-Bi2O3, and holes in the VB of β-Bi2O3 are transferred to that of BiOCl. The electrons in the CB of β-Bi2O3 cannot react with N2 to generate NH3 based on thermodynamics, because the CB edge potential of β-Bi2O3 is more positive than N2/NH3 (−0.28 eV) at pH = 7 (Fig. 15a). Therefore, the Z-scheme mechanism has been proposed to better explain the results of photocatalytic reduction (Fig. 15b). Ultra-thin 2D Ag/AgBr-δ-Bi2O3 was prepared by a hydrothermal method, which showed excellent photocatalytic nitrogen fixation ability under visible light conditions.74 The existence of a large number of available surface active sites in the two-dimensional ultra-thin nanosheets and the surface plasmon resonance of Ag species can promote the carrier separation in the heterojunction. The catalytic mechanism of 2D Ag/AgBr-δ-Bi2O3 materials could be explained by the formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction to ammonia offers a potential alternative technology to the traditional Haber–Bosch process for the sustainable future, which, however, demands innovative breakthroughs in the design of efficient photocatalysts at this stage to make it a pillar technology for artificial ammonia production. Bismuth-based photocatalysts have proved to be promising candidates for photocatalytic N2-to-ammonia conversion. We have reviewed recent research endeavors on exploring bismuth-based photocatalysts for the target photocatalytic ammonia production. In addition to these laudable achievements, there is still a wide scope to further expand the availability of this class of photocatalysts for solar ammonia synthesis, which requires the combination of deep insights from microscopic mechanistic investigations and catalytic system engineering.
It should be recognized that the amount of ammonia produced over the reported photocatalysts is very small so far, which is also the case for bismuth-based compounds. In this context, the potential experimental artefacts interfering the reliable analysis of photocatalytic N2-to-ammonia conversion should be comprehensively considered and excluded. Experimentally, a protocol for rigorous methodology to minimize the contamination interference should be proposed to make a convincing and reliable conclusion. On the one hand, although ion chromatography has relatively low detection limits and affords more reliable results, the most popular way for ammonia quantification is the colorimetric method due to the low cost and easy accessibility of instruments. However, the experimental parameters of the reaction, such as the addition of alcohols as sacrificial agents, the pH of the reaction system, the presence of anions/cations, and the color development period, have a significant effect on the measured absorbance, thereby affecting the experimental results for the quantitative ammonia detection. These factors underline the need for a rigorous experimentation for color development. On the other hand, ammonia is ubiquitous in the laboratory environment and is a common contaminant in chemicals and gases, which tends to accumulate on common glassware surfaces or into aqueous solutions over time.88 In this regard, a steady production of ammonia over a prolonged reaction time together with control experiments in the dark and/or in the absence of photocatalysts is useful to confirm that the detected ammonia is produced by the reduction of the supplied N2 gas. In addition, it should be noted that photocatalysts themselves could also be the potential contamination sources by directly releasing ammonia or through the reduction of residual NO3−,89,90 including those bismuth-based photocatalysts prepared using the precursors of Bi(NO3)3. Against this background, it is recommended to carry out the control experiment in an argon atmosphere to investigate the contamination from catalysts. Another strong evidence to a catalytic process is the turnover number (TON) (>1), the calculation of which is highly suggested in reports. The most unequivocal evidence to the reaction of photocatalytic N2-to-ammonia conversion is the quantitative isotope measurement by making essential use of 15N2, where the produced 15NH3 is close to that with 14N2 within experimental error. Since extraneous ammonia sources are inevitable in every lab, subtracting the background ammonia can be considered as the maneuverable and feasible practice to identify the photocatalytic performances before 15N2 isotope studies.
Although researchers have proposed possible reaction mechanisms through experimental investigations and theoretical calculations, a deep understanding of the big picture of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation to ammonia is still challenging. It is known that each reaction process has a rate-limiting step, and the performance of photocatalysts can be better improved by overcoming the enthalpy of the rate-limiting step. However, it should be realized that an improved catalyst design could simultaneously result in multiple modifications of the physicochemical properties of photocatalysts. For example, the introduction of oxygen vacancies over bismuth oxyhalides has been proved to not only enhance the adsorption and activation of N2, but also increase the light absorption capability and electronic conductivity, thereby facilitating the generation and spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.91 It is noteworthy that these multifarious factors can cooperatively contribute to the activity enhancement, making it difficult to pinpoint the kinetic bottleneck for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation to ammonia. In this regard, ingenious design of photocatalysts with a spatially decoupled light absorption unit and surface active sites is highly desirable, which would make it possible to deconvolute the contributions of catalytic activity and light absorption to the overall photocatalytic performance of N2-to-ammonia conversion. With the objective understanding of the critical contributions of different factors to the photoactivity of N2 fixation to ammonia, it is expected that bismuth-based composite photocatalysts with integrated functional components at a system level to accelerate the progress of nitrogen photoreduction to ammonia can be rationally designed. Meanwhile, the competition between nitrogen reduction and hydrogen evolution is a challenge for efficient photocatalytic ammonia production. Consequently, of particular interest is the introduction of cocatalysts with a low activation barrier for photocatalytic nitrogen reduction. In this realm, computational investigations could be useful to screen the potential candidates and reduce experimental work. It is desirable that the cocatalyst has a good compatibility with bismuth-based photocatalysts to facilitate the interfacial charge transfer for the separation and utilization of photogenerated electrons for N2-to-ammonia conversion.
2D materials as cocatalysts have attracted intensive research interest due to their attractive properties.92 First of all, as cocatalysts, 2D materials can enable a large intimate interface with photoactive components, which is favorable for the separation of electron–hole pairs and enhancing the stability of photocatalysts by alleviating agglomeration and photocorrosion. Secondly, the synergy between 2D cocatalysts and semiconductors would improve the utilization of solar energy due to the expanded light absorption range. Inspired by these intriguing properties, it is expected that the construction of bismuth-based photocatalysts with 2D cocatalysts will promote the development of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. Materials science could also be inspired by biomimetics. For instance, leaves can serve as tiny solar collectors and energy converter cells, which constitute a natural photocatalytic system. The high surface area at the macroscale, 3D porous frame structure, and interconnection of thylakoid cylindrical stacks in chloroplasts enable these structures to efficiently capture visible light photons.93 The rational design of bismuth-based photocatalysts can be benefited from these biomimetic structures and combining biological nitrogenase with bismuth-based photo-absorbers may be an efficient strategy for N2-to-ammonia conversion under solar irradiation.
At the same time, there are also plentiful opportunities for the optimization of photocatalytic systems from the consideration of both further improving the photocatalytic efficacy and facilitating practical applications. The light irradiation manner, running water to cool the reaction system, and N2 gas flow control can all delicately affect the experiment. To intensify the light irradiation for improving the photonic efficiency, researchers can consider annular, optical fiber, and honeycomb monolith reactors.94 On the other hand, the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation reaction generally occurs in a suspended aqueous solution of a single cell, which often suffers from some limitations, such as the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, the re-oxidation of NH3 by the in situ formed reactive oxygen species, the generation of unfavorable byproducts, and the difficulty in subsequent collection of products. Photoelectrochemical cells with a dual-compartment H-cell are promising setups to solve the problems for photochemical nitrogen fixation, and are composed of a photocathode, a photoanode, and an electrolyte.14,95 It has been found that the ammonia yield of the dual-compartment H-cell system is higher than that of the single-cell system.96 In addition, connecting the photocathode compartment with an ammonia absorber is proposed. With a continuous N2 flow as both the feeding stock and the carrier gas, the generated ammonia can be continuously collected in the ammonia absorber, which is of potential for practical applications.
Immobilization of bismuth-based photocatalysts can facilitate the practical application by eliminating the tedious and sophisticated photocatalyst separation processes.97,98 Bismuth-based film photocatalysts integrated with arbitrary substrates can be considered a typical choice, the design of which should systematically engineer: (i) the interfacial interaction between the film photocatalysts and the substrates to ensure the durability for continuous applications; (ii) the light penetration for efficient light–matter interactions to generate photo-electrons for ammonia production; and (iii) the hydrophilicity of the film photocatalysts and the porous structure to facilitate the mass transfer of reactants (N2) and products, similar to other sustainable technologies.99 In terms of 15N2 isotope studies, it should also be acknowledged that the high price and small volume of 15N2 gas bottles make such measurements challenging.89 Furthermore, the low activity of the photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction requires a continuous supply of 15N2 gas for a period of several hours typically. In this circumstance, it would be useful to equip the reactor with the setup for gas circulation, which can reduce the cost of the critical 15N2 isotope studies.
While most of the reports target the enhancement of photocatalytic N2-to-ammonia conversion efficiency in the presence of sacrificial agents of holes, relatively limited research attention is focused on the development of photocatalysts for the conversion of N2 with pure water to ammonia and molecular oxygen according to the reaction of 2N2 + 6H2O → 4NH3 + 3O2, which is the ultimate goal of photocatalysis to utilize the solar energy yet remains a challenge. In this regard, in addition to the efficient reduction of N2, another critical factor affecting the efficiency of the overall photocatalytic reaction of N2 with H2O is the water oxidation to O2 by photogenerated holes. Considering that the transfer of photogenerated holes from the bulk of photocatalysts to the surface is sluggish and the multicharge transfer process of water oxidation is a potential rate-limiting step,100 the synergy between both half-reactions of photogenerated electrons and holes to achieve an efficient overall photocatalytic reaction of N2 with H2O would prefer spatially isolated active sites for N2 reduction and water oxidation. This determines that high reaction efficiency would be difficult to achieve with a single photocatalyst. The key to research in this aspect may be concentrated on how to select two suitable semiconductors with one being bismuth-based polyoxometalate for water oxidation, and assemble them into an efficient Z-scheme structure based on the thermodynamic and kinetic requirements.
Notably, we are standing at the starting point for the understanding of this emerging field at this stage. Despite the above remarks on the future research directions of photocatalytic N2-to-ammonia conversion over bismuth-based photocatalysts, it is believed that joint efforts from materials scientists, chemists, and engineers hold the key for realizing meaningful results and an exciting future can be expected. With continuous efforts from a diverse range of scientific communities and accomplishments in years to come, the opportunities will be comprehensively explored and the big picture of solar ammonia is expected to be unveiled.
