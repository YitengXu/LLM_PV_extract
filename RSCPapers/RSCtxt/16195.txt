    , Accepted 24th January 2023First published on 24th January 2023AbstractConventional one-step water electrolyzers generate H2 accompanied by O2 evolution, and may cause gas mixing and high cell voltage inputs. Herein, using the potassium ion battery material of K0.5MnO2-Ti as a mediator, we effectively decoupled the H2 and O2 evolution of alkaline water electrolysis temporally, thereby achieving a membrane-free pathway for H2 production. As a mediator electrode for charge storage, the K0.5MnO2-Ti exhibited a stable capacity of 100 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 owing to the reversible K-ion insertion/extraction mechanism. The decoupled water electrolysis device exhibited the step voltages for hydrogen and oxygen production of 1.02 and 0.57 V at 5 mA, respectively. A nearly unity Faradaic efficiency and sustained production of pure H2 has been demonstrated at a constant current density. We anticipate that this mediator demonstrated here may provide a route for the practical application of the decoupling strategy.
Hydrogen has a high mass energy density, which is 3 times that of gasoline, and is a critical feedstock for the chemical industry.1–5 Electrolytic water splitting represents an important way to generate clean hydrogen.6–9 Water splitting is generally limited by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), because of its more sluggish kinetics compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).10–12 Although the membrane is generally utilized for gas separation, the simultaneous generation of H2 and O2 in the same cell may induce gas mixing issues, especially at low operating current density or elevated pressures.13,14 In addition, producing green hydrogen requires renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, to power the water electrolysis. However, they are generally intermittent, requiring a proper means of buffering the fluctuation.15,16
To address the critical challenges intrinsically confronted by conventional water electrolysis, various innovative approaches have been proposed. One promising route is chronologically and/or spatially decoupling the HER and OER.17 In order to take the production of H2 and O2 apart in time or in place, redox mediators (either solid-state or dissolved in solution) are generally employed, which brings along an additional reversible electrochemical reaction pairing with the HER or OER.18–20 Therefore, the overall water-splitting reaction is divided into a reduction half-reaction and an oxidation half-reaction.21–24 Such a decoupled strategy can solve the limitations faced by traditional electrolytic water splitting, and make the water-splitting reaction more flexible. For instance, the HER can be separated from the OER to avoid gas mixing and the use of an expensive membrane. The HER and OER can work at different currents to fit different renewable energy sources.25,26
On the other hand, alkaline electrolyzers are the most widely used systems for water electrolysis due to the fast OER kinetics and the compatibility with electrocatalysts. The development of decoupled alkaline water electrolysis is attractive. For instance, Chen et al. used Ni(OH)2 as a solid-state redox mediator to decouple alkaline water electrolysis in 1 M KOH, showing high reversibility.27 An aqueous dual electrolyte (acid-base electrolyte separated with an anion exchange membrane) was used to reduce the input voltage, in which the OER electrode and the FeOx mediator electrode were placed in the alkaline electrolyte, and the HER electrode was placed in the acid electrolyte.28 Na0.44MnO2 was used to decouple chlor-alkali electrolysis. The NaOH solution was applied in the HER cell, and the Na+ extraction reaction occurred during the HER process to form Na0.44−xMnO2. Then, the Na0.44−xMnO2 electrode was transferred to the chlorine evolution cell for the chlorine evolution process, in which Na0.44−xMnO2 accepted Na+ to turn back to Na0.44MnO2 for the next HER process.29 It is worth noting that there are limited redox mediators for decoupled alkaline water electrolysis at present. In this regard, alkaline metal battery electrodes such as potassium ion battery cathode materials can be potential alternatives, where the redox reaction can be realized through the insertion and extraction of K ions, probably demonstrating a great advantage over traditional redox mediators in reaction kinetics.
Intercalated transition metal oxides with a layered structure have been extensively studied in electrochemistry owing to their wide interlayer spacing, high theoretical capacities, and environmental friendliness.30 Among them, layered K0.5MnO2 (KMO) was a good cathode electrode for K-ion insertion/extraction.31 Meanwhile, its redox potential lies between the HER and OER initial potentials, indicating the ability for decoupled water splitting. Element doping can further improve the ionic conductivity and cycling stability of the intercalated transition metal oxides.32 Herein, we introduce the application of titanium doped K0.5MnO2 (KMO-Ti) obtained from a simple sol–gel method with high yield as a solid-state redox mediator to decouple the HER and OER in an alkaline electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 1, the H2 production step involves the cathodic H2O reduction and K-ion extraction of KMO-Ti. The subsequent oxygen production involves the K-ion insertion reaction and anodic H2O oxidization. This decoupled process is also accompanied by the valence state change of Mn3+ and Mn4+. In such a configuration, steps 1 and 2 can be theoretically cycled with high stability.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of hydrogen/oxygen production from decoupled water electrolysis. 
The crystal structures of KMO-Ti and KMO were investigated by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. KMO exhibited a typical P3-type layered structure (Fig. 2a). MnO6 and KO6 octahedrons were alternately stacked into a layered structure. The MnO6 layers were tightly packed, and the KO6 layers were misaligned (Fig. 2b). Ti doping didn’t change the crystal structure. The dislocation of KO6 was conducive to the insertion and extraction of K ions, which was consistent with its rapid charging and discharging characteristics.33 The morphology of KMO-Ti was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and KMO-Ti exhibited an irregular bulk morphology (Fig. 2c). According to the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analysis, the uniform distribution of K, Mn, O and Ti was confirmed in the KMO-Ti particles (Fig. 2d). For the KMO-Ti sample with a Ti feed ratio of 3 wt%, the accurate Ti ratio was determined to be 2.89 wt% by the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer.

The electrochemical performances of the as-prepared KMO-Ti and KMO were measured in an alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH) by a three-electrode system. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of the KMO and KMO-Ti electrodes (1 cm2, 5 mg cm−2) were investigated at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, which revealed the pairs of redox peaks at −0.16 V/0.24 V and −0.1 V/0.19 V (vs. Hg/HgO), confirming the high electrochemical reversibility (Fig. 3a). Considering the CV curves of the two materials, the difference between the oxidation peak and reduction peak of KMO-Ti was smaller, indicating that KMO-Ti had higher redox reversibility and rapid reaction, with less polarization in the reaction process.18 This may be attributed to the factor that Ti doping can stabilize the crystal structure and promote the potassium ion transfer kinetics.34,35 The linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) data of the HER (Fig. 3a, green line) and OER (Fig. 3a, blue line) were also measured using the commercial Pt electrode and RuO2/IrO2 electrode, respectively. It is obvious that the redox potential windows of both KMO-Ti and KMO were located between the onset potentials of the HER and OER. The kinetics of the KMO-Ti electrode were further investigated by CV measurements at scan rates from 1 to 30 mV s−1 (Fig. S1, ESI†). The peak current (iP) and the scan rate (v) obeyed the power law relationship (iP = avb, where a and b are constants). The b values for the anodic peaks and cathodic peaks were 0.72 and 0.73, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†), indicating the fast kinetics of the KMO-Ti electrode.

(c) Cycling performance and the corresponding Coulombic efficiency of the KMO-Ti electrode at 0.1 A g−1 for 100 cycles. (d) XPS patterns of Mn 2p of KMO-Ti at different charge/discharge states. 
The rate performances of KMO electrodes with different Ti doping concentrations have been tested to explore the effect of Ti doping. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), Ti doping significantly improved the redox capacities of KMO during K-ion insertion/extraction, and 3 wt% Ti doping was determined to be the optimal one. The rate performance of the KMO-Ti electrode was further investigated at various rates. As shown in Fig. 3b, the electrode delivered reversible capacities of 200, 163, 128, 101, 80, and 69 mA h g−1 at different current rates of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 300 mA g−1, respectively. When the current density returned to 10 mA g−1, the capacity of 200 mA h g−1 could be completely recovered, demonstrating the excellent reversibility and stability of the KMO-Ti electrode. The cycling performance of the KMO-Ti electrode was also tested at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. 3c). After 100 cycles, a near 100% coulombic efficiency and a stable capacity of 100 mA h g−1 were achieved, indicating a highly reversible and stable K-ion insertion/extraction process.
To validate the change in the valence state of manganese in the KMO-Ti electrode, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was employed. It was clear that Mn in the as-prepared KMO-Ti has trivalent and tetravalent states. When the KMO-Ti electrode was charged to 0.58 V, the Mn3+ was oxidized to Mn4+, which was consistent with the expected results. Upon being continuously discharged to −0.4 V, manganese ions were reduced to Mn3+ (Fig. 3d). Hence Mn is the active center of the electrochemical reaction, and its valence state changes during the charging and discharging process. We also compared the performances of the KMO-Ti electrode with those of the published relevant works. As demonstrated in Table S1 (ESI†), there are fewer reports on decoupled alkaline electrolytic water. Our work reported a novel redox mediator of KMO-Ti, which can provide a unique K+ intercalation and de-intercalation redox mechanism with considerable specific capacity in an alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the decoupled alkaline water electrolyzer exhibited a lower voltage-input for H2 generation than most reports. Therefore, such kind of material is likely to be an effective redox mediator for decoupled water electrolysis.
The decoupled alkaline water electrolysis cell without the membrane was assembled by a commercial Pt-coated Ti mesh electrode (1.5 × 2 cm2; the mass loading of Pt was 2.1 mg cm−2), a commercial RuO2/IrO2-coated Ti mesh electrode (1.5 × 2 cm2; the mass loading of RuO2/IrO2 was 1.0 mg cm−2), and a KMO-Ti film electrode (1.5 × 2 cm2; the mass loading of KMO-Ti was 30 mg cm−2) (Fig. S4, ESI†). The performance of this decoupled cell was investigated in 1 M KOH solution by chronopotentiometry measurements under various applied currents (2–200 mA). The voltage vs. time curves recorded at the current of 5 mA with the step time of 600 s are shown in Fig. 4a. Step 1 (HER process Video, ESI†) exhibited a cell voltage of 1.02 V, which came from the potential difference between the cathodic potential of H2O reduction (H2O → H2) and the anodic potential of KMO-Ti oxidization (K0.5MnO2-Ti → K0.5−xMnO2-Ti). In Step 2 (OER process, Video, ESI†), the cell voltage was 0.57 V, arising from the potential difference between the anodic oxidation of H2O (OH− → O2) and the cathodic reduction of K0.5−xMnO2-Ti (K0.5−xMnO2-Ti → K0.5MnO2-Ti). These results led to an overall voltage of 1.59 V for decoupled water electrolysis. This value was close to that of the conventional membrane-free Pt-RuO2/IrO2 electrolyzer (1.54 V, Fig. S5, ESI†). For comparison, the same test was investigated using KMO as the redox mediator. The voltages of both steps were slightly higher than those of KMO-Ti, which was consistent with the CV result (Fig. 4b). The voltages of the decoupled water electrolysis at different currents from 2 to 200 mA were recorded in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†), which further illustrated the operational flexibility. Notably, compared with the sum of the two step voltages decoupled by KMO-Ti, the voltage required for direct electrolysis of water was reduced by about 0.6 V at the current of 200 mA. This could be ascribed to the fact that the mediator electrode with a limited mass loading was overcharged during the chronopotentiometry charging process, which increased the voltage of the electrode material and thus obtained a larger decoupled voltage. We further increased the mass loading of KMO-Ti from 30 mg cm−2 to 60 mg cm−2, and it can be seen in Fig. S8 (ESI†) that the sum of voltages required by the two steps at 200 mA was close to that required by direct water electrolysis.

(c) The stability performance of the separate H2/O2 generation at a current of 5 mA with a step time of 600 s. (d) Measured H2 and O2 amounts using the drainage method, and the lines represent the gas evolution with 100% faradaic efficiency. The mass loading of KMO-Ti is about 30 mg cm−2. 
The cycling performance of this decoupled water electrolytic cell was first investigated with an applied small current of 5 mA and a step time of 600 s (Fig. 4c). After 100 consecutive cycles, the cell voltages of Step 1 and Step 2 exhibited no obvious change, indicating the excellent stability for decoupled hydrogen and oxygen production. The stability test under a high current of 100 mA also indicated the good stability of this system (Fig. S9, ESI†). The purity of the gas produced by the decoupled water electrolysis was evaluated by gas chromatography (GC) (Fig. S10, ESI†). Before the measurement, Ar was purged for 10 min to remove the air in the reaction cell. Only H2 was detected in Step 1. After Step 1, another purification step was performed to remove H2 in the system. Then, O2 was detected by GC analysis during Step 2. The decoupled water electrolyzer using KMO-Ti as a redox mediator could directly produce high-purity H2 and O2 without using a membrane, which was convenient for collection and further utilization. The Faraday efficiencies for H2 and O2 production were determined to be 99.1% and 99.5%, respectively (Fig. 4d).
In summary, we introduced K0.5MnO2-Ti, a potassium ion battery material, as a solid-state redox mediator for decoupling H2 and O2 production in alkaline water electrolysis. The K0.5MnO2-Ti exhibited a reversible capacity of 100 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 100 cycles. The redox reaction of the K0.5MnO2-Ti mediator involved K-ion insertion/extraction accompanied by the valence state change of the Mn ions. The decoupled HER and OER can be sequentially driven by applying cell voltages of only 1.02 and 0.57 V at 5 mA. Meanwhile, the decoupled cell showed good operational flexibility at different currents, making it promising to fit various renewable energy inputs. This work demonstrates that combining hydrogen production with potassium ion battery technology can be an attractive means for renewable energy conversion and storage.
