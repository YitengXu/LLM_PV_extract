    , Accepted 17th February 2016First published on 17th February 2016AbstractCubic perovskite BaSnO3 (BSO) is an important photoelectron transporting material due to its electronic structure that competes with TiO2 in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Separately, BSO/TiCl4 treated and BSO/scattering layer photoelectrodes have been used in DSCs that effectively increase the photoexcited charge carriers collection resulting in superior photovoltaic performance. In the present work, the different TiCl4 treatment time (1, 3 and 5 min), different scattering layer (tetragonal anatase TiO2 and hexagonal wurtzite ZnO) and different combinations thereof are successfully used on BSO nanocuboids/nanoparticle morphological structure photoelectrodes, and then we systematically inspected their performance in DSCs. Under the optimized conditions, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.88% is obtained by a BSO/TiCl4 treated photoanode. Furthermore, the BSO photoanodes made using a scattering layer such as anatase TiO2 and hexagonal ZnO i.e., BSO/anatase TiO2 and BSO/hexagonal ZnO, exhibited PCEs of 1.14% and 1.25% respectively. In the end, one of the highest PCEs (5.68%) was achieved using BSO/TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer photoanode. Another photoelectrode such as BSO/TiCl4 treated/ZnO scattering layer exhibited a PCE of 4.28% that is also higher than the BSO/TiCl4 treated/BSO scattering layer photoanodes. Electron lifetime versus current density studies illustrate the stability of the BSO photoelectrode in DSCs. From the observed results, it is realized that BSO is one of the most important future technological materials.
1. Introduction
The pioneering investigation of the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) by O'Regan and Grätzel in the nineties has stimulated special attention among nanotechnologists owing to its affordable fabrication process and that it is considered as a promising next-generation solar cell candidate according to its remarkable PCE.1–3 Typically, DSCs are fabricated by the injection of liquid electrolyte between sandwiched working (dye loaded large band-gap semiconductor) and counter (platinum) electrodes. The overall performance of the fabricated device mainly depends on the following processes (i) amount of dye loading (ii) light scattering capacity (iii) photoinduced charge separation (iv) interfacial charge transfer and (v) recombination rate.3–8 Hence it is realized that the superb physical and chemical properties of photoanode materials with expected particle size (or) morphological structures play a key role for controlling the above-mentioned points in DSCs. In order to achieve higher PCEs, numerous metal oxide semiconductor systems have been investigated.9–11 Until now the wide-bandgap TiO2 mesoporous morphological structure semiconductor is a most convincing photoanode material for DSCs.3,12
So far, the relevant investigations have mainly focused on either modifying the TiO2 photoelectrode or choosing other components such as liquid electrolyte and/or dye molecules. Recently, one of the record PCEs (∼12%) has been achieved by using a porphyrin-sensitized meso-porous TiO2 photoanode and a cobalt redox electrolyte solution.1 On the other hand, other metal oxides such as ZnO,13–16 SnO2,17,18 and Nb2O519 have been investigated during the search for alternatives, but none of them could exhibit comparable device performance. These reports opened a new door of searching ternary metal oxide semiconductors including Zn2SnO4, ZnTiO3, SrTiO3, etc.; the reason may be due to their ionization potential and electron affinity being easily modified via controlling the bond (ionic (or) covalent) energy of valence electrons with respect to altering their atomic composition during a synthetic strategy.2,20 Hence, a few researchers have been investigating ternary metal oxides as photoanodes in DSCs where an efficiency of <6% has been achieved in Zn2SnO4.21–23
Recently, perovskite BaSnO3 has demonstrated excellent contributions in various applications including high-temperature superconductivity,24,25 colossal magnetoresistance,26,27 electrochemical activity,28 ferromagnetism,29,30 ferroelectricity,31–33 sensors and multiferroics.34,35 The generation of photoelectrons can be easily controlled by the tuning of atomic composition or the addition of impurities into the Ba or Sn site.3,20,36,37 Different thicknesses of BSO layer photoelectrodes and various dye molecules have been successfully used in DSCs and achieved reasonable PCEs.2,20,38,39
Electron transporting materials in DSCs are known to have a high transmittance to visible light. Therefore they exhibit a poor scattering effect with respect to their wide bandgap and small particle size (20–30 nm).40 One of the possible ways to overcome this was by introducing an optical scattering layer onto a photoelectrode, which increases the lifetime of the incident light. This new route has been recently explored with regard to the impact of such optical scattering layers on the working electrode and the corresponding device performances were investigated.41,42 Therefore, a 4–5 μm thick layer film, consisting of large size nanoparticles or nanopores coated on the top of the electron-transporting material, has increased the PCE.43,44 A TiO2 layer with a particle size of 400 nm also acts as a light scattering layer which effectively increases the incident light energy path, resulting in improved photocurrent density.45 Furthermore, the spherically shaped TiO2 nanoparticles have also been used as a scattering layer for improving PCE.46 In addition, hierarchal ZnO parallelopipeds and cubic CeO2 nanostructures have been introduced as a scattering layer.3,47 Hence it is empirically realized that the BSO photoelectrode based DSCs are still in their infancy and there still exists many opportunities.
Therefore, the main aim of the present work is increasing the PCE of DSCs using modified BSO photoelectrodes. Initially, the BSO nanocuboids/nanoparticles morphological structure has been synthesized using a co-precipitation method. Subsequently, the BSO was coated onto an FTO substrate and used as a photoanode in a DSC. The TiCl4 treated, scattering layer (TiO2 and ZnO) and different combinations thereof are applied to BSO coated FTO substrate and are then employed as photoelectrodes in DSCs. Results show that the TiCl4 treated/scattering layer used on BSO photoelectrodes concurrently increases the life time of incident light and charge collection during device performance, resulting in higher PCE. Because of the young nature of this photoelectrode, the structural and morphological properties of synthesized BSO, BSO/TiCl4 treated, BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer photoanodes and their performance in DSCs have also been reported here.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of BSO nanostructures
Nanocrystalline BSO powder was prepared via a modified oxalate co-precipitation method.48 In brief, 0.1 M of commercially purchased BaCl2 and SnCl2 (high purity (99%)) were separately dissolved in double distilled water and then continuously stirred for 30 min. These separate solutions were slowly mixed together under gentle stirring. Additionally, 0.2 M of aqueous oxalic acid solution was mixed into the above stock solution. The white oxalate precipitate was initially formed and then stirring was continued for another 3 hours. Finally, the reactant solution was washed several times with distilled water and then dried at 110 °C overnight. The obtained BSO was annealed at 900 °C for 3 hours using a muffle furnace.
2.2. Preparation of BSO electrode
BSO nanocrystalline films were prepared on FTO covered glass substrates from a homemade BSO paste via a doctor-blade method.49,50 First, the synthesized BSO was converted into a fine paste by grinding 0.1 g of BSO with distilled water. Then 0.02 ml of acetyl acetone was slowly added. Furthermore, this viscous paste was ground by pestle and mortar for 10 min. Finally, 0.34 ml of distilled water and 20 μl of Triton-X 100 were gradually mixed to give a uniform BSO paste. The resultant paste was coated on FTO substrate by using the doctor blade technique with a cell area of 1 cm2. The coated film was lifted to dry in ambient conditions and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in air.
2.3. Preparation of BSO/TiCl4 treated electrodes
For the TiCl4 treatment, the annealed BSO films were submerged into an aqueous solution of 0.05 M TiCl4 at 50 °C. Different time (1, 3, and 5 min) TiCl4 treated electrodes were prepared and subsequently sintered using a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 30 min.
2.4. Preparation of BSO/scattering layer (BSO/TiO2 and BSO/ZnO) electrodes
TiO2 nanocrystalline paste was purchased from Dyesol, Australia. The ZnO nanoparticles were prepared in our laboratory by using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. Following this process, the ZnO nanoparticles were converted into a fine paste by grinding 0.1 g of ZnO nanoparticles with distilled water and 4 μl acetyl acetone using a pestle and mortar. After that the paste was pestled for 10 min. Furthermore, 0.135 ml of distilled water and 2 μl Triton-X 100 were slowly added into the above paste with continuous mixing resulting in a uniform ZnO paste. The purchased TiO2 paste and prepared ZnO paste were coated on BSO covered FTO substrate via the doctor blade technique. These electrodes (BSO/TiO2 scattering layer and BSO/ZnO scattering layer) were again sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in air.
2.5. Preparation of BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer electrodes
After fabrication of BSO/TiCl4 treated and BSO/scattering layer electrodes, our research team carefully fabricated novel BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer electrodes by directly coating TiO2 and ZnO paste onto BSO/(1, 3 and 5 min) TiCl4 treated FTO substrates via the doctor blade technique.
2.6. Dye preparation
For dye absorption, the BSO, BSO/TiCl4 treated, BSO/scattering layer (BSO/TiO2 and BSO/ZnO) and BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer electrodes were submerged in an ethanol solution for 1 h at room temperature, that contained 0.5 mM of Ru complex dye (N719). The soaking time of the BSO film in the dye molecules is much shorter than for the conventional materials (TiO2). This may be due to the fast dye adsorption kinetics of the BSO surface. Following this process, the prepared electrodes were rinsed with a mild stream of absolute ethanol to remove the physically adsorbed dye molecules.
2.7. DSC assembly
The sandwich-type DSCs were assembled using the dye-adsorbed BSO photoelectrode and platinum-coated counter electrode. In brief, the counter electrode was prepared by a drop of 5 mM chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6) dissolved in isopropyl alcohol and spreading on a separate FTO substrate before sintering at 450 °C for 15 min in air. The prepared photoelectrode was sandwiched with the counter electrode by using a parafilm spacer to avoid short-circuit between the working and counter electrodes. Subsequently, one drop of iodide-based liquid electrolyte (EL-HPE; Dyesol, Australia) was carefully injected in between the electrodes. Two binder clips were clamped to maintain the mechanical grip to avoid disturbance during cell operation. Here the 1 cm2 active area of the dye-coated BSO film was used as the photoelectrode. The schematic diagram of the device fabrication is shown in Fig. 5.
2.8. Material characterizations
The crystallinity and phase purity of the BSO material and fabricated photoelectrodes were characterized using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (PANalytical X'Pert Pro (with Cu-Kα radiation)). The synthesized BSO was excited using a 488 nm Ar+ laser line through LabRam HR800 micro-Raman instrument, and its backscattering mode was recorded in the wavenumber range of 100–800 cm−1. The shape, size and lattice dimension of the BSO material were analysed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (FEI Tecnai G2). Additionally, HRTEM images were captured for crystalline TiO2 and ZnO samples. The top view of synthesized nanocrystalline BSO powder, top and cross-section view of the BSO/scattering layer and cross-section view of BSO/1 min TiCl4 treated/scattering layer photoelectrodes surface morphologies were captured using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Tescan VEGA3) and field emission SEM (FEI NOVA nano SEM 600) respectively.
2.9. Device testing
The prepared DSCs were illuminated using a 150 W xenon lamp solar simulator (New port model 96000) equipped with an Air Mass 1.5 filler. Intensity of incident light was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using a silicon power meter (Thorlabs S120UV). The charge carriers were generated by a short exposure to incident light and the life time of the carrier density with time was measured.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of synthesized BSO material
Until now, the quality of the prepared material is initially identified via XRD analysis and this characteristic is very important for making electronic and photovoltaic devices. Hence, our synthesized nanocrystalline BSO was carefully examined by XRD analysis. In order to confirm the purity of the phase structure, a Rietveld refinement was carried out for the XRD data of the BSO sample (2θ range 20–80°) and the observed results are shown in Fig. 1(a). According to ICDD No 15-0780, the observed lattice planes exhibited the cubic perovskite structure without any ambiguity, having a lattice constant of 4.113 Å. It can be seen that most of the cubic perovskite BSO structure is constructed by the (110) crystallographic plane owing to its higher surface energy under this synthetic strategy. The average crystallite size was calculated via the well-known Scherrer equation using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the preferentially oriented crystallographic peak and it was found to be ∼23 nm. Additionally, the strain (δ) and dislocation density (DD) values were calculated and are presented in Table 1 (formula is given in ESI†). From the final refinement convergence R-pattern, the weighted profile R-pattern and S values were obtained and are tabulated in Table 1. The obtained cubic phase unit cell of BSO from the Rietveld refinement is shown in Fig. 1(b) and it has space group Pmm. The micro-Raman spectrum of BSO is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It strongly supports the XRD results.

Following XRD and μ-Raman analyses, we accurately determined the shape, lattice dimension and crystal structure of the BSO material using TEM, HRTEM and the SAED pattern respectively. The captured images (TEM, HRTEM and SAED pattern) are shown in Fig. 2. For the first time, the BSO nanocrystalline powder exhibiting the nanocuboids/nanoparticles morphological structure is observed. The low magnification TEM images (Fig. 2(a–d)) indicate that the length and breadth ranges of the nanocuboids are ∼123–250 nm and ∼118–236 nm respectively. The measured interplanar spacing values from Fig. 2(e) are 1.923 Å and 2.885 Å, which correspond to the (200) and (110) crystallographic planes of the cubic BSO. The HRTEM image of the nanocuboid particles shows no stacking faults or dislocations which indicates the high purity and good crystallinity of the nanocuboids shaped BSO. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the BSO sample is shown in Fig. 2(f). The electron diffraction rings are assigned to the (110), (111), (200), (201), (220), (310), and (320) diffraction planes of BSO cubic phase. More importantly, the SAED pattern rings are in good agreement with the XRD and μ-Raman results. HRTEM images of the purchased TiO2 and synthesized ZnO powders are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). From these images, the tetragonal anatase TiO2 and hexagonal wurtzite ZnO crystal structures have been clearly confirmed.

In order to identify the presence of elements at the atomic level, the BSO sample was examined by energy dispersive spectroscopic analysis (EDX). The obtained EDS spectrum is shown in Fig. 4(e). Here, we can see only peaks for Ba, Sn and O atoms, clearly indicating that the prepared BSO material has a high purity. Furthermore, the purity of the TiO2 and ZnO samples was checked by EDX analysis and the obtained spectra are shown in Fig. S3(a) and (b) (ESI†) respectively.
3.2. Characterization of fabricated BSO photoelectrodes
In BSO/(1 and 3 min) TiCl4 treated electrodes, the extra diffraction peak is not clearly observed. Hence, the XRD patterns of the BSO/5 min TiCl4 treated electrodes are only provided here. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the XRD pattern of the BSO, BSO/5 min TiCl4 treated and BSO/5 min TiCl4 treated/(ZnO and TiO2) scattering layer electrode samples. Importantly, Rietveld refinement carried out for the BSO/5 min TiCl4 treated and BSO/5 min TiCl4 treated/(ZnO, TiO2) scattering layer electrode samples are shown in Fig. 3. Due to the TiCl4 treatment of BSO, a new diffraction peak erupted at a 2θ value of 25.33°, which was attributed to the (101) crystallographic plane of anatase TiO2. Compared with previous work, this indicates the shell-like anatase TiO2 formed on the core BSO nanostructures.13 In the BSO/5 min TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer electrode, the intensity of the anatase TiO2 peak was increased and also a few new peaks emerged. The ZnO scattering layer on the BSO electrode also exhibited a few new diffraction peaks around 2θ values of 31.78°, 34.43° and 36.26° which correspond to the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure.

Fig. 4(a) shows the top view FESEM image of the cubic perovskite structure of the BSO nanocuboids/nanoparticles covered FTO substrate. This image clearly shows the nanocuboids surface morphological structure of BSO. The sizes of the cuboids are in the range of ∼114–310 nm in good agreement with the TEM analysis. The top and cross-section view of the TiO2 and ZnO scattering layer on the perovskite BSO film are shown in Fig. 4(b, f) and (e, g) respectively. The particle sizes of the TiO2 and ZnO scattering layer are in the range of ∼80–230 nm and 300–400 nm respectively. The cross-section views of the novel photoanodes BSO/1 min TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer and BSO/1 min TiCl4 treated/ZnO scattering layer are shown in Fig. 4(d) and (h) respectively. The thickness of the bare BSO electrode is ∼5 μm. Further, the measured thicknesses value of the BSO/TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer and BSO/TiCl4 treated/ZnO scattering layer electrodes are ∼8 μm and ∼12 μm, respectively. With respect to increasing the TiCl4 treatment time on BSO, the thickness of the electrodes is slightly increased (∼25–40 nm). This new type of photoanode enhances the PCE by increasing both efficient charge collections and the lifetime of incident light under reducing recombination events.
3.3. Photovoltaic discussion
The percentage of dye loading on the photoelectrode strongly affects its photocurrent density. Hence the amount of dye loading on the BSO photoelectrode was optimized with respect to immersion time into dye solution. Here, the optimized dye loading time is about 1 h. Compared with traditional TiO2, the optimized dye loading time is very low for the BSO material. Fig. 5 illustrates the schematic diagram of a fabricated DSC that includes the perovskite nanocrystalline wide-band gap BSO material on FTO substrate. When light energy passes through the fabricated DSC, voltage is generated across it. As a consequence, the photoelectrons are generated and build a path in which they will travel to the surface of the working electrode. This process is majorly dependent on the following physico-chemical reactions. D + hν → D* Absorption or excitation(1) D* → D+ → e−(CB) Electron injection(2) 2D+ + 3I− → 2D + I3− Regeneration(3) I3−+ 2e−(Pt) → 3I Reduction(4) D+ + e−(CB) → D Recombination(5) I3− + 2e−(CB) → 3I− Recapture(6) D* + D+ → D Relaxation(7)where D and D* are the HOMO and LUMO levels of the dye molecules (Ru) and I is related to the redox mediator. The first four reactions produce a clear route for excited electrons to travel in the desired direction and fulfill the circuit. Consequently, the other three reactions (5 to 7) are referred to as dark reactions because they serve to decreases the output/performance of the device. The expected chemical reaction under light irradiation is associated with the potential difference between the Fermi level of the BSO and that of the redox iodide electrolyte. Here the shift in Fermi level is stimulated by accumulation of excited electrons in the conduction band edge of the large band-gap BSO semiconductor.
 Fig. 5  Schematic diagram of BSO nanostructures based DSCs. 
Therefore, the adjustment of band-bending can be caused by the structure of the photoelectrodes that support the generation the hot electrons from the incident solar photons without suffering any permanent chemical transformation. Different Ti source materials post-treatment carried out for adjusting band-bend result in increasing of PCE.51 Furthermore, owing to the short lifetime of the solar photons in the device, the scattering layer has been effectively used to increase the PCE.47 In previous studies the submicron particle sizes of TiO2 and ZrO2, and different ZnO nanostructures including nanowires, hierarchical structures, and mesoporous spheres were also used as scattering layers.50 Additionally, a mirror like scattering layer has been recently reported for increasing the lifetime of incident light.3,52 When compared with other shapes and structures, the reflectance distance of spherical like nanoparticles is high. Furthermore, they result in a short pathway for reflective light to easily reach the dye molecules on the surface of BSO. Subsequently, the reflective light flux is increased over the dye anchored surface of BSO. Therefore it is realized that such an over-layer on the nano crystalline BSO photoanode system will encourage light scattering in DSCs, especially in the red energy portion of the solar spectrum. The position of the energy levels at the interfaces between BSO/dye/electrolyte is fundamentally important for the function of DSCs as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Hence, the interface chemistry plays an important role for determining the conduction band edge and Fermi level edge alignment in the devices.

The dye molecules absorbed visible light and were excited from highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular (LUMO) level. Therefore photoelectrons are generated according to eqn (1). The photoelectrons’ transport behaviour from the CBE of the BSO to the surface of working electrode is significantly dependent on its band-alignment which is presumably controlled by its physiochemical and mechanical properties.
3.4. Photovoltaic performance
The BSO/dye, BSO/TiCl4 treated/dye, BSO/TiO2 scattering layer/dye and BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer/dye photoanodes based devices are shown in Fig. 6(c, d, e and f) respectively. The TiO2 and ZnO were chosen as scattering layers because of their energy levels being ideal relative to the dye molecules. Importantly, the valence band edge of TiO2 and ZnO are located near the band edges of perovskite metal oxide.53 Additionally, the electron back-transfer from the BSO material to the oxidized species (I3−) of the electrolyte is a very complicated process which leads to increased lifetime of charge carriers in the working electrode. Hence the expected energy level arrangement tries to receive high voltage with minimum loss that easily generates the charge separation between the absorber and selective contacts. Schematic diagrams of the light scattering process of TiO2 and ZnO scattering layers on a BSO photoanode are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b) respectively.

The typical photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves for the BSO, BSO/TiCl4 treated, BSO/scattering layer (TiO2 and ZnO) and BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer photoelectrodes measured under simulated solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 8 and 9. Fig. 8 shows the J–V curves of BSO, BSO/TiCl4 treated and BSO/TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer electrodes based DSC devices. The photocurrent density of the BSO electrode based DSC is 1.74 mA cm−2. Different TiCl4 treatment times (1, 3 and 5 min) were selected in order to identify the optimum condition for increasing the PCE. Initially, the Jsc rapidly increased to 13.08 mA cm−2 at 1 min TiCl4 treatment time and then they gradually decreased with respect to increasing TiCl4 treatment time up to 5 min. The obtained higher Jsc value indicates the large band gap BSO material has efficient charge collection capacity with slight modification of surface characteristics. The chemisorption of dye molecules on TiO is mainly dependent on the presence of OH species which is under investigation in our work. Hence the lower dye adsorption may be due to the reduced presence of OH species with respect to the increasing TiCl4 treatment time. The TiCl4 treatment on ZnO and TiO2 photoelectrodes was tried to shift the CBE potential to negative values, resulting in increasing Voc.13 Here Voc is slightly decreased (∼0.15 V) with respect to TiCl4 treatment time. For this reason, the Jsc and Voc values gradually decrease with the 3 and 5 min TiCl4 treated BSO photoanodes. A similar result is also observed for the BSO/scattering layer (ZnO and TiO2) photoelectrode based DSCs. Finally, the maximum photocurrent density (16.67 mA cm−2) is obtained by the BSO/1 min TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer photoanode. The electronic structure at the interface (BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer) should be engineered to assuage detrimental effects such as surface recombination and Fermi-level pinning, which decisively helps to improve the Jsc under fast electron transport. Further, the photocurrent densities of the BSO/3 min TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer and BSO/3 min TiCl4 treatment/ZnO scattering layer photoanodes are 14.19 and 11.13 mA cm−2 respectively. However, 3 and 5 min TiCl4 treated BSO photoelectrodes have superior light scattering ability, but these Jsc values are gradually decreased. This may be due to the change in band-bending alignment with respect to the TiCl4 treatment time. It is also reported that the photo voltage (Voc) declines gradually with increasing TiCl4 treatment time. The augmentation of numerous short BSO and TiO2 branches provides additional charge recombination sites resulting in higher recombination rate.54

The resultant observed photovoltaic parameters such as Voc, Jsc, FF and efficiency are summarized in Table 2. The observed highest PCE (5.68%) in the BSO/TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer is 8 fold increased (155%) as compared to the efficiency of the bare BSO photoanode. The BSO/5 min TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer yields an overall efficiency of 3.27%, however it is higher than the bare BSO. This observation clearly tell us that the TiCl4 treatment time determines the light harvesting and recombination rate according to fast electron injection from the surface of the BSO photoanode and the percentage of dye loading.

The photovoltaic performances of BSO/TiCl4 treated/ZnO scattering layer photoelectrode based DSCs devices are shown in Fig. 9. The photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2. The BSO/ZnO scattering layer photoanode based DSCs device exhibited a photocurrent density of 2.6 mA cm−2. The BSO/1 min TiCl4 treated/ZnO scattering layer photoanode also exhibited the maximum Jsc and the observed value was 10.02 mA cm−2. The Jsc value decreased with increasing TiCl4 treatment time. At a TiCl4 treatment time of 5 min, the obtained Jsc value was 7.53 mA cm−2. Furthermore, it was observed that the Voc decreased from 0.837 to 0.647 V with respect to increasing TiCl4 treatment time. The BSO/ZnO scattering layer electrode increased the efficiency relative to the bare BSO photoanode. Finally, 1 min TiCl4 treated/ZnO scattering layer on a BSO photoanode exhibited a higher efficiency (4.28%). Both scattering layers (ZnO and TiO2) electrodes exhibited similar characteristics of Voc and Jsc. Fig. 10 shows the schematic diagram of bare BSO, BSO/TiCl4 treated and BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer electrode based DSCs and the maximum achieved PCE is highlighted. Compared with the BSO/1 min TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer, the BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer electrode based DSCs exhibited lower PCE values. It is well known that the specific surface area of the material is directly proportional to the particle size. Therefore, the amount of dye loading is decreased in the ZnO scattering layer electrodes resulting in a decrease of PCE.

3.5. Electron lifetime in BSO photoelectrodes
The photoexcited electron lifetime (τ) is strongly associated with the recombination event in the DSCs.55 In order to understand the influence of TiCl4 treatment, scattering layer and both together on the BSO photoelectrode, the electron lifetime vs. current density curve for the BSO/TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer is plotted and is shown in Fig. 11(a). All fabricated DSCs have exhibited higher τ values with good stability. For the 3 and 5 min TiCl4 treatment with/without scattering layer photoelectrodes, the τ is slightly decreased which may be due to the higher recombination event. Furthermore, the electron lifetime vs. current density curve for BSO/TiCl4 treated/ZnO scattering layer electrodes is shown in Fig. 11(b). The electron lifetime of the BSO based DSCs is increased after the TiCl4 treatment. The acceleration of photoelectrons by the TiCl4 treatment and scattering layer can be attributed to a few important factors. Hence the photo voltage value decreases with respect to increasing TiCl4 treatment time. (i) At higher TiCl4 treatment time the uncoupled nanoparticles are altering the Fermi level position that also limiting the charge carrier transport over the surface of the BSO nanostructures. (ii) An interface is formed between BSO and the TiO2 nanoparticles (via the scattering layer) that can participate in the charge carrier transport phenomena. It was noticed that the formation of a TiO2 shell layer over the surfaces of the BSO nanoparticles prevents the reaction of injected photoelectrons with the oxidized species (I3−) in the electrolyte by physically separating them.2 The higher conduction band edge position of TiO2 relative to BSO repulses the electrons toward the BSO side due to the energy level difference (Fig. 6). Therefore, the electron recombination rate is increased in the BSO/5 min TiCl4 treated photoelectrodes. Compared with the BSO/TiCl4 treated/ZnO scattering layer electrode, the Fermi level position variation is very low in the BSO/TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer electrode. Therefore the BSO/TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer electrode exhibited one of the highest PCEs.

4. Conclusions
Initially, we have assembled bare cubic perovskite BSO nanocuboids/nanoparticles morphological structured photoelectrode based DSCs that exhibited a PCE of 0.71%. Separately, two scattering layers (TiO2 and ZnO) and TiCl4 treatment (1, 3 and 5 min) were carried out on the BSO nanocuboids/nanoparticles and used as photoelectrodes in DSCs. PCEs of 1.14, 1.25 and 3.88% were observed for the BSO/TiO2 scattering layer, the BSO/ZnO scattering layer and the BSO/1 min TiCl4 treated photoanodes respectively. Finally, a novel BSO/TiCl4 treated/scattering layer photoelectrode has been successfully fabricated by our research team. In order to achieve a maximum PCE, we planned to optimize the TiCl4 treatment time of the photoanodes. Considering this point, 1, 3 and 5 min TiCl4 treated BSO photoanodes were tested and the obtained PCE values were 3.88, 1.78 and 1.61% respectively. The aim of the present work has been successfully satisfied by achieving one of the highest PCE values. The obtained highest PCE is 5.68% with the BSO/1 min TiCl4 treated/TiO2 scattering layer photoanode. In the ZnO scattering layer based BSO photoelectrodes, a maximum PCE of 4.28% was obtained on the BSO/1 min TiCl4 treated/ZnO scattering layer photoanode.
