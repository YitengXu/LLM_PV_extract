    , Accepted 18th March 2021First published on 19th March 2021AbstractAn ideal electron transporting layer (ETL) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) requires reasonable energy levels, high electrical conductivity and excellent charge extraction. The low processing temperature makes ZnO a promising ETL for PSCs; however the widely used solution-processed ZnO films often suffer from high-density surface defect states, which might cause severe charge recombinations at the ETL/perovskite interface and accelerate the chemical decomposition of perovskite materials. In this work, we employed the vacuum-based magnetron sputtering method to deposit ZnO ETLs, which significantly reduces the number of oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups on the ZnO surface. The magnetron sputtered ZnO based CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs yield a considerable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.04% with excellent long-term device stability. Furthermore, aiming to improve the ETL/perovskite interface for more efficient electron extraction, a bilayer ZnO/SnO2 ETL was designed for constructing high-efficiency PSCs. The detailed morphology characterization confirms that the bilayer ZnO/SnO2 provides a low-roughness film surface for the deposition of high-quality perovskite films with full coverage and long-range continuity. The carrier dynamic study reveals that the presence of the SnO2 layer results in the formation of favorable cascade energy alignments and facilitates the electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface. As a result, compared with the ZnO-based PSCs, the device constructed with the bilayer ZnO/SnO2 ETL delivers an improved PCE of 15.82%, coupled with a reduced hysteresis.
1. Introduction
As an emerging third-generation photovoltaic device, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their remarkable photovoltaic performance, low cost, ease of fabrication and excellent flexibility.1–4 The record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been pushed up to 25.5%.5 The sharp increase of the device efficiency can be attributed to the excellent inherent properties of perovskite materials, including bipolar charge transport, tunable band gap, high absorption coefficient (∼104 cm−1), long carrier diffusion length, small exciton binding energy (2–55 meV), etc.6–10 To date, a number of effective strategies, interface passivation, band engineering, compositional tuning, etc., have been used for improving the PCE and stability of PSCs.11–14 In a typical PSC, the perovskite absorber layer is often sandwiched by the electron transporting layer (ETL) and the hole transporting layer (HTL); furthermore, the ETL plays an indispensable role in transporting electrons and blocking holes. Meanwhile, the presence of the ETL also prevents direct contact of the perovskite absorption layer and the conducting substrate, avoiding charge recombination of photogenerated carriers.15–17
At present, a number of n-type metal oxide semiconductors have been explored as ETL candidates, such as TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, etc.1,2,18–21 Of these ETLs, the conventional TiO2 has been extensively used for PSCs, delivering impressive device efficiencies; however, the processing of TiO2 ETLs often involves high-temperature sintering processes.22,23 ZnO is a promising ETL material which enables low-temperature processing, coupled with other excellent photoelectric properties, including good optical transparency, high electron mobility, and favorable band structure matching with perovskite materials.24–26 The ZnO ETLs for PSCs are often deposited through the spin-coating assisted sol–gel solution method; however, the surface of solution-processed ZnO is prone to residual hydroxide groups, which will accelerate the chemical decomposition of perovskite crystals and shorten the long-term stability of PSCs.27,28 Magnetron sputtering is an excellent physical vapor deposition technology, which allows the deposition of large area and uniform ZnO films at room temperature.27,29 Magnetron sputtered ZnO films are expected to significantly decrease the number of hydroxyl groups on the film surface and serve as promising ETLs for PSCs. Nevertheless, in contrast to the solution processed ZnO ETLs, the magnetron sputtered ZnO films have seldom been used as ETLs for PSCs, and the corresponding device performance requires further improvement.30 Zhao et al. fabricated a high-quality sputtered ZnO film by adjusting Ar/O2 gas ratios and studied controlled defects and enhanced electronic extraction in fluorine-incorporated ZnO for high-performance planar PSCs.29,31 Moreover, the design of bilayer ETLs is an effective strategy to improve the quality of the ETL/perovskite interface for suppressed charge recombination in PSCs.32–35 The bilayer ETL can also afford cascade energy level alignments for more efficient charge separation, such as with SnO2/TiO2,36 SnO2/CdS,37etc. For example, Wang et al. designed SnO2/TiO2 double ETLs to remove the interfacial energy barrier for enhanced charge transfer and decreased charge recombination at the CsPbI2Br/ETL interfaces and achieved a PCE of 15.86% together with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.23 V and a fill factor (FF) of 82.29%.36 Hence bilayer ETLs based on magnetron sputtered ZnO films are expected to produce high performance PSCs.
In this work, we deposited high-quality ZnO films as efficient ETLs for PSCs via magnetron sputtering. The facile control of sputtering time allows the successful optimization of the film thickness, which delivers a remarkable PCE of 13.04% for CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) PSCs. Then a thin layer of spin-coated SnO2 colloidal dispersion was deposited onto the ZnO underlayer to form the bilayer ZnO/SnO2 ETL. The design of bilayer ETLs not only affords a low-roughness film surface with superb wettability for the subsequent deposition of the perovskite absorber layer, but also enables the construction of favorable cascade energy alignments and efficient electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface. Eventually, the bilayer ZnO/SnO2 based PSC yields a greatly enhanced PCE of 15.82%.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of ETLs
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates (1.5 × 2.0 cm2, sheet resistance ∼15 Ω sq−1) were etched and cleaned before use. A chemical etching by using zinc powder and 6 M hydrochloric acid diluted with deionized water was performed. Then the etched substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol, each for 15 min, respectively, followed by drying with nitrogen. The cleaned FTO substrates were further treated with UV/ozone for 20 min before device fabrication. The sputtered ZnO films were deposited onto FTO substrates based on a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering system. Firstly, the substrates were fixed on the substrate holder in the chamber. The RF power was set at 70 W and the pressure was kept at 1 Pa with a turbo molecular pump. The deposition temperature was sustained at room temperature. To obtain ZnO films with different thicknesses, the sputtering time was set at 1, 2 and 4 min. For comparison, the solution-processed ZnO films were prepared by the spin-coating method as control samples. A solution of 0.75 M zinc acetate dihydrate dissolved in a mixture of 2-aminoethanol and 2-methoxyethanol (9/200, v/v) was spin-coated on the pre-cleaned FTO substrate, followed by the annealing treatment at 300 °C for 20 min in a muffle furnace. As for the bilayer ETLs, the SnO2 aqueous colloidal dispersion (15 wt%) was diluted in ultrapure water with a volume ratio of 1:7, and then spin-coated onto the FTO substrate that was pre-deposited with the sputtered ZnO film at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing on a hot plate at 150 °C for 30 min.
2.2. Device fabrication
The MAPbI3 perovskite films were fabricated by using a one-step antisolvent method. Firstly, 461 mg of PbI2, 159 mg of MAI, and 78 mg of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (with the molar ratio of 1:1:1) were dissolved in 600 mg of N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) in an ambient environment, and the mixture solution was then transferred into a glove box and stirred for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. Secondly, 50 μL of perovskite precursor solution was dispensed dropwise onto the surface of the as-obtained ETLs, i.e., FTO/ZnO or FTO/ZnO/SnO2, followed by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 25 s, during which one drop of 100 μL ethyl acetate as the antisolvent was dropped on the spinning substrate at the moment of 7 s. This process allowed a quick crystallization of the MAPbI3 perovskite crystals. Thirdly, the coated films were thermally treated on a hot plate set at 70 °C for 20 min, accompanied by the observation of the film color changing from light yellow to dark brown. 1 mL of a chlorobenzene solution containing 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salt dissolved in acetonitrile (0.52 g mL−1) was cast onto the perovskite surface and spun at a rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s to form the HTL layer. The as-obtained samples were left under darkness in air overnight prior to the thermal evaporation of the Ag electrode to complete the fabrication of PSCs. The active area of devices was 0.12 cm2.
2.3. Characterization of materials and devices
The film morphology was characterized by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension ICON, Brooke). The contact angle was measured with a contact angle meter (OCA 15EC, DataPhysics Instruments GmbH). The optical transmittance and absorption spectra were obtained on a UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (CARY 5000, Agilent). The chemical properties of the surface of ZnO films were investigated by XPS (Thermo, ESCALAB 250Xi). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using Cu Kα radiation with the wavelength of 0.154 nm (Panalytical B. V.). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films were recorded with a charge-coupled device mounted on a monochromator (SOL MS2004i), under the excitation of a 405 nm picosecond diode laser with a pulse width of 40 ps and a repeat frequency of 1 MHz; time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded with a SPC-130 Single Photon Counter using the time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under solar simulator illumination with the light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G, Oriel Sol 3A Solar Simulator, USA), as calibrated with a standard silicon reference cell (Oriel Instruments, Model 91150V). The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) test was carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zennium Pro., Zahner) fitted with a CIMPS-IPCE system and Thales software under the direct current (DC) mode using a tunable LED lamp (365–1020 nm, TLS03) as the light source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded on an electrochemical workstation (Zennium Pro, Zahner) under dark conditions, and the measured data were fitted by using Z-view software.
3. Results and discussion
The top-view SEM images of the bare FTO substrate and sputtered ZnO films deposited under different sputtering times are shown in Fig. 1. In contrast to the bare FTO surface, the sputtered ZnO films are covered with conformal thin layers. With the increase of sputtering time, the average grain size of ZnO nanoparticles gradually increases. The surface roughness of sputtered ZnO films is reflected by AFM images (Fig. S1†). The deposition of ZnO films enables the decrease of the surface root-mean-square (RMS) roughness from 9.52 nm for the bare FTO to 9.10, 9.07 and 8.85 nm for sputtered ZnO films deposited under sputtering for 1, 2 and 4 min, respectively. This fact echoes the observation of SEM images. The reduced surface roughness of ZnO ETLs is beneficial for the subsequent deposition of perovskite layers. The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S2†) reveal that the sputtered ZnO films follow the fluctuations of the FTO substrate surface, confirming the conformal growth of ZnO films on substrates. Meanwhile, the thickness of ZnO films, which shows a rough linear increase with the sputtering time, is estimated to be 20, 50, and 100 nm for the samples prepared under magnetron sputtering for 1, 2 and 4 min, respectively. The decreased transmittance in the UV region as reflected in the optical transmittance spectra of sputtered ZnO films (Fig. S3†) also indicates the increase of film thickness with the sputtering time. Meanwhile, it is shown that the as-obtained ZnO films show high transmittance >90% in the visible-near infrared region, superior to that of the bare FTO substrate; this scenario might be associated with the lower surface roughness of sputtered ZnO films, which affords reduced light scattering and light trapping for improved straight transmittance.38 The superior light transmittance of ETLs is favorable for the enhanced light harvesting of the absorber layer.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the bare FTO and sputtered ZnO film prepared under 2 min. The star symbol expresses the diffraction peaks of the FTO substrate. The diffraction peaks located at 31.77°, 34.42° and 36.25° can be attributed to (100), (002) and (101) reflections of ZnO corresponding to the standard card of PDF#36-1451, indicating the well-crystalline nature of sputtered ZnO on the FTO substrate. Aiming to reveal the impacts of the surface states of ZnO processed by different methods on the thermochemical stability of perovskite films, XPS characterization was performed. Fig. 2b shows the O1s core level spectra of magnetron sputtered and spin-coated ZnO films. As shown, the O1s spectra can be resolved into three main peaks related to oxygen atoms in ZnO, i.e., Zn–O bonds at ∼530.1 eV, oxygen vacancies VO at ∼531.17 eV, and surface hydroxyl groups (–OH) at ∼532.7 eV, which are marked as OI, OII and OIII, respectively.27 The corresponding fitted peaks and integrated area are listed in Table 1. The OI area ratios of sputtered and spin-coated ZnO films are 62.75% and 42.08%, respectively, while the OII area ratios of sputtered and spin-coated ZnO films are 37.22% and 48.68%, respectively. These results demonstrate that, compared to the solution-based method, the vacuum technology can effectively lower the density of VO-related defects. Meanwhile, the OIII area ratio of the sputtered ZnO film is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that of the spin-coated one, indicating that the vacuum processed ZnO involves a much smaller number of hydroxyl groups compared to that of the solution-processed ZnO. It has been demonstrated that the surface hydroxyl groups and residual acetate ligands of ZnO films might react with the active layer to accelerate the decomposition of perovskite materials.6,28 Hence our sputtered ZnO films showing a significantly reduced amount of VO-related defects and hydroxyl groups are expected to favor the long-term stability of PSCs.

We further constructed ZnO-based PSCs with the device configuration of FTO/ZnO/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. Fig. 3 schematically illustrates the preparation process of the PSC constructed on the magnetron sputtering processed ZnO films. The J–V curves of the devices based on sputtered and spin-coated ZnO ETLs, measured in the reverse scanning mode under the illumination of One Sun (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2), are given in Fig. 4a. The photovoltaic parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are summarized in Table S1.† With the increase of the sputtering time, the PCE of sputtered ZnO ETL-based PSCs first increases and then decreases, achieving an optimal device performance for the ZnO ETL prepared under the sputtering time of 2 min. The corresponding best-performing PSC yields a champion PCE of 13.04%, a Voc of 1.13 V, a Jsc of 17.29 mA cm−2 and an FF of 66.92%. The IPCE spectrum of such a device is given in Fig. 4b. The integrated current density is calculated to be 16.76 mA cm−2, consistent with the results from J–V curves. By contrast, the solution processed ZnO ETL-based device delivers a much lower PCE of 8.34%, coupled with a Voc of 1.06 V, a Jsc of 16.35 mA cm−2 and an FF of 48.00%. To evaluate the stability of sputtered and spin-coated ZnO based-PSCs, we further recorded a 180-day device stability with the unencapsulated PSCs stored in an electronic moisture proof cabinet, under the conditions of darkness, room temperature and 5% humidity. Fig. 4c and d show the J–V curves of sputtered and spin-coated ZnO ETL-based PSCs, respectively. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2.† It is shown that, compared to solution-processed ZnO based PSCs, the sputtered ZnO based devices exhibit significantly enhanced stability. The PCE of the sputtered ZnO-based PSC retains nearly 80% of its initial efficiency after 180 days of storage. The remarkable improvements of PCE and stability for sputtered ZnO based PSCs might be attributed to the dramatic decrease of VO-related defects and hydroxyl groups on the ZnO surface.

As demonstrated in the Introduction part, the bilayer scheme has been confirmed to be an effective strategy for constructing ETLs with efficient electron extraction. Herein we further deposited a thin layer of SnO2 nanoparticles atop the sputtered ZnO film prepared under the sputtering time of 2 min, and carefully compared the impacts of different ETLs, i.e., single-layer ZnO and bilayer ZnO/SnO2, on the subsequent perovskite growth and the corresponding device performance. The top-view SEM images of ZnO and ZnO/SnO2 films, as shown in Fig. 5a and b, indicate that small SnO2 nanoparticles fill over the region of deep concavity atop the ZnO film and make the film surface much flatter. The insets show the contact angles of both film surfaces towards the solvent of perovskite precursor solution, i.e., DMF/DMSO mixed solution with a molar ratio of 9:1. Both ZnO and ZnO/SnO2 films show quite small contact angles, indicating the superb wettability of both ETLs towards the perovskite precursors. This fact is suggested to benefit the formation of high-quality perovskite films.39 The cross-sectional SEM images of ZnO and ZnO/SnO2 films (Fig. 5c and d) confirm reduced surface roughness of ETLs with the successful deposition of a thin-layer SnO2 on the ZnO film. AFM measurements (Fig. 5e and f) further quantify the surface roughness of ETLs. It is revealed that the ZnO/SnO2 film yields a much smaller RMS roughness of 6.87 nm than that of 9.07 nm for the ZnO film.

The top-view SEM images of the perovskite films fabricated on ZnO and ZnO/SnO2 films are shown in Fig. 6a and b. In contrast to the ZnO-based perovskite film, the surface of which appears to have some pin holes, the ZnO/SnO2-based one shows more a compact surface with full coverage and long-range continuity. For both cases, most of the perovskite crystal sizes range from 150 to 250 nm. Meanwhile, the ZnO/SnO2-based perovskite film delivers more crystals with sizes larger than 250 nm, as reflected in the distribution diagrams of the insets of Fig. 6a and b. The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 6c and d) demonstrate almost an identical thickness of around 400 nm for both of ZnO and ZnO/SnO2 perovskite films. Moreover, the ZnO/SnO2-based perovskite film provides larger grain sizes along the vertical direction of perovskite growth. AFM images of the perovskite layers (Fig. 6e and f) reveal that the ZnO/SnO2-based perovskite film shows lower RMS roughness (∼19.9 nm) than that of the ZnO-based case (∼24.3 nm). The small roughness of the absorber layer is beneficial to the subsequent deposition of the HTL layer, which reduces the contact resistance at the perovskite/HTL interface.27

The optical transmittance spectra of ZnO and ZnO/SnO2 films, as shown in Fig. 7a, confirm that the presence of the SnO2 ultra-thin layer presents negligible impacts on the optical properties. The XRD patterns of MAPbI3 films based on both ZnO and ZnO/SnO2 ETLs (Fig. 7b) show well-resolved diffraction peaks, indicating the successful deposition of well-crystallized perovskites on both ETLs. The star symbol represents the diffraction peaks of the FTO substrate. Both diffraction patterns exhibit a preferential orientation indexed to the (110) and (220) lattice planes of MAPbI3, the diffraction peaks of which are located at the angles of 14.2° and 28.5°. The tiny peak observed at about 12.64° belongs to the (001) lattice plane for crystallized PbI2; this phenomenon is extensively demonstrated in published literature studies.40 Moreover, the diffraction peak of the PbI2 impurity is much weaker for the ZnO/SnO2-based perovskite film compared to that of the ZnO-based one, suggesting the retarded thermochemical decomposition of perovskite films. The UV-vis absorption spectra of ZnO and ZnO/SnO2-based perovskite films are presented in Fig. 7c. It can be seen that both films exhibit similar light absorption over the visible region of the solar spectrum, implying the identical thickness of perovskite layers for both cases. The effective band gap of MAPbI3 materials can be further evaluated by extrapolating the linear portion of the (Ahν)2versus hν plots at A = 0 according to eqn (1):41–44 (Ahν)2 = c(hν − Eg)(1)where A is the absorption coefficient, ν is the frequency, Eg is the band gap, h is the Planck constant and c is a constant. As shown in Fig. 7d, an effective band gap of about 1.58 eV is estimated for MAPbI3 materials, in good agreement with the values reported in the literature.45 The identical optical band gaps for both ZnO and ZnO/SnO2-based MAPbI3 films corroborate with the identical crystal structure as revealed by XRD patterns.

Fig. 8a schematically illustrates the device structure of bilayer ZnO/SnO2-based MAPbI3 PSCs. The ultra-thin layer of SnO2 is introduced at the interface of ZnO/perovskite. The corresponding energy diagrams of FTO/ZnO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag are shown in Fig. 8b, with the corresponding energy level positions of each functional layer obtained from the literature.46–49 The band alignment allows the efficient transport of photogenerated electrons to the ETL and holes to the HTL without an energy barrier; the formation of the cascade conduction band at the ZnO/SnO2/MAPbI3 interface contributes to the efficient electron extraction from perovskite to ETLs. Fig. 8c shows the J–V curves for ZnO and ZnO/SnO2 based PSCs, measured under the illumination of One Sun. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. As shown, the bilayer ETL-based device achieves a remarkable PCE of 15.82%, coupled with a Voc of 1.20 V, a Jsc of 20.20 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65.25%; such performance parameters are much higher than that of the ZnO-based device. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, the Voc as high as 1.2 V is among the highest values for ZnO-based PSCs.27,29,50 Such a high Voc might be closely associated with suppressed charge recombination in perovskite films and efficient electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface.27,40Fig. 8d shows typical Nyquist plots of impedance spectra for PSCs measured in the dark with an applied voltage of 1.0 V. The inset gives the simplified equivalent circuit model for curve fitting, on the basis of a transmission line model.51 The equivalent circuit model includes the sheet resistance (Rs), recombination resistance (Rrec) and a constant phase element (CPE). Specifically, Rs corresponds to the series internal resistance of devices, and Rrec accounts for the charge recombination resistance occurring at the ETL/perovskite interface, and the nonideal capacitor of CPE is generally defined by CPE-T and CPE-P that are correlated to the interface capacitor and ideal capacitor, respectively.39 The fitted results of Rs, Rrec, CPE-T, and CPE-P are listed in Table S3.† As shown, both ZnO and ZnO/SnO2 based devices share similar values for Rs due to the use of identical electrodes; however, the Rrec of the ZnO/SnO2 based device (116.4 kΩ) is much larger than that of the ZnO device (94.99 kΩ). The larger Rrec implies the effective suppression of electron–hole recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface, which might be attributed to the efficient electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface in the presence of the SnO2 layer.

To further study the reproducibility of PSCs, the statistical distributions of photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, based on a batch of 15 devices for each type of PSC are given in Fig. 9. All of the performance parameters for ZnO/SnO2 based-based devices are superior to that of ZnO-based devices. The ZnO-based PSCs yield an average PCE of 13.02%; while the ZnO/SnO2-based devices boost the average PCE up to 15.07%. The significant increase of Voc and Jsc can be attributed to the efficient electron extraction at the ETL/perovskite interface as a result of the cascade band structure and ideal interface contact.

The steady-state PL and TRPL measurements were performed to unravel the electron extraction kinetics at the ETL/perovskite interface. As shown in Fig. 10a, the ZnO/SnO2 based perovskite sample expresses a more severe PL quenching than that of the ZnO based perovskite film, indicating that photogenerated electrons can be effectively extracted from the perovskite layer to ETLs in the presence of SnO2. The TRPL spectra (Fig. 10b) of film samples can be fitted with a bi-exponential function to evaluate decay lifetimes:52–55 (2)where τ1 and τ2 express fast decay and slow decay, respectively, A1 and A2 denote the corresponding decay amplitudes, and y0 is a constant for the baseline offset. The fitted results are summarized in Table 3. Herein the fast decay τ1 indicates the quenching of carriers at the ETL/perovskite interface, while the slow decay τ2 accounts for the radiative recombination of carriers in MAPbI3 materials. It is shown that the ZnO based sample shows a fast decay of 2.97 ns, with a weight fraction of 88.58%. By contrast, the ZnO/SnO2 based sample yields a much faster decay of 2.54 ns and an increased fraction of 92.02%. This fact further confirms that, compared to the single-layer ZnO, the bilayer ZnO/SnO2 ETL affords more efficient interface extraction of electrons from perovskites to ETLs in PSCs.

4. Conclusions
The present study demonstrates the successful deposition of high-quality ZnO ETLs for PSCs through magnetron sputtering. Compared to the conventional solution-processed ZnO, the sputtered ZnO ETL delivers remarkable improvements of PCE and stability, attributed to the dramatic decrease of VO-related defects and hydroxyl group on the ZnO surface. A bilayer ZnO/SnO2 ETL was designed to further improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The presence of an ultra-thin SnO2 layer offers two benefits: (1) effective reduction of the surface roughness of ETLs, resulting in the deposition of a high-quality perovskite layer with full coverage and long-range continuity; (2) successful construction of favorable cascade energy alignments at the ETL/perovskite interface, contributing to efficient electron extraction from perovskite to ETLs. As a result, the bilayer ZnO/SnO2 based MAPbI3 PSC delivers a remarkable PCE of 15.82%, much higher than that of the ZnO based device of 13.04%.
