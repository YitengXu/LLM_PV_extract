Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are natural polymeric nanomaterials with excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, good mechanical features, high strength, low density, high specific surface area, and tunable chemistry. Their combination with other nanomaterials, such as graphene derivatives (GNMs), has been demonstrated to be effective since they produce hybrids with outstanding physicochemical properties, tailorable functionality, and high performance. In this review, recent advances in the preparation, modification, and emerging application of CNFs/GNMs hybrids are described and discussed using the latest studies. First, the concise background of nanocellulose and graphene derivatives is provided, followed by the interfacial interactions between CNFs and GNMs. The different hybrids exhibit great promise in separation, adsorption, optics, flexible electronics, energy storage, thermal management, barrier and packaging, and electromagnetic shielding. The main challenges that inhibit the applicability of these hybrids are finally highlighted, and some perspectives for future research directions are provided.Djalal TracheDjalal Trache is a Full Professor at the Ecole Militaire Polytechnique.

1. Introduction
The rather considerable shortage of fossil-based resources and substantial climate change and other environmental problems, combined with rapid population growth, have pushed the scientific community to seek high-performance bio-based materials to replace the less eco-friendly analogs efficiently.1–3 In this context, nanoscale materials like cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) show promise due to their environmental friendliness, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and renewability.4
CNFs, as a cellulose derivative, have the appearance of spaghetti-like morphology with typical dimensions of several microns in length and 5–100 nm in width. They feature substantial tunability in terms of their size and morphology, leading to outstanding thermal, optical, mechanical, ionic, and fluidic characteristics that far surpass those found in their parent cellulosic fibers.5,6 They display excellent physicochemical characteristics such as large surface area and aspect ratio, inertness, high stiffness, superior strength, elongation morphology, low thermal expansion coefficient, abundancy, low density, and specific barrier features.7,8 CNFs contain abundant hydroxyl groups that offer chemical functionalization and hybridization opportunities with a plethora of building blocks ranging from organic to inorganic moieties, playing the role of a versatile platform for numerous surface functionalizations through surface grafting, covalent bonding, or simply via physical adsorption, leading to better performance.9 Recently, CNFs have aroused a great deal of research interest for both academic and industrial purposes, as reflected by the increase in the scientific publications and patents granted.5,10–12 It is reported that CNFs are much less expensive than petroleum-based nanomaterials and metals, where the dry kilogram of CNFs costs approximately USD 20.13 Owing to their unique physicochemical features, CNFs have been widely used in numerous fibrillated aerogels, polymeric nanocomposites, insulating foam technology, papers, and biomedical, energy storage, and oil absorption applications.8,10 Nevertheless, CNFs are hard to dissolve or melt because of their complex amorphous/crystalline structure, the strong intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds, and the rigidity of their cellulosic chains, which drastically limits their use in different technological fields.14 Therefore, it was recently demonstrated that CNFs might confer excellent and suitable characteristics to advanced polymeric, metallic, and ceramic hybrids even at a small amount through their modifications for exigent applications such as optical and electronic devices, sensors, and supercapacitors, to name a few.
With the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization, it is particularly imperative to find ways to develop effective renewable and sustainable materials. The combination of CNFs and nanocarbons like nanodiamonds, nanotubes, fullerenes, and GNMs (graphene, graphene quantum dots, graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide), which display the potential to be an ideal fabrication platform for innovative hybrids, has recently appeared as a novel generation approach for materials for which a synergistic effect of 1D/2D nanomaterials has been proved, and opens new prospects in several applications.15,16
Since the discovery of the fundamental structure of all carbon forms in 2004, known as graphene, numerous graphene-based nanomaterials (GNMs) considered as highly effective two-dimensional (2D) nanoscale materials have appeared.17,18 Owing to their feasibility and versatility, they have drawn significant attention and gained a lot of importance in multifaceted applications encompassing nanocomposites, microelectronics, biomedicine, transparent conductive films, sensors, transistors, and supercapacitors, to cite a few.19–23 Interesting review papers have been recently published which summarize the main recent achievements reached by numerous research groups. Excellent information about graphene, its related derivatives, and their characteristics and potential applications has been reported.17,19–28 The global graphene market, which currently concerns semiconductor electronics, energy storage materials, and nanocomposites, is expected to reach >USD 876.8 million by 2027 with a growth rate estimate of >40% per year.29 Nevertheless, GNMs still suffer from numerous shortcomings that need to be surpassed, such as the ease of the aggregation that causes the decrease of the surface area and drastically affects the optical, electrical, and mechanical features, as well as the low biocompatibility that mainly inhibits their employment in the biomedical area.15,30 Consequently, the incorporation of CNFs could not only overcome the abovementioned issues via the improvement of the dispersity and biocompatibility, but could also procure additional advantages such as stability, thermal conductivity, photothermal activity, optical transparency, adsorption capacity, intrinsic fluorescence and luminescence, and stretchability.31–34
The search for novel CNFs/GNMs-based materials with enhanced features using optimized approaches, and their new applications, is a prominent driving force for research and development in numerous research groups. It can be observed that many exciting literature review articles dealing with nanocellulose/nanocarbon hybrids have been published during the last few years, and most of them have focused on preparation, functionalization, and uses.14,16,31–37 Nonetheless, although extensive findings and advances in CNFs/GNMs-based hybrids have been achieved, no comprehensive report that addresses this fast-growing sustainable field is available. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the most recent advances in the preparation, modifications, and applications of the CNFs/GNMs hybrids realized during the last five years, along with the main interface interactions occurring within the hybrids. For clarity and for the convenience of the readers, some fundamental concepts concerning the preparation, properties, and uses of CNFs and GNMs are concisely described.
2. Cellulose nanofibrils
2.1. Fundamental aspects of nanocellulose
Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on the Earth, representing 50% of natural biomass, is a fibrous and water-insoluble homo-polysaccharide compound with long linear chains of β-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose units.38,39 The well-arranged cellulosic structure is formed owing to the strong and complex H-bond networks that stabilize and organize the cellulosic molecules. In contrast, the less organized parts can not be laterally stabilized by hydrogen bonding (Fig. 1). The ordered (crystalline) domains are more resistant to physical, chemical, and biological treatments compared with the disordered (amorphous) ones; in contrast, the latter, that exhibit a lower density, react easily with molecular groups.7,40

Cellulose can be produced from a wide selection of wooden and nonwooden plant fibers, algae, fungi, bacteria, and certain animals. Its annual production may exceed 7.5 × 1010 tons. Nonetheless, only 6 × 106 tons are employed by the chemical, medical, textile, pulp and paper, environmental, and material industries.42 To isolate cellulose from natural sources, non-cellulosic components such as extractives, lignins, and hemicelluloses should be discarded through various pre-treatment processes using chemical, physical, biological, and integrated methodologies that combine two or more approaches.43–46 A schematic presentation of cellulose from its natural feedstock to the fundamental molecule is depicted in Fig. 1. Nowadays, numerous cellulose polymorphs, namely, Iα, Iβ, Iγ, II, IIII, IIIII, IVI, and IVII have been identified. Each cellulose crystalline structure can be obtained from another using either thermal or chemical treatments.33
In their nanoscale form, cellulose nanomaterials, commonly known as nanocellulose, exhibit intrinsic structures and interesting chemical, mechanical, biological, optical, electrical, and magnetic properties, which may create new opportunities to develop novel classes of nanocellulose-based materials and systems.37 Nanocellulose can be produced through two pathways: (i) the bottom-up method, which needs to use bacteria to transform sugars into nanocellulose; and (ii) the top-down method, the most common one, which requires the employment of several chemical, physical, and biological processes or their combinations to break down fibers into elementary microfibrils or aggregated forms.47 This second approach can be performed through several steps: (i) removing the coarse particles, dust, and oily content from the surface of the feedstock via physical approaches such as washing, screening, and crushing; (ii) elimination of extractives/lignin/hemicellulose using physicochemical and biological treatments; (iii) cleavage and fragmentation of cellulosic micro-fibrils into nanofibers; and finally (iv) applying some post-treatments such as functionalization, solvent elimination, centrifugation, sonication, stabilization and drying.48,49
Thanks to the endeavors of numerous research groups worldwide, several nanocellulose-based materials with suitable properties have been developed, even at an industrial scale.12 Nanocellulose can be categorized into two main classes and five subcategories, as depicted in Fig. 2(a). The different subcategories, which display different sizes, shapes, and properties, are closely dependent on the natural sources and the production procedures. These types of nanocellulose exhibit outstanding inherent physicochemical features such as reactive surfaces, low density (1.6 g cm−3), high specific surface area (∼hundreds of m2 per g), high elastic modulus (130–150 GPa) and tensile strength (7.5–7.7 GPa), low thermal expansion, tunable crystallinity, tailored aspect ratios (100–150), non-toxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, eco-friendliness, and renewability.50,51 Subsequently, such nanoscale cellulosic fibers have found important applications during the last twenty years in various fields such as biocomposites, biomedicine, filtration and separation, energy storage systems, biosensors, decontamination, aerospace, defense, textiles, optical materials, and the paper industry, among others (Fig. 2(b)).9,52

Compared with cellulosic nanostructured materials (Fig. 2a), cellulose nanofibers, the two main subclasses of which are cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), present superior characteristics such as high crystallinity, barrier properties, amphiphilic nature, and higher specific surface area, and display more homogeneity with uniform particle size distribution.55,56 Recently, other nanofibers such as cellulose nanoplatelets, cellulose nanospheres, and cellulose nanoribbons have also been developed.57 CNFs are commonly prepared through mechanical treatment of the cellulosic fibers using microfluidization, high-pressure homogenization, ultrasonication, and grinding, resulting in a higher degree of polymerization, longer length, smaller cross-sectional dimensions, higher aspect ratio, and lower crystallinity.10,58 Extensive review articles and book chapters, which have focused on multiple aspects of nanocellulose such as the cellulose feedstocks, isolation, functionalization, characterization, applications, and challenges, have been published during the last few years, and briefly offer great insights into the scientific community.59–66 As a result, in the following section, we briefly go through the current isolation approaches for CNFs, their properties, and their potential applications.
2.2. Production methods and functionalization of cellulose nanofibrils
Cellulose nanofibrils, also known as fibril aggregates, nanofibrils, nanoscale-fibrillated cellulose, nanofibrillated cellulose, or nanofibrillar cellulose, contain both amorphous and crystalline domains with long and soft chains with dimensions of several micrometers in length and from two to a few hundred nanometers in width. They exhibit an aspect ratio often higher than 50 with web-like entangled structures and have a predisposition to agglomerate.39,47 The preparation process is a combination of various operations as depicted in Fig. 3. Different kinds of CNFs with various morphologies, surface chemistry, degree of polymerization, crystallinity, etc. have been reported.7 Its first preparation was performed by Turbak et al. using a Manton–Gaullin homogenizer.67 Nevertheless, this process was highly energy-consuming, which delayed the commercial application of this approach until recent years.55 Interesting research carried out by Taniguchi and Okamura,68 and Zimmermann et al.,69 respectively, through the development of CNFs using the Supermasscolloider, via cellulose defibrillation by high shearing forces, and microfluidizer, has opened up a new era in the field of CNF production. The description of the most important preparation processes, shown in Fig. 3, their energy consumption, as well as their benefits and drawbacks have been recently reviewed.9,58,70

CNFs can be produced using bottom-up approaches, where bacteria (e.g., Acetobacter) can be used to build up CNFs, or cellulose can simply be dissolved in suitable solvents such as ionic liquids, and then CNFs regenerated via electrospinning or supercritical drying.71–74 However, the top-down approaches are considered the common methods and can be used to exfoliate plant cellulose to the level of a single CNF.11 These methodologies require the delignification of the fibers initially, as described in the previous subsection, to remove extractives, lignin, and hemicelluloses, and then the cellulosic residue is subjected to nanofibrillation using suitable mechanical equipment.75–77 It was revealed that using this latter tool without any pre-treatment of the cellulosic residue necessitates a higher energy consumption and may lead to extensive clogging of the equipment. Therefore, various chemical pre-treatments via TEMPO-mediated oxidation, carboxymethylation, cationization, periodate oxidation, deep eutectic solvents, phosphorylation, sulfoethylation, NaOH and ozonation, numerous biological ones with enzymes like endoglucanases, Cellulast, hemicellulases, xylanases, and laccases, or the combination thereof can be applied before the subsequent mechanical stage to surpass the above shortcomings and enable the production of CNFs at industrial scale through weakening cellulose fibers, decreasing the adhesion between the fibers and facilitating their nanofibrillation, hence leading to cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and attractive scaling-up protocols that generate CNFs with good properties.11,77 Interesting review articles, which discuss these methods in more detail, have recently been published.7,11,78,79 Besides that, some applications, such as polymer composites with hydrophobic matrices, may require the functionalization/modification of CNFs through some post-treatments, as depicted in Fig. 4, which can be performed owing to the presence of plentiful OH moieties to improve the compatibility and tailor the characteristics of the obtained products. The details of such modifications are widely reported in the literature.8,9,78,80

Many companies and organizations worldwide are producing CNFs at a large scale from different types of lignocellulosic biomass for the next generation of advanced materials. Hence, developing high-value products based on CNFs is a hot topic which has attracted much attention from government labs, universities, and the commercial sector.54,81
3. Graphene derivatives: a concise background
3.1. Classification of graphene derivatives and their uses
Graphene (GN) is a 2D material, which was successfully isolated for the first time by Geim and Novoselov in 2004 as mono- and few-layer carbon atoms by mechanical exfoliation.82 It is also seen as the mother of graphitic forms and presents the fundamental basis of the various allotropes of carbon.
Graphene samples can be classified into various categories, known as graphene-based nanomaterials (GNMs), based on the production methods, number of layers, chemical composition, structural characteristics, lateral size, or total oxygen content and orientation.27,83 GNMs are classified in different ways in the literature, and recently, experts have provided the most common categories of 2D materials with specific recommendations.28,84,85 For instance, in 2017, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) suggested several nomenclatures to designate graphene and its derivatives (ISO/TS 80004-13:2017) as follows: (1) graphene, named single-layer graphene (SLG) or monolayer graphene (1LG); (2) bilayer graphene (2LG) with two well-defined stacked sheets; (3) few-layer graphene (FLG) that contains 3–10 graphene sheets; and finally (4) graphene nanoplate or nanoplatelet (GNP), for which the thickness ranges from 1 to 3 nm with lateral dimensions between 100 nm and 100 μm.28 However, according to the structural characteristics and the lateral sizes, GNMs may further include pristine graphene, graphene nanoribbons (zigzag/armchair), graphene and graphene oxide quantum dots (GQD/GOQD), graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene, and 3D graphene.86 Moreover, GNMs can be modified and functionalized, through various non-covalent and covalent approaches, to tailor and improve their properties, extend their applications, and offer various potential benefits in multiple fields. Some potential modifications, among others, are summarized in Fig. 5(A), while others can be found in different specialized reviews.83,86,87 In the framework of the current paper, the main GNMs, which will be addressed later, are graphene, GO, and rGO, for which graphene subsections will include in a generic manner pristine graphene, graphene nano-sheet (GNS), GNP, and GQD as well. Fig. 5(B) depicts the SEM micrographs of some of the GNMs.

The combined figure is reproduced from several figures appearing in ref. 89 and 90 with permission. 
GO consists of a single or a few layers of carbon atoms organized in a hexagonal pattern.15 It is mainly obtained from graphite's top-down approach by oxidation and exfoliation. Numerous oxygen functional groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, epoxy, quinone, lactone, and phenol can be attached to either the basal plane or to the sheet edges.17 The hydroxyl and epoxy groups are mainly found on the basal plane, whereas the other chemical moieties in a small amount are present at the sheet edges.91 Owing to its multifaceted conjugation chemicals, the hybrid structure of sp2 and sp3 configurations, n–π and/or π–π orbital interactions, its ease of dissolution in water and other solvents, the amphiphilic character with hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups and the hydrophobic aromatic frameworks,28,92 GO may react with various organic and inorganic molecules in different media to produce new advanced materials with outstanding properties for several applications.
rGO is another interesting graphene derivative with a much smaller number of oxygen-containing chemical groups than GO. It is typically produced through a reduction reaction of GO, generating a less negatively charged 2D product, restoring the partial or the complete hybridized sp2 configuration of graphene, and recovering its electronic features. Compared with graphene, poor quality and more defects are found in rGO, which are caused by the strong reduction processes that may damage the structure. It has received tremendous attention for many applications owing to its exceptional tailorable optical, electrical, thermal, and physical features.86,93
GQDs with zero-dimensional graphene for all lateral dimensions of less than 100 nm consist of a single to few (up to 10) carbon sheets. They can be produced through bottom-up or top-down approaches.94 They display interesting physicochemical features such as biocompatibility, resistance to photobleaching, high surface area, low toxicity, stable fluorescence, and tailorable bandgap.93,95 They can be applied in several fields, where the magnetic, catalytic, electronic, and optical characteristics can be tailored and improved.96
The development of GNMs has rapidly increased throughout the last few years, which bears witness to the extensive interest given to the different graphene forms and their availability at pilot and industrial scales, where numerous laboratory-mastered technologies have reached commercial maturity.25 There are some exciting applications such as touch screens, conductive inks, membranes and coatings, sports goods, sensors and actuators, electronic and photonic devices, energy conversion and storage, electromagnetic absorbers, catalysis, biomedical modalities, contamination purification in wastewater management, nanocomposites, aerospace, the petroleum industry, chromatographic stationary phases, to name a few.25,93,97–100
3.2. Preparation approaches and characteristics of graphene and its derivatives
To satisfy the commercial requirements of GNMs, such as scalability, high reliability, and cost-effectiveness, various research works dealing with the production of graphene and its derivatives have been conducted since the last century using several non-graphitic, graphitic, and waste materials through bottom-up (construction) or top-down (destruction) methodologies. The characteristics and structure of the obtained GNMs depend closely upon the shape, size, and functional groups available on the surfaces. The widely known preparation approaches are depicted in Fig. 6. This section will briefly focus on the most common and recent synthesis approaches with some important properties. In contrast, the synthesis mechanism details and other aspects can be found elsewhere in the recent literature.20,101–104

Several investigations demonstrated that graphene is not only used in its pristine form, because of the lower production yield achieved and the increased need for products with outstanding properties; its derivatives find promising pathways to be employed for advanced applications and have captivated the attention of the scientific community for the last few years. As an important GN derivative, GO is usually produced through chemical oxidation followed by exfoliation and dispersion in a suitable medium. A summary of these methods has been recently reported by Magne et al.,98 and some examples of GO synthesis procedures are depicted in Fig. 7.

rGO, another promising NG derivative, is often prepared via GO reduction following different methodologies, as shown in Fig. 8, where oxygen functional groups are removed. For more details about the preparation of rGO, the reader can refer to the comprehensive review papers published in the literature.26,105

Another interesting category of GN derivatives was recently identified, which is the GQDs. This class can be prepared through several bottom-up and top-down methodologies from GO and rGO. For instance, electron beam lithography, soft template process, liquid-phase exfoliation, microwave-assisted thermal treatment, solvothermal and hydrothermal treatments, high-power ultrasonication, and chemical vapor deposition are widely reported.15,93 GQDs display unique electrical and optical features that make them potential candidates for photocatalysis, drug delivery, and bio-imaging applications.106
All the properties of GNMs depend on the production processes that may affect the surface chemistry, forms, number of sheets, and the presence of defects.107 Broadly, GN displays stable chemical features and good mechanical properties comprising thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, strength, and high hydrophobicity, generating good water dispersion.108 GO and rGO also exhibit interesting physicochemical features for numerous applications. Nevertheless, GO is considered an electrical insulator with an electric conductivity of <1 μS m−1 because of its disrupted sp2 bonding network and movement charge carriers. rGO, however, presents a lower electrical resistance due to the deoxygenation process that allows the recovery of the π-network during the reduction of GO. Despite the electrical and optical properties of rGO being closer to those of GN, they remain insufficient to heal the vacancy defects.26 More details about the properties of these GNMs and other derivatives as well as the analytical methods used for their characterization can be found elsewhere.27,83,109,110
4. Interfacial interactions between CNFs and graphene derivatives
To design functional hybrid nanomaterials with desirable features using both GNMs and CNFs, numerous interfacial bonding interactions which may be involved should be controlled in addition to the precise hierarchical architecture to tailor the dispersibility of the different components, their affinity, their stability, and to improve other appropriate properties to enhance their attributes and usability. Broadly, abundant intra-/inter-molecular and covalent/non-covalent interactions between both building blocks (CNMs and CNFs) can occur. Covalent interactions, as strong interfacial interactions, may include electrophilic substitution, nucleophilic substitution, condensation reaction, and addition reactions, while non-covalent interactions, as weak interfacial interactions that do not involve sharing electrons, encompass hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, van der Waals, π–π bonding, and ionic bonding.111 Current and forthcoming research activities worldwide will focus on exploiting the synergistic effect of covalent bonding and non-covalent bonding (Fig. 9(a)) for which the simultaneous maximization of the strong covalent bonding and the weak non-covalent one is highly looked-for to improve the required characteristics of the derived nano-hybrids.

As mentioned above, CNFs contain large –OH chemical groups for which intra/inter hydrogen bonding enables hydrophilicity, whereas the exposure of their –CH, as hydrophobic moieties, engenders hydrophobic faces (Fig. 9(b)). These interactions, that may create widespread combinations with various moieties, play a key role in determining the physicochemical properties and performance of the obtained biobased nanocomposites.113 Likewise, GNMs display different types of interactions with other building blocks, which can be either non-covalent, covalent, or a combination. GN exhibits hydrophobic π domains on its basal-center plane, enabling numerous non-covalent bonding interactions with CNFs. In GO and rGO, various arrangements of hydrophilic–hydrophobic segments encountered on the edge-basal-center planes can interact with CNFs through several covalent and non-covalent mechanisms, such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions.36 Subsequently, the intra-/inter-molecular interactions between the dense CNFs OH/CH chemical groups and GN–π electron systems/oxygenated chemical groups can improve the crosslinking density as well as the assembly of the CNG/GNMs hybrids, resulting in outstanding properties, and were revealed to be beneficial for producing stiff, flexible, strong and multifunctional nano-hybrids.16 An example of some interactions encountered between GO and CNFs is shown in Fig. 9(c). For further details about the subject, the reader can refer to the work of Gong et al., who have recently published a comprehensive analysis of the synergistic effects generated from covalent and non-covalent bondings inspired by the plethora of interfacial interactions available in natural hierarchical nanomaterials.112
5. Pristine CNFs/GNMs hybrids: preparation, features, and applications
CNF as a potential 1D nanomaterial has attracted much attention from the scientific community, especially during the last decade, owing to its exceptional characteristics. Special interest was recently reserved for the combination of this 1D nanomaterial with another class of 2D nanomaterials, which is GNMs, without any specific physical/chemical modification, to push further the limit of the current materials and extend their applicability on the one hand, and on the other hand to avoid the employment of complex technologies or excessive chemicals, to reduce the environmental impact. Nevertheless, there are still numerous technical and scientific drawbacks, such as high costs, process scalability, limited dispersion, and agglomeration, among others, in exploiting their synergistic advantages fully. Therefore, many research activities have been reported. Others are currently underway worldwide, employing several production methodologies, as depicted in Table 1, to address these issues and produce effective hybrids with tailorable features. Nowadays, several pristine or unmodified CNFs/GNMs are being developed and exploited for a wide range of applications such as electromagnetic shielding, flexible electronics, supercapacitors, sensors, electric heating devices, wastewater treatment, and absorbents. The following subsections emphasize the most recent achievements in the fabrication of pristine CNF/GNM hybrids, along with their characteristics and potential applications.

5.1. CNF/graphene blends
As the thinnest two-dimensional atomic material, graphene may exist in various forms, such as nanoplates, nanosheets, nanoribbons, and 3D graphene, in which carbon atoms are tightly linked to their neighbors through a unique electronic cloud.19 Owing to its good thermal stability, exceptional optical features, good electronic transport properties, excellent mechanical strength, and high electrocatalytic activity, it has received a tremendous amount of interest in various fields such as microelectronics, composites, biomedicine, and sensors, and currently plays a prominent role in human civilization.130 Nevertheless, its hydrophobic structure has inhibited its straightforward combination with numerous hydrophilic components for developing a wide range of hybrid and composite materials and satisfying the requirements of several advanced applications. In recent years, nanohybrids of GN/CNFs have emerged as a potential class of nanomaterial that exhibits prominent characteristics with a synergistic effect that offers excellent opportunity to produce new materials in nanotechnology, especially as electric heating elements and devices. Although only a limited number of recent research works dealing with the preparation of this type of nanohybrid that exploits GN and CNFs, either without any chemical modification or through the addition of some chemical components to facilitate the production processes, has been carried out, the excellent performance achieved to date may open new opportunities to apply such hybrids in other fields.
A few years ago, Zhang and coworkers prepared a CNF/GN hybrid by exfoliating low-temperature expandable graphite (LTEG) in a nanocellulose matrix by wet co-milling.115 The authors reported that the production of CNFs and the exfoliation of the few-layer graphene (FLG) occurred simultaneously during the co-milling of bamboo cellulose and the LTEG in water via a grinder. The dispersion of FLG is ensured by the steric hindrance of CNFs that avoids the restacking on the one hand, and on the other hand through the interactions between the available hydrogen bonding between CNFs and FLG (Fig. 10(a)). These authors revealed that the passing times through the grinder have a direct affect on the mechanical features, electrical conductivity, and electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE). For instance, Fig. 10(b) shows that the prepared hybrids displayed excellent electrical conductivity. The brightness of the light-emitting diode (LED) tested decreased for the samples that had undergone more passing times. The developed approach is environmentally friendly, scalable, simple, and chemical additive-free. In another research work, to improve the dispersibility and stability of CNFs and GN to produce a hybrid, Shao et al. adopted the ultrasonication approach, where the increase of the shearing force induced from cavitation and ultrasonic waves enhanced the static stability of the graphene suspension and decreased the CNFs’ particle size as well as the overall CNFs–NG suspension in water owing to the adhesive effect and electrostatic repulsion.116 The obtained membrane exhibited structural integrity, planar uniformity, good physicochemical and mechanical properties, and electric heating performance. A schematic diagram of the production method of the membrane is depicted in Fig. 10(c). In contrast, the thermal stability of the membranes prepared under different ultrasonication conditions, as determined by thermogravimetry (Fig. 10(d)), was slightly affected. Li and coworkers recently produced a flexible electric heating membrane with uniform heating performance using CNFs as dispersants, binders, and enhancers to enable the SLG layers’ assembly.89 The authors used different SLG ratios (20–60 wt%) in the water suspension, for which the magnetic stirring followed by the ultrasonication approach was employed. The homogeneous suspensions were vacuum dried to recover uniform flexible membranes (Fig. 10(e)). It was claimed that the prepared membrane, which displays an excellent physicochemical feature and mechanical performance, reached a temperature of 60 °C in only 3 min under 2000 W m−2, and may be linearly enhanced by the increase of the SLG content and the power density (Fig. 10(e)). Therefore, such CNFs/GN electric heating membranes with biocompatibility and an environment-friendly character could find numerous applications in several heater fields. It is evident from the above investigation that interesting CNF/GN hybrids with promising properties can be developed using a common and easy approach without requiring the addition of any other chemical or complex methodologies.

Other CNF/GN hybrids supplemented with other ingredients such as GO or other compatibilizers have also been reported. For instance, Wang and Drzal produced cost-effective, flexible, and electrically conductive CNF/GNP papers using a vacuum-assisted assembly method.117 A schematic presentation of the interfacial interactions between CNFs and GNP is provided in Fig. 10(g); these are governed by the hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and mechanical interlocking. These interactions are improved by the presence of the non-ionic surfactant triton-X100, which played the role of the dispersing agent of the hydrophobic GNP in water suspension supplemented with NCFs. It was demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the papers were enhanced after the addition of CNFs. It was also proved that the compression treatment of the different papers improved the mechanical features and enhanced the electrical conductivity (e.g. 26.8 S cm−1 for paper supplemented with 30 wt% CNFs) due to the elimination of defects and the restoration of the alignment of GNP within the hybrids. Using CNFs, GN, and GO, recently Shao et al. developed a thin electric heating membrane with heat dissipation controllability.131 The authors initially prepared several suspensions in water containing CNFs and GO (GO:CNFs = 1:9, 3:7, 1:1, and 3:2) under magnetic stirring and ultrasonication. The obtained solutions were then introduced into suspensions of GN (from 20 to 50 wt%) and dried under vacuum to produce NFC/GO/GN composite membranes. The authors mentioned that 3-D networks with a dense structure, encompassing GN during ultrasonication, were obtained owing to the electrostatic interactions induced by the negative charges available on the GO and CNFs. The developed membranes displayed high mechanical and conductive properties. It was demonstrated that the increase of the GN content led to the decline of the membrane resistivity of the electric heating membrane, with an enhancement of its thermal stability. It was also reported that both joule heating and electric current decreased sheet resistivity with an increase in the amount of GN. It is expected that this technology will be beneficial for both academic and industrial areas.
5.2. CNFs/graphene oxide nanosystems
Owing to the promising surface, physicochemical, and nanoscale features of both CNFs and GO, they have sparked exponential growth of research in the scientific and engineering community in various areas ranging from nanocomposites to energy storage systems, passing through medical and biosensing. Their combination has recently been demonstrated as an important way to produce pristine hybrids, without any modification, for a wide range of applications such as environmental remediation, wastewater treatment, supercapacitors, and nanofluidic devices.
CNFs with OH groups and GO which contains hydroxyl, carboxyl, and epoxide, can be attracted to each other via nonbonding interactions such as π–π interactions and hydrogen bonding or via covalent bonds under mild conditions. Several simple approaches have been developed for the production of this hybrid type, such as ultrasonication, electrospinning, and hydrothermal processes. The ultrasonication treatment followed by either sequential vacuum filtration, solvent evaporation, or freeze-drying is considered the most common. Nonetheless, although these methodologies are well known and applied even at a large scale for several categories of materials, their optimization to produce efficient CNF/GO hybrids with optimal ratios and suitable properties can further extend their applicability and decrease their overall production cost for eventual scalability.
This class of non-hybrids in membrane or aerogel forms has recently received particular attention in the field of environmental remediation and water treatment. For instance, to effectively separate oil and water from the oily wastewater generated from different industries such as metal, steel, leather, food, textile, and petrochemical under harsh environments (salty, alkaline, and acidic), Ao et al. produced superhydrophilic GO@CNFs membranes using electrospinning equipment.123 A schematic presentation of the process and the oil/water separation mechanism through the obtained membrane is depicted in Fig. 11(A). GO is chosen to offer an underwater superhydrophobic surface through strong resistance for oil penetration on the one hand, and to increase the antifouling performance of the obtained membrane on the other hand.132 It was demonstrated that the obtained porous membrane exhibited superior properties on water wetting owing to the synergistic effect of functional oxygen groups available on both GO/CNFs and the rough surface of the nano/micro hierarchical structure. The authors claimed that, using a facile method, the obtained membrane can effectively separate oil/water mixtures in different environments and easily extend to large-scale oil/water separations. In another work, Yao et al. reported the production of CNFs/GO aerogel via a one-step ultrasonic approach, expected to be employed for the adsorptive removal of antibiotics in water.114

It has been demonstrated that hydrogen bonds dominate the interactions between GO and CNF, for which an interconnected 3D network porous microstructure is obtained, as shown in Fig. 11(B). It was proved that the developed aerogel displayed superior adsorption performance toward different categories of antibiotics through the synergistic effect of the interconnected 3D network and the molecular interactions like hydrogen bonds and π–π stacking. Moreover, it was found that this hybrid ensures an effective easy separation process and reusability, rendering it a potential, economical and effective adsorbent in antibiotic removal from wastewater. Recently, Nguyen and coworkers prepared aerogels based on CNFs/GO using a freeze-drying method for removal and adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous environments,119 as schematized in Fig. 11(C). The produced aerogel, which possessed a large specific surface area and low density, displayed high thermal stability, fast and effective adsorption rate, ease of recoverability, and reusability. It was revealed that this hybrid can adsorb more than 99% of methyl blue in water in less than 20 min and can recover 85% after 30 consecutive compression recovery cycles (Fig. 11(D)). Hence, it is considered a highly durable green light material that might be employed to treat domestic organic wastewater due to its unique 3D porous network structure coupled with thin walls with a large surface area. Other research activities have also confirmed the effectiveness of pristine CNFs/GO hybrids, which display outstanding physicochemical features for water purification,120,133 elimination of antibiotics,134 metal ion adsorption,121 and dye removal. For this latter application, an interesting, efficient preparation approach has been recently pointed out by Liu et al.122 They produced anisotropic CNFs/GO hybrids at different ratios through two sequential vacuum filtrations of CNFs water suspension and GO water suspension under ambient conditions, followed by a drying process under ordinary conditions, and compared them with the isotropic CNFs/GO hybrid prepared by vacuum filtration of a mixed suspension of CNFs and GO Fig. 11(E). It was demonstrated that the lower content of GO (1%) within the anisotropic hybrid allowed superior features such as ultrafast water permeability (Fig. 11(E)) via the formation of several water nanochannels, enhanced mechanical stability, high rejection of negative and positive charged dyes, a scalable manufacturing process, and good economy. In contrast to the isotropic membrane, where GO nanolayers were randomly dispersed within the CNFs network, the anisotropic membrane can be employed in various advanced applications in biomedicine such as urine dialysis membrane, and in the food industry as a separator of brewing microorganisms.
Pristine CNFs/GO hybrids have also been used for supercapacitors, polymer composite fillers, and flexible nanofluidic devices. Zhang et al. reported an eco-friendly and facile methodology to prepare porous CNFs/GO aerogel through hydrothermal processing, freeze-drying, and carbonization.124 It was shown that the obtained interconnected 3D nanostructure exhibited interesting intrinsic electrochemical properties with effective migration of electrolyte ions and electrons during the long-term cycling, revealing its ability to be used for high-performance supercapacitor devices.
To improve ion transport through nanofluidic channels, well-defined membranes exhibiting charge-selective performance, uniform orientation, and morphology, that are expected to be employed in various applications such as energy storage conversion, membrane separation, water permeation, and proton conductors, were developed.135 Nevertheless, these membranes still suffer from some drawbacks, such as flexibility and stability.136 To overcome such shortcomings, Wang et al. prepared a facile one-step vacuum filtration and effective fabrication method for lamellar membrane based on CNFs and GO sheets.137 The obtained structure displayed abundant and well-defined interstitial voids as nanofluidic channels for ion transport. The ionic conductivity through the channels of KCl solution, as an electrolyte, at different concentrations was assessed, showing that at low concentrations, the conductivity could be enhanced by several orders of magnitude and became independent of that of the bulk solutions owing to the hybridization of CNFs with outstanding mechanical features with GO layers (Fig. 12(A)). After immersion in highly acidic and basic conditions, excellent chemical stability with a stable high ionic conductivity was also found. It was also demonstrated that the ionic conductivity increased with the increase of the temperature via the nanofluidic channels; consequently, the activation energy and proton mobility of the membrane decreased as well (Fig. 12(B)). These excellent performances allow the obtained membranes to be employed as nanofluidic devices for numerous applications. In another study, to produce high-yield and high-conductive CNFs/GO hybrids, a one-pot ball-milling approach was applied to co-exfoliate the low-oxidized expanded graphite and micro-fibrillated cellulose under the shear and collision of ball-milling, for which there was a simultaneous in situ hybridization of CNFs and GO sheets through hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions.118 A schematic illustration of the preparation process is depicted in Fig. 12(C). The authors reported that the obtained films’ electric conductivity increases for hybrids with lower oxidation degrees and relatively intact graphitic lattice structure Fig. 12(D(a)). It was also demonstrated that GO layers can be stuck to each other to generate a conductive path, whereas CNFs were sequestrated in the out-of-plane direction, thereby inhibiting the conductive path Fig. 12(D(b)). Moreover, the developed hybrids presented excellent mechanical properties, where the addition of a lower amount (<5%) of this hybrid as a reinforcing agent to carboxylated nitrile butadiene rubber latex improved the overall mechanical features such as the tensile strength, the elongation at break, and the fracture energy owing to the synergistic effect and good dispersion of CNFs and GO sheets.

5.3. CNFs/reduced graphene oxide nanostructures
Graphene-based nanomaterials mixed with CNFs can significantly enhance electron transport, mechanical and other features, and thermal stability. Their interactions can tailor the microstructure for a wide range of applications. Despite pristine graphene being very interesting for producing effective CNFs/GNMs hybrids, as discussed above, the stacking issues of GN, the absence of functional sites, and the poor dispersibility in water and several organic solvents inhibit its facile employment and scalability. Therefore, focusing on using rGO, mainly recovered through the reduction process of GO, instead of GN in CNFs/GNMS hybrids seems a promising approach because rGO exhibits limited oxygen functional groups and hence could allow functionalization either via covalent or non-covalent interactions. Besides, to fully exploit various application opportunities provided by CNFs/rGO nanosystems, a clear understanding of the available preparation strategies is more than necessary. In the following sections the most recent approaches used to prepare pristine CNFs/rGO nanostructures are briefly discussed.
This class of nano-hybrids has recently attracted much attention in energy storage devices such as sensors, tribological nanogenerators, flexible electronics, embedded capacitors, electromagnetic interference shielding, and electric actuators due to its good electrical and thermal properties characteristics, high aspect ratio, flexibility, and light weight. The first developed methodology was based on the direct mixing of CNFs and rGO to produce this type of hybrid. Pottathara et al. prepared two kinds of CNFs/rGO hybrid.90 The first concerned the production of film-based xerogels via vacuum filtration and room drying, whereas the second was dedicated to the manufacturing of porous-structured cryogels through one-directional freezing and lyophilization, as depicted in Fig. 13I. The authors demonstrated that the addition of a small amount (5 wt%) of rGO to the denser and layered structure CNFs/rGO xerogels film resulted in a relatively high dielectric constant at a high frequency of 1 MHz, proving its potential to be used for high-temperature dielectric materials for energy storage applications in the electronic and engineering fields. Moreover, the prepared porous aerogel supplemented with the same content of rGO displayed high electrochemical resistance with capacitive performance, which shows a well-aligned and longitudinal orientation, and can find suitable applications as electrodes for electrochemical storage devices. Following the same preparation approach, Nie et al. have recently prepared a 2D layered structure and porous CNFs/rGO nanocomposite via ultrasonication of the suspension containing CNFs and rGO followed by a vacuum filtration method and freeze-drying.125 The authors revealed that when only 1 wt% of rGO is incorporated into the interconnected network hybrid, an ultrahigh in-plane thermal conductivity of up to 16.3 W m−1 K−1 is reached, confirming its potential as an excellent environment-friendly material with high performance and a low cost for effective thermal management of bio-based flexible electronics, which may ease our daily lives.

Considering that GO has abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and presents a hydrophilic character, it can be easily dispersed in various media and displays good compatibility with various hydrophilic polymers such as CNFs.138 Besides that, as detailed above, GO can be thermally/chemically/electrochemically/hydrothermally/photo reduced to further increase its conductivity. Some research works were carried out for the in situ chemical reduction of GO in cellulose-based hybrids but employed toxic chemicals such as hydrazine. For instance, Nguyen Dang and Seppälä have employed such an approach to preparing CNGs/rGO nanocomposites using hydrazine as a reducing agent at 95 °C followed by vacuum filtration to generate a porous membrane.139 The obtained nanosystem, expected to be used in high moisture conditions to overcome the shortcoming of the poor mechanical features of CNFs at higher temperatures under these conditions, showed higher thermal, electrical, and chemical characteristics compared with the neat CNFs, with a remarkable enhancement of the mechanical performance and the electrical conductivity. In another research activity, Song et al. developed an anisotropic thermally conductive CNFs/rGO film through a layer-by-layer assembly of CNFs and GO followed by a chemical reduction using hydrazine.126 The authors proved that a high degree of orientation along the in-plane direction with an orderly hierarchical structure was obtained, as shown in Fig. 13II. Excellent flexibility and outstanding mechanical performance, in addition to anisotropic thermal conductivity, have been reached for the produced hybrid, making it a promising candidate for application in thermal management.
Recently, numerous reports have been published to address the drawbacks of using poisonous reducing agents, focusing on environmentally friendly methodology, and preparing effective CNFs/rGO hybrids based on an in situ reduction strategy. Liu et al. have recently developed a facile approach based on the utilization of deep eutectic solvent (DES) through a one-step process to produce a CNFs/rGO hybrid for which choline chloride and urea are the media.128 A schematic presentation of the preparation procedure is depicted in Fig. 13III. The authors claimed that this cost-effective and environmentally friendly strategy with scaling-up potential offers hybrids with outstanding electrochemical features, high electrical conductivity (as high as 26.47 S cm−1), and improved flexibility. Such a hybrid is considered an important substrate for cellulose-based triboelectric nanogenerators, sensors, and supercapacitors. In other research, Pottathana et al. adopted an interesting reducing approach via UV irradiation in the presence of nitrogen gas.127 The fabrication process, in this case, was firstly based on the dispersion of CNFs and GO, followed by a solution casting after a magnetic stirring and ultrasonication treatment. The drying process was carried out at ambient temperature. The digital photos of the nanocomposites before and after UV treatments are shown in Fig. 13IV. The obtained film was subjected to UV irradiation experiments under an inert atmosphere. The authors revealed that after the reduction process, the dielectric properties, and the AC conductivity, were significantly improved. It is claimed that this approach is a promising alternative to hazardous wet chemical procedures. Nevertheless, further research is required to fully understand the exact reduction mechanism and how it affects the overall properties of CNF/rGO hybrids. More recently, another interesting solvent approach was developed by Xiong et al., who reported that direct treatment could effectively reach the reduction process of the hybrid via hydrogen iodine of CNFs/GO film, fabricated by ultrasonic and suction filtration.129 The TEM images of the obtained nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 13V. Within the hybrid, rGO allows the increase of the conductivity, whereas CNFs improve the spacing and avoid the stacking of rGO. Consequently, the mechanical features, including strength and flexibility, are enhanced. It was proved that the obtained film can be directly assembled into a supercapacitor since it displays excellent cycle stability, outstanding rate performance owing to the porous structure of the hybrid, and better mechanical properties.
6. Strategies to prepare functionalized CNFs/GNMs hybrids, their properties, and uses
In this section, we will shine a light on the importance of the functionalization of CNFs/GNMs hybrids to produce effective materials that meet the current and future requirements of advanced applications in several fields on the one hand, and on other hand to overcome the current drawbacks caused by the use of pristine CNFs/GNMs. Table 2 summarizes some important approaches used to produce functionalized CNFs/GNMS hybrids, their most important properties, and their prominent applications.

6.1. Functionalized CNFs/GN hybrids
It is widely known that the hydrophobic nature of GN limits its use with various hydrophilic ingredients in producing hybrids and nanocomposites with outstanding properties for current and future challenging applications. Nevertheless, some nanohybrids of GN/CNFs have been recently developed without any specific functionalization. As discussed in the previous section, GN and CNFs were employed in their pristine state. Despite their potential uses, particularly as electric heating elements and devices, their large-scale industrial production remains infeasible because of the difficult dispersion process of CNFs and GN in various media, mainly attributed to the intra- and intermolecular interactions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the functionalization of one or both of these exceptional nanomaterials may ease the manufacturing processes of the corresponding hybrids, which exhibit excellent performance.
CNFs supplemented with carboxylic groups are the main functionalized component within GN/CNFs hybrids. Typically, these CNFs are prepared through a TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical)-mediated oxidation system, for which a breaking up of the micro-scale cellulose fiber into nanofibers that almost retain the original fibrous morphologies occurs in addition to the position-selective oxidation of the primary C6–OH chemical groups to sodium carboxylic groups. After sodium dissociation, negatively charged carboxylate functional groups (–COO−) are left on TEMPO-oxidized cellulose.160–162 The surface-modified CNFs produced via this process offer many advantages such as cost-effectiveness, interesting physicochemical properties, and full dispersion to the level of individual nanofibrils owing to the electrostatic repulsion between cellulose fibrils that prevents their agglomeration, in addition to being produced at the industrial level.163 The up-to-date production routes to make TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils from lignocellulosic particles are depicted in Fig. 14(I).164

The fabrication of paper-like materials or other hybrids based on CNFs and GN with excellent properties such as flexibility, high thermal transport, and electrical features has recently attracted much attention from the scientific community for enhancing the efficiency of the next generation of biologically inspired sensors and actuators, flexible conductive materials, as well as modern electronic devices for effective heat removal and efficient electromagnetic interference shielding. In contrast to the pristine GN/CNFs that display some processing issues, the employment of TEMPO-functionalized CNFs can facilitate the exfoliation, the dispersion, and the homogenization of GN through the decrease of the strong van der Waals forces between graphene sheets, as well as enhance the microstructure and the flexibility of the obtained hybrids. For instance, Osong et al. prepared hybrids based on TEMPO CNFs and nanographite platelets by the casting process to investigate their sheet resistance and the mechanical characteristics of the obtained films.165 The authors claimed the addition of nanographite, prepared through mechanical shearing, into CNFs greatly enhanced the electrical features of the stable, bendable, and flexible composite films. They demonstrated that this production approach is straightforward, scalable, and cost-effective, allowing materials with improved electrical conductivity and lower sheet resistance. In another work, to produce paper-like materials with ultrahigh electrical and thermal transport features for the next generation of electronic devices with excellent electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency, Yang et al. produced homogeneous functionalized CNFs/GN through a sonication approach followed by a vacuum-assisted filtration and a compression at a mechanical compression of 150 MPa for 10 min.140Fig. 14(II) illustrates the fabrication process's schematic presentation. The authors attributed the satisfactory homogeneity and stability of CNFs/GN dispersion to two phenomena. The first was the hydrophobic interactions that occurred between the hydrophobic faces of CNFs and GN planes along with the attractive forces between the fluctuation of the counterions of CNFs and the sp2 carbon lattice of GN.166 In contrast, the second reason was attributed to the strong electrostatic repulsion caused by the available charged carboxylic groups formed on the TEMPO-functionalized CNFs, leading to electrostatic repulsion, in addition to the steric hindrance that may exist between CNFs and GN.113,162 The authors showed that interesting values of 988.2 S cm−1 and 240.5 m−1 K−1 of electrical and thermal conductivity could be reached in addition to a superior tensile strength of 61 MPa and high electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 43 dB. To further extend the electrical and thermal conductivity of the obtained film, the burning process at a higher temperature can be performed. Such film can find a wide range of applications in modern electronics.
To overcome the challenge of good-quality graphene in high yield and stable dispersion, amphiphilic TEMPO-mediated CNFs have been revealed to be a suitable approach, as reported by Xu and Hsieh.142 The authors produced a CNFs/GN hybrid through the exfoliation of graphitic platelets under high shearing followed by vacuum filtration of the obtained suspension. It was demonstrated that only 3% of the graphitic platelets were not exfoliated. To be amphiphilic, CNFs were easily associated with graphite through hydrophobic interactions. At the same time, the hydrophilic surfaces assisted the dispersion of the CNF-bound graphene in the aqueous medium, where improved stabilization and dispersion were ensured via the Coulomb repulsion caused by the charged carboxylates. Interestingly, the obtained hybrids displayed moisture-responsive motions, where swift deformation was seen under moisture stimuli with instantaneous recovery upon its absence, opening the way to the development of soft robots. The elaborated approach was claimed to produce high-quality graphene through a simple, scalable, and green process for potential commercial applications. In another work, to extend the applicability of TEMPO-mediated CNFs, efficient and flexible CNFs/GN hybrids with excellent thermal conductivity and effective electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI) have been fabricated by Li et al. using an alternation vacuum filtration (AVF) process, as schematized in Fig. 14(III).143 The authors reported that the obtained nacre-like oriented structure of the multilayered film containing only 25 wt% of graphene nanosheets exhibited high conductivity, a highly efficient electron and phonon transmission path, and effective EMI shielding performance. To further confirm the effectiveness of functionalized CNFs/GN hybrids for demanding applications requiring high electrical conductivity, Zhan et al. have recently prepared a CFNs/GN nanocomposite film based on TEMPO-mediated CNFs (TM_CNFs) using a sonication approach and compared its properties with those of TM-CNFs/GO and TM-CNFs/rGO.141 They proved that despite the mechanical properties and the thermal stability of the different hybrids being within the same trend, the conductivity of TM-CNFs/GN that contains 20 wt% of pristine graphene is much higher than that displayed by both TM-CNFs/GO and TM-CNFs/rGO, which is attributed to the perfect conjugate system. The developed flexible product may find numerous applications in electronic devices through a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach.
6.2. Functionalized CNFs/GQDs hybrids
GQDs consist of the confinement of 1D graphene nanoribbon to a 0D structure167 and are different from the quasi-spherical carbon quantum dots, first produced by Xu et al.168 These small fragments of graphene display outstanding features such as luminescence, easy functionalization, high surface area, stability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity compared with the highly toxic metal-based quantum dots, and greatest surface grafting via the π–π conjugated network.169 They may contain several oxygen functional groups such as carboxyl, carbonyl, hydroxyl, and ether, making them more prone to blend into polymer matrices. Recently, some exciting review papers described the potential of these GQDs in numerous areas such as super-capacitors, batteries, photocatalysis, photodetectors, photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and hydrogen fuels.94,170 More recently, hybrids based on CNFs/GQDs have been prepared through different ratios, depending on the intended application, and emerged as a promising class of materials that exhibits outstanding potential in various fields such as 3D printing material, light-emitting diodes, surface plasmon resonance sensors, electrochemical sensors, supercapacitors, and fluorescent hydrogels. Their formation is mainly governed by several hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions that occur between both nanomaterials (Fig. 15Ia). An interesting review paper dealing with GQDs/nanocellulose has been recently published,96 hence only the more recent achievements about CNFs/GQDs will be described in the present section.

CNFs/GQDs hybrids are commonly produced via solution blending as schematized in Fig. 15Ib. Nevertheless, suitable experimental conditions such as material concentration, solvents, temperature, and pH should be chosen. This approach is effective since it facilitates molecular mixing and leads to homogeneous structures. Ruiz-Palomero et al. produced photoluminescent sensing hydrogels based on functionalized CNFs/GQDs hybrids using solution blending.144 First, they co-doped the carbon framework with sulfur and nitrogen atoms and functionalized CNFs with carboxylic groups. These nanomaterials were then mixed in a solvent, sonicated, and centrifuged to obtain the required gel. It was demonstrated that the preparation of the co-doped GQDs is crucial to producing gels because of the improved compatibility of the hosting chemiluminescent fluorophores through various interactions between the GQDs and CNFs.
In contrast, GQDs, which were doped only by one dopant, did not produce a gel. Moreover, the pH of the solution seemed to affect the gel's stability and strength directly, and it was proved that a neutral pH provides a better result. The obtained gel was tested for detecting the presence of trichlorophenol (TCP) in a water sample. The authors found that the gel has a selective sensing ability toward TCP via a fluorescence intensity enhancement. They claimed that this hybrid might be employed as biosensors in a wide range of applications such as biomedical and regenerative medicine, as well as printable conductive inks. In another work, Mahmoud et al. fabricated a similar type of nano-hybrid to assess it for electrochemical sensing of the anti-schizophrenic drug olanzapine (OLZ) in pharmaceuticals and human biological fluids, using a standard methodology.145 It is reported that doping GQDs with sulfur enhances the chemical and optical stabilities, alters the electronics features, and increases the number of adsorption sites while doping with nitrogen. Some carbon atoms in the sp2 hybridization are substituted by nitrogen. The doped GQDs display excellent temperature-sensitive photoluminescence characteristics as well. The obtained well-distributed porous functionalized CNFs/GQDs hybrid with a high surface area exhibited high electrical conductivity and faster electron transfer at the electrode surface, where it is attached.
Interestingly, the doping process with N and S increased the disordered structure and the defects within the hybrid structure, enhancing the electro-catalytic performance owing to the increased bonding and electron donor–acceptor features. The authors attributed the effective OLZ adsorption to the higher anchoring site number in the hybrid in addition to the higher surface area within the electrode and enhanced electrical conductivity. They claimed that these sensors could be employed to efficiently analyze human plasma, pharmaceutical tablets, and urine samples, owing to the hybrids’ high reliability, selectivity, and sensitivity toward OLZ detection.
Recently, natural gels such as hydrogels or aerogels combined with nanoparticles have emerged as a new category of materials with promising features in different areas. Those based on CNFs/GQDs have been identified as sensors and catalysts owing to their outstanding mechanical, optical, and electrical properties. Keshipour and Khezerloo prepared highly porous and hydrophobic aerogels based on CNFs and GQDs, as illustrated in Fig. 15II, intended to be used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the oxidation of reaction of alkenes, ethylbenzene, and alkenes to form carboxylic acids and ketones.146 They obtained a chemically stable nano-catalyst with a highly effective oil absorption ability. It is claimed that the designed hybrid displays the most critical required characteristics of the next generation of catalysts for which excellent selectivity and high yield under green and mild reaction conditions along with good biocompatibility and recyclability are exhibited. In other research, Ruiz-Palomero fabricated a hydrogel from CNFs/GQDs for sensing laccase.147 The homogeneous fluorescent hydrogel, shown in Fig. 15III(a and b), was produced through simple, eco-friendly solution casting. The developed hybrid is an alternative for enzyme immobilization and laccase monitoring. Weak interaction between laccase and graphitic layers may occur and then stabilizes by CNFs, causing energy transfer and subsequently the fluorescence quenching of the GQDs. This type of hydrogel may open up new avenues to developing environmentally sensitive, self-assembly, high catalytic activity biomolecules for a wide range of applications. More recently, the humidity sensitivity of aerogels based on CNFs and GQDs, which display abundant oxygen-containing groups and large hydrophobic surface area, has been highlighted by Huang et al.24 The authors reported that dropping the dispersion containing both nanomaterials onto an interdigital electrode followed by lyophilization generates a high-performance capacitive humidity sensor. This efficiency is attributed to strong binding interactions such as hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces between the fibrous CNFs and lamellar GQDs, hence generating a perforated and interconnected system with abundant active sites and migration channels for water molecules, as well as excellent homogeneity and uniformity, as shown in Fig. 15III(c). The authors claimed that the developed hybrids could be employed to monitor humidity for a wide range of applications.
6.3. Functionalized CNFs/GO nanostructures
To improve the properties and the effectiveness of CNFs for the current and next generation of materials for a wide range of applications, two methodologies, namely, the surface modification of CNFs through different functional groups or their integration within appropriate materials are commonly adopted by the research community.8,11,79 Nevertheless, combining of the above approaches has also been exploited and offers more efficiency. GO, identified as an outstanding 2D nanomaterial with exceptional features such as high mechanical properties, high dispersibility, high hydrophilicity, high binding potential, superior surface area, and modifiability, can impart exceptional advantages to CNFs and form high-performance hybrids.134 Besides that, GO tends to generate unalterable aggregates caused mainly by the large surface area, and the intermolecular van der Waals interactions, which may impede the production of efficient nanostructures. Moreover, GO's small size and hydrophilicity may restrict its practical use in various applications such as wastewater treatment, and thus further functionalization of GO can overcome these difficulties.171 Therefore, the functionalization of either CNFs or GO or both of them, which has recently received huge attention from scientists and researchers, using various molecules and different procedures, is revealed to be important for forming hybrids with tailorable features and better performance in various fields.171–173 Such types of hybrids, for which a synergistic combination of both CNFs and GO is carried out via appropriate covalent and noncovalent interactions producing active biohybrids, exhibit tailorable features such as morphology, supramolecular organization, self-assembly, surface chemistry, and thermal and mechanical characteristics, among others. The following section will discuss the most prominent hybrids obtained through several modifications of CNFs and GO, their properties, and their applications.
To produce effective functionalized CNFs/GO with a good distribution of the different ingredients, interesting methodologies have been recently developed by incorporating metallic and ceramic nanoparticles or synthetic and natural polymers, encompassing solution blending,174 layer-by-layer,175 wet-spinning,173 and hydrothermal176 approaches. Nonetheless, the solution blending method remains the simplest and most employed. Despite these hybrids holding great promise for application in several technological areas such as sensors, supercapacitors, and adsorbents, to cite a few, further optimizations of the hybrids’ production approaches, their compositions and characteristics need to be tailored to extend the number of uses and decrease the production costs for eventual scalability.
Solution blending is considered the most common fabrication approach to produce functionalized CNFs/GO hybrids, and may require multi-step procedures. The first step involves the dispersion of the raw materials in a solution. The second step consists of stirring, sonication, and shearing mixing, all together or individually to improve the mixture's homogeneity and uniformity. The last step concerns the drying process and the processing into the desired form. For instance, Xiong et al. reported an interesting modified GO/CNFs, hairy graphene, using an amphiphilic-driven assembly strategy for which pH is controlled to tune the interfacial hydrophobic–hydrophilic balance interaction between GO nanosheets and CNFs to facilitate their assembly.150Fig. 16(I) shows the pure nanomaterials and their hybrid structure prepared through the amphiphilic-driven assembly. The obtained porous hybrid, which displayed a high compressive elastic modulus above 180 GPa, exhibited an increase in wetting ability and hence may find application as filtration membranes, where fast water transport and good separation performance are demonstrated. In other research, Pan et al. also mention the critical role of the sol's pH when preparing GO/CNFs cryogels.177 These authors revealed that increased pH allows better dispersion of the nano-ingredients within a solution via enhancing the electrostatic repulsion. At a pH of 5.2, a regular micro-honeycomb GO/CNFs gel network with strong interactions was obtained through the unidirectional freeze-drying process.

From the application point of view, such hybrids, usually fabricated through a solution blending process, have been increasingly assessed for several intriguing applications such as transparent coatings,177 sensors,178 flame-retardant materials,164 and adsorbents/separation materials.171 The typical hybrids based on functionalized GO/CNFs are even considered among the most prominent adsorbents. They have been revealed as outstanding candidates for producing sustainable, eco-friendly membranes, aerogels, and smart nanocomposites owing to their unique mechanical features, flexibility, stability, adsorption capacity, surface charge density, and coordination with transition metal ions, and so forth.153,171,179 Recently, Zhu et al. prepared biohybrids based on functionalized CNFs and GO through a solution blending approach and employed them to remove water pollutants.172 The AFM analysis of the obtained membranes proved that GO nanosheets accumulate and attach along TEMPO-mediated CNFs. At the same time, the CNF filaments wrap around the wide flat GO, hence creating a porous and amorphous network (Fig. 16(II)). The porous self-assembled structure displayed a high retention capacity of heavy metals and organic dyes with effective adsorption. More recently, a facile and effective fabrication method was adopted by Wang et al. to produce a functionalized GO/CNFs aerogel, where GO was initially modified with silica particles.180 The efficiency of the aerogel was evaluated for methylene blue removal from an aqueous system. The authors demonstrated that the introduction of silica particles within the hybrid showed superior adsorption performance with a minimum value of 608.4 mg g−1. Another exciting piece of research that aimed to remove effluents from pharmaceutical waste was reported by Gupta et al., who prepared a nanohybrid from silica or carboxyl-functionalized GO and esterified CNFs.174 The presentation of plausible hydrogen bond interactions between carboxylated GO and esterified CNFs is depicted in Fig. 16(III). The adsorptive performance of the obtained porous hybrid to remove ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was demonstrated with outstanding reusability and repeatability, hence opening new ways to produce effective, sustainable, and cost-effective biohybrids for managing pharmaceutical pollution.
Spinning techniques such as wet-spinning and electrospinning were recently applied to produce functionalized GO/CNFs hybrids.173,181 For example, using a wet-spinning process, Yu et al. produced a hybrid using GO and carboxymethyl cellulose nanofibrils. They assessed it as an adsorbent for elimination of heavy metal ions in wastewater treatment.173 During the preparation, the hybrid was supplemented with Fe3+ ions to produce a high packing dense nanocomposite owing to the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding between Fe3+ and carboxyl groups. The obtained nanohybrid was claimed to exhibit effective lead (Pb2+) uptake with interesting adsorbent recovery. On the other hand, some advanced approaches such as hydrothermal and layer by layer (Fig. 16(IV)) have also been scrutinized to extend the applicability of functionalized GO/CNFs for a wide range of applications such as shape memory polymers, gas barrier films, and supercapacitors.175,176,182–184 Nevertheless, further research needs to be conducted shortly to push forward the effectiveness of these hybrids through the control of the production processes and the enhancement of the demanding properties for advanced applications.
6.4. Functionalized CNFs/rGO hybrids
The research and development of biobased renewable materials have recently attracted much attention owing to their particular features such as recyclability, interesting mechanical and thermal properties, biodegradability, low cost, etc.185,186 CNFs, as a prominent biobased material that exhibits outstanding physicochemical features such as high surface area, low density, and ease of modification through the abundance of hydroxyl groups, are considered an ideal feedstock for manufacturing advanced functional materials for a wide range of applications, especially when coupled with nanocarbons.151 Hybrid materials based on CNFs and graphene derivatives such as GN and GO have paved the way for designing novel materials that show promising characteristics such as high stiffness, strength, efficiency, and stability.16 Nevertheless, for some specific applications that require high performance, such as high conductivities, increasing GN loading within CNFs/GN hybrids is necessary.187 However, this methodology is not easy to implement in practice because the strong van der Waals interactions and π–π bond between GN sheets lead to irreversible layers’ restacking and agglomeration, hence causing the decrease of the specific surface area, although there have been some approaches mentioned to avoid this drawback such as grafting polymers or adsorbing surfactant onto the GN layer surfaces. Still, only some improvements have been achieved, as discussed in previous sections. As an interesting choice to overcome the GN drawback, GO that displays good dispersion owing to a large number of oxygen-containing groups on its surfaces and edges, which prevent the spontaneous formation of the interconnected GO nanolayers via electrostatic repulsion, seems an ideal choice to prepare a CNFs/GO hybrid with a high GO loading.103 Nevertheless, GO still suffers from some problems such as low conductivity, which can be obviously avoided through the conversion of GO to rGO, leading to high thermal and electrical conductivity by reducing the oxygenated groups and approximating toward the graphene phase, superhydrophobicity, high-quality interface, and even effective catalysis properties.188–190
As reported in subsection 5.3, CNFs/rGO exhibit promising characteristics and can be applied in several fields. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that a higher amount of rGO in the hybrid would harshly damage the mechanical features and hence reduce the performance, which would conceivably inhibit its applications in various areas.156 Therefore, to ultimately use and further exploit the new functions of CNFs and rGO, many researchers are devoting their interest to functionalizing either one of the nanomaterials (rGO and CNFs) or both of them, as can be seen in Table 2, in order to enhance the performance of the derived hybrids and extend their range of applicability.191 Such hybrids that exhibit outstanding performance and good mechanical strength and flexibility have been applied in various interesting fields like photocatalysts,192 supercapacitors,158 separation membranes,193 electromagnetic interference shielding materials,187 conductive paper-like films for wearable and portable electronic devices,156 and thermal interface materials,194 to cite a few. Table 2 summarizes some applications of these hybrids as well.
Some promising ways to control the interfacial interactions while boosting the performance of the CNFs/rGO hybrids consist of modifying the surface of rGO and/or CNFs through the introduction of different functional groups or their integration within appropriate materials such as polymers and other organic/inorganic moieties using suitable approaches (Table 2). The most common methods employed to produce functionalized CNFs/rGO hybrids include vacuum-assisted self-assembly (VASA),195 step-by-step vacuum filtration,156 layer-by-layer assembly,196 ball milling/freeze-drying,157 and the hydrothermal/freeze-drying process192 (Table 2). The preparation procedures may encompass a dispersion of GO and CNFs, followed by sonication and specific filtration and drying.195 The surface modification is usually performed during the main nanomaterials’ dispersion and even before mixing. At the same time, the reduction process may be carried out in situ or after the filtration stages.196,197 This latter process is usually performed through either chemical or thermal methods, but other reduction techniques depicted in Fig. 8 can also be applied. The chemical reduction can be realized via effective reducing agents such as hydroiodic acid, sodium borohydride, hydrazine and derivatives, glucose, chitosan, and ascorbic acid. In contrast, thermal reduction can be made through high temperature under protective inert gas, where the oxygen-containing chemical groups on GO are released as CO, CO2, and H2O.155 Song et al. prepared anisotropic thermally conductive flexible film based on TEMPO-functionalized CNFs and in situ reduced GO through the VASA technique, as shown in Fig. 17(I).197 The authors revealed that using 30 wt% of GO allows an in-plane thermal conductivity of 6.168 W m−1 K−1 to be reached. The post-reduction process, which provided interesting results in several applications, has been adopted in other research activities. For instance, Mohammed et al. recently dispersed TEMPO-functionalized CNFs and GO in a solution, which was then thermally reduced at 150 °C for 1.5 h, and vacuum filtrated.193 The obtained laminated structured membrane was then treated with oxygen plasma to generate nanopores on the surface in order to improve the filtration performance. In another work, functionalized CNFs/rGO (0.3 wt% GO) hybrid was produced using a solution casting using TEMPO-oxidized CNFs and GO.198 The dried film was then UV-irradiated under a nitrogen atmosphere. The schematic illustration of the reduction mechanism under UV radiation is depicted in Fig. 17(II). The obtained mechanically stable composite exhibits a dielectric constant of 119.2 at a frequency of 1 MHz and hence can be used in energy storage devices and high dielectric storage applications.

On the other hand, in contrast to the hybrids discussed above, where the CNFs underwent functionalization, some research works have focused on the functionalization of rGO instead of CNFs. For instance, Yang et al. produced a controllable heterostructure hybrid based on functionalized Ag–rGO and pure CNFs through a layer-by-layer self-assembly approach.194 The preparation method is schematized in Fig. 17(III). The hybrid film is intended to be used as a thermal interface material to overcome the issue of overheating damage due to the inappropriate thermal conductivity of substrates. The authors claimed that the introduction of 9.3 wt% of Ag–rGO to the hybrid led to a significant enhancement of the thermal conductivity and high heat transport rate owing to the constructed heterostructure between 2D rGO and 0D Ag nanoparticles within the hybrid.
In addition to a single functionalization of either rGO or CNFs, some research activities have been dedicated to functionalizing both CNFs and rGO within hybrids and assessing their properties and potential applicability in different fields. As an example, Jaio et al. employed TEMPO-functionalized CNFs and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified rGO to produce a functionalized CNFs/rGO hybrid.199 The schematic presentation of the fabrication method is provided in Fig. 17(IV). The authors demonstrated that the obtained hybrid displayed excellent thermal conductivity and better mechanical features due to the improved adhesions between both nanomaterials. Interestingly, it was shown that with the increase of rGO content, the thermal conductivities along the in-plane direction increased, while the through-plane remained low. The authors claimed that the developed approach could open the way to new design methodologies for the development of modern electronic devices.
7. Conclusions, challenges, and future trends
In this review, we have reported the recent progress and fastest-growing developments in cellulose nanofibrils/graphene hybrids, where more than 60% of the cited references are post-2017. The review first discusses the fundamental concepts of nanocellulose and graphene nanomaterials, then summarizes their production approaches, functionalization, properties, and application, with a specific interest in their excellent characteristics to clarify their unique attributes. The various production approaches for the CNFs/GNMs hybrids, their properties, and their uses have been comprehensively discussed.
The research that has been carried out clearly demonstrates that the combination of CNFs and graphene derivatives leads to functional materials with outstanding features owing to synergistic effects, which are still far from achievable by both nanomaterials taken separately. These hybrids provide a new direction for designing effective materials for numerous applications across a wide range of fields of science and engineering. To date, interesting progress has been made in the preparation, modification, characterization, and applications of CNFs/GNMs hybrids. Still, more in-depth research needs to be conducted to either develop new sustainable nanohybrids in a targeted manner or fill the current gaps through the practical shift from the laboratory scale to commercial and industrial production to achieve the operability of the final products and put them forward to the market.
CNFs/GNMs hybrids, which exhibit outstanding flexibility, thermal and electrical features, excellent mechanical strength, shape-retention ability, flexibility, and high porosity, are recently considered a research hotspot. They will certainly play a prominent role in developing the next generation of nanomaterials for several fields such as energy storage, biomedicine, optics, electronics, separation, catalysis, and sensing, to name a few. Nevertheless, numerous challenges still need to be addressed and carefully considered to fully exploit the potential of these hybrids in a practical way. The first and foremost issue concerns the deep understanding of the property dependences of CNFs and GNMs vis-à-vis the original source, the preparation method, functionalization, assembling approaches, interfacial interactions, and physicochemical properties. As for nanomaterials, batch-to-batch variability may exist and should be critically monitored, hence further systematic investigations should be undertaken. On the other hand, to consider the medical and pharmaceutical applications, the toxicity assessment and the biocompatibility of the hybrids remain key parameters that are not largely executed in the open literature and hence require regulatory approval. Moreover, the optimization of the whole production process of the hybrids and developing novel approaches are more than necessary. The life-cycle monitoring of some environmental aspects, the reduction of production costs and the enhancement of the performance should also be taken into account.
Therefore, the development of the next-generation high-performance CNFs/GNMs hybrids with appropriate structural design and suitable preparation approaches has become a key research direction, which is more than a prerequisite to promote the full substitution of the current few effective materials. Obviously, in the future, these hybrids will find a wide range of applications in current known fields and open new prospects in other emerging areas.
