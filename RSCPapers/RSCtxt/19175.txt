    , Accepted 8th September 2021First published on 9th September 2021AbstractIn this study, we synthesized a novel benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) copolymer (F13-R) by introducing ester-substituted thiophene into the PDiFPBDF-TBz (F13) backbone aiming to finely tune the molecular stacking and aggregation for non-fullerene as-cast polymer solar cell (PSC) applications. Compared with F13, F13-R displayed a slight blue-shifted absorption, a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.60 eV, and improved intermolecular stacking. In PSCs, it is found that the as-cast F13-R:IT-4F device, which does not need any solvent additive and thermal/solvent annealing, could achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.2% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.904 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.61 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 76.60%. The as-cast F13-R:IT-4F device is the first PSC fabricated from low-cost BDF polymers, and its performance is among the best performances in as-cast PSCs. These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the BDF polymer structure via a copolymer design could be an efficient strategy to develop low-cost and high-performance as-cast PSCs.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as a promising energy conversion technology due to their features, such as light-weight, mechanical flexibility and large-scale production.1–3 Benefitting from the rapid development of molecular innovation and device optimization,4–8 the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have surpassed 18% in single-junction PSCs.9 However, to reach the state-of-the-art PCEs, complicated treatments on the active layer, such as adding trace amounts of an solvent additive, thermal and/or solvent annealing, and using binary solvents and third components, are generally required. For example, the champion PCE of 11.41% of J71:ITIC PSCs was achieved via the thermal annealing treatment, but without thermal annealing, the as-cast PSCs can only obtain a PCE of 9.03%.10 However, these complicated treatments are significantly undesirable for the simple, low-cost and large-scale PCS fabrication. Moreover, small amounts (less than 2–3%) of high boiling point solvent additives, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), are difficult to precisely control in each device batch, and therefore, are removed afterward. Also, thermal or solvent annealing can further increase the process complexity and device fabrication cost.11–16 In contrast, in as-cast PSCs, the active layers are basically spin-coated from a single solvent without any of the above-mentioned treatments, and therefore are highly favorable and in demand for large-scale PSC fabrication in the commercial industries. Over the past years, the as-cast PSCs have achieved wide attention and demonstrated huge prospects in inkjet printing, roll-to-roll and doctor-blading processes.17–19 However, their developments are still mainly lagging behind these pre-/post-treated devices. The inherent crystallinity and miscibility of active layer materials are the critical factors for as-cast PSCs since they decide the polymer and acceptor blends’ phase-separation and morphology and further device performance. Thus, designing novel active layer materials such as polymer donors with appropriate crystallinity can be a primary and efficient approach to further promote the development of as-cast PSCs.
Polymer donors based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF) have attracted considerable attention. Compared with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) counterparts, BDF polymers not only possess renewable raw materials but also possess an extended planar structure, stronger intermolecular interactions and π–π stacking, which are due to the incorporation of a smaller furan unit into the polymer skeleton. With more number of electronegative oxygen atoms, BDF-based polymers also possess deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels compared to their BDT counterparts.20–25 Their successes in improving the open circuit voltages (Vocs) and PCEs have demonstrated great prospects in low-cost and efficient PSCs. However, BDF-based polymers often suffer from excessive crystallinity and severe self-aggregation, resulting in limited fill factors (FFs) in PSCs, which have to be finely controlled by adding trace amounts of solvent additives, thermal and/or solvent annealing, etc., in order to obtain high PCEs26–29 For example, PBDFTz-SBP:ITIC devices fabricated from a low temperature of a blend solution exhibited a PCE of only 7.95% with a low FF of 54.87%, while in a high temperature (120 °C) solution and with the addition of a small amount of diphenyl ether, the PCE could be promoted to 12.93% with a high FF of 75.19%.26 Similarly, we and others also report that the BDF polymers PDiFPBDF-TBz (F13) and L2-based non-fullerene PSCs could only achieve PCEs of 13.34% and 14.0%, respectively, after being treated by thermal annealing and 2-chloronaphthalene (CN) (or DIO) solvent additives.28,29 In fact, the strong aggregation effects and complicated treatments during the active layer deposition have hindered the application of BDF polymers in PSCs, particularly in as-cast PSCs.30,31 Therefore, it is very desirable and promising for low-cost and high-performance BDF PSCs if their active layers can be processed without any complicated treatments during the film deposition but still possessing high PCEs and FFs. To this end, the BDF polymer should be rationally designed to provide appropriate π–π stacking, which will ensure the formation of the desirable interpenetrating network in the as-cast active layer.32
Thus, in this study, we introduced the ethyl ester-substituted thiophene (TCO2) as the comonomer to finely tune the BDF polymer F13 structure to develop the highly efficient as-cast PSCs. The newly synthesized F13-R had a slight blue-shift absorption and a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.60 eV compared to F13. Also, the π–π stacking of F13-R was further enhanced. As a result, the as-cast F13-R:IT-4F device displayed a high PCE of 12.2% with a high Voc of 0.904 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.61 mA cm−2, and a high FF of 76.60%. This promising device performance was among the best photovoltaic performances of as-cast PSCs and even outperforms the performance of as-cast BDT-based devices, such as P2F-EHp:BTPTT-4F(Y6)33 and PBDB-T:6TIC-4F34 devices. In contrast, the as-cast F13:IT-4F device only exhibited a low PCE of 4.02% with a Voc of 0.820 V, Jsc of 9.11 mA cm−2 and FF of 53.86%. The higher Voc of F13-R devices is due to the deeper HOMO energy level; the superior PCE and FF are mainly contributed by the favorable miscibility and morphology of the F13-R:IT-4F active layer. These results demonstrate an alternative method to improve BDF polymers’ crystallinity and miscibility for highly efficient as-cast PSCs.
Result and discussion
The synthetic routes of F13-R with a molar ratio of (0.8:0.2) of TBz-Br and TCO2-Br are displayed in Fig. 1. TBz-Br, DiFPBDF-Tin and TCO2-Br were prepared according to previously reported mehtods.28,32,35 F13-R was synthesized via Stille copolymerization using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, and the details are provided in the ESI.† With the effect of TCO2, F13-R displayed improved solubility in common solvents, i.e., toluene and chlorobenzene, at room temperature. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement showed that a weight-average molecular weight of F13-R was 30.2 kDa.

The UV-Vis absorptions of F13 and F13-R in a dilute chlorobenzene solution and film state were investigated, and corresponding spectra are displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 1c. It can be seen that F13-R and F13 in solution and film states both displayed strong intermolecular charge transfer peaks.36 In solid state, the 0–1 peak of F13-R is located at 540 nm and the 0–0 peak is located at 581 nm, displaying a blue-shift of 10 nm compared with those of F13. The higher shoulder peak of the F13-R film may suggest improved π–π interactions.36 Moreover, the broad complementary absorption with IT-4F (Fig. 1c) could ensure their BHJ harvested more photons in the solar light range of 450–900 nm for a higher Jsc in devices. The absorption onset of the F13-R film was found at 634 nm, corresponding to a wide optical bandgap (Eg) of 1.96 eV.
To gain insight into the F13-R energy levels, we conducted the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry measurement (Fig. S2, ESI†), and its corresponding energy levels are displayed in Fig. 2a with that of other materials used in devices.37 The onset oxidation potential of F13-R was measured at 1.14 V vs. Ag/Ag+ with ITO as the working electrode, corresponding to a HOMO energy level of −5.60 eV, which is lower than the HOMO energy level of F13 (−5.54 eV) due to the electron-withdrawing effects of TCO2.32 According to the equation ELUMO = Eg + EHOMO, the highest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of F13-R was calculated to be −3.64 eV. The energy levels of these two polymers displayed good matching with the IT-4F acceptor. The lower-lying HOMO level of F13-R can be favorable to achieve a relatively high Voc,38 which is further confirmed by the F13-R:IT-4F device study.

The photovoltaic performances of F13 and F13-R in as-cast PSCs were investigated in an inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide (ZnO)/active layer/MoO3/Ag. IT-4F was selected as the electron acceptor due to its complementary absorption and well-matching energy levels with F13 and F13-R. Their current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices were obtained under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Among all F13-R:IT-4F devices fabricated from different treatments, such as solvent additive, thermal and/or solvent annealing, the F13-R2:IT-4F devices in the as-cast process displayed the best photovoltaic performances, suggesting that F13-R:IT-4F mixtures inherently form order and proper phase separation upon spin-casting.39–41 The champion PCE of as-cast F13-R:IT-4F is up to 12.2% with a Voc of 0.904 V, a Jsc of 17.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.60% (Fig. 2c), while the as-cast F13:IT-4F devices only gave a low PCE of 4.02% with a Voc of 0.820 V, a Jsc of 9.11 mA cm−2 and an FF of 53.86% due to the strong self-aggregation of F13. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported as-cast PSC device for BDF polymers. As shown in Fig. 2d and Tables S1, S2 (ESI†), the PCE of 12.2% is among the best photovoltaic performance of reported as-cast PSCs and even outperforms the as-cast BDT-based devices such as P2F-EHp:BTPTT-4F(Y6)33 and PBDB-T:6TIC-4F34 PSCs. It should be noted that the FF of 76.60% is also the best value among BDF-based devices, which are believed to be contributed by the improved π–π stacking and the desirable BHJ structure.26,32 The Voc of the F13-R based device is slightly higher than that of the F13-based device, which is in accordance with the lower-lying HOMO level of F13-R.
As shown in Fig. 3a, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of as-cast F13:IT-4F and F13-R:IT-4F devices are distributed from 300 nm to 800 nm, which are matched well with the absorption spectra. The F13:IT-4F devices yield poor EQE values below 45%, while the F13-R:IT-4F devices displayed a significantly improved photo-response of up to 70% in the range of 500–750 nm. It is noted that the EQE curve of the F13-R:IT-4F device showed an additional peak at around 450 nm compared with the F13:IT-4F device, which is believed to be contributed by the intermolecular charge transfer between the DiFPBDF unit and TCO2 unit in the polymer backbone. Overall, these demonstrate the more efficient extraction of excitons and suppressed charge recombination in F13-R based devices. The integrated Jsc values from EQE spectra (Fig. 3a) are in good accordance with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V test in less than 5% error.

To gain more information on the Jsc and FF values in F13:IT-4F and F13-R:IT-4F devices, we measured the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) and investigated the exciton dissociation. Jph is defined as Jph = JLight − JDark, where JLight and JDark are the device photocurrent densities under illumination and dark condition, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = Voc − Vbias, where Voc is the voltage when Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied bias voltage.42 As shown in Fig. 3b, when Veff approaches 1 V, the F13-R:IT-4F devices achieve a high Jph value to be saturated, suggesting all photogenerated excitons can be dissociated into free carriers and then collected by the corresponding electrodes. However, the F13:IT-4F devices displayed a strong dependence of Jph on Veff. At a Veff of more than 3 V, the Jph still could not reach saturation, indicating the vigorous recombination processes and limited transport behavior. Moreover, the charge dissociation probability (Pdiss) calculated from the Jph/Jsat was up to 95.90% for F13-R:IT-4F devices, which was much higher than Pdiss (77.75%) of F13:IT-4F devices. All these results demonstrate that F13-R:IT-4F PSCs possess the improved efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, thus resulting in better Jsc and FF.43
The charge transport properties of F13:IT-4F and F13-R:IT-4F blends were further assessed by hole- and electron-only devices according to the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The devices were fabricated with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:IT-4F/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/Polymer:IT-4F/Ca/Al structures for hole and electron mobility measurements, respectively.44,45 The corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3c and d. As listed in Table S3 (ESI†), the F13:IT-4F film exhibited a severely unbalanced charge transport (μh/μe = 5) with a high μh of 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a low μe of 2.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the charge transport (μh/μe = 1.6) of the F13-R:IT-4F film is balanced from μh of 6.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 4.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. These illustrate the higher Jsc and FF in F13-R devices. To further obtain deep insight into the bimolecular recombination of two devices, we measured the dependence of Jsc on light intensity (Plight).46,47 The curves of logarithmic Jscversus Plight are shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†). The degree of bimolecular recombination can be estimated by their slope (S), and when S is equal to 1, there is no bimolecular recombination that existed. For the F13:IT-4F device, the S was 0.90, while the S of the F13-R:IT-4F device was up to 0.98. The light-intensity dependence of Voc was also performed to investigate the trap-assisted recombination (Fig. S3b, ESI†). According to Voc ∝ (nkT/q) ln(Plight), the nkT/q values for as-cast PSCs of F13:IT-4F and F13-R:IT-4F are 1.25 and 1.05, respectively. These results demonstrated that the F13-R:IT-4F device possessed largely suppressed bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination, thus resulting in high performance.48
Since the device performances of as-cast PSCs greatly depend on the blend films’ morphology and phase domain,49 we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to obtain the information on two blends’ surface morphology. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the F13:IT-4F blend film exhibited a widely rough surface with a large root mean-square surface roughness (RMS) of 8.57 nm, while the F13-R:IT-4F blend showed a smooth rough surface with a much smaller RMS (2.72 nm). These indicated that compared with F13-R:IT-4F, F13-R:IT-4F tend to form uniform and appropriate aggregation states in the as-cast process, which is beneficial to interface contact between the active layer and MoO3/Ag for balancing the charge transport. Combining with the 3D images (Fig. 4c and d), these results reasonably demonstrate the presence of ordered nanoscale donor–acceptor (D–A) interpenetrating networks in F13-R:IT-4F BHJ and explain the significantly higher Jsc and FF in as-cast F13-R:IT-4F PSCs.50

To investigate the morphological difference of F13:IT-4F and F13-R:IT-4F blend films, the surface tensions were investigated via the contact angles of water and glycerol on the pure polymer and pure IT-4F film according to the Wu model.51 The related images are displayed in Fig. 5, and the corresponding contact angles are summarized in Table 1. Note that F13-R showed a smaller water contact angle (105.89°) in comparison with F13 (110.65°) due to stronger hydrophilicity resulting from the hydrophilic ester group of TCO2.52Table 1 displays the corresponding surface tension (γ) values of pure films. It can be seen that the γ values of the pristine F13, F13-R and IT-4F films are 16.76, 19.53 and 24 mN m−1, respectively. The lower surface tensions of F13 and F13-R donors than that of IT-4F indicate that donor and acceptor tend to segregate toward the top air surface and the bottom of the active layer, respectively.53 These can enrich the content of the polymer at the upper part of the blend, which can be confirmed by the contact angles of blend films as it is closer to that of polymer than IT-4F (Fig. S4, ESI†).19

The polymer miscibility and IT-4F in the blend film was estimated further with the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ). The χ is defined as , where K is a constant (K = 1), γdonor is the surface tension of F13 or F13-R donor, and γacceptor is the surface tension of the IT-4F acceptor.54,55 In general, the higher χ indicates that donor and acceptor in mixed states have poorer miscibility and thus tend to form a wider phase separation. As shown in Table 1, the χ between F13 and IT-4F is 0.47, which is two-fold of χ (0.23) between F13-R and IT-4F. A higher χ illustrates that F13 and IT-4F have poor miscibility in a mixture, reasonably explaining the higher roughness and larger-scale phase separation in F13:IT-4F BHJ and poor performance in as-cast devices. For F13-R and IT-4F,a much lower χ indicates better miscibility. The improved miscibility is believed to result in an appropriate donor–acceptor aggregation and ordered nanofibrous interpenetrating networks that contribute to the efficient exciton dissociation, balanced charge transport, higher Jsc and FF values in as-cast F13-R:IT-4F PSCs.56
Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully proposed a copolymerization strategy to develop a novel BDF polymer donor (F13-R) via introducing the ester-substituted thiophene into an F13 polymer backbone. Beneficial from the introduction of ester-substituted thiophene, F13-R displayed a deep HOMO energy level, favorable π–π stacking and morphology with IT-4F. As a result, the F13-R:IT-4F device promoted the PCE of the as-cast device exceeding 12% with a Voc of 0.904 V, a Jsc of 17.61 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 76.60% for the first time, while the as-cast F13 device displayed a poor PCE of 4.02% with a Voc of 0.820 V, a Jsc of 9.11 mA cm−2 and a low FF of 53.86%. The superior PCE and FF of F13-R devices were among the best photovoltaic performance of reported as-cast PSCs, including BDT-based devices. The FF of 76.60% was the best value among the BDF-based devices. The improved molecular aggregation, better miscibility and ordered nanofibrous morphology of the F13-R:IT-4F blend proved to be critical factors of superior PCE and FF of as-cast F13-R devices. These results demonstrate the high prospects of BDF-based polymers in developing highly efficient low-cost as-cast PSCs and provide a new insight into the BDF-based polymer design on copolymerization strategy.
