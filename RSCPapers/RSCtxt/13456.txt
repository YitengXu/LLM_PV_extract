Herein, we introduce a strategy focused on binary-mixed organic ETLs, which dopes an n-type small organic molecule, m-ITTC, into the fullerene [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETLs to fabricate a binary-mixed organic ETLs for use in inverted PSCs. The binary-mixed organic ETLs have suitable energy level alignment at the interface between the perovskite and ETLs, and thus the charge recombination behavior is modified. The PSCs modified with the binary-mixed organic ETLs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.62% with negligible hysteresis. Additionally, the binary-mixed organic ETLs can not only effectively prevent moisture intrusion, but also alleviate aggregation under continuous operation, so as, compared to PCBM ETLs, the devices with the binary-mixed organic ETLs exhibit better stability with a T95 of the best-performing devices exceeding 200 h. This work represents a simple and effective way to enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been widely researched due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low-cost, production standards1–3 and their outstanding photoelectric characteristics, such as having an ideal absorption coefficient,4 high carrier mobilities,5,6 long carrier lifetimes, and unique defect physics.7 Over the past several decades, their PCE has exceeded 25%,8 comparable to commercial photovoltaic materials, and the efficiency of all inorganic perovskite solar cells has also exceeded 20%.9,10
The most extensive architectures of PSCs are conventional (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) structures, where the perovskite layer is located between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transport layer (HTL). At present, PSCs with an n–i–p-structure have demonstrated higher PCE, whereas commonly used electron transport materials, for instance TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2,11–14 need to be calcined at high temperatures, which is not conducive to their mass production.15 Meanwhile, HTLs, for instance 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD),16,17 often contain hygroscopic dopants,18–20 and thus absorb moisture from the air and destroy the structure of the perovskite films, which is not conducive to their development in large-scale stable PSC modules. On the contrary, the PSCs with a p–i–n-structure are deemed more appropriate because they can be processed in solution at low-temperature, which excludes hygroscopic additives and results in negligible hysteresis. Thus, PSCs with a p–i–n-structure are more suitable for further enhancing the PCE and improving stability.21–23 New materials have been developed to improve the hole transport between the perovskite and anode, such as nickel oxide (NiOx) and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA),24–31 but relatively few ETLs have been reported for the inverted p–i–n-structure PSCs.32–34 [6,6]-Phenyl C61-butyrate methyl ester (PCBM) is the most commonly used ETLs in PSCs with an inverted p–i–n structure owing to its characteristic properties, such as good electron transport and the fact it can be processed in solution at low temperature.35,36 Nevertheless, PCBM has several limitations, such as nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/PCBM interface, segregation and aggregation under continuous thermal stress and it provides pathways for moisture to erode the perovskite film, resulting in the degradation of the photovoltaic properties.37 Nowadays, several approaches have been put forward to address these issues, including designing new ETLs molecules,38,39 introducing buffer layers at the perovskite/PCBM interface or the PCBM/electrode interface.40,41 However, these efforts increase the preparation costs and complicate the device fabrication process.
Instead, introducing binary-mixed ETLs by doping PCBM with additives could hopefully be an effective method for the modification of PCBM. For example, Cheng et al. introduced an n-type small organic molecule Y6 that acts as an effective ETL modifier and reported a PCE that can reach 20.02%.42 Li and co-workers employed poly(ethylene-covinyl acetate) (EVA) as a PCBM solution additive and found that it possessed a matched energy level, blocks ion migration, and improves the water–oxygen barrier of perovskite devices.43 Xu et al. found that PCBM doped with the polymer poly([N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)) (PNDI-2T) can improve homogeneity, enhance the electron mobility of the ETLs film and results in a higher PCE.44 Therefore, introducing a binary-mixed organic PCBM ETL is a significant way to improve the PCE and stability of PSCs.
In this work, we introduce a successful and facile method to fabricate binary-mixed organic ETLs (PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs) for PSCs by modifying PCBM with a direct doping material, an n-type small organic molecule, m-ITTC.45 The results show that the binary-mixed organic ETLs have a more suitable energy level, which is conducive to electron transport and can block holes from the perovskite layer, effectively reducing the photon energy loss due to charge recombination. Furthermore, the moisture resistant long chain structure of m-ITTC can not only improve PCBM aggregation, but also prevent moisture from eroding the perovskite film. Consequently, the PCE performance and stability of the PSCs are improved. The best-performing PSCs with a PCBM: m-ITTC ETL demonstrate a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 21.70 mA cm−2, an FF of 77.08%, and a PCE of 15.62% under an illumination of one sun. The photovoltaic parameters are higher than those of the PSC with a PCBM ETL, which has the following characteristics: Voc = 0.92 V; Jsc = 20.46 mA cm−2; FF = 71.41%; and a PCE of 13.37%. Moreover, the devices with the PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs also exhibit a better stability (T95, 216 h) than the device with only PCBM (T95, 72 h) at maximum power point tracking in an ambient atmosphere. This work provides a simple and efficient method to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
[6,6]-Phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, 99.5%) and PEDOT:PSS (4083) were purchased from Solamer Materials Inc. and Adamas, respectively. Methylammonium iodide (CH3CH2I) and lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%) were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich. m-ITTC was ordered from Solamer Materials Inc. The liquid reagents N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, anhydrous) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%, anhydrous) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
Preparation of pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs
The pristine PCBM ETLs (20 mg mL−1) was dissolved in chlorobenzene and stirred continuously overnight at room temperature. 20 mg of m-ITTC was dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene and stirred continuously overnight at room temperature. Then, PCBM and m-ITTC were mixed at different volume ratios before spin coating to prepare the treated ETLs of PCBM: m-ITTC in the following ratios: (1:0); (1:0.005); (1:0.01); (1:0.015); and (1:0.02).
Device fabrication
The ITO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance ∼ 10Ω sq−1) were cleaned sequentially with soap water, deionized water, acetone, and ethyl alcohol under sonication for 15 min, and treated with ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) for 15 min. The PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was filtered and deposited by spin-casting at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then thermally annealed at 150 °C in air for 15 min. Afterwards, the ITO/PEDOT:PSS was transferred into a N2-filled glovebox. Under a N2 atmosphere, the as-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite precursor solution was spin-cast at 5000 rpm for 30 s while chlorobenzene was quickly dripped on the rotating substrate to produce fast crystallization. Then, the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 material was thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Sequentially, the as-prepared PCBM or PCBM: m-ITTC (with various volume ratios) ETLs was spin-coated on top of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer at 2500 rpm for 30 s. The thickness of both the PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs was about 40 nm. Finally, under a high vacuum of 1 × 10−5 Pa, approximately 80 nm of Ag cathode was deposited, and the active area of the devices was measured to be 0.04 cm2.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was measured on an X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Ka radiation (Smart lab, Rigaku, Japan). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometry (UPS) was obtained on an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Scientific, USA). The UV-visible absorption spectra (UV-vis) were acquired using a UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrophotometer (Beijing Purkinje General Ins. Co. Ltd, China). The UPS and UV-vis spectra are shown in Fig. S2a and b (ESI†), respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were performed on a HITACHI s-4800 (Hitachi Limited, Japan) and Dimension Icon (Bruker, Germany), respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were characterized using a Keithley 2450 Source-Measure. The light source was a Newport 94023A Solar Simulator (Newport Co., USA) with a 450 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3-011 (EnliTechnology Co., Taiwan). The film thickness of the PSCs was obtained using a Profilometer XP-2 (Ambios Tech., USA).
Results and discussion
Herein, we fabricate inverted PSCs with PCBM ETLs doped with a small organic molecule, m-ITTC, and compare them with a pristine PCBM ETLs device. Fig. 1a and b shows the schematic illustration and real image of the inverted PSCs. The PSCs device architecture, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite(CH3CH2PbI3)/ETLs/Ag, and the chemical structures of PCBM and m-ITTC are displayed in Fig. 1a. The as-prepared PCBM and PCBM: m-ITTC solutions were spin-coated on the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite substrate. The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1b) of the PSCs shows a typical planar heterojunction configuration, wherein each layer is well-observed. Additionally, as shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), a perovskite layer with large sized grains of 200–500 nm is deposited on the PEDOT:PSS substrate with a void-free surface and is well-crystallized. The XRD pattern of the as-obtained perovskite layer on the PEDOT:PSS substrate is shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†). The perovskite layer exhibits strong diffraction peaks at 14.3° and at 28.6°, which are associated with the CH3CH2PbI3(110) and (220) phases, respectively. The surface SEM images and XRD measurements of the perovskite layer confirm the high crystallinity and purity of the CH3CH2PbI3 perovskite.

The modification of PCBM ETLs with m-ITTC is designed to adjust its electronic properties. Fig. 1c shows the electronic energy level diagram of the PSCs. The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PCBM:m-ITTC ETLs were determined from UPS and UV-Vis measurements (more detailed calculation results can be found in Fig. S2a and b in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1c, the LUMO of the PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs (−3.97 eV) is higher than that of the PCBM ETLs (−4.06 eV). Since the LUMO of the perovskite is at about −3.90 eV, there is a more ideal energy overlap between the PCBM: m-ITTC and perovskite, which can reduce the energy barrier and facilitate carrier transport from the perovskite to the ETLs. Moreover, the HOMO level of the PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs (−5.83 eV) creates a considerable energy barrier to the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (−5.40 eV), so preventing holes from effectively reaching the Ag cathode and reducing charge recombination.
At the same time, we also carried out an AFM study on the doped electron transport layer to study the roughness of the film. Fig. 2 shows the AFM images of the pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs on the perovskite substrate. The PCBM ETLs shows a relatively rough surface and its root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 1.17 nm (Fig. 2a). However, after doping PCBM with m-ITTC, the RMS roughness decreases to 0.788 nm (Fig. 2b), and the doped PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs exhibits a homogeneous and continuous film morphology. The improved homogeneity of the rough surface morphology that arises from the intermolecular interaction between the PCBM and m-ITTC, prevents the aggregation of the PCBM molecules.44 The more compact and uniform morphology that results from doping PCBM with m-ITTC can enhance the contact area of the perovskite/ETLs and decrease the leakage current.46

To investigate the influence of the ETLs on the optical trapping ability and spectral response range of the perovskite layer, normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of the ITO/Perovskite, ITO/Perovskite/PCBM, and ITO/Perovskite/PCBM: m-ITTC with volume ratios of PCBM: m-ITTC of (1:0), (1:0.005), (1:0.01), (1:0.015), and (1:0.02) were measured and are shown in Fig. 3a. The maximum absorption intensity is reached for the ITO/Perovskite/PCBM:m-ITTC (1:0.01) layer and further increase of the volume ratio of PCBM: m-ITTC did not cause a significant difference in the absorption spectra. Consequently, the doping of PCBM with m-ITTC with an optimized volume ratio has a positive effect on the optical trapping ability of the perovskite layer.

(b) J–V curves, measured under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) under forward scanning, of the PSCs with volume ratios of PCBM:m-ITTC of (1:0), (1:0.005), (1:0.01), (1:0.015), and (1:0.02). (c) J–V curves for the PSCs with pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs in different scan directions (forward and reverse). (d) EQE and corresponding integrated current density of the best PSCs with pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. 3b, in order to investigate the effect of doping PCBM ETLs with m-ITTC on the device power conversion efficiency of the PSCs, the typical J–V curves were obtained under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The J–V curves for the PSCs with PCBM:m-ITTC ETLs with volume ratios of (1:0), (1:0.005), (1:0.01), (1:0.015), and (1:0.02) are shown in Fig. 3b. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Compared with the pristine cells, it can be seen from Fig. 3b and Table S1 (ESI†) that the PCEs of the PSCs with PCBM:m-ITTC ETLs with volume ratios of (1:0.005) and (1:0.01) are increased. Nevertheless, when the volume ratio of the PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs is further increased to (1:0.015) and (1:0.02), the PCEs of the PSCs trend downwards. The PCE of the best PSCs is achieved at a PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs volume ratio of 1:0.01, which exhibits excellent photovoltaic parameters of Voc = 0.93 V, Jsc = 21.70 mA cm−2, FF = 77.08%, and a PCE of 15.62%. In comparison, the control PSCs with pristine PCBM ETLs presents a relatively poor performance with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 20.46 mA cm−2, an FF of 71.41%, and a PCE of 13.37%. Here, a significant enhancement in the Jsc (21.70 vs. 20.46 mA cm−2) and FF (77.08% vs. 71.41%) results is observed, which shows that the electron transportation in the PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs is much more efficient than that of PCBM ETLs. As a result, the PCE has a remarkably enhancement by 16.83% when PCBM is doped with m-ITTC.
As shown in Fig. 3c and Table 1, the hysteresis is of the PSCs is obtained by forward voltage scanning (FS) and reverse voltage scanning (RS) of the J–V curves. The PCBM:m-ITTC (1:0.01) sample exhibited a negligible hysteresis (0.58%, vs. 1.60% for the control sample). This may be attributed to the reduction of carrier recombination arising from the interaction between the PCBM:m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs and perovskite layer.47,48 The EQE and corresponding integrated current density of the best PSCs with pristine PCBM ETLs and with PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs are shown in Fig. 3d. It shows that the EQE spectra for the PSCs have a broad band at 300–800 nm and that their integrated current densities are 18.99 and 19.87 mA cm−2, respectively, consistent with the Jsc measured from the J–V curves and with an error of less than 9%. The high integrated current density is further evidence of the performance increase after doping PCBM with m-ITTC.

In order to study the influence of m-ITTC doping on carrier transport and extraction, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay measurements for the perovskite layers with different ETLs were acquired. As shown in Fig. 4a, we measured the steady-state PL responses of the perovskite, perovskite/PCBM, and perovskite/PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) layers on quartz substrates. The perovskite film has a characteristic emission peak around 768 nm, when the pristine PCBM is coated on the perovskite layer, and the PL strength can be effectively quenched. The PL intensity can be further significantly reduced by doping PCBM with m-ITTC, indicating that doping with m-ITTC is more conducive to electron transport and extraction.
 Fig. 4  (a) Steady-state PL responses of the perovskite, perovskite/PCBM, and perovskite/PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) layers on quartz substrates. (b) TRPL spectra of the perovskite, perovskite/PCBM, and perovskite/PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) layers on ITO substrates. 
We further investigated the effect of m-ITTC doping on carrier extraction by analyzing the TRPL spectra. The TRPL responses, monitored at a wavelength of 768 nm, for the perovskite, perovskite/PCBM and perovskite/PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) layers on ITO substrates are shown in Fig. 4b, and the detailed fitting parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). In general, two relaxation pathways in the perovskite layer will cause the decay process, the fast decay lifetime (τ1) is derived from the non-radiative decay of ETLs, similar to electron extraction, and the slow decay lifetime (τ2) is attributed to the radiative decay in the perovskite layer. We can clearly see that there is a significant decay process in the perovskite layer, resulting in decay lifetimes of τ1 = 10.00 ns and τ2 = 241.82 ns. Nevertheless, the fast decay process also exists at the perovskite/ETLs interface. Compared to the pristine PCBM ETLs (τ1 = 1.28 ns, τ2 = 5.56 ns), the decay of the TRPL of PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs (τ1 = 1.14 ns, τ2 = 5.29 ns) is quicker, therefore, rapid charge transfer at the perovskite/ETLs interface is once again demonstrated.49–51
The kinetic characterization of the charge transfer at the perovskite/ETLs interface was carried out using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of PSCs with pristine PCBM ETLs and with PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs in the dark at the same applied voltage (bias = 0.1 V), the equivalent circuit model for the PSCs is shown in the inset. From the Nyquist plots, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) values are 6.07 and 2.44 Ω for the PSCs with pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs, respectively. The smaller Rct of the PSCs with PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs is mainly consistent with an improved carrier transfer capacity at the perovskite/ETLs interface in the PSCs, resulting in a higher Jsc and PCE for the PSCs.

(b) Stability of the best PSCs with pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs. Measurements were performed without any encapsulation under the same ambient atmosphere in the dark (relative humidity ca. 40%, temperature ca. 23.5 °C). Contact angles of the pristine PCBM ETLs (c) and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs (d) on the perovskite substrate. 
The stability and efficient reproducibility of PSCs is also an important indicator of its performance. Fig. 5b shows the PCE decay of the best devices without any encapsulation of the pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs under the same ambient atmosphere in the dark (relative humidity ca. 40%, temperature ca. 23.5 °C). T95, defined as the time when the cell retains 95% of initial efficiency,52 was used to evaluate the best devices with pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs. After 72 hours of storage under ambient atmosphere without any encapsulation, the normalized PCE of the device with pristine PCBM ETLs gradually decreased to 95% of its initial efficiency. After 240 h, the PSCs using PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs maintained about ca. 95% of its initial value, while the PSCs with pristine PCBM ETLs achieved about ca. 85% of its initial efficiency. This demonstrates an increase in the T95 of more than 200% from 72 to 240 h.
Further, we conducted water contact angle experiments for the pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the contact angles of the pristine PCBM ETLs and PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) are 91.01° and 102.31°, respectively. This indicates that doping PCBM with m-ITTC increases the hydrophobicity of the PCBM ETLs. Hence, the ETLs of PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs is beneficial for preventing moisture from invading the PSCs and improving its stability.53,54 The superior ambient stability of the device with PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs is due to its better hydrophobicity and lower levels of aggregation, which slow down the decomposition of the perovskite layer. As shown in the histograms in Fig. S3 (ESI†), a statistical study of the photovoltaic parameters from 40 devices with PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs was carried out. The PSCs with PCBM: m-ITTC (1:0.01) ETLs shows good photovoltaic performance with average PCE of ca. 14.12%. The fluctuation of all parameters is relatively small which indicates good reproducibility.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated that incorporating m-ITTC into PCBM can modify the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The long chain structure of m-ITTC affords multidentate interactions to effectively inhibit the excessive aggregation phenomenon observed in pristine PCBM, contributing to a significant increase in orderly molecular stacking. Meanwhile, this orderly molecular arrangement means that PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs does not have a nonuniform morphology. Furthermore, the energy levels of the doped material are a better match for the perovskite, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs increases from 13.37% for the PCBM ETLs to 15.62% for the PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs, a 16.83% improvement in the PCE. Finally, the PCBM: m-ITTC ETLs devices exhibit better air stability than the pristine PCBM ETLs device due to improved hydrophobicity and lower levels of aggregation of the binary-mixed organic film, preventing moisture from eroding the perovskite film. Altogether, this method of incorporating an organic molecule with a bulk dopant into one binary-mixed organic ETLs is simple and effective and provides a promising strategy to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs.
