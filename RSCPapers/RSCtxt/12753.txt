    , Accepted 10th February 2016First published on 16th February 2016AbstractWe synthesized two novel ultra low bandgap donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers (Eg ≤ 1.2 eV), containing the thiadiazoloquinoxaline unit as the main electron accepting unit (A) and benzodithiophene (BDT) and dithienosilole (DTS) as different donor units (D), denoted as P1 and P2, respectively, using the cross-coupling Stille reaction. The copolymers possess light absorption ranging from UV (350 nm) to near-IR (1300 nm) with optical bandgaps of 1.16 eV and 1.08 eV, respectively. Quantum-chemical calculations and experimental data were compared for proposing a more detailed concept for the optical and electronic properties of these copolymers which can be used as donors for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The PSCs based on optimized P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM showed overall power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.32% and 3.48%, respectively. Although P2 possesses a broad absorption coverage of up to 1300 nm, the lower PCE may be attributed to the low Jsc, due to the poor driving force for exciton dissociation, since the LUMO offset with PC71BM is less than 0.3 eV. The PCE has been significantly increased to 7.27% and 6.68% for solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treated P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM active layers, respectively. This improvement arises from the appropriate nanoscale morphology and an increase in hole mobility, induced by the SVA treatment of the active layers.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on bulk heterojunction active layers (blends of polymers as electron donors and fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors) have attracted a lot of attention due to their exclusive advantages in combining lightweight, flexible and large area devices at low cost of fabrication.1 Record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of around 10% for single layer BHJs2 and 11% for tandem solar cells3 have been achieved in recent years via molecular engineering of new low bandgap donor materials. An ideal polymer donor material for PSCs should possess a broad band absorption covering from visible to near infrared regions of the solar spectrum to achieve a high short circuit current, suitable frontier energy levels matching with the fullerene acceptor to attain a high open circuit voltage, sufficient solubility to assure the ability of the solution process to form a nanoscale bicontinuous network and high hole mobility for efficient charge transport.
In recent years, low bandgap polymeric materials absorbing light up to the near-IR range have been of great interest for polymeric solar cells (PSCs), photo-sensors and field effect transistors (FETs).4 Using near-IR photovoltaic polymeric materials may expand light absorption up to the near-IR and even beyond the 1000 nm range that could possibly enhance PCE of PSCs. Although conjugated ultra low bandgap polymers have been synthesized earlier,5 the design and synthesis of the polymers absorbing light beyond the 900 nm range with neatly regulated energy levels and considerable PCE in polymer:fullerene PSCs are highly demanded. D–A polymers with strictly alternating strong electron-accepting and strong electron-donating construction blocks are generally used for the fabrication of ultra low bandgap polymers and are highly required for photon absorption in the long wavelength solar spectrum range where high photon flux exists. Assuming that a transparent electrode possesses 85% transmittance of the standard solar spectrum (AM 1.5G), then the theoretical maximum short circuit current density (Jsc) of PSCs would be 14.3 mA cm−2 in the 300–650 nm range. If one expands the photocurrent response to 1000 nm, then the maximum short circuit current density would be increased up to 31.9 mA cm−2.6 These simple calculations clearly demonstrate that the absorption spectrum has significant effects on the photovoltaic characteristics, especially Jsc. NIR-polymers absorb a significant fraction of solar light that makes it possible to obtain Jsc higher 30 mA cm−2. In recent years, a number of infrared absorbing polymers for PSC applications have been reported. However, all of these NIR-polymers were found to have efficiency lower than 1%7 which is due to low incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values in the near-IR spectral range. Nevertheless, Wong et al.8a and Yang et al.8b have developed single junction NIR-polymer based PSCs with high efficiency of 6% and 7%, respectively. Also, it was recently reported that a tandem device based on a medium bandgap and NIR conjugated polymers as one of the donor polymers reached a high efficiency of 10%.9 These recent efforts inspired us to develop novel NIR-absorbing polymers for PSC applications. To obtain D–A NIR polymers strong electron-donor and strong electron-acceptor structures need to be used. Generally, strong electron donor monomers include pyrrole, thiophene, ethylenedioxythiophene, benzodithiophene (BDT), bithiophene derivatives, dithienosilole (DTS), etc. Among them BDT and DTS units possess symmetric and rigid planar structures with enhanced π-conjugation. Usually BDT and DTS based polymers exhibit a broad absorption range, high charge carrier mobility and a low-lying HOMO compared to polymers based on other electron-donating units. On the other hand, most prominent electron-deficient units used for the D–A NIR polymer design are diketopyrrolopyrrole,10 benzobisthiadiazole,11 pyrazinoquinoxaline,12 benzotriazole, thienoisoindigo,13etc.
In our effort to develop novel D–A NIR-absorbing polymers, we started from the thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TDAZQ) derivative as the central strong accepting unit due to its rigid planar structure and the presence of four imino groups with unique properties such as high charge carrier mobility, intensive spectral absorption up to the IR range and ease of functionalization with various aryl- and alkyl-groups for improving solubility. Despite the use of TDAZQ-based conjugated polymers in PSCs, only a limited number of structures with ultra low bandgaps (Eg < 1.4–1.5 eV) have been presented up to date. They are highly demanded and their studies are relatively limited.1b
In this manuscript, two novel low bandgap D–A copolymers with the same TDAZQ unit as a strong acceptor and different BDT and DTS as electron donors, denoted as P1 and P2, respectively, were designed and synthesized using the cross-coupling Stille reaction. The optical, electrochemical and PSC characteristics of the obtained polymers were investigated systematically. The new synthesized copolymers possess broad (panchromatic) absorption spectra in the 300–1300 nm range with optical bandgaps below 1.2 eV. These copolymers were used as donor materials along with PC71BM as an acceptor for solution processed BHJ PSCs. PSCs with bulk heterojunctions based on optimized P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM blends cast from chloroform solution demonstrate overall PCEs of 4.32 and 3.48%, respectively. The PCEs have been further improved up to 7.27% and 6.68% for solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treated P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM active layers, respectively.

All the starting materials and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. All reactions involving air-sensitive reagents were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. 2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(dodecyl)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene monomer (M1)14 2,2′-bistrimethylstannyl-4,4′-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (M2)15 and brominated monomer 8,12-bis(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-2,5-di(nonadecan-3-yl)[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]bis[1,3]thiazolo[4,5-a:5′,4′-c]phenazine (M3)16 were prepared according to the known literature procedures.

After cooling to r.t., the reaction mixture was poured into methanol (200 mL) and filtrated. The polymer was dissolved in CHCl3 and precipitated with methanol. Then it was purified by extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform in a Soxhlet apparatus. The polymer was recovered as a solid from the chloroform fraction by precipitation from methanol, filtered off, and dried under vacuum to obtain as black solid yield 81%.

NMR 1H and 13C spectra of the starting compounds and polymers were recorded on a spectrometer Bruker Avance-400 with a working frequency of 400.13 and 100.62 MHz, respectively. IR spectra were recorded using an FT-IR spectrometer Perkin-Elmer 1720-X and TGA analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 at a heating rate of 20 deg min−1. The average molecular weight and polydispersity were analyzed on a GPC instrument from Waters, consisting of a pump M-600, two U-Styragel linear columns, spectrophotometric detector M-484 and data acquisition and processing system Maxima. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded using a Tecnai G2F30 transmission electron microscope (FEI Inc.; accelerating voltage = 300 kV).

Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
The PSCs were fabricated in a conventional structure i.e. ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1 or P2:PC71BM/Al. First of all, indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glasses were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 20 min and dried under ambient conditions. After that, a thin layer (35 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) was spin coated at 3500 rpm for 40 s on the ITO coated glass substrate and subsequently baked at 120 °C for 15 min in air. The copolymers and PC71BM (total concentration of 20 mg mL−1) at different weight ratios were dissolved in chloroform and spin coated at 2000 rpm for 1 min on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. For the solvent vapor annealing (SVA), the active layer was kept in a glass Petri dish containing 200 μL THF for 20 min at room temperature. The average thickness of the active layer was about 90 nm. A cathode consisting of Ca (10 nm) capping with aluminum (∼30 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation under a shadow mask with a base pressure less than 10−5 Torr, on top of the active layer. The active area of the devices was ∼20 mm2. The current–voltage characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley1238 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to provide the stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured illuminating the device through the light source and monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.
The hole-only devices with ITO/PEODT:PSS/active layer/Au were also fabricated in an analogous way, in order to measure the hole and electron mobilities.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the targeted P1 and P2 copolymers are described in Scheme 1. The copolymers poly(4,8-didodecyloxybenzo[1,2-b:3,4-b]dithiophene-8,12-bis(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-2,5-di(nonadecan-3-yl)[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]bis[1,3]thiazolo[4,5-a:5′,4′-c]phenazine) (P1) and poly(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole-8,12-bis(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-2,5-di(nonadecan-3-yl)[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]bis[1,3]thiazolo[4,5-a:5′,4′-c]phenazine) (P2) were prepared via a palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction between 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(dodecyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene monomer (M1) (or 2,2′-bistrimethylstannyl-4,4′-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole M2) and brominated monomer 8,12-bis(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-2,5-di(nonadecan-3-yl)[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]bis[1,3]thiazolo[4,5-a:5′,4′-c]phenazine (M3) with yields ranging from 81% to 66%.

After polymerization, crude polymers were washed using Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform in sequence. The title polymers were obtained by reprecipitation of their concentrated chloroform solutions from methanol. Both P1 and P2 can be readily dissolved in common solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and tetrahydrofuran, which is attributed to the incorporation of solubilizing alkyl chains adjoined to thiophene flanks of the polymer backbone. The structures of the obtained copolymers were confirmed using elemental analysis, 1H NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of P1 and P2 in CDCl3 are shown in Fig. 1. The peaks at 7.30–9.60 ppm are assigned to the proton response of aromatic units. There are peaks at δ 4.50–3.00 ppm which are attributed to methylene groups (c, d, and e) (Fig. 1). The peaks in the range δ 1.90–0.77 ppm arise from alkyl substituents. All of the integral ratios of peak areas between the aromatic and aliphatic signals agree with the corresponding molecular structures of the polymers.

The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent. The molecular weights and thermal properties of the P1 and P2 are summarized in Table 1. The GPC results indicated that copolymers P1 and P2 have number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 10.4 and 8.3 kDa with narrow PDIs of 1.94 and 1.57, respectively. The thermal properties of polymers were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) (Fig. 2). Decomposition temperatures (Td) (5% weight loss) were 335 °C and 408 °C for P1 and P2, respectively. This indicated that the thermal stability of the copolymers is enough for PSC applications.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of the two copolymers were measured by UV-Vis spectroscopy both in chloroform solutions and in the thin films. The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of P1 and P2 in chloroform solutions and in solid state are presented in Fig. 3 and the corresponding optical properties are summarized in Table 2. Both copolymer films show two main absorption bands in the wavelength ranges 350–650 nm and 750–1300 nm, corresponding to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone and intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor units, respectively.17 As can be seen from Fig. 3 that the absorption peak corresponding to the ICT band in thin films for both copolymers red shifted as compared to that in solution, indicating that strong π–π-stacking and aggregation of polymer main chains occurred in the films. The ICT band of P2 in both solution and thin films is red-shifted as compared to P1 due to the enhanced planarity and expanded conjugation due to DTS. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of P1 and P2 were estimated to be 1.16 eV and 1.08 eV, respectively, deduced from the absorption edges of the corresponding thin film absorption spectra, according to the expression, Eoptg = 1240/λonset. The TDAZQ based polymers show an extended absorption towards the near-infrared region (beyond 1200 nm). However, both polymers show a weak absorption in the 590–700 nm region of the active solar spectrum, which may result in the low photon harvesting in PSCs but may be compensated by the absorption spectra of PC71BM due to its strong absorption covering from 350 to 750 nm, when a blend of these copolymers with PC71BM is used as the active layer.

The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of both copolymers were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the thin films. The reduction and oxidation curves of the copolymers are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2. From CV measurements, both the clear oxidation peak and the reduction peak were observed for the P1 and P2 polymers. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers were calculated from the onsets of the oxidation (Eoxonset) and reduction (Eredonset) peaks, respectively, while the potentials were determined using ferrocene (Fc) as the standard according to the following equations:  The potential of ferrocene vs. SCE is used as an internal standard. Accordingly, the HOMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.34 eV for both P1 and P2, which are in good agreement with the ideal HOMO energy levels to ensure good air stability and high open circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs.18 Deep HOMO energy levels of copolymers are desired for achieving a higher Voc in the BHJ PSCs and making these copolymers promising candidates for use as polymer donor materials. It is obvious that the HOMO energy levels of the two polymers are identical due to the presence of the same backbone, which is dependent on the donating units. The LUMO levels were thus calculated to be _3.88 eV and _3.94 eV for P1 and P2, respectively, which provide LUMO offsets of 0.32 and 0.26 eV between the P1 and P2 and PC71BM (LUMO ∼−4.2 eV), respectively. This offset is very close to 0.30 eV which is generally accepted as the minimum driving force for efficient exciton separation into free charge carriers.19 Recently, it was found that charge separation also occurs when the LUMO offset is below 0.30 eV,20 indicating that these copolymers can be used as electron donors for PSCs. The electrochemical band gaps (Eelecg) are 1.46 and 1.40 eV for P1 and P2, respectively, which are close to the ideal band gap for PSC donor materials. The difference between the optically and electrochemically measured energy gaps can be explained by the exciton binding energy of the conjugated copolymers. These results show that extension of π-conjugation of TDAZQ is a viable strategy to obtain stronger acceptors, with lower band gaps, and the copolymers thus possessing deep LUMO and HOMO levels.

Theoretical calculations
We have additionally performed a theoretical study on the P1 and P2 molecular structures within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The initial geometry optimization calculations were performed employing the gradient corrected functional PBE21 by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof. The def-SVP basis set22 was used for all of the calculations. At this stage of the calculations, to increase the computational efficiency (without loss in accuracy), the resolution of the identity method23 was used for the treatment of the two-electron integrals. Subsequent geometry optimizations were further performed using the hybrid exchange–correlation functional B3LYP24 as well as Truhlar's meta-hybrid exchange–correlation functional M06,25 and the same basis set. Tight convergence criteria were placed for the SCF energy (up to 10−7 Eh) and the one-electron density (RMS of the density matrix up to 10−8) as well as for the norm of the Cartesian gradient (residual forces both average and maximum smaller than 1.5 × 10−5 a.u.) and residual displacements (both average and maximum smaller than 6 × 10−5 a.u.). Solvent effects were included for chloroform (CF) using the integral equation formalism variant of the polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM), as implemented in the Gaussian package.26
TD-DFT excited state calculations were performed to calculate the optical gaps of P1 and P2 using the same functionals and basis set on the corresponding ground state structures. The UV/Vis spectra were calculated using the B3LYP and M06 functionals. Initially, the geometry optimizations were performed using the Turbomole package.27 All of the follow up calculations were performed using the Gaussian package.26
The first round of calculations was the geometry optimizations of the P1 and P2 structures. To increase the computational efficiency the alkyl groups were truncated to ethyl groups. Vibrational analysis on all of the optimized structures did not reveal any vibrational modes with imaginary Eigen-frequencies, i.e. the final optimized structures are true local (if not global) minima. The structures are not planar with the thiophene moieties forming dihedral angles in the range 42°–51° depending on the functional and the presence of solvents with the TDAZQ moiety, and in the range 18°–24° with the BDT moiety (for P1) and 29°–30° with the DTS moiety (for P2). We have calculated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the optical gaps, defined here as the energetically lowest allowed vertical electronic excitation, employing the PBE, M06, and B3LYP functionals. In Table 3 in addition to the frontier orbitals' energy levels, we also provide the optical gap, the main contributions to the first excitation as well as the wavelength of the first excitation and of the excitations with the largest oscillator strengths.

In addition to the B3LYP functional, we have also performed our calculations employing the M06 functional. The M06 meta-hybrid functional was chosen since it provides leveled performance over transition types.28,29 We provide the results using all three functionals, which can additionally be used for comparison with the literature.
The HOMO–LUMO (HL) gap of each structure calculated using the hybrid B3LYP functional is notably smaller, by ∼0.4 eV, than that using the meta-hybrid M06 functional, however, the calculated optical gaps are only marginally smaller, with a difference ∼0.1 eV. In Table 3, we also provide the character of the first allowed excitations only for contributions larger than 4%. The first excitation, as calculated by each of the functional for all three structures, clearly exhibits a single-configuration character. In Fig. 5, we have plotted the iso-surfaces (isovalue = 0.02) of the HOMO and LUMO for P1 and P2. For both of the structures the HOMO extends over the main body. For the LUMO of each structure the delocalizations are qualitatively different. The LUMO of both P1 and P2 extends mainly over the TDAZQ moiety and only minimally over linking thiophenes. The contributions of the PDOSs for P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We partition all of the structures into the linking thiophenes, the moiety and aliphatic groups for both structures, and additionally to BTD for P1 and DTS for P2. Both structures have high contributions to the HOMO from the TDAZQ moiety, specifically at 60.3% for P1 and at 53.7% for P2. The linking thiophenes also have high contributions to the HOMO, at 24.0% for P1 and at 25.6% for P2, which results in an extensive delocalization along the main chain of the structure. The situation is different for the LUMO of the structures, which in both cases extends almost exclusively over the TDAZQ moiety, at 88.1% for P1, and at 88.6% for P2. Only moderate contributions are noted from the BDT moiety to the HOMO of P1 which is at 14.3%, and of the DTS moiety to the HOMO of P2 which is at 19.4%. The remaining minor contributions are from the linking thiophene moieties at 9.6% for P1, and 9.2% for P2. These are in agreement with our earlier observations of the orbital delocalizations.

In Fig. 6, we show the UV/Visual absorption spectra of the P1 and P2 structures calculated at the TD-DFT/M06 level of theory, both accounting for solvent effects for CF and in gas phase. The spectra have been produced by convoluting Gaussian functions with HWHM = 0.18 eV centered at the excitation wavenumbers. In Fig. S2 (see ESI†), we also provide the corresponding spectra calculated using the B3LYP functional, which is in good agreement with the spectra recorded using the M06 functional, and only slightly overestimate in the long wavelength region by ∼35 nm and in the short wavelength region by ∼15 nm. The calculated absorption spectra of P1 and P2 have significant similarities; they exhibit three main bands of high absorbance; one centered at large wavelengths ∼800 nm, and two centered at smaller wavelengths at 320 nm and 420–440 nm. Additional low intensity peaks are also noticeable at the smaller wavelengths regions. In the ESI† we provide all of the high intensity peaks with the corresponding oscillator strengths (Tables S1 and S2).

Photovoltaic properties
PSCs were fabricated by spin coating the mixture of P1 or P2 with PC71BM from chloroform solution. The active layer was sandwiched between transparent ITO/PEDOT:PSS and Al electrodes. Initially, we examined the different P1 or P2/PC71BM weight ratios to optimize the weight ratio and the best photovoltaic performance was obtained with a blend weight ratio of 1:2 cast from CF solution. Fig. 7a shows the current–voltage characteristics under illumination and the related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4. As shown in figure, the P1:PC71BM device showed a PCE of 4.32% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 8.84 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.52, which is superior to that of the PSC based on P2:PC71BM with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 7.26 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.50. The Voc of both devices is quite high and almost the same which is attributed to the deep and similar values of HOMO energy levels, since the Voc of a BHJ PSC is related to the HOMO of donor and LUMO of acceptor energy offset.30 The higher PCE of the device based on P1 as compared to P2 under identical conditions is mainly due to the enhanced value of Jsc for the former than the latter, and all other parameters are slightly changed. The increased Jsc could be confirmed from the IPCE spectra (Fig. 7b). As shown in Fig. 7b, the IPCE response of these devices covers a broad range from 350 to 1100 nm and 350 to 1200 nm for P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM, respectively, which corresponds to the absorption of both the copolymer donor and fullerene. Although the IPCE spectrum is broader for P2:PC71BM than that for P1:PC71BM, the IPCE values of the former device are higher than that of the latter. This means that more excitons are generated in P2:PC71BM than P1:PC71BM, but the exciton dissociation rate is higher for P1:PC71BM than that for P2:PC71BM. The exciton dissociation rate depends upon the LUMO offset between the donor and the acceptor and should be higher than the exciton binding energy (∼0.30 eV). Since the LUMO offset for P2:PC71BM is around 0.26 eV, and all the excitons generated in this layer are not dissociated into free charge carriers due to the insufficient driving force for exciton dissociation and resulted in low Jsc and IPCE.

The energy loss i.e. Eg − qVoc is the factor which is also responsible for the overall PCE of the organic polymer solar cell and this should be greater than 0.5 eV.20b,31 In our devices, this loss is about 0.52 eV and 0.44 eV for P1 and P2 based devices, respectively, considering that the energy gap is an electrochemical bandgap. The higher value for P1 may be responsible for higher PCE than P2. These low energy losses may be related to the molecular constitution of the conjugated plane.
The overall PCE of the PSC using P1 or P2 as an electron donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor is low compared to the latest development in PSCs. Although the Voc of these devices is quite high, their low PCE is mainly due to the low Jsc and FF. These two parameters are directly related to the light harvesting efficiency of the active layer, film morphology, exciton dissociation rate and charge transport. It can be seen from the absorption spectra of P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM that the absorption covers a broad wavelength region of the solar spectrum and we conclude that the low Jsc may be attributed to the poor nanoscale morphology of the active layer and charge transport. For an efficient PSC, the BHJ active layer should be composed of a bi-continuous network of donor and acceptor component. In most of the organic BHJ organic solar cells, the Jsc value is related to both electron and hole transport efficiencies within the active layer. In the BHJ active layer, the electron mobility is higher (by 2–3 orders of magnitude) than the hole mobility, resulting in unbalanced charge transport.32 Moreover, a well defined nanoscale morphology with better phase separation within the exciton diffusion length in the active layer is necessary for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport33 and also to minimize the charge pair recombination.34 It has been reported that solvent vapor annealing (SVA) using polar solvents before deposition of the cathode is an effective way to increase the PCE of the PSCs via the formation of a more favorable nanomorphology and phase separation.35 Therefore, we have employed a SVA treatment of the active layers to improve the PCE of PSCs based on these copolymers. It can be seen from Fig. 7 and Table 4 that compared to the performance of the PSCs without SVA treatment, the PCEs of these copolymers based PSCs increased significantly after the SVA treatment of the active layers. The PCEs increased from 4.32% to 7.27% and 3.48% to 6.41% for the P1 and P2 based devices, respectively. To our best knowledge, the PCE of 7.27% is the highest value for ultra low bandgap copolymers with D–A structures. It can be seen from Table 2 that the Voc of these devices with SVA treated active layers is slightly lower than that of the counterpart devices based on active layers without SVA, which is also reported earlier.36 On the other hand, the Jsc and FF have been significantly increased leading to the higher values of PCEs for the devices with SVA treated active layers. The Jsc values improved from 8.84 to 12.62 mA cm−2 and 7.26 to 11.24 mA cm−2 for P1 and P2 devices, respectively. The IPCE spectra were also measured and it was found that the IPCE values are higher for the devices with SVA treated active layers as compared to that without SVA treated counterparts. The enhancement in Jsc and FF for SVA treated devices is also confirmed by measuring the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh). The observed lower value of Rs and higher value of Rsh are essential for high Jsc and FF.23 The lower and higher values of Rs and Rsh, respectively, indicate better ohmic contact at the interfaces of active layer/cathode or anode, which is beneficial for charge transport and extraction.
Mobility is an important defining parameter for the performance of the BHJ organic solar cells. Since PCBM has high enough electron transporting ability, the hole mobilities of copolymers are crucial for organic solar cells. Therefore, we have measured the hole mobilities of the copolymers in the active layers using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method37 applied to hole only devices i.e. ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1 or P2:PC71BM/Au (Fig. 8). The hole mobility values in the active layers\ were estimated via fitting these curves, in which the current in the SCLC region (Jsclc) is expressed as  where εo and εr are the permittivity of free space and relative dielectric constant of the active layer, μ is the hole mobility and L is the thickness of the active layer. Without SVA treatment, the hole mobilities are 3.42 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1 and P2 blended films, respectively. The hole mobility for P1 is slightly higher than that for P2 that supports the higher value of Jsc for the P1 based device. The P1 and P2 blended films with SVA treatment exhibited relatively high mobilities of 2.45 × 10−4 and 1.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher hole mobilities of the SVA treated blends could effectively increase the charge carrier transport, thereby resulting in higher Jsc values and PCE of the PSCs based on SVA treated active layers.

To obtain further information about the effect of SVA on the charge generation and extraction processes, the variation of photocurrent (Jph) with internal voltage of the devices was investigated. The photocurrent (Jph) is the difference between the current under illumination (JL) and dark current (JD), i.e. JPh = JL − JD. The Jph can be expressed as Jph = qLGmaxPc, where L is the thickness of the active layer, Gmax is the maximum generation rate for electron–hole pairs and Pc is the charge collection probability.38–40 In any solar cell, upon illumination the photoactive layer absorbs solar photons and generates excitons, which undergo dissociation at D/A interfaces, forming bound e–h pairs. The bound e–h pairs are separated into free charge carriers and then drifted toward different electrodes under the drive of internal field. The internal effective field is defined as Veff = Vo − Vappl, where Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vappl is the applied voltage. The variation of Jph with internal voltage Veff is shown in Fig. 9. The log–log plot of Jphversus Vint shows two distinct regions: a linear region and a saturation region, where Jph is saturated at Vo − Vappl > 0.52 V for devices based on SVA treated active layers. The field independent saturation region suggests negligible trapped charges and efficient charge extraction and collection. On the other hand, the devices based on the active layers without SVA treatment showed no clear saturation in Jph with increasing Vint, indicating significant electron–hole recombination, where a stronger internal electric field is needed to sweep out the photogenerated charge carriers and separate the germinated electron–hole pairs.41 This is closely related to the film morphology of active layers with SVA, which hinders efficient charge transport. In addition, the photogenerated Jph of SVA treated devices were higher than that of devices without SVA, suggesting higher charge generation and charge extraction. The values of Gmax can be calculated using Jphsat = qGmaxL. The increase in the value of Gmax for SVA treated devices suggests that the treatment of SVA amplifies the exciton generation rate, which is a measure of the number of photons absorbed.42,43 These results are consistent with the absorption profile and morphology of active layers and photovoltaic performance of the devices. To obtain information about the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency, the ratio of Jsc/Jphsat was estimated44 to be 0.69, 0.64, 0.86 and 0.82 for P1:PC71BM (as cast), P2:PC71BM (as cast) P1:PC71BM (SVA) and P2:PC71BM (SVA) active layers. The larger values of this ratio for the devices processed with SVA treatment are attributed to better phase separation in the active layers, increased hole mobility, improved balanced charge transport and enhancement in the light harvesting ability. All these parameters demonstrate that SVA improves the exciton dissociation efficiency, and charge transport and collection efficiency, and also reduces the carrier recombination.

Nanoscale phase separation within the blended active layers is required for high performance PSCs. It provides not only a large interfacial area for exciton dissociation but also a continuous percolating path for electron and hole transport to the corresponding electrodes.45 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is an important tool to get information about the morphology of the active layers. In order to get information about the effect of SVA treatment on the morphology of active layers, we have recorded the TEM images of these active layers which are shown in Fig. 10. The black domain is assigned to PC71BM aggregation because its ordered aggregation gives relatively high electron density compared to polymer aggregation.46 The as cast active layers showed a finer network of bright and dark regions with slight phase separation between the copolymer and the PC71BM phase. The size of bright and dark regions of the blended film with SVA treatment is increased indicating more appropriate nanophase separation, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport. Therefore, the better phase separation induced by SVA leads to increased Jsc and FF leading to an enhancement in the overall PCE of the PSCs.

Conclusions
We designed two ultra low bandgap D–A copolymers with the same thiadiazoloquinoxaline unit as the main electron accepting unit (A) and benzodithiophene (BDT) and dithienosilole (DTS) as different donor units (D) and their optical and electrochemical properties were compared. These copolymers were used as donor materials for solution processed bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. After the optimization of active layers, i.e. the weight ratio and solvent vapor treatment, the PSC based on the P1:PC71BM blend showed a higher PCE (7.27%) as compared to P2:PC71BM (6.68%). The higher PCE is mainly attributed to the improvement in Jsc and FF. Although P2 showed a broader absorption profile than P1, the lower Jsc which is mainly attributed to the low driving force for exciton dissociation arises from the LUMO off set of ∼0.26 eV. The increase in PCE with the SVA treatment of active layers may be attributed to the favorable nanoscale morphology and higher hole mobility.
