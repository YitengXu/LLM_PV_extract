Both In(II) and In(III) chalcogenides are reported, many of which have not yet, to our knowledge, been prepared by a colloidal route.
Introduction
Increasing attention has recently been given to indium chalcogenides due to their interesting electronic properties. These materials have been highlighted as having possible applications in solar cells;1 In2S3 thin film solar cells have been reported with a 16.4% efficiency.2
In2S3 has a reported band gap of 2.00–2.30 eV in the bulk.3 However, there are reports of indium(I and III) sulfide films and particles with much larger band gaps.1–13 The preparation of thin films of the indium chalcogenides has been widely reported, in particular In2S3 which has been prepared by atomic layer deposition,1 spray pyrolysis,4 chemical bath deposition,5 modulated flux deposition,6 MOCVD,7 AACVD,8 SILAR9 and photochemical deposition.10 InS films are less well known and in most cases are amorphous. However, MacInnes et. al. produced both InS by MOCVD and In2S3 using a similar procedure.11 Annealing of these films leads to a complete transition to crystalline In2S3.8,12 By comparison there are relatively few reports in the literature of colloidal routes to indium chalcogenide nanomaterials. Nanoparticles of In2S3 have been synthesised by a variety of methods including, arrested precipitation yielding particles of between 2–3 nm,13 solvothermal reduction resulting in a range of sizes and morphologies14 and sonochemical synthesis yielding particles of 20–40 nm.3 There is one report of InS nanoparticles in the literature.15 The material was prepared by a single source route and was spherical.
Indium selenide semiconductors have reported band gaps that range from 1.73–2.09 eV.16 Indium selenide thin films (In2Se, InSe and In2Se3) are also well known.17 The only report of a colloidal route to indium selenide nanoparticles details the photoelectrochemical reduction of an elemental selenium electrode in a solution of InNO3 giving In2Se3.18
Indium telluride semiconductors have a reported conduction activation energy of 0.516 eV in the bulk ranging to 0.521 eV for thin films.19 Thin films of InTe and In2Te3 have been prepared by several techniques including flash evaporation20 and quenching of molten In2Te3.17 However, to the best of our knowledge there are no reports of colloidal routes to indium tellurides.
In this article we report the preparation of nanodispersed forms of all of the indium chalcogenides of the forms InE and In2E3 (E = S, Se, Te) by a colloidal method. This method has previously proven useful for the preparation of bismuth and antimony chalcogenides.21
Experimental
Indium acetate (99.99%), hexadecylamine (90%), dodecylamine (98%), sulfur (99.5%), selenium (99.5%), tellurium (99.8%), methanol (99.9%), chloroform and acetone were obtained from (Aldrich) and used as received. Powder XRD data were collected using a Bruker D8 AXE diffractometer (CuKα). TEM samples were prepared by evaporating a drop of the material suspended in diethyl ether onto a carbon-coated grid. TEM images were collected on a Philips CM200 microscope using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
1. Preparation of InE (E = S, Se, Te)
Hexadecylamine (50 g) was degassed under reduced pressure at 140 °C and then heated to 300 °C under nitrogen. Indium acetate (1.00 g, 3.4 mmol) and the corresponding chalcogen (3.4 mmol) were individually dispersed in dodecylamine (2 × 5 ml). Both dispersions were then simultaneously added to the hexadecylamine. The reaction temperature dropped to approximately 280 °C. The reaction was heated again to 300 °C and the temperature maintained for 18 h. After cooling the reaction mixture methanol (100 ml) was added and the solid isolated by centrifugation. The solid was washed with approximately 10 ml chloroform and reprecipitated with acetone (100 ml).
2. Preparation of In2E3 (E = S,Se,Te)
Hexadecylamine (50 g) was degassed under reduced pressure at 140 °C and then heated to 300 °C under nitrogen. Indium acetate (1.00 g, 3.4 mmol) and the corresponding chalcogen (20 mmol) were individually dispersed in dodecylamine (2 × 5 ml). Both dispersions were then simultaneously added to the hexadecylamine. The reaction temperature dropped to approximately 280 °C. The reaction was heated again to 300 °C and the temperature maintained for 18 h. After cooling the reaction mixture methanol (100 ml) was added and the solid isolated by centrifugation. The solid was washed with approximately 10 ml chloroform and reprecipitated with acetone (100 ml).
In both cases the yields appeared to be quantitative, however due to the binding of the capping agent to the surface of the nanomaterials it was not possible to obtain exact yields. None of the materials formed stable suspensions.
Results
The results for the work are summarised in Table 1. It should be noted that there is a discrepancy in many cases between the dimensions of the materials obtained from TEM and the values obtained by application of the Sherrer equation. This may be due to errors arising from the presence of small amounts of larger material (discussed below), lack of clarity regarding the orientation of the crystal planes (especially in the hexagonal plates) and the large errors in applying the Sherrer equation to materials with dimensions greater than 100 nm.

InS
Indium(II) sulfide was prepared by reaction 1 and was isolated as a dark brown solid. The material was found to be orthorhombic InS by p-XRD (Fig. 1, JCPDS 19-0588). It can be seen from the XRD that there is also some contamination with indium metal. Attempts to reduce the amounts of indium contamination by increasing the concentration of sulfur resulted in the formation of mixtures of InS and In2S3.

The TEM image (Fig. 2) showed that the InS had a wire like morphology with an average length of 590 nm (±150 nm) and an average width of 28 nm (±15 nm) with an aspect ratio of 1 ∶ 21. The {1 0 1} lattice spacing InS (0.373 nm) is clearly visible in the TEM image (Fig. 2).

InSe
Indium(II) selenide was prepared by reaction 1 and isolated as an orange solid. The material was found to be pure hexagonal InSe by p-XRD (Fig. 3, JCPDS 12-0118).

The TEM image (Fig. 4) showed that the material has a hexagonal-wafer like morphology with a broad distribution of sizes with an average of 270 nm ± 66 nm. Whilst there also appeared to be rod like structures present, closer examination revealed that these were in fact the result of folded wafers. The wafers appear to be roughly hexagonal. The poor definition may be due to damage sustained during washing and preparation of the sample for TEM. It is interesting to note that the hexagonal phase gives rise to a hexagonal wafer. In studies with bismuth and antimony chalcogenides hexagonal wafers have usually been associated with a rhombohedral phase.19

InTe
Indium(I, III) telluride was prepared by reaction 1 and isolated as a brown solid. The material was found to be tetragonal InTe from p-XRD (Fig. 5, JCPDS 30-0636). Previous work has shown that unlike InS and InSe the indium is not present as In(II) as the structure does not contain any In–In bonds and is in fact more correctly represented as a mixed valence phase of the form InI[InIIIX2].22
 Fig. 5  Powder XRD corresponding to tetragonal InTe, by reaction of In(ac)3 and S, 1 ∶ 6, in HDA at 300 °C for 18 h. 
The TEM image showed that the material is particulate (Fig. 7). The frequency plot of the particle size (Fig. 6) shows a bimodal distribution with the majority of particles being 10 nm ± 3 nm. However, a small number of particles are observed that are much larger and skew the overall average size to 11 nm ± 3.4. The lattice spacing of 0.421 nm corresponds to the {2 0 0} plane (0.422 nm) of InTe. When analysed using the Sherrer equation the XRD pattern suggests that the particles should be 55 nm which does not agree with the vast majority observed by TEM. This is probably due to the small number of large particles present which cause the XRD peaks to appear sharper than expected.

In2S3
Whilst it was found that the preparation of InX materials was relatively simple, requiring only a stoichiometric ratio of reagents, the formation of the In(III) materials did not follow the same pattern. Reacting indium acetate and the chalcogens at a 2 ∶ 3 ratio resulted in a mixture of InX and In2X3 (reaction 2). It was found that a chalcogen excess of 6 ∶ 1 was required to ensure that the product contained indium in the plus three oxidation state.
Indium sulfide was isolated as an orange solid. The material was found to be tetragonal In2S3 by p-XRD (Fig. 8, JCPDS 25-0390).

The TEM (Fig. 9) image showed that the material has a wafer like morphology with diameters of 50–100 nm. In some cases the wafers appear to be hexagonal. The lattice spacing is also clearly visible and was found to be 0.62 nm which corresponds to the {1 0 3} plane of In2S3 (0.621 nm). It is difficult to explain how a hexagonal morphology could be simply related to a tetragonal unit cell, but we suggest that this is possibly the result of a complex twinning process.

In2Se3
Indium(III) selenide was prepared by reaction 2 and was isolated as a grey/black solid. The material was found to be hexagonal In2Se3 by p-XRD (Fig. 10, JCPDS 40-1407).
 Fig. 10  Powder XRD corresponding to hexagonal In2Se3, by reaction of In(ac)3 and Se, 1 ∶ 6, in HDA at 300 °C for 18 h. 
The TEM image showed that the material has a hexagonal “wafer-like” morphology (Fig. 11) with average diameters of 141 nm (±24 nm). It is interesting to note that both InSe and In2Se3 are formed in the same crystal phase and also have the same nanocrystal morphology. Whilst it is possible that InSe crystals act as a precursor to the formation of In2Se3 it seems unlikely given that the latter are almost half the diameter of the former. The lattice spacing is clearly visible on the TEM images (Fig. 11) and was found to be 0.590 nm which corresponds to the {1 0 1} plane of InS (0.589 nm).

Previous In2Se3 particle synthesis by Rabchynski et al. yielded amorphous non-uniformly dispersed particles with sizes ranging from 40–80 nm.18
In2Te3
Indium(III) telluride was prepared by reaction 2 and was isolated as a black solid. The material was found to be In2Te3 in the cubic phase from the p-XRD (Fig. 12, JCPDS 33-1488).
 Fig. 12  Powder XRD of In2Te3, by reaction of In(ac)3 and Te, 1 ∶ 6, in HDA at 300 °C for 18 h. 
The TEM image (Fig. 13) showed that the material has rod-like morphology with an average length of 72 nm (±14 nm) and an average width of 9 nm (±2 nm). This gives an aspect ratio of 1 ∶ 8.1. A few larger rods were also observed in the TEM and these may be the reason the XRD peaks are sharper than expected for the size of the rods quoted. The lattice spacing is also clearly visible and was found to be 0.329 nm which corresponds to the 0.327 nm {4 4 0} plane of In2Te3 (JCPDS 33-1488).
 Fig. 13  Powder XRD of tetragonal In (* peaks correspond to cubic In2O3 JCPDS 06-0416), by decomposition of In(ac)3 in HDA at 300 °C for 18 h. 
Considering that In2Te3 is in the cubic phase it was not expected that its synthesis would result in an anisotropic morphology. However, it is possible that InTe nanocrystals are formed as a precursor. InTe has been shown to exist in the anisotropic tetragonal phase. It is therefore possible that the growth from such a precursor would result in a final anisotropic morphology even though the material is in an isotropic phase.
Discussion
It is particularly interesting that this method can lead to materials containing In(I), In(II) and In(III) oxidation states. Understanding the chemical processes involved in the redox chemistry of the indium centre is key to understanding how the reaction may be better controlled. Given that reactions where the ratio of indium to chalcogen is 2 ∶ 3 result in a mixture of In(II) and In(III) species it would appear that the reaction initially results in a reactive indium species with a lower oxidation state than that initially added to the reaction. However, given that, with respect to indium, the chalcogens are oxidants, it would seem unlikely that the reduction process is a result of an indium acetate–chalcogen reaction. It therefore appears that the reduction step is a result of the reaction of indium acetate with the amine. It was found that heating the indium acetate in the amine under the same conditions gave a dark solid. Powder XRD (Fig. 13) showed that this material was comprised of a mixture of tetragonal indium metal (JCPDS 01-1042) and cubic In2O3 (JCPDS 06-0416).
It is proposed that even in the presence of the chalcogen the reaction proceeds initially via the formation of indium nanoparticles and it is the subsequent reaction of these with the chalcogen to form InX and then, via oxidation, In2X3. However, as there seems to be little correlation between the sizes of the InX species and the In2X3 species it seems likely that the conversion of InX to In2X3 is a result of a concurrent reaction rather than a sequential one. The reaction is probably facilitated by the fact that indium metal has a low melting point (150 °C) and therefore is likely to remain as liquid metallic droplets in the reaction media. The liquid will allow rapid transfer of reagents and therefore allow the complete consumption of the droplets during the reaction as opposed to the formation of a chalcogen layer as might be expected if the metal remained in the solid form. Rods and whiskers have been grown by such a mechanism by Trentler et al., where indium flux droplets have facilitated the growth of InP whiskers.23 This solid–liquid–solid growth (SLS) explains the growth of whiskers and rods from the metal centre. However, it does not completely explain the growth of the materials with other morphologies and there may be a possibility that this SLS mechanism is not limited to the growth of rods and whiskers.
If no chalcogen is present the In metal is oxidised by residual oxygen yielding In2O3. The lattice spacing observed by TEM (Fig. 15) shows that the smaller particles are in fact In2O3.

The lattice spacing is clearly visible, 0.296 nm which corresponds to the {2 2 2} plane of In2O3 (JCPDS 06-0416). The frequency plot (Fig. 16) shows a broad monomodal distribution with particles with an average diameter of 5.7 nm (±1.5).

Conclusions
We have developed a simple and general colloidal method for the preparation of indium chalcogenides. The method can also be used to prepare In2O3 nanoparticles. The materials have a nanoscale morphology which relates to the crystal phase of the material.
