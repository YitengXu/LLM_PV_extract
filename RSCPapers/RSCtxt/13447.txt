    , Accepted 29th June 2018First published on 29th June 2018AbstractUsing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigated the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and the competing H2 evolution reaction on ligand-protected Au25 nanoclusters (NCs) of different charge states, Au25(SR)18q (q = −1, 0, +1). Our results showed that regardless of charge state, CO2 electroreduction over Au25(SR)18q NCs was not feasible because of the extreme endothermicity to stabilize the carboxyl (COOH) intermediate. When we accounted for the removal of a ligand (both –SR and –R) from Au25(SR)18q under electrochemical conditions, surprisingly we found that this is a thermodynamically feasible process at the experimentally applied potentials with the generated surface sites becoming active centers for electrocatalysis. In every case, the negatively charged NCs, losing a ligand from their surface during electrochemical conditions, were found to significantly stabilize the COOH intermediate, resulting in dramatically enhanced CO2 reduction. The generated sites for CO2 reduction were also found to be active for H2 evolution, which agrees with experimental observations that these two processes compete. Interestingly, we found that the removal of an –R ligand from the negatively charged NC, resulted in a catalyst that was both active and selective for CO2 reduction. This work highlights the importance of both the overall charge state and generation of catalytically active surface sites on ligand-protected NCs, while elucidating the CO2 electroreduction mechanisms. Overall, our work rationalizes a series of experimental observations and demonstrates pathways to convert a very stable and catalytically inactive NC to an active electrocatalyst.
Introduction
Growing fossil fuel consumption to meet energy demands has led to rising CO2 emissions, which could have detrimental effects on the environment if left unmitigated.1 There is an emerging interest in electrocatalysis as a route to reduce CO2 emissions by sustainably converting CO2 to useful chemicals and fuels.2–6 Electrochemical conditions are advantageous for this reaction because applied potentials can be used to drive the reduction at ambient pressures and temperatures, and the electricity required to reduce CO2 can be acquired from renewable resources such as wind and solar power.7–11 Presently, the challenge with reducing CO2 electrocatalytically is that it is not industrially feasible due to the highly reducing potentials required to obtain desired products such as hydrocarbons and CO.7,12,13 Additionally, at these extreme potentials, there is low selectivity for desired products due to the competing H2 evolution reaction.8,14 Therefore, there is continued interest in the design of active catalysts that promote CO2 reduction at modest potentials while minimizing hydrogen evolution.
Experimental work by Hori et al. demonstrated that bulk Au electrodes can successfully reduce CO2 to CO.13,15 Additional studies have shown that nanosized Au electrodes are more active than bulk Au electrodes.16–18 The enhanced activity of Au nanoparticles (NPs) has been attributed to catalyst properties such as high surface area and increased presence of low-coordinated sites that strongly bind reaction intermediates.17,19–21 Mistry et al. investigated CO2 reduction on Au NPs 1.1 nm to 7.7 nm in size. The authors identified that NPs below 5 nm were significantly more active than bulk Au whereas, NPs larger than 5 nm were comparably active to bulk Au. The activity of the Au NPs less than 5 nm in size was attributed to the presence of low-coordinated sites such as corners and edges. Interestingly, the catalytically more active and smaller NPs (<5 nm) were more selective towards H2.16 Hall et al. showed that porous Au film thickness (ranging from 0.5 to 2.7 μm) can also influence CO2 reduction selectivity.22 The authors observed a suppression in hydrogen evolution with increase in film thickness, leading to increased selectivity towards CO. Thus, in addition to the presence of low-coordinated sites, mass transport effects could also play a role in resulting activity and selectivity of Au NPs for the CO2 reduction reaction.
In contrast to polydisperse Au NPs, atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs), stabilized by organic ligands, exhibit well-defined structure which make them attractive for catalytic applications.23,24 However, the presence of ligands can also limit the accessibility of reactants to Au sites resulting in reduced catalyst activity.25–27 Despite this, Kauffman et al., has observed enhanced catalytic activity of ligand-protected NCs compared to unprotected NPs at reducing potentials as small as −0.193 V.18 Specifically, the authors compared the activity of a fully ligand-protected Au25(SC2H4Ph)18− NC, about 1 nm in size, to unprotected (metallic) 2 nm and 5 nm Au NPs, and bulk Au. Despite the small size of the Au25(SC2H4Ph)18− NC, contrary to Mistry et al.,16 the NC was more selective towards CO than the NPs and bulk Au. In addition, the Au25(SC2H4Ph)18− NC produced peak CO production at −1.0 V vs. RHE, at a rate 7–700 times higher than on the NPs and bulk Au. This suggests that the ligands designed to stabilize these Au NCs have an effect in the selective reduction of CO2 to CO. Despite the negative potentials applied, a retention of the optical spectra before and after CO2 reduction suggests that the Au25(SC2H4Ph)18− NC did not change size, and that the S–Au–S–Au–S bonding motif in the cluster shell was majorly retained. The potential scalability and long-term performance of electroreduction of CO2 over the Au25(SC2H4Ph)18− NC has also been investigated.28 Under realistic on-demand catalyst usage, CO selectivities and Faradaic efficiencies greater than 90%, were achieved through both potentiostat-controlled and renewable solar powered electrolysis. Thus, these ligand-protected Au NCs appear to be attractive electrocatalysts for feasible conversion of CO2.
Theoretical methods combined with experiments can be used to provide atomic level insight into the catalyst properties that influence CO2 reduction activity over Au25 NCs. For instance, Kauffman et al. assessed CO2 reduction on fully ligand-protected Au25(SR)18q NCs in three different charge states (q = −1, 0, +1) using DFT calculations and experiments, wherein thiolate ligands were simulated with methylthiols in calculations.29 The negatively charged NC was able to produce more CO from CO2 reduction than the neutral and positive NCs between −0.7 V and −1.3 V vs. RHE. The activity of Au25(SCH3)18− for CO2 reduction was computationally attributed to the stabilization of co-adsorbed CO2 and H+ reactants more favorably than on Au25(SCH3)18q (q = 0, +1). Such a stabilization is expected due to the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged NC and the proton. The presence of ligand-removed NCs, due to the very negative potentials applied, was not considered in this work, nor the detailed reaction path. In a latter study, Alfonso et al. used DFT to investigate CO2 reduction to CO on fully ligand-protected Au25(SCH3)18− and partially ligand-removed Au25(SCH3)17−.30 The authors identified that the COOH species, an important intermediate in CO2 reduction, was more stabilized on Au25(SCH3)17− (ΔG[*COOH]: 0.34 eV) than on Au25(SCH3)18− (ΔG[*COOH]: 2.04 eV). The stabilization of the COOH intermediate, was attributed to its interaction with exposed Au atoms from the thiol ligand-removed site.30 The investigation of ligand-removed Au25(SCH3)17− was supported using work by Wu et al. in which the authors observed an enhancement in CO conversion over the Au25(SC2H4Ph)18 NC when thiol-based ligands were removed from the NC.27 In our very recent study on the CO2 electroreduction on sphere and rod-like ligand-protected Au NCs, we computationally showed that ligand removal can occur under electrochemical conditions and the generated sites exhibited CO2 electroreduction trends that were observed in experiments.31
Results to date illustrate that there is no consensus on the identity of active sites on ligand-protected Au nanocatalysts. Some studies have proposed that under reaction conditions these catalysts remain fully ligand-protected18,29,32–34 while others have stated that some ligand removal is necessary for activity to be observed.25,27,31,35–39 Additionally, there are competing claims on whether Au nanocatalysts are more selective towards CO (ref. 18, 28 and 40) or H2 (ref. 16 and 41) under CO2 reduction conditions. This lack of agreement on the selectivity of Au nanocatalysts, in addition to the elusive active sites under electrocatalytic conditions, make it very difficult to identify chemical strategies for the design and synthesis of thiolated Au NCs that efficiently reduce CO2. Theoretical studies can give valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and reveal active catalytic sites, but there are presently very few studies that have investigated the CO2 reduction behavior on these ligand-protected NCs.18,29–31
Herein, we report a systematic analysis of how the NC charge state and ligand-removal concertedly influence the reaction energetics of the CO2 reduction and H2 evolution reactions, by using DFT calculations. This work elucidates the active sites on the NC catalyst surface for CO2 reduction and provides insight into the mechanisms of their generation that would lead to the design of more efficient CO2 electroreduction catalysts.
Computational methods
DFT calculations in this study were carried out using the PBE42 functional and the double-ζ plus polarization (DZVP) basis set43 with a 500 Ry cutoff in combination with the Goedecker, Teter, and Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials,44 as implemented in the computational package CP2K.45 This combination of DFT parameters (functional, pseudopotentials, and basis set) has been successfully used to investigate reaction energetics on Au-based catalysts.46–50 The initial geometries of the NCs were generated from experimentally-derived crystallographic data of the Au25(SC2H4Ph)18− NC.51 The ligands of the Au25 NC were represented by methylthiolate groups (–SCH3) generating the Au25(SCH3)18 NC. Simplification of the ligands, from –SC2H4Ph to –SCH3, is a typical approach used to reduce computational cost while maintaining the structural integrity of the NCs.18,29,30,35,52 As shown in Fig. 1, the Au25(SCH3)18q NC is composed of a Au13 icosahedral core protected by a shell network of six Au2(SCH3)3 units. The geometries of the NCs were optimized in a 30 × 30 × 30 Å3 non-periodic cell until the forces were less than 0.02 eV Å−1. All systems with an even number of electrons had a singlet multiplicity and all systems with an odd number of electrons in this study had a doublet multiplicity (see ESI† Table S1 for more details). The energetics for ligand removal, CO2 reduction, and H2 evolution were calculated using thermodynamic methods where the zero-point energy (ZPE), heat capacity (CP), and entropic (TS) terms were added to the electronic energy (E) as follows:. Additionally, the computational hydrogen electrode model (CHE)12,53 was applied to represent the free energy of a proton (H+) and electron (e−) pair in reduction reactions and thereby, calibrate the calculated free energy on an electrochemical scale. Thus, the total free energy for a proton–electron pair with an applied potential (U) is defined as G(H+ + e−) = G(1/2H2) − neU where n is the number of electrons transferred and e is the electronic charge. Gas phase corrections as calculated by Peterson et al., were also applied to the electronic energies of the gaseous molecules.12 For the free energies of the adsorbates the vibrational components of the heat capacity and entropic terms were considered. The vibrational modes of the adsorbates were determined by keeping the optimized NC fixed and computing the frequencies of the adsorbate within the harmonic oscillator approximation. This approach has been successfully applied using DFT in electrocatalysis,19,30,54,55 including Au25(SCH3)18. The computationally predicted limiting potential (UL)12,56 was calculated as the applied potential required for the rate determining step, to become thermoneutral (ΔG = 0).
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the fully-ligand protected Au25(SCH3)18 NC. The system is composed of a Au13 icosahedral core protected by a shell network of six Au2(SR)3 units. The Au, S, C, and H atoms are colored yellow, blue, grey, and white, respectively. The labels “A” and “B” on the Au2(SCH3)3 shell network represent the two distinct types of coordinated sulfur in the NC shell. 
The Au25q NC which has been stably synthesized in multiple charge states (q = −1, 0, +1)57–59 has also been used for catalysis in each of the charge states.29 In the ESI† (Table S2) we assess the relative stability of the Au25 NC in relation to the charge states using adiabatic electron affinity (AEA, Au25(SCH3)x0 + e− → Au25(SCH3)x−) and adiabatic ionization potential (AIP, Au25(SCH3)x0 → Au25(SCH3)x+ + e−).60,61 Studies have also suggested that under reaction conditions, the Au25 NC can partially lose ligands.27,30 Therefore we calculate the energy required to remove ligands from the Au25(SCH3)18 NC. We initially focus on the removal of –SR (–SCH3) from the 6[Au2(SCH3)3] shell of the fully ligand-protected NC in each different charge state. The removal of a –SR ligand would expose an Au atom and enable interaction with adsorbates. However, theoretical studies on CO2 reduction on Ni–Fe–S cubanes54 and MoS2 (ref. 62) catalysts have shown that the COOH intermediate can be stabilized more favorably on the S atoms of the catalysts compared to other available sites. Thus, we also considered removal of –R (–CH3) from the Au25 NCs to expose an S atom to the reaction intermediates for CO2 reduction to CO.
The ΔG for ligand removal of –SR from Au25(SCH3)18 was calculated as an electrochemical reduction step, using eqn (1), which was derived according to the following reduction reaction: Au25(SCH3)18q + H+ + e− → HSCH3 + Au25(SCH3)17q. ΔGmethyhiol-removal = G[Au25(SCH3)17]q + G[HSCH3] − G[Au25(SCH3)18]q − 1/2G[H2] + neU(1)where G[Au25(SCH3)17], G[HSCH3], G[Au25(SCH3)18], and G[H2] are the gas phase free energies of the isolated NC with a removed thiol, the HSCH3 molecule, the fully ligand-protected NC, and the H2 molecule, respectively. The ΔG for removal of –R was calculated in the same manner as for –SR with G[Au25(SCH3)17]q and G[HSCH3] in eqn (1) being replaced by G[Au25S(SCH3)17]q and G[CH4], respectively. All vibrational modes were considered in the analysis of free energies of ligand removal. An overview of the potential states of the Au25q NC under reaction conditions that we consider in this study are shown in Fig. 2 (shown for –SCH3 removal).

The top and bottom rows, show electron transfer to form the fully ligand-protected and partially ligand removed NCs in each charge state, respectively. The vertical steps indicate ligand removal from Au25(SR)18q to form Au25(SR)17q. 
Prior studies have suggested12,17,30 that CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution can take place through the following steps:  CO2 + H+ + e− + * → *COOH(2) *COOH + H+ + e− → *CO + H2O(l)(3) *CO → CO(g) + *(4) H+ + e− + * → *H(5) *H + H+ + e− → H2(g) + *(6)
An example for determining reaction energetics using the first step of CO2 reduction on the NCs (2), is calculated as follows: ΔG*COOH = G[COOH*] − G[NC] − G[CO2] − 1/2G[H2] + neU(7)where G[COOH*], G[NC], G[CO2], G[H2] are the gas phase free energies of the COOH adsorbed on a NC, the NC, the CO2 molecule, and the H2 molecule, respectively. In the ESI† (Fig. S1) we also assessed CO2 adsorption on the NCs and observed only physisorbed CO2 as previously reported.18
Results
DFT geometry optimizations illustrated that the final structures of the fully ligand-protected Au25(SR)18q (q = −1, 0, +1) NCs are nearly structurally identical to the experimental crystal structure.29,57,59,63 The calculated free energy diagrams for CO2 reduction and H2 evolution on the fully ligand-protected Au25(SCH3)q NCs (q = −1, 0, +1), at U = 0 V (solid lines) are shown in Fig. 3. The ΔG values of the reactions were also evaluated at an applied potential of −1.0 V vs. RHE (U = −1.0 V, dashed lines in Fig. 3), the potential at which peak production of CO was observed in experimental studies on the NCs.18,28 As shown in Fig. 3a, CO2 reduction to CO on the fully ligand-protected NCs Au25(SCH3)18 in each charge state, appears to be unfavorable due to the largely endergonic step for COOH stabilization (ΔG > 1.82 eV). The observed unfavorable ΔG(*COOH), agrees with previous computational observations by Alfonso et al., for CO2 reduction on the Au25(SCH3)18− NC.30 Although for the hydrogen evolution reaction at U = 0 V, the H adsorption step is also endergonic (Fig. 3b), the ΔG for the H adsorption (eqn (5)) is more favorable than the COOH adsorption (eqn (2)). Furthermore, at U = −1.0 V, the hydrogen evolution reaction becomes exergonic on the Au25(SCH3)18q (q = 0, +1) NCs. Overall, the large positive ΔG values for CO2 reduction on the fully ligand-protected NCs suggest that the production of CO is not feasible on these NCs. Thus, we focused on partially ligand-removed NCs, which have been experimentally shown to be active catalysts.27,35–39

Fig. 4a illustrates partial ligand removal from the Au25(SCH3)18 NC via a reduction reaction. We focus on removing one –SCH3 ligand, connected to a core Au atom of the NC (labeled in Fig. 1 as site “A” and also shown in Fig. 4a), as has been done in previous studies.30 It should be noted that removing –SCH3 from site “A” in Fig. 1 is more energetically favorable than from site “B” (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). In the resulting partially ligand-removed Au25(SCH3)17 NC, the Au atom of the shell, which was previously bound to the removed –SCH3 ligand, is now connected to an Au atom of the core. According to our geometry optimization calculations, aside from the site where the –SCH3 ligand was removed, the Au25(SCH3)17q NCs remain geometrically similar to the Au25(SCH3)18q NC. To assess the ability of the Au25(SCH3)18q NCs to release a –SCH3 ligand, we calculated the ΔG for the electrochemical step of Au25(SCH3)17q formation from Au25(SCH3)18q as shown in Fig. 4b. The observed trend in ΔG for removing a ligand from Au25(SCH3)18q at U = 0 V and −1.0 V is as follows (from most favorable to least favorable): Au25(SCH3)180 < Au25(SCH3)18+ < Au25(SCH3)18−. This trend follows the order of increasing stability of the fully ligand-protected NCs as depicted on the increasing HOMO−LUMO gaps, calculated by Akola et al.64 At U = 0 V the formation of the partially ligand-removed Au25(SCH3)17q NCs is less endergonic than the COOH adsorption on the fully ligand-protected Au25(SCH3)18q NCs. Interestingly, at U = −1.0 V, the ΔG for Au25(SCH3)17 formation becomes exergonic in each charge state, as shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 4b. Thus, under reaction conditions (−1.0 V vs. RHE) calculations clearly predict the formation of partially ligand-removed catalysts.
 Fig. 4  (a) Schematic for the reduction of the fully ligand-protected NCs (Au25(SCH3)18q) to partially ligand-removed Au25(SCH3)17q. The color code is as shown in Fig. 3. (b) Free energy diagram for removing one –SCH3 from the NC. As described in Fig. 3, the colored, solid, and dashed lines represent the different charge states and energetics at U = 0 V and at U = −1.0 V, respectively. 
Following the observation of exergonic ΔG for Au25(SCH3)17q formation at U = −1.0 V, we assessed CO2 reduction and H2 evolution on the Au25(SCH3)17q NCs (q = −1, 0, +1). As shown in Fig. 5a, we found that the partially ligand-removed NCs better stabilized the COOH intermediate (ΔG < 1.42 eV) relative to the fully ligand-protected NCs (ΔG > 1.82 eV). Thus, in each charge state the presence of ligand-removed sites on the NCs enhances COOH surface stabilization compared to the fully ligand-protected NCs. The lower ΔG(*COOH) observed on the Au25(SCH3)17q NCs suggests that ligand removal is important for the Au NCs to become active, as highly endergonic free energies were observed on the fully ligand-protected NCs even with an applied potential (U = −1.0 V). The Au25(SCH3)17− NC had the least endergonic ΔG(*COOH) compared to Au25(SCH3)17q (q = 0, +1) at U = 0 V, which is conceptually consistent with the Lewis acidity of CO2. Thus, we would expect the partially ligand-removed NCs to be most active in a negative charge state. Given the exergonic ΔG(*H) shown in Fig. 5b, we would also expect competition with H2 evolution on partially ligand-removed NCs. It should be noted that adsorbate interactions can be influenced by solvation.56 Thus, in the ESI† (Fig. S3) we assessed the H2O solvent effect on CO2 reduction and H2 evolution energetics on the Au25(SCH3)17− NC. The results showed an enhancement in stabilizing the COOH intermediate in the presence of H2O. Additionally, the trends observed without solvation (i.e. competition with H2 evolution), remained in the solvated case studied.

(c) Illustrations of CO2 reduction and H2 evolution reaction steps. The color code for the diagrams is as described in Fig. 3. 
Having shown that the ligand removal on the NCs can generate active sites for CO2 electroreduction and knowing that catalysts with surface sulfur atoms, such as Ni–Fe–S cubanes54 and MoS2,62 stabilize the COOH intermediate in CO2 reduction, we investigated the removal of –CH3 from the Au25(SCH3)18 NC to generate a surface sulfur site instead of a bare Au site (Fig. 6a). Similarly, to –SCH3 removal, we focus on removing –CH3 from site “A” as indicated in Fig. 1, in each charge state of the Au25 NC. The observed trend for removing a –CH3 from Au25(SCH3)18q at U = 0 V and −1.0 V is the same as removing –SCH3 from Au25(SCH3)18q: Au25(SCH3)180 < Au25(SCH3)18+ < Au25(SCH3)18− (from most favorable to least favorable). Remarkably, unlike the endergonic ΔG observed for –SCH3 removal at U = 0 V, the ΔG for –CH3 removal is exergonic in each charge state. Thus, under reaction conditions (−1.0 V vs. RHE) calculations predict that bare Au sites (due to –SCH3 removal) and S sites (due to –CH3 removal) may coexist. However, we note that we have not assessed here the free energies for ligand removal associated with an experimentally utilized ligand (i.e. –SC2H4Ph) due to computational constraints. However, in the ESI† (Fig. S4) we present an energy analysis comparing –SC2H4Ph removal to –C2H4Ph removal in the negatively charged state of the Au25 NC. These results indicate that under reaction conditions the formation of the partially-ligand removed NCs is still plausible.
 Fig. 6  (a) Schematic for the reduction of the fully ligand-protected NC (Au25(SCH3)18q) to one with –CH3 removed, Au25S(SCH3)17q. The color code is as shown in Fig. 3. (b) Free energy diagram for removing one –CH3 from the NC. As described in Fig. 3, the colored, solid, and dashed lines, represent the charge states, the energetics at U = 0 V and at U = −1.0 V, respectively. 
Due to the preferable ΔG(*COOH) on Au25(SCH3)17− relative to Au25(SCH3)17q (q = 0, +1), we examine CO2 reduction and H2 evolution on the Au25S(SCH3)17− NC (–CH3 removed) and compare the energetics to the Au25(SCH3)17− NC (–SCH3 removed). As shown in Fig. 7a, we found that Au25S(SCH3)17− stabilizes COOH more favorably (ΔG(*COOH) = 0.33 eV) relative to Au25(SCH3)17− (ΔG(*COOH) = 0.81 eV). This enhanced COOH adsorption could be attributed to the larger negative charge on the exposed S site of the Au25S(SCH3)17− compared to the exposed Au site of the Au25(SCH3)17− NC (see ESI† Fig. S5). In addition, the exposed S site of the Au25S(SCH3)17− NC contributes to increased electron density near the Fermi level of the Au25S(SCH3)17− NC compared to the fully protected Au25(SCH3)18−, which in turn contributes to the reactivity of the NC (see ESI† Fig. S6). In Fig. 7b, we also observe that H adsorption at U = 0 V is more exergonic on Au25S(SCH3)17− than on Au25(SCH3)17−. This indicates that H2 evolution would compete with CO2 reduction on Au25S(SCH3)17− NCs.

The orange and black lines represent the energy diagrams for the Au25S(SCH3)17− and Au25(SCH3)17− NCs, respectively. The solid lines illustrate the energy diagrams at U = 0 V, while the dashed lines represent the energy diagrams at an applied potential of U = −1.0 V. The color code for (c) the illustrations of CO2 reduction and H2 evolution are as described in Fig. 3. 
Determining the selectivity between CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution would typically require an in depth kinetic analysis. However, to give a qualitative estimate of the selectivity we determine the difference between the limiting potentials for CO2 reduction and H2 evolution (UL(CO2) − UL(H2)).62,65,66 The more positive UL(CO2) − UL(H2) corresponds to a higher selectivity towards CO2 reduction relative to the set of NCs. As shown in Table 1, on the Au25(SCH3)18q and Au25(SCH3)17q NCs, the limiting step which determines UL(CO2) is the COOH formation step. However, on the Au25S(SCH3)17− NC, the limiting step is CO (and H2O) formation, which results in the smallest |UL(CO2)| amongst all of the nanoclusters in this study. H adsorption is the limiting step that determines UL(H2) on the Au25(SCH3)18q and the Au25(SCH3)170 NCs, while the formation of H2(g) is the limiting step responsible for UL(H2) on the Au25(SCH3)17q (q = +1, −1) and Au25S(SCH3)17− NCs due to the exothermic H adsorption on the NCs. In Fig. 8, the calculated UL(CO2) − UL(H2) shows that the negatively charged species, Au25(SCH3)18−, Au25(SCH3)17−, and Au25S(SCH3)17− are the least selective towards H2 production relative to the set of NCs. Although our results show that only the partially-ligand removed clusters, Au25(SCH3)17− and Au25S(SCH3)17−, are most active for CO2 reduction, it is only the Au25S(SCH3)17− NC which is selective to CO2 reduction over H2 evolution (positive value of UL(CO2) − UL(H2)). Therefore, the exposure of S atoms, within the NCs are important to tune selectivity towards CO2 reduction. In experiments, the conditions that control the selectivity of the Au25 catalyst towards CO include applied potentials, CO2 flow rate, catalyst loading, and concentration of the electrolyte.28,67 These Au25 catalysts are also clearly active toward H2 evolution. Zhao et al., showed that an Au25/MoS2 system enhanced the hydrogen evolution reaction activity compared to MoS2 alone.68 This enhanced activity was attributed to the electronic interactions at the Au–MoS2 interface. Therefore, these Au NCs can display exceptional but different catalytic behavior depending on the chemical environment. The observed differences in catalytic behavior with changes to NC structure (fully-protected vs. partially-ligand removed) shown in this study can be connected to the frontier orbitals HOMO-LUMO of the clusters (see ESI† Fig. S7). As shown in Fig. S7(a),† the HOMO−LUMO gap of the NCs with a removed ligand becomes much smaller compared to the fully protected NC. In addition, the electron density observed on the ligand removed sites of Au25(SCH3)17− and Au25S(SCH3)17− becomes more localized and directional compared to Au25(SCH3)18− (see Fig. S7(b)†) which is important because changes in orbital localization and directionality has been shown to contribute to the reactivity of Au clusters.69,70

As a final note, although our results rationalize a series of experimental observations, they are solely based on thermodynamic viewpoints and do not take into consideration kinetic limitations in the form of activation barriers. Barriers for proton–electron transfer in CO2 reduction to CH4 and CH3OH have been calculated on Pt, Cu, and Au surfaces.71,72 The calculated barriers for the steps relevant to this study (see eqn (2) and (3)) were less than 1 eV which is surmountable under room temperature at experimentally applied potentials (U = −1.0 V). Thus, we would expect the proton–electron transfer barriers for CO2 reduction on the Au NCs to be thermally accessible at room temperature. Furthermore, assuming the activation energies for the proton–electron transfer steps scale with ΔGrxn, as in the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship, we would expect the lowest barriers to be observed on the ligand removed NCs.71 In our future work, we aim to address the detailed kinetic barriers for ligand removal, which appear to be thermodynamically feasible and responsible for converting an inert NC to an active one, as well as to probe the number of ligands a NC can lose while still maintaining structural integrity.
Conclusions
In this work, we applied ab initio electronic structure calculations to assess CO2 reduction and H2 evolution on fully ligand-protected (Au25(SR)18q) and partially ligand-removed (removal of –SR and –R) NCs in three charge states q = −1, 0, and +1. Our results demonstrate that regardless of charge state, the Au25(SR)18q NC is inactive for CO2 reduction due to the relative instability of the associated COOH intermediate. On the contrary, our calculations showed that the formation of partially-ligand removed NCs, Au25(SR)17q (q = −1, 0, +1) and Au25S(SR)17−, are feasible under reaction conditions. Moreover, Au25(SR)17q NCs and the Au25S(SR)17− NC stabilized the COOH intermediate more favorably than the Au25(SR)18q NCs. We therefore conclude that partially-ligand removed clusters, which expose Au and S sites, are the most active for CO2 reduction under experimentally applied potentials. We found that hydrogen evolution likely competes with CO2 reduction over the entire potential range of interest. By assessing selectivity, we determined that only the active Au25S(SR)17− NC would be selective towards CO2 reduction over H2 evolution. Overall, this work elucidates NC charge state and generation of active surface sites during electrocatalysis as responsible for the stabilization intermediates in CO2 reduction to CO.
