Introduction
As the worldwide convertible currency of industry and daily life, energy is a critical foundation for economic growth and social progress. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, have met the main energy demand. However, as a result of the rapid global economic development and rural urbanization,1,2 the energy consumption grew tremendously fast and now we are facing more and more serious shortage of the traditional fossil fuels. For example, the world crude oil production rate has outstripped its discovery rate since the 1980s, which will cause the decrease of the overall oil production after 2030.3 In fact, energy was selected as the single most important factor that impacts the sustainable prosperity of our society.4 On the other hand, the emissions of the greenhouse gases, such as CO2, are associated with traditional hydrocarbon fuel combustion and raise worldwide concerns about their impact on climate change. To weasel out of this predicament, alternative carbon-free energy options, such as solar, nuclear, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass, have been sought to fulfill the global energy demand to maintain both the rapid economy growth and the sustainable environmental protection.5 Though fossil fuels will still dominate the energy production in the next 40 years, the renewable sources are predicated to provide up to 90% of the total energy by the end of this century. Among them, solar energy has the largest potential of large-scale applications, which will take up about 65% of the total energy supply.6 After all, solar energy strikes the earth with about 180000 TW of radiant power and can provide enough energy for our present annual energy consumption (∼17 TW) in just about one hour.7,8
Solar energy could be utilized by several different strategies, such as solar to electricity conversion via photovoltaic cells, solar to thermal conversion with concentrated sunlight heat-engines or solar water heaters, solar to fuel conversion with solar water splitting cells and so on. Among all these methods, solar to hydrogen conversion is very promising because of the carbon-free and high gravimetric energy (143 MJ kg−1) characteristics of hydrogen, which is an excellent energy carrier for the intermittent solar energy and can be directly used as a fuel in engines or fuel cells.9 In fact, direct photo-reduction of water into hydrogen by using semiconductors has attracted great attention because of its advantage of using only water and sunlight, both of which are widely distributed, as raw materials.10–12
The solar hydrogen production has been a topic of intense research interest for more than 40 years. Since the discovery by Fujishima and Honda,13 who used TiO2 photoelectrodes to demonstrate the solar water splitting process, many materials have been extensively investigated in order to achieve the efficiency that could be commercialized for practical use. Now there are two types of cell configurations for solar water splitting: one is the colloidal configuration (photocatalyst cells) and the other is the photoelectrode configuration (photoelectrolysis cells).14,15 In the colloidal configuration, photocatalyst particles are suspended in the electrolyte, and each particle usually has active sites for both water reduction and water oxidation. In the photoelectrode configuration the semiconductor materials for light absorption are immobilized to be an electrode on which half of the water redox reaction takes place, while the other half reaction usually occurs at the counter electrode (prepared either using metal or other semiconductor materials) connected via an external circuit. Generally speaking, the photoelectrolysis cell could automatically separate the hydrogen evolution sites from oxygen and enable the photoelectrochemical investigation of materials more easily.
The major component of the photoelectrolysis cell, or the photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, is the photoanode, photocathode or both, and there are many previous reviews for the photoanode and the overall solar water splitting cell.16–25 In this feature article, we will focus on providing an overview on the recent efforts in developing photocathodes for solar hydrogen evolution. After a brief introduction of the principles of the photoelectrolysis cell, the materials recently investigated for photocathodes will be reviewed, together with the overview of several approaches used to improve the performance, such as the activity and stability. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in this field will be addressed.
Principles of photoelectrolysis cells
Overall solar water splitting
The solar water splitting principle can be briefly described by using Fig. 1(a). The photo-excited electrons and holes, which are produced (step (1)) in the photoelectrode by absorbing the photons with appropriate energy, are transferred (step (2)) to the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface to reduce/oxidize (step (3)) water into hydrogen/oxygen, respectively. The photoelectrode material should have appropriate valence/conduction band edges for straddling the water oxidation/reduction potential levels to split water without external bias. Using one single semiconductor to achieve the overall solar water splitting, the bandgap should be about 1.7 eV after considering the overpotentials for both the hydrogen evolution (ηc) and the oxygen evolution (ηa). This bandgap is higher than the water decomposition energy of 1.23 eV calculated from the standard Gibbs free energy.21 However, until now there is no robust photoelectrode material that could be used for the overall water splitting with promising energy conversion efficiency and fabrication cost, and much attention has been paid to study the two half-reactions of water splitting on photoanodes and photocathodes, respectively.

Photocathodes for hydrogen evolution
Photoanodes usually suffer significant photo-corrosion due to their self-photo-oxidation at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface by the photo-excited holes, and scavengers, such as S2− and SO32−, are required to prevent this photo-corrosion. In comparison, photocathodes based on p-type semiconductors are reported to be cathodically protected from this photo-oxidation, making them likely to be more stable than the photoanodes.10,21 In this case, the photo-generated electrons will migrate to the photocathode/electrolyte interface and the excited holes will transport to the counter anode through an external wire circuit or with wireless contact, which is facilitated by the band bending at the interface due to the space charge effects as shown in Fig. 1(b).11,26 To achieve the hydrogen evolution at the photocathode/electrolyte interface, the conduction band edge of the photocathode material should be more negative than the water reduction potential level in the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale. The scope of this article will be focused on the recent research progress of photocathodes, which can be combined with a counterpart – an anode to realize the whole water splitting reaction.
Photocathode materials
There are several main challenges for the semiconductor materials to be used for fabricating practical photocathodes. Firstly, the conduction band edge of the semiconductor should be more negative in the NHE than the hydrogen evolution potential level considering the corresponding overpotential. The photo-voltage, which is related to the bandgap, should be as large as possible to avoid using external bias or to release the constraint on the material selection for the counter anode. Fig. 2 shows the overview of the energy positions of the conduction band edge (CB) and valence band edge (VB) for several photocathode semiconductors. Secondly, the semiconductor should be visible-light responsive to make the best use of the solar radiation in order to increase the solar energy conversion efficiency as high as possible. Taking CdS (2.42 eV), Cu2O (2 eV) and CuGaSe2 (1.7 eV) as examples, their theoretical upper limits of conversion efficiency are 9%, 18% and 27.8%, respectively (Fig. 3). Thirdly, the material must be stable in aqueous electrolytes under illumination to ensure long lifetime. The last but not least is that the material should be earth abundant to guarantee both the high performance/price ratio and the feasibility of wide application. The rarest elements should not be used as light absorbers in the solar water splitting system, while minute quantities of them used as catalysts may be affordable such as the industrial application of Pt in fuel cells and exhaust gas treatment systems. To date there has been no material found to handle all these challenges well, although intensive research has been carried out.

The following reviews the recent progress of the photocathode materials which are divided into several groups including metal oxides, III–V group materials, Si, copper-based chalcogenides, and II–VI group materials.
Metal oxides
Compared to its non-oxide counterparts, metal oxide semiconductors usually have the advantage of a simple synthesis procedure. As a result of the intrinsic oxygen vacancy defects (VO) acting as electron donors, the metal oxide semiconductors, such as Fe2O3 (2.2 eV), WO3 (2.6 eV), and BiVO4 (2.4 eV), are generally n-type conduction materials and are used as photoanodes. Distinctively, several metal oxide semiconductors, such as binary oxide Cu2O (2.0 eV), ternary oxides CaFe2O4 (1.9 eV), CuNb3O8 (1.5 eV), CuFeO2 (1.5 eV), and LaFeO3, are dominated by the metal vacancy defects (VM) to show p-type conductivity and thus can be investigated as photocathodes.33–41 In fact, although metal oxides often meet the criteria with regard to the chemical stability and low cost, they usually have modest optical absorption coefficients, poor charge-carrier mobility and short charge-carrier lifetime. Therefore, the resultant photocurrent and energy conversion efficiency remain low.
As a simple p-type oxide semiconductor with a theoretical 18% solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency (Fig. 3), Cu2O is now attracting more and more attention. Previous studies reported that the band edges of Cu2O can straddle the water reduction and oxidation potential levels.27 The conduction band of Cu2O is 0.7 eV more negative in the NHE than the hydrogen evolution potential and the valence band is just slightly more positive than the oxygen evolution potential.42 Thus, a relatively large driving force to the hydrogen evolution reaction from Cu2O can be expected. With a direct bandgap of 1.9 to 2.2 eV, Cu2O can absorb the visible light of the solar spectrum well.43 These features make Cu2O a potential photocathode to achieve overall water splitting with no external bias. Unfortunately, the potential levels for the self-reduction from Cu2O to Cu (eqn (1)) and self-oxidation to CuO (eqn (2)) are all within the bandgap,44 which limit the stability of Cu2O in aqueous solution and thus the energy conversion efficiency improvement. Nevertheless, many efforts, such as optimizing crystal orientation, surface modification, and nanostructure design, have been made to improve the stability of Cu2O over the last few years. 2CuO + H2O + 2e+ → Cu2O + 2OH−(1) Cu2O + H2O + 2h+ → 2CuO + 2H+(2)
Diverse methods have been explored to produce Cu2O films. The electrodeposition is preferred due to its relative low cost and easy control of morphology, structure and orientation.45 A number of studies have been devoted to illustrate the relationship between the crystal orientations and the stability of Cu2O made by electrodeposition.39,43,46 By controlling the deposition conditions, Sowers et al. revealed that the predominately Cu+ terminated (111) surface in polycrystalline Cu2O is more stable than other orientations against reduction under illumination.39,47 By contrast, the single crystal of (211) or (311) with an O2− terminated surface has been proven unstable.48 Thus, Cu2O films with predominately Cu+ termination degrade not as fast as films with predominately O2− termination. These explorations on mechanisms about how the crystal structure influences the stability of Cu2O suggest that a controllable stability can be achieved.
Besides optimizing the Cu2O structure, recently there are many studies that focus on building the protecting heterojunction layer. In terms of photoelectrolysis, heterojunction structures have several advantages, such as holding multiple band gaps for matching the solar spectrum, improving the catalytic activity of the photoelectrode surface, and passivating the surface to reduce the carrier recombination and enhance the chemical stabilization.21,49,50 For the Cu2O photocathode, the main issue in the heterojunction layer design is to protect Cu2O from self-reduction while ensuring good charge transfer, which means that an aqueous solution-stable material with suitable band structure is required. One example is given by Paracchino et al.,27 using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to grow an Al:ZnO/TiO2 bi-layer on top of the Cu2O photocathode (Fig. 4(a)). They finally obtained a photocurrent density up to 7.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode, a subtype of the standard hydrogen electrodes for electrochemical processes) under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 4(b)), the highest ever for an oxide-based photocathode. Here, the suitable conduction band position of ZnO and TiO2 enables the photo-generated electrons to flow from the Cu2O automatically to the electrolyte. The thin Al:ZnO buffer layer which is applied in many other photovoltaic devices avoids the reduction of Cu2O at pinholes of TiO2 and forms a p–n junction with Cu2O to promote electron–hole separation.27,46,51 However, because of the Ti3+ (electron traps) in the TiO2 film and low driving force for electron injection into the electrolyte, the photocurrent degrades substantially even in 20 minutes of testing. Using the remnant ratio of photocurrent, the ratio of the photocurrent density at the end of the last light cycle to that at the end of the first light cycle, to characterize the stability of the photoelectrode, these authors have improved the stability to a remnant ratio of 62% over 10 hours of testing through the deposition of a semi-crystalline TiO2 overlayer onto Cu2O/Al:ZnO by controlling the ALD deposition temperature and selecting a suitable electrolyte.51

Another material used for developing the heterojunction is CuO. In 2009, Zhang and Wang prepared a copper oxide composite photocathode (Cu2O/CuO) through electrochemical deposition.45 Twice as much photocurrent (1.54 mA cm−2, see Fig. 5(a)) as that from the bare Cu2O electrode is achieved when measured at a potential of 0 V vs. RHE at a mild pH under illumination of AM 1.5G. The remnant ratio of photocurrent after 20 minutes testing was improved from 30.1% to 74.4%. In this structure, CuO as an indirect band gap semiconductor with relative low recombination rate has a good band alignment with Cu2O (Fig. 5(b)). The photo-generated electrons from Cu2O can easily transfer to the electrolytes through CuO while the hole transportation is hindered without phonon assisting. Besides the traditional ways to grow Cu2O/CuO, Han et al. developed an easy method to build a Cu2O/CuO heterojunction by fast annealing of a copper foil in H2–O2 flame.52 In such a way, a junction is formed between CuO(110) and Cu2O(111), which again exhibits a better PEC performance than the bare Cu2O photocathode.

Based on the idea of heterojunction construction, nanomaterials with special shapes, such as nanowires and nanorods which can reduce the diffusion distance for the photo-excited charge carriers to transfer from the generation position to the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, are used to improve the performance of the heterojunction structured photoelectrode. Although the diffusion length of the minority carriers (electrons) in the Cu2O film (less than 100 nm) is not compatible with the absorption length of light (i.e., 2.2 μm), the photocathode with highly aligned Cu2O nanowire arrays offers the possibility to accommodate this problem well and is expected to produce much higher photocurrent than that of the planar Cu2O photocathode.32,46 By fabricating highly aligned Cu2O/CuO/TiO2 nanowire arrays on an Au substrate, indeed the photoresponse and stability of Cu2O was much improved by the outer CuO/TiO2 bi-layers (Fig. 6(a)).46 The photocurrent increased from 0.45 mA cm−2 for Cu2O nanowire arrays to 0.84 mA cm−2 for Cu2O/CuO/TiO2 nanowire arrays (Fig. 6(b)) and the remnant ratio of photocurrent after a 20 minute testing also increased to 44%.

Incorporation of a co-catalyst or a plasmonic effect on the surface of the photoelectrode is also used to enhance the PEC performance of copper oxides. To distinguish from the photocatalyst (suspended colloidal particles in solution), the catalyst used to assist the light absorbers in accomplishing the full water redox reaction is usually termed as a co-catalyst. Pt, which has played an important catalytic role in many fields, such as the fuel cell technology, automotive emission control, and artificial fuel generation,53–56 is frequently used as a co-catalyst in water splitting. Other noble metals, such as Ru and Pd, have also been extensively investigated as co-catalysts on photoelectrodes. Guo et al. reported the deposition of Pd on CuO via photo-assisted electrodeposition enhancing the photocurrent through lowering the overpotential of hydrogen production and accelerating the electron transportation.57 MoS2+x was also investigated as a co-catalyst for the Cu2O photocathode.58,59 Morales-Guio et al. first reported that amorphous MoS2+x as a co-catalyst on the Cu2O/Al:ZnO/TiO2 electrode exhibited a photocurrent as high as 6.3 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE, which opened a new way for the application of earth abundant catalyst materials in basic electrolysis.58 Besides Cu2O, CuO is also used as a photocathode. Recently, Zhao et al. reported that for the CuO nanowire array photocathode a four-fold photocurrent enhancement was produced after being decorated with Ag nanoparticles of an average diameter of ∼85 nm, now due to the enhanced energy transfer from metal to the semiconductor by a surface plasmon resonance effect.60
Besides the binary metal oxide, ternary complex metal oxides offer new choices for the photocathode. One example is the p-type CaFe2O4. Ida et al. have investigated CaFe2O4 as a photocathode material and hydrogen gas evolved from its surface without any external voltage bias when being used together with a TiO2 photoanode.61 More impressively, the CaFe2O4 photocathode with metal doping shows a much higher photocurrent due to the expansion of the absorption wavelength range, the plasmon resonance effect, and the release of structure distortion after doping Ag in the CaFe2O4 structure (Fig. 7).62 Another example is the Cu(I)–niobate system. Joshi and Maggard reported a CuNbxOy series of films such as CuNbO3 with a band gap of 2.0 eV and CuNb3O8 with a smaller band gap. Through the intentional bandgap design, for CuNb3O8 which possesses a suitable conduction band for visible-light response, a cathodic photocurrent under visible-light irradiation with incident photon to current efficiency up to ∼6–7% and a Faradic efficiency of ∼62% were achieved.36 The Cu(I)–tantalate system including Cu2Ta4O11,20,63 Cu3Ta7O19, and Cu5Ta11O30 (ref. 64) has a relatively smaller range of bandgap from 2.4 to 2.6 eV and also exhibits high cathodic photocurrents in aqueous solutions under visible-light irradiation.64

III–V group materials
In the non-metal oxide semiconductors, III–V materials with relative narrow bandgaps have shown high photo-response activity. These materials can be divided into binary compounds such as InP, GaP and ternary compounds such as GaInP,65 GaInN66 and AlGaAs.67 Recently, III–V materials such as GaP (2.2 eV) and InP (1.34 eV) were utilized to split water with the assistance of external voltage bias.68–70
Despite GaP having large photo-voltage, the large planar structure not only is expensive but also limits the charge collection. Nano-texturing the GaP material is preferred in order to promote the charge separation and lower the overpotential.71,72 P. Yang's group reported a photocathode based on Zn doped GaP nanowires via the solution–liquid–solid method. With only 1/3000 of the amount of material used in the planar structure, the electrode showed a photocurrent density of about 0.1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination.68 Assisted by a Ru containing co-catalyst, Lee et al. reported that a p-type InP nanopillar photocathode prepared by simple self-masking reactive ion etching process could achieve 14% energy conversion efficiency.69 In their nanotextured structure, TiO2 acted as a passivation layer co-operating with the Ru co-catalyst to enhance the photocathode stability. Compared to the planar structure, the nanotextured structure lowers the surface energy of hydrogen desorption and improves the PEC performance. However, the usage of the corrosive electrolyte and the necessary bias hindered its wide application.69 Gao et al. also fabricated vertically aligned p-type InP nanowire arrays with noble-metal-free MoS3 nanoparticles as co-catalysts. Compared to noble metal co-catalysts, the photocathode efficiency after adding MoS3 is improved to 6.4% under AM 1.5G illumination with only 3% of the surface area covered by InP nanowires (Fig. 8).70

GaInP2 is an example of ternary compounds. p-Type GaInP2 with a band gap in the ideal range (1.8 to 1.9 eV) can serve as a photocathode, although the energetics of its band edges are not well aligned with water redox potential levels and requires an additional 300 mV voltage bias for water splitting.73 Khaselev and Turner designed a p–n GaAs/p–n tunnel junction/GaInP2/Pt tandem cell which reached 12.4% energy conversion efficiency and stimulated worldwide great interest.10 In this configuration, the visible light responsive GaInP2 (1.83 eV) top photocathode was internally biased by near-infrared light responsive bottom GaAs (1.42 eV) p–n junction cell through a tunneling diode interconnection (Fig. 9(a)). The GaAs bottom cell effectively supplied an internal voltage bias to make up the energy band mismatch to overcome the energy difference from the hydrogen evolution reaction. This device combined GaAs and GaInP2 to drive the charge separation and split water directly under illumination without external bias (Fig. 9(b)). Later, Licht et al. further improved the device and demonstrated 18.3% energy conversion efficiency.67 Similarly, Al0.15Ga0.85As (1.6 eV) and Si (1.1 eV) together can form a stacked multi-junction structure and has reached high energy conversion efficiency when catalyzed by RuO2. On the one hand, the extremely expensive cost of the raw materials and fabrication procedures made this kind of structure not cost competitive, despite the demonstrated industry scale efficiency over 10%. On the other hand, the current mismatch between different layers still limited the performance. Thus, Fan et al. recently exploited a lateral carrier extraction scheme of one-dimensional nanowire structures, consisting of n-GaN/tunnel junction/p-InGaN nanowire arrays and a Si solar cell wafer, without strict current matching requirement.74 The monolithically integrated photocathode exhibited a photon-to-current efficiency of 8.7% at a bias voltage of 0.33 V vs. RHE.74 Wu et al. reported that InGaP passivated GaAsP nanowires showed better photoluminescence than the unpassivated one because of the reduced density of surface trapping sites and the increased charge carrier confinement after passivation.75

Silicon
Until now, silicon is the most widely used semiconductor for solar energy conversion because of its earth abundance and its prevalence in industry. Besides its application in photovoltaic solar cells, p-Si is a promising photocathode because of its appropriate conduction band edge for hydrogen evolution. With a small bandgap (∼1.1 eV), its valence band edge is much lower in the NRE than the oxygen evolution potential level and therefore it requires an n-type photoanode to work together to achieve overall water splitting. However, low stability from etching or oxidizing in the electrolyte as well as no effective surface co-catalysts are the main reasons hindering the performance of the Si photocathode.
For the planar silicon structure, earlier studies have used metal catalysts such as Pt,76 Ni and Ni–Mo77 to lower the overpotential to efficiently transfer photo-charges for hydrogen evolution. Recently, cheap non-metal co-catalysts MoS2,78 TiO2,79 NiOx80 and Al2O3 (ref. 81) have been widely used as a surface protection layer in the PEC cell and are applied on the p-Si photocathode. Benck et al. deposited a thin layer MoS2 onto the n+p planar Si photocathode (Fig. 10) to achieve over 100 hours of stability in the electrolyte.78 Moreover, Ding et al. demonstrated exfoliated MoS2 covered planar p-Si as an efficient photocathode for hydrogen evolution.82 With n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi) treatment, the semiconducting 2H-MoS2 phase is converted into the metallic 1T-MoS2 phase and can accommodate more facile electrode kinetics. 1T-MoS2 made an invertible and fast electron transfer, while the holes were left in Si. Thus, a photocurrent up to 17.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination was achieved in this fast charge separation and slow charge recombination structure. With the protection of the MoS2 layer, the 1T-MoS2/Si photocathode was monitored periodically over 70 days, and no noticeable degradation in performance was observed.

The Si wire structure has been widely used in recent years. Because of the indirect bandgap of Si and the resultant large absorption length, nearly a 200 μm thickness is required for the planar structure. In the wire structure, separation between the absorption length of light and the collection length of photogenerated minority carriers is allowed and achieved, respectively via the length and radial directions of the wire.84 Because of their large semiconductor/electrolyte interfacial areas, more catalytic sites can be provided (Fig. 11).83 Spurgeon et al. have grown ordered arrays of crystalline p-type silicon (p-Si) microwires on a p+-Si(111) substrate by the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) method with Cu as the catalyst on both a Si(111) substrate85 and a flexible, optically transparent poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film.86 However, the low photo-voltage VOC of the p-Si/H2O junction limited the energy-conversion efficiency even after adding Pt particles as co-catalysts. By introducing a buried metallurgical n+p junction into the Si wires, the VOC was increased due to the larger band bending at the n+/p interface relative to the aqueous solution/p-Si interface.77 Recently, in combination with a nanosphere lithography technique, Huang et al. reported the successful fabrication of large-area ordered Si nanowire arrays (NWAs) by a cost-effective and scalable wet-etching process.87 Benefiting from the patterned and ordered NW structure, an increased surface area, increased light absorption from light trapping, shortened minor carrier diffusion length, and enhanced charge transfer can be achieved. The periodical Si NWA photocathode demonstrated a maximum photocurrent density of 27 mA cm−2, which is ∼2.5 times that of the planar Si electrode and the random Si nanowires electrode. However, even with a uniform 30 nm TiO2 layer deposited by ALD to serve as a protection layer with no pinholes, the stability of Si wire arrays still needs to be improved. Similar to other materials covered by MoS2, Esposito et al. employed a metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) Si–SiOx/Ti/Pt photoelectrode architecture that allowed for stable and efficient water splitting (Fig. 12(a)).88 The thin insulating SiOx layer protected the semiconductor from corrosion. The holes could be blocked from the interface and the electrons could directly transfer from the semiconductor conduction band edge to the Fermi level of the metallic collector (Fig. 12(b)). The Ti/Pt bilayer structure was designed to ensure good reaction kinetics from the Pt co-catalyst and a large photo-voltage from the low work function of the Ti layer across the MIS junction. In this structure, a thin, negatively charged inversion layer was formed next to the Si/SiOx interface, which enabled electron transfer to the electrolyte. Thus, a lower recombination was achieved.

For both planar and wire Si structures, the co-catalyst plays an important role in the PEC performance improvement. Dasgupta et al. deposited a submonolayer of Pt nanoparticles as a catalyst on Si NWs to achieve controllable catalytic behavior at a lower Pt loading level.89 McKone et al. have explored the behavior of Pt, Ni and Ni–Mo co-catalysts on both planar and NW structures of Si.83 The electroplated Ni–Mo binary alloy particles were found to have almost the same catalytic activity as Pt on the silicon photocathode. This makes the substitution of Pt by non-noble metal Ni–Mo possible.
Copper-based chalcogenides
The copper based chalcopyrites, such as the CuInxGa1−xSe2 (CIGS, 1.0–1.68 eV) and kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS, 1.0–1.5 eV), have shown impressive performance in photovoltaic solar cells owing to their high absorption coefficient of ∼105 cm−1, tunable direct bandgap, and high tolerance for grain boundaries.88,90–93 Considering choices of other chemical elements, the I–III–VI2 chalcopyrite semiconductors (I = Cu, Ag; II = Al, In, Ga; VI = S, Se, Te) can have wider tunable bandgap values (1.0–2.4 eV)29,30 and are usually p-type because of the intrinsic defects such as Cu vacancies. The chalcopyrite semiconductors have also been studied as photocathode materials in addition to their photovoltaics. In addition to CIGS, CuGaSe2 (1.7 eV), CuGa3Se5 (1.8 eV), and CuInS2 (1.5 eV) have also developed in recent years.6,94–96 While such photocathodes usually produce high photocurrent densities, most of them have narrow band gaps and inappropriate valence band edges and therefore are not suitable for practical solar water splitting.97
CIGS, with high conversion efficiency in the photovoltaic device, was investigated as the photocathode. Yokoyama et al. obtained a photocurrent density of 12 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE using the CdS/Pt modification.97 The loading of CdS and Pt increased the photocurrent and stability. Jacobsson et al. reported a photocurrent of 6 mA cm−2 in the configuration of a PEC cell.98 After adding the CdS and ZnO layers (Fig. 13(b)), the photocurrent was improved because the solid state p–n junction promoted charge separation and the photogenerated electrons could easily transport to the electrolyte interface (Fig. 13(a)). However, the photo-corrosion of ZnO and CdS eventually hindered the performance improvement.

Another example of chalcopyrite is CuGaxSey. Kim et al. showed that the polycrystalline Cu-deficient CuGaSe2 thin film grown via vacuum co-evaporation enlarges the bandgap with a better valence band edge for water splitting than CuGaSe2.95 However, similar to CIGS, to improve the charge separation, the p–n junction formation is a typical method to both passivate the photocathode and enhance the electron transfer to the electrolyte. ZnS, CdS and ZnO, which are widely used in photovoltaic solar cell structures to improve charge separation, are also employed in PEC photocathodes. Based on this, Kim et al. developed a copper gallium selenide (CuGa3Se5 (CGSe), Eg = 1.8 eV) photocathode covered with a ZnS buffer layer via chemical bath deposition and with Pt particles as a co-catalyst.95 At 0 V vs. RHE, the photocurrent density from the CGSe/ZnS/Pt electrode was increased to 8.03 mA cm−2 as compared to that of 3.04 mA cm−2 from the CGSe/Pt electrode. However, the diffusion of Zn ions through the grain boundaries may increase the n-type characteristics of the CGSe photocathode. Moriya et al. thus used CdS to modify CGSe. A significantly increased photocurrent (Fig. 14(A)) and over 20 days stability of hydrogen evolution under illumination were achieved.99 In this structure, the CdS thin layer was completely covered by the depletion layer and the resulting cathodic polarization further increased the depletion layer and obstructed the holes from the electrode to the electrolyte (Fig. 14(B)). More recently, Domen's group further reported a simple particle transfer method to prepare the CGSe/CdS/Pt electrode. With a tunable bandgap of copper gallium selenides via various compositional ratios of Ga/Cu, they demonstrated the largest photocurrent at a Ga/Cu ratio of 2.100 By forming a p–n junction structure between CuGa3Se5 modified (Ag,Cu) GaSe2 (ACGSe) and CdS, they observed a cathodic photocurrent of 8.79 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE with over 20 days continuous hydrogen evolution.96 Meanwhile, Gunawan et al. reported a Pt–In2S3 modified CuInS2 (1.5 eV) photocathode for water splitting with a photocurrent density of about 15 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G irradiation.101

CZTS is made of chemical elements that are abundant in the earth's crust (Cu: 50 ppm, Zn: 75 ppm, Sn: 2.2 ppm, S: 260 ppm). It has recently been investigated for solar water splitting by several groups.97,102–104 Li et al. prepared the single crystalline CZTS nanosheet arrays using a CuS nanosheet as a sacrificial template and yielded a photocurrent density of 1.32 mA cm−2, the highest value for the photocathode based on bare CZTS until now, at 0 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G irradiation.105
II–VI group materials
Many of the II–VI materials are well suited for various opto-electronic applications due to their high optical absorption coefficient. Being a typical II–VI material, CdS, with a direct band gap of 2.4 eV and appropriate valence/conduction band edges for water oxidation/reduction, is one of the most promising candidates with the potential to split water without external bias.21,28,31 The intrinsic CdS, which was found to be of n-type conduction as a result of the formation of the sulfur vacancies, suffered significant photo-corrosion due to its self-photo-oxidation at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface by the photo-generated holes. Huang et al. successfully prepared the p-type Cu doped CdS thin film with a direct band gap of 2.37 eV and high surface-to-volume ratio (Fig. 15(c)).106 Hydrogen evolution from the CdS:Cu/Pt photocathode in the nearly neutral and scavenger-free electrolyte demonstrated the feasibility of using the p-type CdS-based photocathode to achieve solar hydrogen production (Fig. 15(b)). A 0.6 mA cm−2 photocurrent of the CdS:Cu/Pt photocathode was achieved (Fig. 15(a)).

CdTe is one of the leading materials for thin film solar cells because of its optimum band gap (1.44 eV) and the variety of thin film preparation methods. The as-prepared CdTe films are usually p-type as a result of the formation of Te vacancies. Mathew et al. reported that the hydrogen evolution onset potential of the CdTe photocathode shifted by about 220 mV when exposed to one sun illumination and the modification with Ru improved both the stability and hydrogen evolution efficiency.107
Conclusions and perspectives
As presented above, while great effort has been made to find suitable photocathode materials for solar hydrogen production, until now no good candidate has been identified that can be used in practical large-scale application. Very few materials can simultaneously satisfy all the four harsh requirements as discussed previously: visible light response, appropriate conduction/valence band edges, high stability, and earth abundance with low cost.
While some materials reviewed in this feature article are from new efforts in developing semiconductor photocathodes for solar water splitting, most of them are in fact not new. Instead, the various approaches for device performance improvement, including nanostructure design, co-catalyst deposition, heterojunction formation and plasmonic effect have become the focus of research and are expected to continue in the future.
Visible light response is essential for photocathodes. This determines the theoretical upper limit of energy conversion efficiency. As reviewed before, the energy conversion efficiency of the photoelectrolysis cells based on semiconductor photoelectrodes was highly limited by the light absorption efficiency. In addition to choosing the appropriate bandgap which not only provides enough electron/hole energy for water decomposition but also for overcoming the overpotentials for the respective reduction/oxidation reactions, nanostructures in photocathodes play a positive role in enhancing light absorption. The optical properties of the nanostructured photocathode could be tuned via the controlled design of optical scattering and light trapping. Various nanostructures have been investigated in conjunction with the separation of the photo-excited charges. Plasmonic effects, on the other hand, have also been explored immensely for their potential applications in many different areas,108–110 including solar water splitting. The plasmonics can confine the light energy to the near-surface region of the photoelectrode as a result of both the surface plasmon resonances and photonic light trapping, and can thus decrease the required thickness of the light absorbing layer to reduce the material quantity to be used and the bulk recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. Until now, most of the plasmonic effects investigated for water splitting were carried out on photocatalytic particles and photoanodes.111,112 In the future, study of the plasmonics on photocathodes may attract more and more attention.
Charge separation and collection are the second factor to limit the energy conversion efficiency. Nanostructures with special shapes, such as nanowires and nanorods, can reduce the diffuse distance for the photo-excited charge carriers to transfer from their generation position to the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, and can decouple the conflicting demands between light absorption and charge carrier transport into two different geometric directions. The higher surface/volume ratio introduced by the nanostructure than the planar structure, in principle, can provide not only a larger photoelectrode/electrolyte interface area but also more catalytically active sites for the redox reactions to take place. For indirect bandgap materials like Si with long light absorption length, nanostructure optimization is an effective method to solve the conflicting demand between light absorption and charge separation. Until now, while it has been demonstrated that nanostructures indeed could enhance light absorption and speed up charge separation, nanostructure has unfortunately not brought the promised high energy conversion efficiency, most likely because the defects introduced at the increased surface areas may function as recombination centers for photo-generated carriers. Efforts to understand the surface defects and their roles in carrier recombination in the nanostructured materials must be emphasized in the future research. Methods to avoid or passivate the negative effects brought by the nanostructure should be sought.
Deposition of heterojunction layers has been taken as another general approach to achieve fast photo-generated carrier separation via local electric field generated in the p–n junction formed between the heterojunction layer and the p-type light absorber. In terms of photoelectrolysis, heterojunction structures have additional advantages, such as holding multiple bandgaps for better matching the solar spectrum, passivating the surface recombination centers, enhancing the chemical stability, and improving the catalytic activity of the photoelectrode surface.
The central reactions of solar water splitting are reduction/oxidization of water into hydrogen/oxygen aided with the collected photo-generated electrons/holes at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Even with appropriate energy band edges, most of the semiconductor materials mainly act as light absorbers but not as reactivity sites. The slow kinetics of water reduction occurring on the photocathode surfaces is normally a result of the low photo-activity of semiconductor surface which in turn induces accumulation of photo-generated electrons at the photocathode/electrolyte interface and thus self-photo-corrosion. To solve this problem, co-catalysts, which efficaciously reduce the activation energy of the chemical reaction by providing alternative reaction pathways, have been widely sought to increase the activity for water reduction and lower the reaction overpotential by appropriately anchoring on to the photocathodes. In addition to the traditional noble metal co-catalysts, recently, searching less expensive earth abundant co-catalysts opened a new direction of research. Nickel and nickel-based alloys as well as MoSx were the best studied non-noble metal catalysts for hydrogen production.18,113–115 To develop a cheap co-catalyst for almost all the photocathode materials to make best use of the photo-generated carriers and limit the self-photo-corrosion at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface will remain to be an important direction in future photocathode studies.
Stability is another critical issue in reducing the overall cost in solar hydrogen production. Unlike the photoanode, the photocathode materials may suffer from the photo-reduction corrosion when the self-reduction potential level lies more positively in the NHE than the water reduction potential level. To overcome this corrosion problem, thin corrosion-resistant layers which are charge transfer allowable and kinetically stable in the corresponding electrolyte under illumination could be deposited to stabilize the photocathodes. Sometimes, this thin corrosion-resistant layer may also function as the heterojunction layer or even be catalytically active. Metal oxides have been well studied as this kind of protecting layer before, and the earlier design was to prepare thick layers (>100 nm), which could result in good corrosion protection but with poor charge transfer.116 Thus, an ultrathin layer (tens of nanometers or even several nanometers) with good band alignment, good conductivity, and high crystalline quality should be further explored to solve this confliction between charge transfer and corrosion prevention.87,117–120
In future, one expects that the successful photocathode is to be made of composite material with designed structures. For visible light response and overall solar water splitting, semiconductor materials with appropriate bandgap and band edge positions should be chosen. To reduce the material usage and separate light absorption and charge separation, nanostructure designing is a good approach. To speed up charge separation, a heterojunction layer can be grown on top of the surface of the selected p-type semiconductor materials to form a p–n junction. If this heterojunction layer is not readily photo-corrosion resistive, another protection layer must be added. Such a composited and structured photocathode may be the only alternative to conquer the lack of nature-giving materials and to meet all the four harsh requirements for solar water splitting as discussed above. A study on the accompanied new problems, in particular the interface and interface defects will become fundamental before we can achieve high energy conversion efficiency for the photoelectrochemical process.
