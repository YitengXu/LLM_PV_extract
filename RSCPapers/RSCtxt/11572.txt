    , Accepted 15th March 2013First published on 15th March 2013AbstractIn this study, we report a facile one-step solvothermal approach for growing nanoparticle aggregates–texture nanosheets hierarchical TiO2 core–shell structure (HTCSS) via the synergistic interaction of butylamine and ethanol. Under specific conditions, the products obtained in ethanol tended to aggregate into spherical structures, but in butylamine preferred to form nanosheet structures. Optimal cooperation between butylamine and ethanol leads to the formation of a core–shell structure with nanoparticle aggregates as the core and texture nanosheets as the shell. The HTCSSs cover a wide radius range from 150 to 800 nm, which is comparable to the wavelength of visible light. Therefore, they can be effectively used as light scattering materials to improve light harvesting in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Furthermore, the HTCSSs possess a very high surface area of 228.5 m2 g−1 and main pore size centered at 2.0 nm. DSCs using HTCSSs with bifunctional character of light scattering and high surface area properties showed an photoconversion efficiency of 8.90% under AM1.5 illumination, which was much higher than that derived from P25 nanoparticles of an optimized film thickness (6.09%).
Introduction
As a promising alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted much attention because of their shorter energy pay-back time, simple fabrication procedures yet relatively high power conversion efficiency.1,2 A typical DSC consists of a wide bandgap semiconductor film sensitized by a monolayer of dye molecules, electrolyte containing redox couple, and platinized counter electrode. The key to DSCs is the development of highly efficient nanostructure electrode that provides an enormous internal surface area and thus ensure sufficient light absorption.3 For example, the major breakthrough for DSCs was the use of mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle films that provide enough surface area more than 1000 times larger than a flat electrode. Although the best photoconversion efficiency of 12.3% has been achieved for DSCs with mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle film, their performance is still limited by the poor absorption of available dyes at the longer wavelength region (>600 nm).4,5 The thickness of nanoparticles film cannot be increased without limitations to increase the optical path because the thicker film would exceed the electron diffusion length and influence electrolyte transport within the nanoparticle network. One promising alternative solution to this issue is employing large TiO2 particles (several hundreds of nanometers) as light scattering structures to increase the average optical path length of the light within the film.6 However, these large particles with a flat surface only have a role in light scattering since they sacrifice the accessible surface area for dye loading to generate additional electrons. To resolve this dilemma, many groups are motivated to develop hierarchical TiO2 micro–nanostructures, such as mesoporous beads, nano-embossed hollow spheres, hierarchical ellipsoids, spherical voids, and spherical nanoparticle aggregates, which can simultaneously provide light scattering and large surface area properties.7–15 To obtain a much bigger surface area, the synthetic strategies for such purpose-built hierarchical TiO2 micro–nanostructures usually have involved a combination of two or more independent procedures. For example, Caruso et al. have prepared mesoporous TiO2 beads through a combination of sol–gel and solvothermal process.7,8 Huang, et al. have prepared hierarchical TiO2 microspheres with a 1D structure by using a combined alcohothermal process and alkali hydrothermal treatment.9 Nakata et al. have fabricated TiO2 hierarchical nanostructural microspheres by a facile two-step method of electrospray and hydrothermal treatment.10 However, few papers report purpose built approaches to fabricate hierarchical spherical structures by one-step process.
In this paper, we have developed a facile one-step solvothermal approach for growing nanoparticle aggregates–texture nanosheets hierarchical TiO2 core–shell structure (HTCSS) via the synergistic interaction of butylamine and ethanol. The obtained HTCSSs cover a wide radius range from 150 to 800 nm, which is comparable to the wavelength of visible light. Furthermore, the HTCSSs possess a very high surface area of 228.5 m2 g−1 and main pore size centered at 2.0 nm. The obtained HTCSSs are suitable to be used as photoanode in DSCs since they can possess both light scattering and large surface area properties. Applying composite of 20 wt% HTCSS and 80 wt% nanoparticle in DSCs, an optimized photoconversion efficiency up to 8.90% has been achieved.
Experimental
In a typical synthesis, 0–40 mL of butylamine was mixed with 0–40 mL of ethanol to reach a total volume of 40 mL in a Teflon-lined autoclave (100 mL). The mixture was stirred for 10 min before the addition of 0.3 mL titanium butoxide (≥97%, Sigma-Aldrich). After stirring for another 1 h, the autoclave was sealed and then heated at 180 °C for 12 h. After the hydrothermal reaction, the white precipitate was collected via centrifugation, rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethanol for several times. Finally, they were dried in vacuum at 60 °C for further use.
Preparation of TiO2 films and DSSCs
Screen-printable pastes were prepared by the mixture of 80 wt% P25 TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa AG) and 20 wt% HTCSS. A total of 6 g of TiO2 powder was mixed with 3 g of ethyl cellulose (30–50 mPas, #46080, Fluka), 25 g of terpinol (anhydrous, #86480, Fluka), as well as 50 mL of ethanol. And then ground the mixture mechanically to form slurry. Finally, the mixture slurry was sonicated and concentrated by rotary-evaporator to obtain a viscous paste. As a comparison, screen-printable pastes made of P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, a composite of 80 wt% P25 nanoparticles and 20 wt% TiO2 microspheres with smooth surface (TMSS) were also fabricated according to the same procedure. Here, the used HTCSS was obtained in a mixture of 20 mL of butylamine and 20 mL of ethanol, while TMSS was achieved in 40 mL of ethanol.
A layer of TiO2 paste was coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (8 Ω per square, 2.2 mm thick, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd) by a screen-printing technique and then dried at 125 °C for 6 min. This coating and drying procedure was repeated until a desired thickness of TiO2 film was obtained. Then, the FTO glass coated with TiO2 film were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After that, they were soaked in a 0.05 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. Photoanodes were finally obtained after soaking TiO2 film in 5 × 10−4 M ruthenium bipyridyl dye (N719, Solaronix SA) in 1:1 volume ratio of ethanol and acetonitrile. Pt precursor, a solution of 5 × 10−3 M H2PtCl6 in isopropanol, was coated onto FTO glass. Then, the platinized counter electrodes were obtained by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 at 380 °C for 20 min. The photoanodes and counter electrodes were assembled into sandwich DSCs using Surlyn film (50 μm thick, DuPont). The redox electrolyte, composed of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M N-methylbenzimidazole, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile, was injected into DSCs by a vacuum filling method. The active area of the DSCs is 0.196 cm2.
Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Quanta 400). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker) was used to determine the crystalline phase of the samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation were carried out with a high resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2010) operating at 200 KV. The optical properties of the TiO2 films were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (Hitachi U-4100) equipped with an integrating sphere as accessory. The pore characteristics and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the powders were analyzed by N2 adsorption at 77 K with a volumetric adsorption analyzer (Quantachrome AS-1-MP). The TiO2 film thickness was measured by the 3D optical profiling system (Wyko NT1100). Electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of DSCs were characterized by an electrochemical workstation (CHI760C, CH Instruments) with a 5 mV AC signal over the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz under 100 mW cm−2 white illumination. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSCs were tested by a solar simulator (Newport-Oriel 91192, 100 mW cm−2) equipped with a digital sourcemeter (Keithley, 2400). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using the IPCE evaluation system for solar cells (Beijing Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd, Solar Cell Scan100).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the typical SEM and TEM micrographs of the as-synthesized HTCSSs obtained after hydrothermal treatment of 0.3 mL of titanium butoxide in a mixture of 20 mL butylamine and 20 mL ethanol. Fig. 1a and b show that monodisperse HTCSSs cover a wide radius range from 150 to 800 nm, which is comparable to the wavelength of visible light (Fig. S1 ESI†). Hore, et al. calculated the backward scattering effect of large solid particles at vacuum wavelength λ0 = 550 nm using Mie scattering theory, which shows that solid particles of 50–700 nm in radius could be effectively used as back scatters.15 Therefore, HTCSSs with a wide size distribution would be more suitable to reflect various wavelengths of visible light than large particles of narrow and uniform size distribution as reported elsewhere. Fig. 1c revealed that nanosheets of HTCSSs have a lattice spacing of 0.711 nm, matching with the double spacing of a (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2. For efficient functioning of the DSCs, it is generally recognized that ruthenium-based sensitizers preferred to absorb on the exposed anatase (101) surface through carboxylate groups, which are anchored via a bidentate configuration bridging two adjacent titanium sites.16Fig. 1d shows that the core of HTCSSs is spherical nanoparticle aggregates composed of densely packed 16 nm diameter nanoparticles. Fig. 1e and f further confirmed that HTCSSs presents a core–shell structure consisting of nanoparticle aggregates as the core and assembled texture nanosheets as the shell, with a shell thickness of about 100 nm.

The XRD patterns of the above HTCSS sample was also measured, as shown in Fig. 2. The apparent peaks at 2θ values of 25.37°, 37.91°, 48.16°, 54.05°, and 62.87° are attributed to the anatase planes of (101), (004), (200), (105), and (204), respectively, indicating the formation of the anatase TiO2 phase (JCPDS no. 73–1764, tetragonal, I41/amd, a = b = 0.4593 nm and c = 0.2959 nm).

Fig. 3 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm (77 K) and their corresponding pore size distribution curve of HTCSS sample. The isotherms of HTCSS product display a type IV curve with a H2 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, which is associated with capillary condensation taking place in mesopores.17 The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curve derived from the desorption branch of the isotherm shows a narrow peak centered at 2.0 nm. The specific surface area of HTCSS sample, as calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, is up to 228.4 m2 g−1. Therefore, the unique HTCSS composed of two levels of structuring in nano and macro length scales, would make significant contributions not only to the increase of the specific surface area at nano scale but also enhancement of light absorption due to the light scattering structure at micro scale.

Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of products by hydrothermal treatment of 0.3 mL titanium butoxide in 40 mL butylamine–ethanol mixture with various volume ratios at 180 °C for 12 h. When using 40 mL of pure ethanol solvent, TiO2 microspheres with smooth surface (TMSS) were formed (Fig. 4a and b) and their radius are in the range from 450 to 1050 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). While a solvent mixture of butylamine and ethanol (35 mL/5 mL in volume ratios) was used, the morphology of products exhibited spherical shape with rough surface (Fig. 4c and d). With further increasing the volume ratio of butylamine to ethanol to 10 mL/30 mL, the textured nanosheets began to coat onto the spherical aggregates and HTCSSs formed (Fig. 4e and f). While keeping increasing the volume ratio of butylamine to ethanol from 15 mL/25 mL (Fig. 4g and h) to 20 mL/20 mL (Fig.1), and to 30 mL/10 mL (Fig. 4i and j), the size of the HTCSSs gradually decreased and the height of coated nanosheets became obviously larger. While further increasing the volume ratio of butylamine to ethanol to 35 mL/5 mL, only dispersed nanosheets were achieved (Fig. 4k). When a growth solution containing only 40 mL of butylamine was used, stacks of laminated nanosheets were obtained (Fig. 4l).

On the basis of the above observations, a plausible mechanism was proposed addressing the formation of HTCSSs (Scheme 1). In the presence of ethanol without butylamine, in the beginning of the reaction, the alcoholysis of Ti4+ is initially formed Ti–OH.18 Large amounts of Ti–OH were able to be easily assembled and eventually formed a TiO2 microsphere structure due to the decrease in interfacial energy.19 Generally, the orientation growth mechanism has been employed to elucidate the formation process of such structures.20 Usually, the TiO2 nanostructure is traditionally regular microspheres with smooth surfaces.
 Scheme 1  Schematic representation for the growth of HTCSSs via synergistic effect of butylamine and ethanol regents. 
In the presence of butylamine and ethanol, from the FESEM results (Fig.1 and 4), butylamine may promote the formation and growth of TiO2 nanosheets by adjustment of the electrostatic interaction in the surface of TiO2 microspheres composed of nanocrystals. From Fig.1f and g, we find the shell is similar to the trapping light structure of silicon solar cells formed by etching process. Therefore, we concluded that butylamine may have an obvious corrosion effect on the surface of the TiO2 microspheres. The growth mechanism of these nanosheets was ascribed to heterogeneous nucleation.21 Compared to NaOH, the weak basicity of butylamine is favorable to heterogeneous nucleation due to slow reaction rate. To the best of our knowledge, the corrosion effect of butylamine on the surface texture layer of TiO2 microspheres is reported for the first time. The corresponding detailed corrosion mechanism was still underway. From Fig. 1f and g, we reasonably assumed that the Ti precursor first reacted with ethanol, forming the TiO2 microsphere core, then the TiO2 nanosheets shell due to the different reaction activities of butylamine and ethanol of Ti precursor.
To investigate light scattering effect of HTCSSs on the performance of DSCs, we used 20 wt% HTCSS–80 wt% P25 nanoparticle composite film as photoanode in DSCs. The used HTCSSs were obtained by using a mixture of 20 mL butylamine and 20 mL ethanol in reaction. For comparison, DSCs using commercially available P25 nanoparticles and 20 wt% TMSS–80 wt% nanoparticle composite film were also fabricated under the same conditions and their photovoltaic parameters were tested in parallel. The used TMSSs were grown in 40 mL of ethanol. Fig.5 shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of these DSCs at the similar film thickness. When there is no scattering structure in electrodes, short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) is only 13.64 mA cm−2 for 21.1 μm-thick P25 nanoparticle film, but with TMSS and HTCSS as light scattering in the electrodes, JSC increased to 15.0 mA cm−2 for 21.3 μm thick TMSS–nanoparticle composite film, and to 17.22 mA cm−2 for 21.6 μm-thick HTCSS–nanoparticle composite photoanode. Furthermore, compared to a P25 nanoparticle electrode, the slight increase in fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (VOC) was also observed after the introduction of TMSS and HTCSS as scattering structures in the electrodes. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (η) was obviously improved from 5.71% for P25 nanoparticle film to 7.31% for TMSS–nanoparticle composite film, and to 8.90% for HTCSS–nanoparticle composite film. Furthermore, the η reached an even higher value of 9.3% for HTCSS–nanoparticle composite electrode at 500 W m−2 solar intensity (Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 5  Current density–voltage curves of DSCs prepared from HTCSS–P25 nanoparticle composite, TMSS–nanoparticle composite, and P25 nanoparticles, respectively. 
The photovoltaic parameters of these DSCs with different film thickness are also summarized in Table 1. The best performance of DSC, made of pure P25 TiO2 nanoparticles, was achieved using 18.8 μm-thick film, exhibiting a η of 6.09%. Compared to the P25 nanoparticle photoanodes with an optimized thickness, an increase of 46.14% in the conversion efficiency was obtained for the 21.6 μm-thick HTCSS–nanoparticle composite electrode. As summarized in Table 1, The DSCs made of HTCSS–nanoparticle composite possessed higher JSC, VOC, FF, and η than those of DSCs made of TMSS–nanoparticle composite and pure P25 nanoparticles with similar film thickness. The effect of HTCSS on the enhancement of short-circuit current densities and power conversion efficiency can be attributed to the following factors. Firstly, the BET surface area of HTCSS is larger than that of TMSS (111.1 m2 g−1, Fig. S4, ESI†) and P25 nanoparticles (54.7 m2 g−1),22 leading to absorb more dye molecules. Secondly, HTCSS of 150–750 nm in radius are much more comparable to the wavelength of visible light than TMSS of 450–1050 nm in radius. Thirdly, the textured surface formed by nanosheets in HTCSS can also be helpful to diffusely reflect the incident light many times, as compared to TMSS. The corresponding IPCE curves are shown in Fig. 6. The higher IPCE values of the HTCSS–nanoparticle composite electrode compared to TMSS–nanoparticle composite and P25 nanoparticles is due to their higher surface area and higher dye loading (Fig. S6†), confirming the high light-to-electricity conversion yield of HTCSS with surface texture structure of nanosheets.

 Fig. 6  Action spectrum of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of DSCs composed of different photoanodes thin film with similar thickness: HTCSS–nanoparticle composite, TMSS–nanoparticle composite and P25 nanoparticles. 
To quantify the light-scattering capabilities, the diffuse reflectance spectra of the HTCSS–nanoparticle composite, TMSS–nanoparticle composite, and P25 nanoparticle films were measured, as shown in Fig. 7a. The diffuse reflectance of HTCSS–nanoparticle composite is much enhanced compared to that of the TMSS–nanoparticle composite and P25 nanoparticle films, respectively. Correspondingly, the absorption of HTCSS–nanoparticle composite electrode is also higher than that of TMSS–nanoparticle composite and P25 nanoparticle electrodes, respectively (Fig. 7b). It has been found that the transmittance of the P25 films (Fig. S7†) increased gradually from ca. 500 to 800 nm, whereas the films composed of HTCSS–nanoparticle composite had very low transmittance in the visible and near-infrared regions (Fig. S7†), as compared to TMSS–nanoparticle composite with similar thickness. The low transmittance of the HTCSS–nanoparticle composite film suggests that the incident light is significantly obstructed due to the strong scattering or reflection within the films made from HTCSS–nanoparticle composite.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further used to investigate charge transport and recombination in DSCs. Fig. 8a shows the Nyquist plots of DSCs made of HTCSS–nanoparticle composite, TMSS–nanoparticle composite, and P25 nanoparticle electrodes, respectively. Three semicircles, representing the redox reaction of I−/I3− at the Pt/electrolyte interface, electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and diffusion of the I−/I3− redox electrolytes electron, were observed in the high-frequency (for 103 to 105 Hz) and middle-frequency region (for 1 to 103 Hz), and low-frequency region (for 0.1 to 1 Hz), respectively.23,24 The electron transport parameters such as sheet resistance (RS), charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (R1), and charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (R2), were deduced by fitting Nyquist plots to an equivalent circuit (Fig. 8b). As shown in Table 2, the values of RS and R1 for DSCs are very close since these DSCs use the same kind of electrolyte and Pt counter electrodes. However, the charge transfer resistance R2 (14.84 Ω) of DSC based on HTCSS–nanoparticle composite is obviously smaller than that of DSCs based on TMSS–nanoparticle composite (17.28 Ω) and P25 nanoparticles (18.12 Ω). These results reveal that tightly interconnected nanoparticle aggregates and texture crystalline nanosheets with exposed (101) faces of HTCSS would favor the charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, as compared to TMSS. Also, compared with smooth surface of TMSS, P25 nanoparticles could be easily packed into interior of the texture nanosheets of HTCSS and then close contacts formed. Furthermore, ruthenium-based sensitizers is preferred to absorb on the exposed anatase (101) surface through carboxylate groups via a bidentate configuration bridging two adjacent titanium sites, which may be helpful for the electron injection from the dye excited state into the TiO2 conduction band quickly.14,16 The HTCSS and TMSS exhibit the anatase phase (Fig. S5, ESI†), while P25 nanoparticle is a mixture of ca. 30% rutile and 70% anatase.25 The above results can be confirmed by the lifetime of electrons. According to Bode phase of DSCs in Fig. 8c, the electron lifetime can be estimated from the peak frequency value of the middle impedance semicircle (from 1 to 103 Hz).23 (1)

As shown in Table 2, the electron lifetime in HTCSS–nanoparticle composite electrode is longer than that in TMSS–nanoparticle composite and P25 nanoparticle electrode, respectively. According to the EIS analysis, the superior performance of HTCSS–nanoparticle composite DSCs could be attributed to the effective retardation of the charge recombination reaction between photo-injected electrons with I3− and fast charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.14,24,26,27
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a facile one-step solvothermal route to grow nanoparticle aggregates–texture nanosheets hierarchical TiO2 core–shell structure via the synergistic interaction of butylamine and ethanol. The HTCSSs possess a very high surface area of 228.5 m2 g−1 and main pore size centered at 2.0 nm. Furthermore, the HTCSSs cover a wide radius range from 150 to 800 nm, which is comparable to the wavelength of visible light and therefore can act as light scattering structure in DSCs. A maximum photoconversion efficiency of 8.90% has been achieved by DSCs consisting of the HTCSS–nanoparticle composite film, showing 46.14% improvement over that derived from P25 nanoparticles of an optimized film thickness (6.09%).
