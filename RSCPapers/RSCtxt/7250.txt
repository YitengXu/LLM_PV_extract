1. Introduction
Compared to the carbon nitride allotropes, g-C3N4, which is the most stable of all under ambient conditions, has been intensively studied since 2009.1,2 It is recognized as one of the best ingredients to cope with the depleting issues of fossil fuels and environmental threats. Typically, significant attention has been allocated to g-C3N4-based photocatalysis since the first discovery by Wang and co-workers in 2009, and their pioneering paper published in Nature Materials has gained 8099 citations to date (within 12 years).3 g-C3N4 is the rising star in the photocatalytic field owing to its promising properties, including its unique optical, electrical, structural, and physiochemical properties, which make it a new multifunctional material for a wide variety of energy and environmental photocatalytic applications.
g-C3N4 is considered a novel n-type polymeric semiconductor that can be easily prepared using nitrogen-rich precursors such as urea, melamine, thiourea, and dicyandiamide through thermal polycondensation (Fig. 1A and B), unlike the metal-based photocatalysts for which the preparation methods require high-cost metal salts.3–6 g-C3N4 is feasible for forming π-conjugated graphitic planes, in which the tri-s-triazine ring units are composed of sp2-hybridized nitrogen and carbon metal-free g-C3N4, thereby favoring the charge carrier transport. Analogous to graphene nanosheets, the 2D g-C3N4 nanosheet exhibited extraordinary electronic, physicochemical, and optical properties as compared to the bulk.7 The advantages and disadvantages of g-C3N4 are listed in Fig. 1C. g-C3N4 has unique photoelectronic properties such as visible light responsivity with a band gap of 2.7 eV, appropriate conduction (CB; ca. −1.1 eV vs. normal hydrogen electrode) and valence band (VB; +1.6 eV vs. normal hydrogen electrode) positions, excellent charge mobility, suppressed charge carrier recombination (comparative to 0D and 1D nanomaterials), and nontoxicity.8–14 As verified through TGA analysis, the aromatic C–N heterocycles resulted in the thermally stable g-C3N4 up to 600 °C. The strong van der Waals interactions between layers cause g-C3N4 to be chemically stable in most solvents.15 However, the 2D nanosheets are not eco-friendly and less biocompatible because of their preparation method involving aggressive acid treatment or chemical exfoliation.16,17 The photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 nanosheets is confined by limited active sites, boundaries, and exposed edges, in addition to serious agglomeration due to strong van der Waals forces, thereby limiting the H2O2 intermediate product transport, which poisons g-C3N4 during the photocatalytic process.18,19

Generally, driving a photocatalytic water splitting reaction by a prototypical g-C3N4 polymer is thermodynamically feasible due to the C2p and N2p orbital bands straddling the water splitting redox potentials.23–28Fig. 2 shows that g-C3N4 possesses a suitable CB position for various reduction reactions. The solar-driven photocatalytic water splitting is artificial photosynthesis that mimics the redox reaction and thermodynamics of photosynthesis.29 Although g-C3N4 materials exhibit unique mechanical and electronic properties, the existence of grain boundaries, the non-porous nature and low surface area (<10 m2 g−1) of g-C3N4 still limit the exploitation of this material for extended applications.30

Considering the importance of its specific surface area and specific pore volume in catalysis and adsorption, tailoring the porosity in the carbon nitride matrix has received enormous attention in the last decade by templating strategies. The effectiveness (porosity effect) of mesoporous and highly ordered porous g-C3N4 nanostructures on various catalytic applications has been verified due to the large specific surface area, and rich reactive and accessible crystalline pore walls for mass transfer.20,31,32 In 2016, Pawar et al. successfully proved the nanoporous effect of 1D microrod g-C3N4 towards superior photocatalytic performance and prolonged carrier lifetime, credited to the existence of ample interconnected reactive sites and quantum confinement effects.33 By employing NH4HCO3 as a bubble template, Liu et al. synthesized flower-like porous g-C3N4, which promoted charge separation and transfer.34 Although hard templating/nanocasting and soft templating/self-assembly are the common routes for mesoporous g-C3N4 preparation, the nanocasting method usually involves tedious processes and hazardous reagents for template removal such as HF, NH4F, and strong NaOH solution. Moreover, nanocasting engineering compromises the crystallinity, which disfavors the excited charge separation.
Apart from the issue of limited surface area, rapid charge carrier recombination kinetics is another obstacle that impedes the progression of photocatalytic performance. Notably, charge recombination usually happens on the surface or in the bulk of semiconductors (Fig. 3A). Hence, forming heterojunctions through surface decoration is an effective way to prevent fast recombination by forming a built-in field associated with the Schottky barrier.37–39 Architecting unique surface characteristics and morphologies of different nanostructured g-C3N4 should lead to the improvement of charge transportation, migration, and mass diffusion of the g-C3N4 matrix, in addition to improving the surface reactive activity. For example, a well-defined louver-like P-doped carbon nitride nanowire array exhibited remarkable visible-light-driven H2 evolution activity and photostability against the bulk, credited to the synergetic effects between structural topology and dopant, as demonstrated by the first-principles calculations. The grafting of cocatalysts is important for H2 promotion because most photocatalysts are incapable of activating hydrogen on the surface. Immobilizing cocatalysts on the photocatalyst surface, such as the noble metals, is also capable of improving the charge carrier separation, as well as reducing the activation energy for efficient surface catalytic reactions.40 Nevertheless, the cost and scarcity of these noble metals are the restricting factors for practical applications, which compel the exploration of alternative low-cost elements. Achieving a homogeneous dispersion of the cocatalyst on the photocatalyst surface is also one of the benchmarks of excellent photocatalytic activity. Thus, the careful design of both the bulk and surface properties of the photo-active materials in achieving high photocatalytic performance is realizable in the case without cocatalyst.

There have been some reviews unveiling the history of photocatalyst development, photocatalyst structure, the functions of cocatalysts, synthesis methods of different dimensional g-C3N4, their properties, and applications in energy-related fields. In 2017, Zhang et al. presented a concise overview of the surface engineering of g-C3N4 with cocatalysts including noble and transition metals, as well as carbon-based materials.41 Yang et al. discussed the strategies for modifying g-C3N4-based photocatalysts towards efficient solar water splitting through interface engineering, doping, and defect engineering.42 Ramakrishna and co-workers reviewed the basic concepts of photocatalytic water splitting and provided guidelines for the selection of suitable photocatalysts that could promote solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion and apparent quantum yield (AQY).43 In 2019, Mishra et al. presented a review that covered the latest developments of g-C3N4 for H2 generation such as the general aspects, electronic properties of g-C3N4, nanostructure modification of g-C3N4 in various dimensionalities, and non-metal and molecular doping of g-C3N4.44 Recently, Cao et al. presented a critical review that highlighted the development of mutual combinations of g-C3N4/polymer for advanced properties.45 Apart from the aforementioned H2 yield-enhancing strategies, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is also a viable approach to trigger and accelerate H2 production by providing additional driving energy (electrical energy).46–48 In such cases, the photoelectrode materials are the prime factors that dictate the efficiency of the photocatalytic H2 activity because an ideal photoelectrode material should exhibit excellent electrical conductivity to favor the charge transport, thereby resulting in a lower rate of charge carrier recombination. In brief, excellent photocatalytic performance is always accompanied by a flawless or an ideal photocatalyst or photoelectrode that meets the basic thermodynamic requirements.
In this review, we will not be discussing the synthesis methods nor applications in a wide range of fields. In contrast, we present a comprehensive overview of the development of decorated g-C3N4, in addition to emphasizing their effects, alterations, and improvements in photocatalytic and photo-dynamic performances upon g-C3N4 decoration. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations (pristine g-C3N4) and reveal approaches to overcome the disadvantages. We first investigate how the engineering of the porosity solves the compromised surface area and pore volume for mass transfer, which are important criteria for a photocatalyst. Subsequently, we discuss the construction of heterojunctions and unique morphologies that are capable of altering the band alignment, thereafter widening the light absorption ability and prompting excellent photocatalytic performance. Lastly, the challenges and prospects of g-C3N4 in water splitting are discussed. It is expected that this review will help the readers, especially the beginners in this field, to easily understand the pioneering works and the current progression of g-C3N4 for the H2 evolution application.
2. Unique properties of g-C3N4
2.1 Electronic properties
The performance of a photocatalytic process is mainly dictated by the electronic properties of the g-C3N4 light active material. To gain a better understanding of the g-C3N4 electronic structure, density functional theory calculations (DFT) were applied to understand in detail the oxidation and reduction levels of the valence and conduction bands (Fig. 4A–C). DFT is a powerful tool that is employed to investigate the energy, geometric structure, electronic, and optical properties of g-C3N4. DFT calculations provide information from an atomic level to a molecular level and unit cells. The effects of element doping on the geometric and electronic properties of a photocatalyst, as well as the interactions between components, are discoverable through DFT studies.49

DFT studies show that the melem molecule, polymeric melon, and fully condensed g-C3N4 possess band gaps of 3.5, 2.6, and 2.1 eV, respectively. The theoretical band gap of polymeric melon is close to the experimentally measured band gap of a defective bulk g-C3N4 (2.7 eV).50 According to the DFT investigation, the VB of g-C3N4 is composed of N2p orbitals at about +1.53 eV, which is preferable for the OER reaction. The CB of g-C3N4 is composed of hybridized N2p and C2p orbitals with a CB minimum value of −1.12 eV, which is sufficient for the HER reaction (Fig. 4D).44 Photoexcitation resulted in spatial charge separation between the electrons in the VB and holes in the VB, implying that the oxidation process (H2O to O2) preferably occurred at the nitrogen atom, whereas the carbon atoms served as the reduction sites for H+ to H2.3 It is notable that initiating a four electron-based OER is difficult because the OER requires higher overpotentials than the HER, hence the OER is considered as a key half-reaction to attain overall water splitting. Therefore, modifying g-C3N4 from the aspect of the electronic band configuration by reducing the VB potential is expected to improve the photooxidation strength, consequently improving its OER performance.51
2.2 Crystal structure and surface physicochemical properties
In general, C3N4 possesses seven different polymorphs: α-C3N4, β-C3N4, cubic C3N4, pseudocubic C3N4, g-h-triazine, g-h-heptazine, and g-o-triazine, with band gap energies of 5.49 eV, 4.85 eV, 4.30 eV, 4.13 eV, 2.97 eV, 2.88 eV, and 0.93 eV, respectively. Except for the pseudocubic C3N4 and g-h-triazine, the other five phases of C3N4 exhibited indirect band gaps in their bulk structures. Among them, β-C3N4 is well known due to its super hard and low compressibility features, similar to that of a diamond. When it comes to the stacking of the 2D g-C3N4 layered structure (Fig. 4E), two different condensation states, which are the s-triazine units (ring of C3N4 in Fig. 4F) with a periodic array of single carbon vacancies, and the tri-s-triazine/heptazine subunits (tiring of C6N7 in Fig. 4G) connected through planar tertiary amino groups with larger periodic vacancies in the lattice are the primary building blocks in a single layer of the g-C3N4 network. Experimental and theoretical results manifested that tri-s-triazine-based g-C3N4 is much more stable than the triazine-based g-C3N4, thus tri-s-triazine is regarded as the most accepted basic unit for the g-C3N4 network.22,52 The g-C3N4 materials that feature electron-rich and surface defects render unique nucleophilic character from basic surface functionalities for CO2 activation or H-bonding motifs (Fig. 4H), thus widening its applications in the catalysis field, as compared to the defect-free g-C3N4. Hydrophobicity is one of the crucial issues to be solved by introducing hydrophilic materials such as oxygen-containing groups through chemical oxidation because this issue weakens the interactions between interfacial layers that could severely affect charge transport and separation.53–55
2.3 Adsorption properties
A wide variety of adsorbates can be adsorbed on the multifunctional groups and defect sites of g-C3N4, either through physical adsorption such as Π–Π stacking interactions, electrostatic attraction, or chemical interactions (surface complexation or acid-base interactions). Comparatively, electrostatic attraction and chemical interaction resulted in better adsorption properties of g-C3N4 due to much stronger interactions as compared to the weaker Π–Π stacking interactions. DFT calculations revealed that strong dipole interactions induced by electron-rich nitrogen at the microporous edges of g-C3N4 are the main factors for achieving high capacity, regenerative, and selective CO2 capture. In summary, the g-C3N4 photocatalyst must have rich basic nitrogen-containing groups, high surface area, porous structure, and suitable band gap for applications in the photoreduction of CO2 and H2 evolution because porous g-C3N4 guarantees excellent light-harvesting capability, charge separation, transport, and adsorption for their respective reactants.56,57
3. Basic principles of photocatalytic water splitting
Hydrogen (H2), as the simplest and cleanest element, is alluring because it produces zero pollutants where water is the only by-product and it has a higher energy content of 122 kJ g−1 as compared to hydrocarbons. To date, two practical technologies that are still ongoing to produce H2 are the steam reforming of methane and hydro-electrolysis. Despite steam reforming being the most common approach used in most industries, the disadvantages of steam reforming are as follows: (i) it is an endothermic reaction that requires a high input of reaction temperature to dissociate CH4 (eqn (1)); (ii) an extra step named the water gas shift (eqn (2)) is needed to obtain pure H2 from a mixture of CO/H2. H2O + CH4 → 3H2 + CO(1) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2(2)
The electrolysis process is not suitable for large-scale H2 production due to its high cost factor. As such, making use of solar energy as the main power source would be the best remediation for the aforementioned issues because the continuous supply of solar energy from the sun is 104 times greater than the consumption rate of mankind.58–60
The photocatalytic water splitting reaction is described as an “uphill reaction” because this chemical process requires a huge positive change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG° = 238 kJ mol−1), with a minimum photon energy of 1.23 eV to thermodynamically kick-start the splitting process of one water molecule into H2 and 1/2O2 (eqn (3)). Both the OER (eqn (4)) and HER (eqn (5)) are co-occurring reactions for the mean of an overall water splitting process. It is speculated that with the supply of a minimum photon energy of 1.23 eV, it is possible to fully utilize the visible spectral light range (400< λ <800 nm), or even up to the near-infrared region, with the condition of overcoming the activation barrier in the charge transfer process between water molecules and the photocatalyst. This issue will not be reviewed herein because Professor Maeda has thoroughly discussed it in his invited review published in 2011.35 In this section, we will briefly introduce the working mechanisms of two different water splitting processes, which are the photoelectrochemical (PEC) process and semiconductor-based photocatalysis. It is important for the readers to first understand and differentiate the distinguishing features of both mechanisms in photocatalysis. 2H2O → 2H2 + O2(3) 2H+ + 2e− → H2(4) 2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+(5)
To accomplish an efficient overall water splitting reaction, it is of utmost importance that the backward reaction (reformation of water) is strictly prohibited to ensure the occurrence of an efficient overall water splitting reaction. It is important that the valence band maximum (VBM) of the photocatalyst should be more positive than the oxidation potential of H2O to O2 (1.23 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), while a more negative conduction band bottom potential than the reduction potential of H+ to H2 (0 V vs. NHE at pH 0) is the minimum pre-requisite to achieve overall water splitting (refer to the band gaps of selected oxides, chalcogenides, and nitrides in Fig. 2.
The research on semiconductor photocatalysis was initiated by Honda and Fujishima using TiO2 electrode as the photoanode and Pt as the cathode with an external bias in the case of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.35,61 When the n-type semiconductor such as TiO2 is illuminated by light, holes and electrons will first be generated, followed by the migration of photogenerated electrons to the Pt counter electrode to reduce H+ to H2 when an anodic potential is applied through an external circuit, leaving the holes on the TiO2 surface to form O2 (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, in the absence of an external electric circuit, a metal–semiconductor composite, for instance Pt/TiO2, is formed and this metal component is usually the cocatalyst, while the semiconductor is the so-called photocatalyst. In this context, the water splitting process will occur on the composite itself (Fig. 1B) where the photogenerated electrons in the VB are excited to the CB, thereafter inducing the reduction process. On the other hand, the holes in the VB cause oxidation reactions. Bear in mind that electrons will not migrate through the external circuit in this case, which distinguishes between the PEC reaction and semiconductor-based photocatalysis.
Focusing on the semiconductor-based photocatalysis, the overall water splitting reaction happens in three categories (Fig. 3A): (1) light absorption with photon energy greater than the band gap energy of the photocatalyst; (2) charge separation, transport, and migration to the catalyst's surface without recombination; (3) surface reactions (oxidation and reduction processes).62 Arguably, the high carrier mobility and shorter diffusion length of the photocatalyst material are the key factors that contribute to an efficient and high-performing water splitting reaction. Nevertheless, the reasons that suppress the charge recombination and excellent overall water splitting always rely on the crystallinity of the photocatalyst material, which is related to the density of defects.63–65 This is ascribed to these defect states acting as the recombination centers between carriers decreasing with greater photocatalyst crystallinity. Reducing the particle size of the photocatalyst shortens the diffusion distance of charge carriers by reducing the particle size and increasing the electric conductivity of the material or forming heterojunctions with other noble metals, remediating charge recombination, thus resulting in higher photocatalytic activity.35,66 Notably, the accumulation of charge carriers at the photocatalyst surface induces recombination, consequently compromising water splitting activity and destabilizing the photocatalyst.67,68 The aforementioned challenges are the crucial issues to be overcome in g-C3N4-based photocatalysis because only 10% of the charge carriers are available for water splitting, while 90% are being recombined. As the solutions to the key scientific challenges, a variety of modification strategies such as band structure engineering, cocatalyst engineering, surface/interface engineering, porous and nanostructure engineering are proposed to improve the visible-light harvesting capability, charge separation, migration, and utilization of the photocatalyst (Scheme 1). In the next section, we discuss how photocatalytic activity can be improved by tuning the structure and electronic properties of a photocatalyst.

3.1 Sacrificial agents and their thermodynamic requirements
Driving photocatalytic water splitting is tough due to its high Gibbs free energy. Relying on the photocatalyst in splitting pure water molecules into H2 is inefficient due to the high energy needed to drive the four-electron reaction. Thus, the employment of reducing sacrificial agents or electron donors is one of the most effective approaches to kick-start the production of H2 from water under light irradiation because an electron donor could scavenge photogenerated holes, thus lowering the likelihood of the backward reaction.69 The role of the sacrificial reagent lies in its ability to simplify the complexity of a four-electron-based photocatalytic reaction to a two-electron version. In such cases, O2 is usually non-producible or in low yield, thus suppressing the undesirable back reaction (reformation of water) and resulting in high H2 yield. Sacrificial reagents can be divided into either organic such as methanol (commonly for TiO2) and triethanolamine (commonly for g-C3N4), or inorganic such as the sodium sulfite mixture (commonly for CdS).70–74
Taking the example of the most commonly employed SED-assisted TiO2 system, it is expected that the methanol-based electron donor reacts irreversibly with the photogenerated holes in the valence band, ascribed to its less positive oxidation potential than H2O, thereby enabling an effective charge carrier separation efficiency and leading to higher quantum efficiency. The photocatalytic oxidation of methanol could be performed through either direct oxidation by photogenerated holes or indirect oxidation by OH radicals. The following reactions of the methanol-TiO2 system (eqn (6)–(16)) are somehow more complicated than the pure water photocatalysis:75 TiO2 + hv → e− + h+(6) H2Oads + h+ → OH*ads + H+ads(7) CH3OHads + OH*ads(h+) → CH3O* + H2Oads(H+ads)(8) CH3OHads + OH−ads → CH3O−ads + H2Oads(9) CH3O* + CH3O−ads + H+ → 2CH2Oads + H+ + e−(10) CH3O*ads + OH*ads(h+) → CH2Oads + H2Oads(H+ads)(11) CH2Oads + OHads(h+) → HCOads + H2Oads(H+ads)(12) HCO*ads + OH*ads → HCOOHads(13) HCOOHads + OH*ads(h+) → *COOHads + H2Oads(H+ads)(14) *COOHads + OH+adsads(h+) → CO2ads + H2Oads(H+adsads)(15) 2H+ads + 2e− → H2(16)
On the other hand, the photochemical reactions of triethanolamine (TEOA) for g-C3N4 are as follows (eqn (17)–(20)):76 C6H15NO3 → C6H15NO+3 + e−(17) C6H15NO+3 → C6H14NO*3 + H+(18) C6H14NO*3 → C6H14NO+3 + e−(19) C6H14NO+3 + H2O → C4H11NO3 + CH3CHO + H+(20)
An intriguing question to ask is whether the H2 evolution process can occur without the addition of SED. The answer could be yes if the splitting condition satisfies the thermodynamic requirement. However, in reality, it is usually tough to thermodynamically kick-start the splitting process of one water molecule into H2 and 1/2O2 due to its high Gibbs free energy (ΔG° = 238 kJ mol−1).77 Thus, the origin of H2 is an interesting topic and should be emphasized. The addition of a sacrificial agent is meant to ease the production of H2 from the sacrificial active species, but it is still accompanied by another issue, where the narrow bandgap photocatalyst suffers from poor efficiency due to kinetic deficiency for the oxidation reaction. The thermo-photo water splitting is thereby introduced to overcome the incapability of visible and infrared-based photocatalysts for charge carrier excitation.78 It is expected that under a high-temperature influence, the kinetic limitation of the photocatalyst can be overcome for oxidation in the presence of SED. In the case of pure water, water molecules could be directly reduced under the influence of both the thermal and photo-effect.79–81 Recently, from the work of Professor Hu's group on H2 production over Rh-loaded TiO2, it was verified that in the presence of a methanol sacrificial agent, the H2 obtained at room temperature was mainly derived from the sacrificial molecules (60% decomposition rate) instead of pure water (40% decomposition rate) because protons produced from both the oxidation of methanol and ionization of water could be reduced to H2. In this case, the sacrificial molecule plays as an active species in triggering the H2 production, instead of the highly stable water. However, a primary challenge of the methanol–water mixture system would be the low photocatalytic efficiency under visible light attributed to the insufficient oxidation driving force. Hence, this group introduced thermal/kinetic energy as the solution to the aforementioned problem and they thus proved that under the influence of the thermo-photo process, H2 could be mainly produced from pure water.79
4. Why does decoration of g-C3N4 matter?
4.1 Constructing composites of g-C3N4
Photocatalyst compositing or heterojunctions have proven to be an effective approach to photocatalytic enhancement; these are usually prepared through in situ growth and ex situ assembly methods (Scheme 2). The in situ method is meant for the formation of 2D materials in the presence of other low-dimensional nanomaterials during hydrothermal, solvothermal, and in situ hydrolysis methods. It has been reported that the in situ loading method is more conducive to rapid charge carrier extraction/separation from semiconductor photocatalyst to cocatalyst, ascribed to the chemical bonding states, which in turn significantly contributes to superior photocatalytic performance.82
 Scheme 2  Photocatalytic approaches through in situ growth and ex situ assembly methods. 
The ex situ assembly approach, on the other hand, implies the combination of a pre-prepared nanomaterial, having a defined structure and composition, with any of the 2D materials through covalent or non-covalent bonding. The advantages of constructing composite photocatalysts or heterojunctions lie in extending the light-response range and promoting efficient charge separation through various carrier transfer pathways; as such, it is regarded as an effective strategy to achieve high H2 evolution activity. In this section, we explicate the roles of cocatalysts and composites/heterojunctions that have contributed to enhanced photocatalytic performances.

4.1.1 Tailoring cocatalysts/charge-trappers. 
Loading an appropriate HER cocatalyst on the g-C3N4 surface could significantly enhance the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity, due to the cocatalyst serving abundant active sites, accelerating charge carrier separation, and reducing energy barriers for the target reaction (Scheme 3).83–85 Taking into account the reasons (facile recombination of charges and slow surface reaction to consume charges) that cause low H2 evolution performance of most semiconductors in the absence of a cocatalyst, the loading of noble metals (Pt, Pd, Au, or Rh), metal oxides (RuO2 and IrO2) and abundant alternatives (Co-Pi, NiOx, CoOx) as cocatalysts have been verified to be effective methods to suppress charge carrier recombination because they act as trapping sites for photogenerated charges. Moreover, they provide effective proton reduction sites, which significantly improve the proton reduction reaction.40,86–89 Generally, the trapping ability of a cocatalyst is dependent on its work function. A larger work function (lower Fermi level) noble metal such as Pt, usually is the best electrons trapper.
 Scheme 3  The types of cocatalysts and their advantages for surface/interface design. 
Proton reduction goes through a discharge and a catalytic step. A volcano relationship between the H2 evolution exchange current and the M–H bond strength (M stands for transitional metal) was described; according to Trasatti, Pt was on the volcano peak, indicative of the lowest activation energy for H2 evolution.40,90 Although noble metals, typically Pt, have been classified as the most efficient H2 evolution cocatalysts, it has been reported that the atom efficiency has restrained its wide application because only surface active-site atoms participate in most developed noble metal cocatalyst systems.91–93 Recently, the development of single-atom metals and water-soluble molecules, as a new cocatalyst concept was highlighted and more importantly, this new system performed well as an efficient cocatalyst for 2D-based photocatalysis.
Noble metals. 
An isolated single Pt atom (novel cocatalyst) anchored on g-C3N4 formed Pt-CN with high dispersion and stability was reported by Li and co-workers. This new and highly efficient photocatalytic system can maximize the utilization of Pt atoms, leading to remarkable photocatalytic H2 evolution activity enhancement. It is worth mentioning that the formation of rich Pt-N/C bonds resulting from the reaction of tri-s-triazine units in C3N4 and H2PtCl6 led to the relatively low-temperature synthesis of the single-atom Pt-CN system with high stability.92 The role of single-atom Pt as the cocatalyst (less than 0.38 wt%) was revealed when Pt-CN exhibited a 50 times higher H2 generation rate of 318 μmol h−1 as compared to the bare g-C3N4 (6.5 μmol h−1), as depicted in Fig. 5A. Note that the loading amount of Pt used in this case is extremely important to ensure excellent photocatalytic performance because Pt clusters were formed at high Pt concentration (exceeded 0.38 wt%), as shown in Fig. 5B, which compromises the photocatalytic activity. In terms of stability, the turnover frequency (TOF) of Pt-CN at a Pt loading of 0.16 wt% (775 h−1) is significantly higher as compared to Pt-NPs-CN, which implies that the maximum atom efficiency of the single-atom cocatalyst boosted the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. Moreover, the incorporation of isolated single Pt atoms merits the charge separation, with an average recovery lifetime of 433 ± 38 ps for the Pt-CN, while 237 ± 9 ps for the g-C3N4 (Fig. 5C and D). This suggests that the near band-edge electron trap states of g-C3N4 modified by isolated single Pt atoms offer more opportunities for photogenerated electrons to participate in the H+ reduction.92 The incorporation of a single-atom cocatalyst in the g-C3N4 matrix provides a new strategy for modulating the electronic structure, which could dramatically improve the photocatalytic activity.

Non-metal and metal oxides. 
Considering the cost factor and scarcity for practical application, the focus has steered towards the search for novel inexpensive materials and efficient cocatalysts such as Fe,82,94 Co,82,95 Ni,82,96 Cu.82,97 The role of the cocatalyst was further amplified when Fu et al. designed amorphous NiO as a cocatalyst. They reported that the introduction of NiO as a cocatalyst (ECB = −0.5 V vs. RHE) separated electron–hole pairs and promoted photo-induced electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of NiO, unlike the bare g-C3N4 where they (electron–hole pairs) usually recombine immediately.98Fig. 5G shows the schematic illustration of the band energy level and charge transfer of the NiO/g-C3N4/3/300 photocatalyst. The overall water splitting of the NiO/g-C3N4/3/300 photocatalyst passes a two-electron pathway, in which electrons in the CB of NiO reduce H+ to H2, while holes in the VB of g-C3N4 oxidized H2O to H2O2 and NiO decomposed the produced H2O2 into H2O and O2. Apart from efficient charge carrier separation (due to the NiO cocatalyst), the loading of an appropriate content of NiO decomposed H2O2 generated by g-C3N4, thus resulting in high photocatalytic activity (Fig. 5E), stability, and reusability (Fig. 5F).99 Otherwise, aggregation may occur at a higher NiO content, thus compromising the charge transportability.
Transition metal phosphides. 
The employment of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) as cocatalysts, such as CoP, FeP, Ni2P, etc., has recently received considerable attention, ascribed to their intriguing metallic characteristics and superior electrical conductivity for noble-metal free photoactivity.100 The CoP/g-C3N4 photocatalyst system was introduced in 2017 by incorporating CoP nanodots on the g-C3N4 surface. The synthesized photocatalyst rendered a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate about 480 and 3-fold higher than g-C3N4 (0.2 μmol h−1) and Pt/g-C3N4 (32.3 μmol h−1), respectively (Fig. 6A). This work has demonstrated the positive effect of CoP as a cocatalyst, where it provides abundant dual active sites with the formation of the P(δ−)–Co(δ+)–N(δ−) surface bonding state. The CoP cocatalyst also broadens the visible light harvesting range, lifts the CB position, and improves the charge carrier separation efficiency. Fig. 6B shows the quenched PL spectra of CoP-decorated g-C3N4, which indicates the suppression of electron–hole recombination, credited to the rapid electron transfer from g-C3N4 to CoP through Co(δ+)–N(δ−) bonds. The stability effect of CoP nanodots was also highlighted in this work. Apart from the excellent H2 evolution cycles (no obvious decrease in the H2 evolution rate after five cycles for 20 h, Fig. 6C), the XPS peak of P 2p (Fig. 6G) at 132.8 eV disappeared after 10 h photoreaction, implying the removal of surface-oxidized PO43− species. Hence, it was ascertained that CoP can potentially replace the Pt (proven by the photocatalytic performance) due to its cost-effectiveness and abundance in nature. The XPS spectra of N 1s, Co 2p, and P 2p are shown in Fig. 6D–F. CoP behaves as a bridging element to promote charge transfer (reduce charge recombination), consequently boosting the photocatalytic performance.8 Using Ni precursors, tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP), and g-C3N4 NS in oleylamine (OAm) as raw materials, Wen et al. synthesized the Ni2P/g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalyst via an in situ co-heating approach, which displayed the superior photocatalytic H2 production rate of 2849.5 μmol g−1 h−1 and excellent durability (Fig. 6H). This was due to the uniqueness of Ni(δ+)–N(δ−) chemical coupling between Ni2P and g-C3N4 in the Ni2P/g-C3N4 hybrid heterojunction that accelerated the photogenerated electron–hole pair separation, subsequently reducing protons into H2, and thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance. The intimate contact between the Ni2P and g-C3N4 interface was confirmed through TEM as shown in Fig. 6J. Comparatively, the compromised photocatalytic performance of the bulk g-C3N4 (228.5 μmol g−1 h−1) is attributed to an agglomeration of the parent bulk g-C3N4 with sizes of several micrometers, which was proven through the SEM image in Fig. 6K. The efficient charge carrier separation and fast interfacial charge transfer were also further verified through the transient current of the Ni2P/g-C3N4 hybrid composite, as shown in Fig. 6I, which implies reduced charge recombination.101 Similarly, the g-C3N4/Ni–P composites reported by Qi et al. also exhibited a high H2 evolution activity of 1051 μmol h−1 g−1 over g-C3N4/Ni–Pt (841 μmol h−1 g−1) due to Ni–P NPs promoting electron transfer and accelerating the separation of electron–hole pairs, thus reducing charge recombination.98,102 When the porous carnation-like superstructure of Ni5P4 (cocatalyst) was incorporated into g-C3N4, the formation of the g-C3N4/Ni5P4 Schottky junction rendered much higher photocatalytic performance (1157.5 μmol h−1 g−1) than the corresponding reference cocatalysts such as Ni2P and NiS2, attributed to abundant active sites and efficient charge transport channels.103,104

Typically, FeP exhibits a comparable catalytic mechanism to the highly active [FeFe]-hydrogenases and is therefore a promising and inexpensive metallic compound for large-scale H2 production.105 In 2017, Zhao and co-workers, the first group to introduce FexP cocatalysts into the g-C3N4 systems, formed FexP/g-C3N4 nanostructures through the phosphidation method. In this work, they explicated that FeP behaves as an effective cocatalyst in g-C3N4 systems, in which FexP/g-C3N4 hybrid nanostructures boosted the visible-light-driven H2 evolution against the pristine g-C3N4. Impressively, the superiority of FexP was further emphasized and revealed when g-C3N4/FexP-0.08 exhibited comparable photocatalytic performance to that of g-C3N4/Pt-0.12 when tested under the same experimental conditions, thus implying its suitability to replace the expensive and scare Pt.106 The FexP-doped photocatalyst outperformed the Pt-doped and pristine g-C3N4 due to the intimate contact between FexP and g-C3N4, which resulted in the easy transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of g-C3N4 to the FexP cocatalyst surface for H2O reduction.106 In 2019, Zeng et al. designed a gas-phase phosphorization method to prepare sub-5 nm ultrafine FeP nanodots-modified porous g-C3N4 heterojunction nanostructures, employing NaH2PO2 as the P source and Fe3O4/g-C3N4 as the precursor (Fig. 7A). The 0D FeP nanodots-modified g-C3N4 exhibited excellent HER activity even in the absence of Pt (Fig. 7B), with an apparent quantum yield of 1.57% at 420 nm and effective interfacial charge transfer due to the excellent spatial charge separation at the interface of the heterojunction and retarded charge recombination.107 DFT was performed to determine the potential of FeP as a cocatalyst by calculating the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*). FeP as a sole semiconductor is unfavorable for the HER because of its facile product desorption (ΔGH* = 0.17 eV).108 However, when FeP was chemically coupled to g-C3N4, it exhibited a mediated adsorption–desorption behavior (ΔGH* = −0.09 eV), which facilitated the HER kinetics. More importantly, this ΔGH* value is nearly comparable to Pt (Fig. 7C).107 These studies indicated that FeP as the cocatalyst speeds up electron separation and transfer, enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, the developed FexP nanoparticles were found to be aggregated, and thus reduced the exposed active sites.

Apart from the empowering TMP, other transition metal-based compounds, e.g., tungsten compounds, which exhibit electronic structures similar to the precious Pt, have also been classified as active HER catalysts with the potential to replace Pt. Shao et al. prepared tungsten compounds (W2C, W2N, and WS2) via a modified urea-glass process.109–111 They conclusively revealed that W2C is a potential and competitive cocatalyst for promoting the photocatalytic reaction, thanks to the strong electronic coupling (strong interactions between tungsten and g-C3N4), which resulted in superior photocatalytic activity as compared to the pristine g-C3N4 (Fig. 7D). The effectiveness of tungsten compounds as cocatalysts in promoting photoinduced carrier separation in g-C3N4 was further demonstrated in PL and EIS analyses, with the quenched PL peak (Fig. 7E) and smaller semicircle diameters (Fig. 7F) of the tungsten-based compound as compared to the pristine, thus implying the suppression of carrier recombination and prompting excellent carrier transport. Similarly, transition metal sulfides are also the perfect ingredients as the cocatalysts in photocatalysis reactions. Zhao et al., utilized (NH4)2[MoS4] as the source of MoS2 to prepare MoS2-modified g-C3N4 (g-C3N4/MoS2) hybrid photocatalysts through a facile in situ light-assisted method. The doping of an optimum amount of MoS2 (2.89% in this case) has prompted the high H2 evolution rate of 252 μmol g−1 h−1. In this study, the key factor for excellent photocatalytic activity lies in the amount of MoS2, in which overloaded MoS2 compromises its photocatalytic activity owing to the reduction of oxidation reaction sites on the g-C3N4 surface.112–114 It was expected that the addition of MoS2 would enable the photogenerated electrons at the CB to be transferred from g-C3N4 to MoS2 with ease due to the unsaturated active S atoms excited on the exposed edges of MoS2 forming strong bonds to H+ in the solution. Hence, the trapped electrons at MoS2 reduce the bonded H+ for the generation of H2. In addition, copper sulfide (Cu7S4) is regarded as a feasible cocatalyst due to its narrow band gap, low cost, and abundant properties. A ternary heterostructure composed of CdS, Cu7S4, and g-C3N4 was fabricated through ion exchange between CdS and Cu+, followed by the ultrasonication-assisted self-assembly of CdS/Cu7S4 and g-C3N4. This photocatalyst provides excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution in the absence of a noble metal cocatalyst.115,116 The performances of cocatalyst-based photocatalytic systems are displayed in Table 2.

MXenes. 
Due to the uniqueness of 2D materials from the aspect of electronic structure, MXenes are also perfect electron acceptors or cocatalysts for a composite photocatalyst. They are a new family of 2D early transition metal carbides/carbonitrides that, in theory, exhibit near-zero Gibbs free energy for H2 adsorption (ΔGH), indicating that MXenes are effective electrocatalysts for the H2 evolution reaction.117–119 The emergence of these 2D transition-metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides have attracted great attention within the research communities due to their vast fascinating properties which include the following:
(i) high electrical and metallic conductivities of 6000–8000 S cm−1, which account for efficient charge carrier transfer;
(ii) hydrophilic nature (the presence of –OH and –O) that promotes excellent bonding with various semiconductors and strong interaction with water molecules;
(iii) excellent oxidation resistance and redox reactivity due to the exposure of terminal metal sites of Ti, Nb, or V, etc.;
(iv) the large surface area and easily tunable structure have favored their diverse applications such as in energy storage and photocatalysis.120–123
MXene, with its general formula of Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3), where M refers to an early transition metal, Sc, Ti, Zr, Mo, etc., X represents carbon/nitrogen, and Tx represents the surface terminations such as hydroxyl, oxygen or fluorine, generally produced by selectively etching the ‘A’ elements by a wet chemical process in HF or HF-forming etchants from the MAX phases (Mn+1AXn (n = 1, 2, 3)).123 M represents early d-block transition metals (mostly group 13 and 14 elements), A is the main group sp elements, and X represents carbon and/or nitrogen.124 The detailed synthesis process of MXene via selective HF etching and surface functionalization with OH or F termination is demonstrated below: Mn+1AXn + 3HF → AlF3 + Mn+1Xn + 1.5H2(21) Mn+1Xn + 2H2O → Mn+1Xn(OH)2 + H2(22) Mn+1Xn + 2HF → Mn+1XnF2 + H2(23)
At the initial stage, the HF etchant etches the A element from the Mn+1AXn phase (eqn (21)), followed by surface functionalization with O, OH, and F terminations, thus forming the multilayer Mn+1XnTx (Fig. 8A), as shown in eqn (22) and (23). Surface functionalization with T elements is influenced by the electrophilic property of the metal, while M affects the physicochemical properties of the MXene.125 Subsequently, the multilayer MXene flakes are exfoliated to single- or few-layered MXenes through sonication with DMSO and isopropanol (the most effective means of polar intercalating organic molecules), thus forming a colloidal suspension of layered MXene. The SEM images of MXenes are presented in Fig. 8B–F.

When MXenes are coupled with a semiconductor, the Schottky barrier at the MXene/semiconductor interface acts as the electron reservoir, which facilitates the photoinduced electron and hole separation.119,126 However, to date, owing to the metallic properties of MXenes such as Ti2C and Ti3C2, they act as electron acceptors to capture the photoelectrons generated by g-C3N4, but not as an effective photocatalyst. The effectiveness of 2D Ti2C as a cocatalyst was demonstrated when the 2D Ti2C loading was up to 0.4 wt% (TiCN-0.4), achieving the highest H2 production rate of 47.5 μmol h−1, which is 14.4 times higher as compared to the pure g-C3N4 (3.3 μmol h−1).127 Zhang et al. proposed the band structure of the partially oxidized delaminated Ti3C2, as illustrated in Fig. 8G and B, showing that the partially oxidized delaminated Ti3C2 is not appropriate for H2 evolution due to the conduction band bottom of delaminated Ti3C2 (dm-350-1) being lower than the oxidation potential of H2/H2O, and the photocatalytic activity of pure g-C3N4 is severely restricted by the low charge separation efficiency. The synergism between the partially oxidized Ti3C2 and g-C3N4 has enabled the excitation of electrons from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of partially oxidized d-Ti3C2 (toward the more negative potential) under visible light, while the holes were transferred from the VB of partially oxidized d-Ti3C2 to the VB of g-C3N4.128 This effect thus suggested that the delaminated Ti3C2 is a fast charge carrier transfer channel that is beneficial to photocatalytic activity. The role of Ti3C2 as an effective electron acceptor was also magnified through the high photocurrent intensity of 3.0 wt% Ti3C2/B-g-C3N4 (3-TC/CN) as compared to the pristine g-C3N4 upon light irradiation (Fig. 8I). This work reported by Su and co-workers has evidenced excellent interfacial charge transfer within the ultrathin 2D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 nanosheets, which was also verified through the smaller arc radius of 3-TC/CN in the Nyquist plot of Fig. 8J. It was expected that the transfer of photogenerated electrons to the Ti3C2 flakes from the g-C3N4 instead of the defect states would be highly feasible due to the high electrical conductivity of the metallic Ti3C2. The pristine g-C3N4 nanosheets exhibited a very low hydrogen evolution rate of 7.1 μmol h−1 gcat−1 due to low charge separation efficiency.119,128 With the addition of 1.0 wt% Ti3C2 flakes, the photocatalytic activity of 1-TC/CN was gradually improved to 25.8 μmol h−1 gcat−1 and achieved the highest hydrogen production rate of 72.3 μmol h−1 gcat−1 when 3.0 wt% Ti3C2 flakes were added (Fig. 8K). Comparatively, the 3.0 wt% MWNTs/g-C3N4 and 1.0 wt% Pt/g-C3N4 exhibited low photocatalytic activities of 64.1 μmol h−1 gcat−1 and 20.3 μmol h−1 gcat−1 under visible light (>400 nm), thus reaffirming the role of Ti3C2 as an efficient cocatalyst at low concentration. Increasing the concentration of Ti3C2 has no positive effect on photocatalytic activity, as compared to the 3.0 wt% Pt/g-C3N4 (175.6 μmol h−1 gcat−1) under the same experimental conditions. The performance of the Pt cocatalyst in this case (3 wt%) could be credited to its effective trapping sites to suppress charge recombination. In contrast, at a high concentration, the MXene layer induced agglomeration, which resulted in severe charge recombination. Thus far, there are still only a few reports on MXene photocatalysts, and MXene cocatalysts in g-C3N4.
To further verify the role of MXenes as effective cocatalysts for photocatalytic activity, instead of being a photocatalyst, the incorporation of MXene within other 2D semiconductors is also discussed in this section. Thus far, there have been no reports on MXene, Ti3C2 nanoparticles as the sole photocatalyst because Ti3C2 nanoparticles show zero activity towards H2 production under visible light irradiation, thus conclusively emphasizing that Ti3C2 is an excellent cocatalyst rather than a photocatalyst.126
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to evaluate the potential of the Ti3C2 MXene as a cocatalyst. Ti3C2 was integrated into CdS through a hydrothermal strategy, in which the Ti3C2 nanoparticles were first introduced into a Cd(Ac)2 aqueous solution for the adsorption of Cd2+ cations on numerous –O terminations, followed by the addition of thiourea (an organic sulfur source that coordinated with Cd2+ to the suspension). During the hydrothermal process, the –F terminations were replaced by –O or –OH terminations. The decomposition of thiourea molecules released S2− anions into solution and combined with the Cd2+ cations adsorbed on the Ti3C2 nanoparticles surface, which resulted in the formation of cauliflower-structured CdS/Ti3C2 sub-microspheres (Fig. 9A and B). The role of Ti3C2 as a cocatalyst was unraveled when a superb high photocatalytic H2 production activity of 14342 μmol g−1 h−1 was recorded for CdS/Ti3C2 (CT2.5; the nominal mass ratio of Ti3C2 to CdS is 2.5 wt%), exceeding that of CT0 by 136.6-fold. Impressively, the photocatalytic activity of CT2.5 even outperformed the 2.5 wt% Pt-loaded CdS sub-microsphere (10978 μmol g−1 h−1), which implies its suitability to replace the usage of the high-cost Pt cocatalyst for H2 production. The effectiveness of Ti3C2 as a cocatalyst was further revealed when 2.5 wt% NiS, Ni, and MoS2-loaded CdS sub-microsphere under the same experimental conditions displayed comparatively lower photocatalytic activities as compared to the CT2.5 (Fig. 9C), credited to the strong bonding between CdS and Ti3C2, which enhanced the rapid interfacial charge transfer and charge recombination suppression (verified through PL lifetime in Fig. 9D).97,126,129

In 2019, Xiao et al. verified that the incorporation of a trace amount of Ti3C2 MXene (in their case is 20 mg) into 1D CdS (denoted as CM-20) substantially improved the H2 evolution performance (Fig. 9E), credited to its improved charge transfer rate and smaller charge transfer resistance, as evidenced in the EIS Nyquist plot of Fig. 9F.130 Interestingly, Ti3C2, which is an electron trapper and shuttling site, suppressed the charge recombination on the CdS surface. It also promoted the separation and transfer of charges in the CdS bulk. Ran et al. proposed the H2 evolution mechanism of the CdS/Ti3C2 system under illumination by visible light. They disclosed that the close contact of CdS and Ti3C2 induced a more negative original Fermi energy (EF) of n-type CdS as compared to the O-terminated Ti3C2 (1.88 V versus SHE), which eased the electron transfer from CdS to Ti3C2 through the Schottky junction. Generally, a Schottky junction performs as an electron trapper to capture and transfer electrons from the CB of CdS to the EF of Ti3C2 through an upward CB band, while immobilized photoinduced holes remain in the CdS VB regime, which forms the space charge layer, as observed in Fig. 9G and H.40,126,131,132 The excellent metallic conductivity of Ti3C2 rapidly shuttled electrons to the Ti3C2 surface; hence, the effectiveness of protons being reduced by the photoinduced electrons at the –O terminations on Ti3C2 in aqueous solution reflects the potential role of Ti3C2 for H2 production. The versatility of Ti3C2 as a cocatalyst was further exploited when a p-type semiconductor NiS was simultaneously loaded with Ti3C2 on the CdS sub-microspheres because the synergism between the p-type NiS and the n-type CdS formed a p–n junction to promote photoinduced hole transfer from CdS to NiS.126 These findings, therefore, open new prospects for the application of low-cost MXenes as efficient cocatalysts for H2 production, as well as substitutes for the costly Pt cocatalyst.


4.1.2 Tailoring heterojunctions. 
Compositing g-C3N4 with other semiconductor materials has demonstrated satisfactory H2 evolution activity ascribed to its effectiveness for the spatial separation of charge carriers (electron–hole pairs), consequently suppressing their recombination.141Scheme 4 depicts that coupling a photocatalyst with other dimensional materials for the formation of heterojunctions offers an efficient approach towards photocatalysis efficacy. To design a semiconductor heterojunction, the matching of the lattice and electronic structure between the 2D composite photocatalysts should be considered for the excellent separation of charge carriers.142 Therefore, it is essential to understand the type of junctions used in photocatalysis, which include Type-I and II heterojunctions and the Z-schemes.
 Scheme 4  Pictorial representations of heterojunctions composed of various dimensionalities and their advantages. 
Type-I and -II heterojunctions. 
The type-I heterojunction comprises two semiconductors with straddling alignment, whereby semiconductor 1 has a higher CB position than that of semiconductor 2, while the VB of semiconductor 1 is lower than semiconductor 2, which resulted in an accumulation of electrons and holes on the semiconductor 2 (Fig. 10A).144 A typical 2D ternary metal sulfide (cubic CaIn2S4) was composited to g-C3N4 and this type-I heterojunction nanocomposite (CaIn2S4/g-C3N4) rendered a superior photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 102 μmol g−1 h−1, superior to the pristine CaIn2S4 (30 μmol g−1 h−1) and g-C3N4 (Fig. 11D) due to the close interfacial contact of the 2D heterostructure. Fig. 11C shows that the as-prepared CaIn2S4 nanoplates (Fig. 11B) were dispersed and anchored across the g-C3N4 irregular nanosheets (Fig. 11A), which resulted in improved specific surface area and gave rise to ample reactive sites that performed as charge trappers and for reactant adsorption. This work has demonstrated that the 2D nanostructure architecture merits the charge separation, which is proven through PL (the PL emission intensity was markedly reduced; Fig. 11E). In comparison, the pristine g-C3N4 exhibited strong emission from 430–500 nm, corresponding to the band gap carrier recombination.133,145 This work provides new insights into the design of 2D heterojunction photocatalysts for an efficient water-splitting reaction.

Tin sulfide (SnS2) as a visible-light active photocatalyst with a narrow band gap of 2.5 eV, unique electronic structure, and tunable optical properties has exhibited poor photocatalytic activity due to the fast recombination of charge carriers. When SnS2 is hybridized to g-C3N4, the formation of the SnS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction has resulted in photocatalytic improvement, which could be on account of efficient charge separation and transfer between the interface of g-C3N4 and SnS2.146–149 However, one major disadvantage of the type-I heterojunction would be that this heterojunction yields no improvement in charge carrier separation owing to the accumulation of charge carriers on a single semiconductor.150 A type-II heterojunction with straddling band structure exhibits a different charge transfer mechanism, as shown in Fig. 10B. The photoexcited electrons transfer from a more negative CB position of semiconductor 1 to semiconductor 2, while holes transfer from a more positive VB of semiconductor 2 to semiconductor 1, thus resulting in efficient spatial charge separation and significantly reduced electron–hole pair recombination.144 The concept of the spatial accumulation of charge carriers is also applicable even when the energy is only capable of exciting a single semiconductor and the other semiconductor serves as an electron/hole acceptor.143 For instance, a type-II g-C3N4/SiC heterostructure prepared through an in situ thermal process exhibited high stability and superior H2 production activity (182 μmol g−1 h−1) as compared to that of the g-C3N4 (54 μmol g−1 h−1) or SiC. These improvements are ascribed to the strong interaction between g-C3N4 and the SiC heterojunction, thereby ensuring smooth charge separation and transfer across the interfaces of both semiconductors for their respective reactions.151,152 This indicates the importance of contact types between two components with different dimensions (Scheme 3) for maximizing the exposure of the nanosheets' active sites. The formation of the 2D/2D heterojunction has drawn immense attention to date owing to its unique structure that renders a larger contact interface between both adjacent sheets.153–160 For example, the hexagonal ZnIn2S4 phase of the ternary chalcogenide family has attracted immense research interest due to its 2D layered structure, a suitable band gap of 2.4–2.7 eV, and excellent visible-light harvesting ability.161,162 An unmodified ZnIn2S4 rendered poor photocatalytic efficiency due to rapid recombination, but an improved photocatalytic activity was observed upon the formation of the ZnxCd1−xIn2S4 solid solution, suggesting that the formation of the solid solution mitigated the charge transfer resistance. In this case, Cd2+ serves as an electron trap center that could promote charge separation and migration, ultimately achieving desirable photocatalytic performance.163 When ZnxCd1−xIn2S4 nanosheets were deposited in situ on g-C3N4, this unique 2D/2D heterojunction formed numerous interfacial charge transfer channels that were expected to shorten the diffusion distances of charge carriers from the bulk to the surface and finally promote efficient charge separation and transfer.164 Switching to the case of carbon-based materials, with the introduction of graphene oxide (GO) thin film into the g-C3N4 quantum dots and MoS2 framework (MoS2/g-C3N4/GO), it is surprising that the appropriate band alignment of the designed MoS2/g-C3N4 heterostructure enhanced the spatial charge separation at the binary interface, thereafter facilitating the collection of electrons in the vicinity of MoS2 and holes in the g-C3N4. The photocatalytic performance was then substantially improved when the GO thin film was added because GO is an excellent carrier transferring channel that facilitates the transportation of holes from g-C3N4.165 Apart from compositing and altering dimensionality strategies, vacancy defects in materials play a critical role in the manipulation of the electronic structure and properties of charge carriers by introducing additional energy levels.166,167 Hao et al. reported the ZnS/g-C3N4 heterostructure (in short denoted as CVZ20) with abundant zinc vacancy defects. The coupling of g-C3N4 and ZnS created space charge accumulation/depletion at the interfaces that enhanced charge separation. Moreover, the creation of Zn vacancies on ZnS induced a defect energy level in the middle of the ZnS band gap, which performed as a charge acceptor for charge carrier separation (Fig. 12).141,168–170 More examples are provided in Table 2. In brief, a type-II heterojunction brought efficient electron–hole separation and transfer to their respective sites for reduction and oxidation processes, thereby remarkably improving the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposites. Nevertheless, one issue of the type-II heterojunction is that the redox power of the photoexcited electrons and holes on reaction sites is compromised.171,172

Z-scheme heterojunctions. 
An artificial Z-scheme system that mimics the photosynthesis process of green plants comprises two connected semiconductor photocatalysts that keep electrons and holes with stronger reduction and oxidation capabilities on their respective sites.173 The first generation Z-scheme photocatalytic system (liquid-based Z-scheme) is composed of two different semiconductors combined using a redox mediator without any physical contact.141,174,175 However, this conventional Z-scheme system is only well-performing in the liquid phase, thus restraining its application in photocatalytic water splitting.171,175–177 Therefore, an all-solid-state Z-scheme system was introduced (Fig. 10C), in which an electron solid (Au, Ag, Cu NPs, etc.) conductor that performs as an electron mediator is inserted between the semiconductors. The advantages of this system as compared to the conventional lie in its low contact resistance and suppressed backward reaction, but it is further impeded by the use of expensive noble metals and its shielding effect.176,178–180 As such, a mediator-free Z-scheme system would be the best option because both the semiconductors are intimately contacted without any bridging mediators. This direct Z-scheme system could efficiently suppress the backward reaction and shielding effect. Principally, the photogenerated electrons in semiconductor 2 with a lower CB level migrated and recombined with the holes in the VB of semiconductor 1, as shown in Fig. 10D. The direct Z-scheme and Type-II heterojunction possess an almost similar band structure but differ in their charge transfer pathway. Thus, confirmation methods by using photoluminescence spectra and transient time-resolved PL decay measurements should be performed to differentiate the direct Z-scheme from the other heterojunction systems.173,181–183
In 2019, Li et al. successfully developed a novel hollow PCN/PANI/BTO (PPB) ternary photocatalyst by combining P-doped g-C3N4 (PCN), polyaniline (PANI), and ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) via wet-chemical and thermal treatment strategies (Fig. 13A). The corresponding TEM image of PPB is illustrated in Fig. 13B. Compared with the pristine g-C3N4, this as-prepared PBB exhibited excellent photocatalytic H2 production activity (Fig. 13C and D). The PL intensity of PPB as observed in Fig. 13E was lower as compared to its counterparts, implying an efficient interfacial electron transfer pathway in this ternary heterojunction.184 Although ternary compositing could contribute to efficiency, it is a challenge to ensure synergistic interaction between all semiconductors. Additionally, the synthesis process of these composites is tedious and complex.

A 2D/2D architecture possesses a large interfacial area between the face-to-face contact nanosheets where this feature contributes to efficient charge separation and reduces the probability of charge recombination.157,185 In 2019, a direct Z-scheme based on 2D/2D hybrid nanomaterial was synthesized by post-annealing atomically ultrathin Pt-loaded g-C3N4 nanosheets (Pt-CN NSs) with a thickness of ∼4.0 nm and hydrogen-treated WO3 nanosheets (HWO NSs) with a thickness of ∼2.6 nm. This hybrid nanomaterial, denoted as Pt-CN/HWO, exhibited strong affinity and a synergistic coupling effect between the nanosheets, thus giving rise to strong electronic interactions and efficient charge separation, which led to excellent H2 generation of 862 μmol h−1. The intimate 2D/2D contacts in this composite and the formation of W–N bonds in the Pt-CN/HWO composite, which serve as a bridge to speed up charge transfer efficiency, are also contributing factors towards a desirable photocatalytic performance.186–188 It is appealing that the co-facial stacking between 2D/2D nanosheets promotes efficient charge transfer between the interfaces of the 2D van der Waals heterostructures.189 With these advantages, Yang et al. developed a direct Z-scheme van der Waals system composed of ultrathin WO3·H2O nanosheets as the O2 production photocatalyst and g-C3N4 nanosheets as the H2 photocatalyst to achieve an efficient overall water splitting reaction. In this context, it is expected that this van der Waals Z-scheme system accelerates charge carrier transportation and promotes overall water splitting without the need for any sacrificial agents.189,190 From the Nyquist plot (Fig. 14A), the smaller diameter of the WO3·H2O/g-C3N4 signifies a more efficient charge transfer, which is also credited to an appropriate energy band structure of the WO3·H2O/g-C3N4 Z-scheme heterojunction (Fig. 14B).191 Recently, Wang and co-workers successfully designed a new photocatalytic material based on a dual Z-scheme α-Fe2O3@MnO2/g-C3N4 ternary composite for photocatalytic water splitting.192 The synthesized photocatalyst with porous nanocube structure (Fig. 14C) was expected to provide abundant channels for charge transportation and fast redox reaction kinetics. Very low hydrogen and oxygen yields of pristine g-C3N4 photocatalyst were substantially improved when 20 wt% Fe2O3@MnO2 was loaded, accompanied by an optimal apparent quantum efficiency and STH of ca. 2.6% and 0.16%, respectively.193 Further increasing the amount of Fe2O3@MnO2 to 30 wt% may cause a severe shielding effect because the core–shell nanocubes are filled with g-C3N4 nanosheets, which resulted in the clogging of active sites. Apart from ample available reactive sites on the photocatalysts, the stark photocatalytic improvement of α-Fe2O3@MnO2/g-C3N4 was also attributed to the efficient generation and separation of charge carriers that occurred within this dual Z-scheme photocatalyst system. As shown in Fig. 14D, the dual Z-schematic route commenced when electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 responded to H2 production and the holes at the VB of g-C3N4 were rapidly captured and neutralized by the electrons from the CB of both Fe2O3 and MnO2. The holes in the VB of MnO2 could be easily transferred to Fe2O3 and further oxidized the adsorbed OH−/H2O for the O2 oxidation reaction.12,194,195 In summary, this work provides new insight into engineering highly efficient g-C3N4-based Z-scheme photocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting systems.192

4.1.3 Elemental doping. 
Heteroatom doping in the form of metal, non-metal, or co-doping is viable for modifying the electrical and optical properties of g-C3N4 from the atomic to the molecular level by tuning the band structure, narrowing the optical band gaps, and improving charge transport. In general, an impurity atom could occupy positions at substitutional and interstitial sites (Scheme 5). Substitutional doping replaces an atom of the host metal with a foreign atom; in interstitial doping, the foreign atom (usually light elements) occupies the interstitial sites.216,217 Generally, the incorporation of an element into the interstitial sites in the case of g-C3N4 could also be regarded as cave or interlayer doping, which narrows the band gap and elevates the CB edge position. When a half-filled doping level occurs in the interstitial structure, the semi-metallic properties of g-C3N4 lead to enhanced conductive ability.218 Doping a cation into the g-C3N4 plane induces two kinds of doping, namely cave doping and interlayer doping. Cave doping (Fig. 15A) incorporates metal ions (Mn+) such as transition metal ions, noble metal atoms, and alkali-metal ions into the large caves composed of triangular pores between the connected triazine structures in the plane of g-C3N4 through strong coordination interactions and negatively charged nitrogen atoms. Reports have shown that the cave doping of Pt and Pd atoms improve the carrier mobility, narrow the band gap, and enhance light absorption, while the alkali-metal ions (Li+, Na+, and K+) induce non-uniform spatial charge distribution in different intercalated regions, increase free carrier concentration, and improve charge separation and transport.22 Tan et al. demonstrated that doping Li-metal ions narrows the band gap of g-C3N4, consequently speeding up the charge transfer.219 Na+ is also a cave doping atom that is responsible for increasing in-planar electron density and widening the visible-light absorption of g-C3N4; however, the high charge carrier recombination rate in the g-C3N4 planes still impedes high photocatalytic performance.220 Cave doping K+ atoms has decreased the VB level of g-C3N4, thus enhancing charge separation and migration under visible light irradiation. Similarly, employing K atoms as the interlayer dopant renders improved visible light-harvesting, efficient charge separation, and strong oxidation capability because the insertion of K atoms between the two adjacent g-C3N4 layers (Fig. 15B) narrows the band gap, extends conjugated systems, and positively shifts the VB position.22,220

Non-metal doping with elements such as S, P, B, O, C, and I could be realized at the substitutional sites of g-C3N4 to modify the texture/surface chemical properties and electronic structure of g-C3N4.27,221–226 It was expected that these elements would promote delocalization of the Π-conjugated electrons, giving rise to enhanced conductivity, mobility, and charge carrier separation. For instance, C self-doping substitutes for the bridging N atoms, while S, I, and O doping atoms could replace the N atoms in the aromatic triazine rings or occupy the interstitial sites.227 The substitutional doping of P and B atoms preferentially occurred on C atoms or occupied the interstitial sites of in-planar g-C3N4. Taking the substitutional case, Fig. 16A shows that when a C atom of g-C3N4 is replaced by a P atom, P+ centers are formed, which act as strong Lewis acid sites in the form of amine or imine groups in g-C3N4 due to the intrinsic polarization of the P–N bond and delocalization of extra lone electrons in the electron-rich P atom favouring the fast separation of photogenerated excitons.228 In 2018, Liu and co-workers successfully synthesized P-doped g-C3N4 nanotubes through a one-step thermal reaction of melamine and sodium hypophosphite monohydrate, in which the interstitially P-doped g-C3N4 nanotubes featured unique mesoporous structures, large surface areas, and abundant negative and amino-rich surfaces that enhanced proton adsorption.229 A porous ultrathin C/O-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets was developed by the protonation of melamine with inorganic acids via self-assembly, followed by thermal polymerization (Fig. 16B). Theoretical calculations showed that C-doping favors the formation of delocalized Π bonding and improved bulk conductivity. In the case of O-doping, it imparted the original g-C3N4 matrix with a stronger electronic polarization effect, shortened the bond lengths by ∼0.02 Å between the dopant and the neighboring C/N atoms, and thus resulted in a shorter electron diffusion length with a larger propelling force.230 The synergic contribution of textural and electronic features thus prompted high photoelectrochemical performance with 50 to 60-fold larger photocurrent, as compared to the pristine g-C3N4 under solar and visible-light irradiation.134 Apart from single-doping, heteroatom co-doping has also been regarded as an effective approach to overcoming intrinsic limitations of g-C3N4 in terms of the optoelectronic properties and charge dynamics of the catalyst. For example, a B and S co-doped g-C3N4 photocatalyst demonstrated excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity towards the H2 evolution reaction as compared to that of the pristine and single-doped g-C3N4, implying that these co-dopants are highly beneficial for cross-plane mass diffusion owing to improved separation efficiency and reduced charge transfer resistance.231 Recently, Wei and co-workers employed W and O as the co-dopants for the formation of W/O co-doped hollow g-C3N4 tubular structure photocatalysts for the H2 evolution reaction via a facile one-step polycondensation method. Compared to the pristine and singly-doped systems, a co-doped system based on W and O displayed a high H2 production rate of 403.57 μmol g−1 h−1, which was about 2.5 times higher than the pristine, due to the features of high specific surface area, excellent light-harvesting capability, tunable electronic structure, and narrower band gap. Moreover, the active sites of W–N formed in the covalent polymer framework could swiftly capture electrons in the CB for H2 evolution purposes, while leaving photogenerated holes in the VB, thereby suppressing undesirable charge recombination.232 P/S co-doped g-C3N4, P/O co-doped g-C3N4, and K/I co-doped g-C3N4 have also been reported for their superior photocatalytic performance against the singly doped g-C3N4.233,234 More examples of hetero-element doping are provided in Table 3. These works present a rational approach to designing co-doped g-C3N4 for an efficient photocatalytic reaction.

4.2 Tailoring the porous structures of g-C3N4
The photocatalytic performance of a photocatalyst is coherently dependent on its effective surface area/accessible catalytic active sites, which could be achieved through various dimensionalities such as 1D nanorods and nanowires, 2D nanosheets, and 3D complex structures. As shown in Scheme 6, it was expected that the design of 3D complex/porous structures would expose more active sites due to the increased specific surface area, pore-volume, and mass transfer rate, consequently leading to satisfactory photocatalytic performance. Pioneering works in g-C3N4 development have been started by Antonietti and Wang et al. in powder form.3 However, the random aggregation of powdered g-C3N4 nanosheets in powder form suffers from low surface accessibility and is restricted by a complicated recovery process. In order to cope with the agglomeration and surface area limitations, 3D porous engineering is thus regarded as a positive approach towards high photocatalytic advancements.
 Scheme 6  Porous engineering of g-C3N4 and its advantages. 
In 2015, Yang and co-workers systematically revealed the positive effect of a macroscopic 3D porous graphitic carbon nitride monolith (PCNM) for water splitting applications. The macroscopic 3D porous PCNM was synthesized via a one-step thermal polymerization of urea within a melamine sponge framework, which has shown a high specific surface area in comparison to the g-C3N4 powder (Fig. 17A) owing to the effective prevention of the restacking of g-C3N4 nanosheets. Credited to its abundant porosity, high specific surface area, excellent charge separation efficiency, and good visible light captivity, PCNM exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity as compared to that of g-C3N4 powder for H2 evolution under visible light (Fig. 17B). Due to the porosity of the 3D structure, the PCNM demonstrated excellent light-harvesting ability above 450 nm in the optical spectrum (Fig. 17C) due to multiple reflections of incident light within the interconnected network of porous g-C3N4 nanosheets, in addition to the N-enriched carbon/g-C3N4 heterojunction.247,248 The improvement in light-harvesting is also credited to the smaller band gap of PCNM, which is 2.05 eV, as compared to the g-C3N4 powder (2.68 eV). The positive effect of 3D porous architecting was also demonstrated when the PCNM exhibited effective charge carrier separation when excited by visible light, as shown in the PL spectra of Fig. 17D, which suggests a larger barrier for charge recombination, unlike the g-C3N4 powder that displays a strong intrinsic fluorescence emission peak at 465 nm.27,248

Benefitting from the porous structure, Yang and co-workers also emphasized that the holey g-C3N4 nanosheets (HGCNs) that are characterized by numerous in-plane holes are much more favorable, ascribed to more accessible open pores that enhance charge transport during the photocatalytic process.249 Note that optimizing the flow of ammonia, heating temperature and duration are important to controlling the diameter and hole concentration. They disclosed that the rupturing of nanosheets (due to the distorted atomic arrangement and nanoholes) induces additional photocatalytically active sites, consequently resulting in high photocatalytic H2 production, which is about 20 times higher than BGCN (4.2 μmol h−1) under visible light of λ >420 nm, as depicted in Fig. 18A.249 The existing carbon vacancies within the holey nanosheets are the prime factor in enhancing the optical absorption of HGCN up to the NIR region (800–1400 nm, Fig. 18B), thanks to the room temperature ferromagnetism of HGCN. The hysteresis hoop observed in Fig. 18C proved the ferromagnetism of HGCN, which is attributed to spin-polarized conduction electrons in the spin-down branch.250 The multi-reflection of incident light within the porous structure of HGCN thus broadened the absorption tail of HGCN, as observed from 530–800 nm, thus proving the effectiveness of the holey structure.249 HGCN exhibited a long lifetime of 8.61 ns at 47.4% of the total PL emission intensity and a short lifetime of 2.17 ns at 52.6%, while BGCN recorded a long lifetime of 5.64 ns at 39.3% and a short lifetime of 1.35 ns at 60.7%. The longer lifetime of the intrinsic fluorescence is attributed to the improved photocarrier transport rate resulting from the quantum confinement effect.251,252 The photocatalytic superiority of a holey structure as compared to a pristine g-C3N4 was again revealed when macroscopic foam-like holey ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNHS) featuring abundant micro-, meso-, and macropores exhibited a high average H2 production rate (Fig. 18D) of 57.20 μmol h−1, as compared to the bulk (CNB), in addition to exhibiting excellent stability after 4 cycles (Fig. 18E).253 The macroscopic foam-like g-C3N4 was formed when CNB was thermally oxidized into nanosheets upon overcoming the weak van der Waals forces between layers, followed by the etching of C–N bonds from tri-s-triazine (melem) units.251,254 The photocatalytic enhancement is due to the flexible and ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets that have enormous in-plane holes ranging in size from several nanometers to about 100 nm, which generate new exposed active edges and cross-plane diffusion channels for charge transport, as depicted in Fig. 18F and G.253 Moreover, based on the results of UV-Vis and DRS analysis, Li and co-workers proved that the CB potential of CNHS was upshifted, thus a larger thermodynamic driving force is needed for photocatalytic H2 production (inset of Fig. 18H).

The advantages of the 3D porous structure g-C3N4 are not merely confined to photocatalytic properties, but they also extend to the optoelectronic properties. It has been proven that engineering a 3D porous architecture suppresses the charge recombination rate (evidenced by the lowered emission PL intensity in Fig. 19A) and decreases the band gap energy (evidenced by a red-shifted PL maximum from 452 nm to 470 nm). The synergism between the 3D porous structure and the N-dopant of UMx (urea:melamine in a molar ratio of 3:1), as reported by Tian et al., contributed to a shorter lifetime of 1.99 ns (for UM3) as compared to the g-C3N4 (3.26 ns), reflecting that the photogenerated charge carriers produced by UM3 are efficiently consumed by reactive substrates, in order to drive redox reactions (Fig. 19B). Consistent with other reports in the literature, the excellence of the porous structure has contributed to a high H2 evolution rate of 3579 μmol h−1 g−1 (Fig. 19C) under visible light irradiation (λ >420 nm), employing 20 vol% lactic acid as a sacrificial agent and 1% Pt as cocatalyst. Interestingly, Fig. 19D demonstrated a similar trend of results when the photocatalytic performance was assessed in the absence of Pt (keeping the other conditions the same), thus confirming the superiority of the porous 3D g-C3N4, regardless of the Pt usage.19,255 3D interconnected open-framework g-C3N4 nanosheets (in short denoted as g-C3N4 NS) were prepared through a facile bottom-up supramolecular self-assembly route (Fig. 20A) in which the 3D structure has a great specific surface area and acts as a supporter to prevent the restacking of nanosheets, consequently providing a pathway for electron transport. Different from the usual bulk g-C3N4, which consists of several micrometers of solid agglomerates, the 3D g-C3N4 NS exhibited a 3D interconnected open-framework with an average pore width of ∼20 nm, as observed through the SEM in Fig. 20B, suggesting efficient carrier transport. From the BET isotherms in Fig. 20C, the 3D g-C3N4 NS exhibited a large specific surface area up to about 130 m2 g−1, which was 13-fold and 1.4-fold larger than the bulk g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 NS, respectively, thus rendering more active sites for photocatalytic reactions. In this context, two important parameters, the AQY and STH, were investigated to gauge the hydrogen production efficiency of a nanomaterial. The AQY (Fig. 20D) for the overall water splitting of 3D g-C3N4 NS-2 at 420 nm was calculated to be 1.4%, which is significantly higher than Pt/g-C3N4 (0.3% at 405 nm), as reported by Zhang et al.195 Moreover, the STH energy conversion efficiency of 3D g-C3N4 NS (evaluated under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight 100 mW cm−2, 1 cm2) recorded a total of 5.73 μmol H2 productions after 6 h of illumination, with an STH value of 0.06%. This phenomenon is credited to the perfect matches of the conduction and valence band potentials of the 3D g-C3N4 NS photocatalyst, which met the thermodynamic energy criterion of direct water splitting. As depicted in Fig. 20E, the conduction band potential is more negative than the reduction H+/H2, while the valence band potential is more positive than the oxidation potential O2/H2O. In brief, the interconnected open framework of 3D g-C3N4 NS maximized the utilization of incident photons through multi-reflection, which led to efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rates up to 102 and 51 μmol g−1 h−1.87,256–258 This proved the role of porous engineering in charge carrier diffusion paths, enhanced light absorption, and conferred multi-surface-active sites/accessible channels for diffusion/adsorption to take place.19 An efficient precursor, hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) was utilized to synthesize 3D nitrogen-doped carbon materials (3D CCNS, Fig. 21A) through dehydration and carbonization processes. The easy sublimation decomposition process of HMTA produced carbon/nitrogen species upon heating, in which these carbon species could be embedded into the interior galleries between layers, thus acting as a diffusion path. Fig. 21B shows that the SEM image of CCNS presented a 3D porous configuration with vertically aligned nanowalls. Additionally, its interconnected network led to a high dispersity in water, which is an essential feature for photocatalytic H2 evolution.259 The uniqueness of this 3D carbon-rich CCNS resulted in efficient multidirectional photogenerated charge transfer; with an elongated lifetime of ∼5.75 ns from ∼2.19 ns for pristine CNS (Fig. 21E), consequently resulting in a prominent H2 evolution ratio of ∼27035.23 μmol−1 g−1 h−1 (31.3 times higher than that of pristine CNS, Fig. 21C). The efficiency of 3D CCNS in generating charges has contributed to a high AQE of ∼7.8% at 420 nm, as depicted in Fig. 21D.260 Essentially, the design of a novel porous photocatalyst with a thinner structure is ultra-important to reducing the photogenerated transportation period and distance, enabling the adsorption of photons and reactants, thus reducing trap densities.261 In brief, the open pore structure of the 3D interconnected network led to an excellent infiltration rate that favored mass transfer and charge separation, consequently prompting excellent catalytic performances.262,263

4.3 Nanostructured g-C3N4
The self-assembly engineering process has become prime technology for developing desirable diversified bottom-up nanostructured materials for electronics, optoelectronics, and catalysis applications.264–266 An ideal nanostructure should have orthogonalized light absorption and charge separation, and the maximum distance to transport a photogenerated carrier to the site of chemical reaction should be smaller than the retrieval length.38 In general, developing nanoscale and uniquely structured materials as depicted in Scheme 7 shortens the charge carriers' diffusion paths, which consequently facilitates the carrier migration onto the catalyst surface for redox reactions. Introducing foreign atoms such as B, S, P, and I into the graphitized backbone extends the electronic possibilities of g-C3N4 but it is still a challenge to achieve mutual effects between nanostructuring and the doping of g-C3N4 through a facile and cost-effective strategy.223 As compared to the bulk counterparts, nanostructures with controllable morphologies such as twisted hexagonal rod-like nanoarchitectures267 and hollow g-C3N4 nanospheres268 have been proven to shorten the charge carriers' diffusion paths, which consequently accelerates charge carrier movement and separation at the materials' interface. Moreover, these specially designed nanostructures facilitate mass transfer and, more importantly, they render ample active sites for reaction, which is one of the essential features that contribute to high performance.31,32,269
 Scheme 7  Morphological control of g-C3N4 by nanoarchitecting. 
Hollow nanospheres (HCNS) with relatively open spherical surfaces facilitate mass transfer. However, serious agglomeration of g-C3N4 nanosheets or the deformation of nanopores in HCNS shells is still indispensable for adjusting the nanosystems.270 Hence, structural optimization to modify the nanostructured systems was performed. Zhang and co-workers interconnected the nanosheets into nanospheres by employing KCC-1 silica spheres as sacrificial templates to prepare a 3D hierarchical open framework composed of opened-up nanosheets with the ‘lightning rod effect’ (sharp edges) and well-defined 2D fiber (Fig. 22A and B) nanoarchitectures, denoted as nanospherical g-C3N4 (NS-g-C3N4). This nanostructure was rich in opened-up surfaces and had a mesoporous structure, which is useful for mass transfer and charge separation.263Fig. 22C shows the quenched PL of NS-g-C3N4, implying the suppression of charge recombination, ascribed to the shortening charge migration diffusion length and relocalization of electrons on the surface terminal sites, especially at the 2D planar edges or tips that inhibit charge recombination.142,263 The advantage of hierarchical architecting was further amplified with an improved H2 evolution rate of 574 μmol h−1 on Pt/NS-g-C3N4 (3 wt%), about 46-fold higher as compared to 3 wt% Pt/bulk-g-C3N4, thus conclusively revealing the importance of multiple shape engineering in designing a photocatalyst.263

The addition of phosphorus heteroatoms within the carbon nitride skeleton enhances the growth of a unique photocatalyst morphological structure, reduces the band gap, enhances light absorption, restrains charge carrier recombination, enhances carrier mobility, and intensifies the utilization of visible light for photocatalytic H2 generation. A mesoporous P-doped g-C3N4 (P-CN) (Fig. 22D) nanostructured flower was prepared through the condensation and thermolysis of melamine and organophosphonic acid in template-free conditions. The successive P-doping was demonstrated when a color change was observed upon P doping into the g-C3N4 skeleton (pale yellow for un-doped to dark brown, inset of Fig. 22D). The incorporation of P atoms into the g-C3N4 framework altered the structural and electronic aspects of P-CN, in which the optical absorption band edge shifted to lower band gap energy as compared to the pristine g-C3N4, consequently improving the visible light-harvesting capability and enhancing the mass transfer. To judge the effectiveness of the P-atoms, Zhu et al. compared the photocatalytic performance of P-CN against the mesoporous g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 nanosheets, as observed in Fig. 22E. Although the mesoporous g-C3N4 (216 m2 g−1) and g-C3N4 nanosheets (273 m2 g−1) exhibited higher specific surface areas than P-CN, their catalytic activities were inferior to P-CN. This shows that synergism between nanostructures and P-doping of P-CN could elevate the surface reactivity for the photocatalytic reaction.223 The thin nanosheets that constructed P-CN (nanostructured flower, as shown in TEM of Fig. 22F) are beneficial for photochemical reactions, thanks to the reduced thickness of the photocatalyst, which shortened the charge transfer distance from the bulk to the interface.223,271
Guo et al. revealed that partially hydrolyzed melamine in cyanuric acid leads to the formation of a melamine–cyanuric acid supramolecular precursor through a phosphorus acid-assisted hydrothermal method. Upon thermal treatment, phosphorus-doped hexagonal tubular carbon nitride (P-TCN), engineered with a micro-nanostructure, was formed as illustrated in Fig. 23A. They highlighted the improvement of the visible light photocatalytic efficiency for H2 evolution (with a sacrificial agent), which was also attributed to the decrease of the band gap. Fig. 23B shows that the CB of P-TCN was shifted to a more negative value (−1.11 eV) ascribed to the quantum confinement effect, resulting from the hierarchical micro-nanostructure. A similar effect (quantum confinement) was also presented by previous calculation results, indicating that P doping increases the dispersion of the contour distribution of HOMO and LUMO, which enhances carrier mobility.272 This work has further demonstrated that the reported electronic band structure did not merely thermodynamically enhance its photocatalytic reaction, but it also suppressed the photogenerated recombination process, which is in great agreement with the PL emission (Fig. 23C, decreased peak intensity of P-TCN).221,273

The vital role of phosophoric acid in tuning the morphological structure of the catalyst for better photocatalytic performance was further disclosed in Jia's work. They successfully designed a 3D flower-like phosphorus-doped g-C3N4, in which, as observed through SEM and TEM (Fig. 23D and E), the synthesized phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 photocatalyst (denoted as PCN1.5, with the addition of 1.5 g phosophoric acid) was composed of multilayer nanosheets that interconnect as microstructured flowers with numbers of in-plane mesopores with a size of tens of nanometers.274 The phosphoric acid, in this case, functions as a structural stabilizer during the condensation process by aggregating cyanuric acid and melamine through the acid-base cross-linking effect, thereby increasing the accumulation of the cyanuric acid–melamine complex.221,223 The interesting feature of the P-element is that it serves as a dopant motif where the structure defects caused by phosphorus act as photogenerated electrons trapping centers that aim to facilitates the separation of electrons and holes, as well as to inhibit charges recombination, thus leading to excellent mobility and lifetime (Fig. 23F). More importantly, as depicted in Fig. 23G, P-doping promoted H2 gas production, with an H2 evolution rate of 256.4 μmol h−1 ascribed to the higher surface area and surface reactivity of PCN as compared to the pristine bulk g-C3N4 (BCN, 10.4 μmol h−1).274
Using melamine and NH4Br as the precursors, horn-like hollow mesoporous ultrathin g-C3N4 (HHMU g-C3N4) tubes were synthesized via a one-pot co-pyrolysis route (Fig. 24A). Interestingly, the HHMU g-C3N4 endowed remarkable photocatalytic performance towards H2 evolution as compared to the bulk, thus giving rise to an impressive wavelength-dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 14.3% under irradiation at 420 nm, as depicted in Fig. 24B and C. The unique nanostructure of HHMU g-C3N4 (SEM, Fig. 24E) possessed a high surface area (4-fold larger than the bulk), as proven through BET and was also supported by the TEM images. The TEM images of Pt-HHMU g-C3N4, as shown in Fig. 24F, illustrated that plenty of Pt particles were deposited on the outer shell surface of HHMU g-C3N4 tubes, implying that there were ample reduction active sites available on the outer shell of the HHMU g-C3N4 tubes, especially on the horn tips (a large amount of Pt particles were distributed, which was verified through TEM from Fig. 24G) for the capture of photogenerated electrons, whilst holes are transferred onto the inner shell of the tube (Fig. 24D).275 The benefit of texture tuning was further revealed when Yang et al. utilized melamine and glucose as the precursor and additive, respectively, in forming novel carbon self-doped g-C3N4 tubes (SEM, Fig. 24H), referred to as C-CNT, through a facile in situ solvothermal method. The uniqueness of the hexagonal tubular structure of C-CNT, such as the exposed abundant nitrogen defects dramatically improved the photoexcited charge carrier separation (Fig. 24I), thus achieving an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (Fig. 24J), higher than the pristine CNT and the traditional bulk counterpart (BCN).276

These reports on g-C3N4 nanostructuring afford robust g-C3N4 material for excellent H2 evolution as compared to the pristine or bulk g-C3N4. Likewise, a 3D structured C3N4 that was prepared via thermal polymerization using 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT) and melamine molecules as the precursors (Fig. 25A) presented 1D thick and uniform tubes, as shown in the SEM images (Fig. 25B–E). These tubes decorated with triazole ring groups altered the electrical and catalytic properties of the material, thereafter serving high photocatalytic H2 production (Fig. 25F) and excellent photogenerated charge separation due to the formation of a built-in electric field that promoted anisotropic character by the electron acceptor triazole rings (Fig. 25G and H).

The incorporation of triazole ring groups into the C3N4 skeleton reduced the 3D assembled catalyst's band gap, which is also beneficial for visible light harvesting.277 Unique louver-like P-doped carbon nitride nanowires, denoted as L-PCN, were successfully prepared through a hierarchical supramolecular self-assembly method by regulating the hydrogen bonds (Fig. 26A). The novelty of this nanostructure (L-PCN) with its high specific surface area, more boundaries, and exposed active sites (SEM and TEM in Fig. 26B–F) resulted in excellent photo-/electrocatalytic water splitting activity (Fig. 26G), credited to the modified electronic structure where P doping could harvest more visible light. Moreover, a high mass transport of L-PCN and efficient charge transfer channels between different tri-s-triazine rings (Fig. 26H) are the important factors contributing to the excellent electromobility of charge carriers (refer to EIS in Fig. 26I).264 There have been plenty of works reported on the positive effects of P-doping for excellent photocatalytic activity. To fully understand the importance and fundamental effects of P-doping in C3N4, DFT calculations were performed by Li et al. They found that P-doped C3N4 exhibited stronger interlayer binding, which contributed to the narrower band gap. P-doping also resulted in an increasing absorption tail of L-PCN, attributed to the formation of a new mid-gap state above the VBM. They also noticed that P doping can spatially separate the HOMO and LUMO (Fig. 26J and K), thus leading to the efficient spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, which inhibited charge recombination. The representative improvements of nanostructured photocatalysts are summarized in Table 4. It was confirmed that hierarchical self-assembly is an effective approach to ensuring outstanding H2 evolution activity, owing to its effective functional features such as ample active sites and controllable morphology that facilitate charge transport.

5. Other applications
5.1 Photoreduction of CO2
The ever-growing atmospheric levels of CO2 emissions, up to 415 ppm in 2019 (Fig. 27A and B), have attracted significant attention to date over the arising environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect, global warming, etc. CO2 is thermodynamically stable, attributed to its high CO double bond energy of 750 kJ mol−1 relative to the single bonds: C–H (411 kJ mol−1), C–O (327 kJ mol−1), and C–C (336 kJ mol−1). Hence, high energy to kick start the activation of CO bonds is usually required to transform them into the respective hydrocarbons such as CO, CH4, HCOOH, CH3OH, HCHO, CH2CH2, C2H5OH, and CH3COOH. In order to obtain a specific product, as listed in Table 1, the energy level of the CB of a photocatalyst and its corresponding reduction potential are the important factors that determine the production of the final product. In principle, a more negative CB potential of the semiconductor elevates the driving force for its respective CO2 reduction reaction, while a more positive VB potential than the oxidation half-reaction is much more favorable for hindering the photocatalyst's photo-corrosion.278,279 As far as we know, a direct single-electron CO2 reduction process is difficult to drive by any photocatalyst due to its strongly negative redox potential of −1.85 eV, unless with the assistance of multi-electrons/protons in reducing its potential (lower E°), as depicted in Table 5. During the photoreduction process, it should be noted that the occurrence of undesirable parasitic reactions (H2 evolution) when performing the CO2 reduction process in water is inevitable. H2O is added not merely to provide H atoms for CO2 photoreduction; it also acts as a competing reagent in this system. Regardless of its thermodynamics or kinetics, proton reduction to H2 (only two electrons needed) can occur much easier than CO2 reduction (more than two electrons). This reveals why the current efficiencies of CO2 photoreduction are several orders of magnitude lower than the photocatalytic H2 production from water reduction. Therefore, it is imperative to explore effective approaches to strengthen the selectivity of CO2 reduction products over H2 generation, aiming at designing the photocatalytic centers with adequate adsorption capacity, electron/proton relay units, and cocatalysts.280

Various strategies ranging from doping, morphology control, vacancy modulation, surface modification, and heterojunction construction have been executed for this purpose. Among them, elemental (heteroatoms) doping in the form of metal or non-metal atoms offers a protocol to profoundly tailor the local surface microstructure and electronic properties of metal-free photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Regardless of single element-doping such as O, P, Eu(III), or multi-element co-doping such as K/carbon defects and oxygen/carbon, both elements are the species for CO2 photoreduction.229,279 Loading suitable cocatalysts such as noble metals, non-noble metals, and metal oxides for interface design is popular due to the expectation of a lowered activation energy, promoted surface charge separation, increased selectivity of specific products, and improved photo-chemical stability.282 Among the reduction cocatalysts, 2D sp2-hybridized graphene, which is an allotrope with carbon–carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagon, is expected to be an effective cocatalyst to increase the contact area for effective charge transfer across the g-C3N4 interfaces.283 Ong et al. demonstrated that the formation of C–O–C covalent bond cross-linkers between graphene and g-C3N4 promotes charge transfer, which contributes to a 2.3-fold enhancement in CO2 photoreduction to CH4 under visible light irradiation.284 The addition of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) has simultaneously improved the adsorption of non-polar CO2 and enhanced the reaction kinetics for CH4 generation. Impressively, CQDs/g-C3N4 produced 6-fold higher CO and CH4 as compared to the pristine and, more importantly, the incorporation of CQDs modified the g-C3N4 surface with higher selectivity for CO2 reduction, without any detectable H2 (Fig. 28A and B).285 These results indicate that the high selectivity of CO2 reduction products over H2 generation is not merely correlated to the adsorption capability of CO2/H2O, but also the CO2 species adsorbed on the photocatalyst.280 In addition, surface modifications by introducing surface vacancies and defects are also workable in this case because they improve the light-absorbing abilities of the materials and serve as active sites for CO2 adsorption-activation and capturing electrons, in addition to modulating the band structure and charge carrier transport and separation properties.286 For instance, a defective g-C3N4 with an optimized amount of nitrogen vacancies exhibited four-fold higher CO yield than the bulk g-C3N4 owing to the formation of midgap states below the CB edges as a band tail state that trapped the photoexcited electrons to accelerate charge carrier transport and separation (Fig. 28C).287 However, excessive vacancies caused deeper midgap states, which serve as charge carrier recombination sites (Path 3 of Fig. 28C). A nitrogen rich-defective g-C3N4 prepared by Shi and co-workers through the one-step tartaric acid-assisted thermal polymerization of dicyandiamide (Fig. 28D) demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction ability with a CO yield of 284.7 μmol g−1 and minute H2 yield of 51.6 μmol g−1.288 Similarly, the introduction of C vacancies into g-C3N4 upshifted the CB level, thus improving the reductive ability of the photocatalyst.289

5.2 N2 photofixation
Dinitrogen (N2) forms about 78% by volume of the earth's atmosphere. Ammonia (NH3) as an essential green energy carrier and raw material for fertilizers plays a pivotal role in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. N2 fixation is thermodynamically feasible: N2(g) + 3H2(g) = 2NH3(g), ΔH298K = −92.2 kJ mol−1, but this reaction cannot be executed spontaneously under ambient conditions due to the strong NN triple bond energy of 941 kJ mol−1, high ionization energy of 15.85 eV, and poor proton affinity of −1.90 eV.290 Conventionally, NH3 is manufactured by the Haber-Bosch process using H2 and N2 under extremely high pressure and temperature over an Fe-based catalyst.143,291–293 Nevertheless, this process leads to massive energy consumption and large amounts of CO2 generation. Hence, N2 fixation via photocatalysis is regarded as an ideal process for NH3 production under normal temperature and pressure, with a Gibbs free energy of 339 kJ mol−1. Principally, driving the N2 fixation process is much more challenging than the water splitting reaction because more energy is needed to drive this reaction and this is the reason the reported efficiencies are usually much lower than water splitting. Two steps are involved during N2 fixation: (i) H2O splitting into H2 and O2 and (ii) the production of NH3 using H2 and N2. One major challenge of this process is the activation of N2 molecules since these inert molecules are chemically stable and a high dissociation energy is needed to break the NN bond.293 The working principal of this reaction is similar to H2 and CO2 splitting and it involves the following: (i) the photoexcitation process under light illumination and the migration of charge carriers to the surface of the photocatalyst (note that recombination process would occur); (ii) the use of a sacrificial reagent such as methanol to capture the photogenerated holes during the photocatalytic process, which is subsequently oxidized to formaldehyde; (iii) the photoreduction of adsorbed N2 molecules on the active sites by the electrons and further reaction with the protons to produce NH3.294,295
Defect engineering, in particular, nitrogen-vacancy (e.g., g-C3N4), oxygen-vacancy (e.g., bismuth oxyhalides, bismuth oxides, and titanium oxides), and sulfur-vacancy (e.g., cadmium zinc sulfides and cadmium sulfides) are popular in N2 photo-fixation. Notably, bulk defects are the charge carrier recombination centers, but surface defects serve as adsorption sites where the photogenerated charge carriers transfer to the adsorbed species and accelerate charge carrier separation.296–299 In this context, introducing defects into the semiconductor as additional electron donors is amenable for light-excited electrons to promote NN bond activation.297,300 Taking the example of nitrogen-vacancy in g-C3N4, various methods such as calcining treatment, microwave treatment, the infrared-assisted microwave method, the dissolve-regrowth method, template-free method, and metal doping have been employed to engineer nitrogen vacancies for g-C3N4, in short, denoted as V-g-C3N4.301,302 In creating nitrogen vacancies, an appropriate base material that contains facile detachable nitrogen atoms, while leaving the rest of the defective materials in its stable state is of utmost importance. It is expected that nitrogen vacancies should be more effective at chemisorbing N2 as compared to the oxygen vacancies, subsequently activating them on vacant sites due to the identical features of shape and size to the nitrogen atoms. Dong et al. synthesized V-g-C3N4 by a calcination process under N2 flow and they demonstrated that defective g-C3N4 exhibited stronger chemisorption species of N2 as compared to g-C3N4, thus resulting in enhanced photocatalytic N2 fixation capability. As verified through PL analysis, engineering nitrogen vacancies improved the charge separation efficiency as they (nitrogen vacancies) act as defects to trap photogenerated electrons and inhibit charge carrier recombination. In addition, nitrogen vacancies promote the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the photocatalyst to the adsorbed N2.303 When Pd was loaded on the V-g-C3N4, it was surprising that N2 could not be adsorbed on the Pd group metals, which could be attributed to the considerable work function, implying that nitrogen vacancies are the only chemical adsorption sites of N2 (Fig. 29).301 Apart from inducing vacancies, defects caused by the catalyst morphology and surface functional groups have also been studied. The introduction of cyano CN defect groups into the structure edge of g-C3N4 has demonstrated higher NH4+ generation rates than the pristine, owing to these cyano groups acting as effective electron traps to improve the separation of charge carriers, in addition to providing more adsorption sites for N2 adsorption and activation.304 The authors also explicated the importance of hole scavengers because they (methanol in this case) swiftly capture holes to inhibit charge recombination. In the absence of any organic scavengers or noble cocatalysts, it was noted that the ammonia yield was comparatively lower.304 Boron, a non-metal that is identical in size to carbon and nitrogen could be incorporated into the g-C3N4 framework with ease. In a report by Yao and co-workers, they successfully synthesized B-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets loaded with Ag nanoparticles through a direct one-step in situ decomposition-thermal polymerization method. They revealed that by doping boron, defective g-C3N4 could be formed due to the different atomic radius and electronic densities of B and C/N atoms.294 These shallow defective sites serve as electron trap centers, which lead to high photoactivity. Moreover, the empty p-orbitals of these B-dopants (optimized amount) form delocalized big Π bonds with the neighboring atomic rings, which speed up electron migration in the g-C3N4 layers and suppress charge carrier recombination. Both the defects and delocalized big Π bond mechanisms explain the improvement of the photocatalytic performance of B-g-C3N4.294,305Fig. 30 provides an in-depth understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism of nitrogen fixation with an example of defective Bi2O2CO3, in short BOC-X. An ideal photo-fixation process is meant for the successive photoexcitation of electrons from the VB of BOC-X to the CB when the photon energy is greater than the band gap (left), subsequently reacting with the adsorbed N2 for NH3 production. However, during this photoexcitation process, a portion of the electrons will participate in the photoreduction reaction directly (excited to CB), while a portion will be transferred to the defect level and react with N2 or intermediates. Taking the second case study (the figure on the right), if the photon energy is lower than the band gap, no electrons from the VB will be excited to the CB, but the electrons of BOC-X could reach the defect level and participate in nitrogen fixation. In this case, the position of the defect level is the main factor that determines the workability of a nitrogen fixation process because a too-high defect level requires greater photon energy (shorter λ) for the photoexcited electrons to reside in the defect level, which will reduce the utilization of light. In contrast, a lower defect level may suppress the reduction ability of the excited electrons for nitrogen fixation. In summary, surface defects modulate the band structure of the photocatalyst, extend the light absorption range, and accelerate charge carrier transport, thus leading to remarkable nitrogen photo-fixation activity.295Table 6 shows more examples of photocatalysts used in CO2 photoreduction and N2 photo-fixation.

In this review, we highlighted three types of decorations, which include (a) tailoring porous-structures of g-C3N4, (b) constructing composites of g-C3N4, and (c) nanostructured g-C3N4 for three main far-reaching targets, including (i) broadening the absorption capability up to the visible light region, (ii) suppressing the charge recombination rate, and (iii) increasing surface adsorption and reactions on the photocatalyst surface. As aforementioned, the overall process of splitting water always involves three main steps that are correlated to charge kinetics, i.e., charge generation, separation and transfer, and conversion processes in photocatalysts. These consecutive steps are complementary and ultra-important because the maximum efficiency of g-C3N4 is only achievable when all of these three steps are fulfilled with the desired efficiencies. For this reason, improving the efficiency of each step by means of charge kinetics is extremely critical as it is the basic requirement in designing a novel and highly efficient photocatalyst. For this purpose, various efforts/strategies (Table 7) should be deployed to overcome the bottlenecks of each mentioned step towards empowering the light-response capability of the photocatalyst. In this review, we first outlined the types of nanocomposite by coupling g-C3N4 with other well-matched energy levels of semiconductors or metals (cocatalysts) to form various types of heterojunctions, which include metal/g-C3N4, type-I, type-II, and Z-scheme heterojunctions. Among these heterojunctions, type-II and Z-scheme heterojunction systems are the most popular for the water splitting and photoreduction of CO2 due to an upgraded level in charge carrier dynamics. In addition, modulating g-C3N4 at an atomic level by either elemental metal or non-metal doping widens the visible light-harvesting ability, and improves the redox ability and charge mobility. The nanoarchitecture of g-C3N4 is of extreme significance for superior photocatalytic efficiency because it provides a new array to increase the light-harvesting ability of g-C3N4, in addition to stabilizing the hybrid photocatalysts.

Though remarkable progress has been achieved in photocatalytic overall water splitting, there are still some challenges to curb prior to achieving satisfactory overall energy conversion efficiency, as discussed below:
the first challenge is the non-comparable experimental results (H2 and O2 evolution performances) reported by different research groups, due to the usage of different light sources, filters used, light intensities, the type and amount of cocatalyst used, the type and concentration of sacrificial agents, and the condition of the reactor. For example, non-standardized light intensities used in most experimental works increased the difficulty in comparing works from other research groups despite similar catalysts being used. Hence, the design of a photo-detector as a centralized H2 evolution efficiency validator is necessary for more reliable data collection. In addition, AQY should be reported instead of only the evolution rates.
The second challenge is that the photocatalytic efficiency is still considerably low due to the complexity and toughness in kick-starting the oxidation process (OER) in the overall water splitting reaction. This is because to initiate the OER requires a high input of energy to overcome the kinetic limitations of a four-electron transfer process, unlike the HER (two-electron process). The OER process is important in an overall water splitting reaction because it is the main proton supplier for the subsequent H2 evolution. To override the high activation energy, developing an efficient oxidation cocatalyst such as a bimetallic cocatalyst (FeSnOS) or other metal oxides such as IrO2 could be the solution.326,327 It is expected that the intimacy between the cocatalyst and g-C3N4 will enable smoother charge extraction, thereby enhancing charge transfer, as in the case of PEC. The coupling of the cocatalyst could mitigate the interface resistance of the photoelectrode, subsequently promoting charge transfer dynamics. Apart from the physical assistance from the cocatalyst, the electric supply is also a credit to increasing the photocatalytic efficiency through charge recombination suppression. Besides the cocatalyst effect, engineering a Z-scheme system could suppress the backward reaction, thus allowing effective oxidation and reduction processes to happen on the respective sites. Another solution to overcoming the kinetic limitation would be providing additional kinetic energy (thermal energy) during the photocatalytic reaction, namely thermo-photo catalysis. It is expected that the oxidation driving force could be elevated under a thermally assisted photocatalytic reaction, thus improving the photocatalytic performance.
The third challenge is that the facile reverse reaction commonly occurs due to the low Gibbs free energy of water formation (ΔG = −237 kJ mol−1). In order to suppress the backward reaction, the H2 and O2 sites should be separated by loading dual cocatalysts or O2-insensitive cathodes that possess high selectivity towards the evolution of H2 and O2, respectively. High selectivity could also be achieved through the PEC system with the need to control the film's quality. Methods for achieving the firm adhesion of the photoactive materials to the substrates should be emphasized for this purpose.
The fourth challenge, the use of sacrificial reagents, has contributed to excellent photocatalytic efficiency but it has some issues. First, based on the type of SED used, the efficiency reported by each group is likely incomparable. Secondly, SED-assisted water splitting disobeys the stoichiometry of pure-water splitting since it involves the splitting of pure water in a stoichiometry of one molecule of hydrogen and two molecules of oxygen. Thus, it is suggested that the splitting of water should be performed in the absence of a sacrificial agent. In the case of SED-free water splitting, it is recommended that thermal energy be applied during the photocatalytic reaction, namely thermo-photo catalysis, to increase the efficiency of hydrogen production.
The fifth challenge is that the presence of defect states within the catalyst is detrimental to attaining efficiency because bulk defects act as charge carrier recombination sites that impede the efficient charge separation and migration process, consequently reducing the desirable H2 yield. Thus, morphology control and the film's quality or the film's crystallinity are important gauging factors for high photocatalytic performance. In this case, different strategies (Table 7) should be employed to tune the morphologies. The defect states should also be investigated through different evaluation methods such as thermally stimulated current, PL, etc. To a certain extent, creating surface defects is useful because they are the adsorption sites that enable photogenerated charge carrier transfer to the adsorbed species and accelerate charge carrier separation. For instance, a nitrogen defective g-C3N4 displayed superior photocatalytic H2 performance under visible light irradiation, credited to the efficient visible light-harvesting ability on the surface N vacancies and efficient charge separation process.328
The sixth challenge is closely related to real applications. The relative efficiency and stability of the hybrid nanocomposites reported thus far are still low, and are far from meeting the industrial requirements. It should be noted that g-C3N4 in its pure phase is stable under ambient conditions but when modifications are adopted such as the introduction of dopants, it poses a risk to the stability of the modified g-C3N4 because it is difficult to control the particle size on the g-C3N4, which would result in aggregation. For example, P-dots/g-C3N4 tends to agglomerate and decompose after prolonged runs, thus compromising the stability.329 This affects the intimate contact between the interfacial composite for effective charge separation and migration. Thus, the rational design of nanostructures and the use of appropriate functionalizing materials are important to increase the quantum efficiency of the reaction. Apart from the stability issue, another challenge that impedes practical application is the use of expensive noble metal cocatalysts in photocatalytic reactions. From the viewpoint of commercialization, the cost of the photocatalyst is a concerning issue. Noble metals such as Au and Pt are expensive and scarce. Thus, relentless efforts should be devoted to developing new noble metal-free cocatalysts. Taking the case of CO2 photoreduction, metal–organic complex cocatalysts rendered positive effects for the selective CO2 photoreduction due to their tunable electronic properties for efficient light harvesting and the multifunctional groups responsible for the effective adsorption and activation of CO2.282
The rational modification of g-C3N4, as discussed in Section 4, undeniably enriches the family of visible-light-driven g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for application in different fields. It is known that the synthesis of g-C3N4 is facile by the thermal polymerization of nitrogen-rich precursors, however, the bulk counterparts possess low surface area and surface active sites are the restraining factors towards excellent photochemical efficiency. Thus, the choice of g-C3N4 precursors, accompanied by optimized reaction temperatures and durations for the condensation process, should be emphasized. Furthermore, researchers should be aware that aggregation is a common outcome when a nanoparticle of unknown particle size is decorated on the g-C3N4 anchoring site at the molecular level. Regarding this matter, it is difficult to construct an intimate heterojunction interface (between g-C3N4 and nanoparticles), which results in charge separation and migration process issues. As a solution for this problem, tuning the surface charge of g-C3N4 with specific surface groups should be highlighted in strengthening the anchoring ability of g-C3N4.67,330
Although photocatalysis paves the way for green energy production, to some extent, photocatalysis reactions, typically photodegradation, pose a threat to the environment due to the production of undesirable secondary products. Some photocatalytic processes degrade by-products efficiently, but some of these products could be more toxic than the initial form. Hence, establishing a new path to diminish the side effects of photochemical reactions is crucial to guarantee large-scale commercial applications.331
It is of supreme importance to promote joint efforts between academia and industry to work hand in hand to start a revolution of renewable energy by applying g-C3N4-based nanostructures practically and commercially. It is envisioned that the advances made in g-C3N4 materials are not merely confined to sunlight-driven water splitting devices, but they are also potential alternatives to industrially used catalysts in other applications such as energy conversion, energy storage, and wastewater treatment owing to the factors of abundance and cost-effectiveness (inexpensive starting materials). In addition, g-C3N4 is a green material that id free from heavy metal ions, thereby facilitating ease of handling and disposal. As a proof-of-concept, g-C3N4 has been successfully used in photodegradation. It is expected that using g-C3N4 in other applications such as laser-patterned memory devices and energy storage devices, apart from photocatalytic applications on a commercial scale, is realizable in the near future.332
