We find that the number of substituents affects both the Voc and Jsc of the devices, with the disulfonated wsZnPc devices performing best.
Small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSC) have made great strides in recent years,1,2 especially in the case of solution processed devices,3 with a record efficiency of 6.7%.4 However, to date, the range of efficient small molecule donors described in the literature is quite limited due to the difficulty in first synthesising a soluble molecule with semiconductor properties followed by successfully retaining its optoelectronic properties when incorporated into a device.
Phthalocyanine (Pc) donors have been shown to produce relatively efficient SMOSC,5,6 with recent solution processed small molecule bulk heterojunctions utilising Pc donors showing efficiencies of 0.8% using a zinc Pc (ZnPc) derivative and 1.6% with a ruthenium Pc (RuPc) oligothiophene complex.7,8 Pcs are ideal sensitisers, with outstanding absorption in the near IR region; yet their use in SMOSC, as with any efficient SMOSC, has involved organic chlorinated solvents to perform the deposition of the active layers. Ideally, organic films fabricated using solution process techniques should avoid the use of environmentally inconvenient solvents, such as chlorinated solvents (e.g. chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, etc.) to reduce health risks and become even more environmentally friendly.9,10
Based on these factors, Jones and co-workers reported a significant finding based on a water-soluble tetrasulfonated copper Pc (CuPc-S4) that provides a route to removing chlorinated solvents in the fabrication of a SMOSC.11 Thus, they showed that it is possible to produce devices where part of the active area has been prepared from aqueous CuPc-S4 solutions, with the acceptor layer being prepared using moderate-vacuum deposition techniques due to the poor solubility of C60 molecules in water. The devices showed a light-to-energy conversion under standard conditions of 0.32%. Interestingly in the work mentioned above, there was no contribution of photocurrent from the CuPc-S4 donor, which severely limited the device photocurrent (Jsc) and in turn the power conversion efficiency (η). Considering this lack of photocurrent, it seems obvious that a significant margin for improvement in device performance exists.
Krebs and co-workers have also shown encouraging results fabricating organic solar cells (OSC) based on polymer–fullerene heterojunctions where some or all of the layers were processed using aqueous solutions, with efficiencies as high as 0.7%.12–15 However unlike CuPc-S4, the active layers were not directly water soluble, and required the use of chlorinated solvents or fluorinated surfactants prior to dispersing them in an aqueous solution. Nonetheless this collection of work provides promising routes towards greener OSC.
Following the pioneering work of Jones, we report on a series of anionic water-soluble ZnPc (wsZnPc) derivatives with varying numbers of sulfonate substituents at the periphery of the macrocycle (Fig. 1). By altering the number of substituents we aimed to shift the frontier orbital energies and significantly alter the device characteristics. First of all, we observed that the tetrasulfonated ZnPc (ZnPc-S4) fails to contribute to the photocurrent akin to the CuPc-S4 analogue. Nonetheless, by decreasing the number of substituents to two or three sulfonate groups, it was possible to observe a contribution of wsZnPc to the photocurrent. This increase in Jsc was accompanied by a noticeable decrease in open circuit voltage, Voc. The best donor molecule is shown to be the disulfonated ZnPc (ZnPc-S2), recording an efficiency of up to 0.46% at 1 sun (100 mW using sun simulated AM 1.5 G spectrum) which represents a significant improvement.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the three sulfonated ZnPc derivatives studied: ZnPc-S4, ZnPc-S3 and ZnPc-S2, the latter being a mixture of ABAB and A2B2 regioisomers. 
The sulfonated derivatives ZnPc-S2, ZnPc-S3 and ZnPc-S4 were prepared by condensation of 4-sulfonatophthalate and (when required, i.e., for ZnPc-S2 and ZnPc-S3) phthalic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio, following modified procedures from the literature (see ESI†).16,17 The devices were fabricated by spin coating a 10 mg ml−1 sulfonated ZnPc solution directly onto UV/O3 treated ITO (2000 rpm, 1 min, ∼13 nm thick),11 followed by the evaporation of C60 (40 nm), BCP (10 nm), and Al (100 nm), with devices having an active area of 0.09 cm2. All devices were studied under standard conditions (A.M 1.5 G solar spectrum, 100 mW cm−2). The J–V curves for the respective devices differ significantly (Fig. 2a), resulting in very different Voc and Jsc values. The standout result here is the significant increase in photocurrent with decreasing number of sulfonate substituents. The device comprising of ZnPc-S4 shows similar characteristics to those of the CuPc analogue (CuPc-S4) investigated by Jones and co-workers11 (i.e. relatively high Voc and very low Jsc), due to the inability of the device to extract the photogenerated charges from the donor layer. However, upon decreasing the number of substituents the photocurrent increases. The origin of the increase in photocurrent is clearly depicted in the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra shown in Fig. 2b. For devices where ZnPc-S4 was employed the IPCE spectra show no photogenerated current in the spectral region where it absorbs. The di- and trisulfonated donor ZnPcs do however show a contribution to the device photocurrent. A similar effect of the degree of ZnP sulfonation on photocurrent has been previously described for photoelectrochemical cells.17

Corresponding absorption spectra of wsZnPc thin films are shown in the inset of (b). Black squares correspond to ZnPc-S4, blue/white squares to ZnPc-S3 and red circles to ZnPc-S2. 
One probable explanation for the lack of photocurrent from ZnPc-S4 arises from the small difference in energy between the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the ZnPc-S4 and the C60 LUMO. In OSC the photogenerated electron–hole pair (exciton) is bound by a Coulombic force, which is on the order of 0.3 eV. In order to separate charges, the general process requires excitons to travel to the donor–acceptor interface where the difference in donor and acceptor LUMO levels must exceed the Coulombic attraction force, i.e., the difference in donor and acceptor LUMO levels, ΔELUMO, has to exceed 0.3 eV. In the case of ZnPc-S4, the LUMO energy is −3.3 eV, whereas ZnPc-S3 and ZnPc-S4 both have LUMO energies of −3.2 eV (Table 1). Comparison of these values with the energy of the C60 LUMO, −3.5 eV,18 shows that the photocurrent differences observed may simply be explained by a lack of free energy at the ZnPc-S4–C60 interface. Here however, the values we present for the LUMO energies are for isolated molecules, which do not represent the interfacial electronic interactions present in the device.19A more detailed study on each wsZnPc–C60 interface is therefore required to confirm this hypothesis.

Studying the morphology of the wsZnPc films using atomic force microscopy (Fig. 3) provides further insights into the role sulfonation plays in controlling device performance. A clear difference between the morphology of ZnPc-S4 and the di- and trisulfonated ZnPc films is seen, with ZnPc-S4 forming large crystalline domains as opposed to the more ‘grainy’ morphology of ZnPc-S2 and ZnPc-S3. The roughness of the former is also much lower, with a route-mean square roughness (RMS) of 3.0 nm as opposed to 5.8 and 9.3 nm for the di- and trisulfonated ZnPc films. The high RMS of ZnPc-S3 films may explain the low Voc as they are on the order of the film thickness and may lead to contact between ITO and C60. The trends made here regarding morphology correlate well with the device performance values and suggest that morphology plays a key role in determining the photocurrent in these devices, as well as the photovoltage. The morphology of the thin-films may also affect the interfacial electronic interactions with C60, which would tie in with our earlier hypothesis that the problem with photocurrent generation in ZnPc-S4 is a thermodynamic one. We would like to remark that increasing the thickness of the wsZnPc layers led to a decrease in performance (data not shown) in agreement with the case of tetrasulfonated CuPc,11 suggesting a low exciton diffusion length for free carriers in these devices.

Turning to the relationship between the degree of sulfonation and the device Voc, it is important to note that it is not directly related with the degree of sulfonation, being highest for ZnPc-S4, lowest for ZnPc-S3 and ZnPc-S2 having a value in between. It is worth mentioning that the 100 mV difference in energy between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of ZnPc-S2 and ZnPc-S3 does correspond well to the 110 mV difference in Voc (Table 1). Nonetheless, the origin of the device Voc in OSC is still under active debate, with many attempts at understanding it being reported in recent years.20–23 In general, the device Voc is proportional to the difference in energy between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, ΔEDA, yet the molecules used here all possess very similar HOMO energies. In this respect we would expect the device Voc to be lowest for ZnPc-S2, as it possesses the lowest ΔEDA. Therefore, we speculate several loss processes to exist that lead to the lower device Voc observed for ZnPc-S2 and ZnPc-S3, especially considering the very different morphologies observed with the AFM study. Further characterisation of the charge transfer processes occurring in the device, under working conditions, is still under active investigation and is out of the scope of this communication. Here we have focused on prototyping a more effective SMOSC that employs a water-soluble donor sensitiser capable of contributing to the device photocurrent.
In conclusion, we have shown that the role of the substituents in ZnPc molecules is paramount for tuning the performance of OSC based on water-soluble Pcs. This finding has led to a significant improvement in device performance by tuning the energy levels of the donor ZnPc to achieve a more energetically favourable photooxidation of the C60 acceptor layer, resulting in maximum efficiencies of 0.46% under standard conditions. Also, the number of substituents controls the morphology of the thin films, which in turn affects device performance. Having successfully demonstrated our first goal, the next step will be to develop a water-soluble acceptor molecule, in order to provide both an environmentally friendly and an inexpensive route towards functional OSC.
