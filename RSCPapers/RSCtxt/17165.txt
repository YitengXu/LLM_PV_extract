    , Accepted 3rd September 2020First published on 4th September 2020AbstractWe demonstrate a series of direct arylation polycondensed conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) for application in universal and thickness-insensitive electron transport materials (ETMs) of highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs). The energy levels, absorption spectra, and self-doping behaviors of these CPEs are altered by the substituted alkyl and alkoxy ammonium side chains. PSCs with three donor:acceptor combinations as active layers are examined and the results indicate that these CPEs are capable of achieving high efficiency for both fullerene PSCs and non-fullerene PSCs. The excellent capability of CPEs for interface modification achieves high-performance PM6:Y6-based PSCs with a PCE of over 16%. Moreover, the high electron mobilities of these CPEs endow them with high performance at thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm, indicating that these CPEs are good candidates as universal and thickness-insensitive ETMs for PSCs.
Introduction
Recent advances in the design and synthesis of organic photovoltaic materials have opened up a new landscape for polymer solar cells (PSCs) with unprecedented power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 18%.1–9 The combination of wide band gap donors and non-fullerene acceptors as active layers works well since it can sufficiently utilize sunlight, achieve optimal morphology, and reduce energy loss.10–17 Besides, electron transport materials (ETMs) sandwiched between active layers and cathode electrodes are also critical for the device performance since they can circumvent the carrier collection barrier between the high-work-function metal electrode and the active layer.18–24 Thus, extensive ETMs based on inorganic semiconductors25,26 and organic semiconductors (both polymers and molecules)19,20,22,27 have been developed to obtain efficient PSCs.
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), as one of the most important and efficient ETMs, offer the advantages of orthogonal solution processing and cathode modification since they can overcome the interlayer mixing during processing, lower the work function of electrodes, reduce the energy barrier, and induce interface doping.28–38 CPEs with various conjugated backbones and side chains are developed to achieve efficient PSCs. In particular, recently developed n-type self-doped CPEs show fascinating properties of varied doping features and high mobility.32,36,39,40 The doping behaviours of such kind of materials could be tuned via structural modification of the counterions as well as the n-type backbones, which paves the way for designing novel materials and realize new properties and applications.41–45
Although a wide range of self-doped CPEs have been successfully developed, most of the CPEs suffer from the limitation of thickness when used in PSCs. Thick ETMs provide a great chance for the fabrication of large-area PSCs via roll-to-roll printing since they can reduce the effect of fluctuation and improve the device reproducibility.46,47 These self-doped CPEs break the thickness limitation of 5–10 nm in traditional polyfluorene-based ETMs (such as PFN-Br); however, few of them can work well at a larger thickness (such as 100 nm)32 due to the relatively low electron mobility of the n-type conjugated backbones in these CPEs. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop novel CPEs with high mobility for application in future large-area PSCs. N2200 is one of the n-type conjugated polymers featuring the highest mobility;48 however, few self-doped CPEs based on this backbone have been reported. Besides, the modification of the chemical structures of CPEs could further alter the self-doping behaviours of CPEs. These factors have inspired us to explore high-performance self-doped CPEs based on highly-conductive conjugated backbones and achieve excellent charge transporting properties for PSC application. Furthermore, the polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors for PSCs are continuously updated. Consequently, developing CPEs with broad compatibility with different donors:acceptors not only potentially improves the photovoltaic performance but also simplifies the choice of materials used in future large-area PSCs.
Herein, we reported a series of direct arylation polycondensed naphthalene di-imide (NDI)-based conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs, PNDT, PNDTO, and PNDTOO, as shown in Scheme 1), which present good application as thickness-insensitive ETMs for PSCs with different active layers. A facile and efficient direct arylation polycondensation (DAP) protocol was first adopted to synthesize neutral precursor polymers, which were then quaternized to obtain CPEs. The NDI-bithiophene backbones in these CPEs were substituted with alkyl and alkoxy-based ammonium side chains, resulting in various absorption spectra, energy levels, and doping behaviors. The potential of these CPEs as ETMs in fullerene PSCs and non-fullerene PSCs was investigated. PSCs with three donor:acceptor combinations were adopted to evaluate these CPEs, and the corresponding results indicated that these CPEs were capable of achieving high efficiency in both fullerene PSCs and non-fullerene PSCs when used as ETMs. Thereinto, a high PCE of 16.25% was achieved when PM6:Y6 was used as the active layer. The study concerning thickness-related performance correction demonstrated that these CPEs tolerated a high thickness (10–100 nm) due to their high mobilities. These results indicate that these CPEs are potential candidates as universal and thickness-insensitive ETMs for future large-area PSCs.

Experimental section
The synthetic routes of monomers M0–M3 are shown in ESI,† Scheme S1. The detailed procedures are presented in the experimental part of the ESI.†
Synthesis of neutral polymers: PNDTN, PNDION and PNDTOON
For a typical DAP synthesis, the monomers M0 (0.20 mmol) and M1 (or M2, M3, 0.20 mmol) were added to 1.5 mL of trimethylbenzene, followed by the addition of pivalic acid (25.0 mg) and K2CO3 (103.5 mg). Afterwards, the reaction was degassed two times. Pd2(dba)3 (2.0 mg) was added and the reaction was degassed once again. The reaction was then heated up to 115 °C and stirred for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was poured into methanol, accompanied with the formation of dark precipitates, which were then collected and successively extracted with methanol, hexane, acetone, and chloroform by Soxhlet extraction. The chloroform fraction was concentrated and precipitated into methanol. The dark precipitates were collected and dried at room temperature under vacuum for 24 h.

PNDTN: 87%. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.85–8.70 (2H), 7.40–7.28 (3H), 4.25–4.05 (4H), 2.75–3.05 (2H), 2.65–2.35 (m, 18H), 2.25–1.95 (4H), 1.95–1.70 (2H), 1.45–1.30 (18H), 1.15–0.95 (18H). GPC(CHCl3), Mn = 20.7k, Mw = 59.7k.

PNDTON: 92%. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.95–8.70 (2H), 7.10–6.75 (3H), 4.45–3.75 (6H), 2.70–2.35 (m, 18H), 2.25–2.05 (4H), 1.95–1.75 (2H), 1.65–1.35 (18H), 1.10–0.95 (18H). GPC (CHCl3), Mn = 29.1k, Mw = 58.5k.

PNDTOON: 91%. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.90–8.70 (2H), 7.20–6.95 (2H), 4.45–3.85 (8H), 2.70–2.35 (m, 18H), 2.25–1.35 (24H), 1.10–0.75 (18H). GPC (CHCl3), Mn = 28.4k, Mw = 49.4k.
Synthesis of PNDT, PNDIO, and PNDTOO
For a typical quaternization, 100 mg of PNDTN (PNDION or PNDTOON) was dissolved in 25 mL of toluene, followed by the addition of 1 mL of bromoethane. The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 72 h, accompanied with the addition of 5 mL of methanol every 12 h. Then the reaction solution was concentrated and precipitated into a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v). The solid was collected and dissolved in methanol and precipitated into a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate again. Finally, the dark solid polymer (PNDT: 109 mg, 81%; PNDTO: 114 mg, 86%; PNDT: 111 mg, 84%) was collected and dried under vacuum for 12 h.
Polymer characterization

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data of the monomers (M0–M3) and the polymers were recorded on Bruker AVANCE digital NMR workstations operating at 500 MHz and 126 MHz, respectively. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of these CPEs were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of CPEs were collected on a CHI-660E electrochemical workstation with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and a Pt sheet as the counter electrode. A glassy carbon electrode coated by a thin layer of CPE was used as the working electrode. CV measurement was performed in Bu4NPF6-based acetonitrile solution (0.1 M) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under the protection of N2. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) showed a reference potential of 0.35 V vs. SCE. The molecular weight of the neutral polymers (PNDTN, PNDTON and PNDTOON) was collected using Waters GPC 2410 with CHCl3 as the mobile phase.

PSC device fabrication. 
The PSC devices were fabricated using different donor:acceptor combinations (NT812:PC71BM, PBDB-2Cl:ITIC-2F and PM6:Y6). The thicknesses of the optimal active layers based on NT812:PC71BM, PBDB-2Cl:ITIC-2F, and PM6:Y6 are 300 nm, 100 nm, and 150 nm, respectively. The CPEs were spin-coated onto the active layer from methanol solution with different concentrations (1 mg mL−1, 2 mg mL−1, 5 mg mL−1, and 10 mg mL−1), resulting in varied thicknesses (10–100 nm). The PSC devices were characterized in the dark or under illumination of AM 1.5G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm2. Electron-only devices with architectures of ITO/Al/PBDB-2Cl:ITIC-2F (100 nm)/CPEs (10–100 nm)/Al were prepared and the electron mobilities of the polyelectrolytes were extracted by fitting the data using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of 4,9-dibromo-2,7-bis(6-(diethylamino)hexyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone (M0), 6-([2,2′-bithiophen]-3-yl)-N,N-diethylhexan-1-amine (M1), 6-([2,2′-bithiophen]-3-yloxy)-N,N-diethylhexan-1-amine (M2), and 6,6′-([2,2′-bithiophene]-3,3′-diylbis(oxy))bis(N,N-diethylhexan-1-amine) (M3) are shown in the ESI.† The monomers were characterized by 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR (Fig. S1–S8, ESI†). The designed CPEs were synthesized according to the steps shown in Scheme 2. First, the neutral polymers (PNDTN, PNDTON and PNDTOON) were synthesized via the DAP protocol from the dibromo-substituted monomer (M0) and bithiophene monomers (M1, M2, and M3).49–51 Compared to the widely-used Stille coupling polymerization, the DAP protocol is non-toxic, simple, straightforward, and environmentally friendly, which is suitable for the scalable production of ETMs for commercial application of PSCs.49–51 Unlike Stille coupling, which adopts toxic tin-based compounds as reagents, the DAP protocol here could directly employ bithiophene monomers as reagents, thus simplifying the synthesis procedure and avoiding the use of toxic tin-based monomers. The number-average molecular weights of PNDTN, PNDTON and PNDTOON were determined (by GPC with CHCl3 as the mobile phase) to be 20.7 K, 29.1 K and 28.4 K (Fig. S9–S11, ESI†), respectively. Notably, the molecular weights of the CPEs used here are comparable to those of the previously reported DAP-synthesized N2200 polymers,49 indicating that DAP serves as a universal synthetic protocol to prepare various types of conjugated polymers. CPEs (PNDT, PNDTO, and PNDTOO) were prepared from their neutral precursors and bromoethane through post quaternization. The side chains of the CPEs here are all quaternized ammonium salts, thus endowing them with good solubility (over 12 mg mL−1) and processability in alcohol-like solvents. The processability of these CPEs could enable the orthogonal processing of multilayer PSCs in combination with the low-polar solvent-processed active layers. For the fabrication of PSC devices, the CPEs were dissolved in methanol with different concentrations and spin-coated onto the active layer of PSCs to obtain varied layer thicknesses.

The UV-vis-NIR absorption of PNDT, PNDTO, and PNDTOO in solution and the thin-film state was examined and the results are shown in Fig. 1a and b. For the absorption spectrum of PNDT in the solution state, a band covering 500–900 nm with a peak at 644 nm originating from intramolecular charge transfer was observed. Compared to N2200, PNDT showed a much blunter peak, which can be attributed to its disorder aggregation caused by its quaternized ammonium side chains. PNDTO showed red-shifted absorption compared to PNDT. The oxygen atom in the alkoxy substituted ammonium side chains of PNDTO could enhance the electron-donating capability of the bithiophene unit, resulting in strengthened intramolecular charge transfer and narrowed band gaps.52,53 In contrast, PNDTOO showed an even more obvious red-shifted absorption spectrum with the peak approaching 1200 nm. The absorption spectra of these CPEs in the thin-film state were red-shifted in comparison with those in solution, indicating the presence of aggregation in their thin films. Compared to PNDT, the absorption in the visible range of PNDTO and PNDTOO was much lower as the absorption spectra gradually red-shifted. The absorption edges of these CPEs were examined to be 898 nm, 976 nm, and 1227 nm for PNDT, PNDTO, and PNDTOO, respectively. Consequently, PNDT, PNDTO, and PNDTOO are considered to be typical near-infrared semiconductors with optical band gaps of 1.38, 1.27, and 1.01 eV, respectively. The apparent shifts of the absorption and bad gaps for PNDTO and PNDTOO indicate that the alkoxy substituted side chains are effective tools for tuning the optical properties of the conjugated polymers.

The redox potential of these CPEs was evaluated via CV analysis. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of these CPEs were calculated using the following equations: ELUMO = −e(Ere + 4.42) (eV) and EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.42) (eV) (Ere, reduction potential; Eox, oxidation potential). As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), PNDT, PNDTO, and PNDTOO exhibited consecutively lowered reduction potentials (Eres) of −0.61 V, −0.64 V, and −0.69 V, respectively. Accordingly, their LUMO energy levels were thus calculated to be −3.81 eV, −3.78 eV, and −3.73 eV, respectively (Table 1), indicating that the alkyl and alkoxy substituents in the bithiophene units could effectively promote the LUMO energy levels of the conjugated polymers. The Eoxs values of PNDT, PNDTO, and PNDTOO were found to be 0.88 V, 0.60 V, and 0.39 V, respectively, and their HOMO energy levels were thus calculated to be −5.30 eV, −5.02 eV, and −4.81 eV, respectively.

The upshifted LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the CPEs could significantly affect their self-doping behaviors. Generally, n-type conjugated backbones with stronger electron-accepting capability are more prone to stabilize radical anions, resulting in enhanced doping levels.54 Self-doping behaviors could promote the charge transporting properties and the interface modification capability of n-type semiconductors, resulting in an enhanced photovoltaic performance.55–57 To further investigate the difference of their self-doping behaviors, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was employed, which is capable of providing direct evidence of the presence of free radical anions. CPEs in equal amounts in the solid state were subjected to EPR testing, and the obtained curves are shown in Fig. 1d. All the CPEs delivered a g value of 2.003, suggesting the formation of unpaired electrons and the occurrence of self-doping behaviors. It can be seen that the EPR of PNDT is significantly stronger than that of PNDTO and PNDTOO. This can be mainly attributed to the deeper LUMO energy level of the former, which is beneficial for the stabilization of the radical anions.54PNDTO showed a moderate EPR signal intensity. Compared to PNDT and PNDTO, PNDTOO possesses higher-density ammonium side chains and counterions. However, this does not lead to a higher EPR signal intensity due to its upshifted LUMO energy level. A similar trend was also observed in their neutral precursor polymers (Fig. S13, ESI†). The much weaker EPR signal intensity of PNDTOO was attributed to the reduced electron-accepting capability of its backbone,58 indicating the importance of regulation of the energy levels to achieve the desired doping behaviors.

Photovoltaic performance of fullerene-based PSCs
The combined advantages of these CPEs indicate great potential in improving the interface contact of PSCs. In particular, the high-mobility characteristic of these CPEs offers an advantage for using thick ETMs in PSCs.59–61 To evaluate the potential of these CPEs as ETMs for PSCs, fullerene-based PSCs with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/NT812:PC71BM/CPE/Ag were first fabricated, where a narrow bandgap polymer donor NT81262 and PC71BM (Fig. 2) were utilized as photoactive materials. The thickness of the CPE films upon the active layer was found to be 10, 20, 50, and 100 nm by adjusting both the spin-coating speed and the solution concentration of CPEs. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics recorded under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) of the PNDT-based photovoltaic devices are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. When a 10 nm PNDT was applied, the PSC device delivered an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.73 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.39 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 68.67%, and a resultant PCE of 9.66%. The relatively lower FF in the device with a very thin CPE layer could be attributed to the aggregation of PNDT, which might hinder the complete coverage upon the active layer. Interestingly, the devices with 20 nm PNDT could boost the FF to 70.97%, resulting in a higher PCE of 10.09%. The good interface modification capability of PNDT could be attributed to the advantages of quaternized CPEs, including work function modulation, reduced energy barrier, and induced interface doping.63–67 In particular, the Br− in PNDT could n-dope PC71BM at the active layer/ETM interface, thus enhancing the electron collection in the PSC devices.55 Increasing the thickness of PNDT to 50 nm enabled a similar PCE of 10.07%, indicating that the device performance is less sensitive to the thickness of PNDT. Notable is that the FF in the device with 50 nm PNDT still remained over 70%, reaching a maximum value of 72.47%. When the thickness of PNDT was further increased to 100 nm, a high PCE of 9% was achieved. Compared to the devices with thinner (20 nm or 50 nm) PNDT, the devices with 100 nm PNDT showed slightly reduced JSC of 17.83 mA cm−2. The reduced JSCs were verified from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices (Fig. 3b). An apparent EQE loss can be observed in the range from 500 nm to 800 nm in the device with PNDT (100 nm) in comparison with that with thinner ETMs (10 nm to 50 nm). Nevertheless, the FF in the device with 100 nm PNDT is still higher than 70%, which can be attributed to its high mobility and good interface modification capability.

The application of PNDTO and PNDTOO as ETMs in PSCs was investigated. Similar to the situation in PNDT-based PSCs, a thin layer of PNDTO and PNDTOO also enables a moderate FF of 67.5% and 68.1% in the PSCs, respectively. However, much thicker layers of PNDTO and PNDTOO could boost the FFs of the corresponding devices to over 70%. The devices with 50 nm and 100 nm PNDTO showed high FFs of 70.66% and 72.57%, resulting in PCEs of 9.30% and 9.24%, respectively. The devices with 50 nm and 100 nm PNDTOO showed a similar phenomenon, indicating that these CPEs possess excellent thickness-insensitive feature.
Photovoltaic performance of non-fullerene PSCs
Recently, the development of non-fullerene electron acceptors has boosted the efficiency of PSCs. To evaluate the potential of these CPEs as ETMs in non-fullerene solar cells, devices with the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-2Cl:ITIC-2F/CPEs/Ag were fabricated, where poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-chloro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-2Cl) was used as the polymer donor and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC-2F)68 (Fig. 2) was used as the acceptor. The J–V curves of the non-fullerene PSCs are shown in Fig. 4a, and their relevant parameters are summarized in Table 3. The devices with a very thin layer (10 nm) of PNDT delivered a VOC of 0.87 V, a JSC of 21.29 mA cm−2, an FF of 72.69%, and a corresponding PCE of 13.16%. Increasing the thickness of PNDT improves the PCE to 13.33%, which mainly originated from the enhanced FF of 74.63%. Interestingly, the FF of the devices could be further enhanced when a thicker PNDT was applied, indicating the excellent charge transporting properties of PNDT. However, the current density of the devices showed an apparent decline when the thickness increases. In particular, a JSC of 16.66 mA cm−2 was obtained for the device with 100 nm PNDT, which is much lower than that (JSC of 19.58 mA cm−2) for the device with 50 nm PNDT.

A similar trend in JSC and FF was observed for devices with PNDTO and PNDTOO as ETMs. Although the JSC exhibited a decline in the devices with thick PNDTO and PNDTOO, the FF was maintained at a high level. For the devices with 50 nm and 100 nm PNDTO, the JSC decreased from over 21 mA cm−2 for the thin layer PNDTO-based device to 20.07 (50 nm) and 16.45 mA cm−2 (100 nm), respectively, while the FFs improved from 69.14% to 74.29% and 73.49%, respectively. For the devices with 50 nm and 100 nm PNDTOO, the JSC decreased from over 21 mA cm−2 to 19.97 and 16.00 mA cm−2, respectively, while the FFs improved from 70.63% to 76.27% and 75.90%, respectively. One interesting phenomenon is that these CPEs maintain higher HOMO energy levels (−5.30 eV to −4.81 eV) than ITIC-2F (−5.66 eV); however, no apparent leakage in JSC was observed although a high-lying HOMO in the ETM might be much easier for hole (in the active layer) diffusion, resulting in a reduced JSC. This can be explained by the ammonium side chains of CPEs, which could suppress hole diffusion by trapping the holes in the ETM layer.69
Compared to the situation in NT812:PC71BM-based fullerene PSCs, the decline of the JSCs in PBDB-2Cl:ITIC-2F-based non-fullerene PSCs with the increased ETM thickness becomes more significant. The JSC loss for the fullerene PSCs (ETM thickness from 10 nm to 100 nm) is 1–1.5 mA cm−2, while that for the non-fullerene PSCs is around 4 mA cm−2. This difference could be interpreted by the thickness variation of the active layers, since the active layers of PBDB-2Cl:ITIC-2F are only 100 nm thick, while the active layers of NT812:PC71BM are around 300 nm thick. Thicker active layers would be more favourable for light harvesting and reducing the photo flux entering into the ETM layer. The decline of the JSCs in the non-fullerene devices was studied by comparing the EQE loss (ΔEQE, calculated by subtracting the EQE of the device with 10 nm ETM from the EQE of the device with 20–100 nm ETM) in the devices with thicker ETMs. From Fig. S14a–c (ESI†), it can be observed that the EQE loss (ΔEQE) in the devices with thicker ETMs (PNDT, PNDTO and PNDTOO) is very similar, in the range of 500–850 nm. The ΔEQE spectra showed a similar shape with the absorption of PBDB-2Cl:ITIC-2F, indicating that the ΔEQEs in the devices with thicker ETMs are mainly attributed to the absorption loss of the active layers. These phenomena could be explained by the change of the optical field distribution in the active layers.70,71 The EQE loss in the range of 400–450 nm could be explained by the change in the reflectance spectra of the devices with thick ETMs.72 In addition, it could be useful to reduce the JSC loss of the devices even with thick ETMs as long as the thickness of the active layers can be further increased over 300 nm (similar to that of NT812:PC71BM), suggesting the importance of developing novel active layers that can work well with large thicknesses.
To explain the charge transporting characteristic of the thick ETMs in PSCs, we fabricated bilayer electron-only devices with the structure of ITO/Al/PBDB-2Cl:ITIC-2F/ETM(10–100 nm)/Al, where the thickness of ETMs varied from 10 nm to 100 nm. The electron mobilities are summarized in Table 4. The device with 10 nm PNDT exhibited an electron mobility of 2.55 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The electron mobilities of the devices with 20, 50, and 100 nm PNDT improved to 3.02 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.54 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4.67 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The improved electron mobilities of the devices with thick PNDT demonstrate that PNDT possesses the capability to fabricate thick films without charge loss. Moreover, the devices with 20 nm, 50 nm, and 100 nm PNDTO also showed gradually enhanced electron mobilities of 1.82 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.79 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.66 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison with that (1.01 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the device with 10 nm PNDTO. This phenomenon is identical for all the electron-only devices with different CPEs. However, the electron-only devices with PNDT possess higher electron mobilities than those with PNDTO or PNDTOO when the thicknesses of ETMs are the same, indicating that PNDT exhibits better charge transporting properties. The trend in the electron mobility of these CPEs also coincides well with the above-mentioned result that PNDT achieves a slightly better photovoltaic performance than PNDTO and PNDTOO.

The compatibility of these CPEs towards different donors:acceptors was also explored. The polymer donor poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PM6) and the acceptor 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methany-lylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6)73 were employed to fabricate the PSC devices and a thin layer of PNDT was used as the ETM. As shown in Fig. 5, 10 nm PNDT could achieve efficient PSC devices with a VOC of 0.83 V, a high JSC of 26.50 mA cm−2, an FF of 72.02%, and a resultant PCE of 16.25%. The generated JSC is confirmed by the EQE spectrum of these devices, which showed a high response of nearly 80% in the range from 450 nm to 850 nm. The high efficiency also suggested that PNDT possessed excellent compatibility with different active layers for PSCs. Recently, the rapid development of polymer donors and molecular acceptors has significantly promoted the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, thus developing universal ETMs that can match with the updated active layers becomes critically important. The combined advantages of these CPEs, including excellent interface modification, high mobility and good compatibility, make them promising candidates for large-area PSCs based on novel and high-performance donors:acceptors.

Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a series of NDI-based conjugated polyelectrolytes, which act as universal and thickness-insensitive ETMs for PSCs. The substitution of the conjugated backbones with alkyl and alkoxy-based ammonium side chains altered the absorption spectra, energy levels, and doping behaviors of these CPEs. The good interface modification capability of these CPEs achieved high-performance PSCs with over 16% PCE when PM6:Y6 was used as the active layer. The advantages of the CPEs, such as a facile DAP synthesis protocol, excellent interface modification, high electron mobility to achieve thick ETM films, and good compatibility with different active layers, make them excellent candidates as universal and thickness-insensitive ETMs for large-area PSCs.
