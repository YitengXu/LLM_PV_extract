    , Accepted 2nd October 2017First published on 17th October 2017AbstractRecent advancements in colloidal chemistry offer unique opportunities to construct core/shell semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) with tailored optical properties. Major efforts have been focused on synthesizing core/shell NCs via heteroepitaxial growth, which often leads to effective surface passivation and thus reduced trap states (TS). However, the growth of a shell with a wider band gap or energy band offset tends to form a physical barrier for the migration of photo-generated charge carriers to the surrounding environment, resulting in compromised photoactivity. Here, we show that the homoepitaxial growth of NCs is able to facilitate the passivation of TS without affecting the migration of charge carriers to the surface of NCs. Homostructured CdShomo NCs have demonstrated improved photocatalytic hydrogen production compared with the CdS core NCs and heterostructured CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs in terms of both efficiency and photostability. We envision that homoepitaxial growth would provide new opportunities to tailor semiconductor NCs for photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications.
1. Introduction
Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are among the most promising next-generation optoelectronic materials for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications due to their unique properties, such as large extinction coefficients over a broad spectral range, long exciton lifetimes, tunable band gap, and carrier multiplication effect.1–5 Great efforts have been made in controlling the size, morphology and surface chemistry of a wide spectrum of semiconductor NCs, with an ultimate goal towards tailoring separation and recombination of photo-induced charge carriers in the NCs.6–10 For photo-induced H2 production, trap states (TS) may act as carrier traps or non-radiative recombination centers, thereby significantly affecting the photoluminescence properties, the lifetime of photo-generated carriers, and the photocatalytic activity. Thus, strategies that allow us to minimize TS and bulk/surface charge recombination/capture are being intensively researched to achieve efficient charge separation and fast charge transport.11,12
In heterostructured core/shell NCs with different band alignments of the core and shell materials, such as type I CdS/ZnS, CdSe/CdS and type II ZnSe/CdS, the growth of an outer layer shell has been proven to be an effective way to passivate the TS by reducing the dangling bonds on the surface.13–19 However, the majority of the core/shell NCs produced by heteroepitaxial growth have a shell with a wider band gap or energy band offset, which in turn creates a physical barrier to confine electrons and/or holes in their cores, leading to suppressed photocatalytic activity or poor photostability.15,20–24 New strategies such as the etching strategy or mesoporous shell growth were developed to “lift” the barrier and make both donor/acceptor components of the heteroepitaxial core/shell structures accessible to the external environment.25,26 Nevertheless, the effective separation of electrons and holes and transfer of electron/hole pairs from the core to the outer surface remain a topic of considerable interest for photocatalysis.
Here, we report the synthesis of homostructured CdS (CdShomo) NCs by homoepitaxial growth on CdS core NCs, which gives rise to effective passivation of TS on resulting NCs without imposing transport barriers for electrons and holes. Therefore, the homoepitaxial growth could suppress the detrimental nonradiative recombination of charge carriers, resulting in a considerably enhanced photocatalytic activity of CdShomo NCs compared to that of the heterostructured CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs. The CdShomo–Pt photocatalyst system led to a maximum H2 evolution rate of 2963 μmol h−1 (λ ≥ 420 nm) with a maximum quantum efficiency (QE) of 70.0% at 420 nm, and exhibited better stability for visible light driven H2 evolution compared to that of a heterostructured CdS/ZnS–Pt photocatalyst system.
2. Experimental
Synthesis of CdS core NCs
CdS core NCs were synthesized via a hot-injection procedure.27 Typically, a mixture of cadmium oxide (CdO, 0.512 g, 4 mmol), oleic acid (OA, 5.0 mL), and 1-octadecene (ODE, 15.0 mL) in a 50 mL three-neck flask was heated to 300 °C under a N2 atmosphere until the solution turned optically clear and colorless. At this point, 2 mL of S-TOP solution (2 mol L−1, prepared by dissolving sulfur in trioctylphosphine (TOP)) was quickly injected, and the temperature was maintained at 260 °C for the growth of CdS NCs from 30 s to 20 min. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 60 °C and 10.0 mL of hexane/CH3OH (v/v, 1:1) was used as the extraction solvent to separate the nanocrystals from the byproducts and unreacted precursors. The as-prepared CdS NCs were purified by repeated precipitation with ethanol and centrifugation. The purified CdS NCs were redispersed in hexane at a concentration of 0.2 mol L−1 for the next step.
Preparation of cadmium diethyldithiocarbamate (Cd(DDTC)2) and zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (Zn(DDTC)2)
In a typical synthesis of Cd(DDTC)2, cadmium chloride hydrate (2.75 g, 15 mmol) was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water in a 400 mL beaker. Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (6.759 g, 30 mmol) was dissolved in 60 mL of distilled water and added dropwise to the cadmium chloride solution with vigorous stirring. The appearance of a white precipitate indicated the formation of cadmium diethyldithiocarbamate (Cd(DDTC)2), and the mixture was continuously stirred for 1 h and filtered on a Buchner funnel. The white precipitate was washed three times with distilled water and dried under vacuum. For the preparation of Zn(DDTC)2, zinc acetate dihydrate (3.359 g, 15 mmol) was used to replace cadmium chloride hydrate, and other experimental conditions were kept the same.
Epitaxial growth of a CdS or ZnS layer on the CdS core NCs
For the growth of a CdS layer, oleylamine (OAm, 2.0 mL) and ODE (4.0 mL) were added to the purified CdS core solution (0.5 mmol), followed by the addition of Cd(DDTC)2, the system was degassed under 80 °C for 30 min to remove hexane and water, and then refilled with N2. The reaction temperature was maintained at 140 °C for 30 min. For the growth of a ZnS layer, Zn(DDTC)2 was added to the system to replace Cd(DDTC)2, and other experimental conditions were kept the same. In order to control the growth thickness of the epitaxial layer, different amounts of Cd(DDTC)2 or Zn(DDTC)2 (0.1 mmol, 0.25 mmol, 0.5 mmol and 0.75 mmol) were used. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 60 °C and 10.0 mL of hexane/CH3OH (v/v, 1:1) was used as the extraction solvent to separate the nanocrystals from the byproducts and unreacted precursors. The as-prepared CdShomo NCs or CdS/ZnS NCs were purified by repeated precipitation with ethanol and centrifugation and were redispersed in hexane at a concentration of 0.2 mol L−1 for the next step.
Preparation of water dispersible NCs by ligand exchange
The as-prepared oil-soluble CdS NCs, CdShomo NCs or CdS/ZnS NCs underwent ligand exchange by mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) to replace the initial hydrophobic surfactants (TOP and/or OA/OAm). Firstly, 2 mmol of MPA was dissolved in 5.0 mL of methanol. The MPA–methanol solution was adjusted to pH 10.0 with 40% NaOH solution, and then added to the hydrophobic NC n-hexanes solution (0.025 mol L−1, 20.0 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h to obtain the precipitated NCs, and was stirred for another 10 min after the addition of 20.0 mL water. The solution was separated into two phases eventually, with CdS NCs, CdShomo NCs or CdS/ZnS NCs transferred into the underlying water from the above hexane phase. Afterwards, the above organic phase was discarded and the aqueous phase was collected. The free MPA ligand in the aqueous phase was isolated by precipitating the NCs with acetone. The supernatant was discarded and the NC pellet was then redissolved in water for the next step.
Synthesis of Pt nanocrystals
The dendritic Pt nanocrystals were synthesized by using L-ascorbic acid (L-AA) as the reductant. 25 mg H2PtCl6·6H2O was mixed with 320 μL of a 155.2 mol L−1 tri-sodium citrate solution, and then heated to 100 °C, followed by the addition of 6 mL of 0.1 M L-AA. After the reaction for 10 min at 100 °C, the Pt NCs were obtained.
Photocatalytic activity measurements
Visible-light-driven H2 evolution reactions were conducted in a closed gas circulation–evacuation system fitted with a top window Pyrex cell. In each run, 100 mg of CdS core NCs, CdShomo NCs or CdS/ZnS NCs and Pt co-catalyst were well dispersed under constant stirring in a 100 mL of aqueous dispersion containing 20 vol% of L-(+)-lactic acid. The system was evacuated and refilled with argon several times to remove air trapped inside and finally refilled with 30 Torr of argon before the photoreaction. The photocatalytic H2 evolution reactions were carried out using a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). The produced H2 was detected using an online gas chromatograph. The activities were calculated based on the H2 evolution in the first 4 h of the reaction. The quantum efficiency (QE) was measured under the same reaction conditions except that a band pass interference filter (center wavelength at 420 nm, bandwidth of 10 nm) was equipped to provide photons with wavelengths between 415 and 425 nm. In a typical calculation of the QE, irradiation power density at 420 nm in terms of watts per unit area was measured to be 1 mW cm−2 by a photodiode. The spot diameter of the irradiation was 6 cm. For 1 h irradiation, the total number of incident photons can be subsequently obtained since the wavelength of the photons and the Planck constant are known. (1)
Fabrication of the CdS, CdShomo and CdS/ZnS electrodes
The tin doped indium oxide on glass (ITO; resistivity <15 Ω) was used as the substrate for electrodes, and was cleaned by sonication sequentially for 20 min each in acetone, 10% KOH in ethanol and doubly deionized water. After the treatment, an adhesive plaster mask (3 M, USA) with a round hole of ca. 0.19 cm2 (diameter: 0.5 cm) was covered on the ITO, then 100 μL of CdS, CdShomo or CdS/ZnS suspension (10 mg mL−1) was dropped on the round hole of the cleaned electrode surface and was dried at room temperature. Finally, the adhesive plaster mask was removed and the resulting electrode was used for photocurrent measurement.
Photocurrent measurement
Photocurrent was measured by using an electro-chemical analyzer (CHI660D electrochemical workstation) in a standard three-electrode system using the prepared sample electrodes as the working electrodes with an active area of ca. 0.19 cm2, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as a reference electrode. A 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as a light source. Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.2 mol L−1) was used as the electrolyte.
Materials characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA. The UV-vis absorption spectra and fluorescence spectra were obtained using a UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) and FluoroMax-3 (Horiba, Japan) fluorometer, respectively. The morphology, particle size, and lattice fringes were analyzed using a TEM (JEOL 2010, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Lifetime studies were performed with an Edinburgh instrument lifeSpec-ps F900 photocounting system with a 370 nm Hamamatsu C8898 picosecond light pulser as the excitation source. The luminescence time range was detected at 0–200 ns. Data analysis was conducted by iterative convolution of the luminescence decay profile with the instrument response function using the software package provided by Edinburgh Instruments.
3. Results and discussion
Structure analysis
The single precursors that contain both anionic and cationic elements in one precursor have been previously reported for the heteroepitaxial growth of a shell on the surface of semiconductor NCs. The overall quality of NCs prepared by the single precursor approach was found to be superior to those yielded by the quasi-single precursor approach, thermal-cycling coupled successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (TC-SILAR) method etc.28–32 As shown in Fig. 1A, Cd(DDTC)2 served as the precursor in our work for the homoepitaxial growth of a CdS layer around the CdS core NCs since it can decompose gradually at high temperature in the presence of organic amine.32 TEM results show that the size of CdShomo NCs exhibits a gradual increase compared to those of the highly monodispersed CdS core NCs (Fig. 1B). Clearly, with the introduction of Cd(DDTC)2, more CdS deposited around the CdS core to afford the homoepitaxial growth of CdShomo NCs. The size, shape and size/shape distribution of the CdShomo NCs were well controlled. As shown in Fig. 1C–E, taking the initial CdS core size of 3.6 ± 0.3 nm into account, the thicknesses of the CdS layer around the CdS core were 0.33, 0.75 and 1.5 nm by the addition of 0.10, 0.25 and 0.75 mmol of Cd(DDTC)2 respectively, which correspond to about 1 monolayer (1 ML), 2 monolayers (2 ML) and 4 monolayers (4 ML) of CdS shell deposition (the thickness of the CdS monolayer is about 0.35 nm).31 To confirm the role of Cd(DDTC)2 in CdS shell growth, the CdS3.6 nm core NCs heated in the absence of Cd(DDTC)2 were used as a control. TEM observation shows no increase of the particle size, and there was no red-shift of the absorption peak and the photoluminescence (PL) emission peak (data not shown here). Thus, the increase of the particle size was reasonably ascribed to the decomposition of the Cd(DDTC)2 precursor. The corresponding HRTEM images of the four samples in the insets of Fig. 1B–E reveal that both CdS core NCs and CdShomo NCs are single crystalline and fringes with a lattice spacing of ca. 0.35 nm, which corresponds to the (200) plane of the zinc-blende lattice structure.

The powder XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2A all display three diffraction peaks at 26.5°, 44.0°, and 52.1°, which match well with the main (111) and the two weaker (220) and (311) reflections of the standard zinc-blende CdS (JCPDS 80-0019), revealing that both CdS core NCs and CdShomo NCs possess a zinc-blende crystal structure. These results are consistent with the HRTEM measurements (Fig. 1B–E). It is interesting that in the absence of the CdS core, the Cd(DDTC)2 precursor decomposed to form CdS nanorods (see Fig. S1A, ESI†) with a wurtzite-phase structure in the OAm system (see Fig. S1B, ESI†).31 The results above confirm that the CdS core NCs with a sphere morphology and zinc-blende structure led to the homoepitaxial growth of a zinc-blende CdS layer in the sphere morphology.

Fig. 2B shows a series of normalized UV-vis absorption spectra and PL emission spectra of CdShomo NCs with different shell thicknesses. For the CdS3.6 nm core NCs, a strong band edge emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM, <30 nm) was observed accompanied by a wide deep trap emission in the longer wavelength range. The absorption spectrum of CdS3.6 nm core NCs exhibits a well-resolved first absorption extinction peak at 463 nm (band gap = 2.68 eV) arising from the electronic transition of 1S(e)–1S2/3(h). With the growth of a CdS layer of varying thickness, both the band edge emission peak in the PL spectra and the first extinction absorption peak in the UV-vis spectra shifted systematically to a longer wavelength without any broadening of the PL peak. Remarkably, the deep-trap emission in the longer-wavelength range decreased steadily with increasing shell thickness (inset in Fig. 2B). The PL intensity of the CdShomo NCs increased steadily and reached the maximum at 2 ML of shell thickness, which decreased gradually with a further increase of shell thickness (Fig. 2C). The optical evolution of the CdShomo NCs is different from the same size CdS NCs prepared without Cd(DDTC)2.33 For the latter, the intensity of the band edge emission decreased steadily accompanied by the monotonous increasing of the deep-trap emission (see Fig. S2, ESI†). In addition, the UV-vis spectra of the CdShomo NCs are also different from the CdS nanorods prepared by direct decomposition of Cd(DDTC)2. Compared with the absorption at 468–488 nm of CdShomo NCs, the latter shows an absorption peak at a shorter wavelength of 450 nm (see Fig. S1C, ESI†). It was reported that metal dithiocarbamate could decompose into metal sulfide and H2S,34 which could subsequently be adsorbed onto the NCs,35 thus affecting the optical properties of the NCs. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to study the dynamics of the photo-generated charge carriers. Fig. 2D illustrates the time decay of the CdShomo NCs with different shell thicknesses. Compared with the fast time decay of 0.36 ns for CdS core NCs, photoluminescence lifetime significantly prolonged to 4.04 ns and 14.01 ns with the increasing shell thickness to 1 ML and 2 ML, respectively. The 38.9 fold increase in the lifetime of charge carriers for the CdShomo-2ML NCs could be explained by both the increase of radiative recombination of photo-generated carriers and the decrease of non-radiative recombination on the surface of NCs.36 However, with a further increase in the shell thickness to 4 ML, the lifetime was shortened to 0.82 ns. Generally, the NCs with anion dominated surfaces usually show an overwhelming amount of TS, which could trap charge carriers, leading to reduced overlap between electrons and holes and increased probability of non-radiative decay events.5 The trend of the lifetime was similar to that of the PL intensity with the increasing shell thickness, indicating that the growth of the CdS passivation shell could largely remove TS, increase PL intensity, and lead to prolonged PL lifetime.
XPS characterization was carried out to reveal the surface chemical composition of the well washed nanoparticles (see Fig. 3 and Table 1). It showed that the surface S/Cd ratios calculated by the total Cd and S content in the XPS survey spectra are 1.05, 0.71, and 0.94 respectively for the CdS core, CdShomo-2ML NCs and CdShomo-4ML NCs. These results suggest that the Cd2+-dominated surface could lead to PL enhancement, which matches well with the efficient passivation of TS and improvement of PL intensity under proper manipulation of the surface stoichiometry by shell growth.30,37 The well-known type I CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs were also synthesized using Zn(DDTC)2 as the shell precursor. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the growth of the ZnS shell resulted in the increase of particle sizes, which were consistent with the number of ZnS monolayers of 2 ML and 4 ML. The powder XRD patterns in Fig. S2 (ESI†) reveal that CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs are also in zinc-blende crystal structures. With the increasing ZnS shell thickness, the XRD peaks shifted gradually from those corresponding to CdS to those more similar to the ZnS diffraction peaks. All of these crystal structure features demonstrated the successful growth of ZnS shells onto CdS core NCs.32

As shown in Fig. 4A and B, the PL and UV spectra of CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs with increasing shell thickness demonstrated that the PL intensity of CdS/ZnS NCs increased steadily on decrease of deep trap emission up to four monolayers of the ZnS shell. Combined with the PL results of CdShomo NCs, we can conclude that both CdS and the ZnS shell could smooth the original core surface and remove TS, thus resulting in the localization of charge carriers along with the pathways of surface radiative recombination sites. It brings forward the remarkable enhancement of the band gap emission and the reduction of the deep-trap emission for CdShomo NC structures compared to the original CdS3.6 nm core NCs. In order to further confirm the impact of TS on the PL intensity and lifetime, the exciton decay dynamics of CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs were also studied (Fig. 4C). With increasing shell thickness of ZnS to 1 ML, 2 ML and 4 ML, the lifetime increased monotonously to 9.32 ns, 11.18 ns and 11.24 ns respectively, which is in line with the monotonous increase in the PL intensity. These results collectively confirm that the growth of the passivation layer could lead to a longer lifetime of the charge carriers, which is beneficial for the reduction of H+ or oxidation of sacrificial reagents, thus promoting the activities for H2 production. The CdShomo-2ML and CdS/ZnS2ML NCs were then transferred to aqueous solution for H2 evolution. Of note is that the PL intensity (Fig. 4D) of CdShomo-2ML NCs was nearly completely quenched, whereas the photoluminescence of the CdS/ZnS2ML NCs retained after phase transfer by MPA. This demonstrates that the ZnS shell with a wider band gap gave rise to more significant trapping of electrons inside the inner CdS core than the CdS shell in CdShomo NCs.

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
In this study, the photocatalytic performance of the CdS NCs, CdShomo and CdS/ZnS NCs was investigated by using 1.5 wt% Pt NCs as a co-catalyst. As shown in Fig. 5A, the CdS3.6 nm–Pt sample afforded a H2 evolution rate of 1670 μmol h−1 with a QE of 39.4% at 420 nm. With the increasing of shell thickness, H2 production rate of the CdShomo–Pt samples rose steadily and reached as high as 2963 μmol h−1 after the growth of 2 ML of CdS, which decreased slightly to 2386 μmol h−1 for CdShomo-4ML. Notably, the H2 production rate of CdShomo-4ML–Pt was still higher than that of CdS core–Pt (1670 μmol h−1) and CdS nanorod–Pt (1885 μmol h−1) (see Fig. S3, ESI†), underlining the significance of surface passivation by homoepitaxial growth. The calculated QE is about 70.0% for the CdShomo-2ML–Pt sample, which is among the highest QE for a CdS based photocatalyst reported so far (see Table S1, ESI†).38–40 The performance of the CdS/ZnS–Pt sample is presented in Fig. 5A. The H2 production rate increased to the maximum of 2446 μmol h−1 at 1 ML of the ZnS shell, and then decreased significantly with a further increase in the shell thickness. Taken together, while the deposition of thinner CdS and the ZnS shell (i.e., 2 ML) led to comparable photocatalytic activity in CdShomo and CdS/ZnS, a better photocatalytic performance was found for CdShomo NCs with a thicker CdS shell than that of CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs. The H2 production of the CdShomo-2ML NC sample under 300 W xenon lamp irradiation is shown in Fig. 5B (image a and Video S1†), indicating the vigorous H2 production from the photocatalytic system. Of particular interest for solar energy conversion is that vigorous H2 production could also be achieved under sunlight irradiation (image b and Video S2†), demonstrating the excellent photocatalytic properties of CdShomo NCs for visible light H2 production.

It is worthwhile noting that the deposition of the CdS shell in CdShomo NCs also resulted in a size increase. To investigate the size effect, the photocatalytic performance of CdS NCs of the same size prepared in one-step synthesis was also investigated (see Fig. S3, ESI†). In contrast, photocatalytic H2 evolution of these CdS NCs gradually decreased with size, suggesting that the enhanced performance in CdShomo NCs did not result from the effect of size. Combined with the enhanced deep-trap emission in the PL spectra of CdShomo NCs with increasing shell thickness from 2 ML to 4 ML (inset in Fig. 2B) and CdS NCs with increasing size (see Fig. S3, ESI†), it is reasonably concluded that the rate of H2 generation is significantly related to the TS on the surface of CdShomo NCs and CdS NCs, which behaved as recombination centers for the photo-induced electron/hole pairs and thus hindered electron–hole separation.41–43
The stability of CdShomo-2ML–Pt and CdS/ZnS2ML–Pt photocatalysts under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) was investigated by 7 consecutive cycles of test for 28 h accumulatively. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), no significant decrease in photocatalytic activity was observed for the CdShomo-2ML–Pt sample. However, there was a steady decrease in the H2 production rate for the CdS/ZnS2ML–Pt sample after 4 cycles of photo-irradiation. The evolution curves of the average H2 production rate for the two samples are shown in Fig. 5C, indicating that the CdShomo NCs have higher stability than the CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs under photo-irradiation. The amperometric study was further carried out for 500 s under several on/off cycles of irradiation at an applied voltage of 0.35 V. Fig. 5D shows the I–t curves for the samples of CdS NCs, CdShomo-2ML and CdS/ZnS2ML NCs. For all the three samples, the photocurrent density rapidly decreased to 0 mA cm−2 as soon as the irradiation was turned off. At the start of each cycle, the photocurrent had an anodic spike and then gradually decreased to level off. Compared with CdS NCs (photocurrent intensity: 0.24 mA cm−2), the photocurrent intensity of CdShomo-2ML and CdS/ZnS2ML NCs increased to 0.63 mA cm−2 and 0.47 mA cm−2, respectively, during the first irradiation cycle, indicative of a more efficient charge separation and transfer upon deposition of the passivation layer. Furthermore, the higher photocurrent intensity of CdShomo-2ML demonstrated that homoepitaxial deposition of the CdS shell led to easier charge separation and transfer than heteroepitaxial deposition of the ZnS shell with a wider band gap. The efficient charge separation and transfer induced more electrons transported to the back contact during photo-irradiation. Also important is that 5 cycles of irradiation gave rise to higher photocurrent intensity from the CdShomo-2ML and decreased photocurrent for CdS/ZnS2ML, confirming the better photostability of CdShomo NCs than that of the CdS/ZnS NCs. The decrease of the photocurrent for the CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs may result from self-photo-corrosion by the holes confined inside the CdS core.
Based on the evidence mentioned above, the proposed impact of the passivation layer on the photocatalytic activity is summarized in Scheme 1. There are three competitive pathways for photo-generated charge carriers in the photocatalysts during the H2 production reaction: (i) radiative recombination of the excited charges, (ii) non-radiative surface recombination, which is related to the surface TS, and (iii) charge transferring from NCs to the Pt co-catalyst. For CdS NCs, the charge separation and transfer was primarily controlled by pathways (ii) and (iii), while pathway (i) is negligible because there was nearly no photoluminescence for MPA stabilized CdS NCs (Fig. 4D and Scheme 1A). The high density surface states on CdS core NCs induced considerable non-radiative recombination, which significantly affected the charge transfer from CdS NCs to the Pt co-catalyst, and thus suppressed the photocatalytic activity during H2 production reaction. With the homoepitaxial deposition of the CdS shell, leading to a significant decrease in process (ii) for the charge carriers. The shell growth in CdShomo NCs did not introduce any band barrier compared with the heterostructured CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs, and thus the pathway of charge carriers was dominated by process (iii) (Scheme 1B). Consequently, the photo-generated charge carriers (electrons to Pt, holes to a sacrificial agent) proceed smoothly, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the photocatalytic H2 production (Scheme 1D). In contrast, for the heterostructured CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs, the wider band gap of the ZnS shell (3.70 eV) acts as a physical barrier for the photo-generated electrons and holes inside the narrower band gap CdS core NCs and the photo-generated charge carriers are mostly confined in the CdS core region, limiting the access of photo-generated electrons to the surface of the photocatalyst and the Pt cocatalyst. Therefore, process (iii) was suppressed by process (i) (Scheme 1C and E), for this reason, as supported by the retained photoluminescence of CdS/ZnS NCs after phase transfer by MPA (Fig. 4D). As a result, the CdS/ZnS NC photocatalyst suffered from photo-corrosion by the holes confined in the CdS core under photo-irradiation, which undermined their photocatalytic performance and photo-stability.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate that homoepitaxial growth is an effective approach to synthesizing homostructured NCs with minimized TS. Moreover, compared with the heteroepitaxial method, the homoepitaxial growth enables efficient migration of photo-generated electrons and holes to the surface of the photocatalyst. The homostructured CdShomo NCs could reach a H2 production rate of 2963 μmol h−1 (λ ≥ 420 nm) with a maximum QE of 70.0% at 420 nm, and had a better stability for visible light driven H2 evolution compared with that of heterostructured CdS/ZnS core/shell NCs. We envision that the homoepitaxial growth for the passivation of TS could find widespread use in developing semiconductor nanostructures for photo-current exchange and photochemical reactions.
