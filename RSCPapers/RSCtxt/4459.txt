    , Accepted 8th June 2020First published on 9th June 2020AbstractA comprehensive study of the transport properties of a prototypical CH3NH3PbI3 thin film is presented. The polaron–longitudinal optical (LO) phonon scattering mechanism, based on Low-Pines's polaron mobility, was studied to elucidate the charge-carrier mobility. We found that the calculated mobilities showed very good quantitative agreement with the experimental data measured in thin film samples using photoconductivity techniques. In THz mobility, the calculated results yielded room-temperature (RT) mobilities of ∼650 cm2 V−1 s−1 (single crystal) and ∼220 cm2 V−1 s−1 (disordered thin film) at a low quantum yield (ϕ) and 32 cm2 V−1 s−1 (high-quality thin film) at ϕ = 1. The dynamic disorder due to organic reorientation was included in the calculations. Its effect provided a power law mobility of μ ∝ Tm and satisfactorily supported temperature-dependent mobility over the temperature range of 80–370 K. In the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, the charge-carrier mobilities with dynamic disorder were approximately 47% and 22% lower than those obtained from phases without dynamic disorder. The RT mobility was 26 cm2 V−1 s−1 at ϕ = 1. In the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, the structural phase transition was considered. The mobility followed a power law with m = −1.7. In the tetragonal and cubic phases, the mobility also followed a power law, but with m = −1.1, which is an intermediate range in optical phonon scattering. When combined with recent theoretical analysis, we also found three limitations of power law mobility with exponents between −0.46 and −1.1 for polaron–LO phonon scattering, −1.2 and −1.6 for bare carrier–LO phonon scattering, and −1.7 and −2.0 for carrier scattering off optical phonons and lattice fluctuations. This work not only provides a description of temperature-dependent mobility in CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, but also gives new insights into THz photoconductivity and the relationship between LO phonon scattering and power law mobility.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have attracted significant attention due to their outstanding properties for next-generation photovoltaic materials.1,2 These properties include their broad absorption spectra,3,4 low recombination rate,5 long diffusion path lengths6–8 and high charge-carrier mobility.9,10 Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) with a band gap of ∼1.57 eV was used as a prototypical absorption material for perovskite solar cells. It was shown to have three structural phases, i.e., orthorhombic (γ), tetragonal (β), and cubic (α) systems. The material exhibited structural phase transitions of α-to-β and β-to-γ at ∼330 K and ∼161 K,11 respectively. To date, complex composition HOIP based perovskite solar cells have been found to have power conversion efficiencies of up to ∼25.2%.12 In addition to outstanding device performance, a high-quality MAPbI3 thin film fabricated via a low-cost solution-based processing technique is one of the most important features. Thus, detailed knowledge and understanding of charge-carrier mobility in the thin film morphology are important steps toward the design of complex composition HOIP materials and high-performance perovskite solar cells.
In the charge transport dynamics of MAPbI3, charge-carrier mobility was measured on a number of thin film samples using various techniques such as time-resolved terahertz (THz), absorption spectroscopy (TRTS)5,9,13,14,17 and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC).15,16 The measured room-temperature (RT) mobility values covered a broad range, ∼8–800 cm2 V−1 s−1.5,9,13–17 TRTS measurements13 provided temperature-dependent mobility values that followed a power law, μ ∝ Tm, where m = −1.5, according to recent experimental work.18,19 In classical semiconductors,20 the scattering of ionized impurities is characterized by a power law with m = 1.5 and the acoustic phonon scattering results can be modelled using a power law with m = −1.5. Considering acoustic phonon scattering, the carrier scattering from the deformation potential21 and piezoelectric22 models exhibited charge-carrier mobility values as high as 103–105 cm2 V−1 s−1. These are larger than the experimental results.5,9,13–17 A recent study of photoluminescence (PL) linewidth23 indicated that acoustic phonon scattering is less important, but the LO phonon scattering plays a major role.
Based on the LO phonon scattering, several refinements of charge-carrier mobility were found.24–30 A study of bare electron–LO phonon scattering24 yielded a power law with an exponent of −3.0 in the orthorhombic phase and −1.5 in the tetragonal phase. The RT mobility was ∼100 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is the sum of both electron and hole mobilities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of electron–LO phonon scattering25 predicted a power law with the exponents of −0.92, −1.37 and −2.27 for the cubic, tetragonal and orthorhombic phases, respectively. A predicted RT mobility of ∼80 cm2 V−1 s−1 was used as an upper bound mobility for the thin film morphology. Recently, the polaronic nature of charge transport has been used to estimate the charge-carrier mobility.26,27 A common formalism, Feynman's polaron mobility in the variational path-integral framework,31–33 was employed. This approach yielded RT mobility values of 197 (ref. 26) and 230 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 27) and a power law mobility with an exponent of −0.46 in the tetragonal and cubic phases.27 However, the predicted RT mobility values greatly overestimated the experimental values of ∼8–71 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 5 and 13–17) and underestimated the mobility values of ∼600–800 cm2 V−1 s−1.9 Next, a tight-binding model fitted using first-principles DFT calculations was proposed to investigate large polaron formation and its effects on carrier transport in the tetragonal and cubic phases.28 Large polaron mobility values with the effects of dynamic disorder due to methylammonium (MA) rotation and vibration of the PbI3 sublattice yielded a power law with exponents of −0.63 and −0.55, respectively. The RT mobility values were lower than the experimental results. Furthermore, a recent experiment on charge-carrier mobility in MAPbI3 thin films was reported using time-resolved PL microscopy.29 The fitted experimental data produced a power law with exponents of −1.2 in the orthorhombic phase and −1.8 in the tetragonal phase. A RT mobility of ∼32 cm2 V−1 s−1 was in agreement with measured values from TRTS and TRMC methods.13–15 The temperature dependence of the mobility values related to an exponent of ∼−2.0 in the tetragonal phase was attributed to the carrier scattering off optical phonons and lattice fluctuations.30 The anharmonic displacements in the PbI3 sublattice produced large temporal and spatial modulations of orbital overlaps corresponding to the off-diagonal electron–phonon coupling effects or Peierls interaction.
From the charge-carrier transport analysis of perovskite MAPbI3, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical results were observed. First, there has not been a comparative investigation of mobility to match the experimental data at ∼8–800 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by TRTS and TRMC.5,9,13–17 Second, there is no theoretical framework to establish a clear relationship between LO phonon scattering and power law mobility. The experiments determined that power law mobility has exponents between −1.2 and −1.5 in the orthorhombic phase and exponents between −0.95 and −1.8 in the tetragonal and cubic phases.13,19,27,29 Theoretical analysis revealed a power law with exponents between −1.5 and −3.0 in the orthorhombic phase18,24,25 and between −0.46 and −2.0 in the tetragonal and cubic phases.24–30 In this work, we report a comprehensive understanding of the transport properties of MAPbI3 thin films. In scattering analysis, we used the Low-Pines (LP) polaron mobility via Fröhlich interaction34,35 to describe the charge-carrier mobility. The polaron–LO phonon scattering based on LP mobility was successfully applied to explain electron transport in perovskite transition-metal oxides.36,37 In theoretical calculations, the dynamic disorder of MA molecules38,39 relating the temperature-dependent dielectric function was incorporated into the LO phonon scattering. The calculated results were comparable to experimental values, i.e., the temperature-dependent mobility values in the temperature range of 8–370 K (ref. 13) and RT mobilities.5,9,13–17 Our theoretical results show very good quantitative agreement with the experimental data.
Results
Charge-carrier mobility
Carrier mobility can be calculated from effective mass and relaxation time approximations such as μ = eτ/m*, where e is the elementary charge, τ is the momentum relaxation time and m* is the effective mass of a charge-carrier ( for an electron and  for a hole). In an intrinsic semiconductor, the electron and hole concentrations are the same, i.e., n = ne = nh, and the carrier conductivity is σ = n|e|(μe + μh). Thus, the charge-carrier mobility is obtained as the sum of both electron and hole mobilities as ∑μ = μe + μh.
As suggested by the experiments with MAPbI3 thin films, reported mobilities showed a broad range of values10 due to the complexity of synthesis processes, material morphologies and differences in measurement techniques. It is noteworthy in transport measurements40 that the extraction of charge-carrier mobility from photoconductivity measurements such as TRTS and TRMC tends to reflect the intrinsic capabilities of phonon scattering. The charge-carrier dynamics and carrier–phonon scattering were investigated utilizing TRTS13,18,41–43 and TRMC.19 TRTS and TRMC are electrodeless techniques that measure the intrinsic mobility of the carriers without distortions due to charge transfer across contacts. These techniques directly probe all the charge carriers in the material, i.e., both the radiative and non-radiative charge carriers. In time-resolved spectroscopy, the optical pump pulse excites charge carriers in the sample, and the THz pulse (or continuous microwave) probes the dynamic response of charge carriers on very short time scales. By propagating the probe pulse through the photoexcitation region, the THz transient photoconductivity (or microwave transient photoconductance) as a function of time delay after photoexcitation can be measured, leading to information about carrier densities, mobilities and carrier–phonon scattering.5,9,13–19 Thus, TRTS and TRMC are suitable techniques to investigate the LO phonon scattering mechanism in HOIPs.
Polaron–LO phonon scattering mechanism
Due to the nature of a polar crystal, an electron moving in the conduction band produces an ionic crystal polarization that follows the electron motion. The interaction between an electron (or a hole) and LO phonons can be described as a Fröhlich polaron,44 a dressed particle formed by an electron coupled with an LO phonon cloud created from self-induced polarization. The electron–phonon interaction strength or the so-called Fröhlich coupling constant can be calculated as (1)where ωLO is the frequency of the LO phonon, εs is the static dielectric constant and ε∞ is the high-frequency dielectric constant. The Fröhlich coupling constant is strongly correlated with the difference between ε∞ and εs. From the perovskite structure of MAPbI3, its structural framework consists of two sublattice components, an organic MA+ molecule and inorganic PbI3− octahedron. The value of the dielectric functions can be clarified by the dynamics of both the organic and inorganic components related to the response frequencies. The high-frequency dielectric function relates to electronic interband transitions at a frequency of around 1015 Hz and ε∞ = 5–7.45 The static dielectric function associates the rotational motion of the MA molecule and the vibration of the inorganic PbI3 octahedron in the infrared46–48 and THz (ref. 41 and 45) regions, respectively. The value of dielectric constant is in the range of εs = 16–70.49–51 Thus, MAPbI3 shows greatly different dielectric constants, leading to strong electron–phonon coupling.
To calculate the charge-carrier mobility, the intermediate coupling constant regime (α ≤ 6) and LP polaron mobility via Fröhlich interaction are considered. In the theory of LP's polaron, Lee, Low and Pines52 proposed a unitary transformation to construct a polaron wavefunction with fully delocalized states. Next, Low and Pines34 applied the wavefunction to calculate the transport rate of the polaron–LO phonon scattering as , where mP = m*(1 + α/6) is the renormalized polaron mass and NLO(T) is the Bose–Einstein distribution function of the associated LO phonon mode. Thus, LP polaron mobility, the polaron–LO phonon scattering limited mobility, can be expressed as34,35 (2)where the slowly varying function, f(α), is assumed to be unity. Thus, this equation can be used to analyze the charge-carrier mobility, and it fits the experimental data. In numerical calculations, we used the constant parameters previously reported for MAPbI3 as ℏωLO = 11.5 meV (2.78 THz),23 and .53,54 Additionally, only the Fröhlich coupling constant relating to dielectric constants needs to be specified.
Temperature dependence of mobility
In order to validate our present calculations, the theoretical results were compared with the experimental data for MAPbI3 thin films.13–16 We took into account the average dielectric constants of ε∞ = 5.4 and εs = 30.4,45 leading to αe = 2.4 and αh = 2.8. Fig. 1 shows a comparison between the fitted mobility values and the experimental data as a function of temperature. The fitted result (solid curve) shows reasonable agreement with the experimental data. The RT mobility of 32 cm2 V−1 s−1 was in very good agreement with the experimental values of 30–35 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured from TRTS13,15 and PL.29 For the temperature dependence of mobility, the fitting achieved a power law mobility, corresponding to the temperature dependence between T−2.65 and T−1.5, T−1.5 and T−1.27, and T−1.27 in the orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic phases, respectively. Some mobility trends were in good agreement with the experimental result of μ ∝ T−1.5.13,18,19 The overall trend was quite similar to the power law, μ ∝ T−1.5 (grey dashed line). From Fig. 1, polaron–LO phonon scattering is shown to be the dominant scattering mechanism in all three structural phases. Next, we attempted to estimate an upper bound mobility for the MAPbI3 thin film. As a benchmark, we used an upper bound mobility of 197 cm2 V−1 s−1 and reduced mass of  reported by Sendner et al.26 Using this approach, a coupling constant of α = 1.68 was calculated. This prediction is presented as a green dashed line, providing a RT mobility of 77 cm2 V−1 s−1. All experimental values for the MAPbI3 thin film samples measured using TRTS and TRMC13–16 were embedded in the theoretical limit as well. The mobility calculated from LP's polaron model was significantly lower than the value of 197 cm2 V−1 s−1 estimated from Feynman's polaron model.26 This suggested that the value of 77 cm2 V−1 s−1 is an upper bound of RT mobility for this thin film, which is close in value to the earlier reported result of 80 cm2 V−1 s−1.25
 Fig. 1  Plot of the LP polaron mobilities (solid lines), the upper bound mobility (green dashed line), the power law of T−1.5 (grey dashed line) and the experimental results of MAPbI3 thin films13–16 as a function of temperature. 
Additionally, we further investigated THz mobilities measured from TRTS.9,17 From our fittings in Fig. 1, the mobility of 32 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature showed good agreement with the THz mobility of 35 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured under a photon-to-charge conversion ratio of 100%.13 This implied that the value of 32 cm2 V−1 s−1 based on polaronic transport is the lower limit in THz mobility. However, previous TRTS studies provided higher values of THz mobility; ∼220 cm2 V−1 s−1 at ϕ = 0.05 (ref. 17) and ∼600–800 cm2 V−1 s−1 at ϕ = 0.09–0.12 (ref. 9) were reported in disordered thin films and single crystals, respectively. In the TRTS measurement,43 an effective charge-carrier mobility was extracted by the change of THz photoconductivity as ϕ∑μ = Δσ/n0e, where ϕ = n0/npho is the photon-to-charge conversion quantum yield, n0 is the initial photogenerated carrier density and npho is the absorbed photon density. The quantum yield falls in the range of 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 1.
To describe the THz mobility values in the low quantum yield, we used the LP polaron mobility in eqn (2) to elucidate the scattering mechanism. In LP polaron mobility,34,52 the polaron–LO phonon scattering rate was directly related to the electronic density of states, phonon populations and coupling constant. A relatively low phonon frequency, with an effective mode of 2.78 THz (11.5 meV),23 was monitored to examine the polaron–LO phonon scattering. Using the same reduced mass of μ* = 0.104m0,26,55 we changed the coupling constant of α = 1.68 by α = 0.8 and the LO phonon population with the Bose–Einstein distribution by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, NLO(T) = (eℏωLO/kBT)−1. The calculated mobility was 648 cm2 V−1 s−1, which agrees with the range of experimental results between 600 and 800 cm2 V−1 s−1.9 Moreover, the polaron mobility value of 648 cm2 V−1 s−1 showed reasonable agreement with the THz mobility of 220 cm2 V−1 s−1 reported in disordered thin films.17 The THz mobility of polycrystalline films can be determined using the relation (1 + c1)∑μ, based on the Drude–Smith model,17,43 where c1 is the strength of backscattering due to grain boundaries or defects and −1 < c1 < 0. Using ∑μ = 648 cm2 V−1 s−1 and c1 = −0.66, a mobility value of 220 cm2 V−1 s−1 was determined, and the effective charge-carrier mobility was ϕ(1 + c1)∑μ = 11 cm2 V−1 s−1. The value c1 = −0.66 agrees well with a recently reported result of c1 = −0.63 in MAPbI3.56 Its effective value showed very good agreement with the experimental results of ∼8–12 cm2 V−1 s−1 for solution-processed materials.5,15,17 It is notable that the effective charge-carrier mobility of 11 cm2 V−1 s−1, based on polaron transport in a disordered thin film, can be used as a mobility benchmark. Thus, measured mobilities having relatively lower values could stem from a polycrystalline thin film with small grain sizes and high levels of defects.
Our findings suggested that a reduced polaron–LO phonon scattering rate with decreasing quantum yield leads to increased THz mobility. It is presumably related to a set of reduced scattering parameters, such as the initial photogenerated carrier density, phonon population and coupling constant. In the quantum yield of ϕ = 1 and the photoexcitation above the band edge,13 hot carrier densities as high as ∼1 × 1018 cm−3 have been generated. During carrier relaxation or carrier cooling, the scattering process via phonon emission was continually produced, maintaining a large population of phonons and free carriers. Its effects caused a strong coupling between polarons and relevant LO phonons. In contrast to the low quantum yield,9 carrier densities of ∼3 × 1017 cm−3 have been created, which is a relatively low density of states. With photoexcitation near the band edge,9 both free carriers and excitons were produced. A large number of phonons during carrier cooling could be reabsorbed by excitons,42 dissociating the excitons to form free charge carriers. This process caused a reduced phonon population, and the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution was valid. In the coupling constant, a value of α = 0.8 can be calculated using ε∞ = 6.8 and εs = 14. These dielectric constants agree well with the experimental results of ε∞ = 6.5–6.8 (ref. 57 and 58) and εs = 16–18 (ref. 49 and 50) in MAPbI3. The coupling constant α = 0.8 was comparable to the value of ∼1.17 reported for both MAPbI341 and MAPbBr3.59 Therefore, the concept of polaron transport well explained the THz mobility values. It offered RT mobility values of ∼11 cm2 V−1 s−1, ∼32 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ∼650 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a disordered thin film, high-quality thin film and single crystal, respectively.
However, much experimental data13 over a broad temperature range in Fig. 1 are still underestimated by our prediction. To resolve this discrepancy, the role of the dynamic disorder due to MA reorientation in charge-carrier transport was investigated. In MAPbI3, the configuration of C and N atoms leads to a dipole moment in the direction of the C–N bond.60 The dynamic disorder or structural phase dependence on MA reorientation contributed the temperature dependence of the static dielectric function. The experiment using perovskite MAPbI349 showed that the dielectric function continuously increased from the cubic phase to the tetragonal phase, with a discontinuity in the tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition at 161 K. This characteristic can be described by the temperature-dependent dielectric function in the Debye relaxation model as εs(T) = ε∞ + C/(T − T*),49,50 where C is a material constant and T* is the Curie–Weiss temperature. The dielectric constant has been described using ε∞ = 22, C = 9221 K and T* = 66.2 K in the tetragonal phase.50 In addition to the cubic phase between 330 and 370 K, the constant parameters gave reasonable values of the static dielectric constant of 57 and 52. These values agree with the experimental results.49 It is notable that the dielectric function was valid in both the tetragonal and cubic phases, but overestimated in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase. To account for the polaron–LO phonon coupling strength in the tetragonal and cubic phases, we examined the Fröhlich coupling constant using the dielectric function, εs(T). Fig. 2 shows the coupling constant with and without the temperature-dependent dielectric function and its relationship with temperature. It can be seen that the coupling constants of electrons and holes with the temperature-dependent dielectric function were stronger than those obtained from the constant dielectric function. The increase in coupling strength from the cubic phase to the tetragonal phase corresponds to the large difference between ε∞ and εs(T). These results indicated that the dynamic disorder of MA dipoles made an additional contribution to the polaron–LO phonon scattering.

The solid and dashed lines represent the coupling constants with and without a temperature-dependent dielectric function for an electron (red) and hole (blue), respectively. The inset depicts the coupling constants with a temperature-dependent dielectric function for an electron and hole in the orthorhombic phase. 

Fig. 3 shows a comparison between the temperature-dependent mobility values13 and the LP polaron mobility with and without the dynamic disorder. From the cubic phase to the tetragonal phase, the fitted mobility with dynamic disorder (red solid line) provides values that better match the experimental data than the fitting without dynamic disorder (blue dashed line). At 160 K and room temperature, the mobility values of 55 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 26 cm2 V−1 s−1 show good agreement with the experimental results of 52 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 13) and 20–35 cm2 V−1 s−1,13–15 respectively. These mobility values with dynamic disorder are 25% and 19% lower than the values without dynamic disorder of 73 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 32 cm2 V−1 s−1. Moreover, the fitting yielded a power law of T−1.1, which is close in value to a power law of T−0.95 (ref. 27) that fitted the mobility data in ref. 13 above 100 K. Our theory provides a reasonably accurate description of the charge-carrier mobility properties, including their experimental data and power law mobilities. In the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, we considered a structural phase transition. Known constant parameters were employed, such as the effective masses of  and  (ref. 61) and static dielectric constant of εs = 36 (ref. 49) reported for the low-symmetry orthorhombic phase. Herein, the coupling strengths of αe = 2.6 and αh = 3.37 were estimated, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. We also plotted the fitted mobility for the orthorhombic phase as a solid orange line. The fitted curve exhibits better agreement with the experimental data compared to the results without dynamic disorder. The mobility values of 166 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 78 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 80 K and 120 K are ∼47% lower than the mobility values without dynamic disorder of 243 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 115 cm2 V−1 s−1. The fitted curve provides power law mobilities of T−1.7 at T > 80 K and T−2.7 at T < 80 K. These results are evidence that the structural phase transition should be considered in the low-symmetry orthorhombic phase. However, the mobility data were underestimated at T < 80 K. This can be ascribed to the scattering from ionized impurities with a power law of μ ∝ T1.5 (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

Discussion
The insights from the scattering analysis allow us to explain the transport properties of the MAPbI3 thin films as follows: Firstly, the band-like transport of charge-carriers must be described as large polaron transport. A Fröhlich polaron is formed by an electron (or hole) coupled with an LO phonon cloud created from the deformation of PbI3 octahedra. Using the effective LO phonon mode of 2.78 THz (11.5 meV)23 and the Fröhlich polaron model, ,26 the radii can be estimated as lP(e) = 40 Å and lP(h) = 34 Å for the electron and hole, respectively. These radii were in the range of large polarons, i.e., greater than 40–50 Å, as previously reported for HOIP materials26 and much larger than the PbI3 octahedron (6.2 Å).
Secondly, the dynamic disorder of the MA dipoles played a key role in large polaron transport. There are three important processes affected by dynamic disorder. The first process is the driving force for large polaron formation, corresponding to the long-range Coulomb potential.62 The large difference between ε∞ and εs values caused higher long-range potential, resulting in the formation of large polarons. In MAPbI3, large polarons are formed by an electron (or a hole) coupled with the cloud of polarizations of both the deformed PbI3 octahedra and random MA dipoles.62,63 The polarization mechanisms were locally screened carrier–carrier and carrier–lattice defect scatterings. Thus, charge carriers of the MAPbI3 thin film were more tolerant of lattice defects. The second process is the increased polaron–LO phonon coupling strength. The coupling constant was similarly correlated with the difference between dielectric constants, and then the polaron–LO phonon coupling strength with dynamic disorder was relatively stronger. Therefore, the large difference between dielectric constants causes the polaron effect in MAPbI3. Alternatively, the coupling strength is very weak when the magnitude of the two dielectric constants is similar. The polaronic effect becomes insignificant and the induced polarizations are eliminated, leaving only the conduction band electron. This is similar to the case of GaAs with αe = 0.068 and μ = 7000 cm2 V−1 s−1.64 The third process is the localization of electrons and holes at different locations in real space.65,66 The random orientation of MA cations caused electrostatic potential fluctuations with time which drives the spatial separation of charge-carriers and reduces their recombination.65
Thirdly, the polaron–LO phonon scattering mechanism satisfactorily supports the measured THz mobilities in the temperature range of 80–370 K (ref. 13) and RT mobilities of ∼8–800 cm2 V−1 s−1.5,9,13–17 The scattering mechanism exhibits a power law mobility equivalent to the experimental and theoretical analysis. In the tetragonal and cubic phases, the mobility follows a power law with m = −1.1. This is in agreement with the experimental results with exponents between m = −0.95 and m = −1.8 (ref. 13, 18, 19, 27 and 28) and theoretical analysis showing exponents between m = −0.46 and m = −2.0.24–30 From the present data and recent theoretical explanations,24–30 we found three limitations of power law mobility under carrier–optical phonon scattering, i.e., exponents between m = −0.46 and m = −1.1 for the large polaron, m = −1.2 and m = −1.6 for the bare carrier, and m = −1.7 and m = −2.0 for the carrier scattering off optical phonons and lattice fluctuations. In the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, the mobility followed a power law with m = −1.7, which is close in value to the experimental results with m = −1.5.13,18,19 DFT calculations61 show that the contribution of MA molecules greatly affects both the stability and their electronic structure. The transition from a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase increased the effective masses of charge carriers. Moreover, the tilting of PbI6 octahedra in the low-symmetry orthorhombic phase reduced the rotational freedom of the MA dipoles, resulting in a discontinuity in the static dielectric function due to its antiferroelectric arrangement.49,50,60 Charge-carrier mobility is expected to decrease in the orthorhombic phase due to the greater effective masses. However, an abrupt change was not found at around 160 K in either the theoretical calculations or experimental results.13 This is analogous to a decreased polaron–LO phonon scattering rate, τLO−1, from the restricted rotation of the MA dipoles and the reduced LO-phonon population.
Finally, the LP polaron mobility formula showed very good quantitative agreement with the mobility data obtained through THz and microwave spectroscopy measurements.5,9,13–17 In this work, the scattering analysis incorporated both the PbI3 sublattice vibration and the dynamic disorder of the MA molecule. The calculational framework used a wavefunction with fully delocalized states to calculate the charge-carrier mobility. While the variational Feynman polaron mobility used a delocalized wavefunction,26,27 it greatly overestimated the experimental data.5,13–17 This is because the variational method required that Feynman's variational parameters be obtained by optimizing the finite-temperature free energies.26,27 This variational method should yield an upper limit to charge-carrier mobility. In contrast, the tight-binding model fitted to first-principles DFT28 used a localized wavefunction. The polaron transport calculations that included both the dynamic disorder and inorganic vibration underestimated the mobility data.9,13–16 Our findings and those of recent reports related to polaron transport theories26–28 suggest that the LP polaron mobility with delocalized polaron states accurately describes charge-carrier mobilities in the MAPbI3 thin films measured by photoconductivity techniques.
Conclusions
We investigated the charge-carrier transport properties of a prototypical MAPbI3 thin film using transport scattering analysis. Polaron–LO phonon scattering based on LP mobility was adopted to explain the temperature-dependent mobilities and the RT magnitudes using data extracted from TRTS and TRMC measurements. It was found that the calculated mobilities were in reasonable agreement with experimental mobility data. At low quantum yield, the THz mobility calculations yielded RT mobilities of ∼650 cm2 V−1 s−1 in a single crystal and ∼220 cm2 V−1 s−1 in a disordered thin film, corresponding to a relatively high mobility value. This is due to the reduction of carrier concentration, phonon population and coupling constant. For the thin film morphology, the effective charge-carrier mobilities of 11 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 32 cm2 V−1 s−1 were estimated for disordered and high-quality thin films, respectively. Moreover, the effect of both the dynamic disorder of MA rotation and PbI3 sublattice vibration was investigated. The role of dynamic disorder is seen from the insights into charge-carrier mobility. Polaron–LO phonon interaction was the primary scattering mechanism over a broad temperature range from 80 K to 370 K. The charge-carrier mobility with dynamic disorder was approximately 22% and 47% lower than those without dynamic disorder in tetragonal and orthorhombic phases, respectively. The mobility calculations yielded a RT mobility of 26 cm2 V−1 s−1. The charge-carrier mobility followed a power law with an exponent of −1.7 in the orthorhombic phase. In the tetragonal and cubic phases, the mobility followed a power law with an exponent of −1.1. From our investigation, a power law mobility for a MAPbI3 thin film in the tetragonal and cubic phases was separated into three regimes based on the carrier–LO phonon interactions. These include polaron–LO phonon scattering, bare carrier–LO phonon scattering and carrier scattering off optical phonons and lattice fluctuations. These findings contribute to our fundamental understanding of the transport nature of charge-carriers in HOIP materials.
