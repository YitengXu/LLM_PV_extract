    , Accepted 9th March 2023First published on 10th March 2023AbstractTwo quinoidal-type ThBF derivatives incorporating triphenylamine moieties, namely ThBF-TPA and ThBF-OMeTPA, were designed as perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface engineering materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). They were demonstrated to effectively passivate perovskite surface defects and reduce the non-radiative recombination through coordination with Pb2+ on the perovskite surface. Consequently, PSCs incorporating ThBF-OMeTPA fabricated under ambient conditions achieved a high PCE of 19.09% with substantial enhancement in stability.
The last decade has witnessed a huge progress of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has risen from 3.8% to 25.7%.1 However, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells are usually fabricated in an inert atmosphere, which largely blocks the large-scale production and costs a lot.2 The manufacture of PSCs in air instead of an inert atmosphere provides an opportunity to effectively reduce the cost. One key problem in the fabrication of PSCs under ambient conditions is the degradation of perovskite films when contacting with air, moisture, light, or heat, leading to the poor stability of the device and relatively low PCEs.3
In this context, great efforts have been paid to improving the performance of PSCs that are manufactured in air. The commonly-used effective methods include (i) the addition of dopants to perovskite materials to reduce defect density,4 (ii) the utilization of carrier transport layer (HTL) materials with high carrier mobility and fewer defects,5 and (iii) the passivation at the interface between the perovskite and charge transport material.6 In particular, rational design of the perovskite/HTL interface by molecular engineering can efficiently promote the hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTL. Previous research studies demonstrate that suitable small molecules, such as BSBF-NH2,7 MT2,8 or BTZI-TPA,9 can effectively passivate the perovskite by interacting with Pb2+. PSCs based on these compounds as perovskite/HTL interface passivation materials that are prepared under air conditions can achieve much improved PCEs of up to 20.05%–24.06%. However, reports on the preparation of PSCs under atmospheric conditions using interfacial modification strategies are still very limited.10
2,5-Bis(9H-fluoren-9-ylidene)-2,5-dihydrothiophene (ThBF) is a representative quinoidal thiophene compound.11 It exhibits many unique features, such as high molecular planarity, structural rigidity, low HOMO/LUMO energy levels, small energy bandgaps, etc. Since its first report in 1991,12 ThBF has long been considered to be a potential hole-transporting semiconductor material in organic photovoltaics (OPV).13 In particular, organic thin-film solar cells based on ThBF as the electron donor material with an efficiency of 1.1% have been reported.14 The low solubility and unsuitable energy levels are two disadvantages for the application of ThBF. It is expected that rational molecular modification of ThBF will further fine-tune the energy level or facilitate the fabrication process, thus improving the OPV device performance.15
In this paper, two ThBF derivatives, namely ThBF-TPA and ThBF-OMeTPA, were designed by modifying ThBF with four strong electron-donating triphenylamine moieties16 and synthesized through a facile three-step synthetic route. Compared with ThBF, the target compounds showed much improved solubility in commonly-used organic solvents. Therefore, we applied the two compounds as efficient perovskite/HTL interface passivation materials in PSCs. The results indicated that the ThBF could effectively passivate the defects on the perovskite surface and reduce the non-radiative recombination through coordination with Pb2+. In particular, the optimized ThBF-OMeTPA-based PSCs that were fabricated under ambient conditions achieved a PCE of 19.09%, which was largely improved compared with the pristine PSCs (15.02%). Besides, the ThBF derivative based PSCs were also demonstrated to have good humidity stability. To our knowledge, this is the first report of high-efficiency PSCs incorporating quinoidal-type molecules.
The three-step synthetic route for the ThBF derivatives is shown in Fig. 1. Initially, Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions between 2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-one (1) and the corresponding boronic acids (2) were employed to give intermediate 3. Subsequent treatment with an organic lithium reagent produced diol intermediates 4. Finally, using stannous chloride, intermediates 4 were converted to ThBF-TPA or ThBF-OMeTPA. The final products could be well dissolved in organic solvents such as chloroform (CHCl3), dichloromethane (DCM) and chlorobenzene (CB), facilitating their application as solution-processed optoelectronic materials.
 Fig. 1  Synthetic route for ThBF-TPA and ThBF-OMeTPA. 
As shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), thermogravimetric (TG) curves showed that the decomposition temperatures of ThBF-TPA and ThBF-OMeTPA at 5% weight loss are 208 °C and 340 °C, respectively. The introduction of methoxy groups on triphenylamine remarkably increased the thermal decomposition temperature, thus improving the thermal stability. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves showed no detectable phase transition peaks (Fig. S1b, ESI†), indicating the low crystallinity and high thermal stability of the two compounds at temperatures lower than 200 °C.
The UV-vis absorption spectra in the solution exhibited two absorption bands in the regions of 300–430 nm and 450–620 nm (Fig. S1c, ESI†), which were ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer and the π–π* transition, respectively. In the visible region, the maximum absorption at 558 nm and its shoulder peak at about 524 nm could be regarded as the characteristic absorption of the ThBF backbone.15 The absorption curves of the thin film became much wider and the maximum absorption wavelengths red-shifted by about 16 nm as compared with those in solution, indicating that the ThBF derivatives possessed a J-type π–π stacking nature.17 Besides, it was found that the solvent polarity did not significantly affect the UV-vis absorption curves, indicating the good stability of the ThBF derivatives after solvent treatment (Fig. S2, ESI†).
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves showed a reversible one-electron oxidation peak and a two-electron reduction peak18 (Fig. S1d, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of ThBF-TPA were calculated to be −5.25 eV and −3.40 eV. From the comparison, both the HOMO (−5.01 eV) and LUMO (−3.37 eV) energy levels of ThBF-OMeTPA increased due to the strong electron-donating properties of the four introduced methoxy groups. In addition, the good overlap of the CV curves after running for 100 segments implied the high electrochemical stability of the ThBF derivatives (Fig. S2, ESI†).
The low-lying ground states of the ThBF derivatives calculated with density functional theory (DFT) using the Gaussian software package are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Due to the quinoidal nature, the ThBF backbone presented a rigid and relatively planar geometry. There was a dihedral angle of only 10° between the thiophene unit and the two adjacent fluorenylidene moieties. After the introduction of the four triphenylamine moieties, ThBF-TPA and ThBF-OMeTPA showed an H-shaped configuration from the top view. The dihedral angles between the thiophene and fluorenylidene moieties increased to about 17.6°–17.9°. From the side view, they exhibited a twisted X-shaped structure with an angle of about 36°–38° (Fig. S4a, ESI†). The electronic cloud densities of the HOMO were mainly distributed on one TPA unit, while those of the LUMO were only distributed on the central ThBF moiety (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The calculated energy levels and absorption data were consistent with the experimental results. Specifically, the absorption band in the visible region mainly resulted from the HOMO-4 → LUMO transition (97%), confirming the π–π* transitions, while the absorption band in the UV region was ascribed to the HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 transition (74%), demonstrating the intramolecular charge transfer (Fig. S5–S7 and Tables S2 and S3, ESI†). The surface electrostatic potential maps indicated that the negative charges of ThBF-TPA were mainly located on the ThBF moiety. For ThBF-OMeTPA, the oxygen atoms of the methoxy groups exhibited higher electronegativity than the central ThBF core, creating more positions for the coordination of Pb2+ (Fig. S4c, ESI†). This result implied that ThBF-OMeTPA would provide a greater passivation ability than ThBF-TPA.
The planar PSCs incorporating the ThBF derivatives had a structure of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/ThBF derivative/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag and were fabricated under atmospheric conditions (Fig. S8, ESI†). Although ThBF derivatives exhibited certain solubility in chlorobenzene, the investigation results (Fig. S9–S11, ESI†) indicated the existence of the dye layer in the devices. Compared with the pristine device (PCE = 15.02%, Voc = 1.04 V, Jsc = 22.22 mA cm−2, FF = 72.15%), the PSCs incorporating the ThBF derivatives exhibited remarkably improved performance with good reproducibility (for ThBF-TPA, PCE = 18.13%, Voc = 1.06 V, Jsc = 22.34 mA cm−2, FF = 76.59%; for ThBF-OMeTPA, PCE = 19.09%, Voc = 1.09 V, Jsc = 22.84 mA cm−2, FF = 76.68%) (Fig. 2a and Fig. S12–S14, ESI†). Therefore, ThBF derivatives could be regarded as good interface engineering materials. The overall improvement of the PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF should be ascribed to the functions of the ThBF derivatives in the reduction of film defects and the inhibition of non-radiative charge recombination.

As shown in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2b), the perovskite films treated with the ThBF derivatives exhibited obvious blue-shifted and asymmetric spectra with much higher PL intensity than the pristine film, suggesting a remarkable decrease in non-radiative charge recombination. In particular, ThBF-OMeTPA exhibited a greater influence than ThBF-TPA, implying a better passivation ability of ThBF-OMeTPA due to the strong electronegativity of oxygen atoms. From the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS), PSCs based on ThBF-TPA or ThBF-OMeTPA exhibited a larger semicircle with higher charge transfer resistance (Rct) and lower series resistance (Rs) than the pristine PSCs (Fig. 2c), which implied that the ThBF derivatives can passivate the surface defects and effectively suppress the charge recombination in perovskite films, resulting in increased Voc and FF. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to calculate the energy levels of perovskite films (Fig. S15, ESI†). The HOMO energy level for perovskite films passivated with ThBF-TPA or ThBF-OMeTPA was −5.36 eV or −5.31 eV, respectively, while their LUMO energy levels were further calculated to be −3.52 eV and −3.67 eV, respectively (Fig. 2d). The results implied that the interface passivation of ThBF-TPA or ThBF-OMeTPA was attributed to a well-matched energy level, which would promote the hole transport from the perovskite layer to the spiro-OMeTAD, resulting in a decrease of carrier recombination and an increase of Voc and Jsc.
To clarify the passivation effect of ThBF-TPA or ThBF-OMeTPA on PSCs, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the surface of the perovskite film was tested. As shown in Fig. 3a, the peaks at 143.7 eV and 138.9 eV corresponded to Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2. After treatment with ThBF-OMeTPA or ThBF-TPA, both peaks were shifted toward a lower binding energy region, implying the interaction of the ThBF derivatives with uncoordinated Pb2+ ions on the perovskite surface. In general, the larger influence of ThBF-OMeTPA than that of ThBF-TPA again suggested the better passivation effect of ThBF-OMeTPA. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, in order to further verify the passivation of ThBF-TPA or ThBF-OMeTPA, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used for the analysis. For example, the C–S single bond of ThBF-TPA showed a stretching vibration peak at 1329 cm−1. After the perovskite film was passivated by ThBF-TPA, the peak shifted to 1121 cm−1 and the peak intensity became weaker, indicating that the S atoms in ThBF-TPA may interact with the perovskite film.19 For ThBF-OMeTPA, the stretching vibration peak for the C–O single bond at 1343 cm−1 shifted to 1135 cm−1 after passivation, which further indicated the passivation effect of O atoms on the perovskite thin films through the interaction with Pb defects.20

From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S16, ESI†), an extra thin interface layer on the surface of the perovskite could be observed after the interfacial treatment. The passivated perovskite film became much smoother and denser without obvious pinholes. The UV-vis absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†). All films exhibited a similar absorption edge, indicating that the surface treatment had a negligible effect on the band gap of the perovskite. The absorption strength of the treated perovskite layer had been obviously enhanced in the short wavelength region compared with that of the pristine film, which could be due to the higher-quality perovskite film.21 As shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†), the diffraction peaks at 14.3°, 28.6° and 32.1° in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern corresponded to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of the perovskite film, respectively. All films exhibited similar XRD patterns and no difference in the main peak positions, confirming that the passivator did not affect the crystal structure of the perovskite, which might be due to the large molecular size of ThBF derivatives that did not enter the perovskite.22
The formation of ThBF-TPA or ThBF-OMeTPA layers on the surface of perovskite films might enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells. The water contact angles of the passivated perovskite films increases obviously (Fig. S19, ESI†), which can prevent water molecules from entering the perovskite film. The ThBF-TPA or ThBF-OMeTPA passivated PSCs could retain 70% or 80% of the initial PCE, respectively, when exposed to 85% humidity at room temperature for 500 h in the dark (Fig. 3d). In contrast, only 30% of the initial PCE was left for the unpassivated PSCs under the same conditions.
In summary, we provided a new strategy for the molecular design of efficient interface passivation materials based on the quinoidal-type ThBF backbone incorporating four triphenylamine moieties. Two ThBF derivatives were synthesized through a facile three-step synthetic route. The perovskite film could be effectively passivated through the interaction of the ThBF derivatives and Pb2+. The passivated perovskite films also presented suitable energy levels that were beneficial for hole transport. Therefore, the non-radiative carrier recombination could be reduced at the interface. Consequently, the modified PSCs fabricated in air exhibited a remarkably improved performance, compared with the pristine ones. In particular, the PSCs based on ThBF-OMeTPA achieved a PCE of 19.09% with improved Jsc, Voc, and FF values. Due to the highly hydrophobic nature of the ThBF derivatives, the modified PSCs also showed much improved air-humidity stability, which therefore was beneficial to their large-scale industrial application in future.
