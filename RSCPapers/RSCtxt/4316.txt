Among the many different types of pyroelectric materials, lead-based materials are the most widely-used traditional pyroelectric material and they will soon be banned due to their high toxicity. Therefore, in the past decade, extensive studies have been conducted to search for high performance lead-free pyroelectric materials. Recent experimental efforts have led to significant advances in lead-free pyroelectrics in different forms. This has further motivated their application from a traditional sensing function to a future energy-related prospect. This article provides a comprehensive review on the up-to-date advances in lead-free pyroelectrics, including single crystals, ceramics, inorganic films, polymers and composites. Moreover, the recent rise in energy harvesting and the electrocaloric effect as well as the potential future development of pyroelectric applications will be presented.
1. Introduction
Pyroelectrics refer to a class of materials that exhibit an internal polarization change in response to the variation in temperature.1–11 They provide a response of the surface charge from a small temperature variation and thus can be utilized in infrared (IR) detection, fire alarms, thermal imaging and energy harvesting, etc.1,4 In the past few decades, lead-containing materials typically lead-zirconate-titanate (PbZr1−xTixO3, PZT)-based ceramics have attracted much attention due to their outstanding electrical properties, including a pyroelectric performance and an appropriate Curie temperature (TC ∼ 300 °C).12–15 More recently, the utilization of hazardous lead-containing substances has been under great pressure due to environmental concerns of their toxicity. Lead-based materials have been banned by related legislations such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) passed by the European Union in 2006. Although the use of lead in some electronic devices is temporarily exempted due to the lack of reliable alternatives, the exemption renewal will soon expire in the near future. Therefore, the development of high-performance lead-free materials that can be comparable to lead-containing materials has become inevitable.13,14,16–18
For lead-free materials, the most important electrical properties include their dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties. More specifically, the latter property includes the former ones, but not vice versa.1,3 For example, pyroelectrics are a subclass of piezoelectrics, while not all piezoelectrics exhibit a pyroelectric behaviour. The properties generated from a certain type of material are closely related to the material's symmetry. Dielectrics with a non-centrosymmetry can become piezoelectric, while pyroelectric materials are actually polar dielectrics. Therefore, not all piezoelectric materials can achieve pyroelectricity since not all non-centrosymmetric dielectrics are necessarily polar.19–21 According to Fig. 1, the number of publications on lead-free materials for pyroelectric property-related studies from 2000 to 2018 is still quite limited compared with other electrical properties, which only makes up ∼4.12% of the total. Fig. 2(a) displays the statistical data on lead-containing and lead-free pyroelectric-related publications from 2000 to 2018. The number of publications on lead-free pyroelectrics shows a significantly increasing trend in recent years and even exceeds those of lead-based materials, where thin films and ceramics account for most research interests as shown in Fig. 2(b).

Over the last several decades, many research groups have summarized the development of pyroelectric-related materials and their applications. For example, Whatmore et al.1,7,8,22–27 concentrated on the physics of pyroelectric detectors and typical ferroelectric materials for thermal IR detectors as well as discussed the response and electronic noise of the devices. Liu et al.9 provided a survey on point pyroelectric detectors and material figures of merit. Porter10 focused on the principles of the pyroelectric detectors’ operation and the relationship between responsivity and frequency. Lang et al.2,20,28–31 discussed the fundamentals and applications of pyroelectricity from different angles and also reviewed some lesser-studied pyroelectric materials like polymers. Lubomirsky and Stafsudd32 introduced different techniques for measuring the pyroelectric coefficient. Furthermore, the role of the pyroelectric effect in thermal energy harvesting and its efficiency in the energy conversion technique have been emphasized by Olsen et al.33–41 since the 1960s. Lingam et al.42 stressed the development of pyroelectric energy harvesting and devices at the nano or micro scale as well as identified their challenges. Sharma et al.43 used finite-element modeling to comparatively study various pyroelectric materials in solar energy harvesting applications. Pandya et al.44 revealed a large energy and power density in a relaxor ferroelectric thin film through a pyroelectric energy conversion. With the fast progress in the development of lead-free pyroelectric materials in recent years, it is necessary to review recent advancements. Herein, we provided a review starting with physics basics and materials to the most recent progresses as well as future prospects on lead-free pyroelectric development. The outline of this review is presented in Fig. 3. In the first part, we gave a background on the pyroelectric effect and its origin, including the characteristic parameters. In the second part, we systematically looked into different forms of pyroelectric materials, from single crystals, a ceramic bulk, inorganic films to polymers and composites. The composition modification, structure analysis and performance comparison were emphasized. In the third part, we investigated recent applications concerning the pyroelectric effect as well as the challenges, possible solutions and future prospects of pyroelectric applications.

2. Background
2.1 Pyroelectric effect and origin
The pyroelectric phenomenon was probably first observed in ancient Greece in 400 BC from tourmaline crystals, which can attract small objects when heated.28 Since the 1930s, the possible origin, specific material performances and potential applications regarding the pyroelectric effect were initially studied.45–51 Beginning in the 1960s, the pyroelectric phenomenon started to be seriously investigated due to its application in thermal detectors.10,22,28,47,52–59 The pyroelectric effect refers to a change in spontaneous polarization due to a temperature fluctuation in certain polar materials. Similar to the piezoelectric effect and converse piezoelectric effect, pyroelectric materials also have their converse effect, namely a electrocaloric effect, which can cause a temperature change due to a variation in polarization.4,19,60 The mechanism of the pyroelectric effect is related to a spontaneous polarization. At a constant temperature, the electric dipoles only randomly vibrate near their aligning axes, resulting in a constant total spontaneous polarization. Under increased temperature, the electric dipoles oscillate within larger angles, thus the total spontaneous polarization as well as the quantity of bound charges is decreased. The free charges accordingly redistribute to compensate for the bound charges, leading to an electron flow, namely a pyroelectric current.1–3,5 Similarly, if the material is cooled instead of heated, a pyroelectric current will also be generated, but in the reverse direction. For dielectrics, the dielectric displacement, D, is defined as: (1)where Q is the charge, A is the sample area of the electrode, ε is the permittivity, E is the external electrical field and P is the polarization. The pyroelectric coefficient, p, is defined by: (2)
In the absence of an external field, the pyroelectric coefficient can be written as: (3)where ip is the pyroelectric current and  is the change in temperature.1,3,4,6 Based on eqn (3), at a given temperature change rate and sample area, the pyroelectric coefficient can be calculated by measuring the pyroelectric current. This calculation method is commonly used for experimental measurements to obtain the pyroelectric coefficient. More specifically, although the intensity of the pyroelectric current is heavily dependent on the temperature change rate and specimen area, the pyroelectric coefficient calculation can be normalized by eqn (3). For materials with anisotropic thermal expansion, the secondary pyroelectric effect should also be considered. If the temperature variation leads to a dimensional change, extra charges will be produced due to the piezoelectric effect although this contribution is usually small.3,5
2.2 Characterization of pyroelectric effect
Due to the different demands in real applications, various materials parameters should be considered in describing a certain pyroelectric property. To compare the responsivity of the pyroelectric sensing performances among different materials, three types of important figures of merit (FOMs) were derived from the pyroelectric coefficient, which are represented as: (4) (5) (6)where Cv is the volume specific heat, ε0 is the permittivity of free space in a vacuum, εr is the dielectric constant and tanδ is the dielectric loss.2,3,29,61–63 The figure of merit expressions shown in eqn (4)–(6) are used to describe different types of pyroelectric responses, where Fi is the potential current responsivity performance, Fv is the voltage responsivity and FD is the detection capability.1 From the definition of the detectivity FOM, FD, which is an important index for the pyroelectric detector performance, we know that a higher pyroelectric coefficient, lower specific heat, lower dielectric constant and dielectric loss are preferred for producing a better pyroelectric sensitivity. In addition to these properties, a higher Curie temperature, fabrication feasibility and more effective cost are also pivotal factors to be considered. In the following sections, the pyroelectric performances of different types of materials were reviewed. Some of the FOM values were not provided in the original literature and were henceforth calculated based on eqn (4)–(6) using the reported data for a better comparison. In addition, to better serve the room temperature pyroelectric applications, only the material performances reported at room temperature were included.
3. Lead-free pyroelectric materials
3.1 Single crystal
Single crystals for pyroelectric applications are widely studied.1,9,11,22,23,64–66 An excellent detectivity and stability can be achieved in single crystal materials by controlling the crystal orientation and domain structures. Table 1 tabulates the pyroelectric properties of the representative single crystal materials. The triglycine sulphate (TGS) family has been a well-known single crystal family for pyroelectric detectors since the 1960s and is usually grown by lowering the temperature or solution evaporation methods.67–71 This group of single crystals provides some of the most substantial pyroelectric FOMs, but is limited by its low Curie temperature (about 49 °C) and hygroscopic property. Many modifications have been attempted for TGS to yield better material performances. For example, Bye et al.72 discovered that the substitution of glycine by L-alanine introduced a high internal bias field in LATGS because the extra methyl group in alanine molecules can prevent molecule rotation within the lattice, thus resulting in permanently poled single-domain crystals. Lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) and lithium niobate (LiNbO3) are also used in the single crystal form as pyroelectric materials. The structures of LiTaO3 and LiNbO3 are similar with a connected distorted oxygen octahedra, usually grown by the Czochralski method.1,3,11,42 Compared with that of LiNbO3, the LiTaO3 single crystal is more commonly used due to the relatively better pyroelectric coefficient (190 μC m−2 K−1) and high Curie temperature (665 °C).23,73,74 Sun et al.75 reported the pyroelectric performances of Mn doped 94.6Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3–5.4BaTiO3 single crystals with 〈001〉, 〈110〉 and 〈111〉 orientations grown by the top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) method. The pyroelectric properties presented in Fig. 4 show anisotropy. The sample with a 〈111〉 orientation exhibited the highest pyroelectric coefficient of 588 μC m−2 K−1 and the lowest dielectric constant of 279, leading to a promising FOM. Strontium barium niobate (SrxBa1−xNb2O6, 0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) is a kind of tungsten bronze ferroelectric with a tetragonal symmetry. It has a high pyroelectric coefficient and low dielectric loss, but a high dielectric constant, resulting in only moderate FOM. Liu et al.76 investigated rare-earth-modified ferroelectric crystals and suggested that the modified SBN could be a candidate for small element detectors or array pyroelectric infrared detectors, while their Curie temperatures were sacrificed. Besides these above-mentioned ferroelectrics, non-ferroelectric single crystals such as Li2B4O7 and ZnO were also studied for their pyroelectric performances, but showed much lower pyroelectric coefficients.6,77,78 Single crystal-type materials are promising for pyroelectric applications with a high p and FOMs. However, they are also greatly limited by the expensive growth technique and difficulty in obtaining products with big sizes.

3.2 Ceramics
Pyroelectric ceramics play a rather important role in pyroelectric applications. They possess a number of advantages, including reliable electrical performances, low cost, easy manufacturing in large areas, and good mechanical properties. It is common to modify the ceramic electrical properties by selecting proper dopants and additives, optimizing phase boundaries, improving synthesis techniques, etc. Several types of lead-free ceramics are extensively studied for their pyroelectric performances, including perovskite, bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSF) and tungsten bronze. The role of chemical modifications and their advances in improving the pyroelectric performance are discussed in this section.

3.2.1 Perovskite-structured ceramics. 
The perovskite structure, with a composition structure of ABX3 as shown in Fig. 5, is well-known as a highly versatile ceramic host.87,88 In the ABX3 cell, A ions at the corner of the unit cell are 12-fold coordinated, while B ions are at the center are octahedrally coordinated. For most typical pyroelectric materials, X is oxygen at the middle of each face.89 The ferroelectricity of perovskite materials is usually believed to be the result of a B site ion displacement along the c-axis from its centrosymmetric position in the unit cell, leading to the generation of a permanent electric dipole.90,91 Therefore, by appropriately changing the composition of the A or B site, one can significantly modify the electrical properties. There are several important lead-free ceramic systems in pyroelectric applications such as BaTiO3-based and Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based ceramics. The pyroelectric performances of lead-free perovskite-structured ceramics are summarized in Table 2.

3.2.1.1 BaTiO3-Based ceramics. 
BaTiO3 is a typical perovskite material that is well-known as a high-dielectric ceramic for capacitors, transducers, etc. It shows a ferroelectric tetragonal phase at room temperature and transforms to a paraelectric cubic phase upon heating to about 130 °C.90 The BaTiO3 ceramic exhibits a relatively low pyroelectric coefficient (200 μC m−2 K−1) and FOMs (Fi = 0.8 × 10−10 m V−1, Fv = 0.008 m2 C−1) at room temperature.6 Recently, many successful attempts in ion substitutions were made to significantly enhance the pyroelectric performance of BaTiO3-based ceramics.92–97 The most effective ion substitutions included Ca2+, Sr2+ in the A site and Zr4+, Sn4+ in the B site. It was found that the Ba1−xCaxZryTi1−yO3 (BCZT) compositions possessed an extremely high piezoelectric coefficient (d33 ∼ 630 pC N−1) as well as an excellent coupling factor (kp) of 0.56 at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB).92,94,95,98,99 In addition, the proper selection of dopants can shift the polymorphic phase transition (PPT) to about room temperature, resulting in a high pyroelectric performance. One typical example demonstrated by Liu et al.98 showed that a tricritical triple point of the cubic paraelectric phase (C), ferroelectric rhombohedral (R) and tetragonal (T) phases in a Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3–(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT–BCT) material system could be achieved at about 57 °C. The existence of the C–R–T triple point displayed in Fig. 6(a) led to a high electrical performance such as piezoelectricity (620 pC N−1) and dielectric permittivity at the MPB. Furthermore, Liu et al.93 also reported an enhanced pyroelectric coefficient of 860 μC m−2 K−1 and high FOMs in Li-doped Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.9Zr0.1O3 prepared by the citrate method. The polymorphic phase transition occurring near room temperature as well as the coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases decreased the energy barrier. Therefore, the polarization rotation and domain wall motion become easier, resulting in high pyroelectric properties. Sr-doped Ba0.85Ca0.15−xZr0.1Ti0.9O3–Srx also showed improved pyroelectric properties. An extremely large pyroelectric coefficient of 2500 μC m−2 K−1 was obtained in Ba0.85Sr0.15Ti0.9Zr0.1O3.95 However, its Curie temperature was greatly reduced from 84 °C to only 35 °C. The large polarization variation near the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition could have been the reason for this high pyroelectric property, but this low phase transition temperature also limited its realistic application at the same time. The Sr substitution in the A site contributed to the increase in internal stress and local compositional inhomogeneity, thus causing a decrease in the Curie temperature. The substitution of Sn4+ in the B site was studied in detail. For BaTi1−xSnxO3, the pyroelectric coefficient was observed to be 300 μC m−2 K−1 when x = 0.05.96 For the Sr and Sn co-doped BCZT composition, a promoted pyroelectric coefficient of 1117 μC m−2 K−1 as well as a high dielectric constant of 4200 were observed, which might have been attributed to the polymorphic phase transition occurring around room temperature.94

3.2.1.2 Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-Based ceramics. 
The Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT)-based composition has been extensively studied for pyroelectric applications because it has a strong ferroelectricity with a large remanent polarization, Pr, (38 μC cm−2) and a relatively high Curie temperature (320 °C).100–102 BNT ceramics exhibit a complex perovskite structure, where Bi3+ and Na+ occupy their A site and Ti4+ occupies its B site.102–104 Since it was first discovered with a rhombohedral R3c structure at room temperature by Smolenskii et al.105 in the 1960s, massive efforts were devoted to the study of BNT-based ceramics. It is known that a pure BNT ceramic is difficult to be well polarized because of the large coercive field (∼7 kV mm−1) as well as the high conductivity caused by Bi3+ volatilization during the sintering process. Therefore, several chemical modification strategies were introduced for the BNT-based material system to enhance the electrical performance. The strategies include ion substitution, especially in the A site,102,106–110 solid solution system formation with other ABO3 material systems,111–120 the construction of morphotropic phase boundaries (MPB),100,121–124 and addition of appropriate oxides.101,115–117,125–128 A moderate pyroelectric coefficient of around 250 μC m−2 K−1 was often observed in a pure BNT ceramic prepared by the solid-state method.129,130 An enhanced pyroelectric coefficient of 707 μC m−2 K−1 in a pure BNT ceramic prepared by the sol–gel method was achieved because of the high crystallinity and homogenous grain growth on the nanoscale provided by chemical routes.131 However, the electrical performances of pure BNT ceramics are still limited. In this case, ion substitution can be a powerful tool to tailor electrical properties. The addition of K+, Li+ and Ba2+ in the A site are the most extensively studied ion substitution strategies, which exhibits promising pyroelectric properties as shown in Table 2. For example, (1 − x)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–xBaTiO3 (BNT–BT) is considered one of the most useful candidates among BNT-based material systems. There exists a rhombohedral and tetragonal MPB in BNT–BT when x = 0.06–0.07, resulting in the enhancement of piezoelectric, dielectric and pyroelectric properties.132–134 The highest room temperature pyroelectric coefficient of (1 − x)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–xBaTiO3 was 440 μC m−2 K−1 when x = 0.07 due to the coexistence of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases.111 For 0.93(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3–0.07Ba(Ti0.945Zr0.055)O3 (BNT–BZT), a room temperature pyroelectric coefficient of 570 μC m−2 K−1 was achieved, which was twice that in a pure BNT ceramic. The pyroelectric coefficient enhancement could be explained by the larger lattice structure distortion induced by the ion substitution of a larger Zr4+ (RZr4+ = 0.72 Å) for Ti4+ (RTi4+ = 0.61 Å). In addition, an extremely high pyroelectric coefficient of 22100 μC m−2 K−1 was observed at 87 °C, which was near the depolarization temperature, Td. The ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition near the Td contributed to a significant change in polarization.111 An ultrahigh room temperature pyroelectric performance of 2720 μC m−2 K−1 and FOMs are demonstrated by Shen et al. in 0.94(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3–0.06Ba(Ti0.75Zr0.25)O3 as shown in Fig. 7.135 Upon heating, the nanodomains transformed from the ferroelectric phase to the antiferroelectric relaxor phase with a dramatic decrease in total electric polarization, which led to a high pyroelectric response. By introducing Zr4+ into the B site and modulating the Zr4+/Ti4+ ratio, this phase transition was brought to a near room temperature, resulting in ultrahigh pyroelectric performances. Similarly, for a 0.5% La and 0.2% Ta co-doped 0.94(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3–0.06BaTiO3 material system, an improved pyroelectric coefficient of 1292 μC m−2 K−1 at room temperature was also demonstrated with a moderate dielectric constant of ∼600.116 To further improve the pyroelectric properties, other ABO3 perovskite material systems were also introduced as shown in Table 2 such as BiAlO3, NaNbO3, and K0.5Na0.5NbO3.118–120 The proper addition of the ABO3 material systems favored the grain growth and resulted in denser microstructures in the BNT-based ceramics.118,119 More importantly, the tailored phase transition temperatures were responsible for the enhanced pyroelectric property. For example, in (1 − x)(0.98Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–0.02BiAlO3)–xNa0.5K0.5NbO3 (BNT–BA–KNN), the addition of KNN induced the formation of a tetragonal structure and broke the long-range symmetry in the BNT lattices. As a result, the reaction energy as well as the ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transition temperature decreased. Therefore, the pyroelectric property of the BNT–BA–KNN ternary material system improved to p = 842 μC m−2 K−1 (x = 0.02) at room temperature.119

3.2.1.3 Other perovskite ceramics. 
Among the lead-free perovskite candidates, the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN)-based ceramic is one of the most extensively studied material systems because of its high piezoelectric performance (d33 = 171–490 pC N−1) and relatively high Curie temperature (TC = 178–475 °C).145 In addition, the phase boundary construction and doping engineering play rather important roles in improving the electrical properties of KNN material systems.145,146 However, KNN-based ceramics endure a poor resistivity to humidity as well as difficulty in the sintering process to achieve a compact microstructure and high density.18,147–149 In addition, compared with studies on the large piezoelectricity, the pyroelectric property of the KNN-based ceramics was less attractive.114,136 For example, Lau et al.136 investigated the representative pyroelectric performances of the [(K0.5Na0.5)0.96Li0.04](Nb0.84Ta0.1Sb0.06)O3 material system. The pyroelectricity is limited with a relatively low pyroelectric coefficient, p = 190 μC m−2 K−1, and a high dielectric constant, εr = 1520, resulting in low FOMs. More recently, the pyroelectricity in antiferroelectric (AFE) AgNbO3 was studied. Li et al.137 demonstrated the existence of a AFE orthorhombic and FE rhombohedral phase boundary in the (1 − x)AgNbO3–xLiTaO3 (AN–LT) composition (Fig. 8). The increasing LT content exhibited an effect on the phase transition from AFE to FE. Relatively high FOMs were obtained due to the moderate pyroelectric coefficient of 368 μC m−2 K−1 and low dielectric constant of εr = 252.

Perovskite-type ceramics are very promising for pyroelectric applications. However, it is difficult to meet the demand of a high pyroelectric performance and high Curie temperature at the same time. Their FOMs were still not comparable to those of lead-based ceramics as shown in Table 2. An increased dielectric constant is usually observed with an enhanced pyroelectric coefficient, resulting in almost unchanged FOMs. Therefore, it is important to find a balance in the material performance based on the realistic requirement.


3.2.2 BLSF ceramics. 
Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSF) were first reported by Aurivillius in 1949 with a general formula of (Bi2O2)2+(Am−1BmO3m+1)2−.150 Therefore, these types of ferroelectric oxides were also named as Aurivillius phase materials. Generally, this structure is composed of (Am−1BmO3m+1)2− pseduo-perovskite blocks that are interleaved by (Bi2O2)2+ layers along the c-axis as shown in Fig. 9, where m is the number of BO6 octahedral layers (m = 1–5). In the composition, A stands for the lower chemical valence cations with a 12 coordination such as K+, Na+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, Bi3+ and La3+. B stands for the higher chemical valence cations with a 6 coordination, including Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+, and W6+.16,150–152 Similar to the perovskite-structured materials, the spontaneous polarization of BLSF mainly arose from the B site ion displacement in the pseduo-perovskite layers.153 The BLSF ceramics usually exhibit a high Curie temperature (∼500–900 °C) and large anisotropy in the electromechanical coefficient, but a low dielectric constant (∼80–200), low piezoelectric coefficient (∼10 pC N−1) and low pyroelectric coefficient (∼30–120 μC m−2 K−1) as shown in Table 3.140,151,154–157 However, it is still possible to yield relatively high FOMs for pyroelectric applications because their dielectric permittivity and loss are much lower compared with other material systems. Some typical BLSF ceramics have been investigated regarding their pyroelectric performances such as MBi4Ti4O15 (M = Na0.5Bi0.5, Na0.5La0.5, Ca, Sr), Bi4Ti3O12, and CaBi2Nb2O9. For example, Na0.5La0.5Bi4Ti4O15 and (Na0.5Bi0.5)0.95Ca0.05Bi4Ti4O15 showed similar pyroelectric coefficients of 74 and 68 μC m−2 K−1, respectively, resulting in limited FOMs.140,154 To further modify the pyroelectric performances of the BLSF ceramics, Mn is commonly selected as an additional element to effectively prevent conductivity at high temperatures.140,154,155,157 This allows more complete polarization to be achieved during the poling process. In addition, Mn-dopant plays an important role in enhancing the pyroelectric coefficient and decreasing the dielectric permittivity and loss as shown in Fig. 10.155 When the Mn2+ cations were doped at the B site to replace Ti4+, a larger distortion in the BO6 octahedron as well as the oxygen vacancies were created. The defects impeded the domain to reverse, thus stabilizing the domain structure and suppressing the dielectric constant. For (Na0.5Bi0.5)0.95Ca0.05Bi4Ti4O15, when 0.1 wt% Mn was doped, the pyroelectric coefficient was slightly increased to 100 μC m−2 K−1 and the dielectric constant was reduced from 151 to 134.140,154 Furthermore, the grain orientation technique was considered to provide higher pyroelectric properties for the BLSF ceramics. For example, Takenaka et al.154 studied BLSF ceramics prepared by the hot-forging (HF) method, which produced ceramics with well-oriented grains. During HF treatment, a slip between Bi2O2 and the pseduo-perovskite layer was induced, resulting in almost aligned c-axes. They suggested that the HF method could be an effective way to enhance the pyroelectric properties due to the grain orientation effect. However, a realistic application is still very limited because of the low pyroelectric coefficient and FOMs.

3.2.3 Tungsten bronze ceramics. 
Lead-free tungsten bronze materials have drawn increasing attention in recent years due to their interesting dielectric, piezoelectric, ferroelectric, pyroelectric and nonlinear optical properties. The tungsten bronze structure has a general formula of (A1)4(A2)2(C)4(B1)2(B2)8O30.158,159 As shown in Fig. 11, it is a complex array that consists of a BO6 octahedra framework connected by corners, where A1, A2 and C are interstice cations with 15-, 12- and 9-fold coordination sites, respectively.160 A1 and A2 are usually filled by bivalent or trivalent cations such as Li+, Na+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Ca2+ and La3+, whereas high valence cations like Nb5+, Ta5+ and W6+ are common choices for B1 and B2 sites. The C site is the smallest interstice and is often empty in the structure.158 A large number of tungsten bronze ceramics can be formed with rather distinct electrical features, which are heavily dependent on the number of occupied sites, the ion radius and select cation charges.161Table 4 shows the room temperature pyroelectric performances of typical lead-free tungsten bronze ceramics. Among the tungsten bronze ceramics, Sr1−xBaxNb2O6 (SBN) (0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) and BaxSr4−xNa2Nb10O30 (BSNN) are two series that were extensively studied for their pyroelectric properties. To modify the tungsten bronze ceramics, strategies including Sr/Ba ratio adjustment, MPB construction, doping engineering and synthesis optimization can be effective.

Zhang et al.163 demonstrated the effect of the Sr/Ba ratio on the electrical properties of Sr1−xBaxNb2O6 (x = 0.50, 0.45, 0.40 and 0.30) ceramics. Ceramics with a larger Sr content were found to exhibit a decreased Curie temperature from 164 to 84 °C and a low coercive field, while both the dielectric constant and pyroelectric coefficient were increased at room temperature. The highest pyroelectric coefficient was about 200 μC m−2 K−1 when x = 0.50. In addition, a relaxor behavior was observed in the SBN ceramics, which might have been due to the short-range ordered polar nanoregions (PNRs) induced by compositional fluctuations. With increasing smaller Sr2+ content in the tungsten bronze structure, the polar disorder may have been enhanced, resulting in a lower TC. Moreover, the improved Pr contributed by the higher Sr content made the polarization easier, thus leading to a higher pyroelectric coefficient. To further improve the pyroelectric property of the SBN ceramics, Ca was selected as a doping element to form Cax(Sr0.5Ba0.5)1−xNb2O6 compositions (x = 0.00, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20).162 The pyroelectric properties of the Cax(Sr0.5Ba0.5)1−xNb2O6 ceramics are displayed in Fig. 12. The Ca0.15(Sr0.5Ba0.5)0.85Nb2O6 ceramic revealed the highest p = 361 μC m−2 K−1 and relatively high FOMs (Fi = 1.72 × 10−10 m V−1, Fv = 0.021 m2 C−1, FD = 1.15 × 10−5 Pa−1/2) at room temperature, while the Curie temperature did not show a big difference. The enhanced pyroelectric coefficient may have been caused by the higher atomic displacement in the unit cell. When an appropriate amount of smaller Ca2+ substitutes Sr2+ and Ba2+, an increased structural distortion was created. As a result, a higher spontaneous polarization was obtained, resulting in the higher pyroelectric coefficient. Similarly, a slightly higher pyroelectric coefficient was obtained in the Ca-doped Cax(Sr0.6Ba0.4)4−xNa2Nb10O30 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5) ceramics.159 A maximum p = 168 μC m−2 K−1 was observed at x = 0.3. Moreover, the hot forging (HF) method could be considered as an effective way to fabricate textured tungsten bronze ceramics with a high pyroelectric performance. Venet et al.164 prepared textured SrxBa1−xNb2O6 (x = 0.53, 0.63) ceramics by the HF process. The textured Sr0.53Ba0.47Nb2O6 ceramic cut in the perpendicular direction to the pressing axis exhibited a strong anisotropy in the electric properties similar to single crystals. A high pyroelectric coefficient of 510 μC m−2 K−1 and excellent FOMs (Fi = 2.30 × 10−10 m V−1, Fv = 0.028 m2 C−1, FD = 1.87 × 10−5 Pa−1/2) were achieved at room temperature.

Fig. 13 illustrates the pyroelectric performance and Curie temperature of representative lead-free ceramics with different structures for comparison with lead-based ceramics. The pyroelectric properties and Curie temperature range were closely related to the material type. The tungsten bronze ceramics showed a poor pyroelectric coefficient and FOM values with a low Curie temperature range around 100 to 200 °C. The BLSF ceramics possessed a very high Curie temperature (∼500–900 °C), but the poor pyroelectric properties were not comparable with that of lead-based ceramics. For the perovskite ceramics, they exhibited a wide Curie temperature range (∼80–420 °C) and an excellent pyroelectric coefficient that was even higher than that for lead-based ceramics, which is promising for pyroelectric applications. However, the high pyroelectric coefficient of the perovskite ceramics usually comes along with a high dielectric constant, thus resulting in limited FOMs. Furthermore, the improvement in the pyroelectric coefficient has a common trend of sacrificing the material's Curie temperature. The high pyroelectric performance and high Curie temperature are hard to be obtained at the same time. Therefore, the balance of the material's performance and application temperature range should be considered.

3.3 Inorganic films
Compared with single crystals and bulk ceramics, inorganic films are able to provide a smaller heat capacity and lower fabrication cost, which are beneficial for pyroelectric applications. Therefore, considerable attention was focused on pyroelectric thin and thick films. Generally, high quality films can be obtained by proper synthesis techniques. For thin films, deposition techniques such as sputtering, sol–gel, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical solution deposition (CSD) are commonly used.170–172 For thick films, preparation methods include screen printing, sol–gel and aerosol deposition.173–175Table 5 lists the room temperature pyroelectric properties of representative lead-free thin films and thick films. It can be seen that the thin film pyroelectric performances are strongly influenced by many factors such as the material composition, selected substrate, preparation technique, buffer layer and film thickness. In addition, microscopic aspects such as the microstructure, grain orientation and residual stress are also important. Among the lead-free thin films, Ba1−xSrxTiO3 (BST) was used for uncooled pyroelectric infrared detectors due to its high pyroelectric coefficient and relatively low dielectric constant.176–180 For example, Zhang et al.179 synthesized a Ba0.64Sr0.36TiO3 thin film by the sol–gel method. The pyroelectric coefficient at room temperature was 1860 μC m−2 K−1 and produced a higher FOM value than the BST bulk because of the reduced thickness. Furthermore, Jin et al.178 observed a large pyroelectric coefficient of around 15000 μC m−2 K−1 in a Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 thin film graded ferroelectric device (GFD) at room temperature (Fig. 14). This large, effective pyroelectric coefficient in the device was mainly contributed by the compositional gradient, which was excited with a strong periodic electric field. In this case, free charges were found to accumulate on one electrode, resulting in the internal voltage bias that triggered the charge separation. Although BST thin films can exhibit quite high pyroelectric performances, their applications are only available at room temperature due to their low Curie temperature (TC ∼ 36–42 °C).179,180 Moreover, BaTi1−xSnxO3 (BST) thin films were also studied as promising candidates for room temperature pyroelectric applications. When the B site Ti4+ ions were partially substituted by Sn4+, the phase transition was greatly affected. If x > 0.1, only a rhombohedral to cubic phase transition (∼20 °C) was expected among the temperature range. Therefore, the structural induced ferroelectric property change was more stable near the Curie temperature.181,182 Wang et al.181 studied the pyroelectric performance of the BaTi0.85Sn0.15O3 thin film with a highly (h00) orientation. The relatively large p = 1790 μC m−2 K−1 and FD = 4.4 × 10−5 Pa−1/2 were obtained at room temperature. With the higher texture, a larger dielectric constant and pyroelectric coefficient were obtained and the tensile stresses decreased with the increasing film thickness. For low-frequency applications, thick films can achieve certain advantages because the higher thickness can lead to a larger voltage response. Zhang et al.183 demonstrated the pyroelectric performance in a 40 μm-thick MnO doped 0.82Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3–0.18Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 film. The thick film prepared by screen printing exhibited an even higher p = 380 μC m−2 K−1 and FD = 1.10 × 10−5 Pa−1/2 than that of the ceramic bulk (p = 170 μC m−2 K−1, FD = 0.66 × 10−5 Pa−1/2), showing the possibility for a realistic application.125

3.4 Polymer and composite
Polymer materials are widely used as electrical insulators because they are usually nonconductive at low temperatures. However, in the past few decades, polymers showing piezoelectric, pyroelectric, ferroelectric or conductive properties have also been discovered.195 Compared with inorganic pyroelectric materials, polymers have certain advantages, including a low dielectric permittivity and low acoustic impedance. In addition, polymeric materials are light, flexible and can be easily fabricated in a large area with a low cost. Due to these properties, polymers have been largely utilized in many industrial fields such as actuators, ultrasonic devices, infrared detectors, and lithium ion batteries.31,196 Among numerous polymer materials, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a repeat unit of (–CH2–CF2–) is distinguishable due to its much higher piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 33 pC N−1) and pyroelectric coefficient (p = 25 μC m−2 K−1) compared with other polymeric materials.31,197 At the same time, PVDF exhibits a low dielectric constant (εr = 9) and thermal stability up to ∼120 °C, making it possible to yield high pyroelectric FOMs.31Fig. 15 illustrates the three crystallization forms in PVDF, namely the α, β and γ form, which are distinct in the trans (T) or gauche (G) chain conformation.198 Only the β form with the TTTT chain conformation showed a polarity with an orthorhombic Amm2 symmetry, which led to the piezoelectricity. However, the α form (TGTG′) and γ form (TTTGTTTG′) can be converted to the β form by mechanical stretching.199 Moreover, based on PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride–trifluoroethylene (P(VDF–TrFE)) the copolymers were found to be ferroelectrics. With the addition of TrFE, the copolymer directly crystallized in the β form with pyroelectricity, and the electrical properties were tailored by adjusting the VDF/TrFE ratio.3 The pyroelectric properties of the PVDF and P(VDF/TrFE) polymers are listed in Table 6. For example, P(VDF/TrFE) 80/20 exhibited a pyroelectric coefficient of 31 μC m−2 K−1.200,201 Although this value was much lower than those of the other pyroelectric materials like ceramics, it also generated a relatively high figure of merit (FD = 1.40 × 10−5 Pa−1/2) because of its low dielectric constant (εr = 9) and loss (tanδ = 0.015). Furthermore, other polar polymers were also expected to show useful pyroelectric properties such as PVC, PAA and polyamide 11 as shown in Table 6.84,195,202 However, their pyroelectricity was much weaker than that of PVDF and P(VDF–TrFE).

Although pyroelectrics like a single crystal and ceramic can generate a quite high pyroelectric coefficient, their FOMs are largely limited by their high dielectric permittivity and thermal conductivity. Considering the material's modifications, the fabrication of a pyroelectric–polymer composite is another possible way to combine advantages from both sides. The composites may exhibit expected properties such as much lower dielectric constant than ceramics, lower specific heat, light weight, improved mechanical flexibility, and low fabrication cost. Therefore, pyroelectric composites where ceramic particles or fibres are embedded in the polymer matrix are synthesized with a connectivity of 0–3 and 1–3, respectively. The composites, which have a large polymer percentage, are usually fabricated by hot pressing and solvent casting methods.211,212Fig. 16(a) illustrates the inner structure of the 0–3 composite. Under an electric field, the local electric field of the piezoelectric nanoparticle led to an enhanced polarization as displayed in Fig. 16(b).213Table 7 lists the pyroelectric performances of representative composites with different lead-free ceramics and polymers. High pyroelectric performance polymers like PVDF and P(VDF/TrFE) were commonly selected as the organic matrix. Other polymeric materials like PVC and HA were also investigated by some studies. For example, Batra et al.214 investigated the pyroelectric coefficient and FOMs of TGS–PVDF composites. The composite with 80 vol% TGS fabricated by tape casting exhibited a high p = 90 μC m−2 K−1, which was much higher than that of the pure PVDF. At the same time, the composite still had a low dielectric constant of εr = 12, leading to considerably high FOMs. Olszowy et al.215 reported the electrical properties of BaTiO3–PVC with different BaTiO3 volume percentages. The value of the pyroelectric coefficient increased with an increasing ceramic volume fraction. BaTiO3–PVC with 40 vol% ceramic had a relatively large p = 106 μC m−2 K−1 as well as a small dielectric dispersion and loss. More recently, Lam et al.216 synthesized the (Bi0.5Na0.5)0.94Ba0.06TiO3–P(VDF/TrFE) (70/30) 0–3 composites with 30 vol% ceramics by solvent casting [Fig. 16(c)]. The p and εr were 47 μC m−2 K−1 and 21, respectively [Fig. 16(d)]. Although the p value was much lower than that of the ceramic bulk with the same composition, the FOM was actually enhanced when simply comparing the p/εr ratio. Therefore, the control of the dielectric constant is rather important in yielding high pyroelectric FOMs. Generally speaking, the different lead-free pyroelectric materials discussed above, including single crystals, ceramics, inorganic films, polymers and pyroelectric–polymer composites have their own advantages and weaknesses. In realistic applications, proper materials should be selected based on the required figure of merit, material size, product cost, working environment, material stability, availability, etc.

4. Innovative applications and effects
Pyroelectric materials have long been used in thermal detectors, especially for infrared radiation.1,3,9–11 Pyroelectric detectors can sense radiation over the full electromagnetic spectrum and require no cooling. Therefore, they can be used in devices such as intruder alarms, fire alarms, gas analysers, radiometers, laser detectors, and uncooled thermal imaging devices.1,25,224–227 More recently, many innovative applications and effects regarding pyroelectricity have been developed. Herein, we briefly introduced the recent progress in pyroelectric energy harvesting, the electrocaloric effect and the role of porosity in improving the pyroelectric figures of merit.
4.1 Pyroelectric energy harvesting
Nowadays, energy harvesting has gained extensive attention due to growing energy demands. In the past few decades, thermal to electrical energy harvesting mainly depended on the thermoelectric or Seebeck effect, which can produce a voltage when there is temperature difference between the two ends of the device.228,229 However, in the environment where the temperature is uniformly distributed, the Seebeck effect can no longer be used. Under this circumstance, pyroelectric energy harvesting can be an option if there is a certain temperature fluctuation. Therefore, the pyroelectric effect can be very useful in wasted energy and solar energy harvesting.43,78 To characterize the energy harvesting capability more easily, the electro-thermal coupling factor, k, pyroelectric energy harvesting figure of merit, FE, and modified figure of merit, FE′, can be used, which are expressed as: (7) (8) (9)where Thot is the maximum working temperature.6,38,43,113,230,231 For energy harvesting applications, k indicates the effectiveness, FE is used to compare the power generation ability and FE′ is used with consideration of the specific heat. Considering that the volume specific heat is not very different among different material systems, pyroelectric materials with a high pyroelectric coefficient are more beneficial in yielding high energy harvesting performances. The pyroelectric energy harvesting figures of merit for representative lead-free materials are listed in Table 8. For example, the LiTaO3 single crystal with a relatively high pyroelectric coefficient, p = 190 μC m−2 K−1, and low εr = 47 obtained a high k2 = 0.81% and FE′ = 8.5 × 10−12 m3 J−1, which was around two times higher than that of PZT, whose FOMs were 0.34% and 4.6 × 10−12 m3 J−1, respectively.23,230 In addition, pyroelectric energy harvesting studies have been developed towards the nanoscale, including nanowires and nanofibers, which exhibit a lower defect density, better mechanical properties and even an enhanced pyroelectric performance for energy harvesting applications. For example, Yang et al.78 demonstrated the pyroelectric ZnO nanowire arrays in thermal to electrical energy harvesting. The temperature fluctuation caused anisotropic polarization in ZnO nanowires, thus driving the electrons to flow. The measured pyroelectric coefficient of the ZnO nanowires was ∼1.2–1.5 nC cm−2 K, which was higher than that of the ZnO bulk (0.94 nC cm−2 K) and ZnO film (1.0 nC cm−2 K).

Furthermore, energy harvesting devices with a high flexibility have attracted increasing attention in recent years. These transformable materials are quite useful in applications such as wearable devices, biomedical devices, and electronic textiles.222,234–238 When the materials used in energy operation moved to an even smaller scale, the idea of a nanogenerator was proposed since electricity can be generated from mechanical or thermal energy.5,78,239,240 The development of energy harvesting devices powdered by nanoscale materials is promising for reducing power consumption and building small size electronics. For example, Lee et al.234 presented a highly stretchable piezoelectric–pyroelectric nanogenerator device to harvest both mechanical energy and thermal energy as shown in Fig. 17(a) and (b). This energy harvesting device was fabricated as a layered structure with graphene and a micro-patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–carbon nanotube (CNT) composite served as the top and bottom electrodes, respectively. High performance P(VDF–TrFE) was used to provide the piezoelectric–pyroelectric response. In their study, a stable pyroelectric power output was obtained under various thermal gradients and stretching conditions. Yang et al.78 designed a pyroelectric nanogenerator structure as shown in Fig. 17(c) and (d) to harvest wasted heat using nanotechnology. ZnO nanowire arrays were grown on an ITO substrate and an Ag film was used as the top electrode. With the time-dependent change in the temperature, a polarization electric field was created along the ZnO nanowire, which generated pyroelectric current and voltage coefficients of around 1.2–1.5 nC cm−2 K and 2.5–4.0 × 104 V m−1 K−1, respectively. In addition, Yang et al. also reported a similar structure, where a flexible composite of KNbO3 nanowires and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer were fabricated.222 The output pyroelectric current and voltage were modulated by tuning the ferroelectric domains.

4.2 Electrocaloric effect
The electrocaloric effect is the reversed process of the pyroelectric effect, which refers to the reversible temperature change induced by a polarization variation. According to Scott,241 the basic idea of the electrocaloric effect is an entropy change due to variation in the temperature or electric field, where the process may endure different thermal steps, including an isoentropic, isothermal and constant field. For instance, if the temperature is increased, entropy can be restored by increasing the electric field. Although it has been studied since 1930s, only a weak electrocaloric effect was observed in the past few decades. The adiabatic temperature change, ΔT, from the electrocaloric effect was less than 2 °C. Very recently, a large electrocaloric effect was reported in a ferroelectric thin film and polymer.242,243 The observed temperature change was even higher than 12 °C, making it promising for next-generation refrigeration applications. Based on Maxwell relations, the isothermal entropy change, ΔS, and adiabatic temperature change, ΔT, can be expressed as: (10) (11)where E is electric field, D is electric displacement, T is temperature and CE is the specific heat capacity.4 In the realistic refrigeration application, electrocaloric materials should possess a large pyroelectric coefficient and small heat capacity over a broad electric field range to yield a large ΔS and ΔT. Table 9 illustrates the electrocarloric properties of some representative lead-free inorganics and polymers. Although single crystals can exhibit a large pyroelectric coefficient as discussed in the earlier content, SrTiO3 and KTaO3 single crystals measured at low temperature showed a small ΔT, which was 0.3 and 0.25 K, respectively.244,245 For the Ba0.73Sr0.27TiO3 ceramic, it showed a relatively large adiabatic temperature change of 1 °C at room temperature when the electric field was 2.4 MV m−1.246 Chen et al.247 prepared a 200 nm SrBiTa2O9 BLSF thin film by the sol–gel method. It was applied in a high electric field of 60 MV m−1, allowing for the generation of a high electrocaloric performance. The observed ΔT near a Curie temperature of 288 °C was 4.93 K. Compared with the inorganic materials, organics, especially P(VDF/TrFE) copolymers, are more attractive in electrocaloric applications. For example, Neese and coworkers243 first demonstrated a large electrocaloric effect in polymer. The P(VDF–TrFE) 55/45 mol% copolymer had a low ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition temperature around 70 °C, which was beneficial for room temperature applications. The measured ΔT and ΔS were 12.6 K and 62 J kg−1 K−1 at 80 °C, where a 209 MV m−1 electric field was applied. Moreover, for the electron-irradiated P(VDF–TrFE) 68/32 mol% copolymer, an enhanced ΔT and ΔS was obtained, which were 20 K and 95 J kg−1 K−1 near room temperature.248 In addition, the required electric field was reduced to 160 MV m−1. For the normal P(VDF–TrFE) 68/32 mol% copolymer, it had a first-order ferroelectric–paraelectric phase transition. After high-energy electron irradiation, the copolymer was converted to a relaxor ferroelectric, which showed a higher effectiveness in generating the electrocaloric effect.

4.3 Role of porosity
As discussed in the earlier section, bulk ceramic and films are able to generate a large pyroelectric coefficient. To achieve high FOMs for detection and energy harvesting applications, a high pyroelectric coefficient and low dielectric constant are preferred as shown in eqn (4)–(9). However, the realistic FOM values are usually greatly limited due to the high εr. Material modification methods are commonly used like compositional design, phase boundary construction or synthesis optimization and generally result in the enhancement of p and εr at the same time. The significant increase in the εr may have weaken the FOMs. In this case, intentionally introducing an uniformly distributed porosity into the material system was considered as a solution.27,254 Although the porosity may have sacrificed the pyroelectric coefficient compared with that for compact materials, the existence of the porosity played an important role in significantly reducing the εr. In addition, the porous microstructure may have provided a lower volume specific heat. Therefore, the ultimate FOM value was improved when the εr decreased more significantly than the p. Porous pyroelectrics can be produced by several methods, including burned-out polymer process, templating method, gel-casting, and polymer replication, etc.255–257 Zhang et al.258 studied the influence of porosity in Bi0.5(Na0.82K0.18)0.5TiO3 (BKNT) thick films prepared by screen printing. Fig. 18 displays the morphology and electrical properties of BKNT thick films with various porosities. The dielectric constants of the 19% and 32% porosity films were greatly reduced from 603 in the dense film to 161 and 56, respectively. At the same time, the pyroelectric coefficient only slightly decreased from 460 to about 420 μC m−2 K−1. As a result, the FD was increased from 1.1 to 3.8 × 10−5 Pa−1/2. Sharma et al.259 synthesized porous Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 ceramics and used a PMMA polymer as the pore former. The ceramic porosity increased from 8% to 29% when the PMMA content increased from 0 to 10 wt%. The pyroelectric coefficient decreased from 750 to 470 μC m−2 K−1 while the dielectric constant dropped from 3500 to 1150, resulting in an enhanced FE = 20.1 J m−3 K−2 and FE′ = 5.6 × 10−12 m3 J−1. Moreover, Zhang et al.260 reported an enhanced pyroelectric coefficient in PMMA burned-out porous Ba0.67Sr0.33TiO3 ceramics. When the porosity increased from 1% to 9.6%, the p was even enhanced from 5000 to 8000 μC m−2 K−1, while the εr was effectively reduced from 12000 to 8000. In the end, the FD improved from 11 to 27 × 10−5 Pa−1/2, which is promising for pyroelectric applications.

5. Conclusion and prospect
Lead-free materials play an increasingly important role in achieving high-performance pyroelectric applications. In this review, we systematically discussed the physical mechanisms of the pyroelectric effect and recent progress in lead-free pyroelectrics of different forms. Among the various lead-free pyroelectric materials, single crystals can provide a high p and FOMs for pyroelectric detectors. However, they are limited by a high cost and large size availability. Ceramics with different crystalline structures can provide a wide working temperature range, but usually obtain smaller FOMs due to a high dielectric constant. Inorganic films are more cost-effective and usually exhibit moderate pyroelectric performances. Polymers and composites cannot generate a very high pyroelectric coefficient, but they can be quite useful in electrocaloric effect applications. From the development of lead-free pyroelectric materials, we know that they can be promising to replace the lead-based pyroelectric materials. At the same time, some challenges still exist for practical applications. To obtain high FOMs, the dielectric constant needs to be controlled without severely influencing the pyroelectric coefficient. For phase transition-induced high-performance pyroelectric materials, the stability of the materials also needs to be considered. As a result, lead-free pyroelectric materials may achieve practical applications in the near future.
