    , Accepted 16th January 2020First published on 17th January 2020AbstractFabrication of high-quality, low-cost and large-scale solution processable inorganic hole-transport layers (HTLs) for planar p–i–n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is still a challenge that must be overcome to produce stable devices. Herein, we demonstrate the development of large-scale (>60 cm2), highly uniform and dopant-free NiO films via spray pyrolysis, and we show their subsequent application as a HTL in triple-cation PSCs. The spray deposited NiO films are highly crystalline in nature with a (111) oriented nanostructured morphology. We show outstanding optoelectronic properties (Eg ≈ 3.78 eV, work function ≈ 4.86 eV) that led to improved optical absorption and better energy band alignment with the perovskite layer. Compared to the state-of-the-art PEDOT:PSS based PSCs, these spray-deposited NiO-based devices exhibited an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼17.3%, which is the highest reported value for dopant-free NiO-based PSCs prepared via the spray-deposition technique. More importantly, the NiO based PSCs also showed extremely high reproducibility and scalable device performance, achieving a PCE of 12.3% at an aperture area of ∼1.04 cm2. Moreover, unencapsulated PSCs employing spray-deposited NiO exhibited outstanding stability, maintaining ∼87% PCE after 4500 h of aging in a N2 atmosphere, and encapsulated devices exhibited much better stability retaining >82% of the initial PCE after 200 h in a harsh environment (85 °C, 85% relative humidity).
1. Introduction
In the past decade, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been the primary research focus in the field of photovoltaics because of their low material costs, solution processability, excellent optoelectronic properties and, most importantly, extremely high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–4 A record-breaking PCE of ∼25.2% has recently been achieved atthe laboratory scale using a single-junction PSC.5 The high efficiencies of PSCs arise mainly from the exceptional material properties of the active perovskite absorber, which has a high absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility and band gap tunability.1–4,6,7 Generally, the perovskite absorber is sandwiched between electron transport layers (ETLs) and hole transport layers (HTLs) in PSCs to yield an n–i–p or p–i–n configuration. To produce high-performance PSCs with good stability, a series of organic/inorganic materials have been extensively investigated as ETLs and HTLs to fabricate PSCs in different configurations.8,9 Currently, the research focus is on the exploration of inorganic ETL materials such as titanium dioxide (TiO2)10–13 and tin oxide (SnO2)1,14 and inorganic HTL materials such as nickel oxide (NiOx)15,16 and copper thiocyanate (CuSCN).17 Compared with organic materials, inorganic ETL/HTL materials demonstrate superior environmental and chemical stability, and they can be manufactured at a much lower cost due to the ease of processing.
Among inorganic HTL materials, NiOx has often been considered the most ideal HTL candidate especially for p–i–n structured PSC devices, because of its deep conduction band (CB) edge and a work function (5 to 5.6 eV) that is compatible with perovskites, resulting in a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of >1.0 V.8 Various kinds of techniques can be used to fabricate NiOx films with different morphologies, including nanoparticles, compact films and mesoporous structures.8,11 Each of these NiOx structures has been successfully implemented as HTLs in PSC applications. Conventional techniques like spray/ultrasonic pyrolysis,15,18–22 magnetron sputtering,23,24 chemical bath deposition (CBD),25 pulsed laser deposition (PLD),26 atomic layer deposition,27 and spin-coating16,28,29 are frequently employed for the preparation of compact NiOx layers. Among all of these options, the spray pyrolysis technique is considered the most practical technique for the low-cost and large-area deposition of NiOx because of its highly customizable setup and extremely high precision in yielding highly crystalline, large-area and uniform films with a compact morphology.15,18–22 More importantly, the thickness of the film can be precisely controlled with the precursor concentration and spray volume during spray deposition, thus ensuring consistent film quality. For instance, Chen et al. fabricated pristine NiO and Mg/Li-doped NiO layers using spray pyrolysis, and they used these NiO films in PSC devices. A PCE of 14.7% was obtained using the pure NiO film, whereas Mg/Li-doped NiO films achieved a PCE of ∼20%.18,19 Seo et al. reported a maximum PCE of 16.4% for pristine NiO compact layers fabricated via the atomic layer deposition technique.27 There are also many reports on the preparation of NiO HTLs using techniques like electrodeposition30 and vacuum deposition,31 with the device efficiency in the range of 15–17%. Apart from solar cell applications, spray-deposited NiO films have also been successfully applied as HTLs in CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dot light emitting devices (PeLEDs) to achieve high performance and stability.32
Despite the relatively greater performance of metal-doped NiO films compared with the pristine (undoped) NiO, there are some device stability and reproducibility complications arising from the use of metal dopants. It is commonly acknowledged that metal dopants are electrically active and migrate easily to the interfacial boundaries under an electrical bias. This inevitably leads to rapid performance degradation. Moreover, the concentration of dopants needs to be precisely controlled to avoid detrimental effects on the film quality and crystallinity. Ensuring dopant uniformity is even more challenging in the large-scale deposition of NiO films.
In this work, we demonstrate the large-area deposition of a NiO compact film (up to 62.5 cm2) on an ITO substrate using a low-cost, self-customized spray pyrolysis technique and its implementation in triple-cation perovskite solar cells. A green alcoholic solvent and nickel acetylacetonate precursor were used to fabricate NiO films using a layer-by-layer approach. The compact, pin-hole free, nanostructured morphology enables the NiO HTL to establish good contact with the perovskite layer, thereby facilitating the extraction of charge carriers from the perovskite. The best PSC was based on a spray-deposited NiO film, achieving a PCE of ∼17.3% under simulated one-sun illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency obtained for a spray deposited, dopant-free NiO-triple-cation PSC system. Furthermore, the NiO-based PSCs also showed tremendously higher environmental stability under harsh conditions than PEDOT:PSS based PSCs. The PCE of PEDOT:PSS based devices decreased completely after 35 h of aging, whereas the NiO based devices maintained nearly 90% of their initial PCE with similar aging durations. On top of this, we also demonstrated the immense potential of spray-deposited NiO films with high uniformity in the scalable fabrication of PSCs. A NiO based large-area PSC, with an aperture area of 1.04 cm2, achieved a PCE of ∼12.23%. This is one of the best results obtained to date for large-area PSCs based on spray-deposited pristine NiO HTLs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
All of the materials were used as received, including nickel acetylacetonate (95%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.8% and 98.8%), ethyl acetate (95.5%), hexane (99.5%), and chlorobenzene (99.9%), from Sigma Aldrich. Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%), lead bromide (PbBr2, >98%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.99%), and PC60BM were purchased from TCI Chemicals. Formamidinium iodide (FAI) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were purchased from GreatCell Solar. Methylammonium chloride (MACl) and ethanol (99.9%) were purchased from Merck. ZnO nanoparticles (2.5 w% in 2-propanol) were purchased from Nano Clean Tech.
2.2 Spray deposition of NiO layers
The NiO films were fabricated using the bottom-up spray pyrolysis technique. In this work, a homemade spray pyrolysis setup was used, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The spray setup consisted of a Clone 3D printer (model-S270), a high-temperature digital hot plate (Corning 500), a high-throughput spray nozzle (model-1/4J, US Spraying Systems), an infusion syringe pump, and a N2 gas flow controller, similar to our previous work.33,34 The nozzle was assembled on the x–y translation head of the printer and was connected to N2 gas and solution flow tubes. The spray solution containing 15 mM nickel acetylacetonate in ethanol:DI water (90:10 v%) was pumped into the nozzle at a rate of 3.0 mL min−1 and was atomized by compressed N2 gas (1.5 kgf cm−2). The spray nozzle was scanned at a speed of 1400 mm min−1 in a pre-programmed zigzag pattern in the x- and y-directions with a 2 cm spacing at a height of 18 cm above the ITO or glass substrates maintained at 450 °C. NiO layers with varying thicknesses were fabricated by repeating the spray cycles 4, 6, 8 and 10 times, and the corresponding films were represented as NiO-4, NiO-6, NiO-8 and NiO-10, respectively. Large-area NiO films were fabricated utilizing the same procedure by adjusting the scan area. For large-area deposition, ten ITO substrates (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) were placed on a hotplate in two rows (five substrates in each row), and a NiO precursor solution was sprayed onto the substrates. After spraying for the desired number of spray cycles, the samples were left for a minimum of 30 min for postdeposition annealing. After cooling down to room temperature, the samples were transferred to a glove box after 30 s of UV-ozone treatment.

2.3 Perovskite solar cell fabrication
Patterned ITO substrates with a sheet resistance of ∼10 Ω sq−1 and dimensions of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm were used for the fabrication of PSC devices with a planar structure. The substrates were cleaned by sequentially sonicating in acetone and ethanol for 15 min each. Finally, the substrates were boiled in isopropanol for 5 min. The substrates were dried in a hot air oven at 120 °C for 1 h. After drying, the substrates were cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 15 min to remove the organic residues. After NiO deposition, the perovskite layer was fabricated by a spin coating process. The perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 530 mg of PbI2, 75 mg PbBr2, 189 mg of FAI, 4.5 mg of MACl and 18.5 mg of MABr in 1 mL of a solvent consisting of DMF (80 v%) and DMSO (20 v%). After completely dissolving the precursors, 40 μL of a CsI solution (1.5 M in DMSO) was added and stirred for at least 3 h at 60 °C. An ethyl acetate (EA):hexane (Hex) (7:3 v/v) mixed anti-solvent was prepared according to our previous work.35 For fabricating the perovskite layer, 60 μL of the perovskite precursor solution was dropped on top of the NiO coated substrates and was spun at 1200 rpm for 10 s in the first stage and at 3800 rpm for 35 s in the second stage. At the 10 s interval of the second stage of spinning, 100 μL of the EA:Hex anti-solvent was dripped onto the spinning substrate. The perovskite layer was annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in air (RH ∼30%) and was then removed from the hot plate and cooled down to room temperature. Next, the PCBM solution in chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) was spin coated at 4500 rpm for 40 s, followed by ZnO deposition at 4500 rpm for 40 s in a N2 glove box. The films were annealed at 80 °C for 10 min. Finally, the PSCs were completed by the thermal evaporation of a 100 nm thick Ag contact with a shadow mask to yield an active area of 0.25 cm2. A shadow mask of 1 × 1.5 cm2 was used for large-area devices. For space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements, hole-only NiO-PSC devices with a device architecture of ITO/NiO/perovskite/Ag were fabricated. A total of four SCLC devices were studied, namely, NiO-4, NiO-6, NiO-8 and NiO-10 devices. The preparation routes to NiO and perovskite films were the same as mentioned before; however, the thickness of the Ag contact was increased to ∼150 nm for better ohmic contact.
2.4 Device characterization
The crystal phase and structural properties of spray-deposited NiO films and perovskite films were characterized with an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) using CuKα radiation. The surface morphological and topographical characterization was performed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) and an atomic force microscope (AFM, Park Systems NX10), respectively. The TEM and HRTEM images of NiO films were obtained using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (JEM-2010, JEOL). The sample was prepared by scratching the film and dispersing it in an ethanol solvent by ultra-sonication. The solution was then drop-cast on carbon coated copper mesh. The chemical analysis and work function analysis of NiO films were performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), respectively. These measurements were performed using a multiLab 2000 (THERMO VG SCIENCE) system equipped with monochromatized MgKα radiation at an energy of 1253.6 eV for XPS and 21.2 eV for UPS. A PerkinElmer Lambda 850 system was used to measure the optical absorbance or transmittance of films deposited on the ITO substrate, and a Horiba FluoroMax-4 system was used for steady-state photoluminescence. The current density–voltage characteristics of PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter and Oriel Sol1A solar simulator (Newport Inc.) under 100 mW cm−1 illumination and a standard air mass of 1.5 G. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.096 cm2 was used to define the active area. Masks with different desired active areas (0.07, 0.96, 0.52 and 1.04 cm2) were used for large-area devices. The SCLC measurements were performed under dark conditions at room temperature. The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated using a standard NREL reference solar cell. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices were measured using an Oriel quantum efficiency system (IQE-200). The time resolved photoluminescence characteristics were studied using a homemade system consisting of a picosecond pulsed diode laser (PicoQuant, PDL-800D) with an excitation of 405 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural, morphological and optoelectronic properties of spray-deposited NiO films
The spray deposition technique demonstrated in this work employs a fast-spray approach and green solvent to fabricate NiO films via a layer-by-layer process on a large-area substrate. NiO films were spray deposited from a dilute solution of nickel acetylacetonate in a 95% alcohol solvent without any dopants or additives. The deposition parameters, including growth temperature, spraying rate, gas flow, and distance between the nozzle and substrates, have been systematically optimized to yield high quality NiO films. A total of ten substrates (with a combined area of >62.5 cm2) were horizontally placed in two rows on a hot plate (Fig. 1(a)) and were sprayed in a single-step. The spray cycles were varied from 4 to 10 cycles to yield NiO films with different thicknesses and morphologies. Fig. 1(b) displays the XRD spectra of the spray-deposited NiO films before and after annealing. In both cases, there are two prominent peaks in the spectra: (i) a high intensity peak at a 2θ position of 37.2°, which reflects the (111) plane of the NiO crystal and (ii) a low intensity peak at a 2θ position of 79.8°, which corresponds to the (222) plane of the NiO crystal. The XRD spectra reveal that the NiO films exhibited a cubic phase (JCPDS no. 22-1189) with a dominant crystal orientation along the (111) plane26,36,37 before and after annealing. Interestingly, there is no evidence of a Ni2O3 phase in the XRD spectra, indicating the high phase purity of the spray-deposited NiO films. Using Scherrer's formula, t = 0.9λ/βcosθ, the crystallite sizes (t) of the NiO film before and after annealing were calculated to be ∼19.0 nm and ∼20.8 nm, respectively. This phenomenon implies that post-annealing (∼450 °C) treatment has a very limited effect on the grain growth of the NiO film. According to a previous report, the (111) oriented NiO films exhibited higher conductivity compared to the NiO films of other orientations.38 Therefore, the highly (111) oriented NiO films are highly desirable for optoelectronic applications. The surface morphologies of the spray deposited NiO films with different spray cycles, i.e. NiO-4, NiO-6, NiO-8 and NiO-10 films, were analyzed using FESEM characterization. The FESEM images of all the samples at low and high magnifications are presented in ESI Fig. S1.† There are visible small cracks and island structures observed on the surfaces of the NiO-4 and NiO-6 films. However, the previously mentioned cracks and island structures are not observed in the NiO-8 film. Instead, the NiO-8 film had a compact morphology composed of interconnected nanoparticles/grains, as shown in Fig. 1(c). In the case of the NiO-10 sample, the NiO nanoparticles began to agglomerate due to the increase in film thickness. To accurately determine the thickness of the NiO layer obtained with different spray cycles, cross-sectional FESEM was performed, and the results are shown in Fig. S2.† Specifically, the thicknesses of NiO-4, NiO-6, NiO-8 and NiO-10 films were measured to be approximately 25 nm, 30 nm, 35 nm and 45 nm, respectively. The surface topography of the NiO-8 film was further characterized using AFM, and the relevant 2D AFM micrographs are presented in Fig. 1(d). It was found that the NiO-8 film has a root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of ∼7.2 nm. By comparison, the surface roughness of the spray deposited NiO-8 film is much better than that of compact NiO films prepared via PLD26 or sol–gel38 fabrication techniques.
Additionally, HRTEM characterization was conducted to study the structural and elemental properties of the NiO film. The low magnification TEM image in Fig. 1(e) reveals that the NiO film is composed of crystalline nanoparticles with an average particle size of ∼10 nm. The interplanar spacing between the lattice fringes of the NiO sample was measured to be ∼2.4 Å from the HRTEM image in Fig. 1(f). This value is in good agreement with the NiO (111) crystal plane. In the inset of Fig. 1(f), the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows multiple diffraction rings arising from the (111) and (222) crystal planes of NiO, revealing the polycrystalline nature of NiO. It should be noted that XRD measurements of NiO films on the ITO substrate showed a highly oriented (111) nanocrystalline structure.26
Furthermore, the surface chemical composition of the spray deposited NiO film was studied using XPS. The XPS survey spectrum of the NiO film is shown in Fig. S3†(a). Specifically, Fig. 2(a) and (b) present the narrow-scan spectra of the Ni 2p and O 1s core level, respectively. In the Ni 2p spectrum, there are two distinct peaks located at binding energies (BEs) of 853.9 eV and 855.9 eV that correspond to the Ni 2p and Ni 3p cations, respectively.18,39 The pronounced peak at a BE of 853.9 eV can be attributed to the Ni2+ vacancies,18,40 whereas the peak at a BE of 855.8 eV can be mainly associated with the core levels of Ni3+ cations arising from Ni2O3.24 It is noteworthy that the Ni3+ herein does not represent the presence of a Ni2O3 phase in the film. Instead, it is attributed to a structure that consists of Ni2+ ions with a positive charge (holes). The O 1s spectrum of NiO films was also obtained. For a more in-depth analysis, the O 1s core-level spectrum of NiO was further deconvoluted (Fig. 2(b)), and it consists of two distinctive peaks located at BEs of 529.5 eV and 531.4 eV. These peaks are generated due to the two different bond states of Ni, namely, Ni2+ and Ni3+. The intense peak at a BE of 529.5 eV corresponds to the O 1s core level of the O2 anions in the NiO phase.

The peak at a lower BE of 531.4 eV can be assigned to the O2 ions in Ni2O3 with an energy difference of ∼1.9 eV. A peak separation of 1.9 eV was observed between the Ni2+ and Ni3+ cations associated with the splitting of the Ni 2p level. The integrated peak area (Fig. S3b†) for the Ni3+ cation is higher than that for the Ni2+ cations (Ni3+/Ni2+ area ratio = 2.15), implying that Ni2O3 is dominant in the film surface. The Ni2+ deficiency and oxygen-rich nature directly contribute to the p-type conductivity of the NiO film, thus making it an ideal HTL material for PSC applications.
Next, the optical properties of the NiO films prepared with different spray cycles were investigated using UV-visible spectroscopy. The transmission (T) spectra of the NiO-4, NiO-6, NiO-8 and NiO-10 thin films deposited on ITO substrates were recorded in the range of 300–850 nm (Fig. 2(c)). The NiO-4 sample showed a transmittance (T550 nm) of ∼88% at a wavelength of 550 nm. As the number of spray cycles increased, there was a corresponding red-shift in the transmittance edge. For the NiO-8 sample, T550 nm is ∼84%, which decreased to 81% for the NiO-10 sample. The red-shift in the transmittance spectra can be directly related to the reduced optical band-gap (Eg) of NiO (from 3.87 eV to 3.71 eV) because the film thickness increased from ∼25 to ∼45 nm. Additionally, the energy levels of NiO were examined via UPS analysis, as shown in Fig. 2(d) and the ESI.† The work function or Fermi level of the annealed NiO films was approximately −4.50 eV, and the position of the valence band (EVB) energy level was found to be at −4.86 eV. Conduction band (ECB) edge values were obtained by adding the optical band gaps (Eg = 3.71 eV) to EVB, leading to a value of −1.15 eV.
3.2 Structural, morphological and optoelectronic properties of perovskite films

Fig. 3(a) presents the XRD spectrum of a perovskite film fabricated on top of the NiO HTL using an EA:Hex mixed antisolvent. The perovskite film exhibited a typical perovskite peak at 2θ = 14.10°, corresponding to the (110) plane, with several other peaks at 2θ = 19.98°, 24.5°, 28.36°, 31.74°, 35.44°, 40.55°, and 43.07° that can be indexed to the (112), (211), (220), (213), (024), (400) and (330) crystal planes, respectively, confirming the tetragonal α-FAPbI3 black phase of the perovskite film.35 The perovskite film also exhibited an additional peak at 2θ = 12.70°, which corresponds to the (001) plane of PbI2 crystal grains. This finding suggests that there is a small amount of unreacted PbI2 (yellow phase) in the perovskite film, which did not convert into perovskite. This excess PbI2 is believed to be beneficial for the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film.33,41 The surface morphology of the perovskite film that was spin-coated on top of the NiO film was investigated using FESEM. The perovskite film consists of grains with an average grain size of ∼340 nm (Fig. 3(b)). There are no pinholes or cracks observed on the film surface, indicating the successful formation of a high-quality perovskite film (Fig. S4a†). A high-quality NiO layer helps the growth of a perovskite layer with larger grains and fewer grain boundaries.42 The NiO layer results in high crystallinity of the perovskite film by providing secondary nucleation sites to actuate the growth of perovskite crystals, which then leads to enhanced optoelectronic properties. AFM measurements were conducted on NiO-8/perovskite samples to further investigate the effect of NiO on the surface topography of the perovskite film. The designated scanning area for the measurement was randomly selected from the as-prepared perovskite film (film area of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2). The AFM micrographs in Fig. 3(c) indicate that the perovskite film is highly compact with no visible pinholes or voids, which is consistent with the previous FESEM measurements. The RMS surface roughness of the perovskite film was measured to be ∼37 nm. The cross-sectional FESEM image in Fig. 3(d) illustrates the vertically stacked architecture of a PSC device. Apparently, the NiO HTL underlayer has a thickness of ∼35 nm, and it is completely covered by the dense perovskite layer. The thicknesses of the perovskite layer, PCBM and ZnO layer were found to be ∼690 nm, ∼70 nm and ∼80 nm, respectively.

In terms of optical properties, the perovskite film exhibited strong optical absorption for light energies higher than ∼1.58 eV (780 nm), and the absorbance increased slightly after ETL (PCBM and ZnO) deposition (Fig. S4b†). Fig. 3(e) presents the steady-state PL spectra of perovskite films with different configurations. The pristine perovskite film on the ITO substrate exhibited a broad, intense PL emission with a peak wavelength of ∼790 nm. Interestingly, the intensity of the PL emission was quenched significantly in the presence of the NiO HTL underlayer. The observed PL quenching is a direct manifestation of the efficient hole extraction and transfer from the perovskite layer to the NiO layer. The intensity of the PL emission was further quenched following the deposition of the PCBM/ZnO bilayer ETL on top of the perovskite layer, which is mainly responsible for the extraction/transfer of electrons from the perovskite. These results are further supported by the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement results in Fig. 3(f). The TRPL decay parameters were obtained by fitting the decay profile data using a bi-exponential decay function. Based on eqn S1 and S2,† the calculated fluorescence decay lifetime 〈τavg〉 of the NiO/perovskite sample was ∼9.73 ns, which is much faster than that of the pristine perovskite sample (∼14.85 ns). Similarly, the NiO/perovskite/PCBM/ZnO sample exhibited an even faster PL decay lifetime of ∼7.87 ns. The detailed TRPL parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The reduced τavg of the NiO/perovskite and NiO/perovskite/PCBM/ZnO samples evidences an improved gradient for cascade charge transfer across the HTL/perovskite and perovskite/ETL interfaces in the samples. Both the steady-state PL and TRPL measurement results coherently demonstrate the crucial roles of the NiO HTL and PCBM/ZnO bilayer ETL in ensuring efficient charge extraction and transport in the NiO-based PSCs.
3.3 Integration of the spray deposited NiO layer in triple-cation perovskite solar cells
The spray deposited NiO films (with different spray cycles) were used as the HTL in PSC devices. Most of the preceding studies concerning spray deposited NiO layers concentrated on optoelectronic compatibility with the MAPbI3 system, as presented in Table S2.† In this work, we focus primarily on the use of large-area spray deposited NiO layers for inverted, planar triple-cation PSCs with a perovskite composition of Cs4(MA0.17FA0.83)96Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3. The detailed energy level band diagram and device architecture of the PSC are shown in Fig. 4(a) and the inset of Fig. 4(b), respectively. A small offset in the energy level alignment (Fig. 4(a)) between the VB of the NiO HTL and the HOMO of perovskite and the LUMO of perovskite and the LUMO of PCBM/ZnO is crucial for efficient charge extraction, which primarily determines the device performance of PSCs. Apart from the energy band alignment, the performance of PSCs is also highly dependent on the thickness of the NiO layer. The thickness of the NiO layer is, in turn, dictated by the number of spray cycles used during spray deposition. The J–V characteristics of the PSC devices based on NiO HTLs prepared using different numbers of spray cycles are shown in Fig. 4(b), and the detailed device parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The device based on the NiO-4 HTL (with a thickness of ∼25 nm) showed a PCE of ∼14.14%. As the number of spray cycles increased to 8, there were tremendous improvements in the Voc, Jsc and FF values of the PSC devices, resulting in a PCE as high as ∼17.23% for the NiO-8 device. The observed improvements in all four photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE) signify the improved charge extraction and decreased charge recombination in the PSC devices. The remarkable improvements in Voc indicate that the back flow of holes from NiO to the perovskite layer or recombination of holes at the NiO/perovskite interface was effectively suppressed. On the other hand, the enhancement in Jsc can be attributed to the optimum thickness and compact morphology of the NiO layer, which in turn improve the charge extraction at the NiO/HTL interface. The NiO-8-based PSC showed the highest efficiency among all the devices. It is clear from the FESEM images in Fig. S1† that the NiO-8 film possesses a highly uniform film surface without any pinholes, cracks or island structures. Pinholes and cracks are responsible for the high leakage current that often leads to inferior device performance.26 Therefore, the particularly good optoelectronic performance of NiO-8 films is attributed to their surface morphology.
Nevertheless, a further increase in the thickness of NiO up to ∼45 nm (as in the case of the NiO-10 film) dramatically reduced the PCE of the devices from 17.23% to 14.48% due to significant reductions in Voc and Jsc. The reduction in Jsc can be correlated with the reduction in optical transmittance of the NiO-10 film (Fig. 2(c)), whereas the reduction in Voc may be caused by the poor surface morphology of NiO-10 films compared to the NiO-8 films (Fig. S1†). The inferior device performance of the NiO-10 PSC may be due to the poor charge-extraction in the thick (∼45 nm) NiO film. The excessively thick NiO-10 HTL could hinder the transport of charge carriers, resulting in more bimolecular recombination and higher series resistance.43 The Jsc of the NiO-8 PSC (22.9 mA cm−2) obtained by J–V analysis matches well with the integrated current density (22.05 mA cm−2) derived from the EQE spectrum (Fig. 4(c)). To provide a better comparison, we also fabricated conventional PEDOT:PSS HTL-based PSCs as reference devices. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the NiO-based devices showed much better device performance compared to their PEDOT:PSS counterparts. In the reverse-scan direction, the PEDOT:PSS based PSC recorded a PCE of 11.57%, whereas the NiO-8 based PSC exhibited a much higher PCE of 17.23%. There was only negligible hysteresis in the J–V characteristics of both devices when measured in both the forward- and reverse-scan directions. Furthermore, the NiO-based devices showed negligible hysteresis (hysteresis index HI ∼ 0.005) in the J–V characteristics when measured in the forward scan (FS) and reverse scan (RS).44 The device performance histogram (Fig. 4(e)) shows that the average PCE of 100 NiO-8 based devices is ∼16%. This finding suggests that the device performance of the spray deposited NiO-8 HTL is highly consistent and reproducible. Compared with the other spray-deposited undoped NiO films reported in the literature, the performance of the NiO layer prepared in this work is easily one of the highest, as shown in Fig. 4(f) and Table S2.† It is equally important to note that the fabrication of NiO and perovskite films in this work involves only the use of a green solvent (ethanol/DI water) and antisolvent (EA:Hex), respectively, instead of toxic solvents/antisolvents (i.e., acetonitrile for NiO fabrication and toluene, refer Table S2†). The green solvent/antisolvent approaches demonstrated herein are competitive for the scalable manufacturing of NiO and perovskite films.
The charge transport properties of the NiO-based PSC devices were further investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.11 To accurately determine the charge trap densities, hole-only PSC devices with a device architecture of ITO/NiO/perovskite/Ag were fabricated, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). The dark J–V characteristic curves of hole-only PSC devices with respect to the film thickness of the spray-coated NiO HTL are displayed in Fig. 5(b). Generally, the dark J–V curves of all the devices exhibited a linear current response at low bias voltage, suggesting a super-ohmic behavior. With increasing bias voltage, the current starts to increase nonlinearly, indicating that the trap filling process is initiated. From the SCLC plot, the trap density (Nt) and the trap-filled limited voltage (VTFL), otherwise known as the kink point between the linear region and nonlinear region, can be calculated using the Mott–Gurney equation:11 (1)where, ε0, ε, e, and L are the permittivity of vacuum, relative dielectric constant (28.8 for perovskite), elementary charge, and perovskite film thickness, respectively. The VTFL values fitted for NiO-4, NiO-6, NiO-8 and NiO-10 based PSC devices were 0.48 V, 0.35 V, 0.25 V and 0.36 V, respectively. It is noteworthy that the trap density is directly proportional to the VTFL; therefore, a lower VTFL signifies a lower concentration of trap states. Correspondingly, the calculated Nt values of NiO-4, NiO-6, NiO-8 and NiO-10 based PSCs are 5.5 × 1015 cm−3, 3.68 × 1015 cm−3, 2.63 × 1015 cm−3 and 3.79 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. From this, it is evident that the NiO-8 based PSC exhibited the lowest Nt, which correlates well with its outstanding device performance. This finding is in good accordance with the trend of deep level trap states of NiO/perovskite samples revealed by PL and TRPL analysis.

3.4 Scaling up NiO films for PSC applications
The biggest advantage of the spray pyrolysis technique compared with other film deposition techniques is its ability to fabricate large-area, pinhole-free films of the finest quality and uniformity. In this work, we fabricated large-area NiO films up to a total area of 62.5 cm2 (12.5 cm × 5 cm in dimensions) and thoroughly inspected the device performance uniformity of the large-area NiO films. The large-area NiO-8 films were divided into 10 different substrates based on their positions (denoted from ‘A1–A5’ to ‘B1–B5’) on the hotplate, as schematically depicted in the inset of Fig. 6(a). All samples (A1–A5 and B1–B5) exhibited a total transmittance of >92% at 550 nm (Fig. S5†) with a small variation of 0.02% (Fig. 6(a)). The J–V characteristics of the PSC devices based on the NiO-8 films sprayed at different positions are shown in Fig. 6(b). Apparently, all 10 devices exhibited rather consistent performance, with an average PCE of 16.8 ± 0.4%. The detailed device parameters for each device can be found in Table S3.† Subsequently, the average PCEs of the PSCs based on NiO films obtained at different spray positions were statistically analyzed, and the PCE distributions are presented in the 3D-histogram plot in Fig. 6(c). The whisker plot of the device parameters in Fig. S6† also confirmed the highly reproducible PSC device performance based on the large-area deposition of the NiO HTL. Additionally, we progressively scaled up the active area of the NiO-8-based PSC devices from 0.07 cm2 to 1.04 cm2. The J–V curves of the PSCs with different active areas are presented in Fig. 6(d). It was found that an increase in the active area exerted greater influence on the FF of the PSC device instead of on the Voc and Jsc. To be specific, the device FF decreased from ∼71.8% to 51.2% when the device active area increased from 0.07 cm2 to 1.04 cm2. This is a commonly observed phenomenon when upscaling the device active area. The reduction of FF was attributed to an increase in Rs from 3.2 Ω cm2 to 14.56 Ω cm2 (Table S4†), indicating a less ideal ohmic contact between the NiO HTL and perovskite.45

(b) J–V characteristics of the large area NiO-8 based devices. (c) Variation in PCE with the substrate position. (d) J–V characteristics of devices with different active areas from 0.07 to 1.04 cm2. 
Besides the device performance, another equally important aspect of PSCs is the device stability, which is the determining factor for real-life applications and widespread use. It has been reported that the stability performance of the devices strongly depends on the deposition method of NiO films, quality of perovskite films and structure of ETLs. So far a lot of studies in the literature have reported the stability performance for NiOx-based PSCs under different environmental conditions, though the exact stability data varied among the studies in the literature, as summarized in Table S5 in the ESI.† The shelf-life of our PSC devices was measured over six months of aging (>4500 h) when stored in a N2 environment (in a N2 glovebox) at room temperature. Generally, the NiO based triple-cation PSCs showed very high stability, maintaining >87% of their original PCE over 4500 h of aging, as shown in Fig. 7(a), which is similar to that of the double cation perovskite based PSCs reported in the literature.20 The degradation gradient of the device was calculated from the slope of the curve in Fig. 7(a) and was about 0.00288 h−1. PSC devices were fully encapsulated using a patterned glass slide, UV-curable resin and moisture getter for the thermal/humidity endurance test.35 The encapsulated devices were stored in a thermos-hygrostat test chamber under fixed conditions (Temp. ∼85 °C; RH ∼85%). For this endurance test, the Ag contacts of the devices were replaced with more air-stable Au metal contacts. Fig. 7(b) presents the normalized PCE curves of NiO and PEDOT:PSS-based devices after they were subjected to the same testing conditions. Conventional PEDOT:PSS-based devices degraded much more rapidly than the NiO-based devices. The PCE of PEDOT:PSS-based devices decreased completely after 50 h of aging, whereas the NiO-based devices maintained nearly 98% of their initial PCE under similar aging conditions. The NiO-based devices retained >82% of their initial PCE after 200 h of the endurance test inside the test chamber in a harsh environment. Our findings show that the PSC devices based on the spray deposited NiO HTL exhibited superior performance and stability in comparison with the other NiO-PSCs reported in the literature, as summarized in Table S5.† The degradation mechanism of PSC devices under different conditions has been thoroughly elucidated in our previous studies.46,47 The stability test outcome in this work confirmed that the spray deposited NiO film is an ideal HTL material for the fabrication of triple-cation PSCs with high efficiency and stability.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have presented the large-area spray deposition of undoped NiO HTLs using a green solvent and showed their successful integration with the Cs-containing triple-cation planar perovskite solar cells. The influence of spray deposition cycles under the optimized fabrication conditions on the performance of PSC devices has been investigated. The spray deposited NiO-8 films with a thickness of ∼35 nm had a highly crystalline nature with the (111) orientation, a nanostructured morphology and a high uniformity with an optical transmittance of ∼93% ± 2% over the large-area substrates (>62 cm2), yielding a PSC device with a champion PCE of 17.23% and negligible hysteresis (HI ∼ 0.005). The large-area PSC devices (1.04 cm2), based on the NiO-8 HTL, also exhibited a PCE of 12.3%. The spray deposited NiO with a nanoparticle morphology and preferred orientation along the (111) plane is key to achieving such high performance PSC devices with high stability in a harsh environment (85 °C; 85% RH). The excellent photovoltaic performance of the undoped NiO-based PSCs is evidenced by the fast fluorescence decay and low trap density in the large grained perovskite films. We expect that the spray deposited nanostructured NiO films reported in this work will be competitive with high-performance perovskite solar cells with other compositions and are an ideal HTL candidate for large optoelectronic devices.
