    , Accepted 23rd November 2012First published on 23rd November 2012AbstractIn this paper, a novel solar cell device was fabricated based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) modified CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array as the photoanode. To prepare the photoanode, rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays were first grown directly on fluorine doped transparent conductive glass (FTO) by a simple hydrothermal method. Then the CdS nanoparticles and a thin layer of P3HT were deposited onto the surface of the TiO2 nanorods sequentially through an electrochemical route. It was demonstrated that the surface modification of the TiO2 nanorods with CdS nanoparticles and P3HT could enhance the light absorption in the visible region. An energy conversion efficiency up to 1.38% was obtained with the designed solar cell.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively studied because they are low cost compared to the existing silicon cells.1–5 Currently, the highest energy conversion efficiency around 12% has been achieved in DSSCs6. However, DSSCs still face several problems, such as dye degradation under full sun irradiation. As substitutes to the conventional DSSCs, semiconductor (SC) sensitized solar cells are receiving increasing attention,7 in which the sensitizing dyes are replaced with SCs, such as CdS,8–14 CdSe,15–17 CdTe,18 PbS,19–21 and InAs.22 It is demonstrated that SCs can function as efficient sensitizers and provide several advantages over the conventional dyes, such as high stability across a broad spectral range from the visible to mid-infrared, predominant optical properties and easy control in fabrication processes. Recently, Lee et al.23 reported a cascade structure of CdS@CdSe SC quantum dots as co-sensitizers in SC sensitized solar cells, in which the re-organization of energy levels between CdS and CdSe formed a stepwise structure of band-edge levels. The novel structure was advantageous to the electron injection and hole-recovery of CdS and CdSe QDs. The designed solar cell revealed the highest energy conversion efficiency of 4.22% in the SC sensitized solar cells.
In spite of the specific advantages, SC-sensitized solar cells still maintain several problems. For example, they usually suffer from photocorrosion. Therefore, efficient charge separation and fast charge transport in semiconductor nanostructures are the major challenges.24 One-dimensional (1D) titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotube or nanorod array can offer direct electrical pathways for photogenerated electrons and increase the electron transport rate,25,26 but TiO2 can only absorb UV light because its wide band gap is about 3.0–3.2 eV (the band gap of anatase is about 3.2 eV and rutile is about 3.0 eV).27 In order to extend its absorption to the visible region, coupling TiO2 with a narrow band gap semiconductor material (such as CdS,28 CdSe,15 PbS19) has been investigated. In addition, as an excellent hole conductor material, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) possesses good hole accepting ability29 and it can broaden the light absorption to the visible region.30 Thus, P3HT has been widely investigated in solar cells.29,31–34
Recently, Aydil et al.26 have reported a novel DSSC using an ordered single crystal rutile TiO2 nanorod array as the photoanode. Wang et al.35 have studied a quantum dot sensitized solar cell based on rutile TiO2 nanorod array as the photoelectrode. It was demonstrated that the oriented single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorod array on transparent conductive substrates would be a desirable nanostructure in preparing photoelectrochemical solar cells, whereas, the application of the single crystal rutile TiO2 nanorod array to SC-sensitized solar cell has rarely been studied. In this work, the ordered single crystal rutile TiO2 nanorod array was prepared and then coated with CdS nanoparticles and a layer of P3HT to fabricate a new multilayer nanostructure, the P3HT modified CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array, which was used as the photoanode for the SC-sensitized solar cells. An energy conversion efficiency up to 1.38% has been achieved with the designed solar cell under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 irradiance.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of TiO2 nanorod array
The TiO2 nanorod array was prepared using a hydrothermal method reported previously.26,35 60 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (hydrochloric acid agent without dilution) and 60 mL of deionized water were mixed together and stirred at ambient conditions for 5 min. And then 2 mL of titanium butoxide (Beijing Chemical Co.) was added to the mixture slowly. After being stirred for about 5 min, the mixture was placed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, in which a piece of cleaned FTO substrate (F:SnO2, 14 Ω/square) was placed at a certain angle against the wall of the Teflon liner with the conductive side facing down. Subsequently, the autoclave was put into an electric oven which was kept at 150 °C for 20 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the FTO substrate covered with the TiO2 nanorod array was taken out, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for several times, and then dried in ambient air at room temperature.
2.2. Preparation of CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod arrays
CdS nanoparticle film was deposited onto the TiO2 nanorods by an electrochemical method.33 In the electrochemical process, the FTO substrates covered with TiO2 nanorods were used as a working electrode, a platinum electrode as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The electrolyte solution was a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 CdCl2, 0.1 mol L−1 triethanolamine (TEA), and saturated elemental S. The electrodeposition was performed at an electrode potential of −1.00 V for different times (17, 21 and 25 min). The as-prepared samples were rinsed with absolute ethanol and deionized water, and then annealed at 400 °C for 1 h. According to the deposition time of CdS, the as-prepared CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod arrays were named as CdS(17 min)@TiO2, CdS(21 min)@TiO2 and CdS(25 min)@TiO2, respectively.
2.3. Preparation of P3HT modified CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array
A thin layer of P3HT was electrodeposited onto the as-prepared CdS@TiO2 nanorod array.33,36 Typically, the electrodeposition was carried out in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.01 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate and 0.1 mol L−1 3-hexylthiophene. The FTO substrate coated with CdS@TiO2 nanorods served as the working electrode, a platinum electrode as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. The applied potential was 2.0 V and the deposition time was 30 min. The as-deposited samples were rinsed with absolute ethanol and then annealed at 150 °C for 1 h.
2.4. Photovoltaic measurements and characterization
To prepare the SC-sensitized solar cells, CdS@TiO2 and P3HT modified CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod arrays were all sandwiched together with platinized FTO counter electrodes. The electrolyte (0.05 mol L−1 LiI, 0.05 mol L−1 I2, 0.6 mol L−1 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.5 mol L−1 4-terbutylpyridine in 3-mathoxyproprionitrile) was injected into the cells from the edges by capillarity. Photocurrent-voltage measurements of the as-prepared SC-sensitized solar cells were performed on a Keithley 4200 sourcemeter using simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an output power of 100 mW cm−2 produced by a solar simulator (Newport 69911). The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Keithley 2000 sourcemeter under the irradiation of a 150 W tungsten lamp with a 1/4 m monochromator (Spectral Product DK240).
The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S4800-I, 10.0 kV). TEM investigations were carried out on (JEOL JEMCX200) microscope. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) equipped on SEM was used to analyze the composition of the sample. The structures of the as-prepared samples were characterized by a Rigaku Dmax 2200 X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8-advance diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm). The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra were recorded on a Hitachi UV-vis NIR spectrophotometer (U-4100).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1A shows the SEM image of the TiO2 nanorod array. It can be seen that a uniform and dense nanorod array is formed vertical to the FTO substrate which might be a benefit for the fast electron transport. Fig. 1B displays the magnified SEM image of the TiO2 nanorod array, revealing that the nanorods have typical square morphology in their cross-sections. The appeared step edges on the surface of the nanorods might be the substrates for further growth of the nanorods.35Fig. 1C shows the cross-section view of the TiO2 nanorod array. It can be seen that the nanorods are well-aligned and their average length is about 3 μm. After electrodeposition for different time in the DMSO solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 CdCl2, 0.1 mol L−1 triethanolamine (TEA), and saturated elemental S, as shown in Fig. 1(D–G), the CdS nanoparticles can be successfully deposited onto the TiO2 nanorods. When prolonging the deposition time, the thickness of the CdS shell increases obviously. When the deposition time reaches 25 min, the TiO2 nanorod array (Fig. 1G) is nearly filled with CdS nanoparticles, which would confine the electrodeposition of P3HT later. From the magnified image, as shown in Fig. 1F, it can be seen that the CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanostructure has successfully formed. Fig. 1I shows the cross-section view of the CdS(25 min)@TiO2 nanorod array, it can be seen that the CdS nanoparticles were deposited on the TiO2 nanorods. Fig. 1H shows the SEM image of the P3HT modified CdS(21 min)@TiO2 nanorod array. It can be seen that a thin layer of P3HT was coated onto the surfaces of CdS(21 min)@TiO2 nanorod array to form the designed three-component shell-core structure.

Fig. 2a displays a typical TEM image of an individual CdS(21 min)@TiO2 nanorod. It reveals that the CdS nanoparticles are crystallized onto the surface of the TiO2 nanorod. From the inset image of Fig. 2a, it can be seen that the interface between TiO2 nanorod and CdS nanoparticles can be easily distinguished. The corresponding EDX spectrum is shown in Fig. 2b and the elemental analysis data are inserted. The results indicate that the as-prepared shell-core nanorods are composed of O, Ti, Cd and S. The molar ratio of Cd and S is about 1:1, in accordance with its stoichiometric proportion.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2 nanorod array and the CdS(21 min)@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array. Pattern a is indexed to a tetragonal rutile structure of TiO2. The strong (002) peak indicates that the nanorods are well crystallized and grow along the [001] direction with the growth axis parallel to the FTO substrate.35 The obtained TiO2 nanorod array is much better crystallized which can result in less defects in structure and decrease the electron-hole recombination. Compared to pattern a, pattern b reveals several additional diffraction peaks, which should be attributed to the cubic phase of CdS. The XRD peaks corresponding to the cubic CdS phase are broad, suggesting that the size of the deposited CdS crystallites on the surface of the TiO2 nanorods are very small.35

Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of the TiO2 nanorod array, CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod arrays and P3HT modified CdS(21 min)@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the TiO2 nanorod array can only absorb ultraviolet light with the wavelength less than 410 nm. For CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod arrays, the light absorption was extended to the visible light region. With the deposition time of CdS increasing, the optical absorption in the visible region is gradually enhanced due to the increased deposition amounts of the CdS nanoparticles, while the optical absorption in the UV region is sharply declined because the thicker CdS nanoparticle-layer would seriously counter the absorption of TiO2 in the UV region (as shown in Fig. 1D–G). For P3HT modified CdS(21 min)@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array, the deposition of P3HT results in a little red-shift and a further enhancement in optical absorption, especially at the wavelength range of 400–520 nm. It can be deduced that photovoltaic properties with our designed SC-sensitized solar cell based on P3HT modified CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array could be improved by enhancing the optical absorption.

In order to investigate the influence of CdS deposition time on photovoltaic performance of the CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod electrodes, J–V characteristics for SC-sensitized solar cells based on different CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod electrodes were measured. The results are displayed in Fig. 5 and Table 1. With the deposition time increasing, the energy conversion efficiency (η) of the measured SC-sensitized solar cells first increases and then decreases. The optimized photovoltaic performance is obtained from Device B (based on CdS(21 min)@TiO2 shell-core nanorod electrode), with a Voc of 0.666V, a Jsc of 3.326 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.444, and a η of 0.98%. For Device A (based on CdS(17 min)@TiO2 shell-core nanorod electrode), the poor photovoltaic property could be attributed to its thinner CdS nanoparticle-layer. For Device C (based on CdS(25 min)@TiO2 shell-core nanorod electrode), the CdS nanoparticle-layer became much thicker, which could increase the recombination chance of photogenerated carriers and then lead to poor photovoltaic properties.

To improve the photovoltaic performance of the optimal solar cell based on the Device B, a layer of P3HT was electrodeposited onto the CdS(21 min)@TiO2 nanorod array to prepare the P3HT modified CdS(21 min)@TiO2 electrode (named as “Device D”). Modified with P3HT, Device D reveals an enhanced photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 0.726 V, a Jsc of 4.303 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.443, and a η of 1.38%. Compared to the solar cell reported by Lee et al.23 our designed solar cell reveals a relatively lower efficiency. This should be attributed to the much lower Jsc in our solar cell, which is only a quarter to that of the solar cell reported by Lee et al. Compared to Device B, Device D exhibits an increase of 41% in the energy conversion efficiency. This result could be explained as follows. First, the deposition of P3HT can enhance the optical absorption in the visible regions (as shown in Fig. 4). Second, as an excellent hole-transport material, P3HT can efficiently transfer the photogenerated holes to the redox couples and result in a higher photocurrent. Besides, the P3HT modified CdS(21 min)@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array can form an interface between the n-type CdS and p-type P3HT, where a p–n heterojunction may be formed,33 to improve the charge separation efficiency. Device D presents a preferable energy conversion efficiency. This could be attributed to the high array density and the good crystallinity for the prepared rutile TiO2 nanorod array, which is favorable in facilitating the efficient electron transport and decreasing the charge recombination.

Fig. 6 shows the monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the SC-sensitized solar cells fabricated with the electrodes of TiO2 nanorod array electrode (Fig. 6a), CdS(21 min)@TiO2 (Fig. 6b) and P3HT@CdS(21 min)@TiO2 (Fig. 6c) shell-core nanorod array electrodes, respectively. Compared with the TiO2 nanorods electrode, CdS@TiO2 core-shell nanorods electrode exhibits a sharp increase of the IPCE in the visible region. But in UV region the IPCE of the CdS@TiO2 electrode is sharply declined because the thicker CdS nanoparticle-layer would seriously counter the absorption of TiO2 in the UV region (as shown in Fig. 6b). After the deposition of the P3HT layer, the IPCE of the P3HT@CdS@TiO2 photoanode reveals a further enhancement. These results indicate that the deposition of the CdS nanoparticles and the P3HT layer can effectively accelerate the charge transport in the designed nanostructure.

To better understand the operation mechanism of the designed SC-sensitized solar cell based on the P3HT modified CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod electrode, in Fig. 7, we depicted the charge-transfer processes among TiO2, CdS, and P3HT after being excited by light. In such a configuration, the visible light is absorbed by CdS and P3HT and the excited electron–hole pairs are generated. Then, benefited from the p–n heterojunction probably formed at the interface between n-type CdS and p-type P3HT, the photogenerated carriers in CdS and P3HT are effectively separated. Subsequently, driven by the favorable energetic arrangement, the separated electrons are efficiently transferred from the CdS shells to the TiO2 core and then quickly transferred to the FTO substrate along the direct path of the TiO2 nanorods. Meanwhile, the separated holes are transferred from CdS layers to P3HT layers and scavenged by I−/I3− couple in the electrolyte. I−/I3− couple is good hole transferring material. According to the above discussion, CdS can serve as not only the photosensitizer but also the electronic mediator, and P3HT act as both hole conductor and light absorber, which significantly improves the photocurrent and the overall conversion efficiency for the designed SC-sensitized solar cells based on the P3HT modified CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array.

4. Conclusions
A P3HT modified CdS@TiO2 shell-core nanorod array electrode, in which the TiO2 was rutile, was fabricated and used as the photoanode in a SC-sensitized solar cell. The 1D three-component shell-core ordered nanoarray structure was formed by electrodepositing CdS nanoparticles and a thin P3HT layer onto the rutile TiO2 nanorods, which enhanced the optical absorption in the visible region and resulted in the increasing energy conversion efficiency. The interface between CdS and P3HT existing in the structure can improve the charge separation and transportation. An energy conversion efficiency up to 1.38% was obtained with the designed nanostructure based on the P3HT modified CdS(21 min)@TiO2 nanorod array.
