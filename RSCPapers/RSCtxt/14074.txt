    , Accepted 12th June 2020First published on 12th June 2020AbstractPhotobiological hydrogen generation is among the most promising routes for the mass production of hydrogen energy. However, the cost and sustainability of photobiological methods largely hamper their large-scale commercial production. Here, we design an anaerobic environment with a constant near-neutral pH for the sustainable induction of green algae flocculation by engineering a robust chemoenzymatic cascade system consisting of glucose, glucose oxidase, catalase, and magnesium hydroxide. We found that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii could stably produce hydrogen in this engineered photobiological system for nearly a month, with an average rate of 0.44 μmol H2 h−1 (mg chlorophyll)−1. This study thus opens a new avenue to photobiological hydrogen production at industrial scales for promising “liquid sunshine” applications.

Broader context
Hydrogen (H2) fuel is among the most promising substitutes of fossil fuels. Photobiological H2 production that converts solar energy into H2 energy with microorganisms is an ideal method for mass H2 production with low to net-zero carbon emissions. In particular, green algae-based systems have long-term potential for economical H2 production with low environmental impact. However, it remains challenging to construct a stable and effective anaerobic environment for activating green algae for H2 generation. Up to now, H2 photoproduction in green algae is difficult to sustain for a long period of time, while maintaining a high conversion efficiency of sunlight simultaneously. This article demonstrates a conceptually new strategy for long-term green algae-based photobiological H2 production with high-efficiency for up to ∼1 month by engineering a robust chemoenzymatic cascade (CEC) system consisting of glucose, glucose oxidase, catalase, and magnesium hydroxide. The CEC strategy enables the long-term maintenance of an appropriate anaerobic environment without damaging alga cell activity or reducing chlorophyll content, thus remarkably increasing the H2 production time and overall H2 production yield. This robust strategy provides a promising large-scale H2 production approach for liquid sunshine applications.

As a highly desirable substitute for fossil fuels, hydrogen (H2) is a superb carrier for future energy with the only byproduct of water.1,2 Commercial H2 production is mainly derived from natural gas by steam methane reformation, which is neither renewable nor carbon-neutral.3 More recently, photobiological H2 production has attracted considerable interest since it uses sunlight in combination with a regenerative biocatalyst to photolyze water for H2 production.4 However, it remains a great challenge to maintain long-term photobiological H2 production with high efficiency and low cost.5
Green algae are widely distributed and low-maintenance photoautotrophic organisms that have incredible ability in utilizing sunlight,6 which express [FeFe]-hydrogenases (H2ase) for H2 production.7 They hold great promise as whole-cell biocatalysts for industrial scale photobiological H2 production.8,9 Nevertheless, the photosynthesis process of green algae generates oxygen (O2),10 an inhibitor of [FeFe]-hydrogenases, which intrinsically inhibits H2 production.11 Hence, it is crucial to create an anaerobic environment to sustain the activity of [FeFe]-hydrogenase for H2 production. One potential approach is to inhibit the activity of photosystem II (PSII),8,12 which nevertheless often results in low light conversion efficiency and negative impact on the green algae growth.8,13 Alternatively, in situ generated O2 scavengers have been employed to consume O2,14–19 which brings about anaerobic microenvironments for H2 production lasting over a week.19
Here, we develop a simple and robust green algae-based H2 production system with a designed chemoenzymatic cascade (CEC). A CEC consisting of a series of consecutive enzymatic and chemical reactions, catalytic or non-catalytic, in a one-pot system has been proposed to be a powerful tool for organic synthesis.20,21 In our CEC design, we combined multiple functions including O2 consumption, pH maintenance, and cell aggregation induction to activate H2ase in a local anaerobic environment and to maintain the green algae vitality. We demonstrated that this system enables long-term H2 production with high-efficiency.
The working principle of our system is illustrated in Fig. 1. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) is a well-studied biological model organism with wide distribution worldwide. Under normal circumstances, the H2ase in this species is inactive and does not generate H2. To construct an appropriate anaerobic environment, we employed a CEC system containing four components: two enzymes, glucose oxidase (GOx) and catalase (CAT), glucose and one inorganic chemical Mg(OH)2. The O2 generated in the photosynthesis process is expected to react with glucose with the help of GOx and CAT that work as O2 scavengers. The intermediate gluconic acid may cause acidic pH and suppress the viability of C. reinhardtii. To maintain a near-neutral pH, the insoluble base Mg(OH)2 plays an important role in reacting with gluconic acid spontaneously through acid–base neutralization. In addition, Mg(OH)2 is also a flocculant for green algae aggregation, which is also beneficial to the anaerobic environment construction.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the CEC strategy for sustainable photobiological H2 production under appropriate anaerobic conditions with green algae. 
As a proof of concept, C. reinhardtii culture (OD750 = 0.25) was incubated with a predefined CEC system containing ca. 0.1 KU mL−1 of GOx, ca.10 KU mL−1 of CAT, 50 mM of glucose and 150 μmol of Mg(OH)2 in 8 mL gastight glass tubes. Considering that H2O2 is a cytotoxic substance,22 the amount of CAT is in large excess of GOx in order to remove the H2O2 produced from glucose oxidation as quickly as possible. The total volume of the mixture was 3 mL and the headspace of the tube was still filled with air. The tubes were sealed with rubber stoppers and cultured under the illumination of 6300 Lux. To qualitatively assess the H2 production, an insoluble H2 indicator tungsten (WO3) that is inert to any component of the CEC system was utilized.16,19 As shown in Fig. 2a, the C. reinhardtii culture in the freshly prepared sample was a yellow-green suspension and the indicator WO3 displayed its original colour of light yellow, indicating that the C. reinhardtii cells were uniformly dispersed in the culture and no H2 existed in the system. Interestingly, with the elongation of the incubation, the colour of WO3 dramatically changed to dark blue-green and the upper culture appeared to be much clear and nearly colourless (Fig. 2b). The WO3 colour change confirmed the generation of H2 in the system, while the green colour in the sediment and the change of the upper solution implied the flocculation of the C. reinhardtii cells. Notably, the H2 produced in a scale-up system with 30 mL of culture volume was able to drive a H2 fuel cell-powered small electric fan (Movie S1, ESI†).

To quantitatively monitor the H2 production, the H2 contents in the headspace of the gastight tubes were determined with gas chromatography (GC) (Fig. 2c). It was observed that less H2 was produced in the first several days; however, it increased remarkably from day 6. By day 10, the amount of H2 reached 19.41 μmol, ca. 300 and 100 times higher than that on day 2 and 4, respectively. Notably, a steady increase was found during the whole period of monitoring (up to 26 days), indicating the sustainable H2 production. By day 26, the measured amount of H2 was as high as 104.32 μmol. The total yield of H2 was 34.67 mmol H2 L−1 that exceeded the sulfur-deprived algae (6.62 mmol H2 L−1).23 The average rate of H2 production was calculated to be 0.44 μmol H2 h−1 (mg chlorophyll)−1, which was 2.22 times higher than the instantaneous biomass-to-fuel yield in nature [0.20 μmol H2 h−1 (mg chlorophyll)−1].24 In addition, the O2 contents were also determined using gas chromatography (Fig. S1, ESI†). It proved the construction of an anaerobic environment by the CEC system. On the contrary, with only glucose in the system the O2 contents remained at ca. 21% during the whole 26 days. We further characterized the green algae flocculation using an optical microscope (Fig. 2d). In accordance with the gas chromatography results, only slight flocculation occurred on day 2, while it began to be obvious from day 6. In particular, the floc size increased significantly with time (Fig. S2, ESI†). By day 26, the diameter of the floc was up to 1000 μm, resulting in sedimentation at the tube bottom. Since the cells in the outer floc shell may suppress the gas exchange between outside and inside, a big size of floc is considered to be beneficial for forming an anaerobic environment inside.16,17 Therefore, the CEC-induced flocculation contributes to maintaining an anaerobic environment for a long time.
Having established the CEC system, we then systematically studied the role of Mg(OH)2. First, the optimal amount of Mg(OH)2 in the chemoenzymatic cascade was explored. As shown in Fig. 3a, it is interesting that with 150 μmol of Mg(OH)2, the H2 production on day 14 was significantly higher than those of the other two groups (75 and 225 μmol). Considering that Mg(OH)2 works as a H+ consumer in the CEC system, the pH values were also determined (Fig. 3b). It was found that only in the system containing 150 μmol of Mg(OH)2, the pH value was near the reported optimal pH for H2 production with H2ase.25 Less and more Mg(OH)2 led to low and high pH, respectively, and both were believed to inhibit the H2ase activity. Second, several different insoluble metal hydroxides, such as Al(OH)3, Ca(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3, were used as substitutes for Mg(OH)2. From the results, it turned out that none of them could help the system produce detectable H2 (Fig. 3c), which was further supported by the pH characterizations (Fig. 3d). The pH maintenance ability is highly dependent on the ionization degree of insoluble base. Comparing their solubility product constants (Ksp),26 for Al(OH)3 (4.1 × 10−33) and Fe(OH)3 (1.6 × 10−37), they are much lower than that of Mg(OH)2 (9.1 × 10−11), indicating weak ionization and low reactivity with H+; on the contrary, Ca(OH)2 has a much higher Ksp value of 5.5 × 10−6, leading to a high pH. These results confirmed that an appropriate pH value is vital for H2 production by C. reinhardtii and only a suitable amount of Mg(OH)2 can maintain the system near the optimal pH for H2ase.

(e) Curves of H2 production and O2 content in the headspace of the culture systems with different additives (n = 3). (f–h) Optical microscope photographs of C. reinhardtii with glucose alone, Mg(OH)2 alone, and glucose together with Mg(OH)2. All tests are carried out on day 14. Scale bar: 100 μm. 
Next, the enzymes (GOx and CAT) were removed from the culture to assess this O2 scavenger and their synergistic effect with Mg(OH)2 on the H2 production. As expected, no detectable H2 was observed with only glucose or Mg(OH)2 even after 14 days incubation and the O2 contents maintained at high levels (Fig. 3e). When Mg(OH)2 was used together with glucose, we found that the H2 content increased and the O2 content decreased with time in the C. reinhardtii culture. By adding indicator WO3, a slight colour change caused by H2 could be observed (Fig. S3, ESI†). However, compared with the CEC system, this H2 production is negligible (0.19 μmol versus 55.20 μmol on day 14). Cell flocculation was further measured using an optical microscope. It was found that glucose alone did not cause any flocculation (Fig. 3f), and slight flocculation occurred in the presence of Mg(OH)2 (Fig. 3g: Mg(OH)2 alone, Fig. 3h: Mg(OH)2 together with glucose). Similar results were obtained from the control experiments with denatured enzymes (Fig. S4, ESI†). We found that the C. reinhardtii cultures failed to produce H2 using denatured enzymes combined with either glucose or Mg(OH)2. Since denatured glucose oxidase lost the ability to consume O2, the aerobic environment was harmful for the algal H2 production. We note that in the cultures with both glucose and Mg(OH)2, a small amount of H2 (1.20 μmol) production was also observed in the presence of denatured enzymes. A similar occurrence was found in the enzyme-free system, where slight flocculation could occur by Mg(OH)2 together with glucose. Based on the above results, the positive impact of the enzymes on the H2 production was strongly confirmed. It is reported that the O2 consumed by cellular respiration in the core cells inside a floc is greater than the O2 generated by photosynthesis.16,17 Therefore, the H2ase will be activated in the local appropriate anaerobic environment to generate H2. Mg(OH)2 is an often-used flocculant, but it usually requires alkaline conditions to effectively flocculate green algae.27 Here we prove that Mg(OH)2 also induces flocculation in near-neutral pH. In particular, with the help of an O2 scavenger – the enzymes, the flocculation significantly enhanced (Fig. 2d). The synergistic effect is a key feature of our CEC system. In addition, the observed slight H2 production in the presence of Mg(OH)2 and glucose is probably ascribed to the flocculation effect too. It is known that glucose facilitates cellular respiration.28 As a result, even in the absence of enzymes, O2 consumption can be enhanced slightly. Together with Mg(OH)2, the synergistic flocculation effect also occurs in this system and helps generate H2.
Furthermore, to shed light on the H2 production mechanism on the cellular basis, the chlorophyll content and cell viability were determined as well. Both of them are crucial for maintaining long-term photobiological H2 production.29–32 First, the chlorophyll content of the C. reinhardtii culture was quantitatively analysed (Fig. 4a). Obviously, in the designed CEC system the chlorophyll content was the highest. We also found a strong correlation between the chlorophyll content and the pH value (Fig. 4b). On day 6, the pH of the CEC system began to stabilize at around 6.8. Under this optimum pH, the chlorophyll content of the CEC system rose slowly in the whole period and reached 0.38 mg on day 26, which was higher than that of C. reinhardtii cultured under normal conditions (0.29 mg) (Fig. S5a, ESI†). On the contrary, the chlorophyll content of the cultures without Mg(OH)2 continued to decline because of their acidic pH. Typically, the enzymatic O2 scavenging reaction was able to decrease the pH to as low as 3.0. It should be noted that though Mg2+ ions have been reported to have a certain positive effect on chlorophyll content,31 MgCl2 only slightly increases the chlorophyll content in the presence of the enzymes, due to its ineffectiveness in maintaining a neutral pH. With only glucose in the culture, the acidic environment was probably caused by the change of metabolism pathway and the accumulation of certain acidic metabolites, which in turn limited the chlorophyll biosynthesis.33,34

(b) The pH value curves of C. reinhardtii with different additives (n = 3). (c) The cell viability curves of C. reinhardtii with different additives (n = 3). (d) The absorption spectra of C. reinhardtii with different additives on day 26 (n = 3). 
Next, the cell viability was assessed by MTS assay. MTS (methoxyphenyl tetrazolium salt) can be reduced by NADH generated from living algal cells into a soluble and coloured formazan product, with maximal absorbance at 490 nm. Therefore, the absorbance at 490 nm is directly proportional to the number of living algal cells in the culture system.35 In this way, the ratio of the absorbance of our samples to the absorbance of algal cells cultured under the normal conditions reflects the cell viability (Fig. 4c). High cell viability in the CEC system was revealed, while these values significantly reduced after removing Mg(OH)2. Due to the fact that glucose is able to promote cellular respiration in environments with a suitable pH 28, it is reasonable that a large amount of NADH can be generated from the CEC system containing metabolically active cells. With the continuous consumption of glucose, a slight decrease of the cell viability was observed later. However, in the control systems lacking Mg(OH)2, the cell viabilities were low because of the acidic pH conditions. In particular, for the green algae cultures with enzymes but no Mg(OH)2, the cell viability dropped to 20% on day 2, because the pH value was only about 3. The striking contrast again revealed the importance in maintaining a neutral pH by Mg(OH)2. Moreover, the PSII activities in different cultures were characterized by using UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4d). As expected, the culture with the CEC system exhibited the same absorption spectrum with C. reinhardtii cells cultured under the normal conditions (Fig. S5b, ESI†). All characteristic absorption peaks of PSII could be found in this sample (marked with black arrows shown in Fig. 4d). The omission of Mg(OH)2 caused an obvious shift of these peaks (marked with red arrows), indicating the damage of PSII and the death of C. reinhardtii cells in the acidic environment. In addition, the confocal fluorescence microscopy images and photographs of these samples further support this conclusion (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†).
Based on the success of the CEC strategy on C. reinhardtii, we further extended this strategy to other green algae to test its generality. Chlorella pyrenoidosa has been cultured since it is another model organism for algal H2 production (Fig. S8, ESI†). As expected, H2 production was found only in the CEC system, since the optimum pH value could be maintained. The assessments on chlorophyll content and cell viability illustrated the high cellular activity. In addition, flocculation was also observed. We note that compared to C. reinhardtii, the H2 production rate was much lower probably due to the intrinsic differences of organisms. Nevertheless, these results proved that our CEC strategy has a positive effect on the green algae-based H2 production system.
Conclusions
In summary, we have constructed a CEC system that can effectively consume O2 and maintain the near-neutral pH for C. reinhardtii. The components in CEC can also serve as flocculants to induce the significant flocculation of C. reinhardtii. We demonstrate that the synergistic effects of CEC provide an effectively anaerobic environment for efficient and long-term C. reinhardtii photobiological H2 production up to ∼1 month.
Compared with the conventional sulfur deprivation-based approaches, our strategy does not directly damage PSII and needs only ordinary medium for all tests, avoiding any time-consuming and laborious replacement steps. Moreover, different from the emerging strategies without sulfur deprivation, our system uses common wild-type green algae without any modification and enhances the H2 production amount, concentration and yield remarkably.
Reducing fossil fuels is a major concern worldwide. The efficient conversion of solar radiation into clean “liquid sunshine” is a key to humans’ future.36 In our CEC system, the use of GOx/CAT as an O2 scavenger have been well adopted at industry scales,37,38 and flocculation is a common method for harvesting microalgae at large scales.27 Therefore, due to the availability and low-cost of these materials for constructing CEC, our photobiological method provides a promising large-scale H2 production approach for liquid sunshine applications. In particular, by combining genetic engineering techniques, it is also possible to produce enzymes in situ and update our CEC strategy towards intelligent autonomous systems.

Broader context
Hydrogen (H2) fuel is among the most promising substitutes of fossil fuels. Photobiological H2 production that converts solar energy into H2 energy with microorganisms is an ideal method for mass H2 production with low to net-zero carbon emissions. In particular, green algae-based systems have long-term potential for economical H2 production with low environmental impact. However, it remains challenging to construct a stable and effective anaerobic environment for activating green algae for H2 generation. Up to now, H2 photoproduction in green algae is difficult to sustain for a long period of time, while maintaining a high conversion efficiency of sunlight simultaneously. This article demonstrates a conceptually new strategy for long-term green algae-based photobiological H2 production with high-efficiency for up to ∼1 month by engineering a robust chemoenzymatic cascade (CEC) system consisting of glucose, glucose oxidase, catalase, and magnesium hydroxide. The CEC strategy enables the long-term maintenance of an appropriate anaerobic environment without damaging alga cell activity or reducing chlorophyll content, thus remarkably increasing the H2 production time and overall H2 production yield. This robust strategy provides a promising large-scale H2 production approach for liquid sunshine applications.
