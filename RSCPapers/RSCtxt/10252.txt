An X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to analyze the structure and chemical composition of the material. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied to characterize the morphology of HF-TiO2. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis), valence band analysis and Mott–Schottky plots were used to elucidate the electronic band structure. The results show that the HF-TiO2 samples can positively shift the conduction band of TiO2, thus enlarging the driving force for efficient electron injection, reducing the interfacial losses from charge recombination and consequently facilitating charge transfer. The conversion efficiency of DSSCs with HF-TiO2 electrodes is improved from 6.5% to 7.9% and results in a 20% photocurrent enhancement. This work provides a comprehensive explanation of the electronic structure and electron behaviors of HF-TiO2 samples in DSSCs, like the mechanism of electron injection, transfer and recombination, and a promising strategy to explore high efficiency DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Increasing energy demands and speedy consumption of traditional energy have motivated considerable work on alternative renewable energy, including solar power. The dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has become increasingly attractive for numerous researchers due to its exciting and unexpected properties, including its long lifespan, environmental-friendly processing, inexpensive fabrication and relatively high efficiency.1–5 At present, many researchers have spared no effort to achieve a high photoelectric conversion efficiency, with the highest up to 13%.2 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most popular photoanode materials in DSSCs for years, because it could provide an interconnected pathway for rapid electron transport, an effective charge collection and a high surface area structure for dye adsorption.2,6 However, losses from inefficient excited-state electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles and current losses during the transport of injected electrons are inhibitory to the whole efficiencies.6,7 The photocurrent of DSSCs can be improved from three aspects: the light harvesting capacity, the transport of photoinjected electrons from the dye into the conduction band as well as the dynamics of the interfacial losses,6,8 in which improving the photocurrent through enlarging the driving force of electron injection to fine-tailor the conduction band of TiO2 is relative feasible strategy.
Due to large band gap values (3.2 eV for anatase and 3.0 eV for rutile),9 both crystal forms are photocatalytically active only under irradiation with UV light thus the photoconversion efficiency of TiO2 for photovoltaic performance is very low. As a result, the key parameters necessary to extend the responsive spectrum of TiO2 based photocatalysts to the visible and even near-infrared region is to optimize the bandgap of TiO2, which has drawn great attention of scientists around the world.9,10 In order to enhance the optical absorption of TiO2, numbers of papers were published on the subject to decrease the bandgap value of materials.11,12 Numerous efforts have been devoted on the introduction of nonmetal ions like C, N, F, and S, into the TiO2 lattice to modify the band gap values and improve the electron transport process.12–17 Among these methods, F ions modifications have been widely investigated because of truly enhanced visible light absorption and corresponding improved photocatalytic activity in certain degree. Furthermore, intrinsic defects like oxygen vacancies or hydrogen impurities are liable to increase the electrical conductivity of metal oxides and improve related photoelectrochemical properties.18–21 Hydrogenation has been recently demonstrated as a simple and efficient method to modify the electronic structure of TiO2 and introduce shallow donors into TiO2 nanomaterials. A lot of researchers have confirmed the positive effect of hydrogenation in enhancing the PEC performance.22–24 Chen et al. reported a black anatase TiO2 nanocrystal through hydrogenation method under high pressure, which can enhance the light absorption and photocatalytic activity significantly.22 Hoang et al. demonstrated the synergistic effect between Ti3+ and N on the light absorption and photocatalytic activity of TiO2.25 Wang reported the hydrogenation of N–F co-doped anatase TiO2 nanosheets at different temperatures which can optimize the visible-light driven photocatalytic activity.26 Although hydrogenation can lead to a reduced band gap enhancing the light absorption, not all photovoltaic performance is improved because the introduction of impurities created additional recombination center. Deep insights into the photoelectrochemical activity effects between F and H played on the TiO2 nanomaterials are still unclear. Based on these work, it is very necessary to systematically explore the band gap modification of HF-TiO2 nanoparticles.
In this work, we report the hydrogenation of F-TiO2 nanoparticles at certain mild condition to optimize the photoelectrochemical performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. HF-TiO2 was prepared by hydrogen thermal treatment under almost atmospheric pressure with mixed gas flow (low concentration of hydrogen atmosphere) at relative low temperature, which is different from the strict method reported by Chen et al.22 Modification of the bandgap structure is a key parameter in elements doping science to enhance the light absorption and photogenerated electron–hole pair separation efficiency,27 the modified bandgap structure was estimated through UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Mott–Schottky analyses. This work reveals that the photovoltaic performance between H2 and nonmetal atoms are improved after the hydrogen thermal treatment, resulting the modification of different bandgap structures. The introduction of hydrogen thermal treatment can improve the electron transfer process, inhibit most of the backward reactions in the standard dye sensitized solar cell system and then enhance the driving force by the light absorption ability thus retarding the regeneration. To the best of our knowledge, the application of HF-TiO2 nanomaterials in DSSCs is scarcely reported, either systematical photoelectrochemical properties in modified TiO2 based DSSC and the enhanced solar energy conversion efficiency have not been explored in detail. The DSSC devices with hydrogenated F-TiO2 based photoanodes are also characterized by dark current measurement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit voltage decay.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and reagents
All chemical reagents used in the experiments were analytical grade without further purification. Titanium isopropoxide (98%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Acetonitrile, hydrofluoric acid (analytically pure, 40%), I2, LiI, tert-butylpyridine, and lithium perchlorate were purchased from Tianli Chemical Co., Tianjin, China. FTO substrate (90% transmittance in the visible, 15 Ω per square, purchased from NSG, Japan) was used as received and cleaned by a standard procedure. The Ru complex dye used in DSSC is cis-bis-(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719) purchased from Solaronix Company, Switzerland.
2.2. Preparation of HF-TiO2 paste
Synthesis of HF-TiO2. The HF-TiO2 was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. 98% titanium isopropylate (4.2 mL) was added into a solution at 0–5 °C under stirring vigorously, containing 12 mL of DI-water, 1.2 g hydrofluoric acid, and 14 mL absolute ethanol. The obtained white milky slurry was kept stirring for 1 h at 0–5 °C temperature. When the dropping was finished, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave was maintained in an electric oven at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the white precipitate was separated via centrifugation and then washed thoroughly with deionized water and absolute ethanol for three times. Then the precipitate was vacuum-dried at 100 °C for 12 h, calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h, and cooled to room temperature.The obtained F-TiO2 was placed in the quartz boat and heated in tube furnace under a 300 sccm mixture gas flow of 10% H2 and 90% N2 for 30 min at 300 °C. The heating of the hydrogen thermal treatments was stepped at 1 °C min−1. The sample powders were maintained for stabilization in vacuum for 1 h to obtain HF-TiO2 nanopowders after the hydrogen thermal treatment. TiO2 (or modified TiO2) paste was prepared by mixing TiO2 (or modified TiO2) nanopowders, ethylcellulose (99.8%, Acros Organics), α-terpinol in a certain amount of absolute ethanol (wt% ratio: 1.68:0.45:7.87:30) with stirring and ultrasonic dispersing for 48 h.

2.3. The assembly of DSSCs
The fabrication of DSSCs is in accordance with the literatures28 and the details are as follows. TiO2 and modified TiO2 paste synthesized as described before were cast onto the FTO substrate by screen-printing method, and then the electrode was dried at 120 °C for 2 min. This procedure was repeated for six times and the electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in the air. After the after-treatment of 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution, a transparent TiO2 electrode with the thickness of ca. 10 μm was obtained. The prepared mesoporous TiO2 electrode was dye-coated by immersing into a 0.3 mM N719 dye solution in absolute ethanol for 12 h. The platinum counter electrode was obtained by depositing H2PtCl6 paste onto the FTO glass substrates and then calcined at 450 °C for 30 min. The redox electrolyte was a mixture of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile–propylene carbonate.
2.4. Solar cell characterization
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurement was analyzed with Cu-Kα radiation by Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray Diffraction instrument. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs were performed by Rili SU 8000HSD Series Hitachi New Generation Cold Field Emission SEM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded with ESCALAB-250 spectrometer (Thermo, America) applying an Al-Kα source under an ultra-high vacuum (3.5 × 10−7 Pa). UV-visible absorption spectra of F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 nanopowders were analyzed with a UV-2250 spectrophotometer of Japan Shimadzu model. Mott–Schottky analyses were performed by CHI660D electrochemical potentiostat at f = 200 Hz with a small amplitude of 10 mV using a three electrode cell with a platinum wire as counter electrode and a standard Ag/AgCl as reference electrode (0.01 M LiClO4, 0.1 M LiI and 1 mM I2 as supporting electrolyte). The photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) measurements were recorded by applying an external bias to the cell by CHI660D electrochemical potentiostat. The scan rate was 10 mV s−1 and delay time was 40 ms, respectively. An AAA Class 150W solar simulator was employed to investigate the photovoltaic properties, the simulator is SAN-EI ELECTRIC with model XES-40S2-CE from Japan. The AM 1.5 global sunlight intensity was calibrated by a Newport Oriel PV reference cell and meter (model 91150 V). Dye loading analyses were conducted by desorbing the dye molecules from the dye-anchored TiO2 films in 0.1 M NaOH solution in water and ethanol (1:1, v/v). The loading amount was calculated from the absorbance of the completely desorbed dye solutions from the dye-anchored films in the same NaOH solution, by the spectrophotometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were recorded using CHI660D electrochemical potentiostat in frequency ranging from 0.1 to 100 kHz in the dark. The open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements were recorded using CHI660D electrochemical potentiostat. The Incident Photon-to-Current Efficiency (IPCE) spectra were conducted by IPCE Kit equipment (model 2931-C, Newport, USA) a 1/4 m monochromator (model 74125 Oriel Cornerstone 260, Newport, USA), a 300 W xenon lamp (model 66902, Newport, USA), and the calibrated silicon detector (model 71675, Newport, USA).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of TiO2, F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples
Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the prepared TiO2 nanopowders before and after hydrogen thermal treatment. As shown in the figure, all the diffraction peaks of the samples are in agreement with the TiO2 anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272), indicating that there is no phase change of samples in nanocrystalline structure. The morphology of the F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples is analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Fig. 2 reveals the uniform sphere nanoparticles of samples. The sphere nanopowders are uniform with diameter of around 20 nm. No significant morphology changes after hydrogenation could be observed.

Fig. 3 shows the change of surface bonding of HF-TiO2 analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 3a, XPS survey spectra collected from F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 nanopowders treated at 300 °C are very similar. Fig. 3b shows the normalized Ti 2p core level high resolution XPS spectra of F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples. Both the samples show two similar features and the Ti 2p3/2 centered at 458.8 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks centered at 464.5 eV with a space of 5.7 eV, indicating the existence of Ti4+ which is consistent with the typical values of TiO2.15,29 None of additional shoulder peak situated at 457.0 eV indicates no occurrence of Ti3+ ions. Fig. 3c displays the XPS spectra of O 1s. The O 1s region can be fitted well by two peaks centered at 529.8 eV and 531.2 eV suggesting the similar oxygen environment, which corresponds to the lattice oxygen (OTi) and the oxygen in surface hydroxyl groups (OOH).15,30 After hydrogenation, the percentage of OOH increased due to more surface OH species resulting from the O and H interaction. The peak centered at 684.5 eV convinced the existence of F 1s (Fig. 3d), which should derive from the surface fluorine ions and the substitutional lattice fluorine ions.30–32

3.2. Photoelectrochemical performance of dye sensitized solar cells
The current density–voltage curves of DSSCs based on F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples were recorded under standard AM 1.5 global solar irradiation conditions. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs after hydrogenation are shown in Table 1 and each value was an average from at least five cells. The DSSCs based on HF-TiO2 show overall photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) as 7.9% and the DSSC based on F-TiO2 shows η as 6.5%, which is a pronounced 20% improvement in comparison with DSSCs based on F-TiO2. The short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) increases from 17.16 mA cm−2 to 19.31 mA cm−2, corresponding to a 13% enhancement. The DSSCs based on pure TiO2 samples were measured and the results are listed in Table 1. The result shows that after hydrogenation treatment the modified TiO2 sample based DSSCs can lead to an increasing conversion efficiency and the cause of the enhancement will be elaborated in the following discussion. The amount of dye-loading of photoanodes based on F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 nanoparticle were tested, as is shown in Table 1, there are no great change in the amount of dye-loading which can eliminate the dye adsorption effect on accurate conclusion between DSSCs based on HF-TiO2 treated under 300 °C and photoanodes based on F-TiO2.

Fig. 4 also shows the dark I–V curves of DSSCs based on F-TiO2 and the HF-TiO2 nanopowders with the applied bias from 0 to +0.80 V and the dark current counts on the recombination of injected electron with I3− in the electrolyte. The onset of the dark current for F-TiO2 nanopowders based DSSC occurs at a bias of about +0.50 V and then followed by a sharp increase of dark current with potential increasing. However, the onset potential is enhanced to about +0.55 V for HF-TiO2 nanopowders based DSSCs. The enhancement of the onset potential and the reduction of the dark current indicated that hydrogenation treatment successfully suppress the electron recombination with I3− in the electrolyte. The current leakage in DSSC can be reduced thus elevating the overall PCE, at the same time a decrease of the dark current resulted in an increase of Voc.
 Fig. 4  Current density–voltage curves of DSSCs based on F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 nanopowders under illumination and in the dark. 
The whole IPCE value for the DSSC with HF-TiO2 electrode increases obviously as is shown in Fig. 5. Based on previous analysis, this enhancement can be originated from the following aspect: the hydrogenation of F-TiO2 nanoparticles brought to enhanced light-harvesting efficiency and easy charge separation, retarded the recombination of injected electrons with I3− in electrolyte and prolonged the electrons' life time that could result in higher electron collection efficiency and thus improved the IPCE value. As shown in the IPCE spectra in Fig. 5, the maximum IPCE value for the F-TiO2 based DSSCs is 66.17% at 550 nm, but the HF-TiO2 based DSSCs has an IPCE value of 77.89% at the same range. The IPCE spectrum of the HF-TiO2 based DSSCs exhibit a whole upward shift during the wavelength from 400 nm to 700 nm. It means that the HF-TiO2 based DSSCs has a higher light-harvesting efficiency and quantum yield of charge injection in contrast with that of the F-TiO2 based DSSCs.16 Thus HF-TiO2 nanopowders as DSSC photoanode will facilitate light harvesting and electron injection, which may be a good material candidate for DSSCs because it enhances not only light harvesting but electron injection and charge collection.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been widely utilized to analyze the electron transport resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface for its significance on the efficiency of DSSCs.33,34 As shown in Fig. 6a, there are three semicircles located from left to right corresponding to high, middle and low frequency regions, which can be attributed to the electrochemical reaction at the Pt/electrolyte interface, the electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and charge transfer in the electrolyte. After the hydrogen thermal treatment, the radius of the semicircle situated in middle frequency regions decreases in the Nyquist plots, which means a decrease of the electron transfer impedance (Rct) and an increase of electron transfer rate. The lower transport resistance indicates that the HF-TiO2 provides a direct conduction path for the electrons injected from the sensitizing dye, thus leading to a decreased loss of the electrons at the HF-TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. This is favorable for rapid electron injection.

When tested the DSSCs in the dark, no electrons were injected from the dye into the TiO2 network. Electrons react with the redox electrolyte (I3−) and transfer through the interconnected TiO2 particles. Therefore, the transfer resistance under forward bias and in the dark is relevant to the recombination between the injected electron and the redox electrolyte (I3−).35,36 As is shown in Fig. 6b, the radius of the semicircle of HF-TiO2 based DSSC situated in middle frequency regions decrease compared with that of F-TiO2 based DSSC, leading to a better retard in the recombination process between the injected electron and the redox electrolyte. Also this decreased radius explains the dark current of F-TiO2 based DSSC is lower as is shown in Fig. 4 and compensates the decreased Voc caused by the lowered conduction band.
The electron transport time (τd) can be used to elucidate the enhanced photocurrent, which is the average time of the injected electron reaching FTO electrode. It could also be calculated from the Bode phase plots of the EIS spectra of different solar cells (Fig. 6c), there is a relationship: τd = 1/2πfmax can be used to calculate electron transport time. In this relationship, fmax is the maximum frequency of the middle frequency region in Bode phase plot.37 According to this equation, τd of the HF-TiO2 based DSSC is longer than that of the F-TiO2 based DSSC. The faster the electron transport time can lead to a higher photocurrent and indicate the retard of the recombination between the photo-injected electrons and I3− ions.
Furthermore, the interfacial recombination process between the photo-injected electrons and the redox species of different TiO2 nanopowders based DSSCs can be detected by the OCVD technique. OCVD technique display the decay of Voc after turning off the illumination, and only the electrons recombining are revealed since the test is carried out in the dark.34,38,39 As shown in Fig. 7a, the OCVD curves of F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 based DSSCs decay rapidly after turning off the illumination reflecting the decreased electron concentration due to the charge recombination. It is obvious that after 10 s under open circuit conditions, the Voc decays rapidly due to the internal trapping and de-trapping, and the Voc value of DSSCs based on F-TiO2 decays dramatically to close to 0 V after 60 s while the Voc value of DSSC based on HF-TiO2 decays tardily after 80 s. HF-TiO2 based DSSCs show a higher onset voltage compared with F-TiO2 based DSSCs. The OCVD curve of HF-TiO2 based DSSC shows a slower decay rate indicating the inhibiting effect on charge carrier recombination. The electron lifetime (τn) versus voltage curves are shown in Fig. 7b, according to the following equation:  electron lifetimes of DSSCs can be calculated in which kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and the temperature, respectively. The electron lifetime of HF-TiO2 based DSSCs is longer than F-TiO2 based DSSCs, indicating a much lower charge recombination rate from the internal trapping and de-trapping of HF-TiO2 based DSSCs compared with F-TiO2 based DSSCs.

3.3. Band gap study and mechanism explanation
In order to elucidate the mechanism of enhanced PCE and electron process, electronic structure should be detected. In this work, UV-vis spectra, valance band and Mott–Schottky analysis are employed to estimate the electronic structure of modified semiconductor. The UV-vis spectra of the F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 nanopowders are employed to study the light absorption ability and band edge values (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8, it can observed that the HF-TiO2 sample has a stronger UV absorption than that of the F-TiO2 sample. Furthermore, HF-TiO2 nanopowders can absorb more light in the wavelength from 380 to 600 nm compared with that of F-TiO2 and untreated TiO2 nanopowders, which mostly belongs to visible light. Band gap values can be calculated according to Tauc plot: (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg), a relationship between the absorption coefficient (α) near the absorption edge and the optical band gap (Eg).40 As shown in the inset figure of Fig. 8, hν is plotted versus (αhν)1/2, and the direct optical band gaps of samples could be estimated from the extrapolation of the linear portion of the plots. The band gap of HF-TiO2 is 3.18 eV, a little narrower than that of F-TiO2 (3.20 eV). The results show that the hydrogen thermal treatment can increase the absorption of HF-TiO2 samples in the visible light range as well as reduce the Eg, and the reduced Eg can be ascribed to the mid-gap electronic state. Hydrogenation can generate dangling bonds and disorder surface layer of the TiO2 samples, which is feasible to introduce mid-gap electronic states. The narrowed band gap is originated from the existence of mid-gap electronic states in samples according to our early study and former reports,41 and this mid-gap states may enhance the photovoltaic performance. The results confirm that the hydrogenation process could narrow the band gap of the semiconductor, enhance the light-absorption properties, and possibly improve PEC performance.
 Fig. 8  (a) UV-vis spectra of TiO2, F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples, inset figure is the band gap calculation by Tauc's plot. 
Additionally, the valence band spectra of the F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples were measured to investigate the electronic band structure of TiO2 after the hydrogen thermal treatment (Fig. 9). For the H-TiO2 nanoparticles reported in our early work, the relative low temperature has slight effect on the valance band values. Similarly, in this work, the valence band values of F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples showed little difference. By linear extrapolation of the peaks to the baselines the valence band maxima are estimated deriving a band edge position of ∼2.82 eV for F-TiO2 samples and ∼2.63 eV for HF-TiO2 samples below the Fermi energy.22 This is likely due to that the disorders and defects generate some localized states above the valence band edge and result in the blue shift of valance band. In fact, HF-TiO2 samples annealed at different temperatures in our early work exhibit almost the same valence band maximum, which supports hydrogen thermal treatment has a negligible effect on the valence band position at the TiO2 nanopowder surface.

Further insights into the influence of hydrogen treatment on the electronic properties of the F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples is conducted by electrochemical impedance measurements at a frequency of 0.2 kHz in the dark with 0.01 M LiClO4, 0.1 M LiI and 1 mM I2 as supporting electrolyte. F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples exhibit positive slopes in the Mott–Schottky plots indicating that all samples show same semiconductor type: n-type (Fig. 10). After hydrogen thermal treatment, the HF-TiO2 samples show smaller slopes in Mott–Schottky plot compared with that of F-TiO2 samples, indicating an increased donor densities. Donor densities can be calculated from the slopes of Mott–Schottky plots according to the equation: Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1, where Nd is the donor density, e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of TiO2 which is 170 according to literatures, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum and V is the applied bias at the samples.42 The carrier densities of the F-TiO2 and HF-TiO2 samples were calculated to be 1.12 × 1021 cm−3 for F-TiO2 nanopowders and 1.59 × 1021 cm−3 for HF-TiO2 nanopowders, respectively. The result shows that donor densities of HF-TiO2 nanopowders is a little bigger than that of F-TiO2 nanopowders. Through this qualitative comparison of the slopes from the Mott–Schottky plots, the enhanced donor density of HF-TiO2 samples after hydrogen thermal treatment leads to a significant improvement of charge transport as well as the electron transport between the semiconductor nanopowders and FTO substrate. The enhanced donor density can be the reason of the optimization in the photovoltaic performance.
 Fig. 10  Mott–Schottky plots collected in the dark for the F-TiO2 and the HF-TiO2 films. 
Moreover, the electronic structure modification especially the Ef location in order to confirm the shift of the TiO2 samples conduction band minimum can be analyzed through Mott–Schottky plots, which can give reasonable explanations to the increased photocurrent. As shown in Fig. 10, liner extrapolation of the plots to the baselines can be used to estimate Ef location of TiO2 samples. Ef is an effective way to evaluate the energetic edge position of the conduction band. The Ef value of the F-TiO2 film was 0.52 V (vs. SCE), whereas the Ef value of the HF-TiO2 films was around 0.50 V (vs. SCE). The Fermi level of TiO2 samples is shifted toward the conduction band according to liner extrapolation of the Mott–Schottky plots.42 This positive shift increases the energy gap between the LUMO of the dye and the conduction band of TiO2, which increase the driving force of injected electrons and then improves the electron injection efficiency. Consequently, the photocurrent increased after hydrogen thermal treatment. The increased degree of band bending at the TiO2 surface leads to the upward shift of the Fermi level facilitating the charge separation between the semiconductor and electrolyte. Besides, the positively shift of the TiO2 flat band after hydrogenation treatment suggests that the electron injection process was more energetically favourable. Hydrogenation can improve the electron transport and collection as well as restrain the recombination of photoinduced charge by providing a high conductive path and better interface contact. The enhanced charge separation and transportation are believed to be the major reasons for the observed IPCE enhancement in the UV region.
Based on the above analysis, the photoelectrochemical improvement in Jsc and η can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) a narrowed band gap of HF-TiO2 leads to an enhanced light absorbing response in the visible region. It corresponds to the higher light-harvesting efficiency and quantum yield of charge injection of HF-TiO2 based DSSCs compared with that of F-TiO2 based DSSCs; (2) for the modified HF-TiO2, the flat band was positively shifted after hydrogenation treatment. The electron injection process was more energetically favorable thus increasing the driving force during the electron transport process which improve the electron transport and collection as well as restrain the recombination of photoinduced charge; (3) the increased donor density of HF-TiO2 samples improve the electron transport process and improve the electron injection and transport for the new photoanode restrains the electrons recombining between the electrolyte and dye effectively and prolongs the lifetime of electrons.
According to the above results, hydrogen thermal treatment could downward-shift Fermi level, which leads to enhanced light absorption, increased donor density and narrowed band gap. Also, this downward shift of Fermi level is liable to reduce the TiO2 work function thus improving photoelectrochemical performance.43 However, the hydrogen thermal treatment leads to enhanced PCE in certain extent according to our early work.21 It can be concluded that there is a balanced point where appropriate oxygen vacancies make the electrons transport faster than TiO2 and bring the recombination and transportation into balance, which can make photoelectrochemical performance better. Besides, the introduced oxygen vacancy in HF-TiO2 by hydrogen thermal treatment will improve their conductivity and carrier mobility, which can boost most injected electrons transportation in HF-TiO2.
A possible working mechanism of the HF-TiO2 photoanode based DSSCs is proposed and shown in Fig. 11. The sensitizer N719 dye molecules under the illumination absorb the visible light and reach their excited state, by which electrons excited from the HOMO to the LUMO of the dye and photoelectrons will be injected from the LUMO of the dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. After hydrogen thermal treatment, HF-TiO2 nanoparticles absorb more visible light and remove holes from the photoanode and then inject them into the electrolyte efficiently. At the same time, less parts of injected electrons reverse back to the CB of TiO2 to HOMO of the dye before flowing into the external circuit. HF-TiO2 nanoparticles results in a restrained recombination of electrons–hole and efficient electron injection. Because after the hydrogenation treatment, more electrons can be accepted and injected into the TiO2 conduction band so that electrons and holes can be separated as effective charge carriers. Thus, hydrogen thermal treatment enhances the photoelectrochemical response of F-TiO2 nanoparticles and helps to enhance the whole efficiencies. The improvement affords an effective electron transfer in semiconductor as well as the interfaces and can remove the fast electron–hole recombination on TiO2 samples. In general, the introduction of hydrogen thermal treatment can improve the electron transfer process, inhibit most of the backward reactions in the standard dye sensitized solar cell system and then enhance the driving force by the light absorption ability thus retarding the regeneration from the two aspects. All the above modifications improve the whole photoelectrochemical performance of DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, novel HF-TiO2 nanopowders was synthesized through hydrogenation thermal treatment with mixed flow and applied as photoanode materials of DSSCs, it could strengthen the light harvesting, compensate the absorption in the visible spectrum, prolong the lifetime of photoelectron, suppress the charge recombination and prolong the electron lifetime. The performance of HF-TiO2 based DSSCs is dramatically improved compared with F-TiO2 based DSSCs. The further results show that HF-TiO2 samples can positively shift the conduction band of TiO2, thus enlarge the driving force for efficient electron injection, reduce the interfacial losses from the charge recombination and consequently facilitate the charge transfer. When hydrogenation thermal treatment was introduced, a short circuit current density of 19.31 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.73 V and a fill factor of 0.56 corresponding to an overall PCE of 7.9% under AM 1.5G solar irradiation were achieved, which is 20% higher than that of DSSCs with F-TiO2 (6.5%) under the same condition. The results of nanomaterial hydrogenation method are anticipated to arouse broad interest in further boosting the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells.
