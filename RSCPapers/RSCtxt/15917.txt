    , Accepted 18th April 2023First published on 19th April 2023AbstractHerein, we applied a rapid Joule heating method to fabricate MoNi4 nanoparticles anchored on MoOx nanorods (MoNi4/MoOx) for the electrocatalytic splitting of seawater. Compared to the traditional calcination method, the Joule heating method not only shortened the preparation time, but also modulated the chemical states of the reactive sites and further improved the electrocatalytic activity. As-prepared MoNi4/MoOx achieved overpotentials of 15 mV (@10 mA cm−2) and 227 mV (@1000 mA cm−2) in alkaline seawater electrolyte for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This composite also exhibited excellent chemical stability in 1000 h testing at a constant current density of 1 A cm−2. Moreover, the MoNi4/MoOx showed great performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrochemical reactor, which reduced the energy needed by 3.33 kW h to generate per cubic meter of H2 at a current density of 200 mA cm−2 relative to a commercial Ni foam system. Finally, a home-made solar power-assisted water splitting device was successfully constructed using MoNi4/MoOx//RuO2 electrodes and polymer solar cells (PSCs), achieving a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 11.28%.
Introduction
The ever-rising environmental pollution and energy-shortage crisis are attracting scientists' attention to the research into attractive renewable hydrogen energy (H2), due to its high energy density (∼130 MJ kg−1).1–3 Currently, the production of H2 by electrochemical seawater splitting has emerged as one of the most promising strategies.4–7 Over the past decade, commercial Pt/C has been regarded as the state-of-the-art hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst in alkaline water splitting. Unfortunately, its high cost and barely satisfactory elemental abundance hampers its large-scale implementation. To date, great efforts have been devoted to the exploration of non-precious metal-based electrocatalyst, which can be reasonably constructed using transition metals, such as the earth-abundant W, Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo, and these have consequently been at the forefront of research.8,9 However, their sluggish kinetics and high energetic barrier dramatically impede the HER activity of such electrocatalysts in seawater splitting. Meanwhile, due to the catalyst deactivation caused by the complexity of dissolved cations and insoluble precipitates, it is still a challenge to construct highly active and stable electrocatalysts for seawater splitting. Therefore, it remains imperative to devote more effort to exploring cost-effective, highly efficient, and robust electrocatalysts to expedite the seawater splitting process, so as to realize the large-scale production of H2.10
Notably, Mo-based compounds, including sulfides,11 phosphides,12 selenides,9 oxides,13 and carbides,14 have been investigated as promising candidates in the field of seawater electrolysis, which benefited from having an option for Pt-like d-bands electrical assembly, numerous accessible active sites, and excellent stability in harsh environments.15 Among these electrocatalysts, molybdenum oxide has attracted great attention due to its advantages of faster charge-carrier transportation and abundant active sits provided by Mo-edge and O-edge, albeit its inappropriate adsorption energy for hydrogen hamper its use as a competitive electrocatalyst.16 As reported, the adsorption energy of hydrogen could be optimized via a “d electron complementary effect”, wherein the combination of Mo species with Ni can play an important role in modulating the surface charge states, leading to ideal binding free energies with reactive intermediates.17–19 For instance, Feng and co-workers attempted to fabricate a MoNi4 alloy anchored on MoO2 cuboids via a calcination method at 500 °C for 2 h, which required an overpotential of 15 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER.20 Wang et al. fabricated a MoNi alloy supported on hollow MoO2 nanorods by a two-step annealing for over 5 h, wherein the reduced energy barrier through a synergistic action of Mo and Ni was obtained, leading to a low energy equivalent input.21 Given these series of great advancements, Mo, Ni-based catalysts for seawater electrolysis have been recently reported. Electrocatalysts are usually obtained by traditional temperature-programmed calcination methods in electric furnaces,22 which are typically limited by a slow heating/cooling rate, high energy consumption, and cumbersome production process.23 Typically, the sequential reduction might occur during the slow heating process, due to the different reduction potential between the Ni and Mo species, thus leading to a uniform distribution of active sites.24 For instance, Hu et al. found that the Ni element was distributed in a granular pattern on the surface of the nanorods in the process of synthesizing MoNi4/MoO3−x nanorods.25 Besides, the active sites and mechanical stability of the as-synthesized catalysts might be inevitably deteriorated by the agglomeration, surface oxidation, and weak interactions with the substrate, which could not allow them to adapt to the high current densities (200 to 1000 mA cm−2), ultralong operation duration (>600 h) and elevated temperature (>50 °C) needed for commercial advanced alkaline water electrolyzers.26 Thus, synthesizing highly active catalysts with the prospect of industrial application by low-cost, effective methodologies is still recognized as a challenge.
Recently, the Joule heating method has been considered as an innovative and highly efficient method based on electrical Joule heating. The target temperature could be provided in an ultrashort treatment time, which might overcome the uneven distribution of active sites due to the difference in reduction potential.27 Besides, the high-temperature-variation rate can not only avoided the agglomeration and unstable dispersion, but also endow the resultant catalyst with structural advantages, such as oxygen vacancies and stacking faults, which would be potentially beneficial to the HER performance. Chen et al. proposed a facile high-temperature-assisted strategy to convert iron pyrite into uniformly distributed nanostructured FeS2, which exhibited highly superior electrochemistry (139 mV @ 10 mA cm−2).28 Fei et al. prepared a Co–N–C single-atom monolith via ultrafast Joule heating, wherein the instantaneous quenching played an important role in achieving a stable atomic-scale dispersion so as to avoid the blockage of active sites.29
In this work, we employed a rapid Joule heating approach to achieve a freestanding electrocatalyst (MoNi4/MoOx) grown on Ni foam for seawater electrolysis, wherein the MoNi4 alloy nanoparticles could be anchored on MoOx in an Ar–H2 (10%) atmosphere. Proved by a series of electrochemical measurements, the MoNi4/MoOx exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance under alkaline seawater conditions. In particular, the as-prepared MoNi4/MoOx was characterized with an ultralow overpotential of 15 mV (227 mV) for generating a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (1 A cm−2), which was superior to MoNi4/MoOx-T synthesized by the traditional temperature-programmed calcination method. Combined with first-principles calculations, it was found that a high content of Mo4+ was preferred to optimize the adsorption state, leading to an improved intrinsic activity of MoNi4/MoOx. Besides, to highlight the feasibility for industrial application, the MoNi4/MoOx allow was applied as a cathode in a commercial membrane electrode assembly (MEA) stack, which could save 3.33 kW h m−3 energy at a current density of 200 mA cm−2 compared with the commercial Ni foam. Finally, combining our MoNi4/MoOx electrode with a tandem home-made PSC, we successfully fabricated a solar power-assisted water splitting device with a high STH of 11.28%, which is promising to compete in the global carbon neutral economy. This research exhibits a breakthrough in the synthesis of active commercial electrocatalysts by a low-cost method for industrial application.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a displays the Joule heating setup, wherein the different precursors were placed in a molybdenum boat, and the conductive graphite block was used as the electrode. The reaction chamber was pumped into a vacuum before the reducing gas was injected. During the process, rapid electrical Joule heating was generated leading to the target reaction temperature with a high heating/cooling rate. To highlight the difference between the Joule heating and traditional calcination, the heating rate was plotted, as shown in Fig. 1b and S1.† Compared with the traditional heating process, the target reaction temperature could be instantaneously obtained at a ramp rate of 67 °C s−1 from room temperature, which was promoted by the Joule heating. On the other hand, such a short treatment time not only led to an efficient synthesis process, but also meant a lower energy consumption, which only consumed 0.12% energy of the traditional method (Fig. 1b).

Structural characterization of MoNi4/MoOx
The processes of preparing MoNi4/MoOx is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2a. The cleaned Ni foam (donated as NF) was selected as a three-dimensional support for the coordination of ammonium molybdate and nickel nitrate, which was obtained through a hydrothermal reaction. As characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in Fig. 2b, it could be seen that the NiMoO4 precursor was a dense nanorods-like structure with a smooth surface vertically aligned on the NF matrix, which collectively formed nanospheres with a diameter of 50–80 μm. The elements Ni, Mo, and O were uniformly distributed in the hybrids (Fig. S2†), wherein the atomic ratio of Ni:Mo:O ≈ 1:1.2:3, as confirmed by the X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results (Fig. S3†). Fig. S4a† shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the precursor (PDF# 13-0128), indicating the successful synthesis of NiMoO4.30 Subsequent Joule heating under the reduction atmosphere rapidly dehydrated and decomposed the NiMoO4 to MoNi4 alloy and MoOx (denoted as MoNi4/MoOx), which could be confirmed by the XRD pattern (PDF# 65-5480; PDF# 32-0671) in Fig. S4b.†20 Due to the strong diffraction peaks attributed to the Ni foam (PDF# 04-0850),31 the diffraction peaks of MoNi4 were not obvious. Typically, it should be noted that the as-produced MoNi4/MoOx well inherited the nanorods-like structure from the precursor as confirmed by the SEM image (Fig. 2d). In addition, the corresponding mapping (Fig. 2g) for the elements Ni, Mo, and O showed their uniform distribution on MoNi4/MoOx, wherein the atomic ratio of Ni:Mo:O ≈ 1:1:2 as confirmed by the EDX result (Fig. S5†). It was worth noting that numerous MoNi4 alloy particles in the range of ∼50 nm were attached to the surface nanorods, which increased the specific surface area, thus providing abundant active sites for the electrocatalytic reaction. More importantly, the porous and rough structure of MoNi4/MoOx could be observed from Fig. 2d, indicating the increased accessible surface area and exposure of active sites, which could also be confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 2e and S6†). Clearly, from the TEM images, the lattice fringes with lattice distances (Fig. 2e and S7†) of 0.27 nm and 0.19 nm were assigned to the (1 0 1) plane of MoO2 and the (2 2 0) plane of MoNi4, respectively, which was consistent with the XRD results. Typically, numerous interconnected MoNi4 nanoparticles (marked with red lines) were tightly anchored on the MoOx, which not only formed the interface to facilitate the transfer of electrons as well as refining the intermediate binding capability, but also enhanced the mechanical stability during the electrocatalytic reaction.32 Moreover, abundant defects could be clearly observed (Fig. 2f) which might have resulted from the rapid heating and cooling process.31

To emphasize the difference between the traditional heating and Joule heating, MoNi4/MoOx-T was synthesized by the traditional high-temperature calcination. Remarkably, XRD characterization showed that the MoNi4/MoOx-T had the same composition of MoNi4/MoOx (Fig. S4c†). Also, the geometric morphologies of dense flower-like nanorods for MoNi4/MoOx-T were also revealed by SEM (Fig. 2c), wherein MoNi4 nanoparticles with an average size of 51 nm were embedded on the substrate (Fig. S8a and b†). Despite the morphological similarity to MoNi4/MoOx-T, the MoNi4/MoOx was characterized by smaller MoNi4 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 46 nm and a porous surface (Fig. 2d, S8c and d†), in which the desirable morphology might be attributed to the rapid Joule heating. A small nanoparticle size usually indicates a large surface area and abundant active sites. Meanwhile, it has been proved that rational morphology engineering (such as fabricating a porous structure) is beneficial for the diffusion of the electrolyte as well as for achieving a specific surface area.33,34 To verify the above conclusion, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements were performed using the BET method, as shown in Fig. S9,† indicating that the specific surface area of the as-prepared MoNi4/MoOx had a much larger value (16.9 m2 g−1) than for MoNi4/MoOx-T (9.1 m2 g−1), indicating the presence of rich surface-active sites, facilitated ion transport, and the likelihood of a rapid release of gases on the surface. The shape of the hysteresis loops indicated the presence of non-rigid aggregates of plate-like particles,35 which provide sufficient active areas for the HER. The aperture distribution of MoNi4/MoOx showed that the sizes of the mesopores mainly ranged from 4 to 20 nm (inset of Fig. S9†). In addition, the elements Ni, Mo, and O exhibited a poor dispersion on the surface of MoNi4/MoOx-T (Fig. S10†), while a uniform distribution and few agglomeration of MoNi4/MoOx was obtained (Fig. 2g) due to the ultrafast heating/cooling rate treatment time in the Joule heating.36 Such a differentiation might be caused by the reduction potentials of metal oxides.24 During the reduction in a hydrogen atmosphere, the reductive reaction of Ni species preferentially occurred on the NiMoO4 precursor due to the relevant lower standard molar enthalpies of formation (ΔHΘ) than for Mo species, wherein the ΔHΘ (298 K) of NiO was 240 kJ mol−1, i.e., much lower than the ΔHΘ (298 K) of MoO3 (1037 kJ mol−1).37 The target temperature obtained in such an ultrashort treatment time promoted the simultaneous reduction reaction of Mo and Ni, leading to a uniform distribution of active sites. The above results demonstrated that Joule heating treatment methods could achieve the formation of defects, and a uniform distribution of elements, as well as play an important role in morphology evolution for electrocatalysts.
X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed next to further gain insights into the chemical state of NiMoO4, MoNi4/MoOx, and MoNi4/MoOx-T. The presence of the Ni, Mo, and O elements in the as-prepared samples was verified by the XPS survey spectra in Fig. 3a and S11a,† which agreed with the EDS results. For the Mo 3d spectra, the MoNi4/MoOx catalyst showed four valence states of Mo6+ (232.18 eV), Mo5+ (230.44 eV), Mo4+ (229.39 eV), and Mo0 (228.04 eV) in Fig. 3b, revealing the reduction from the NiMoO4 precursor (Fig. S11b†) via Joule heating in the reductive atmosphere.38 Meanwhile, the relatively low valence states of Mo4+ and Mo5+ confirmed the presence of MoOx accompanied with oxygen vacancies, which was favorable for the excitation of delocalized electrons to the conduction band, thus leading to enhanced conductivity.39 Compared to MoNi4/MoOx-T (Mo4+/Mo5+ = 0.17:1), the content of Mo4+ in MoNi4/MoOx (Mo4+/Mo5+ = 0.90:1) was much increased, meaning the concentration of surface Mo4+ was improved, leading to accelerated HER performance.35 This might be due to the low empty d-orbital density of Mo4+ species in MoNi4/MoOx.40 Such a superiority in electronic structure make it easier for H radicals to combine with Mo4+, thus leading to enhanced HER performance, which was explored via subsequent DFT theoretical studies. Moreover, the peak moved to a higher binding energy, which meant that the heating method could regulate the electronic structure. For the Ni 2p spectra41 (Fig. 3c), two groups of spin–orbit peaks were exhibited, which included Ni2+ (2p3/2 and 2p1/2) peaks at 856.30 and 874.04 eV with satellite peaks at 862.13 and 880.38 eV, and others located at 852.86 and 870.22 eV, which were assigned to Ni0. Compared to the NiMoO4 (Fig. S11b and c†), the obvious signals of Ni0 and Mo0 suggested the formation of the MoNi4 alloy after Joule heating in the reductive atmosphere.25 For the O 1s spectra (Fig. 3d), obvious peaks at 530.51 and 531.68 eV were exhibited assigned to the lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancies, while another was observed located at 533.10 eV belonging to the H–O bond of the surface absorption species.32 Notably, oxygen vacancies were generated in comparison with NiMoO4 (Fig. S11d†), which might have been caused by the unsaturated coordination environment due to the presence of the low valence states of Mo4+ and Mo5+. Besides, the ratio of oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen in MoNi4/MoOx (0.4:1) was higher than in MoNi4/MoOx-T (0.15:1), indicating the presence of more abundant oxygen vacancies as shown in Fig. 3d, wherein the introduction of oxygen vacancies played an important role in tailoring the electronic structure to enhance the catalytic activity.

Investigation of the HER activities
In order to explore the electrocatalytic activities of MoNi4/MoOx and MoNi4/MoOx-T, the HER performance was tested, wherein the electrocatalysts were applied as the working electrode in alkaline seawater electrolyte, respectively. Natural seawater was collected from the South Yellow Sea (35°55E, 120°42N), which contained 3.5% salts, and was further treated by KOH. The elemental composition and relative content are shown in Fig. S12a and b.† For comparison, Ni@NF, Mo@NF, and the benchmark Pt/C catalyst were also tested under the same conditions with MoNi4/MoOx. Fig. 4a shows the LSV curves. Encouragingly, the required overpotential for the current density of 10 mA cm−2 with MoNi4/MoOx was only 15 mV in alkaline seawater electrolyte, exceeding that for Ni@NF, Mo@NF, Pt/C, and other reported catalysts42–50 (Fig. 4b). We then verified the commerciality of MoNi4/MoOx at a large current density of 1 A cm−2 in alkaline seawater, which only needed 227 mV, indicating a record activity in alkaline media (Fig. S13†).

(f) Contact angle of MoNi4/MoOx. (g) Chronopotentiometry at 1 A cm−2 of MoNi4/MoOx in alkaline seawater electrolyte. 
Notably, MoNi4/MoOx possessed a lower overpotential than MoNi4/MoOx-T (17 mV at 10 mA cm−2), exhibiting that Joule heating was an advantageous and rapid approach for the synthesis of active electrocatalysts. Besides the porous morphology with a large specific surface area obtained via rapid Joule heating, the generated low-valence Mo4+ species played an important role too in effectively enhancing the efficiency for the HER. In order to exclude morphological effects, MoNi4/MoOx-30s and MoNi4/MoOx-90s with a low content of Mo4+ species were synthesized, which were regulated by different heating times. As shown in Fig. S14a,† the content of Mo4+ species in MoNi4/MoOx was higher than that in MoNi4/MoOx-30s and MoNi4/MoOx-90s, wherein the chemical state and relevant content of Ni and O species were almost identical (Fig. S14b and c†). Expectedly, MoNi4/MoOx-30s and MoNi4/MoOx-90s showed lower activity than MoNi4/MoOx, as shown in Fig. S15,† indicating that the improvement from Mo4+ might be a positive way to optimize the HER energetics.
Moreover, Tafel plots calculated from the LSV curves showed a small value of 29.9 mV dec−1 for MoNi4/MoOx, which was lower than those of MoNi4/MoOx-T (37.8 mV dec−1), Pt/C (50.7 mV dec−1), Mo@NF (72.1 mV dec−1), and Ni@NF (145.4 mV dec−1) (Fig. 4c). The value of the Tafel plots indicated a faster reaction kinetics and implied a two-electron transfer process on the MoNi4/MoOx, which should follow a conventional Volmer–Tafel mechanism, with the rate-determining step (RDS) associated with the H2 desorption (Tafel step).51,52
Furthermore, EIS measurements were employed to investigate the interfacial charge-transfer kinetics (Fig. 4d). Based on the Nyquist plots, which were analyzed with the respective fitted circuit diagram (Fig. S16†), MoNi4/MoOx showed a minimum charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.18 Ω among all the samples, but 1.17 Ω for MoNi4/MoOx-T, indicating its much faster electron transport during the HER. This promoted electron transfer was not only due to the metallic MoNi4 alloy but also a result of the abundant oxygen vacancies generated from the low valence states of Mo4+ and Mo5+.53
Besides the interfacial charge-transfer ability, the number of exposed active sites plays an important role in achieving excellent HER activity. To get insights into the distinct merit of MoNi4/MoOx, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was assessed, which reflects the HER performance of the as-prepared catalysts via the CV curves in the non-faradaic region. Typically, a series of CV measurements were performed for MoNi4/MoOx, MoNi4/MoOx-T, Mo@NF, and Ni@NF carried out under scan rates from 2 to 10 mV s−1 (Fig. S17a–d†). As shown in Fig. 4e, MoNi4/MoOx possessed the highest value of Cdl (130.0 mF cm−2) among MoNi4/MoOx-T (63.4 mF cm−2), Mo@NF (37.1 mF cm−2), and Ni@NF (2.1 mF cm−2), which was positively correlated to the ESCA. Compared with MoNi4/MoOx-T, such a high value of electrochemical capacitance for MoNi4/MoOx could be ascribed to the rough surface and good dispersibility formed by the rapid Joule heating,24 which agreed with the results from the SEM and TEM analyses. In addition, the ESCA-normalized specific activity of MoNi4/MoOx was analyzed, wherein MoNi4/MoOx showed superior intrinsic HER performance than other reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts, as shown in Fig. S18a, b and Table S1.† Moreover, the intrinsic catalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were detected based on the TOF. The number of active sites of the as-prepared samples was measured by the CVs in Fig. S19a–d† and the results are summarized in Table S2.† Furthermore, as shown in Fig. S19e,† MoNi4/MoOx showed the highest value of TOF (34.86 s−1) than MoNi4/MoOx-T (7.64 s−1), Mo@NF (4.70 s−1), and Ni@NF (20.88 s−1) at 100 mV, indicating its enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity.
Apart from the catalytic activity, the electrochemical durability, as a crucial parameter for HER electrocatalysts, of MoNi4/MoOx was also tested at a constant current density of 1 A cm−2 for 1000 h (Fig. 4g). During the long-term testing, MoNi4/MoOx showed superb durability without noticeable activity degradation for the activity due to the in situ-formed hierarchical tandem-type structure.32 The XRD pattern of MoNi4/MoOx post electrolysis after 1 h (Fig. S20†) was obtained, and showed no visible change after the test at 1 A cm−2, indicating the excellent catalytic durability and chemical composition. Such excellent long-time durability suggested its feasibility for practical application, especially in seawater, wherein chloride corrosion is considered a major challenge. Meanwhile, due to the presence of chloride ions in seawater, the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) might be generated, which would be converted to hypochlorite species in alkaline electrolyte and would compete with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).54 Here, the CER resistance performance of MoNi4/MoOx was determined by a spectrophotometric method using N,N-diethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine. The content of hypochlorite species was determined by measuring the absorbance of the treated electrolysis solution, which was collected after 1000 h test at 1 A cm−2. By comparing the measured absorbance with the standard curve (Fig. S21†), it was found that the content of hypochlorite remained basically the same before and after electrolysis (Table S3†), indicating the outstanding selectivity for seawater electrolysis. For comparison, we measured the electrolyte treated by using NF as the cathode for only 1 h (1 A cm−2), wherein the generated hypochlorite was much higher concentration than MoNi4/MoOx. Such a result might due to the ultralow overpotential (<0.480 V) provided by the three-electrode system that included MoNi4/MoOx, wherein the overpotential window was 0–0.480 V to promote the OER in alkaline seawater.54
In addition to that, the hydrophilicity as decided by the chemical components and structure of the catalyst was measured, wherein the good wettability suggested an enhanced transfer of electrolytes and hydrogen bubbles due to the low interfacial adhesion energy.55 As shown in Fig. 4f, the water was instantly absorbed by the solid surface, which was attributed to the 3D rugged morphology.
DFT calculations
To further interpret the increased electrolytic performance provided by the high ratio of Mo4+/Mo5+ in MoNi4/MoOx, theoretical investigations were carried out based on DFT. First, the models of the MoO2 and Mo2O5 crystals were chosen, which both crystallize in the orthorhombic Cmcm space group, and where the O2− was bonded with equivalent Mo4+ and Mo5+ atoms, respectively. For confirmation of the valence difference between the two types of crystals, qualitative valence analysis was performed by Bader charge analysis, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. Moreover, the DOS (density of states) for the MoO2 and Mo2O5 crystals were calculated (Fig. 5c), wherein the value at the Fermi level of the crystal containing Mo4+ was significantly improved compared to in Mo2O5, indicating the presence of more charge carriers and higher electrical conductivity.56 Furthermore, guided by the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, the hydrogen adsorption ability ΔGH* on the Mo sites were calculated, wherein a moderate ΔGH* that was close to zero is generally considered as the standard for excellent electrocatalysts.57 The optimized structures of MoO2 and Mo2O5 used for the calculation for the ΔGH* are shown in Fig. 5d. Fig. 5d shows that the H* adsorption energy on the top side of Mo4+ (−0.56 eV) was better than on Mo5+ (0.64 eV), leading to good proton adsorption and H desorption behaviors. Overall, the DFT results revealed the positive influence of Mo4+ on the HER performance, which accorded well with the electrochemical measurements.

Overall measurements of the water splitting activities
Considering the excellent performance for the HER, the overall water splitting (OWS) activities were also tested without iR compensation in alkaline seawater electrolyte, wherein the self-assembled MoNi4/MoOx served as the cathode while the commercial RuO2 served as the anode. As shown in Fig. 6a, the required potential for reaching 50 mA cm−2 was only 1.67 V for MoNi4/MoOx//RuO2, which was much lower than that of the benchmark Pt/C//RuO2 (1.93 V). Such a large gap indicated that MoNi4/MoOx had the potential to serve as an active and cost-effective electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting. Furthermore, the faradaic efficiency of MoNi4/MoOx at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater was measured by the conventional drainage method (Fig. S22†). As shown in Fig. 6b, the H2/O2 volume ratio was close to 2:1, matching well to the calculated gaseous product evolution, which led to a ∼100% faradaic efficiency and indicating the high HER selectivity on the MoNi4/MoOx cathode.

Measurements in a single stack of a commercial hydrogen generator
Besides, in order to confirm the feasibility of the application, we also combined MoNi4/MoOx and Ni foam in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrochemical reactor (Fig. 7a), with the commercial Ni foam//Ni foam also applied for comparison. In such a system, MoNi4/MoOx was used as the cathode and Ni foam as the anode, separated by an alkaline exchange membrane as shown in Fig. 7b. As shown in Fig. 7c, the required voltage of 1.7 V was reached for the MoNi4/MoOx//Ni foam to drive 10 mA cm−2, which was less than that required by Ni foam//Ni foam pairs of 2.1 V. Besides, with the introduction of MoNi4/MoOx, the needed voltages decreased to 2.01, 2.21, 2.37, and 2.51 V to achieve high current densities of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mA cm−2, wherein the high voltage might due to the inherently poor conductivity of the add-on devices. Under a series of voltages, the relevant energy consumption was calculated to further reflect the superiority of our system in commercial applications. Table S4† presents the energy consumption under the different voltages, wherein the introduction of MoNi4/MoOx was confirmed to visually improve the energy efficiency. Notably, the saved energy was up to 3.33 kW h m−3 at a voltage of 2.51 V (related to 200 mA cm−2), as calculated by eqn (S1) in the ESI.† Remarkably, the MoNi4/MoOx//Ni foam displayed almost the same LSV curves under different flow rates, while the performance of the Ni foam//Ni foam system decreased under a lower flow rate (Fig. S23†), which might have been caused by the influence of hydrophilicity. Moreover, the durability of the MEA electrochemical reactor containing MoNi4/MoOx was tested (Fig. 7d), and a performance improvement was observed during the initial period, which might have been caused by the adsorption of Mo2O72− in alkaline seawater, which was formed by the leaching of Mo, as reported by Zhang et al.58 Such a system exhibited good stability over 16 h at a constant 250 mA cm−2, wherein a minor shift was noted caused by the influence of restarting the peristaltic pumps and indicating the feasibility of the system in practical applications.

Measurement in five stacks of commercial hydrogen generators
To highlight the significance for industrial applications, we further expanded the scale of the MEA electrochemical reactor by integrating five groups of MoNi4/MoOx cathodes and Ni foam anodes with a DC motor (Fig. 8a and S24a–d†). The water electrolysis device could be connected in paralleled by wires to obtain the same voltage. Typically, the current density under different voltages with the MoNi4/MoOx//Ni foam were higher than with the commercial Ni foam//Ni foam (Fig. 8b), wherein the needed cell voltages, in the alkaline seawater at room temperature (20 °C), to achieve 100, 300, and 500 mA cm−2 were as low as 2.62, 3.75, and 4.66 V, respectively. Typically, the performance of the systems in the 50 °C electrolyte was improved to 2.32, 3.31, and 4.21 V to achieve 100, 300, and 500 mA cm−2, noting the adaptability of MoNi4/MoOx to perform in harsh operating conditions, which is noticeably favorable for its potential industrial application. Most importantly, the introduction of MoNi4/MoOx was beneficial to the energy efficiency, with the calculated values listed in the ESI Table S5,† indicting its potential for scaling up production capabilities.

Measurements in a solar power-assisted water splitting device
Moreover, we fabricated a solar power-assisted water splitting device to reflect the superiority of MoNi4/MoOx for sustainable application under AM 1.5G simulated solar power. A MoNi4/MoOx//RuO2 electrolyzer was assembled in a series of PSCs for carbon-free hydrogen generation in alkaline seawater, wherein a tandem PSC was obtained by integrating two single PSCs to achieve enough photovoltage to drive seawater electrolysis. First, in order to confirm the light-driven reliability of such a system, transient photocurrent response measurements were performed under chopped illumination, wherein a constant operating current value could be rapidly obtained under illumination (Fig. 9a). Then, as shown in Fig. 9b, the I–V curves of the 2 PSCs in series module exhibited an open circuit voltage of 1.69 V and short circuit current density of 13.40 mA cm−2. Typically, the theoretical operation current density of the solar power-assisted water splitting device was defined by the intersection point of the I–V curves (Fig. 9b) of the MoNi4/MoOx//RuO2 system and PSC, which gave a value of 9.14 mA cm−2, corresponding to a significantly high STH of 11.28%. In comparison, the theoretical operation current density of the Pt/C//RuO2 system coupled with PSC was also calculated, which only exhibited an STH of 8.61%, as shown in Fig. S25.† Moreover, the actual current density and STH efficiency of such a system could be steadily maintained for 1000 s without noticeable fluctuation (Fig. 9c), illuminating the possibility for the combination of clean energy conversion and practical applications. Finally, the alkaline seawater electrolyzer coupled with a commercial silicon solar cell was integrated for performing outdoor solar tests (Fig. 9d), whereby the water splitting reaction could occur normally with an STH conversion efficiency of 7.3% (Fig. S26†).

Conclusion
In summary, we reported an ultrafast and facile strategy to synthesize a self-supported MoNi4/MoOx cathode for highly active (15 mV @ 10 mA cm−2, 227 mV @ 1000 mA cm−2) and stable (1 A cm−2 @ 1000 h) seawater electrolysis by a simple process of Joule heating the NiMoO4 precursor for only 60 s. Besides the advantages of only 0.12% energy consumption of the traditional heating process and ultrashort synthesis cycle, the MoNi4/MoOx system exhibited better electrochemical properties than MoNi4/MoOx-T, which was not only due to the advantages of its structure but also the high content of Mo4+, as revealed by DFT calculations. The combination of MoNi4/MoOx and Ni foam in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrochemical reactor was completed to give an OWS system, wherein the saved energy was up to 3.33 kW h m−3 at a current density of 200 mA cm−2 compared with the commercial Ni foam//Ni foam system. Finally, tests of the carbon-free hydrogen generation system upon AM 1.5G simulated solar power were carried out to realize 11.28% STH efficiency with long-stability, which illuminated the possibility for solar-driven hydrogen production in the future.
Experimental section
Synthesis of NiMoO4
The NF was cut into 1 cm × 3 cm strips, and washed with 2 M HCl in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min in order to remove the oxide layer. Then, the NF was further ultrasonically cleaned to remove the organic species in acetone solution for 10 min. Finally, the as-treated NF was further washed with de-ionized (DI) water and ethanol three times.
The cleaned NF was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave containing 40 mM of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 10 mM of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, which was heated at 150 °C for 6 h. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the yellow-green sample coated on NF was taken out, washed with DI water three times, and dried in air for 12 h. The as-prepared sample was labeled as NiMoO4.
Synthesis of MoNi4/MoOx
The synthesized NiMoO4 was sandwiched between two molybdenum boats mounted on conductive carbon plates with a gap. The Joule heating was achieved by applying constant current to such a system. The sample was heated for 60 s at 500 °C under an Ar–H2 (10%) flow. For comparison, samples (MoNi4/MoOx-t) with different heating times (t = 30, 90 s) were obtained under the same conditions. The preparation of Ni@NF was the same as that for MoNi4/MoOx except that the (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was removed during the synthesis of the precursor. The preparation of Mo@NF was the same as that of MoNi4/MoOx except that the Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was removed during the synthesis of the precursor. For comparison, the NiMoO4 precursor was heated in a tube furnace, which was maintained at 500 °C for 2 h under 150 mL min−1 Ar–H2 (10%) flow. After calcination, the obtained sample was named as MoNi4/MoOx-T.
Materials characterization
The crystal structure was recorded by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku Miniflex 600). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha system. The morphology and structure of the obtained samples were tested using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL JEM 2100) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Zeiss Gemini 300) systems coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) unit. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model were tested on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 system. A Dataphysics OCA 20 contact angle system was applied to test the hydrophilicity of the electrodes.
Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical measurements of the pre-synthesized samples were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) coupled with a standard three-electrode system in alkaline seawater (pH 14). The as-prepared samples, Hg/HgO electrode, and graphite rod (3 mm in diameter) were used as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. For comparison, 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2 electrodes were prepared. A homogeneous ink was formed by weighing and dispersing 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2 into Nafion solution (Nafion:ethanol = 1:10). Then, the ink was loaded on the NF to form a cathode and anode (2 mg cm−2). The measured potentials versus Hg/HgO reference electrode were transformed into RHE by the equation ERHE = ESCE + 0.098 V + 0.0592pH, with removing the IR drop. To evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and Tafel slopes could be obtained from the LSV curves. In order to investigate the double-layer capacitance values (Cdl), cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were measured at different scan rates (from 2 to 10 mV s−1). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed with the frequency range from 10−5 to 10−2 Hz. A two-electrode configuration was used to test the overall seawater splitting activity. The stability tests for the HER were conducted under a constant current density without iR drop compensation. The faradaic efficiency (FE) was calculated by the following equations: FE = QE/QT, NE = V0/Vm, NT = Q/(n × F), where F is the faradaic constant (96500 C mol−1), QE is the number of hydrogens measured by the water drainage method, QT is the theoretical number of hydrogens, V0 is the actual volume of hydrogen, Vm is 22.4 L mol−1, Q is the number of charges transferred, and n is 2 (for HER). The H2 turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated by the following equation: TOF = j × NA/(F × n × m), where j is the current density obtained from the LSV; NA is the Avogadro constant; F is the faradaic constant (96500 C mol−1); and n is the number of electrons transferred to generate one molecule of hydrogen (n is 2 for HER), with the number of active sites calculated by the CV test in alkaline seawater (pH 14), which ranged from 0 V to 0.6 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
The tests in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrochemical reactor used a Ti-5MEA-2020 coupled with an electrochemical workstation, wherein the anion-exchange membrane (FAA-3-50) prevented the interference of H2 and O2.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
First-principle calculations were carried out via the Vienna ab initio simulation package, wherein the gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) parameterization was confirmed as the electron exchange–correlation function. For the structure optimization, the energy convergence criterion was set to 10−5 eV and −001 eV Å−1. The plane-wave cutoff energy was converged to 300 eV and a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh was set for the geometry optimization. The adsorption energy for the adsorbed species were obtained by using the equation: ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS, wherein ΔE represents the chemisorption energy.
Fabrication of a solar-driven electrolysis system
The solar-driven electrolysis system was analyzed by KEITHLET 2400 and CHI660 systems, wherein a 300 W xenon lamp with an AM 1.5G optical filter (100 mW cm−2) was used as the solar simulator. PSCs (0.068 cm−2) were fabricated in a glovebox, which could maintain the temperature (20 °C), oxygen (0.1 ppm), and water (0.1 ppm) conditions. The additive was prepared by dissolving blends of D18, Y6, and BTP-eC9 active layers in chloroform with 0.5 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was applied as the substrate, wherein the devices were fabricated with the structure of: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al. UV-ozone treatment of the ITO was performed after its sonication treatment in detergent solution, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially. A PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS PVP AI 4083) thin film (40 nm) was spin-coated on top of the cleaned ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. Then, the active layer was deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 3000 rpm for 35 s followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. After that, a layer of PDINO in methanol was spin-coated onto the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s and Al with a thickness of 80 nm was deposited via thermal evaporation under 4 × 10−4 Pa. To achieve enough photovoltage to drive the seawater electrolysis, two single PSCs were integrated in series, which were connected with the MoNi4/MoOx//RuO2 electrolyzer to form a solar-driven electrolysis system. The STH of such system was calculated by the formula: STH (%) = I (mA cm−2) × 1.23 (V) × 100/Psun, where I is the current density of the solar-driven electrolysis system and Psun is the incident simulated solar energy. A commercial silicon solar cell was connected with the electrolyzer for the outdoors tests.
