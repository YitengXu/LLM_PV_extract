    , Accepted 6th August 2021First published on 6th August 2021AbstractDevelopment of high-performance and highly selective NIR photodetectors (PDs) using wide band gap semiconductors is a significant field of research in the present scenario. Herein, cost effective and easy fabrication of NIR PDs is demonstrated by employing the thin films of Cd1−xMgxS (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). The influence of doping on the transport behaviour of Cd1−xMgxS CQD films was investigated by device performance under laser light illumination at various wavelengths ranging from 405 nm to 782 nm. An improvement in the photoresponsivity of the material (CdS) beyond its intrinsic absorption spectral range due to the incorporation of the dopant is noticed. In spite of the cost effective and easy fabrication process without the requirement of any rigorous synthesis procedure, the devices presented here demonstrate competitive figures of merit to those that are designed with complex structures and tedious procedures. The performance parameters viz response time, responsivity, photosensitivity, quantum efficiency, and specific detectivity were improved as a consequence of Mg doping and attained a maximum value of 110 ms, ∼26.9 A W−1, ∼4.7 × 104%, ∼41.23% and ∼3.45 × 1013 Jones, respectively. Besides, the sensing range of the PDs can be tuned from visible (650 nm) to NIR (782 nm) with a huge improvement in selectivity by incorporation of Mg.
Introduction
Presently, nanostructured materials are widely studied due to their distinctive properties at the nanoscale.1–17 Among the functional materials, semiconductor nanostructures (SNSs) are regarded as potential candidates for applications in various fields including electronic and optoelectronic devices.1,2 The extra attention attracted by them is due to their large surface to volume ratio and quantum confinement effect, which not only just modify the bandgap, density of states and adsorption effect but also prolong the photo-carrier life time over the corresponding bulk counterpart. Besides, colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are compatible and printable into flexible substrates with the advantages of low costs and light weight and have prospective applications in touch screens and displays, biomedical sensors, artificial skins, solar cells, flexible displays, etc.3 One of the most studied metal chalcogenide SNSs is cadmium sulfide (CdS) that exhibits a direct bulk bandgap (∼2.42 eV at room temperature (RT)) with a wide range of applications including solar cells, light emitting diodes, lasers, photodetectors (PDs), gas sensors, temperature sensors, and bioimaging.8–17 CdS belongs to the category of wide band gap SNS materials and usually shows photoresponse for visible and ultra violet (UV) radiations,18–25 whereas for the sensing of near infrared (NIR) or infrared (IR) radiations relatively narrow band gap SNS materials like HgTe, HgSe, PbS and PbSe are preferred and most widely studied.26–30 Though the narrow band gap SNS materials possess high photosensing performance parameters, they usually suffer from lower environmental stability as compared to large band gap QDs (e.g., CdS and CdSe) that restricts their utility for long duration. On the other hand, the large band gap SNSs as an ideal case in defect free form are inappropriate for NIR PD applications due to their inability to absorb NIR photons of lower energy. However, the photoresponse of CdS can be possibly tuned from the visible to NIR region using a well-known and widely used approach of defect engineering and elemental doping. In semiconductor nanotechnology, elemental doping is widely used to intentionally introduce impurities in the host material to modulate the electrical, optical and other properties. For example, photosensing studies were performed on Cl doped CdS nanoribbons (NRs) by Wu et al. They observed an enhancement in the conductivity with an increase in dopant concentration and were able to tune the conductivity of the CdS NRs by about five orders of magnitude from 10−9 Ω cm−1 (undoped CdS) to 10−4 Ω cm−1 for the highest Cl doped sensor under 470 nm illumination.31 P. Maity and group had studied the photosensing properties of CdS:Co CQDs for NIR. They noticed an increase in dark conductivities of the CdS:Co thin films with increasing doping concentration. In addition to the dark current, the photosensitivities of these CdS:Co CQD thin films increase gradually with doping and a significant enhancement was also observed in the ZnO/CdS:Co CQD heterojunction films. They have observed the highest detectivity for the 8% doped CdS:Co heterojunction PD with a detectivity of 3.1 × 1011 Jones under the illumination of light of 820 nm wavelength and an external bias voltage of 5.0 V.1 Ma et al. illustrated a drastic drop in the resistivity of In-doped CdS nanobelts (∼3.27 Ω cm) as compared to undoped CdS nanobelts (104 Ω cm).32 NIR sensing was also carried out by Amiri et al. in polypyrrole (PPy) and PPy/CdS QD PDs at 805 nm under the illumination of different light intensities.33 The various photoconductive parameters such as responsivity, external quantum efficiency, response time and stability of Sn doped CdS individual nanowires (NWs) were analyzed by Zhou et al. to evaluate the advantage of doped NWs and the feasibility for PD application. They had observed a broader range of spectral sensing by Sn doped CdS in comparison to CdS NWs, which is beneficial for extending the application range of PDs.34 N. I. Najm et al. investigated the photosensing properties of Ag doped CdS thin films and observed the highest responsivity under visible light for 5% Ag doped CdS thin films.35 The influence of Mg content on ZnMgS based Schottky barrier PDs was studied by Lu and co-workers. They had shown a significant increase in the concentration of non-radiative deep levels upon increasing the Mg content, thus leading to a small decrease in the responsivity and quantum efficiency of the detector.36
The literature suggests that an appropriate doping in CdS nanostructures is much desired to tailor the opto-electrical properties and enhance their response up to the NIR region1 with good sensitivity and selectivity which is the stimulus for our research. Magnesium is one of the appropriate alkaline earth metals to dope CdS due to the fact that the radius of the Mg2+ ion (0.72 nm) is close to that of Cd2+ (0.97 nm). Previously, we have successfully tuned the band gap of Cd1−xMgxS QDs from 2.58 eV to 2.66 eV by varying the x values from 0 to 5 and observed a nanotwin microstructure in the QDs.37 These QDs are highly emissive and in the present work, the same QDs are used for deposition of CQD thin films by a low cost and efficient spin coating method and the effects of Mg doping on the structural, optical and electrical properties of CdS are investigated.
In the present work PDs are developed using a metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) configuration. Further, the samples were studied as PDs by irradiation with light of different wavelengths from visible to NIR. The characteristics and device merits have been evaluated for different sensors.
Experimental
Synthesis of Cd1−xMgxS (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05) QDs
The synthesis of Mg doped CdS QDs with systematically varying the concentration of Mg (0% to 5%) has been carried out at RT by the chemical co-precipitation method and discussed elsewhere in detail.37 Briefly, the two-step synthesis process involves the preparation of fresh, homogeneous and clear solutions of 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2, 0.5 M Na2S, and MgNO3 (0.001 M for 1% to 0.005 M for 5% Mg doping) in deionized water by stirring magnetically for 1 h as the first step. Secondly, the freshly prepared solution of MgNO3 (0.0 M to 0.005 M) was mixed into Cd(NO3)2 solution to achieve a desired concentration dopant viz. 0% to 5% of Mg during continuous stirring for further 1 h followed by the dropwise injection of Na2S solution and appropriate amount of ethylenediamine into each aqueous solution of mixture under constant stirring. The colloidal solutions were left stirring for further 1 h. Finally, yellow precipitates with slightly different shades were obtained, indicating the formation of Cd1−xMgxS QDs. These precipitates were washed 3–4 times and dried at 150 °C. The dried samples were crushed to obtain a fine powder of Cd1−xMgxS QDs.
Fabrication and characterization of Cd1−xMgxS CQD thin film PDs
The Cd1−xMgxS (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05) CQD thin films were then deposited on a p-type Si substrate using DMF as the solvent by spin coating at a rotating speed of 2500 rpm for 30 s. Prior to the deposition, the substrate was cleaned ultrasonically by keeping it for 10 min in acetone followed by ethanol and then in DI water. After each coating, the as deposited films were dried at 200 °C on a hot plate.
The morphology of 3% Mg doped CdS QDs was studied to confirm the shape, size and structural phase using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) operating at a voltage of 300 kV using a TITAN G2 60-300 equipped with a high coherence, high brightness, field emission electron gun (X-FEG), a Cs-image corrector and an electron gun monochromator. The crystal structure and structural properties of Cd1−xMgxS CQD films were studied with a Rigaku Miniflex X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα line (λ = 1.54 Å). Absorption spectra of the films deposited on glass substrates were recorded using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy (UV–Vis Shimadzu 2600). A Keithley 2480-semiconductor characterization system was used to study the conductivity of the as prepared thin films. Further, to test the photosensing properties of Cd1−xMgxS CQD films, photosensing devices (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 corresponding to x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05 respectively) were fabricated by making a metal–semiconductor–metal (M–S–M) structure in symmetric geometry using high purity silver paste as designed earlier.18,19 The photosensing characteristics are tested under illumination with different lasers of wavelengths 405 nm, 532 nm, 635 nm, 650 nm and 782 nm and a power of 1 mW at different bias voltages.
Results and discussion
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
TEM is performed to investigate the shape, size, size distribution, defects and defect density in Mg doped CdS QDs. The sample for the TEM measurement was prepared by drop-casting the colloidal solution on carbon-coated TEM grids.
The TEM micrograph in Fig. 1(a) depicts isolated, homogeneous, and mono-dispersed QDs of 3% Mg doped CdS. The size distribution of the said sample is also shown in the inset of the figure. The estimated particle size for 3% Mg doped CdS QDs is 3.9 nm with particle distribution in the range of 2.3 nm–9.1 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is taken to confirm the crystalline structure of QDs. The inset of Fig. 1 shows the SAED pattern of the Mg doped CdS QDs. The SAED pattern consists of concentric broad rings corresponding to (1 1 1), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) diffraction planes and thus identified and confirmed the cubic structure of CdS. HRTEM was used to examine the microstructure of the QDs and is shown in Fig. 1(b). The different spots located in Fig. 1(b) correspond to the (111), (220) and (200) planes of CdS with inter-planar spacings of 0.3336 nm, 0.224 nm and 0.371 nm respectively. These planes represent the cubic phase of the CdS as the symmetry favours the cubic structure for the spherical nucleus during the nucleation process. Further, the CdS QDs possess single twin boundary highlighted in Fig. 1(b) and illustrated by white colour. The existence of the twin boundary affects the electrical properties of the materials due to the application of voltage across the grain boundary as they form both reverse and forward biased junctions. Besides, defects like twin boundaries also modify the optical properties of the materials.

X-ray diffraction
The crystallinity and the phase identification of Cd1−xMgxS CQD thin films are analysed by XRD in the scan range of 20° to 60°. XRD patterns of the Cd1−xMgxS CQD thin films with varying Mg content from 0 to 5 wt% are shown in Fig. 2 which exhibits strong dominated orientations at 26.42°, 43.68° and 51.73° corresponding to the (111), (220) and (311) planes respectively which confirms the cubic phase in all thin films. It is obvious that no additional diffraction peak is observed as a consequence of impurity incorporation; i.e., Cd2+ sites may be occupied by Mg2+ which suggests that all the Mg2+ ions substitute Cd2+ ions in the CdS lattice. It has also been observed that the doping with Mg ions affects the intensity as well as the FWHM and diffraction peaks become sharper for the highest percentage of dopant, thus demonstrating the improvement in crystal quality. Further, the average crystallite size of Cd(1−x)MgxS CQD thin films is calculated from the dominant peak in the XRD pattern using the Scherrer equation: (1)where k is a particle shape dependent constant, t is the crystallite diameter (Å), λ is the wavelength of CuKα radiation, β is the full width at half maxima (FWHM), and θ is the Bragg diffraction angle (in degrees). It has been found that the particle size increases from ∼1.3 nm for pure to ∼2.1 nm for 5% Mg doped CdS thin films, showing a quantum confinement effect in all films. The increase in Mg content from 1% to 5% leads to an increase in the crystallinity of the doped CdS CQD thin films as compared to the pure CdS CQD thin film.

UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy
Absorbance of the Cd1−xMgxS CQD thin films is recorded in the range 350 nm to 1000 nm. It is obvious from absorption spectra that Cd1−xMgxS CQD thin films show good absorbance in the visible and NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum of light. The development of the absorption peak in the NIR region with an increase in concentration of Mg ions can be clearly seen in contrast to just a hump in the case of the CdS thin film. Moreover, absorbance in the NIR region with Mg ion concentration is not linear. It increases up to 2% of Mg concentration and then decreases up to 4% of Mg concentration. Further, an increase in Mg concentration (5%) results in an increase in absorbance of the films. The generation of the NIR peak in Mg doped CdS may be due to the construction of a doping band (DB) in between the conduction and valence band of CdS as in the case of Co doped CdS which is possibly located in the vicinity of the valence band.1
As far as the case of the CdS CQD thin film is concerned, there are several reports in the literature that suggest the existence of NIR absorption in solution processed films due to the defects present. For instance, Sharma et al. reported the prominence of the peak at 760 nm by growing Au nanoislands over CdS due to the stimulated emission of charge carriers which get trapped in trap states present near the conduction band of the CdS film.38 In a nutshell, it can be inferred that even being a wide band gap semiconductor, CdS can exhibit NIR absorption which can be further enhanced and tuned by an appropriate doping element and its concentration in solution processed CQD thin films.
Electrical measurements of S0, S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5 PDs and device performance
The electrical measurements for S0 to S5 PDs are carried out under the dark and illumination with light of different wavelengths ranging from the VIS to NIR region for the applied bias voltage ranging from −5 V to 5 V. This range of voltage is highly suitable for portable device applications. The generated photocurrent (Iph) is recorded for all devices under the illuminating wavelength of 405 nm, 532 nm, 635 nm, 650 nm and 782 nm.
The linear plots of this I–V characteristic under the dark and various illumination wavelengths for S0, S1, …, S5 PDs are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†). The I–V response shows nonlinear (Schottky) behaviour with sufficient availability of charge carriers to maintain high photocurrents. It is evident from Fig. S1† that the S0 PD shows photoresponse in the entire spectrum of the visible region (i.e. in its intrinsic absorption range) with comparatively high photocurrent in a broad spectral range from 532 nm to 650 nm. However, the maximum photocurrent is observed under 650 nm illumination with a high photo to dark current ratio (Iph/Id) of ∼275. In contrast, PD S1 shows good response ranging from NIR region (beyond intrinsic absorption) to the visible (intrinsic absorption) region of electromagnetic spectrum with maximum photocurrent under 782 nm illumination. It is noteworthy here that the CdS film is not expected to absorb IR wavelengths and thereby the significant photoconductivity. Here addition of NIR photoresponse and further tailoring in the photoresponse region occur as a consequence of incorporation of the dopant (Mg). It is well worthy to notice here from Fig. S1 and S2† (the semi log plots of I–V characteristics under the dark and all illuminating wavelengths for all PDs) that the photo-carrier concentration decreases under the illumination at 650 nm with an increase in dopant concentration up to 4%. In contrast, an increase in photo-carrier concentration and thereby photocurrent is noticed under the illumination of 782 nm light as a function of dopant concentration up to 3%. It turns into an improvement in the selectivity of PDs for 782 nm as a function of dopant concentration up to 4% with Iph/Id of ∼315. The Iph/Id varies differently for different sensors (Fig. 3) and achieved a maximum of ∼484 for S3. The value of Iph/Id is changed by more than an order for S3 compared to that for S0 under illumination of 782 nm light, which can be easily estimated by the semi log plots of I–V characteristics of the dark and photocurrents (Fig. 3).

I–V characteristics of the dark and photocurrents produced for S0, …, S5 PDs under the irradiation of 782 nm light. 
To appraise the performance of PDs, figures of merit (FOMs) have been estimated. The most important parameters of PDs i.e. FOMs are the sensitivity (S), responsivity (R), specific detectivity (D) and external quantum efficiency (EQE). The sensitivity S reveals the relative change in the photocurrent with respect to dark current and the responsivity R indicates the ability of optical power conversion into electrical signals, whereas EQE measures the number of collected charge carriers per unit incident photons and is closely related to the R value and detectivity D is the photosensitivity per unit area of a detector which makes it easier to compare the characteristics of different detectors. The aforementioned characteristic parameters are mathematically expressed as19 (2) (3) (4)and (5)where Pin indicates the light intensity of the source, Id and Iph are the dark and photocurrent respectively, the active area (A) of device is 1 mm2 and q, h and c have their usual meanings. All these four parameters have been estimated and are presented in Fig. S3(a–d)† as a function of sensors and illuminating wavelengths at a bias voltage of 5 V, whereas Fig. S4(a–f)† shows PD FOMs with varying bias voltages under illumination of 782 nm light. The analysis of the same is briefly described here.
Fig. S3† illustrates the PD FOMs as a function of illuminating wavelengths at a bias voltage of 5 V. There is a competitive variation of FOMs of various PDs under illumination at different wavelengths. The on/off (Iph/Id) ratio and thereby the S value increase significantly with doping under the different illumination with light at 5 V as noticed from Fig. S3(a).† It can be observed from Fig. S3(a)† that S0 has a high S value in the broad range of the visible spectrum (532 nm–650 nm) with the highest S value at 650 nm, whereas it shifts towards the NIR region (782 nm) for other PDs i.e. with the incorporation of Mg ions which demonstrates the participation of charge carriers generated corresponding to dopant levels and proves that Mg is an efficient dopant for tuning the electrical transport properties and sensing region of CdS thin films. The highest S value was recorded for the S3 PD with a value of 47000 under the illumination of 782 nm light, which is nearly twice the S value of S0 under 650 nm illumination. Moreover, the S value of the S3 PD is twice and more than ten times the S value for the S0 PD under 650 nm and 782 nm, respectively.
The PD EQE with varying wavelength of illuminating light is demonstrated in Fig. S3(b).† It is evident that the upmost EQE is noticed for S0 in the entire visible region with a peak value of ∼68% in the range of 532 nm–650 nm; however, it is drastically supressed under the illumination of 782 nm light. In contrast, the EQE value improved significantly for other PDs under illumination of 782 nm light and attains a maximum value of ∼42% for S2, which is well below the EQE of S0 under 650 nm. The variation of the D value for different PDs and illumination wavelength (Fig. S3(c)†) confirms that the D value of S0 (∼4 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1) and S3 (∼3.6 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1) is comparable under the illumination at 650 nm and 782 nm, respectively. The illuminating wavelength dependent variation of the PD R value (Fig. S3(d)†) reveals that the highest R value for S2 (∼27 A W−1) under 782 nm illumination is close to the R value of S0 (∼36.5 A W−1) under 650 nm. One can see that S0 shows good FOMs in the broad region of the visible spectrum and tunability of the sensing region from visible to NIR with competitive characteristics is possible by introduction of impurity atoms (Mg) in the host material (CdS).
Further, we have examined the voltage dependent variation of PD FOMs under the illumination of 782 nm light (Fig. S4(a–f)†). The non-linear improvement in all characteristic parameters for all PDs up to a bias voltage of 4 V can be seen clearly. However, at higher bias voltage, the FOMs of different PDs vary differently. A drastic improvement in FOMs can be noticed for various PDs with respect to S0 under the same illumination wavelength of 782 nm light. However, an enhancement in numerous characteristic parameters is observed for various PDs at different bias voltages. For example, S3 demonstrates peak values of D and S and S2 shows maximum values of EQE and R at 5 V as shown in Fig. 4(a). In contrast, S4 shows the highest selectivity for NIR radiation, as FOMs under this radiation with respect to other illumination improved hugely for S4 compared to other PDs. Besides the aforementioned FOMs, response time is another critical performance parameter to decide the overall performance of PDs. The temporal variation of photocurrent for all PDs at a bias voltage of 5 V under the illumination at 782 nm light is presented in Fig. S5.† The I–t characteristics of PDs show good repeatability, reproducibility, and stability for many on/off cycles (Fig. S5†). Further, temporal variation of photocurrent is used to estimate the rise and fall times of PDs. Fig. 4b demonstrates the variation of response time as a function of PDs at a bias voltage of 5 V under the illumination of 782 nm light. It is evident here (Fig. 4(b)) that S3 is the quickest one among all fabricated PDs and responds in approximately half of the time compared to S0 particularly.

Nevertheless, it is important to evaluate the response time of PDs as a function of operating voltage. For the same purpose, we have recorded the temporal variation of all PDs for all +ve bias voltage under the exposure of 782 nm light. Here, we have shown the I–t characteristic curves of PDs only on odd voltages (3 V and 5 V) in ESI Fig. S5 and S6.† A good repeatability, reproducibility, and stability for many on/off cycles can be seen in Fig. S5 and S6† for all PDs. We have estimated the rise and fall time for PDs at all +ve bias voltages and summarized them in Table T1.† It is inferred from Table T1† that the minimum response time is recorded for S3 at all operating voltages and S3 demonstrates the fastest response at a bias voltage of 3 V. As an illustration, I–t characteristics for a number of cycles of S3 are shown in Fig. 5(a), whereas a single cycle of S3 and estimated values for response times are presented in Fig. 5(b). On the other hand, response time as a function of PDs at 3 V is demonstrated in Fig. 5(b). It is evident that the observed response time is minimum for S3 with rise and fall times of 110 ms and 116 ms, respectively. Though the response time for S3 at a bias voltage of 3 V is less than the value at the other operating voltages, the cumulative performance of S3 is much better at a bias voltage of 5 V. In a nutshell, the S3 PD operating at 5 V under the illumination of 782 nm light demonstrates the best results.

Generally, the wide band gap semiconductors are limited for NIR PDs due to their intrinsic absorption in the UV or visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, in recent years, great efforts have been made by various researchers to achieve NIR sensing using wide band gap photosensitive materials. For example, Chandra et al. have used a heterojunction of p-type vertically aligned silicon nanowires and n-type CdS nanoparticles for NIR detection. Their PD was capable of achieving a maximum Iph/Id ratio, R, and D values of ∼6.7, 821 mA W−1 and 1.21 × 1012 Jones respectively for an NIR source of 900 nm wavelength and ∼8 mW cm−2 power.39 Mahapatra et al. have exploited a simple Al/SnO2/Al photoconductive device for broad band spectral detection from UV to NIR which showed an R value of 0.19 mA W−1 under 800 nm light.40 Zheng et al. have developed a PD using ZnO/PbS QD heterostructures for detection of multiple spectral regions (UV-Vis.-NIR) and recorded an R value, D value, and response time of 0.011 A W−1, 4.2 × 107 Jones and 500 ms respectively under the exposure to 900 nm radiation of power ∼2.55 mW cm−2.41 The six times enhancement in the NIR (850 nm) photoresponsivity of polypyrrole (PPy) by incorporation of CdS QDs (22 ppm) was noticed by Amiri and Alizadeh.33 Their PPy/CdS QD (22 ppm) PD illustrated a high overall performance with a R value, on/off ratio, EQE and D value of 3.8 mA W−1, 120, 560%, and 2.1 × 1016 Jones respectively under the illumination at 850 nm wavelength with a power of 15 mW at a bias voltage of 10 V. Modeling on account of three mechanisms (diffusion, generation–recombination, and trap assisted tunnelling in dark current contribution) was proposed by Zeiri et al. to explore the electrical and optical characteristics of CdS/ZnSe based NIR PDs. They have demonstrated a quantum efficiency of ∼95%, R = ∼0.6 A W−1 and D = ∼5.7 × 1010 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at 300 K in (CdS/ZnSe)/BeTe QWs for 1550 nm.42 Sharma et al. developed high performance PDs using random Au nanoislands/CdS, which showed NIR detection beyond intrinsic absorption properties of CdS. The hot electron induced NIR PDs showed a high R value of ∼780 mA W−1 for an area of ∼57 μm2 under the illumination at 1064 nm.43 Dedong et al. reported multicolour photodetection using p-Si/SiO2/Er:CdS single NR/Ti–Au. The device showed an Ion/Ioff ratio of 10 at a bias voltage of 1 V under 955 nm illumination of 15 μW cm−2 power density with a spectral R value and EQE of 9.19 × 103 A W−1 and 1.193 × 104% respectively.44 The Ag doped p-ZnS NR-n-silicon heterojunction was used for the detection of a broad spectral range by Yu et al. Their device exhibited an Ion/Ioff ratio of 3 and an R value of 1 × 103 A W−1 at 0.5 V bias voltage under 850 nm illumination of 1 mW cm−2 power density.45 Selectivity in NIR photodetection was demonstrated by Maity et al. using the heterojunction of Co doped CdS QDs and ZnO nanoparticles. The PD fabricated using 8% Co doped CdS showed the highest D, R, and EQE of 3.1 × 1011 Jones, 0.22 A W−1, and 24.3% respectively with a rise time of 7 s and decay time of 40 s under illumination at 820 nm at an external bias of 5.0 V.1 In a nutshell, the inclusive performance of NIR PDs presented here is much better than that of the NIR PDs fabricated in recent years using various wide band gap photosensitive materials. Besides, the simple architecture and cost effective approach are the additional gems for the present device.
Conclusions
Highly selective and high performance NIR PDs are devised using Cd1−xMgxS CQD thin films. The PDs show multispectral sensing features in bare CdS and at low concentration of Mg. However, an improvement in selectivity for NIR is noticed with increasing content of Mg up to 4%. The present study illustrates the fabrication of PDs with high FOMs using a simple and cost-effective technique. The tremendous photocurrent reproducibility, selectivity and stability revealed that the fabricated PDs are remarkable candidates for application in NIR light detection.
