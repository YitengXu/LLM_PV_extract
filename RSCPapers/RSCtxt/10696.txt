However, the practical application of such a finding is found to be rather challenging especially for vehicular applications. The ideal material should reversibly store a significant amount of hydrogen under moderate conditions of pressures and temperatures. To date, such a material does not exist, and the high expectations of achieving the scientific discovery of a suitable material simultaneously with engineering innovations are out of reach. Of course, major breakthroughs have been achieved in the field, but the most promising materials still bind hydrogen too strongly and often suffer from poor hydrogen kinetics and/or lack of reversibility. Clearly, new approaches have to be explored, and the knowledge gained with high-energy ball milling needs to be exploited, i.e. size does matter! Herein, progress made towards the practical use of magnesium as a hydrogen store and the barriers still remaining are reviewed. In this context, the new approach of tailoring the properties of metal hydrides through size restriction at the nanoscale is discussed. Such an approach already shows great promise in leading to further breakthroughs because both thermodynamics and kinetics can be effectively controlled at molecular levels.Kondo-François Aguey-ZinsouKondo-François Aguey-Zinsou completed a PhD in heterogeneous catalysis at the University Paris VI in 2000.

Broader context
Hydrogen is a genuine alternative to current carbon dependence for energy production. In addition to environmental benefits, a hydrogen based economy would minimize issues related to increasing energy consumption, energy security and related geopolitical tensions. Hydrogen can be produced from many sources such as fossil fuels, water splitting, biomass and its combustion only produces water. To date, the implementation of hydrogen as an energy vector heavily depends upon the engineering of suitable storage. The technology for hydrogen production and utilisation, i.e. combustion engines and fuel cells, is relatively mature. Among the various materials able to store sufficient hydrogen for economic viability, magnesium best fits the bill in terms of abundance, cost and safety. However, the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of magnesium with respect to hydrogen restrict practical use. The strategies explored to tailor the properties of magnesium with respect to hydrogen are reviewed and their limitations in delivering practical solutions are discussed. In particular, the potential of the “size restriction” approach is examined. This includes the synthesis and characterization methods necessary to prepare magnesium nano-objects with restricted size, as well as advantages and possible limitations of size-effects on the properties of the magnesium/hydrogen couple.

1. Introduction
The idea of producing energy at local points from non-fossil sources (wind, solar, ocean tide, geo-thermal, etc.) and redistributing this energy to users through a hydrogen grid is now widely accepted; and with the continuous increase of oil prices, the growing concerns about energy security, and the environmental problems related to population and economic growth, several national and international programs have emerged within the last decade, to bring to maturity a ‘hydrogen economy’ before the end of the 21st century.1–3
Hydrogen, if it can be produced from renewable sources, would undoubtedly facilitate the convergence to sustainable developments. In particular, in the expanding sector of transportation, the use of hydrogen as a fuel would significantly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases while creating new markets supporting economical growth.2–4 In fact, it has been recognized as early as 1948 that hydrogen could substitute conventional gasoline in combustion engines.5 The use of hydrogen is advantageous in many aspects: (a) hydrogen has the highest energy density per unit of weight in comparison to any chemical, (b) it is non polluting because the major by-product of its combustion is water, (c) it is in abundance since it can be produced from water, and (d) the combination of hydrogen with fuel-cells leads to efficient energy systems. The major impediment to hydrogen use remains the problem of storing enough hydrogen fuel economically and conveniently.6–9 Conventional techniques based on gaseous storage are not satisfactory for vehicular applications which require low volume and weight stores, and the use of gaseous stores poses safety issues due to the high pressures involved. The liquefaction of hydrogen, an energy intensive process, is also unpractical because of the boil-off of hydrogen.
The development of a convenient store would allow hydrogen to be more competitive in respect to traditional fuels.10,11 An alternative to gas and liquid storage is the storage of hydrogen as a metal hydride since many hydrides contain more hydrogen per unit volume than liquid hydrogen (Table 1). This alternative proposed by Hofman et al. in 196912,13 generated great interest up to the beginning of the 80s. In particular, Daimler Benz was one of the pioneers to demonstrate the feasibility of hydride vehicles.14–17 The tests were conducted using vehicles running with mixed hydrogen-gasoline reservoirs. The mixed fuel was directly burnt into the combustion engine and the heat released from the exhaust of the vehicle was used to release hydrogen from the metal hydride, i.e. a lave phase hydride on the base of TiMn2. Such vehicles never reached market because of the cost of the metal hydrides, their low hydrogen capacity and weight of the materials used at the time. However, in some cases where weight is not a ‘penalty’ but facilitates the traction or stability of vehicles, such as tractors, forklift and caterpillar engines, some prototypes moved to commercialization. It is also noteworthy that although research in hydrogen storage has only led, so far, to prototype vehicles, metal hydrides have found major application in battery technology.18

Several reviews already summarise progress made in hydrogen storage technology over the last decade with porous materials,11,19–22 metal and complex hydrides.23–30 This review focuses on advances made with magnesium, one of the most promising candidates for hydrogen storage on-board vehicles. Special emphasis is given to the fundamental knowledge gained since the 70s and a critical assessment of this knowledge is reviewed in order to promote major scientific breakthroughs needed for the practical use of magnesium as a hydrogen store. In particular, the promise of nanoscience in unlocking the potential of magnesium as a functional hydrogen store is discussed, i.e. how suitable nano-scale tuning could be to address the high temperature for hydrogen release and the slow kinetics of hydrogen absorption/desorption.
2. Hydrogen for transportation
2.1 Principles and requirements for hydrogen storage in materials
Many metals and alloys are capable of reversibly absorbing hydrogen via direct reaction of the metal with hydrogen gas or by electrochemical charging.11,18 The thermodynamic conditions under which a metal can store hydrogen depend on its plateau pressure or equilibrium pressure (Peq) as determined by pressure composition isotherm (PCI) measurements (Fig. 1a).31 Under a certain hydrogen pressure, the host metal initially dissolves some hydrogen as a solid solution (α phase) and as the hydrogen concentration increases and the pressure rises the metal hydride phase (β phase) nucleates and grows. While the two phases coexist, a plateau is observed, the length of which determines the reversible hydrogen capacity of the metal. Thus, by applying a pressure above the plateau pressure at a given temperature, hydrogen can be stored within the metal (hydriding reaction). Below the plateau pressure the β phase is unstable and hydrogen can be released from the metal (dehydriding reaction). The plateau pressure depends strongly on the temperature and the two phase region ends at a critical temperature (Tc) after which the transition from α to β is continuous. The plateau pressure is related to the changes in enthalpy and entropy according to the van't Hoff equation (Fig. 1b). Since the entropy, corresponding to the transition of hydrogen gas molecules to chemisorbed hydrogen in the metal, is very similar for most metal-hydrogen systems (130 kJ mol−1 K−1),11 the thermodynamic properties of metal-hydrogen systems are usually characterised by the strength of the metal-hydrogen bond and thus the enthalpy of the (de)hydriding reaction. For the practical utilisation of hydrogen storage materials in vehicles, the metal-hydrogen bond strength should correspond to an enthalpy of around 30 kJ mol−1 H2.11,23,32

Above the critical temperature, Tc, the two phase region (α + β) disappears and hydrogen exists only as a solution in metals. The slope of the van't Hoff plot is related to the enthalpy of the reaction and the intercept with the ordinate corresponds to the entropy of the reaction according to the van't Hoff relation: . 
To be competitive, hydrogen-powered vehicles should meet performances and cost levels of vehicles currently powered with gasoline.8,9 Hence, depending on the type of combustion, i.e. via a fuel cell or direct, 5 to 13 kg respectively of hydrogen has to be stored on board a vehicle to allow a driving range of 300 miles (480 km) without refuelling. Estimations made by the US Department of Energy show that to achieve this aim, only hydrogen storage materials meeting a range of requirements summarised in Table 2 would have a chance to penetrate the automotive market.8,11 Meeting all these requirements at the same time has proven to be difficult. In particular, reaching the reversible gravimetric target of 6 mass % within the required range of temperatures and pressures remains a scientific challenge. The ideal storage material should have a plateau pressure of few bar (3–8 bar) near 80 °C to ensure a suitable feed for the fuel cell. Most of the materials showing such a plateau pressure near room temperature only accommodate small amounts of hydrogen (up to 2 mass %),30,33 and since the discovery of hydrogen (de)absorption near room temperature by intermetallics in the 70s, metals or alloys capable of reversibly storing a large amount of hydrogen under moderate conditions of temperatures and pressures have not been found. Of course, there are other materials based on light alkaline and earth-alkaline metals, such as LiH,31 Li3Be2H7,34 LiAlH4,35,36 LiBH4,37 and BaReH9,38 that can store a significant amount of hydrogen, but these materials bind hydrogen too strongly with energies in excess of 60–100 kJ mol−1 H2. Accordingly, high temperatures are required to increase the plateau pressure and release hydrogen from these hydride materials.

Reactions kinetics is another issue to be addressed in order to meet the practical requirements of refuelling time and delivery of hydrogen to the fuel cell for adequate performance. The reaction of hydrogen with metals involves solid-gas reactions and thus multiple energy barriers limit the rate of the (de)hydriding reaction. For example, it is generally considered that the hydriding reaction has to go through different limiting stages including the dissociation of hydrogen molecules, the penetration of hydrogen ions/atoms within the metal particle, the nucleation of the β phase, and finally the diffusion of hydrogen through the hydride layer that has formed around the particle.32 Efforts over the past years to overcome kinetic limitations have been quite successful in particular for metal hydrides for which nanostructures and surface catalysis have led to a significant improvement of (de)hydriding kinetics.34,39,40
Finally, from an engineering point of view, the heat management around the hydride tank is also problematic. In particular, since the reaction of hydrogen with many metal hydrides, e.g. MgH2 and LaNi5H6, is exothermic, depending on the refuelling time and the material used, approximately 0.5–1 MW of heat would need to be removed from the storage tank during recharging of hydrogen on-board the vehicle.9 Feeding the fuel cell with hydrogen would probably be less difficult if the heat generated from the fuel cell is re-used to overcome the endothermic energy required to release hydrogen from the hydride material. In such a configuration, a back-up hydrogen reservoir would be required for a cold start of the fuel cell.
2.2 Progress made toward functional hydride materials
First investigations on hydrogen storage materials mainly focused on the development of intermetallics following the discovery of hydrogen absorption in LaNi5 at Philips41 and FeTi at the Brookhaven National Laboratory42 in the early 70s. It was then realised that the properties of hydride materials could be tailored by varying the composition of the different metallic components of the alloys.7,42,43 However, at the time, research efforts failed to deliver a material suitable for automobile applications.44,45 Despite progress made to meet the targets of pressure and temperature requirements, the major drawback of the various intermetallics developed remains their low hydrogen capacity (<2 mass %) and weight penalty.
It would be easier to meet the gravimetric target if only hydrides based on light elements constituting the first two rows of the periodic table are considered, i.e. Li, Be, B, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si and/or P. For toxicity reasons hydrides of Be, Si and P are not desirable, but compounds based on Si and P are possible candidates. Of those elements, only Li, Na, C, Mg and Al form stables compounds with hydrogen at room temperature and have sufficient hydrogen content (>7 mass %). However, the plateau pressure of LiH and NaH are too low (Peq ≪ 1 bar at RT) for practical applications,46 ammonia and methane are not plausible reversible stores, and AlH3 requires very high pressures for reversibility.47 As a consequence, only Mg would be suitable for hydrogen storage on-board vehicles if the sluggish hydrogen kinetics and the high temperature necessary to release hydrogen from Mg (i.e. 400 °C) could be managed in order to meet practical requirements.
Compounds based on the [AlH4]− anion are also potential light candidates for hydrogen storage. However, investigations on such compounds were rather limited until Bogdanovic and Schwickardi in 1997 demonstrated the reversible storage of hydrogen in NaAlH4 through titanium doping.48 Achieving reversibility with complex hydrides is to a certain extent more complicated in comparison to metal hydrides because the (de)hydriding reaction includes several intermediate steps, side reactions that may limit the practical hydrogen capacity of the materials, and slow hydrogen kinetics due to mass transport.36,49,50 This is particularly the case with NaAlH4 which has been the focus of intense investigations. Despite a theoretical capacity of 5.5 mass % and suitable operating temperatures and pressures, NaAlH4 was revealed to be an inconvenient hydrogen store. In practice, only 3–4 mass % of hydrogen can be reversibly stored, the hydrogen kinetics are too slow for vehicular applications and the packing density is too low to allow sufficient volumetric capacity (NaAlH4 packing density in the hydride tank is 50% of its theoretical crystal density).8
In recent years, several other compounds based on NHx (x = 1, 2 or 3) and the [BH4]− anion have also shown a certain degree of reversibility within a relatively accessible range of pressures and temperatures. For example, the reaction of LiNH2 with MgH2 has demonstrated reversibility and suitable thermodynamic properties for hydrogen storage on-board vehicles.51 LiBH4 has also shown reversibility when destabilised with MgH2.52 However, to date, these hydrogen storage systems remain the focus of fundamental studies since reversibility occurs with slow hydrogen kinetics and at high temperatures and/or pressures.
Another strategy to store high amounts of hydrogen on-board vehicles is to accept a non-reversible solution, such as producing hydrogen through hydrolysis of high capacity hydrides with off board regeneration. This strategy investigated as early as 1976, has been particularly successful with NaBH4 because it is one of the rare complex hydrides for which the hydrolysis reaction can be directly controlled in water and ‘on demand’ via pH modification and the use of catalysts based on Rh or Ru.53 However, the hydrolysis strategy is not so interesting with other complex hydrides which necessitate carrying a water tank on-board the vehicle. The efficiency and cost of the off-board regeneration is also a critical issue for the successful application of such systems as well as the infrastructure implications related to the need for exchangeable fuel cartridges. Today, if a hydride vehicle has to reach markets, it would probably contain the mature technology of compressed hydrogen at 700 bar since it is currently the best option available to the automotive industry.9
3. Magnesium as a hydrogen store
Taking into account the hydrogen storage landscape as described above, magnesium remains a very interesting option since it meets four of the practical targets, i.e. (i) high volumetric capacity, (ii) high gravimetric capacity, (iii) it is in abundance (around 2.5% of earth's surface compositions, and virtually in unlimited amount in sea water)54 and, (iv) it is non toxic. Furthermore, the use of magnesium is relatively safe in comparison to alkaline metals which react violently under oxidizing condition.55 The production of magnesium is also a well-established industry, and thus raw cost of magnesium is acceptable.54,56 Magnesium is usually produced from sea-water and magnesium bearing materials (dolomite, magnesite, etc.) by electrochemical process.56 Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is obtained either by the reaction of magnesium with hydrogen at temperatures ∼500 °C or by organometallic routes.57,58 Traditionally, MgH2 is widely used in chemical synthesis as a hydride source and reducing agent for the preparation of Grignard reagents for example.57
3.1 The properties of the magnesium-hydrogen system
Magnesium exhibits a h.c.p. α-structure which converts upon hydriding into a rutile structure, i.e. tetragonal β-MgH2 (P42/mmc).59 The latter phase transforms into the metastable orthorhombic phase γ-MgH2 under a few GPa stress and reverts back to the tetragonal phase at temperatures above 300 °C.60,61 Under further compression other metastable high-pressure phases have also been reported.62 Furthermore, like alkaline hydrides, all MgH2 phases are ionic and the Mg–H bond shows the following charge distribution: Mg1.91+H−0.26.63

3.1.1 Thermodynamics. 
The thermodynamic properties of MgH2 have been reviewed by Bogdanovic et al.64 Values of enthalpies in between 85 and 70.1 kJ mol−1 H2, and values of entropy ranging from 146 to 126 J K−1mol−1 H2, were at first reported for the dehydriding reaction of MgH2. However, recent assessments of the phase-diagram of Mg–H as well as theoretical calculations indicate a value of enthalpy of 74.7 kJ mol−1 H2 and a value of entropy of 130 J K−1mol−1 H2, which are commonly accepted as a reference.65 The discrepancies among the different values reported in the literature are mainly due to various factors affecting the experimental measurements, e.g. the characterisation techniques used (calorimetric, Sievert, thermogravimetric), the quality and properties of the magnesium powder used (surface state, particle size), and the accuracy of data (for instance those obtained relatively far from the equilibrium).
Obviously, the large enthalpy value reflects the high stability of MgH2. The plateau pressure of Mg/MgH2 is very low at room temperature and subsequently,66 temperatures above 300 °C are needed to release hydrogen from MgH2 under standard conditions of pressure. For instance, a Peq of 16 bar is needed at 403 °C (Fig. 2).64–66 Furthermore, due to the high enthalpy of the magnesium/hydrogen reaction, a lot of heat is released during hydrogen absorption in magnesium and vice versa. The management of this heat can seriously affect the (de)hydriding behaviour of magnesium. For example, if the excess of heat resulting from absorption process is not properly removed, the equilibrium pressure will increase, the thermodynamic force driving the hydriding reaction will be reduced, and thus the hydride will only be partially decomposed. The addition of a material of high thermal conductivity such as Cu to the magnesium has proven to facilitate heat management.67,68

3.1.2 Kinetic barriers. 
Magnesium suffers from very slow hydriding and dehydriding reactions and several hours are required to achieve full hydriding and dehydriding on bulk magnesium.69–71 The cause of such sluggish kinetics have not been completely clarified but it is widely accepted that the following would hinder reactions: (a) the oxide layer covering the surface of magnesium particles,32,72,73 (b) the poor dissociation rate of hydrogen at the magnesium surface,32 and (c) the slow diffusion rate of hydrogen in magnesium and magnesium hydride.74,75
The absorption/desorption of hydrogen in magnesium is a heterogeneous solid-gas reaction involving different energy barriers that can slow down kinetics (Fig. 3). As hydrogen molecules from the gas phase physisorb at the magnesium surface, they will have to dissociate and chemisorb before entering the subsurface and then diffuse through magnesium bulk. The physisorption of hydrogen is not restraining kinetics because the activation energy involved is low, i.e. 1–10 kJ mol−1 H2.76,77 However, the large energy needed to split hydrogen molecules at the magnesium surface, i.e. 432 kJ mol−1 H2, limits the chemisorption of hydrogen.77,78 In comparison to transition metals such as Ni79 or Pd,80 known for their hydrogenation properties, magnesium does not exhibit d-orbitals that can interact with the hydrogen antibonding orbital and thus facilitate the dissociation of molecular hydrogen.81,82 The oxide/hydroxide layer formed at the surface of magnesium particles, even under ultra-clean conditions,73,83 will also hinder hydrogen dissociation and posterior hydrogen atom diffusion.84,85 Hence, the dissociation of hydrogen molecules at the surface of magnesium will eventually be favoured along cracks of the oxide layer at surface sites presenting defects,86 and at more reactive surface planes.87 Accordingly, the activation energy for hydrogen chemisorption will strongly depend on the state of surface. Once hydrogen has chemisorbed to the surface, it will diffuse into the bulk forming a solution into magnesium, until the nucleation and growth of the hydride phase occurs.39,88

Ephys: energy for hydrogen physisorption, Echem: energy for hydrogen chemisorption, Epen: energy for hydrogen penetration in the subsurface, Edif: energy for hydrogen diffusion in the bulk, and EN–G: energy for the nucleation and growth of the hydride phase. 
The process of nucleation and growth strongly depends on the temperature and pressure. At high pressures (P ≫ Peq) and temperatures (Fig. 1c), the fast nucleation of the hydride phase near the surface prevents further hydriding of the particle core because of the low diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in magnesium hydride (1.5 × 10−16 m2 s−1).74,89 This “shell effect” has clearly been observed with large particles (>50 μm) of magnesium which are partially hydrided under such conditions of pressures and temperatures.32 However, at low pressures and temperatures (Fig. 1d), the nucleation of the hydride phase occurs inside the particle and no “shell effect” is observed. In this case, the reaction is limited by the slow diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in magnesium (4 × 10−13 m2 s−1).90 Conversely, the hydrogen desorption process from magnesium hydride is asymmetric to the absorption mechanism. For instance, during hydrogen desorption the nucleation is not instantaneous because of the low pressures generally used under normal experimental conditions.

3.2 Progress achieved to date

3.2.1 Thermodynamic improvements. 
Over the years various metals including rare earth (e.g. Ce, La), non-transition (e.g. Al, Li, In) and transition metals (e.g. Ni, Co, Fe, Cu, Ag, Sc, Y) forming less stable hydrides that MgH2 have been alloyed with magnesium in order to reduce the thermodynamic stability of its hydride.91–94 The strategy, similar to that used for AB5, AB2, and AB hydrides, was to find the right alloying combination in between magnesium and a non-stable hydride to sufficiently destabilise the Mg–H bond strength. The archetypical system is given by the Mg–Ni phase diagram which exhibits a Mg2Ni phase that absorbs hydrogen forming Mg2NiH4 but with a lower hydrogen content of 3.6 mass %.24,91,92,95 Mg2NiH4 is somewhat less stable than MgH2 (Table 3) and further attempts to decrease the stability of Mg2NiH4 by the partial substitution of Mg or Ni with other elements were unsuccessful.91,93 Furthermore, modification of magnesium with other transition metals such a Fe has also led to ternary hydride, i.e. Mg2FeH6, showing values of enthalpy relatively similar to that of MgH2 (Table 3).93 Over the large number of magnesium alloys screened, no candidate meeting the requirement for practical hydrogen storage was uncovered. To solve the problem of hydrogen capacity reduction, it has been recently proposed to destabilise MgH2 with light elements such as Si or with complex hydrides such as LiBH4 (Table 3).96–98 Although from a thermodynamic point of view such hydrides are optimised, they still suffer from slow ionic mobility and thus poor kinetics.97,99

In order to overcome thermodynamic limitations, the formation of metastable phases has also been considered. For instance, the metastable γ-MgH2 phase is of lower stability compared to β-MgH2 (by 15 kJ mol−1 H2). However, this phase is unstable at the temperatures needed to release hydrogen, i.e. temperatures higher than 200 °C.61 Metastable phases of magnesium binary and ternary hydrides are under current investigation,100–102 but to date, most of these hydrides exhibit kinetic problems and a significant reduction of hydrogen capacity.
In theory, modifications of the bulk structure could also help to reduce the enthalpy of the reaction of hydrogen with magnesium. In particular, the formation of a nanocrystalline structure and the resulting large number of grain boundaries are known to provide an excess of enthalpy in the grain boundaries that could help to destabilise the metal hydrogen bond.103,104 For instance, a reduction of more than 30% in enthalpy values for MgH2 nano-crystals smaller than 5 nm has been predicted.105 However, at present, the expected diminution of the enthalpy has not been observed because of the rapid recrystallisation of nanocrystalline magnesium hydride at moderate temperatures.106 The thermodynamic properties of nanocrystalline magnesium remain unchanged compared to that of polycrystalline magnesium.40,107 Similarly, attempts of enthalpy reduction through the generation of vacancies108 generally failed because of the difficulty of stabilising such vacancies during hydrogen cycling at moderate temperatures.109


3.2.2 Kinetic improvements. 
The slow absorption/desorption kinetics of hydrogen in magnesium is another drawback when considering magnesium for the practical storage of hydrogen. In principle, controlling the steps limiting hydrogen kinetics would help solve the problem. However, attempts to identify remaining rate limiting steps, i.e. surface, diffusion or nucleation and growth controlled, from hydrogen kinetic data by the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami equations have not been fully conclusive because of the diversity of experimental conditions used.110,111 Differences in particle sizes, initial state of the sample, pressure and temperature conditions have led to serious discrepancies.

Table 4 summarises some of the main findings regarding the rate limiting step of the hydrogen absorption/desorption in polycrystalline magnesium. There is a general trend indicating that both hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics in magnesium are controlled by a nucleation and growth process as the reaction progresses. However, absorption is likely to be controlled by a fast nucleation followed by a two dimensional diffusion controlled growth of the hydride phase, whereas desorption may begin with an instantaneous nucleation followed by an interface controlled process in between the Mg and MgH2 phase. These differences are further supported by the distinctive activation energies of the reactions, since values of 160–200 and 200–240 kJ mol−1 H2 have been reported for the absorption and desorption of hydrogen in magnesium, respectively.112,113

Among the various strategies used to reduce the activation energy of the hydrogen absorption/desorption process in magnesium, the finding of methods to produce nanocrystalline metal hydrides has drastically facilitated the optimisation of hydrogen (ab)desorption kinetics in magnesium.114–116 By carefully controlling the milling conditions, Schulz et al. were one of the first group to successfully produce nanocrystalline magnesium by high-energy ball milling.114 The production of nanostructures is facilitated if the material to be milled is brittle. Accordingly, most current preparation methods use MgH2 instead of magnesium which is ductile and thus difficult to mill.
Nanocrystalline magnesium shows very fast hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics without the need of activation compared to conventional bulk magnesium. Hence, nanocrystalline magnesium is fully hydrided in less than 6.5 min at 300 °C, and desorption is achieved in 1 h at 300 °C. In contrast, it takes more than 30 min to store 3 mass % of hydrogen within polycrystalline magnesium and hydrogen desorption hardly occurs at 300 °C.117,118 This improvement in hydrogen kinetics is clearly revealed by the reduction of activation energies, since a reduction of 40–60 kJ mol−1 H2 in activation energies has been reported.39,119
During mechanical milling the particle size is reduced, the specific surface of the material increases by 10 fold,107,120,121 and new surfaces quasi free from an oxide layer are produced. These, as well as the defects introduced within the surface of magnesium particles during the milling process, promote fast hydrogen kinetics, i.e. facilitate surface dissociation and hydrogen diffusion because of shorter diffusion paths.118,122 Besides, the crystalline structure of magnesium undergoes major modifications upon mechanical milling. The crystallite size typically decreases from few μm to few nm,107,115,121 and the metastable high pressure γ-MgH2 phase is formed during milling.60,118,120 The latter reverts back to β-MgH2 during the first hydriding/dehydriding cycle.107 The formation of nanocrystalline domains and the resulting high density of grain boundaries facilitate to some extent hydrogen diffusion and the overall kinetics,115,116 though the material undergoes significant recrystallisation upon heating during hydrogen loading and unloading. Typically the crystallite size increases from 8 to 163 nm during the first hydrogen absorption/desorption cycle without significant modification of hydrogen kinetics.106 Similarly, defects within the crystalline structure resulting from the milling are annealed upon cycling.123,124 Thus, it is more likely that the improved performances of nanocrystalline magnesium are due to particle size reduction and more reactive surfaces rather than stresses, defects and smaller grain size resulting from high energy ball milling.107,119,122,124,125 Furthermore, the rate limiting step of the hydrogen adsorption/desorption in nanocrystalline magnesium have been reported to be similar to that of polycrystalline magnesium (Table 4), i.e. the reaction is still controlled by a nucleation and growth process.40,126–128
3.2.2.a Catalytic effect of additives. 
Further kinetic improvements and reduction in activation energies were obtained by the addition of Pd,129,130 nitrides, carbides,131 tetrahydrofuran,132 fluorines,133 or carbon134–138 but the most impressive results were obtained with transition metal catalysts such as Nb, V and their respective oxides (Table 5).40,128,131,139–147 For example, hydrogen desorption/absorption kinetics below 5 min at 300 °C could be achieved with Nb or Nb2O5 addition.127,148–150 The exact role of these transition metals on the overall hydrogen kinetics of magnesium remains unclear but it is believed that transition metals such as Nb and V act as hydrogen pumps, facilitating both hydrogen absorption and desorption. X-Ray scattering using synchrotron radiation and neutron diffraction measurements support such a hypothesis because the formation of niobium hydride phase has been observed during hydrogen absorption/desorption.151,152

The role of transition metal oxide is also subject to debate.107,141 For instance, the proposed superior catalytic effect of Nb2O5 in comparison to pure Nb is still a matter of discussion. According to recent theoretical calculations, oxygen vacancies at metal oxide surface could facilitate the destabilisation of MgH2, whereas the pure metallic phase would accelerate the dissociation of hydrogen at the surface of magnesium.153 However, on thin film experiments, niobium oxides were reported to enhance hydrogen absorption kinetics in magnesium.154 In fact, addition of Nb or Nb2O5 is likely to lead to the same type of catalyst, i.e. a mixture of MgNb and MgNbxOy phases, since traces of oxidant cannot be avoided and Nb2O5 is partially reduced by magnesium during the first absorption/desorption cycle.106,155,156
3.2.2.b Mechanical effect of additives. 
Further improvement of the hydrogen kinetics of nanocrystalline magnesium can also be obtained without catalyst additions. For instance, the addition of diamond powder to MgH2 prior to milling drastically decreases the milling time required to reach fast kinetics from 5 days to 15 h on a planetary mill, and leads to kinetics similar to that of magnesium modified with the best catalyst currently available (Fig. 4).107,157 Similarly, the addition of 10 mass % of MgO to MgH2 prior to milling leads to a material with improved hydrogen kinetics. Hence, full hydrogen absorption/desorption could be carried out in less than 3 min at 300 °C and 15 min at 250 °C.122 Such a drastic improvement without any catalytic assistance is due to a significant and efficient particle size reduction. During the milling process, diamond and MgO powder are believed to act as process control agents facilitating particle size reduction and limiting self-agglomeration.107,122 Furthermore, the addition of transition metal oxides to MgH2 prior to milling has been shown to facilitate particle size reduction during the milling process.107,158 Accordingly, transition metal oxides may help in the refinement of MgH2 powder during milling and further catalyse the hydriding/dehydriding reaction during hydrogen cycling.

3.3 A critical overview
The reaction of hydrogen with materials forming hydrides involves multi-step solid-gas reactions. In addition to the thermodynamic barrier, successive kinetic energy barriers have to be considered for practical application.45,105,159 This has proven to be very challenging especially when the most promising storage materials are the ones binding hydrogen too strongly. Attempts to lower thermodynamic barriers by alloying methods have usually failed due to a limited decrease of dehydriding temperature, important reductions of hydrogen storage capacity, and/or irreversibility of the intermediate states resulting from the destabilisation. More success was achieved with respect to kinetics through catalyst addition or size reduction. Furthermore, thermodynamic and kinetics have often been treated separately, when both should be considered at the same time. Present thermodynamic approaches of alloying/destabilisation and kinetic improvements through catalytic addition are proving their limits. The combination of combinatorial methods and modelling could lead to further breakthroughs. However, different approaches taking into account the entire properties of materials to meet thermodynamic and kinetic targets at the same time should be envisaged. Progress achieved with high energy ball milling clearly point to ‘size restriction’ as a potential path toward practical magnesium stores. Smaller particles obtained through ball milling exhibit faster hydrogen kinetics,119,122,124,157 but stabilisation of small grain sizes and potential thermodynamic improvements are out of reach because of the rapid recrystallisation of magnesium upon heating.105–107 In this respect, the idea of ‘nano-tuning’, i.e. decreasing the particle size of hydride materials to the nanoscale in order to assert molecular control over the thermodynamic and kinetic properties, could offer a suitable path to deliver functional materials for hydrogen storage purposes. The implementation of such an approach would require developing suitable methods for the synthesis and stabilisation of nanosized hydride materials, but also prerequisite fundamental knowledge to the efficient tuning of hydride properties at the nanoscale. Strategies to this aim and predictable size effects on metal hydride properties are further discussed below.
4. Tuning the properties of magnesium at the nanoscale. A possible path toward functionality
4.1 The potential of a nano approach in reaching molecular control
Materials at the nanoscale exhibit fascinating new features as compared to their bulk counterparts.160 In particular, it is well known that the reduction of size leads to a diminution of melting point,161 change of specific heat,162 increase of phase diagram solubility.163 In principle, all these could benefit the overall thermodynamics and hydrogen kinetics of metal hydrides and facilitate their practical utilisation as hydrogen stores.

4.1.1 Thermodynamics of magnesium at the nanoscale. 
Nanomaterials are characterised by high surface to volume ratios. Therefore, the contribution of the surface free energy to the total energy of the system is not negligible anymore. The Gibbs energy is defined by the equation: G = G(T,P,ni) = H(T,P,ni) − TS(T,P,ni)(1)
Considering the desorption reaction of hydrogen, i.e. MgH2 → Mg + H2, the Gibbs energy related to this reaction is equal to: ΔGr = ∑Gproducts − ∑Greactants(2)
By using (1) and (2), the Gibbs energy of the dehydriding reaction is given by: (3)
Taking into account the standard values of enthalpy and entropy and neglecting ΔCp (Mg and MgH2 values of few J K−1 mol−1 at 298 K),64,164,165eqn (3) can be written: (4)
Furthermore, if the particle is sufficiently small, the increase in surface area will result in a low mean coordination number of surface atoms and thus an excess surface energy. Accordingly, the surface energy term (ΔWsurf) given by relation (5) and corresponding to the energy needed to create a new surface (Fig. 5) has to be considered. (5)with corresponding to the surface energy density, and A the surface area.
 Fig. 5  Energy involved in the creation of a novel surface. 
For a spherical particle of a radius r and molar volume V, ΔWsurf can also be expressed as: (6)
Taking into account this surface energy term, a new van't Hoff relation can be determined from the Clausius–Clapeyron equation (7) that relates nanoparticle size to equilibrium pressure or plateau pressure (Peq). (7)
Since the equilibrium condition corresponds to ΔG = 0, the following equation can be derived from relation (4) for bulk metal hydrides: (8)and by substituting (7) into (8), the van't Hoff equation extended to nanosized metal hydrides is given by: (9)
In the particular case of hydrogen desorption from MgH2, this relation can be expressed as: (10)
Hence, from (10) it can be concluded that bulk MgH2 is destabilised when the contribution related to size becomes negative enough, i.e. the surface energy densities of MgH2 is significantly larger than that of magnesium. Since γ is a function of the surface crystallographic plane and depends on the number of hydrogen bonds to be broken per surface unit to generate the magnesium surface,166 a significant decrease of enthalpy is expected for MgH2 surface plans showing a high coordination number of surface hydrogen. For instance, MgH2 particles with a surface plan (110) are predicted to have a reduced desorption enthalpy compared to particles with a surface plan (001) (Fig. 6)
 Fig. 6  (a) MgH2 (110) surface plan with surface energy 1.3 J m−2 and (b) MgH2 (001) surface plan with a surface energy of 0.48 J m−2.169,170 Blue and red circles represent magnesium and hydrogen atoms, respectively. The dashed atoms correspond to the magnesium and hydrogen atoms at the surface. 
Previous values of surface energy densities of 0.5–0.6 J m−2 have been reported for the Mg(0001) surface, which correspond to the energetically more favourable surface.164,165,167,168 Values of surface energy density for MgH2 surfaces are more inconsistent.169,170 However, most reported values are found between 0.5 and 1.95 J m−2, depending on the orientation of the MgH2 surface.170 As a consequence, the surface contribution (ΔWsurf) to enthalpy of hydrogen desorption from magnesium may range in between positive or negative values. This is highlighted in Fig. 7 which shows the evolution of MgH2 decomposition enthalpy as a function of the particle radius and surface energy density. From Fig. 7, it is noteworthy that a reduction of MgH2 particle size does not necessarily imply a reduction of enthalpy and thus a decrease in hydrogen desorption temperature. For instance, planes such as MgH2 (111) lead to an increased stability of MgH2 when particle size is decreased. However, when considering an average of surface energy densities of different planes, a decrease of enthalpy is predicted for particle sizes below 5 nm. Furthermore, the effect of surface defects such as vacancies and stacking faults on surface energies should be negligible since their contribution is in the order of few mJ m−2.168,171
 Fig. 7  Influence of MgH2 particle size on the hydrogen desorption enthalpy from magnesium (ΔHdesorption) according to the surface energy of the magnesium plan (111) and (200). The curves were calculated according to relation (10). The magnesium plan (0001), i.e. the most stable surface, and the MgH2 plans (111) and (200) were considered for the calculations. The average of the effect of both plans still result in a destabilisation of MgH2 through size effects. The enthalpy for hydrogen desorption from bulk MgH2 is 76 kJ mol−1 H2. 
Theoretical modelling also predicts a considerable reduction of enthalpy for particle sizes below 2 nm.171–173 Moreover, size restriction of magnesium particles would also impact other thermodynamic parameters of metal hydrides. For example, higher hydrogen solubility and a plateau pressure showing a slope have been reported for clusters of palladium.163,174,175


4.1.2 Reaction kinetics of hydrogen and magnesium at the nanoscale. 
The reduction of diffusion distances should drastically enhance hydrogen kinetics. Considering a diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in MgH2 of 1.5 × 10−16 m2 s−1,74,75 hydrogen will diffuse into a whole hydride particle of 10 nm in diameter in less than 1 s. Hydrogen diffusion will be even faster into a magnesium nanoparticle because of the higher diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in magnesium, i.e. 4 × 10−13 m2 s−1.90 Furthermore, limitations related to the nucleation and growth process should be restricted in nanosized magnesium because hydrogen solubility is higher,174 and only small activation energies should be involved in nucleation processes at the nanoscale.163 In fact, it is more likely that the overall hydrogen kinetics will be controlled by the ability of the nanoparticle surface to split and recombine hydrogen molecules. Hydrogen is known to have a low sticking and dissociation probability at magnesium surfaces.32,76,77 The activation barrier required to dissociate hydrogen molecules strongly depends on absorption sites. For instance, on Mg (0001) plane the activation energy for the dissociation of hydrogen can varying from 0.8 eV on bridge sites (Fig. 8a) to 1.6 eV on top sites (Fig. 8b).176,177 Recent ab initio calculations have also suggested even lower dissociation energies in other absorption sites (Fig. 8c).178 Similarly, the recombination of hydrogen atoms at the surface of magnesium hydride particles will depend on the geometry of the surface plan involved.169 Furthermore, a low oxidation state of the surface should be effectively controlled for long lasting hydrogen absorption/desorption cycles.

4.2 Synthesis of nanosized metals and metal hydrides
The development of novel synthetic methods for the preparation and stabilisation of nanosized metal hydrides is key to the success of a ‘nano-tuning’ approach. However, this could be a challenging task because of the high reactivity of the metals of interest for hydrogen storage purposes. Nonetheless, with the rapid growth of nanotechnologies over the last decade several strategies are available to the development of innovative routes for the synthesis of nanomaterials for hydrogen storage purposes.
The synthesis of nanosized hydride particles can be achieved through a top-down approach (divide the matter repeatedly until the required size is reached) or a bottom-up approach (assemble atoms to form complex nanostructures). Traditionally, in the field of hydrogen storage, top-down approaches have been utilised in an attempt to facilitate hydrogen kinetics and possibly destabilise metal hydrides. In particular, the technique of mechanical milling has attracted a lot of attention due to the relative simplicity of the process in producing nanostructured materials and alloys of increased surface area.179 However, mechanical milling is a very restrictive technique because of the difficulty of accurately controlling the milling process and thus the quality of the final product.180–182 In best cases, particle sizes >100 nm are produced with agglomeration, impurities, and very inhomogeneous size distributions ranging from the nanometre to the micrometre scale.107,119,122,183,184 Furthermore, the nanostructure formed during the milling process is not sufficient to guarantee fast kinetics and nanocrystalline domains small enough to induce a thermodynamic destabilisation of metal hydrides.105,106 It is unlikely to reach small sizes of a few nm through nanostructuring without recrystallisation problems.105 Ideally, isolated small and stabilised particles should be generated to decrease enthalpy through size effects.185 Since the surface energy density is size dependant,186 the enthalpy of hydrogen desorption from magnesium will be size and structure dependant.
An alternative to mechanical milling is to use a bottom-up approach, such as gas phase condensation, scaffold methods or self-assembly techniques. Several gas phase processes, including chemical vapour deposition and plasma, have been successfully used to produce various nano-metallic objects for hydrogen storage purposes.83,187–191 However, the natural aggregation of individual clusters usually leads to the formation of large entities with sizes >50 nm. For instance, Shao et al. successfully prepared nanoparticles of magnesium by plasma-metal reaction but the size of magnesium particles obtained is relatively large (>200 nm).189 Smaller magnesium particles with an average size of 40 nm were prepared by Kooi et al. by gas-phase synthesis but the yield of such a synthetic method is relatively low.83 Obviously, metallic nanoparticles prepared by gas-phase condensation are highly prone to oxidation. Furthermore, such nanoparticles are not stabilised and thus subject to agglomeration and sintering.188,189
Agglomeration and sintering can be reduced by confining the nanoparticles within a scaffold.192–195 For hydrogen storage purposes, the scaffold must be light and inert toward the metal to be hosted. Accordingly, only porous carbons have been used for this purpose. The confinement of the metallic nanoparticles is done either by melt infiltration or by impregnation method with an appropriate metallic precursor. For instance, Zhang et al. used dibutylmagnesium as a precursor and successfully incorporated 15 mass % of MgH2 within carbon aerogels.192 The main limitation of such an approach is the significant decrease in hydrogen storage capacity due to the mass of scaffold host. Furthermore, the use of porous scaffold with a 3 dimensional porosity may significantly reduce hydrogen diffusion within the metal/scaffold array.
Various techniques developed over the past years in colloidal science to prepare and stabilise nanoparticles of transition metals, semiconducting and inorganic materials could also facilitate the synthesis of nanomaterials for hydrogen storage purposes through a bottom-up approach. In colloidal science, nanoparticles are usually prepared by: (i) metal salt reduction, (ii) thermal decomposition and photochemical methods, or (iii) ligand reduction and displacement from organometallics.196–198 One of the main advantages of this approach is that the synthesis usually occurs in liquid media and thus stabilised nanoparticles of controlled size and shape can be prepared by varying the experimental conditions such as temperature and concentration of the reagents and stabiliser.196,199 The nanoparticles obtained are only kinetically stable and must be stabilised against agglomeration. This is usually achieved through electrostatic and/or steric stabilisation (Fig. 9).198 Electrostatic stabilisation occurs by the adsorption of ions onto the electrophilic metal surface and through coulombic repulsion between individual particles, whereas steric repulsion is achieved by surrounding the metallic particle with an organic layer preventing close contact in between individual metallic particles. Following similar principles, we reported the first synthesis of colloidal magnesium with nanoparticles as small as 5 nm (Fig. 10).185 Hass and Gedanken also successfully synthesized 5 nm nanoparticles of magnesium through the sonoelectrochemical reduction of Grignard compounds.200 Furthermore, by using digestive ripening, Kalidindi and Jagirda reported the synthesis of colloidal magnesium particles of 3 nm diameter in gram scale quantities.201 Colloidal magnesium is found to be stable with respect to self-agglomeration and oxidation under an inert atmosphere.185,201
 Fig. 9  Possible stabilisation strategies of nanoparticles through: (a) electrostatic repulsion, and (b) steric repulsion. 
 Fig. 10  Colloidal magnesium nanoparticles obtained by electrochemical reduction of magnesium acetate. The average particle diameter is 5 nm. 
Of all the approaches described above, colloidal synthetic methods offer the most suitable route for tuning hydride properties through size restriction. Via the colloidal approach, not only can stabilised nano-hydride particles be synthesised, but their agglomeration is also restrained, and their physical properties, i.e. size, shape, and surface reactivity can be adjusted. The capping stabiliser acts as a passivative protective layer and also controls the shape of nanoparticles and thus their thermodynamics.196,199,202 The thermodynamic properties of nanoparticles are known to depend on their size and their shape.199,202Au nanoparticles are classical examples.160,202 Accordingly, appropriate selection of capping ligands binding more or less strongly at the surface of the hydride core would offer additional finetuning of the metal hydrogen bond strength as well as surface reactivity. Besides, having colloidal hydrides would facilitate investigations of fundamental processes at the nanoscale upon size restriction. Unlike porous scaffolds, the hydride core can be reached by a variety of characterisation probes and if necessary the capping ligand removed, e.g. by heating. Accordingly, colloidal hydrides offer an excellent framework for fundamental investigations. With appropriate design they could potentially lead to an advanced generation of hydrogen storage systems.
4.3 Characterisation of nanosized metals and metal hydrides
The key goals for the characterisation of nanoparticles for hydrogen storage purposes are to determined (i) particle size and shape, (ii) composition and structure, (iii) surface and overall reactivity toward hydrogen, and (v) stability in terms of hydrogen kinetics, capacity and cycling life. Accurate characterisation of the physical and chemical properties of nano-sized hydrides and the interdependency between physical and chemical properties is a challenge. The properties of nanomaterials depend strongly on their size, shape and structure and therefore, if sub-populations of nanoparticles cannot be isolated from a sample, the properties measured for a large quantity of nanomaterials could be an average over all the nanomaterials. Additional complications arise from the difficulty of existing testing and measuring techniques in characterizing the properties of nanomaterials; usually a correlation between several techniques is necessary to obtain a reasonable overall picture of the properties of nanomaterials. Further complications are also due to the air sensitive nature of materials suitable for hydrogen storage purposes.
The technique most widely used for characterisation of the physical properties of nanoparticles is transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which provides direct visual information on the size dispersity, shape, and structure of the nanoparticles.202,203 TEM analysis can also be completed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) characterisation to obtain compositional information. However, the use of TEM has several drawbacks including the possible melting of the small particles due to the heat generated by the electron beam. During examination, nanoparticles may undergo rearrangements, aggregation or decomposition.202 TEM also provides a two dimensional image of a sample of three dimensions which may pose problems in image interpretation. Determining accurately the size of the sample and its dispersity may be difficult and tedious since, depending on the nanoparticle orientation, different crystal planes and, thus, sizes will be obtained. Furthermore only a finite number of nanoparticles, which may not be fully representative of the sample as a whole, is observed. Another limitation is that the sample must be examined under high-vacuum conditions, which does not reflect the properties of the sample as it exists under standard conditions. Despite these limitations, TEM remains a technique of choice for the characterisation of nanoparticles because atomic resolution can be achieved and powerful visual images are obtained.
TEM analysis can be completed by scanning probe microscopic characterisations (scanning tunnelling and atomic force microscopy) in order to determine the total diameter of the nanoparticles including the stabilising ligand shell.204,205 However, such a technique can lead to broadened images of the particles and artefacts because the images obtained depend on the geometry of the tip. More accurate information regarding the size dispersity of nanomaterials is possible by using high pressure liquid chromatography and size exclusion chromatography.206 The advantage of such a technique is that it provides quantitative information concerning size polydispersity of the total population of nanoparticles in a given sample. Furthermore, it allows the separation in mg quantities of sub-populations with different size and shape. Further information on particle dimensions and structural defects can be obtained by extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS).207,208
X-Ray diffraction at high angle is also a very powerful tool for refining the structure of nanoparticles.209–211 Usually, interpretation of the diffraction patterns will require the use of methods such as the Debye function analysis in order to differentiate the diverse structures composing the sample.212,213 The structure of the nanocrystals composing the sample can be determined by quantitative comparison of diffraction patterns of nanocrystals theoretically calculated with the one experimentally observed.
The hydrogen concentration in nanoparticles, stability in terms of kinetics, capacity and cycling life can be difficult to evaluate because of the small quantity of sample generally available. If the amount of materials is sufficient (i.e. few mg), gravimetric techniques can be used to measure hydrogen uptake and release. Gas volumetric method (Sievert's apparatus) is also another method but it would generally require a larger amount of sample (>100 mg) in order to achieve sufficient accuracy. If the local hydrogen concentration is of interest, the use of high resolving techniques such as Rutherford backscattering, neutron diffraction, EXAFS or nuclear magnetic resonance is necessary. Further analysis with H2 and D2 scrambling experiments could also provide information regarding the reactivity of the surface of the nanoparticles as occurs in bulk.214
4.4 Hydrogen storage properties of nanosized metal hydrides. State of the art

4.4.1 Thin films. 
In the beginning of the 80s, hydrogen storage in magnesium thin film emerged as an alternative method to hydrogen storage in bulk hydrides.215–217 The use of a thin film would provide a larger surface area, thus faster hydrogen kinetics and possible improvements in thermodynamics and heat management.216 In particular, a drastic reduction of desorption/absorption temperatures was reported for MgH2 when it is capped as a film in between two Pd layers.80 Such a film could absorb and desorb hydrogen at around 100 °C, indicating that thin film processing, when suitability tailored, could lower the desorption temperature of hydrogen from MgH2. In this case, the lower desorption temperature of the MgH2 film is due to the catalytic effect of the Pd layer,218 and cooperative phenomena due to elastic interaction in between the nanostructured Mg and Pd layers. The contraction of Pd layers upon hydrogen release induces a stress within the MgH2 film and thus its instability. One of the main problems with the thin film approach is the weight consideration and consequent reduction in storage capacity due to the substrate and film assembly forming the storage tank. Furthermore, the film is generally not stable and after several cycles hydrogen kinetics deteriorates due to surface reconstruction phenomena at the Pd/Mg interface.218 Stress and strain development during hydrogen loading may also result in cracks and peeling off from the substrates.174,218,219 In addition, it was found that the hydrogen kinetics in thin films are limited by the build-up of a hydride layer at the outermost surface of the film.220,221 The slow diffusion of hydrogen through the hydride phase further hinders absorption of hydrogen.
Changes in thermodynamics were suggested for cosputtered Mg/C films with a thickness of 25 nm.222 The thermodynamics of the Mg/C film was found to behave like that of an amorphous material and were not quantified. However, MgH2 films with a thickness of 100 nm show thermodynamic properties similar to that of bulk MgH2.223 Once more, this is proving that thermodynamic improvements should not be expected for large particle sizes, i.e. >5 nm. Such small sizes are difficult to reach with thin films because the magnesium film needs to be significantly thicker than the protective Pd layer, usually few nm thick. Accordingly, isolated and stabilised nanoparticles of magnesium should be synthesised to allow any improvement in hydrogen storage properties through size effects. In any case, Mg and Mg-alloyed thin films provide an excellent framework to investigate the (de)hydriding process in a very controlled and detailed way.


4.4.2 Nanoparticles. 
Investigations of hydrogen storage properties of isolated hydride nanoparticles are scarce. Most of the investigations mainly concern Pd nanoparticles because it is a material stable in air and relatively easy to prepare.174,196 The properties of Pd nanoparticles are clearly size dependant. In particular, recent results reported by Yamauchi et al. reveal a destabilisation of the Pd–H bond and a decrease in enthalpy and entropy as the diameter of the nanoparticles is reduced to 3 nm. In addition, Pd nanoparticles show a reduced critical temperature (Tc) of 120 °C instead of 292 °C for bulk Pd and narrow plateau pressures.174,175 According to Yamauchi et al., Pd nanoparticles exhibit a weaker Pd–H bond strength and there is a higher entropy for the hydrogen atoms in Pd nanoparticles in comparison to bulk Pd.175 Thus the hydrogen atoms in the nanoparticles would retain a certain level of freedom. The higher entropy would also explain the lower Tc values obtained for Pd nanoparticles. Furthermore, it was found that hydrogen atoms bind with different energy depending on whether they are within the outer surface or the core of the nanoparticle.175 Accordingly, a narrowing of the plateau pressure is observed since the atoms at the nanoparticle surface and subsurface, i.e. less coordinated, would bind more hydrogen atoms, and thus not contribute to the hydride phase formation.174 Undoubtedly, investigations on Pd nanoparticles demonstrate that the hydrogen-storage properties of metals, i.e. both kinetics and thermodynamics, can be controlled through size effects. Such knowledge is currently lacking for the most promising hydrogen storage materials, e.g. magnesium and complex hydrides. Nanoparticles and nanowires of magnesium with large particle sizes, >50 nm diameter, do not show significant thermodynamic improvements, despite their small size.188,189 Similarly, no thermodynamic changes were observed when magnesium was incorporated by melt infiltration in a porous carbon host with a pore size of 13 nm.194 However, a significant improvement of hydrogen kinetics are usually observed upon size restriction. For instance the activation energy with magnesium nanowires has been found to drastically decrease from 120 to 38 kJ mol−1 H2.188 The successful synthesis of magnesium nanoparticles with a size below 10 nm is only recent,185,200,201 and the first reports show a drastic improvement of hydrogen storage properties in colloidal magnesium. Hence, magnesium nanoparticles of 5 nm in diameter have been found to reversibly store 7.6 mass % of hydrogen at temperatures as low as 85 °C (Fig. 11).185,201 Further investigations are necessary to determine whether suitable nano-hydride structures with the right surface chemistry and size could lead to appropriate enhancements of both thermodynamics and kinetics. However, these first findings open up new possibilities in terms of designing functional materials for the widespread use of hydrogen technology.

4.5 Size effects and other hydrides
Several research groups are also extending investigations on size effects to other hydride materials than MgH2. Complex hydrides such as NH3BH3,224 NaAlH4,225–228 LiBH4,229–231 and Li3BN2H8232 show a significant decrease of decomposition temperature upon confinement within a scaffold and in some cases improvement of the conditions for reversibility. For instance, NaAlH4 confined within the porosity (∼2 nm) of carbon nanofibers releases hydrogen at 70 °C, i.e. 130 °C below that of bulk NaAlH4.225 Similarly, NaAlH4 embedded in metal organic frameworks or space confined in ordered mesoporous silica with a pore size of 10 nm displays faster desorption kinetics.227,228 LiBH4 incorporated into a carbon aerogel with a pore size of 13 nm shows a reduction of desorption temperature of 150 °C,229 and Li3BN2H8 nano-scaffolded in a similar environment does not display any significant improvement of kinetics but easier conditions for rehydrogenation.232
The reasons for the different behaviour observed at the nanoscale are unclear. Evidently, the smaller particle size of nano-confined complex hydride would facilitate both dehydriding and hydriding reactions as they are controlled by mass transport.36,50,233 One can also speculate that the local chemical and physical environment of the nanoparticle would play a major role in facilitating the reversible absorption of hydrogen. For instance, the interaction of the hydride nanoparticle surface with the inner wall of the scaffold could lead to a destabilisation of the metal hydrogen bond or conversely its stabilisation because of the minimization of any excess of surface energy (eqn (10)). Furthermore, the confinement of the complex hydride particles within a nanoscale void could prevent the segregation and dispersion of the products resulting in the release of hydrogen and thus facilitating the reversibility of the reaction. For complex hydrides, the entropy of the de/hydriding reaction may also increase due to the smaller particle size and thus according to eqn (10) lead to increased equilibrium pressures. Reaction paths that differ at the nanoscale to that of bulk complex hydrides may also explain some of the results obtained. However, no data have been reported so far to support such a hypothesis. The reactions of complex hydrides in their bulk form with hydrogen are relatively complex because they involve several steps and side reactions that are not clearly understood for most. In some respects, the confinement of complex hydrides makes the understanding and characterisation of their fundamental properties at the nanoscale more difficult because of the scaffolding environment. Nano metal hydrides in their colloidal form, such as MgH2, offer an excellent framework to investigate fundamental processes at nanoscale upon size restriction since the solid/hydrogen reaction is the only one occurring and the protecting surfactant layer does not restrict access to the hydride core with characterisation probes. Future results on fundamental processes of hydrogen with colloidal magnesium may be extended to other hydrides with a higher hydrogen capacity.
5. Conclusion and outlook
As early as 1948, it has been shown that a conventional internal combustion engine can be operated by utilising hydrogen as a fuel with only small modifications. Since these first trials, the idea of using hydrogen as clean energy carrier for vehicular application has significantly moved forward. The major impediment to hydrogen use is its storage. Metal hydrides are good candidates, but their practical use as hydrogen store is challenging. This is particularly the case with magnesium, one of the most interesting options for hydrogen storage purposes. Magnesium meets most criteria for practical application, i.e. high storage capacity, low cost, abundance, and magnesium is non-toxic. However, the absorption/desorption of hydrogen in magnesium is very slow and requires high temperatures. Significant progress has been achieved with respect to kinetics of hydrogen absorption/desorption in magnesium. In particular, the effective use of high energy milling has led to major breakthroughs. The rationalisation of such improvement remains a matter of debate, but several investigations suggest that the improvements of hydrogen kinetics are likely due to particle size reduction rather than defects, stresses and smaller grain sizes resulting from mechanical milling. Most defects and stresses are annealed during the first hydrogen cycle and thus unlikely to contribute to any kinetic improvements. Similarly, nanocrystalline magnesium undergoes major recrystallisation upon heating. Accordingly, any beneficial effect related to a large number of grain boundaries facilitating hydrogen diffusion has not been observed.
The thermodynamic properties of magnesium remain a significant barrier to its practical use. Attempts to destabilise magnesium through alloying methods have usually been unsuccessful. The modification of magnesium bulk structure through nanostructuring could also lead to a significant reduction of the metal-hydrogen bond strength, but the rapid recrystallisation of magnesium at moderate temperatures significantly limits the potential of such an approach.
Clearly, progress achieved over the last decade by high energy ball milling suggests the importance of size restriction in achieving fast kinetics and improving thermodynamics. Further theoretical calculations demonstrate that the thermodynamic properties of magnesium are size dependant. According to the nanoparticle surface energy, size, shape, and structure, significant destabilisation of the Mg–H bond strength as well as fast hydrogen kinetics could be achieved. Thus by controlling the particle size at the nanoscale, it would be theoretically possible to tune the overall properties of magnesium at molecular levels. Although the recent synthesis and stabilisation of magnesium nanoparticles as small as 3 nm has successfully confirmed the potential of the approach, many challenges are still ahead in terms of synthesis, stabilisation, characterisation, determination of the right nanostructure, and the engineering of nanosized hydrides into a functional device. From a practical point of view, the storage capacity of such nano-hydrides may appear as an issue because each individual nanoparticle has to be stabilised. However, high storage capacities would still be achievable. For example, colloidal magnesium with metallic content of 80% could reversibly store up to 6 mass % of hydrogen. Further investigations should also focus on developing the fundamental knowledge required to better understand the behaviour of hydrogen in nanosized metals and the influence of the nanoparticle physical/chemical environment on the overall hydrogen storage properties. The knowledge gained could significantly contribute to the development of functional hydrogen stores and novel nanomaterials.

Table Content:
Kondo-François Aguey-Zinsou	Kondo-François Aguey-Zinsou completed a PhD in heterogeneous catalysis at the University Paris VI in 2000. He carried-out postdoctoral research at The University of Queensland (Australia) in bio-electrochemistry. In 2003, he joined GKSS research centre (Germany) to develop novel materials for hydrogen storage. In 2005, he moved to Queen Mary University London, and later on to University College London where he supervised research projects on hydrogen storage, biofuel cells, and biomaterials. In 2009, he joined The University of New South Wales (Sydney) as a Senior Lecturer. His current research focuses on light metals and their hydrides at the nano-scale.
José Ramón Ares-Fernández	José-Ramón Ares-Fernández obtained his PhD Degree at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM) in 2002 for his investigations on metal-sulphide films. He then moved to PostDoctoral appointments where his research concentrated on the physicochemical properties of hydrogen storage compounds, at the Laboratoire de Chimie Metallurgique des Terres Rares (CNRS-Paris) and later with a Research Training Network at the Forschungzentrum GKSS (Hamburg) and the Department of Materials (University of Oxford). Since 2006, he has combined teaching and research at the UAM in a “Ramon y Cajal” position. His research focuses on novel methods and materials for energy storage and conversion.

Broader context
Hydrogen is a genuine alternative to current carbon dependence for energy production. In addition to environmental benefits, a hydrogen based economy would minimize issues related to increasing energy consumption, energy security and related geopolitical tensions. Hydrogen can be produced from many sources such as fossil fuels, water splitting, biomass and its combustion only produces water. To date, the implementation of hydrogen as an energy vector heavily depends upon the engineering of suitable storage. The technology for hydrogen production and utilisation, i.e. combustion engines and fuel cells, is relatively mature. Among the various materials able to store sufficient hydrogen for economic viability, magnesium best fits the bill in terms of abundance, cost and safety. However, the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of magnesium with respect to hydrogen restrict practical use. The strategies explored to tailor the properties of magnesium with respect to hydrogen are reviewed and their limitations in delivering practical solutions are discussed. In particular, the potential of the “size restriction” approach is examined. This includes the synthesis and characterization methods necessary to prepare magnesium nano-objects with restricted size, as well as advantages and possible limitations of size-effects on the properties of the magnesium/hydrogen couple.

Above the critical temperature, Tc, the two phase region (α + β) disappears and hydrogen exists only as a solution in metals. The slope of the van't Hoff plot is related to the enthalpy of the reaction and the intercept with the ordinate corresponds to the entropy of the reaction according to the van't Hoff relation: .

The dashed atoms correspond to the magnesium and hydrogen atoms at the surface.	 

 	Fig. 7  Influence of MgH2 particle size on the hydrogen desorption enthalpy from magnesium (ΔHdesorption) according to the surface energy of the magnesium plan (111) and (200). The curves were calculated according to relation (10). The magnesium plan (0001), i.e. the most stable surface, and the MgH2 plans (111) and (200) were considered for the calculations. The average of the effect of both plans still result in a destabilisation of MgH2 through size effects. The enthalpy for hydrogen desorption from bulk MgH2 is 76 kJ mol−1 H2.
