    , Accepted 24th June 2017First published on 26th June 2017AbstractFour organic sensitizers having a di-branched molecular structure D–(π–A)2 (D = para-substituted arylamine, π = 9,9-dibutylfluorene, A = cyanoacrylic acid) were synthesized, characterized, and applied in the development of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). It was found that the nature of the para-substituent affects the behavior of these sensitizers. In particular, the introduction of a C11 linear fluorous alkoxy group led to an improvement in the power conversion efficiency with respect to the commonly employed nonfluorous alkoxy substituents.
Introduction
A great deal of research is currently being conducted in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on the sensitization of a nanostructured metal oxide semiconductor interface by a photoexcited dye.1,2 Many different issues are addressed, ranging from the comprehension and modeling of the underlying fundamental phenomena to the assessment of the life cycle and economic effectiveness of the final devices.3–8 However, the development of new photosensitizers that could ensure optimal photovoltaic parameters and an acceptable lifetime service to DSSCs remains a major goal in this field, despite the impressive number of light-absorbing compounds with different molecular structures already proposed and tested.2,9–12 Encouraging results have been obtained in the case of structurally simple dipolar organic dyes comprising an electron-rich donor component (D) and an electron-withdrawing acceptor counterpart (A) bridged by a π-conjugated linkage. Such a flexible D–π–A modular blueprint allows for a great diversity of conceivable molecular structures. Organic sensitizers with tailored optical and energetic properties, high molar extinction coefficients and long term chemical stability have been thus synthesized through the judicious combination of the three basic D, π and A elements.13 In practice, triarylamine derivatives and cyanoacrylic acid, which also works as the anchoring group to the metal oxide electrode, have been the most commonly used D and A components, respectively, while the nature of the π-conjugated unit has been more systematically modified. This last parameter has a deep influence on the final performance of the dye, as it modulates the absorption of solar light and the ability to inject electrons to the metal oxide conduction band from photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer states produced upon irradiation of the dipolar molecule. Therefore, the inclusion of different π-conjugated cores such as simple C–C double or triple bonds, aryl or heteroaromatic rings, or combinations of all these elements has been widely investigated.14 The adoption of this strategy proved to be instrumental in providing highly efficient organic dyes that contributed to fabricate DSSCs with photovoltaic performances close to those obtained using well-established Ru-based sensitizers.15–17
The basic D–π–A molecular design has some drawbacks, too. Besides the inherent aggregation tendency shown by many rod-like shaped D–π–A dyes,13,14 the presence of a single accepting/anchoring A group results in a reduced interfacial electron transfer ability and a higher propensity to detach from the semiconductor surface under operating conditions. The incorporation of the most successful dipolar structural motifs into multi-branched, multi-anchoring molecular architectures (Fig. 1a) can help relieve these problems, as demonstrated earlier by Abbotto et al. who first designed di-anchoring dyes of the form D–(π–A)2, where two branches stem from the same D unit.18 Following this line of reasoning, several research groups devised other D–(π–A)2 dyes containing various substituted arylamines, carbazoles, phenothiazines or phenoxazines as D units,19,20 as well as more exotic X- and Y-shaped dyes, such as spiro-configured molecules where two identical D–π–A branches are interconnected by a common sp3-carbon atom.21–23 Nevertheless, the design of multi-branched, multi-anchoring dyes remains a relatively underdeveloped field and there is much room for further research on the optimization of the D, π and A components and their integration into new molecular architectures through the application of suitable synthetic schemes.

In preceding works, we demonstrated the use of fluorene as the π-conjugated central core of multi-branched spiro-configured (D–π–A)2-sensitizers.21,22 Here, it is shown that fluorene can play a similar role in D–(π–A)2 molecules (Fig. 1b), and that the photovoltaic performance of di-branched, di-anchoring sensitizers can be improved through the introduction of linear perfluorinated (fluorous) alkoxy substituents into the para-position of the central D unit.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of dyes
Arylamine donors and cyanoacrylic acid acceptors are the most widely used structural units in D–(π–A)2 sensitizers,19 similar to conventional dipolar D–π–A dyes. This feature was maintained in the design of fluorene-based FBA1–FBA4 (Fig. 1). On the other hand, fluorene is a useful building-block for the construction of dipolar sensitizers,24–26 but its incorporation as a π-conjugated unit into D–(π–A)2 dyes for DSSCs has never been described. A convenient general approach based on the N-functionalization of a versatile bis(fluorenyl)amine intermediate has been developed and applied to the synthesis of FBA1–FBA4 (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of fluorene-based D–(π–A)2 dyes. 
In brief, the Cu-catalyzed C–N coupling reaction between tert-butyl carbamate and a fourfold molar excess of the starting material 1, readily obtained by alkylation of commercially available 2,7-dibromofluorene, afforded the Boc-protected secondary amine 2 in 56% yield, while the unreacted dibromo fluorene was recovered and reused. Bis-lithiation/electrophilic quench of 2 gave the bis-aldehyde 3 (82% yield) from which amine 4 was readily released by acid cleavage in 89% yield. Pd-Catalyzed cross-coupling of this bis(fluorenyl)amine intermediate with suitable aryl halides, followed by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid, led to the desired D–(π–A)2 dyes. This synthetic pathway enables the introduction of a great variety of substituents into their arylamine D unit and therefore the possible fine-tuning of their ultimate behaviour as sensitizers in DSSCs, as it appears from a thorough analysis of literature data.19 In this regard, the presence of electron-donating para-alkoxy substituents is a common feature of many effective multi-branched, multi-anchoring dyes based on arylamines. We thus decided to investigate the effect of similar substituents on the behaviour of the D–(π–A)2 dyes derived from 4. Dyes FBA1 and FBA2 bearing standard short (p-OMe) and long (p-OC11H23) chain substituents, respectively, were obtained using known aryl halides. The unusual fluorous substituents present in dyes FBA3 and FBA4 were introduced thanks to the use of two purposely synthesized aryl halides (see the ESI†).
Photophysical and electrochemical characterization
The photophysical properties of the branched dyes were evaluated in solvent media with different polarity, namely toluene (TOL), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) and acetonitrile (MeCN). As shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 1, all dyes display three main absorption bands in DCE solution, two of which are in the near UV region (λmax at ≈320 and ≈350 nm) and may be attributed to π–π* transitions in the fluorene system. The third and more intense band, corresponding to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, is observed at lower energy (λmax at ≈480–500 nm). The ICT character of this band was confirmed by the fluorescence solvatochromism observed when solvents with different polarity were investigated. The four dyes under study showed a marked bathochromic displacement when the polarity of the solvent was increased (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). For example, the maximum emission of FBA3 was shifted 134 nm to lower energy when TOL was changed for MeCN. On the other hand, comparison of the absorption spectra of the four dyes in the same solvent (e.g. DCE, Table 1) revealed that the ICT light absorption band maximum for FAB4 has higher energy values (blue shift ≈15 nm) with respect to the other dyes, which share most of the structural features with FBA4, except for the nature of the para-substituent of the central D unit (Fig. 2).

The observed trend can be thus related to the presence of para-alkoxy substituents in FAB1, FAB2 and FAB3, which increases the electron density of the amino group stabilizing the photogenerated positive charge. It can also be noted that the insertion of a propylene spacer between the oxygen atom and the linear perfluoroalkylated C8-chain offers an effective insulation against the electron-withdrawing effect of the latter. Indeed, the ICT band maxima of FAB3 and FBA2 are fully comparable.
The dye excitation spectra in DCE solution are also shown as black dashed lines in Fig. 2. The observed similarity between the excitation and absorption spectra indicates that all the excited states contribute to the formation the ICT processes.
Finally, the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the adsorbed sensitizers on TiO2 porous electrodes fit well with the corresponding spectra in solution (see ESI,† Fig. S1). As expected, the ICT band looks broader and shows a small maximum wavelength displacement with respect to the spectrum in solution due to the interaction of the dye molecules with the TiO2 surface and among themselves. All these optical characteristics are in agreement with related structures and highly desirable from the DSSC point of view.21,26
Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed to study the electrochemical behaviour of the new sensitizers. All four compounds exhibit a typical quasi-reversible oxidation wave, which is related to the oxidation of the arylamine group (see the ESI,† Fig. S2). The calculated oxidation half wave potentials (E1/2) are summarized in Table 1. As in the case of the optical properties, the observed differences in oxidation potentials are directly related to the molecular structures of the compounds under study and can be similarly analyzed. FBA4 shows the highest E1/2 value (0.51 V), while FBA1, FBA2 and FBA3 are ≈0.15 V easier to oxidize, with similar E1/2 values among them, because of the presence of para-alkoxy substituents that are able to stabilize the generated positive charge.26 The electron-withdrawing fluorous chain attached to FBA3 does not affect the oxidation process thanks to the efficient electronic shielding provided by the propylene spacer.
Starting from the experimental optical and electrochemical parameters discussed above, the energy level diagram shown in Fig. 3 was built, from which the energetic feasibility of the DSSC process could be evaluated. The comparison of the energy levels of the ground and excited states of the dyes with the redox potential of the iodine couple and the lower edge of the conduction band of TiO2 revealed that in all cases the expected electron flow (injection into TiO2 from the dye excited state and dye regeneration by the I−/I3− couple) is exothermic, thus making DSSC operation viable.

Computational analysis
The optimized spatial configuration of the di-branched FBA dyes and the frontier molecular orbitals were determined by semiempirical AM1 calculations (HyperChem package). Representative results relative to the fluorous dyes FBA3 and FBA4 are shown in Fig. 4a–f. In both cases the two fluorene branches connected to the central aryl amino group are extended apart from each other due to sp3 hybridization of the nitrogen atom (Fig. 4a and b). Accordingly, both branches are capable of interaction with the TiO2 surface through the cyanoacrylic end groups. This conclusion was further corroborated by comparison of FT-IR spectroscopy data obtained from FBA3 dispersed in KBr pellets or adsorbed on TiO2. In this last case the spectra revealed that the characteristic band at 1691 cm−1 assigned to the free carboxylic acid groups of the KBr dispersed dye entirely vanishes, thus providing clear indication of the double-anchoring behaviour (see ESI,† Fig. S3).21,22,27
 Fig. 4  Geometric optimization (AM1 semiempirical calculations at HyperChem software) of the dyes FBA4 (upper panels) and FBA3 (lower panels): (a and b) spatial configuration, (c and d) HOMO and (e and f) LUMO molecular orbitals. 

Fig. 4c and d show that the HOMOs of FBA3 and FBA4 are localized mostly around the central aryl amino groups, whereas the LUMOs (Fig. 4e and f) are localized on the cyanoacrylic residues, regardless of the kind of fluorous substituent. Therefore, it is expected that upon photoexcitation the electron distributions are moved from the donor units (ground state) to the acceptor units, close to the anchoring groups, which favour the electron injection from the dye molecules to the TiO2 conduction band edge.
It must also be noted that the bulky fluorous domain (nine CF3 groups) present in FBA4 forms a sort of hydrophobic/lipophobic umbrella over the donor group, which is oxidized upon the photoinduced charge transfer process (Fig. 4a). This feature is not present in the other members of the dye series and can possibly hamper the regeneration of the reduced form of the dye during DSSC operation (see later).
Photovoltaic properties of DSSC devices
DSSC devices based on the donor–acceptor di-branched di-anchoring sensitizers were constructed in order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the FBA dyes. A common fabrication methodology, described in the experimental section, was employed, in order to fairly compare the fluorous and non-fluorous sensitizers. Additionally, all the fabricated cells exhibited similar light absorption in the visible range (electrode absorbance ∼2 at λ = 470 nm), suggesting similar dye loading over the TiO2 surface. Fifteen batches of four cells were tested for each dye.
Typical photocurrent–voltage (J/V) curves and J curves are shown in Fig. 5 while averaged values of the key photovoltaic parameters calculated from all devices are collected in Table 2.

The measurement procedure of the J–V curves can affect the obtained DSSC parameters (short circuit photocurrent density, Jsc; open circuit photovoltage, Voc; fill factor, FF; energy conversion efficiency, η), as discussed in recent literature examples.28,29 Thus, in order to carry out a comparative analysis of the performance of the FAB# dye series used in DSSC construction, and to avoid measurement procedure effects, we applied a voltage sweep from Jsc to Voc at a 5 mV s−1 scan rate, to ensure a steady-state cell operation regime. This procedure minimizes any hysteresis effect originating from chemical capacitance and series resistances in the DSSCs.28,29
Both Jsc and Voc values of DSSCs based on FBA2 and FBA3 dyes bearing long linear para-alkoxy substituents are clearly higher than those of DSSCs built with the para-alkoxy free FBA4 dye, but also than those obtained in the case of FBA1 that contains a simple –OMe substituent. Moreover, in all the analyzed batches of samples the cells constructed with the fluorous compound FBA3 exhibited a short circuit photocurrent about 35% higher than those fabricated with the otherwise identical FBA2 dye holding a linear hydrocarbon chain.
We already reported that the presence of perfluoroalkyl substituents in fluorene centered D–π–A photosensitizers has a strong influence in the generation of photoelectric effects.26 In particular, the introduction of branched fluorous groups in the tail D end of the molecular structure allowed us to obtain higher energy conversion efficiencies, due to the generation of larger photocurrent densities. This fact was ascribed to the anti-aggregation behaviour offered by the fluorous substituents, and to their efficient shielding effect on the TiO2 surface that avoids deleterious back electron transfer to the iodine electrolyte. The present results confirm the beneficial effect of the presence of fluorous substituents on the donor moiety of D–(π–A)2 sensitizers. However, a correct choice of the fluorous substituents is extremely important. Indeed, the fluorous dye FBA4 was found to generate the lowest photocurrent and energy conversion efficiency values among the investigated dyes. Two major factors contribute to this behaviour, namely the absence of a direct ether bond between the aryl amino D unit and the fluorinated fragment, and the above mentioned stereochemical constraints. As can be seen in Fig. 4a the phenyl amine donor group in FBA4 is roofed over by the umbrella-like fluorous substituent. To ensure efficient DSSC operation, the donor group photo-oxidized upon light absorption and electron injection must be quickly reduced by the triiodide present in the electrolyte solution. The steric hindrance and the solvophobic environment produced by nine CF3 groups can hamper the efficient redox reaction, with a consequent negative effect on the photocurrent generation, which is about one half of that obtained with the other fluorous dye FBA3.
The use of organic D–(π–A)2 dyes based on fluorene subunits in DSSCs afforded photovoltaic performance inferior to those obtained with one of the most efficient and widely used photosensitizers, namely the Ru-based N719 dye.30 For cells fabricated under the same experimental conditions, the latter ensured 5.2% energy conversion efficiency against the highest 2.5% value obtained using FBA3. Indeed, contrary to the black-coloured N719, the present D–(π–A)2 photosensitizers are not panchromatic and absorb only a part of the solar light, as exemplified in Fig. 6 where a picture of the red photoelectrode containing FBA3 and the corresponding incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum are reported. The complete set of IPCE spectra of dyes FAB1–4 is reported in Fig. S4, ESI.† In all cases the IPCE curves closely follow the absorption spectra of the corresponding dyes. Also, the IPCE maxima and device performance trends are in good agreement. The selective light harvesting behaviour of these dyes is likely resulting from the reduced ability of the fluorene π-bridges to ensure electron delocalization between the donor and acceptor units.31 This has a negative effect on the overall energy conversion efficiencies, but it is crucial for the fabrication of semitransparent, coloured solar cells of high interest from an architectural point of view and for the design and construction of smart windows in energy efficient modern buildings.32,33

Conclusions
A set of di-branched, di-anchoring organic photosensitizers D–(π–A)2 comprising of two identical fluorene subunits attached to a pivotal aryl amino donor group has been synthesized. The photovoltaic performances of these new Y-shaped compounds in DSSCs are deeply influenced by the nature of the substituents present on the donor unit. In particular the introduction of the linear fluorous alkoxy substituent –O(CH2)3C8F17 ensures improved power conversion efficiency with respect to standard short- and long-chain electron-donating para-alkoxy substituents previously used in many effective multi-branched, multi-anchoring dyes based on arylamines.19 The beneficial influence of fluorous groups was already observed in fluorene-based D–π–A photosensitizers and it was ascribed to a combination of reduced aggregation of the dye and efficient shielding of the titania surface, which avoids deleterious back electron transfer to the iodine electrolyte.26 The same effects are likely to play a major role in the present case, since photophysical and electrochemical studies and frontier molecular orbital calculations evidence the inherently similar electronic properties of the fluorous and non-fluorous para-alkoxy-substituted dyes. This is a useful clue for future improvements in dye molecular design. At the same time, the introduction of a spherical-shaped, bulky fluorous substituent connected to the donor unit through a C–C bond has detrimental consequences that are possibly related to both electronic factors and to an excessive steric hindrance. Such a behaviour was not observed in the case of linear D–π–A photosensitizer based on fluorene and should also be taken into account in the future development of multi-branched, multi-anchoring molecular architectures containing fluorous components.

Materials and methods

Chemicals. 
All commercially available products were used as received without further purification. 2,7-Dibromo-9,9-dibutyl-9H-fluorene 1 was prepared as described in the literature.34 Synthesis details of 1-iodo-4-(undecyloxy)benzene, 1-iodo-4-(4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,11,11,11-heptadecafluoroundecyloxy)benzene and 1-(1,3-bis(1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)propan-2-yloxy)-2-((1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)propan-2-yloxy)methyl)propan-2-yl)-4-bromobenzene are provided in the ESI.† Solvents were purified using standard methods and dried if necessary. Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) that was conducted on plates precoated with silica gel Si 60-F254 (Merck, Germany). Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel SI 60 (Merck, Germany), mesh size 0.063–0.200 mm (normal) or 0.040–0.063 mm (flash). 1H NMR and 13C NMR were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer (400 and 100.6 MHz, respectively); 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC 300 spectrometer (282 MHz). ESI mass spectra were obtained using an ICR-FTMS APEX II (Bruker Daltonics) mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were carried out by the Departmental Service of Microanalysis (University of Milano).


Photophysical and electrochemical characterization of dyes. 
Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrometer and on a Spex FluoroMax fluorometer, respectively. Spectra were acquired using quartz cells (path length: 1 cm) at room temperature in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), acetonitrile (MeCN) and toluene (TOL) solutions. To obtain the absorption spectra of the dyes adsorbed on titanium oxide, a diffuse reflectance cell (integrating sphere) was added to the Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrometer. The electrochemical properties of the dyes were determined using an Autolab Electrochemical Workstation PGSTAT 30 provided with a conventional three electrode cell with a Pt disk, a silver wire and a Pt coil as working reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A deoxygenated 0.10 M solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in DCE containing 1 mmol of salt was used as the supporting electrolyte for all dyes. The Pt working electrode was polished between experiments with 0.3 mL of alumina paste and sequentially sonicated in water and absolute ethanol. Ferrocene was used as an internal standard. Therefore, all the potential values are reported relative to the Fc/Fc+ redox couple (0.40 V vs. SCE).35


DSSC preparation and characterization. 
The assembly of the dye-sensitized solar cells was performed using a commercial Solaronix test cell kit, with the purpose of standardizing the operations and performing comparative studies based on multiple samples. The kit was composed of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass covered by screen printing with Solaronix Titanium Oxide pastes (the active layer of Ti-nanoxide T/SP covered by a reflective layer of Ti-nanoxide R/SP, active area: 6 × 6 mm), platinized electrodes (FTO glass with a homogeneous surface of the precursor Platisol T/SP), a sealing film made of Meltonix 1170-60, a slim glass and Iodolyte Z-50 Solaronix as the redox electrolyte. Dye-coating of the TiO2 films was carried out by soaking the films in 10−3 M solution of the dye in absolute ethanol, after heating the electrode to 60 °C. The two electrodes were laminated together using Meltonix 1170-60 and the solar cell was filled with Iodolyte Z-50 through a hole in the cathode. The filling hole was then sealed with Meltonix 1170-60 and a thin circle glass of 6 mm diameter.
Photocurrent spectra were obtained by illumination of the solar cell with monochromatic light obtained from a 75 W high-pressure Xe lamp (Photon Technology Instrument, PTI) and a monochromator equipped with a stepper motor controlled by a personal computer. The incident light intensities at different wavelengths were measured using a Coherent Laser-Mate Q radiometer. The photocurrent and voltage were measured using a solar simulator (Sciencetech 150) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The reported data are average values of a series of at least fifteen cells for each dye.
