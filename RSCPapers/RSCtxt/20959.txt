1. Introduction
Upconversion (UC) is an anti-stocks optical process that involves the conversion of the lower-energy photon radiation (usually near-infrared) into the higher-energy output emission. Since the first discovery of UC phenomena in 1959 by N. Bloembergen, who proposed a conceptual device named “infrared quantum counter”,1 the UC phenomenon has been observed in most rare-earth (RE) elements, and a few transition metals, actinides and organic dyes.2 Simultaneous two-photon absorption and second-harmonic generation are two well-established methods for generating anti-stokes emissions from the host of luminescent materials such as organic dyes and semiconducting nanoparticles. However, either expensive pulsed lasers with high-density excitation (106–109 W cm−2) or nonlinear optical materials with non-centrosymmetric atomic or molecular organization are required for the two methods.3 In contrast to these, the UC process in inorganic RE-doped crystals, classified by excited state absorption or energy transfer UC, has emerged as an attractive alternative.
The long-lifetime metastable excited states and rich energy levels of the RE ions enable the sequential multiphoton excitation (in microsecond scale) into the emission state, to further produce the intense anti-stokes photoluminescence under relatively low laser power (<1 W cm−2).4–6 These characteristics come from the special electronic configuration of the f-block elements of RE ions, for which the 4f electrons inner shells are effectively shielded by the closely lying 5s and 5p subshells. This shielding effect can also explain the fact that the RE ions usually exhibit line-like emission bands, and the spectroscopic properties of RE ions are barely perturbed by the local chemical microenvironment.
Different RE ions can emit UC luminescence (UCL) at various emission wavelengths (from ultraviolet to visible to NIR) by using a single near-infrared excitation wavelength (Fig. 1).2,7–9 The remarkable luminescence properties of the anti-stokes emission of RE ions attracted great attention in various research fields, owing to their fundamental scientific importance and potential applications in lasers, optical data storage, biological imaging, analytical sensors, photodynamic therapy, and solar energy conversion.10–14

The tremendous advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have led to the development of preparing small-sized RE-doped UCNPs with high photostability and low cytotoxicity, which are particularly suitable for biological labeling and imaging.15–46 Traditionally, biological labeling and imaging with the fluorophores such as quantum dots, dye molecules, quantum dots, and dye-doped silica/gold nanomaterials have become the state of the art with the potential to impact on fundamental biomedical research and clinical practice. However, these fluorescent materials are generally excited by ultraviolet (UV) or visible light, which may induce auto-fluorescence and photodamage to the biological samples, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio and limited sensitivity.
Although the semiconductor quantum dots possess a large molar extinction coefficient, high quantum yield, narrow emission bandwidth, size-dependent tunable emission and high photo-stability, which are attractive as alternative luminescent labels for biological labeling and imaging,47–51 the quantum dots for biological detection have several limiting factors. The potential toxicity of quantum dots may pose risks to human health. The intermittent emission also limits their application for labeling an individual biological molecule.
All these limitations prompted the development of high-quality and well-shaped UCNPs, which possess fascinating features, including low autofluorescence, less scattering and absorption, and deep penetration in biological samples. As a result, viable and robust methodologies to prepare RE UCNPs with uniform sizes and shapes, and sufficient brightness, have been developed. To date, the halide host materials, including fluoride, chloride and bromide, are shown to enhance UC luminescence intensity. But most chlorides and bromides are sensitive to moisture, and thus are not suitable for labeling biomolecules (used mostly in aqueous solutions).52 RE fluorides including binary REF3 and complex AREF4 (RE = rare earth; A = alkali), have been considered as excellent host materials due to their high refractive index and high transparency arising from low-energy phonons. Moreover, the fabrication of hybrid and composite materials incorporating RE fluoride UCNPs has also been paid extensive attention to get functionalities other than UCL. During the fabrication process, the surface modifications by ligand engineering,53–56 surface polymerization,25,57–60 self-assembly40,61–63 or layer-by-layer assembly technology20 are often indispensable for tailoring the surface status of UCNPs so as to meet the technical requirements of the corresponding applications. Surface modification by a silica shell is by far the most popular, common, and practical approach.58,63–65
This highlight aims to provide a general overview on the representative established methodologies for the preparation of RE fluoride UCNPs, the strategies for surface modification, and the application as luminescent labels in bioimaging of these UCNPs.
2. Methodologies for the preparation and surface modification of RE fluoride UCNPs
In order to obtain a high luminescence efficiency, the design and controllable synthesis of high-quality UCNPs are very critical. The UC processes, including the excited-state excitation, energy transfer and photon avalanche, rely on the existence of multiple intermediate states to accumulate the low-energy excitation photons.66 Remarkable efforts have been dedicated to get an optimized UCL system. Facts prove that the efficient UC processes can only occur in the compounds containing the trivalent RE ions owing to their extremely long-lived intermediate energy states.6,15 Theoretically, UC emission can be expected from most RE ions, but actually visible optical emissions under low pump power densities can only be generated by using Er3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+ as activators due to their equally spaced energy levels. Moreover, Yb3+ as a sensitizer with a larger absorption cross-section in the NIR spectral region has been proved to be an integral part to enhance UC efficiency. Generally speaking, an optimized UCNP should be a sensitizer–activator system containing Yb3+, no more than 20 mol%, and an activator, below 2 mol%, to minimize the loss of excitation energy by cross-relaxation process.
Dramatic efforts have been dedicated to the synthesis of high quality RE fluoride UCNPs. A major part of the synthesis of RE fluoride UCNPs have been devoted to the “wet chemical methods”. The experimental parameters, such as temperature, time, concentration of precursors, pH values, templates, and mineralizer, can be precisely adjusted, which allows the fine control of size, shape and chemical homogeneity of the products. So far, the representative and typical “wet” synthetic methods can be divided into four categories: thermal decomposition, hydro(solvo)thermal reaction, coprecipitation, and newly-developed methods including microwave-assisted synthesis and ionic-liquid-based routes.
Thermal decomposition, which gives high-quality RE fluoride nanocrystals with well-defined shapes and easily-controlled sizes after a relatively short reaction time in non-aqueous media, is one of the most popular methods. It generally involves two steps, namely dissolving the organic precursors in organic solvents with a high boiling point under the assistance of surfactants, and decomposing those precursors at an elevated temperature. The commonly used organic precursors are the RE organic acid compounds (e.g. trifluoroacetate, acetoacetate (acac), oleate, etc.), and the surfactants typically have polar capping groups and long hydrocarbon chains, such as oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OM). Yan et al. first reported the preparation of highly monodisperse LaF3 triangular nanoplates from a single-source precursor La(CF3COO)3 in OA/1-octa-decene (ODE) (Fig. 2A and B).67 Then, this method was also extended to the synthesis of NaYF4-based UCNPs. By the co-thermolysis of CF3COONa, Y(CF3COO)3, Yb(CF3COO)3, and Er(CF3COO)3 (or Tm(CF3COO)3), high-quality NaYF4:Yb,Er/Tm nanoparticles were obtained (Fig. 2C and D).68 Mai et al. systematically investigated the growth mechanism of nanocrystals prepared by this method and pointed out that the reaction went through four stages: (1) the nucleation in a delayed time, (2) the growth of nanocrystal supplied by monomer, (3) the size shrinkage by dissolution, and (4) the aggregation (Fig. 3).69 Following this synthetic method, a series of works were published and this method was found to be viable for the synthesis of LiREF4 and KREF4 UCNPs (Fig. 2E and F).70–72 Similar synthetic methods were also reported individually by Yi's group37 and Capobianco's group,73 and a wealth of representative research results were subsequently published.74–76

However, the thermal-decomposition method exhibits also some drawbacks, such as the high-cost and toxic precursors in some cases, the rigorous experimental conditions (high temperature, waterless, oxygen-free and inert gas protection), and the complicated post-treatment process. Moreover, the nanocrystals produced by the thermal decomposition method need be stabilized by surfactants, and can only be dispersed in nonpolar solvents or weak polar solvents. Therefore, post-synthesis processes are required to introduce hydrophilic and biocompatible coatings on those nanocrystals.
The hydro(solvo)thermal method is a typical solution-based approach, which features superheated solvents and the autogenic high pressure in autoclaves to increase the solubility and reactivity of precursors and allow fine crystallization of the final products afterward. As a result, the products provided by hydro(solvo)thermal method usually exhibit high crystallinity and few defects. This method possesses several acceptable advantages, including the convenient reaction conditions, the relatively high yield, the relatively low reaction temperature (usually below 250 °C), well controlled size, structure and morphology of the products, etc. Furthermore, the control over the size and shape of the products of hydro(solvo)thermal reactions can sometimes require the selection of an appropriate organic additive with functional groups acting as the complex agent or structure-directing agent.77,78
One representative hydrothermal synthesis example for preparing high-quality RE fluoride nanoparticles is a liquid–solid–solution strategy developed by Li's group. This strategy is based on a general phase transfer and separation mechanism that occurs at the interfaces of the liquid, solid, and solution phases present during the hydrothermal process, where linoleate or oleic acid molecules can be effectively absorbed on the surfaces of nanoparticles.20 Based on this strategy, RE fluoride nanostructures with various shapes, such as nanospheres, nanorods, nanospindles and nanotubes, were synthesized.79–81 Lin's group systematically investigated the mechanism of synthesizing different shapes of RE fluoride nano-/microcrystals.82 It was reported that the organic additive trisodium citrate, the fluoride source, and the pH value of the initial solution have great effects on the shapes of the product (Fig. 4).

Coprecipitation is one of the classic methods, which usually provides products with favorable phase purity by using simple procedures, and can be easily scaled up for mass production. It is worth noting that different ions may have different precipitation rates due to their own chemical natures. Thus, coordination agents are usually introduced for adjusting the synchronicity during the coprecipitation procedure. Subsequent heat treatment is often necessary to improve the crystallinity of the products (ranging from 400 to 600 °C). For example, this method was adopted by Yi's group to prepare multicolor UC luminescent LaF3:Yb,Er/Ho/Tm nanocrystals, with particle sizes of 5.4 ± 0.9 nm.83 Using ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the chelating reagent, they also prepared nearly monodisperse NaYF4:Yb, Er nanoparticles.84 By adjusting the molar ratio of EDTA to RE ions, the particle size could be controlled in the range of 37–166 nm.
As an energy source, microwave irradiation can be employed in combination with other methods. Microwave-heated systems barely undergo thermal gradient effects due to the high penetrability of microwaves, which ensures the energy is absorbed almost simultaneously into the whole system and the local temperature would be increased abruptly. As a result, the nanoparticles can be obtained within a very short reaction duration. Using this method, Nann's group synthesized a series of monodisperse AREF4-based UCNPs within 5 min85 and our group synthesized bifunctional lanthanide doped 3D raisin-like GdF3 nanocrystals.86
Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) known as “green solvents” have received extensive attention for their unique properties, such as being non-volatile, non-flammable and thermally stable. The main advantage of using ILs as solvents or additives is their superior capability for the dissolution and stabilization of metal cations. Particularly, the anions of some ILs contain fluorine atoms (e.g., tetrafluoroborates, hexafluorophosphates), and thus can serve as the source of fluoride anions during the synthesis of RE fluorides. For example, Kong et al. obtained small, water-soluble and pure β-NaYF4:Yb3+,/Er3+ (Tm3+) UC nanophosphors for the first time by an ionothermal method. The key point to this method is the utilization of an ionic liquid, [BMIM][BF4], which acts as solvent and template, as well as fluoride source.87 Yan's group also used this IL route to prepare NaYF4 nanoclusters in combination with microwave irradiation.88
Nonetheless, it still remains an open challenge to control the synthesis of sufficiently small particles with hydrophilic properties, high UC efficiency and functional biomolecules, in order for them to be used as bioprobes for small-animal imaging.
Normally, the UC nanoparticles prepared by conventional methods have either no intrinsic aqueous solubility or a lack of functional organic moieties. Therefore, an additional surface modification step prior to being biocompatible is required. An ideal luminescent UC nanocrystal used for biocompatible applications should meet several requirements, namely being homogeneously dispersed and stable in aqueous solvents, maintaining or enhancing photoluminescent efficiency, and showing high specific binding to biological components.89
A well-established approach generating a functional UC nanoparticle is so-called “ligand engineering”, which involves ligands exchange or oxidation of the native ligands. The hydrophobic ligands can be replaced through ligand exchange reactions by hydrophilic organic molecules such as 6-aminohexanoic,90 poly-(ethylene glycol) diacid,37 polyacrylic acid,54,91,92etc. Alternatively, the native capping ligands, if they contain mono-unsaturated carbon–carbon double bonds, can also be directly oxidized into carboxylic acid groups.53,93–95 Very recently, Esipova et al. reported a group of optical imaging probes, comprising UCNPs and polyanionic dendrimers.96 Dendrimers with rigid cores and multiple carboxylate groups at the periphery are able to tightly bind to the surfaces of UCNPs pretreated with NOBF4, yielding stable, water-soluble, biocompatible nanomaterials.
Apart from ligand engineering, surface functionalization by using ligand attraction, electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly, and surface polymerization have been applied to form water-soluble core–shell UC nanoparticles. These methods realize the surface coverage with molecules consisting of additional functional groups that allow further reactions with biological entities. Several materials including amphiphilic polymers,24,74,97 linear polyions,98 styrenes,99 and silanes42,100–106 can be utilized.
Among these methods, silica coating is a well established strategy for encapsulating nanoparticles into a silica shell for facile bioconjugation. Using the Stöber method and reverse-microemulsion method, the silica coating can be easily applied to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanoparticles, respectively. Reverse-microemulsion method was first demonstrated by Shan et al. to coat hydrophobic NaYF4:Yb/Er nanoparticles.107 Because there have been several comprehensive reviews published,108–110 this strategy will not be detailed here.
These studies offer some potential routes for the development of luminescent probes with multicolor properties. Such multicolored UCNPs are promising candidates for applications in multiplexed bioimaging.
3. UCNPs as contrast agents for bioimaging
As stated in the introduction section, RE fluoride UCNPs have been developed as a new class of fluorescence bioprobes owing to their many fascinating advantages. Several reviews in regard to RE UCNPs as biolabels have been published before,111–114 so we would like to refine several highlighted examples in the following section, particularly in the field of multimodal bio-imaging.
Zijlmans et al. first exploited UC particles for high performance bioimaging in 1999.115 In their influential paper, they used the submicron-sized Y2O2S:Yb/Tm particles to investigate the distribution of a prostate-specific antigen in paraffin-embedded sections of human prostate tissue. The autofluorescence signal associated with short-wavelength excitation is completely eliminated under NIR excitation (Fig. 5). Moreover, it is demonstrated that UC particle reporters do not bleach after their continuous exposure to high excitation energy.

(A) Tissue section after exposure to both blue and NIR excitation light; and (B) the green autofluorescence that coincides with the PSA-specific blue phosphor luminescence can be effectively eliminated using only NIR excitation. (Adapted from ref. 114.) 
Understanding the toxicity and biodistribution of UCNPs is required for the application of UCNPs in bioimaging in vivo. Numerous cytotoxicity tests show that lanthanide-doped nanomaterials are non-cytotoxic.56,62,92,95,116,117 Li et al.56,95 examined the biocompatibility of UCNPs coated with a silica shell or a layer of azelaic acid molecules. They found that these UCNPs had essentially no effect on the cell viability of human nasopharyngeal epidermal carcinoma KB cells after incubation for 20 h at a concentration of 800 mg mL−1. Shan et al.116 have also reported that there is limited or no toxicity of carboxyl- and amino-functionalized UCNPs after incubation for 9 days with human osteosarcoma cells. Zhang et al. reported the ex vivo biodistribution of PEI-modified118 and SiO2-coated NaYF4:Yb, Er/Tm UCNPs by measuring the concentration of Y3+ using coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.62 They observed that the SiO2-coated UCNPs first accumulated in the lung and heart, and were gradually excreted by urine or faeces and finally cleared from a normal Wistar rat's body in 7 days (Fig. 6). Li's group reported PAA-coated NaYF4:Yb/Tm with NIR-to-NIR UC luminescent (UCL) emission as luminescence probes for long-term in vivo distribution (47 days) and ex vivo observation (421 days) by a UCL imaging method.119 The biodistribution analysis showed that the UCNPs in the liver and the spleen were cleared very slowly from the body (Fig. 7), which is significantly different from Zhangs' work.62 This may be caused by the different dosages, sizes, aggregation, surface coating, and animal types.
 Fig. 6  Yttrium concentration as measured by ICP revealed the biodistribution of silica coated NaYF4:Yb UC nanocrystals in the organs of rats, harvested after 10 min, 30 min, 24 h and 7 days post-intravenous injection (adapted from ref. 62).

Multimodal bioimaging is a new frontier in biology and medicine, which combines more than one imaging modality, such as optical, nuclear, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for more accurate imaging and diagnosis. In order to collect UC signals from UCNP-labeled samples, Li et al. developed a three-dimensional visualization method, namely, laser scanning up-conversion luminescence microscopy.120 Under high-power excitation, the emission intensity of UCNPs varied very little, while that of organic dyes was found to diminish within several minutes. A quantitative description for the high contrast of UCNP labels was presented for the first time. Successively, they studied the targeted imaging of UCNPs with surface-functionalized amino groups.121 They employed a modified hydrothermal microemulsion route to folic acid (FA) functionalized UCNPs. FA-functionalized UCNPs and non-functionalized ones were injected into athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous HeLa tumors. In vivo UCL luminescence imaging showed that only the FA-functionalized UCNPs gave positive results in the tumor cells, confirming the in vivo specificity of the particle targeting (Fig. 8). Multi-colored targeting imaging was also demonstrated in other papers,42,46,56 and significant positive results were obtained.

All images were acquired under the same instrumental conditions (power density z 120 mW cm−2 on the surface of mouse). (Adapted from ref. 121.) 
The combination of MRI and optical imaging can lead to the development of new approaches to bridge gaps in resolution and depth of imaging between these two modalities. Plenty of efforts have also been devoted to integrate magnetic components with the UCNP units, aiming at constructing magnetic/luminescent bifunctional biolabels for both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and UCL imaging. Mi et al. fabricated bifunctional magnetic/UC nanocomposites using carboxyl-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles and amino-functionalized silica-coated UCNPs, and the nanocomposites were used for imaging HeLa cells (Fig. 9).122

(Adapted from ref. 122.) 
Recent research shows that Gd3+-based RE fluoride UCNPs exhibit multimodal features synergistically, because the RE ions such as Yb3+, Er3+(Tm3+) ions doped in the fluoride hosts contribute to UCL, and Gd3+ as a paramagnetic relaxation agent can introduce MRI modality. More importantly, Gd3+-based UCNPs work on their own, which eliminates the need for complicated procedures to combine individual functions as well as preserving the original particle sizes during the design and fabrication of multifunctional nanoparticles.
Hyeon et al. prepared different sized uniform and monodisperse NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+/NaGdF4 core–shell UCNPs (Fig. 10A–C), which can be used as a new type of multimodal imaging probe for both simultaneous imaging and MRI (Fig. 10).123 These nanoparticles work on their own without additional magnetic moieties. Analogously, Kumar et al. reported NaYF4 nanoparticles co-doped with magnetic Gd3+ ions and spectroscopically active Yb3+/Er3+ ions.124 These nanoparticles were then conjugated with tumor-specific antibodies, and in vitro targeted imaging of living cancer cells was demonstrated. Most recently, in vivo investigation on dual-functional NaGdF4:Yb, Er, Tm UCNPs was presented by Li's group.95

To conclude, the importance of RE fluoride UCNPs and their unique luminescence properties for technological advances are demonstrated in this highlight. The representative methodologies for the synthesis of RE fluoride are outlined, and the ways of surface modification of UCNPs and their application in bioimaging are described. Although tremendous achievements have been done in the synthesis, surface modification and application of UCNPs, there still remain several important fundamental and practical issues yet to be solved in the coming years. Firstly, methodologies for fabricating high-quality water-soluble UCNPs by simple, low-cost, and low-temperature pathways are still limited. Currently, the synthesis of UCNPs often requires the use of toxic and/or expensive precursors, and the reaction is often performed in an organic phase at high temperature. Thus, the as-formed nanoparticles are usually dispersible only in organic solvents, not in an aqueous phase. Additionally, for UC nanophosphors, the smaller size of UCNPs means weaker UCL emission. In particular, it is still difficult to synthesize sub-10 nm UCNPs with intense UCL emission. Therefore, further improving the UCL efficiency of sub-10 nm UCNPs is still needed. Recently, a piece of Zheng's work shows a step forward.125 Secondly, the measurement of absolute UCL efficiency and photodynamic study with regard to the excitation and emission processes of RE UCNPs is still in its infancy. Hence, precisely quantitative experimental characterizations are still in urgent demand. Finally, nanotoxicology studies of the UCNPs, including distribution, excretion, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in animal models are required to be continued. Biodistribution and toxicity studies of UCNPs with different sizes, shapes and surface coatings should be investigated in the future.
