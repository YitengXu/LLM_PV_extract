    , Accepted 27th December 2015First published on 28th December 2015AbstractIn order to effectively disperse reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in functional materials and take full advantage of its exceptional physical and chemical properties, a novel and effective approach for non-covalent modification of RGO by a chiral liquid crystalline surfactant (CLCS) consisting of chiral mesogenic units, nematic mesogenic units with carboxyl groups and non-mesogenic units with a polycyclic conjugated structure is firstly established. The polycyclic conjugated structure can anchor onto the RGO surface via π–π interactions, the chiral mesogenic units possess affinity for chiral materials by joining the helical matrix of chiral material and the carboxyl groups in nematic mesogenic units are supposed to form coordination bonds with nano zinc oxide (ZnO) to fabricate functional nano hybrids. The transmittances of CLCS–RGO hybrids exhibit S-shaped nonlinear increase with the increase of wavelength, but the total transmittances from 220 nm to 800 nm show a linear decreasing trend with the increase of RGO content in the CLCS–RGO hybrid. Due to the superior thermal properties of RGO and the interactions between RGO and CLCS, the dispersed RGO can improve the glass transition and increase the thermal stability and decomposition activation energy of CLCS. The intercalation of RGO can decrease the thermochromism temperature and improve the pitch uniformity of CLCS. Furthermore, CLCS can promote the dispersion of RGO in chiral nematic liquid crystals (CNLCs), and the CNLC–RGO–CLCS hybrids present decreased driving voltage and accelerated electro-optical response. The CLCS non-covalently modified RGO can strengthen the photocatalytic degradation of ZnO by suppressing the aggregation of ZnO and RGO.
Introduction
Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) possessing a one-atom-thick and two-dimensional honeycomb structure has been receiving tremendous attention in the fields of theoretical research and engineering application owing to its superior thermal stability, electron mobility, charge transportation, electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, optical properties and electrochemical properties.1–13 The thermal-oxidative stability of polypropylene and a silver nanowire transparent electrode can be improved by RGO.14,15 RGO functionalized electron mobility transistors are constructed to rapidly detect label-free DNA.16 The incorporation of RGO can obviously improve the catalytic performance of a polypyrrole counter electrode in a solar cell by reducing the resistance of charge transportation in a polypyrrole matrix.17,18 The elastic modulus and fracture toughness of RGO–hydroxyapatite composites are strengthened with the increase of the RGO content.19 The RGO–zinc oxide (ZnO) hybrids exhibit a 15 times enhancement in the nonlinear absorption coefficient due to the presence of graphene.20 RGO can be used as a conductive dopant to enhance the specific capacity, rate capability and cyclability of Zn–Ag2O batteries.21 However, like carbon nanotubes, RGO easily forms irreversible aggregations and shows poor solubility in organic solvents as a result of high cohesive van der Waals energy between neighbouring RGO, which greatly limits its end applications. Therefore, functionalization and dispersion of RGO sheets are of crucial importance for researchers to overcome the aggregation of RGO and to completely exploit the exceptional physical and chemical properties of RGO.22–25
According to a previous study, RGO is commonly covalently functionalized or non-covalently functionalized by organic materials. The covalent functionalization of zinc phthalocyanine greatly improves the dispersibility of RGO in organic solvents and enhances the optical limiting performance of RGO.26 Polyethylenimine covalently functionalized RGO shows improved water solubility and can be used as a drug-delivery system.27,28 Xanthates and peroxides are covalently grafted on the RGO surface in one single step, and the functionalized RGO exhibits a longer-lasting dispersibility than pristine RGO.29 The covalently functionalized RGO by β-cyclodextrin are dispersible over a wide pH range from 2 to 13.30 (3-Aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane functionalized RGO demonstrates uniform dispersion in a polyimide matrix and increases the thermal decomposition temperature, tensile strength and Young's modulus of the polyimide host.31 Silicon phthalocyanine covalently functionalized RGO nano hybrids demonstrate good hydrogen evolution performance under both ultraviolet light irradiation and visible light irradiation.32 RGO with covalently bound gold nanoparticles is used to fabricate highly sensitive impedimetric apta-sensors and nonvolatile memory devices with reproducible nonlinear hysteresis, a large current on/off ratio and high stability.33,34 RGO covalently coupled by graphitic carbon nitride can be used as a lithium-ion battery anode with superior electrochemical performance.35 Eosin Y covalently anchored RGO can be used as a recyclable photocatalyst with excellent catalytic performances in the aerobic oxidation of α-arylhalogen derivatives.36
Besides the above mentioned covalent functionalization, non-covalent functionalization, which can avoid the structural defects of RGO caused by covalent functionalization and preserve the intrinsic properties of RGO, is also selected to disperse RGO and fabricate functional materials. Non-covalently functionalized RGO exhibits homogeneous dispersion in a polyurethane matrix and enhances the tensile strength, storage modulus and thermal conductivity of the polyurethane matrix.37 Pyrene-based hexahistidine peptides are used to exfoliate, functionalize, and dissolve few layer graphene flakes in pure water.38 Monolayer graphene non-covalently functionalized by 1-pyrene butyric acid surface coated PbS can be applied in the fields of solar cells, sensors and photodetectors.39 Non-covalently modified RGO by multi-enzymes is used to fabricate an artificial biocatalytic system with improved enzymatic activity.40 Sulfanilic acid azocromotrop non-covalently modified RGO is applied as a supercapacitor electrode material with improved electrochemical properties.41 Non-covalently modified RGO paper by terephthalic acid exhibits enhanced strength and toughness.42
In recent years, liquid crystals have been selected as intermediaries to exfoliate graphene and to prepare functional nano hybrids. Graphene can be effectively dispersed in a liquid crystalline matrix and greatly improve the mechanical and electrical properties of liquid crystals.43 Liquid crystalline polymers are prepared to homogeneously disperse and align graphene, and the incorporated graphene enhances the mechanical modulus and electrical conductivity of the liquid crystalline polymer host.44 The dispersed graphene in a benzene/nematic liquid crystal mixture increases the isotropic to liquid crystalline phase transition temperature and the orientational order.45 The incorporation of graphene in polymorphic liquid crystals leads to the enhanced positional order, reduced ionic concentration and reduced diffusivity of the liquid crystalline phase.46 The graphene dispersed liquid crystalline polymers possess much higher effective thermal conductivity than neat polymers.47 The graphene doped liquid crystals exhibit significantly faster electro-optic switching than pure liquid crystals.48–51 The dispersed graphene can extend the blue phase temperature range of a chiral liquid crystalline host.52
In the present work, a novel chiral liquid crystalline surfactant (CLCS) consisting of non-mesogenic units with a polycyclic conjugated structure, chiral mesogenic units, nematic mesogenic units with carboxyl groups and the backbone of silicon oxygen is designed and prepared to non-covalently modify RGO (as shown Fig. 1 and 2). The polycyclic conjugated structure is used to anchor onto the surface of RGO via π–π interactions. The chiral mesogenic units possess affinity for chiral materials by joining their chiral matrices. The carboxyl groups in nematic mesogenic units are supposed to form coordination bonds with nano ZnO and to prevent the nano ZnO from aggregating. The silicon oxygen backbone connecting these components can endow the system with more stability.

Preparation of CLCS–RGO hybrids
Five CLCS–RGO hybrids were prepared using the following process. 0.1 g of CLCS was mixed with 0.2 wt%, 0.4 wt%, 0.6 wt%, 0.8 wt% and 1.0 wt% RGO in five sample bottles containing 10 mL of chloroform, and then the five mixtures were sonicated for 1 h in a bath sonicator (100 W acoustic power, 50% amplitude, 25 °C) to obtain five CLCS–RGO dispersions. Finally, five CLCS–RGO hybrids were obtained by removing the chloroform in the five CLCS–RGO dispersions in a vacuum oven at 50 °C.
Preparation of CNLC–RGO–CLCS hybrids
After the CLCS–RGO (10:1 wt/wt) dispersion was mixed with CNLC, the mixture was sonicated in a bath sonicator for 1 h and vacuum-dried to prepare CNLC–RGO–CLCS hybrids. By controlling the volume of the CLCS–RGO dispersion and the weight of RGO, the following hybrids were prepared, CNLC + 0.01 wt% RGO + 0.1 wt% CS, CNLC + 0.03 wt% RGO + 0.3 wt% CLCS, CNLC + 0.06 wt% RGO + 0.6 wt% CLCS and CNLC + 0.09 wt% RGO + 0.9 wt% CLCS.
Photocatalytic degradation experiments
The substrate of the photocatalytic degradation was 50 mL of MB aqueous solution (10 mg L−1), the catalysts used in this section were 0.02 g RGO, 0.02 g ZnO, 0.02 g ZnO + 2 mg CLCS, 0.02 g ZnO + 0.2 mg RGO, 0.02 g ZnO + 0.2 mg RGO + 0.5 mg CLCS, 0.02 g ZnO + 0.2 mg RGO + 1 mg CLCS, 0.02 g ZnO + 0.2 mg RGO + 1.5 mg CLCS and 0.02 g ZnO + 0.2 mg RGO + 2 mg CLCS. Before irradiation, the mixtures of MB and the catalyst were stirred for 30 min in the dark to establish the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Afterward, the dispersions were exposed to ultraviolet light (300 W, 365 nm) under continuous stirring. At a given time interval, 3 mL of aliquots were taken out and centrifuged to remove the catalyst. Consequently, the photocatalytic efficiency was analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 663 nm.
Characterization
The transmission spectra of the CLCS–RGO hybrids were analyzed by using an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda950). The thermal glass transition was characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) equipment (TA, Q2000). The thermal stability was characterized by using thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA) equipment (NETZSCH, TG209C). The specific rotation of CLCS was determined by using a Perkin Elmer 341 polarimeter. Observation of thermochromism was conducted by using a polarized optical microscope (POM) (Carl Zeiss, ScopeA1) equipped with a Linkam temperature controller. The photocatalytic degradation experiment was carried out with a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda950). The study of electro-optical properties of a CNLC–RGO–CLCS hybrid was carried out by a liquid crystal display (LCD) tester (North LCD Engineering Center).
Results and discussion
Transmission spectra analysis
In order to detect the transmission properties of CLCS–RGO hybrids, the transmission spectra of neat CLCS and five hybrids including CLCS + 0.2 wt% RGO, CLCS + 0.4 wt% RGO, CLCS + 0.6 wt% RGO, CLCS + 0.8 wt% RGO and CLCS + 1.0 wt% RGO were recorded in the UV-Vis region. 10 μL of the CLCS–RGO dispersion was drop-cast on a quartz plate (Φ10 × 1 mm) to form a thin film of CLCS–RGO hybrids after the chloroform was completely removed in a vacuum oven. Fig. 3a shows that the transmission curves exhibit a nonlinear S-shaped changing trend and the transmittances of all the samples increase with the increase of wavelength, suggesting that both CLCS and RGO reflect and absorb more high energy photons than low energy photons. The transmittances of CLCS–RGO hybrids above 310 nm decrease with the increase of RGO content in the CLCS–RGO hybrid, this result implies that RGO reflects and absorbs more photon energy than CLCS within the wavelength range 310 nm–800 nm. However, the transmittances of CLCS–RGO hybrids below 310 nm increase with the increase of RGO content, this result means that CLCS reflects and absorbs more photon energy than RGO below 310 nm. In order to quantify the total transmittances of CLCS–RGO hybrids from 220 nm to 800 nm, the definite integrations of transmission spectra are figured out based on the following equation: (1)where Transmittance(w) is the transmittance at a specific wavelength, d(w) is the increment at a specific wavelength. The total transmittances of neat CLCS and CLCS–RGO hybrids are listed in Fig. 3b, which exhibit a linear decreasing trend with the increase of RGO content in the CLCS–RGO hybrids.

Glass transition analysis
Glass transition is an inherent nature of polymers, which means the transition from the glass state to the high-elastic state. The glass transition of CLCS corresponds to the relaxation of chain segments in the polymer matrix. In order to study the effect of the dispersed RGO on the glass transition of CLCS, the DSC curves of neat CLCS and CLCS–RGO hybrids were recorded. As shown in Fig. 4a, all the curves possess an obvious stair-shaped change, which is a typical feature of glass transition. Neat CLCS has relatively high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 25.95 °C, however, the Tg of CLCS–RGO hybrids greatly decreases with the increase of RGO doping. The reason for this phenomenon can be ascribed to two main factors, on the one hand, the superior thermal conductivity of RGO makes the as-prepared CLCS–RGO hybrids more sensitive to thermal flow even at low temperature, on the other hand, the incorporation of RGO in the CLCS matrix leads to increased space and freedom degree of segments on CLCS, which makes the movement of chain segments easier. In order to get more detailed information concerning the glass transition process, the first derivatives of DSC signals are figured out (see Fig. 4b). These first derivative curves all possess maximum values in the temperature ranges of glass transitions. The appearance of a sharp peak makes it easier to recognize the decreasing trend of Tg with the increase of RGO content.

Thermal stability
The effect of RGO on the thermal stability of CLCS was studied by investigating the degradation behavior of neat CLCS and CLCS–RGO hybrids under a nitrogen atmosphere. The preparation of 1 wt% RGO embedded CLCS and 3 wt% RGO embedded CLCS is similar to that of CLCS–RGO hybrids in the “Preparation of CLCS–RGO hybrids” section. The TGA curves and corresponding mass loss rates are plotted in Fig. 5a, RGO possesses excellent thermal stability when the temperature is below 400 °C due to the lack of oxygen-containing groups (–OH, –O– and –COOH). The temperatures at 5 wt% weight loss of CLCS, 1 wt% RGO embedded CLCS and 3 wt% RGO embedded CLCS are 275.17 °C, 286.36 °C and 317.3 °C, and the temperature at 10 wt% weight loss increases from 308.72 °C to 338.45 °C. Meanwhile, the mass loss rates of CLCS, 1 wt% RGO embedded CLCS and 3 wt% RGO embedded CLCS are listed in the inset of Fig. 5a. The temperatures at the maximum mass loss rate (Tmax) are respectively 363.26 °C, 369.37 °C and 373.59 °C. The increased degradation temperatures and Tmax suggest that the thermal stability of CLCS is significantly enhanced by the incorporation of RGO.

The Horowitz–Metzger integral kinetic equation is selected to examine the activation energy (Ea) for thermal decomposition.53 (2)where m is the residual mass percentage, ΔT is defined as ΔT = T − Tmax, R is the universal gas constant 8.314 J mol−1 K−1, and k is the intercept of the linear equation. The Ea values can be estimated from the slope of the plot of ln(−lnm) versus ΔT (see Fig. 5b). The Ea values of CLCS, 1 wt% RGO embedded CLCS and 3 wt% RGO embedded CLCS are calculated to be 105.97, 110.73 and 138.06 kJ mol−1. The increased Ea can be attributed to the stable thermal stability of RGO and the interaction between RGO and CLCS. Meanwhile, the increased Ea values are also consistent with the increased decomposition temperatures, further proving that the incorporation of RGO can enhance the thermal stability of CLCS.
Thermochromism
CLCS possesses a one-dimensional photonic crystalline structure due to the helical organization of chiral mesogenic units. When the lattice parameters of CLCS are comparable to the wavelength of visible light, CLCS can selectively reflect a brilliant color according to the following Bragg diffraction equation:54,55 λ = np(3)where λ is the central reflection wavelength, n is the average refraction index, p is the pitch length of the chiral helix undergoing a 360° molecular rotation. Furthermore, p exhibits an obvious change when external thermal energy is continuously supplied to CLCS, which makes CLCS to possess thermochromic properties.
To study the effect of RGO on the thermochromic properties of CLCS, samples including 0.3 wt% RGO embedded CLCS, 0.6 wt% RGO embedded CLCS and 0.9 wt% RGO embedded CLCS were prepared in a way similar to the preparation given in the “Preparation of CLCS–RGO hybrids” section. The reflection images are presented in Fig. 6, both CLCS and CLCS–RGO hybrids exhibit thermochromic properties so that the colors shift from red to purple when increasing the temperature. The thermochromism of CLCS–RGO hybrids occurs at lower temperatures than that of neat CLCS, and the more RGO content in the CLCS–RGO hybrids, the lower the thermochromic temperatures will be. The reason for this phenomenon is that the intercalation of RGO changes the interaction between neighboring layers of CLCS and imposes the superior thermal conductivity of RGO on the chiral matrix of CLCS (see Fig. 1).

A Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram can be applied to further study the reflected colors of CLCS and CLCS–RGO hybrids, and the RGB values of the colors in Fig. 6 are converted to chromaticity coordinates in Fig. 7 according to the following standardized conversion equations settled upon by the CIE special commission.56 (4) (5)

The detailed data of RGB, XYZ and xyz are listed in the ESI.† Results show that the distance between the chromaticity coordinates of CLCS–RGO hybrids and (0.33, 0.33) is longer than the distance between the chromaticity coordinates of CLCS and (0.33, 0.33). As the matrices of CLCS and CLCS–RGO hybrids are composed of a large number of micro domains, each domain possesses a certain p and reflects a certain color, when the p of micro domains exhibit random distribution, the reflected color of the matrix will get close to (0.33, 0.33). Therefore, it can be assumed that the increased distance between the chromaticity coordinates and (0.33, 0.33) is caused by the improved uniformity of p.
Electro-optical performances
RGO possesses great potential to fabricate functional electrical materials due to excellent conductivity, electron mobility and transparency. In this section, hybrids consisting of CLCS, RGO and CNLC were prepared to study the effect of RGO on the electro-optical performance of CNLC, neat CNLC and CNLC + 0 wt% RGO + 1 wt% CLCS were used as reference samples. All the samples were filled into indium-tin oxide cells with a gap of 5 μm.
The effect of RGO on the driving voltage of CNLC is shown in Fig. 8a. The curves of the two reference samples are basically the same, implying that the spiral arrangement of the host CNLC is not disturbed by CLCS. For those CNLC–RGO–CLCS samples, there are voltage reductions with the increase of the RGO content in the hybrids, the driving voltage of CNLC + 0.09 wt% RGO + 0.9 wt% CLCS is lower than that of CNLC by 2.5 V, this can be explained by the following equation:57 (6)where d is the cell gap, K22 is the twist elastic constant, p is the pitch size and Δε is the dielectric anisotropy. In the system of CNLC–RGO–CLCS hybrids, p and K22 remain almost unchanged, the decreased voltage is mainly caused by the increased dielectric anisotropy.

The electro-optical response curves of CNLC and CNLC–RGO–CLCS hybrids are shown in Fig. 8b. The response time (τ) can be calculated by the following equation. τ = T90 − T10(7)
In the field-on process, T10 and T90 correspond to the time points when the reflectance changes 10% and 90% in the process from the maximum reflectance to the minimum reflectance, in the field-off process, T10 and T90 correspond to the time points when the reflectance changes 10% and 90% from the minimum reflectance to the maximum reflectance. Based on the above principles, the field-on response time τon and field-off response time τoff of all samples (see Fig. 8c) are figured out from the electro-optical response curves shown in Fig. 8b. The results show that the response times (τon and τoff) of CNLC + 0 wt% RGO + 1 wt% CLCS are longer than those of CNLC due to the high viscosity of CLCS. However, CNLC–RGO–CLCS hybrids exhibit faster response to the electric field with more RGO content, the reason for this accelerated electro-optical response is that RGO is anchored by the polycyclic conjugated structure in CLCS via π–π interactions and joins the matrix consisting of CNLC and CLCS (see Fig. 9), the presence of RGO can generate local fields in the electric field due to excellent conductivity, which can enhance the total electric field imposed on the CNLC–RGO–CLCS hybrids and lead to fast response.

The red rods represent CNLC host, the gray plates represent the dispersed RGO, the purple rods represent chiral mesogenic units in CLCS, the green rods represent nematic mesogenic units in CLCS, the pink ovals represent the polycyclic conjugated structure in CLCS, and the blue lines represent the silicon oxygen backbone in CLCS. CLCSs act as a surfactant and promote the dispersion and arrangement of RGO in a CNLC matrix with their chiral mesogens joining the CNLC matrix and the polycyclic conjugated structure anchoring on RGO. 
Photocatalytic degradation
In the photocatalytic field, semiconductor ZnO has been widely used to degrade organic pollutants under UV light exposure because of excellent photo sensitivity and wide band gap energy. However, the photoexcited electrons and holes generated by ZnO have a tendency to recombine, which lowers their photocatalytic efficiency. In order to inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes, RGOs are used to separate electrons and holes due to the large specific surface area and high electron mobility. As the aggregation of ZnO and RGO also can decrease the catalytic activity of the ZnO–RGO hybrid, in this work, CLCS is incorporated into the ZnO–RGO hybrid to modify both ZnO and RGO and suppress their aggregations.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of MB solutions are plotted in Fig. 10, the corresponding absorbances at 663 nm are presented in Fig. 11. The efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation can be quantified by the photocatalytic degradation rate, where A0 is the initial concentration of MB, and A is the concentration of MB after UV irradiation. (8)

Fig. 11 shows that there is slight photodegradation in MB solution because of lack of catalysts. The photodegradation efficiency in MB solution with RGO is lower than that in bare MB solution, because of the presence of RGO which can absorb a part of the UV light and thus reduce the light intensity in MB solution. MB solution with ZnO acting as a catalyst gradually degrades when exposed to UV light, and the photocatalytic efficiency of 0.02 g ZnO + 0.2 mg RGO is better than that of neat ZnO due to the efficient migration of photoexcited electrons and holes. The carboxyl groups in CLCS are supposed to form coordination bonds with nano ZnO and to prevent nano ZnO from aggregating, therefore, the photocatalytic efficiency of 0.02 g ZnO + 2 mg CLCS is higher than that of neat ZnO. Furthermore, the photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO–RGO–CLCS hybrids tends to increase with the increase of CLCS content. This improved photoactivity can be explained by the following mechanism. CLCS can effectively suppress the aggregation of ZnO and RGO with their polycyclic conjugated structures attaching onto the RGO surface by π–π stacking interactions and the carboxyl group anchoring onto the nano ZnO by coordination bonds, and these interactions are good for ZnO to generate more electrons and holes and good for RGO to transfer more electrons.
The photodegradation results of different amounts of RGO at a fixed amount of ZnO/CLCS are shown in Fig. 12. The existence of RGO can promote the photodegradation of MB. However, with further increase of the RGO content to 0.6 mg, the photocatalytic activity of the ZnO–RGO–CLCS hybrid decreases as a result of the increased absorption and scattering of UV light by excessive RGO and the decreased absorption of UV light by ZnO.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel CLCS is applied to non-covalently modify RGO without damaging its intrinsic structure and properties. The transmittances of CLCS–RGO hybrids exhibit S-shaped increase with the increase of wavelength, but the total transmittances from 220 nm to 800 nm show a linear decrease with the increase of RGO content in the CLCS–RGO hybrid. The glass transition temperature of CLCS can be decreased by the embedded RGO. The thermal stability and Ea of CLCS during the thermal decomposition process can be increased by RGO. The exfoliated RGO can decrease the thermochromism temperature and improve the pitch uniformity of CLCS. Furthermore, CLCS can promote the dispersion of RGO in CNLCs, and the CNLC–RGO–CLCS hybrids present a decreased driving voltage and an accelerated electro-optical response. The CLCS non-covalently modified RGO can strengthen the photocatalytic degradation of ZnO. We believe that the non-covalent modification of RGO by stable and ordered CLCS will broaden the application prospects of RGO in the field of optical devices, electronic devices and environmental protection.
