    , Accepted 6th March 2015First published on 6th March 2015AbstractThis paper describes the design, synthesis, and fundamental characterization of a series of Cr and V acetylacetonate (acac) complexes for use in redox flow batteries (RFBs). These materials offer a significant improvement in theoretical energy density relative to state-of-the-art aqueous chemistries. A detailed assessment of the solubility, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge behavior of the complexes is presented. Their solubilities in acetonitrile vary by more than four orders of magnitude based on the structure/substituents on the acac ligand. Complexes bearing acac ligands with ester substituents have solubilities of up to 1.8 M, a significant improvement over most other metal complexes that have been considered for non-aqueous RFB applications. While the acac ligand substituents have a dramatic impact on solubility, they do not, in most cases, impact the electrochemical properties of the complexes. For instance, voltammetry for all of the V(acac)3 derivatives examined exhibit two quasi-reversible redox events separated by approximately 2.1 V. Charge–discharge testing in static H-cell and laboratory-scale flow batteries yielded energy densities that were consistent with the voltammetry and coulombic and energy efficiencies of up to 92% and 87%, respectively. Overall, these studies provide the basis for the development of structure–function relationships that could lead to new and even better performing energy storage chemistries in the future.
Introduction
Electricity accounts for approximately 40% of the energy consumed annually in the United States, and nearly 70% of this electricity is derived from non-renewable fossil fuels.1 U.S. emissions from the 2.88 billion MW h generated from fossil fuels were 830 kg CO2/MW h, 1.9 kg SO2/MW h, and 0.9 kg NOx/MW h in 2010.2 Despite these issues and significant incentives, renewable resources were responsible for just 2.5% of net electricity generation in 2010.2 One of the greatest challenges associated with the integration of renewables into the grid is the lack of reliable, low-cost electrical energy storage (EES) devices to deal with the mismatch between supply and demand that often arises with intermittent sources like solar and wind.3–5 In addition, EES devices have the potential to increase grid stability in the event of unexpected power interruptions by providing an immediate source of stored energy.4
Redox flow batteries (RFBs)4,5 have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage. RFBs employ solutions of redox active materials. These solutions are stored in separate tanks, and the batteries can be charged or discharged by pumping the solutions through an electrochemical conversion cell.6 The separation of these electrolytic solutions minimizes battery self-discharge, thereby providing improved efficiency when compared to other types of batteries. RFBs also offer the advantage that energy storage is decoupled from power generation.4,6 As such, energy storage and load-leveling needs can be met independently by individually sizing the RFB storage tanks and the electrodes. The energy storage density (Ê) is directly proportional to three parameters: (1) the cell potential (Vcell), (2) the concentration of the redox active species (Cactive), and (3) the number of electrons transferred during the redox reactions (n). A convenient figure of merit for the maximum energy stored by an RFB is shown in eqn (1): Ê = 0.5 × Vcell × Cactive × n × F(1)
Most commercial RFBs utilize aqueous solutions of transition metal salts, and state of the art systems have energy storage densities of ∼25 W h L−1.7 While progress is being made to increase the energy densities,8 their maximum energy densities are fundamentally limited by the relatively narrow electrochemical window of water, which restricts the cell potential (Vcell) to ∼1.2–1.6 V.5,6,9,10 An attractive approach to address this limitation is to develop RFBs that utilize non-aqueous solvents.11 Acetonitrile, for example, is stable over ∼5 V, which represents a nearly 4-fold improvement over the operating voltage window for water.12 Non-aqueous solvents are more expensive than water, and can pose several safety issues (e.g., flammability and toxicity), however, these issues can be addressed with proper engineering. For example, the cost benefit ratio could improve dramatically if high energy density chemistries are demonstrated.
The use of non-aqueous solvents for RFBs was first explored by Matsuda and co-workers in the 1980s.13,14 These studies focused on acetonitrile solutions of transition metal bipyridine and acetylacetonate complexes. In the period following these initial investigations, reports of non-aqueous RFB chemistries have primarily focussed on transition metal complexes bearing bipyridine,15–17 β-diketonate,15,18–24 bis(acetylacetone)ethylenediamine,25 or dithiolene26 ligands dissolved in acetonitrile and/or propylene carbonate. Polyoxometalates,27 redox active organic molecules,28–30 and semi-solid electrolytes31–34 have also been explored. While many of these systems have favorable properties for flow battery applications (including reversible redox chemistries and high stabilities), they generally exhibit modest solubilities in organic solvents. To date, the most soluble transition metal complexes examined for non-aqueous RFB applications involving multiple electron transfers reach saturation at ∼0.8 M in acetonitrile. Single electron transfer complexes reach 1.8 M in carbonate solvents.26,35 Efforts to improve solubility in both types of systems have focused almost exclusively on commercially available ligands and transition metal complexes. As a result, there have been few systematic studies of the impact of chemical structure on the solubility, electrochemical, and battery performance-relevant properties of transition metal active species in non-aqueous RFBs.
This paper describes the synthesis of a series of Cr and V acetylacetonate derivatives and a detailed assessment of their solubility, cyclic voltammetry, and charge–discharge behavior as a function of ligand structure. Most significantly, we demonstrate that the solubility of these complexes in acetonitrile can be varied by more than four orders of magnitude by tuning the ligand structures.
Results and discussion
Active species design and synthesis
Our studies focused on the functionalization of chromium(III)18 and vanadium(III)19,23,24 acetylacetone (acac) complexes. Previous work has shown that the parent complexes Cr(acac)3 and V(acac)3 have electrochemical properties that are attractive for applications in non-aqueous RFBs. In acetonitrile, V(acac)3 (1) has two quasi-reversible redox couples, with a potential window of 2.2 V,19 while Cr(acac)3 (2) offers a wider electrochemical window, albeit with less reversible redox chemistry.18 Nevertheless, the theoretical energy storage densities for these materials remain relatively low (∼12 and 40 W h L−1, respectively), due to their low solubilities in acetonitrile.
We hypothesized that systematic derivatization of the acac ligand framework could be used to tune the solubility of these Cr and V acetylacetonate complexes. This hypothesis was predicated on prior work by Yamamura, who reported that the solubility of uranium acac complexes could be modulated by replacing acetylacetone with other commercially available 2,4-disubstituted acac derivatives.21 In the current study, we targeted a diverse set of 2,4- and 3-substituted acac ligands bearing polar functional groups (e.g., bromine, nitro, amino, ester, ether, and cyano substituents), as we hypothesized that these would enhance solubility in polar aprotic organic solvents.28
Our initial focus was on the synthesis of derivatives of Cr(acac)3. Despite the modest reversibility of the redox chemistry in this system, derivatives of Cr(acac)3 are straightforward to prepare. Furthermore, these Cr complexes are air and moisture stable, enabling facile manipulation and purification. Notably, we also anticipated that we might observe variations, albeit subtle, in the electrochemical properties of the complexes as a function of ligand substitution. As highly soluble Cr derivatives were identified, we then undertook the more challenging synthesis of their vanadium analogues, which generally show more reversible electrochemistry.
Complexes 3–6 (Fig. 1a) were prepared by the reaction of Cr(acac)3 with electrophiles, using previously reported procedures.36–41 Complexes 7–9 (Fig. 1b) were synthesized through a disproportion reaction between Cr(acac)3 and 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propandione.36 This transformation afforded a mixture of products 7–9 that could be readily separated via column chromatography on silica gel. Finally, complexes 10–15 (Fig. 1c) were accessed in two steps. First, the 3-substituted ligands were synthesized by conjugate addition of acetylacetone with a diverse range of acrylate derivatives.42 Next, deprotonation of the ligand with sodium hydride followed by introduction of CrCl3(thf)3 or VCl3(thf)3 produced the corresponding Cr or V adducts. All of the metal complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and mass spectrometry. In addition, X-ray crystal structures of 6, 8, and 9 were obtained (see ESI†).

Solubilities
The solubilities of complexes 1–15 in acetonitrile were measured using a UV-visible spectroscopic method (Fig. 2, Tables 1 and 2). The parent V(acac)3 (1) and Cr(acac)3 (2) have solubilities of 0.65 and 0.40 M, respectively. These values are consistent with those reported in the literature.18,19 The incorporation of Br, NO2, and phenyl substituents on the acetylacetonate ligand has a deleterious effect on the solubility of the corresponding Cr complexes (3, 4, and 7–9 have solubilities of 0.002, 0.05, and 5.7 × 10−5 to 0.043 M, respectively). Conversely, incorporation of the –CH2CN moiety (5) results in a small increase in solubility (to 0.43 M). The addition of a –CH2NMe2 group at the 3-position (6) dramatically enhances the solubility (to 1.92 M);39 however, this ligand suffers from redox instability (vide infra). Finally, complexes bearing ester-substituted ligands (10–15) show significant enhancements in solubility relative to the parent M(acac)3. The improvements in solubility can be attributed to both the reduction in crystallinity of these molecules, as they exist at room temperature as highly viscous tars or oils, and the increased incorporation of polar functional groups, such as esters and ether, which are more miscible with polar solvents such as acetonitrile. Most dramatically, complexes bearing the 2-methoxyethyl-substituted ester (13 and 15) are highly viscous oils with solubilities of 1.8 M and 1.32 M in acetonitrile, respectively. These solubilities are up to ∼3-fold higher than those for the parent Cr(acac)3 and V(acac)3. Overall, these studies show that systematic substitution of the acac ligands leads to complexes with solubilities in acetonitrile ranging over four orders of magnitude (5.7 × 10−5 to 1.92 M). Furthermore, these investigations provide insights into the influence of various functional groups on solubility. We anticipate that this latter information will be more broadly applicable to the development of novel redox active molecules for non-aqueous RFBs.43,44

The high solubility and viscous nature of complex 13 led us to hypothesize that further extension of the ether chain would result in a metal complex that is a liquid at room temperature. Indeed, the 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl-substituted ester complex 14 is a high-viscosity liquid, and the addition of acetonitrile merely serves to dilute this complex. As such, a solubility determination is not meaningful. This molecule (and derivatives thereof) holds promise for the development of high energy density, solvent-free chemistries for RFBs and will provide the basis for future work.
Finally, we compared the solubilities of complexes 2 and 13 in dimethylcarbonate (DMC) and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), solvents that are often considered for RFBs.33 As shown in Fig. 3, both complexes are significantly less soluble in these solvents compared to in acetonitrile. However, in all cases, the ester functionality imparts an approximately 4-fold enhancement in solubility relative to the parent complex 2. The solubility measurements are for the neutral complexes. Preliminary bulk electrolysis results show the solubility of complex 1 changes by less than 25% when charged. This is a significant decrease and future work will investigate the effects of state of charge in greater detail.

Electrochemical properties
The energy density of a RFB is directly proportional to its operating potential (Vcell). In addition, the reversibility of each redox couple is extremely important for battery performance, as poor reversibility will limit battery cycle-life. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the potentials and reversibilities for redox couples associated with all of the new complexes. A time semi-derivative method was used to deconvolute the CVs, and the reversibility of each couple was quantitatively assessed using the current peak height ratios (ic/ia).45–47 Peak height ratios near unity are consistent with high redox reversibility. Representative cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 4. The results are summarized in Table 1.

The parent complex Cr(III) acetylacetonate (2) shows four redox couples with relatively poor reversibility (ic/ia ranging from 0.41 to 3.95).18 Electrochemical characterization of complex 4 shows no redox couples at positive potentials, while only one negative couple is apparent, with very slow kinetics (∼300 mV peak separation). A previous report of the electrochemical behavior of complex 4 made no mention of slow kinetics; furthermore, an additional redox couple was mentioned in the prior report but was not observed in the current experiments.41 Complex 5 shows similar electrochemical behavior to complex 2 at negative potentials, but there is evidence of side reactions at positive potentials. These features are likely due to ligand detachment and/or degradation. The other Cr(III) complexes (3, 6, 10–14) show electrochemical properties very similar to those of the parent complex 2, with small shifts in the potentials from complex to complex. With some of the ester functionalized ligands, the CrIII/IV couple was slightly more reversible (Table 1, cf. entries 2 & 11).
A previous study of 7 using polarography showed that this complex displays extra redox couples relative to Cr(III) acetylacetonate, which we hypothesize are due to ligand non-innocence.41 The heteroleptic complexes 8 and 9 allowed us to assess the extent of this effect. The cyclic voltammetry (Table 2, Fig. 5), shows a direct correlation between the number of 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propandione ligands in the metal complex and the number of additional redox events. However, the incorporation of each non-innocent phenyl-moiety has an incremental deleterious effect on complex solubility, with complex 7 exhibiting the lowest solubility reported herein. Nevertheless, ligand non-innocence provides a potentially attractive method for increasing RFB energy density if more soluble ligand motifs can be identified.48

Previous work has shown that V(acac)3 (1) has significantly more reversible electrochemistry than its Cr analogue (2).19,23,24 Similarly, the oxidation and reduction peaks for V complex 15 have ic/ia values very close to unity (−1.96 V = 1.02 and 0.15 V = 0.97), while those for the Cr analogue 13 are not close to unity (−2.41 V = 2.17, –2.19 V = 0.30, 0.97 V = 2.66 and 1.34 V = 3.81). We note that in a smaller voltage window, the first oxidation couple for 13 exhibits improved reversible (ic/ia = 0.96) (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 also shows that the redox couples for 15 are shifted to more negative potentials by ∼260 mV relative to those of V(acac)3 (1). Despite this shift, the available electrochemical windows (i.e., possible battery cell potentials) for 1 and 15 are nearly identical, at 2.19 and 2.11 V, respectively.
Another important characteristic for the active species in an RFB is the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion coefficient will impact the power density that can be achieved. Adding substituents to the acetylacetonate ligand is expected to negatively impact the diffusion coefficient, based on the Stokes–Einstein equation.49 This could result in reduced transport rates and could ultimately limit power densities for the associated RFBs.49 Diffusion coefficients for complexes 1, 2, 13, and 15 (see Table 3) in acetonitrile were obtained from cyclic voltammograms at varying scan rates. The data were fit to the Randles–Sevcik equation (eqn (2)). ip = 2.687 × 105 × n3/2 × A × D1/2 × Co × ν1/2(2)

Here, ip is the peak current for the oxidation or reduction reaction, n is the number of electrons transferred (one in this case), A is the area of the electrode, D is the diffusion coefficient of the reacting species, Co is the bulk concentration of the active species, and ν is the scan rate. This equation assumes reversible reactions, so slow scan rates and redox couples with peak height ratios close to unity were used. Scan rates of 10–100 mV s−1 were utilized for all complexes, and plots of ipvs. ν1/2 were linear in all cases. The linearity indicates a diffusion-controlled redox process, and the slope was used to calculate the diffusion coefficients. As shown in Table 3, the diffusion coefficients for 13 and 15 are lower than those for 1 and 2, respectively. This is expected based on the larger substituents on the ligands of 13 and 15 compared to 1 and 2.49 However, all of the values are within the same order of magnitude and are expected to be adequate for RFB applications.6
Charge–discharge characteristics
Cr complex 13 and V complex 15 displayed the most attractive combination of solubility and electrochemical properties in acetonitrile, and were therefore evaluated in charge–discharge experiments. In each experiment, the same complex was used as both the catholyte and anolyte to limit the deleterious effects of cross-over.
Preliminary experiments were carried out in an H-cell. Fig. 6a shows charge–discharge results for a 0.05 M acetonitrile solution of complex 13 with 0.5 M of tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate added as the supporting electrolyte. Fig. 6b shows the charge–discharge results for 15 under similar conditions. Constant current densities of 0.21 mA cm−2 and 0.021 mA cm−2 were used for charging and discharging, respectively. A lower discharging current was used to limit overpotentials and ensure the cell was completely discharged. Cut-off charging potentials of 3.5 V and 2.4 V were used for complex 13 and complex 15, respectively, with a discharging potential of 1.0 V for both complexes. The charging potentials were selected based on the measured cell resistance of 206 Ω, which would result in a 0.1 V overpotential. This overpotential is primarily due to the large separation between the two electrodes, with contributions from membrane and solution resistances.
 Fig. 6  H-cell charge–discharge experiments of 0.05 M solutions of (a) chromium complex 13 (cycle 7) and (b) vanadium complex 15 (cycle 4) with 0.5 M TBABF4 in acetonitrile. The first stable cycle of each experiment is shown. 
Solutions containing chromium complex 13 were cycled more than 20 times. In a typical cycle (Fig. 6a), this complex charges in ∼0.6 h, which correlates well with the one electron transfer predicted by CV. The lack of a discernible voltage plateau during discharge is indicative of the poor reversibility of the complex. The cell stabilized after six cycles at coulombic efficiencies of ∼55% and energy efficiencies of ∼25%. These values are similar to those reported previously for Cr(acac)3 (2) in an H-cell (53–58%, and 21–22%, respectively),18 and are consistent with the similar electrochemical behaviour of complexes 2 and 13, as assessed by CV. The modest coulombic and energy efficiencies can be attributed to the irreversible nature of the electrochemistry.

Fig. 6b shows that vanadium complex 15 charges in ∼3 h which correlates well with the electrochemistry indicated by the CV. In contrast to complex 13, this system shows a discharge plateau at ∼1.8 V, which again correlates to the CV when overpotentials are taken into account. The cell stabilizes after the first three cycles at coulombic efficiencies of ∼76% and energy efficiencies of ∼52%. These results are similar to those obtained with the parent V(acac)3 (1), which was reported to have coulombic efficiencies of 70–73% and an energy efficiency of 34%.19,23 The performance of cells containing the V complexes are superior to those for the Cr complexes due to the increased reversibility of the redox couples with V.
Given results from the H-cell experiments, the performance of vanadium complex 15 was further investigated in a laboratory-scale flow-through electrode configuration RFB cell. A 0.1 M solution of complex 15 in acetonitrile with 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate as supporting electrolyte was used as both the catholyte and the anolyte. The non-aqueous vanadium RFB cell was initially charged to 75% of the theoretical state of charge (SOC) at 10 mA cm−2. The open circuit cell potential (OCVcell) and electrochemical impedance were measured at the end of the first charge. The RFB cell resistance was ∼1.75 Ω cm2 which was much lower than that measured for the H-type cell. Thus, higher charge–discharge current densities were employed than were possible with the H-cell. Charge–discharge cycles were performed at 10 mA cm−2, with cut-off charging and discharging potentials of 2.3 V and 1.5 V, respectively. The vanadium RFB cell stabilized during the first C/D cycle. Overall, the cycles exhibited a single charging potential curve starting at ∼2.0 V and a discharging potential curve at ∼2.1 V, as shown in Fig. 7. These results are in good agreement with the potential window predicted for 15 from the CV experiments (2.1 V). The OCVcell of the vanadium RFB system was 2.17 V at the end of the first charge. The RFB cell was initially charged up to a 75% SOC; thus, a higher OCVcell was expected. A cell potential of 2.1 V would correspond to a 50% SOC.
 Fig. 7  Flow battery charge–discharge cycles of 0.1 M vanadium complex 15 with 1 M TEABF4 in acetonitrile at 10 mA cm−2 in a RFB cell. Cycles 2 and 3 are shown. Flow rate: 25 ml min−1. Room temperature. 
The average coulombic and energy efficiencies for the vanadium RFB cell were ∼92% and ∼87%, respectively, for the first 12 charge–discharge cycles. The coulombic efficiency losses may be due to (a) the loss of active species via side reactions or (b) crossover of vanadium species through the TEA–Nafion membrane. The degradation of V(acac)3 due to side reactions was reported previously.22,47 The energy performance of complex 15 is comparable with that reported for V(acac)3, using a similar flow cell design.50 The reported coulombic and energy efficiencies for 0.1 M V(acac)3 were ∼90% and ∼83%, respectively, at 10 mA cm−2.50
Conclusions
This paper describes the design and synthesis of a series of Cr and V acac complexes, and a detailed assessment of their solubility, electrochemistry, and charge–discharge behavior as a function of ligand structure. We demonstrate that the solubility of these complexes in acetonitrile can be varied by more than four orders of magnitude by tuning the ligand structures. In particular, complexes bearing ligands with ester substituents (13 and 15) show high solubilities in three common non-aqueous RFB solvents: acetonitrile, dimethylcarbonate, and tetraglyme. The solubilities of 13 and 15 in acetonitrile represent 450% and 200% enhancements, respectively, compared to the corresponding M(acac)3 parent complexes. Electrochemical and charge–discharge studies show that 13 and 15 have electrochemical properties that are similar to the parent M(acac)3 species. In static H-cell charge–discharge experiments, coulombic efficiencies of ∼55% were achieved for 13 with 0.5 M TBABF4 in acetonitrile, while coulombic efficiencies of ∼76% were achieved for 15 under the same conditions. In an initial test of a laboratory scale prototype flow battery test with 0.1 M of 15, we demonstrated coulombic and energy efficiencies of 92% and 87%, respectively, with operating current densities of 10 mA cm−2. Flow cell experiments with higher concentrations of the active species would be required for further scale-up. Likewise, further optimization of the reversibility, potential limits, membranes, and electrode materials should allow the vanadium chemistry to approach the theoretical energy density predicted for saturated solutions of 15 (37.3 W h L−1). This will be the focus of our future work. Furthermore, the studies described herein provide a foundation for the rational design of novel active species with further enhancements in solubility and electrochemical properties that should ultimately surpass aqueous RFB technologies.
Experimental
General
All manipulations were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques or in a nitrogen-filled MBraun glove box unless otherwise stated. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using Varian VNMRS 700 and MR400 spectrometers with CDCl3 as the solvent. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature and are reported in parts per million relative to the residual solvent peak. Mass spectra were measured using an Agilent Q-TOF mass spectrometer or Waters (VG Analytical) 70-250-S magnetic sector mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum BX Ft-IR spectrometer employing an ATR attachment. UV-visible measurements were collected using a Shimadzu UV-1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Melting points were recorded on Mel-Temp 3.0 and are uncorrected. For synthetic chemistry, anhydrous diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane were prepared by passage through an Innovative Technologies solvent purification system and stored under an inert atmosphere. Anhydrous acetonitrile was purchased from Alfa-Aesar and used without further purification. For cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge experiments, anhydrous acetonitrile (99.8%) and tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (99.0%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. The molecules 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl acrylate,51 ethyl 4-acetyl-5-oxohexanoate,52 tris(3-bromo-2,4-pentanedionato)chromium(III) (3),38 tris(3-nitro-2,4-pentanedionato)chromium(III) (4),37 tris(3-cyanomethyl-2,4-pentanedionato)chromium(III) (5)39 and tris(3-N,N-dimethylaminomethyl-2,4-pentanedionato)chromium(III) (6)39 were prepared according to the literature procedures. Preparation of the remaining ligands is discussed in the ESI.† All other reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and were used without further purification.
Solubility determination
Stock solutions of the desired complex were prepared in acetonitrile, in triplicate, from which standard solutions were prepared by serial dilution. Each sample used for solubility testing was analysed by PXRD before and after generation of the saturated solution to assess the solid form of the material relevant to the solubility measurement. UV-Vis spectra of the most concentrated stock solution was recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer and used to determine a suitable wavelength for absorbance measurements. Absorbances of the standard solutions were then measured at the determined wavelengths and used to prepare an absorbance versus concentration calibration curve. For solids, saturated solutions were prepared by portion-wise addition of the desired complex to 300 μL of acetonitrile with stirring until a persistent suspension resulted. For viscous tars, 300 μL of acetonitrile was added to the product, and the mixture was shaken until no further material dissolved. In all cases, the solution was then filtered through cotton wool to remove any undissolved material, and three aliquots were diluted in acetonitrile to afford absorbances within the range of the calibration curve.
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry was performed using a PGSTAT302N Autolab Potentiostat and a 600D CH Instruments Potentiostat, for each complex to obtain the electrochemical window, standard potentials, and approximate reversibility. A 10 ml, three electrode electrochemical cell, fabricated in-house, was used for these experiments. The three electrodes consisted of a 0.07 cm2 glassy carbon disk working electrode (BASi), a Ag/Ag+ quasi-reference electrode (BASi) filled with 0.01 M silver tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile (Sigma Aldrich), and a 23 cm long platinum wire counter electrode (ALS). The working electrode was polished using 9 and 0.3 μm aluminum oxide polishing paper (Fiber Instrument). All solutions were prepared inside an Ar-filled MBraun glove box, then transferred to the electrochemical cell and sparged with N2 for 10 minutes. The cell was then sealed and a nitrogen headspace was maintained for the duration of the experiment. During analysis, the current peak height ratios (ic/ia) were obtained using a time semi-derivative (deconvolution).
Charge–discharge experiments
Charge–discharge experiments were performed in an H-cell using a Maccor 4000 Series Battery Tester. The constant charging and discharging currents were 0.21 and 0.021 mA cm−2, respectively. The H-cell (Adam's & Chittenden) included half cells that were separated by a Neopsepta AHA membrane (Ameridia). These membranes were pre-conditioned in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Aldrich) in acetonitrile for at least 24 h. The cell contained two ∼6.4 cm2 graphite plate electrodes (McMaster Carr) and two PTFE micro-stir bars (Fisher). The catholyte and anolyte each consisted of 5 ml of a solution of 0.05 M of the redox active complex with 0.5 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Aldrich) dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (Fisher). For complex 13, cutoff potentials of 3.5 and 1.0 V were used. For complex 15, cutoff potentials of 2.4 and 1.0 V were used. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using a PGSTAT302N Autolab Potentiostat at frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz–100 kHz at the open cell potential using an AC potential perturbation of 10 mV. The RFB cell resistance was determined from the intercept of the real part of the impedance at high frequency. The EIS and charge–discharge experiments were performed inside an Ar-filled glove box.
A laboratory-scale prototype redox flow battery system with a standard flow-through electrode configuration (RFB) for electrolyte flow was used. The RFB system used in this study was reported previously.50 Briefly, the RFB cell consisted of graphite felt SGL GFA 3.0 (3 mm thickness, SGL group) electrodes with a geometric area of ∼5.65 cm2. A tetraethylammonium cation (TEA+) exchanged Nafion® 1035 membrane (EW of 1000 g mol−1, 89 μm nominal thickness, Alfa-Aesar) was employed as the separator. The TEA+-form Nafion membrane was prepared as reported elsewhere.50 After cell assembly, the electrode compression was approximately 20%. Prior to cell assembly, the electrodes were soaked in the test electrolyte for 2 h. The catholyte and anolyte each consisted of 25 ml of a solution of 0.1 M vanadium complex 15 with 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (99%, Aldrich) dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile. The electrolyte was delivered to each cell compartment at 25 ml min−1 by means of a peristaltic pump (Masterflex Mod. 77800, Cole-Parmer®) with two heads. Charge–discharge battery cycles were performed at constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 with cut-off potentials between 1 V and 2.3 V. The EIS was carried out at frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz–250 kHz at the open cell potential bias using an AC potential perturbation of 10 mV. Before EIS measurements, the RFB cell was resting at the open circuit cell potential for 1.5 min. The RFB cell resistance value is reported as the intercept of the real part of the impedance at high frequency. A Solartron SI 1287A potentiostat–galvanostat coupled with a Solartron 1260 impedance/gain phase analyzer were employed to conduct the battery cycle testing and EIS measurements. The RFB cell was assembled and tested under a N2-controlled atmosphere.

The authors note that the solubility measurements described herein are for the neutral complexes and that the solubility could significantly change upon changing the materials oxidation state. Future work will quantify the extent of this effect.
Polymorphism in materials 1–15 could have a significant effect on the solubility reported herein. In an effort to assess the extent of any changes in solid state packing the materials were assessed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) prior to saturation and as the post saturation residues. In the cases were the materials were crystalline prior to saturation (1–9), a crystalline residue was obtained post-saturation. The highly soluble materials (10–13, 15) gave PXRD patterns consistent with amorphous solids both pre- and post-saturation.

This method is widely used to increase the resolution of redox reactions by generating a steady-state signal with peaks at the standard potential. This is done using the convolution theorem; the full derivation and examples are widely available.
One interesting characteristic of these cyclic voltammograms of 7–9 is that the couples resulting from ligand non-innocence have peak height ratios much closer to unity than the couples for chromium(III) acetylacetonate (1), indicating faster kinetics. Slow kinetics is detrimental to the operation of a flow battery and the incorporation of non-innocent ligands could be a way to overcome the kinetic limitations of chromium. The couples associated with the phenyl substituents also caused a negative voltage shift in the potentials of the redox couples relative to complex 1, which limits the number of couples within the stable voltage window.
