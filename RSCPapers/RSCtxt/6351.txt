    , Accepted 19th February 2018First published on 21st February 2018AbstractWe have synthesized a novel solid organic ionic conductor (SOIC) that acts as a redox mediator and a light absorbing material at the same time. Such dual function of SOICs has not been reported before. It was achieved by substituting N,N′-dimethyl benzimidazolium iodide (BIMI) with hetero-anthracene (phenoxazine (POZ)/phenothiazine (PTZ)) which are labeled as SOIC-1 and SOIC-2, respectively. These substitutions caused the absorption spectrum of BIMI to be extended over 100 nm into the red spectrum and at the same time exhibit excellent redox capability and ionic conductivity. In addition, these synthesized SOICs also enhance the total electron injection into the TiO2 matrix with the metal-free SK3 dye sensitizer. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to optimize the structure and geometrical arrangement of the SOICs. To evaluate the role of PTZ/POZ substitution on BIMI and how pore filling can affect the device performance, solid-state DSSC (ss-DSSC) devices were prepared with two different thickness of TiO2 (8 μm and 12 μm) photoanode. The 8 μm thick TiO2 photoanode with SOIC-1 has an overall PCE of 7.9% which is about 72% higher than the unmodified BIMI (PCE of 4.4%) under AM1.5 illumination. Last but not least, the synthesized SOICs have high thermal stability up to 120 °C which is way beyond the operating temperatures of solar cells which make them ideal for real-world applications.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have attracted tremendous attention due to their simple fabrication process, high photoconversion efficiency, feasibility to assemble on a flexible/rigid substrates and low manufacturing cost since they were reported in 1991 by M. Gratzel and B. O'Regan.1 Briefly, DSSC is made up of light absorbing dye, nanocrystalline TiO2 film, a catalytic Pt-counter electrode and an I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte. One of the key components is the electrolyte, which plays a pivotal role in the charge transfer process and regeneration of dye. The electrolyte directly affects the performance and stability of DSSC. The first generation of DSSC that used liquid I−/I3− electrolyte exhibit a power conversion-efficiency (PCE) of up to 13%,2,3 but they suffer from numerous drawbacks like dye desorption and electrolyte leakage due to the volatile solvents. These resulted in low stability and device sealing problems.4–6 Therefore, to avoid the above problems, the DSSC community has developed solid state electrolytes to replace liquid electrolytes.6,7 The quasi solid8,9 and polymeric redox electrolytes10 are potential alternatives to liquid electrolytes due to their excellent ionic conductivity, but they have poor pore filling ability and interfacial compatibility with TiO2 or Pt-electrodes surface. This has therefore spurred scientists to synthesize small molecule hole transporting materials11 and solid metal–ligand complex12 based electrolytes. However, they suffer from low conductivity, poor hole mobility and stability issues.6,13 All these factors have hindered DSSC in real-world applications.
Solid organic ionic conductors (SOICs) are well known for their excellent performance in photoelectrochemical cells due to their low volatility, high conductivity and facile synthesis procedure.14,15 The most promising class of solid ionic conductors for the fabrication of high efficiency ss-DSSCs is based on imidazole iodide (IMI) salts. A huge amount of efforts have been carried out to increase the performance of the IMI based electrolyte by incorporation of bulkier moieties or substitution of alkyl chains. For instance, Z. S. Wang and co-workers have reported the substitution of an ester group on IMI to enhance the function of the electrolytes.16–18 They also reported high conducting propargyl-functionalized single component ionic conductors used in ss-DSSCs and reported a PCE of 6.3%.19 Yan et al. has developed cyanobiphenyl-functionalized and nitrogen doped imidazolium-based ionic crystals and achieved a PCE of 5.11%.20,21 Midya et al. has reported that the ionic hole transport materials of carbazole substituted on IMI with different anions to achieve 3.0% PCE.22 Recently, we have reported the POZ(phenoxazine)/PTZ(phenothiazine) substituted IMI based SOICs, which exhibit excellent conductivity, hole mobility and thermal stability.14 Ss-DSSCs fabricated with POZ/PTZ substituted IMI based SOICs has a PCE of 5.2%, where substituent donor moieties contributed in enhancing electron transport properties and short-circuit current density (Jsc). Increasing ionic sites on the moiety improves ion diffusion which leads to better conductivity, i.e. the di-cationic SOICs based on pyrrolidinium and IMI salts have achieved a remarkable performance of more than 6.0% efficiency.23,24 These promising results suggest that more works are needed in this field to develop more efficient SOICs with an effective substituent in conventional champion moieties, which can provide better hole mobility and light harvesting ability along with redox mediating capability.
Herein, we have introduced di-cationic SOICs based on POZ and PTZ substituted BIMI electrolytes that were linked by octyl chain between the twin donor moieties through the 10-H position of POZ(SOIC-1)/PTZ(SOIC-2) for the first time. Their general structures are shown in Fig. 1. The bulkier photosensitive substitution on BIMI resulted in photo-generation ability, enhancement of the conductivity through the bulkier cations. These SOICs absorb visible region spectrum and support the enhancement in photo-generation for champion metal free sensitizer SK3 (Fig. 1)25 along with their excellent iodide diffusion and hole carrying function, they perform dual role in ss-DSSC. Due to this, it directly broadens the light absorption spectrum and decreases electron recombination as compared to bare BIMI. DFT calculations were also carried out to find the possible arrangement of twin moieties between the octyl linkage and cationic effect on the distance of iodide atom. Ss-DSSCs were fabricated using the SOIC-1 and SOIC-2 with various thickness (8 μm and 12 μm) of TiO2 photoanode for better insight into the pore filling ability. The optimized thickness of TiO2 photoanode (8 μm) with SOICs shows highest photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.9% and 6.8% for SOIC-1 and SOIC-2, respectively. The presence of multi-components in the electrolyte generate complexity, therefore we have also introduced SOICs in DSSC without mixing any additive such as I2, TBP, GSCN, etc. Single component SOICs were used in ss-DSSCs and achieved highest PCEs of 6.0% (SOIC-1) and 5.60% (SOIC-2) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. We also investigated the I–V responses of the ss-DSSCs under different light intensities ranging from 0.2 to 1 Sun.

FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide, 12 Ω) and sealant materials were purchased from Solaronix, SA, Switzerland. Dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol, dichloromethane, potassium bicarbonate, sodium metabisulfite were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The metal-free organic dye (SK3) was synthesized according to our previous work.25
Characterizations
Structural characterizations of SOICs were carried out with 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Bruker 400 MHz) in DMSO-d6 solvent. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed by thermal analyzer TGA-Q500 system with nitrogen as purge gas (60 mL min−1) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a temperature range of 25–500 °C. The UV-vis absorption spectra experiments were done with UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-160A). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on Autolab (FRA 32) electrochemical workstation with Ag/AgCl, Pt-wire and glassy carbon as the reference, counter and working electrode, respectively at a 25 mV s−1 scan rate. The similar electrodes setup (working electrode used SK3 dye sensitized TiO2 film) used for Mott–Schottky analysis. Theoretical calculations were obtained by TD-DFT, using Gaussian 09 software with B3LYP, LanL2Dz basis set. Raman spectra were carried out by using Horiba Jobin Yvon modular Raman spectrometer with a green laser (514 nm, Stellar Pro Argon-ion laser). Steady-state voltammetry was measured on a conventional photo-electrochemical cell with platinum UME as the working electrode and Pt-disk and Ag/AgCl as the counter and reference respectively. The conductivity of the SOICs was measured by impedance spectroscopy with two symmetric conducting electrodes (area 0.22 cm2), on an Autolab electrochemical workstation. The thickness of TiO2 photoanode film was measured by Alpha-Step IQ Surface Profiler.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were measured by an Autolab (FRA32) workstation with the frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 120 kHz and AC amplitude 10 mV. During the measurement, the device was kept in dark under the application of −0.70 V DC bias. Photocurrent–voltage measurements were performed by using Keithley-2450 source meter and apply a potential bias to the ss-DSSCs under 1 Sun illumination (solar simulator, Newport, Oriel) with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5G). The active area of the device was maintained at 0.2 cm2. Open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was obtained by same autolab instrument and the electron lifetime (τe) of SOICs based ss-DSSCs was calculated.
Fabrication of photoelectrochemical cells
The preparation nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode could be found in our previous works.26,27 Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass was cleaned with a surfactant, deionized water, and alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. A thin buffer layer of TiO2 (titanium isopropoxide dissolved in isopropyl alcohol) was spin coated (2000 rpm, 60 s) onto the FTO followed by annealing at 450 °C. Upon annealing, pieces of adhesive tape were fixed along the side of the conducting glass and kept 0.2 cm2 area uncovered. The prepared TiO2 paste was deposited onto the FTO substrate by doctor blade method and calcinated at 450 °C for 30 min. The porous TiO2 electrode was then cooled down to 50 °C and was kept in 30 mM of SK3 dye (dissolved in ethanol:dichloromethane) solution at room temperature (kept in dark environment) for overnight. The counter electrode was prepared by spin coating 50 mM H2PtCl6 (in IPA) solution on another FTO at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The FTO coated with H2PtCl6 was then heated up to 400 °C for 15 min. The solid-state DSSCs had a sandwich structure. The organic ionic conductors were filled into the space between the SK3 sensitized TiO2 photoanode and counter electrode.
The electrolyte consists of SOICs or BIMI, I2, TBP and GSCN at a molar ratio of 0.1:0.01:0.1:0.02 dissolved in acetonitrile solvent. The device was then kept at 40 °C to evaporate the organic solvent. The procedure was repeated two to three times to make a compact layer between TiO2 photoanode and Pt-counter electrode.
Synthesis process of SOICs
1,8-di(10H-Phenoxazine-10-yl)octane (1a) and 1,8-di(10H-phenothiazine-10-yl)octane (1b) were synthesized according to the literature procedure.28,29

General procedure for synthesis of 10,10′-(octane-1,8-diyl)bis(10H-phenoxazine-3-carbaldehyde) (2a) and 10,10′-(octane-1,8-diyl)bis(10H-phenothiazine-3-carbaldehyde) (2b). 
The compound (1a) (1 g, 2.0 mM) and dry dimethylformamide (520 mg, 7.11 mM) in 1,2 dichloroethane (5 ml), POCl3 (1.1 g, 7.17 mM) was added slowly at ∼0–5 °C in 50 mL three neck round bottom flask on an ice bath. Then reaction mixture was heated under stirring at 90 °C for 24 h and after completion of reaction, the mixture was quenched with DI water and extracted with organic solvent (CHCl3). These organic fractions were washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography on a silica gel column using dichloromethane and hexane as the eluent (1:4), to give a light pink colour product (compound 2a yield 75%). For synthesising compound (2b), the same protocol as that of (2a) except starting material was taken (1b) (compound 2b yield 70%).


General procedure for synthesis of 1,8-bis(3-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-10H-phenoxazine-10-yl)octane (3a) and 1,8-bis(3-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)octane (3b). 
1 g (1.8 mM) of the compound (2a) and sodium metabisulfite were dissolved in 6 mL of DMF. 0.5 g (4.6 mM) of ortho-phenylenediamine was then added. The reaction mixture was refluxed at ∼90 °C for 24 h. At the end of the reaction, resulting mass is quenched with brine (sodium chloride solution) and DI water. The product was extracted by chloroform from the aqueous phase and purified by column chromatography (compound 3a yield 73%). For synthesis compound (3b), the same protocol was adopted using starting material from compound (2b) (compound yield 72%).

Synthesis of SOIC-1. 
1 g (1.41 mM) of compound (3a) and the 2 mole equivalent of CH3I (0.41 g, (2.9 mM) were added in 15 mL of THF solvent and reflux for overnight. Then a viscous oily layer of THF was poured into water dichloromethane (1:10). Potassium carbonate was slowly added under stirring, which resulted in the production of carbon dioxide. The white precipitation was then filtered and the filtrate contains product that was allowed to evaporate. The resulting compound was dissolved in THF with equal-molar of CH3I and heated overnight at 90 °C. The final product was washed with ether to obtain a brown colour SOIC-1 with a 85% yield. The same protocol was followed for synthesis of SOIC-2 (yield 80%).

Results and discussion
Electrochemical properties
The chemical structure of SOICs is given in Fig. 1 along with the metal-free sensitizer and general synthesis protocol is presented in Scheme 1. In brief, substitution of the hetero-anthracene donor was done with octyl alkyl chain using sodium hydride. Resultant compounds were formylated using Vilsmeier–Haack synthesis. The formylated product was coupled with o-phenylenediamine to produce substituted benzimidazolium intermediate. Salt formation was done using methyl iodide following substitution of methyl. The structure and purity of the synthesized SOICs compounds were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to investigate the thermal properties of the SOICs.

In Fig. 2(a) shows the TGA curves of the SOICs in the temperature range between 25 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow. There is no weight lost in the SOICs when heated to 100 °C and they only lost 20% of its weight after 120 °C, these imply that the synthesized SOICs have high thermal stability even way beyond the operating temperature of conventional silicon solar cells. The redox potential (Eredox) of the SOICs is a key parameter in defining the photovoltaic device performance, especially for open circuit voltage (Voc), which corresponds to the difference between the TiO2 semiconductor Fermi level (Efb) and Eredox of an electrolyte.30Eredox of SOICs material was estimated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) conducted in acetonitrile (Fig. 2(b)), where three pairs of redox peaks were observed for both electrolytes. The first two pair of redox peaks (1, 1′ and 2, 2′) are assigned to BIMI redox couple (I−/I3−) and third pair (3, 3′) of redox peaks corresponds to the incorporated hetero-anthracene donor group as per our earlier work.14 The Eredox value of both SOICs and bare BIMI are depicted in Table 1 and Eredox value of both SOICs are higher than ground state level of SK3 and indicate the facile path for dye regeneration. Exited level of the electrolytes was also observed to be higher than the LUMO of SK3 and make it possible to donate electron directly to the sensitizer through their donor part (energy level diagram is shown in Scheme S1, of the ESI†). The similar behaviour observed in dye sensitized TiO2 photoanode used as working electrode in CV (Fig. S3†).

The ionic conductivity (σ) of the SOICs was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with FTO-Pt/SOICs/FTO-Pt symmetric dummy cells. Fig. 2(c) shows Nyquist plots of the SOICs. The high-frequency region semicircle represents charge transfer resistance between FTO-Pt/SOICs interface and lower frequency region represents the diffusion resistance of the SOICs redox couple.31 Extracted bulk resistance Rs from Nyquist plot are used in the calculation of conductivity eqn (1), and resultant parameters tabulated in Table 1. σ = (d/Rs)A(1)where A in cm3, d in cm and Rs Ohm are denoted the active area, distance between the two FTO-Pt electrodes and resistance of SOICs, respectively. POZ donor moiety based SOIC-1 has the smallest Rs, corresponding to the higher σ value 4.3 mS cm−1 and SOIC-2 slightly lower σ value 3.8 mS cm−1. On the basis of these results, the SOICs have increased the conductivity by two-fold as compared to our previously reported benzimidazolium iodide based SJE-1 and SJE-2 solid ionic conductors.14 Influence of SOICs thickness on conductivity shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The main contribution of the σ of BIMI based SOICs comes from the electron transport along the polyiodide chain according to the relay type Grotthuss mechanism.32 The temperature (T) vs. σ of the SOICs graph shown in Fig. 2(d). The σ enhance with the T following the Arrhenius eqn (2) σ = σ0exp(−Ea/KT)(2)where Ea, K and σ0 are the activation energy, Boltzmann constant, and constant value, respectively.33 The linear behavior of 1/T vs. lnσ indicates that these SOICs are ionic conductive and ions transport by Grotthuss mechanism. Both SOICs ionic conductivity increases with increasing temperature. The smaller Ea denotes that lower slope of the lnσ on 1/T, the energy barrier that must be overcome for ion transport (Table 1). According to the literature, a lower distance between I− to polyiodide ions enhance the Grotthuss exchange mechanism and do the faster charge transfer.33,34
The confirmation of I−, I3− and polyiodide ions, measured from Raman spectroscopy of SOICs (Fig. S5†). Raman spectroscopy was carried to characterize both electrolytes. Raman peaks of 101, 146 and 243 cm−1 are obtained and they are assigned to the stretch mode of I3− (symmetric), a stretch mode of I5− and I3− overtone, respectively. In SOICs, the concentration of iodide is much higher than the triiodide and the diffusion of triiodide is also a limiting factor for the performance of ss-DSSCs.35,36 The triiodide diffusion coefficient of SOICs and BIMI calculated from steady-state voltammogram are shown in Fig. S6† and the values are depicted in Table 1. The apparent diffusion coefficients (Dapp) of iodide/triiodide calculated from the steady-state current (anodic–cathodic) Iss by the following eqn (3); (3)where F, n, C and A are the Faraday constant, number of electrons per molecule, iodide/triiodide concentration, and radius of the microelectrode, respectively. The similar trend was observed in Dapp (I3−) and conductivity as well. Noticeably, The Dapp of I3− for SOIC-1 and 2 are higher than BIMI. Particularly, the value of Dapp (I3−) for SOIC-1 (3.65 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) higher than that of SOIC-2 (3.01 × 10−6 cm2 s−1). As per our previous report, we noted that triiodide concentration more required into solid ionic conductors for ions transfer via Grotthus mechanism.33
Theoretical study
DFT calculation helps in better understanding the SOICs anion and cation interaction, as well as which types of bonding, are available in electrolytes.
Geometry optimization of SOIC-1, SOIC-2 and BIMI were carried out by using B3LYP functional and LanL2Dz basis set. B3LYP functional is Becke's three parameters hybrid exchange functional couple with nonlocal correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr.37,38 Usually, low molecular weight atoms (i.e. carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, etc.) optimization occur by 6-31G(d,p) basis set, while higher atomic number present atom optimized using LanL2Dz higher basis set required.39 Because of large atomic number of I2 atom, 6-31G (d,p) basis set is incapable of predicting the accurate structure and optical spectrum of SOICs. Energy minimization, absorbance spectrum and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) were calculated at the B3LYP set. The optimized SOIC-1, SOIC-2 and BIMI are determined at B3LYP/LanL2Dz (SK3 dye optimized by 6-31G (d,p)) level of computational are shown in (Fig. 3(a–d)). Same side BIMI cation arrangement is more stable and its optimization energy is depicted in Table 1.

The optimized structure bond length of N–C, N–I, N–C–N and dihedral angles of BIMI cation with PTZ/POZ donor moieties (C13–C12–C14 and C35–C34–C36) values are tabulated in Fig. S7 and Table S1.† From Table S1,† BIMI cation and anion (I−) distance decreases after PTZ/POZ were substituted on BIMI. The lower distance between cation and anion enhanced the ionic conductivity as well as charge transport property. The role of hetero-anthracene (PTZ and POZ) donor group in BIMI cation was investigated by Time-dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT).40Fig. 3(e), shows a comparison of Mulliken charge present on “N” atom between SOICs and BIMI. The individual of all Mulliken charges in a vacuum are given in Fig. S8(a–c).† The BIMI contain nitrogen atom cationic charge increasing after substitution of PTZ and POZ donor groups. In order to further understand the influence of hetero-anthracene on BIMI, UV-visible spectra were carried out by TD-DFT techniques. The unsubstituted BIMI electrolytes absorb maxima is 359 nm and after substituted with POZ and PTZ groups of SOIC-1 is 435 nm and SOIC-2 is 404 nm (Fig. S9†). It's means that the donor moiety substitution on BIMI changes the physical properties and works as a light harvesting material as well.
Photovoltaic and photophysical discussion
To study the photovoltaic properties of the SOICs, they were used to fabricate ss-DSSCs devices in combination with the metal-free carbazole based SK3 dye. The photocurrent voltage characteristic was performed under 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G sunlight illumination and dark condition are presented in Fig. 4(a–b). We have examined the effect of solid electrolyte pore filling in different TiO2 photoanode thickness (8 and 12 μm) corresponding to bare BIMI and SOICs on ss-DSSCs performance.

J–V characteristics in the (a) light condition, (b) dark condition and (c) IPCE curves of 8 μm thick TiO2 photoanode with SOICs and BIMI electrolytes based ss-DSSCs. 
In the 8 μm thick TiO2 photoanode based devices, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and photocurrent efficiency (PCE) with SOIC-1 and 2 are Jsc = 16.21 mA cm−2, Voc = 739 mV, PCE = 7.90% and Jsc = 13.87 mA cm−2, Voc = 735 mV, PCE = 6.8%, respectively. The lower PCE of the BIMI based ss-DSSC has a PCE of 4.62% (Jsc = 9.59 mA cm−2, Voc = 775 mV and FF = 64%) indicates the superiority of SOICs. The SOIC-1 and 2 are superior compared with reference electrolyte BIMI, especially in PCE and Jsc. However, the Voc value is lower due to the difference in redox potential value and effect of electrolyte on the flat band potential of TiO2. The J–V curves of ss-DSSCs with 12 μm thickness TiO2 photoanode are shown in Fig. S10† and Table 2. M. D. McGehee et al., reported the decreasing of TiO2 thickness will enhance pore filling which will lead to controlled charge recombination with increasing maximum dye regeneration and improves PCE of devices.41 In our case optimized TiO2 thickness 8 μm, showed a ∼12% increase in PCE compared to 12 μm thick TiO2 photoanode.

Fig. 4(b) shows the dark J–V profile for same devices of 8 μm thick TiO2 film, as expected SOICs based device have lower dark current and Voc than BIMI based device. These results suggest the reduced recombination between dye/TiO2 to electrolyte interface. The single component SOICs, SOIC-1 and 2 (without additives), achieved PCE of 6.0% (Jsc = 12.50 mA cm−2, Voc = 728 mV, FF = 65%) and 5.60% (Jsc = 11.53 mA cm−2, Voc = 720 mV, FF = 66%), respectively (Fig. 5). As per our earlier work,12 the fabricated ss-DSSCs devices without the use of PTZ/POZ substituted BIMI exhibited poor efficiency compared to SOICs. Here we report the highest PCE of single component SOICs is quite comparable with conventional liquid and solid state electrolytes used in DSSCs. The single component J–V characteristics observed high Jsc and PCE in ss-DSSCs with SOIC-1, because it has higher conductivity and faster charge transfer than SOIC-2. In Fig. S11,† solid cyclic voltammetry was carried out using single component SOICs in two platinum electrode based dummy cells. Both SOICs show typical oxidation (I−/I3−) and reduction (I3−/I−) peaks current respectively. The high current peak of SOIC-1 (61.7 μA cm−2 and 60.0 μA cm−2) compared to SOIC-2 (41.9 μA cm−2 and 53.6 μA cm−2) indicates higher charge transfer between the polyiodide chain. These charge transfer trend supports the conductivity and J–V characteristic measurements.

Enhancement in photocurrent. 
The conversion efficiency from incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength is shown in Fig. 4(c) and single component SOICs IPCE curve are presented in Fig. 5(b). The IPCE value in the visible spectrum range is indeed the reflection of the SK3 dye regeneration rate in various SOICs based photovoltaic devices. The IPCE value is related to Jsc at a specific wavenumber and power input (Pin) and it is expressed in eqn (4),42 (4)
SOIC-1 produces the highest IPCE value (79%) compared to SOIC-2 (67%) and BIMI (47%) from 350 nm to 660 nm. The same trend is shown in solid UV-visible spectra because hetero-anthracene substituted SOIC-1 and 2 and metal free SK 3 dye have strong absorption in the region of 350 to 650 nm. In Fig. 6(a) onset, UV-visible spectra of SOIC-1, SOIC-2 and metal free dye SK3 on TiO2 surface given λmax are 423 nm, 417 nm and 472 nm, respectively. Deposition was done layer by layer (SOICs + SK3 on TiO2) to enhance all over the spectrum and cover 300 to 650 nm range. This result indicates that hetero-anthracene based donor group is acting as a light-harvesting material. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) in pure SOIC-1 and SOIC-2 are 30076 M−1 cm−1 and 29766 M−1 cm−1, respectively (liquid UV shown in Fig. 6(a)). SOICs after contact with metal-free SK 3 dye (SOIC-1 = 48733 M−1 cm−1, SOIC-2 = 44166 M−1 cm−1) molar extinction coefficient is increasing, the value of ε are summarised in Table S2.† Hence, we clearly observe the effect on J–V and IPCE measurement to enhance Jsc and PCE of SOICs based ss-DSSCs.

Decrement in Voc. 
The Voc is the difference between the flat band potentials (Efb) of TiO2 and redox potential of the electrolyte. The possible visual reason for low Voc in SOICs based devices is due to the low distance of voltage gap between redox potential and Efb of TiO2 (Scheme S1†). To get insight on the effect of electrolytes on Efb of TiO2, Mott–Schottky analysis was performed with electrolyte coated photoanodes. The MS behaviour of the dye sensitized TiO2 film with different electrolytes (BIMI, SOIC-1 and SOIC-2) were obtained to determine their flat-band potential (Vfb) as shown in Fig. 6(b). The Voc of the cells is determined from the redox potential in the electrolyte and the quasi Fermi level, which increases linearly with Vfb. The Vfb was calculated on extrapolating the straight lines to the x-axis (1/C2 = 0). In Fig. 6(b) indicate the SOICs electrolytes shows Efb about 0.5 V positive than bare BIMI.
The influence of various light intensities on the photovoltaic performance of the ss-DSSCs with SOIC-1 and 2 was measured under simulated sunlight with 0.2 to 1 Sun. J–V characteristics and parameters are shown in Fig. S12 and Table S3.† With the increase in light intensity, Jsc, Voc and PCE will increase as well. The linear increment of Jsc is attributed to the enhanced excited dye electron interaction and increasing charge carrier injections from the sensitizer to TiO2 conduction band. As a result, the overall PCE can be kept at a comparable level and this feature ensures that SOICs based ss-DSSCs device can be applied in various conditions.

Impedance spectroscopy and electron lifetime
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of ss-DSSCs with SOIC-1 and 2 were carried out under dark condition at open circuit voltage (Fig. 7(a)).

EIS Nyquist plots of ss-DSSCs with SOICs exhibit two semicircles, which are assigned in the order of lower frequency arc indicate TiO2 semiconductor/SK3 dye/SOICs interface and higher frequency arc is FTO-Pt electrode/SOICs interface.43,44 The Fig. 7(a) inset shown equivalent circuit fitting to obtain electron transport parameters such as charge transfer resistance (Rct), constant phase element (CPE-P) and charge recombination resistance (Rrec) are depicted in Table 3.

The FTO-Pt/SOICs interface, Rct value subtle difference due to the same back electrode used in all devices. The Rrec value of the ss-DSSCs with SOIC-1 (123 Ω) is higher compare to SOIC-2 (116 Ω) and BIMI (96 Ω) devices. These results indicate that the recombination resistance hindered between TiO2/dye/SOIC-1 and given higher PCE of ss-DSSCs. Moreover, interface resistance reduced with the ss-DSSCs based on POZ donor substituent on BIMI (SOIC-1), since the lower interface resistance of SOICs will make electron transfer easier from the TiO2 conduction band to FTO, the current density of ss-DSSCs increased. The EIS parameters in Table 3 were calculated with the eqn (5)–(7); (5) (6) (7)where, KB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1), q is charge of the electron, τn is electron lifetime, ns is steady state electron density in the TiO2 conduction band.23 The τn of our ss-DSSCs were calculated using eqn (5) and the following order is obtained: SOIC-1 (0.52 ms) > SOIC-2 (0.44 ms) > BIMI (0.40 ms). As mentioned above, ns, which denotes the steady state electron density in the TiO2 implies that if this value is high, the number of electrons injection into TiO will be high. According to Table 3, ss-DSSCs with SOIC-1 electrolyte has the highest ns indicating that dye exciton electron transfer to the conduction band of TiO2 to FTO is very fast and resulted in a higher photocurrent.
Open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD) analysis was conducted to investigate the recombination kinetics of photoanode and SOICs interface. From Fig. S13 (ESI†), OCVD curves were measured during relaxation from the illuminated equilibrium state to dark equilibrium. The light illuminates in ss-DSSCs, excess electrons are removed due to recombination and with photovoltage decay rate directly related to τe. Fig. 7(b) given electron lifetime curves are calculated from OCVD (Fig. S11†), using eqn (8).45 (8)where, KB, e, (dVoc/dt) and T is Boltzmann constant, positive elementary charge the derivation of Voc and temperature. In comparison to SOICs and BIMI electrolytes measurement, the SOIC-1 based ss-DSSCs exhibit the much higher τn value compared to SOIC-2 and BIMI electrolyte. This results conclude that the recombination rate of photo-generated electrons with SOICs oxidized species is higher in the ss-DSSCs inbuilt with SOIC-1.
Conclusion
We have designed and synthesized hetero-anthracene (PTZ/POZ) substituted BIMI based solid organic ionic conductors (SOICs) which have been used as an electrolyte in ss-DSSCs. The influence of PTZ/POZ donor moiety substituted with BIMI, has increased the cationic effect, ionic conductivity and thermal stability. SOICs possesses higher conductivity compared to the unsubstituted BIMI. The SOICs that consist of substituted hetero-anthracene donor moiety and BIMI ionic salt act as both light harvester and redox mediator. In order to confirm the dual nature of SOICs, the photo-physical and electrochemistry based techniques were carried out. SOICs chemical structure optimization and optical spectra influence are calculated by density functional theory (DFT) and to support the experimental data. The optimized thickness of TiO2 photoanode has improved solid electrolyte pore filling and PCE. The SOIC-1 electrolyte based ss-DSSCs gave the highest PCE of 7.86% with the 8 μm thick TiO2 film. Here, reported PCE is quite comparable with conventional liquid electrolytes. Single component (without additive) electrolytes achieved highest PCE is 6.0% for POZ based SOIC-1. We have also shown that the ss-DSSCs photo-response with different light intensity 0.2 to 1 Sun. The synthesized dual function organic ionic conductors open a new way to develop single component solid electrolytes for the ss-DSSCs.
