    , Accepted 4th April 2019First published on 5th April 2019AbstractControllable synthesis of tin-doped all-inorganic perovskite (e.g. CsPb1−XSnXBr3) nanocrystals while maintaining tin at the divalent state is of great importance for tuning their optoelectronic properties by changing the chemical composition and geometrical size; however, this remains a non-negligible challenge. In contrast to the conventional high-temperature (>150 °C) synthesis reaction that would more likely facilitate oxidation of divalent Sn2+ to quadrivalent Sn4+, this work demonstrates a facile low-temperature (105–150 °C) hot-injection method to synthesize quantum-confined Sn2+-doped CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals with sizes ranging from ∼6.2 nm to ∼8.3 nm depending on the reaction temperature. The optimized reaction temperature of 135 °C led to a Sn2+-doping ratio of 3.4% in CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals which exhibited uniform nanoplatelets with an average lateral size of ∼7.4 nm. Furthermore, for the first time, we show that the perovskite nanocrystals are promising for the development of low-cost and trap-assisted photomultiplication UV-photodetectors, and the photodetectors based on CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystals exhibited wavelength-dependent detectivities in the magnitude of 1011 Jones for UV light extending from 310 nm to 400 nm at a reverse bias of −7 V. The high EQE of ∼1940% at around 340 nm indicates that the devices had a gain at the large reverse bias condition, which is attributed to the formation of interfacial traps by CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystals that can make the electron injection barrier thin enough to allow electron tunneling in the photodetectors for photomultiplication.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites, owing to their superior properties including broadly tunable absorption,1 exceptional defect-tolerance,2 and long carrier diffusion length,3,4 have been at the forefront of optoelectronic functional materials for low-cost and high-performance optoelectronic devices, e.g. photovoltaic cells (PVs)5–11 and light emitting diodes (LEDs).12–14 Compared to perovskite bulk films that have led to a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7% in single-junction PVs,15 quantum-confined perovskite nanocrystals exhibit unique optical properties such as narrow width of both excitonic absorption and emission spectra along with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY),16 which are essential for LEDs and have resulted in a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ∼20% as reported very recently.17 These high-performance LEDs are based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites that contain organic cations including methylammonium and formamidinium. However, due to the weak hydrogen-bond interactions between hydrogen and halogen in the organic and inorganic components, respectively,18 these hybrid perovskites suffer from decomposition or structural changes under external factors including heat,19,20 water,21,22 and electric fields,23 which would negatively impact potential practical applications. All-inorganic perovskites such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) nanocrystals with theoretically strong ionic bonds are expected to be more robust than the organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts.24 Partial substitution of Pb2+ with tin divalent ions (Sn2+) is a practicable tactic for the modification of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals.25 Sn2+-Doping in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals can tune their optoelectronic properties such as optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL).
A high-temperature reaction (>150 °C) is often demanded in the conventional synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals26–30 to obtain nanocrystals with a variety of geometries such as nanoplatelets and nanocubes.28 However, such a high-temperature reaction facilitates oxidation of divalent Sn2+ to quadrivalent Sn4+,31 leading to the inferior optical and electrical properties of perovskite nanocrystals. It remains a great challenge to obtain CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals with Sn in a divalent state. More importantly, tailoring the chemical composition32 and geometrical size33 of CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals allows efficient tuning of their electronic and optical properties including excitonic absorption spectral peaks and PL characteristics, and enables them to be potential candidates for high-performance photodetectors, which, to the best of our knowledge, is rarely reported.34–40
In this work, we report a facile low-temperature (105–150 °C) hot-injection method to synthesize CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanoplatelets with average lateral sizes extending from ∼6.2 nm to ∼8.3 nm. The quantum-confined CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals exhibit wavelength-selective excitonic absorption peaks and narrow spectral width and PL characteristics. The solution-processed photodetectors based on the synthesized CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystals showed a detectivity in the magnitude of 1011 Jones for UV light ranging from 310 nm to 400 nm at a reverse bias of −7 V, which guaranteed potential to develop sensitive UV-photodetectors.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals
To synthesize CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals, a pre-heated Cs2CO3 precursor solution was quickly injected into a hot mixed solution of PbBr2 and SnBr2 with a molar ratio of 2:1 at a certain temperature and oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA) were used as the ligand and 1-octadecene (ODE) was the solvent. The resulting solution was cooled subsequently using an ice-water bath to obtain perovskite nanocrystals. It is worth noting that the PbBr2 and SnBr2 powder mixture was completely dissolved in ODE at 105 °C. However, as the reaction temperature was raised to 150 °C, the precursor solution started to precipitate and more precipitation resulted at 170 °C. In order to determine whether the precipitation was related to PbBr2 or SnBr2 at elevated reaction temperatures, pure PbBr2 and SnBr2 solutions were heated separately. It was observed that the PbBr2 solution remained dissolved at an increasing temperature up to 190 °C, whereas the SnBr2 solution started to precipitate at 140 °C. Air-sensitive trioctylphosphine (TOP) was previously used as a co-solvent to assist the dissolution of SnBr2 at high temperatures.26,31,41 Here, we applied a rather simple low-temperature (e.g. 105–150 °C) condition instead of TOP to ensure the dissolution of the PbBr2 and SnBr2 mixture.
For the hot-injection method, the reaction temperature is generally varied to tailor the geometrical sizes of nanocrystals that can further govern the wavelength-selectivity of excitonic absorption and PL emissive properties. To understand the temperature-dependent tuning effect, we conducted synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals at a series of relatively low-temperatures between 105 °C and 150 °C, and both the absorption and PL spectra of the obtained nanocrystal solutions are shown in Fig. 1. It was observed that both absorption edges and excitonic absorption peaks exhibited a typical blue-shift with the decreasing reaction temperature from 150 °C to 105 °C (Fig. 1a), which corresponded to the continuous blue-shift of the PL emission peak (Fig. 1b). The 150 °C-synthesized nanocrystals showed a moderately weak excitonic absorption peak while the corresponding PL spectrum was broad with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ∼35 nm and a peak position at ∼507 nm. As the reaction temperature decreased to 135 °C, an apparent excitonic absorption peak appeared at ∼477 nm, accompanied by a narrower PL spectral peak at ∼500 nm with a smaller FWHM of ∼24 nm. With a further decrease in the reaction temperature to 105 °C, the excitonic absorption peak shifted to 470 nm, while the corresponding PL spectral peak shifted to 488 nm. It is noted that the appearance of the excitonic absorption peaks with decreasing reaction temperature is a good indication of the presence of the quantum-confinement effect in perovskite nanocrystals, which agrees well with previous reports on other perovskite nanocrystals (e.g. CsPbI3),42 most likely due to the reduction in the nanocrystal size with decreasing reaction temperature. In order to examine the impact of Sn-doping on the optoelectronic properties of perovskite nanocrystals, we conducted a spectral comparison between Sn-doped and non-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that were synthesized under identical conditions at 135 °C. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows that the Sn-doping led to a slight red-shift in the absorption spectrum, corresponding to a similar red-shift range in the PL emission peak. This observation indicates that the change in the chemical composition (Sn-doping) also contributes to the variation in the absorptive and emissive characteristics of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals.

In order to confirm the presence of quantum-confined perovskite nanocrystals obtained by our low-temperature synthesis, high-resolution aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was applied to examine the morphology and microstructure of CsPb1−XSnXBr3 perovskite nanocrystals. As shown in the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images (Fig. 2a–d), perovskite nanocrystals were found to exhibit variable geometries upon changing the reaction temperature. When the reaction temperature was 105 °C, the perovskite nanocrystals showed a variety of geometries including square and rectangular shapes (Fig. 2a). The irregular perovskite nanocrystals displayed an average lateral size of ∼6.2 ± 1.9 nm, which further ensured the presence of the quantum-confined effect in the nanocrystals synthesized at such a low temperature. When the reaction temperature was increased to 120 °C, the nanocrystals still displayed an irregular geometry but the nanocrystal size showed a slight enhancement and the average crystal size reached ∼6.8 ± 3.9 nm (Fig. 2b). Upon further increasing the reaction temperature to 135 °C, the perovskite nanocrystals started to exhibit a uniform square shape with an average lateral size of about ∼7.4 ± 2.1 nm (Fig. 2c). We observed that a higher reaction temperature of 150 °C resulted in non-uniformity but a slight enhancement to ∼8.3 ± 4.8 nm in the nanocrystal size (Fig. 2d). The HAADF–STEM images revealed that the change in the sizes of nanocrystals prepared at different temperatures was a cause of the variation of both the absorption and PL spectra. Additionally, the obtained nanocrystal solutions turned from light green to dark blue under excitation by a 365 nm laser (inset images of Fig. 2a–d), which is consistent with the observation of PL spectral peaks at 488–507 nm for nanocrystals synthesized at 105–150 °C. The noticeable lattice fringes in individual nanocrystals as unveiled by the high-resolution bright-field TEM images (Fig. 2e), alongside the corresponding electron diffraction patterns (inset of Fig. 2e), apparently demonstrated the single crystalline feature of perovskite nanocrystals. Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the synthesis temperature, doping ratio, nanocrystal size, and standard deviation for each condition. To reveal the impact of Sn-doping on the nanocrystal morphology, we obtained HAADF images of the non-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that were synthesized under identical conditions at 135 °C to those of the Sn-doped counterparts. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals without Sn-doping display a similar size of about 7.6 ± 3.4 nm and less uniform size distribution compared to the Sn-doped CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. This observation confirms that the blue-shift of both the absorption and PL spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†) is mainly caused by the Sn-doping, rather than the size effect.

(g) The height of perovskite nanocrystals revealed by the AFM topography image and lateral line scans crossing a region that contains nanocrystals. (h) Line scans A–D are marked in the AFM topography image (g), showing that the average height of nanocrystals is ∼2.0 nm. (e) and (g) were taken from the sample prepared at 135 °C. 
The good crystallinity of perovskite nanocrystals was further confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization, which revealed evident X-ray reflection peaks at around 2θ = 15.2°, 21.5°, 30.7°, 37.7°, and 43.9° (Fig. 2f) for CsPbBr3. It is noted that the XRD pattern of the perovskite nanocrystals obtained at the low reaction temperature of 105 °C matches well with the XRD pattern of standard CsPbBr3 (PDF# 54-0752) whereas higher reaction temperatures (120 °C and 135 °C) resulted in a slight shift to lower 2θ angles followed by a shift back to the original state at 150 °C, which could be attributed to the partial substitution of Pb with Sn atoms in the CsPbBr3 lattice as specifically discussed below. In addition to the characterization of the lateral morphology by high resolution TEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM) lateral line scans were conducted to disclose the average height of the nanocrystals, which was estimated to be around 2.0 nm (Fig. 2g and h). This result suggests that the CsPb1−XSnXBr3 perovskite nanocrystals are nanoplatelets rather than nanocubes.
As mentioned above, the shift of X-ray reflection peaks may be due to the partial substitution of Pb with Sn in the lattice of CsPbBr3. However, it is still unclear whether and how much Sn was doped into the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals by XRD measurements. To prove this possible scenario and quantify the doping ratio of Sn in the CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals, X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the obtained perovskite nanocrystals. Additionally, since the divalent Sn2+ ions are possibly oxidized to quadrivalent Sn4+ during the synthesis process, it is important to understand whether Sn is in the divalent state in CsPb1−XSnXBr3 perovskite nanocrystals by performing XPS. As shown in Fig. 3a, we observed XPS spectral peaks at 724.4 eV and 738.3 eV for Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2, respectively, indicating the existence of Cs in perovskite nanocrystals. In addition, the respective XPS spectral peaks at 138.7 eV and 143.5 eV can be assigned to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 (Fig. 3b), signifying the presence of Pb. The presence of Br was further demonstrated by XPS spectral signals at 181.9 eV and 188.6 eV for Br 3p3/2 and Br 3p1/2, respectively (Fig. 3c). It is important to note that the XPS spectral signals for Sn were not observed in the perovskite nanocrystals obtained at 105 °C, which means that little Sn was doped into the perovskite nanocrystals at such a low temperature. However, with increasing reaction temperature, we observed the presence of Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 XPS peaks at 487.1 eV and 495.6 eV, respectively. This evidence suggests that Sn is not only present in the perovskite nanocrystals but also in the divalent state as Sn2+ in CsPb1−XSnXBr3, rather than as quadrivalent Sn4+. This observation is significant since previous studies showed that the Sn2+ was oxidized to Sn4+ while using high-temperature synthesis.31 In our case, the Sn2+ was obtained without any noticeable oxidization as the reaction temperature was decreased significantly. The Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 XPS signals appeared when the reaction temperature was increased to 120 °C (Fig. 3d). The quantitative analysis of XPS signals between Pb and Sn reveals that as the reaction temperature was increased to 135 °C, the XPS spectral intensity for Sn 3d peaks was enhanced apparently, corresponding to a doping ratio of 3.4% and a formula of CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3. However, further increase in the reaction temperature to 150 °C led to the disappearance of XPS spectral signals for Sn 3d, indicating that Sn failed to be doped into the perovskite nanocrystals, most likely due to the decreased solubility of SnBr2 at such a high reaction temperature as discussed above. It should be pointed out that a slight shift to lower energy was observed for the XPS spectral signals of Cs, Pb and Br in the 150 °C synthesized sample. The possibility of the oxidation state change of Cs, Pb and Br is unlikely since our sample was prepared in a N2 environment. We tentatively attribute such shifts to the nanocrystal size effect. HAADF images (Fig. 2a–d) show that the nanocrystal size increases with temperature, leading to the increased symmetry in the bond arrangement and thus lower pressure (or smaller binding energy) on the chemical elements such as Cs, Pb and Br in this work. Therefore, a smaller energy is required to eject electrons as reflected by the shift of the XPS spectral signal to lower energy.

2.2. Photodetector performance
As mentioned previously, quantum-confined perovskite nanocrystals are suitable for LEDs due to the narrow width of the wavelength-selective emission spectra along with a high photoluminescence quantum yield.17 However, the composition- and size-dependent excitonic absorption spectral characteristics also make them promising for high-performance photodetectors. In order to assess the practicability of CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals to develop low-cost and optical-sensitive photodetectors, the optimized CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystals synthesized at 135 °C were used to fabricate photodetectors which had a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3:PMMA/PC60BM/C60/BCP/Al. A cross-section SEM image is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) to reveal the thickness of each layer in our device. In order to reduce leakage current of the photodetectors, a small amount (2 vol%) of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was blended into the nanocrystals to assist the formation of continuous and compact films. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows short current density–voltage (J–V) curves that were measured in the dark and under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). To reveal the photocurrent generation sources of the device, the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), two peaks at 340 nm and 445 nm were observed from the bias-free external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve, which is similar to the absorption curves of C60 and PC60BM films (Fig. S6, ESI†). Thus, the photocurrent was primarily contributed by C60 and PC60BM. In addition, the bias-free EQE curve displayed a shoulder peak at ∼479 nm (Fig. S5, ESI†) which is the excitonic absorption peak position of CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystal films (Fig. S6, ESI†). Therefore, CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystals partially contributed to the photocurrent generation of the device. As shown in Fig. 4a, with increasing magnitude of the applied reverse bias, the EQEs at the wavelength of around 340 nm showed a monotonical enhancement and saturated at −9 V. Fig. S7 (ESI†) displays the zoomed-in EQE curves which were obtained from 0 to −4 V. It was observed that the EQE values were beyond 100% as the reverse bias was increased to −5 V and the EQE was found to be ∼1940% at a wavelength of around 340 nm and a bias of −9 V. This evidence suggests that the devices showed a gain at the large reverse bias condition. In order to understand the origin of the gain, we compared the variation of EQE curves with the changing bias for the devices with and without a layer of CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3:PMMA blend. As shown in Fig. 4b, the maximum EQE was smaller than 60% for the device that did not have a layer of CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3:PMMA blend, indicating that the gain originates from CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3:PMMA. Furthermore, we prepared a PMMA-only layer device where the perovskite nanocrystal was not present. Interestingly, the maximum EQE was still only around 20% signifying the absence of the photomultiplication effect in these devices (Fig. 4c). Therefore, the gain originates from CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 perovskite nanocrystals, rather than PMMA. In order to clarify the photomultiplication mechanism in our trap-assisted photodetector devices, Fig. 4d and e illustrates the device working mechanism at reverse bias in the dark and under illumination. Previous studies have shown that such a photomultiplication effect is due to the formation of interfacial traps in the devices,43,44 In the dark, the electron injection barrier between PVK and PC60BM is too large to allow the electron tunneling from PVK to PC60BM. However, under illumination, the CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystals can act as hole traps. As the CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystals were located between PVK and PC60BM, the trapped holes should cause a large band-bending in PC60BM which makes the electron injection barrier thin enough to allow electron tunneling from PVK to PC60BM, leading to the photomultiplication and gain under large electric fields. In addition, the EQE peak at 445 nm exhibited an evident red-shift with increasing reverse bias from −6 V to −9 V, which is likely attributable to the enhanced charge collection from trap states in PC60BM and/or C60 under large electric fields.45,46 In order to assess whether Sn has a positive or negative influence on the photodetectors, we have prepared a reference device sample based on the Sn-free nanocrystals which were synthesized at 135 °C. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the variation of EQE curves with increasing magnitude of reverse bias for the devices based on Sn-free nanocrystals. It was observed that the Sn-free nanocrystal-based device also had a gain but the maximum EQE of ∼275% was significantly lower than that of the Sn-doped counterparts, leading to the lower optical detectivity. This result indicates that the Sn-doping has a positive influence on the device performance of the photodetectors, which is most likely attributed to the easier formation of traps for Sn2+-doped nanocrystals than Sn-free nanocrystals since the divalent Sn2+ can be oxidized to the quadrivalent Sn4+.31

(d and e) Illustration of the device work mechanism at the reverse bias condition in the dark (d) and under illumination (e) to show interfacial traps formed at interfaces by perovskite nanocrystals for large band-bending that makes the electron injection barrier thin enough to allow electron tunneling from PVK to PC60BM. (f) Wavelength dependent detectivity measured at −7 V. (g) The transient photocurrent curve showing the rise and decay behavior of the device measured at a frequency of 130 Hz and an applied bias of −7 V, and exponential fit for the decay part (blue curve) suggesting a decay time of 144 μs. The response time was estimated to be 1163 μs by the time interval between 10% and 90% of the maximum photocurrent of the rising portion of the curve. 
To understand the ability of the device to measure optical signals, the wavelength-dependent photoresponsivity was obtained according to the following eqn (1). (1)where q is the elemental charge, λ is the optical wavelength, h is the Planck constant, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. The variation in the trend of photoresponsivity curves of the device is similar to that of the EQE curves, and the maximum photoresponsivity was found to be ∼5 A W−1 (Fig. S9, ESI†). Based on the obtained photoresponsivity and dark current density (Jd), the specific detectivity (D*) was estimated according to the following eqn (2). (2)The maximum D* was found in the magnitude of 1011 Jones for light ranging from 310 nm to 550 nm at a reverse bias of −7 V (Fig. 4f), which is comparable to or better than most of the perovskite photodetectors.34–39 The D* showed little enhancement when the magnitude of reverse bias was larger than −7 V, most likely due to the severe leakage current (large dark current) as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Notably, our devices were rather sensitive to UV light as suggested by D* in the magnitude of 1011 Jones for UV light extending from 310 nm to 400 nm. Such a feature is more obvious with increasing magnitude of reverse bias as suggested by the merging of the apparent double peaks into a nearly single peak with the peak maxima D* of ∼4 × 1011 Jones at 340 nm (Fig. 4f), which is a good indication for sensitive UV-photodetectors. In order to evaluate the response speed of the photodetector device, we conducted transient photocurrent measurements to illustrate the rise and decay behavior with response to the illumination by a 405 nm laser at a frequency of 130 Hz and an applied bias of −7 V. The response time was determined by the time interval between 10% and 90% of the maximum photocurrent of the rising portion of the photoresponse curve. As shown in Fig. 4g, the device exhibited a response time of 1163 μs, which is similar to those of the other perovskite photodetectors.36,40 The exponential fit for the decay curve suggested a decay time of 144 μs. The single decay channel is most likely attributed to the recombination of photogenerated charges at the perovskite nanocrystal/PC60BM interfaces.47
3. Conclusions
We have demonstrated a facile low-temperature (105–150 °C) hot-injection method to grow quantum-confined Sn2+-doped CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals that are tunable in geometrical sizes ranging from ∼6.2 nm to ∼8.3 nm by changing the reaction temperature to tune their absorptive and emissive characteristics. High-resolution STEM combined with XPS measurements revealed that 135 °C was the optimized reaction temperature that led to uniform nanoplatelets with an average lateral size of ∼7.4 nm and a Sn2+-doping ratio of ∼3.4% in CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals. We further showed that the size-tunable quantum-confined CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals are promising for low-cost and trap-assisted photomultiplication UV-photodetectors, which (based on CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystals) exhibited detectivities in the magnitude of 1011 Jones for UV light extending from 310 nm to 400 nm at a reverse bias of −7 V. As the high EQE of ∼1940% at around 340 nm indicates a gain in the device at the large reverse bias condition, we performed a comparative study between the devices with and without a layer of CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3:PMMA blend, which revealed that the gain is attributable to the formation of interfacial traps by CsPb0.966Sn0.034Br3 nanocrystals that can cause a large band-bending in PC60BM to allow electron tunneling. Interestingly, the Sn-doping has a positive influence on the device performance of the photodetectors, which is most likely attributed to the easier formation of traps for Sn2+-doped nanocrystals than Sn-free nanocrystals. We note that the chemical composition and geometrical size of CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals could potentially impact device performance due to their different absorptive and emissive characteristics. In addition, both the composition and size of CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals play an important role in determining the physical properties of interfacial traps and thus the magnitude of photomultiplication and gain in our devices. Further systematic studies are still needed to elucidate the role of both Sn2+- doping and the geometrical size of CsPb1−XSnXBr3 nanocrystals in governing the photodetection performance.
4. Experimental methods
Synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals
A Cs-oleate precursor was prepared by mixing 8 mL 1-octadecene (ODE), 0.1629 g (0.5 mmol) cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, Adamas, 99.9%) and 0.5 mL oleic acid (OA, Adamas, 90%) in a 25 mL 3-neck flask. The mixed solution was first heated at 120 °C for at least 30 min in a N2 environment to remove water. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 150 °C and maintained for 30 min. And then, the obtained Cs-oleate precursor solution was cooled down to 120 °C in a N2 environment for the following synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals. On the other hand, 40 mL ODE, 0.368 g (1 mmol) lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, Adamas, 99%) and 0.138 g (0.5 mmol) tin(II) bromide (SnBr2, Alfa, 99.4%) were blended in a 100 mL 3-neck flask, and then 4 mL OA and 4 mL oleylamine (OLA, Adamas, 90%) were added. Similarly, the mixed solution was heated to 120 °C for at least 1 hour in a N2 environment to remove water. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 105–150 °C and maintained for 30 min. As the desired reaction temperature was stabilized between 105 °C and 150 °C, the 3.2 mL as-prepared Cs-oleate precursor solution was quickly injected. After reaction for about 5 seconds, the 3-neck flask was cooled using an ice-water bath. The crude solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm to remove large particles. The supernatant solution and methyl acetate (MeOAc, Sinopharm, 98%) were blended at a volume ratio of 1:3. After centrifuging the mixed solution at 11000 rpm for 10 min, the precipitates were collected to wash off reaction residues with a mixed solution (3 mL, hexane:acetone = 4:1 by volume ratio) and MeOAc (6 mL). Finally, the precipitate was dissolved in 5 mL hexane and centrifuged again at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant nanocrystal solution was obtained and stored in a N2-filled glove box for further characterization and device fabrication.
Characterization of perovskite nanocrystals
The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra of perovskite nanocrystal solutions were recorded using a Thermo scientific Evolution 201 UV–visible spectrophotometer at room temperature. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a Horiba iHR320 spectrometer in a dark environment, excited by a 337 nm continuum laser. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were carried out using a JEOL ARM200F microscope which was equipped with a probe-forming spherical-aberration corrector. The operating voltage was 200 kV. The aperture size used in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) is about 10 μm, corresponding to 120 nm in the image plane. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Bruker D8 ADVANACE X-ray diffractometer with a Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) source. The operating voltage and current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The AFM images were obtained with a Nano Scope Analysis using a Bruker Icon atomic force microscope. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted using an STARPES system (SPECS) with a monochromatic SPECS XR-MF Microwave X-ray source (Al Kα = 1486.7 eV). The cross-section SEM images were obtained on a device sample using a Helios NanoLab G3 UC double beam electron microscope with an operating voltage of 5 kV.
Device fabrication
Clean ITO glass substrates were initially treated by UV–ozone for 10 min. The PEDOT:PSS solution (Heraeus 4083, filtered with a 0.45 μm PVDF filter) was then spin-coated onto ITO glasses at 3000 rpm for 60 seconds. The samples were subsequently baked at 135 °C for 20 min and transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. Polyvinylcarbazole (PVK) solution (dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene for 30 mg mL−1 solution) was spun cast at 4000 rpm for 20 seconds, followed by a thermal annealing treatment at 100 °C for 1 hour. The as-synthesized perovskite nanocrystal solutions were blended with a small amount (2 vol%) of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, dissolved in trichloromethane, 10 mg mL−1). The mixed solution was spin-coated onto the PVK layer at 600 rpm for 25 seconds, followed by a thermal annealing treatment at 110 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) solution (20 mg mL−1 in DCB) was spin-coated onto the perovskite nanocrystals: PMMA active layer at 6000 rpm for 30 seconds. The sample was then thermally annealed at 100 °C for 1 hour. And then, 50 nm-thick C60 and 10 nm-thick BCP were sequentially deposited onto the sample layer-by-layer by thermal evaporation with an evaporation rate of 0.3 Å s−1. The devices were finalized by thermal evaporation of a layer of 100 nm-thick alumina (Al) with an evaporation rate of 0.5 Å s−1, and the active area was approximately 4 mm2.
Device characterization
The photoresponse speed was measured using the transient photocurrent setup. The device was connected in series with a 10 Ω resistor which was biased at −7 V with a Keithley 2450 source meter. A 405 nm light pulse at a frequency of 130 Hz was generated by an optical chopper (Stanford Research System). An oscilloscope (LeCroy, HDO4054) was used to record the voltage variation across the resistor.
For the current–voltage (I–V) characterizations, a Newport xenon 300 W lamp was used to provide a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was calibrated with a NIST-certified Si photodiode. The I–V curves were recorded using a Keithley 2636B source meter.
External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were obtained using a QE-R solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (Enli Technology). The EQE was measured at a frequency of 210 Hz. The light intensity was calibrated with a reference NIST-certified Si photodetector. The bias-dependent EQE measurements were conducted by applying reverse bias from 0 to −9 V on the devices directly.
