    , Accepted 29th May 2013First published on 30th May 2013AbstractTwo novel X-shaped organic sensitizers (FNE48 and FNE49) with a quinoxaline bridge have been designed and synthesized. The structural difference between the two sensitizers is the number of anchoring groups. The relationship between the chemical structures and their optoelectronic properties has been systematically investigated. It is found that a broader and more intense charge transfer band is observed for sensitizer FNE48, with a single anchoring group, in comparison to sensitizer FNE49, which contains twin anchoring groups. Consequently, a high power conversion efficiency (η) of 6.2% is achieved for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) based on sensitizer FNE48 using a liquid electrolyte. Moreover, a η of 5.2% is obtained for a quasi-solid-state DSSC based on sensitizer FNE48 and this remains at 100% of the initial value after continuous light irradiation for 1500 h.
Introduction
In the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted ever-increasing attention as potential alternatives for next-generation photovoltaic devices due to their efficient conversion of solar energy to electricity at a low cost.1 The sensitizer is always one of the key components in DSSCs since it exerts a significant influence on the power conversion efficiency as well as the device stability. With great efforts devoted by many investigators, ruthenium complex sensitized DSSCs have reached an overall conversion efficiency of over 11%,2 while zinc-porphyrin co-sensitized DSSCs have reaped an efficiency of 12.3%.3 Concerned with the cost and limited reserves of ruthenium, metal-free organic sensitizers4 have received significant research interest because of their unique advantages, such as being low-cost and environmentally friendly, along with absorption and electrochemical properties which are tunable via suitable molecular tailoring. However, the efficiency values of DSSCs based on metal-free organic dyes are somewhat lower compared with metal-based sensitizers due, in part, to their relatively narrow absorption spectrum.
The power conversion efficiency (η) of a DSSC is determined by the photocurrent density (Jsc), the open circuit photovoltage (Voc), and the fill factor (FF) of the device. To enhance the Jsc value, it is essential to extend the absorption range of the organic sensitizer and harvest sunlight over a broad spectral range. Recently, an auxiliary acceptor group5 was integrated into the traditional D–π–A framework, which consists of a donor and acceptor connected by a π-conjugated bridge. Consequently, a bathochromically shifted absorption band of the organic sensitizer is achieved due to enhanced donor–acceptor interactions, which results in an increased light harvesting efficiency and an improved Jsc value.
However, in order to expand their absorption spectra, most organic sensitizers contain rigid rod structures, which facilitate the formation of intermolecular aggregates. Consequently, the excited electrons in the photoanode will recombine with another oxidized dye molecule.6 Since Voc is related to the conduction band position of TiO2 and the charge recombination rate in DSSCs,7 an interfacial charge carrier recombination may cause a Voc reduction. Therefore, the suppression of dye aggregation is of vital importance for minimizing charge recombination and achieving improvements in Voc values. The introduction of alkyl chains into the dye skeleton, based on thiophene or its derivatives, has proven to be an effective method for improving the performance of DSSCs, since they not only prevent dye aggregation, but also diminish charge recombination between electrons and I3− ions.6 Additionally, the construction of multi-donors8 or multi-acceptors,9 as well as double D–π–A branched dyes with “H”10 or “X”11 shapes, have also proven to be effective methods for reducing intermolecular interactions, retarding charge recombination rates and, therefore, enhancing the Voc parameter.
Recently, we have used quinoxaline to build organic dyes with D–π–A–π–A configurations in order to expand the sensitizer absorption band and improve the performance of DSSCs.12 We have also designed a double D–π–A branched dye with an “X” shape to weaken the intermolecular interactions and reduce the charge recombination rate.11b In this work, in order to combine the advantages of both aspects, quinoxaline units are constructed as bridges, linking two donor–acceptor branches to give X-shaped organic dyes. To the best of our knowledge, the construction of X-shaped organic dyes with an electron acceptor core for use in DSSCs has not been reported yet. In addition to the core skeletons, different numbers of anchoring groups are available to create a tunable interfacial electron transfer.13 Therefore, two novel quinoxaline-based organic sensitizers, FNE48 and FNE49 (Fig. 1), with a single and twin anchoring groups, respectively, have been designed and synthesized. The relationship between the difference in the structure and the optoelectronic properties has been systematically investigated. It is found that a broader and more intense absorption band is observed when the organic sensitizer is tuned from two anchoring groups (FNE49) to single anchoring group (FNE48). As a result, the η value of the DSSC based on FNE48 (η = 6.2%) was superior to the DSSC based on FNE49 (η = 5.3%) using a liquid electrolyte. Moreover, a η of 5.2% has been achieved for a FNE48 based quasi-solid-state DSSC and this remained at 100% of the initial value after continuous light irradiation for 1500 h.

Experimental section
Materials and reagents
Thiophene, 1,2-dithienylethane-1,2-dione, benzothiadiazole, and N-bromosuccinimide were purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd, China. Organic solvents used in this work were purified using standard procedures. Other chemicals and reagents were used as received from their commercial sources without further purification. 4,7-Dibromobenzothiadiazole (1)14 and 5-(4-(bis(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)amino)phenyl)thienyltributylstannane (3)15 (Scheme 1) were prepared according to the literature. Transparent conductive glass (F-doped SnO2, FTO, 15 Ω per square, transmittance of 80%, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) was used as the substrate for the fabrication of the TiO2 thin film electrode.

DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
TiO2 films (12 μm) composed of a 6 μm nanoparticle (20 nm) layer in direct contact with an FTO substrate and a 6 μm light scattering particle (80% 20 nm TiO2 + 20% 100 nm TiO2) layer were fabricated by a screen printing method and used in this study.16 The films were sintered at 500 °C for 2 h to achieve good necking of the neighboring TiO2 particles. The sintered films were then treated with an aqueous 0.05 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. When the TiO2 electrodes had cooled down to around 120 °C, they were dipped into dye solutions (0.3 mM in toluene) and left for 24 h at room temperature in order to achieve complete dye adsorption. The dye-loaded TiO2 film (the working electrode) and Pt-coated FTO (the counter electrode) were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (30 μm) and then sealed together by pressing them under heat. Redox electrolyte (0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile) was introduced through a hole in the counter electrode via suction through another drilled hole. Finally, the two holes were sealed using additional hot melt Surlyn film and covered with a thin glass slide. A quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in a redox solution containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M TBP and 0.6 M DMPImI in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) under heating until all of the solids were dissolved. After introducing the hot gel solution into the internal space of the cell using two holes that were pre-drilled in the back of the counter electrode, a uniform motionless polymer gel layer was formed between the working and the counter electrodes. The holes were then sealed with a Surlyn film and covered with a thin glass slide under heating. The working performance of the DSSCs was tested by recording the current density–voltage (J–V) curves with a Keithley 2400 source meter (Oriel) under the illumination of the simulated AM1.5G solar light of a solar simulator (Oriel-94043A equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5G filter). The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell (Newport 91150). A black mask with aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 was used during measurement to avoid stray light.
Characterizations
UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye solutions and dye-loaded films were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2550PC spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed with an Autolab analyzer using a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell, in a water-free acetonitrile solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M), at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and at room temperature under an argon atmosphere. Dye-adsorbed TiO2 on conductive glass was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene, and all of the potentials mentioned in this work are referenced against a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The film thickness was measured using a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak 150, USA).
Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
Quinoxaline, an electron-deficient group, has been studied as a unique electron acceptor in various conjugated systems and engaged in optoelectronic applications.17 In general, most of the organic semiconductors that have used quinoxaline as a building block are constructed via the 5,8-positions of the aromatic quinoxaline core. Herein, in addition to the 5,8-positions, the 2,3-positions of the quinoxaline unit are also functionalized in order to build up X-shaped organic sensitizers with four arms. By incorporating the solubilizing properties of four hexyloxy groups, the target star-burst organic sensitizers can effectively inhibit the intermolecular aggregation and hence reduce the charge recombination rate, which is beneficial to the performance of DSSCs.
The synthesis of sensitizers FNE48 and FNE49 is shown in Scheme 1. Initially, reduction of dibromobenzothiadiazole 1 (ref. 14) with NaBH4 yielded 3,6-dibromobenzene-1,2-diamine, which was used without purification in a condensation reaction with 1,2-dithienylethane-1,2-dione to yield monomer 2 as pale yellow solid. Subsequently, the key intermediate compound 4 was obtained via a Stille coupling18 with compound 3.15 After refluxing with 1.5 and 5 equivalents of Vilsmeier reagent,19 respectively, the corresponding precursors, i.e., monoaldehyde-substituted derivative 5 and dialdehyde-substituted derivative 6, were produced. The quantitatively introduced aldehyde groups were validated by comparing the integration of the singlet peak at δ = 9.94 ppm and the triplet peak at δ = 3.96 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra, which can be assigned to the aldehyde proton and first methylene protons of the hexyloxy groups, respectively. In the last step, target sensitizers FNE48 and FNE49 were obtained via a Knoevenagel condensation20 with cyanoacetic acid by refluxing in acetonitrile in the presence of piperidine. The chemical structures of the resultant sensitizers with a single and twin anchoring groups were verified using 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy.

Both sensitizers are black in the solid state, but upon being freely dissolved in toluene or chloroform, they produce purple solutions. The absorption spectra of sensitizers FNE48 and FNE49 in toluene are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding photophysical properties are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, FNE48 and FNE49 exhibit two distinct absorption bands with similar shapes, which are close to other previously reported star-burst organic semiconductors based on quinoxaline.21 The absorption band in the ultraviolet region corresponds to the π–π* electron transitions of the conjugated backbone, while the other, covering most of the visible region, can be assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process.22 The absorption spectrum of sensitizer FNE48 displays a maximum absorption at a wavelength of 542 nm, which has a bathochromic shift of 14 nm compared to that of sensitizer FNE49. Most importantly, the ICT band of FNE48 is much broader and more intense when compared with that of FNE49, which indicates that stronger ICT interactions occur in FNE48, which contains a single anchoring group, when compared to FNE49 containing twin anchoring groups. This phenomenon has been reported in other ICT systems when the number of electron-withdrawing groups was increased23 and can probably be explained by the fact that having two competing anchoring groups in sensitizer FNE49 results in a dispersal of the electron push–pull effect and, therefore, a weakening of the ICT interactions.

The absorption spectra of organic sensitizers FNE48 and FNE49 anchored on mesoporous TiO2 films (Fig. 3), exhibit a slight hypsochromic shift of the absorption maxima when compared with the those dissolved in toluene, which could be due to the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid and has been observed for other metal-free organic dyes.12,24 The ICT band for FNE48 on TiO2 film demonstrates a hypsochromic shift of 9 nm in comparison to that for FNE48 in toluene. By contrast, the ICT band of the FNE49-loaded TiO2 film exhibits only unresolved shoulders at around 525 nm, probably due to the absorption band overlapping. However, unlike most reported D–π–A system, where the hypsochromic shift in absorption maximum from the solution to the dye-loaded TiO2 film is much larger,25 the slight hypsochromic shift in this case is obviously due to the additional quinoxaline acceptor. After anchoring the sensitizers onto the TiO2 surface, and despite the anchoring group being deprotonated, the ICT from the electron donor to the inserted quinoxaline unit was not weakened significantly and, therefore, only a slight hypsochromic shift could be observed. This phenomenon is similar to our previously reported organic dyes containing quinoxaline moieties and greatly benefits the light harvesting capability of the target sensitizers.12

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited state of the sensitizer to the CB of TiO2 and also the sensitizer regeneration, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell with TiO2 films stained with sensitizer used as the working electrode in a water-free acetonitrile solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) and at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 4). The first oxidation potentials, corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of sensitizers FNE48 and FNE49, were determined to be −5.31 and −5.36 eV, respectively. These values corresponded to 0.81 and 0.86 V vs. the NHE,26 respectively, which are more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− redox couple (∼0.4 V), indicating that reduction of the oxidized dyes with I− ions is thermodynamically feasible.26a Accordingly, the reduction potentials, corresponding to the LUMO energy levels of sensitizers FNE48 and FNE49, and estimated from HOMO energy levels and the band gap derived from the wavelength at 10% of the maximum absorption intensity for the dye-loaded TiO2 film,1b were calculated to be the same (−3.47 eV, i.e., −1.03 V vs. NHE), ensuring there was enough driving force for the electron injection from the excited state sensitizers to the TiO2 films.26a The energy levels for the two sensitizers are also summarized in Table 1. It was found that, although sensitizers FNE48 and FNE49 consist of identical electron donating and withdrawing groups, the energy levels are slightly affected by the number of anchoring groups.

Solar cell performance
The photovoltaic performance characteristics of FNE48- and FNE49-sensitized DSSCs using liquid electrolyte (0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile) were evaluated under simulated AM1.5G solar light (100 mW cm−2) and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 5, the Jsc, Voc, and FF values for the FNE48-based DSSC are 13.16 mA cm−2, 719 mV, and 0.65, respectively, which correspond to a η of 6.2%. Under the same conditions, the DSSC based on FNE49, with twin anchoring groups, produced a decreased Jsc of 11.64 mA cm−2, compared to the DSSC based on FNE48, with a single anchoring group. Meanwhile, the Voc (724 mV) and FF (0.63) values for the FNE49-based DSSC are close to those for the DSSC based on FNE48. Consequently, the overall conversion efficiency was reduced to 5.3% for the DSSC based on FNE49, which had twin anchoring groups.

In order to analyze the difference between the Jsc values, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of the incident wavelength for the DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE48 and FNE49 in liquid electrolyte are plotted in the inset of Fig. 5. It was found that the IPCE spectrum of the DSSC based on FNE48 exhibits a plateau between 470 and 590 nm with an IPCE value of over 80%, while the FNE49-based DSSC displays an IPCE spectrum with similar plateau, but with slightly decreased maximum. Furthermore, compared with FNE49, FNE48 displays a broader IPCE curve, which is in good agreement with the trends in their absorption spectra both in solution and on the TiO2 film. With such an extended IPCE response, the FNE48-based DSSC provides a higher photo-generated current when compared to the FNE49-based DSSC (Fig. 5).
The other key performance parameter, Voc, is related to the conduction band position of the TiO2 and the charge recombination rate in the DSSCs.7 To explain the close Voc values obtained for the DSSCs based on FNE48 and FNE49, the electron lifetime27vs. charge density28 of the DSSCs was investigated, since the relative conduction band positions are generally identical for DSSCs based on sensitizers with similar chemical structures. The electron lifetime was measured using controlled intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS)29 and obtained from the frequency at the top of the semicircle (fmin) using the relationship: τ = (2πfmin)−1. As shown in Fig. 6, the electron lifetime for both DSSCs based on FNE48 and FNE49 decreases with charge density, following a power law relation with the same slope, which suggests that the same charge recombination mechanism occurs in both DSSCs. Additionally, at fixed charge density, the electron lifetime of the DSSCs based on FNE48 and FNE49 are almost the same. This is not difficult to understand considering that sensitizers FNE48 and FNE49 have similar chemical structures. Consequently, their similar intermolecular interactions lead them to have the same charge recombination rate and, thus, the same electron losses in the open circuit. This results in the same Fermi levels of TiO2, and explains the close Voc values in Fig. 5.

In comparison to the DSSCs using liquid electrolyte, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs30 have shown greatly improved long-term stability, since there is less, or no possible leakage, of the electrolyte. Therefore, in order to create stable DSSCs, quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE48 and FNE49 were fabricated using a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M TBP, 0.6 M DMPImI, and 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in MPN. The J–V curves for the FNE48- and FNE49-based quasi-solid-state DSSCs are shown in Fig. 7. The resultant quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE48 and FNE49 provided Jsc of 12.20 and 9.22 mA cm−2, Voc of 680 and 681 mV, and FF of 0.63 and 0.64, respectively, which correspond to η values of 5.2% and 4.0%, respectively. The photovoltaic performance of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on FNE48 and FNE49 is consistent with the trends seen for the DSSCs constructed using liquid electrolyte discussed above. Furthermore, the stability of the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on FNE48 was recorded over a period of 1500 h under one-sun irradiation conditions. The photovoltaic performance parameters of the sensitizer FNE48 based quasi-solid-state DSSC under one-sun irradiation are illustrated in Fig. 8. It was found that the Jsc and FF values changed slightly (within 6%), while the Voc value remained almost constant. Most importantly, the power conversion efficiency remained at 100% of the initial value after 1500 h of one-sun irradiation, which indicates that the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on sensitizer FNE48 demonstrated good long-term stability.

Conclusions
In summary, two novel quinoxaline-centered X-shaped organic sensitizers with single and twin anchoring groups, respectively, have been designed and successfully synthesized. The key difference between the photophysical characteristics of the two sensitizers is located in their absorption properties, where a broader and more intense ICT band can be observed for sensitizer FNE48, which has the single anchoring group. As a result, the overall conversion efficiency of the DSSC based on FNE48 (η = 6.2%) was superior to the DSSC based on FNE49 (η = 5.3%) when using a liquid electrolyte. Moreover, a η of 5.2% was achieved for a quasi-solid-state DSSC based on sensitizer FNE48, which remained at 100% of the initial value even after continuous light illumination for 1500 h. Our ongoing work is focused on the further optimization of these X-shaped dye structures aimed toward creating highly efficient and stable DSSCs.
