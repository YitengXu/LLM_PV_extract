    , Accepted 18th March 2023First published on 4th April 2023AbstractWe investigate how extending the length of a π-conjugated central A′ core in Acceptor–Donor–Acceptor′–Donor–Acceptor (A–D–A′–D–A)-type non-fused-ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) affects their energy level and the miscibility of donor polymer:NFREA organic solar cells (OSCs). The extended π-conjugated central A′ core increases their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level. We designed and synthesized three NFREAs: BT-4F, which has a benzothiadiazole (BT) core; DTBT-4F, which has two fused thiophene rings on the BT core; and BTST-4F, which has two fused thienothiophene rings on the BT core. In these NFREAs, the LUMO level is upshifted in the order of increasing length of the extended π-conjugated core. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) is related to the gap between the LUMO of the NFREAs and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor polymer, thus, the VOC increased from 0.66 V in a BT-4F-based OSC to 0.81 and 0.84 V in OSCs based on DTBT-4F and BTST-4F, respectively. The PBDB-T donor polymer is more miscible with BTST-4F than with BT-4F and DTBT-4F. The BTST-4F-based blends have a narrower light-absorption range than the PBDB-T:BT-4F blends; however, because of the miscible morphologies of the PBDB-T:BTST-4F blends, the BTST-4F-based devices exhibit a comparable short-circuit current density (JSC) to that of BT-4F-based devices. These results indicate that the introduction of extended π-conjugation of the central core in A–D–A′–D–A-type NFREAs could be an effective method to increase the VOC of NFREA-based devices while maintaining a decent JSC. These results further indicate that introducing an extended π-conjugated central core is a promising design strategy to achieve highly efficient OSCs based on NFREAs.
1. Introduction
Over the past several years, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have attracted considerable attention for use in organic solar cells (OSCs) because of their advantages of an easily controlled chemical structure and tunable optoelectronic and morphological properties that provide excellent opportunities to improve the performance of photovoltaic devices.1–5 With the rapid development of NFA materials, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojunction OSCs have increased by 19%.6–15
ITIC, which is composed of an indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT) donor core and two 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (IC) end-groups, was reported as a pioneering fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA) by Zhan et al. in 2015.16 Since then, numerous FREAs with A–D–A-type structures, where “D” is an electron-donating unit with a ladder-type fused-ring structure and “A” is a strong electron-withdrawing unit as the terminal group, have received considerable attention and have been further developed. As another breakthrough in the field of OSCs, Zou et al. reported an A–DA′D–A-type FREA, Y6, that features a fused-ring core (DA′D) based on electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole (BT).10 In addition, non-fused-ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with A–D–A′–D–A-type structures have been investigated because of their facile synthesis.17–20 Chen et al. reported DF-PCIC, the first NFREA-based OSC with a PCE greater than 10%, in 2018.21 DF-PCIC exhibits a nearly planar structure as a result of H⋯F noncovalent interaction locks between its 2,5-difluorobenzene core and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) D units; thus, its conjugation degree is high. Lee et al. reported BTCPDTO4 with electron-donating alkoxy substitution on the BT core.22 Compared with BTCPDT, which has a H atom on the BT core, BTCPDTO4 exhibited upshifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels; this change was attributed to a decrease in the electron-withdrawing ability resulting from the substitution of an electron-donating group onto the BT core. The upshifted LUMO level increased the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of BTCPDTO4-based devices compared with that of BTCPDT-based devices, resulting in a high PCE of the BTCPDTO4-based devices. Cao et al. reported two NFREAs, BTCIC and BTCIC-4Cl, that differ in their electron-withdrawing terminal groups.23 Compared with chlorinated BTCIC-4Cl, BTCIC showed increased HOMO and LUMO levels and a slightly widened bandgap. When blended with PBDB-T as a donor polymer, the BTCIC-based devices achieved a high VOC of 0.79 V, whereas the BTCIC-4Cl-based devices had a VOC of 0.63 V; the difference was attributed to a high LUMO level of the BTCIC. However, BTCIC-based devices had a lower short-circuit current density (JSC) (18.6 mA cm−2) than BTCIC-Cl4-based devices (23.2 mA cm−2). Chen et al. reported FDNCTF, in which the IC end group of FDICTF was replaced by naphthyl-fused IC as the extended π-conjugated end group.24 Compared with FDICTF, FDNCTF with the extended π-conjugation at the end group not only maintained the LUMO level but also enhanced the light absorption and intermolecular π–π stacking between the end groups. As a result, compared with FDICTF-based devices, FDNCTF-based devices exhibited a slightly improved JSC (16.0 mA cm−2vs. 16.5 mA cm−2) and a substantially increased fill factor (FF) (67.0% vs. 72.7%) while maintaining the VOC, leading to an improved PCE (9.9% vs. 11.2%).25,26
The VOC is associated with the gap between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor; thus, to obtain a high VOC in NFREA-based devices, the NFREA should have a high LUMO to yield a wide bandgap. However, this condition decreases the JSC because of the overlap of the absorption ranges of the NFREAs and the donors. This trade–off relationship between the VOC and JSC has limited the increase in PCE.27,28
As a fundamental molecular design strategy to overcome the trade–off relationship between the VOC and JSC and improve the VOC while maintaining the JSC, we introduced an extended π-conjugated central A′ core by fusing the electron-donating units to a central A′ core as an electron-withdrawing unit into A–D–A′–D–A-type NFREAs. We expected the LUMO levels of the NFREAs to increase because the electron-withdrawing ability of the extended central cores of the NFREAs is weakened by the fused electron-donating units on the electron-withdrawing central core.29
Here, we report our successful design and synthesis of a series of A–D–A′–D–A-type NFREAs, namely BTST-4F, using a BT derivative (BTST) with two fused thienothiophene rings on a BT core as the A′ core (Fig. 1(a)). This A′ core was connected to two cyclopentadithiophenes (CPDTs) substituted by a 2-ethylhexyl alkyl chain as an electron-rich D unit to form a non-fused D–A′–D structure. The branched alkyl chains attached to the CPDT can effectively ensure solubility, planarity, and a favorable morphology while suppressing excessive intermolecular aggregation. As the electron-deficient A unit, 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) was incorporated onto the D–A′–D structure to obtain a non-fused A–D–A′–D–A-type NFREA. We expected this A–D–A′–D–A-type BTST-4F to have a good coplanar structure and a high LUMO energy level because of the large extended A′ core and to exhibit a strong and broad light absorption band because of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect resulting from the combination of a strong electron-accepting A′ (or A) and strong electron-donating D unit.30–32 To clearly demonstrate our expectation that incorporating the extended A′ core into an A–D–A′–D–A-type NFREA increases its LUMO level, we designed and synthesized BT-4F and DTBT-4F with a BT core and two fused electron-donating thiophene rings on a BT core, respectively, and conducted a systematic series of comparative studies. Interestingly, as expected, the LUMO levels were upshifted in the order of the extended conjugation length of the A′ core: BT-4F < DTBT-4F < BTST-4F.

As a result, when blended with PBDB-T as a donor polymer, the BTST-4F-based device achieved a VOC of 0.84 V, which exceeded the VOC values of the BT-4F- and DTBT-4F-based devices. This increase was a result of the highest LUMO level of BTST-4F. The BTST-4F-based device exhibited a JSC comparable to that of the BT-4F-based device because, compared with BT-4F and DTBT-4F, BTST-4F exhibited better miscibility with PBDT-T. The BTST-4F-based devices with the extended π-conjugated core achieved a PCE (8.23%) greater than those of the BT-4F- and DTBT-4F-based devices (7.11% and 5.64%, respectively).
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and Characterization

Fig. 1(a) shows the molecular structures of BT-4F, DTBT-4F and BTST-4F. The synthesis and characterization of the intermediates and final products are described in the experimental section of the ESI.† Stannylated CPDT and BTST-Br were prepared according to the previously reported procedure.33–35 The D–A′–D intermediates were synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction between the dibrominated central A′ core (BT-Br, DTBT-Br, or BTST-Br) and the monostannylated CPDT as the D unit. The dialdehyde derivatives were obtained by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with anhydrous dimethylformamide and phosphoryl chloride in chloroform. Finally, the target compounds (BT-4F, DTBT-4F, or BTST-4F) were obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation between the dialdehyde derivatives and 2FIC. All compounds were characterized using spectroscopic methods including 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (Fig. S1–S11, ESI†). The thermal properties of the three NFAs were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Table 1 and Fig. S12, ESI†). BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F exhibited excellent thermal stability, with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) higher than 325 °C under a N2 atmosphere. The thermograms of DTBT-4F and BTST-4F showed a melting peak (222 and 257 °C, respectively), whereas that of BT-4F showed no obvious thermal transitions.

The optical properties of the three NFREAs were characterized by ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption in the solution and film states (Fig. 1(c) and Table 1). Replacement of the BT core by the extended A′ cores (i.e., DTBT and BTST) led to a blue-shift of the absorption maximum (λmax) from 744 to 702 nm and then to 704 nm. Interestingly, the absorption spectra of DTBT-4F and BTST-4F in diluted solution were similar. From solution to film, the absorption onsets of all the NFREAs were red-shifted with the absorption peaks at 905 nm for BT-4F, 838 nm for DTBT-4F, and 849 nm for BTST-4F, which correspond to optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.37 for BT-4F, 1.48 eV for DTBT-4F, and 1.46 eV for BTST-4F. The absorption onsets of DTBT-4F and BTST-4F were blue-shifted compared with that of BT-4F because the two fused electron-donating thiophene ring (or thienothiophene) units on the A′ core diminished the electron-withdrawing ability of the A′ core, which weakened the ICT effect of DTBT-4F and BTST-4F.
To study the effect of the extended A′ core on the electrochemical properties of BT-4F, DTBT-4F and BTST-4F, we conducted cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S13, ESI†). The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels were −5.49/−4.12 eV for BT-4F, −5.55/−4.07 eV for DTBT-4F, and −5.48/−4.02 eV for BTST-4F (Fig. 1(d) and Table 1). The extension of the A′ core length in the order BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F substantially upshifts the LUMO energy levels; thus, we expected DTBT-4F and BTST-4F to produce a higher VOC.
To investigate the molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbitals of BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F, we carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level (Fig. 1(b) and Fig. S14–S16, ESI†). All alkyl chains were replaced by a methyl group to simplify the calculation. The optimized molecular conformations of all the NFREAs showed good planar structures (Fig. 1(b)), which facilitate π-electron delocalization and favor intermolecular packing. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels were −5.60/−4.00 eV for BT-4F, −5.65/−3.81 eV for DTBT-4F and −5.49/−3.74 eV for BTST-4F. To explain the effect of structural changes in the central core on the electronic structure, we conducted an additional analysis by DFT calculations. As expected, the calculated HOMOs of the central cores increased gradually from −6.73 eV to −6.12 eV to −5.62 eV with increasing electron-donating ability, whereas the LUMOs were similar (Fig. S14, ESI†). However, the electronic structures of the intermediates tended to change dramatically as the CPDT bridges were introduced. In particular, the calculated HOMO of DTBT-CPDT (−4.91 eV) was lower than that of BT-CPDT (−4.75 eV) (Fig. S15, ESI†). This result can be explained by the large backbone curvature decreasing the effective π-conjugation (i.e., electronic communication) between the core and CPDT bridges, thereby widening the bandgap and lowering the HOMO of DTBT–CPDT.36,37 In addition, this tendency was maintained even when 2FIC as the end group was introduced (Fig. S16, ESI†). The HOMO/LUMO values calculated using DFT agreed well with the trends in the results of the Eoptg and CV experiments.
To explore the miscibility between the NFREAs and PBDB-T, the contact angles and surface tension γ of water and diiodomethane on a pure film were measured (Table 2 and Fig. S17, ESI†). Contact angle data were analyzed using the OWRK model, which yielded γ = 40.9 mN m−1 for BT-4F, 39.9 mN m−1 for DTBT-4F, 39.3 mN m−1 for BTST-4F, and 37.3 mN m−1 PBDB-T.38 The miscibility of the three NFREAs was calculated as , where γdonor is the surface tension of BT-4F, DTBT-4F, or BTST-4F, γacceptor is the surface tension of PBDB-T, and χ is the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter of PBDB-T:NFREA.39 Calculations yielded χ values of 0.08 for PBDB-T:BT-4F, 0.04 for PBDB-T:DTBT-4F, and 0.03 for PBDB-T:BTST-4F. A low χ value indicates high miscibility; thus, these results indicate that BTST-4F is more miscible with PBDB-T than with BT-4F and DTBT-4F. The improved miscibility can favor the formation of an appropriate morphology for efficient charge transport between an acceptor and donor.40

2.2. Photovoltaic properties
To characterize the photovoltaic properties of BT-4F, DTBT-4F and BTST-4F as electron acceptors, PBDB-T was chosen as the electron donor. The OSC devices were fabricated with a conventional structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/(N,N'-bis{3-[3-(dimethylamino)propylamino]propyl}perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide) (PDINN)/Ag. The current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of the optimized PBDB-T:BT-4F, PBDB-T:DTBT-4F, and PBDB-T:BTST-4F devices are shown in Fig. 2(a); the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3.

The PBDB-T:BT-4F and PBDB-T:BTST-4F devices were optimized with 1:1.1 (wt/wt) D:A compositions using chloroform (CF) solutions containing 0.5% (v/v) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), with annealing at 140 °C for 10 min (Fig. S18, S19 and Tables S1, S2, ESI†). However, PBDB-T:DTBT-4F blends spin coated from CF solutions showed microscale DTBT-4F aggregates (Fig. S20, ESI†), resulting in poor photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding devices (Table S3, ESI†). This difference might be a result of the poor solubility of DTBT-4F in CF solutions because of the extended π-conjugation of the NFREAs core.41 Because of these issues, PBDB-T: DTBT-4F devices optimized under different conditions were compared (Table 3). Therefore, in the present work, we mainly focused on the comparison between PBDB-T:BT-4F and PBDB-T:BTST-4F devices.
The optimized BTST-4F-based devices exhibited increased PCEs compared with the optimized DTBT-4F- and BT-4F-based devices, mainly because of the increased VOC of the BTST-4F-based devices. The optimized BTST-4F-based devices exhibited a high PCE of 8.23%, VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 15.60 mA cm−2, and FF of 62.8%. The optimized DTBT-4F-based devices exhibited a PCE of 5.64%, VOC of 0.81 V, JSC of 12.98 mA cm−2, and FF of 53.4%. The optimized BT-4F-based devices exhibited a PCE of 7.11%, VOC of 0.66 V, JSC of 17.70 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.3%. The optimized BTST-4F-based devices exhibited the highest VOC (0.84 V), followed by the DTBT-4F-based devices (VOC = 0.81 V) and the BT-4F-based devices (VOC = 0.66 V).
CV measurements and DFT calculations showed that π-conjugation extension of the central core resulted in upshifted LUMO levels of the NFREAs. Such upshifted LUMO levels of NFREAs can reduce energy loss during charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor, resulting in increased VOC values for the devices.42 Therefore, we attribute the gradual increase in the VOC from the BT-4F-based devices to the DTBT-4F- and BTST-4F-based devices to the gradual increase in the LUMO levels of the NFREAs according to extended π-conjugation of the central core.
Moreover, the BTST-4F-based devices exhibited JSC values comparable to those of the BT-4F-based devices despite the BTST-4F-based blends absorbing light over a narrower spectral range than the BT-4F-based blends. The JSC values obtained from the J–V curves were in good agreement with those calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2(b) and Table 3). The LUMO offsets between the donors and the acceptors provide an energetic driving force for efficient charge transfer. Therefore, the upshifted LUMO levels of the acceptor can result in reduced charge generation, followed by a reduced JSC. However, previous research has suggested that the energetic cascade between mixed and pure phases can provide an additional driving force for charge generation.43 Therefore, as discussed below, the comparable JSC of the BTST-4F-based devices to that of the BT-4F-based devices might be a result of the miscible morphologies of PBDB-T:BTST-4F blends; these morphologies increase the amount of mixed phases, generating energetic cascades between the mixed and pure phases, thereby resulting in increased charge separation. Moreover, the BT-4F-, DTBT-4F-, and BTST-4F-based devices exhibited generally low FFs less than 70%. Previous research has suggested that excessive self-assembly of NFREAs results in large-sized phase separation, resulting in low FFs for NFREA-based devices.44 Therefore, we attributed the general low FFs of the BT-4F-, DTBT-4F- and BTST-4F-based devices to the excessive self-assembly of BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F in blends, as discussed below.
The DTBT-4F-based devices exhibited lower photovoltaic parameters than the BT-4F- and BTST-4F-based devices because of the different optimization conditions used for DTBT-4F-based devices, as previously discussed. The extended π-conjugation of the DTBT-4F core decreased the solubility in CF or chlorobenzene (CB), which made increasing the thickness of the active layers and increasing the device efficiencies difficult. By contrast, although BTST-4F has a larger π-conjugation of the core than DTBT-4F, the BTST-4F-based devices exhibited better photovoltaic parameters than the DTBT-4F-based devices. We speculate that the side chain attached to the core increased the solubility of BTST-4F, resulting in miscible morphologies of BTST-4F-based blends and efficient charge generation. Therefore, these results imply that the use of extended π-conjugation of the core in conjunction with side-chain engineering could be an effective method for increasing the VOC of NFREA-based devices while maintaining decent JSC.
To understand the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties in the BT-4F-, DTBT-4F-, and BTST-4F-based devices, we investigated the relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 2(c)).45 To determine the charge-collection efficiency (ηcoll) and the exciton-dissociation probability (ηdiss), the Jph under maximum power-output conditions and the short-circuit conditions were divided by the saturated Jph (Jsat). The Jsat values were 18.87 mA cm−2 for the BT-4F-based devices, 15.14 mA cm−2 for the DTBT-4F-based devices, and 16.80 mA cm−2 for the BTST-4F-based devices. The BT-4F-based devices exhibited the highest Jsat because the red-shifted absorption of BT-4F compared with that of DTBT-4F and BTST-4F enables enhanced light harvesting by the BT-4F-based OSC devices. The determined ηdiss and ηcoll were 93.8% and 78.3% for the BT-4F-based devices, 89.6% and 63.6% for the DTBT-4F-based devices and 94.5% and 77.9% for the BTST-4F-based devices, respectively. The BTST-4F-based devices exhibited an ηcoll value similar to that of the BT-4F-based devices, indicating that BTST-4F forms efficient electron transport pathways comparable to those formed in BT-4F in blends. Therefore, we attribute the similar ηcoll between the BTST-4F- and BT-4F-based devices to their similar FFs.
The BTST-4F-based devices also exhibited a slightly higher ηdiss than the BT-4F-based devices despite the lower LUMO offsets of the BTST-4F-based blends compared with those of the BT-4F-based blends. We speculate that the miscible morphologies of the BTST-4F-based blends contributed to an increase in the energetic cascade between the mixed and pure phases, resulting in an increase in ηdiss. These results show that finely miscible morphologies could be another effective approach to efficient charge generation. That is, although the BTST-4F-based blends have a narrowed wavelength range of light absorption and a lower Jsat compared with the BT-4F-based blends, the finely controlled morphologies of the BTST-4F-based devices enabled a high ηdiss and efficient utilization of absorbed light, resulting in comparable JSC to that of the BT-4F-based devices.
To investigate the dynamics of charge recombination in the BT-4F-, DTBT-4F- and BTST-4F-based devices, the dependence of JSC and VOC on the light intensity (Plight) (Fig. 2(d) and (e)) was measured. A slope coefficient (S) of JSCvs. Plight closer to 1 implies a lower degree of bimolecular recombination.46 The S values were 0.942 for the BT-4F-based devices, 0.951 for the DTBT-4F-based devices, and 0.957 for the BTST-4F-based devices. These results indicate a lower degree of bimolecular recombination in the BTST-4F-based devices than in the BT-4F-based devices. A slope coefficient (n) of VOCvs. Plight greater than kT/q implies a greater degree of trap-assisted recombination, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge.47 The n values of VOCvs. Plight were 1.47kT/q for the BT-4F-based devices, 1.25kT/q for the DTBT-4F-based devices, and 1.33kT/q for the BTST-4F-based devices. The BTST-4F-based devices exhibited a lower n value than the BT-4F-based devices, indicating a lower degree of trap-assisted recombination in the BTST-4F-based devices than in the BT-4F-based devices. These results indicate that the suppressed bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination in the BTST-4F-based devices might be attributable to their finely controlled morphologies, which result in a higher PCE of the BTST-based devices compared with that of the BT-4F-based devices.
2.3. Morphology investigation
The surface morphologies of the BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F-based blends were quantified by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3). The surface of the BTST-4F-based blends was smooth, with a root-mean-square roughness (rRMS) of 1.15 nm; by contrast, the surface of the BT-4F- and DTBT-4F-based blends showed numerous NFREA crystals and had rRMS values of 1.71 and 2.07 nm, respectively. Contact-angle measurements predicted that BTST-4F should be more miscible than BT-4F and DTBT-4F with PBDB-T. Therefore, the high miscibility between PBDB-T and BTST-4F is speculated to induce intimate mixing of PBDB-T and BTST-4F in blends and thereby inhibit large-scale phase separation during a film-forming process. The smoother surface morphologies and lower rRMS of the BTST-4F-based blends compared with those of the BT-4F- and DTBT-4F-based blends thus indicate relatively miscible phase separation of the BTST-4F-based blends compared with the BT-4F- and DTBT-4F-based blends.

The crystalline ordering of the as-cast BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F films was investigated via grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. Their 2D-GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding 1D line cuts are summarized in Fig. S21 and Table S4 (ESI†). As-cast BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F exhibit similar GIWAXS patterns with a lamellar diffraction peak at ∼0.40 Å−1 along the in-plane direction and a π–π stacking diffraction peak at ∼1.75 Å−1 along the out-of-plane direction. These results indicate that BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F adopt a face-on orientation relative to the substrate. The calculated lamellar stacking distances were 15.59 Å for BT-4F, 16.45 Å for DTBT-4F, and 15.74 Å for BTST-4F, and the calculated π–π stacking distances were 3.59 Å for BT-4F, 3.56 Å for DTBT-4F, and 3.65 Å for BTST-4F (Table S4, ESI†).
The changes in crystalline ordering of the BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F films after thermal annealing were investigated (Fig. 4(a), (b) and Table S5, ESI†). The GIWAXS patterns of BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F films annealed at 150 °C for 10 min were compared with the patterns of the corresponding as-cast films (Fig. S21 and Table S4, ESI†). Thermal annealing induced much stronger and sharper lamellar and π–π stacking peaks of the pristine BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F films, indicating their increased crystalline ordering. The lamellar diffraction peaks along the in-plane direction appeared at 0.48 Å−1 for BT-4F, 0.40 Å−1 for DTBT-4F, and 0.39 Å−1 for BTST-4F; the calculated lamellar stacking distances were 13.09 Å for BT-4F, 15.67 Å for DTBT-4F, and 15.91 Å for BTST-4F. The π–π stacking peaks along the out-of-plane direction were at 1.72 Å−1 for BT-4F, 1.75 Å−1 for DTBT-4F, and 1.76 Å−1 for BTST-4F; the calculated π–π stacking distances were 3.65 Å for BT-4F, 3.59 Å for DTBT-4F, and 3.56 Å for BTST-4F. The annealed BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F films exhibited decreased lamellar stacking distances compared with those of the as-cast BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F films, indicating stronger lamellar stacking of NFREAs by thermal annealing (Table S5, ESI†).

The crystal coherence length (CCL) of the as-cast and annealed BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F films were calculated using the Scherrer equation (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†). After thermal annealing, the CCLs calculated from the lamellar diffraction peaks increased from 2.81 to 17.14 nm for the BT-4F films, from 2.72 to 6.98 nm for the DTBT-4F films, and from 4.79 to 7.85 nm for the BTST-4F films. After thermal annealing, the CCLs calculated from the π–π stacking diffraction peaks increased from 2.01 to 5.34 nm for the BT-4F films, from 2.08 to 4.19 nm for the DTBT-4F films, and from 1.31 to 2.14 nm for the BTST-4F films. The simultaneous increases in the CCLs of lamellar stacking and π–π stacking indicate that thermal annealing increased the self-assembly of BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F, resulting in an increase in their crystal size. In particular, the changes in the CCL after thermal annealing were smallest for BTST-4F and greatest for BT-4F, resulting in the smaller CCLs of the annealed BTST-4F films compared with those of the annealed BT-4F films. These results indicate that, compared with BT-4F, BTST-4F exhibits relatively low crystalline ordering, resulting in the formation of relatively smaller crystals of BTST-4F than those of BT-4F in pristine films.
The crystalline ordering of PBDB-T:BT-4F, PBDB-T:DTBT-4F, and PBDB-T:BTST-4F blends were investigated (Fig. 4(a) and (c), and Table S6, ESI†). When BT-4F, DTBT-4F, and BTST-4F were blended with PBDB-T, they retained a lamellar diffraction peak at approximately 0.40–0.48 Å−1 and a π–π stacking diffraction peak at approximately 1.68–1.71 Å−1; these results indicate that their crystalline ordering in pristine films was preserved in the blends. However, BTST-4F exhibited much weaker and broader lamellar and π–π stacking peaks than those of BT-4F, indicating that BTST-4F exhibited lower crystalline ordering than BT-4F in blends. Contact-angle measurements predicted that, compared with BT-4F, BTST-4F should be more miscible with PBDB-T (Fig. S17, ESI†), and GIWAXS measurements demonstrated that BTST-4F exhibits lower crystalline ordering than BT-4F in pristine films (Fig. 4(a) and (b)). Therefore, the high miscibility of BTST-4F with PBDB-T and the low crystalline ordering of BTST-4F might promote more miscible morphologies of BTST-4F-based blends than BT-4F-based blends, leading to the formation of fewer and smaller crystals of BTST-4F than those of BT-4F in blends. These results are corroborated by the lower rRMS of the BTST-4F-based blends compared with that of the BT-4F-based blends, as observed by AFM (Fig. 3).
3. Conclusions
The BTST core was introduced as a large extended π-conjugated central unit by fusing two thienothiophene rings as the electron-donating unit to an electron-withdrawing central A′ core of A–D–A′–D–A-type NFREAs, along with two CPDTs connected as electron-donating D units and two 2FIC as electron-withdrawing A units, resulting in BTST-4F. The large extended π-conjugated BTST core of BTST-4F exhibits a relatively weak electron-withdrawing ability because of the fused electron-donating unit on the electron-withdrawing A′ core. As a result, the LUMO level of BTST-4F was expected to upshift to yield a high VOC for BTST-4F-based devices. For comparison, as counterparts, BT-4F with a BT core and DTBT-4F with two fused thiophene rings on a BT core were designed and synthesized to investigate the effect of the extended π-conjugation of the central core on A–D–A′–D–A-type NFREAs. As the π-conjugation length of the central core of NFREAs was increased in the order BT-4F < DTBT-4F < BTST-4F, their LUMOs upshifted in the same order and yielded VOC increases of 0.66 V in BT-4F-based devices, 0.81 V in DTBT-4F-based devices, and 0.84 V in BTST-4F-based devices. The BTST-4F-based devices had comparable JSC to the BT-4F-based devices because BTST-4F is more miscible than BT-4F with the donor polymer PBDB-T. As a result, with the introduction of the extended π-conjugation core of NFREA, BTST-4F showed an upshifted LUMO level and better miscibility with the PBDB-T donor polymer, resulting in an increased VOC (0.84 V) and PCE (8.23%) for the BTST-based devices compared with those of the BT-4F- and DTBT-4F-based devices. These results indicate that introducing an extended π-conjugated central core into A–D–A′–D–A-type NFREAs is a promising design strategy to achieve high-performance NFREA-based OSCs.
