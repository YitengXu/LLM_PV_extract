    , Accepted 25th March 2013First published on 26th March 2013AbstractTriphenylacrylonitrile and diarylamine based D–π–A luminogens exhibit typical AIE characteristics with high solid state efficiency up to unity and switchable mechanochromism with high contrast, which render them multifunctional materials for versatile applications in optical storage, volatile organic compound (VOC) detection, OLEDs, etc.
Electron donor–π-bridge–electron acceptor (D–π–A) structured luminogens have been the subject of intense research because of their unique properties and potential applications in two-photon absorption,1 up-converted lasing,2 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),3 solar cells,4 bioimaging,5 and so on. Moreover, the electronic structures and thus optoelectronic properties of the D–π–A architectures can be facilely modulated through tuning the electron donor and/or acceptor strengths.6 However, most conventional dye molecules are highly fluorescent in dilute solutions, but become weakly or even nonemissive when aggregated.7 Such a thorny aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) problem has greatly limited their applications because the luminophores are mostly used in aggregated or condensed states. In 2001, an opposite and intriguing aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon was discovered by Tang's group: a group of nonluminescent molecules with propeller-like conformations are induced to emit efficiently by aggregate formation.8 Restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR) is proposed to explain the phenomenon.8 The discovery of the AIE phenomenon has opened a novel robust way to fabricate high efficiency luminophores in the aggregated states.9
Recently, mechanochromic luminogens displaying reversible stimuli-responsive emission switching in the solid phase have been attracting increasing attention owing to their fundamental importance and potential applications in camouflaging, optical information storage, sensors, memory chips, and security inks.10,11 It would be interesting if D–π–A solid emitters can be both highly efficient and mechanochromic. If so, the resulting compounds might show fascinating properties and have versatile biophotonic and optoelectronic applications. Fabrication of AIE active D–π–A molecules is a rational and promising choice.
Herein, we report our recent progress in the fabrication of D–π–A structured AIE molecules with high solid state efficiency and remarkable mechanochromism. Through rational combination of propeller-like triphenylacrylonitrile (TPAN) and diarylamines, a group of D–π–A molecules, namely DPATPAN, MeDPATPAN, and PhNPATPAN (Chart 1), were successfully synthesized. These luminogens exhibit typical AIE and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics, remarkable mechanochromism (emission wavelength change up to 51 nm), and moreover high solid-state emission efficiency up to 100%, which is rarely found in ICT luminogens.
 Chart 1  Chemical structures and photophysical properties of DPATPAN, MeDPATPAN, and PhNPATPAN. 
The target compounds were prepared according to the synthetic routes shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Briefly, 2-(4-bromophenyl)-3,3-diphenylacrylonitrile (TPAN-Br) was prepared as a key intermediate in 90% yield through Knoevenagel condensation between 4-bromophenylacetonitrile (1) and benzophenone (2). Subsequent coupling with diarylamines by Buchwald–Hartwig reaction generated the resulting luminogens in good yields (70–83%).12 The intermediate and final products were spectroscopically characterized, with satisfactory data being obtained (ESI,† Fig. S1–S9).
Luminogens exhibit two characteristic absorption bands in THF with absorption maxima of 294/385, 300/400, 292/392 nm for DPATPAN, MeDPATPAN and PhNPATPAN, respectively (Fig. S10, ESI†). The former band is attributed to the π–π* transitions, whereas the latter is ascribed to the ICT transitions. Normally, photophysical properties of D–π–A conjugates are highly dependent on the solvent polarity. As depicted in Fig. S11 (ESI†), DPATPAN shows similar absorption profiles in varying solvents, indicating their solvent polarity independent ground state electronic structures and small dipole moments associated with the ICT transitions. However, the emission spectra exhibit typical bathochromic shift, with maxima being 432, 441/550, 565, 584 and 605 nm in n-hexane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM) and N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF), respectively.
When illuminated with UV light, solutions of the luminogens exhibit no visible lights (Fig. S12, ESI†), whereas their aggregated powders emit strong green lights, indicating that aggregation has turned on their emissions. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the luminogens in THF and THF–water aqueous mixtures were further measured. DPATPAN in pure THF and THF–water mixtures with water fractions (fw) ≤75% exhibits extremely weak PL signals, which is ascribed to the active intramolecular rotations of the genuinely dissolved luminogens in these mixtures. The PL intensity starts to increase when fw > 75% (Fig. 1A), at which the luminogens begin to aggregate. At a fw of 90%, DPATPAN emits intense yellow lights, whose intensity is >101-fold higher than that in THF (Fig. 1B), thus testifying its AIE nature, which can also be seen from the vivid contrast images in Fig. 1B. MeDPATPAN and PhNPATPAN show similar AIE behavior to that of DPATPAN, giving an emission enhancement of >207- and 5-fold in 10/90 THF–water compared to those in THF (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†).

Concentration: 10 μM; excitation wavelength: 400 nm. Photographs in (B) are DPATPAN in THF and 10/90 THF–water mixture taken under 365 nm UV light illumination. 
To quantitatively evaluate the emissions, quantum efficiencies of the luminogens in solution (ΦF,s) and as prepared solid (ΦF,aps) states were determined. While ΦF,s values for DPATPAN, MeDPATPAN and PhNPATPAN in THF are as low as 0.80%, 0.50% and 1.70%, ΦF,aps are boosted to 100%, 60% and 100%, respectively, giving the corresponding AIE factors (αAIE = ΦF,aps/ΦF,s) of 125, 120 and 58.8 (Chart 1). It is also noted that such high solid-state efficiency for ICT emitters is rarely found.
The AIE feature, ICT characteristics, and moreover high solid-state efficiency render such luminogens promising candidates as two-photon absorption materials, emitting layers in OLEDs, VOC sensors (Fig. S15, ESI†), and stimuli responsive smart materials.10e To check whether these luminogens are mechanochromic, their solid emission properties were studied. While the as prepared solid powders of DPATPAN exhibit strong green emission at 500 nm, they emit yellow lights with a maximum at 551 nm upon gently grinding with a spatula (Fig. 2). Upon further annealing at 80 °C for 10 min or fuming with DCM vapor for 3 min, the original green emission is restored. Such mechanochromic conversion between green and yellow emission colors can be repeated many times without fatigue due to the nondestructive nature of the mechanical stimuli (Fig. S16, ESI†). To gain insights into the mechanism, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted. While the as prepared powders exhibit much intense and sharp diffraction, indicative of their regular crystalline nature, the ground solids show rather weak signals, indicating disordered molecular packing. However, when heated or fumed with solvent, sharp diffractions emerge again, implying the recovery of an ordered crystalline lattice. The results clearly indicate that mechanochromism is highly associated with the molecular arrangement that greatly influences photophysical properties.13 Similar phenomena are also observed for MeDPATPAN and PhNPATPAN, whose as prepared/ground solid emission maxima are 503/549 and 496/534 nm, giving remarkable mechanochromic red shifts (Δλ) of 46 and 38 nm, respectively (Fig. S17, ESI†).

Further single crystal structures of the compounds provide more insights into the AIE and mechanochromic mechanisms. As depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. S18 (ESI†), all compounds adopt highly twisted conformations, which favor active intramolecular rotations in solutions, thus effectively consuming exciton energies and subsequently making the molecules nonluminescent in solutions. However, when aggregated as nanosuspensions or solid powders, such rotations are strictly restricted; meanwhile, the propeller-like conformations help to prevent the formation of detrimental excimers and exciplexes, thereby generating boosted emissions. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 3B, in the crystalline state, multiple C–H⋯π (2.879 Å), C–H⋯H–C (2.366 Å), and C–H⋯N (2.722 Å) interactions further rigidify the molecular conformations, thus yielding high quantum efficiency up to unity.

HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the optimized structures for the luminogens were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level. As shown in Fig. 3C and Fig. S19 (ESI†), while the electron clouds in HOMO levels are mainly located on the electron-donating diarylamines and bridged π units, those of LUMO levels are predominantly placed on the TPAN moiety, revealing the ICT characteristic in the molecules, which is consistent with the spectroscopic result.
It is noted that with an additional methyl group, MeDPATPAN shows a much lower efficiency of 60% compared to that of DPATPAN. It might be ascribed to the rotation and vibration of the methyl group, which cause exciton energy consumption even in the crystalline state.
The origin of the luminescence switching can also be ascribed to the highly twisted conformations, which can be planarized through facile mechanical stimuli and restored upon thermal annealing or solvent fuming. While twisted stacking architectures result in much shorter effective conjugation lengths (ECLs) and bluer emissions, planarized conformations generate increased ECLs, thus producing much redder emissions.
High PL efficiency often promises excellent EL performance.14 Herein, we fabricated OLED devices with the sandwich configuration of ITO/NPB (60 nm)/X (30 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/Liq (1 nm)/Al (150 nm),15 where NPB, X and Alq3 are used as hole transporting, light emitting, and electron transporting layers, respectively. The device performances are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S20 (ESI†). All nondoped devices for DPATPAN (device I), MeDPATPAN (device II), and PhNPATPAN (device III) perform well. For example, device II emits yellow light (559 nm) with maximum luminance (Lmax), current, power, and external quantum efficiencies (CEmax, PEmax, EQE) of 4323 cd m−2, 6.72 cd A−1, 2.70 lm W−1, and 2.2%, respectively. PL maxima of such vacuum deposited films are 549, 559 and 546 nm for DPATPAN, MeDPATPAN and PhNPATPAN, respectively, which are similar to those of EL spectra (Fig. S21, ESI†). However, much lower efficiency is observed for such films (DPATPAN: 73%, PhNPATPAN: 75%) due to the destruction of intermolecular interactions.
