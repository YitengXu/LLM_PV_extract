    , Accepted 31st May 2021First published on 21st June 2021AbstractDesigning a low-cost and efficient evaporation system to maximize solar energy utilization is of great importance for the emerging solar water purification technologies. Herein, we demonstrate a universal sandwich hydrogel fabricated by confining plasmonic Cu/carbon cell solar absorbers in the evaporation surface of the PVA hydrogel to achieve high-efficiency solar water purification. Owing to the superior light absorption and efficient thermal management, the fabricated device exhibited an excellent water evaporation rate of 2.08 kg m−2 h−1.

Careful investigations on the internal stress and electron transfer between the plasmonic Cu nanoparticles and carbon cells revealed that the simple in situ catalytic growth strategy achieved the goal of protecting Cu nanoparticles for plasmonic heat generation, which rendered the composite solar absorbers an excellent light-to-heat conversion efficiency of 93.43%. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the obtained sandwich hydrogel also reduced the concentrations of heavy metal ions by four to six orders of magnitude after simultaneous one-step adsorption and solar distillation, which is comparable to some of the current purification techniques. It is believed that the successful combination of the broadband absorption biomass carbons and the plasmonic non-precious metals may open up a new pathway for designing high-efficiency and low-cost photothermal materials in the near future.
1. Introduction
Water scarcity has become one of the most serious challenges for human society due to the intensified consumption of clean water and the severe pollution of the ecosystem.1,2 Technologies for the sustainable on-site reclamation of clean water from sewage and/or seawater are urgently desired. Solar-driven water evaporation, harvesting and converting clean and sustainable solar energy to heat, and promoting the evaporation of water has emerged as a promising technique for clean water generation, during which the efficient light-to-heat conversion of light absorbers is the critical first step toward a high-performance evaporator.3,4 Over the past few years, carbons5–11 and plasmonic metals12–14 have been the most widely investigated light absorbers due to their superior chemical stability and broadband absorption in the ultraviolet and visible region.15,16 However, the photothermal conversion efficiencies of carbons are intrinsically limited by their strong light scattering perpendicular to the cleavage planes caused by their birefringence property,17,18 while the applications of high-efficiency plasmonic metals, such as Au,12,19,20 Pd,21 and Ag,22 are significantly limited by their high costs.
Cu with a much lower price is an attractive and cost-effective candidate to replace common precious metals, and Cu nanoparticles have exhibited a broader plasmonic light-harvesting property, which can significantly promote the heat generation through the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect.23 However, Cu nanoparticles can easily react with oxygen in the air to produce oxides of various valence states and can destroy the surface plasmon resonance.24 Thus, it is critically necessary to establish novel strategies for Cu protection. One economical solution is to anchor Cu nanoparticles on carbon supports, such as graphene.25–27 However, in comparison to the commercial graphene, the hierarchical hollow-structured carbon cells derived from natural rape pollens are not only low-cost and easy to prepare but also exhibit much more refined and diverse pore structures, which are conducive to harvesting the incident light.28 The combination of the high absorption plasmonic Cu with the hierarchical carbon cells is expected to provide an economical solution to designing low-cost and high-efficiency photothermal materials.
Except for solar absorbers, another energy efficiency limitation to most present evaporators is the inefficient utilization of the converted heat. Though it has been reported that a bilayer evaporating structure containing a top solar absorber and bottom heat insulator can reduce most conductive and irradiative heat losses to the bulk water, convection heat loss of the solar absorber to air is also unfortunately unavoidable.29–31 It would be ideal if one could achieve efficient heat insulation at both sides of the solar absorber. Herein, we demonstrate a sandwich hydrogel for high-efficiency solar water purification (Fig. 1), in which plasmonic Cu/carbon cells are confined in the evaporation surface of PVA hydrogel to achieve superior light-to-heat conversion and efficient thermal management. Careful investigations on the internal stress and the electron transfer between the plasmonic Cu nanoparticles and the carbon cells showed that a simple in situ catalytic growth strategy could achieve the goal of protecting the Cu nanoparticles for plasmonic heat generation. Based on a homemade liquid-based photothermal system, the composite plasmonic Cu/carbon cell solar absorber exhibited a high light-to-heat conversion efficiency of 93.43%, while the obtained evaporation device demonstrated an excellent water evaporation rate of 2.08 kg m−2 h−1. Moreover, the solar absorber usage of the sandwich hydrogel evaporator could be cut down to 50% to that of the general reported black homogeneous hydrogel without affecting the energy efficiency. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the obtained sandwich hydrogel could also reduce the concentrations of the heavy metal ions by four to six orders of magnitude after a simultaneous one-step adsorption and solar distillation, which is comparable to the current purification techniques.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of the plasmonic Cu/carbon cells (Cu1.0-PC)
The CuCl2-activated pollen cells (Cu-PC) were prepared according to the previous report with slight modifications.28 The plasmonic Cu/carbon cells were prepared by soaking 300 mg of Cu-PC in 5 mL of 1.0 g L−1 CuCl2 ethanol solution, stirring, and drying at 70 °C. Then, the Cu/carbon cells were obtained by calcinating the dried sample at 900 °C for 2 h with a heating ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 in a tube furnace under a nitrogen gas flow. The obtained sample was denoted as Cu1.0-PC, where the subscript 1.0 represents the concentration of CuCl2 in ethanol solution.
2.2 Preparation of the L-Cu1.0-PC and H-Cu1.0-PC hydrogels
PVA powder with an alcoholysis degree of 98–99% was dissolved in deionized water under 95 °C for 3 h to obtain a homogenous solution with a concentration of 100 mg mL−1. The crosslinking agent was prepared by mixing 1 mL of glutaraldehyde, 5 mL of methyl alcohol, 5 mL of acetic acid, 1 mL of sulfuric acid, and 70 mL of deionized water. First, 50 mg of Cu1.0-PC was dispersed in 8 mL of the above PVA solution and diluted to 19 mL by water, stirring for 10 min to obtain a homogeneous solution. The obtained mixture was poured into a Teflon mold and allowed to settle until the Cu1.0-PC particles were concentrated at the bottom of the mold under the effect of gravity. Then 1 mL of crosslinking agent was added to initiate the crosslinking reaction, followed with ten cycles of the freeze/thaw process to obtain the final sandwich PVA hydrogel. The obtained sample was denoted as L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel, where the subscript 2.5 represents the loading amount of Cu1.0-PC. For comparison, 50 mg of Cu1.0-PC was evenly dispersed in the gel by freezing with liquid nitrogen, and ten cycles of the freeze/thaw process were performed to obtain the homogeneous PVA hydrogel. The obtained sample was denoted as H2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel, where the subscript 2.5 represents the loading amount of Cu1.0-PC. All the dry gels were obtained by freeze–drying the hydrogel samples in a lyophilizer for 3 days.
2.3 Characterizations
SEM (Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and TEM (JEM 2100, Japan) characterizations were performed to observe the microstructures and morphologies of the materials. A UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750s, USA) with an integrated sphere for reflected light collection was applied to investigate the light-absorbing performance of the samples. The temperature changes of the samples were recorded on an FLIR A655sc IR camera. Ion concentrations of water before and after desalination were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP-MS, Agilent 700). The electrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (SP-200, Bio-Logic Science Instruments) with a traditional three-electrode electrochemical cell.
2.4 Adsorption measurements
A stock solution (1 g L−1) of Cd2+, Cr3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ was prepared by CdCl2·5/2H2O, CrCl3·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, CuCl2·2H2O, and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O. Solutions with the desired concentration were prepared by a stepwise dilution of the respective stock solution. The samples were spiked into 20 mL of metal ions or dyes solutions and shaken for 12 h at room temperature. Time-dependent target removal tests were applied to investigate the adsorption kinetics. The concentrations of the metal ions or dyes at different times (1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48 h) were analyzed by UV-vis spectrophotometry (723PC, Jinghua, Shanghai, China).
2.5 Solar steam generation measurements
The solar steam generation experiments were conducted using a solar simulator (CEL-HXF300, CEAULIGHT, Beijing, China), and the light intensity of each test was calibrated by a CEL-NP2000 optical power meter (CEAULIGHT, Beijing, China). The mass change of water was recorded in real-time on a high-accuracy balance (FA 2004N).
3. Results and discussion
The plasmonic Cu nanoparticles were grown on Cu-PC through an in situ catalytic growth method as described in the ESI Note S1.† The XRD patterns in Fig. S1† prove the presence of metallic Cu crystalline dominated by the (111) crystal plane. As shown in Fig. 2a, Cu1.0-PC was grown with many Cu particles. The EDS element analysis in Fig. 2b shows that the content of Cu on the Cu1.0-PC was ∼1.3% and the content of carbon was ∼98.7%. The TEM images display the distribution features of the metallic Cu, in which Cu nanoparticles with sizes around 100 nm were embedded in the carbon skeleton of Cu-PC (Fig. 2c-i) or surrounded by the carbon matrix forming a semi-enclosed structure (Fig. 2c-ii). Interestingly, it can be deduced from the circle section in Fig. 2c-iii and the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) image in Fig. S3† that the seemly bare Cu particles were actually covered with carbon films. The SAED pattern could be matched to the (111) lattice plane of the metallic Cu (Fig. 2c-iv), which was in agreement with the XRD patterns.32 XPS characterization was applied to study the chemical compositions. It can be seen in Fig. 2d and S4† that the Cu 2p1/2 and the Cu 2p3/2 only appeared in the spectra of Cu1.0-PC and no obvious signal of elemental Cu was detected in Cu-PC. The Cu 2p3/2 spectra of Cu1.0-PC in Fig. S5a† displayed a small amount of Cu(OH)2 resulting from the chemical reaction between Cu2O with O2 and H2O in the air. This was confirmed by the O 1s spectra before and after Cu loading in Fig. S6a and c.† It can be seen that the contents of chemisorbed O2 and OH− increased significantly, while the content of CO decreased obviously after Cu loading. As for the C 1s spectrum, the contents of C-sp2 and C-sp3 showed little difference, while the contents of CO and O–C–O exhibited a slight decrease (Fig. S6b and d†). Raman spectroscopy is a powerful non-destructive technique for identifying the structure, doping, and disorder of carbon materials.33 The Raman ID/IG ratio (where ID and IG are the D-band and G-band Raman intensities) is an important indicator to evaluate the structural orderly of carbon materials. It can be seen in Fig. S7† that the ID/IG ratio decreased from 0.945 for Cu-PC to 0.906 for Cu1.0-PC, indicating that the in situ growth of Cu nanoparticles induced a slight improvement in the orderly structure of the carbon matrix.34 As is well known, Cu is the most commonly used catalyst for the growth of graphene through the chemical vapor deposition method.35 The improved structure orderly of Cu1.0-PC could be attributed to the growth of thin graphene films on the metallic Cu particles (Fig. S3†).36 As shown in Fig. 2e, an obvious red-shift of the G-band moves by about 6 cm−1 from 1600 cm−1 for Cu-PC to 1594 cm−1 for Cu1.0-PC could be observed, which could be ascribed to the stress caused by the graphene in the carbon atoms plane.37 Normally, the metal work function of the Cu (111) plane (4.98 eV) is higher than that of graphene (4.69 eV), whereby the contacting of graphene and Cu nanoparticles will form a p-type doping of graphene and cause a blue-shift of the G-band.38 However, a blue-shift of the G-band was not found in the Raman spectra after Cu decoration. This might be explained by the red-shift caused by the stress on the G-band dissembling the blue-shift caused by the hole-doping of graphene. Fortunately, direct evidence of the electron transfer from graphene to Cu could be deduced from the Cu 2p3/2 spectra of the Cu component (Fig. 2d), in which the peak was shifted to lower binding energy from the 932.8 eV of pure Cu reported in the literature39 to the 932.15 eV of the Cu nanoparticles grown with graphene films (Cu1.0-PC). This 0.65 eV negative shift to lower binding energy could be ascribed to the direct electron transfer from graphene to metallic Cu nanoparticles.40 As a whole, the shift of the Dirac point relative to the Fermi level induced by physical doping, and the direct electron transfer from graphene to metallic Cu are displayed in Fig. 2f. Notably, the carbon matrix, especially the grown graphene films, can be functionalized as an energy barrier to reduce the direct contact of metallic Cu with air to a certain degree. More essentially, the injection of electron from graphene into Cu initiates the reduction of Cu particle and renders it with superior antioxidant property. In order to verify the improved long-term stability of the Cu particles, the chemical components of the Cu1.0-PC samples exposed in air for one week and one month were investigated. As shown in Fig. S5b and c,† after one week, the content of Cu(OH)2 in the Cu particles was reduced and a small amount of CuO appeared. One month later, the content of CuO in the Cu particles was slightly increased, but the metallic Cu still dominated the particles. With these merits, the Cu1.0-PC could be expected to have excellent light-to-heat conversion performance over the full solar-spectrum. Based on an electrochemical method, the carrier density (ND) of the samples can be estimated according to the capacitance measurement (eqn (1)):4,41 (1)where C is the space charge capacitance of the sample; ND is the electron carrier density; e is the element charge value; ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum; ε is the relative permittivity of the semiconductor; US is the applied potential; T is the temperature; and kB is Boltzmann's constant. The ND can be determined by the slope of the linear region in Fig. 2g based on the eqn (2):42 (2)

Since the ε of Cu-PC is not available, an accurate ND could not be calculated. However, it could be estimated through the slope of the linear region, whereby the ND of Cu1.0-PC was about 2.8 times that of Cu-PC. The improved ND of Cu1.0-PC could be attributed to the LSPR effect that happens on the metallic Cu nanoparticles, which is conducive to enhancing the light absorption and thermal conversion efficiency. As shown in Fig. 2h and S8a,† Cu1.0-PC (89.3%) exhibited a higher light absorption than Cu-PC (88.8%), D-PC (82.6%), and N-PC (38.3%) over the entire solar spectrum. Moreover, it took only ∼7 minutes for Cu1.0-PC to heat up to 50.0 °C, while it took ∼18 minutes for Cu-PC to reach 50.0 °C under one sun illumination (Fig. 2i). Cu1.0-PC could achieve a final equilibrium temperature of 55.1 °C, which was significantly higher than 51.6 °C obtained from Cu-PC under one sun illumination (the surface temperature changes of N-PC and D-PC are shown in Fig. S8b†). The significantly improved heating rate and the final equilibrium temperature intuitively prove the superiority of compositing plasmonic Cu with carbons.
As shown in Fig. 3a, to evaluate the light-to-heat conversion efficiency, a homemade liquid-based photothermal conversion experimental rig containing a laser source, cuvette sample cell, and photometer detector was assembled.43 Since the carbon cells tend to settle spontaneously in aqueous solution under the influence of gravity, a high concentration PVA solution (10 wt%) was adopted to slow down the settling process by improving the suspension viscosity. The detailed experimental method is described in the ESI Note S2.† As shown in Fig. 3b, a rapid temperature rise in the suspensions was observed once the laser was turned on (about 500 s), indicating efficient photothermal conversion and instantaneous heat convection within the suspensions. The equilibrium temperature of 43.8 °C of Cu1.0-PC (Fig. S9†) was much higher than that of Cu-PC (40.0 °C). After approaching the equilibrium temperature with a fluctuation of less than 0.2 °C, the laser source was turned down and the natural cooling process started. During the temperature rising process, a portion of light was absorbed and converted to heat energy by the samples with light-to-heat conversion efficiency (η). Some of the gained heat energy was converted to the internal energy of the suspensions, resulting in a temperature rise until it reached the equilibrium state, while the other heat energy was dissipated to the environment. Based on a series of derivations described in the ESI Note S2,† the η of the photothermal materials can be obtained by eqn (3): (3)where F is the proportional coefficient that describes the heat loss process, Teq is the maximum suspension temperature achieved when the equilibrium state is reached during the test, which is also the starting temperature of the suspensions at the time when the laser is shut down, T0 is the temperature of the ambient air, and F can be deduced by the temperature of the suspensions (T), as follows (eqn (4)): (4)where m and Cp are the mass and heat capacity of the suspensions, respectively. Fig. 3c presents  as a function of time (t) for the Cu-PC and Cu1.0-PC suspensions. The linear correlation implies that F and mCp can be regarded as constant in the small temperature range (25–45 °C) in present tests. The calculated F values and η are listed in Table S1.† The η of Cu1.0-PC was as high as 93.43%, displaying an excellent light-to-heat conversion performance, while Cu-PC without plasmonic Cu nanoparticles had a lower η of 86.83%. This result demonstrates that the combination of high absorption and low-cost non-precious metal plasmonic Cu with hierarchical carbons is an effective way to design highly efficient photothermal materials.

(b) Time-dependent temperature profiles for Cu-PC and Cu1.0-PC under 808 nm laser irradiation, where the solution concentration was 0.5 mg mL−1. (c) Plots of versus t for Cu-PC and Cu1.0-PC, and the slopes were calculated based on linear regression. 
To improve the thermal energy utilization efficiency of the solar absorbers, a sandwich hydrogel with confined Cu1.0-PC was specially designed. Fig. 4a shows the photographs of the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC with solar absorbers confined in the evaporation surface. It can be seen from Fig. 4b that there was a clear boundary between the upper light-absorbing materials and bottom hydrogel network, and the thickness of the Cu1.0-PC layer was ∼125 μm. The top-view SEM image in Fig. 4c shows that the Cu1.0-PC was actually covered by a thin layer of PVA hydrogel, which could also be proved by the white region of the dry L2.5-Cu1.0-PC gel inserted in Fig. 4a. For comparison, a black homogeneous hydrogel (H2.5-Cu1.0-PC) with Cu1.0-PC uniformly distributed in the whole PVA network was prepared by a rapid liquid nitrogen freezing method (Fig. 4d–f). We then investigated the light-absorption performance of the two hydrogels prepared with the same Cu1.0-PC addition amount in Fig. 4g. The wet gels exhibited more improved light absorption than the dry gels due to the relatively high refractive index of water, which can improve the transmittance of light. Moreover, the wet L2.5-Cu1.0-PC exhibited an extremely high light absorption of 96.43%, which was also slightly higher than the wet H2.5-Cu1.0-PC (94.63%). It is worth noting that the confinement strategy of the solar absorbers could not only improve the light absorption but also enhance the heat localization performance, which will be discussed in detail later. Additionally, the dry L2.5-Cu1.0-PC gel showed an excellent compressive performance in Fig. 4h, showing no obvious deformation under the pressure of 400 g. As shown in Fig. 4i, a large-size L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel with a diameter of ∼17.5 cm could be easily prepared for outdoor tests, which proved the feasibility of large-size devices production.

(i) Photograph of a large-scale L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel with a diameter of about 17.5 cm. 
We then turn toward investigating the thermal management and water evaporation performance of the two hydrogels. As shown in Fig. S10,† the preparation of the two hydrogels was completely controllable. The L-Cu1.0-PC hydrogels almost had faster water evaporation rates than the H-Cu1.0-PC hydrogels at all parallel Cu1.0-PC loading concentrations (Fig. S11†). Moreover, the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC with an evaporation rate of 2.08 kg m−2 h−1 still exhibited better performance than the H5.0-Cu1.0-PC, which had the highest evaporation rate of 2.03 kg m−2 h−1 among the H-Cu1.0-PC hydrogels, though its Cu1.0-PC loading concentration was only 50% of that of H5.0-Cu1.0-PC. With the same loading amount, the evaporation rate of L2.5-Cu1.0-PC was 1.11 times and 10.4 times that of H2.5-Cu1.0-PC (1.87 kg m−2 h−1) and the pure water (0.20 kg m−2 h−1), respectively (Fig. 5a and b). The calculated energy conversion efficiencies of L2.5-Cu1.0-PC, H2.5-Cu1.0-PC, and pure water were about 85.6%, 80.5%, and 11.9%, respectively. The energy conversion efficiency is derived from the equivalent evaporation enthalpy (Fig. S12†), and the calculation process is described in the ESI Note S3 in detail.†44,45 It is discussed in Fig. 4g that the light absorption of L2.5-Cu1.0-PC was only 2.07% higher than that of H2.5-Cu1.0-PC. However, its energy conversion efficiency was improved by 5.1%. Therefore, we studied the temperature rising and temperature distribution features of the two hydrogels to further reveal their inherent thermal management differences. As shown in Fig. 5c–e, the surface temperature of the hydrogel rose rapidly and reached steady state in about 15 min. The highest temperature of the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel was about 36.3 °C, while it was only 33.7 °C for H2.5-Cu1.0-PC. It can be seen from the detailed temperature distribution images in Fig. 5f and g that L2.5-Cu1.0-PC exhibited a more significant temperature drop from 36.3 °C to 27.2 °C than that of L2.5-Cu1.0-PC from 33.7 °C to 28.6 °C, indicating the excellent heat localization capability of the sandwich membrane structure. Furthermore, an analysis on the energy balance of the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC was conducted and is reported in the ESI Note S4.† As shown in Fig. S13,† the radiation heat loss, convection heat loss, and conduction heat loss were 3.8%, 3.1%, and 7.7%, respectively. The obtained high energy conversion efficiency of about 85.6% could be mainly attributed to the improved thermal management capability of the sandwich membrane structure and the low thermal conductivity (0.403 W m−1 K−1) of the PVA polymer (Fig. S14†). In comparison to some of the recent reports shown in Table S2,† the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel with a high evaporation of 2.08 kg m−2 h−1 and energy conversion efficiency of 85.6% is among the top high-efficiency solar evaporators. Thus, a sandwich hydrogel prepared by a simple natural settling method can reduce the usage of light-absorbing materials without affecting the water evaporation rate, effectively saving production costs.

IR images show the detailed temperature distribution of the: (f) L2.5-Cu1.0-PC device and (g) H2.5-Cu1.0-PC device after illuminating under 1 sun for 30 min. 
To further demonstrate the application potential of the sandwich hydrogels, several application tests were performed. As shown in Fig. 6a, the salinity of the seawater had little influence on evaporation rate until it reached the saturation limit of ∼365 g kg−1. The ICP-MS result in Fig. 6b shows that the concentrations of the four primary ions were significantly reduced by three to four orders, which is far below the World Health Organization drinking water standard. As for the anti-salt-fouling capability, salt crystals could be eliminated in 60 min under 1 sun after loading on the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel, confirming its excellent self-cleaning property (Fig. 6c). After 1 sun illumination over 200 h, the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel could maintain an evaporation rate around 2.08 kg m−2 h−1, suggesting an excellent long-term stability (Fig. 6d). Furthermore, an outdoor solar desalination setup was constructed, as shown in Fig. S15,† to assess the daily water production of the fabricated device. All the tests took place on the roof of the State Key Laboratory of Marine Resources Utilization in South China Sea at Hainan University, and the corresponding environmental temperature and humidity data are recorded in Fig. S16.† As shown in Fig. 6e, an excellent water production rate of ∼1.1 L m−2 h−1 could be achieved for sunny days under an average sunlight intensity of ∼0.8 kW m−2. The average production rate was ∼0.74 L m−2 h−1 (∼7.4 L m−2 day−1) for 20 consecutive days, which can satisfy the individual drinking needs. For the antibacterial tests, two representative bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus) were spread evenly over the agar surface, then the tailored L2.5-Cu1.0-PC were placed on the agar and cultured for 12 h. It can be seen in Fig. 6f that the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogels exhibited two obvious bacteria inhibition zones, indicating their excellent antibacterial effect on both Gram negative and positive bacteria. As a proof-of-conception demonstration, the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel also presented superior adsorption to the dissolved metal ions and organic dyes in water. On the one hand, Cu-PC with a high specific surface area exhibited an excellent physical adsorption performance. As shown in Fig. S17a,† Cu-PC showed a high adsorption of ∼508 mg g−1, and this could be further improved to ∼532 mg g−1 after Cu decoration (Cu1.0-PC). The intuitive adsorption effect is shown in the optical pictures in Fig. S18a and b (ESI Note S5).† On the other hand, the large molecular network of the PVA hydrogel with numerous –OH groups provided a superior chemical adsorption platform.46 The concentration of organic dye in wastewater had no significant influence on the dye removal efficiency of L2.5-Cu1.0-PC (Fig. S19†). As shown in Fig. 6g, the concentration of metal ions (Cr3+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+) in water was reduced by one order of magnitude after the L2.5-Cu1.0-PC hydrogel floated on the water sample for 2 h. Metal ions tended to accept the free electron pair off oxygen and form chelate bonds with the –OH groups from the PVA molecular chains. In Fig. 6i, the blue color of methyl blue faded away, since the –OH groups of PVA were able to form hydrogen bonding with N- and O-containing groups of many organic dyes. It can be seen from the ICP-MS results in Fig. 6g and h that the concentrations of heavy metal ions were further reduced by three to five orders of magnitude via the evaporation process. As a whole, the overall concentration of heavy metal ions was reduced by four to six orders of magnitude after the simultaneous one-step adsorption and solar evaporation desalination (Fig. 6h), which is comparable to some current purification techniques.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated a sandwich hydrogel with confined plasmonic Cu/carbon cells for efficient solar water purification. The confinement of solar absorbers at the evaporation surface could achieve superior light absorption and efficient thermal management, which not only improves the entire light-to-vapor generation efficiency but also reduces the usage of solar absorbers and saves production costs. More importantly, careful investigations on the internal stress and the electron transfer between the plasmonic Cu and the carbon cells revealed that a simple in situ catalytic growth strategy could achieve the goal of protecting Cu nanoparticles from oxidation for plasmonic heat generation. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the obtained sandwich hydrogel could also reduce the concentrations of heavy metal ions by four to six orders of magnitude after simultaneous one-step adsorption and solar distillation, which is comparable to current purification techniques. It is believed that the successful combination of the broadband absorption biomass carbons and the plasmonic non-precious metals is capable of opening up a new pathway for designing highly efficient and cheap photothermal materials in the near future.
