    , Accepted 27th March 2019First published on 27th March 2019AbstractHerein, we designed and synthesized a highly fluorescent non-fullerene acceptor (ANT-4F) based on an anthracene (ANT) core. OSCs based on ANT-4F/PBDB-TF exhibited a significantly decreased Vloss,non-rad of 0.22 V (calculated from high EQEEL = 1.7 × 10−4). Simultaneously, high charge-transfer state energy (ECT = 1.54 eV) was obtained. Compared with OSCs based on IT-4F/PBDB-TF, a reduced Vloss,non-rad and higher ECT concurrently contributed to an increased Voc of 0.93 V. Consequently, despite the lower Jsc of 19.0 mA cm−2, an overall high PCE of 13.1% can be obtained. This work exemplified the great potential for highly fluorescent NFSAs in decreasing Vloss,non-rad and improving PCEs.
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted broad interest due to advantages such as their light weight, solution-processability, transparency and flexibility.1–4 Compared to traditional fullerene acceptors, organic non-fullerene small molecular acceptors (NFSAs) with high structure modifiability, strong optical absorption, and low cost of synthesis show great potential.5–10 The rapid progress of NFSAs has been realized since ITIC7 was reported in 2015, resulting in outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 14% (ref. 11) in single-junction solar cells and 17% (ref. 12) in multi-junction solar cells in a relatively short period of time.
Compared to fullerene-based OSCs, a significant advantage of NFSA-based solar cells is their reduced voltage loss, which is a crucial parameter that determines the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of OSCs and thus PCEs. The overall voltage loss (Vloss) consists of recombination losses and electron-transfer losses due to the formation of more delocalized charge-transfer states (CTs) from strongly bound excitons generated in the neat donor or acceptor material. Neglectable electron-transfer losses (<50 meV) can be obtained by methods like reducing energetic and morphological disorder in blends13 and optimizing the chemical structures of photovoltaic materials.14–16 Also, voltage losses generated from radiative CT recombination (Vloss,rad) can be reduced to about 250 meV through a smaller donor–acceptor interface area.17 The last fraction of Vloss is due to non-radiative recombination, which is called non-radiative voltage loss (Vloss,non-rad), defined below, and is least well understood. An inductive report summarizes that non-radiative voltage losses decrease with increasing charge-transfer-state energies (ECT):18qVloss,non-rad = −kTln(EQEEL)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is electron charge and EQEEL is the radiative quantum efficiency of solar cells when charge carriers are injected into the device in the dark.
In OSCs, Vloss,non-rad is usually in the range of 0.30–0.48 V, which is much larger than highly efficient inorganic (0.18 V) or perovskite solar cells (0.10 V). As compared with the electron-transfer losses and Vloss,rad, Vloss,non-rad therefore often constitutes the largest part of the total voltage losses in OSCs. Theoretical and experimental studies of photovoltaic materials have indicated that a combination of light extraction and external luminescence yield are clearly relevant for high-performance cells.19 To obtain low Vloss,non-rad, OSCs should work as good light-emitting diodes with high EQEEL. Previously reported high-performance NFSAs were designed using an A–D–A (acceptor–donor–acceptor) molecular structure,7,20–22 and their donor moieties usually consist of multi-thiophene-fused rings.9,23–27 These donor components exhibit strong visible light absorption but relatively weak fluorescence. A highly fluorescent core is needed for reduced Vloss,non-rad. Previously, several anthracene (ANT)-based materials that exhibit remarkable device performances in the fields of organic thin film transistors (OTFT) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLED)28–31 were reported by our group. These ANT-derivatives showed excellent molecular planarity, good charge transport ability and high fluorescence quantum yields, which are the expected properties of NFSAs with low Vloss,non-rad.
Hence, here we innovatively report a strong fluorescent NFSA named ANT-4F (Fig. 1) based on an anthracene core. ANT-4F exhibits broad strong light absorption, suited energy levels with donor material, appropriate phase separation and high electron mobility. OSCs based on ANT-4F/PBDB-TF show the best device performances with a Voc of 0.93 V, Jsc of 19.0 mA cm−2, FF of 74%, and PCE of 13.1%. Specifically, ANT-4F/PBDB-TF blended films showed a high EQEEL = 1.7 × 10−4 (under 298.15 K), corresponding to a quite small Vloss,non-rad = 0.22 V, which approaches that of c-Si solar cells. Conversely, IT-4F/PBDB-TF-based OSCs present much lower EQEEL = 2.5 × 10−5 (under 298.15 K) and increased Vloss,non-rad = 0.28 V. Simultaneously, FTPS-EQE shows that the ANT-4F/PBDB-TF blend has a larger ECT (1.54 eV) than IT-4F/PBDB-TF (ECT = 1.47 eV). Consequently, despite the difference in photocurrent values, the improved Voc of ANT-4F-based OSCs led to higher PCEs than IT-4F-based ones (13.1% for ANT-4F and 13.0% for IT-4F). This paper reports the application of the anthracene group as highly fluorescent NFSAs with good device performances, and it possesses an effective method in the design of small Vloss,non-rad photovoltaic materials.

The synthetic route of the target acceptor ANT-4F is shown in Scheme 1. The anthracene boronic acid ester (compound 1) was obtained in good yield from 2,6-dibromoanthracene, according to the literature.31 Raw material 2 was synthesized using 2-bromo-3-thiophene acetic acid and alcohol. Compound 3 was prepared by the Suzuki coupling reaction with compound 1 and compound 2. The tertiary alcohol intermediate 4 was prepared through lithiation and hydrolysis reactions. Two ring-closing products had the potential to be obtained through the dehydration reaction, as there are two reactive sites in anthracene. Compound 5 was confirmed as the correct product according to the 1H-NMR spectrum presented in the ESI.† The dialdehyde compound 6 was prepared by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with POCl3 and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The target acceptor was prepared through the condensation of compound 6 with IC-2F catalyzed by pyridine in high yields. The chemical structure of ANT-4F was confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and mass spectrum (ESI†).

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of ANT-4F (dichloromethane solution and thin film) and PBDB-TF are shown in Fig. 2a. The ANT-4F film presents a remarkable absorption redshift of almost 60 nm compared to its solution with an absorption edge of 778 nm. This indicates that molecular ANT-4F has strong π–π stacking and intensive intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect due to a planar and rigid anthracene core. The planarity of molecular ANT-4F was also confirmed by the molecular structure calculation shown in Fig. 2c and d. The optical band gap (Eoptg) of 1.68 eV was calculated through the wavelength corresponding to the crossing point of the absorption spectrum and the fluorescence emission spectrum (Fig. S4†). The Eoptg of IT-4F was calculated similarly as 1.62 eV. This indicates that ANT-4F molecularly has a strong π–π stacking and intensive intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect due to a planar and rigid anthracene core. The planarity of ANT-4F molecular is also confirmed by the molecular structure calculation shown in Fig. 2c and d. A cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was adopted, as shown in Fig. 2b, to explore the molecular energy levels of ANT-4F. The HOMO energy level was calculated from the onset oxidation potentials and calibrated by ferrocene/ferrocenium. The LUMO energy level was calculated by LUMO = HOMO + Eoptg, and presents LUMO/HOMO values of −4.01 eV/−5.69 eV.

The photoluminescence of neat ANT-4F and IT-4F thin films were measured at an excitation wavelength of 450 nm, as shown in Fig. 3a. By applying the same optical grating width (2 nm) and film thickness (100 nm), the largest emission intensity of neat ANT-4F film is 1.24 × 106 (at an emission wavelength of 746 nm), which is more than 100 times stronger than that of the IT-4F film (8.92 × 103 at an emission wavelength of 799 nm). To further confirm the high fluorescent property of ANT-4F, the quantum yields of photoluminescence (PLQY) of these two materials are measured as shown in Fig. S3.† The PLQY of ANT-4F is 41.92% and is much higher than that of IT-4F (PLQY = 17.76%). This significant difference demonstrates that by utilizing an anthracene core, the photoluminescence of the acceptor could be remarkably strengthened. To clearly demonstrate that the improved fluorescence of ANT-4F is due to the anthracene core, two NFSAs (IDT-4F and NT-4F, Fig. S2†) that are similar in molecular structure were compared. We found that phenyl-based IDT-4F and naphthyl-based NT-4F show similar PLQY of 13.20% and 14.87%, respectively (Fig. S3†). We further tested the PL spectrum of donor/acceptor blend films, as shown in Fig. 3b. What remains is that ANT-4F/PBDB-TF blend films still present stronger emissions than IT-4F/PBDB-TF blend films. Notably, the photoluminescence of ANT-4F was sharply quenched by PBDB-TF when mixed, which indicates that the channel II charge generation32,33 is working well here and that efficient hole transportation from the acceptor to the donor can be achieved.

The light-emitting devices were fabricated using a converted structure of ITO/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. The EL spectrum indicating a relationship between emission energy density and the emission wavelength was obtained, as shown in Fig. 3d. An identical test condition was applied, and apparently, the emission intensity of an ANT-4F-based blend film is much stronger than that of an IT-4F-based one, which matches well with the PL spectrum shown in Fig. 3a. In OSCs, Vloss,non-rad is usually in the range of 0.30–0.48 V, which is much larger than highly efficient inorganic (0.18 V) or perovskite solar cells (0.10 V).34 ANT-4F/PBDB-TF-based OSCs showed a high EQEEL = 1.7 × 10−4 (under 298.15 K), corresponding to a quite small Vloss,non-rad = 0.22 V, which, to the best of our knowledge, is one of the lowest Vloss,non-rad for OSCs reported to date. In contrast, the EQEEL of IT-4F/PBDB-TF-based OSCs decreased to 2.5 × 10−5 (under 298.15 K) with a larger Vloss,non-rad = 0.28 V. Simultaneously, FTPS-EQE measurements were performed on the blend devices, as presented in Fig. 3c. The charge-transfer-state energies (ECT) of blends can be obtained using the fitted curve, which is 1.54 eV for the ANT-4F/PBDB-TF blends and 1.47 eV for IT-4F/PBDB-TF blends. The relationship between ECT and voltage losses in OSCs is shown below.18qVloss = ECT − qVoc = qVloss,rad + qVloss,non-rad
As shown in Table 1, the radiative recombination voltage loss of OSCs based on ANT-4F or IT-4F exhibits a tiny difference of 20 mV, and the apparent smaller overall voltage loss of ANT-4F-based OSCs is due to a lower Vloss,non-rad.

Photovoltaic devices with a converted device structure of ITO/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. We choose the wide-band-gap (1.89 eV) polymer donor PBDB-TF due to its complementary absorption at 450–650 nm and deep HOMO energy level (−5.54 eV) to match with ANT-4F. Also, OSCs based on IT-4F/PBDB-TF were fabricated as a contrast. Table 2 summarizes the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE of the optimized devices. As shown in Table 2, all OSCs exhibited a high FF of about 75%, which indicates a good charge transfer and separation process. This can be explained by the balanced and high hole/electron mobilities of the ANT-4F/PBDB-TF blend (μh = 7.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).

We found that for ANT-4F, higher PCEs could be obtained from OSCs fabricated using chloroform (CF) than those using chlorobenzene (CB) due to the increased Jsc. This is possibly due to the improved solubility of ANT-4F in CF compared to in CB, which allows for a higher concentration of acceptor in the blend solution.35 Simultaneously, the fast evaporation of CF avoids the formation of large macroscopic ANT-4F domains. However, compared to IT-4F/PBDB-TF-based OSCs, a lower Jsc is shown due to the relatively narrow light absorption range of ANT-4F, and a higher Voc of 0.93 V was obtained (Fig. 4a). As a result, the highest PCE of ANT-4F/PBDB-TF-based OSCs reached up to 13.1% and is higher than that of IT-4F/PBDB-TF-based OSCs (PCE = 13.0%). The photon energy loss (Eloss) was calculated using the formula Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc. The Eloss values of PBDB-TF/ANT-4F-based OSCs is 0.74 eV, which is 50 meV smaller than that of IT-4F/PBDB-TF (0.79 eV). This is possibly due to the smaller non-radiative recombination as presented in Table 1. Fig. 4b shows that the highest external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of ANT-4F reached over 75% (78.4% at 580 nm), and the highest Jsc value of ANT-4F-based OSCs calculated from integration of the EQE spectra with the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum was 18.2 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the Jsc values measured from the J–V curve (the error is under 5%, Table 2).

The morphological features of the blend films were characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the height and phase images of the AFM (see Fig. 5a and b), the ANT-4F/PBDB-TF blended films exhibited a roughness value of 2.125 nm and were effective for charge transport. According to the TEM images in Fig. 5c, the ANT-4F/PBDB-TF blended films displayed a dense nanofibrous network, which suggested good molecular aggregation and suitable phase separation size.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized an organic non-fullerene acceptor (ANT-4F) with a core of anthracene. ANT-4F showed strong visible absorption, good molecular planarity, high electron mobility, and good miscibility with the polymer donor (PBDB-TF). Hence, OSCs based on ANT-4F/PBDB-TF presented excellent device performances. It is worth noting that compared to IT-4F, ANT-4F generated a much stronger fluorescence due to its anthracene core. ANT-4F/PBDB-TF blended films showed high EQEEL = 1.7 × 10−4 (under 298.15 K) and corresponds to a quite small Vloss,non-rad = 0.22 V, which is 60 mV lower than that of IT-4F/PBDB-TF. Simultaneously, a high charge-transfer state energy (ECT = 1.54 eV) was obtained. Compared with OSCs based on IT-4F/PBDB-TF, a reduced Vloss,non-rad and higher ECT concurrently contributed to an increased Voc of 0.93 V. Consequently, despite the lower Jsc of 19.0 mA cm−2, an overall high PCE of 13.1% can be obtained. This work exemplified the great potential for highly fluorescent NFSAs in decreasing Vloss,non-rad and improving PCEs.
