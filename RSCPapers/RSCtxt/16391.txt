    , Accepted 24th December 2019First published on 26th December 2019AbstractThe fabrication of high-performance graphene aerogels by economical and efficient routes is still a challenge. Herein, we prepared ultralight, highly elastic graphene/coal oxide (GC) aerogels with low-cost and simple routes, in which coal oxide was first introduced into the skeleton of graphene aerogels to prevent the severe stacking of graphene nanosheets. After the chemical grafting of the long carbon chains, the modified graphene/coal oxide (MGC) aerogels exhibited excellent hydrophobicity (140°). The ultralight MGC showed outstanding compression performance, recovering to about 100% with the compressive strain of 95% in a dry environment. Meanwhile, the optimized amount of coal oxide could also increase the absorption capacity of the aerogel by 196-fold. Moreover, the super-absorption capacity increased by up to 387 times its own mass via further carbonation treatment. Furthermore, the obtained MGC exhibited excellent absorption reusability in absorption/combustion cycles. Additionally, the MGC can be used as an interfacial solar vapor evaporator with an efficiency of 76% under 1 sun. On the basis of the viable synthesis method, the ultralight and compressive aerogels have promising applications in organic pollution cleanup and solar steam generation.
1. Introduction
In the past years, the increasing water pollution arising from industries and oil spills has become one of the major global concerns as it can bring about a serious challenge to the ecological equilibrium and human health. Up to now, a series of carbon aerogels have been prepared to handle the above-mentioned pollutants, and they typically include carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/graphene hybrid aerogels,1–3 CNT sponges,4 graphene/fiber aerogels,5–7 biomass/graphene aerogels,8,9 polymer-based aerogels10 and porous carbon fibers.11,12 Among all the carbon-based aerogels, graphene-based aerogels have attracted extensive attention due to their high porosity, intrinsic hydrophobicity, large internal surface area, and great chemical stability. However, a pure graphene aerogel (GA) is generally brittle and non-compressive due to the huge pore channels after the removal of ice crystals.1 Also, although we can produce GO in large quantities, using pure GO to build carbon-based aerogels is still expensive, which limits the large-scale applications of GO. Moreover, pure GA tends to over-stack among GO nanosheets, which would consume a lot of the specific surface area, resulting in an unsatisfactory absorption performance.13 Recently, there has been a growing tendency to combine GO with other abundant and cheap natural resources to fabricate an ideal absorbent material, such as cellulose nanocrystals,14–16 hull,8 chitosan,17–19 lignin,20 and plant extracts.21 Among all natural resources, coal is a kind of traditional energy resource that has been successfully applied to thermal power and produce new carbon materials with high performance, such as graphene quantum dots,22 electrocatalysts,23 electrode materials,24–27 CNTs,28 and dye-sensitized solar cells.29 In our group's previous work, coal-derived porous carbon fibers were fabricated by single-nozzle electrospinning, which subsequently underwent thermal treatment to yield a coal-based material with outstanding capacitance and organic matter absorption.12 Meanwhile, our group very recently developed a simple strategy to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes by chemical welding and in situ activation through graphene quantum dots, which showed high surface areas and high volumetric capacitances.30 Furthermore, Chen et al. utilized bituminous coal to prepare bifunctional oxygen electrodes that could be used as valuable bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts.31 Qiu et al. used coal tar pitch as carbon precursors to prepare high-performance sodium-ion battery anodes.32 They believed that the synergistic effect among the morphology, large specific surface area, high nitrogen content, and appropriate mesoporous structure was beneficial for electrolyte penetration. Jia et al. described a facile way to fabricate coal-derived graphene quantum dots with strong blue emission by anthracite coal, which could be used as fluorescent probes to detect Cu2+ in water.33 On the other hand, the huge potential of coal oxide (CO) depends on its structure; coal oxide is a conjugated aromatic system consisting of abundant structures and oxygen-containing branches,34 which would enhance the potential for different types of crosslinking with GO to improve the stability of composite aerogels. Coal oxide is thus considered as a promising modifying agent for preparing high-performance graphene-based aerogels.
Herein, we report the development of ultralight, highly compressible, and low-cost coal oxide-modified graphene aerogels through the freeze-drying process. Dopamine hydrochloride constructed cross-linking points between GO and CO. The whole preparation process of the composite aerogel did not require the addition of any toxic and harmful organic solvents. Thus, it is an eco-friendly absorption material. During the hydrothermal treatment, GO self-assembled to form the hydrogels, whereas coal oxide could not do so. Thus, the GO nanosheets acted as a driving force and coal oxide acted as an obstacle that opposed the motion of the GO sheets. It is a trade-off relationship between the driving effect and the blocking effect of coal oxide to form a rod-shaped hydrogel. Therefore, the addition of coal oxide had to be carefully controlled. After the chemical vapor deposition of hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS), the as-prepared aerogels showed hydrophobicity. The results showed that the introduction of coal oxide prevented the over-stacking of the GO nanosheets and improved the mechanical properties of the composite aerogel. Meanwhile, the composite aerogels exhibited high recoverability, being able to recover the original morphology when undergoing compression stress at 95% in a dry state. Benefiting from its ultralight weight, high elasticity, and hydrophobic nature, the prepared aerogel exhibits large absorption capacity (85–196 times its own weight) and outstanding recyclability. This absorption capacity is dramatically higher than that of GA and even higher than that of most coal-based or graphene-based absorbents. Moreover, MGC can generate fresh water with a high efficiency of 76% at 1 sun. Considering the low fabrication cost, mass production, and outstanding physicochemical properties, these aerogels exhibit a promising prospect in high-performance selective organic liquids and solar vapor generation.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
GO was obtained from Gaoxi Techn. Co., Ltd, China. Dopamine hydrochloride, hexadecyltrimethoxysilane, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris–HCl) and organic liquids were purchased from Aladdin, China. Coal was obtained from Heishan, Xinjiang, China. All reagents were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Preparation of the MGC aerogel
CO was prepared via the solution-based oxidation process as described in our previous report.35 The preparation of the MGC aerogel is shown in Fig. 1. In a typical run, a certain amount of CO was added into the mixture solution consisting of dopamine hydrochloride and GO and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 4 h to form a stable suspension (4 mg cm−3), which was then adjusted to a uniform pH value of 8.5 using a Tris–HCl buffer solution. Next, the mixture solution was sealed and heated in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 °C for 3 h. After the Teflon-lined autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the as-prepared graphene hydrogel was poured out and immersed in deionized water to remove any residual reagent. Finally, the graphene hydrogel was pre-frozen at −80 °C for 12 h and then freeze-dried at −50 °C for 36 h to obtain the coal oxide-modified graphene aerogel. GA without the modification of CO was also prepared using the same steps for comparison. In order to prepare the hydrophobic MGC, HDTMS, a representative of silane with a long carbon chain, was used as a modifier. In the process of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), 20 mg of the as-prepared GC was placed into a vacuum desiccator to co-heat with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (2 μL) at 180 °C for 3 h.

2.3 Characterization
The surface morphology was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan). The surface chemical composition was explored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of all aerogels were acquired using a Bruker VERTEX 70 with a scan range of 800–4000 cm−1. The phase structures of all samples were collected through powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (D8 advance, Bruker, Germany) in the 2θ range from 5 to 80°. The stress–strain curves of MGC were measured on a universal material testing machine (H5K-T, Tinius Olsen, USA) using a 500-N load cell.
2.4 Absorption experiments
The absorption capacity of MGC for organic pollutants was investigated by weighing the sample before and after absorption saturation. The weight gain (Qwt, g g−1) was evaluated by the following equation:  Here, me and mo are the saturated absorption mass of the aerogel and the virgin mass of the samples, respectively. All samples (5 mg) were immersed into oil or organic solutions for 5 min until the sample mass remained unchanged with gradually increasing time.
2.5 Steam generation experiments
The sample was floated on water in a glass tube that was surrounded by insulating foam. The sample was then irradiated by a solar simulator (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight). The mass change was captured using a high accuracy balance (BSA224s, Sartorius), and the temperature of the evaporation surface was recorded using an IR camera (FOTRIC 222s).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The morphology of MGC
The micromorphology of MGC was investigated by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 2a, GO nanosheets and CO self-assemble into a multileveled and well-defined porous MGC aerogel network, which can be proved by the pore size distribution ranging from mesopores to macropores (Fig. S1, ESI†). Such a long-scale directional aligned porous structure provided a specific surface area for the absorption of organic pollutants. The difference in the appearance of the prepared hydrogels and aerogels with diverse mass ratios of GO and CO is presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It can be noted that the lamellar pore walls exhibit a honeycomb-like structure (Fig. 2a and b),36,37 where CO is well embedded into the space of the GO nanosheets (Fig. 2c), thus avoiding the over-stacking of the GO sheets. According to a previous report, this structure is beneficial for excellent compressibility.38,39 The ultralight weight of MGC was proved by standing it on top of a dandelion (Fig. S3, ESI†). Besides, the distribution of carbon (C) atoms, oxygen (O) atoms, nitrogen (N) atoms, sulfur (S) atoms, and silicon (Si) atoms was investigated by elemental mapping measurements (Fig. 2d). The Si element was uniformly co-localized over the graphene sheet, suggesting the successful grafting of carbon chains. Meanwhile, we observed the signal of S, which originated from CO (Fig. S4, ESI†),35 and it was uniformly dispersed on the surface of the GO nanosheets. This illustrated that CO was uniformly dispersed on the surface of the GO nanosheet.

3.2 The chemistry characterization of MGC
XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and XPS were used to characterize the chemical composition of the aerogels. First, the XRD spectra of CO, GO, GC, and MGC are presented in Fig. 3a to investigate the structural evolution. The broad characteristic peaks of CO appear at 12.3° and 24.3°, which suggest the amorphous nature of the material. For GO, the characteristic peak was observed at 12.1°, which illustrated the existence of unreduced oxygen functional groups. In contrast, the GC composite material showed peaks at 11.8° and 25.8°, corresponding to the typical profiles of GO and CO. The interlayer spacing of MGC was 0.35 nm (the diffraction peak at 2θ ≈ 25.7°), which was similar to that of GO, suggesting that CO penetrated into GA with less effects on the ordered lamellar structure. Raman spectroscopy can characterize graphitic materials to reveal the order and defects in carbons with a nondestructive approach. The characteristic peaks of CO, GO, GC and MGC are shown in Fig. 3b. Two obvious peaks are observed at 1350 cm−1 and 1589 cm−1, corresponding to the D-band and G-band. It is well-known that the D band is associated with the defects and disordered arrangement of the sp3 lattice, while the G band is related to the vibration of the sp2 carbon atoms in graphitic carbon. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) indicates the degree of structural defects and disorder. From the results, the relative intensity ratio (ID/IG) of GC was calculated to be 0.94, which was slightly weaker than that of GO (0.98), revealing that coal oxide was inserted in the nanosheet of GO via non-covalent interactions and covalent interactions without introducing extra defects. Meanwhile, the ID/IG value decreased slightly from 0.94 to 0.90 when GC was deposited by HDTMS to form MGC, which indicated the elimination of partial oxygen-containing groups and a partial shift of GO to rGO. FTIR spectroscopy was used to monitor the change in the organo-functional group during the preparation process. As shown in Fig. 3c, CO exhibits absorption bands at 1720 cm−1 (–CO), 1624 cm−1 (–CC), 3427 cm−1 and 1400 cm−1 (O–H and C–O), and 1180 cm−1 and 1136 cm−1 (–SO3H), indicating the presence of abundant functional groups. For GO, characteristic absorption bands were observed at 3427 cm−1 and 1396 cm−1 for the hydroxyl group (O–H and C–O), 1627 cm−1 for aromatic CC, 1076 cm−1 for the epoxy group (C–O), and 1720 cm−1 for the carbonyl group (CO). After the hydrothermal method, the absorption bands for the epoxy (1076 cm−1) and carbonyl (1720 cm−1) groups of GC almost disappeared, which suggested the elimination of these oxygen-containing groups at a high temperature (180 °C) and good interaction between GO and CO. In addition, the emergence of new peaks at 1503 cm−1 (shearing vibration of N–H of the amide group) and 1296 cm−1 (stretching vibration of C–OH in the phenolic group) can be associated with the polymerization of dopamine. After modification, the intensity of the –CH2 (2850 and 2918 cm−1) bonds notably increases, which can offer supporting evidence for the successful grafting of the hydrophobic carbon chains on GC. The FTIR results clearly illustrated that dopamine, as a crosslinking agent, was successfully coated on the surface between GO and CO, while GC was successfully grafted with hydrophobic carbon chains. XPS analysis was used to further investigate the surface element composition in the modification process. As shown in Fig. 3d, the peaks for C 1s and O 1s are clearly detected from GC and MGC, while MGC shows two new peaks associated with Si 2p and Si 2s. Furthermore, the C/O ratio of 1.26 in GC increased to 7.28 in MGC (Table S1, ESI†), which was assigned to the successful modification by a higher C/O ratio silane and the consumption of oxygen-containing functional groups. The core level C 1s (Fig. 3e) and Si 2p spectra (Fig. 3f) gave further evidence for the successful grafting of silane. For GC, the C–O bonds were more abundant, which resulted in the potential to be easily grafted by low-surface-energy silane. On MGC, the proportion of the C–O bonds drastically decreased from 24.8% to 7.5% owing to the grafting of hydrophobic carbon chains (Table S2, ESI†). Moreover, the Si 2p peak, fitted into the Si–O–Si and Si–O–C bonds, confirmed the interfacial reactions of HDTMS with GC and the silane molecules. As a result of modification, the MGC aerogels became hydrophobic with a water contact angle (WGA) of 140° (Fig. S5, ESI†). When the MGC aerogels were immersed in water, the external surface of MGC became coated with air bubbles, which was propitious to the application for oil absorption (Movie S1, ESI†).

3.3 Mechanical property measurements
Compression experiments were used to evaluate the compressibility and elasticity of the aerogel. As an illustration, MGC (GO:CO = 1:1) was used to test the mechanical properties. As shown in Fig. 4a, MGC exhibits excellent ability to retain its original dimension and shape without collapsing after being compressed with high deformation (ε is nearly 95%), indicating its outstanding mechanical flexibility and excellent sorption recovery (Movie S2, ESI†). Meanwhile, MGC presented excellent compressive elasticity in organic liquids (Fig. 4b and Movie S3, ESI†). The improved elasticity could be attributed to the adhesion of coal oxide to the GO sheets by covalent interactions and hydrogen bonding, which created an elastic skeleton within the porous structure. The stress–strain curves were strongly correlated with the interconnecting structure. The effect of the CO content on the compressive properties was explored in detail (Fig. S6, ESI†). It was found that the compressive strength of MGC increased on decreasing the content of CO, suggesting the excellent stiffness of graphene sheets. In the first cycle (Fig. 4c), the maximum strength of MGC compressed to 80% was 51.5 kPa. Thus, it was easy to remove any absorbed liquid by this aerogel. MGC exhibited three stages of deformation: an obvious elastic region (strain 0–39%), a yield region and a densification region; this is similar to previously reported results about GO aerogel materials.40,41 From Fig. 4d, it is obvious that MGC experienced increased strength with compression to a higher strain. During the cyclic strain–stress curves at a strain of up to 50% (Fig. 4e), its maximum compressive stress decreased from 4.73 kPa to 4.28 kPa with a high recovery rate of 90% after 10 cycles, indicating the outstanding mechanical elasticity of MGC. This can be ascribed to the wrinkles and folds of the pore walls of aerogels after being compressed.7

3.4 Applications for selective oil absorption
Water pollution treatment has attracted growing attention from academia in recent years. Combining the ultralow density, excellent mechanical robustness and high surface hydrophobicity, we explored its potential application in organic pollution clean-up and oil absorption. Ultralow density and hydrophobicity endow MGC with high potential for the selective absorption of organic solvents, while the excellent fire-resistant property results in good recycling ability for the removal of organic pollutants. As a demonstration, MGC (GO:CO = 1:1) was used to selectively absorb an organic solution (dichloromethane dyed with Sudan III) on the water surface within a few seconds (Fig. 5a and Movie S4, ESI†). After the absorption process, pure water was immediately obtained. In addition, MGC could be forced into the bottom of water to quickly absorb dichloromethane dyed with Sudan III (Fig. 5b and Movie S5, ESI†). Notably, there was no water penetration into MGC during the whole absorption process. Moreover, after completely absorbing the organic solvent, MGC could also float on the water surface due to its low density and hydrophobicity, which contributed to not only the collection process but also the recycling process. Thus, the porous MGC presents great potential for the selective absorption of organic pollutants from water.

In order to investigate the absorption capacities of MGC, a variety of organic solvents and oil were used. To identify the optimal addition of CO to GO, MGC aerogels with different mass ratios of GO and CO (1:0, 5:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5) were evaluated. With the increase in the content of CO, the absorption capacity was enhanced by 175 times to maximum when the mass ratio of GO and CO was 1:1, which was considerably higher than that of GA (52 times) (Fig. 6a). This could be ascribed to the effect of the CO content on the morphology and structure of the aerogels (Fig. S7, ESI†). When the dosage of CO was low, GO tended to over-stack in the hydrothermal process, which would consume a large amount of the surface area. With the mass ratio of GO:CO increased to 1:3, the absorption capacity of MGC tailed off to 112 times, which could be explained by the result of weight gain. Therefore, the optimal content (GO:CO = 1:1) was used to investigate the absorption capacities toward various organic solvents and oil. As depicted in Fig. 6b, MGC shows excellent absorption ability toward a wide range of organic solvents and oil, including carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane, n-octane, acetone and pump oil. These chemicals are ordinary pollutants during the experiment and from the industry. The absorption capacity ranged from 93 to 196 times, relying on the density and viscosity of the liquids tested; it was also compared with that for previous graphene aerogels (Table S3, ESI†), such as graphene sponges (20–86 g g−1),42 graphene aerogels (120–200 g g−1),43 magnetic graphene foam (10–27 g g−1),44 peanut hull/graphene aerogels (32–79 g g−1),8 PAN nanofibers/graphene aerogels (120–286 g g−1),45 and graphene/cellulose aerogels (44–265 g g−1).46 The absorption capacity was found to be much higher than that of a lot of biomass-based absorbents (Table S4, ESI†), such as coal-based fibers (70 mg g−1),12 melamine/lignin sponges (98–217 g g−1),47 lignin-based xerogels (19–47 g g−1),48 cellulose nanofibril aerogels (88–143 g g−1),49 twisted carbon fibers (50–190 g g−1),11 bamboo-based aerogels (30–129 g g−1),50 sodium alginate foams (73–187 g g−1)51 and melamine sponges (133–284 g g−1).52 After the carbonization treatment of MGC at 800 °C for 2 h, the absorption capacity for various organic liquids and oil dramatically increased, ranging from 170 to 387 g g−1 (Fig. 6c).

(b) The super-absorption capacity of MGC for various organic and oil solvents (including carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane, n-octane, acetone and pump oil) with mass ratios of GO:CO = 1:1. (c) The super-absorption capacity of carbonized MGC (C-MGC) for various organic solvents. 
The reusability of the absorbent is a dramatically important criterion for practical applications. To investigate the recyclability of MGC, absorption–combustion cycles were explored to remove the absorbed organic solvents and oil. The combustion method is a simple and conventional way to completely eliminate flammable organic solvents (such as n-octane). The aerogels showed excellent recyclability with less than 15% decrease in the absorption capacity after 10 cycles (Fig. 7), which further illustrated the excellent fire-resistant property of MGC (Fig. S8, ESI†). The absorption/desorption cycles of MGC exhibited its excellent recyclability. This can be explained by the stable interconnected porous structure, which can be clarified by the SEM images after absorption (Fig. S9, ESI†). Therefore, the prepared aerogels with a directional capillary-driven pump have great potential to be employed for highly efficient organic pollutant absorption and recycling applications owing to their hydrophobicity, ultralow density, high compressibility, excellent absorption performance and reusability.

3.5 Applications for solar vapor generation
Solar-driven water evaporation is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to acquire fresh water. Combining the excellent photothermal transduction,53 interconnected directionally aligned porous structure, hydrophobicity and extraordinary stability under extreme conditions,54 the obtained aerogel is regarded as a promising candidate for water purification. As shown in Fig. 8a, the photothermal properties of MGC and GC are investigated. A simulated solar light (1 sun) was shined on the surface of the aerogel, and the temperature was captured by an infrared (IR) camera. Under light irradiation, GC presented only a slow and low temperature rise, while MGC quickly reached a steady-state temperature of about 62 °C, suggesting the good photothermal performance of MGC. As shown in Fig. 8b, when the aerogel floats on water, the average water evaporation rates of GC and MGC are 1.46 and 1.62 kg m−2 h−1, respectively. The solar thermal conversion efficiency was calculated by55  where η is the solar vapor efficiency, ṁ is the mass flux, hLV is the total enthalpy of sensible heat (sensible + phase change enthalpy), Copt presents the optical concentration and qo is the normal direct solar radiation 1 kW m−2. Accordingly, the solar thermal conversion efficiency of hydrophobic MGC is calculated to be 76% and is higher than that of GC, which is ascribed to the localized heating at the interfacial water and vertically aligned capillary-driven pump in MGC.

4. Conclusions
In this study, an ultralight and hydrophobic MGC was prepared by freeze-drying and simple CVD modification for highly efficient organic pollutant absorption. The obtained interconnected directionally aligned porous structure was highly elastic and fire-resistant, which provided superiority in organic pollutant clean-up and good recyclability. The incorporation of CO into GO nanosheets successfully avoided the over-stacking of the GO nanosheets. Thus, it has great influence on the micromorphology, architecture, mechanical properties and absorption capacity. With the optimized content of CO in GO, MGC exhibits high compressibility and recoverability. When compressed to the strain of 95%, MGC presented a high recovery rate (about 100%) in a dry environment. Moreover, MGC showed a super-absorption capacity of 93–196 times its weight to various organic pollutants and oil. After the carbonization treatment of MGC, the absorption capacity could increase to 170–387 times its weight, which was almost higher than that of previously reported graphene aerogels and surpassed those of all coal-based absorption materials. Besides, MGC achieved superb light-to-heat conversion with a high efficiency of 76% under 1 sun. It is also notable that this work may provide a new strategy to explore the high-value utilization of abundant fossil fuels, such as coal. Therefore, we believe that the efficient and low-cost MGC aerogels will be rapidly extended to widespread applications, including oil pollution clean-up and oil spill remediation, solar steam generation and heavy metal ion adsorption.
