    , Accepted 25th June 2020First published on 25th June 2020AbstractThe innovation of photoactive layer materials is crucial for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report two polymer donors (PBTN-o and PBTN-p), which only differ in alkyl chains substituted at sites (6,7- or 5,8-) of the naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione (NTD) unit. The single crystals of both NTD monomers demonstrate that NTD with alkyl chains at the 6,7-sites has a planar NTD skeleton, and surprisingly, NTD with alkyl chains at the 5,8-sites produces a bent NTD skeleton. The bent NTD-based polymer (PBTN-p) exhibits a more twisted conjugated backbone than PBTN-o. Our comparative studies show that PBTN-p possesses suitable aggregation properties that can optimize the photoactive layer morphology in NF PSCs. In PSCs, the optimal PBTN-o:BO-4Cl-based device shows a PCE of 11.85% with a VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 22.41 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.63. In contrast, the optimal PBTN-p:BO-4Cl-based device exhibits a better PCE of 14.10% with the same VOC of 0.84 V, and an enhanced JSC of 24.67 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.68. This work provides a new insight into BHJ morphology optimization by side chain induced polymer main chain twisting in PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on polymer donors and electron acceptors are an appealing topic and have attracted extensive industrial and research interest in recent years due to their merits of transparency, light weight, flexibility, and high-throughput roll-to-roll production.1,2 To obtain higher power conversion efficiency (PCE), many efforts have been devoted to materials design, device optimization, and mechanism investigation in the last three decades.3–10 A significant achievement is the combination of wide bandgap (WBG) polymer donors and low bandgap (LBG) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with well-matched molecular energy levels as photoactive layer materials11,12 to guarantee a broad absorption spectrum from the visible to the near-infrared region and low energy loss in the given devices. A favourable nanoscale bi-continuous interpenetrating network in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is important to achieve sufficient exciton generation, efficient exciton dissociation, charge transfer, and low charge recombination, resulting in outstanding PCE with a high VOC, JSC, and FF.13–15 To obtain favourable BHJ morphology, the aggregation ability of a new polymer donor in solution has to be carefully optimized.16–19 Therefore, it would be important to develop new polymer donors with appropriate aggregation behaviour.
In conjugated polymers, the alkyl side chain has been proven to have a significant influence on molecular aggregation, π–π stacking, and blend film morphology. Therefore, control of the polymer side chain is crucial to obtain the maximum device performance with a given conjugated backbone. For instance, Huang and co-workers showed that the branching position of alkyl chains on a polymer donor was very important to control polymer aggregation behaviours and optimize the domain size and purity in BHJs. As a result, the PCEs of PTzBI:ITIC-based devices were improved from 6.13% to 7.28%.20 Yan and co-workers reported two polymers with different side chain substituted positions. Such a difference resulted in significantly different extents of polymer backbone torsion. The twisted polymer-based device had a much better PCE (10.40%) than the planar one (7.70%) due to the existence of relatively small domain sizes in the twisted polymer-based device.21 Although the polymer side chains were carefully optimized, only a few building blocks were involved in composing the WBG polymer donors, which achieved PCEs over 14.00% in single-junction binary BHJ solar cells, such as benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),22 pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7(6H)-dione (TzBI),14 fluorinated quinoxaline (FQX),23 thiolactone,24 ester-substituted thiophene,25 tetrazine derivatives,26 and thiazolothiazole (TzTz)27 units. The development of more building blocks for constructing high-performance polymer donors is very important to further improve the PCE in the field of PSCs.
The naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione (NTD) unit is a tremendously promising electron-withdrawing unit in the construction of polymer donors for high-performance PSCs due to its highly similar chemical structure to that of the BDD unit. In the last decade, the PCEs of NTD-based polymers were improved from 5.21% to 13.10% in single-junction NF PSCs, but they are still lower than those of BDD-based congeners.28–34 It should be noted that the benzene in the NTD unit has two more alkylation positions than the thiophene in the BDD unit. Such a different structure provides an extra change to further optimize the aggregation properties of NTD-based polymers in solution by changing the side chain substituted positions from 6,7- to 5,8-sites, which can be expected to further improve the photovoltaic performances. Herein, we designed and synthesized two novel polymer donors (named PBTN-o and PBTN-p, Scheme 1) with identical conjugated backbones and different orientations of two 2-ethylhexyl groups located at the 6,7- and 5,8-sites of the NTD benzene ring. Both polymers have very similar conjugated structures, molecular weights, optical properties, and molecular energy levels, except for the aggregation abilities in chlorobenzene solution. After blending with the electron acceptor BO-4Cl (Fig. 1d), the blend film based on PBTN-o exhibited a much larger aggregation size than the PBTN-p-based blend film, which led to different PCEs of 11.85% and 14.10% for PBTN-o- and PBTN-p-based PSCs, respectively. To reveal the origins of the different photovoltaic performances in both devices, single crystal analysis, density functional theory (DFT) and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) calculations were conducted. These results demonstrate that 5,8-substituted alkyl chains on the NTD unit can induce conjugated core distortion, thus resulting in suitable aggregation in PBTN-p. This facilitates the formation of favourable BHJ morphology and produces a high PCE.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for both polymers are shown in Scheme 1. NTD monomers (4a and 4b) were prepared from starting materials of 1,2-dichlorobenzene or 1,4-dichlorobenzene by four reactions in the sequence of alkylation,35,36 Friedel–Crafts reaction,37 Stille coupling reaction, and bromination. The desired conjugated polymers PBTN-o and PBTN-p were both synthesized by Stille coupling with (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) and the corresponding NTD monomers. A detailed description of the synthetic procedures and characterization of related compounds are provided in the ESI.† The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of both polymers were 18.7 and 15.7 kg mol−1 with corresponding polydispersity indexes (Đ) of 2.1 and 1.7 for PBTN-o and PBTN-p, respectively, measured by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) using o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 145 °C. Their Mns are similar to those of previously reported dialkylthio-substituted NTD-based polymers.33 Both polymers have good solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene. Additionally, the thermal stabilities of both polymers were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. S1† (ESI) manifesting their excellent thermal stabilities with 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) of 447.4 and 430.8 °C for PBTN-o and PBTN-p, respectively.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of both polymers in diluted chlorobenzene solution and film were investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy at room temperature. As displayed in Fig. 1a, the PBTN-o solution presents double peaks at 583 and 626 nm. After the side chains are moved from the 6,7- to 5,8-sites, PBTN-p shows a slight blue-shift of double peaks at 578 and 612 nm. This could be ascribed to the weaker intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) along the conjugated backbone in PBTN-p.38 In films, both polymers show the same absorption peak at 575 nm due to their identical backbone structure. In comparison, PBTN-p has a lower shoulder peak at 612 nm than PBTN-o at 626 nm indicating the 5,8-substituted alkyl chains horizontal to the polymer backbone may cause more disturbance to the planarity of the conjugated backbone. Additionally, both polymers show similar optical bandgaps of 1.83 and 1.84 eV for PBTN-o and PBTN-p, respectively, calculated from the onset of the film absorption. The absorption spectra of the BO-4Cl film and polymer donor:BO-4Cl films are also recorded in Fig. 1. Both polymer donors have very good complementary absorption spectra with BO-4Cl. To further study the aggregation ability of both polymers, we measured their temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra in diluted chlorobenzene solution as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI).† Both polymers exhibit a similar absorption trend where the maximum absorption wavelength gradually red-shifts with increasing absorption intensity with the decrease of solution temperature, suggesting gradually enhanced intermolecular interaction.39 As shown in Fig. 1b, the variation of the aggregation peak intensities at long absorption wavelengths in PBTN-o is smaller than that in PBTN-p, indicating that PBTN-o has a much stronger aggregation ability than PBTN-p in chlorobenzene solution.
To investigate the energy levels of the two polymers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to calculate their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels according to the onset of oxidation potentials (Fig. S3, ESI†). The HOMO levels are estimated to be −5.45 and −5.44 eV for PBTN-o and PBTN-p, respectively. With the known optical bandgaps (Eoptg), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are computed to be −3.62 and −3.60 eV for PBTN-o and PBTN-p, respectively, in accordance with the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg.40 It should be noted that the LUMO levels calculated using this equation will be lower than the actual values for the existence of exciton bonding energy. This result implies that different orientations of alkyl side chains on the same polymer backbone have a very weak impact on molecular energy levels. The energy level alignments of photoactive materials are illustrated in Fig. 1c. The energy offsets (ΔELUMO ∼0.47 eV; ΔEHOMO ∼0.21 eV) between the polymer donor and BO-4Cl are large enough to achieve efficient exciton dissociation indicating both polymer donors match well with BO-4Cl in terms of energy level. In principle, this molecular design provides an ideal model for studying the relationship between the peripheral alkyl side chain orientation, BHJ morphology, and device performance.
Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the influence of the orientation of alkyl side chains on photovoltaic performance, PSCs were fabricated with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:BO-4Cl/PFN-Br/Al. Efforts were dedicated to the optimization of fabrication conditions of the active layer, such as donor:acceptor (D/A) weight ratio (w/w), solvent additive (1,8-diiodoctane, DIO) volume ratio (v/v), and thermal annealing temperature (Table S1–S6, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 2a, while the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The PBTN-o:BO-4Cl-based device yielded a PCE of 11.85%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) = 0.84 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) = 22.41 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) = 0.63. After changing the side chain orientation, the PBTN-p:BO-4Cl-based device produced a remarkably high PCE of 14.10% with the same VOC of 0.84 V and a simultaneously enhanced JSC (24.67 mA cm−2) and FF (0.68). The similar VOC in both the devices is reasonable due to the close HOMO levels of both polymer donors. The significantly different JSCs and FFs in both devices could be attributed to their different BHJ morphologies.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed on the optimized PSCs (Fig. 2b). Although both devices possess almost the same photoresponse region, the PBTN-p-based device exhibits a higher EQE response from 410 to 850 nm with the maximum over 80% than the PBTN-o-based device. The integrated JSC values from the EQE spectra are calculated to be 21.30 mA cm−2 for the PBTN-o-based device and 23.46 mA cm−2 for the PBTN-p-based device, which agree well with the JSC obtained from the J–V measurements.

Charge transport properties and recombination mechanisms
With the aim of understanding the effect of the alkyl side chain orientation in conjugated backbones on exciton dissociation and charge carrier mobility in blends, the measurements of exciton dissociation probability (Fig. 3a) and photo-induced charger-carrier extraction by the linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) transient method (Fig. 3b) were carried out.41 The exciton dissociation probability is defined as Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, where Jph and Jsat are the photo-generated current density and saturation photocurrent density, respectively. The effective voltage (Veff) stands for the difference between the compensation voltage and the applied voltage. Under short-circuit conditions, when Jsat was obtained from Veff at 7 V, the Pdiss was computed to be 90.91% for the PBTN-o-based device and 94.09% for the PBTN-p-based device, indicating that more photo-generated excitons were dissociated into free charges and collected by electrodes in the PBTN-p-based device. This might partially explain the higher Jsc in the PBTN-p-based device than in the PBTN-o-based device.42 In photo-CELIV characterization, the PBTN-p-based device shows a higher charge carrier mobility of 1.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than the PBTN-o-based one (1.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).43 The high charge carrier mobility of the device is beneficial for obtaining a high JSC and FF in PSCs.

The light intensity (Plight) dependence of VOC and JSC in both devices was also measured to understand charge recombination.44,45 In Fig. S4a (ESI),† the curves of Plightversus VOC have slopes of 1.28 kT q−1 for the PBTN-o-based device and 1.07 kT q−1 for the PBTN-p-based device, indicating less trap recombination in the latter PSCs. The relationship of the curves of Plightversus JSC can be described by the formula of JSC ∝ (Plight)S, where the exponential factor S indicates the extent of the non-geminate recombination at short-circuit. Fig. S4b (ESI†) shows an S of 0.97 for the PBTN-o-based device and 0.98 for the PBTN-p-based device, indicating weak non-geminate molecular recombination in both PSCs. The low trap recombination in the PBTN-p-based device is prone to producing high JSC and FF. Considering that the aggregation ability of the polymer plays a key role in BHJ morphology, compared to the strong aggregation of PBTN-o, the relatively weak aggregation of PBTN-p could form a more favourable BHJ morphology for sufficient exciton dissociation and fast charge transfer, which account for the higher JSC and FF.46–48
BHJ morphologies
To further understand the different JSC and FF for both the devices, the surface morphologies of the pure polymer and blended films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. 4. All films were fabricated according to their optimal device conditions. Root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) values were measured to be 1.79 and 2.15 nm for the PBTN-o and PBTN-p films, respectively, calculated from their topography images. After blending with BO-4Cl, the Rq of the PBTN-o:BO-4Cl film was sharply increased to 14.3 nm, implying that this film shows strong aggregation characteristics. This is detrimental for exciton dissociation and charge transfer. In contrast, the PBTN-p:BO-4Cl film shows a slight increase of Rq (3.50 nm) and a favourable BHJ morphology. This is the main reason why the PBTN-o-based device outputs low JSC and FF. In other words, such distinguishable morphologies could originate from the different intermolecular interactions between polymer donors and the NF acceptor due to the subtle difference in the molecular structure between PBTN-o and PBTN-p. Therefore, it is essential to study polymer geometries and self-organization in films.

Crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations
To investigate the polymer geometries, we first studied the single crystals of the different segments in both polymers. The single crystal structures of molecules are of vital importance to understand their electronic properties. Single crystals of 3a and 3b were obtained by slow evaporation from a dilute methanol/toluene solution at room temperature. Fig. 5a and b show their single-crystal structures, and the corresponding data are shown in Table S7 (ESI).† Molecule 3a shows a planar NTD core, and the corresponding torsion angles between the NTD core and neighbouring thiophenes are 16.51° and 2.15°. However, molecule 3b gives a surprising bent NTD core with a dihedral angle of 33.86° between the thiophene and benzene rings and prefers to form a dimer feature as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI).† Meanwhile, the corresponding torsion angles between the NTD core and neighbouring thiophenes increase to 20.59° and 24.41°. Additionally, both small molecules show different molecular arrangements (Fig. S6, ESI†). Such differences should be attributed to orientations of alkyl chains on NTD. In other words, the introduction of alkyl chains at the 5,8-sites on NTD induces conjugated core bending, skeleton twisting and molecular pattern difference. Therefore, when both monomers are used to construct conjugated polymers, it can be expected that the monomer 4b-based polymer has a more twisted conjugated backbone than the 4a-based polymer.

Although both polymers differ only in NTD monomers, the single-crystal structures of NTD monomers are not fully sufficient to estimate polymer geometries due to the redistribution of the electron density in the conjugate backbone with the extension of conjugation. Therefore, the geometries of PBTN-o and PBTN-p were further studied via DFT calculations on two representative trimers (Fig. 5c–d and S7, ESI†). The long alkyl chains were simplified as methyl groups to shorten the calculation time. The trimers of both polymers show a similar electron distribution on the HOMO and LUMO. Meanwhile, their HOMO/LUMO levels are calculated to be −4.97/−2.71 and −4.98/−2.67 eV for PBTN-o and PBTN-p, respectively, which is consistent with CV measurement. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the trimer for PBTN-o exhibits relatively small dihedral angles of −13.97° and 10.90° between the NTD core and adjacent thiophenes. In contrast, the trimer for PBTN-p has large dihedral angles of 26.02° and −24.40° between the NTD core and adjacent thiophenes. These results are well consistent with the values obtained from single-crystal analysis. Additionally, the side views of both trimers show that the trimer of PBTN-o has a more planar conjugated backbone than that of PBTN-p. Overall, the single crystals of both monomers and DFT calculations confirm that PBTN-p has a more twisted conjugated backbone than PBTN-o. Compared to the relatively planar skeleton of PBTN-o, the twisted skeleton of PBTN-p endows it with appropriate aggregation and intermolecular interaction with the NFA BO-4Cl to form a better nanoscale phase separation in the photoactive layer, which finally benefits its JSC and FF in PSCs.
BHJ organization
To deeply understand the molecular structure information of both pure polymers and their blend films, we employed GIWAXS measurements to determine the corresponding organizations. As shown in Fig. 6, the PBTN-o film shows two (100) and (300) peaks at 0.27 and 0.81 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction with lamellar distances of 23.26 and 7.75 Å, while the PBTN-p film only displays a (100) peak at 0.29 Å−1 with a lamellar distance of 21.66 Å in the IP direction. This implies that PBTN-o has a higher ordering arrangement than PBTN-p in film. Another significant difference in both polymer films is that the PBTN-o film shows a strong (010) peak at qz = 1.76 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction with a π–π stacking distance of 3.57 Å, while the PBTN-p film displays a slightly weak (010) peak at qz = 1.68 Å−1 in the IP direction with a π–π stacking distance of 3.74 Å. This indicates that the PBTN-o film has a face on orientation while the PBTN-p film has an edge-on orientation. The higher ordering arrangement and stronger π–π stacking in the PBTN-o film should be attributed to its more planar conjugated backbone than that of PBTN-p as confirmed by the single-crystal structures of 3a and 3b, as well as DFT calculations. This result implies that the side chain positions on the NTD unit in both polymers have a significant influence on molecular π stacking and orientation in films. After blending with the acceptor of BO-4Cl, the PBTN-o:BO-4Cl film shows a more highly ordered arrangement than the PBTN-p:BO-4Cl film due to the similar peaks to those of the pure films of polymer donors in the IP direction. Additionally, the PBTN-o:BO-4Cl film shows a similar (010) peak at 1.72 Å−1 with a π–π stacking distance of 3.65 Å for face-on orientation. More interestingly, the PBTN-p:BO-4Cl film shows a changed orientation from edge-on to face-on with a π–π stacking distance of 3.65 Å in comparison to the film of PBTN-p. The same π stacking distance in both blend films implies that they have similar charge transporting ability. The more orderly arrangement of the PBNT-o:BO-4Cl film could result in a large aggregation size in the BHJ film as shown in the AFM image. Therefore, when side chains are moved from the 6,7- to 5,8-positions, PBTN-p and its blend film show decreased aggregation behaviours due to the increased twisting of the conjugated backbone, which optimized the BHJ morphology and achieved a higher PCE in PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, a couple of polymer donors with different orientations of branched alkyl side chains on the NTD unit were carefully synthesized and investigated to clarify the impact of alkyl chain orientation on photovoltaic performance. The single-crystal structures of both NTD units demonstrate that the 6,7-substituted NTD has a planar core and small torsion angles with the flanking thiophenes. Surprisingly, the 5,8-substituted NTD has a bent core and large torsion angles with the flanking thiophenes. The corresponding polymer PBTN-o is confirmed to have a more planar conjugated backbone than PBTN-p by DFT calculations. The highly planar skeleton of PBTN-o allowed it to form a highly ordered arrangement in the active layer, which led to large aggregation sizes in the BHJ morphology as observed by GIWAXS and AFM. However, the twisted conjugated backbone endows PBTN-p with a suitable aggregation behaviour for obtaining favourable BHJ morphology in the blend film. In PSCs, therefore, the PBTN-p:BO-4Cl-based device outputs an outstanding PCE of 14.10% which is in contrast to a PCE of only 11.85% from the PBTN-o:BO-4Cl-based device. This work provides a new insight into optimizing the BHJ morphology via alkyl chain induced skeleton bending and conjugated backbone twisting, thereby improving the photovoltaic performance.
