    , Accepted 5th July 2013First published on 5th July 2013AbstractAn easy-accessible amine group functionalized fullerene derivative, DMAPA-C60, is explored as a cathode buffer layer (CBL) in polymer solar cells (PSCs) for our presently tested three different material systems, namely P3HT:PCBM, PBDTTT-C:PC70BM and PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM. The power conversion efficiencies of the three systems with DMAPA-C60 as the CBL reach 3.88%, 6.29% and 7.42%, respectively, which are much higher than those of the corresponding PSCs with the Al-only cathode and even slightly higher than those of the corresponding Ca/Al devices of these systems. The DMAPA-C60 CBL also allows high work function metals (Ag, Cu, and Au) as cathodes.
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) are regarded as one of the most advanced photovoltaic technologies due to their low-cost fabrication and high mechanical flexibility.1 Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been greatly improved in recent years, and is now approaching the milestone value of 10%,2 although such a performance is still far behind that of inorganic ones.3 The standard device geometry of PSCs normally comprises a bottom indium tin oxide (ITO) anode, an anode interfacial layer (mostly PEDOT/PSS), a photoactive layer, a low work function cathode buffer layer (normally Ca), and top metal cathode Al. The use of a low work function metal buffer layer such as Ca can dramatically improve the performance of PSCs due to the enhancement of the internal electric field, the reduced carrier defects and traps at the active layer/Al interface (induced by Al atoms seeped into the active layer). However, such metal buffer layers are very active due to their low work functions, which will lead to poor device stability,3 and meanwhile these metals need thermal evaporation, which is unfavorable for low-cost fabrication. This problem can be solved by putting an interlayer between the photoactive layer and the cathode.4 Thereby researchers are extensively working on finding solution-processable inorganic5 and organic6 materials to replace such low work function metals as cathode buffer layers. Different to inorganic cathode buffer layers (CBLs), the organic CBL has an additional important virtue of structural tenability, which could offer great opportunities of realizing fully solution processed PSCs.7
Stimulated by this motivation, various types of organic CBLs have been explored. For example, conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPs) tethered with different polar groups of N,N-dimethylamino (such as PFN2a), ammonium salt (such as WPF-oxy,8 PF2/6-b-P3TMAHT9), phosphonate (such as PC-P10) and metal ion-intercalated crown ether11 (FCn6:K+) have already been successfully designed and utilized as CBLs, and they have been proved to be comparable to or even better than the conventional Ca buffer layer. It is believed that the function of these CPs lies in the formation of an interfacial dipole (with the positively charged end pointing toward high work function cathodes), which provides an ohmic contact between the cathode and the active layer as a result (of course the prevention of Al atoms diffusing into the active layer by the CPs is also a crucial reason). Among the organic CBLs, fullerene-based materials are theoretically the most ideal candidates. This is because of their unique virtues of being structurally similar to the conventionally used fullerene acceptors, which could smoothly bridge electrons transporting from the fullerene acceptor to the cathode.12–15
In light of these developments, here we report an amine group functionalized fullerene complex (DMAPA-C60, synthetic route is shown in Fig. 1b) as the CBL. Compared to the previously reported fullerene-buffer layer, its synthesis is much easier: only a simple one-pot N–H addition reaction is needed.16 Also, its terminal amino group could potentially provide a dipole moment just as the amino group does in PFN (polyfluorene grafted with amino groups)2a and PEI (polyethylenimine).6b It is well accepted that because of the high reaction activity of this N–H addition, the final products are usually multi-addition components of mixtures. And these mixtures are difficult to separate by commonly used column chromatography due to the nearly identical polarity of the components. Detailed characterizations, including 1H NMR, 13H NMR and FT-IR, can be found in the ESI.† From elemental analysis, the average addition number is estimated to be 4. Here, the components of a mixture were directly used for device fabrication and an interestingly excellent device performance was obtained. Based on the onset reduction potential (−0.80 V, Fig. S1a†), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level was estimated to be −3.58 eV, which is very close to those of PCBM and PC70BM (about −3.85 eV). The up-shifted LUMO energy level is brought by the multi-addition effect of electron-donating substituents. From the onset oxidation potential (1.14 eV, Fig. S1b†), the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital energy level) was estimated to be −5.52 eV, which is sufficiently low to efficiently block holes from various donors (e.g. P3HT, whose HOMO is −4.9 eV).

The CBL function of DMAPA-C60 was firstly evaluated in a P3HT:PCBM based device. The device structure (Fig. 1a) is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/DMAPA-C60/Al. The DMAPA-C60 CBL is spin-coated from a methanol solvent. The buffer layer thickness is optimized by adjusting the concentration of DMAPA-C60 solution (from 0.5 mg mL−1 to 2 mg mL−1) with the spin-coating speed fixed at 3000 rpm. The optimal concentration of DMAPA-C60 solution is found to be 1 mg mL−1, which offers the best device performance. Thinner and thicker films (corresponds to lower or higher solution concentration) will degrade the device performance. In the following, we will use four representative devices with different DMAPA-C60 thicknesses to study the effect of the buffer layer thickness on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. The four thicknesses correspond to four concentrations: 0.5 mg mL−1, 1 mg mL−1, 1.5 mg mL−1, and 2 mg mL−1. It is very difficult to test the accurate thickness of DMAPA-C60 on the active blend film, thereby we spin-coated DMAPA-C60 solutions with the above four concentrations on oxygen plasma treated quartz glass at 3000 rpm, and measured their thicknesses. The four thicknesses are 4 nm (0.5 mg mL−1), 9 nm (1 mg mL−1), 13 nm (1.5 mg mL−1) and 18 nm (2 mg mL−1).
The surface morphology and wettability were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements respectively (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a shows the surface of the P3HT:PCBM film without any DMAPA-C60. There are some visible pinholes on the DMAPA-C60 deposited P3HT:PCBM surface (Fig. 2b) at low concentration (0.5 mg mL−1), and the surface is obviously different from that of P3HT:PCBM shown in Fig. 2a. Such pinholes in Fig. 2b cannot be seen for higher concentration samples in Fig. 2c (1 mg mL−1), indicating the formation of a complete continuous DMAPA-C60 buffer layer. The surfaces of higher concentration samples (1.5 mg mL−1 and 2 mg mL−1) are the same as those shown in Fig. 2c. As shown in Fig. 2d, the P3HT:PCBM surface was very hydrophobic with a contact angle of 108°. In contrast, the surface immediately becomes very hydrophilic after DMAPA-C60 solution treatment (Fig. 2e and f), with a contact angle of 35° for the 0.5 mg mL−1 sample and 28° for the 1 mg mL−1 sample. The less hydrophilic property of the 0.5 mg mL−1 sample should originate from its incomplete coverage of DMAPA-C60 on the P3HT:PCBM surface. Samples with higher concentration (1.5 mg mL−1 and 2 mg mL−1) exhibit contact angles of ∼28°, the same with that of the 1 mg mL−1 sample. The hydrophilic nature of the surface and the morphology evolution should be proofs of the existence of a dipole layer on the surface.

Fig. 3 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs (under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. In order to further investigate the effect of the DMAPA-C60 surface on the device performance, we extracted various device parameters from the J–V curves based on the solar cell equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 3b, consisting of a single diode, series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RP)17). RS and RP as a function of film thickness are provided in Fig. 3b. It is seen that the 0.5 mg mL−1 sample bears a slightly larger RS value (3.92 Ω cm2) than that of the 1 mg mL−1 sample (3.25 Ω cm2); this should be induced by the discontinuous DMAPA-C60 CBL (Fig. 2b), which not only results in poor electrical contact but also allows Al atom diffusion into the P3HT:PCBM film. The two effects can significantly enhance carrier trapping and recombination inside the device, which in turn reduces RP. This is consistent with the fact that the RP value (2.01 KΩ cm2) of the 0.5 mg mL−1 sample is smaller than that of the 1 mg mL−1 (2.08 Ω cm2) sample (seen in Table 1 and Fig. 2b). The 1 mg mL−1 sample (Fig. 2f) exhibits the smallest RS (3.25 Ω cm2) and largest RP (2.08 KΩ cm2) among all the samples, and hence the best overall diode characteristics,18 which is also reflected by its lowest ideality factor n and its lowest dark saturation current density Jo (Table 1). For the 1.5 mg mL−1 sample, where the DMAPA-C60 buffer layer becomes thicker, a drastic rise in RS is observed in comparison with that of the 1 mg mL−1 sample as well as n and Jo, and meanwhile, RP slightly decreases. For the 2 mg mL−1 sample which has the thickest DMAPA-C60 buffer layer among the four samples, RP further decreases, however, RS further increases as well as n and Jo, all of which collectively leading to a lower PCE. We believe that once a continuous DMAPA-C60 buffer layer is formed, further increasing its thickness only hinders electron transfer from PCBM to the cathode via this buffer layer. As we know, for a solar cell device with given active materials, lower n, lower Jo, smaller RS and larger RP mean better device quality and hence better device performance. The four parameters in the four samples exactly follow this rule: a higher PCE always corresponds to lower n, lower Jo, smaller RS and larger RP, this can be clearly seen from Fig. 3b. The highest PCE we obtained is 3.88% (the 1 mg mL−1 sample), which is two times higher than that (1.89%) of the Al-only device (device with the Al cathode without any buffer layer). Notably, this value is even slightly higher than the value (3.80%) of the standard device with the Ca/Al cathode (seen in Fig. 3c and Table 1).

Compared to the Al-only device (Fig. 3c and Table 1), the remarkable improvement in PCE is a result of a simultaneous increase of Jsc (from 8.38 mA cm−2 to 9.14 mA cm−2), FF (from 51.83% to 67.78%) and most notably Voc (from 0.435 V to 0.626 V). The device parameters (RS, RP, n and Jo) are all superior to those of the Al-only device. Notably, Jo and n of the 1 mg mL−1 sample are even lower than those of the Ca/Al device (device with Ca as the buffer layer), which is fundamentally associated with weaker recombination inside the device. This could be benefited from the enhanced hole-blocking effect of the DMAPA-C60 CBL brought by its deep HOMO energy level (−5.4 eV), which is about 0.5 eV lower than that of P3HT (−4.9 eV). The proposed hole blocking effect is consistent with our hole-only J–E (current density-electric field) measurements for the device without and with DMAPA-C60 by using MoO3/Al as the buffer layer/cathode (Fig. S3†), where the current density of the J–E curve of the device with DMAPA-C60 is significantly suppressed (e.g. by a factor of one order at E = 2.0 × 105 V cm−1) in comparison with that of the device without the DMAPA-C60 CBL.
To probe the role of this DMAPA-C60 CBL, metals with high work function (φ), namely Au (φ = 5.2 eV), Cu (φ = 4.6 eV) and Ag (φ = 4.4 eV), were used to replace Al as the top cathode electrode. The J–V curves of these devices are shown in Fig. 3d. All the devices with the DMAPA-C60 CBL demonstrate good photovoltaic properties with PCE values over 3.0% (Table S1†). Despite the large difference in work function, Voc values of Au (0.609 V), Cu (0.621 V) and Ag (0.610 V) based devices are actually very close. These values are also very close to those of the Ca/Al device (0.626 V). We also attempt to use PEI as a CBL to replace Ca to clarify the function of DMAPA-C60 in the P3HT:PCBM system. However, PEI cannot be coated onto the highly hydrophobic P3HT:PCBM surface from its methanol solution. The result suggested that the chemical similarity of the fullerene functionality in DMAPA-C60 and PCBM can improve the miscibility between them, thereby potentially facilitating the deposition of DMAPA-C60 on a wide range of active layers. Using this DMAPA-C60 CBL, the negligible dependence of Voc on the cathode metal work function is also observed in PBDTTT-C:PC70BM (ref. 19) (structure is also shown in Fig. 1) based devices (PCE, FF, Jsc and Voc of these devices are given in Table 2). The Ca/Al device (PCE of 6.17%) showed a 0.115 V increment in Voc over that of the Al-only device (0.721 V for Ca/Al and 0.606 V for Al), whereas a slightly larger Voc increment (0.117 V) was observed for the DMAPA-C60/Al device (with a PCE of 6.29% and Voc of 0.723 V) relative to the Al-only device; as shown in Table 2, Voc values for the DMAPA-C60/Ag device and the DMAPA-C60/Au device are 0.730 V (PCE of 6.20%) and 0.723 V (PCE of 4.72%), respectively, all of which are very close to that of the standard Ca/Al based device. Here, it is worth noting that the PCE of the DMAPA-C60/Al device (6.29%) is slightly higher than that of the Ca/Al device (6.17%). The negligible dependence of Voc on the cathode work function together with the chemistry similarity of the terminal amino group with that of PFN and PEI suggest that the DMAPA-C60 buffer layer could provide an interface dipole between the active layer and the cathode metal.

We also tested DMAPA-C60 as a CBL for the PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM system (the structure of PBDTTT-C-T is shown in Fig. 1).20Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of the investigated devices: the Al-only device, the Ca/Al device and the DMAPA-C60/Al device. Their various device parameters are listed in Table 3. The Al-only device exhibits poor device performance with a PCE of only 4.1%. The DMAPA-C60/Al device performs much better with a PCE of 7.42%. Such a significant improvement in the PCE is induced by the simultaneous increase of Jsc (from 12.41 mA cm−2 to 14.89 mA cm−2), Voc (0.621 V to 0.792 V), and FF (53.64% to 62.93%). Notably, the DMAPA-C60/Al device also performs better than the Ca/Al device. The Ca/Al device has a PCE of 7.28%, a Voc of 0.787 V, a Jsc of 14.83 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62.36%; all these parameters are slightly lower than those of the DMAPA-C60/Al device. The improvements in these device parameters are consistent with the results demonstrated by Wu et al. using PFN as the interlayer in low bandgap polymers.2a,b The incident-photon-to-converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the three devices are shown in Fig. 4b; it is seen that the DMAPA-C60/Al device shows the highest IPCE values, which is consistent with its highest Jsc (shown in Fig. 4a and Table 3).

In conclusion, an easy-accessible amine group functionalized fullerene derivative, DMAPA-C60, is developed as a CBL in PSCs. It is proved to be an prominent CBL material for our presently tested three different material systems, namely P3HT:PCBM, PBDTTT-C:PC70BM and PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM. The PCEs of the three systems with DMAPA-C60 as the CBL reach 3.88%, 6.29%, 7.42%, respectively, which are much higher than those of the corresponding Al-only devices and even slighter higher than those of the corresponding Ca/Al devices of these systems. The DMAPA-C60 CBL also allows high work function metals to act as the cathode, which could provide convenience and versatility for cathode selection in device fabrication. The success of DMAPA-C60 as a CBL layer indicates that the amine groups functionalized fullerene derivatives could be very promising in replacing the conventional Ca buffer layer for low-cost high-performance PSCs.
Experimental
Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
PCBM and P3HT were purchased from Nano-C and Rieke Metals, respectively. The PSCs were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/cathode. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) was deposited through spin-coating on pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron P VP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 2000 rpm and dried subsequently at 110 °C for 10 min in air, then the device was transferred to a nitrogen glove box, where the active blend layer of the polymer and fullerene derivative was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. For P3HT:PCBM PSCs, the active layer was formed by spin-coating from o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solution consisting of 15 mg mL−1 P3HT and 12 mg mL−1 PCBM at 500 rpm for 18 s, followed by solvent annealing at room temperature for 2 h, and thermally annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. For PBDTTT-C-T:PC70BM PSCs, the active layer was formed by spin-coating from ODCB solution containing 10 mg mL−1 PBDTTT-C-T and 15 mg mL−1 PC71BM. 1,8-Diiodooctane with a 3% volume ratio was added to the ODCB solutions and stirred before use. Then methanol solution of DMAPA-C60 at varied concentrations was then deposited atop the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, top electrodes were deposited in a vacuum onto the active layer at a pressure of ca. 5.0 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of the device was 4.4 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source-Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled to AM1.5 solar spectrum filter was used as the light source, and the optical power was 100 mW cm−2.
