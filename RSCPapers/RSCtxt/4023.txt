    AbstractThe random distribution of segments of linear octyloxy side chains and of branched 2-ethylhexyloxy side chains, on the backbone of anthracene containing poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(p-phenylene-vinylene) (PPE-PPV) has resulted in a side chain based statistical copolymer, denoted AnE-PVstat, showing optimized features as compared to the well defined homologues whose constitutional units are incorporated into its backbone. Electric field independent charge carrier mobility (µhole) for AnE-PVstat was demonstrated by CELIV and OFET measurements, both methods resulting in similar µhole values of up to 5.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Upon comparison, our results show that charge carrier mobility as measured by CELIV technique is predominantly an intrachain process and less an interchain one, which is in line with past photoconductivity results from PPE-PPV based materials. The present side chain distribution favors efficient solar cell active layer phase separation. As a result, a smaller amount of PC60BM is needed to achieve relatively high energy conversion efficiencies above 3%. The efficiency of ηAM1.5 ≈ 3.8% obtained for AnE-PVstat:PC60BM blend is presently the state-of-art value for PPV-based materials.
Introduction
Conjugated compounds have proven their potential for the design of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices as low cost energy sources.1–5 Intensive interdisciplinary research in this area is presently going on worldwide and results in a rapid enhancement of the state-of-art power conversion efficiency, ηAM1.5. Certified ηAM1.5 values above 6% have been reported for polymer based OPVs.6,7 First products based on OPV are now marketed.8 The bulk heterojunction concept consisting of an intermixing of the donor and acceptor components in the active layer has proven to be the most efficient way to design high performance devices. The way both components intermix is crucial for the overall performance of the solar cells. There are different approaches followed on how to favorably tune the nanoscale morphology of the donor and acceptor blend.9,10
We have recently shown that the hydrophobic nature of solubilizing alkoxy side chains can be utilized to tune the active layer blend morphology of PPE-PPV:fullerene bulk heterojunctions by variation of the side chain volume fraction.11 We furthermore demonstrated that linear and branched alkoxy side groups and combinations thereof can be used to tune the backbone π–π-stacking distance, dπ–π, and the interlayer separation, dinter of anthracene-containing PPE-PPVs.12,13 For instance all octyloxy substitution as in AnE-PVaa (for chemical structures see Chart 1) results in an insoluble polymer that exhibits a well organized layered structure.13 Exchanging the linear octyloxy side chains in part by branched 2-ethylhexyloxy side chains at the phenylene-vinylene segment as in AnE-PVab yields a soluble but less organized polymer with improved solar cell performance in terms of power conversion efficiency (η ≈ 2.4%) from a AnE-PVab:PCBM (1:1) blend, compared to its all-linear substituted but higher side chain volume fraction counterpart AnE-PVad (η ≈ 1.5%).12 The grafting of predominantly bulky branched 2-ethylhexyloxy as in AnE-PVba and -bb leads to amorphous materials, whose 1:1 polymer:PCBM blend exhibit even lower photovoltaic performance (η ≈ 0.3–0.5%).
 Chart 1  Chemical structures of already reported polymers AnE-PV.12b The constitutional units of AnE-PVaa, -ab, -ba and -bb are incorporated in AnE-PVstat. 
In order to obtain a balanced material with optimized parameters, i.e. high solubility, similar side chain density as in AnE-PVaa, -ab, -ba and -bb, and well organized supramolecular arrangement, a side chain based statistical copolymer, AnE-PVstat, has been synthesized. This polymer comprises segments of linear octyloxy and segments of branched 2-ethylhexyloxy side chains that are evenly distributed along the conjugated backbone in a random manner. As such it combines the building units of its all linear (AnE-PVaa), linear as well as branched (AnE-PVab and -ba), and all branched (AnE-PVbb) constitutionally well defined counterparts.
To the best of our knowledge, a solely alkoxy side chain based statistical conjugated copolymer, purposely designed for solar cell active layer morphology control is not known. Alkoxy side chain based statistical conjugated copolymers have been designed for sensory14 and for OFET (organic field effect) applications.15 All conjugated diblock copolymers poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene)s (P(3HT)-b-P(3EHT)) making use of two different alkyl side chains were recently synthesized by Hashimoto et al. for optoelectronic applications.16
In this article, we describe the properties (photophysical, charge carrier mobility and photovoltaic) of AnE-PVstat and compare them with those of the well defined homologues AnE-PVaa, -ab, -ba and -bb. Charge carrier mobility was measured based on both CELIV (Charge Extraction by Linearly Increasing Voltage) and OFET (Organic Field Effect Transistor) techniques.
Results and discussion
(A) Synthesis and general characterization

Synthesis and structural characterization. 
The side chain based statistical copolymer AnE-PVstat was obtained in 89% yield after reacting equimolar ratios of two dialdehydes 1a (C8H17 = octyl) and 1b (C8H17 = 2-ethylhexyl) with two bisphosphonate esters 2a (C8H17 = octyl) and 2b (C8H17 = 2-ethylhexyl) as illustrated in Scheme 1. The chemical structure was elucidated by NMR, IR and elemental analysis. GPC (gel permeation chromatography) measurements revealed a number-average-molecular-weight of Mn = 28000 g mol−1 with a PDI (polydispersity index) of 2.0 and a Pn (degree of polymerization) of 22. AnE-PVstat incorporates the repeating units of polymers AnE-PVaa, -ab, -ba and -bb, whose chemical structures are shown in Chart 1. Their properties determined from GPC, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and WAXS (wide angle X-ray scattering) together with those of AnE-PVstat are summarized in Table 1 for comparison purposes.12,13

As expected, there is an increase of the π–π-stacking distance going from the solely linear octyloxy-substituted AnE-PVaa (0.380 nm) through AnE-PVab (0.386 nm) having four-fold linear octyloxy and two-fold branched 2-ethylhexyloxy substitutions, to AnE-PVstat (0.393 nm).13AnE-PVstat exhibits, however, slightly higher degree of order in its self-assembly state than AnE-PVaa, although its backbone incorporates segments decorated with branched side chains.13 A similar observation was made with P(3HT)-b-P(3EHT), which was evidenced by higher structuring of its thin film absorption spectrum as compared to pure P3HT.16
The values displayed in Table 1 allow a comparison of the properties (photophysical, charge carrier mobility and photovoltaic) of AnE-PVstat with those of AnE-PVab, -ba and -bb because other influential parameters such as side chain volume fraction, molecular-weight distribution, solubility and purity of the various polymers are either the same or do not differ very much.

Fig. 1 depicts the absorption, excitation and emission spectra in dilute chlorobenzene solution of AnE-PVab, -ba, -bb and -stat. Thin film absorption spectra of the four polymers are displayed in Fig. 2 (left) while both thin film absorption and emission spectra of AnE-PVstat are depicted in Fig. 2 (right).

 Fig. 2  (Left) Normalized thin film absorption spectra of AnE-PVab, -ba, -bb and -stat (thin film spin-cast from CHCl3 solution). (Right) Normalized thin film absorption and emission spectra of AnE-PVstat (thin film spin-cast from chlorobenzene solution). The data from chlorobenzene solution for AnE-PVab, -ba and -bb have been reported in ref. 12b. 
Small deviations between the absorption and the excitation spectra in solution were observed. This gives an indication of small amounts of non-fluorescent species. However, the identical emission and excitation spectra measured at different excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively, are a strong evidence of only one emitting species in the polymers.
Already in solution, there are differences in the absorption band shapes between the amorphous polymers AnE-PVba, -bb and the polymers showing stacking behavior AnE-PVab and -stat. While the first group is characterized by a structureless main absorption band peaked at 510 nm and 522 nm, respectively, the second group exhibits red-shifted main absorption bands, which consist of a peak around 555 nm and a higher energy shoulder around 520 nm. This difference becomes even clearer in thin film, whereby AnE-PVab12b and AnE-PVstat exhibit two well defined peaks around 510 nm and 580 nm due to stacking (layered structures), while AnE-PVab and -bb12b remain structureless. The slightly higher solution fluorescence quantum yields for both AnE-PVab (57%) and AnE-PVstat (52%) and lower Stokes shifts, Δνaf, as compared to the amorphous polymers suggest a more planarized ground state. Moreover, AnE-PVstat shows the smallest Stokes shift both in solution and in thin film, which is an indication of comparatively less conformational changes from the ground to the first excited state, confirming its relatively conformationally stable nature.
All four polymers show identical solution fluorescence spectra peaked around 583 nm. From fluorescence kinetics measurements, a fluorescence lifetime τ = 0.87 ns was obtained for AnE-PVstat, which led to a fluorescence rate constant, kf, of 0.60 ns−1 and a radiationless deactivation constant, knr, of 0.55 ns−1. These values are similar to those of its well-defined homologues AnE-PVab, -ba and -bb. In contrast, the thin film emission spectra of both AnE-PVab12 and -stat are red-shifted and demonstrate more pronounced features due to aggregates as compared to the amorphous counterparts12b (Table 2 and Fig. 2, right). However, higher absolute fluorescence quantum yields were obtained for the amorphous materials due to less quenching channels as a result of fewer aggregations.12b
Electrochemical studies were carried out under identical experimental conditions as described in ref. 12b and 17. Representative cyclovoltammograms for scan rates of 20 and 50 m V−1 s−1 are displayed in Fig. S1†. HOMO and LUMO levels of 5.09 eV and 3.04 eV, respectively, were obtained for AnE-PVstat. This results in an electrochemical band gap of Egelc = 2.05 eV which is in a good agreement with the optical band gap, Egopt, of 2.10 eV and 1.90 eV evaluated from the absorption edge of the solution and thin film spectra, respectively.17

(B) Charge transport studies
Charge transport studies were carried out using both CELIV and OFET techniques.
CELIV allows a direct measurement of the dispersive (time-dependent) charge carrier transport and recombination in films with energetical and structural disorder,18–22 where time-resolved techniques like Time-of-Flight are not applicable.23–25
Dark CELIV current transient responses for different applied rising voltage pulses in AnE-PVstat polymer are shown in Fig. 3 (left). The studied films contain non-negligible thermally generated charge carrier concentration, therefore carrier photogeneration using a laser was not necessary.26 A typical shift of an extraction maximum towards shorter times is seen when the applied voltage is increased. This demonstrates faster carrier extraction at higher applied electric fields, which allows drift velocity and mobility to be estimated as a function of applied electric field. Using equations derived elsewhere18 and extraction maximum for each current transient shown in Fig. 3 (left), the equilibrium carrier mobility at different applied electric fields is calculated and plotted in Fig. 3 (right).27 Film conductivity σ = 2.6 × 10−8 S cm−1 and mobile carrier concentration n = 4 × 1014 cm−3 due to the unintentional doping were directly estimated from the current extraction transients using equations derived elsewhere.18 It was found that the conductivity was almost independent of the applied voltage in the measurement range.

Left-shift of extraction maxima at higher applied voltages indicates faster carrier extraction time from which carrier mobility is calculated. (Right) The electric field independent charge carrier mobility at equilibrium in AnE-PVstat. The closed squares represent carrier mobility from CELIV, whereas open circles show carrier mobility measured from OFET (see OFET section). 

AnE-PVstat OFETs were fabricated and electrically characterized. The field effect mobility was calculated in the saturation and linear regimes.28–30 As observed in the output curve of an AnE-PVstat OFET presented in Fig. 4, the dependence of IdsversusVgs is characterized by a pinch off point afterwards Ids saturates for values of Vds ≥ Vgs − Vth, (Vth is the threshold voltage). The conductivity of the semiconductor AnE-PVstat was estimated to be 1 × 10−8 S cm−1. It was calculated from the slope of the Ids curve evaluated at Vds ≅ 0 V and Vgs = 0 V. The charge carrier density, n, in the OFET channel was estimated assuming 3 nm as the thickness of the layer within the semiconductor containing the electrical charges.31 Hence, for Vgs = −100 V and Vth = −20 V a hole density equal to nh ≈ 2 × 1018 cm−3 was found. The field effect mobility in the linear regime was calculated from the slope, at very small Vds, of the output curve corresponding to Vgs = −100 V of Fig. 5.32,33 Hence, a constant field effect mobility of 4.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for Vds equal to −2 and −4 V, respectively, which is similar to the ones obtained by the CELIV technique.

(Right) Left axis: transfer curve of an AnE-PVstat OFET, for a fixed Vds = −100 V. Right axis: square root of Ids (dotted line), mean value of the square root of Ids (dashed line), and the linear fit to the mean value of the square root of Ids (straight full line). 
 Fig. 5  Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the best solar cell from 1:2 ratio AnE-PVstat:PCBM blend measured before and after annealing at 110 °C for 5 minutes. 
The calculation of the mobility in the saturation regime was done following the method of fitting the square root of Ids as a function of Vgs to a straight line.28,29,31,34 In the present case (see Fig. 4), due to the presence of a small hysteresis, it was preferred to work with the curve of the mean value of the square root of Ids (dashed line) and to realize a linear fit to it (straight full line). The extracted charge carrier mobility and threshold voltage are equal to 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and −20 V, respectively. In addition, the device shows an on/off current ratio of ∼50. This value was calculated from the transfer curve as the ratio of Ids at Vgs = −100 V and Ids at Vth.
When evaluating carrier mobility values obtained from different methods, it is important to compare the electric field and carrier concentration at which the mobility has been measured. Therefore, the obtained values of the field effect mobilities are plotted, open circles, as a function of square root of the electric field in Fig. 3 (right). The values of the mobility shown in the range of the electric field from 15 to 25 (V/cm)1/2 correspond to those calculated in the linear regime, low Vds voltages. On the other hand, the point located around 110 (V/cm)1/2 was calculated in the saturation regime, Vds = −100 V.
The results from OFET and CELIV measurements show that, in the studied AnE-PVstat films, similar intrinsic film conductivity values and electric field independent charge carrier mobility were obtained (Fig. 3). The absence of electric field dependence and rather high carrier mobility indicates that no activation energy is required to reach higher mobility values. This provides a hint for the existence of optimal Density-of-States (DOS) for charge carrier transport in the studied AnE-PVstat polymer.27,35 The charge carrier mobility will mainly depend on the concentration of charge carriers, as well as on the properties of DOS distribution.36 Usually, higher charge carrier mobility values are reported for planar field effect transistor structures compared to diode geometry. As it has been observed before, in OFETs with low polarity dielectric, the measured mobility was very similar to the bulk mobility measured by TOF37 suggesting that the DOS might have the same properties in the bulk of the material and at the interface. Even though in our experiments the charge carrier mobilities were measured at different carrier concentrations (n = 4 × 1014 cm−3 from CELIV and n = 2 × 1018 cm−3 from OFET), observed similar mobility values can be explained by the presence of narrow distribution of DOS. Such beneficial DOS for charge transport requires little activation energies and will render a charge carrier concentration and electric field independent mobility as observed from CELIV (Fig. 3).35
Obtained mobility values are the highest compared to the whole family group of anthracene based AnE-PV as well as poly[2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)phenylene-vinylene] (MDMO-PPV) polymers studied in the past (Table 3);12,36 and is of the same order of magnitude (10−4) as the polymers exhibiting the present state-of-art reported and certified energy conversion efficiencies of ∼7%.6 The mobility values are, however, close to those of the amorphous materials AnE-PVba and -bb, i.e. showing less stacking behavior.

It is ascertained from the data in Table 3 that intrinsic hole mobility as measured by the CELIV technique is favored by both less stacking (i.e. high dπ–π values or no stacking at all). This leads to the conclusion that, at least for PPE-PPV type of materials, charge carrier mobility strongly follows an intramolecular path and less an intermolecular one. This agrees well with our past findings on photoconductivity studies carried out with PPE-PPVs, whereby high photocurrents were measured at low threshold voltages for polymers with less stacking tendency (due to grafting of a high number of bulky branched 2-ethylhexyloxy and/or long linear octadecyloxy side chains). It was then concluded that photoconductivity is more an intramolecular process than an intermolecular one.38 Our conclusions are moreover supported by recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on charge mobility and transport mechanism of self-assembled P3HT molecules.39 The authors used a hopping transport model to examine the variation of charge mobility with torsional angle and the π–π-stacking distance dπ–π between two adjacent thiophene segments. The MD results indicated that the resultant mobility along the π–π inter-chain direction is significantly less than that along the intra-chain direction. Accordingly the main charge transfer route within P3HT ordered domains is an intramolecular rather than an intermolecular one.39 van Breemen et al. also observed a significant improvement of OFET mobility up to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1upon dilution of the PPV backbone with both long linear undecanyloxy and octadecyloxy side chains.15
The observed electric field and concentration independent carrier mobility suggest the suitability of AnE-PVstat for applications as a hole transporting material or for use in high power conversion efficiency organic solar cells.
(C) Photovoltaic studies
Photovoltaic (PV) studies were carried out with 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 AnE-PVstat:PCBM blends. PV parameters were measured before and after annealing at 110 °C for 5 minutes. The nanomorphology of the various blends was also investigated before and after annealing using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Fig. 5, S2 and S3† depict the I–V curves of 1:2, 1:1 and 1:3 AnE-PVstat:PCBM ratios, respectively. It is ascertained from these curves that in dark condition the solar cells show a rectification ratio of approximately 104 at ±2V, an indication of efficient polarization of the device in the forward direction where electrons are injected from a low work function electrode (Al) to the LUMO of the blend while holes are injected from a high work function electrode to the HOMO of the blend. This is evidence of a good forward biased diode (solar cell).40
Irrespective of AnE-PVstat:PCBM blend ratio, the solar cells showed reproducible open circuit voltage VOC values between 800 and 840 mV which is a function of the HOMO of the polymer and that of the LUMO of the acceptor independent of the blend ratio.2,41 The short circuit current JSC and fill factor FF values were found to be dependent on both polymer:PCBM ratio and thermal treatment. As can be seen in Fig. 5 and S2 and S3† as well as Table 4, the short circuit current decreases with increasing PCBM proportion prior to annealing. After annealing at 110 °C, JSC decreases in the case of the 1:1 blend ratio, remains almost the same in the 1:2 blend ratio and increases in the 1:3 blend ratio.
Table 4 Photovoltaic parameters from solar cells with different blend ratios of AnE-PVstat:PCBM measured before (a) and after (b) annealing at 110 °C for 5 minutes. The active layer thickness was ∼190 nm for 1:1 and ∼245 nm for 1:2 and 1:3 blend ratios. Consistency of the results is demonstrated

Prior to annealing, there is an increase of the fill factor with increasing PCBM concentration going from 1:1 to 1:2 ratio. Further increase to 1:3 ratio brings virtually no changes as compared to 1:2 ratio. The annealing process led to a decrease of FF in the 1:1 ratio, but an increase in the 1:2 and 1:3 ratios.
The trend in the JSC and FF in these devices showed that with low PCBM concentration, the solar cells perform better before annealing, but with higher PCBM concentration better performance is achieved after annealing. The best performance was achieved with 1:2 blend ratio where VOC, JSC and FF values are relatively higher and stable even after annealing of the solar cells. The AFM images of these proportions (see below and Fig. S4†) also confirmed that there is no significant difference in morphology before and after annealing.
As can be seen from the IPCE curves in Fig. 6, a contribution to photocurrent from the absorption of PCBM is observed at a peak around 390 nm and a kink around 710 nm. This is evidenced from the intense optical absorption peak of the blend at around 390 nm, but not in the pure polymer film. The intensity of the IPCE peaks at 390 nm and 710 nm increased with increasing PCBM concentration. The IPCE of the solar cells increases from 1:1 to 1:2 polymer:PCBM blend ratio because the charge transport becomes more efficient with increasing PCBM amount42 but the IPCE decreases as the amount of PCBM further increases in the 1:3 ratio (see also Fig. S2 and S3†). This is associated with the less contribution of PCBM to the total absorption in the visible spectral range leading to a decrease of the fraction of photons absorbed by the solar cell.43 Integrating the IPCE data of the best cell measured after annealing in this experiment with AnE-PVstat:PCBM 1:2 gives an estimate for JSC under AM1.5 conditions of 7.80 mA cm−2 which is consistent with the JSC value of 7.80 mA cm−2 obtained during I–V measurement. The slight difference observed in the nonannealed case between the calculated current from the IPCE (7.80 mA cm−2) and the experimental value from the I–V measurement (7.82 mA cm−2) lies within the range of error.
 Fig. 6  IPCE curves of the best solar cells made from AnE-PVstat:PCBM (1:2) blend before and after annealing at 110 °C for 5 minutes as well as the corresponding optical absorptions of the pristine polymer and the blend. 
In summary high performance solar cells are obtained with AnE-PVstat even at low PCBM content as compared to those with lower dπ–π values. In all 3 blending ratios efficiencies above 3% were achieved, whereby the best cell with AnE-PVstat:PCBM (1:2) showed a VOC of 830 mV, JSC of 7.80 mA, a filling factor of 58% and an energy conversion efficiency of ∼3.8%. Table 4 shows the consistency of the PV parameters.
The AFM surface morphology images of AnE-PVstat:PCBM thin films with three different AnE-PVstat to PCBM ratios are presented in Fig. S4†. The top row of the figure shows the AFM images of as deposited films, while the bottom row shows the images of AnE-PVstat:PCBM films annealed in an inert atmosphere at 110 °C for 5 minutes. The AnE-PVstat:PCBM films with a 1:1 blend ratio show very smooth and almost featureless surfaces. Beside a slight increase of the surface roughness from 0.7 nm to 1.1 nm, no significant change is observed upon annealing (see Fig. S4a and S4b†). On the other hand, a well defined grain morphology is observed for the 1:2 blend ratio (see Fig. S4c and S4d†). In this case, upon annealing the grain size slightly decreases and a more compact film is obtained, which is reflected in a decrease of the surface roughness from around 4 nm to 2 nm. An additional increase of PCBM concentration from 1:2 to 1:3 blend ratio induces a further increase in the grain size, as observed in images Fig. S4e and S4f† in comparison with images Fig. S4c and S4d†. After annealing, the 1:3 ratio AnE-PVstat:PCBM films become also slightly more compact and the surface roughness decreases from 6 to 4 nm.
It can be summarized that, for the ratios of PCBM, equal to (1:2) and (1:3), annealing of the blends resulted in more compact nature of the films which decreases the phase separation as evidenced from the decrease in surface roughness, explaining the enhancement of the solar cell performance observed in both cases, whereby the best performance was achieved for the 1:2 case due to optimal phase separation, as evidenced by the AFM morphology images.
By reducing the active layer thickness to about ∼100 nm,12 it was possible to achieve a power conversion efficiency of ∼3.8% already with a 1:1 polymer:PCBM blend ratio. Similar improvement of the solar cell performance upon decrease of the active layer film thickness was observed in the past with PPE-PPV compounds acting as acceptor components in a polymer–polymer bulk heterojunction construct.41 Based on these results, a comparison with the study in ref.12b is possible. It shows that there is an increase of solar cell performance with increasing dπ–π (Table 5). Keeping the side chain volume fraction equal as in AnE-PVab, -ba, -bb and -stat, the VOC shows no significant difference, but the short circuit current JSC and the filling factor FF depend on degree of stacking. No stacking ability at all as in the amorphous compounds AnE-PVba and -bb favors very high miscibility between donor and acceptor, which in turn favors charge recombination and thus negatively affects the FF and JSC. An increase in dπ–π, as observed from AnE-PVab to -stat, seems to positively affect JSC and FF, and thus the overall performance. Fig. S5† depicts the I–V curves of the 1:1 and 1:2 polymer:PCBM blend ratios for the lower active layer film thickness.

In summary, AnE-PVstat is so far the best AnE-PV compound for solar cell application because of favorable side chains distribution.
Conclusion
The randomly grafting of segments of linear octyloxy and segments of branched 2-ethylhexyloxy side chains has resulted in a side chain based statistical copolymer AnE-PVstat showing far better features than its side chain based well defined congeners. As a consequence, relatively high (5.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) as well as electric field independent charge carrier mobility was measured by both CELIV and OFET techniques. The -stat hole mobility values are close to those of the amorphous polymers -ba and -bb, leading to the conclusion that charge carrier mobility is more an intrachain process than an interchain one, in agreement with past photoconductivity results carried out with PPE-PPVs.38 The present state-of–art efficiency of ∼3.8% for PPV based materials has been achieved for AnE-PVstat even at fullerene contents of 50% for thinner active layer films. For thicker films, annealing step at 110 °C was necessary to enhance the solar cell performance for 1:2 and 1:3 AnE-PVstat:PCBM blend ratios.
