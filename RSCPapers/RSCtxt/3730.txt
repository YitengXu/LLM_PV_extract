    , Accepted 5th December 2013First published on 6th December 2013AbstractAn in situ carbon-grafted alkaline iron electrode prepared from the active material obtained by decomposing the α-FeC2O4·2H2O–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite at 600 °C in a vacuum is reported. The active material comprises a mixture of α-Fe and Fe3O4 with the former as the prominent component. A specific discharge capacity in excess of 400 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 is obtained with a faradaic efficiency of 80% for the iron electrode made from carbon-grafted active material (CGAM). The enhanced performance of the alkaline iron electrode is attributed to the increased amount of metallic iron in the active material and its concomitant in situ carbon grafting.

Broader context
The increasing world energy consumption coupled with the growing demand for low or zero carbon emission has brought increasing awareness of the need for efficient renewable energy sources. Energy based on electricity generated from renewable sources, namely solar or wind, offers enormous potential for meeting future energy demands. However, energy production from renewable sources is intermittent and therefore unpredictable. Accordingly, storage and release of electrical energy is unarguably critical for the success of renewable power sources. Nickel–iron batteries with their proven long-life are ideal candidates for storing energy. The nickel–iron battery was invented as early as 1901 and was extensively deployed in the railway carriages of the erstwhile Soviet Union. However, the instability of the iron electrode in alkaline medium put the lid on the nickel–iron battery technology. But, in recent years, seminal improvements have occurred in the iron electrodes that have revived interest in the nickel–iron batteries and related systems. The iron electrode reported here delivers a specific capacity value in excess of 400 mA h g−1.

Introduction
In May 2013, the world breached the threshold of 400 ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and entered a new danger zone with ramifications for our security, welfare and economic development. This is a wake-up call in efforts to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. For the world that thirsts for more and more energy, this means immediate action to detach from dependence on fossil fuels and resort to renewables. Accordingly, the desiderata for moving to energy technologies with low-carbon footprints are enormous. It is particularly recognized that the development of cost-effective, long-lasting, robust, efficient, eco-friendly and large-scale electrical energy storage systems is vital to increase the reliance on renewables, such as wind energy and solar energy. Batteries are ideal for this purpose as they can address the varying demands of all applications. However, a battery system that is eminently suitable for a portable application may be found wanting for a stationary application. Therefore, sometimes it is necessary to revisit systems that have long been forgotten or got carried away in the euphoria of new inventions. In hibernation for decades, due to exaggerated elation generated by rapid strides in competing battery systems, the nickel–iron and iron–air systems have begun to catch the attention of policy makers. The resurrection of these systems rests heavily on their techno-economic feasibility for a number of applications arising out of recent technological developments.
Among the aforesaid iron-based batteries, the manufacture of nickel–iron batteries commenced in 1908, but this system was not commercially successful and, until recently, there was only a very limited production of stationary batteries in the US, Germany and Russia. However, the development of improved iron electrodes is changing the situation, and the nickel–iron batteries are being actively considered for electric vehicle propulsion and other applications. Iron is the fourth most abundant element on earth. It is cost effective, has large theoretical specific capacity and is non-toxic.1–10 Iron-based accumulators are both mechanically and electrically rugged. Besides, iron electrodes are also environmentally benign unlike other battery electrode materials, such as cadmium, lead and zinc.
The charge–discharge reactions of an alkaline iron electrode are given below. During the first charge–discharge step, Fe(OH)2 is reduced to Fe and vice versa as shown in reaction (1).11–13 Fe + 2OH− ⇆ Fe(OH)2 + 2e− E° = −0.88 V vs. SHE(1)
Fe(OH)2 being an insulating material could passivate the electrode. To avoid passivation, Fe–C composite anodes with improved electrode conductivity were reported by several researchers.14–19 The open-circuit potential of a charged alkaline iron electrode (E° = −0.88 V vs. SHE) is always negative to the hydrogen evolution reaction in the same solution. Consequently, iron is thermodynamically unstable and suffers from corrosion through concomitant evolution of hydrogen according to reaction (2). 2H2O + 2e− ⇆ H2 + 2OH− E° = −0.83 V vs. SHE(2)
Hydrogen evolution also occurs while charging the alkaline iron electrodes and brings about a decrease in the charge acceptance. Several sulphide additives, such as FeS, PbS and Bi2S3, have been used to increase the hydrogen overpotential.20–28
In the literature,20–26 iron active material (α-Fe and Fe3O4) obtained by decomposing α-FeC2O4·2H2O has been reported to deliver specific capacity in the range of 250–300 mA h g−1. It has also been reported that the magnetite present in the active material is not utilized for the desired electrode reaction, and accordingly it delivers lower capacity with poor charge acceptance.29
In this paper, we report an in situ carbon-grafted alkaline iron electrode for iron-based accumulators with specific capacity values in excess of 400 mA h g−1 with a faradaic efficiency of about 80% at C/10, C/5, C/2 rate. Even at C and 2C rate, specific discharge capacity values of 376 and 322 mA h g−1 are obtained with respective faradaic efficiency values of 75 and 64%. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best ever reported specific capacity values for an alkaline-iron electrode.30
Experimental
Ferrous oxalate dihydrate (α-FeC2O4·2H2O) was synthesized by precipitation of ferrous ions in ferrous sulphate (FeSO4·7H2O) solution with oxalic acid (H2C2O4·2H2O) solution. Pristine active material (PAM) was prepared by decomposing α-FeC2O4·2H2O at 600 °C in a vacuum. It results in a mixture of metallic iron (α-Fe) and magnetite (Fe3O4). Carbon-grafted active materials CGAM-5, CGAM-10, CGAM-15, CGAM-20 with increasing amounts of α-Fe were prepared by decomposing the α-FeC2O4·2H2O–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite with 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt% and 20 wt% PVA, respectively, in the precursor composite at 600 °C in a vacuum. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data for α-FeC2O4·2H2O and the α-FeC2O4·2H2O–10 wt% PVA composite were obtained in the temperature range of 25 °C to 600 °C using a Mettler Toledo Themogravimetric analyser. The molecular weight of PVA used was 125000.
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of PAM, CGAM-10 and CGAM-20 were recorded on a Philips X'pert-pro X-ray diffractometer using a CuKα source (λ = 0.15406 nm). Raman spectra were recorded with a LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) using an Ar laser (λ = 514 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on the PAM, CGAM-10 and CGAM-20 employing a Thermo-Fischer Multilab 2000 instrument with a MgKα X-ray source. A Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM, Sirion FEI, USA) was used to characterize the morphology of the various synthesized samples.
The electrodes with Bi2S3 additive comprised 82.5 wt% active material, 10 wt% carbon black, 1 wt% Bi2S3, and 0.5 wt% NiSO4·7H2O. The electrodes without Bi2S3 additive comprised 83.5 wt% of active material, 10 wt% carbon black, and 0.5 wt% NiSO4·7H2O. The admixtures were mixed homogeneously to form a slurry to which 6 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) 60 wt% dispersion in H2O was added. After adding PTFE into the slurry, a dough was formed which was spread onto a degreased nickel mesh of dimensions 3.1 × 3.3 cm2 and compacted at 675 kg cm−2. For all the electrodes, 1 g of active material was distributed over an area of 17.4 cm2 (active material loading = 57.5 mg cm−2). The compacted electrodes were sintered at 350 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Subsequently, the electrodes were assembled with nickel oxyhydroxide counter electrodes on either side with mercury/mercuric oxide (MMO) as a reference electrode (E° = 0.098 V vs. SHE).
Galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained employing a conventional three-electrode cell with 6 M KOH aqueous solution having 1 w/v% LiOH as the electrolyte using a Solartron analytical cell test system (Model 1470E, AMETEK, UK).
Results and discussion
TGA data for α-FeC2O4·2H2O and the α-FeC2O4·2H2O–10 wt% PVA composite are shown in Fig. 1. A two step weight loss is observed for α-FeC2O4·2H2O, namely dehydration of α-FeC2O4·2H2O and decomposition of FeC2O4. In the case of the α-FeC2O4·2H2O–10 wt% PVA composite, a three step weight loss is observed, the second step for the thermal decomposition and carbonization of PVA.32

Powder XRD patterns of PAM, CGAM-10 and CGAM-20, prepared by decomposing α-FeC2O4·2H2O, the α-FeC2O4·2H2O + 10 wt% PVA composite and the α-FeC2O4·2H2O + 20 wt% PVA composite at 600 °C, are shown in Fig. 2(a–c). XRD patterns of CGAM-5 and CGAM-15 are not included in Fig. 2 for the sake of brevity. In Fig. 2, the diffraction lines corresponding to α-Fe and Fe3O4 are labeled in the XRD patterns as Δ for α-Fe and * for Fe3O4. For CGAM, the relative intensity of the diffraction lines corresponding to Fe3O4 reduces as the amount of PVA in the precursor composite increases. Interestingly, when the PVA content in the precursor composite is 20 wt%, the diffraction pattern suggests the absence of Fe3O4. The diffraction data also reflect an increase in the relative intensity of the diffraction lines corresponding to α-Fe with increase in the amount of PVA in the precursor composite. CGAM is prepared by the following steps. Step-1: conversion of the α-FeC2O4·2H2O–PVA composite to the α-FeC2O4–PVA composite, i.e. dihydrate to an anhydrous compound, step-2: thermal decomposition of α-FeC2O4 and PVA, step-3: carbonization of polymer (PVA), and step-4: reduction of Fe3O4 (magnetite) to α-Fe (metallic iron) by carbonaceous products. During the decomposition, about 2–3 wt% of carbon is obtained as a conductive coating on the surface of the iron and magnetite particles as found by physical estimation. For physical estimation of carbon in the active material, the latter is treated with 5 M aq. HCl to dissolve metallic iron and iron oxide present in it followed by its filtering; the residue thus obtained is copiously washed with distilled water, dried and weighed on a micro-balance. Accordingly, PVA acts both as a reducing agent and a carbon source.31,32

FESEM images of the PAM and CGAM-10 are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The image of CGAM-10 exhibits a carbon coating on the surface of the particles. The particle size of PAM and CGAM-10 is in between 5 and 10 microns.

The powder XRD pattern of amorphous carbon extracted from the CGAM-10 is shown in Fig. 4. As described earlier, α-Fe and Fe3O4 in the active material are removed by reacting with 5 M aq. HCl.31,32 As a result, iron and magnetite go into solution as chlorides of iron. Thereafter, about 2 wt% of carbon is found to be present in the CGAM-10 as discussed earlier. Broad peaks atypical of amorphous carbon are observed in the powder XRD pattern.

Raman spectra of PAM, CGAM-10 and amorphous carbon extracted from CGAM-10 are shown in Fig. 5(a–c). The Raman spectra (excitation wavelength = 514 nm) exhibit two broad bands, one at 1592 cm−1, and the other at 1352 cm−1 that are typical of amorphous carbon present in the active material.

Fe 2p3/2 XPS spectra of PAM, CGAM-10 and CGAM-20 are shown in Fig. 6(a–c), respectively. All the spectra are recorded in the 702.5–718 eV region and deconvoluted using XPSPEAK 4.1 software. In the spectra, the Fe(0)-2p3/2 peak observed at 706.8 eV is characteristic of metallic iron while Fe(II)-2p3/2 peaks at 708.4 eV and 709.2 eV are characteristic of Fe(II) in Fe3O4; Fe(III)-2p3/2 peaks observed at 710.2 eV, 711.2 eV, 712.3 eV, 713.4 eV and 714.5 eV correspond to Fe(III) in Fe3O4. These data are fitted using Fe 2p3/2 spectral fitting parameters from the literature.33 Amounts of metallic iron and magnetite present on the surface of the samples are indicated in Fig. 6. For CGAM-10 and CGAM-20, an increase in the intensity of the Fe 2p3/2 peak corresponding to the metallic iron is observed in relation to PAM. The amount of metallic iron present on the surface of the samples increases from 16% for PAM to 46% for CGAM-20. This corroborates the XRD data shown in Fig. 2 and confirms that PVA provides reducing atmosphere during the decomposition of the precursor composite leading to higher metallic contents in relation to PAM.

Typical galvanostatic charge and discharge potential profiles for alkaline iron electrodes with PAM and CGAM-10 are shown in Fig. 7. The data for CGAM-5, CGAM-15 and CGAM-20 are not included in Fig. 7 as these follow the same profile. Only the data for the best performing electrode, i.e. CGAM-10, are presented in Fig. 7. In the figure, CGAM-10 with Bi2S3 additive exhibits a specific discharge capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 with a faradaic efficiency of about 80% as compared to the specific discharge capacity of 300 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 with a faradaic efficiency of about 60% obtained for PAM with Bi2S3 additive. The specific discharge capacity values of CGAM-5, CGAM-15 and CGAM-20 are found to be between 300 and 400 mA h g−1. The current density for both charge and discharge processes of the electrodes are maintained identically at 100 mA g−1. The charging potential profiles for iron electrodes follow an S-shaped curve with two plateaus at −1.1 V vs. MMO and −1.15 V vs. MMO. The hydrogen evolution rate is higher for the second plateau at −1.15 V vs. MMO compared to the first plateau at −1.1 V vs. MMO since the former is about 50 mV more negative. In the case of PAM, the electrode potential reaches the second plateau after accepting a charge of about 320 mA h g−1 while, for the CGAM-10, the electrode potential reaches the second plateau after accepting a charge of about 450 mA h g−1. CGAM-10 exhibits an increased charge acceptance due to the presence of the higher amount of metallic iron. Besides, in the discharge potential profile, the initial potential drop is smaller for CGAM-10 compared to PAM due to the presence of the carbon coating and an increased amount of metallic iron.

The first derivative of charging potential (V) with respect to charge specific capacity, namely dV/d(specific capacity), is plotted against the charge specific capacity of iron electrodes with PAM and CGAM-10 in Fig. 8. The charging potential profile for iron electrodes has an inflection region. The derivative plot clearly shows the inflection region as peaks. The peak centered at ∼270 mA h g−1 is attributed to PAM, while the peak at ∼430 mA h g−1 corresponds to CGAM-10. Accordingly, there is an increase in the charge acceptance of CGAM-10 due to the increase in the amount of metallic iron present in the material.

Typical Nyquist plots for iron electrodes with PAM, CGAM-10 and CGAM-20 are shown in Fig. 9. Electrochemical impedance data for the cell are obtained at the fully charged state at open-circuit potential in the frequency range between 100 kHz and 100 mHz with an ac amplitude of 5 mV. At −Z′′ = 0, the Z′ value corresponds to the ohmic resistance of the active material, electrolyte and current collector. The ohmic resistance of the iron electrode with CGAM-10 is 32 mΩ which is lower in relation to 41.5 mΩ for PAM due to the presence of increased amounts of metallic iron in the former. As expected, the electrode comprising CGAM-20 exhibits the lowest ohmic resistance of 18 mΩ. Similarly, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the CGAM-10 electrodes (Rct = 8 mΩ) is lower than that of PAM based electrodes (Rct = 10 mΩ). Accordingly, the reaction kinetics on the former electrodes will be faster.

The discharge potential profiles for CGAM with varying amounts of PVA in the precursor composite are shown in Fig. 10. It is observed that CGAM with about 10 wt% of PVA in the precursor composite is optimum to deliver a specific discharge capacity of ∼400 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1.

The specific discharge capacities of the iron electrodes comprising CGAM-10 with Bi2S3, and PAM with and without Bi2S3 additive as a function of the cycle number are shown in Fig. 11. It is noteworthy that the formation of electrodes depends on the porosity and composition of the active material.34 This is reflected in the data for the electrodes comprising PAM with Bi2S3 additive and the electrodes comprising CGAM-10 with Bi2S3 additive. For CGAM-10 with Bi2S3 additive, a maximum capacity of about 386 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 is obtained, which recedes to a discharge capacity of 356 mA h g−1 in the 100th cycle. By contrast, for PAM with Bi2S3 additive, a maximum capacity of 302 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 is obtained, which recedes to a discharge capacity of 258 mA h g−1 in the 100th cycle. In the case of PAM without Bi2S3 additive, a capacity of 145 mA h g−1 is obtained during the 1st cycle that subsequently recedes to about 4 mA h g−1. It is therefore surmised that Bi2S3 improves the charge acceptance of the iron electrode by increasing the hydrogen overpotential.12 It appears that, for PAM without Bi2S3 additive, the initial capacity of 145 mA h g−1 is obtained for the first cycle due to the presence of α-Fe in the active material but in the subsequent cycles hydrogen evolution dominates preventing the conversion of oxidized iron to metallic iron that restricts its capacity. In the case of the iron electrode with Bi2S3 additive, elemental bismuth is formed from Bi2S3 on the surface of the active material following reaction (3).35,36 Bi2S3 + 6e− ⇆ 2Bi + 3S2− Eo = −0.82 V vs. SHE(3)

The above aspect is further substantiated by the powder XRD patterns of the Bi2S3 additive used in the iron electrode and the elemental Bi formed electrochemically in the iron electrode shown in Fig. 12.

The discharge potential profiles for iron electrodes with CGAM-10 at varying discharge rates, namely C/10, C/5, C/2, C and 2C rate, are shown in Fig. 13. At C/10, C/5, C/2 rates, a specific discharge capacity of about 400 mA h g−1 is obtained with a faradaic efficiency of about 80%. Even at C and 2C rates, specific discharge capacity values of 376 and 322 mA h g−1 are obtained with a faradaic efficiency of 75 and 64%, respectively.

Conclusions
A novel in situ process to synthesize CGAM from the α-FeC2O4·2H2O + PVA composite with increased amounts of metallic iron for application in nickel–iron and iron–air accumulators is reported. Iron electrodes from CGAM are cost-effective and environmentally benign. Alkaline iron electrodes render a specific discharge capacity in excess of 400 mA h g−1 with a faradaic efficiency of 80%, and can be discharged both at high and low rates.

Broader context
The increasing world energy consumption coupled with the growing demand for low or zero carbon emission has brought increasing awareness of the need for efficient renewable energy sources. Energy based on electricity generated from renewable sources, namely solar or wind, offers enormous potential for meeting future energy demands. However, energy production from renewable sources is intermittent and therefore unpredictable. Accordingly, storage and release of electrical energy is unarguably critical for the success of renewable power sources. Nickel–iron batteries with their proven long-life are ideal candidates for storing energy. The nickel–iron battery was invented as early as 1901 and was extensively deployed in the railway carriages of the erstwhile Soviet Union. However, the instability of the iron electrode in alkaline medium put the lid on the nickel–iron battery technology. But, in recent years, seminal improvements have occurred in the iron electrodes that have revived interest in the nickel–iron batteries and related systems. The iron electrode reported here delivers a specific capacity value in excess of 400 mA h g−1.
