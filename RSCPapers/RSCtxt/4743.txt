Broader context
The requirement for a green and clean energy source is in global demand. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), are a front runner among new solar cell technologies owing to their low production cost and efficiency, which make them a promising alternative for certain applications. Recently DSSCs have exhibited over 13% power conversion efficiency at an AM 1.5 full sunlight irradiation, by employing a panchromatic porphyrin dye in conjugation with cobalt based redox shuttle. To aid the commercial application of DSSCs cost cutting and chemical stability is of immense interest. In this review article we provide an overview of the platinum group metal free sensitizers as well as counter electrode to further inspire the DSSCs community towards a new generation of cost effective DSSCs.

1. Introduction
Growing urbanization requires a huge amount of energy to fulfil societal needs and thus the planet’s appetite for energy is increasing. Depleting natural resources and catastrophes with nuclear reactors are shaping renewable energy systems to be among the winners to compete with the terawatt energy challenge.1,2 As a matter of fact, the energy source obtained from a decarbonized process to rival our global warming is a matter of intense investigation. Photovoltaic (PV) devices convert light into energy, but they require energy during their fabrication process too. Until recently, the PV industry was consuming more electricity than it can produce, during the silicon based PV fabrication, it requires silica melting at >1600 °C. Though silicon is in abundance, Si-based PV will barely reach the terawatt range, as large scale production of this technology will be hampered by the limited global stocks of silver, commonly used as electrode material.3 This promotes the development of a new type of solar cells, where scientists have been trying to mimic plants for the last many decades, to adapt the process of photosynthesis in labs.4 Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are among one of the available alternatives, exploited due to their unparalleled merits.5 Highly efficient sensitized solar cells were, first of all, described in a seminal work by Michael Grätzel and now aptly called the “Grätzel cell”.6 The DSSC consists of a mechanical support coated with a transparent conductor, on which TiO2 nanocrystals are deposited to form a mesoporous network on which a sensitizer is anchored, and in combination with platinized cathode separated by a thin layer of redox shuttle (Fig. 1). DSSC is the only PV device that separates light absorption and charge transportation during the photoelectric conversion, thus mimicking the photosynthesis process as in plants.7 Hence it offers the opportunity to individually tailor and optimize the light absorption and charge transfer process. DSSCs are a viable alternative to conventional silicon based PV, owing to its low cost, ease of fabrication and short energy payback time, endorsed by the Millennium Technology Prize Committee in 2010.8 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has also reached up to double digit for commercial module9 and by avoiding the use of indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductor power in excess of 5 Tw could be produced.3 The ability to be designed as flexible as power windows, and high efficiency under low and diffuse light, add further to their merits as compared to other PV technologies. In DSSCs light is absorbed by a monolayer of a dye located at the junction between an electron and hole transporting phases where the electron transport material is a wide band gap semiconductor material typically TiO2 (anatase), while the hole transport system is a redox shuttle. On light-irradiation the dye injects an electron and a hole into the n- and p-type materials, respectively, generating free charge carriers, which then travel through the nanostructures to be collected as current and flow to the external circuits.10,11 During the last two decades research efforts have been made on the development of new sensitizers, photoanode engineering, redox shuttle and catalyst to fabricate efficient devices. A cost effective development of these materials is the paramount research which made DSSCs the undisputed choice for a cheap and clean energy source. Metal free sensitizers and counter electrodes are of outmost importance to complement natural resources. In this context organic dyes and carbon based counter electrodes are of significant interest to be reviewed. The counter electrode is one of the essential components, which reduces the oxidized redox shuttle generated after the dye regeneration. Carbon based materials are envisioned as an alternative to Pt as they are inexpensive, have low electrical resistance and show electro-catalytic activity for the reduction of redox shuttle.12,13

Easily available, inexpensive and non-toxic wide band gap semiconductor material, TiO2 is an indispensable choice as a mesoscopic layer to be used as photoanode, and its shape and size can be engineered to obtain better PV properties.14,15 The classical redox shuttle, iodide/triiodide and ruthenium complexes such as cis-dithiocyanatobis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)Ru(II) as the most commonly used sensitizer from early days and give one of the best PCE.16 The high surface area of the semiconductor layer made up of nanoparticles dictates the success of the DSSC, as it facilitates increased the dye loading when compared to single crystals. This will showly increase the optical density to measure better light harvesting properties. The PCE of DSSCs depends on optimization and compatibility of each of its components, the first and foremost requirement for the device is to be able to collect as much photons from sun rays as possible. We direct the reader for some excellent articles on photoanode engineering and redox shuttle chemistry.17–21 In this review article we provide an overview of dyes and electro-catalysts to further bring the cost in DSSC fabrication down by using metal free dyes and carbon based catalysts. Ruthenium based sensitizers are a vital component of DSSCs and are currently being employed,22 but they belong to the platinum group metal category similar to the case of platinum in a platinized cathode. Platinized cathode, apart from its cost is not optimal to be used as a catalyst with other redox shuttles different from iodide/triiodide. To overcome the current bottleneck the use of (1) metal free dyes and (2) a platinum free electrocatalyst for DSSCs are summarized, to pave the way for a new generation of cost effective DSSCs. Thus it is paramount to develop new Ru and Pt free materials that are cheaper but still capable of yielding comparable efficiencies and device stabilities to those reported in the past.
2. Metal-free organic dyes for DSSCs
The search for new dyes to be used as sensitizer has always been of much attention in the DSSCs community, with many groups focusing on this area and a plethora of reports on the synthesis of either new sensitizers or optimization of existing ones. From the beginning of the last decade, it was understood in the scientific community that the future of DSSCs cannot only depend on ruthenium-based dyes. The record PCE obtained by Yella et al.23 with a porphyrin-based dye acted as a game changer in this direction. Ruthenium dyes though performing very well in the devices, are often criticized for the use of a platinum group metal, tricky purification and synthesis steps, and for their low molar extinction coefficients. On the contrary, metal-free organic dyes are not dependent on platinum group metals and exhibit high flexibility of the molecular design along with high molar extinction coefficients. The last decade has witnessed a tremendous progress in the use of organic dyes for DSSCs (Fig. 2). Some excellent reviews can be found in the literature which summarize the progress.24,25 Past approaches of metal-free sensitizers for DSSC were unsuccessful due to a narrow absorption in the visible region of the dyes, aggregation problems and poor stability of the devices. As a consequence, the PV parameters and PCE were far below those obtained with ruthenium sensitizers. A major breakthrough in the development of DSSC based on organic sensitizers came with the incorporation of dyes with a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structure which facilitates photo-induced charge separation. In this push–pull structure the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) are mainly localized on the donor part of the dye, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) are mainly localized on the acceptor part of the molecule. This spatial orientation not only favors the electron injection but also slows down recombination between electrons in the conduction band of the semiconductor and oxidized molecules. Additionally D–π–A dyes offer wide possibilities for rational designing and structural modification and this is vital towards achieving efficient light harvesting. Research on the optimization of D–π–A dyes has mainly been focused on:
(a) tuning the absorption of the dye to achieve a better match with the solar spectrum and a broader absorption in the near-infrared region;
(b) minimizing the energy level mismatch between the excited state dye oxidation potential and TiO2 conduction band, and HOMO and electrolyte to avoid potential losses;
(c) lowering the charge recombination rate at the TiO2/electrolyte interface;
(d) suppressing dye aggregation;
(e) increasing the stability of DSSC based on organic dyes.
The achievement made by tuning the above mentioned objectives is responsible for the significant PCE enhancement in DSSCs based on the iodide free redox shuttle in the last years. This was made possible with the synthesis of high molar extinction coefficient dyes with steric properties to reduce significantly recombination between TiO2 conduction band electrons and the oxidized redox shuttle. Indeed, molecular engineering is the best way to improve the performance of sensitizers and numerous studies have established that chemical modification of the different units which form a D–π–A dye can lead to the achievement of those objectives enumerated above. However, to gain further real advancement in sensitizer science, it is of paramount importance to establish rational links between chemical modifications and parameters such as absorbance, energy levels, surface coverage, recombination rate, etc., which determine the final performance of the dye.

2.1. Tuning of donor groups
The choice of a suitable donor group and optimizing its structure not only affect the absorption properties of the dye, but they can also dictate the charge recombination rate in the device, adjust the energy levels of the sensitizer, avoid dye aggregation and enable stability of the sensitizer.24 In fact, minor changes in the structure of the donors can lead to notable enhancement in the performance of the dye, and its thermal and photochemical stability. Several organic molecular compounds such as fluorene,26 coumarin,27 indoline,28 cyanine,29 merocyanine,29 hemicyanine,30 carbazole,31 perylene,32 triphenylamine,33 triarylamine,34 xanthene,35etc. have been employed as donors in D–π–A dyes. Triphenylamine (TPA), which shows a strong electron-donating ability and hole transport properties,24 has been the most widely employed. The most efficient metal-free organic dye reported up to now is the phenyldihexyloxy-substituted TPA (DHO-TPA) Dye 1 synthesized by Grätzel et al.,33 which exhibits a PCE of 10.3% in combination with a cobalt redox shuttle. The DHO-TPA moiety has been shown to be one of the most efficient donor, as apart from its high electron-donating ability mentioned above, its bulky phenyldihexyloxy groups slow down interface charge recombination.36 Also based on a substituted TPA donor and by optimizing the conjugated bridge of the dye, Wang et al.37 synthesized Dye 2, which yields a PCE of 10.3% for a metal-free organic dye with an iodine/iodide redox shuttle. Several strategies have been adopted to enhance the performance of TPA dyes. In order to increase the donor strength Ko et al.,38 incorporated a planarized donor unit that extended the spectral response of the sensitizer. This effect, together with the increase of lifetime and inhibition of dye aggregation provided by bulky units incorporated into the planar TPA unit, led to a PCE of 8.71% for Dye 3.38 The use of branched TPA sensitizers such as Dye 4 with two arylamine moieties at the donor part39 or Dye 5 with a dendritic structure40 has also been explored. Branched organic dyes PCE are still below those of TPA dyes or substituted TPA dyes, in all likelihood due to decreased surface coverage. However, the positive influence of these donor groups is the blocking effect, which reduces recombination41 and consequently improves the VOC. In addition, the possible suppression of aggregation with this type of dyes shows that incorporation of appropriate new branches could be a successful strategy to optimize the donor part of a D–π–A dye. A very interesting approach has been the introduction of multiple electron-donating substituents at the arylamine core to form a D–D–π–A structure.42,43 It was demonstrated by several groups that these starburst donor groups could lead to a bathochromic shift of the absorption spectra, enhanced absorptivity and better photochemical and thermal-stability over the simple D–π–A configuration, and will help suppress recombination due to extended delocalization of the radical cation. A PCE of 6.02% was reported by Tian et al.44 with Dye 6, which incorporates additional carbazole moieties onto the outside of the donor group to facilitate charge separation and thereby decrease recombination between the conduction band electrons and the oxidized sensitizer. Li and coworkers43 used tetraphenylethylene moieties as additional groups to TPA as shown in Dye 7. They found that those moieties helped suppress charge recombination and aggregation resulting in a reasonable PCE of 6.77%. Other groups have pointed out some disadvantages of using this multi-donor structure, such as their intricate synthesis and the decrease in adsorption due to their bulky molecules.45 Naphthalene,46 fluorene47 or truxene48 based triarylamine dyes have also been employed as donors. The Chow group has extensively studied the performance of D–π–A dyes containing N,N-diphenylnaphthalen-1-amine moieties as electron donors.46,49,50 When compared to triphenylamine dyes under the same measurement conditions, they observed a better performance for the naphthalene based dyes. This fact was attributed to several factors such as higher absorptivity and the large size of the naphthalene group which avoids self-aggregation of the dye. Among the different naphthalene based triarylamine dyes, the best performances were obtained using Dye 8 which yields a PCE of 7.08%.46 Choi et al.,51 have reported an efficiency of 9.1% for the fluorene based triarylamine Dye 9 using a liquid-based electrolyte. In combination with a solvent free ionic liquid based electrolyte, this dye exhibited PCE of 7.9% along with excellent stability under light soaking for 1000 h at 60 °C. Tian et al.52 observed a bathochromic shift of the absorption spectra when replacing a triphenylamine unit by indoline in the donor moiety, which is an indication of the more powerful electron-donating capability of the latter.52 Indoline dyes are one of the most efficient types of organic dyes due to their high absorption coefficient to result in high photocurrents. For example, Uchida et al.53 reported an indoline dye which has an absorption coefficient (68700 M−1 cm−1) which is five times higher than that of the conventional benchmark N719 dye (13900 M−1 cm−1 at 541 nm). Horiuchi and Uchida54 first reported DSSCs based on an indoline derivative with a 6.1% PCE. With the introduction of a second rhodamine network to the dye framework (which contributes to a red shift of the absorbance), with a long alkyl chain (which helps to control the aggregation), the group succeed in increasing the PCE to 9.52% for Dye 10.55 The use of a co-adsorbent as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was critical for the achievement of this efficiency as indoline dyes suffer from decisive aggregation problems, which limit the PCE in DSSCs. Though the obtained PCE is the highest until now for an indoline based dye in DSSCs, molecules similar to Dye 10, where the rhodamine-3-acetic acid acted as the acceptor and the anchoring units of the sensitizer, exhibit dye desorption and poor stability. As mentioned above, carbazole has also been employed as an electron donor in D–π–A dyes. With the aim of structural optimization of carbazole dyes, several attempts have been made. Hara, Mori, Koumura and coworkers56 showed that the incorporation of hexyloxyphenyl substituents to the carbazole unit increased the electron lifetime and led to better VOC. A PCE of 8.1% was obtained with the use of Dye 11. Looking for a better exploitation of near infrared (NIR) light some groups have focused their research on phtalocyanine, cyanine, croconate and squaraine dyes, which absorb strongly in this region. However, several drawbacks have been associated with this type of sensitizers such as high degree of aggregation, lack of directionality of the excited state or their narrow absorption limited to the NIR region. Usually this narrow absorption limits their use to complementary absorption with other dyes.57,58 Among NIR dyes, squaraine has attracted special interest due to its sharp and intense absorption bands in the visible and NIR regions. Additionally, it has considerable photo- and thermal stability.59,60 In the recent past remarkable progress has been made on squaraine based dyes. Ko et al.59 reported a PCE of 6.29% with use of unsymmetrical mixed pyrrole/indoline squaraine Dye 12. By exploiting carboxy cyanovinyl as an anchoring group instead of a directly attached carboxylic acid of previously synthesized squaraines59,61,62 Nazeeruddin, Marder, Grätzel et al.63 reported Dye 13, and were able to push the PCE to 6.74%. With a clever
molecular engineering approach this dye leads to the new squaraine Dye 14, recently reported by Grätzel and coworkers.64Dye 14, apart from having high absorbing properties exhibits a near-ideal panchromatic response and gave PCE of 7.3%. Most recently, Grätzel et al.65 reported a D–π–A dye in which the donor is the electron-rich heterocycle ullazine and found it appealing as a molecular unit (building blocks) for D–π–A systems. The ullazine group, with 16 π-electrons will facilitate a strong intramolecular charge transfer. It possesses both strong donating and electron-accepting properties, and multiple substitution sites for molecular engineering. Moreover large donor groups like ullazine will prevent aggregation and reduce recombination. After synthesizing several ullazine-based dyes with different substituents in its molecular structure, Grätzel and coworkers found that the best performing were those with the acceptor group linked to the side position of ullazine and were able to measure PCE of 8.4% with Dye 15. Meng and co-workers66 carried out a systematic study of the performance of several dyes which only differ in the donor moiety. This comparison includes ullazine, and more widely used donors such as diphenylaminophenyl or dimethylaminophenyl. They found that the ullazine core sensitizer absorbs the maximum amount of light and injects the highest number of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2, this was claimed to be the hallmark of this donor.
2.2. Molecular engineering of conjugated bridges in D–π–A dyes
The work of Yanagida67 and Hara68 based on phenyl dyes, and by Hara27 based on coumarin dyes demonstrated that the absorption spectra and redox potential of the sensitizers could be controlled by expansion of the π-conjugation length by introducing double or triple bonds. Since then, a huge number of modifications of the π-conjugation has been carried out and it is observed that the conjugated spacer plays a key role in the final performance of the dye. Both electron-rich (benzene, thiophene, fluorene, furan, pyrrole, etc.) and electron-deficient units (benzothiadiazole, 2,2′-bithiazole, quinoxaline, benzotriazole, diketopyrrolopyrrole, pyrimidine, pyridine, 2-thiazole, etc.) have been incorporated to the π-bridge. The linker must effectively relay electron density from the donor to the acceptor, facilitating charge separation upon excitation.69 With the introduction of various linkers between the acceptor and the donor, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the sensitizers can be tuned, extending the major absorption peak of the sensitizers and maximizing sunlight absorption.47,70,71 Moreover, other effects which determine the performance of the dye such as suppression of dye aggregation on the semiconductor, redox potential optimization of the sensitizer, or lowering the recombination rate, can also be achieved by fine tuning of the conjugated bridge. Usually, the extension of the π-conjugated bridge significantly contributes to a red shift in the absorption spectra of the dyes. The best moieties for the π-conjugated bridge very frequently contain thiophene units which exhibit excellent charge-transport properties.72 Hagfeldt, Sun et al.71 observed that incorporation of thiophene to extend the number of π-conjugations in a TPA dye prompted an enhanced spectral response. Wang and coworkers synthesized a large number of DHO-TPA dyes, and carried out a systematic study of the influence of different thiophene linkers on light absorption, energy-levels, photocurrent, and photovoltage.13,70,73,74 With reference to the performance of the DSSC with the DHO-TPA dye with a single thiophene unit70 (6.88%), i.e. with Dye 16a, successive improvement of the performance has been achieved, first for the DSSC by using Dye 16b, by substituting the mono thiophene by a thienothiophene (TT) unit (7.5%)73 and, next, for the DSSC by using Dye 16c, by substituting this thienothiophene unit by a bisthienothiophene (8%).74 It was observed that, apart from the bathochromic shift, the molar extinction coefficient increases with the extension of the π-conjugation (i.e. c > b > a).74 This stimulated huge interest and several thiophene derivatives have been explored. Chi, Chou et al.75 designed TPA Dye 17 containing the thiophene derivative 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), and they observed a broader spectral response which resulted in higher PCE (7.3%) in comparison with a similar dye with a single thiophene linker (5.20%).75 Further optimization led to the synthesis of several TPA dyes based on EDOT with various functionalized phenylenes as spacers.76 Apart from higher extinction coefficients of these dyes with respect to EDOT-based Dye 17,75 it gave an enhanced PCE of 8.22%76 with Dye 18, probably due to a fluorine substituents effect. Wang et al.77 incorporated 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′] dithiophene (CPDT) unit as π-segment in the DHO-TPA Dye 19a achieving a higher molar absorption coefficient (62.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1 at 555 nm) in comparison to the similar Dye 19b with the 2,2′-dithiophene (DT) unit as linker (33.8 × 103 M−1 cm−1 at 521 nm) and the PCE was 8.95 and 7.11% for Dye 19a and Dye 19b respectively.77 In addition to the enhancement of light absorption, the higher efficiency for Dye 19a was attributed to the reduction of surface states of the mesoporous TiO2 film and to the inhibition of the recombination. In general, sensitizers consisting of a CPDT unit as linker with substituted alkyl chains of C6 to C12 have proved to be very efficient in combination with iodine free redox shuttle.78,79 For example, a PCE of 9.4% was obtained for cells fabricated with Dye 20 in combination with a cobalt-based redox shuttle.78 Grätzel, Zakeeruddin, Wang and coworkers synthesized Dye 21,80 which incorporates dodecyl substituents on the CPDT segment. This dye exhibits a maximum molar absorption coefficient nearly five times higher than the one for the standard Z907 ruthenium sensitizer (5.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 555 nm and 1.2 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 521 nm respectively). The solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (ss-DSSC) fabricates with Dye 21 and using spiro-MeOTAD as hole transporting material (HTM) resulted in PCE of over 6%. A dye with a high molar extinction coefficient is a prerequisite in the fabrication of ss-DSSCs, where the use of thinner titanium oxide films (2–3 μm) is optimum to allow HTM infiltration. In addition to the widely used TPA dyes, there are many other examples in the literature, which show how the extension of the π-conjugation has a positive effect on the performance of dyes based on different types of donors. Harima et al.81 observed that the introduction of thiophene unit onto a carbazole dye resulted in the red-shift of absorption maximum and enhancement in the extinction coefficient. The extension of the π-conjugation (two thiophene units instead of one) also leads to a red-shift of the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum and an increase of the molar extinction coefficient in fluorene based triarylamine dyes like Dyes 22a and b. The PCE was pushed from 7.2% for Dye 22a to 8% for Dye 22b.82 Wang and coworkers studied the effect of conjugation linkers as dithienothiophene, thienothiophene and EDOT in bisfluorenylaniline based dyes and observed the same positive effects mentioned above for other type of dyes.47,83 Importantly, these dyes were stable when used in combination with ionic liquid based redox shuttle. There are also examples where the effects in the modification of the conjugation linkers in squaraine dyes are shown. For Dyes 13 and 14 mentioned in the previous section, Grätzel et al.63,64 observed that the extension of the π-bridge replacing thiophene (Dye 13)63 by a di-n-hexyl substituted CPDT bridge (Dye 14)64 in this asymmetric bis(indoline) squaraine sensitizers resulted in higher absorption and lower aggregation. Other electron-rich units different from thiophene i.e. benzene, fluorene,84 furan,85 pyrrole,86,87 have been also employed in order to improve the performance of D–π–A dyes. It was found that linkers such as furan ring85 or fluorene,84 gave better PCE than for thiophene-based dyes measured under the same conditions. However, PCE obtained with these spacers are still below the record PCE achieved with thiophene derivatives, which pave the way for further optimization and benefiting from their potential. Similar to thiophene, a bathochromic absorption as well as a molar extinction coefficient enhancement have been observed for arylamine dyes with two five-membered aromatic heterocycles such as, for example, furan and selenophene70 relative to their counterpart dyes with only one, resulting from the extension of the π-conjugation length. Most recently, Song, Bao, Jiang et al.88 reported the new diarylamine D–π–A Dye 23 which incorporates pyrene as the π-conjugated bridge and yielded PCE of 6.1%.
Apart from the extension of π-conjugation and finding a suitable heteroarene as π-linker, another strategy to improve the extinction coefficient as well as to obtain a panchromatic light harvesting is to increase the planarity of π-bridged systems.89,90 For example, the planar geometry of the conjugated thienothiophene–vinylene–thienothiophene linker was critical for the high energy conversion obtained with Dye 9 by Grätzel et al.51 Kang and coworkers34 used the dithienosilole (DTS) moiety as spacer in a triarylamine dye and they investigated the effect of different substituents at the 3-position of the DTS ring in DSSCs performance. A PCE of 7.5% was obtained with Dye 24 in which the bulky phenyl groups are attached to the DTS ring. Subsequently, Wong and co-workers89 designed a DHO-TPA dye with a diphenyl substituted dithienosilole as spacer obtaining similarly PCE 7.6%. The coplanar core with bulky phenyl groups attached on the DTS ring, apart from being very efficient light harvester, contributes to suppressing dye aggregation and charge recombination between the electrolyte and the photoanode. Increasing the conjugation length of the π-bridge seems to be a very effective way to achieve the previously mentioned objectives (a) and (b), and there are numerous reports on effective tuning of the HOMO and LUMO levels, extending the spectral response and increasing the absorption properties of the dyes. As discussed previously, apart from obtaining good light harvesting properties, there are some other drawbacks associated with organic dyes which need to be overcome, such as (c) their high recombination rates and (d) their high tendency to aggregate on the surface of the oxide. The former acquires special importance when working with iodine free redox shuttle, which are known to exhibit high recombination rates. Additionally, it is worth to note that organic dyes with elongation of the π-conjugated linker will tend to aggregate more easily through strong intermolecular π–π interactions.24 Several studies on the design and optimization of metal-free organic dyes have been focused on the introduction of bulky groups such as alkyl chains or aromatic rings on the spacer segment with the aim of inhibiting dye aggregation as well as increasing the electron lifetime.91 Nakamura, Tsuji, Grätzel and coworkers92 reported PCE of 7.12% with the arylamine Dye 25 based on a bulky linked moiety formed by carbon-bridge phenylenevinylene (CPV) with octyl side chains. As a consequence of suppression, charge recombination voltages close to 0.8 V with an iodide/triiodide redox shuttle are obtained for this dye. Hara and coworkers93,94 synthesized several carbazole sensitizers with a π-conjugation based on thiophene. They observed that the presence of n-hexyl chains linked to the thiophene units lead to an increase of the lifetime of Dye 26a with respect to Dye 26b. Due to this longer electron lifetime, the former exhibited a VOC significantly higher (0.75 V) than the latter (0.67 V). Grätzel et al.95 reported a PCE of 8.6% for the fluorene based triarylamine Dye 27 which includes thiophene units with aliphatic chains as π-bridge. The authors claimed that these hexyl chains also contribute to the stability of the dye, thus increasing the tolerance to the presence of water in the electrolyte and therefore avoiding possible water induced desorption of the dye. The previously mentioned Dye 9 also includes long alkyl chains and exhibits excellent stability under light soaking with a solvent free electrolyte.51 An important breakthrough in the development of D–π–A dyes was the synthesis of Dye 28 by Wang and coworkers74 which has yielded PCE of 9.8%. The authors showed that this amphiphilic dye consisting in a binary π-conjugated spacer leads to a significant increase of the absorption spectrum of the sensitizer. The EDOT unit connected to the arylamine donor lifts the energy of the HOMO and the thienothiophene unit conjugated with the acceptor leads to a suitable LUMO energy. Additionally, this dye illustrates an excellent stability and high PCE with a solvent free electrolyte.74 The record PCE of 10.3% (ref. 37) for Dye 2 was obtained by further modification of the binary pi-conjugated linker substituting thienothiophene by a dihexyl-substituted dithienosilole (DTS). This dye has a very high molar extinction coefficient (5.75 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 493 nm), and its IPCE exceed 90% from 500 to 590 nm. The high performance dye is the result of judicious molecular engineering which includes extension of the π-conjugation, planarization of the spacer, bulky long alkyl chains, and control of energy levels of the dye.
The incorporation of low-band gap chromophore units such as benzothiadiazole, benzotriazole,91 phtalimide,96 quinoxaline,97 diketopyrrolopyrrole, fluorene98 and dibenzosile99 in the bridging framework has appeared as a very interesting strategy for molecular engineering. A structure of the type D–A–π–A is formed, where the additional unit is expected to act as electron trap to separate charge and to facilitate migration to the final acceptor.100 Several groups have claimed that this incorporation provides better long term stability under light soaking of the sensitizer45,96 and often leads to panchromatic absorption.45 The incorporation of electron withdrawing units to the sensitizer structure has been critical for the increment of stability96 of indoline dyes as a result of a beneficial electron distribution between indoline and those units.100 Zu et al.96 obtained a PCE of 9.04% for indoline Dye 29 which incorporates a benzothiadiazole unit in the π-bridge. More importantly, this dye has demonstrated stability for 500 h in combination with an ionic liquid based redox shuttle. High efficiencies using this additional acceptor have also been obtained in fluorene based triarylamine dyes like Dye 30 (8.19%).101 A very promising candidate as additional acceptor is diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP). The DPP is a highly absorbing moiety which can harvest photons up to 1000 nm in wavelength,102 and exhibits good photostability.103 Work in this direction was made by Qu et al.,96,104,105 who reported the use of DPP core in D–A–π–A dyes. They obtained 4.14% (ref. 104) PCE for TPA Dye 31 which incorporates a phenyl-DPP (PhDPP) core besides two benzene linker. It was observed that the introduction of the DPP core in the dye extended the absorption to a higher wavelength due to intramolecular charge transfer between the thiophene units and the DPP core and also due to the highly absorbing nature of DPP. The PCE was prompted to 7.43% (ref. 96) for Dye 32, by replacing TPA with indoline (taking advantage of its enhanced light harvesting properties), and introducing branched alkyl chains to the DPP moiety (to avoid aggregation and suppress recombination). Furan was used as π-conjugated linker and cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor moiety. A noteworthy feature of the different DPP dyes is that they exhibit an excellent long term stability, as the electron withdrawing properties of DPP help to stabilize the sensitizer.96 Structure–property relationships were carried out88 and analysis was made on what characteristics an ideal sensitizer based on DPP must fulfil. Various triphenylamine or diphenylamine-based sensitizers in which cyanoacrylic acid is used to bind to TiO2 surface, and either a thiophene-DPP or a phenyl-DPP core was incorporated to the molecular structure were compared. It was observed that the IPCE response can be significantly improved by the rational design of this core. A PCE of 5% (ref. 106) was reported for TPA Dye 33 with a symmetric thienyl-diketopyrrolopyrole unit. Taking into account the results obtained in this study and the results obtained by Qu et al.96 with a phenyl-DPP sensitizer, they further improved the PCE to 7.7% with the use of Dye 34.102 This new dye holds an asymmetric DPP bridge/core, with a thienyl group which was utilized in conjugation with the donor, and a phenyl group used in conjugation with the acceptor. Despite the observed hypsochromic shift in the spectral response with respect to Dye 33 (750 nm and close to 800 nm respectively), they concluded that the use of an asymmetric DPP/bridge core led to a much higher IPCE (over 80% across the visible region) and as a result to a better PCE.
2.3. Acceptor/anchors in D–π–A dyes
In comparison to donors and bridges, there are few reports focused on the search for a suitable acceptor/anchor for D–π–A dyes. The anchoring group is mainly responsible for two important characteristics which determine the functioning of the dye: the long-term stability (affected by the binding energy of the dye on semiconductor surface) and the injection efficiency (through mediating electron transfer from the chromophore to the semiconductor). Some acceptors which have been used in D–π–A dyes are cyanoacrylic acid,51,95 rhodamine-thiazolidinorhodamine-N-carboxylic acid,107 carboxylic acid55 and pyridine. Cyanoacrylic acid is the highly employed acceptor and anchoring group in the dye, as discussed in the previous section.108 It possesses both wide absorption spectra in the visible region and better electron injection efficiency, and several groups have put forward its performance when compared to other acceptor/anchoring groups. Chen et al.109 attributed this enhanced performance to a more red shift of the absorption band caused by favorable conjugation with the presence of the electron acceptor cyano group. Apart from the chemical nature of the acceptor/anchor, the mode of the attachment of the dye to the surface determines to a great extent the final performance of the devices. Authors110 systematically studied how this mode of attachment is related to recombination in the cells, comparing similar TPA dyes with two different acceptors groups, Dye 35a with cyanoacetic acid (which adopts a standing adsorption mode) and Dye 35b with rhodanine-3-acetic (which lies along the surface). They found that rhodanine exhibited an enhanced charge recombination due to the low surface coverage resulting less blocking efficiency of the dye layer between triidodide (I3−) and TiO2.110 An important contribution in the search of suitable electron acceptors was carried out by Huan, Tian et al.111 who obtained PCE of 7.11% with Dye 36, which incorporates the novel electron acceptor 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine. The reported PCE was higher than for a dye with a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, and additionally Dye 36 exhibited long-term stability. Grätzel et al.112,113 synthesized TPA organic dyes with EDOT as π-spacer and various benzoic acid derivatives as acceptor/anchoring groups. The introduction of benzoic acid as acceptor was expected to extend the π-conjugation and to promote the planarity of the whole molecule.113 It was also observed that the nature and position of the substituents on the benzoic acid influence to a great extent the electronic properties of the dyes. For example, they found that the introduction of an acetylene bond on the benzoic acid anchoring part produces red-shift absorption, although to a minor extent than when a cyano group is added. It was also observed that the position of the cyano substituent on the benzoic acid influences the spectral properties of the dye and its final performance. The best PCE of 4.5% was obtained for Dye 37 with a para-cyano benzoic acid as the acceptor/anchoring group. A new type of D–π–A dyes was synthesized with a pyridine ring as anchoring group and was compared with dyes with carboxyl groups by Harima et al.81,114 It was found that the presence of pyridine has a positive effect on the electron injection of the dye. The authors attributed this to the better electronic communication aroused from the formation of coordinate bonding between the pyridine ring and the Lewis acid sites of TiO2 surface, which is more favorable than the formation of an ester linkage between the dyes with a carboxyl anchoring group and the Brønsted acid sites of the TiO2 surface. In a recent work Nazeeruddin et al.115 pointed out that E(S+/S*) of the sensitizer can be modulated by the proper selection of a nitrogen heterocycle as the acceptor for metal-free D–π–A dyes. They compared different nitrogen heterocycles (pyridine, quinoline, pyrazine and quinoxoline) for a triarylamine based dye with a CPDT linker. The best PCE of 6.55% was obtained for Dye 38 with a pyrazine acceptor. As an important feature of this acceptor, they remark the lower withdrawing strength of pyrazine with respect to cyanoacrylate, which is especially interesting for π-bridge chromophores where E(S+/S*) is already too low for the addition of a strong electronic withdrawn like cyanoacrylate.
Molecular engineering strategies summarized as above leads to the optimization of the dye performance in the majority of the cases, but it is not always clear what will be the most appropriate strategy to follow in order to obtain competitive PCE. For example, extending the π-conjugation length not always leads to an improvement in the PCE.70 Hagfeldt et al.116 demonstrated that the expansion of the π-conjugated system by increasing the number of electron rich units could lead to higher recombination rates due to halogen bonding between iodide and those electron rich units. In addition, long side chains may lead to lower dye adsorption and thus be responsible for lower Jsc.75 The simple architect Dye 39 (PCE ∼ 9.1%)117 shows that not always a higher complexity leads to the better efficiencies and thus a rational design may lead to a dye to die for (Table 1).

3. Metal-free counter electrode based on carbon materials
3.1. Carbon films as an alternative to transparent conducting oxides
The electrodes of DSSCs are often fabricated from conducting transparent oxides (TCO), such as fluorine doped tin oxide SnO2:F (FTO) or indium-tin oxide (ITO) serving as current collectors. It should be noted that ITO is not ‘indium doped tin oxide’, as sometimes presented, but a solid solution of SnO2 and In2O3 containing typically ≈90% In2O3. The TCOs are used for fabrication of both photoanode and the counter electrode (cathode), and contribute considerably to the cost of DSSCs. At least one of the DSSC electrodes must be optically transparent for solar radiation, but the optical transparency of the complete device is of added value for certain applications, as for windows, roof panels, decorative indoor installations etc.119,120 Furthermore, the optical transmission of a cathode is mandatory for certain DSSCs which cannot be illuminated from the photoanode side. This is typical for plastic solar cells, in which the photoanode current collector is usually made from thin non-transparent foil of Ti metal or stainless steel.119,120 Also the so-called tandem DSSCs require an optically transparent counter electrode.119,120
The photoanode has been a subject of intense investigations ranging from single crystals121,122 to tailored nanostructures,119,123 on the contrary counter electrode was studied less extensively. The TCO materials offer excellent electrical conductivity (sheet resistance Rs < 10 Ω sq−1) and optical transparency >80% for the visible light. Furthermore, there is only a small offset between the TiO2 conduction band edge (−4.2 eV) and the work function of ITO (4.7 eV) or FTO (4.4 eV).124,125 The search for carbon-based materials as an alternative of TCO coatings was encouraged by the work of Wu et al.126 and Zhang et al.127 on single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT), respectively. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) represent ideal nanowires for electron transport, due to its ballistic properties, i.e. an electron is not scattered in the solid over a long distance. CNT as thin films, have synergistic properties of electrical conductivity and optical transparency, although the parameters of TCO are not easy to reach. The state-of-the-art CNT films offer typically Rs ≈ 200 Ω sq−1 at T550 = 0.8, but they exhibit better mechanical properties. This is paramount for flexible solar cells fabrication. The fabrication, properties and applications of CNT thin films were reviewed by Hu et al.128
Another alternative material as a replacement for TCO coating is two dimensional carbon based material called graphene.129,130 Similar to CNT, it has attractive features such as high mobility for electrons and holes associated with the theoretical optical transmittance of 97.7% for a perfect, defect-free graphene. Its high mechanical stability predetermines graphene for a flexible current collector and DSSCs.129–133 Practically useful are films made from reduced graphene oxide.129,130,134 However, the so-far achieved sheet resistances are typically between 1 and 0.1 kΩ sq−1. The calculated work function of graphene (4.42 eV) is comparable to FTO (4.4 eV),124 while the work function of MWNT sheets is ∼5.2 eV.127
There are different requirements for TCO replacements in photoanode and cathode for PV fabrication. In the TCO-supported TiO2 photoanode, the direct contact of TCO with redox shuttle (in liquid junction DSSCs) or with hole conductor (in solid state-DSSCs) has to be avoided, usually by the use of a thin layer of compact titania, to minimize recombination. This condition is even more significant when carbon-based electrodes are used for replacement of TCO. It can be possibly due to the relatively high electrocatalytic activity of carbon for the I3−/I− redox shuttle, and even larger for the Co3+/Co2+ and T2/T− redox shuttle (see section 3.3). Hence, the recombination reaction can be faster in TCO-free photoanode if the naked carbon surface is in contact with the redox shuttle. Contrary to this, there are reports in which thin film of graphene current collector was reported to be acting as a recombination-blocking layer, performing even better than the compact TiO2 layer made by hydrolysis of TiCl4.135 Flexible DSSCs on plastic substrates using low-temperature printing techniques to be used as both photo-anode and counter electrode were evaluated and it was found that a polymer based cathode works also as carrier transport-rectifying material for use in solidification of electrolyte in combination with carbon materials.136
Fibril type DSSCs using all-carbon electrode as both the photoanode and the cathode were fabricated for potential applications in woven electronics. The fibrous photoanode has a core–shell structure, in which the carbon fiber core acts as a conductive substrate to collect carriers and sensitized porous TiO2 film as a shell to harvest light effectively, while the cathode was made from coatings of carbon ink on carbon fiber substrate. A modest PCE of 1.9% can be reached by proper engineering of the photoanode but these preliminary results were obtained without the use of TCOs or metals electrode, and are bio-friendly and flexibile.137

3.1.1. Photoanode current collector. 
There are only few reports on carbon-based current collector as photoanode, which relates to the problem of the recombination discussed above. Müllen et al.124 studied the use of graphene in solid-state DSSC with spiro-OMeTAD as a hole conductor. Due to lower conductivity and optical transparency of the graphene used, the PCE was lower by a factor of three than that of FTO based cells.124 Nanocarbons were too used for fabrication of transparent conductive grids, instead of compact thin films. Chen et al.138 employed long fibers made of aligned CNTs on which a layer of TiO2 nanoparticles was deposited. The fiber-shaped photoanode was intertwined with another fiber from pure nanotubes acting as the counter electrode. This DSSC can be fabricated in the form of photoactive textiles with a variety of potentially attractive applications in portable devices, such as in clothing-integrated solar cells. However, the PCE of ‘textile-like’ solar cells is still much lower (2.94%) than the FTO-supported TiO2 based DSSCs (∼10%). In a similar work, Guo et al.139 grew TiO2 (rutile) nanorods on top of carbon fiber substrate, but their DSSC exhibited quite low PCE.
Small amounts (ca. 0.5 wt%) of carbons, such as graphite, SWNT or graphene are also incorporated directly in the TiO2 electrode. Their role is to act as an electron-transporting scaffold improving the electron collection, but TCO remains the current collector.125,140–143 Mixing carbon with TiO2 promotes competitive recombination of electrons with electrolyte acceptors (I3−, Co3+ or T2). Furthermore, the formation of Schottky barrier, ΦB at the carbon/TiO2 contact further influences the electron transport.144 ΦB = Wm − χ(1)Wm is the work function of the supporting material (Wm ≈ 4.4 eV for FTO or ≈ 4.6–5.2 eV for CNT127,144,145 and χ is the electron affinity of TiO2 (χ ≈ 4.2 eV). Consequently, the height of the Schottky barrier is only 0.2 eV for TiO2/FTO interface but up to ≈ 1.0 eV for TiO2/SWNT interface. SWNTs are mixtures of metallic and semiconducting tubes, and they are usually bundled, which affects their electronic and electrochemical properties.146,147 Bundling of SWNT and the presence of metallic tubes is detrimental for the photoanode performance, but a small amount (0.2 wt%) of semiconducting SWNT in TiO2 enhances the photocurrent.148 Similarly, small amounts (≈0.6 wt%) of graphene loading in TiO2 caused notable improvement, in some cases better than SWNT.143 In addition to electronic effects,125,149 also light scattering was assumed to be responsible for improved light harvesting.143,150 Eventually it was found that graphene oxide (0.8 wt%) in TiO2 is beneficial for enhancement of the mechanical stability of titania film.151


3.1.2. Cathode current collector. 
The application of carbon materials for cathode current collector is a straightforward task, particularly if optical transmission is not a prerequisite. In this case graphite-like carbons, such as carbon black, might provide the desired electrical sheet resistance (Rs < 20 Ω sq−1) and the electrocatalytic activity for redox shuttle turnover (RCT < 3 Ω cm2; see section 4) even without the aid of Pt.152 This work was pioneered in 1996 by Kay and Grätzel,153 and further extended by the same group,12,154,155 but FTO remains as the auxiliary current collector. One of the early demonstrations of non-transparent and FTO-free counter electrodes was the SWNT film deposited on a Teflon membrane filter supported by glass which provided Rs = 1.8 Ω sq−1 and a reasonable PCE of 4.5%.156 An example of TCO-free cathode is the woven carbon nanotube fiber mat discussed above.138 A conceptually analogous device used woven fabric from CNT yarn, which was interfaced to a Ti wire photoanode coated with CdSe.157 An interesting example of TCO-free cathode is the graphite film modified by large-effective-surface-area polyaromatic hydrocarbon (LPAH).158 This material was grown in hydrogen arc discharge, used for the synthesis of nanotubes.
Graphene was also exploited for application in TCO-free, plastic cathode made on polyethylene terephtalate (PET) support. For this purpose, graphene was synthesized using chemical vapor deposition and Cu catalyst, but to further improve the mechanical and electrical properties, graphene was over coated with a layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) [PEDOT].159 In this example of Pt- and TCO-free electrode, the PEDOT takes over the catalytic function while graphene enhances the electron transport, i.e. decreases the sheet resistance of the cathode. The performance of solar cell with PET/graphene/PEDOT was similar to that with ITO/Pt and was outperforming that of pure PEDOT. Recently, all-plastic cathode was also prepared by electrodepositing PEDOT on PET/PEDOT substrates and PCE of up to 7% was obtained.160

3.2. Carbons as an alternative to Pt cathode electrocatalyst

3.2.1 Redox reactions at the cathode. 
Until recently, the I3−/I− redox shuttle was used almost exclusively in all types of liquid-junction DSSCs.161 The main motivation of replacing I3−/I− by another redox pair consists in the possible enhancement of the open circuit potential, VOC in DSSC. The VOC is defined by a difference between the quasi-Fermi level in the TiO2 photoanode (EF/q; where q is the elementary charge) and the energy level equivalent to the redox potential of the shuttle, Wredox. Assuming a defect-free semiconductor, the VOC is given by:116 (2)

E
CB is the energy of the conduction band edge, k is the Boltzman constant, nph is the number of photoelectrons in TiO2, NCB is the total number of conduction band states in TiO2. Hence, the VOC can be enhanced either by (i) upshift of ECB or by (ii) downshift of Wredox (this means enhancement of the mediator's redox potential, E0). In the first case, the available shifts in band energetics are limited to tens to hundreds of meV through engineering of the TiO2 structure162 or by additives like 4-tert-butylpyridine or Li+.119,120 The engineering of mediator's Wredox is theoretically limited only by the electrochemical potential of the dye's ground state, which is typically near 1–1.5 V vs. SHE, but small over potential (≈0.1 to 0.2 V) is required as a driving force for dye regeneration.18,119,120,163
Considering this, I3−/I− redox shuttle is certainly not the best mediator for DSSC, as its standard redox potential, E0 ≈ 0.35 V is too small for the usual dye, leaving ≈0.7 V overvoltage for dye regeneration.11,161,164–167 The complex redox chemistry of I3−/I− should also be taken into account.166,167 There are several other iodine-free redox shuttles164,165 with more positive redox potentials, such as ferrocene/ferrocenium, Fc/Fc+ (E0 = 0.62 V) which demonstrated PCE of 7.5% in DSSC.168 Recently, Co-polypyridine complexes, coupled with donor–bridge–acceptor sensitizers, turned out to be particularly promising.11,18,23,33,79,161,165,169–174 The Co-mediators were first introduced by Nusbaumer et al.,20 but they gave quite low PCE at that time (2.2% at AM 1.5G illumination),20 due to fast recombination of TiO2-conduction band electrons with Co(III). However, these Co-mediators were revitalized in 2010 by the seminal work of Feldt et al.79 followed by Yella et al.23 who demonstrated a record performance with PCE of 12.3% using the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox shuttle (Scheme 1). Almost all works on Co-mediated DSSCs have dealt with the traditional solar cell architecture with TiO2 photoanode. However, the Co-mediators can be also used in a reverse device with a sensitized semiconductor photocathode, an example is p-doped nickel oxide, NiO.175
 Scheme 1  Structural formula of two Co-polypyridine complexes used as a redox shuttle in DSSCs: [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ and [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+. where bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine and bpy-pz is 6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine. 
Another iodine-free redox shuttle is disulfide/thiolate (T2/T−; where T− is 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole and T2 its dimer, i.e. bis(1-methyltetrazol-5-yl) disulfide) introduced by Grätzel et al.176 (Scheme 2). It yielded PCE of 6.4% in DSSC, which was the record value in an iodine-free system at that time.176 Subsequently, a PCE of 7.9% was reported for a similar DSSC employing PEDOT as the counter electrode.19 The T2/T− redox couple is a member of a larger family of similar organosulfur compounds based on disulfide, polysulfides, thiourea, cysteine etc. which were also tested in DSSCs but the T2/T− is a generic redox shuttle exhibiting better performance in various systems.19,164,165,169,177 Since the redox potential of T2/T− is close to that of I3−/I−, one cannot expect further improvement in DSSC voltage. However, this redox shuttle avoids two problems of I3−/I−: (i) corrosion of silver contacts in DSSCs and (ii) optical losses caused by light absorption in the electrolyte solution.176
 Scheme 2  Structural formula of T−: 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazol and T2: bis(1-methyltetrazol-5-yl) disulfide. 

Eqn (3)–(5) summarize the corresponding redox reactions of the four most important redox shuttle used in liquid-junction DSSC: I3− + 2e− → 3I−; E0 = 0.35 V(3) [Co(bpy)3]3+ + e− → [Co(bpy)3]2+; E0 = 0.56 V(4a) [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+ + e− → [Co(bpy-pz)2]2+; E0 = 0.86 V(4b) T2 + 2e− → 2T−; E0 ≈ 0.4–0.5 V(5)


3.2.2 Cathode electrocatalyst. 
The cathode (counter electrode) in liquid-junction DSSCs serves for the reduction of the oxidized state of the redox shuttle (I3−, Co3+ or T2, see eqn (3)–(5)). The latter is created by the reaction with an oxidized dye near the photoanode (dye regeneration). To accelerate electrochemical charge transfer reactions (eqn (3)–(5)), the TCO surface should be modified, typically by platinum which is a fairly good electrocatalyst for all three systems. The amount of Pt deposited on top of TCO is ≈10 μg cm−2, which does not influence much the optical transmission of the TCO support. For this, a thin layer of platinum is thermally deposited on TCO substrates (platinized cathode), is the ideal electrode, particularly for I− mediated DSSCs, where it meets all the benchmark requirements, i.e. high electrical conductivity, high optical transparency and high electrocatalytic activity. Also the Co-mediated DSSC, including the champion (12.3%) cell23 still uses a platinized cathode1,18,23,79,170–172,178 but conducting polymers (PEDOT or PProDOT)11,18,33,169 deposited on TCO gave promising results. Nevertheless, Pt, FTO and ITO are problematic due to their high cost and limited natural abundance of In and Pt, which motivates the search for cheaper alternatives, such as carbons.179–181 In general, electrocatalysis on a carbon surface is assumed to proceed via ‘defects’ and ‘carbon-oxygen surface functionalities’, albeit the catalytic sites were never clearly identified, and the subject is quite contradictory with many opposing claims.179–183 For instance, the traditional picture of a low electrocatalytic activity of the graphite's basal plane, as compared to that of edge planes, was recently questioned by Lai et al.182
The required rate of a redox shuttle reduction should be comparable to the rate of dye regeneration at the photoanode. This is given by the flux of electrons from the photoexcited dye to the conduction band of TiO2, and is expressed by the photocurrent density, Jsc. Currently, in state of the art DSSCs, it can achieve Jsc ≈ 20 mA cm−2 at full sun (AM 1.5G) illumination. The exchange current density, j0 should be, therefore, comparable to Jsc to avoid losses at the counter electrode. The exchange current density is expressed as follows: (6)
where R is the gas constant, T is temperature, n is the number of electrons, F is the Faraday constant, RCT is the charge-transfer resistance, k0 is the formal (conditional) rate constant of the electrode reaction, cox and cred are concentrations of oxidized and reduced shuttle, respectively and α is the charge-transfer coefficient (α ≈ 0.5). The rate constant, k0 is assumed at equilibrium conditions, i.e. the rates of the anodic reaction and cathodic reactions are identical. Experimental determination of RCT is most conveniently carried out using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on a model system, the so called dummy cell, which mimics the geometry of the DSSC. This approach was pioneered by Papageorgiou et al.184 and Hauch and Georg,185 who studied the platinized cathode and by Murakami and Grätzel,154,155 who studied the carbon black/TiO2@FTO electrode.
Considering Jsc = j0 = 20 mA cm−2, then eqn (6) predicts the ‘ideal’ value of RCT to be 1.3 Ω cm2. Such charge transfer resistance can be reached for I3−/I− on a platinized cathode.154,185,186 However other authors proposed different benchmark parameters for improved DSSC performance: RCT < 10 Ω cm2 was suggested by Hauch and Georg185 and RCT from 2 to 3 Ω cm2 was suggested by Trancik et al.152 For ideal DSSCs cathode 80% optical transparency at a wavelength of 550 nm, (T550 > 0.8) and sheet resistance, Rs of 20 Ω sq−1 was seen as benchmark parameters.152 Such an electrode would, eventually, replace the platinized cathode, but it is tricky to achieve all three parameters at the same time. For instance, an all-carbon cathode can be fabricated with the required RCT and Rs, but non-transparent (T550 parameter not achieved). Another strategy can be the use of FTO support, but with replacement of Pt by a cheap and abundant electrocatalyst. In this way, we can achieve all the required benchmark parameters RCT, Rs, and T550. This strategy is popular in testing various alternative electrocatalysts, such as carbons, conducting polymers or inorganic materials. But the designing of optically transparent, highly conductive and electrocatalytically active Pt- and TCO-free cathode is still a challenge.
For highly porous electrodes, like carbons, the determination of RCT from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) might be underestimated by neglecting Nernst diffusion impedance in pores of the electrode material.187 To account for these effects, the so called effective charge transfer resistance, CT was introduced:187 CT = RCT + Npore(7)
As many authors ignored Npore, their reported charge transfer resistances are rather the CT values according to this equation. Secondly, the charge-transfer resistances are often normalized to geometric electrode area but not to the total physical area of the electrode material, determined, e.g. from the adsorption isotherms (BET).154,155 These two problems should be taken into account in screening of literature data about the electrocatalytic activity of carbon electrodes.

3.3. Overview of solar cells with carbon cathodes

Table 2 compiles several representative examples of DSSCs with carbon-based counter electrodes. Most of these carbons were deposited on FTO, which served as an auxiliary current collector (exceptions are noted in Table 2). The electrocatalytic activity is characterized by the charge transfer resistances, RCT. Although the individual source references sometimes do not mention this, we assume that all these values are normalized to the geometric electrode area and not to the physical area of the carbon surface (see section 3.2.2). Second, the quoted RCT should be better considered as CT (cf.eqn (7)).

The values of PCE, are quoted for full sun (AM 1.5G) illumination. Wherever possible, the performance of DSSC with carbon-based cathode, was compared to the performance of DSSC with a standard platinized cathode, PCEPt. Table 2 illustrates the fact that carbons are usually (i) less effective than Pt in I-mediated DSSCs, (ii) of comparable performance in Co-mediated DSSCs and (iii) considerably better for disulfide/thiolate-mediated DSSCs.

3.3.1. I-mediated DSSC. 
The electrocatalytic activity of a platinized cathode for the I3−/I− redox reaction, along with its high optical transparency is difficult to achieve by alternative materials, including carbons (Table 2).12,155,164,186,188,189 The palette of alternative non-carbon materials comprises conducting polymers,13,190,191 polymer/Pt or polymer/carbon composites192 (for review see ref. 155) and various inorganic materials like Au, Cu2S and RuO2,12,184,193 surface-nitrided nickel,194 CoS,195 Co0.85Se,196 carbides, nitrides and oxides of various transition metals.197,198
Kay and Grätzel153 pioneered the use of graphite and carbon black for this purpose. Subsequently, various kinds of carbon were studied by others, such as hard carbon spherules,199 activated carbon,200 colloidal graphite,201 carbon black,202 mesoporous carbon,203,204 nanocarbon,205 nanotube-nanofiber composite,206 graphene,188,204,207–213 nitrogen-doped graphene,214 MoS2–graphene composite,215 Pt–reduced graphene oxide composite,216 graphene–activated carbon composite,217 graphene/polymer composites,192,218 single-walled carbon nanotubes156,219 multi-walled carbon nanotubes,219–223 N-doped nanotubes,224 electrospun nanofibers225 and carbon black/TiO2 composite.154 MWNT were also assembled in composites with conducting polymer220 and TiN226 (the presence of TiN requires further proof, due to possible mismatch of TiN with titanium oxynitrides).227 TiN was also assembled with carbon nanotubes and graphene.228 Screening of nine different carbon materials, i.e. mesoporous carbon, activated carbon, carbon black, conductive carbon, carbon dye, carbon fiber, CNT, discarded printer toner and fullerene (C60) confirmed that activity approaching that of Pt is ultimately accessible for certain carbons.229 Promising activity similar to that of Pt was also found for MWNT cathodes.152,222,223,230 Occasionally, semitransparent MWNT film was used in DSSC with PCE of 7.59%.221
Bulk defect-free graphene has low catalytic activity for I3− reduction,152,154,155 but it is improved in small graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), made, e.g. by thermal annealing of GO.187,208,209 Roy-Mayhew et al.187 reported on functionalized graphene sheets (FGS), which seem to be close to reduced graphene oxide fabricated by thermal treatment. The catalytic activity of FGS correlated with the amount of oxygen in a carbonaceous skeleton, until a certain limit, when the electrical conductivity became performance-controlling.187 The studies of various other graphene cathodes for I-mediated DSSC confirmed that performance comparable to a platinized cathode is hard to achieve158,207,212,229,231–237 (for review of graphene counter electrodes in I-mediated DSSCs see ref. 213). Presumably, the best parameters were reported recently for hierarchical vertically oriented graphene grown on top of stainless steel substrate by a plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) process. This material exhibited RCT = 0.0073 Ω cm2, which is the lowest ever reported value for I3−/I− redox shuttle.238 It is two orders of magnitude smaller than the control value for a platinized cathode, but the performance of the corresponding solar cell was slightly improved (see also Table 2).238 On the other hand, the material coded ERGO (ERGO = electrochemically reduced graphene oxide decorated with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) provided RCT ≈ 1, but excellent PCE = 9.5%, outperforming the efficiency of the reference device with Pt@FTO.239
There are few reports presenting optically transparent graphene-based cathodes188,210,215,218,235,236 or CNT cathodes.224 A systematic work was carried out with GNP deposited on FTO.188 The GNP is a commercial product consisting of several sheets of graphene with an overall thickness of approximately 5 nm (ranging from 1 to 15 nm) and particle diameters less than 2 μm. Velten et al.240 reported on a reversible photo induced bleaching of the I3−/I− redox shuttle specifically in contact with the few-layer graphene nanoribbons.
An example of I-mediated DSSC with transparent GNO@FTO cathode is demonstrated in Fig. 3, right chart. Here, the devices gave 5% and 6.89% PCE for GNP@FTO and platinized cathode, respectively. The main problem in these cells was the large RCT = 308 Ω cm2 of the cathode, which is responsible for the poor performance at potentials near VOC.188

Interestingly, the electrocatalytic activity of GNP@FTO for the I3−/I− redox reaction was considerably better in the electrolyte based on ionic liquid, as compared to that in the traditional electrolyte solution in an organic solvent. The latter solution (Z946) was 1 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide + 0.15 M iodine + 0.5 M N-butylbenzoimidazole + 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate in 3-methoxypropionitrile. The alternative ionic liquid medium (coded Z952) was: 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide + 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide + 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate + iodine + N-butylbenzoimidazole + guanidinium thiocyanate (molar ratio 12/12/16/1.67/3.33/0.67). The electrocatalytic activity, quantified as j0 or 1/RCT, (cf.eqn (6)) was found to be larger by a factor of about 5–6 for the Z952 redox shuttle compared to that for the Z946 electrolyte.188 The calculation of cox1−αcredα (cf.eqn (6)) using the actual redox shuttle compositions mentioned above, gives the ratio of exchange currents in Z952/Z946 to be 1.75 only. Hence, the found factor of 5–6 enhancement of j0 in Z952 is not a simple concentration effect.188 A similar improvement in the solvent-free redox shuttle was found also for another carbonaceous material, LPAH.158
LPAH is a ‘large-effective-surface-area polyaromatic hydrocarbon’; it was used by Lee et al.158 for construction of ‘truly’ carbonaceous (that is without FTO) cathode for DSSCs. The material is grown in soot from hydrogen arc discharge, which is also applied for the synthesis of nanotubes. This cathode exhibited excellent performance in I-mediated DSSCs with plastic electrolyte. Although it was not clearly specified in the cited paper158 what is meant by ‘plastic electrolyte’, one can assume that N-methyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium iodide doped succinonitrile plastic crystal was used. The corresponding DSSCs exhibited PCEs of 8.63% and 7.15%, for LPAH@graphite and platinized cathode respectively. Surprisingly, the LPAH@FTO provided only 7.50% at the same conditions.158 Besides pure graphene, also composites of graphene-based materials with conducting polymers were tested as catalytic counter electrodes in DSSC;241 for recent review see ref. 218. Due to the high conductivity, electrochemical stability and high catalytic activity, polythiophenes can replace platinized cathodes in DSSCs.242,243 The product PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P) is an aqueous dispersion thus its long term stability is debatable and further it can trap electrons. By the use of electropolymerized PEDOT in ionic liquids medium we have achieved >10% PCE.13,190
PEDOT nanotube arrays were synthesized and it was shown that they exhibit a better catalytic activity with I−/I3− redox than standard platinized counter electrodes and yielded a PCE of 8.3%. It was urged that the PEDOT nanotubes introduce an additional series resistance but it is compensated by their excellent catalytic performance.244 PEDOT-nanofibers of 10–50 nm in diameters were prepared by chemical oxidative method within micelles composed of sodium dodecyl sulfate as nanoreactors. Further to homogenizing the dispersion, dimethyl sulfoxide (5 wt%) was added to a methanol-based colloidal dispersion containing PEDOT-nanofibers and was spin coated on TCO substrates. The fabricated DSSCs using PEDOT-nanofibers gave enhanced PCE of 9.2% as compared to bulk PEDOT (6.8%) and with a platinized cathode (8.6%). Nanofibers efficiently reduced triiodide due to its better electrical and morphological properties.245 A poly(3,3-diethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno-[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine) (PProDOT-Et2) counter electrode was incorporated in a plastic DSSC as a substitution for the platinized cathode. The devices fabricated with a PProDOT-Et2 counter electrode showed a slightly higher PCE of 5.20% as compared with sputtered platinized cathode (5.11%). The high surface area was attributed to the increase in the catalytic properties of PProDOT-Et2 for I3− reduction.246 Ho et al. scrutinized the catalytic activities of different thiophene family polymers PEDOT, PProDOT, and PProDOT-Et2. Device fabricated with PProDOT-Et2 counter electrode yielded a PCE of 7.88%, which when compared in that case was higher than that of PEDOT (3.93%) and PProDOT 7.08%.247 Nanocomposites based on inorganic/organic counter electrodes comprised of sheet like CoS nanoparticles dispersed in polystyrenesulfonate-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (CoS/PEDOT:PSS) were also exploited for catalytic performance but the PCE was confined to 5.4% which was even lower than a platinized cathode (6.1%).248 Composites of graphene with PEDOT:PSS were also used to improve the performance of counter electrodes of DSSCs. The spin coated composite film on ITO substrate resulted in a PCE of 4.5%.192 By using a layer-by-layer self-assembly method PEDOT–PSS, film was made and it was further modified by using carbon black. A modest PCE of 4.71% was achieved, which was slightly lower (8%) than that of the cell using a conventional platinized cathode.249
Electropolymerized polyaniline (PANI) with various counter ions, were deposited and it was found that PANI doped by SO42− anion film gives a porous morphology and higher reduction current for the reduction of I3−. The low charge transfer resistance of 1.3 Ω cm2 along with PCE of 5.6%, was obtained which is comparable to platinized cathode (6.0%).250
Transparent and uniform PANI films were employed to fabricate bifacially active transparent DSSC, which showed PCE of 6.54 and 4.26% in front- and rear-side illumination respectively, which was marginally lower than a platinized cathode (6.69%).251
Microporous PANI gave a PCE of 7.1%, but it is well known that PANI is not a material of choice due to its instability, self-oxidation and carcinogenic properties.252 Similarly, other members of conducting polymers, like polypyrrole nanoparticles (40 to 60 nm), were also used for counter electrode fabrication; these were synthesized using chemical polymerization in the presence of iodide. Though typically polypyrrole shows non porous, cauliflower like morphology, the obtained current density was high, pointing towards its catalytic activity which resulted in PCE of 7.66%, exceeding the platinized cathode (6.90%).253 Vapor-phase polymerization and electropolymerization techniques were used to synthesize polypyrrole, and to fabricate counter electrodes in DSSCs. It was observed that a vapor-phase polymerized film shows a lower and uniform particle size (100–150 nm) with respect to electropolymerized film (200–300 nm). The fabricated DSSCs using these electrodes yielded PCE of 3.4 and 3.2%, respectively, which was lower than a platinized cathode (4.4%).254 However vapor-phase polymerization is not a technique of choice due to non-uniform film deposition on a large area.


3.3.2. Cobalt complexes mediated DSSC. 
Most cobalt complexes mediated solar cells, including the champion (12.3%) cell23 employ a platinized cathode18,23,79,170–172 and also PEDOT or PProDOT were used to obtain better results.18,33,169 The application of a platinized cathode for Co-mediated DSSC is, nevertheless, quite debatable, due to the sluggish and irreversible electrochemistry of the Co3+/2+ redox shuttle consisting in a variety of bipyridine-, terpyridine-and phenanthroline ligands.178 Feldt et al.79 reported that the electrocatalytic activity of Pt (expressed as j0 or 1/RCT see eqn (6)) further decreased for Co-bipyridines with bulky substituents on the ligands. On the other hand, these complexes exhibit fast electrochemical kinetics on gold, graphite or glass-like carbon electrodes.178,255 Carbon (screen-printed) cathode was employed in Co-mediated DSSC for the first time by Ghamous et al.,255 but owing to the use of Ru–bipyridine sensitizers (N3 or Z907) the PCE was limited to 1.2%. The application of a graphene-based counter electrode for cobalt complexes mediated DSSC was pioneered by Kavan et al.174 The optically transparent GNP electrode turned out to be highly active for DSSC using [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2 mediator.174 The polymer based counter electrodes were then fine-tuned with the use of various dopants and were optimized for thickness and physico-chemical properties. Poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) [PProDOT] based DSSCs shows a better result due to their ultra-high surface area morphology and this will eliminate the possibility of forming any passivation layer at the electrode-electrolyte interface and has resulted in 20% higher PCE.169,256 The fabricated device with Y123-sensitized photoanode provided VOC over 1 V due to the high redox potential of this mediator. A parallel study of Yum et al.18 confirmed that VOC > 1 V can be achieved in these DSSCs independent of the counter electrode material (Pt, GNP or PProDOT).18,174
A comparative test of DSSCs with Dye 1 sensitized photoanodes gave 8.1 and 9.3% PCE for a platinized cathode and GNP@FTO, respectively.174 This finding is consistent with the found RCT values (cf.eqn (6)) of 4.7 Ω cm2 and 0.7 Ω cm2 for the used platinized cathode and GNP@FTO cathodes respectively.174 An analogous comparison of a platinized cathode with PProDOT@FTO provided 9.52 and 10.08%, respectively.18 Again, this is consistent with the reported factor of 20 smaller RCT value (cf.eqn (6)) for the conductive polymer.18 Although the actual PCEs of the two reference cells with platinized cathode do not match due to the different properties of the photoanodes used,18,174 the favorable properties of both the Pt-free cathodes, i.e. graphene and PProDOT were confirmed. The cell with GNP@FTO cathode is outperforming that with a platinized cathode, particularly in fill factors and in the PCE at higher illumination intensities, but there is also a slight increase of the dark current for GNP-based device, which reduces PCE at lower light intensities and VOC.174 The [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ mediator was found to be extremely fast on the GNP electrode, with RCT ≈ 0.08 Ω cm2 for an electrode having T550 = 0.85. The devices with Dye 1-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox shuttle and GNP@FTO cathode have outperformed those with a platinized cathode in fill factors and PCE at higher illumination intensities.173Fig. 3 (right chart) shows the corresponding current–voltage characteristics at AM 1.5G illuminations. The improvement for GNP@FTO cathode is an obvious effect of the higher electrocatalytic activity (higher j0 or smaller RCT). However, there is again a marked increase of the dark current for the GNP-based device, found also for the [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ mediated DSSCs174 (see above). This dark current reduces the open-circuit voltage and efficiency (cf.Fig. 3) particularly at smaller light intensities.173,174
Higher dark current for GNP@FTO cathodes (cf.Fig. 3, right chart) is found also for [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+173 and I3−/I−188 redox shuttle. It was suggested233,257 that GNP detaching from the cathode might be transported through the electrolyte to TiO2 photoanode, where they deposit and subsequently catalyze the undesired recombination reactions. Al-Mamun et al.258 demonstrated a possibility of fabrication of FTO-free electrode based on graphene nanoplatelets. They combined GNP with silver nanowires, which themselves have poor electrocatalytic activity for [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+. Their fabricated DSSCs, however, provided PCE of around 1% only, which was, presumably caused by non-optimal selection of dye sensitizer (N719) and quite high sheet resistance of the composite electrode in ref. 258. Consequently, this electrode did not work well as compared to the platinized cathode. On the other hand, the composite of graphene with gold nanoparticles exhibited promising performance as counter electrode in Co-mediated DSSC, outperforming the activity of Pt electrodes.259
Graphene oxide (GO) can act as a surfactant for dissolving CNT and nanotubes/fullerene-C60 mixtures182 and also GNP in water.257 The solution-processable films deposited on FTO glass from GO or GO/GNP, are robust and wear-resistant, due to an intimate interaction of hydrophilic functionalities in GO with the hydroxylated surface of FTO. The films from pure GO are not very active catalytically, but they can be activated either by chemical reduction with hydrazine (rGO) or by simple calcination in inert atmosphere (GO-HT).257 The latter treatment resembles thermal activation of FGS-composites,233 and is also applicable for the activation of the GO/GNP composites.257
Films from GO-HT or GO/GNP electrodes showed good electrocatalytic activity for [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ with improved mechanical and electrochemical stability.257Fig. 4 displays data for the GO-HT cathode in DSSC with Dye 1-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes and [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ mediator.257 The solar cell shown in Fig. 4 provided at 0.095 sun the PCE of 10.1% and 10.0% for GO-HT and Pt, respectively. Analogously, at 1 sun illumination, the corresponding efficiencies were 8.8 and 9.0% for GO-HT and Pt, respectively (Fig. 4 and ref. 257).

The cathode is fabricated either from heat treated graphene oxide (GO-HT black curves) or Pt (blue curves). The GO-HT film had optical transmission of 86% at 550 nm wavelength.

Systematic screening of GO/GNP composites with varying T550 (total carbon loading) and varying GO/GNP ratios pointed at the optimum material containing 50 wt% of each GO and GNP components.257 An example thin-film electrode (T550 = 0.9) exhibited charge transfer resistance RCT1 = 0.23 Ω cm2 and RCT2 = 0.38 Ω cm2 which are the best values from all the GO/GNP composites. (Note that this composite shows two charge transfer resistances in series).257
The devices with GO-based cathodes do not show the enhanced dark current anymore, which was previously identified as one of the drawbacks of GNP-electrodes.173,174,188 Blocking of dark current in GO-HT based DSSCs is also visible in Fig. 4, if we compare it to Fig. 3. The decrease of the dark current can be explained by firm bonding of GO-based films to FTO, which prevents peeling of carbonaceous particles from the electrode support.173,233 The same effect is also responsible for slower aging of the GO-HT and GO/GNP referenced to the aging-induced loss of activity for pure GNP cathodes.173,174,257 Similarly, the composite of ca. 20% GNP with pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile showed good electrocatalytic activity with RCT ≈ 1 Ω cm2 for Co(bpy)33+/2+ and improved stability against that of pure GNP deposit on FTO.260 The DSSCs using this cathode had enhanced efficiency and fill factor as compared to those with platinized cathode.260


3.3.3. Sulfur-mediated DSSC. 
In contrast to I-mediated and Co-mediated systems, the carbon electrodes are significantly outperforming the activity of a platinized cathode in T2/T containing electrolyte solutions. The promising activity of graphite for this redox shuttle was first reported by Wu et al.177 They used simple commercial graphite in a thick layer (2 mm) and found considerably higher PCE and smaller RCT as compared to those for a platinized cathode. Interestingly, the same graphite film was very sluggish for the I3−/I− redox shuttle, exhibiting a 1/3 of PCE and three times higher RCT than the platinized cathode. Table 2 shows that various other carbonaceous materials consistently show better properties than Pt, if they are used as cathode in DSSC.
Roy-Mayhew et al.233 compared the activity of FGS electrode in T2/T containing electrolyte solution with two other model systems, i.e. I3−/I− and [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+. They further optimized the composition of their FGS electrode187 so that the binders (ethyl cellulose, Pluronic-type copolymers and polyethylene oxide) were only partially pyrolyzed at moderate temperatures leaving ca. 20 wt% of residuum.233 This residuum improved the structural stability and surface area of the composite, but has negligible catalytic activity.233Table 2 shows that the FGS composite is a versatile replacement of the platinized cathode in all these three model DSSCs providing: (i) identical performance (I-mediated DSSC, 6.8% vs. 6.8%) or (ii) slightly better performance (Co-mediated DSSC, 4.5% vs. 4.4%) or considerably better performance (S-mediated DSSC, 3.5 vs. 2.0%).233
Recently, Liu et al.261 tested hydrazine-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) mixed with carbon black as electrode material for a slightly different disulfide/thiolate couple than T2/T−. Their redox shuttle was 5-mercapto-1-ethyltetrazol/bis(1-ethyltetrazol-5-yl) disulfide, i.e. it was the ethyl-homologue of the T2/T− redox system. They found remarkable PCE of 6.55% (referenced to 3.22% for DSSC with platinized cathode). The highest so far reported efficiency (7.9%) of T2/T− mediated DSSC was observed in a cell with PEDOT.19

4. Concluding remarks and outlook
Dye sensitized solar cells are now regarded as a credible alternative to solid-state p–n junction devices. Particularly, their performance in diffuse light exhibits a competitive edge over the existing technology (silicon) to provide electrical power for portable electronic applications. Power conversion efficiencies of 13% have already been achieved on a laboratory scale with a single junction cell, but there is room for further improvement. It can be achieved by judicious molecular design, to allow new push pull chemistry, which can be predicted by quantum chemical calculations in sensitizers and will play a key role in fabricating outstanding devices. Research efforts need to be focused on panchromatic sensitizers, one-electron redox shuttle and cost effective yet efficient electrocatalyst to obtain around >18% efficiency under one sun illumination. For improved light harvesting while maintaining a high photovoltage, some strategies which can be adopted/considered are:
(i) the ground state oxidation potential of cobalt redox shuttle can be modulated to match energy level of the metal-free D–π–A sensitizers by rational design of polypyridyl ligands;
(ii) the spectral response of the D–π–A sensitizer can be modulated by incorporating novel donor and the acceptor anchoring groups such as benzothiadiazole functionalized anchor pyrazine and pyridine functionalized anchor;
(iii) the use of squaraine based sensitizer which displays an outstanding red-shifted absorption as well as high absorptivity (>10000 M−1 cm−1 in solution) over the visible spectrum and into the near-IR regions;
(iv) the induction of 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′] dithiophene (CPDT) communicating bridge between the squaraine and the cyanoacrylate anchor provides panchromatic absorbance as well as efficient charge separation;
(v) the unsymmetrical squaraine dyes containing N,N-bis(9,9-dimethylfluoren-2-yl)amino or bis(hexyloxyphenyl)amino unit, illustrates an extra new absorption band in the high energy region to give a panchromatic response;
(vi) the ullazine class of sensitizers gives an opportunity for an attractive number of π-conjugated sites for molecular engineering of novel sensitizers with benzothiadiazole functionalized anchoring groups. Its resonance structure assists to generate an electron-accepting center and an electron-donating aromatic periphery that will give efficient performance in DSSCs;
(vii) the bulky phenyl-alkoxy substituted triphenylamine donor based sensitizers shows that incorporating phenyl units on both the donor and acceptor moieties give higher power conversion efficiencies due to reduced recombination and aggregation;
(viii) rationally tailored asymmetric donor–chromophore–acceptor sensitizers based on diketopyrrolopyrrole bridge/core give desired “colores” and higher power conversion efficiencies.
On the cathode side, carbon based materials, particularly carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphene oxide and conducting polymers either pure or in composites can be used as a current collector and/or electrocatalyst. Graphene-based materials attracted a considerable interest for the catalytic counter electrode, particularly in the state of the art DSSC with a cobalt-based redox shuttle. Similarly, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) coated FTO glass when employed as a counter-electrode with a cobalt-based redox shuttle gives a better result than the platinized cathode. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) was found to drastically reduce the heterogeneous charge transfer resistance and mass transport related limitations of the photocurrent, resulting in superior power conversion efficiencies. The understanding of electrochemical charge-transfer at the carbon surface is a key to the optimization of these solar cells, but the mechanism of electrocatalysis on the carbon surface is still a subject of a conflicting debate.

Broader context
The requirement for a green and clean energy source is in global demand. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), are a front runner among new solar cell technologies owing to their low production cost and efficiency, which make them a promising alternative for certain applications. Recently DSSCs have exhibited over 13% power conversion efficiency at an AM 1.5 full sunlight irradiation, by employing a panchromatic porphyrin dye in conjugation with cobalt based redox shuttle. To aid the commercial application of DSSCs cost cutting and chemical stability is of immense interest. In this review article we provide an overview of the platinum group metal free sensitizers as well as counter electrode to further inspire the DSSCs community towards a new generation of cost effective DSSCs.
