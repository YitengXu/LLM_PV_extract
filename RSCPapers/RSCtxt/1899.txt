1. Introduction
The boom in the exploitation of renewable energy (e.g. solar, wind power, and geothermal energy) and electronic devices has stimulated great research interest for developing efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly electrochemical energy storage devices.1–10 With the impressive merits of high power density, ultra-long cycling life (up to 100000 cycles) and fast charging–discharging capability, supercapacitors (SCs) are emerging as an attractive energy storage device and widely used in hybrid vehicles, energy recovery, emergency power supply, etc.11–19 However, the energy density of the current SCs is still far from satisfactory for meeting the energy demand of next-generation electronics.
According to the energy density (E) equation of SCs (E = 0.5CV2, C is the capacitance and V is the voltage), boosting the device capacitance and voltage is an effective strategy to enhance their energy density.20–24 One of the most promising strategies to maximize the capacitance is to explore various nanomaterials with good conductivity and high electrochemical activity as SC electrodes.25–28 To date, a series of nanomaterials with specific architectures have been intensively reported as advanced electrodes for SCs, like carbon, metal oxides/nitrides and conductive polymers.25,29–36 Among these materials, carbonaceous matrices including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and porous carbon are receiving ever-increasing attention because of their superior conductivity, low cost, high surface area, excellent chemical stability and environmental friendliness.13,37–40 Yet, limited by their intrinsic electric double-layer (EDL) mechanism, the capacitance of these carbon nanomaterials is still utterly disappointing.41,42 To address this problem, numerous efforts have been made to improve the capacitive properties of these carbons, and several strategies have been proposed and demonstrated, including structural design, surface modification, and incorporation with pseudocapacitive materials.42–48
As an inexpensive carbon material, carbon cloth (CC) is composed of plentiful uniform carbon microfibers of 5–10 μm in diameter (Fig. 1). It is a highly conductive textile with a three-dimensional (3D) network, outstanding mechanical flexibility and chemical stability. These unique features endow it with great potential to work as a scaffold and current collector of flexible electrodes in energy harvesting and storage devices (Fig. 1a).39,49–54 In this regard, a variety of active materials (e.g. MnO2, MoOx, Co3O4 and TiN) were grown on CC and displayed good capacitive performance in flexible SCs.55–63 However, few efforts have been focused on the direct employment of CC as an electrode material in SCs because its intrinsic capacitance is typically less than 5 F g−1. This value is substantially smaller than that of other carbon materials with a high specific surface area or numerous pores, such as CNTs (100–350 F g−1) and graphene (200–550 F g−1).33,64–68 However, considering the promising application of CC in wearable or flexible electronic devices, which can hardly be achieved by other carbon matrix, it is highly pursued to develop effective strategies to dig out the latent potential of CC as SC electrodes. Delightfully, substantial achievements have been made in direct utilization of CC as a robust SC electrode in recent years.15,64,69–78 A comprehensive review on the design strategies of CC as a SC electrode is highly desirable and timely needed.

In this article, we first briefly commented on the merits and disadvantages of CC for high-performance SC assembly and its working principles are also introduced. Then, recent achievements in the capacitive enhancement of CC and its implementation in SCs have been summarized and discussed in detail. Smart strategies including chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, thermal activation, plasma modification and strain modulation are particularly highlighted, as shown in Scheme 1. Finally, we also overview the challenges and prospects of commercial CC as a state-of-the-art candidate for SC construction.

2. Carbon cloth in supercapacitors
2.1 Merits and disadvantages
Compared with other carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and activated carbon, the most appealing advantage of CC is its excellent mechanical strength with superior flexibility and mechanical integrity. Typically, CNTs or graphene based thin films are prepared by vacuum filtration, and these films still suffer from poor mechanical strength. In contrast, CC can be directly employed as a freestanding and flexible electrode for SCs, and it can also be integrated into small devices with a tiny size and a variety of shapes. These merits enable CC to be an ideal candidate for application in portable and wearable electronics. For instance, our group found that CC could bear a high tensile strength of 18.2 MPa. Harsh chemical etching and electrochemical activation processes had negligible influence on its mechanical properties (Fig. 2a and b).79 Yu et al. fabricated a high rate fiber-shaped SC based on activated CC, which could be woven into a dragonfly knot and sewed into a glove.80 More importantly, this fiber-shaped SC still maintained its high performance under different conditions of bending and knotting, indicative of its excellent weavability, knottablity, and flexibility (Fig. 2c and d). Moreover, CC also displays high conductivity and favourable chemical stability, which endows the CC electrode with high rate properties and long lifespan. Unfortunately, further applications of commercial CC in SCs are severely limited by its unsatisfactory capacitive properties that are initiated by its low specific surface area, poor porosity, insufficient electrolyte wettability and limited electrochemical activity.69,81 To achieve high energy and high power SCs simultaneously, it is imperative to develop effective methods to overcome these shortcomings.

2.2 Energy storage mechanism
The energy storage mechanism of CC is closely related to the EDL in SCs. Like those conventional two-plate capacitors, when a voltage bias is applied, two layers with opposite charge, separated by an atomic distance, are formed at the CC/electrolyte interface.82 Yet, the SCs with CC electrodes usually display superior capacity to conventional capacitors due to the large interfacial area of the carbon surface and the short atomic range of the charge separation distance. Early in the 19th century, this EDL mechanism was first proposed by Von Helmholtz and further modified by Gouy and Chapman by considering both cations and anions driven by thermal motion in the electrolyte, referring to the diffusion layer. Later in 1924, Stern integrated the above two models and definitely divided the EDL into two parts, the diffusion layer and the Stern layer (compact layer).83–85 The diffusion layer remained the same as Gouy and Chapman described while the Stern layer depicted strongly absorbed ions at the electrode surface. These two parts both contribute to the overall capacitance of SCs. That is, the Stern layer capacitance (CH) and the diffusion layer capacitance (Cdiff) together constitute the EDL capacitance (Cdl), as shown in the equations below:  
For CC electrodes with poriferous surfaces, the simulation of EDL behaviour becomes more complicated as the ion transportation is simultaneously affected by the tortuous transfer path, pore-inside spaces, wetting degree and so on. Therefore, electric double-cylinder capacitor (EDCC) and electric wire-in-cylinder capacitor (EWCC) models were proposed to estimate the energy storage ability of mesoporous and microporous surfaces, respectively.86 The capacitance simulation equations of EDCC and EWCC models are shown as follows:    where εr is the dielectric constant of the electrolyte, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, b is the pore radius, d is the distance of ions to the CC surface, a0 is the effective size of the counter ions, and A is the effective specific surface area of the electrode.
Besides the EDL energy storage, the functional groups (mainly the oxygen- or nitrogen-containing functional groups) grafted on the CC surface are able to initiate a fast faradic redox reaction, which results in the additional contribution of the pseudo-capacitance to the overall performance. Benefiting from the chemical energy storage process, CC electrodes with pseudo-capacitance usually provide larger energy density. As for oxygen-containing functional groups, –COH and –CO could transform into each other through the following reaction:87–COH + OH−  –CO + H2O + e−
However, the content increase of –COOH groups will only lead to the increase of charge transfer resistance and thus reduce the electrochemical performance. The content increase of –COOH will only lead to the increase of charge transfer resistance and thus reduce the electrochemical performance. In addition, along with the increase of the superfluous surface functional groups, the CC electrodes may suffer from poor electrical conductivity, low power density and deteriorative cycling stability.69,86 Therefore, the practical effect resulting from the introduction of O atoms depends on the experimental conditions.
Different from oxygen-containing functional groups, the redox active sites of nitrogen-containing functional groups are usually the N atoms. The possible reversible redox mechanism of the N-contained CC electrode is proposed as follows:88–N + 2OH−  N–O + H2O + 2e−
The introduced electron-rich nitrogen could bring more electrons to the delocalized π-system of CC, which leads to increased electrical conductivity. N-containing CC has more polar species and usually exhibit better wettability.89
Briefly, the energy storage of SCs based on bare CC generally relies on the EDL while the working principles for those with heteroatom-doped CC may vary from one to another. Hence, rational design of a modification strategy is of great importance to tune the physiochemical features of CC and thus to achieve satisfactory performance.
3. Strategies for performance improvement
As previously mentioned, the deficient capacitive properties of bare CC are usually caused by its relatively small surface area, low electrochemical activity, and poor porosity. To address these issues, some powerful strategies have been proposed to make up for the structural shortage in terms of surface area, surface functional groups, pore distribution, etc.69,79 Here, we roughly divide these methods into five groups, including wet chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, thermal activation, plasma modification, and strain modulation.
3.1 Wet chemical oxidation
Wet chemical oxidation has been proven to be an effective way to boost the capacitive performance of CC as it can increase its surface area and/or introduce functional groups for producing pseudocapacitance.81 In 2014, Wang et al. demonstrated that the capacitance and rate capability of commercial CC were dramatically enhanced after wet chemical oxidation and two-step reduction processes.81 The CC was firstly treated with a modified Hummers' method in a strong oxidizing solution composed of H2SO4, HNO3 and KMnO4. The smooth surface of carbon fibers became relatively rough after chemical oxidation (Fig. 3a and b), indicating the successful surface modification of carbon fibers. An amorphous shell with a thickness of around 50 nm was formed (Fig. 3c), which consisted of well-exfoliated carbon fibers. The chemical exfoliation brought about more than one order of magnitude of surface area enlargement, from 5.3 to 61.2 m2 g−1 (Fig. 3d). Moreover, abundant mesoporous pores with a size of 10–70 nm were created on the CC upon exfoliation. Oxygen functional groups were also introduced on the surface of CC. Notably, the substantially large amount of oxygen drastically decreased the conductivity of CC, thereby damaging its electrochemical performance. To eliminate these undesirable oxygen groups, the oxidized CC was reduced with hydrazine gas, followed by an additional thermal reduction in an NH3 atmosphere. It should be pointed out that these reduction processes hardy altered the morphology and surface area of the CC. Fig. 3e compares the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CC with different treatments in a 1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The oxidized CC after then two-step reduction process exhibited the largest current density, achieving a high capacitance of 88 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1, about 140-fold enhancement compared to the untreated CC. Additionally, this optimized CC possessed outstanding rate performance and could retain near 80% capacitance as the current density rose from 0.5 to 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3f). Such improved electrochemical performance was conjointly contributed by the incremental surface area, the production of fresh mesopores and moderate N dopants. A flexible symmetric solid-state SC device with exceptional rate capability and durability was also achieved by using the activated CC as the electrode and a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/H2SO4 gel as the electrolyte (Fig. 3g).

To achieve higher energy storage ability of CC, other researchers further optimized this wet chemical oxidation strategy.70–73 For instance, by thermally reducing the oxidized CC at 1000 °C in a H2/N2 atmosphere for 3 h, a large areal capacitance of 485.64 mF cm−2 (2 mA cm−2) was obtained by the activated CC.70 When using this activated CC as a flexible electrode, the as-fabricated solid-state SCs with excellent mechanical properties were able to deliver high energy density (0.328 mW h cm−3) and remarkable cycling durability (no decay after 30000 cycles).
The introduction of N dopants, particularly pyridinic and pyrrolic N atoms, into carbon materials is recognized as a powerful method for promoting their electrochemical activity and stability. This is because the existence of N is capable of optimizing the electronic conductivity, surface wettability and capacitive behaviour of CC.71,72 N-doped CC was synthesized through hydrothermal reduction of chemically oxidized CC in the presence of ammonia.72 An remarkable areal capacitance up to 882.36 mF cm−2 was acquired at 1 mA cm−2.71 The advantage of this hydrothermal treatment is that the elimination of oxygen-containing groups and N doping can be realized simultaneously, greatly facilitating the synthetic processes.
As discussed previously, the content ratio of oxygen functional groups including carbonyl (–CO) and hydroxy (–C–OH) is decisive to the capacitive performance of CC taking into account their two contradictory roles: (i) adding extra pseudocapacitance and (ii) decreasing the conductivity. Hence, for the sake of boosting the capacitive performance of CC, instead of removing the oxygen functional groups, research efforts are also devoted to tailoring their content and ratio.68,90,91 Wang and his co-workers investigated the impact of oxygen species on the capacitive properties of oxidized CC prepared by a similar Hummer's method.90 The surface oxygen functional groups could be modulated by adjusting the oxidation durations (denoted as AECC-n, n represents the treatment time). As shown in Fig. 4, the ratio of –C–O groups gradually increased with the prolonged oxidation time, while the –CO and –COOH groups reached a maximum value at 12 h and then decreased. The variation trend in areal capacitance as a function of oxidation time was similar to that of the oxygen groups, signifying their close relationship. The AECC-12 achieved the highest areal capacitance of 5310 mF cm−2 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2, substantially superior to those of chemically activated CC.68,71,72,81,91 However, the excessive oxygen groups will bring about a markedly decreased conductivity, leading to a decay in capacitive performance. In addition, a solid-state symmetric SC with a working potential window of 1.5 V and energy density of 4.27 mW h cm−3 was constructed based on the AECC-12 electrodes.

Although the chemical oxidation of CC has made great advances, some issues such as complicated and harsh synthetic procedures as well as toxic reagents should be further addressed before its large-scale applications.
3.2 Electrochemical oxidation
Electrochemical oxidation of CC is a very useful approach for increasing the surface area, porosity and functional groups on the CC surface.64,69,74 In comparison with chemical oxidation, it is more facile, efficient, energy/time-saving, cost-effective, and eco-friendly. Lu and coworkers reported a novel one-step electrochemical activation method to considerably enhance the capacitive properties of commercial CC under mild conditions.69 The electrochemical activation process of the CC is illustrated in Fig. 5a. By directly oxidizing CC in a mixed H2SO4–HNO3 electrolyte at a potential of 3 V for 10 min (the product was denoted as EACC-10), the surface of CC turned very coarse, and a fine core–shell carbon fiber of 50–60 nm in shell thickness was successfully formed (Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, abundant oxygen functional groups (–C–OH, –COOH and –CO) were created on the rough EACC-10 surface (Fig. 5c), and its Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area markedly raised from 5.5 to 88.4 m2 g−1 after electrochemical oxidation. Benefiting from the increased surface area and oxygen functional groups as well as its unique core–shell structure, the capacitive storage capability of the EACC-10 electrode was substantially optimized. For example, at a high current density of 6 mA cm−2, the areal capacitance of the EACC-10 electrode reached 756 mF cm−2, about 2220-fold enhancement compared to the untreated CC (0.34 mF cm−2) (Fig. 5d). Additionally, EACC-10 still retained its originally outstanding mechanical strength and flexibility. This approach is highly desirable for massive production of EACC becasue it could handle CC with a large surface area up to 10 cm2 at once and the electrolyte was reusable. They also investigated the influence of oxygen species on the capacitance of EACC, and found that the increased ratios of –COOH and –C–OH groups is favorable for boosting the capacitance (Fig. 5e). Owing to the excellent capacitive properties of EACC-10, a robust flexible asymmetric SC (ASC) device with a decent energy density of 1.5 mW h cm−3 and a cell voltage of 2.0 V was assembled based on this EACC-10 as the negative electrode and a MnO2@TiN electrode as the positive electrode. Also, this fabricated ASC device exhibited prominent cycling performance without any decay after 70000 discharge/discharge cycles (Fig. 5f).

The capability to activate CC via such a simple electrochemical oxidation method affords valuable opportunities for developing advanced low-cost flexible electrodes for SCs. Qin et al. extended this method to process KOH-activated CC, and the optimized CC exhibited high capacitances of 2.4 and 1.7 F cm−2 in positive and negative potential windows in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, respectively.74 Using the optimized CC as the electrode, a new flexible 2 V solid-state symmetric SC was demonstrated, exhibiting a remarkable energy density of 6.8 mW h cm−3 and good stability as well as prominent mechanical properties.
Electrochemical oxidation activation of CC is usually performed in a strong acidic electrolyte such as H2SO4, HNO3 and their mixed solutions, because these acids can facilitate the exfoliation of carbon fibers and functionalization of oxygen groups.64,93 However, the strong acidic ambient needs high-standard equipment and strict operational requirements. To this end, mild neutral electrolytes such as KNO3,94 (NH4)2SO4,95 and Na2SO4 (ref. 92) have been adopted to electrochemically activate CC, and remarkable capacitive performance was also achieved. Ye et al. proposed a green two-step electrochemical activation process to boost the capacitance of CC.95 Commercial CC was firstly oxidized in 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4 aqueous solution at a voltage of 10 V for 15 min with a two-electrode system, and then was reduced in 1.0 M NH4Cl aqueous solution at −1.2 V for 30 min in a three-electrode system. The resulting CC shows a maximum capacitance of 505.5 mF cm−2 at 6 mA cm−2 and ∼88% capacitance retention from 6 to 48 mA cm−2 in a H2SO4 (1.0 M) electrolyte. The purpose of the electrochemical reduction process is to remove excessive electrochemical unstable surface oxygen groups, improving the rate capability and cycling durability of activated CC. Recently, Xia et al. reported a CV oxidation method to activate air-annealed CC as a high-performance SC electrode (Fig. 6).92 The electrochemical oxidation was performed in the potential window of 0–1.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with a CV scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and 1.0 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. Owing to the induced –CO groups and increased accessible surface area, the optimized CC achieved 1548 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. Additionally, the introduced oxygen groups also broadened the operating voltage of the aqueous symmetric SCs from 1.3 to 1.8 V.

The chemical oxidation and electrochemical oxidation approaches can only activate a confined surface of CC, usually less than 50 nm thick.69,81,92,95 However, the carbon fiber diameter of CC is ca. 5–10 μm, which means only a fraction of energy storage capability of the CC is released. In order to address this issue, Han et al. proposed a valid structural and surface modulation strategy, which involves the simultaneous introduction of hierarchical pores and moderate pseudocapacitive oxygen groups into CC.96 The activated CC (named APCC) was obtained by a chemical etching process followed by electrochemical oxidation (Fig. 7a). A large number of pores with different sizes were created on the inside and surface of carbon fibers by first growth of NiOOH nanoflakes on the CC surface and subsequent calcination in a N2 atmosphere (denoted as PCC). The BET surface of the CC obviously increased from 6.5 to 25.7 m2 g−1 (Fig. 7b). After a fast electrochemical oxidation in a H2SO4–HNO3 electrolyte, the surface of the CC was functionalized with numerous oxygen functional groups and its surface area further increased to 201.3 m2 g−1. In the meantime, abundant pores with a wide size distribution of 0.5 to 32 nm were formed, greatly improving the surface area and ion diffusion rate. Notably, the thickness of the amorphous shell was up to 150 nm, much larger compared to previous studies, indicating its higher utilization efficiency of carbon fibers. As a consequence, this APCC electrode possessed the best capacitive performance, as revealed by the largest current density among these samples in CV curves (Fig. 7c). When the discharge current was 4 mA cm−2, it was able to yield a pronounced capacitance of 1.2 F cm−2 and could maintain 59.5% of its original capacitance at 80 mA cm−2. Additionally, the mechanical strength of APCC (17.4 MPa) was only slightly less than that of pristine CC (18.2 MPa), demonstrating that these treatments did not damage its mechanical properties. By using this APCC as the negative electrode, a flexible ASC device with higher energy density (4.70 mW h cm−3) and power density (2.29 W cm−3) was achieved.

3.3 Thermal activation
Thermal treatment is one of the most commonly used methods to activate the reactivity of CC and thereby improve its capacitive performance. Yet, according to different practical requirements, the role of high temperature may vary from one to another in different studies. Sometimes, thermal annealing is employed to facilitate or accelerate the chemical reaction courses, which aim at enlarging the surface area (by carbon surface etching) or introducing active sites (via functional groups) for charge storage. Under these conditions, other additives such as reactive materials or chemical enchants are essential to achieve this purpose. In other cases, the thermal treatment itself can change the surface status of carbon substrates, by altering the nanoarchitecture or generating highly reactive defects. Of course, it is not easy to precisely distinguish these two effects because they may take effect at the same time, endowing CC with excellent capacitive performance.15,64,75,76
The surface area is essential to the capacitive properties of SC electrodes, particularly carbon materials with EDL behaviours. Generally, a high surface area will lead to a good performance. A scalable and top-down strategy based on KOH activation and thermal annealing was reported by Zhang et al. to remarkably enlarge the surface area of CC, thus effectively boosting its EDL capacitance.75 Under a N2 atmosphere, the CC was firstly treated with KOH at 800 °C, and then thermally activated at 1100 °C for 2 h. The KOH treatment time played a crucial role in determining the specific surface area, and a substantially large surface area up to 2720 m2 g−1 was reached after 2 h activation (Fig. 8a), and was further increased to 2780 m2 g−1 after high temperature annealing. Additionally, due to the improved graphitization degree upon thermal calcination at 1100 °C, the resistivity of KOH treated CC decreased from 1.5 to 0.31 Ω cm, achieving an excellent conductivity of 322 S m−1 without affecting its original mechanical flexibility and strength. When directly using the treated CC as a SC electrode, it could present a large specific capacitance of 197 F g−1 and areal capacitance of ∼0.5 F cm−2 at 0.1 A g−1, with a good rate performance (Fig. 8b).

Although the KOH activation of carbon materials has brought about some obvious advantages of an ultrahigh surface area, high porosity, low activation temperatures, higher yields, and less activation time, some disadvantages including strong KOH corrosiveness and the necessary washing procedure to eliminate these chemical agents are needed to further addressed.97–99 Wang et al. exploited a facile high-temperature annealing method to activate commercial CC without using any additives.15 Before calcination, the carbon fibers of pristine CC exhibited smooth edges with a shell–core structure, whose core was enclosed by graphite sheets (Fig. 8c). After direct annealing of CC at 1000 °C in industrial N2 for 1 h, more defects and a nanoporous structure were formed onto the shell of the carbon fibers (Fig. 8d). Activated CC with a high surface area ranging from 500 to 819 m2 g−1 was easily obtained by adjusting the treatment temperature and time. Because of the ultramicropore effects, high surface area and superhydrophilicity, the capacitances of the treated CC showed three orders of magnitude enhancement compared to pristine CC (Fig. 8e), reaching 2.9 F cm−2 and 224 F g−1 at 2.5 mA cm−2 in a 6 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. More importantly, this method was very suitable for scalable activation of commercial CC with high flexibility, for instance an area of 512 cm2 (Fig. 8f). The use of activated CC as a free-standing electrode in the fabrication of flexible SCs was also demonstrated, enabling an areal energy density of 128 μW h cm−2.
The direct annealing of CC in air atmosphere at a moderate temperature also enhance the supercapacitive performance of CC.76,100 Besides increasing the surface area as in inert gases, oxygen function groups will be simultaneously created onto the CC surface via thermal oxidation in air, yielding additional pseudocapacitance and improving the surface wettability. After air calcination at 450 °C, the specific surface area of the CC dramatically increased and reached a high value of 702.8 m2 g−1 with a pore size of 8.6 nm (Fig. 9a) when the calcination time was fixed to 2 h (namely ACC450-2).76 The hydrophobic surface of CC has been tuned to a superhydrophilic one. Both the annealing temperature and time have a great effect on its capacitive performance (Fig. 9b). Overall, the ACC450-2 electrode possessed optimized capacitance and rate capability. Notably the air treatment temperature should be well controlled to avoid exceedingly destroying the mechanical properties of CC.

3.4 Plasma modification
Plasma treatment, different from liquids, solids, and gases, involves neutral atoms, positively charged ions, negatively charged electrons and neutral molecules. Plasma etching is considered as an effective method to remove materials or modify the surface properties of CC, particularly high-power plasma treatment.77,78 Depending on the nature of the plasma gas (inert or reactive one), etching is accomplished by either a physical or a chemical way. Physical etching has the inherent advantages of anisotropic etching, but the limitation of poor selectivity. Chemical etching involves transport of reactive species through diffusion followed by reaction with the substrate atom. Obviously, chemical etching is isotropic under all directions, along with good selectivity. Generally, proper plasma treatment is very likely to introduce a well-defined nanoarchitecture and element dopants over carbon fibers, leading to the enlargement of the specific surface area and the introduction of additional active cites. Furthermore, the enhanced surface energy of CC can also improve its wettability upon the plasma treatment. These features enable CC to function as an advanced SC electrode.
Fan and his colleagues developed a facile one-step nitrogen plasma surface functionalization method to simultaneously create a 3D hierarchical nanostructure and generate N functional groups on the CC surface, resulting in remarkably improved wettability and capacitive performance. The formation mechanism of hierarchical nitrogen doped CC (hNCC) is presented in Fig. 10a. The smooth surface of pristine CC was made up of graphitic and amorphous carbon. Upon plasma treatment, abundant N2+ molecular ions with a high excitation energy (∼18.7 eV) were produced, which reacted with and etched the surface amorphous carbon to generate volatile CNx+. Due to its high stability, the graphitic carbon continuously accumulated and formed numerous spherical nanoparticles with a graphite-like structure (Fig. 10b), achieving a hierarchical 3D nanoarchitecture on the outer surface of CC. Meanwhile, the N-containing ions would bond with graphitic carbon (particularly at the graphitic edges) to induce N dopants. As shown in Fig. 10c, oxidized N (N-X, 402.7 eV), quaternary N (N-Q, 400.8 eV), pyrrolic N (N-5, 399.7 eV), and pyridinic N (N-6, 398.4 eV) species were successfully introduced into hNCC, which could afford good electrical conductivity and electrochemically active sites. At 4 mA cm−2, the as-obtained hNCC yielded a high capacitance of 391 mF cm−2, ∼3250-fold larger than that of untreated CC (Fig. 10d). Additionally, this hNCC displayed admirable rate capability and cycling stability (no decrease after 10000 cycles). Similarly, N-doped CC with a moderate areal capacitance (322 mF cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2) was prepared by a modified nitrogen plasma treatment process with a 400 W RF power.78

3.5 Active material loading
Loading active materials onto CC is a common approach to obtain satisfactory capacitance as they can bring about additional pseudocapacitance and greatly expand the operating voltage window. For instance, Peng et al. synthesized a hierarchical carbon coated Fe3O4 nanorod on CC (denoted as CC/CW/Fe3O4@C) through a hydrothermal method and annealing in an Ar atmosphere (Fig. 11a).101 The CC/CW/Fe3O4@C anode exhibited good areal and gravimetric capacitances of 695 mF cm−2 and 463 F g−1 at 1.5 mA cm−2 in a voltage range of −1.3 to 0 V (Fig. 11b). Meanwhile, the CC used as the active material scaffold and current collector enabled the assembly of flexible ASCs. An electroplated MnO2 nanowire array on CC (CC/CW/MnO2) was prepared as a cathode to match the CC/CW/Fe3O4@C anode. As expected, the as-prepared ASC delivered a high energy density of 91.1 W h kg−1 (1384 W kg−1) and could maintain the original energy storage performance when it was folded and twisted (Fig. 11c). In addition to metal oxides, other carbon materials and polymers have also been attempted to be introduced onto CC. Xiong et al. reported a nanometer-thick polyaniline film that conformally coated graphitic petals grown on CC, which delivered 2.6 F cm−2 (2000 F g−1) at 1.3 mA cm−2 in a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte.102

3.6 Other activation methods
Some other methods including electrochemical intercalation and mechanical strain modulation have also been reported to manipulate the capacitive behaviour of CC.103,104 For example, Wang and coworkers in situ exfoliated graphene from CC to interconnected carbon fibers via an electrochemical intercalation approach with a negative potential of −4 V and a tetramethylammonium perchlorate electrolyte. When used as a SC electrode in a 1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte, it could deliver a capacitance of 64.5 mF cm−2 at 0.75 mA cm−2, substantially higher than that of CC (17.1 mF cm−2). The coupling of surface mechanics and electrochemistry recently emerged as a creative way to modulate the reactivity of CC in SCs. Zhang et al. developed an interesting mechanical stretching approach to tune the capacitive charging/discharging process of CC.104 They found that the capacitance of CC was strain-dependent, and it would decrease under tensile strain due to the change of surface free energy. The electrochemical performance of CC with different treatments is summarized in Table 1.

4. Conclusion and prospects
Due to the relatively small specific surface area and insufficient active sites, the capacitance of commercial CC in SCs is far from satisfactory. To address these issues, several efficient and enlightening strategies have been proposed to promote the capacitive performance of CC and its applications in SCs, involving wet chemical and electrochemical oxidation, thermal activation, plasma modification, active material loading, etc. Specifically, to boost the EDL capacitance of CC, attempts are made to increase the surface area and porosity of CC. To add additional pseudocapacitance, abundant oxygen functional groups and/or N dopants are introduced onto the carbon surface as they are beneficial to both the electrochemical activity of CC and the surface wettability. In this review, we have summarized the recent progress of these smart modification methods and elucidated the working principles of different methods. Some representative studies have been presented and discussed in detail. In spite of the considerable achievements made in the past few years, there are still some scientific questions and challenges that need to be addressed towards high-performance and robust CC electrodes.
4.1 Simplification of the synthetic methods
Considering its low cost and unique flexibility, CC is one of the most promising materials for the construction of advanced SCs adapted to practical applications, especially in wearable or flexible electronic devices. Yet, most reported activated methods involve harsh synthetic conditions such as a concentrated acid or alkali, toxic hydrazine, and high temperature, which go against economy and environmental friendliness. Hence, it is highly imperative to develop mild, green and effective activation methods to boost the surface area, active sites and wettability of CC, particularly those allowing large-scale productions.
4.2 Further capacity optimization
Although the activated CC displays substantially better capacity in contrast to the pristine sample, its energy storage performance is still far from satisfactory, especially compared with other carbon materials with high porosity or a large specific surface area. This flaw becomes much more sever in microchipped devices and is now considered as the main obstacle for its further practical application. In situ introduction of active materials like metal oxides onto CC is effective but one more potential solution is to increase the utilization efficiency of CC. Currently, the reported activated layer of CC is generally less than 150 nm thick but the diameter of carbon fibers is 5–10 μm. There is still a large space to create more active sites for the adsorption/desorption of charge carriers. However, further oxidation of the carbon substrate has been demonstrated to invalid because of the block effect of the surface activated layer. In this regard, constructing interconnected hierarchical porous frameworks within CC before activation is a promising strategy to make full use of CC. However, the mechanical properties of CC will be sacrificed when creating too many pores. To achieve highly flexible electrodes, the porous architecture and mechanical performance should be balanced. Thus, the rational design of 3D porous CC with a high surface area, hierarchical pores and favourable mechanical flexibility and systematically exploring the relationship between the pre-created porous structure and capacitive properties of CC are highly desirable.
4.3 Novel SC assembly
The development of new-type devices promises both favourable capacitance and high energy density of SCs. An attracting approach is to enlarge the operation voltage window by fabricating flexible asymmetric SCs, which take advantage of the different potential windows of the positive and negative electrodes to increase the device operating voltage. Moreover, other novel SCs such as Zn ion SCs, which consist of battery-type Zn anodes and capacitive carbon-based cathodes, are emerging as high-energy candidates for energy storage. It has been demonstrated that a Zn ion SC based on the N-doped porous carbon cathode could exhibit a high energy density of 107.3 W h kg−1.8 Therefore, future efforts are suggested to focus on flexible asymmetric SCs and Zn ion SCs towards increasing the energy density of devices.
4.4 Mechanism investigation
The introduction of heteroatoms like O and N has been verified to be capable of enhancing the performance of CC to some extent, but only with an appropriate content ratio and certain types of functional groups. Indeed, their working mechanism is still unclear and needs further characterization. Besides theoretical simulation, as mostly reported in the literature, in situ experimental observation of the reaction routes is highly desired to unravel different roles of different groups.
