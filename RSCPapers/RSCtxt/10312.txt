    , Accepted 14th August 2017First published on 14th August 2017AbstractSodium ion batteries (SIBs) are one promising power source with low cost, abundant resource supply and good environmental benignity, but the development of a large capacity and long cycle life anode remains a great challenge. Unique lychee-like FeS2@FeSe2 core–shell microspheres were fabricated and used as an anode material for SIBs, delivering a high discharge capacity of 350 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 2700 cycles, and even up to 301.5 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 after 3850 cycles with over 97% coulombic efficiency. The significant enhancement in performance is contributed by the structure and chemistry of FeS2@FeSe2 core–shell microspheres, which are stacked into a uniformly distributed porous spheres-based electrode for fast mass transport to access both the FeS2 core and the FeSe2 shell, and the more conductive shell FeSe2 encapsulates the less conductive FeS2 for fast electron transfer/transport while preventing the aggregation of active FeS2 for a large reaction surface. This model may reveal an important scientific insight that the size of microspheres of less than diffusion thickness can make the electrochemical reaction take place without a diffusion limit like a surface-controlled pseudocapacitive behavior for an extremely rapid electron transport pathway. This study vividly demonstrates the great synergistic effects of the physics and chemistry of a nano/microstructure on the performance of energy storage devices, and the approach to the design of such a core–shell structure may have universal significance for the large capacity and long cycle life of SIBs.
Introduction
Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are one of the most promising power sources because of the lower cost, more bountiful supply and better environmental benignity of sodium than lithium.1–3 For practical applications, SIBs still face great challenges that include poor rate capability and short cycle life originating from the larger radius and higher molar mass of the sodium ion (Na+) than the lithium ion.4 Layered anode materials like graphite have been widely applied in commercial lithium ion batteries, but the same structured electrode in SIBs suffers from relatively low specific storage capacity since no similar staged intercalation compounds fit Na+ due to the small interlayer spacing.5 In addition, the sodium insertion potential ranging from 0 to 0.1 V for graphite is almost same as the sodium plating potential, which could lead to the growth of sodium dendrites causing safety issues.6,7 It is indispensable to synthesize suitable electrode materials with a large interlayer spacing to tolerate the large volume change resulting from Na+ insertion and extraction for a high capacity and long cycle life.8,9
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) such as FeS2,10 MoS2,11,12 WS2,13 CoSe,14 TiS2,15 ZnS,16 FeSe2,17–19 NiSe2,20 CuSe2 (ref. 21) and MoSe2 (ref. 22 and 23) have open-frame architectures with analogous structures to graphite as well as multi-electron transfer reactions per mole of metal ions, and they exhibit alloying and conversion mechanisms in SIBs, showing high theoretical capacities.24,25 Unfortunately, most TMCs have a large volume change and slow kinetics for the Na+ insertion/extraction process, resulting in rapid capacity loss and cycle life fading. For example, a rod-like Sb2S3 anode material for SIBs can deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1066 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, but only retains 65.6% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles.26 Very recently, considerable work has been dedicated to building unique core–shell heterostructures of carbon-coated nanomaterials with prominent sodium storage capability for SIBs.27,28 Graphitic carbon coated FeSe2@rGO hybrid nanofibers have been constructed to achieve a high rate specific capacity of 412 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 150 cycles.17 Nevertheless, these carbon coated anode materials still suffer from a short cycle life (always less than 2000 cycles), and are not feasible for large-scale manufacturing processes. In addition, the use of carbon as the conductive part in a core–shell structured electrode still cannot reach large capacities and the low tapping density of the active material has a poor volumetric capacity.18,29 It is expected that constructing a core–shell system with two different transition metal compounds could overcome the drawbacks of the current carbon-coated core–shell structures while synergizing two individual constituents for outstanding sodium storage capability and long cycle life. Different core–shell structured TMCs have been fabricated and applied in supercapacitors,30,31 solar cells32 and photoluminescence.33 Just recently, Co9S8/MoS2 yolk–shell spheres for Li/Na storage have been reported, but there is great room for further improvement in the rate capacity and cycle life, and the enhancement mechanism has not yet been studied.34
Pyrite FeS2 is a natural mineral with low cost and natural abundance, and it has a layered structure with each layer stacking via van der Waals interactions. Moreover, it has an open layered framework and large interlayer spacing, which allow reversible Na+ transport during the discharge and charging process, giving it great potential as an anode material in SIBs.35 The currently developed FeS2 anode in SIBs can offer an ultralong cycle life of 20000 cycles at 1 A g−1, but its capacity is no more than 200 mA h g−1, which is much less than the theoretical capacity of ∼894 mA h g−1.2 The relatively low capacity of FeS2 should be related to its high cut-off voltage of 0.8 V that is associated with the conversion-type reaction at 0.1–0.8 V. Moreover, the large volume charge and aggregation issue limit the capacity of SIBs during operation. On the other hand, the TMC material of FeSe2 has a similar pyrite structure and physicochemical properties to FeS2, but possesses better electronic conductivity based on the conductivity of selenium (10−4 μS cm−1) over sulfur (10−21 μS cm−1) as well as higher reversible capacity.19 The synergistic properties of FeS2 and FeSe2 inspired us to prepare a hybrid material with a core–shell structure for a high performance SIB anode.
Herein, unique lychee-like FeS2@FeSe2 core–shell microspheres (FeS2@FeSe2) are designed and fabricated through two hydrothermal steps, and are further investigated as an anode material for SIBs. The as-prepared FeS2@FeSe2 displays superior sodium storage performance with a high reversible discharge capacity of 350 mA h g−1 after 2700 cycles at 1 A g−1, and still up to 301.5 mA g−1 after 3850 cycles at 5 A g−1 with over 97% coulombic efficiency. Based on the experimental results, the significant performance enhancement mechanism is discussed accordingly.
Experimental section
Preparation of FeS2 microspheres
The FeS2 microspheres were prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis according to the previously reported method. A detailed experimental procedure is as follows: 1 mmol of FeSO4·7H2O and 5 mmol of urea were dissolved into a mixture solution consisting of 15 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) and 20 ml of ethylene glycol (EG) under stirring for 30 minutes, followed by the addition of a certain amount of sublimed sulfur under vigorous stirring for 0.5 h to form a precursor solution, which was then transferred into a 50 ml autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 12 h to produce FeS2 microspheres. The produced sample was collected through centrifugal cleaning using deionized water and anhydrous ethanol.
Preparation of lychee-like FeS2@FeSe2 microspheres
In a typical process, 1 mmol of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O and 2 mmol of Se powder were dissolved into 30 ml of deionized water under stirring for 0.5 h, followed by the dropwise addition of 4 ml of hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) under continuous stirring for 0.5 h. Then, 1 mmol of as-prepared FeS2 microspheres was dissolved into the above solution under stirring for 0.5 h. The resulting precursor suspension was transferred to a 50 ml autoclave and was heated at 180 °C for 24 h. The product was washed centrifugally, with ultrasound and vacuum drying at 80 °C for 12 h. As a control, plain FeSe2 nanoparticles were prepared using the same method but without the addition of FeS2 microspheres.
Materials characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-7000 X-ray diffractometer, scan rate: 2° min−1), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6510) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100) were used to measure the crystal structure, morphology and chemical composition of the as-prepared samples. Specific surfaces and pore size distributions of the samples were determined by an automatic adsorption instrument NOVA1200e (Quantachrome, Boynton Beach, Florida). Element value information of the samples was investigated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS-ESCALAB250).
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements of the as-prepared FeSe2@FeS2 microspheres were carried out by assembling a half-cell configuration with sodium metal and glass fiber (Whatman, GF/D) as the counter electrode and separators, respectively. The working electrode was made from a slurry prepared from the active electrode materials (FeS2@FeSe2), conductive materials (acetylene black) and binder (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC) with deionized water as the solution at a weight ratio of 6:3:1, which was coated directly onto copper foil by using a blade and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The electrolyte is 1.0 M NaCF3SO3 in diethyleneglycol dimethylether (DEGDME). The CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in a high-purity Ar-filled glove box, and both the moisture and oxygen content were less than 0.5 ppm. The typical loading of the prepared sample per electrode in the half cell was approximately 0.6–0.9 mg, and the specific capacity of the full cell was calculated based on the mass of anodic FeS2@FeSe2. Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed at a potential range of 0.5–2.9 V vs. Na/Na+ using a Land testing system (Wuhan, China) at room temperature (26 °C). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured at a scan rate from 0.1 to 1.5 mV s−1 between 0.5 and 2.9 V using a CHI-660D electrochemistry workstation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted by using a CHI-660D electrochemistry workstation in a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz.
Results and discussion
The material fabrication process is schematically shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, FeS2 microspheres were first synthesized by a solvothermal reaction using ferric sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) as a precursor. Subsequently, the core–shell structure was constructed via the solvothermal reaction of ammonium ferric sulfate (Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O), selenium powder and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) in the presence of the FeS2 microsphere templates. In contrast, plain FeSe2 nanoparticles were synthesized using the same method in the absence of FeS2 templates. The structure of the materials was characterized by SEM and TEM. The SEM image in Fig. 1a shows that the FeS2 microspheres are piled up together and have a relatively smooth surface with an average diameter of ∼2 μm (Fig. 1b and c). In further processing by hydrothermal synthesis the surface of the FeS2 microsphere backbone becomes rougher, apparently due to the encapsulation by highly dense FeSe2 nanoparticles (Fig. 1d and e) for an intriguing core–shell microsphere of FeS2@FeSe2 with a lychee-like structure. It should be noted that the uniformity of the microspheres is still retained with diameters of around 2–3 μm. Meanwhile, the core–shell structure of FeS2@FeSe2 with uniform coverage of porous FeSe2 outside the FeS2 microspheres can be further confirmed from the TEM image in Fig. 1f. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the FeS2@FeSe2 microspheres at the edge (Fig. 1g and h) show that two distinct lattice fringes with spacings of 0.37 and 0.246 nm match with the (110) planes of cubic FeS2 and the (210) facet of orthorhombic FeSe2, respectively. The electron diffraction X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analysis in Fig. 1i displays well-defined spatial distributions of all elements Fe, S and Se with mass percentages of 35.61%, 23.44% and 40.95%, respectively, within the microspheres (Fig. S1†). Additionally, the SEM and TEM images of plain FeSe2 show that large numbers of the nanoparticles are stacked together and their size is about 20 nm (Fig. S2†). Meanwhile, EDS spectra of plain FeS2 microspheres and FeSe2 nanoparticles illustrate the uniform distribution of Fe and Se/S (Fig. S3†).

The crystal and porous structures and the surface properties of the materials were checked by XRD, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms and XPS. The XRD result (Fig. S4a†) shows that all the diffraction peaks of the FeS2 microspheres are in good agreement with the standard JCPDS no. 42-1340 for a cubic FeS2 phase with the space group Pa. The three diffraction peaks located at 34.92°, 36.28° and 48.24° are observed after coating with FeSe2 (Fig. 2a), which can be confirmed to be facets of the (111), (120) and (211) planes of orthorhombic FeSe2 with space group Pnnm (58) (JCPDS no. 79-1892). Moreover, the diffraction peaks of FeS2@FeSe2 with low intensity are also indexed, including (011), (121), (131), (310) and (212) for FeSe2 and (111) for FeS2. It should be noted that the low crystalline degree of FeS2 is ascribed to a relatively low synthetic temperature (less than 180 °C) and short synthetic time (less than 12 h). The plain FeSe2 nanoparticles display a good degree of crystallization (Fig. S4b†) and the calculated average grain size is ∼17 nm according to the Scherrer formula. There is no impurity detected in any of the samples, which indicates the high purity of the materials. Since the specific surface area and pore structure of electrode materials can greatly affect the sodium storage capability, the typical nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore-size distribution curve of the FeS2@FeSe2 microspheres in Fig. 2b and c show that the specific surface area and pore size are 15.05 m2 g−1 and 4 nm, respectively. In contrast, the specific surface areas of plain FeS2 microspheres and FeSe2 nanoparticles are 11.97 and 17.91 m2 g−1 with pore radii of 21.56 and 2.14 nm, respectively (Fig. S5†). The XPS spectrum of FeS2@FeSe2 microspheres in Fig. S6† shows that the main elements of Fe, Se, and S are recorded. The high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 2d) displays two major peaks at 708 and 720.4 eV, corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 with a spin energy separation of about 12.4 eV, exhibiting the characteristics of divalent iron.36,37 The separated XPS spectra of S 2p (Fig. 2e) at 162.1 and 163.2 eV are attributed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively. Further, the binding energies of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 located at 54.2 and 55.1 eV are shown in Fig. 2f. These material characterization results demonstrate the successful fabrication of the FeS2@FeSe2 core–shell microspheres.

The cycling stability of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode was evaluated in ether- and carbonate-based electrolytes over a potential window of 0.5–2.9 V, which shows that the electrode has a better cycle life in the ether-based electrolyte than in the carbonate one (Fig. S7†). This is very likely to be ascribed to the better suppression of the reaction between electrolyte and polysulfides for the slow loss of active materials and also the formation of a negligible SEI layer on the electrode surface for Na+ accessing the FeS2 and FeSe2 lattice in the ether-based electrolyte than that reported.18 In contrast, the carbonate-based electrolyte forms a relatively thick SEI layer on the electrode surface to block Na+ transport while reacting with the intermediate products of transition-metal disulfides and diselenides, resulting in the prompt depletion of active materials. The cycling performance of the electrode over the different voltage windows was investigated (Fig. S8†). The result shows that the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode has a better cycling stability in a voltage window of 0.5–2.9 V than one over 0.01–3 V, which might be caused by the presence of conversion-type reactions resulting in a large volume change by the deep discharge in a wider operation potential window. In addition, consider that the initial irreversible capacity loss mainly derives from the discharge capacity in the voltage range of 0.5–0 V. Therefore, a cut-off voltage of 0.5 V was selected to give an excellent reversible sodium storage reaction.
The sodium storage capability of the FeS2@FeSe2 microspheres was evaluated by assembling 2032 coin-type sodium half cells with an ether-based electrolyte (1 M NaCF3SO3 in diethyleneglycol dimethylether). The galvanostatic discharge–charge curves of the FeS2@FeSe2 at different cycles in a voltage range of 0.5–2.9 V at 1 A g−1 are depicted in Fig. 3a, showing that the initial sodiation and desodiation capacities are about 360 and 348.8 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to a higher initial CE of 96.8% over other reported Fe-based anode materials (for example, 48.3% of CE for Fe2O3 and 52% of CE for Fe3O4).38,39 It should be noted that the discharge capacity slowly decays to 245 mA h g−1 within 20 cycles, followed by a steady increase to 400.3 mA h g−1 at 200 cycles, which could be attributed to the activation of FeS2@FeSe2 during the initial stage. A similar phenomenon has been reported in CoSe2 (ref. 40) and CoS2 (ref. 41) anode materials in SIBs. Those results can be attributed to the pulverization of the original FeSe2 and the in situ formation of Fe nanoparticles resulting in the reduction of the electrical cut-off voltage to 0.5 V connectivity between neighboring nanoparticles during the Na+ insertion/extraction process for a fading life over the first 20 cycles and smaller Fe nanoparticles being formed in situ in the following cycles due to an electrochemical milling effect for better FeSe2–FeS2 contact. It is reported that the activation energies for solid-state double decomposition reactions decrease with decreasing reagent particle size.42 Thus, the conversion reaction, FeSe2 + 4Na+ + 4e− → 2Na2Se + Fe, which is usually reported to be irreversible, can become reversible in the FeS2@FeSe2 microspheres due to the very small Fe nanoparticles for improved electrochemical reactivity, thus increasing the reversible capacity of the FeS2@FeSe2 after 20 cycles. After 200 cycles, stable sodiation voltage plateaus of ∼1.89, 1.53, 1.05 and 0.66 V together with the desodiation plateaus of ∼1.48 and 1.85 V are observed, suggesting the reversible insertion/extraction of Na+. The measured EIS curves of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode at different charging/discharging states after 200 cycles (Fig. S9†) show that the variation in the charge transfer resistance (Rct) is less than 10 Ω, indicating a fast electrode kinetics.

The sodium storage capability of the FeS2@FeSe2, FeS2 and FeSe2 (Fig. S10†) shows that the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode has the highest discharge capacity of 395 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 270 cycles. In contrast, the FeSe2 and FeS2 electrodes have reversible capacities of only 155 and 62 mA h g−1, respectively, vividly displaying that a rationally designed micro/nanostructure can greatly enhance its charge/discharge performance. The cycling stability of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode was measured with the result given in Fig. 3b, showing a large discharge capacity of 350 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 2700 cycles and 301.5 mA h g−1 after 3850 cycles at 5 A g−1. The coulombic efficiency always maintains high values between 98% and 100%. Most remarkably, at a high rate of 7 A g−1, the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode achieves an ultralong cycle life of 10000 cycles with a reversible discharge capacity of 153.3 mA h g−1, which accounts for 84% retention of the discharge capacity of 182.7 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle (Fig. S11†). Such cycling and capacity performance is far superior to the previously reported Fe-based anodes in SIBs.10,17,18,43 The Nyquist plots of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode after different cycles were recorded and analyzed (Fig. S12†). A small Rct not only indicates a fast Na+ insertion/extraction process for charge transfer, but also enables excellent cycling stability.40Rct gradually decreases from 133.3 to 34.1 Ω during the 10th to 500th cycles, indicating a continuously improving electrode process, which is very likely to be attributed to surface activation and lattice expansion triggering better Na+ transfer/transport.44 In addition, the measured SEM image of the FeS2@FeSe2 at 1 A g−1 after 200 cycles shows that the FeS2@FeSe2 microspheres maintain their original morphologies, as shown in Fig. S13,† which indicates the good structural stability of the electrode materials during the cycles.
The rate capability of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode was evaluated after 200 cycles, as illustrated in Fig. 3c, exhibiting a discharge capacity of ∼596 mA h g−1 in the initial five cycles at 0.1 A g−1. As the current density sequentially increased to 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1 for each five cycles, the discharge capacity showed only slight changes with 486, 456, 426 and 346 mA h g−1, respectively. More importantly, even at a very high rate of 10 A g−1, the discharge capacity can still reach 203 mA h g−1. When the current density is quickly turned back to 0.1 A g−1, the reversible capacity can be recovered to 596 mA h g−1 with 100% retention of the capacity relative to the capacity at the 5th cycle, suggesting that the electrode has a robust structure with a strong tolerance and fast Na+ transport during the sodiation/desodiation. Fig. 3d shows the discharge–charge profiles of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode at different rates, further indicating its superior rate capability. The as-prepared FeS2@FeSe2 electrode achieves the best rate capability among the currently reported TMCs in SIBs (Fig. 3e). As a control, the rate performances of plain FeS2 and FeSe2 were also carried out (Fig. S14†), exhibiting discharge capacities of only 23.3 and 41.4 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1, respectively, which are much less than that of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode. The charge working potential (at ∼1.47 V) of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode at different current rates in Fig. 3f shows a small voltage evolution of ∼0.05 V over low current rates ranging from 0.1 to 2 A g−1, and only a voltage change of 0.19 V for a current increase from 2 to 10 A g−1, possibly indicating a very rational pore structure for low polarization. Furthermore, the charge times are ∼250 s and 73 s at charge rates of 5 and 10 A g−1, which can achieve high charge storage capacities of 356 and 210 mA h g−1, respectively, holding great promise for manufacturing practical high charge rate Na+ batteries. As a demonstration, a sodium ion full cell was assembled from an Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode and an FeS2@FeSe2 anode to further evaluate the practical applications of FeS2@FeSe2 microspheres. The good cycling stability over 300 cycles clearly demonstrates the practical application of an FeS2@FeSe2 anode in SIBs (Fig. S15–S17†).
The electrochemical behaviors of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode were further investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 4a), showing that there are several cathodic/anodic peaks (noted as A1/B1, A2/B2, A3 and A4) corresponding to Na+-insertion/extraction, NaxFeM2 and FeM/Na2M (M = S, Se) as well as reduction of metallic Fe (Scheme S1†), respectively.10,17,18 The electrochemical reactions occurring on the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode involve a diffusion-controlled process and/or surface-controlled (pseudocapacitive behavior) processes, which can be determined by the relationship of peak current (i) versus scan rate (v) in terms of the following equations:45–47 i = avb(1) logi = b × logv + loga(2)where a and b are adjustment parameters. In particular, a b value of 0.5 represents a diffusion-controlled reaction and 1.0 represents a surface-controlled reaction. On the other hand, when 0.5 < b < 1.0, the electrode reaction involves both processes, and a larger value for b means a higher proportion of surface-controlled reaction.39,48 Apparently, the surface-controlled reaction is much faster than the diffusion-controlled process. The relationships of peak current versus scan rate for all peaks of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode are shown in Fig. 4b and S18,† and the calculated b values are 0.84 (A1), 1.01 (A2), 0.93 (A3), 0.88 (A4), 0.92 (B1) and 0.82 (B2), respectively (Fig. S19†), indicating a mainly surface-controlled electrode process for a fast Na+-insertion/extraction reaction, resulting in a high rate charge capability. Further, the contribution of the pseudocapacitive (k1v) and diffusion-controlled intercalation (k2v1/2) behavior versus the scan rate can be calculated and plotted with the equation i = k1v + k2v1/2, and the former changes from 69% to 91.4% as the scan rate increases from 0.1 to 1.5 mV s−1 (Fig. 4c). The detailed portions of the pseudocapacitive contributions are given in Fig. 4d and S20,† further showing that the pseudocapacitive charge-storage has a distinct advantage for the overall high rate capacity. Meanwhile, CV curves of the plain FeS2 and FeSe2 at different scan rates in Fig. S21† show redox peaks similar to FeS2@FeSe2 and the calculated b values are much lower than those of the FeS2@FeSe2 (Table S1†), suggesting that the pseudocapacitive contributions of the FeS2@FeSe2 are much larger than those of FeS2 and FeSe2. This is why the rate capability and cycling stability of the FeS2@FeSe2 are superior to those of the two plain materials. In addition, the Na+ diffusion coefficient can be evaluated according to the Randles–Sevcik equation:49 ip = 2.69 × 105An3/2CoD1/2v1/2(3)where ip, A, n, Co, D and v represent the peak current, electrode surface, charge transfer number, Na+ concentration, diffusion coefficient and sweep rate, respectively. Values of DNa+ for all samples are calculated in terms of the slopes of ipvs. v1/2 plots (Fig. S22†), of which those for FeS2@FeSe2 are larger than those for FeS2 and FeSe2 by 8.1 and 6.8 times, respectively, clearly evidencing its faster mass transport rate than for the latter two.

(c) Bar chart showing the fraction of the pseudocapacitive contribution of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode, (d) CV curves with the pseudocapacitive contribution to the total current shown by the shaded part at 1 mV s−1. 
The electrochemical reaction process of the electrode was further explored by recording the structure and compositions of the electrodes after 200 charge/discharge cycles. The XRD patterns of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrodes at different sodiation/desodiation states in Fig. 5a show two obvious diffraction peaks at 43.3° and 50.5°, which match well with the (111) and (200) planes of the Cu current collector. After discharging to 0.5 V (Fig. 5b), a weak characteristic peak at 44.7° that corresponds to the (110) plane can be assigned to metallic Fe with a d-spacing of 0.202 nm, demonstrating that FeS2 and FeSe2 have been reduced to metallic Fe after the insertion of Na+. When further charged to 2.9 V, the peak of metallic Fe disappears and a few weak peaks of FeSe2 are observed, and the marked lattice spacing of 0.202 nm corresponds to the (110) plane of FeSe2. It should be noted that phases relating to Na2S, Na2Se and FeS2 are not detected in all XRD patterns. Meanwhile, the EDS and elemental mapping images of the FeS2@FeSe2 electrode in fully discharged and charged states (Fig. 5c and d) show that all the elements including Se, Na, S and Fe are uniformly distributed over the surface of the whole electrode, of which the mass percentage of the Na element is 15.57% and 10.79% in fully discharged and charged states, respectively.

Based on the experimental results discussed above, we argue that the superior sodium storage performance of FeS2@FeSe2 is contributed by the structure and chemistry of the lychee-like core–shell microsphere, in which the porous spheres are stacked into an electrode with macro channels for fast mass transport, while the more conductive shell FeSe2 encapsulates the less conductive FeS2 (ref. 19) for fast electron transfer/transport while preventing the aggregation of FeS2 for a large reaction surface. Moreover, the FeSe2 shell not only offers good conductivity for electron transport paths for the poorer conductive FeS2, but can also provide extra Na2Se and metallic Fe nanoparticles from its irreversible initial reaction on the surface of the FeS2 microspheres for a robust buffer layer to alleviate the volume change of FeS2 microspheres during the conversion reaction process.50 The enhancement mechanism for the FeS2@FeSe2 having a better specific capacity and cycle life is schematically shown in Scheme 2. It is known that a porous electrode has a high internal surface area and, therefore, gives high electrochemical rates per apparent unit surface area of the electrode, but the internal area cannot, in general, be completely utilized at high current densities due to the internal effect from mass transfer in the electrolyte and ohmic polarization in the solid phase.51 The lychee-like conductive shell FeSe2-encapsulated less conductive FeS2 core structure (Scheme 2) could significantly improve the ohmic polarization for fast electron transfer, which is supported by the smallest Rct of FeS2@FeSe2 (Fig. S23†). On the other hand, the diffusion thickness of ∼128 μm in the lychee-like structure (D ≈ 1.9 × 10−9 m2 s−1 and T = 298 K) can be determined by  at 1.5 mV s−1, which is much larger than the size of the lychee-like spheres. This means that the electrode is not controlled by the diffusion process and thus there is not too much concentration polarization, making the electrode process act like a surface-controlled reaction on a greatly expanded surface for an extremely rapid electron transport pathway. This is why the FeS2@FeSe2 core–shell structure mainly exhibits the pseudocapacitive behaviors of the redox reaction to offer a high rate capacity and long cycle life. In contrast, plain FeS2 microspheres have a poor conductivity and limit the interface electron transport between microspheres, resulting in low reversible capacity. For plain FeSe2 nanoparticles, its structure will be destroyed followed by the aggregation of nanoparticles, which could lead to losing contact area between the material and the electrolyte during the charging/discharging process, eventually resulting in fast performance decay and short cycle life. Overall, this FeS2@FeSe2 core–shell model structured electrode may reveal an important scientific insight that the structure, size and chemistry of the microsphere play a critical role in electrode kinetics.

Conclusions
In summary, FeS2@FeSe2 core–shell microspheres with an average diameter of 2 μm have been successfully fabricated through a facile two-step hydrothermal reaction. When used as the anode material for SIBs, a high discharge capacity of 350 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 2700 cycles and a remarkable rate performance of 301.5 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 5 A g−1 after 3850 cycles have been achieved. The outstanding rate capacity and ultralong cycle life of FeS2@FeSe2 are attributed to its unique core–shell microsphere structure and chemistry, in which the lychee-like conductive shell FeSe2-encapsulated less conductive FeS2 core structure could significantly improve the ohmic polarization for fast electron transfer, while stocking a uniformly distributed macro-porous spheres-based electrode for fast mass transport. In addition, the shell FeSe2 encapsulating FeS2 can effectively prevent the aggregation of FeS2 for a large reaction surface. The model electrode structure may reveal an important scientific insight that sizes of microspheres less than the diffusion thickness without concentration polarization can make the electrochemical reaction behave like a surface-controlled pseudocapacitive reaction for high rate discharge capacity and long cycle life. This work holds great promise for manufacturing high performance SIBs while offering thoughtful scientific insights into how to rationally design a porous electrode for high rate capacity and long cycle life.
