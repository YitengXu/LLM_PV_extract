    , Accepted 10th June 2019First published on 10th June 2019AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials hold considerable potential in reforming the energy storage performance, and the efficient production of high-performance 2D energy storage materials through facile and sustainable approaches is highly desirable. Herein, for the first time, large-area and ultrathin carbon nanosheets doped with N/O were constructed by stripping bulk chitin via a “top-down” method. On the basis of the specific layered structure composed of nanofibers, chitin samples after removing the protein and CaCO3 could be efficiently exfoliated into nanosheets (CNs) via the hydrothermal method, which were then carbonized into N/O co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (CCNs). The CCNs with a thickness of about 3.8 nm retained the original nanosheet structure consisting of nanofibers, leading to a 2D structure with hierarchical porosities. When used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, the 2D porous nanostructures and abundant N/O doping of CCNs-600 (carbonized at 600 °C) enable a high reversible capacity of 360 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, a good rate capability of 102 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1, and an excellent cycling stability of 140 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles at a high density of 5 A g−1. Full cells consisting of a CCN anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode exhibited favorable rate performance and cycling stability, showing potential application prospects in highly efficient energy storage systems.
1. Introduction
With the booming development of new-energy resources such as solar, wind, and ocean energy, highly efficient energy storage systems are urgently required.1 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been extensively investigated and widely applied in many fields, however, the low abundance of lithium resources has limited their long-term sustainability. In view of this, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as promising alternatives for LIBs owing to the abundant sodium resources and the similarity in physiochemical properties between lithium and sodium.2–6 Nevertheless, synthesizing desirable SIB anodes that can reversibly store Na+ has been a key challenge. Many kinds of materials have been explored as SIB anodes, including metal/alloys,7–9 metal oxides/sulfides,10–13 and carbonaceous materials.14–17 Among these, carbonaceous materials, benefiting from their low cost, abundant resources, high safety and durability, have been extensively investigated.18–20 Various carbon materials, such as hard carbon, soft carbon, porous carbon, and modified graphene, have been developed, showing promising performance in SIBs.21–24
Designing special morphologies with a stable nanostructure and hierarchical porosity is an efficient method to improve the electrochemical performance of carbonaceous materials.15,25 Specifically, two-dimensional (2D) porous nanostructures could provide a high active surface area for ion insertion and continuous conducting pathways for electrons.26 Moreover, their low-dimension structure could shorten the ion-diffusion length and realize fast ion transfer during battery reaction processes, making them ideal anodes for SIB with high rate capability and energy density.27,28 Furthermore, doping heteroatoms (e.g. N, O, S, P) into carbon materials is another popular approach, which could result in enhanced electrical conductivity and increased interlayer spacing for more efficient Na+ storage.29–31 Introducing heteroatoms could also increase the number of active sites and extrinsic defects for capacitive storage, which could effectively improve the specific capacity and rate performance.32–35 However, the current preparation methods to make materials with both a 2D porous nanostructure and heteroatoms normally involve complex and time-consuming procedures, and often lead to environmental pollution. Therefore, the development of a facile and green method to produce heteroatom doped 2D porous carbon materials is a daunting challenge for the scientific community and industry, but holds tremendous potential for high-performance Na+ storage.
Natural polysaccharides have been used as raw materials for manufacturing various sustainable polymer materials, including flexible electronics, resins, microspheres and composites.36–39 It is an attractive approach to fabricate functional materials directly from these polysaccharides via a top-down approach, which could make full use of their natural micro-nanostructures.40,41 For instance, Hu's group has developed an efficient method to directly construct high-performance structural materials from natural wood by removing lignin and hemicellulose.42 Chitin derived from crab and shrimp wastes is a sustainable polymer with abundant resources on the Earth, transforming the chitin into functional materials via a green approach is meaningful and economical.43,44 It is worth noting that chitin possesses a specific layered structure composed of mineralized chitin-protein nanofibers in a plywood pattern with bioceramic-CaCO3.45 Thus, a worthwhile endeavor would be to develop a new top-down method to directly construct chitin nanosheets from purified chitin samples. Herein, for the first time, we developed a simple hydrothermal method to exfoliate layer stacked chitin into chitin nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 1. Chitin with a layered structure could be purified by removing the protein and impurities, to obtain the original layers consisting of chitin nanofibers. The purified chitin powders could be efficiently exfoliated into nanosheets via the hydrothermal method (Fig. 1a and b). The resulting chitin nanosheets (CNs) were carbonized into N/O co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (CCNs), as shown in Fig. 1c. Interestingly, when applied for sodium-ion storage, CCNs exhibited admirable capacity, excellent rate capability and long-term cycling stability at a high current density. Furthermore, the effects of the 2D porous nanostructure and N/O doping on the electrochemical performance were studied and discussed. From this work, we have provided a green and facile method to prepare 2D porous nanosheets with rich N/O doping from natural chitin. The chitin nanosheets have demonstrated good potential to be applied as high-performance anode materials for SIBs.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Chitin powder purified by removing the protein, CaCO3 and impurities was purchased from Golden Shell Biochemical Co. Ltd (Zhejiang, China). Phytic acid (50 wt%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2. Preparation of chitin derived carbon nanosheets (CCNs)
An amount of purified chitin was dispersed into 60 g aqueous solution containing 8 wt% phytic acid, 3 wt% hydrogen peroxide and stirred for 20 min. Then, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 110 °C for 6 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was thoroughly washed with deionized water and then freeze-dried below −50 °C. Subsequently, the freeze-dried chitin nanosheets were pyrolyzed at 600 °C under an argon atmosphere for 2 h with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. The obtained carbon nanosheets were washed with 1 M HCl, deionized water, and ethanol, respectively, and then dried at 60 °C overnight. The carbon nanosheets pyrolyzed at different temperatures were coded as CCNs-500, CCNs-600, CCNs-700, and CCNs-800, respectively. As a contrast, the purified chitin without the hydrothermal process was directly pyrolyzed at 600 °C, and named CC-600.
2.3. Characterization of materials
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss, SIG-MA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, aJEM-2010 (HT), Japan), atomic force microscopy (AFM, AR Cypher-ES), XRD (Rigaku Miniflex600), Raman spectroscopy (RM1000), Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR, FTIR5700), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi) were employed to investigated the morphology, microstructure, and composition of all the samples. Nitrogen physisorption measurements (Autosorb-iQ) were performed to characterize the BET specific surface area and pore size distribution.
2.4. Electrochemical test
In order to prepare the working electrode, 80 wt% active material, 10 wt% conductive carbon black, 5 wt% carboxyl methylcellulose (CMC), and 5 wt% styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) were dispersed in deionized water to form a slurry, and then coated on copper foil. After drying at 80 °C overnight, the copper foil was cut into round slices with the areal mass loading controlled to be 1–2 mg cm−2. The electrochemical performance of the samples was evaluated on half coin-cells (CR2032), which were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox, using sodium metal as the anode, a glass fiber membrane (GF/D, Whatman) as the separator, and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 in volume) with FEC (5%) as the electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests at various scan rates were carried out on a multi-channel potentiate electrochemical workstation (Solartron 1470E). Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were performed by using a Land battery measurement system in 0.01–3 V. The sodium-ion full cells consisted of Na3V2(PO4)3/C as the cathodes and pre-cycled CCNs-600 as the anodes, and the relevant electrochemical performance was tested in 1.5–3.9 V. Pretreatment of the CCNs-600 samples was conducted by several galvanostatic cycles in half cells and then disassembled at the charge state to assemble the full cells. The weight ratio of the two electrodes (anode/cathode) was about 1:2.8.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Construction via the “Top-down” method and characterization of chitin nanosheets (CNs)
As shown in Fig. 1a, native chitin from crab and shrimp possesses a specific layered structure consisting of nanofibers,54 and could be exfoliated into chitin nanosheets. The SEM images of purified chitin after removing the protein and CaCO3 showed that the surface was composed of tightly stacked nanofibers with a uniform diameter of about 10–15 nm, whereas the cross section exhibited a layer-by-layer stacked structure (Fig. 1b). By treating with phytic acid and the oxidizing agent during the hydrothermal process, the layer-like structure of chitin was progressively exfoliated into porous chitin nanosheets (CNs), which was demonstrated by SEM images observed at different reaction times (Fig. S1†). According to the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S4†), the CN sample exhibited a lower decomposition temperature than chitin powder because a part of the crystal structure in chitin was broken during the hydrothermal process. Based on the exfoliation process observed by the SEM images and previously reported work on chemical exfoliation of biomass,55 the stripping mechanism for chitin could be described as follows. When the protein and CaCO3 were removed out, the chitin layer became loose, evidenced by SEM image in Fig. 1b, namely the interlayer forces became relatively weak. Thus, under further hydrothermal treatment, the residual hydrogen bonding force between the layers could be easily destroyed by a dilute acid and hot water whereas the strong packed hydrogen bonds among neighboring nanofibers could be retained to form the nanofibrous chitin nanosheet. The chitin nanosheets were characterized to be of a uniform thickness and size of several to dozens of micrometers as observed by SEM (Fig. 1c). And the surface of the stripped chitin nanosheet displayed a nanofibrous structure, similar to the surface structure of purified chitin, suggesting that the original nanofibrous structure in the raw material remained after the stripping process.
To verify the effect of the layered structure of chitin on the stripping efficiency, a controlled experiment was carried out, in which cellulose from cotton linter pulp was exposed to the same hydrothermal process. The SEM images of cellulose before and after hydrothermal treatment (Fig. S2†) indicated that the fibrous structure of cellulose was partly broken into some fragments but no nanosheets were obtained. The result revealed that the natural layer-by-layer structure of chitin efficiently assisted the exfoliation to form chitin nanosheets, which supported the above conclusion. Therefore, this top-down approach to directly transform chitin into a nanosheet material was successful and highly efficient. Furthermore, the nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurement was employed to investigate the specific surface area (SSA) and the pore size distribution of CNs, in comparison with be the original chitin (Fig. S3†). The results showed a much higher SSA of 51 m2 g−1 and pore volume for CNs than that of original chitin (5.2 m2 g−1), as a result of the largely exposed surface area of CNs after stripping process.
3.2. Characterization of chitin derived carbon nanosheets (CCNs)
The chitin nanosheets were carbonized at 600 °C under an argon atmosphere to prepare the N/O co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (CCNs-600). As displayed in Fig. 2a, the CCNs-600 retained the 2D structure well after carbonization with only a slight shrink in the nanofiber size compared to CNs. Moreover, the nanofibers connected with each other more tightly due to the shrinkage effect during the pyrolysis process to form a continuous sheet architecture (Fig. 2b). The thickness of one single nanosheet was found to be about 3.8 nm by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 2c and f. In the SEM images of CCNs-700 and CCNs-800 (Fig. S5†), a similar 2D nanostructure was observed just like the CCNs-600, but the fiber network began to collapse with the increase of the heating temperature. As a contrast, chitin directly annealed at 600 °C under the same conditions as CCNs-600 (without hydrothermal treatment), named CC-600, showed a bulky morphology and disordered fiber networks on the surface (Fig. S6†). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 2d further confirmed the ultrathin nanosheet structure of CCNs with several micrometers in length, and composed of tightly connected nanofibers. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 2e demonstrated that the CCNs had an amorphous nature with few-layer-stacked graphite nanocrystallites. The average interlayer distances in the microcrystalline areas of different samples were measured as about 0.40, 0.39 and 0.37 nm for CCNs-600, CCNs-700, CCNs-800, respectively, which are presented in the insets of their corresponding HRTEM images, respectively (Fig. 2e and Fig. S8†). As predicted, with an increase in the carbonization temperature, CCNs-600, CCNs-700, and CCNs-800 exhibited decreasing interlayer distances. The enlarged interlayer distance of CCNs-600 was helpful to conquer the energy barrier of Na+ insertion and could facilitate the efficiency of sodium storage.58

The SEM image and corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping of CCNs-600 (Fig. 2g) showed that N and O elements were uniformly distributed in the carbon nanosheets, confirming the homogeneous doping of N and O atoms in CCNs derived from the rich oxygen/nitrogen-containing groups in chitin chains. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of CCN and CC samples are illustrated in Fig. 2h, i, and Fig. S9.† The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (SSA) of CCNs-600 was 262 m2 g−1, which increased significantly to 472 m2 g−1 and 586 m2 g−1 with the rise of the annealing temperature for CCNs-700 and CCNs-800 (Table S1†). The increased specific surface area of CCNs-700 and CCNs-800 mainly attributed to the augment of micropores (<2 nm), which primarily formed from the intense pyrolysis of chitin at a higher heating temperature.68 Despite the distinction in the SSA, the pore size distribution of these carbonized CCNs was quite similar. All these samples exhibited a micropore and small-scale mesopore dominated hierarchical structure with an average pore diameter of 2–3.5 nm (Table S1†). In contrast, the SSA of CC-600 was calculated to be 121 m2 g−1, much lower than that of CCNs-600 because of the limited exposed surface. Generally, a higher SSA and hierarchical structure provide more active sites for sodium storage and allow fast diffusion of electrolyte ions during the charge/discharge process.64,65 The large-area and ultrathin porous nanosheet structure could ensure quick electron transportation and offer continuous contact and reaction sites.59 These features could enhance the specific capacity and rate capability of sodium-ion batteries.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 3a) of all the samples displayed two broad peaks located at around 23° and 44°, corresponding to the (002) and (100) plane of graphite.22 Notably, the position of (002) peaks shifted to a higher degree with the increase of temperature, indicating the decreased interlayer spacing of CCN materials.60 The interlayer distance of CCN samples was calculated from the values of (002) peak centers according to Bragg's equation (Table S1†),46 which was in good accordance with the HRTEM characterization. Raman spectroscopy was employed to analyze the structural disorder of different samples. As shown in Fig. 3b, all spectra exhibited two obvious peaks at 1345 and 1590 cm−1, which were identified as the D band (structural disorder) and G band (graphitic structures), respectively.47 And the broad band at 2900 cm−1 was denoted as the D + G band, corresponding to the overtones of D and G bands. The values of ID/IG gradually increased from 0.75 (CCNs-600) to 0.89 (CCNs-800) with increasing annealing temperature, indicating that more structural disorders and defects appeared at a higher heating temperature. This mainly resulted from the violent decomposition of the oxygen/nitrogen-containing functional groups at a higher pyrolysis temperature.48 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied and the results are shown in Fig. 3c. All the samples exhibited obvious stretching vibrations of CO (1570 cm−1), C–O (1190 cm−1), and H2O (3420 cm−1),46 indicating the abundant quantities and types of oxygen doping in CCNs.

The full X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra in Fig. 3d showed the overall atomic content of C, N, and O in different samples. The percentage of nitrogen and oxygen in CCNs-600, CCNs-700, and CCNs-800 was 9.43 at% and 7.48 at%, 8.12 at% and 6.69 at%, and 6.74 at% and 5.13 at%, respectively. Obviously, the content of N and O decreased with the rise of the carbonization temperature, as a result of the fiercer decomposition of the oxygen and nitrogen-containing functional groups at a higher pyrolysis temperature. This was consistent with the consequence of Raman results. The high resolution N 1s spectra of CCNs-600 are shown in Fig. 3e. The N 1s spectrum could be divided into three peaks located at 398.4 eV, 399.0 eV, and 400.7 eV, attributed to pyridinic nitrogen (N-6), pyrrolic nitrogen (N-5), and quaternary nitrogen (N-Q), respectively.27,49 The N-5 and N-6 moieties should be highly chemically active, and are likely to introduce additional defects and active sites for enhanced capacity,33 and the quaternary nitrogen can enhance electronic conductivity, which favors electron transport during the charge/discharge process (Table S2†).66 It was noted that with an increase of the annealing temperature from 600 to 800 °C, the intensity of pyridinic nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen of CCNs-700 and CCNs-800 decreased when the intensity of quaternary nitrogen was enhanced (Fig. S10†). The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3f) could be distributed into three typical forms of oxygen, C–O– (530.8 eV), –O–H (531.9 eV), and CO (533.2 eV).50 The considerable content of oxygen moieties not only accelerates the capacitive processes but also is in favor of the wetting of electrode materials in the electrolyte.29 As a conclusion of these characterization studies, CCN samples with a rational SSA, hierarchically porous structure, and considerable N/O doping content were obtained. Moreover, the CCN samples pyrolyzed at a higher pyrolysis temperature presented more structural defects/disorder because of the fiercer carbonization process and decomposition of the oxygen/nitrogen-containing functional groups, leading to a reduced N/O doping content. As reported in the literature, abundant N/O doping can improve the conductivity and hydrophilia,66,67 and the specific 2D structure as well as hierarchical porosity offer fast ion transport channels to promote the diffusion of electrolyte ions.65
3.3. Electrochemical performance of CCNs
To investigate the electrochemical performance of CCN and CC-600 samples in sodium storage, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge curves were measured. Fig. 4a and Fig. S11† display the CV curves of CCN and CC-600 electrodes within the voltage range of 0–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. For all the samples, broad cathodic peaks in the range of 0.50–2.00 V were observed in the first cycle and then disappear in the following cycles, due to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and the reaction between Na+ and surface functional groups.51 The cathodic peaks at around 0.01 V were attributed to the insertion of sodium-ions into the graphene-like planes and the nanovoids formed by the amorphous planes.61 The charge/discharge profiles for CCN and CC-600 electrodes at a current density of 50 mA g−1 (Fig. 4b and Fig. S11†) indicated that the initial reversible capacity of CCNs-600 was 360 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, much higher than those of CCNs-700 (250 mA h g−1), CCNs-800 (265 mA h g−1), and CC-600 (235 mA h g−1). The higher capacity of CCNs-600 was related to its more abundant N/O doping and enlarged interlayer space (Fig. 3), which could enhance the storing capacity for sodium both at the surface and in the graphite interlayers. The higher capacity of CCNs-600 than CC-600 was mainly due to the specifically hierarchical porosity and 2D structure of CCNs, which allowed the exposure of much more active surface area, thus providing increased reaction and storage sites for sodium-ions. For further comparison, the CCNs-500 sample (Fig. S7†) was prepared and the related electrochemical properties were tested. As shown in Fig. S14,† CCNs-500 exhibited admirable rate capability and cycling stability like other CCN samples. However, CCNs-500 presents a lower capacity than CCNs-600 because of its inferior conductivity and carbonization degree at a lower pyrolysis temperature, which further convinced the superiority of CCNs-600. Apart from the reversible capacity, initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) is also an important parameter in the assessment of anode materials for practical applications. As shown in Fig. 4b and Fig. S11,† the CCNs-600 exhibited an ICE of 47%, higher than that of CCNs-700 (39.92%), CCNs-800 (39.33%), and CC-600 (36.82%). The irreversible capacity loss resulted from the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, the irreversible reaction between Na+ and surface functional groups and other side reactions.28 Actually, the ICE of CCNs-600 was comparable or higher than other reported porous carbon materials with a high specific surface area,14,28,46,52 but it is still unable to satisfy the demand for practical application. Hence, to further improve the ICE, the CCNs-600 electrode was electrically pretreated in the electrolyte before assembling into the cell. After pretreatment, the ICE of CCNs-600 was improved to 74.7% (Fig. S12†). Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling was further employed to investigate the rate performance of CCNs and CC-600 samples. As shown in Fig. 4c, the CCNs-600 exhibited higher capacities at all the current densities from 0.05 to 10 A g−1. In particular, at the high current density of 10 A g−1, the CCNs-600 retained a reversible capacity of 102 mA h g−1, and when the current density recovered to 50 mA g−1, a reversible capacity over 320 mA h g−1 was obtained, demonstrating the excellent rate capability. It was worth noting that all the CCN samples displayed a much higher capacity than CC-600 at a high current density, as the capacity of CC-600 decreased to nearly 0 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1, indicating the superior rate performance of 2D carbon nanosheets than the bulky carbon. This further demonstrates the importance of the 2D porous structure for fast and efficient sodium storage, especially at a very high current density.

Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded to analyze the charge storage kinetics of the electrodes. In the Nyquist plots (Fig. S13†), all samples showed semicircles in the high frequency range and sloping straight lines in the low frequency region, corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and solid-state diffusion of ions in the electrode, respectively. The fitted equivalent circuits and corresponding fitting values of the Nyquist plots (Schematic S1 and Table S3†) indicated that CCNs-600 exhibited the smallest charge transfer resistance (92.45 Ω), revealing the fast charge-transfer kinetics of the CCNs-600 electrode. Even though the CCNs-600 electrode displayed a lower electrical conductivity (Table S2†) and specific surface area (Table S1†) as compared to the CCNs-700/CCNs-800 electrode, more nitrogen/oxygen-containing moieties in the CCNs-600 electrode can enhance the surface adsorption/desorption and surface-redox reaction, facilitating the fast charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface.29,33 The detailed Na storage mechanism for CCN electrodes would be further discussed below.
Cycling performance of the CCNs sample was investigated through galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling. As displayed in Fig. S15,† all of the CCN-samples retained considerable cycling stability under 0.5 A g−1, and the CCNs-600 electrode retained a reversible capacity of 210 mA h g−1 after 2500 cycles. Cycling performances of CCN and CC-600 samples were further investigated and compared at a higher current density of 2 A g−1. As depicted in Fig. S17,† all CCN samples retained their incipient capacity after 800 cycles without any decay, exhibiting excellent cycling stability. However, the capacity of the CC-600 sample slowly decreased in the first 100 cycles and gradually stabilized after 200 cycles, revealing its slightly inferior cycling durability than the CCN samples.
The ultralong-term cycling performance of the CCNs-600 electrode at a large current density of 5 A g−1 was further investigated. As shown in Fig. 4d, benefiting from the activation process of the porous electrode,56,57 the reversible capacity was slowly increased in the initial 2000 cycles and stabilized at about 140 mA h g−1, and no obvious capacity decay was observed even after 10000 cycles. The cycling performance of CCNs-600 at a higher current density (10 A g−1) was also studied, as shown in Fig. S16.† No obvious capacity fading was observed after 2000 cycles, showing the admirable cycling stability at an ultra-high current density.

Fig. 4e shows the charge/discharge curves of CCNs-600 at various current densities from 0.05 to 5 A g−1. Interestingly, the discharge curves of the CCNs-600 exhibited near-sloping lines with a variable slope, and a considerable capacity was delivered within the voltage range of over 1.0 V, which was different from the reported typical discharge curves of hard carbon that contain a slope region and plateau region.18,52 This could be attributed to the combination of diffusion-controlled (Na+ insertion/extraction) and capacitive-controlled sodium storage mechanisms.62 To verify this, CV curves at various scan rates from 0.2 to 10 mV s−1 were measured and the ratio of capacitive contribution was calculated to discuss the sodium storage mechanism of CCNs. The CV curves of CCN electrodes from 0.2 to 10 mV s−1 are displayed in Fig. 5a and Fig. S18.† Generally, the CV curves with nearly rectangular shapes indicate the capacitive dominated storage behavior, whereas the CV curves with redox peaks reveal the diffusion-controlled storage mode.63 Obviously, the CV curves of CCNs exhibited the features of both capacitive and diffusion storage, and with the rise of the scan rate, the shapes of CV curves became more rectangular, indicating the enhanced capacitive storage behavior at a high scan rate. The calculated capacitive contribution at the scan rate from 0.2 to 10 mV s−1 for different CCN electrodes is listed in Fig. 5b, c and Fig. S18.† The percent of capacitive storage of the CCNs-600 was clearly higher than those of CCNs-700 and CCNs-800, and the capacitive contribution of all samples increased with the increase of the scan rate, indicating that the capacitive energy storage was predominant at high rates, consistent with the discussion results of the CV curves. Therefore, it could be concluded that the N/O doping played an important role in boosting the capacitive storage, more abundant N/O doping tends to contribute to high-proportioned capacitive storage. Moreover, capacitive storage behavior was largely enhanced at a high scan rate whereas the portion of diffusion storage was weakened, due to the more sluggish diffusion kinetics of Na+ diffusion. In view of these results, a schematic illustration of sodium storage mechanisms in the CCNs-600 electrode is proposed in Fig. 5d, where the rich N/O doping and admirable specific surface area enabled the fast surface-adsorption/desorption and surface-redox reaction, which guaranteed the efficient capacitive storage for sodium, especially at a high scan rate. Besides, the enlarged interlayer space in CCNs-600 ensured the considerable diffusion storage based on the intercalation/deintercalation of sodium-ions. In a word, the combination of capacitive storage and diffusion storage avoided the monotonous and slow sodium-ion diffusion behavior and thus prevented the structural damage at a high scan rate, leading to the high specific capacity, good rate performance and excellent cycling stability. As shown in Fig. 5e, the CCNs-600 presented a comparable or higher Na+ storage performance than other carbon materials reported in high impact literature studies.23,28,29,31,46,53

To clarify the practical application prospect of the CCNS-600, a full-cell composed of the CCNs-600 anode and Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode was assembled (Fig. 6a). The Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode provided a reversible capacity of about 100 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.5 A g−1 with a voltage platform of 3.4 V (Fig. S19†). Fig. 6b shows initial charge–discharge profiles in the voltage window of 1.5–3.9 V at 0.2 A g−1. The first discharge and charge capacity were 249.8 and 270.2 mA h g−1 (based on anode mass), respectively, delivering a high coulombic efficiency of 92.4%. No obvious voltage platform was observed in the curves, demonstrating that the full cell works based on the capacitive storage mechanism mostly, thus contributing to a superior rate performance and favorable cycling performance of the full cell. Due to these superior properties, the cell exhibited an admirable specific capacity of over 200 mA h g−1 at 0.1 Ag−1 and a good rate capability of 130 mA h g−1 at 2 Ag−1 (Fig. 6c). When cycled at 0.1 Ag−1, a relative stable capacity of 150 mA h g−1 could be achieved after 100 cycles with the coulombic efficiency approaching more than 98% (Fig. 6d). The inset image in Fig. 6d exhibits the lighted LED (luminous diode) powered by the assembled coin cell. These results indicated that the N/O doped carbon nanosheets hold considerable application prospects as anodes for SIBs.

4. Conclusions
On the basis of the specific layered structure composed of nanofibers in natural chitin, a new “top-down” method was developed, for the first time, to directly construct chitin nanosheets by stripping bulk chitin. In our findings, a simple hydrothermal method was applied to exfoliate the chitin with a layer-like structure into porous chitin nanosheets, while maintaining the original layers consisting of chitin nanofibers, and the exfoliation mechanism is illustrated. The chitin nanosheets (CNs) were carbonized into N/O doped porous 2D ultrathin carbon nanosheets (CCNs) with a hierarchical porous structure. When used as the anode material of a sodium-ion battery, the high specific surface area and rich N/O doping of CCNs-600 ensured a high reversible capacity, and the 2D structure and hierarchical porosity guaranteed a good rate performance (102 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1) and cycling stability at high rate charge/discharge (140 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1). Briefly, the enhanced sodium storage performance of the CCN electrode was mainly attributed to the ideal combination of the 2D nanostructure, reasonable specific surface area, hierarchical porosity, and the rich N/O doping. This study provides a novel pathway to produce N/O doped carbon nanosheets from a sustainable polymer, chitin, and demonstrated their application prospect as high-performance sodium-ion anode materials.
