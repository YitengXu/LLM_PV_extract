    , Accepted 15th October 2018First published on 18th October 2018AbstractA Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO composite of Pt nanoparticles (NPs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and polydopamine (PDA) has been obtained on indium tin oxide glass (ITO). Firstly, a rGO/PDA@ITO composite of rGO and PDA on ITO was formed by immersing ITO into a dopamine solution at room temperature and then a graphene oxide (GO) suspension solution in a water bath at 60 °C for 3 h. Ag NPs were then deposited on the rGO/PDA@ITO surface by immersing rGO/PDA@ITO in an AgNO3 aqueous solution with the aid of ascorbic acid. Finally, Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO was obtained by immersing Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO in a platinum tetrachloride solution in the presence of ascorbic acid. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Pt NPs has been found at 260 nm from UV-visible spectra. Cyclic voltammetry curves of Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO and UV absorption peaks of the Pt NPs implied that the sample with the strongest LSPR is the optimal electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation. Cyclic voltammetry of Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO showed that the ratio of current intensity between the forward scan and reverse scan peaks (If/Ib) was 1.768, indicating the remarkable anti-poison property of Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO as an electrocatalyst. Its electrochemical active surface area can reach 2.60 m2 g−1 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. It was found that the current decreased only 38.7% after 200 cycles. The better stability also confirmed the superior tolerance of carbon monoxide and catalytic activity.
1. Introduction
As one of the typical representatives of metal nanomaterials, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect has played an important role in optical sensing.1–4 In recent years, there have been several excellent articles describing that some electrochemical processes can be accelerated by plasmonic nanoparticles upon LSPR excitation,4–6 however, its application in electrochemistry needs further research. Noble metal nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention in many fields7–10 because of their abundant and tunable optical properties. Platinum has also been widely investigated.2,11–13 There is a variety of practical applications specifically for Pt nanoparticles (NPs),14 such as the reduction of pollutant gases exhausted from automobiles,15 and fuel cells.16,17 Particularly, Pt NPs have the highest activity toward the dissociative adsorption of methanol,18 which can be used for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). The DMFC relies upon the oxidation of methanol on a catalyst layer to form carbon dioxide and it is ideal for portable electronic devices and military applications because of its excellent energy conversion efficiency, low operating temperature, low noise, thermal signatures, lack of toxic effluent and so on.19 The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) so far has been intensively investigated.20–24 However, it remains a challenge to satisfy the commercialization requirements due to the lower electrocatalytic oxidation activity of methanol at low temperatures and the serious cathodic activation along with methanol penetration.25 Therefore, it is of great significance to study anode catalysts with stable poisoning resistance to carbon monoxide and good methanol catalytic oxidation activity. At present, considerable research has reported on gold and silver nanomaterials,26,27 which have significant LSPR absorption peaks and can modulate light at the nanoscale level.12,28–30 They have been widely used in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, plasma waveguides, molecular sensors, thermal radiation sources, antennas and solar cells. Furthermore, a previous study pointed out that the optimal catalytic performance of 4-nitrophenol was accompanied by the strongest LSPR of Au/PDA@glass catalysis.29 On the contrary, Pt NPs have rarely been reported, probably because they are difficult to synthesize and there is no obvious optical absorption peak in visible regions.11,31 Therefore, it is still necessary to utilize the platinic LSPR effect more reasonably for applications. Much work has focused on the LSPR effect of platinum with different sizes, for example, Xu et al. described for the first time that the optical absorption peak of Pt NPs less than 10 nm in the visible region was successfully controlled by changing the near field and dielectric environment of Pt NPs,31 which also provided ideas for later research. Pt NPs are usually synthesized by the reduction of platinum precursors in solution with stabilizing and reducing agents,12,25,26,32 among which sodium borohydride, hydrazine and ethylene glycol are most toxic and harmful to the environment. In contrast, ascorbic acid has been widely used due to the advantage of its mild reduction ability and non-toxic characteristic.33
Dopamine (DA), possessing the catecholamine and phenethylamine functional groups, can be oxidized to a polydopamine (PDA) film briefly by self-polymerization under weak alkaline conditions (pH = 8.5).34 The reducibility and striking adhesion capacity of PDA means that it can generally apply to a variety of solid substrates for surface modification.35,36 Furthermore, PDA can be used in the surface modification of Au and Pt NPs, carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide.37–39 Graphene sheets have been intensively investigated in the field of optics and electrocatalysis because of their superior physical and chemical properties.40 For example, graphene can be used as a support material for the dispersion of NPs and biomolecules due to its large surface area and rich π conjugation structure, making it a suitable dielectric top layer for LSPR sensing.
Herein, we designed an approach for the synthesis of Pt NPs using PDA, a reducing reaction and a chemical replacement reaction. Experimental results show that the Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO composite possesses the best catalytic performance for methanol when its LSPR peak is strongest.
2. Experimental
2.1 Reagents and materials
Single face ITO slices (10 mm × 15 mm × 1.1 mm, with a resistivity of 5 Ω) were obtained from Luoyang Guluo Grass Co., Ltd. Quartz slices (8 mm × 25 mm × 1.0 mm) were obtained from Donghai County Alfa Quartz Products Co., Ltd. Ammonia solution (NH3·H2O) was received from Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd. Ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.7%), anhydrous methyl alcohol (CH3OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 99.5%) were obtained from Beijing Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. Dopamine hydrochloride (DA, 98%) and platinum tetrachloride (PtCl4, 57.8%) were obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Silver nitrate (AgNO3) and ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) were obtained from Damao chemical reagent factory and Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, respectively. The chemical substances above were used as received with analytical grade, and deionized water was used in all solution preparation.
2.2 Preparation of samples and determination of optimal conditions

2.2.1 Synthesis of PDA film on a quartz slice (PDA@QS). 
Firstly, quartz slices were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water to dislodge impurities and another contaminant. Then, 0.5 mol L−1 NaOH solution was injected dropwise into 20 mg mL−1 dopamine solution to adjust the pH to 8.5. Subsequently, these slices were immersed into the dopamine solution vertically for 0.5–1.5 h at room temperature. After this, the samples were rinsed with deionized water lightly and dried in air. At last, the polydopamine film on quartz slices (PDA@QS) was obtained.


2.2.2 Synthesis of the composite of rGO and PDA@QS (rGO/PDA@QS). 
GO powder was synthesized by the modified Hummers method.41,42 A homogeneous GO solution was obtained with a light brown color after ultrasonication for 2 h, and then the upper part of PDA@QS was immersed in the GO suspension and reacted in a water bath at 60 °C for 3 h to obtain rGO/PDA@QS.


2.2.3 Synthesis of a composite of Ag and rGO/PDA@QS (Ag/rGO/PDA@QS). 
The rGO/PDA@QS sample obtained in the previous step was immersed in 3 mL AgNO3 solution for 1 h with the aid of ascorbic acid (10 μL, 0.1 mol L−1) at room temperature.


2.2.4 Synthesis of Pt NPs on Ag/rGO/PDA@QS (Pt/rGO/PDA@QS). 
Ag/rGO/PDA@QS was immersed into PtCl4 solution in the presence of 0.05 mL 0.1 mol L−1 of ascorbic acid in a water bath at 60 °C for 1 h, then annealed for 1 h at 200 °C. Pt/rGO/PDA@QS was thus synthesized.


2.2.5 Three-level orthogonal experimental method. 
An orthogonal experimental method of three factors at three levels (L9 (34)) was used to explore the dopamine soaking time and concentration of GO and AgNO3. The method is provided in Table 1, and the optimal experimental condition was confirmed via the strongest LSPR peak.

2.2.6 Synthesis of a composite of Pt NPs, rGO, and PDA on ITO (Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO). 
The ITO slices were ultrasonically cleaned in ammonia water (a volume ratio of 1:3), ethanol, and deionized water. After that the synthesis procedure of Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO was the same as that of Pt/rGO/PDA@QS, only the quartz slice substrate was changed to an ITO slice substrate. The synthesis procedures of PDA on ITO (PDA@ITO), rGO on PDA@ITO (rGO/PDA@ITO), and Ag NPs on rGO/PDA@ITO (Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO) were also the same as those of PDA@QS, rGO/PDA@QS, and Ag/rGO/PDA@QS, respectively, only the quartz slice was changed with an ITO slice.
In order to analyze the relationship between LSPR and catalytic performance, Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO synthesised under different experimental conditions were named Pi2, Pi3, Pi4, Pi7 and Pi9 and were synthesized under the same experimental conditions as P2, P3, P7, P4 and P9, respectively, only the quartz slice was changed to an ITO slice.

2.3 Characterization
Local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra were investigated using a Hitachi U-3310 spectrophotometer in the detection range of 200–600 nm. The microcosmic morphology and elementary composition of the samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM430, Nova Nano, USA) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The surface morphology of the composites was further characterized using a high resolution transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100). The surface phase structure and crystallographic properties of the samples were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Bruker, Germany) at a scanning rate of 5° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained using a Model PHI 5300 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Physical Electronics, USA) operated at 250 W Mg K (λ = 0.9891 nm). Raman spectra were recorded using a Micro Confocal Laser Raman Spectrometer (inVia Reflex, Renishaw, Britain) with a laser wavelength of 514.5 nm and a spectral resolution of 1 cm−1.
2.4 Electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation
The electrochemistry workstation (CHI 660C, Shanghai) was used to evaluate the electrochemical performance.43 Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO was used as working electrodes and a platinum sheet and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and a reference electrode, respectively. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and cycle stability of the catalysts were tested in 0.25 mol L−1 H2SO4 solution and a mixed solution containing 30 mL of 2.0 mol L−1 CH3OH and 30 mL of 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 solution after blowing N2 to the electrolyte for 15 min, respectively. The range of the measurement voltage was −0.2 to 1.0 V.
3. Results and discussion
In this work, Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO composites were obtained by a replacement reduction process. As an indispensable surface-adherent and multifunctional biopolymer, PDA played a dual role between substrate and NPs. Moreover, the dispersity of the NPs has been greatly improved with the assistant of GO. The morphology and composition of the samples were determined by SEM, TEM, EDS, XRD, and XPS. The LSPR effect was stimulated by UV-vis spectroscopy, and the electrochemical properties of the composite were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV).
3.1 LSPR of samples
The UV-vis spectra were used to confirm the absorption peaks of the samples as shown in Fig. 1. The LSPR absorption peaks of the Pt/rGO/PDA@QS composite are shown in Fig. 1. The strongest LSPR peak is that of P7 at 260 nm. Thus, the optical condition is determined: dopamine soaking time is 1.5 h, the concentration of graphene is 0.1 mg mL−1 and the concentration of silver nitrate is 0.3 mol L−1.

3.2 Morphology and composition analysis

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of ITO (the side containing ITO) (a), PDA@ITO (the side containing ITO) (b), rGO/PDA@ITO (PI7) (the side containing ITO) (c), the reverse side of PI7 (the side not containing ITO) (d), Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO (the side containing ITO) (e), and Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO (PI7) (the side containing ITO) (f). Irregular bulges are observed on the ITO slide as shown in Fig. 2a. There are some subtle changes on the ITO surface after PDA and rGO coating as shown in Fig. 2b and c: in the ITO gaps a sheet-like shadow appeared, but the morphology of the graphene films cannot be observed. In contrast, the obvious folds on the reverse side of rGO/PDA@ITO in Fig. 2d show that large-area graphene films have been deposited on the surface successfully. Fig. 2e shows an SEM image of Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO, in which the Ag NPs were dispersed on the rGO thin film with an average diameter of 65 nm using a Nano Measurer 1.2. In addition, from Fig. 2f and inset, the Pt nanocrystals distribute on the ITO surface randomly with an average diameter of 100 nm. The details of surface morphology will be provided in Fig. 5.

All the samples were synthesized under the optimal condition: dopamine soaking time is 1.5 h, the concentration of graphene is 0.1 mg mL−1 and the concentration of silver nitrate is 0.3 mol L−1. 
The compositions of Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO and Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO (PI7) were also analyzed by EDS as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3g1 and g2 correspond to the selected square areas 1 and 2 of Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3g. The content of Ag in Fig. 3g1 was higher than that in Fig. 3g2, which demonstrated that Ag NPs were deposited on the ITO surface inhomogeneously. Fig. 3h1 and h2 correspond to the selected square areas 1 and 2 of Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO (PI7), respectively, as shown in Fig. 3h. The results illustrate the generation of Ag and Pt NPs, which is consistent with the observation of the SEM images in Fig. 2. The generation of Pt NPs was mainly attributed to the substitution reaction of Ag NPs. Additionally, the chlorine element detected in Fig. 3h1 was from silver chloride (AgCl).

The crystallization state of the composites was characterized by XRD as shown in Fig. 4. Curve (a) is the XRD curve of the ITO slice. The sharp peaks present at 2θ = 35.466°, 51.037°, and 60.676° can be indexed to (400), (440), and (622) of In2O3 (JCPDS 06-0416). Curve (b) shows 5 peaks at 2θ = 38.116°, 44.277°, 64.426°, 77.472°, and 81.536°, corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) of cubic silver (JCPDS 04-0783), respectively. Curve (c) in Fig. 4 has several peaks at 2θ = 39.763°, 46.243°, 67.454° and 81.286°, which can be well-indexed to (111), (200), (220), and (311) of cubic Pt (JCPDS 04-0802), respectively. Furthermore, the peaks of Ag in curve (b) have vanished from the XRD pattern of Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO, which confirms the replacement of Ag by Pt.

TEM was carried out to further characterize the surface morphology, and the crystal structures were characterized by HRTEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The TEM morphologies of PDA, rGO and Ag NPs in Fig. 5a–c are consistent with SEM (Fig. 2) observations, and the lattice fringes in Fig. 5d were measured to be 0.24 nm, which can be assigned to the (111) reflections of Ag. From the SAED image (inset of Fig. 5d), we can see some diffraction rings corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) plane families of cubic silver.44 As shown in Fig. 5e and the inset, many small spherical Pt NPs with a diameter of about 10 nm aggregated to form flower-like nanostructures (about 100 nm), and the lattice fringes of 0.22 nm can be indexed as (111) of Pt in Fig. 5f. The bright concentric rings in the SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 5f) can be perpendicular to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes, suggesting the polycrystalline nature of the flower-like Pt nanocrystals.

Raman spectroscopy has been used to analyze structural and electronic properties of carbon materials.45 Raman spectra of the GO powder and the rGO/PDA@ITO, Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO, and Pt/Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO composites were measured with a 532 nm Ar+ laser within the range of 500–2000 cm−1 excitation wavelength.
There are two peaks in the graph in Fig. 6: an intense D peak at 1365 cm−1 and a highly intense G peak at 1600 cm−1. It is known that the ratio between the intensity of D and G peaks (ID/IG) usually can be used to evaluate the disorder degree of the graphene structure.40,46Table 2 lists the ratios of D peaks and G peaks (ID/IG) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal intensities of GO powder, rGO/PDA@ITO, Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO, and Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO. The result reveals that ID/IG of Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO is higher than that of rGO/PDA@ITO, which can promote the transformation of carbon atoms from sp3 hybridization to sp2 hybridization. The ratio then decreased rapidly again, indicating that a reduction reaction occurred between silver and platinum tetrachloride.47,48 It should be pointed out that the Raman signal intensity of Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO is 8.57 times than that of GO, which is supported by the fact that silver nanoparticles have a significantly enhanced Raman signal compared to GO.47

The high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s (Fig. 7a) can help to further prove the wrapping of PDA on the ITO slice. The N 1s region is split into two peak components: one dominant peak located at 399.19 eV corresponds to the N–H bond from the amine groups in the heterocycle of PDA and another at 398.17 eV is attributed to the –N species, arising from the pyridine-like structure of PDA.18 The C 1s spectra of GO in Fig. 7b shows four components corresponding to carbon species, which could be deconvoluted into different functional groups: C–C (283.69 eV), C–N (284.3 eV), C–O (285.29 eV), and CO (287.37 eV), proving GO coverage.49 The presence of the C–N binding energy at 284.3 eV further confirmed the presence of the PDA coating50 and the result is in good agreement with the N 1s XPS spectra. The appearance of a new peak of 285.8 eV, consistent with the C–N species, indicates the grafting of DA on GO sheets. The result indicates that the GO was successfully embedded into the PDA film.32 The XPS spectrum of Ag 3d shows two peaks at 366.75 eV (3d5/2) and 372.75 eV (3d3/2) split with a spin–orbit separation of 6.0 eV,51 which is indicative of elemental metal Ag.52

(e) XPS survey spectra of different composites: rGO/PDA@ITO (black line), Ag/rGO/PDA@ITO (red line), and Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO (blue line). All the samples were synthesized under the optimal condition. 
For the Pt 4f XPS spectra, there are two main peaks located at 70.04 eV (Pt 4f7/2) and 73.39 eV (Pt 4f5/2) with a spin–orbit separation of 3.35 eV, ascribed to the metallic Pt.16 The other two relatively weaker ones situated at 70.96 eV and 74.58 eV with a spin–orbit separation of 3.62 eV, assigned to Pt oxide, such as Pt(OH)2 and PtO, are supported by those of pure bulk platinum.50 Based on the results, we believe that the Pt NPs have been successfully modified on rGO/PDA@ITO. In addition, as shown in Fig. 7e, a detectable Ag 3d peak and a Cl 2p peak in the survey spectrum of the Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO composite are likely due to the generation of AgCl during the displacement reaction and this is consistent with the EDS observation in Fig. 3h.
3.3 Electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation
Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and tolerance to carbonaceous species were critical indicators for evaluation of catalysts.17 A higher value of If/Ib indicates more effective removal of poisonous carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface.15,28 As described in some literature, carbon material corrosion of the Pt/C catalyst and a lower ratio of If/Ib (<1) increased the poisoning by carbonaceous species resulting in a reduction of electrocatalysis stability.19,53,54 Each of the samples were evaluated in a three-electrode system, and before the test nitrogen was purged for 15 minutes to remove oxygen dissolved in the solution. The ECSA of the catalysts was calculated according to the following eqn (1). The charge QH was measured by the hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks, the value of 210 μC cm−2 corresponds to the amount of charge required for monolayer H2 oxidized on platinum surfaces,55 and m is the actual Pt loading on the electrode.56 (1)
As shown in Fig. 8a, the CV curves for the Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO catalysts were obtained in 0.25 mol L−1 H2SO4 electrolyte at room temperature and typical hydrogen adsorption and desorption peaks were observed in the potential region −0.2 to 0.4 V (vs. SCE), which are shown as a list in Table 3. The ECSA of PI7 was calculated to be 2.6 m2 g−1, which was much larger than that of others. The electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation was explored in a mixture of 30 mL 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 solution and 30 mL 2 mol L−1 CH3OH solution, as shown in Fig. 8b. The CV curves displayed two well-defined oxidation peaks: one methanol oxidation peak appeared at 0.68 V in the forward scan and a peak corresponding to the oxidation reaction of carbonaceous species appeared at 0.46 V in the reverse scan, consistent with literature reports for the oxidation of methanol.16,37,50,57 In addition, the If/Ib ratio of PI7 (1.768) was much higher than those of PI2 (1.2), PI3 (1.145), PI4 (1.467) and PI9 (1.423) and the reference (1.17),46 the results meaning that PI7 had a better anti-poisoning performance for methanol oxidation,58 which coincided with the ESCA values in Table 3. The difference in catalytic performance of the five samples was probably due to the specific morphologies, which are shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9a–e are the SEM images of samples PI2, PI3, PI4, PI7, and PI9, respectively. The distribution of Pt NPs in Fig. 9a and c is uneven and in Fig. 9b and e the Pt NPs are densely distributed without any gap. In contrast, the distribution in Fig. 9d is relatively uniform with a certain gap. The strongest plasmon resonance peak indicated the excellent catalytic performance for methanol. Furthermore, Fig. 8c showed that the addition of silver significantly improved the catalytic performance of Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO.

3.4 Electrocatalytic stability for methanol oxidation
Cyclic voltammetry has been used to characterize the stability of the catalyst. Fig. 10a shows a series of CVs of Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO (PI7) with increasing cycle number. Fig. 10b presents the relationship of normalized current and cycle number. Normalized current (%) is the percentage of the peak current of the 200th cycle compared to the maximum peak current. It was found that the current decreases by 38.7% after 200 cycles. The reduction of current is due to the formation of carbon monoxide intermediate species on the Pt catalyst surface during the methanol oxidation reaction.46 The better stability also confirms the superior tolerance of carbon monoxide and catalytic activity for methanol catalysis. In addition, the morphology of the catalyst changed after the stability test as observed in Fig. 11, which can describe the degradation of catalytic performance. In the beginning, Pt particles are tightly distributed between the rGO with a porous structure in Fig. 11a. After 200 cycles, as can be seen in Fig. 11b, the distance between Pt particles increased and some flaky cracks appeared on the catalyst surface, possibly because the structure of rGO had been destroyed during multiple tests, and the situation is similar to that in the literature.59 The result also proved that the addition of graphene oxide can increase the catalytic performance of the Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO composite effectively.

3.5 The relationship between methanol concentration and oxidation peak current
The effect of the methanol concentration on oxidation peak current has also been investigated. Fig. 12a and b show the relationship between oxidation peak current and methanol concentration at a range of 0.25 to 2.5 mol L−1 on the Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO electrode. Fig. 12a indicates that the oxidation peak current of methanol increased with increasing methanol concentration. The electrocatalytic current of methanol shows a good linear relationship with methanol concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1 mol L−1, with a linear correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.99. However, the current decreases when the methanol concentration exceeds 1 mol L−1, as shown in Fig. 12b, mainly due to the enhanced interaction between the methanol molecules which reduces methanol diffusion on the catalyst surface.

Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO was synthesized under the same experimental conditions as PI7. 
3.6 Effect of scanning rate on electro-oxidation of methanol
The reaction characteristics of methanol on Pt/rGO/PDA@ITO (PI7) were analyzed by varying the scan rate and the corresponding voltammograms are shown in Fig. 13a. The forward peak potential Ep increased with the scan rate (ν), and another linear relationship with a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.9939 between Ep and lnν is obtained as can be seen in Fig. 13b, which suggests that the oxidation of methanol is an irreversible process (described precisely by eqn (2)).60,61 (2)where α represents the electron transfer coefficient, characterizing the effect of electrochemical potential on the activation energy for an electrochemical reaction. The obtained slope of Epvs. ln(ν) in this study is 24.6 mV, and according to the ref. 46 and 62, n equals 1.3. Thus, α can be calculated as 0.539, which is higher than that of ref. 46 (0.34). Additionally, the relationship between the forward peak current density (Ip) and the square root of the scan rate (ν1/2) is presented in Fig. 13c and a linear relationship (R2 = 0.9858) is clearly observed, suggesting that the oxidation of methanol belongs to a diffusion process.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a method was successfully developed for the preparation of a Pt nanocomposite by self-polymerization of dopamine and a replacement reaction. The excellent adsorption and reduction properties of dopamine provide a prerequisite for the experiment. Moreover, after modification with graphene oxide, the dispersibility of the Pt nanoparticles and electronic conductivity of the Pt nanocomposite as a catalyst were improved. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the Pt NPs are spherical particles with a diameter of 10 nm. The UV-visible absorption spectrum shows that the surface plasmon resonance of Pt nanoparticles is about 260 nm. Cyclic voltammetry tests show that the Pt composite has good methanol catalytic properties with an If/Ib value of 1.768, and the retention of 61.3% of the current after 200 cycles indicates that the catalyst has good stability. The experimental results also imply that the better catalytic performance of the Pt composite for methanol oxidation corresponds to a stronger surface plasmon resonance. In addition, the catalyst is easily recycled as it is prepared on a substrate. These unique properties make it promising for application in sensors, medical diagnostics, and the fuel cell field.
