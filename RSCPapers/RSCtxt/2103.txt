    , Accepted 13th June 2019First published on 15th June 2019AbstractThe development of an ultrastable and efficient technology for H2 production is an important step in the utilization of renewable and clean energy. Herein, we report that hybrid water electrolysis, integrating the electrochemical reforming of benzyl alcohol (BA) and the H2 evolution reaction (HER), largely accelerates the kinetics and stability of H2 production over a hierarchical bifunctional catalyst couple of Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticles in 1.0 M KOH. The high-performance of the hierarchical Mo–Ni nanoparticle catalyst for both the HER and the BA oxidation not only eliminated the need for an ion-conducting membrane to separate the cathodic and anodic reactions to achieve nearly unity faradaic efficiences for the two reactions, but also allowed the reactions to be readily driven by low cell voltage in a two-electrode configuration. Specifically, the cell voltages required to deliver the benchmark current densities of 20, 50, and 100 mA cm−2 are as low as 1.40, 1.45, and 1.53 V, respectively. The membrane-free hybrid water electrolysis technology exhibits a set of advantages including long device lifetime, ease of H2 collection, and high efficiency, thus showing significant promise for practical H2 production, especially considering the fact that the device can be readily powered by a single-cell alkaline battery or a solar cell under natural sunlight irradiation.
Introduction
The ability to achieve ultrastable and efficient H2 evolution is of great significance because H2 has been considered as a green energy carrier and an important chemical feedstock.1,2 The widespread use of H2 energy not only can alleviate our dependency on fossil fuels, but also provides a much needed solution to environmental issues caused by the large-scale consumption of fossil fuels.3–5 In recent years, electrochemical water splitting has attracted significant attention due to its ability to produce high-purity H2. However, this strategy is hindered by the need for precious catalysts for improving the kinetics and efficiency towards both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).6–8 Although the cost of electrocatalysts can be lowered using innovative earth-abundant catalysts, such as those based on transition-metal chalcogenides, phosphides, and alloys,9–15 the rate of H2 production is intrinsically limited by the sluggish kinetics of the OER.16,17 Additional disadvantages of the abovementioned method include low overall energy conversion efficiency, production of low-value O2 at the anode, and the potential of collection of the explosive mixture H2/O2.18,19
To address the abovementioned problems, the OER has been replaced with a thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reaction to achieve hybrid water electrolysis.20–26 Currently, the electrochemical reforming of small organic compounds, such as the oxidation of glycerol, ethanol, furfural, glucose, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, isopropanol, and furfural, has been proven effective as a candidate reaction for integration with the HER.27–46 Compared to pure water electrocatalytic splitting, the hybrid water electrolysis strategy offers a set of advantages including (i) a low overpotential to realize the electrooxidation reactions; (ii) simultaneous production of value-added organic compounds at the anode; and (iii) the production of H2 as a single gaseous product to enable the ease of gas collection and avoid the production of a mixed gas. Despite these advances, the application of this strategy is usually hindered by the use of an ion-conducting membrane to separate the cathodic and anodic reactions to obtain high faradaic efficiencies for both the HER and the electrooxidation of small organic molecules; moreover, a number of limitations, including high device cost, tedious operation procedure, and shortened device lifetime due to the corrosive nature of small organic molecules and the in situ formed radicals, are associated with the membrane-assisted hybrid water splitting approach.47,48
A better solution is the exploration of bifunctional electrocatalysts with extraordinary catalytic selectivity towards H2 production along with remarkable catalytic activity for the electrooxidation of small organic molecules to assemble a membrane-free hybrid water electrolysis (MFHWE) system. We reason that Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticles may meet the required attributes due to the following facts: (i) the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticles have a Pt-like electronic structure and are among the most active categories of HER catalysts in alkaline media49–51 and (ii) the Ni component in the catalyst can be electrooxidized to Ni3+ species (e.g., NiOOH), which are responsible for the subsequent oxidation of small organic molecules to afford value-added products.44,52 Herein, we report that the hierarchical Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticles are a class of high-performance electrocatalysts for both benzyl alcohol (BA) oxidation and the HER that allow the assembly of an MFHWE device for efficient and stable H2 production under alkaline conditions. Our results showed nearly unity faradaic efficiencies for both the BA oxidation at the anode and H2 production at the cathode in 1.0 M KOH along with a robust durability. More importantly, the small cell voltages of 1.40, 1.45, and 1.53 V delivered the benchmark current densities of 20, 50 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, for the MFHWE system in a two-electrode configuration. This feature enabled the device to be driven by a single-cell alkaline battery or a solar cell under natural sunlight irradiation. It is anticipated that the benefit of hybrid water electrolysis for H2 production can be substantially extended by our membrane-free strategy based on the optimization of catalyst performance for both electrochemical H2 evolution and the reformation of organic compounds.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of the hierarchical Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst
The combination (Fig. 1) of a hydrothermal treatment of a piece of Ni foam in the presence of Ni and Mo precursors at 160 °C for 4 h and chemical reduction of the resultant product under H2/Ar at 500 °C led to the formation of Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle-modified MoO2 microrods on the surface of the Ni foam, as supported by the powder X-ray diffraction analysis results (Fig. S1†).53,54 A close inspection (Fig. 2a and inset) shows that (i) the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticles have the average size of 20 nm and (ii) the MoO2 microrods are vertically grown on the surface of the Ni foam. The formation of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticles was verified by the elemental mapping of O, Mo, and Ni for a selected hybrid microrod (Fig. 2b–e). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the highly crystalline nature of both the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticles and the MoO2 microrods because of the clear lattice fringes observed with the measured d spacings of 0.36 and 0.21 nm, respectively (Fig. 2f). These data are in good agreement with the lattice spacings of the (110) and (121) planes of the monoclinic-phased MoO2 and the tetragonal-phased MoNi4, respectively. The presence of metallic Mo(0) and Ni(0) in the nanoparticles was also confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy because of the appearance of peaks at 229.6 eV in the Mo 3d and 852.5 eV in the Ni 2p3/2 profiles (Fig. 2g and h). Together, these findings suggest that the as-prepared catalyst is Mo–Ni/MoO2/Ni, which is in line with the previous results obtained for Mo–Ni nanostructures.55,56

Performance of the hierarchical Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst for anodic BA oxidation
Prior to the experiments, we first compared the OER performance of our hierarchical Mo–Ni nanoparticle catalyst with those of the other reported or commercially available counterparts, including RuO2/NF, Mo0.6Ni0.4/Ti, NiMoO4/NF, and treated and untreated Ni foams, in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. S2†). We found that the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst showed comparable activity to RuO2 and better performance than Mo0.6Ni0.4/Ti. However, the OER performance was inferior to that of NiMoO4/NF. In the absence of BA, the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst exhibited the onset potential at ∼1.47 V (vs. RHE) and an appreciable current density beyond 1.55 V (vs. RHE) for the OER in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) profile (Fig. 3a and S3†). Note that a notable oxidation peak is centered at 1.35 V (vs. RHE) as a result of the electrochemical oxidation of the Ni component in the catalyst into NiOOH. In comparison, the onset potential was shifted to 1.31 V (vs. RHE) after the addition of BA (10 mM) to the anodic chamber. The current density of 15 mA cm−2 was produced at the potential of 1.35 V (vs. RHE). The onset potential is similar to the potential at which NiOOH starts to form; this suggests that the in situ-formed NiOOH species is likely to be the active site for BA oxidation. In fact, the essential role of the in situ-formed NiOOH species that accounted for the oxidization of BA was further identified via the comparison of the cyclic voltammograms obtained in the presence and absence of BA (Fig. S4†).57 To obtain the benchmark current densities of 50, 100, and 200 mA cm−2, the potentials (vs. RHE) were estimated to be 1.37, 1.38 and 1.41 V, respectively. These potentials were about 229, 244, and 258 mV smaller than those for the OER (Fig. S5†), respectively. Note that due to the thermodynamically more favorable nature of the anodic oxidation reaction, it gives rise to a lower Tafel slope of 23.2 mV dec−1 relative to 154.8 mV dec−1 for the OER (Fig. S6†). To evaluate the mass loading of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticles, we prepared a Mo–Ni/MoO2/carbon cloth under the same conditions followed by etching the as-prepared hierarchical nanostructures in H2SO4 (2 M). The mass loading was estimated to be 2.5 mg cm−2 based on the weight difference before and after the etching treatment (Fig. S7†). The mass-normalized LSV curves suggested that the as-prepared Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst showed better BA oxidation activity than RuO2 (Fig. S8†). As a separate note, although our Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst showed lower OER performance than NiMoO4/NF, both of them exhibited a comparable activity towards the electrooxidation of BA in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. S9†). We attributed this observation to the fact that the distribution of Mo6+ dopants in NiOOH formed in situ via the electrooxidation of NiMoO4 was more homogeneous than that in NiOOH derived from Mo–Ni/MoO2. The doped Mo6+ ions in NiOOH led to improved adsorption energy for the OER intermediates, thereby resulting in higher OER activity.58 However, the BA oxidation activity was determined using the potential at which NiOOH was in situ formed on the surface of the anode. The Mo6+ dopants had a limited impact on the electrooxidation of BA under alkaline conditions. Due to these effects, a similar electrooxidation activity was obtained for Mo–Ni/MoO2/NF and NiMoO4/NF towards BA oxidation.

(c) Concentration evolution of BA and the corresponding oxidation products vs. the passed charge. The experiment was carried at 1.35 V in the presence of BA (25 mM, 40 mL) in 1.0 M KOH. (d) Long-term responsivity examination of the catalysts by the intermittent addition of BA (0.5 mmol) at 1.39 V. 
We then studied the faradaic efficiency for BA oxidation as a function of potential (vs. RHE). At a potential lower than 1.28 V, no oxidation products of BA were detected (Fig. 3b). In the potential region from 1.30 to 1.36 V, benzoic acid was produced as the major product after neutralization, with a nearly unity faradaic efficiency. When a high potential (1.38 V) was applied, the faradaic efficiency was slightly decreased to 98% due to the concurrent occurrence of the OER. With a further increase in the potential input (1.42 V), the OER at the anode became more prominent, as indicated by a dramatic decrease in the faradaic efficiency to 60% for benzoic acid formation. These data were in good agreement with the concentration evolution of BA and its oxidation species in the system as a function of the charge passed (Fig. 3c). As expected, the increase in the concentration of benzoic acid was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the concentration of BA. In addition, a trace amount of benzaldehyde was detected during the reaction, implying high selectivity and efficiency of BA oxidation over the as-prepared Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst in 1.0 M KOH.
We also examined the long-term responsivity and durability of the Mo–Ni nanoparticle catalyst towards the anodic oxidation of BA in 1.0 M KOH. After the intermittent addition of a small amount of BA (0.5 mmol) to the anodic chamber, a quick anodic current recovery was observed (Fig. 3d). This observation suggested a robust responsivity of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst towards the BA oxidation. Furthermore, the 15 h chronoamperometry experiment in the presence of excessive BA (4 mmol) showed negligible variations in the current density, implying a long-term stability of the catalyst (Fig. S10†). In contrast, the Mo–Ni nanoparticle catalyst showed a decreased durability (Fig. S11†) towards the OER under the same conditions. We attributed this difference to the larger potential required to drive the OER when compared with the case of BA oxidation, and thus, a heavier damage to the surface of the catalyst was caused (Fig. S12†). In addition, the degradation in the OER catalytic performance was likely due to peeling-off of the catalyst due to the formation of O2 bubbles on its surface. Collectively, these results place the as-prepared hierarchical Mo–Ni nanoparticle catalyst among the most high-performance electrocatalysts for anodic BA oxidation in alkaline media (Table S1†)59–62 and also suggest the advantageous features of the anodic oxidation of BA over water oxidation in alkaline media.
Performance of the hierarchical Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst for HER
To achieve high faradaic efficiency for H2 production via MFHWE, the electrocatalysts should have not only high HER activity, but also remarkable resistance to BA and its anodic oxidation products including benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. In the absence of organic compounds, the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst was found to have extraordinary HER activity in 1.0 M KOH, which rivaled that of the state-of-the-art catalyst Pt–C (Fig. S13†). The low overpotentials of 48 and 70 mV yielded the current densities of up to 50 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding Tafel slope was estimated to be 53.4 mV dec−1 (Fig. S14†). These data implied a much better HER activity of Mo–Ni relative to those of other catalysts including Mo0.6Ni0.4/Ti, NiMoO4/NF, as well as treated and untreated Ni foams (Fig. S14 and S15†). Of particular note is the long-term stability of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst for the HER, as evident by its essentially unchanged overpotential of ∼23 mV to afford ∼10 mA cm−2 in the 16 h chronoamperometry experiment (Fig. S16†). No obvious changes in the LSV profile were observed after 1000 cyclic voltammetry tests (Fig. S17†).
The impact of the presence of organic compounds (10 mM), including BA, benzaldehyde, and benzoic acid, on the HER activity over the hierarchical Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst was examined under harsh conditions. The experimental results showed that the direct addition of these organic compounds to the cathode chamber had a negligible effect on the HER kinetics, as evidenced by the marginal changes in the LSV curves (Fig. 4a).41 In addition, new Tafel slopes obtained under these conditions were found to be similar to that attained in the absence of the organic compounds (Fig. 4b). The high selectivity and robust durability of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst for the HER were studied by a 10 h chronoamperometry experiment in which the intermittent addition of the organic compounds was conducted at different time intervals. The results showed limited variations in the current density (at ∼50 mA cm−2) during the experiment (Fig. 4c). The high selectivity was further quantified by measuring the faradaic efficiency for H2 production. The measurements showed nearly unity faradaic efficiencies in all cases (Fig. 4d). These findings suggested both high selectivity and robustness of the hierarchical Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst towards the HER in 1.0 M KOH. These attributes enable the HER activity of the catalyst to show high resistance to BA and its corresponding oxidation compounds at concentrations up to 10 mM in the cathode chamber.

Performance of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst as a bifunctional catalyst for MFHWE
The high performance of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst for both the BA oxidation and the HER motivated us to test the feasibility of its use as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for H2 production via MFHWE (Fig. S18†). We first confirmed that the presence of BA had no obvious negative effects on H2 production in the absence of an ion-conducting membrane (Nafion 115) in a two-electrode device (inset, Fig. 5a). Note that without correction with iR (current time internal resistance) compensation, the obtained LSV curves showed slight changes before and after the removal of the membrane (Fig. S19†); the difference in the LSV curves was obviously a result of the increased ohmic resistance in the electrochemical device with the Nation membrane to separate the anodic and the cathodic chambers.

Note that the inset shows the LSV curves of the catalyst with and without the use of a Nafion membrane. (b) The dependence of the produced H2 volume on the passed charge. (c) Catalytic stability evolution obtained via repeating the 10 h chronopotentiometry experiment at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 5 successive cycles. (d) The volume of the produced H2 as a function of time. Note that the cell voltage was set at 1.39 V, and 0.25 mmol of BA was added in each cycle of the experiment. The inset shows the corresponding dependence of the current density on time. (e) Demonstration of the use of a solar cell to drive the MFHWE under natural and mild sunlight irradiation to produce the cell voltage of 1.38 V. 
More importantly, the MFHWE needed smaller cell voltages to deliver comparable benchmark current densities for the overall water electrolysis (Fig. 5a). For example, to achieve the current densities of 20, 50, and 100 mA cm−2, the cell voltages were required to be as low as 1.40, 1.45, and 1.53 V, respectively. These data are at least 210 mV smaller than those obtained for the overall water electrolysis (Fig. S20†). The faradaic efficiency for H2 production was studied via a comparison of the calculated and measured volumes of the produced H2 (Fig. 5b). The results showed a nearly unity faradaic efficiency because 1.7 mL of H2 was generated upon the passage of each 15C of charge. Moreover, other substituted BAs, including 2-methylbenzyl alcohol and 3-methylbenzyl alcohol, were found to have a similar function of lowering the cell voltage during the production of H2 (Fig. S21†). This robustness also suggests that the electrooxidation reaction is associated with the in situ-formed NiOOH at the anode. The long-term durability of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst was examined by successively repeating the 10 h chronopotentiometry experiment for 5 cycles. The results demonstrated that at least 90% of the initial current density was retained at the end of each cycle of the experiment (Fig. 5c). These results suggest attractive utility of the Mo–Ni nanoparticle catalyst as bifunctional electrocatalysts for H2 production via MFHWE (Table S1†).
As an added benefit of the MFHWE, the volume of the produced H2 was precisely controlled by the combination of the amount of BA added and the cell voltage set in the chronoamperometry experiment. As a proof-of-concept experiment, when the cell voltage was set at 1.39 V, each addition of 0.25 mmol of BA produced 10.4 mL of H2 within 4.5 h (Fig. 5d). Note that despite the low H2 production rate at the end of each cycle of the experiment, no OER occurred as no bubbles were formed at the anode. In addition, high activity of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst couple for both the HER and BA oxidation allowed the MFHWE to be easily driven by a single-cell alkaline battery (Fig. S22†) or a solar cell. Interestingly, when the voltage output of the solar cell reached 1.38 V under natural sunlight irradiation, gas bubbles of H2 were generated extensively at the cathode (Fig. 5e). By comparison, no apparent H2 bubbles were produced at the anode in the absence of BA. This observation indicated the inherent favorability of the anodic oxidation of organic compounds over water oxidation during the production of H2.
Note that high selectivity for H2 production at the anode is essential to achieve high faradaic efficiency for H2 production via the MFHWE (Fig. S23†). When pristine Ni foam was used as the anode, the faradaic efficiency for H2 production was decreased to 76% (Fig. S24†). This was because of the concurrent occurrence of cathodic reduction of the corresponding oxidation species of BA, as evidenced by the detection of diastereoisomeric pinacols in the product. In addition, high catalytic activity of the cathode towards the BA oxidation is also very important not only for the generation of an appreciable current density at low voltage for H2 production, but also due to the need for the suppression of OER. For example, when Ni foams were used as a bifunctional catalyst for the MFHWE, the anodic oxidation of BA (Fig. S25†) was obviously concomitant with the OER at a current density higher than 20 mA cm−2 (∼1.48 V).
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that the high performance of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst for both the HER and the BA oxidation enabled its use as a bifunctional catalyst for efficient H2 production via MFHWE. The MFHWE demonstrated benefits, including small energy input, long device lifetime, ease of operation, pre-designable volumes of H2, and avoidance of the generation of an explosive mixed gas of H2 and O2, for H2 production. The low energy input led to a remarkable current density in the MFHWE that enabled the device to be readily driven by a single-cell alkaline battery or a solar cell under mild sunlight irradiation; this suggested the significant potential of this technology in practical H2 production.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic of the synthesis of Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle-modified MoO2 microrods on a Ni foam substrate. The synthesis can be divided into two steps: growth of NiMoO4 microrod arrays on the surface of Ni foam and chemical reduction of the resulting NiMoO4/Ni foam under an atmosphere of H2 (5 volume%)/Ar at 500 °C for 2 h (2 times).	 

 	Fig. 2  Characterization of the as-prepared hierarchical Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalysts on a Ni foam. (a) SEM image. Note that the inset shows a high-magnification SEM image of the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalysts. (b–e) TEM and the corresponding elemental mapping images of a selected Mo–Ni/MoO2 microrod. (f) HRTEM image of the interface between the Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticles and the MoO2 microrod. (g and h) XPS profiles of Mo 3d and Ni 2p3/2 for the as-prepared hierarchical Mo–Ni alloy nanoparticle catalyst.
