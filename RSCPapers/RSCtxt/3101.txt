Fluorescent upconverting crystals (UCs) typically consist of metal oxides doped with lanthanide ions. When excited in the near infrared (NIR) region, the ions upconvert, either through a non-linear two-photon absorption process, or by a sequential absorption of photonsvia the formation of a long-lived intermediate  state. High quantum yields for upconversion are only obtained if the lanthanide ions are located in well-defined crystal fields ; hence, only heavily calcined matrices usually perform well.1–4 Such upconverters have a variety of potential uses in solar energy conversion and optical labelling;1,5,6 however, they are currently limited by the narrow range of emission wavelengths available. It would be useful to extend the range of possible emission wavelengths to cover the entire visible spectrum. One solution to this problem is to use semiconducting nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs) to tailor the UCs’ emission characteristics.

QDs are well known for their size-tunable emission properties. In principle, the combination of strong upconverter absorption with tunable down-conversion from semiconducting QDs provides a method for creating tunable upconverters. We report here on a simple method for encapsulating NIR upconverters, such that they can emit at any tunable visible wavelength with a high emission quantum efficiency. When conventional NIR upconverters are coated with multilayers of QDs, the upconverted emission is absorbed by the QD coating (i.e.radiative energy transfer ), which then re-emits at its design (visible) wavelength, a feature that is not available with current lanthanide-based upconverters. The resulting tunable fluorophores  are extremely photostable and can be transferred into glassy or polymeric matrices. This process cannot generally be exploited with molecular species, such as dyes, because of their smaller absorption cross-sections.
Commercially available NIR phosphors of 5 μm diameter were encapsulated with various sizes of QDs (see the ESI† ). The UCs were first functionalised with the coupling agent 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) to produce amine-capped UCs for the adsorption of QDs. This method exploits the ability of QDs to bind covalently to the terminal –NH2 groups of APS, as QDs have been shown to have a high affinity for primary amines7. This functionalisation step is crucial, as QDs do not adsorb onto bare UC surfaces. Zeta potential  measurements were performed to ensure the surfaces of the UCs were successfully modified. Unmodified UCs exhibited a surface potential of −22.3 mV at pH 6.5; after they were functionalised with APS, the surface became positive and exhibited a zeta potential  of +13.5 mV. Four sizes of core–shell CdSe/CdS/ZnSQDs were used, with the first excitation absorption maxima at 561, 582, 597 and 622 nm, and photoluminescence (PL) peaks centred at 577, 593, 611 and 631 nm, respectively. Once the first monolayer of QDs was bound to the UCs, subsequent monolayers could then be added using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to generate further amine  groups on the QD-coated UCs (see the ESI† ).
The images in Fig. 1 show the range of PL emission wavelengths available from the uncoated and QD-coated UC powders under UV excitation. It should be noted that no luminescence  was evident from the unmodified UC. When illuminated with continuous wave radiation at 1064 nm, the unmodified UC emits green luminescence  centered at 552 nm, while the QD-coated UCs’ luminescence  corresponds to the emission spectra  of the QDs themselves.
 Fig. 1  Digital photographs (uncorrected) of the QD-coated green-emitting UC powders. Top: PL observed when excited with the I line (365 nm) of a Hg (UV) lamp (Vilber Lourmat). Bottom: PL observed when excited by a Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser (CNI Optoelectronics Technology). From left to right: pure green-emitting IRUC (IRUCG), IRUCG coated with yellow-emitting QD577 (IRUCG@QD577), IRUCG coated with orange-emitting QD593 (IRUCG@QD593), IRUCG coated with dark orange-emitting QD611 (IRUCG@QD611) and IRUCG coated with red-emitting QD631 (IRUCG@QD631). 
PL spectra from the QD-coated UC powders were collected by a Renishaw inVia Reflex micro-Raman spectrometer using either 532 or 1064 nm laser excitation. The coated powders were sandwiched between two glass cover slips during measurements. Fig. 2 shows the emission spectra  resulting from the upconversion process upon excitation with the 1064 nm laser. In the case of IRUCG, the dominant peak is centred at 552 nm, as previously mentioned. Peaks at 655, 659, 663 and 668 nm can also be seen in the spectrum of the unprocessed UC. The relative contributions of these peaks to the total emission spectrum changed as the UC system was modified with different sized QDs. For example, in the case of IRUCG@QD631, the emission peak at 552 nm is very small compared to that at 668 nm. The excitation power used in all four samples was kept constant for comparison; hence, the reduction in intensity of the 552 nm peak is a result of competitive emission from the QDs. The emission spectra  from the QD-coated UCs exhibit oscillatory bands. These fringes were not observed in measurements using 532 nm laser excitation, only with those employing NIR excitation, and are due to minor optical interference between the two cover slips.
 Fig. 2  The PL spectra of QD-coated UC powders excited at 1064 nm and measured at room temperature—the excitation power for each measurement was the same for comparison. The insets show magnified views of the new PL peaks. From top to bottom: the PL spectra of pure IRUCG, IRUCG@QD577, IRUCG@QD593, IRUCG@QD611 and IRUCG@QD631. 
The absorption spectra were recorded by a Cary 5 UV-vis–NIR spectrophotometer operating in dual beam reference mode. Fig. 3 presents a comparison of the absorption spectra of the QDs in solution and after they were bound to UCs, the insoluble UC crystals gave rise to scattering in the slurries, hence the rise in the baseline. These spectra clearly show that the QD surfaces have been modified due to their interaction with the UCs; changes in the first excitation peaks are indicative of energy transfer between the UCs and QDs.

Fig. 4 illustrates the PL spectra collected from non-coupled QDs in solution, as well as from coupled QD–UC powders upon excitation with a UV source. Steady-state PL spectra of the QDs in solution were recorded on a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with slit widths of 1 nm and an integration time of 1 s. Concentrations were adjusted such that the QD samples had optical densities of <0.1 at the excitation wavelength. Compared to the QDs in solution, the PL emission maxima for all four QD–UC powdered samples were slightly red-shifted. As the instruments used for these measurements were wavelength calibrated, these shifts are real and probably arose from changes to the dielectric environment around the QDs, or from weak energy transfer between the QDs in the densely packed coating. Table 1 provides a summary of the PL peak positions for each of the samples using different excitation wavelengths.

In conclusion, we have described a simple method to create multicolour upconverters using QDs and a commercially available green upconversion phosphor. The QD-coated upconverting powders emit at tunable visible wavelengths and are extremely photostable, enabling them to be used to generate any visible colour. Importantly, the absorption cross-section of the QDs is high enough that just a few monolayers on the UC surface are sufficient to ensure both a high yield of radiative energy transfer  and a high emission efficiency.
