    , Accepted 6th December 2022First published on 7th December 2022AbstractPhotocatalytic H2O-to-H2(g) and –H2O2(aq) (2H2O(l) → H2(g) + H2O2(aq)) by a two-electron reaction is kinetically feasible. The proton-coupled two-electron transfer induced a photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) from oxygen and water is also an accessible path for the safe production of H2O2. It is thus desirable to synthesize effective photocatalysts that yield H2O2 by the coupling of two-electron transfer water oxidation (+1.23 VNHE) and ORR (+0.68 VNHE). In this work, new g-C3N4/BiOI S-scheme heterojunctions with co-catalyst cobalt phosphide (CoP) (BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP) were prepared for the photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 reactions. The BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP heterojunctions can enhance visible light absorption and reduce electron–hole pair recombination rates. Because of the water splitting by two-electrons and reduction of oxygen, the BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP heterojunctions have a better photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 yield than with the BiOI/g-C3N4 heterojunction by 3.0–8.4 times. With more CoP (i.e., 19 wt%) on the BiOI/g-C3N4, the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 heterojunction generates more photocatalytic H2O2 with higher formation rate constant (kf), equilbrium constant (K), and a lower decomposition rate constant (kd). This new, low-cost and ready-prepared BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP S-scheme heterojunction has a high efficiency for the reversible photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 reaction, which could be feasibly used for applications in H2O2-fuel cells for electricity using solar energy.
Introduction
Using unlimited solar energy, photocatalytic splitting of water to H2 for energy storage in the simplest chemical bond by semiconductors such as TiO2, BiVO4 and g-C3N4 has been widely studied.1 In the photocatalytic water splitting processes, the water oxidation reaction (WOR) involves two- and four-electron transfers to form H2O2 and O2, respectively, whereas the two-electron transfer path for H2O2 is more kinetically favorable than the four-electron transfer one.2 The H2O2 is a green reagent that has been widely used in pulp and paper bleaching, and in the textile industry.3 Also, H2O2 can be used as an eco-friendly fuel for fuel cells.4 Unlike the artificial photosynthesis by light-harvesting, charge separation and catalytic reactions, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to clean fuels such as CO, CH4, CH3OH for power or electricity by combustion may cause a reformation of CO2.5
Whereas the formation of H2O2 from H2O and O2 is an endothermic reaction (H2O + 1/2O2 → H2O2, ΔG0 = +115.8 kJ mol−1), the proton-coupled two-electron and hole transfer reaction can facilitate photocatalytic H2O2 generation.6,7 Thus, effective photocatalysts with a relatively low electron–hole recombination rate to yield H2O2 by coupling a two-electron transfer reaction were prepared. The coupling reaction with H2O/O2 (+1.23 V vs. NHE) and O2/H2O2 (+0.68 V vs. NHE) is more accessible than the H2O/H2O2 reaction (+1.78 vs. NHE).
A typical S-scheme heterojunction combines oxidation and reduction photocatalysts (OP and RP, respectively). Under light irradiation, an inner electric field between the OP and RP can be formed at the interface to facilitate charge migration.8 The photogenerated electrons and holes are reserved effectively in conduction and valence bands (CB and VB) of RP and OP to maximize the reduction and oxidation capabilities, respectively, whereas weak charge carriers are recombined at the interface. Thus, the S-scheme has high charge separation and photo-redox proficiencies.9 In the photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 process effected by the S-scheme heterojunctions, the photogenerated holes in the VB of OP can react with H2O to form O2, while the photogenerated electron in the CB of RP can reduce O2 to H2O2.
Bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) is a layered material for photocatalytic energy conversion and environmental remediation used for example in oxygen evolution, hydrogen generation, CO2 reduction, nitrogen fixation, selective organic synthesis, pollutant removal and disinfection.10–16 The layered BiOI can be constructed by interlacing [Bi2O2] with double halogen slabs along the [001] direction. In each [I–Bi–O–Bi–I] layer, a bismuth center is surrounded by four oxygen and four iodide atoms, forming an asymmetric decahedral geometry. The static electric field between the layers can promote the separation of carriers leading to its use in many photocatalytic applications.17 The BiOI has the advantages of high charge carrier separation, induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), visible light absorption and magnetic separation.18
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is one of metal-free 2D layered photocatalysts that can be synthesized by simple methods.19 Compared with other semiconductor photocatalysts, g-C3N4 has a high electronegativity, strong visible light absorption and tunable energy band edge.20 Also, as an n-type semiconductor, the g-C3N4 has a suitable band gap and reaction sites for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. However, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is still far away from that which is necessary for engineering applications, and this is mainly due to its high charge carrier recombination rate. The BiOI and g-C3N4 with appropriate redox potential and Fermi levels can construct a p–n junction for a S-scheme heterojunction.
Moreover, the transition metal phosphides, for example, CoP, Ni2P, MoP and Cu3P, as co-catalysts have great potential to replace platinum group metals for the catalytic active species.21,22 However, surface modification by phosphides may modulate the coordinating metal ions to enhance photocatalytic reactions.23 Thus, in this study, new BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP heterojunctions were prepared to enhance the photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 reaction. Also, the reaction kinetics for the photocatalytic H2O2 generation by the heterojunctions were investigated for further use in engineering applications.
Experimental
The g-C3N4 photocatalyst was prepared by annealing melamine (99%, Alfa Aesar) in a ceramic crucible at 550 °C for 2 h. The yellow solid product was ground in a mortar to obtain the g-C3N4 powder. Subsequently, bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (2 mmol, 99.99%, Acros Organics), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) (0.06 g, PVP40, Sigma-Aldrich) and the g-C3N4 powder (0.176 g) were mixed in ethylene glycol (30 mL, 99.5%, Merck) and stirred at 25 °C for 1 h to form solution A. Potassium iodide (2 mmol, 99.5%, Riedel-de Haën) and sodium hydroxide (0.1 g, 97.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in deionized water (40 mL) to yield solution B. Solutions A and B were mixed and stirred at 25 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min, the BiOI/g-C3N4 heterostructure was washed with deionized water and ethanol.
The transition metal phosphides dispersed on the BiOI/g-C3N4 heterostructure were prepared using a two-step procedure. Sodium citrate dihydrate (0.75 g, 99.8%, J.T. Baker) and cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (3 g, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in deionized water (100 mL) to yield a precursor that was mixed with sodium hydroxide (25 mL, 1 M, Merck) and stirred at 25 °C for 30 min. The cobalt phosphides separated by centrifugation were dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP) photocatalysts were prepared by heating mixtures of CoP (5 wt% and 20 wt%) and BiOI/g-C3N4 under a high-purity N2 flow (80 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 3 h. The final CoP concentrations in the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)q (q = 0.06 and 0.19) photocatalysts were determined by ICP-MS (Element XR, ThermoFisher Scientific) were 5.9 wt% and 19 wt%, respectively.
The photocatalyst powders (20 mg) were dispersed in anhydrous alcohol (200 μL) and Nafion® 117 (20 μL) (5% in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols and water, Sigma-Aldrich) solution and reacted in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h and then drop-coated onto fluorine doped tin oxide conducting glasses (TEC 7, Ruilong). The photoelectrodes were washed with acetone, isopropanol, ethanol and deionized water, and then dried prior to the photocatalytic experiments.
The morphologies of the photocatalysts were studied by ultrahigh resolution scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM, JEM-2100F, Jeol) with high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDXS) spectroscopic detection. The crystalline structure of the photocatalysts was investigated using X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD, D8 DISCOVER with a general area diffraction detector sensor (GADDS), Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) with Cu Kα (1.542 Å) radiation as the X-ray source. The scans were taken with a 0.2 mm receiving slit under operational conditions of 40 kV and 40 mA.
The specific surface areas and pore structures of the g-C3N4, BiOI/g-C3N4 and BiOI/CoP0.19/g-C3N4 photocatalysts were measured on a sorption analyzer (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics). Their surface chemical composition was also determined on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, 5000 VersaProbe, PHI) with monochromatized Al Kα under a high vacuum (5 × 10−8 mm Hg). The absorbance spectra of the photocatalysts were recorded between 200 and 800 nm on a diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 100, Varian) with a double-path beam mode with an integrating sphere apparatus, and BaSO4 was used as the background reference. The Tauc plots of the photocatalysts were used to determine the bandgap energy using the equation: αhν = (hν − Eg)n, where α is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the bulk bandgap energy, and n is 1/2 or 2 for the direct or indirect bandgap material, respectively.
The photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a 300 W xenon arc lamp (Burgeon Instrument Company, Taiwan) to simulate solar energy. Prior to the photocatalysis, a cylindrical glass reactor containing deionized water (40 mL) was purged with oxygen for 20 min. The photoelectrode was erected in the reactor for harvesting light from the xenon arc lamp. Concentrations of H2O2 during photocatalysis were determined by colorimetric spectroscopy using the copper-DMP method.24 Typically, 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (DMP) (0.5 mL) in ethanol (10 g L−1) was mixed with copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (0.5 mL, 0.01 M, 98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphate buffer (0.5 mL, 1 M, pH 7, Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water (1 mL). The mixed solution was measured at 454 nm on a UV-Vis spectrometer (Cary 100, Varian). Concentrations of evolved O2 in the AgNO3 solution (10 mM) in the photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 reaction was measured by gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detection (GC-TCD, 430 GC, Bruker).
Results and discussion
The morphologies of the g-C3N4, BiOI, BiOI/g-C3N4 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP) photocatalysts were studied using STEM. Fig. 1(a) and (b) show that the g-C3N4 has a crumpled layered structure whereas the BiOI occurs as nanoplates with a diameter between 50 and 80 nm. In Fig. 1(c), the CoP is dispersed on the BiOI/g-C3N4 heterostructure. Fig. 1(d) shows that the lattice spaces of the CoP are 0.188 nm, which corresponds to its (211) lattice plane. Uniform distribution of bismuth (Bi), iodine (I), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), cobalt (Co) and phosphorus (P) in the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 heterostructure was also observed by HAADF-STEM and EDXS (Fig. 1(e) and (f1)–(f7)). Excessive CoP causes disruption of the uniformly distributed heterostructure which may lead to lower activity of the photocatalysts.

The crystalline structures of the g-C3N4, BiOI/g-C3N4 BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.06 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 photocatalysts determined using XRD are shown in Fig. 2. The characteristic peak at 28.8° is related to the (002) planes of g-C3N4 (JCPDS no. 87-1526). The pristine BiOI has characteristic diffraction peaks at 29.6°, 31.7°, 37.8°, 45.4°, 51.3° and 55.2° corresponding to the (102), (110), (112), (200), (114) and (212) planes of the tetragonal BiOI (JCPDS no. 10-0445), respectively. When involved in heterostructures with g-C3N4, the BiOI preserves its main diffraction peaks with similar intensity ratios. Also, the nanosizes of the BiOI nanosheets were determined by the Scherrer equation, using the half-width and intensity of the diffraction peaks at 29.6° and 31.7°, and found to be 38–84 nm, which were similar to the STEM observations. The co-catalyst CoP with characteristic peaks at 46.4°, 48.5° and 57.5° which were indexed to the (112), (211) and (301) planes (JCPDS no. 29-0497)25,26 on the BiOI/g-C3N4 heterostructure, were also observed (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). The N2 absorption–desorption isotherms of the g-C3N4, BiOI/g-C3N4 and The BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 3. Type IV isotherms with an H3 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.8–1.0 are observed. The g-C3N4, BiOI/g-C3N4 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 also had specific surface areas of 10–16 m2 g−1 with pore openings of 12.6–17.3 nm which were determined using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.

The XPS spectra of the BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP heterostructures were obtained to enable a better understanding of its surface chemical structure. The C 1s spectra of the g-C3N4 in Fig. 4 has two broadened bands centered at 284.8 and 288.2 eV which are associated with the C–C and N–CN species, respectively.29 The N–CN band intensity decreased as more CoP was incorporated, suggesting an interaction between CoP and g-C3N4. Moreover, for the N 1s spectra, three broadened bands centred at 398.7, 399.6 and 400.8 eV are related to the C–NC, N–C3 and C–N–H species, respectively. The C–N–H also has a decreased intensity, possibly caused by the presence of the co-catalyst CoP.

In Fig. 5, the bands centred at 159.3 and 164.6 eV in the Bi 4f spectra of the BiOI/g-C3N4, BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.06 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 photocatalysts were assigned to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2, respectively. In the I 3d spectra, two bands at 618.5 and 630.5 eV were attributed to I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2, respectively. Also, the bands of the Co and P in the BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP heterostructures were observed. In the Co 2p spectra of the BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP, the CoII (781.6 and 796.5 eV) and CoIII (786.2 and 799.2 eV) distinctive species were found.27,28 Thus, it seems that the co-catalyst CoP has a weak effect on the BiOI.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 6(A). The BiOI and g-C3N4 have an absorbance between 400 and 700 nm, suggesting that they can harvest visible light. In addition, in the presence of the co-catalyst, CoP, the visible light absorbance of the BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP increased. The bandgap energy of the photocatalysts was studied using the Tauc plot (see Fig. 6(B)). The bandgap energy of BiOI, g-C3N4 and BiOI/g-C3N4 were 2.74, 2.38 and 2.51 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that the CoP has a narrow bandgap energy (1.55 eV), and with more CoP on the BiOI/g-C3N4, the bandgap energy of the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 decreased to 1.87 eV, suggesting that the co-catalyst CoP on the BiOI/g-C3N4 heterostructure can increase the visible light absorption to enhance photocatalytic H2O2 generation.

Fig. 7(A) shows a maximum intensity at 560 nm in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the g-C3N4, BiOI/g-C3N4 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP) photocatalysts (measured under an excitation wavelength of 325 nm). The PL intensities decrease as more CoP was incorporated into the BiOI/g-C3N4 heterostructure. The charge lifetime of the photocatalysts was also studied by time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy. From the dual-exponential functions, the average lifetimes (τav) of the g-C3N4, BiOI/g-C3N4, BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.06 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 photocatalysts were 5.16, 3.72, 1.73 and 1.70 ns, respectively (Table 1). The BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 heterostructure had a higher charge transfer rate constant (kCT) (0.59 ns−1) than that of the g-C3N4 (0.19 ns−1), which signified that the co-catalyst CoP can promote the photogenerated electron transfer.

The flat band potentials of the g-C3N4, BiOI, and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP) photocatalysts were determined using the Mott–Schottky equation by fixing the frequency at 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 kHz in an electrochemical three-electrode system. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show that the g-C3N4 and BiOI were n- and p-type semiconductors, respectively. The bandgap energy levels (shown in Fig. 9(B)) of the heterostructures were established by combining the bandgap energy and the flat band potential that were obtained from the Tauc and Mott–Schottky plots, respectively. The flat band potentials of the g-C3N4 and BiOI are −0.89 and +2.14 V vs. NHE, which corresponded to the CB and VB, respectively. Thus, the VB (+1.85 V vs. NHE) and CB (−0.24 V vs. NHE) potentials were obtained. In Fig. 9, the redox potentials of H2O/O2 (E = +1.23 V vs. NHE) and O2/H2O2 (E = +0.68 V vs. NHE) were positioned within the BiOI/g-C3N4 energy gap, which suggested that the BiOI/g-C3N4 heterojunction was suitable for use in photocatalytic H2O2 generation.

Theoretical calculation of the density functional theory (DFT) based on the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) equations using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation package (VASP) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was carried out. The plane-wave basis sets truncated at a constant energy cutoff of 400 eV were used, and the structure was designed using the vacuum slab. Using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) calculation, the geometry optimization convergence was set up, i.e., 10−5 Ha for energy, 0.005 Ha Å−1 for force, and 0.01 Å for displacement. The structure models and electrostatic potential of the BiOI/g-C3N4 heterostructure were studied using DFT to validate its S-scheme heterojunction. Also, the vacuum energy scale was converted by the equation (EFermi = ENHE − 0.45). In Fig. 9, the work functions (Φ) of the BiOI and g-C3N4 were −5.57 and −5.02 eV, respectively.30 The BiOI had a lower Fermi level than the g-C3N4. After contact, the internal electric field could be created at the interface for the S-scheme heterojunctions (Fig. 9). The photogenerated e− and h+ that were accumulated on the CB of BiOI and VB of g-C3N4, respectively, lead to charge carrier recombination at the interface. With the incorporation of CoP to the g-C3N4, a decrease of charge-transfer barrier with an increase in charge carrier density was observed. For example, the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.06 containing less CoP had a higher Fermi level than the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 that had a relatively small kinetic overpotential (ΔEfb = 1.75 V vs. NHE) for effective separation of the charge carrier. Consequently, the useless electrons (e−) and holes (h+) were eliminated by recombination, whereas the photogenerated e− in the CB of the g-C3N4 and h+ in the VB of the BiOI were preserved and so they were able to engage in photocatalytic reactions (Fig. 9(B)). The relatively high yield of H2O2 effected by the heterojunctions also supported the S-scheme mechanism (Fig. 10(A)).

The charge concentrations of the BiOI, BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.06 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 photocatalysts were calculated using the Mott–Schottky equation: Nd = 2/neεε0, where Nd is the charge carrier concentration, n is the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot, e is the electron charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), ε is dielectric constant of the BiOI (73),31 and ε0 is vacuum permittivity (8.8 × 10−12 F m−1). The BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 (2.4 × 1028 cm−3) has a greater charge carrier concentration than those of the BiOI (4.8 × 1027 cm−3) and BiOI/(CoP)0.06 (6.6 × 1027 cm−3) which suggested the existence of energy band bending, and an inner electric field within the interface region. Thus, driven by the inner electric field, the S-scheme heterojunctions of the charge-transfer mechanism can be achieved.
The performances of the BiOI/g-C3N4 S-scheme heterojunction with the co-catalyst CoP for photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 were studied in O2-saturated water (40 mL) at 25 °C under visible light irradiation. Concentrations of H2O2 were determined using the copper-DMP method. Fig. 10(A) shows the relatively low photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 yields obtained using g-C3N4 and BiOI, which may be due to the relatively low visible light absorption and high e−–h+ pair recombination rates. With the co-catalyst CoP, the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.06 heterojunctions had 3.0–8.4 times higher photocatalytic H2O2 yields than the BiOI/g-C3N4.
The photocatalytic H2O-to-O2 formation was performed in an aqueous solution containing AgNO3 to track O2 evolution. As shown in Fig. 10(C), under visible light irradiation for 90 min, O2 generation by g-C3N4 was relatively low (1.13 μmol g−1 h−1). When the CoP was incorporated into the BiOI/g-C3N4 to form the S-scheme heterojunctions, the BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP had better e− and h+ separation and migration which enhanced the photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 formation (Fig. 7). For example, the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.06 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 heterojunctions could increase the photocatalytic O2 generation rates by 3.7–4.1 times. In addition, the photostability of the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 heterojunction was also investigated. After four successive cyclic runs, the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 still had the desired photostability (see Fig. 10(D)) for potential engineering applications.
The ORR has a |ΔGads| of <0.1 eV.32 However, the Tafel reaction barriers were related to the electrochemical reaction rate and overpotential (0.52 eV for CoP).33 Therefore, the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 heterojunction had relatively high O2 and H2O2 yields. The photocatalytic H2O2 formation and decomposition kinetics were also considered. Fig. 10(D) shows the decomposition of H2O2 by the BiOI/g-C3N4 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP) heterojunctions. In the O2-saturated aqueous solution, the H2O2 formation and decomposition rates were determined by zero-order and first-order kinetics, respectively. The reaction kinetic parameters for the BiOI/g-C3N4 and BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP) heterojunctions are summarized in Table 2. The H2O2 formation rate constant was determined within the first 35 min of contact time. The concentrations of H2O2 for the reaction: H2O + 1/2O2 ⇌ H2O2 were determined using the equation ([H2O2]) = kf/kd(1 − exp(−kdt)), where kf and kd are the formation and decomposition rate constants, respectively.34 It was clear that with the co-catalyst CoP, the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.06 heterojunction had a higher kf, kd and K for the reversible photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 reaction than that of the BiOI/g-C3N4. However, with more CoP on the BiOI/g-C3N4, the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 heterojunction generated more photocatalytic H2O2 with higher kf and K, and a lower kd.

Conclusions
The CoP dispersed BiOI/g-C3N4 heterojunctions can enhance visible light absorption and reduce e−–h+ pair recombination rates. The reduction potentials for H2O/O2 (+1.23 V vs. NHE) and O2/H2O2 (+0.68 V vs. NHE) are positioned within the bandgap energy levels, which suggests that the BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP S-scheme heterojunctions are suitable for the photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 reaction. The photogenerated e− in the CB of the g-C3N4 and the h+ in the VB of the BiOI are preserved and thus, are able to engage in the photocatalytic reactions, and hence the S-scheme mechanism is followed. During the water splitting by two-electrons and reduction of oxygen, the BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP heterojunctions has a greater photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 yield, by 3.0–8.4 times, than the BiOI/g-C3N4. With more CoP on the BiOI/g-C3N4, the BiOI/g-C3N4/(CoP)0.19 heterojunction generates more photocatalytic H2O2 with a higher kf and K, and a lower kd. These new, low-cost and easily-prepared BiOI/g-C3N4/CoP S-scheme heterojunctions have a high efficiency for the reversible photocatalytic H2O-to-H2O2 reaction, which demonstrates a feasibility for H2O2-fuel cell applications for electricity using the unlimited solar energy.
