    , Accepted 13th December 2021First published on 14th December 2021AbstractTernary small-molecule organic solar cells (OSCs) are efficiently optimized and fabricated with small-molecule benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodanine (BTR) as the donor and a blend of Y6 and bisPC71BM or PC71BM as the acceptor. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of BTR:Y6 binary OSCs, BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM and BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary OSCs are 11.56%, 12.97% and 12.25%, respectively. BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM optimized ternary OSCs show a relatively high open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.916 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 20.2 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 70.1% compared with BTR:Y6 binary OSCs and BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary OSCs. The VOC of ternary OSCs monotonically increases with increasing bisPC71BM content in the blend acceptor, which can be mainly ascribed to the shallow LUMO and enlarged energy bandgap. The highest JSC and FF are attributed to the complementary absorption of the BTR:Y6 binary photoactive layer and have good compatibility. We successfully demonstrate that a bisadduct analogue of [70]PCBM (bisPC71BM) is a better third component material than a single analogue of [70]PCBM (PC71BM). The blend of BTR, Y6, and bisPC71BM (the optimized BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM ratio of 1:1:0.2) is a promising method to prepare efficient ternary OSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved considerable interest due to their potential to produce lightweight, roll-to-roll-manufactured and flexible solar cells.1,2 Recently, with advances in polymer donor and small-molecule nonfullerene acceptor material design and device optimization, OSC performance and stability have rapidly increased. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 19% for single-junction OSCs have been realized.3 Due to the advantages of tunable light absorption, energy levels, and electron mobility for small-molecule nonfullerene acceptors, the preparation of binary OSCs with polymers as donors and nonfullerene small molecules as acceptors is one of the most effective strategies to obtain high-performance OSCs.4,5 Zou et al. first reported nonfullerene OSCs with Y6 as the acceptor and achieved a PCE of 15.7%.6 Qiang et al. reported further improvements in the photovoltaic performance of nonfullerene binary OSCs with Y6 as the acceptor and achieved a PCE of 16.35%.7 Other polymer donors were synthesized, such as PE2 and PE63, and achieved a better photovoltaic performance.8,9 The halogen atoms of chlorinated groups replacing halogen atoms of fluorinated Y6 were synthesized by Hou et al. and achieved a higher PCE of 16.5%.10 Ding et al. synthesized a new donor with Y6 as the acceptor and achieved a recorded PCE of 18.22% for single-junction OSCs.3 However, polymer donors suffer from batch-to-batch variation and low reproducibility, which hinders mass production. The low-bandgap polymer donor has the disadvantage of weak crystallization characteristics, leading to poor thermal stability and hindering the commercial use of OSCs.11
Polymer solar cells based on conjugated semiconducting polymers as donors and Y6 as the acceptor have shown high photovoltaic performance, and the recorded PCE approaches 19%.12 However, compared with polymer donors, small-molecule donors have the advantages of easy purification, well-defined structures, and improved batch-to-batch consistency in photovoltaic behaviour.13,14 Thus, in comparison to the rapid progress of binary single-junction polymer solar cells, state-of-the-art binary single-junction small-molecule OSCs have achieved better photovoltaic performance. Lu et al. reported all small-molecule OSCs with a PCE of 15.8%.15 Li et al. achieved a PCE value approaching 16% for all small-molecule OSCs.16 The record PCE for all small-molecule OSCs was achieved by Hou et al. (17%).17 Thus, small-molecule OSCs have attracted much interest in the field of photovoltaics. The relatively low photovoltaic performance of OSCs with small-molecule donors is attributed to their low short-circuit current density (JSC), implying the control of phase-separated morphology between the donor and acceptor, nonbalanced photon harvesting from visible light to near-infrared (NIR) light and charge carrier recombination kinetics.18
Traditional binary OSCs, consisting of one donor and acceptor as the photoactive layer, are limited in terms of the light absorption range of the binary photoactive layer and the energy level match of the donors and acceptors.19,20 To address this issue, a ternary strategy, in which another donor or acceptor is introduced into the binary photoactive layer as a third component, has been employed to enable complementary absorption of the binary photoactive layer and allow for matching of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels.2 An appropriate third component material and content may be selected to play versatile roles in balancing photon harvesting from visible to NIR light and optimizing exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface.21,22 Here, ternary OSCs based on small-molecule donors with PCEs greater than 10% are summarized in Table 1.

Wide- or medium-bandgap (Eg ≥ 2.0 eV) donors, such as PBDB-T and PM6, exhibit an absorption peak in the medium-wavelength region; the absorption peaks of the nonfullerene acceptors, including Y6 and IEICO-4F, are located in the long wavelength and in the NIR regions.30 In addition, to better match the light absorption spectrum with the sunlight spectrum and achieve complementary light absorption in the short wavelength region, it is important to develop high-performance ternary OSCs.
Ternary OSCs based on fullerene derivatives as third component materials have attracted much interest and play a vital role in enhancing the photovoltaic performance of ternary OSCs. Due to shallow LUMO energy levels and efficient short wavelength photon harvesting ability, fullerene derivatives based on a single side chain have commonly been used as third component materials, such as phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).31 However, there is less research on ternary OSCs with double side chain fullerene derivatives (such as ICBA and NCBA) as third component materials. In addition, the bisadduct analogues of the [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (bisPC71BM) fullerene derivatives, which have a relatively wide bandgap and a more efficient harvesting of short wavelength photons (300–550 nm range), have upshifted the LUMO energy levels to approximately 280 meV relative to PC71BM.32–34 In this work, the small molecules BTR and Y6 are used as the donor and host acceptor, respectively, and PC71BM and bisPC71BM are used as guest acceptors (third component materials) to fabricate inverted OSCs with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/photoactive layer/MoO3/Ag. BTR:Y6-based binary OSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.56%, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.51 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.86 V and a fill factor (FF) of 68.9%. Nearly 11% PCE enhancement was achieved by the Y6 and bisPC71BM blend as the acceptor (the optimized ratio of BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM was 1:1:0.2), which is attributed to the simultaneous enhancement of VOC, JSC and FF values for the optimized ternary BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM OSCs relative to the binary BTR:Y6 OSCs. Moreover, the introduction of bisPC71BM into the BTR:Y6 blend binary film led to an increased VOC because of the higher LUMO energy level than that of Y6.35,36 In contrast, a PCE enhancement of approximately 6% is shown as a comparison to that of the binary BTR:Y6 OSCs with PC71BM as the third component material (the PCE, VOC, JSC and FF values were 12.25%, 0.888 V, 19.79 mA cm−2 and 69.7%, respectively). This work demonstrates the importance of morphology control in ternary films, and that higher performance can be achieved by selecting appropriate materials to yield an ideal ternary photoactive layer morphology.37
2. Results and discussion
The chemical structures of BTR, Y6, bisPC71BM and PC71BM and the corresponding energy level diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of BTR and Y6 are −3.53 eV, −4.10 eV, −5.34 eV and −5.65 eV, respectively. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of bisPC71BM (−3.70 eV and −5.46 eV) are located between those of BTR and Y6, suggesting that cascade charge transfer can occur in ternary BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM blend films. In addition, compared with Y6 and PC71BM (the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of PC71BM are −3.98 eV and −3.87 eV), bisPC71BM exhibits a relatively high LUMO energy of −3.70 eV, which can result in an enlarged energy bandgap (Eg, energy level offset between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor) and a larger VOC. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of all the OSCs were measured under AM 1.5G with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters (including VOC, JSC, FF and PCE) of all OSCs are listed in Table 2 (the average photovoltaic parameters were obtained from over 10 devices). The J–V curves of BTR:Y6 binary OSCs, BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM and BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary OSCs are shown in Fig. 2a. The BTR:Y6 binary OSCs exhibit a PCE of 11.56%, a JSC of 19.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.86 V, and an FF of 68.9%. The photovoltaic performance was significantly enhanced by incorporating the appropriate bisPC71BM or PC71BM content into the BTR:Y6 binary films (the optimized ratio of BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM and BTR:Y6:PC71BM ratio was 1:1:0.2). In contrast, the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM optimized ternary OSCs show higher photovoltaic performance than the BTR:Y6:PC71BM-optimized ternary OSCs.

The VOC values were monotonically enhanced with increasing third component material content. The alloy model has been commonly proposed to explain the linear variations in the VOC values of ternary OSCs.38,39 The dependence of the VOC and LUMO levels, energy bandgap and energy loss on the Y6:bisPC71BM and Y6:PC71BM ratios is shown in Table S1.† The maximum VOC values of the bulk-heterojunction binary OSC are determined using the Eg value, and the energy loss (Eloss) also plays a crucial role in enhancing the VOC values, as given by the following empirical relation:40  
However, after introducing bisPC71BM or PC71BM into the BTR:Y6 binary films, bisPC71BM or PC71BM and Y6 should form alloy states with mixed LUMO energy levels depending on the blend ratios, and the LUMO value was calculated according to the following formula:41  where ELUMO acceptor1, ELUMO acceptor2, and ELUMO blend are the ELUMO values of Y6, bisPC71BM or PC71BM and the blend acceptor, respectively, and Ne is the quasi-frontier orbital density of the neat material. Ne can be calculated according to the following formula:42,43Ne = nlwhere n, l and f are the molecular number of the unit mass, the number of quasi-degenerate LUMOs per molecule (<0.1 eV) and the weight-composition fractions of the acceptor, respectively. The molecular weight, n, l, and Ne values for Y6 and bisPC71BM are listed in Table S2.†44,45 However, after introducing bisPC71BM or PC71BM into the BTR:Y6 binary films, the VOC value was significantly affected by the bisPC71BM content, according to the following empirical relation:46,47  where VOC binary1, VOC binary2, and VOC ternary are the VOC values of the BTR:Y6 and BTR:bisPC71BM binary OSCs and ternary OSCs, respectively. The blend acceptor has upshifted LUMO levels and enlarged Eg values, which increases the VOC value compared with that of the BTR:Y6 binary OSCs.48 When the ratio of Y6 to bisPC71BM and the ratio of Y6 to PC71BM are 1:0.2, the VOC value of bisPC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs is significantly increased from 0.860 V to 0.916 V, and the VOC value of the PC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs slightly increases from 0.860 V to 0.888 V. As shown in Table S2,† the Eloss value lineally increased with increasing bisPC71BM and PC71BM contents. Although the high LUMO levels of bisPC71BM and PC71BM are beneficial to broaden the bandgap and enhance the VOC value, they still cause a larger voltage loss compared with BTR:Y6 binary OSCs. This result is attributed to that the excessive amount of bisPC71BM, and PC71BM is not beneficial to the compatibility among BTR, Y6 and bisPC71BM or PC71BM.49,50 Another paper reported that an excessive amount of fullerene derivate as a third component material formed over the large phase separation and rough smoothing, which causes a significant decrease in photovoltaic performance and increased voltage loss.51,52
To study the charge carrier recombination kinetics in binary and ternary OSCs, the J–V curve versus a function of light intensity (I) was measured (as shown in Fig. S1, ESI†), and the JSC, VOC and FF values were extracted under different light intensities (as shown in Fig. 3a and b). In general, the power law dependence between JSC and light intensity (I) can be expressed as JSC ∝ Iα, where α is the power-law exponent. The relationship between VOC and I can be expressed as:53, where n and k are the slope of the plot of VOCversus I and the Boltzmann constant, respectively.54 The α values were 0.982, 0.986, and 0.984 for the BTR:Y6 binary OSCs and BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM and BTR:Y6:PC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs, respectively, reflecting more effective suppressed bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions for BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs than that of BTR:Y6 binary OSCs and BTR:Y6:PC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs. The n values are 1.08 and 1.10 kT/q for BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM and BTR:Y6:PC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs, respectively, which are lower than those of BTR:Y6 binary OSCs (n values 1.12). This indicates that the addition of bisPC71BM or PC71BM to the BTR:Y6 binary films efficiently suppressed trap-assisted recombination under open-circuit conditions.55,56 Thus, the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs were more effective in avoiding the charge carrier recombination under short-circuit and open-circuit conditions.57

While the charge carrier recombination was suppressed, the photogenerated charge carrier could dissociate into free electron–hole pairs before the charge carrier recombination and efficient charge carrier transport, and could be collected at an applied voltage. Thus, the efficient suppression of charge carrier recombination should promote more efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport.58,59 The photocurrent density versus the effective voltage (Jph–Veff) was measured to investigate the efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport. As shown in Fig. 3c, the saturation current density (Jsat, the applied voltage is 3.5 V), maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), photocurrent density (Jph) and Jph/Jsat under short-circuit and maximum power-point conditions were calculated according to the following formulae and are summarized in Table 3:60,61Jph = Jlight − JdarkVeff = V0 − VaJsat = qLGmaxwhere Jlight and Jdark are the current densities under AM 1.5G solar illumination and dark conditions, respectively (as shown in Fig. S2†), and Va and V0 are the changing applied voltage and the applied voltage at Jph = 0, respectively. At high reverse voltages (Veff is 3.5 V), Jph reached a saturated photocurrent (Jsat), that is, exciton dissociation was maximized, and the charge carriers were swept out under a high internal electric field. In addition, Jsat is determined by combining the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) and photocurrent in the saturated state. The highest Jsat (20.80 mA cm−2) for the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs is attributed to efficient photon harvesting according to the absorption spectra of the neat materials used and EQE spectra. The efficiency of exciton dissociation and the charge carrier transport can be defined as Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions (Jph/Jsata) and maximum power-point conditions (Jph/Jsatb), respectively. The Jph/Jsata values were 96.7%, 97.1% and 96.9% for the BTR:Y6 binary OSCs, BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM and BTR:Y6:PC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs, while the Jph/Jsatb values were 85.2%, 85.6% and 85.5% for the corresponding OSCs, respectively. These results indicate that the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM optimized ternary OSCs exhibit a higher exciton dissociation rate and more efficient charge carrier transport than the BTR:Y6 binary OSCs and BTR:Y6:PC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs, thus giving rise to larger JSC and FF values. According to the above equation, the highest Jsat value can originate from a combination of sources, including efficient exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and balanced photon harvesting from the visible to NIR light regions for the optimized ternary photoactive layer.62

To further explore the effect of binary and ternary films on exciton dissociation or energy transfer, photoluminescence (PL) quenching and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) are performed (under 450 nm of light excitation).63,64 As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the emission intensity of Y6 in the Y6:bisPC71BM and Y6:PC71BM blend films is significantly quenched compared with that of the neat Y6 film, suggesting exciton dissociation instead of energy transfer at Y6/bisPC71BM and Y6/PC71BM. In contrast, the Y6:bisPC71BM binary films showed stronger PL quenching (the PL decreased by 87% at the optimized ratio of Y6:bisPC71BM) than the Y6:PC71BM binary film (the PL decreased by 82% at the optimized ratio of Y6:PC71BM). The results demonstrated that bisPC71BM addition was indeed helpful to facilitate exciton transfer and sweep out of the dissociated charge carriers at the Y6/bisPC71BM interface, which coincided with the improved JSC and FF in the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM-based optimized ternary OSCs.31,65 As seen in Fig. 4c, the fluorescence lifetimes (η) of the Y6:bisPC71BM binary films were significantly decreased to 2.41 ns and lower than the η value of Y6:PC71BM binary films (the η value was 2.86 ns), which indicates faster and efficient exciton dissociation at the Y6/bisPC71BM interface. The exciton dissociation efficiency (E) could be estimated using the following equation:66  where ηneat and ηblend are the fluorescence lifetimes of the neat and blend films, respectively. There was a higher exciton dissociation efficiency of 62.5% at the Y6/bisPC71BM interface than at the Y6/PC71BM interface (the exciton dissociation efficiency was 55.5%). In addition, the fluorescence lifetimes of the neat BTR, BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM and BTR:Y6:PC71BM binary films were measured, and the effect of bisPC71BM and PC71BM as the third component materials on exciton dissociation was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4d, the η value of neat BTR is 7.81 ns, and the η value of the BTR:Y6:PC71BM ternary film is significantly decreased to 2.89 ns and further decreased to 2.51 ns for the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM ternary film. The shortest fluorescence lifetimes for the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM ternary film indicated more efficient exciton dissociation than for the BTR:Y6:PC71BM ternary film. To further determine whether exciton dissociation occurs at the bisPC71BM/Y6 interface, sandwich devices (without donor materials) were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Y6, Y6:bisPC71BM or Y6:PC71BM/Ca/Al, and the J–V characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G illumination.67 As shown in Fig. 4e, for the Y6:bisPC71BM blend film, a higher JSC value than those of neat Y6 and Y6:PC71BM is observed, which is attributed to the more effective dissociation of photogenerated charge carrier into free charge carriers at the Y6/bisPC71BM interface to produce a higher photocurrent.68,69

The normalized absorption spectra of BTR, Y6, bisPC71BM and PC71BM neat films are shown in Fig. 5a. BisPC71BM shows a more effective short wavelength photon harvesting ability than BTR, Y6 and PC71BM. As shown in Fig. 5b, the three films showed similar long wavelength regions and NIR photon harvesting abilities (longer than 600 nm). In contrast, the BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary film showed a more effective short wavelength photon harvesting ability than the BTR:Y6 binary films and BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary film.70,71

The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to calculate the charge carrier mobility values (the SCLC calculation method is displayed in the ESI,† the J–V curves of representative SCLC devices are shown in Fig. 6, and the calculated values of all the SCLC devices are listed in Table 4). The electron-only and hole-only SCLC devices possessed configurations of ITO/ZnO/photoactive layer/Ca/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/MoO3/Ag.72,73 The BTR:Y6 binary SCLC exhibits the lowest electron mobility (μe of 2.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole mobility (μh of 4.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). After incorporating bisPC71BM into the BTR:Y6 binary films, the μe and μh values are significantly enhanced to 3.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and slightly increased to 4.89 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are higher than those of BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary SCLC devices (the μe value and μh value are 3.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). The slightly increased hole mobility can be ascribed to the improved donor crystallinity and photoactive layer morphology.74 Simultaneously, the ratio of electron to hole mobility is equal to 0.787 for the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM optimized ternary SCLC devices, which represents that the charge transport between the anode and cathode is more balanced than that of the BTR:Y6 binary SCLC devices and BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary SCLC devices.55,75

In addition to the molecular properties and energy levels of the blend films, the charge mobility is closely associated with the crystallization characteristics and surface morphology of the blend films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were employed to probe the influence of bisPC71BM or PC71BM as a third component material in the BTR:Y6 binary films on the crystallization characteristics and surface morphology of the ternary blend films, as presented in Fig. S2 and S3.† As shown in Fig. S3,† the BTR:Y6 binary films exhibit a slight diffraction peak at a 2θ of 29.95 °C, which represents BTR crystallinity, and a dspacing value of 0.298 nm. The 2θ peaks of BTR exhibit a small angle shift to 29.78 °C and 29.32 °C for the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM and BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary films, respectively, corresponding to dspacing values of 0.299 and 0.304 nm. In contrast, the BTR diffraction peak intensities of the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM- and BTR:Y6:PC71BM-optimized ternary films were stronger than those of the BTR:Y6 binary films, suggesting a more ordered molecular arrangement of BTR. The BTR:Y6 binary films showed a neglected acceptor diffraction peak.76 A strong 12.25 °C diffraction peak was clearly observed when Y6:bisPC71BM was used as the electron acceptor, which was attributed to the crystallinity of the enhanced blend acceptor in the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM optimized ternary film, whereas a decreased acceptor diffraction peak intensity was observed for the BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary film compared with the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM optimized ternary film. The blend small-molecule acceptors Y6 and bisPC71BM might be well mixed into the network formed by BTR due to the good compatibility of the blend BTR, Y6 and bisPC71BM.75,77 In addition, the 3D hollow spherical structure of bisPC71BM is beneficial to the connection with the BTR donor and Y6 acceptor, which is beneficial for forming more continuous electron transport channels and high electron mobility.78
AFM images of BTR:Y6 binary films and BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM and BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary films are shown in Fig. S4.† The lower root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the three films were 1.12 nm, 1.15 and 1.19 nm, which were attributed to the good compatibility among the BTR, Y6 and bisPC71BM. The lower RMS value of the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM optimized ternary film than that of the BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary film indicated the better compatibility of both BTR:Y6 binary films and bisadduct analogue of [70]PCBM than that of both BTR:Y6 binary films and single analogue of [70]PCBM fullerene derivatives. The high diffraction peak intensity and the smooth photoactive surface of the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM optimized ternary film are consistent with the high photovoltaic performance of the optimized ternary OSCs.79,80
3. Conclusions
In summary, a series of binary and ternary OSCs were successfully constructed with BTR as the donor and a blend of Y6 and bisPC71BM or PC71BM as the acceptor. The PCE of BTR:Y6 was 11.56%, and the PCE was increased to 12.25% by incorporating 20 wt% PC71BM into BTR:Y6 binary films and further increased to 12.97% by bisPC71BM as a third component material. The BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM optimized ternary film exhibits a higher VOC value of 0.916 compared with the BTR:Y6 binary OSCs (VOC value of 0.860) and BTR:Y6:PC71BM optimized ternary OSCs (VOC value of 0.888). At the same time, the highest JSC value of 20.2 mA cm−2 is attributed to the more efficient short wavelength photon harvesting of the bisPC71BM acceptor than that of the PC71BM acceptor. The crystallization characteristics and surface morphology can be further optimized in the BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM-optimized ternary photoactive layers to achieve efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, supporting a high FF value. This work indicates that the bisadduct analogue of [70]PCBM (bisPC71BM) is a better third component material than the single analogue of [70]PCBM (PC71BM) due to its good compatibility, efficient short wavelength light absorption and high LUMO energy level compared with PC71BM. The blend of BTR, Y6, and bisPC71BM (the optimized BTR:Y6:bisPC71BM ratio of 1:1:0.2) is a promising method to prepare efficient ternary OSCs.
