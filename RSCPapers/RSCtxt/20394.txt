    , Accepted 8th March 2022First published on 9th March 2022AbstractNi-doped La2O3 was developed as an ionic conducting membrane corresponding to a conductivity of 0.187 S cm−1 at 550 °C. A peak power density of 970 mW cm−2 with an open circuit voltage of 1.05 V was achieved using 10 mol% Ni-doped La2O3 (10NLO). XPS and Raman investigations reveal that the performance enhancement is due to the high concentration of oxygen vacancies. Density functional theory calculations verify that Ni doping can tune the band structure of La2O3 to enhance its electrochemical performance. A Schottky junction barrier is formed at the anode to avoid short circuit problems and facilitate the ionic transportation at the anode/electrolyte interface. This study indicates that wide-band gap semiconductors with suitable element-doping can be tuned to be promising ionic conductors for advanced fuel cell applications.
Hydrogen is a helpful resource in reaching a clean, secure and affordable energy future. The transport, buildings and power sectors have potential to use hydrogen.1 Among various fuel cell types, ceramic fuel cells (CFCs) are attractive candidates for future energy conversion devices due to their nominal environmental friendliness, higher efficiency, fuel flexibility and modularity.2 The core component of a CFC is the electrolyte, which must possess high ionic conductivity to ensure good cell performance.3 Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are typical CFCs, usually employing yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as an electrolyte that can reach ionic conductivity (0.1 S cm−1) only at a high temperature range (800–1000 °C).4 This will raise many detrimental problems, such as expensive cost and aggravated technical issues, as well as hindering the steps for commercialization.5 Therefore, the exploration of suitable materials with high ionic conductivity at low temperatures (LTs) is a key challenge for LT-CFCs.
Doping is an effective methodology to generate oxygen vacancies in a lattice or grain boundary by providing more feasible paths for ionic transportation.6 However, there have been thus far very few available materials for CFCs due to the high requirement of an electrolyte with pure ionic conduction and strict limitations on the electronic conduction. For example, since YSZ was discovered 100 years ago, it has been the only available electrolyte for SOFC towards commercialization.7 Ion-doped ceria materials have been developed for decades as alternative SOFC electrolytes; however, due to electronic conduction (i.e. short circuit current through the electrolyte) caused by hydrogen reduction in fuel cell operation, it is yet to succeed as a potential replacement. Thus, development of a high ionic conducting (∼0.1 S cm−1) electrolyte is a challenge that has persisted over a 100-year period for SOFCs or CFCs.
Recently, it was found that semiconductors though possessing intrinsic electronic conduction could be modulated to an ionic conductor for CFCs, e.g. LiCo0.5Al0.5O2 (LCAO),8 SmNiO3 (SNO),9 SrTiO3,10 TiO2,11 and CeO2.12 These materials are of semiconductor nature, but have been applied successfully for advanced CFCs or SOFCs for low temperature (below or at 600 °C) operations. These semiconductor-based electrolytes have inspired us that we can use ion-doping to tune the semiconductor electronic to ionic property by adjusting the band-gap position and specific electronic properties. The representative examples are doped CeO2, doped perovskite-type oxides, etc.13,14
The rare earth lanthanum oxide (La2O3) is one of the emerging ultrawide band gap (UWBG) semiconductors with an energy band gap of 5.9 eV.15 La2O3 is considered as a good insulator because of its relatively large band gap with a high dielectric constant, thermal stability and high electric breakdown strength, which further makes it a potential candidate for metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices.16 Besides, it can be an additive for piezoelectric materials to improve the ferroelectric and piezoelectrical properties.17 Moreover, La2O3 and doped La2O3 are known as a catalyst for oxidative coupling of hydrocarbons.18 However, there is still inadequate knowledge about La2O3 used as an electrolyte membrane for LT-CFCs.
In this study, we developed La2O3 as an advanced CFC electrolyte by Ni-doping, where 5%, 10% and 15% molar percentages of nickel-doped La2O3 (NLO) were fabricated to investigate the Ni doping effect on the electrical properties of La2O3. The fuel cells with NLO electrolyte exhibit higher performance with a peak power density of up to 970 mW cm−2 and high ionic conductivity of 0.187 S cm−1 at 550 °C. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of La2O3 and NLO. The main peaks with 2θ values are indexed at 26.11°, 29.12°, 29.95°, 39.50°, 46.07°, 53.72°, 55.89°, 62.23°, 66.87°, 77.85° and 79.11°, in accordance with the (110), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (201), (202), (104), (211) and (114) diffraction planes of La2O3, respectively. All the peaks are well fitted to the hexagonal structure La2O3 (PDF No. 05-0602) with Pm1(164) as the space group, confirming the formation of single phase La2O3 with no other impurities. Meanwhile, a slight shift of the peak position centered at 29.95° can be obtained, indicating the slightly local structure change after Ni doping because La3+ (1.03 Å) has a smaller ionic radius than Ni2+ (0.69 Å).19 The peak shift demonstrates that Ni has been successfully incorporated into La2O3. In addition, there are some peaks corresponding to lanthanum hydroxide caused by water adsorption in the testing process. The crystal size of the as prepared samples was calculated using the Scherrer equation with an average size of 137, 135, 130 and 125 nm for La2O3, 5NLO, 10NLO and 15NLO, respectively. The crystal size decreases gradually with increasing Ni doping percentage, which is consistent with the XRD results.

Fig. 2a shows the microstructure of the synthesized 10NLO. The 10NLO particles have a spheroidal shape and are homogeneously distributed without agglomeration. Fig. 2(b–d) depicts the EDS mapping for O, La and Ni elements by revealing that the elements are distributed homogeneously in the tested region. It is also noticed that Ni exists in the La2O3 grain region, which further confirms that Ni2+ has been successfully doped into the La2O3 lattice. Fig. S1 (ESI†) presents the HRTEM images of pristine La2O3 and 10NLO. The measured lattice spacing was 0.228 nm, which corresponds to the (012) plane of La2O3. As seen in Fig. S1d, (ESI†) there is an obvious lattice distortion-layer existing on the surface of La2O3 after the Ni2+ doping process, which may be ascribed to the creation of more oxygen vacancies. No other lattice fringes were found in the figure, confirming the absence of impurity phases like NiO.

La2O3 can be individually used as the electrolyte for SOFCs, achieving an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.95 V with a maximum power density of 498 mW cm−2 at 550 °C. This is because of its essence of low ionic conductivity.20 However, the higher cell performance can be substantially achieved by Ni2+ doping. I–V and I–P characteristics of fuel cells with the configuration of Ni-NCAL/NLO/Ni-NCAL at 550 °C in the presence of a H2/air environment are depicted in Fig. 3a. The constructed devices exhibit an OCV above 1.0 V, indicating no electronic leakage.12 The maximum power density (MPD) at 550 °C for the 5NLO, 10NLO and 15NLO electrolyte membranes is 776, 970 and 812 mW cm−2, respectively. The obtained power density enhancement can be ascribed to the improved NLO ionic conductivity, which may be due to the production of oxygen vacancies by the nickel doping into La2O3. However, increasing the dopant concentration up to 15% leads to a decrease of cell performance, because high dopant Ni concentration will result in an unstable host lattice structure.21

Moreover, the three Ni doped samples were ulteriorly tested in fuel cells at reduced temperature ranges to demonstrate the potential in low temperature ranges. As shown in Fig. 3(b–d), the MPD values of 5NLO and 15NLO increase from 483 to 776 mW cm−2 and from 534 to 812 mW cm−2, respectively. In this investigation, 10NLO is the optimum sample where the device peak power density is 704 mW cm−2 at 520 °C, slightly lower than that at 550 °C, because ionic transportation is a thermally activated process. Moreover, the Pmax is higher than 564 mW cm−2 even at 490 °C, indicating that the fuel cells have appreciable ionic conductivity and catalytic activity in the low temperature region. NLO has potential as a promising electrolyte device for LT-SOFCs.
The enhanced fuel cell performance should be ascribed to the improved ionic conductivity and negligible electronic conductivity. Fig. S2(a–c) (ESI†) presents the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) results of NLO with different doping molar ratios in H2/air at 490–550 °C. The curves are fitted with the LR0(R1Q1)(R2Q2) equivalent circuit, inset in Fig. S2a (ESI†), where R0 represents the ohmic resistance, and R1 and R2 are denoted as the charge transfer resistance and mass transfer resistance. Q is the constant phase element (CPE) representing a non-ideal capacitor for circuit modeling. The ohmic resistances of 5NLO, 10NLO and 15NLO at 550 °C are 0.395, 0.374 and 0.386 Ω cm−2. The conductivity is calculated using σ = L/RS, in which L is the thickness of the membrane (0.7 mm) and S is the effective area (0.64 cm2). As depicted in Fig. S2d (ESI†), the conductivity can be calculated as 0.177, 0.187 and 0.181 S cm−1 at 550 °C for 5NLO, 10NLO and 15NLO, respectively. The Ni-dopant method results in enhanced ionic conductivity, thus giving an improved output. In addition, the 10NLO sample exhibits ionic conductivity of 0.158–0.175 S cm−1 at 490–520 °C, meeting the prerequisites of being an electrolyte for LT-CFCs. Interestingly, the electron conductivity is enhanced by the Ni doping process. We conducted a direct current experiment to verify this. The cell with a configuration of Ag/La2O3 (10NLO)/Ag was tested in a nitrogen atmosphere at 550 °C under 3 V DC, and the electron conductivity versus time is shown in Fig. S2e (ESI†). The electronic conductivity of 10NLO is 1.06 × 10−6 S cm−1, larger than that of La2O3 of 6.61 × 10−7 S cm−1.
To further clarify the reasons for the ionic conductivity enhancement after Ni doping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was studied to reveal the change in oxidation states by the doping process. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the O 1s XPS results of the La2O3 and 10NLO samples. There are two main peaks located at 530.3 and 531.4 eV, which can be assigned to the lattice oxygen and carbonate or hydroxyl groups.22 For the pristine La2O3 sample, the peak at 528.1 eV belongs to La(OH)3 because of the water adsorption process.23 After the Ni doping, this peak disappears and a new peak at 536 eV can be clearly observed, indicating that the Ni doping process may decrease the water adsorption process on the surface. In addition, the ratio of O1 to O2 increases from 0.66 to 0.73, demonstrating the decrease of the impurity group and thus the increase of oxygen deficiency in the surface of La2O3.23
Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique commonly used in chemistry to identify molecules and functional groups. The Raman spectra of La2O3 and 10NLO obtained under ambient conditions using a 532 nm excitation laser are shown in Fig. S3(c and d) (ESI†). For both samples, two intense bands at 105.1 and 408.7 cm−1, and one peak at 190.6 cm−1 are observed. The 105.1 cm−1 band corresponds to the Eg mode of crystal La2O3, while the 190.6 cm−1 band can be assigned to the A1g mode. The 408.7 cm−1 band corresponds to the A1g + Eg mode.24 As seen in Fig. S3d, (ESI†) these peaks shift slightly towards lower wavelength for the 10NLO sample. This can be attributed to the increase of oxygen vacancies (OV), because the OV will induce a phonon confinement effect.25 In another aspect, the perfect crystal is destroyed by the existence of OV leading to a significant Raman location shift. Therefore, the ionic conductivity enhancement is mainly owing to the increase of the OV in the 10NLO sample. This phenomenon has been concluded in SnO2 and ZnO nanostructures.25 Raman peaks at 1074.0 and 1070.4 cm−1 corresponding to the hydroxide and carbonate compounds are presented at the surface. These peaks become weak and almost hard to detect after Ni doping, indicating the decrease of impurities in the surface, which is consistent with the XPS results.
Pure La2O3 is a wide band gap semiconductor with Eg of 5.9 eV. However, its band structure can be tuned by Ni-doping. Fig. 4(a) shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of La2O3 and 10NLO. In our investigation, the band gaps of the La2O3 and 10NLO samples are 4.86 and 4.24 eV. Ni-doping reduces the band gap of La2O3, which may have an impact on the electronic conductivity of La2O3. To get insight into the effect of Ni-doping on the band structure of La2O3, first principles calculations were conducted to obtain the detailed density of states for La, Ni and O ions; the results are shown in Fig. 4(b). In the case of 10NLO, it is found that doping of Ni cations contributes to forming a new sub-band gap energy level because the Ni d band lies above the O–p orbitals in the VB. This subenergy is beneficial for the electron transfer process of the adsorded oxygen species, which facilitates the oxygen ion transportation.26

Although the semiconductor is utilized as the electrolyte for LT-CFC, there is no short circuit problem in such devices. In our case, high OCV and power density are achieved in the fuel cells constructed using NLO as the electrolyte membrane. The current responses of bias voltage for the Ni-NCAL/10NLO half-cell were studied in air and after H2 treatment and the results are shown in Fig. 4(c and d). The current record shows a linear response in an air atmosphere, implying that there is no junction effect between NCAL and 10NLO. After H2 flowing to the NCAL, there is an obvious rectification response emerging in the I–V characteristic curve, indicative of the junction effect in such a device.
We propose an explanation based on the La2O3 band structure as shown in Fig. 4(e). The conduction band (CB) position and valence band (VB) position are −2.34 eV and −7.5 eV, respectively, while the work function of nickel metal is 5.4 eV.27 When they are in contact, electrons will transfer from the nickel to the 10NLO until the Fermi level is aligned. This process may cause band bending and a Schottky junction is formed in situ at the anode side to inhibit electrons passing through the electrolyte. Moreover, the surface of Ni is positively charged and NLO is negatively charged, resulting in a built-in electric field (BIEF) at the interface. The BIEF can block electrons passing through the anode/NLO interface, thus avoiding the electronic short-circuiting problem, whilst simultaneously facilitating the ionic transportation process near the interface, which contributes to the performance enhancement in the prepared device.
In this work, NLO has been prepared as the electrolyte of LT-SOFCs through a co-precipitation process. The assembled NLO fuel cell device achieved a maximum power density of 970 mW cm−2 and enhanced ionic conductivity of 0.187 S cm−1 at 550 °C. Moreover, the ionic conductivity of La2O3 is enhanced by the Ni doping process. On the other aspect, Ni incorporation behaviour tunes the band structure of La2O3, thus facilitating oxygen ion mobility. The Schottky junction is proposed to form at the anode side in order to effectively avoid the short circuit problem and contribute to enhancing the ionic conductivity. These findings suggest that an ultrawide band gap semiconductor can be used as a promising material for LT-SOFC applications.
