    , Accepted 3rd May 2021First published on 3rd May 2021AbstractMetal organic frameworks (MOFs) based on titanium and carboxylic acid derivatives have been recently proposed as mediators of multiple photoinduced processes in substitution of traditional semiconductor materials. In the case of MIL-125-NH2, the introduction of the amino group extends its photoactivity to the visible region with respect to MIL-125, but it is also responsible for reducing its hydrostability, which strongly limits its application in aqueous media. Here, it is shown that the destabilization of the frame by hydrolysis and dissolution processes can be controlled and minimized if the medium is regulated to pH 7 or lower. By taking into account these considerations, we explored the use of MIL-125-NH2 as a mediator in the visible photogeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) by using triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electronic donor in environments where the framework structure is not compromised. It was found that the concentration of NADH produced depends on the pH of the medium, since the degree of protonation of the donor and the surface charge of the particles are markedly affected in the working range. The maximum yield was obtained in neutral conditions (pH 7) provided by a buffer of cationic nature. Thus, MIL-125-NH2 is envisaged as a potential suitable support for photochemical activation of NAD-dependent enzymes operating in aqueous neutral media.
1. Introduction
Enzymatic catalysis is an interesting approach to drive chemical processes with low energetic cost and high selectivity and specificity.1,2 However, several factors strongly limit these applications. An important restriction is the loss of activity under operative conditions, which has prompted the design of immobilized enzymatic systems to reduce the denaturalization and favor recycling.3 Another limiting factor is related to the need of specific cofactors, which assist the biocatalyst by acting as a conveyor of electrons, protons and groups of atoms or molecules. Among the broad gamma of enzymes, the oxidoreductases are the most attractive ones from the economic point of view because they catalyze important reactions such as the asymmetric reduction of CO groups, the oxygenation, epoxidation and hydroxylation of bonds, etc., allowing compounds with practical applications to be obtained.4 Nicotinamide cofactors gain particular importance since approximately 80% of the oxidoreductase enzymes require Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD(H)) to operate, while an additional fraction of 10% needs the phosphorylated form.5 The high price of the cofactor hinders its use in stoichiometric ratios, provided that it acts in turn as a sacrifice species under artificial conditions.6 This issue has triggered the development of regeneration methods, particularly of reduced nicotinamide cofactor (NADH) through enzymatic, chemical, electrochemical and photochemical strategies.5,7–10 However, regeneration induced by photons in the visible region has generated special attraction since it involves the possibility of using solar light as a free, clean and inexhaustible energy source, in an attempt to emulate natural processes. Commonly, most of the strategies comprise the excitation of a photosensitizer based in molecular complexes of rare elements such as Ru or Rh,11 nanoparticles of expensive metals such as Pt and Au,12 photo unstable semiconductors of toxic nature as for example CdS and CdSe13 and, in many cases, additional species used as electronic mediators, which can also bear some toxicity, like methyl viologen.14 Therefore, the design of simple systems based on materials of cheap and easy obtainment and low toxicity that allow the efficient capture and conversion of solar energy for NADH regeneration is still a challenge.
Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as an interesting class of hybrid polymeric materials constituted by extended tridimensional networks of ions or discrete metallic oxo-clusters connected by organic linkers.15 An enormous variability of inorganic and organic precursors allows the modulation of the properties (at morphological, surface, chemical, and optoelectronic levels) making them very versatile materials for applications in multiple processes such as adsorption, gases storage, drug-delivery, catalysis and photoinduced processes, among others.16–20 Titanium and carboxylate-based MOFs represent potable alternatives to traditional oxide and chalcogenide semiconductors, since they share the same constitutive materials with totally tunable optical and electronic properties by combining the broad absorption response of the organic molecules and the photoinduced redox activity of the metallic centers.21 In this context, MIL-125-NH2 (based on titanium and 2-aminoterephthalic acid) is a MOF with low toxicity and simple preparation that has acquired great significance because the introduction of the –NH2 group reduces the energy of the band gap with respect to the isoreticular MIL-125,22 allowing its use as a mediator under visible excitation.23–25 However, the linker modification results in an increase of hydrophilicity and decrease of stability in water (both vapor and liquid).26 Thus, under these conditions, MIL-125-NH2 may not comply with the requisites of a good photocatalyst, in the classical sense. Although it is reported that the loss of crystallinity can be reduced by increasing the linker hydrophobicity,27 the basic mechanisms of destabilization of MIL-125-NH2 in aqueous media with different characteristics have not been evaluated in depth. An integral understanding of the causes and effects of destabilization in these media is necessary to provide control and, in the best case, to guarantee the stability of the framework and maximize the efficiency of the processes to be conducted on this platform.
In this work, we report an exhaustive study of the destabilization mechanism of MIL-125-NH2 in aqueous buffered solutions at different pHs by combining the analysis of the species released to the solution through novel strategies and the evaluation of the morphological and crystallographic properties of the remaining solids. In this way, we define a window of conditions under which the stability of MIL-125-NH2 is ensured. Moreover, we report for the first time the utilization of MIL-125-NH2 as a photocatalyst for the direct visible regeneration of an NADH cofactor in buffered aqueous media without mediators.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
Sodium acetate (Cicarelli), ammonium chloride (Cicarelli), 2-aminoterephthalic-acid (99%), titanium isopropoxide (97%), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide sodium salt (≥95%, GC grade), triethanolamine (TEOA, ≥99.0%, GC grade), Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (ACS Reagent, ≥99.8%) and methyl viologen dichloride hydrate (98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, ACS grade, Sintorgan), methanol (HPLC Grade, Sintorgan), glacial acetic acid (100%, Biopack), ammonium hydroxide (p.a. 26.0–30.0%, Biopack) and hydrochloric acid (Biopack) were used as received.
2.2 Synthesis of MIL-125-NH2
MIL-125-NH2 particles were synthesized following a previously reported solvothermal strategy.28 In a typical synthesis, 0.66 g (3.64 mmol) of 2-aminoterephthalic acid were dissolved in 30 mL of a mixture of DMF and methanol (90:10) under stirring. Then, 0.55 mL of titanium isopropoxide were added and the reaction mixture was kept under vigorous stirring for 10 minutes. Posteriorly, the precursor mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 16 h in a programmable oven. An initial ramp of 1 °C min−1 was used to achieve the final temperature. After the solvothermal reaction, a yellow solid powder was isolated by centrifugation at 7500 rpm during 10 minutes. Then, the product was washed twice with 20 mL of DMF to remove unreacted species and then, two further washes with 20 mL of methanol to eliminate the DMF. Finally, the solid was activated under vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h and after that, it was stored at room temperature for characterization and use.
2.3 Stability tests
The stability of MIL-125-NH2 was studied in aqueous media under different pHs and constant ionic strength by analyzing the supernatant solution and remnant solids. In a typical experiment, suspensions with a concentration of 1 g L−1 of MIL-125-NH2 in unbuffered water (pH 6), 0.05 mol L−1 acetate buffer (pHs 4 and 5), 0.05 mol L−1 phosphate buffer, PBS (pHs 6, 6.5 and 7), 0.05 mol L−1 Tris–HCl buffer (pHs 7 and 8.5) or 0.05 mol L−1 ammonia buffer (pH 9.7) were prepared. In all cases, the solid dispersions were treated by 1 minute of sonication, and then, the suspensions were kept under constant stirring in the dark. Periodically, aliquots were taken from the reactor and ultracentrifuged at 13500 rpm for 10 minutes. In a first analysis, the supernatant solutions were analyzed by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, registering the absorption spectra in a diode array Agilent 8453 spectrometer. Additionally, the samples were analyzed by emission spectroscopy in a SILVER-Nova (StellarNet) spectrometer with the purpose of evaluating the presence of released species from MIL-125-NH2 decomposition. Emission spectra were obtained with excitation wavelength λEXC = 330 ± 10 nm. The concentration of 2-aminoterephthalate anion was determined from the emission intensity at 430 nm and the calibration curve method. Samples were adequately diluted to achieve absorbance equal to or less than 0.15, in order to avoid autoabsorption effects.
The effect of the pH of the medium on the morphology and crystallinity of MIL-125-NH2 particles was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) under selected conditions.
2.4 Photochemical generation of an NADH cofactor
Photoinduced generation of NADH was performed in a 20 mL-cylindrical cell under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixtures containing MIL-125-NH2 (1 g L−1), NAD+ (5 × 10−4 mol L−1) and TEOA (0.01 mol L−1), as an acceptor and a sacrificial electronic donor, respectively, were prepared in different buffered media (pH 4–7). The dispersions were deaerated by bubbling nitrogen for 15 min, and then sealed to ensure anaerobic conditions throughout. Monochromatic irradiation was carried out with a blue LED lamp emitting at 470 ± 10 nm (30 W, OSA Opto Lights). Metal meshes were used to attenuate the photonic flux and the infrared component was avoided by intercepting a water filter. Periodically, samples of the reaction mixture were taken and then ultracentrifuged to evaluate the presence of products of the reaction in the supernantant. The production of NADH was determined by UV absorption at 340 nm (ε = 6220 cm−1 mol−1 L) and the results were obtained from the average of three independent measurements. In parallel, control experiments were performed with all components without irradiation, and under irradiation but in the absence of NAD+. The NADH production by photoreduction of NAD+ was confirmed by HPLC using the retention time as identification criteria, which was determined by analyzing a standard solution of this species. Measurements were performed using a chromatograph provided of a UV-Visible photodiode array detector (UV2000-Thermo Separation Products) equipped with a ODS2, 5 μm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, Water Spherisorb column. Pure water was used as the eluent and the detection was performed at λ = 340 nm.
Methyl viologen (MV2+) was used in replacement of NAD+ in a series of experiments. In a typical one, 3 mL of an aqueous suspension containing MIL-125-NH2 (5 g L−1) and TEOA (0.01 mol L−1) was purged with nitrogen in a cuvette of flat walls and irradiated with a blue LED lamp emitting at 470 ± 10 nm (30 W, OSA Opto Lights) for 10 minutes to produce the photodoping of the MOF semiconductor. Then, a volume of 50 μL of MV2+ solution (0.15 mol L−1) was added in anaerobic conditions to verify the presence of accumulated electrons in the conduction band of MIL-125-NH2.
2.5 Characterization of the solids
The crystalline properties of the samples were analyzed via powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The analysis was carried out on a X’Pert PRO (PANalytical) powder X-ray diffractometer, with Cu Kα (1.54 Å) as the incident radiation and operated at an accelerating voltage of 40 kV with a current intensity of 40 mA.
The infrared measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Fourier transform spectrophotometer model Spectrum BX, equipped with a DTGS detector. Measurements were carried out on pressed pellets, using potassium bromide as the diluent. The spectra resulted from the average of 15 scans, taken at 1 cm−1 resolution vs. the appropriate single-beam background spectrum.
The morphological and superficial characteristics of the samples were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by applying 15 kV in a JEOL JSM-6460 LV, which was equipped with an AMC EDAX detector, model EDAM IV. For the analysis, a ca. 10 μL-drop of colloidal suspension in methanol was put on a copper-supported carbon foil (SEM grid), dried under a red-light lamp and then, the samples were metallized with Pt sputtering by means of a Denton Vacuum Desk II to enhance its electronic conduction properties.
The diffuse reflectance UV-visible (DRUV) spectra of the powered samples were obtained with a SILVER-Nova (StellarNet) spectrometer provided with a transmission probe R600-8-UVVIS-SR.
Zeta potential measurements were performed in a Zetasizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments Ltd). For these determinations, suspensions of MIL-125-NH2 (0.1 mg L−1) containing KCl 1 × 10−3 mol L−1 were prepared and their pH value was adjusted with either hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. These samples were equilibrated for 5 min and had their pH checked with commercial pH-indicator strips before the zeta potential measurements. The informed zeta potential is the average of five consecutive measurements.
3. Results and discussion
MIL-125-NH2 synthesized by a solvothermal reaction was characterized by XRD, FTIR and SEM techniques. The X-ray diffraction pattern, shown in Fig. 1a, is identical to that reported previously by Bibi et al. for the isomorph pristine MIL-125, where the most dominant Bragg's reflections correspond to the crystal planes (101) and (002).29Fig. 1b shows the FTIR spectrum of MIL-125-NH2, from which the structural features and functional groups of the MOF can be confirmed, in comparison with the FTIR spectrum of 2-aminoterephthalic acid. The bands located at 3443 and 3356 cm−1 are characteristic of symmetric and asymmetric stretching of –NH2 groups and confirm that they are free of coordination.30 In addition, no bands are observed in the wavelength range between 2500 and 3100 cm−1, which indicates that the –OH of the carboxylate group in the 2-aminoterephthalic acid molecule is not free but compromised in the structural coordination of the metalorganic network. The band centered at 1536 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching of a O–C–O bond.29,31 On the other hand, the bands centered at 1256 and 1388 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching of the N–C bond corresponding to aromatic amines, while the bands located at 1657 and 771 cm−1 match the vibration of the N–H bending mode.32 Finally, the absorbance registered in the range 400–800 cm−1 corresponds to the vibration of O–Ti–O bonds that form the titanium oxo-clusters in the crystalline structure of MIL-125-NH2.33Fig. 1c shows the SEM image of MIL-125-NH2. It is found that the synthesized particles are thin disk-like in shape with circular (mostly) or tetragonal borders and a size of 0.62 ± 0.21 μm in the major length section, in agreement with data reported for similar syntheses. According to Hu et al., this variability in the morphology of the particles is related to differences in the effective solvent volume at the crystal level, so it can be modulated by the concentration of the reactants during crystallization.34

Exposition of MIL-125-NH2 to buffered aqueous media results in the growing of two bands in the UV region of the absorption spectrum of the supernatant, one located between 300 and 380 nm and another one shifted to the blue (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The position and time evolution of the lower energy band strongly depend on the pH of the medium. In all cases, the band is present from the beginning of the exposition of MIL-125-NH2 and we observe a subtle bathochromic shift during its growth, which is more important for the acidic media studied. Thus, for pH 4 the band initially centered at 322 moves around 22 nm towards lower energies after 6 hours of exposure (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Moreover, it can be verified that the pH of the medium affects the rate at which the band grows. The effect is rather significant as evidenced in Fig. 2, which shows the absorbance at 330 nm of the supernatant as a function of the exposition time of MIL-125-NH2 in different buffered media.
 Fig. 2  Time evolution of the absorbance at 330 nm of the supernatant obtained after exposition of MIL-125-NH2 in unbuffered and regulated aqueous media at different pHs. Conditions: acetate buffer (pH 4 and 5), pure water (pH 6), phosphate buffer (pH 6 and 7), Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7 and 8.5) and ammonia buffer (pH 9.7). In all the cases, the concentration of the buffer solutions was 0.05 mol L−1. 
The UV absorption band increases very slowly when the frame is exposed to aqueous media buffered at pH 7 or lower (see Fig. S1, ESI†) and changes in the color of the suspension were not evidenced. Instead, the suspension in pure water and in aqueous media regulated at alkaline pH exhibits a fast growth of the band indicating that the MOF undergoes a destabilization process, which is also evidenced by a gradual loss of the coloration of the suspended solids (see Fig. S2, ESI†). In the most extreme studied condition (pH 9.7), the yellow solid turns grey-white within the first 2 hours of exposure and, from this moment, the absorbance at 330 nm of the supernatant reaches a constant value, as shown in Fig. 2. This suggests that the changes in the absorbance correspond to some structural species from the MOF itself. Likewise, the experiment carried out on MIL-125-NH2 without the previous thermal activation treatment (see Experimental section) led to the same results as those shown in Fig. 2, thus discarding the assignation of this band to by-products of the synthesis trapped in the MOF matrix.
While many MOFs have been found to be water-resistant, a significant fraction of them are very active towards reaction with water molecules by displacement or hydrolysis, which strongly affects their potential applications.35,36 Current knowledge indicates that titanium and carboxylate-based MOFs, especially MIL-125-NH2, are very likely to destabilize when exposed to vapor or liquid water from uncontrolled hydrolysis reactions that lead to the incipient formation of TiO2.27 This fact can be attributed to the joined effects of the high polarizing power of Ti(IV)37 and the strong Lewis basicity character of N in aniline, with hydrophilicity favouring the interaction between the MOF surface and water molecules by hydrogen bonds.38 Logan et al., based on the retention of crystallinity as a unique stability criterion, indicated that MIL-125-NH2 remains stable for an average of 15 days when exposed to water at different pHs and room temperature.27 However, the dependence on the pH of the medium in those studies is not clear, while several reports cast doubt on the conclusions obtained from XRD as a single study tool.26,39 In agreement with other authors, we consider that to conclude at a high level of confidence regarding the stability of MOFs in water, it is necessary to implement complementary analysis techniques, since destabilization processes may begin to occur sooner than the XRD is capable of detecting.26,39 In this sense, the high crystallinity of MOFs and the low sensitivity on amorphous phases may limit the application of XRD to evidence early destabilization processes. However, reports approaching the study of this issue are very scarce.38 To test this hypothesis, we combined XRD and SEM analysis of the remaining solid obtained after different times of exposure of MIL-125-NH2 to a medium in which intermediate behavior is observed, i.e. in pure water as shown in Fig. 2. As observed in Fig. 3a, the diffraction pattern of MIL-125-NH2 remains unchanged during the time range studied. Although the relative height of the peaks changes very slightly, no new peaks become visible. However, SEM images with high magnification of isolated particles (Fig. 3b) indicate the existence of a marked surface corrosion that is accentuated with increasing exposure time. In addition, the microscopy images are consistent with the appearance of new species in the MOF surface, which is consistent with the gradual loss of the yellow coloration of MIL-125-NH2 (see Fig. S2, ESI†). These results demonstrate that the insensitivity of the powder XRD technique can lead to temporarily erroneous conclusions regarding the stability of MIL-125-NH2 and the MOFs, in general. Similar observations were performed in the utilization of MIL-125-NH2 and UiO-66-NH2 as a support in cyclical water-sorption experiments for heat transformation in an atmosphere of humidified argon, where the loss of water loading capacity of the material could be correlated with the considerable decrease of the surface area, while the XRD patterns remained unchanged.38
 Fig. 3  (a) XRD and (b) SEM images of MIL-125-NH2 particles before and after their suspension in unbuffered pure water (pH 6). 
The molecular formula of MIL-125-NH2 is Ti8O8(OH)4(C6H3C2O4NH2)6, arranged in a 3D pseudo-cubic tetragonal structure in which the 2-aminoterephthalic linker binds titanium octameric inorganic subunits arranged cyclically.40 Although the stability of MIL-125-NH2 in water has been studied by XRD and surface area determinations or titanium-leaching tests by ICP under irradiation conditions,41 the spectroscopic evaluation of the released ligand could provide valuable information. In particular, 2-aminoterephthalic acid, like its polymeric derivatives, shows a strong blue-violet fluorescence under UV excitation that allows monitoring it in solution to study the processes related to the instability of MIL-125-NH2 in real time (see Fig. S3a, ESI†).42 Comparison of emission spectra normalized by absorbance, for the supernatant obtained in pure water and for a standard solution, indicates that 2-aminoterephthalate is the only species that contributes to the observed emission (see Fig. S3b, ESI†). Quantification of the anion of 2-aminoterephthalate acid (pKa1 = 3.87 and pKa2 = 4.77)27 released to the supernatant during exposure of MIL-125-NH2 to aqueous media regulated at different pHs is shown in Fig. 4. According to these results, the ligand is rapidly released during direct exposure of the MOF to pure water or alkaline-buffered media, with concomitant degradation of the framework, as summarized in Table 1. Instead, when MIL-125-NH2 is suspended in aqueous buffered medium at pH 7 (or lower) its degradation rate decreases around 85-fold with respect to what is observed at pH 9.7, and between 8 and 9-fold in comparison with pH 8.5 or unbuffered medium, respectively (Table 1). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4, MIL-125-NH2 is remarkably stable for prolonged times at neutral pH and, after 12 h of exposition, only around 5% of the ligand is released. This demonstrates that it is possible to keep the integrity of the MOF by conveniently modulating the pH of the medium, thus allowing its utilization in bulk water as a solvent.

In all the cases, the concentration of the buffer solutions was 0.05 mol L−1. The percentage of ligand released, indicated in the right axis, was estimated from the initial concentration of the MOF in the suspension and its molecular weight.

Surprisingly, not all of the 2-aminoterephthalate contained in the MOF is released even after the extended exposure to the harshest conditions studied. Analysis by DRUV spectroscopy of the white solid obtained after 4 h of exposure at pH 9.7 still shows an absorption component in the visible region that could be attributed to remnants of the MOF or to occluded linker (see Fig. S4a, ESI†). Furthermore, although the FTIR spectrum of this solid lacks fine structure, some bands of the MIL-125-NH2 precursor can be distinguished. In addition, the spectrum resembles that of TiO2 P25, which allows us to hypothesize that it is mainly about this species (see Fig. S4b, ESI†). However, no peaks are observed in the X-ray diffractogram shown in Fig. 5, probably due to the amorphous character of the TiO2 particles of subnanometric size and the presence of hydroxides. To test this hypothesis, we exposed the solid at 500 °C for 30 min and obtained the anatase diffraction pattern (JCPDS 21-1272), as shown in Fig. 5.43 Therefore, a plausible explanation is that when MIL-125-NH2 is exposed to an alkaline aqueous medium, the high hydroxide concentration induces the fast formation of TiO2 on its surface, resulting in a dense shell that could passivate it preventing further hydrolysis. Unlike other reports,27 we did not observe the anatase phase in the XRD of the solids after exposure to strong alkaline medium, which is probably due to the nucleation conditions defined by the low concentrations used in this work. This result demonstrates that the conclusions obtained from the stability tests strongly depend on the conditions of the experiments.

Based on this evidence, we propose that the degree of degradation by hydrolysis/dissolution of the framework can be modulated by the pH of the medium, being practically inhibited at acidic-neutral pHs as described in Scheme 1. The reduction of pH observed in the first moments after the dispersion of MIL-125-NH2 in unbuffered pure water supports the proposed mechanism (see Fig. S5, ESI†). Likewise, the constant pH value reached over long times under these conditions explains the plateau observed in Fig. 2 and 4, as due to the buffer system of 2-aminoterephthalic acid/2-aminoterephthalate formed, which reduces the degradation rate of the MOF (see Fig. S5, ESI†).
 Scheme 1  Proposed mechanism at surface level for the degradation by hydrolysis/dissolution of MIL-125-NH2 in water. 
MIL-125-NH2 is a semiconductor MOF assumed to have a direct band gap,44 for which yellow coloration is attributed to a band with the absorption edge extending to around 550 nm (see Fig. S4a, ESI†). This absorption originates in the ligand-to-metal-charge-transfer from O to Ti atoms in TiO5(OH) oxoclusters associated with π–π* transitions in aromatic rings.23 The optical bandgap of MIL-125-NH2 was estimated from a Tauc plot, yielding a value of 2.71 eV (see ESI,† Fig. S6), in agreement with previous reports.44 The magnitude of the negative value reported for the conduction band of MIL-125-HN2, located at −0.63 V (vs. NHE),45 together with its high capacity for gas adsorption, has motivated its application as a mediator of difficult photoreductions such as that of CO2 under visible irradiation, generally in organic solvents as medium.23,24,46 From the energetic point of view, MIL-125-NH2 could be an adequate photocatalyst to drive the NADH generation from visible-photoinduced reduction of NAD+ (, pH 7 vs. NHE).6 However, NADH production should be performed in aqueous media to avoid disturbing the integrity of the biological molecule and to facilitate the potential coupling to some enzymatic system. The photoreduction of NAD+ in an aqueous medium catalyzed by active MOFs in the visible region requires the application of systems with a great capacity to separate charges and that support the reaction conditions. Recently, Wu et al. have reported a core-cell MOF system composed of UiO-66-NH2 as a photoactive core and [Cp*Rh(bpydc)H2O]2+ cell as a hydride donor that shows high activity for the visible photogeneration of NADH (80% of conversion) in a Tris–HCl/TEOA buffer (pH 7.0).47 The robustness of the system is achieved by the choice of Zr-based MOF, such as UiO-66-NH2, which presents exceptional hydrostability as a consequence of its high coordination number.26 In the case of titanium and carboxylate-based MOFs, which have excellent photoredox properties but moderate aqueous robustness, a simple approach consists in defining the conditions where the framework can be used without substantially affecting its structure. Therefore, we studied the generation of NADH from NAD+ photoreduction in buffered aqueous media by fixing the pH between 4 and 7, the range where the chemical stability of MIL-125-NH2 is guaranteed. Fig. 6a summarizes the results obtained during anaerobic visible irradiation of MIL-125-NH2 suspension (1 g L−1) in buffer Tris–HCl (0.05 mol L−1) at pH 7 containing NAD+ (5 × 10−4 mol L−1) and TEOA (0.01 mol L−1) as an acceptor and sacrificial electronic donor, respectively. In these conditions, the absorbance at 340 nm of the supernatant of the reaction mixture increases markedly with irradiation time, while the control experiments in the dark (Fig. 6b) demonstrate that the observed band is generated from a photoinduced process. After 4 h of monochromatic irradiation at 470 ± 10 nm, the concentration of NADH obtained can be estimated as 0.172 mmol L−1, which represents around 35% of conversion in comparison with the initial amount of NAD+ added. On the other hand, the blank assay performed under irradiation and in the presence of TEOA and absence of NAD+ (Fig. 6b), not only indicates that the product evolves from the photoreduction of the electronic acceptor but also confirms the suitable photostability of the framework in the selected working conditions. According to our determinations, the sensitivity for the detection by emission techniques of 2-aminoterephthalate is more than 30 times higher than for NADH. In this condition, traces of 2-aminoterephthalate that are generated even at neutral pH, mask the poor fluorescence of NADH centered at 470 nm, which makes its identification by this technique difficult. Therefore, the photocatalytic synthesis of 1,4-NADH was confirmed by identifying this product by HPLC from comparison with the retention time determined under the same conditions for a standard solution of enzymatically active 1,4-NADH (see Fig. S7, ESI†).

(b) Evolution of the absorbance change at 340 nm during the photoinduced reaction (i), reaction blanks in the absence of NAD+ (ii), and in the absence of light (iii). The initial contribution at the measured absorbance was subtracted in (b). 
During visible irradiation under anaerobic conditions of MIL-125-NH2 in the presence of NAD+ and TEOA, the originally bright-yellow suspension acquires a faint greenish coloration. Commonly, this photochromic effect is attributed to the reduction of Ti(IV) to Ti(III) by the photoinduced charge transfer from the organic ligand to the metal, where the green coloration is due to the inter-band transitions of the electrons accumulated in the conduction band, which are in turn generated in the presence of an adequate hole scavenger.23 The possibility of accumulation of phototogenerated electrons in our reaction conditions was demonstrated in parallel experiments of photodoping and subsequent addition of methylviologen. This species can be reduced by the Ti(III) species to give its radical cation, which presents a characteristic blue coloration that vanishes in contact with atmospheric oxygen (see ESI,† Fig. S8). Based on this evidence, we propose that the NAD+ molecule is reduced by the photogenerated electrons located in the conduction band of MIL-125-NH2 after its intra bandgap visible excitation by two single-electron reductions and a protonation step. The mechanism of direct NADH generation is often assumed within electrochemical and photochemical approaches performed in the absence of hydride donors.48,49 TEOA 50 acts as a sacrificial electron donor by suppressing photogenerated holes in the valence band located at around 2 V (vs. NHE) and the catalytic cycle is complete, as proposed in Scheme 2. For the reaction performed at pH 7, the replacement of TEOA by other usual hole scavengers such as isopropanol, ascorbic acid or aniline in comparable and major concentrations, did not allow the production of measurable amounts of NADH and neither evidenced color changes in the suspension due to electron accumulation. Assuming the mechanism proposed by Grätzel et al.,50 in which glycolaldehyde and diethanolamine are produced by TEOA oxidation, the radical cation generated in the first-electron transfer from hole abstraction, could be rearranged by deprotonation and inject a second electron into the MIL-125-NH2 conduction band, thus increasing their concentration and consequently, favoring the reduction of NAD+.

The effect of the pH in the formation of NADH was also investigated. Fig. 7a shows the concentration of NADH produced for different pHs of the buffer solution, varied between 4 and 7 units. At neutral pH, a maximum yield is observed, while the NADH concentration generated gradually decreases as the pH of the medium becomes more acidic. The low reactivity of the photocatalytic system in acidic media can be rationalized in terms of the loss of the ability to oxidize exhibited by TEOA, since the deprotonation step necessary for radical rearrangement after the transfer of the first electron becomes less likely.51 However, to explain the tendency observed in Fig. 7a it is necessary to explore the protonation state of the hole scavenger and the surface charge of the MIL-125-NH2 particles as a function of pH since, unlike oxides and chalcogenides, in most MOF semiconductors photoinduced charge carriers are not mobile, so oxidation and reduction reactions will occur close to where they are generated.52 TEOA is a basic molecule that in aqueous solution is in equilibrium with its protonated form, with a pKa = 7.9.50 On the other hand, Fig. 7b shows the zeta potential values determined for MIL-125-NH2 particles at different pHs. These results suggest an isoelectric potential at pH ∼ 4.5. Therefore, since the concentration of NADH obtained at pH 4 and 5 (Fig. 7a) is very low and practically the same, we can infer that the protonated form of TEOA (amounting more than 99% of the species in this pH range, see ESI,† Fig. S9) does not act as a hole scavenger in the photocatalytic process. The gradual increase in the concentration of NADH produced at less acidic pHs is in line with the increasing of the fraction of TEOA in its neutral form that acts as a sacrificial electronic donor, which reaches a fraction of 12% at pH 7 (see ESI,† Fig. S9) and this translates into a maximum yield under the evaluated conditions. Finally, as it can be seen in Fig. 7a, from the results obtained at pH 7, the photoreaction yield shows a dependence on the nature of the buffer. The use of a cationic buffer such as Tris–HCl versus an anionic one, such as PBS, leads to a higher production of NADH, which suggests a role of the photocatalyst's surface charge in setting the difference observed. To test this hypothesis, we measured the zeta potential of the particles in Tris–HCl and in PBS (both 0.05 mol L−1) as a way to estimate the surface charge, and obtained values of −21.42 and −37.84 mV, respectively. Based on this evidence, we infer that when we control the pH at 7 with a cationic buffer, the MOF particles surface charge is reduced, minimizing the electrostatic repulsion with the high electron density of the nitrogen atom of the TEOA, thus favoring its access at reactive sites of the porous framework and, in this way, the NAD+ photoreduction performance is improved.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the stability of MIL-125-NH2 in an aqueous medium at regulated pHs was studied in detail by conventional techniques with high sensitivity, which allow monitoring the destabilization processes in real time. The results show that the destabilization of the MOF begins at the first moments of the exposition to alkaline media or pure water. In turn, the degree of hydrolysis/dissolution can be modulated by pH, being minimized in the acid-neutral range, thus enabling adequate use in aqueous environments under these conditions. Besides, MIL-125-NH2 exhibited high activity as a mediator for the photogeneration of NADH under visible monochromatic excitation (λ = 470 ± 10 nm) at pH 7. This result gives support to extend the application frontiers of the framework in biophotocatalytic systems together with a large number of enzymes that critically require this cofactor to operate and can be assisted by photogenerated NADH or activated by direct electronic injection.
