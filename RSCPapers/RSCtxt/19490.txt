    , Accepted 24th June 2022First published on 30th June 2022AbstractA high-conductivity thiocyanate ionic liquid (EMIMSCN) was introduced into perovskite solar cells for the first time. The high conductivity of EMIMSCN ensures an adequate supply of free SCN− anions and EMIM+ cations, so as to multifunctionally passivate the I vacancy and Pb–I antisite defects and realize an optimized interfacial energy level. Consequently, the devices with EMIMSCN treatment achieve a high PCE of 22.55% with substantial enhancement in stability. This simple and efficient strategy provides new insights into the selection of passivation agents for efficient and stable PSCs.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been known as a competitive candidate in photovoltaic devices owing to their superior charge transport ability, high defect tolerance and simple processability.1–3 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is rapidly growing under various effective improvement strategies to a certified value of 25.7%.1 Despite the encouraging PCEs, the performance of PSCs still suffers from significant nonradiative recombination losses and the accompanying poor stability. Electronic trap states caused by crystallographic defects including intrinsic point defects or higher-dimensional defects (such as lead clusters and grain boundaries (GBs)) are critical sources for non-radiative recombination and perovskite decomposition.4,5
Considering that a perovskite material is an ionic crystal, the coordination number on its surface is always lower than in the bulk. Such surfaces are known to be unstable.6,7 Coordination engineering to form lead or iodide complexes through coordination bonding is an effective strategy to passivate point defects and GBs, resulting in high-performance PSCs.8,9 Among various coordination molecules, SCN− (thiocyanate) is recognized to have a strong coordination ability with Pb–I octahedra to reduce the nonradiative charge recombination.9,10 Recently, Meng et al.10 introduced a urea–ammonium thiocyanate molten salt derived from heating NH4SCN and urea to stimulate the coordination activity of SCN−, leading to the improved quality of CsPbI3 perovskite films.
In this respect, we develop a more simple but effective post-treatment strategy via a SCN− anion-based ionic-liquid for high-quality hybrid perovskite films (FA0.92MA0.08PbI3). 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (EMIMSCN) (Scheme S1, ESI†) with quite high conductivity, compared to other ionic liquids and organic electrolytes, has been widely employed in ionic-liquid electrolytes.11–13 Ionic liquids are liquids comprised totally of ions.11 The high conductivity of EMIMSCN means that there is only the electrostatic attraction between cations and anions, which guarantees a sufficient supply of SCN− anions and strong coordination ability with Pb–I octahedra. Beyond SCN− anions, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cations from EMIMSCN with strong electron-donating ability also can effectively neutralize the undercoordinated Pb2+, eliminating the corresponding electronic traps. Additionally, ionic liquids are nonvolatile and can efficiently fill GB and form a capping layer on the perovskite surface, reducing the notorious non-radiative charge recombination. We find that EMIMSCN treatment multifunctionally passivates VI (I vacancy) and Pb–I antisite defects and aligns the interfacial energy level between the perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL). As a proof of concept, we show that such EMIMSCN-treated PSCs using FAxMA1−XPbI3 perovskite exhibit a PCE of 22.55%. Meanwhile, the unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent stability, maintaining over 90% of the initial PCE after 800 h of storage under ambient conditions.
The surface defects of perovskite films are considered to be the major nonradiative recombination centers and perovskite decomposition sources, especially the Pb- and I-related defects, such as VI (I vacancy), VPb (Pb vacancy) and Pb–I antisite (IPb, Pb site substitution by I and PbI, I site substitution by Pb), because the band edges of perovskites are tied closely to Pb and I orbitals.14 According to the calculated results of perovskite surface defect formation energies (DFEs) reported in the literature,14,15 the DFEs of the VI and PbI defects are much lower than those of other defects. Thus, the VI and PbI are the predominant defects on the perovskite surface.
On the basis of these results, we adopted density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the interaction energies between EMIMSCN and perovskite surface defects (VI and PbI). The calculation results reveal that the relative binding energy between SCN− from EMIMSCN and VI from the perovskite surface is −4.08 eV, while that between EMIM+ and VI is −1.05 eV (Fig. 1a and b). This indicates that the SCN− anion is more favourably interacting with VI, leading to a very strong coordination bonding with undercoordinated Pb2+. A similar result is also found in the case of PbI (Fig. 1c and d). The calculations show that EMIMSCN has multifunctional passivation effects on the surface defect states of perovskite films, because of the coordination-active anions and cations form EMIMSCN, especially SCN− anions.

We then experimentally study the interactions between the perovskite and EMIMSCN. The FTIR spectra in Fig. S1 (ESI†) show that the transmission bands between 3200 to 2900 cm−1 are assigned to C–H stretching of the imidazolium ring of EMIMSCN, confirming the successful deposition of EMIMSCN on the perovskite film.16 The typical stretching vibration mode of the CN bond of the imidazole ring at 1170 cm−1 shifts to a lower wavenumber of 1162 cm−1 after EMIMSCN treatment (Fig. 1e), indicating a strong interaction between the EMIM− cations and perovskite, which originates from the electron delocalization in the π-conjugated imidazole ring, forming a Lewis base-acid adduct with perovskites. Moreover, the SCN− stretching vibration (νSCN) appearing at 2057 cm−1 in pristine EMIMSCN also shifts to a lower-wavenumber of 2053 cm−1 after EMIMSCN treatment, proving the interaction between SCN− and the Pb–I octahedron. The interaction of the perovskite film and EMIMSCN was further investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. As shown in Fig. 1f, there are two main peaks for Pb 4f, that is, the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 at 138.4 eV and 143.3 eV for the pristine perovskite film. The peaks shift to lower binding energy of 138.1 eV and 143.0 eV after EMIMSCN treatment, indicating the chemical interaction between EMIMSCN and the undercoordinated Pb2+ on the perovskite surface. Further insight into this interaction was gained by solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (ssNMR).17–20 Compared to EMIMSCN, clear changes are seen for all 13C signals of EMIMSCN/PbI2 (Fig. S2, ESI†), notably a downfield shift, which shows that EMIMSCN forms a complex with PbI2. The ssNMR result combining with the FTIR and XPS measurements is in agreement with the DFT calculation.
We used top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to observe the perovskite surface with and without EMIMSCN treatment. We find that there is almost no change in the grain size, but the packing of the perovskite film becomes denser (Fig. S3, ESI†), which is attributed to a homogenous coverage of EMIMSCN at the perovskite surface, leading to narrow GB width. In addition, AFM images reveal that EMIMSCN treatment reduces the mean roughness from 31 nm to 24 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†), suggesting that EMIMSCN treatment is beneficial in improving the film morphology, consistent with the SEM observations.
To directly elucidate the passivation effect of EMIMSCN towards perovskite defects, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) characterizations. Compared to the control film, the PL intensity of the EMIMSCN-treated film considerably increases (Fig. 2a), suggesting a remarkable decrease in non-radiative recombination with a decreased surface defect density. Moreover, the obvious blue-shift of 4 nm in the spectra further demonstrates that the number of defect sites has been mitigated, thus leading to the decrease of spontaneous radiative recombination from the trap states after EMIMSCN treatment. TRPL spectra reflect the similar results as the steady PL (Fig. 2b). The fitted parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The PL lifetime of the EMIMSCN treated film (1.60 μs) is significantly longer than that of the control film (0.80 μs), further confirming the efficient passivation of EMIMSCN.
Next, we employed the space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique to evaluate the defect density in perovskite films. Dark current voltage characteristics for the hole-only devices with the structure ITO/perovskite/Au were collected (Fig. 2c). The trap densities (Nt) are calculated according to the equation Ntrap from the trap-filled-limited voltage (VTFL) extracted from the following equation:20  where Ntrap denotes the defect density, ε and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant and the vaccum permittivity respectively, e represents electron charge and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. The obtained Ntrap values are 5.69 × 1015 cm−3 and 1.21 × 1014 cm−3 for devices without and with EMIMSCN treatment. The reduced Ntrap proves that EMIMSCN effectively reduces the defect density in perovskite films, in line with the PL and TRPL measurements. Further studies on perovskite crystal structure by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrometry and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, as shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S5 (ESI†), demonstrate no obvious differences in the EMIMSCN treated perovskite films and the control perovskite films, indicating that EMIMSCN is deposited on the perovskite surface and GBs, rather than doped into the perovskite lattice to change the perovskite composition.

Ultraviolet photoelectron emission spectra (UPS) were employed to measure the surface band structure with and without EMIMSCN treatment (Fig. S6, ESI†). The work function (WF) is calculated to be 4.25 eV and 4.37 eV with the valence band maximum (VBM) of −5.73 eV from −5.87 eV for the EMIMSCN treated perovskite film and control perovskite film, respectively. This difference could facilitate the hole extraction from the perovskite to the hole transport and block undesirable electron transfer, as depicted in Fig. 3a. The EMIMSCN-treated perovskite film exhibits a lower average surface potential than that of the control film, as is derived from Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) measurement. A lower surface potential generally reveals that the Fermi level is closer to the VBM, which is beneficial to facilitate the hole transport from the perovskite to the HTL21 (Fig. 3b and d). The Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements were also employed to investigate the charge recombination under dark conditions.16 The EMIMSCN based PSC device yields a higher built-in potential (Vbi), in contrast with the pristine PSC device, which provides a stronger driving force for carrier separation and transfer (Fig. 3c).

We finally measured the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs with a configuration of glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-p-dimethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)/Ag under simulated AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 4a and b). Fig. S7 (ESI†) presents cross-section SEM images of the devices. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table S2 (ESI†). Compared to the control PSCs with a PCE of 20.11%, the EMIMSCN-based devices show a drastically enhanced PCE of 22.55%. The improved Voc, short-circuit current Jsc and FF indicate that the charge recombination and charge transport in the EMIMSCN cells have been optimized by EMIMSCN treatment. We also found that the treated PSCs exhibit negligible hysteresis under forward and reverse scans (FS and RS) (Fig. 4b) due to the reduced defects and enhanced energy alignment. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 4c, from which the integrated photocurrent densities agree well with the Jsc values measured from the J–V scan. The EMIMSCN-treated PSCs achieve a steady power output (SPO) with almost no decrease or fluctuation from maximum power point (MPP) tracking (Fig. 4d). All these results are ascribed to the high-quality films with reduced defects and good interface energy alignment, as presented in Fig. 2 and 3. The histogram of the photovoltaic parameters indicates the good reproducibility of the performance enhancement for EMIMSCN devices (Fig. 4e). We also tested the long-term stability of the unencapsulated devices during storage under dark and moisture environments (∼50% RH, 298 K) (Fig. 4f). Compared to the control device, the EMIMSCN-treated device shows distinctly improved stability, maintaining over 90% of the initial PCE after 800 h of storage under ambient conditions. The enhanced device stability may be benefited from the effective multifunctional passivation of the predominant VI and PbI defects on the surface, which can effectively reduce device decomposition sources, leading to ion migration and component loss, consistent with previous reports using ionic liquids.22

In summary, we report the use of highly-conductive ionic liquid EMIMSCN, which provides free functional groups of EMIM+ and SCN− ions to enhance the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of PSCs. Both EMIM+ and SCN− ions can interact with the VI and PbI defects of perovskite surfaces and the interface between the perovskite and HTL realizes an optimized energy level, leading to a reduction in the notorious non-radiative charge recombination and enhanced charge transport. Consequently, PSCs with EMIMSCN treatment achieve an increased Voc from 1.10 V to 1.15 V and thereby an obvious enhancement of the PCE from 20.11% to 22.55% with alleviated hysteresis. Moreover, the effective multifunctional passivation of the predominant defects on the surface leads to a superior device stability, maintaining over 90% of the initial PCE after 800 h of storage under ambient conditions. In view of the easy accessibility of this post treatment, our finding offers a more simple but efficient pathway for defect management, which provides new insights to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.
