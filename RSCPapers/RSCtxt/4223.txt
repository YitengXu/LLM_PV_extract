    , Accepted 29th October 2018First published on 30th October 2018AbstractAll-inorganic perovskite materials (e.g. CsPbI2Br) have been demonstrated to be a promising candidate as the light absorber for solar cells because of their remarkable thermal stability. Herein, we develop a simple low-temperature solution process to carefully control the perovskite crystallization kinetics with enhanced mass transport during film deposition. It resulted in high-quality inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite films to achieve a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 14.31% in the resultant planar heterojunction solar cell. Importantly, the as-prepared devices showed excellent thermal stability and light stability, wherein the devices maintained 83.58% of their original efficiency after 85 °C heat treatment for 500 h, and 90.33% of their initial efficiency with continuous light soaking for 500 h, respectively. Therefore, a universally feasible strategy is suggested to fabricate high-quality inorganic perovskite thin films for higher performance optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years because of the rapid increase in their power conversion efficiency (PCE). In the span of a few years, the PCE of PSCs has risen unprecedentedly from 3.8% to 23.3%, which demonstrates a comparable performance to traditional commercial silicon solar cells.1–9 Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, such as MAPbX3, FAPbX3 and their blends (where MA = CH3NH3, FA = HC(NH2)2, and X = Cl, Br, I), show exceptional optoelectronic properties such as large absorption coefficients, small exciton binding energies, balanced carrier diffusion lengths, high charge carrier mobilities and low densities of deep trap states.10–14 However, they are not stable in the ambient environment, especially high temperature, due to the organic components.15–17 To overcome the thermal instability issue of organic species, all-inorganic halide perovskites have been developed alternatively, among which CsPbX3 is the most promising candidate.18–22 Unfortunately, although CsPbBr3 displays good stability, its wide band gap (∼2.3 eV) is not suitable for PV applications. Although CsPbI3 shows an appropriate band gap (∼1.73 eV), its notorious phase instability upon light and moisture exposure casts serious concerns for practical use. Subsequently, mixed-halide inorganic perovskites have been developed, among which CsPbI2Br exhibits a reasonable band gap (∼1.91 eV) and phase stability to fulfill the requirements for real applications.23,24
The CsPbX3 perovskite can be either fabricated by a solution-process or vacuum deposition.23,25,26 In regard to the solution-process, the CsPbX3 film can be either fabricated by a one-step method or two-step method.24 Almost all these reports suggest that an annealing process over 250 °C is required to fabricate high quality inorganic perovskite polycrystalline films.18,19,21,24–33 This is because of the high phase transition temperature due to the high formation energy of CsPbX3 crystals. Such a high annealing temperature is not favored for mass production and further limits their potential for application in flexible electronics and tandem devices. In pursuit of a low-temperature process, some researchers introduced hydroiodic acid (HI) into the perovskite precursor solution and realized low-temperature phase transition of inorganic perovskite crystals.20,34 However, the as-obtained films were mostly about 150 nm thick, which was too thin to absorb sunlight sufficiently. This is because the commonly used solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) does not dissolve the inorganic perovskite precursor well. The precursor concentration would be increased by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which exhibits stronger polarity and coordination ability. When DMSO was introduced in the precursor solutions to grow thicker films, they often suffered from unsatisfactory film quality for a high performance device.35,36 It is necessary to understand the film growth kinetics for an inorganic perovskite for obtaining high-quality films with enough absorbance via a low-temperature process, which is still a challenge.
In this work, we developed a simple low temperature solution process to deposit inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite films with high quality. We carefully modulated the crystallization kinetics of the inorganic perovskite to enhance the mass transport and diffusion, which is in the direction parallel to the substrate during film growth. Via optimized solvent engineering and spin-coating process, uniform and pin-hole free α-CsPbI2Br films were obtained to achieve a stabilized PCE of 14.31% in the planar heterojunction solar cell. Importantly, the as-prepared films showed excellent long-term stability and displayed an ∼8% PCE loss after 120 days of storage in the dark at room temperature. Furthermore, the as-prepared film-based devices also exhibited remarkable long-term thermal stability with only a 16.42% PCE decline after being heated at 85 °C for 500 h, and these devices can maintain 90.33% of their original efficiency after 500 h of continuous light soaking.
Results and discussion
Solvent engineering
The CsPbI2Br perovskite is usually prepared from a precursor solution containing 2CsI + PbI2 + PbBr2, which is difficult to crystallize at a low temperature of 100 °C. A low-temperature fabrication method using PbI2·xHI and CsI as precursors has been recently reported.34 HI in the PbI2·xHI adduct is proposed to decrease the crystallization energy barrier to form the α-CsPbX3 phase. Intuitively, we suppose that other adducts based on PbX2 should have a similar effect. A mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO has often been used for organic–inorganic halide perovskite film growth, wherein an intermediate phase, MAI–PbI2–DMSO, was formed to promote the crystallization of high-quality films.9,37,38 Therefore, we introduced DMSO into the precursor solution of 2CsI + PbI2 + PbBr2 to investigate the low-temperature processing.
We first changed the DMSO/DMF ratio in the precursor solutions to study the solvent effects. Since the saturated precursor concentration is 0.4 M in a pure DMF solution, we kept it constant in all the solutions investigated here. In order to form the intermediate of CsI–PbX2–DMSO adequately during spin coating, we employed a spin-coating time of 90 s. Fig. S1† shows the image of CsPbI2Br films fabricated from the precursor solutions with different DMF:DMSO ratios upon annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. With the increase of the DMSO ratio, the brown films became lighter and lighter. Furthermore, the as-prepared devices exhibited different photovoltaic performances, as shown in Fig. S2.† This result indicates that the solvent composition influences the crystallization and growth of the inorganic perovskite significantly.
In addition, DMSO dissolves metal bromides better than DMF due to its stronger polarity and coordination ability. Hence, we increased the concentration of precursor solutions from 0.4 M to 0.8 M to conduct the same experiments. When the volume ratios of DMF and DMSO were changed from 4:1 to 0:1, the color turned from dark brown to light brown (Fig. S3†). Subsequently, we measured the thickness of the films, which are summarized in Table S1.† It is clear that the thickness of the CsPbI2Br film reduces with the increase of DMSO concentration. In particular, the thickness of the film is only ∼220 nm when DMSO alone was employed as the solvent. This is partially attributed to the greater surface tension of DMSO, making the precursor droplets less sticky to the substrate surface.39 From UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1a), it is observed that the UV-vis absorbance within the full wavelength range decreases with the increasing DMSO concentration, consistent with the decreasing film thickness.

(d)–(i) Top-view SEM images and grain size distribution histograms of the 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 0:1 samples, respectively. The scale bar is 500 nm. 
We then checked the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsPbI2Br films grown from precursor solutions with different concentrations of DMSO. The resultant films exhibited almost the same XRD patterns (Fig. 1b), indicating that the introduction of DMSO did not disturb the formation of the phase and crystal structure. The XRD peaks located at 14.6°, 20.8° and 29.5° are assigned to the (100), (110) and (200) planes of the CsPbI2Br perovskite, respectively, which are consistent with those of the pure cubic α phase.40 But the diffraction intensity for these films is different. The full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of (100) and (200) peaks (cf. the fitted peak widths in Fig. S4†) is measured, and the sample produced from DMF:DMSO = 2:1 has the smallest FWHM value, which suggests the highest crystal quality. The XRD results clearly show that the low-temperature annealing process we developed is effective for the fabrication of α-CsPbI2Br perovskite thin films.
We investigated the morphology of the as-spin-coated films from the different precursor solutions after annealing, and the top-view SEM images are shown in Fig. 1d–i. It is obvious that the grains gradually grew from ∼90 to ∼200 nm with the increasing DMSO content. It is expected that the DMF is more prone to removal during film formation than DMSO for two reasons: (1) weaker binding with Pb and (2) lower boiling point for fast evaporation. When DMSO is absent, the polycrystalline film exhibits a small grain size due to the fast nucleation rate, because DMF forms fewer intermediates and rapidly evaporates. This naturally leads to the formation of films with a higher density of grain boundaries. When introducing a certain amount of DMSO, the stronger coordinative DMSO slows down the perovskite crystallization process by forming a large number of intermediates of CsI–PbX2–DMSO.33 This is evidenced from the XRD pattern, showing additional peaks at 6.7° and 10.1° for the sample without annealing (Fig. S5†). These intermediates are proven to be responsible for the large crystal grain size and smooth surface morphology of organic–inorganic perovskite films. However, when the DMSO content is excessive in the precursor solution, especially when the solvent is solely DMSO, a number of pinholes are observed in the resultant film. It is speculated that the greater surface tension makes it difficult for the precursor solution to fully cover the substrate. Additionally, a large content of residual DMSO in the precursor films may cause a significant volume shrinkage during annealing by evaporating DMSO, which cannot be compensated by perovskite crystallization. In general, DMSO influences the crystallization kinetics to enlarge the grain size of the polycrystalline film, and an appropriate amount of DMF helps to adjust the surface energy of the precursor solution and volume change of the film during crystallization.
Both grain boundaries and pinholes contain a large number of electronic disorders, which act as nonradiative recombination centers that affect optoelectronic properties of the film.7,41 We investigated the photocarrier lifetime of the thin film samples with different DMSO contents by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements (Fig. 1c and Table S2†). They provide a τave of 4.98, 5.74, 7.40, 6.58, 3.82, and 3.53 ns for the 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 0:1 samples, respectively. The carrier lifetime first increased as DMF:DMSO changed from 4:1 to 2:1 and decreased when further increasing the DMSO content. Since there is no electron transport layer (ETL) or hole transport layer (HTL) on the absorber, the PL decay is not attributed to carrier extraction, but to carrier recombination. The prolonged PL decay lifetime suggests the overall reduction of nonradiative recombination pathways within the material. We observed the longest PL lifetime in the perovskite film fabricated with the precursor solution of DMF:DMSO = 2:1, indicative of the least density of trap states. The improved perovskite film quality was further checked by measuring the Urbach energy (Eu) of the films.39,42 It provides the sharp onset of absorption at the direct band gap and provides information on electronic disorders at the shallow energy level. The Urbach energies for perovskite films are calculated from the formula α = α0exp(E/Eu), where α0 is a constant and Eu denotes the Urbach energy. As shown in Table S3,† we observed the smallest value of 80.89 meV for the 2:1 sample. This is in good agreement with the TRPL measurements, which indicates that it is a high quality perovskite film fabricated by the introduction of an appropriate amount of DMSO.
To examine the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite absorber for PV applications, the above-mentioned CsPbI2Br perovskites prepared with different concentrations of DMSO were further employed to fabricate solar cells with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/PTAA/Au. Fig. S6† summarizes the major photovoltaic parameters extracted from the current–voltage measurements. When the DMF:DMSO was changed from 4:1 to 2:1, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices increased because of the increased grain sizes and the corresponding carrier lifetime. A reduced device performance was observed when further increasing the concentration of DMSO, which was attributed to the decreased film thickness and the appearance of pinholes. The best volume ratio of DMF/DMSO is 2:1 in this case, achieving an average PCE of 10.34%.
Enhanced mass transport process
The Lewis acid PbI2 is known to form an adduct by reaction with Lewis bases which contain lone pair electrons. In our precursor solution, either the oxygen atom in DMSO or iodine atom in CsI contains lone pair electrons that are ready to couple with PbI2. We have proved that the transparent precursor film right after spin-coating contains a large amount of intermediates CsI–PbX2–DMSO by XRD characterization, which is in line with a previous report.33 However, a limited understanding is achieved regarding the process from the precursor solution to intermediates, which is the key step to modulate crystallization kinetics for high-quality perovskite film fabrication.
We summarize the evolution of the CsPbI2Br film with the introduction of DMSO in Fig. 2. The entire film growth process can be divided into several stages. In the first stage, DMSO molecules intercalate between adjacent planes of PbX2 (e.g. x–y planes), resulting in an interlayer distance extension along the c-axis. This further facilitates the insertion of CsI to form the intermediate of CsI–PbX2–DMSO. It is noted that DMSO could not be completely removed from the precursor film after short-time spin-coating due to its high boiling point. Immediately annealing at high temperature leads to pinholes or a poor morphology of the resultant film due to rapid evaporation of DMSO and film crystallization. However, if we slow down the evaporation rate of the solvent, the residual DMSO could facilitate the mass transport and diffusion to improve the film quality. Based on this idea, some effective methods have been reported in the literature, such as blowing with a N2 stream, low temperature heat treatment or stand by the precursor films for several tens of minutes.31,36,40
 Fig. 2  Schematic of the evolution of the CsPbI2Br film with the introduction of DMSO. 
In the above-mentioned methods, solvent evaporation only affects mass transport in the direction perpendicular to the substrate, because solvent molecules are driven by the concentration difference toward the surface from the interior. The direction of mass transport parallel to the substrate has an even more important impact on the film uniformity, which has been less explored yet. To extract the driving force in this direction, we utilize the spin-coating by extending the spin-coating time during the process. Spin-coating is a dynamic process to remove the solvent by evaporation in the vertical direction and to facilitate the mass transport in the horizontal direction simultaneously. The introduction of DMSO enlarges the time window for spin coating, wherein the enhanced mass transport is expected to result in a uniform and high-quality film. Therefore, we investigated the spin-coating time and its impact on perovskite film quality.
The top-view SEM images and optical images of the as-spin-coated films after annealing for different spin-coating times are shown in Fig. 3d–i and S7.† When the spin-coating time was short, a large amount of DMSO remained and the mass transport occurred insufficiently, which leads to the poor morphology of the films after annealing. As the spin-coating time increased, the film became continuous and the pinholes in the precursor films were filled out. However, the grain sizes had no obvious change with the increasing spin-coating time. This indicates that the nucleation process mainly occurs in the first 30 seconds in our case, followed mainly by the mass transport process. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping was carried out on the film with the spin-coating time of 120 s (Fig. S8†). The EDX mapping results clearly illustrate that all of the elements were distributed homogeneously throughout the film. The improvement of the morphology also indicated the enhanced diffusion and mass transport during long-time spin-coating.

(d)–(i) Top-view SEM images and grain size distribution histograms of the 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 150 s samples, respectively. The scale bar is 500 nm. 
We also checked the XRD patterns of annealed perovskite films with different spin-coating times and found that the diffraction intensities for these films are different (Fig. 3b). The 120 s sample showed the highest XRD intensity at 14.6°, 20.8° and 29.5°, indicative of the best crystallinity. Moreover, the FWHM value of (100) and (200) peaks (Fig. S9†) decreased with the spin-coating time extended from 30 s to 120 s. This suggests the enhanced crystallinity in the film with elongation of the spin-coating time, consistent with the change in UV-vis absorbance (Fig. 3a). If the spin-coating time was further increased, solvent evaporation would result in a rapid increase of precursor viscosity in the film inhibiting the horizontal mass flow. Even worse, the intermediate phase could be destructed due to excessive evaporation of DMSO. Hence, reduced crystallinity was observed when further increasing the spin-coating time to 150 s. It is noted that different spin-coating times caused little change in the film thickness (Table S4†).
The carrier lifetimes of the samples with different spin-coating times were determined by TRPL measurements (Fig. 3c and Table S5†), wherein τave = 2.61, 3.15, 4.86, 7.40, 9.41 and 8.76 ns for the 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 150 s samples, respectively. The PL decay becomes slower as the spin-coating time increases to 120 s. Further increasing the spin-coating time resulted in a shorter carrier lifetime. We also measured the Urbach energy of different samples, and the smallest value of 61.55 meV was observed for the 120 s samples (Table S6†), which is in good agreement with the longer carrier lifetime as observed in TRPL measurements. Accordingly, the PCE of the devices followed the same pattern, which increased with the increasing spin-coating time from 30 to 120 s and then decreased (Fig. S10†). The best spin-coating time is 120 s in this case, achieving an average PCE of 10.82%.
Device performance
Based on the optimal conditions, wherein DMF:DMSO = 2:1 and 120 s spin-coating time, the device optimization was conducted. In order to get efficient solar cells, an absorber with sufficient optical density is essential for solar light harvesting. Hereinafter, perovskite films were prepared from the 1.05 M precursor solution. The absorption onset of the as-prepared film is around 650 nm, revealing the calculated optical bandgap (Eg) of ∼1.91 eV (Fig. S11†). The device employed the architecture of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/PTAA/Au, consisting a SnO2 layer (40 nm) as the electron transport layer (ETL) on an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate, a 400 nm thick perovskite layer, a PTAA layer (200 nm) as the HTL, and an evaporated Au layer (100 nm thick) as the back electrode, as shown in the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S12†).
As shown in Fig. 4a, the best device produced a PCE of 14.30%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.162 V, short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 15.565 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 79.06%. The forward and reverse scan current density–voltage (J–V) curves showed negligible hysteresis in the resultant device. By holding the bias near the maximum power output point (0.98 V), we obtained a stabilized photocurrent of 14.60 mA cm−2, corresponding to a stabilized efficiency of 14.31% (Fig. 4b). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time low-temperature-processed inorganic perovskite solar cells with such a high PCE were realized (see ESI Fig. S13†). Fig. 4c shows the histograms of PCEs for 40 devices with a 0.1 cm2 active area and a 1.0 cm2 active area, respectively. The PCEs over the 0.1 cm2 active area were distributed in the narrow range between 11.75% and 14.30% (average PCE over 12.75%), with a corresponding mean of 9.30% (best 10.21%) obtained over the 1 cm2 active area, which shows the good reproducibility of the approach. Such high reproducibility can be partly attributed to the high-quality perovskite films crystallized with the optimal process. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the device shows the entire absorption wavelength range of 300–675 nm (Fig. 4d). The integrated photocurrent density is 15.21 mA cm−2, in good agreement with the JSC derived from the J–V measurements. The high JSC is attributed to a very broad EQE plateau of >85% in the illumination wavelength range of 350 to 650 nm. The EQE shows a gradual decrease from 450 nm to a higher wavelength, indicating a photocurrent loss possibly due to either insufficiency in the absorption of the perovskite layer or light-field interference at the stacks within the cell.4

Stability
We further examined the thermal stability of the CsPbI2Br film by heating it on a hot plate at 100 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box. As shown in Fig. S14,† the XRD patterns revealed that the characteristic peaks of the all-inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite phase remained identical after heating for 1 month. We didn't observe additional peaks indicating extra material compositions due to degradation. When examined by UV-vis absorption, we observed that the absorption onset and intensity of the CsPbI2Br film also remained constant after 1 month aging at 100 °C (Fig. S15†). These results indicate that the as-prepared CsPbI2Br film exhibited remarkable long-term thermal stability, in terms of the composition and phase. According to our experiment and other reports, the all-inorganic CsPbI2Br is sensitive to moisture and it would turn into a yellow phase when exposed to high humidity (>30% RH). This is due to the easy phase transition induced by moisture, which can be largely mitigated via surface engineering and encapsulation.30
Moreover, we examined the long-term stability of the devices stored in the dark under nitrogen conditions. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PSCs stored at room temperature just displayed an ∼8% PCE loss after 120 days, which suggests that the inorganic CsPbI2Br PSCs are almost ready for practical applications. We also examined the thermal stability (Fig. 5b), and the devices maintained over 80% of their initial PCE while continually being heated at 85 °C for 500 h. Such long-term stability of PSCs at 85 °C is closely related to the inorganic perovskite with excellent thermal stability.
 Fig. 5  Long-term device stability of PSCs stored in a nitrogen glove box (a) at room temperature under dark conditions, (b) at 85 °C under dark conditions, and (c) at room temperature under continuous light soaking (∼20 devices for each condition).

We also conducted the stability test under continuous light soaking in a nitrogen-filled glove box. As shown in Fig. 5c, we found that our device showed excellent photostability under continuous light soaking (100 mW cm−2 white light, room temperature). After 500 hours of continuous light soaking, the device retained over 90% of its original efficiency. However, we found that the device exhibited significant hysteresis in the J–V scan measurements (Fig. S16†) after long light exposure. It is reported that hysteresis in the mixed perovskite solar cell is possibly attributed to the phase separation, which forms iodine-rich and bromine-rich phases under illumination.23,29,43 Therefore, we attempted to identify the photoinduced phase segregation by in situ photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy in CsPbI2Br films under continuous illumination, as shown in Fig. 5d and e. In the reference (high temperature-processing, the corresponding PCE shown in Fig. S17†), the PL peak position shifted significantly from 659 nm to 682 nm after only 57 min illumination, which indicates the formation of an iodide-rich phase on the film surface. In contrast, the PL peak of our film with low temperature-processing shifted gradually to 682 nm after 220 min illumination. We believe that the improved light stability of the perovskite film stemmed from its high crystal quality. It is documented that crystal defects (trap states) play an important role in halide migration, wherein the photoexcited electrons will fill traps to create internal electric fields for ion migration.44 Owing to the higher quality CsPbI2Br film, phase migration is greatly suppressed for the low temperature-processed film compared to the reference, which suggests a feasible approach to improve the light stability of the mixed inorganic perovskite absorber.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a low-temperature solution process to fabricate a mixed inorganic perovskite absorber. Via careful solvent engineering, we modulate the film growth kinetics to enhance mass transport during film growth, especially in the horizontal direction. This leads to high-quality α-phase CsPbI2Br films, which have demonstrated remarkable long-term thermal stability and light stability as compared to their counterpart processed at high temperature. By employing this strategy, we have achieved a stabilized PCE of 14.31% in the resultant device. It is believed that this low-temperature fabrication method could promote functional and potential applications of inorganic perovskites in devices. Moreover, this work suggests a general strategy to fabricate high quality solution-processed semiconductors by enhancing the mass transport process for higher performance in various applications.
