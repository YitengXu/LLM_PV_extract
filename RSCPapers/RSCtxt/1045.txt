    , Accepted 12th July 2018First published on 13th July 2018AbstractA bodipy–C70 dyad was synthesized and applied in triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion of perylene as a novel metal-free organic photosensitizer. The photophysical processes were investigated by the methods of steady-state UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations. The bodipy–C70 dyad showed an increased molar extinction coefficient up to 82300 mol−1 cm−1 at 518 nm compared with the C70 monomer. With photo-excitation of the bodipy moiety at 532 nm, the intramolecular singlet–singlet energy transfer between bodipy and C70 units was efficient with a quantum yield of nearly 100%, and the lowest triplet state of the dyad was subsequently populated via ISC of the C70 moiety, with a lifetime of ca. 80 μs in toluene. Electrochemical investigation suggested that the intramolecular electron transfer of the excited dyad was thermodynamically prohibited in toluene due to the positive ΔGCS for charge-separation. With the presence of perylene in solution as the triplet energy acceptor and emitter, the TTA upconverted fluorescence was observed with a maximum quantum yield of 10.3%. The overall upconversion capability of 4417 M−1 cm−1 exceeded that of C70 approximately two-fold. Moreover, the bodipy–C70 dyad also exhibited an enhanced optical stability under intense irradiation. All data indicated that the dyad was another ideal photosensitizer for TTA upconversion of perylene in the fullerene derivative family.
Introduction
Fluorescence upconversion is extensively applied in the fields of photovoltaics,1–3 photoelectrochemistry,4,5 photocatalysis,6,7 and luminescence bioimaging.8–10 Some upconversion approaches using two-photon absorption dyes, inorganic crystals and rare-earth materials as photosensitizers have been applied for fluorescence upconversion.11,12 However, the drawbacks of high excitation power, weak absorption of visible light, and low upconversion quantum yield have restricted their applications. Among the upconversion methods, triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) has attracted increased attention due to its low power density requirement (down to a few mW cm−2) and the relatively high efficiency, since the solar power density at Earth's surface is only ca. 100 mW cm−2 at AM 1.5.13,14 In a typical bimolecular TTA upconversion system, a triplet acceptor can be produced by triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) from a triplet photosensitizer to the ground state acceptor, and then the TTA of two triplet acceptors yields an excited singlet, emitting the delayed fluorescence.15,16
Over the past few decades, a large number of triplet photosensitizers for TTA upconversion have been developed, with those based on transition metals such as Pt(II),17 Pd(II),5,18 Os(II),19 Ru(II),20 and Ir(II)21,22 enjoying particular popularity due to their high efficiency of intersystem crossing (ISC) and long-lived triplet states. However, these transition metal complexes are expensive and usually show overly weak absorption in the visible wavelength range. This has motivated the development of metal-free photosensitizers such as bromo- and iodo-bodipy,23–25 which also exhibit relatively high ISC efficiencies (83%) due to the heavy-atom effect. Recently, some new synthetic triplet photosensitizers without any heavy atoms have been of great importance and worth looking forward to.26
Compared to bromo- or iodo-bodipy,25,27 and the other heavy-atom-free photosensitizers,26 fullerene as a common spin converter has an ISC efficiency of unity, and the ISC efficiency is basically not reduced after derivatization. Thus, fullerene has an excellent potential ability to play the role of a triplet photosensitizer. Several C60–organic chromophore dyads and triads were synthesized and applied in photodynamic therapy (PDT) or photocatalysis organic reactions.28–31 Recently, a few new dyads based on bodipy and C60 units have been applied as triplet photosensitizers in the investigation of TTA upconversion,32,33 with bodipy acting as the light-harvesting antenna and the C60 unit playing the role of a spin converter.34 Using these photosensitizers, the TTA upconversion quantum yields of perylene were reported as 2.9% for carbazole–bodipy–carbazole–C60, 2.9% for bodipy–thiophene–C60 and 7.0% for bodipy–bodipy–benzene–C60, respectively. Very recently, three new bodipy–C60 derivatives have been synthesized as triplet photosensitizers.35 By adjusting the π-conjugated system of the light-absorbing antenna, the photosensitizers had different visible absorption wavelengths. In the presence of perylene, the highest upconversion quantum yield was determined to be 7.9%.
Unlike the C60 derivatives,32,33,35,36 other important members of the fullerene family, C70 and its derivatives, have hardly been used in TTA upconversion. In fact, C70 features an ISC efficiency of almost unity, with the lifetime of its triplet state reported as 40–200 μs depending on the experimental conditions.37–39 The C70 monomer was first used as a photosensitizer in the TTA upconversion of perylene and 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene.40 As a result, green-to-blue and red-to-green fluorescence upconversions with quantum yields of 8% and 0.8% were observed, respectively, although the visible absorption of C70 was very weak.41 To the best of our knowledge, no other investigations on the application of C70 derivatives in TTA upconversion have been reported.
Herein, a bodipy–C70 dyad has been synthesized and applied in the TTA upconversion of perylene as a novel metal-free organic photosensitizer, in which the bodipy moiety (light-harvesting antenna) and the C70 unit (spin converter) are connected by a phenyl ring. The molecular structures of bodipy–C70, C70, bodipy-B, and perylene are shown in Scheme 1. The intermolecular unsaturated bonding stacking interaction can be checked by comparing the new sensitizer, bodipy-B and C70 itself. The steady-state absorption and fluorescence emission, transient absorption, and TTA-UC fluorescence emission were measured to reveal step-by-step the dynamic processes of the above systems, including the intramolecular energy transfer, electron transfer and ISC of the dyads. Besides obtaining the quantum yield of TTA-UC, an overall description of the kinetic mechanism is proposed for the TTA-UC system using the bodipy–C70 dyad as the triplet photosensitizer.

Results and discussion
Design and synthesis of the bodipy–C70 dyad
As another important member of the fullerene family, C70 has a very similar ISC efficiency of almost unity to C60. Thus, the bodipy–C70 dyad is expected to exhibit good performance in TTA upconversion as a new triplet photosensitizer, where bodipy acts as the light-harvesting antenna and the C70 unit plays the role of a spin converter. Similar to the well-known kinetic mechanism of the bodipy–C60 dyad,35 the singlet–singlet energy transfer between the photoexcited bodipy moiety and the C70 unit (as an energy acceptor) probably occurs after light irradiation, followed by ISC of the C70 unit to produce the triplet dyad, bodipy–3C70*. In the presence of perylene, the triplet perylene can be formed through TTET in the collision of bodipy–3C70* and perylene. Finally, TTA processes between two triplet perylene molecules produce a singlet and emit the upconverted fluorescence.
All of the compounds were synthesized as shown in the routes in Scheme 2. The 1H NMR and high-resolution mass spectra were used to verify the structure of the synthesized bodipy–C70, and are summarized in the ESI (Fig. S1 and S2†).

UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra

Fig. 1(a) shows the steady-state UV-Vis absorption spectra of bodipy–C70, C70, and bodipy-B. The C70 monomer exhibited a relatively weak absorption in the visible range, with its maximal molar extinction coefficient ε equaling 20700 mol−1 cm−1 at 471 nm. In contrast, bodipy-B featured a strong absorption at 517 nm (ε = 73100 mol−1 cm−1), and the bodipy–C70 dyad strongly absorbed at 518 nm (ε = 82300 mol−1 cm−1). Notably, the spectrum of the dyad was slightly different from the sum of the C70 and bodipy absorption spectra, indicating that the electronic interactions of bodipy and C70 units in the ground state were weak but non-negligible.28 The sharp peaks at about 460, 380 and 340 nm in the spectra of the C70 monomer became blurry and wider for the bodipy–C70 dyad. Our theoretical calculations suggested that the derivatization destroyed the conjugated structure of C70 a bit, and caused some changes in electronic transitions of the C70 moiety. As listed in Table S2 and Fig. S13,† the intense transitions of the C70 monomer in the visible range degenerated in the derivatized C70 unit of the dyad. As a result, the absorption bands of the C70 monomer were visibly broadened and blurred as shown in the experimental spectra.

The fluorescence emission spectra are shown in Fig. 1(b), demonstrating that the antenna, bodipy, featured a strong fluorescence at 536 nm, with those of the bodipy–C70 dyad and the C70 monomer being very weak. This evidence suggested the occurrence of an efficient energy transfer from the bodipy moiety to the C70 unit, similar to the case of bodipy–C60.33,35 Using the quenched fluorescence intensity, the singlet–singlet energy transfer efficiency from 1bodipy*–C70 to bodipy–1C70* was determined to be ∼99%. In the magnified spectra of Fig. 1(b), a weak fluorescence emission of C70 was observed at 666 nm, and that of bodipy–C70 was red-shifted to 702 nm, both of which were the singlet-state emission of the C70 unit.38 The red-shift might be caused by the reduced excitation energy of the C70 unit after derivatization. Our calculations also verified the red-shifted absorption of the C70 moiety, as shown in Table S2.†
Nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra of the dyad

Fig. 2 shows the nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra of the C70 monomer and the dyad, respectively (excitation at 532 nm). The presence of three characteristic absorptions of triplet C70 at 415, 593, and 709 nm agreed well with the previous experiments.34,37–39 A strong ground-state bleaching (GSB) band was observed at 481 nm too, and the intensity of the shoulder at ∼438 nm was markedly reduced due to the overlapping of the GSB band. Besides these, a weak peak at 543 nm was observed especially at the beginning of decay as shown in Fig. 2(a). Both dynamic decay behaviors at 438 and 543 nm were very similar to those of the peaks at 415, 593, and 709 nm, indicating that these bands were also contributory to the absorption of triplet C70, i.e. these two bands were new characteristic absorptions of triplet C70, being reported here for the first time. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the five positive absorption peaks at 396, 426, 520, 571, and 671 nm were observed for the bodipy–C70 dyad. The time-dependent DFT calculations were performed to calculate the absorption spectra of triplet C70 and the dyad. As shown in Table S3 and Fig. S14 and S15,† the derivatization of C70 broke its perfect symmetry and resulted in changes in triplet–triplet transitions of the C70 moiety. The major absorptions of the C70 monomer in the visible region were blue-shifted more or less after derivatization. Thus, the peaks of the dyad could be ascribed to the triplet–triplet absorptions of the 3C70* unit in the dyad. In other words, the triplet dyad is naturally formed through the ISC of the C70 unit, and the triplet state (T1) is exclusively localized on the C70 unit. By fitting the decay of the peak intensity at 671 nm with a double-exponential function, the natural lifetime τ0 of bodipy–3C70* was determined as ca. 80 μs.

Interestingly, both ground-state bleaching bands of bodipy and C70 units disappeared as shown in Fig. 2(b). Since all curves in Fig. 2(b) were recorded after a 3 μs delay time, it was reasonably difficult to observe the ground-state bleaching for the bodipy unit because the singlet–singlet energy transfer from bodipy to C70 moieties was very fast (usually in a timescale of picoseconds). Moreover, the disappeared ground-state bleaching band of the C70 unit might be covered by the nearby triplet–triplet absorption. As shown in Table S2 and Fig. S13,† the ground state absorption of the C70 unit became much weaker after derivatization. In addition, the triplet–triplet transition of the C70 moiety at 543 nm was blue-shifted to 520 nm for the dyad, and concealed the ground-state bleaching peak.
In the presence of perylene, the bimolecular TTET occurred between perylene and the triplet dyad. The corresponding quantum efficiency, ΦTTET, could be determined by using eqn (1), without taking into account the weak phosphorescence emission. (1)where kNR is the rate constant for the non-radiative processes including collision and internal conversion, and kTTET is the quenching rate constant of the triplet photosensitizer by perylene. kNR could be determined as kNR = 1/τ0. kTTET·[perylene] was expressed by (1/τ − 1/τ0), where τ0 and τ are the lifetimes of the triplet dyad in the absence and presence of perylene, respectively. The apparent lifetime of bodipy–3C70*, τ, was obtained by fitting the decay rate of absorption at 671 nm at different perylene concentrations (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). Fig. 3(a) shows the linear Stern–Volmer relationship between 1/τ − 1/τ0 and the perylene concentration. Based on the plots, the bimolecular quenching rate constant, kq, was determined as 3.8 × 108 M−1 s−1 (Table 1). Compared with similar dyads, bodipy–C60 (kq ∼ 5.8 × 108 M−1 s−1),35 the rate constant of bodipy–C70 was slightly smaller. It is natural that the photosensitizer with the smaller size is usually more efficient in the TTET process, because its diffusion is easier. Similar results have been observed by Zhao et al.33 where the C60 monomer showed a more efficient TTET quantum yield than its derivatives.

Interestingly, the kq of the C70 monomer as a triplet photosensitizer was much larger than that of bodipy–C70, reflecting the fact that the bodipy unit inevitably hindered the collision of perylene and the C70 unit, and reduced the TTET rate. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the TTET efficiencies, ΦTTET, of both C70 and bodipy–C70 gradually approached 100% with the increasing perylene concentration. In the following TTA experiments, the concentration of perylene was kept constant at 3.2 × 10−3 M to saturate the TTET efficiency, making TTA the rate-determining step of the overall process.
Cyclic voltammogram and Gibbs free energy changes
We know that the transformation from 1bodipy*–C70 to bodipy–3C70* normally occurs in two steps: the singlet–singlet energy transfer from 1bodipy*–C70 to bodipy–1C70* followed by the ISC of the C70 unit. However, according to the low reduction potential of C70, the electron transfer between the bodipy and C70 units might occur. Then, the produced charge-separated state (CSS) of bodipy+–C70− could transform to the triplet bodipy–3C70* via a charge recombination (CR) as shown in Scheme 3. Obviously, the CSS-mediated transformation was entirely different from the energy transfer mechanism. To evaluate the possibility of intramolecular electron transfer, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded to obtain the redox potentials of bodipy-B, C70 and the bodipy–C70 dyad.

The noted energies were those in toluene, and the excitation energy of bodipy+–C70− varied with solvents.

In Fig. 4, bodipy-B showed a reversible oxidation wave at +1.12 V and a reversible reduction wave at −1.32 V. There was no oxidation band observed for the C70 monomer, but three reversible reduction waves clearly existed at −0.60 V, −0.99 V and −1.41 V, respectively, which were consistent with the previous results.42 For the bodipy–C70 dyad, the reversible oxidation wave at +1.18 V was similar to that of bodipy-B itself. Four reversible reduction waves were located at −0.77 V, −1.15 V, −1.30 V and −1.58 V, respectively. Among them, the one-electron reductions of the bodipy–C70 dyad at −0.77 V and −1.15 V could be naturally ascribed to the reduction of the C70 moiety, which was anodically shifted by 170 mV and 160 mV from those of the C70 monomer. The one-electron reduction at −1.30 V could be attributed to the reduction of the bodipy unit by an anodical shift of 20 mV. These experimental results suggested that the bodipy and C70 units acted like the electron donor and acceptor, respectively. As summarized in Table 2, the CV experimental data show that the C70 unit in the dyad did not significantly affect the redox potential of the bodipy unit, indicating that the electronic interactions between bodipy and C70 units in the ground state were weak.43 It was consistent with the deduction of the absorption spectra.

Using the redox potentials and the optimized molecular geometries, the thermodynamic driving forces for the charge-recombination (ΔGCR), charge-separation (ΔGCS) and charge-separated state energy (ECSS) of the bodipy–C70 dyad were calculated by using the following Weller eqn (2)–(4). ΔGCR = −[EOX(BDP+/BDP) − ERED(C70/C70−)] − ΔGs(2) ΔGCS = −ΔGCR − ΔE0–0(3) ECSS = [EOX(BDP+/BDP) − ERED(C70/C70−)] + ΔGs(4)where EOX(BDP+/BDP) is the half-wave potential for one-electron oxidation of the electron donor bodipy unit, ERED(C70−/C70) is the half-wave potential for the one-electron reduction of the electron acceptor C70 unit, ΔE0–0 is the crossing point of the absorption and fluorescence spectra (e.g. 2.37 eV for bodipy–C70) and ΔGs is the static coulombic energy, which could be calculated using the dielectric continuum model as eqn (5). (5)where e is the electronic charge, and ε0, εS and εREF represent the vacuum permittivity, and the dielectric constants of the solvent and the reference, respectively. In the present experiments, the solvents were dichloromethane (εS = 9.1) and toluene (εREF = 2.24). RCC was the center-to-center distance between the electron donor and the electron acceptor, which was 13.7 Å in the bodipy–C70 dyad suggested by the DFT optimized geometry (described in section of DFT calculations). RD and RA represent the radii of the electron donor and the electron acceptor, and they were estimated to be 6.1 Å and 7.7 Å in the dyad by using the maximum extension radius of the molecular electron cloud in space.
In toluene, the ΔGS, ΔGCS and ΔGCR were calculated to be +0.50, +0.08, and −2.45 eV, respectively. The energy of the charge-separated state, ECSS, was +2.45 eV, even higher than that of 1bodipy*–C70. The positive Gibbs free energy for charge-separation indicated that the photo-induced electron transfer was thermodynamically prohibited. Therefore, the fluorescence quenching of the bodipy unit in the dyad stemmed from the energy transfer rather than the electron transfer.
DFT calculations on the absorption spectra of bodipy–C70
The photophysical properties of bodipy–C70 were calculated using the time-dependent density functional theory. The optimized ground state geometry and the molecular electrostatic potential map of bodipy–C70 are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The macrocyclic bodipy was flat and the aromatic rings around bodipy were slightly tilted. The electron cloud was mainly distributed around the boron atom of the bodipy unit, and thus the center-to-center distance between the electron donor and the electron acceptor was the distance between the boron atom and the center of C70, 13.7 Å. Moreover, the frontier molecular orbitals in the singlet and triplet excited states of bodipy–C70 were analyzed at the same level as the optimized geometry, and are shown in Fig. 5(c). The HOMO of the dyad was contributed to by the bodipy unit, while the LUMO and LUMO+1 belonged to the C70 moiety. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the bodipy unit was designated as LUMO+3 due to its higher energy. Thus, the photo-absorption of the bodipy moiety in the dyad at 532 nm was expected to be contributed to by the transition from the HOMO to LUMO+3. Additionally, the transition had a significant oscillator strength compared with the nearby transitions as shown in Fig. 5(c).

Table 3 summarizes the calculated transition energies, oscillator strengths and main electronic configurations of the low-lying singlet and triplet states of the dyad. Based on these calculated data, the UV-Vis absorption spectra could be assigned. Although the calculated transition energy of the strongest absorption band (S0 → S26, S27) was larger than the experimental data (2.394 eV, 518 nm), the configuration property of the first band was assigned to the transition of HOMO → LUMO+3 as we expected. Moreover, the energy gap between the ground state S0 and the lowest triplet state T1 was 1.48 eV and close to the energy of triplet C70. As shown in Table 1, the major electronic configuration of T1 corresponded to the transition of HOMO−1 → LUMO. Therefore, the lowest triplet state, T1, was localized on the C70 unit. Both the spin density calculation and the nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra also confirmed the conclusion.

Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion of perylene
In the presence of perylene, the upconverted fluorescence was observed due to the TTA-UC process, when bodipy–C70 or C70 itself was used as the triplet photosensitizer. Both the upconverted fluorescence intensities were gradually enhanced with the increase of the excitation power density, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The double logarithmic plot for the bodipy–C70 photosensitizer shown in Fig. 6(b) indicates that the slope at a lower power density was close to 2, and gradually decreased to unity at higher power densities.44 The threshold power density Ith for the bodipy–C70 dyad was determined as 163 mW cm−2 as the turning point shown in Fig. 6(b).

(b) Double logarithmic plot of the upconverted fluorescence intensity as a function of the excitation power density for bodipy–C70, as well as the linear dependence of the normal fluorescence of bodipy-B. c[photosensitizer] = 1 × 10−5 M, c[perylene] = 3.2 × 10−3 M, in deaerated toluene at 25 °C. 
Using the fluorescence of I2-bodipy24,32 as the standard (Φstd = 2.7% in ACN), the TTA-UC quantum yields, ΦUC, were determined by using eqn (6), (6)where A, I and n are the absorbance intensity, the integrated luminescence intensity, and the refractive index of the solvents used for the standard and the samples. In the equation, a factor of 2 was multiplied in order to make the maximum quantum yield 100%. The ΦUC values for both photosensitizers were determined as 24.8% for C70/perylene and 10.3% for bodipy–C70/perylene. Although bodipy–C70 has a slower bimolecular quenching rate than bodipy–C60 according to its bigger size (in Table 1), the ΦUC of bodipy–C70 is much higher than that of bodipy–C60. It is emphasized that the TTA upconversion is a multi-step process, and all the characteristics involving the TTET rate and the lifetime of the triplet sensitizer should be taken into account equally. Moreover, Zhao et al.45 suggested that the light-harvesting ability of the photosensitizer should also be taken into account, proposing the overall upconversion capability, η = ε·ΦUC (ε is the molar extinction coefficient), as a better evaluation parameter. Thus, the η values for C70/perylene and bodipy–C70/perylene systems were 2404 M−1 cm−1 and 4417 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Interestingly, although the ΦUC of bodipy–C70 was only about half of that of C70, the overall capability of the former exceeded that of the latter by nearly a factor of two, i.e., bodipy–C70 was a better triplet photosensitizer than the parent C70.
For the practical applications, the optical stability of photosensitizers with a long-term exposure was very important but rarely investigated. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the upconverted fluorescence intensity of C70/perylene quickly decreased with time, while that of bodipy–C70/perylene was kept constant during the first 20 min, and then slowly decreased to 79% after 60 min exposure at 532 nm with a power density of 4000 mW cm−2. Thus, bodipy–C70 was more stable as a triplet photosensitizer than C70 under long-time intense laser irradiation.

(b) Dependence of the upconverted fluorescence intensity on perylene concentration, c[photosensitizer] = 1 × 10−5 M, 532 nm, 2000 mW cm−2, in deaerated toluene at 25 °C. 
As the TTA process occurred between two triplet perylene molecules, the high concentration of perylene was beneficial in improving the TTA quantum yield. However, the self-quenching of the energy acceptor at high concentrations probably weakened the improvement. Moreover, the generation of a triplet excimer had been verified recently in a fullerene/functionalized Pt(II) metallacycle (C60/Pt) TTA upconversion system, with the triplet excited state emission observed at high concentrations.46 Thus, the concentration effect should also be considered in the present system. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the upconverted fluorescence intensities of bodipy–C70 and/or C70 were measured at different perylene concentrations, and the results clearly showed the dependence. At low concentrations, the upconverted fluorescence intensities rapidly increased to the maximum with the increasing concentration, and then slightly decreased at a high concentration. However, no phosphorescence emission was observed in the experiment, indicating that the triplet excimer production did not dominate at a high concentration.
Conclusion
As a new metal-free organic photosensitizer for TTA upconversion of perylene, the bodipy–C70 dyad was synthesized and applied. The bodipy–C70 dyad showed a strong absorption in the visible region with the maximal molar extinction coefficient of up to 82300 mol−1 cm−1 at 518 nm. The absorption and fluorescence spectra suggested that the singlet–singlet energy transfer between bodipy and C70 units was very efficient with a quantum yield of nearly 100%. Subsequently, the lowest triplet state of the dyad was populated via the ISC of the C70 moiety, with a long lifetime of ca. 80 μs in toluene. The nanosecond transient absorption spectra and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the lowest triplet state of the dyad was located in the C70 unit. In the electrochemical investigation, a positive ΔGCS for charge-separation was obtained, indicating that the intramolecular electron transfer of the dyad was thermodynamically prohibited in toluene.
Compared to bromo- or iodo-bodipy (ISC efficiency is less than 83%),25,27 the ISC efficiency of bodipy–C70 is up to ∼100%. Moreover, the lifetime of triplet bodipy–C70 is ca. 80 microseconds, which is much longer than that of bodipy–C60 (∼30 microseconds35). Thus, the bodipy–C70 dyad looks like an excellent triplet photosensitizer. In the presence of perylene as the triplet energy acceptor and emitter, the TTA upconverted fluorescence was clearly observed with a maximum quantum yield of 10.3% in toluene. The overall upconversion capability of 4417 M−1 cm−1 exceeded that of C70 approximately two-fold. Moreover, the bodipy–C70 dyad also exhibited an enhanced optical stability under intense irradiation. All data indicated that the dyad was a more ideal photosensitizer for the TTA upconversion of perylene in the fullerene derivative family.
Experimental section
Synthesis and characterization of the bodipy–C70 dyad
C70 (99%) and perylene (98%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Co. Toluene (AR, >99.5%) and chlorobenzene (AR, >99.5%) were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd and used without any purification.
Bodipy and bodipy-CHO were prepared as described in the references.35,47 Then, the bodipy–C70 dyad was synthesized via the Prato reaction of bodipy-CHO and sarcosine with C70. Under an argon atmosphere, bodipy-CHO (25.5 mg, 0.06 × 10−3 mol), sarcosine (53 mg, 0.6 × 10−3 mol) and C70 (50 mg, 0.06 × 10−3 mol) were suspended in dry chlorobenzene (50 mL). The solution was heated and refluxed for 12 h with stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, cyclohexane → cyclohexane/toluene(1:1) → toluene) to give the product bodipy–C70 as a brick red solid (7.9 mg, 11%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.49–7.43 (m, 3H), 7.42–7.26 (m, 4H), 7.04 (t, J = 20.2 Hz, 2H), 5.98 (s, 1H), 4.31 (s, 1H), 4.18 (s, 1H), 3.59 (d, J = 9.1 Hz, 1H), 2.55 (s, 3H), 2.48 (s, 3H), 2.36 (s, 3H), 1.35 (s, 3H), 1.13 (s, 3H). MALDI-MS: calcd ([C98H28BF2N3]+) m/z = 1296.24, found m/z = 1296.26.
Steady-state and transient absorption and fluorescence emission spectra
The steady-state UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded in a wavelength range of 300–700 nm using a spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The fluorescence emission was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4600, Hitachi) in a wavelength range of 400–800 nm.
Nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra were recorded using a home-built laser flash photolysis system. The second harmonic (532 nm) of a Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser (PRO-190, Spectra Physics) was utilized as the excitation source (pulse duration: 8 ns, repetition rate: 10 Hz, pulse energy < 10 mJ per pulse). A 500 W xenon lamp was used as the source of the analyzing light, and passed through a flow quartz cuvette perpendicularly to the pulsed laser. The optical absorption path length was 10 mm. A monochromator equipped with a photomultiplier (CR131, Hamamatsu) was employed to record the transient absorption spectra within a wavelength range of 320–700 nm. The typical spectral resolution was less than 1 nm. A dynamic decay curve of the intermediate was averaged by multi-shots and recorded using an oscilloscope (TDS3052B, Tektronix). All the solutions were deoxygenated by purging with high purity argon (99.99%) for about 20 minutes prior to measurements.
TTA upconversion spectra
A stable CW laser (Verdi-V5, 532 nm, Coherent) was used as the excitation light source. The diameter of the laser spot is ca. 5 mm. In the TTA UC experiment, the solution was deoxygenated by purging with high-purity helium for at least 20 minutes, and the gas flow was maintained during the measurement. With photoexcitation at 532 nm, the upconverted fluorescence of perylene was dispersed and detected using a commercial monochromator system (Triplepro, Acton Research) and a CR131 photomultiplier. The spectral resolution was ca. 1.0 nm.
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammograms were recorded with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A three-electrode electrolytic cell was used, with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4N[PF6]) as a supporting electrolyte. The working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode, and the counter electrode was a platinum electrode. A non-aqueous Ag/AgNO3 (0.1 M in acetonitrile) reference electrode was contained in a separate compartment connected to the solution via a semipermeable membrane. DCM was used as the solvent. Ferrocene was added as the internal reference. Electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature after purging with argon for 30 minutes.
Quantum chemical calculations
Molecular geometries were optimized using density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. No imaginary frequencies were found for the optimized structures. The spin density surfaces of the dyad were calculated at the same level of theory, and the energy gaps between its ground state and the excited states were calculated. The vertical excitation energies were compared with the experimental data in the absorption spectra, and the corresponding transitions of spectral bands were assigned. The PCM model was utilized to evaluate the solvent effect. All these calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 W program package.48
