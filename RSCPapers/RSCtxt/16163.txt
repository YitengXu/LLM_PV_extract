While efforts exist on understanding the effects of elemental substitution and material stability, fundamental knowledge on the electronic transport properties are sparse. We employ first principles calculations to examine the electronic band structure and optical band gap and interrogate the effect of electron transport on electrical and thermal conductivities, and Seebeck coefficient, as a function of temperature and chemical potential. Our results reveal that BaZrS3 has a band gap of 1.79 eV in proximity of the optimal 1.35 eV recommended for single junction photovoltaics. An absorption coefficient of 3 × 105 cm−1 at photon energies of 3 eV is coupled with an early onset to optical absorption at 0.5 eV, significantly below the optical band gap. The carrier effective mass being lower for electrons than holes, we find the Seebeck coefficient to be higher for holes than electrons. A notable (≈1.0 at 300 K) upper limit to the thermoelectric figure of merit, obtained due to high Seebeck coefficient (3000 μV K−1) and ultra-low electron thermal conductivity, builds promise for BaZrS3 as a thermoelectric.
Introduction
Chalcogenide perovskites have gained increased attention from the scientific community due to their promising photovoltaic and thermoelectric properties. These perovskites form in the ABX3 configuration with A and B being elements with combined valence of 6 (generally containing Group-IIA elements such as Ba, Ca and Sr and Group-IVB elements such as Hf, Zr, and Ti) and X typically being S or Se. As these constituent elements are considered less toxic and gentle on the environment relative to, for instance, Pb in organic–inorganic halide perovskites, some of these compounds have been synthesized experimentally,1–6 mostly in the needle-like phase (NH4CdCl3),1,7 the hexagonal phase (BaNiO3),2,8 or as the orthorhombic distorted perovskite (GdFeO3).4 Among the recently examined chalcogenide perovskites, BaZrS3 has demonstrated strong potential for photovoltaics since the calculated band gap of 1.76–1.82 eV9,10 is in the neighborhood of ∼1.35 eV that is also considered optimum for energy-conversion applications.11 While reports exist on BaZrS3 for alloying and defect control,12 stability and band gap tuning,13 the effect of substituting S for O in BaZrO3 and the subsequent band gap14 and phonon transport properties,15 efforts towards understanding the fundamental electron mediated transport mechanisms, and quantifying the electronic properties, are absent. Such knowledge is key to evaluate the applicability of BaZrS3 for thermoelectric and optoelectronic devices. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with Boltzmann transport equation to examine the electrical and electron thermal conductivities, in addition to the optical absorption spectrum of BaZrS3 in its orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure. Our predictions, as elaborated below, reveal that strong anisotropic effects impact the conductivities along specific lattice directions under doping, and the material possesses high absorption coefficients (>105 cm−1) with an early onset of photon absorption significantly prior to the fundamental band gap.
Results and discussion
The lattice constants of the BaZrS3 structure are well reproduced from our first principles calculations, and in excellent agreement with experimental measurements.4 The calculated lattice parameters of the distorted perovskite structure are listed in Table 1. Note that, in addition, a precise representation of the electronic band structure is required from the computations to accurately estimate the electronic properties. Our calculations predict a direct band gap of 1.79 eV at the Γ point (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This result is in excellent agreement with experimentally measured values of 1.73–1.85 eV.2,12,13,16 Additionally, our calculated band gap using the hybrid HSE06 functional concurs with other theoretical calculations that employ the same functional with estimates of 1.75,9 1.76,12 1.7,16 1.7,14 and 1.82 eV.10 Calculations using other functionals tend to underestimate the band gap of BaZrS3 with the PBE functional rendering a value of 1.02 eV, while the GGA+U functional with a U parameter of 4.5 eV yields a band gap of 1.72 eV.12 These observations attest to the validity of the hybrid HSE06 functional used to predict the electronic band gap necessary for an accurate description of the charge transport mechanisms.

The electronic band structure and the density of states (DOS) are illustrated in Fig. 1. The band structure shows that the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are composed of S-3p states and Zr-4d states, respectively, at the Γ point.
 Fig. 1  Electronic band structure and projected density of states (DOS) for BaZrS3 orthorhombic distorted perovskite. The calculated direct band gap at the Γ (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) point is 1.79 eV. 
A deeper scrutiny of the VBM and CBM suggests the bands as dispersive, as also noted from the DOS. This behavior is attributed to the more disperse and less localized Zr-4d states and the S-3p states. The conduction band reveals antibonding energy states between Zr-4d and S-3p orbitals, while the valence band suggests bonding states between Zr-4d and S-3p states. The dispersive nature of the band edges implies low carrier effective masses that contribute to efficient carrier transport. We calculate the electron (hole) effective masses along the Γ–X, Γ–Y and Γ–Z directions as 0.347 (−0.556), 0.218 (−0.253) and 0.422 (−0.747) fractions of mo (electron rest mass), respectively. Irrespective of whether electrons or holes act as the predominant carriers, enhanced transport properties are expected along the a and b lattice directions. We also expect notable carrier transport properties for BaZrS3 given the calculated carrier effective mass is less than 1.0 mo. The optical absorption spectra presented in Fig. 2 provides insights into the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) optical absorption of BaZrS3 as well as the imaginary part of the dielectric constant, ε2, that determines the absorption properties of the chalcogenide perovskite.

The inset in figure (a) displays magnified area of photon energies before the optical band gap of 1.79 eV. The vertical lines signify the position of the optical band gap of BaZrS3. 
The optical absorption of BaZrS3 initiates around photon energies of ∼0.5 eV, indicating that the perovskite has an early onset for optical absorption even before the fundamental band gap is attained. This early onset of optical absorption is dependent on the material, temperature and the range of wavelengths considered. This phenomenon is typically due to free-carrier absorption by either free electrons or free holes, inter-valence-band absorption by holes or inter-conduction-band absorption by electrons. One or more of these mechanisms dominate depending on the relative concentration of electrons or holes in the material. For intrinsic materials, both the electron and hole contributions play an important role.17
The distorted BaZrS3 structure achieves its highest UV-Vis absorption at ∼4.8 eV of photon energy. As photons with energy less than 3.4 eV contribute to the majority of solar energy reaching the earth's surface,9 BaZrS3 holds promise as a photovoltaic material, and attains a highest optical absorption of ∼3 × 105 cm−1 at ∼3 eV. The optical absorption properties are typically attributed to the d orbitals located at the band edges.9 This large absorption coefficient suggests the photovoltaic efficiency of BaZrS3 is not solely influenced by carrier mobility. Also, for the maximum solar spectral irradiance that occurs at an incident photon energy of ∼2.5 eV,9 BaZrS3 is estimated to possess optical absorption of 2 × 105 cm−1, which makes it a potential material for solar thin film applications. BaZrS3 obtains its highest ε2 = 7.9 at photon energy of ∼4.3 eV, although ε2 = 4.5 acquired at 2.7 eV is higher than that estimated for advanced solar materials, such as CdTe and GaAs, at the same photon energy.9
Solution to the Boltzmann transport equations through the BOLTZTRAP code18 is used to predict the Seebeck coefficient (S), the electrical conductivity (σ) and the electron thermal conductivity (κe) along the a, b, and c lattice directions of the distorted perovskite for different chemical potentials (μ) and temperatures (T). We employ the constant relaxation-time (τ) approximation since it is difficult to estimate τ given the occurrences of different scattering mechanisms (at the boundaries, between carriers, etc.) in the material. We calculate τ = 10−14 s, similar to previous reports.19,20 Moreover, τ = 10−14 s was recently calculated for the chalcogenide perovskite CaZrSe3.21 The upper limit of the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZTe), however, does not depend on τ.
The variation of the power factor (PF = S2σ) and ZTe over a range of carrier concentrations from 1015–1022 cm−3 across different temperatures are presented in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†), respectively. At lower temperatures (<600 K), higher PF values are noted for p-type doping, while n-type doping yields higher values at temperatures >600 K. The highest PF values are achieved at 1021 cm−3 for both p- and n-type doping at all temperatures, with PF increasing with temperature. Increased PF values are obtained for higher carrier concentrations relative to lower ones. From the Bethe–Sommerfeld expansion of the Mott relation for degenerate statistics and single band conduction, we have , where e is the carrier charge, DOS(E) is the energy-dependent electronic density of states, n(E) is the energy dependent number of states, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and φ is the energy dependent carrier mobility. S is inversely proportional to φ and hence a high effective mass (i.e., low carrier mobility) yields higher PFs.22 The average effective mass for holes is higher than that for electrons, resulting in an enhanced PF when placing higher emphasis on the contribution of S to PF. As the doping concentration increases, σ increases and S decreases; thus, there exists an optimum PF at relatively high carrier concentrations in the proximity of the conduction band (here, that carrier concentration being 1021 cm−3).23 From Fig. S2 (ESI†), we find that higher ZTe is achieved for lower (1015–1018 cm−3) rather than higher carrier concentrations. ZTe is rooted to the entropy production in a thermoelectric energy conversion process, and higher carrier concentration contributes to an increased entropy production that drastically reduces the ZTe. On the other hand, at higher temperatures, κe increases due to the relatively higher number of excited electrons, thereby decreasing ZTe. The calculated ZTe values are similar for p- and n-type doping (∼1.0) between 100–700 K. The highest ZTe ≈ 1.0 occurs at 300–700 K at carrier concentrations of 1015–1018 cm−3. ZTe decreases with increasing carrier concentration across all temperatures. From Fig. S3 (ESI†), the variation of carrier concentration from 1 × 1017 to 9 × 1017 cm−3 suggests that the highest ZTe for 100–700 K is achieved at 1017 cm−3. Combining the distributions for PF and ZTe against chemical potential and temperature, we hence predict the electronic transport properties at a carrier concentration of 1017 cm−3, as also suggested in the literature for optimal photovoltaic performance of BaZrS3.12
The electron–phonon scattering rate as a function of energy across a temperature range from 300–800 K is obtained as the reciprocal of the relaxation time (1/τnk), and presented in Fig. 3(a). The illustration depicts the shape of the DOS that demonstrates the available phase space for carrier scattering. This phase space provides the available volume and area within which three-phonon scattering processes such as absorption and annihilation occur as well as the electron–phonon coupling which results in scattering of the charge carriers. The density of states at the different energy levels shown in Fig. 3(a) provides an estimate of the available phase space at such energies where the electron–phonon coupling processes occurs. For instance, at 800 K, within an energy window of −1 to −5 eV, the available phase space is larger than the energy window of −2 to −3 eV. The resulting lower carrier relaxation times at higher temperatures is evidenced by the increase in scattering rate with temperature. In Fig. 3(b), the relaxation time for holes (electrons) is extracted from the valence band maximum (conduction band minimum) which suggests that electrons assume higher relaxation times relative to holes. Increased scattering at higher temperatures leads to decrease in the relaxation times. Fig. 3(b) yields a relaxation time in the order of 10−14 s at different temperatures for BaZrS3.

The temperature and directional dependence for S, σ, κe and PF in BaZrS3 for p-type doping are presented in Fig. 4 (the corresponding variations for n-type doping are in Fig. S4 as ESI†). S increases steeply from 50 to 300 K, gradually from 300 to 850 K and decreases at T > 850 K. This phenomenon is explained by the fact that S is a metric for the average entropy transported by a charge carrier per unit charge in the limit of thermal equilibrium; hence S decreases (or increases) with reducing (or rising) temperatures.24

(a) Seebeck coefficient S with anisotropic contributions from all three crystallographic directions, (b) electrical conductivity σ along the a, b and c crystal lattice directions, (c) electronic thermal conductivity κe along the lattice directions, and (d) power factor PF at different temperatures. There are significant anisotropic effects in the thermoelectric properties at all temperatures, especially for σ and κe. The highest PF is achieved at 350 K. 
At 300 K, S ≈ 820 μV K−1 for p-type doping, while S ≈ 620 μV K−1 for n-type doping. The calculated S is higher for BaZrS3 (p-type) relative to CaZrS3, but comparably lower for n-type doping,21 because S is inversely proportional to the carrier mobility and higher carrier mobility are calculated for p-type doping in CaZrSe3 compared to BaZrS3 while the opposite is observed for n-type doping. Minor anisotropic effects are observed in S between 200–850 K, while no such effects are noted in case of n-type doping. This directional dependence can be utilized when designing a BaZrS3 based thermoelectric device to yield optimum performance along specific crystallographic directions.

σ decreases steeply at T < 300 K while a more gradual reduction is noted thereafter (Fig. 4(b)), in contrast to the trend observed for S. The decrease in σ with increasing temperature occurs due to presence of more excited electrons and enhanced electron scattering. At 300 K, the average σ ≈ 0.20 Ω−1 cm−1 is lower than the mean value (0.68 Ω−1 cm−1) predicted for CaZrSe3,21 and significantly lower than that of competing electronic materials, such as SnSe, GeS, GeSe and SnS.20 However, σ assumes a higher magnitude of 0.62 Ω−1 cm−1 under n-type doping because of the low carrier effective mass for electrons relative to that for the holes. σ also depends on the choice of the carrier relaxation time τ since a lower τ will result in a higher σ. The highest σ is recorded along the a and b lattice directions for both p-type and n-type doping and for T > 150 K. This finding is attributed to the lower carrier effective mass (high carrier mobility) along the a and b lattice directions (−0.556 mo and −0.253 mo, respectively) for p-type doping, and likewise (0.347 mo and 0.218 mo, respectively) for n-type doping. However, we note that there is a slight deviation in σ at T < 150 K for p-type doping, possibly due to computational uncertainties. A similar observation is made for the phonon transport properties of BaZrS3 along the different lattice directions. Though the magnitude of the anisotropy in the lattice thermal conductivity is minute, enhanced phonon transport properties are observed along the b- and a-lattice directions while lower lattice thermal conductivity is predicted along the c-direction.15 Additionally, the BaZrS3 lattice parameters along the a- and b-directions are higher than the c-direction, which leads to longer phonon mean free path along these directions before annihilation. As similar observations are made for the electron (hole) and phonon transport properties along the different lattice directions, we expect strong electron–phonon coupling along the a- and b-lattice directions and subsequently higher carrier scattering along these directions. When designing efficient photovoltaic and thermoelectric BaZrS3 based devices, the different transport properties along the various lattice directions could be modified to achieve the desired efficiencies. For instance, BaZrS3 samples prepared with the a-facets could be utilized in improving the optical absorption properties and the thermoelectric efficiencies as this lattice direction exhibits marginally lower lattice thermal conductivity, relatively lower electronic thermal conductivity, higher Seebeck coefficient but only slightly lower in electrical conductivity as compared to the b-facets of the crystals.

κ
e reveals directional dependence at T > 150 K and exhibits low magnitudes relative to CaZrSe3 and other similar compounds.20 The directional dependence is akin to that observed for σ. An ultra-low mean κe ≈ 0.004 W m−1 K−1 is predicted at 300 K and is attributed to the low carrier mobility compared to those through SnSe, GeS, GeSe and SnS lattices. From Fig. 4(c) we note that κe increases rather linearly with temperature as more carriers are excited at higher T. A similar trend is observed under n-type doping (Fig. S4(c), ESI†), while the highest κe are obtained along the a and b lattice directions for both p-type and n-type doping, analogous to σ.
The variation of PF with T presented in Fig. 4(d), shows that PF increases from 50 to 350 K and decreases at T > 350 K. Nevertheless, PF increases from 50 to 1000 K for n-type doped BaZrS3, while the highest PF = 0.135 μW cm−1 K−2 is achieved at 350 K for p-type doping with room temperature PF ≈ 0.133 μW cm−1 K−2. These predictions are lower than that of other chalcogenide perovskites21 due to the relatively low σ of BaZrS3.
The variations of S, σ, κe and PF with chemical potential μ at different temperatures are reproduced in Fig. 5. μ essentially mimics the intensity with which BaZrS3 is doped, and also determines the center of the Fermi–Dirac distribution function that governs the probability of occupation of a quantum state with energy E. We predict a high S ≈ 3000 μV K−1 at 300 K for μ ≈ 0.1 eV, which is higher than that for CaZrSe3 (2300 μV K−1)21 and significantly greater than that of other competing electronic materials20 (highest S ≈ 2000 μV K−1 for GeS).
 Fig. 5  Electronic transport properties as a function of chemical potential μ for BaZrS3. (a) Seebeck coefficient S, (b) electrical conductivity σ, (c) electronic thermal conductivity κe, (d) power factor PF, all across a range of temperatures. S is highest within a short chemical potential range in the neighborhood of 0 eV. Both σ and κe attain higher values for μ > 1 eV and <−1 eV. The highest PF is achieved for μ ≈ 1.2 eV. 
As T increases from 300 to 600 K, S reduces to ∼1500 μV K−1 due to the increased entropy. Also, S being inversely proportional to T, as noted in the correlation between S and Peltier coefficient,2,25 contributes to this variation. The peak S values are obtained for μ in the range of 0 ± 0.2 eV. On the other hand, while σ varies nonlinearly with μ, the highest σ are achieved at μ ≈ −2.8 eV and 1.8 eV. Note that σ ≈ 0 eV at μ ≈ ± 0.5 eV. Fig. 5(b) also reveals how σ can be tuned with p-type (negative μ) and n-type (positive μ) doping. κe increases with T as observed from Fig. 5(c) due to an increased number of carriers. The highest κe are achieved at μ ≈ −3 and 1.8 eV. Finally, the highest PF values are, thus, predicted for p-type doping at μ ≈ −1, −3.6 eV and for n-type doping at μ ≈ 1.2 eV.
The evolution of the thermoelectricity relevant electronic transport properties, viz., S, σ, and κe as a function of μ at 300 K is illustrated in Fig. 6 to understand the underlying anisotropy in the different lattice directions for both p- and n-type doping. S exhibits no anisotropic effects, while σ and κe reveal strong directional dependence for −1 < μ > 1. The highest σ and κe are achieved along the a and b lattice directions for both p- and n-type doping. We corroborate that these variations are due to the low carrier effective mass along the corresponding lattice directions under doping.

S exhibits no anisotropic effects while σ and κe show strong dependencies, especially their high values along the a and b crystallographic directions. 
The distribution of ZTe with μ across different temperatures for both p- and n-type doping is presented in Fig. 7. While no significant differences in ZTe are noted, with respect to T at μ ≈ ±1 eV, we observe a high ZTe ≈ 1 at μ ≈ ±1 eV. The highest ZTe = 1.08 is achieved at μ ≈ −4.0 eV as well as at higher μ values for p-type doping. The high ZTe arises primarily due to a combination of high S and low κe of BaZrS3. This result identifies a potential range for μ at which BaZrS3 can be designed to achieve an optimum thermoelectric efficiency.
 Fig. 7  Upper limit of the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZTe, for BaZrS3 at different temperatures. A high ZTe of ∼1.08 is achieved at 300 K, while relatively higher ZTe values are observed for p-type doping than for n-type doping. 
Conclusion
We examine the electronic transport and optical properties of the distorted orthorhombic perovskite BaZrS3. The material has an optical band gap of 1.79 eV that is in the neighborhood of the optimum band gap of 1.35 eV for single junction photovoltaic applications. At photon energies of 3 eV, we calculate a high optical absorption coefficient of 3 × 105 cm−1. Also, there is an early onset to optical absorption at 0.5 eV that is significantly below the optical band gap. The power factor PF and upper limit of the thermoelectric figure of merit ZTe are predicted at several carrier concentrations, while a carrier concentration of 1017 cm−3 is identified to yield optimum properties, where we calculate the Seebeck coefficient S, electrical conductivity σ, and electron thermal conductivity κe.
The highest S is observed for p-type doping relative to n-type doping while σ produces high values for n-type doping compared to p-type doping. The electronic transport properties display strong directional dependence across all temperatures for both p- and n-type doping. The variation of the electronic properties with chemical potential μ for both p- and n-type doping reveals that BaZrS3 exhibits high S ≈ 3000 μV K−1 when doped within a narrow chemical potential range of 0 ± 0.3 eV. The highest σ are observed when BaZrS3 is doped at μ ≈ −2.8 eV and 1.8 eV while the highest PF values are achieved at chemical potentials μ ≈ −1 and −3.5 eV for p-type doping and μ ≈ 1.2 eV for n-type doping. Thus, the highest PF is observed for n-type doping due to the corresponding higher electrical conductivity (∼2× that of p-type doping). Strong anisotropic dependencies are observed along the a and b lattice directions for σ and κe for p-type and n-type doping. The highest ZTe ≈ 1.0 and 1.08 achieved at μ ≈ ±1 and −4 eV, respectively, together with lattice conductivities,15 suggests that BaZrS3 holds potential for thermoelectric applications, as has been also suggested previously,42 in addition to its capability for high photovoltaic performance.
Methods
Mermin's finite temperature DFT26 implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)27 is used to perform all the DFT calculations. Ba, Zr and S atoms electronic configurations are represented by [Xe]6s2, [Kr]4d25s2 and [Ne]3s23p4 respectively. The core part of the valence electron wavefunctions, which are constrained, as well as the valence electron wavefunctions are represented by the Projector Augmented Wavefunction (PAW) pseudopotentials.28 The number of planewaves that are needed to effectively describe the electrons close to the nuclei are significantly reduced with the use of the PAW pseudopotentials. The unit cell and atomic positions are relaxed using the PBEsol29 functional for solids while the Methfessel–Paxton30 smearing scheme is utilized with the gamma parameter set to 0.1 eV. An energy cut-off of 600 eV is used for the planewave expansion. A Monkhorst–Pack31 special grid sampling of the k-points for integration of the Brillouin zone yields 7 × 5 × 7 k-points representing 123 irreducible number of sampling points for all bulk calculations. Resolution of the Kohn–Sham equations is achieved by using the self-consistent field procedure and setting energy changes for each cycle at 10−4 eV as the convergence criterion between two successive iterations. The distorted orthorhombic structure of BaZrS3 is illustrated in Fig. 8. For the band gap and the optical absorption spectrum calculations, the hybrid HSE06 functional32 is used. The mixing parameter α that controls the amount of the Hartree–Fock exchange energy is set to 0.25, while the long-range part of the exchange (ω) is set to 0.2 Å−1.

The transport properties are determined using the linearized Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation as implemented in the BoltzTraP18 code. The code uses a Fourier expansion of the electronic energies calculated from VASP for the optimized structures. A denser k-mesh of 120000 points is used to ensure accurate transport properties are predicted. The thermoelectric figure of merit , where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is temperature, κe and κL are the electronic thermal and lattice thermal conductivities, respectively.  denotes the upper limit of ZT. Although S is independent of the relaxation time τ, σ and κe are dependent on the choice of τ. Here, we use τ = 10−14 s, which yields predictions that concur with experimental measurements.19,20 The Sumo Python toolkit is used to characterize the electronic band structure and the UV-Vis absorption spectrum.33 The carrier relaxation time is calculated using the electron–phonon (optical and acoustic) interaction as implemented in the Electron–Phonon Wannier (EPW) code.34,35
All self-consistent (SCF), non self-consistent (non-SCF) and phonon calculations needed for the electron–phonon coupling matrix are performed with the Quantum-Espresso (QE)36–38 package. Initially, we calculate the Kohn–Sham wavefunctions and Eigenvalues through the Brillouin zone of the crystal using an SCF, followed by a non-SCF which provides the DFT band structure with an under-estimated band gap as compared to the HSE06 band gap. This process was followed by a full phonon spectrum calculation using a 3 × 3 × 3 coarse q-grid, yielding 8 irreducible q-points. We scrutinize the phonon spectrum and find no imaginary frequency pockets as we have reported previously.15 This data is used in constructing the dynamical matrix required for computing the electron–phonon coupling matrix. In the first part of the EPW calculation, the coarse 3 × 3 × 3 phonon q-grid is interpolated onto a fine 120 × 120 × 120 grid in combination with the k-point path employed to determine the electronic band structure. For obtaining the electron–phonon coupling constant, we use the Maximally Localized Wannier Functions (MLWF)39–41 to interpolate the electronic band structure. The interpolation is performed by projecting the Wannier functions on the Zr-d and S-p orbitals since these contribute the most to the conduction and valence bands around the Fermi level as can be noted from Fig. 1. Additionally, in the Wannier interpolation scheme, we select a disentanglement window between 5.5 to −2.5 eV while the frozen window is selected to be between 5.0 to −1.5 eV. The electron self-energy Σnk for band n and state k is derived from the interpolated dense electron–phonon coupling matrix elements, while the relaxation time τ is calculated from the scattering rate using , where ℏ is the reduced Planck constant. The imaginary part of the electron self-energy is used in estimating the scattering rate at different temperatures. Thus, the relaxation time was calculated using the self-energy relaxation time approximation as implemented in the EPW code as scattering_serta.

 	Fig. 1  Electronic band structure and projected density of states (DOS) for BaZrS3 orthorhombic distorted perovskite. The calculated direct band gap at the Γ (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) point is 1.79 eV.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) UV-Vis absorption spectrum and (b) imaginary part of the dielectric constant (ε2) for BaZrS3 in the orthorhombic distorted perovskite phase. The inset in figure (a) displays magnified area of photon energies before the optical band gap of 1.79 eV. The vertical lines signify the position of the optical band gap of BaZrS3.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) The scattering rate as a function of energy and (b) the carrier relaxation time τ as a function of temperature for electrons (n-type) and holes (p-type). The extracted carrier relaxation time is 10−14 s.	 

 	Fig. 4  Electronic transport properties of BaZrS3 at a carrier concentration of 1017 cm3 for p-type doping. (a) Seebeck coefficient S with anisotropic contributions from all three crystallographic directions, (b) electrical conductivity σ along the a, b and c crystal lattice directions, (c) electronic thermal conductivity κe along the lattice directions, and (d) power factor PF at different temperatures. There are significant anisotropic effects in the thermoelectric properties at all temperatures, especially for σ and κe. The highest PF is achieved at 350 K.	 

 	Fig. 5  Electronic transport properties as a function of chemical potential μ for BaZrS3. (a) Seebeck coefficient S, (b) electrical conductivity σ, (c) electronic thermal conductivity κe, (d) power factor PF, all across a range of temperatures. S is highest within a short chemical potential range in the neighborhood of 0 eV. Both σ and κe attain higher values for μ > 1 eV and <−1 eV. The highest PF is achieved for μ ≈ 1.2 eV.	 

 	Fig. 6  Anisotropic contributions to carrier transport at 300 K along the a, b and c lattice directions of BaZrS3 to (a) the Seebeck coefficient S, (b) electrical conductivity σ, and (c) electronic thermal conductivity κe. S exhibits no anisotropic effects while σ and κe show strong dependencies, especially their high values along the a and b crystallographic directions.	 

 	Fig. 7  Upper limit of the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZTe, for BaZrS3 at different temperatures. A high ZTe of ∼1.08 is achieved at 300 K, while relatively higher ZTe values are observed for p-type doping than for n-type doping.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Side and (b) top views of the distorted perovskite structure of BaZrS3.
