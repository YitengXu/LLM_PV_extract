    , Accepted 25th July 2018First published on 26th July 2018AbstractAs a crucial photoelectric material, TiO2 microspheres have been widely applied as photoanodes in photovoltaic devices owing to their large surface area, suitable pore size and prominent scattering effect. However, surface states in the TiO2 films playing a significant role in the charge transport process are an important factor influencing the photovoltaic performance. Herein, solid and hollow TiO2 microspheres were compared to investigate the influence of the density and distribution of surface states. The density and distribution of surface states, charge recombination process and band edge shifts were investigated. The results showed that the density of surface states of the TiO2 microspheres decreased after recrystallization, leading to a suppressed charge recombination rate. Moreover, owing to the hollow architecture, recrystallized hollow microspheres (rHM) have higher photon utilization. As a result, a photoelectric conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells based on the rHM up to 10.57% was obtained.
Introduction
In recent years, as photoanode materials, TiO2 microspheres have received significant attention due to their large surface area, suitable pore size, and superior light scattering effects.1–6 Besides, remarkable electron transport and weak recombination characteristics are also very important for high-efficiency devices. Here, surface states play a great role in the electron transport and recombination processes in a photovoltaic device.7–9 The diffusion of electrons will be restricted by trapping/detrapping events due to numerous surface states caused by the defects and grain boundaries existing in the interstices of TiO2 building blocks.10,11 Thus, studying the effects of surface states on electron transport is beneficial to develop prominent photoanode materials.1,7,12,13 Thus, many researchers have done a lot of related studies. Bisquert et al. found that the surface states were distributed in the form of exponential distribution, and the electron concentration in the surface states was higher than that in the conduction band.14 It was found by Grätzel et al. that surface state electrons move to deeper levels by illumination in terms of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method, leading to the lowering of the Fermi level.15 The density of surface states (DOS) in TiO2 microspheres was lower than that in TiO2 nanoparticles, causing a better performance of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).7
TiO2 solid microspheres (SM) and hollow microspheres (HM) are usually employed as photoanode materials in photovoltaic devices.16–18 However, the DOS values of these two kinds of microspheres are quite different due to their different architectures and crystallinities. A large discrepancy in the BET surface area also resulted in the diversity of DOS between SM and HM. These factors would influence the charge transport in the TiO2 microspheres severely. But studies related to the DOS of TiO2 SM and HM have barely been reported, as far as we know. Herein, SM and HM were compared to investigate the influence of DOS. Moreover, the obtained SM and HM were recrystallized by further solvothermal treatment (denoted as rSM and rHM). Then, the DOS and distribution of surface states of the obtained TiO2 microspheres were investigated by the CV method and charge extraction (CE) method. To understand the recombination process, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and the band edge shifts of the four kinds of microspheres were further characterized.
Experimental section
Synthesis of TiO2 microspheres
All the chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. The TiO2 solid and hollow microspheres were synthesized by controlling the solvent ratio in the solvothermal treatment. In a typical synthesis of HM, 10 ml of acetylacetone, 40 ml of IPA, and 2 ml of TTIP were mixed under vigorous stirring at ambient temperature. Meanwhile, SM was synthesized by mixing 25 ml of IPA and 25 ml of acetylacetone with 2 ml of TTIP. The two kinds of solutions were sealed within Teflon-lined autoclaves (100 ml) and heated at 200 °C for 16 h. After being washed, the air-dried powders were dried at 60 °C for 12 h in air to produce the microspheres for characterization. In addition, the obtained hollow and solid microspheres were recrystallized by a further hydrothermal treatment with a suitable dosage of ammonia to form recrystallized TiO2 hollow and solid microspheres. For simplicity, the obtained TiO2 microspheres were denoted as SM (solid microspheres), HM (hollow microspheres), rSM (recrystallized solid microspheres) and rHM (recrystallized hollow microspheres), respectively.
DSSC fabrication
The prepared TiO2 microsphere powder was mixed with ethanol, ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol to form different pastes. The four pastes were then printed onto FTO glass (15 Ω sq−1) by screen printing operation. Afterwards, the TiO2 photoanodes were soaked in 0.1 M aqueous TiCl4 solution and stored in a container at 60 °C for 30 min. These films were sintered again at 510 °C for 30 min after washing with distilled water. Then, these four different kinds of films were immersed in a C101 dye solution (3 × 10−4 M) with cheno-3a,7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholic acid for 12 hours. After washing with acetonitrile and drying, the films were assembled with a Pt-modified counter electrode and a laser engraved 60 μm Surlyn gasket under heat and pressure. The electrolyte solution (50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 1 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) in a solvent mixture of 15% valeronitrile with 85% acetonitrile) was introduced into the space between the counter electrode and photoanodes.19 Finally, a packaging glass with a Surlyn gasket was assembled onto it to acquire the integrated device.
Characterization
The morphologies of the TiO2 samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (S-4800, HITACHI, Japan). The composition of the products was characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) (Rigaku, Smartlab, Japan) in the 2θ range from 10° to 70° at room temperature. The SSA of the materials was estimated via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The film thicknesses were measured by using a profilometer (XP-2, AMBIOS Technology, Inc., USA), which is shown in the ESI.† UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra were obtained using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SOLID 3700, Shimadzu Co. Ltd, Japan). Cyclic voltammetry curves were obtained by using a standard three-electrode cell (employing prepared films as the working electrode, Hg/HgCl (0.1 M LiClO4) as the reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode) to study the DOS in TiO2 microspheres. CE was measured on an IM6e workstation (Zahner, Germany) using light-emitting diodes (λ = 610 nm) driven by Xpot (Germany, Zahner). A computer controlled potentiostat (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzerland) in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 1 MHz applied in the dark was applied to record electrochemical impedance spectral (EIS) data. Band edge movements of the TiO2 microspheres were calculated according to intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS), which is also performed on an IM6e workstation with the same LEDs. Current density–voltage curves were obtained by using a Keithley model 2420 digital source meter controlled by Test point software under a xenon lamp (100 mW cm−2). The IPCE values were measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 800 nm (PV Measurements, Inc.) for DSSCs.
Results and discussion
Morphological structure of TiO2 microspheres

Fig. 1(a–h) show the SEM images of the SM, HM, rSM, and rHM, respectively. Hollow micrometer-sized spheres were unambiguously observed (Fig. 1b and d) according to the broken structure. The hollow structure might be helpful to improve the light scattering of TiO2 microspheres, causing a higher photo-induced electron concentration in the microsphere, whose schematic is shown in Fig. 1i.20 The conclusion can be drawn from the UV-vis diffused reflectance spectra. As shown in Fig. S1a,† the light scattering effect of HM is better than that of SM. Also, solid micrometer-sized spheres could be unambiguously observed without any broken structure in Fig. 1a and c. In addition, as shown in the XRD patterns (Fig. 1j), all the diffraction peaks of the four samples can be well indexed to the anatase phase of TiO2, without any detectable secondary phases. Moreover, nitrogen adsorption–desorption curves are shown in Fig. 1k. As a result of the BET measurements, the SSAs of the SM, HM, rSM, and rHM are 117.37, 148.73, 62.42, and 70.38 m2 g−1, respectively.

Density and distribution of surface states in TiO2 microspheres
The DOS can be obtained according to the CV results.21,22 CV curves are shown in Fig. 2a. The detailed process is as follows: on applying an increasing negative potential, i.e., a forward bias, the quasi-Fermi level would move to the conduction band.23 As the quasi-Fermi level touched the edge of the conduction band, the electrons trapped by surface states would be injected to the conduction band, leading to the increase of capacitive current, forming a capacitive current curve. When the potential increased positively, the current was close to zero, indicating the recovery of the injected negative charge and the regeneration of surface states. The energy level distribution can be deduced by the following equations23 (1) (2)where Q is the total injected charge, V is the potential applied on the TiO2 photoelectrode, DOS is the density of surface states, NA is the Avogadro constant, F is Faraday's constant, I(V) is the capacitive current, and ν represents the constant scanning rate in cyclic voltammetry. In this measurement, the scanning rate is 500 mV s−1. According to the equations, the DOS of the TiO2 microspheres is proportional to the current when ν is the same.

(e) Nyquist diagram from electrochemical impedance spectra at a forward biase of −0.75 V. (f) Chemical capacitance per active area. (g) Electron recombination resistance per active area of DSSCs (the missing points are overlapped). 
As shown in Fig. 2a, the decreasing order of the capacitive current of the four TiO2 films is HM > SM > rHM > rSM, indicating the same decreasing order of DOS in the four samples. Generally, a larger SSA would lead to more surface states. Thus, the decreasing DOS order is in accord with the SSA results of the four samples. For HM > SM and rHM > rSM, the DOS of hollow microspheres is larger than that of solid microspheres, which might be attributed to the hollow structure and larger SSA. For HM > rHM and SM > rSM, the results indicated that recrystallization is beneficial to decrease the DOS of the TiO2 microsphere. Besides, the conduction band edge movement can be deduced via the corresponding potential when the value of capacitive current is higher than 0 in a forward bias process. A lower potential means that the edge of the conduction band of TiO2 moved negatively toward the vacuum.23 When the value of capacitive currents were higher than 0, the corresponding potentials of HM, SM, rHM, and rSM were −0.09 V, −0.27 V, −0.41 V and −0.38 V, respectively, indicating that the edge of the conduction band of rHM moved negatively most, which would cause a higher open-circuit voltage of devices. The discussion related to band edge shifts will be elaborated in the later section.
The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) is a useful method to study the recombination of the photo-induced charge.22 Furthermore, the OCVD was used combined with the measurement to acquire the distribution of the surface states in the forbidden band. The OCVD and CE processes are shown in Fig. 2b. At first, the photovoltage of the cell became steady under the illumination with a LED light source with a wavelength of 610 nm. Then, the photovoltage (Uphoto) of the device decayed after 2 seconds with the LED closed. After a while, the photovoltage was close to zero with the device short circuit. Meanwhile, the photo-induced charge (Qphoto) was extracted. The output Voc is measured as a function of time in the above process. Total charge extracted is given by22 (3)where Qtrap is the charge trapped in the surface states, EF is the equilibrium Fermi level in the dark and E′F is the quasi Fermi level of electrons under illumination, and Ntrap(E) is the DOS. The Qtrap is almost equivalent to the Qphoto as a result of the majority of electrons being located in trapping states.22
For different duration times of the Uphoto decay, the rest of Uphoto and Qphoto varied widely. The relationship between the Uphoto and Qphoto could be obtained by controlling the Uphoto decay time. This followed that the distribution of DOS and the Uphoto is given by22 (4) qUphoto = E′F − EF(5)

Fig. 2c shows the DOS distribution results of the TiO2 microspheres according to the difference in the plot of Qphotoversus Uphoto and eqn (4). As the results showed, the DOS decreased exponentially with the energy level depth and increased when the energy level became closer to the conduction band. The decreasing order of DOS is HM > SM > rHM > rSM at the same energy level, which is in accordance with the CV results. A lower DOS in rHM and rSM would decrease the charge recombination in the TiO2 microsphere and be helpful to improve the performance of the cells. As shown in Fig. 2d obviously, the rSM based DSSCs displayed a much slower Voc decay rate, which was ascribed to the lowest DOS in the rSM.
Charge recombination process
To explore the charge recombination process in DSSCs,24,25 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was carried out on cells based on the four kinds of TiO2 microspheres with different biases under dark conditions. The obtained EIS results were analyzed with standard fitting models and equivalent circuits (shown in the inset of Fig. 2e) according to the literature.26,27Fig. 2e shows the Nyquist diagram of the four devices at −0.75 V under dark conditions. There are two semicircles in every curve, the smaller one in the higher frequency region and the bigger one in the lower frequency region, which indicated the interface of the Pt electrode and the TiO2 photoelectrode, respectively. The smaller semicircles of the four DSSCs appear similarly because of the same Pt electrode applied in the four DSSCs. Otherwise, owing to the difference in the four kinds of TiO2 samples, the bigger semicircle in the lower frequency region shows large differences. The recombination resistance (Rct) relationship of the four samples can be acquired according to the radius of the bigger semicircle. The Rct of DSSCs increased significantly from 16.75 Ω to 38.71 Ω with the order of HM, SM, rSM, and rHM, indicating that a lower recombination rate occurred within DSSCs based on the TiO2 microsphere after recrystallization. The most severe electron recombination process in the DSSCs based on the HM was ascribed to its highest DOS. Besides, the information about the surface states could also be obtained by EIS measurements. As we know in the CV measurements, the chemical capacitance is closely related to the surface states information. By fitting the EIS results, the chemical capacitance of the four samples can be acquired. The charges existing in the TiO2 films are given by (6)where Qdark is the total charge in the film, V0 is the initial potential, Vbias is the applied potential, and c is the potential dependent capacitance. The DOS can also be described by the capacitance (DOS = c/e). The distribution of the surface states in the forbidden band of TiO2 can be described according to the chemical capacitance as a function of applied potential as follows25 (7) cu = C/sc(8)where C is the chemical capacitance, Ca is the prefactor of the exponential, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, V is the applied potential, cu is the capacitance per active area, sc is the active area of the cell, and α is a parameter related to the distribution of surface states (α < 1). A smaller α suggested more and deeper traps in the intra-band of TiO2.28–30 The α value relationship of the four samples obtained from fitting and calculating was rSM > rHM > SM > HM, indicating the decrease of the DOS in the deeper traps of the recrystallized TiO2 microsphere. The results are similar to the CE results. The α values of the four samples are listed in Table 1.

Fig. 2g shows the recombination resistance per active area (rct) as a function of applied voltage. The rct decreased with the increasing of the applied voltage due to the increasing of charge recombination, which was caused by acceleration of the electron transport at a higher voltage. Moreover, the charge transport process information can be obtained in terms of the recombination resistance (Rct), which follows an exponential behavior25 (9)where A is a constant and β is the charge transport coefficient, depending on the temperature. The charge recombination was carried out by the conduction band with the electrolyte directly when β = 1. Otherwise, if β < 1, the charge recombination process would involve surface states.25 Moreover, a lower β value suggested that the surface states impact the charge recombination to a higher degree. The β values of four kinds of devices are listed after calculating in terms of formula (7) in Table 1. The β values of all the samples were less than 1, indicating that the surface states contribute to charge recombination in the four cells, especially the cell based on SM and HM. The electron lifetime in darkness was calculated by τn = Rct × C, where τn represents the electron lifetime and C represents the chemical capacitance,31 which would affect the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the DSSCs. As shown in Table 1, the τn value decreased with the order of rHM, rSM, HM, and SM, which is similar to the IMVS/IMPS result in our previous work.20 The results indicated that the Jsc of DSSCs based on rHM was higher than that of others.
Band edge movements
Band edge movements of the TiO2 microsphere were measured by intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS). According to the IMPS/IMVS results, the photoinduced charge (Q) in the TiO2 films can be calculated.32,33Fig. 3a shows Voc as a function of ln(Q), and the linear relationship could be described by the following equation Voc = Vc + mclnQ(10)where Vc is the vertical intercept, while ln(Q) = 0, and mc is the slope. The mechanism of charge recombination can be revealed according to the calculated mc values of every sample. If mc > 26 mV, the charge recombination would be carried out via surface states primarily.29,32 Otherwise, the conduction band would contribute to more recombination. According to Fig. 3a, the mc values ranged from 194 mV to 238 mV for the four kinds of samples, indicating that the charge recombination mainly occurs via surface states. The results are in accordance with the charge transport coefficient results from the EIS measurement.
 Fig. 3  (a) Voc as a function of ln(Q) for DSSCs. (b) J–V curves of DSSCs fabricated by employing the different TiO2 microspheres under one sun AM 1.5G illumination. 
The band edge movement condition can be deduced from the Vc value of every sample. It is obvious from Fig. 3a that the decreasing order of Vc is rHM > rSM > SM > HM. A greater Vc suggests that the conduction band moves to the vacuum energy level negatively, which would result in a higher open-circuit voltage of the DSSCs based on the TiO2 photoanode when Q is the same.29 On the other hand, for rSM and HM, the charges accumulated in the films of rSM are less than those of HM at the same Voc, leading to a lower Jsc than that of HM.
Performances of devices

Fig. 3b shows the photo-current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs based on various TiO2 photoanodes under one AM 1.5G solar light illumination (100 mW cm−2). The photovoltaic characterization results of five devices are summarized in Table 2. The performances of these devices exhibited an increasing order of Jsc from solid spheres to hollow spheres, from unrecrystallized TiO2 microspheres to recrystallized TiO2 microspheres. The reason for the Jsc order of HM > SM might be ascribed to the hollow structure. Owing to the better light reflecting and scattering capability, HM shows higher light utilization than SM (Fig. 1f).20 In this way, the photo-induced charge concentration of HM is higher than that of SM, leading to a higher Jsc in HM. For the Jsc order of rHM > HM and rSM > SM, the reason might be that recrystallization decreased the DOS in TiO2, leading to lower charge recombination in rHM and rSM. The decreasing order of Voc for the DSSCs based on the four TiO2 microspheres is rHM > rSM > SM > HM due to two main reasons. For one thing, the Voc of the DSSCs was affected by band edge shifts. According to the relationship between Voc and ln(Q) in Fig. 3a and the CV results, compared to HM, the band edge shifts negatively in the decreasing order of rHM > rSM > SM, resulting in an increase of Voc of rHM. For another, the Voc value of the DSSCs was correlated with the charge recombination in the conduction band of TiO2. In terms of the EIS results, the decreasing order of recombination resistance is rHM > rSM > SM > HM, indicating the most severe electron recombination process in the DSSCs based on HM. In addition, the decreasing order of PCE for all the samples is rHM > HM > rSM > SM, which was ascribed to the better scattering effect in hollow spheres. The scattering effect results can be evidenced by IPCE measurement. As Fig. S1b† shows, the decreasing order of IPCE for all the samples is rHM > HM > rSM > SM, which is in accordance with the PCE results.

Conclusions
To summarize, the DOS and band edge shifts of four different kinds of TiO2 microspheres were investigated. Despite the higher DOS of HM than that of SM causing serious charge recombination, the Jsc and PCE performance for HM are still more splendid than that of SM due to better light scattering in HM caused by the hollow structure. Besides, the DOS of the recrystallized TiO2 microspheres decreased observably, because of which the charge recombination suppressed effectively. Thus, the Jsc and PCE of the DSSCs were improved notably. In addition, the band edge of the SM and HM shifting negatively after recrystallization also resulted in the Voc improvements of the DSSCs. In conclusion, owing to the suppression of charge recombination on account of the decrease of DOS after recrystallization and the higher photon utilization because of the hollow structure, rHM is optimized to attain the highest PCE, which is superior to that of SM, HM, and rSM. This study made a fundamental contribution to understanding and analyzing the impact of DOS on charge transport and charge recombination in TiO2 photoanode materials.
