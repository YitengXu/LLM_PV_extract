    , Accepted 3rd February 2021First published on 4th February 2021AbstractPhotodetectors based on two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) semiconducting heterostructures have attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their novel performance. Here, we found that the photodetection performance of the graphene (Gr)/Si 2D/3D heterostructure can be very broadly enhanced by introducing an optimized ultrathin WS2 film prepared by sulfidation as an interfacial layer. The fabricated Gr/WS2(10.9 nm)/Si photodetector shows a wide spectralresponse from 400 to 1800 nm with a maximum photoresponsivity of 8.96 × 104 A W−1 and photodetectivity of 8.86 × 1011 Jones at 690 nm, which are more than three orders of magnitude higher than that of the Gr/Si photodetector. Such a high photoresponsivity can be attributed to the strong photogain induced by the hole trap states that exist in the WS2 film. With the increase in the WS2 film thickness, the photoresponsivity increases firstly owing to the increase of hole trap states, and then decreases due to the decrease in light transmittance through WS2. The device also shows a high responsivity of 0.735 A W−1 at 1550 nm by forming type-II interlayer excitation. Our results indicate that 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) could be a good candidate functioning as an interfacial layer for high performance Gr/Si photodetectors, which provide a facile way for enhancing the photodetection performance of van der Waals 2D/3D heterostructure photodetectors.
Introduction
The photodetector is one of the key components in an optoelectronic system. It is important for a wide range of applications such as imaging, remote sensing, optical communication, and security.1–5 In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have shown great potential in photodetection because of their strong light–matter interactions, and tunable band gaps with a number of layers.6–13
Among these reported 2D-material-based photodetectors, photodiodes can remarkably enhance the separation and transportation of photoexcited carriers due to the strong built-in electric field (BEF) near the junction interface.14,15 For example, by directly stacking the 2D materials onto traditional 3D semiconductor materials, high quality 2D/3D hybrid heterojunctions can be instantly built without worrying about the lattice mismatch.16–22 These 2D/3D heterostructures combine the unique optical properties of 2D layered materials and the advantages of mature processing technology of 3D bulk semiconductors. As a typical example, graphene (Gr)/Si van der Waals heterostructures functioning either as solar cells or photodetectors have been extensively investigated.20,23 Due to the semi-metal characteristic of Gr, a Schottky junction is formed. The BEF can efficiently separate the photoexcited carriers and suppresses the dark current, leading to a predominant photocurrent. However, the absolute responsivity is usually smaller than that of a photoconductor or phototransistor due to the lack of photogain.15,24,25 In addition, photon absorption mainly occurs in Si, while Gr acts as a transparent electrode extracting charged carriers, leading to a low photoresponsivity in the near-infrared region limited within the Si absorption range.22 It has been recently reported in the literature that the photodetection performance of the Gr/Si heterostructures can be much enhanced by introducing an interfacial layer.26–29 For example, Ma et al.17 found that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the Gr/Si solar cells can be increased to 111% by introducing a six-layer MoS2 film as an interfacial layer. This interfacial layer can tune the barrier height of the Schottky junction, leading to an increase in the width of the BEF and the photosensitive volume, and suppress the recombination rate of photoexcited carriers.17,30 Their results imply that the introduction of the TMDC interfacial layer could be an effective method to achieve high performance photodetection. Later on, Lu et al.26 found that the performance of the Gr/Si photodetectors could be improved by inserting a layer of mechanically exfoliated In2S3. The charge-trap-states in the In2S3 interfacial layer can trap one kind of photocarrier, leading to the increased lifetime of the other kind of photoexcited carriers. They thus achieved a high responsivity of 4.53 × 104 A W−1. Meanwhile, the strong BEF can accelerate the separation of photoexcited carriers, resulting in a fast photoresponse of 40 μs. More recently, Lu et al.28 showed that a high detectivity of 6.8 × 1013 Jones can be achieved by introducing a pulse laser deposited (PLD) MoTe2 film into a Gr/Si heterojunction photodetector. Nevertheless, the systematic study on the effect of the TMDC interfacial layer on the photoresponse of the Gr/Si heterostructure is still lacking, which needs further investigation.
In previous work, we reported the large-scale compatible fabrication of high responsive Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure photodetectors and the junction capacitance related photoresponse properties.27 Here, we further investigate the short-wave infrared response of these detectors and the effect of WS2 thickness on their photoresponse performances. We found that compared with the Gr/Si, the Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure photodetector exhibited a distinctive improved photoresponse. With a 10.9 nm-thick WS2 interfacial layer, the Gr/WS2/Si device exhibited a broad response in the spectral range of 400–1800 nm, an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 8.96 × 104 A W−1 and a high photodetectivity of 8.86 × 1011 Jones at 690 nm, and a fast response speed with a rise time of 0.84 ms and decay time of 2.1 ms. More importantly, the device possesses a high responsivity of 0.735 A W−1 at 1550 nm. In addition, compared with Gr/Si, the device has good long-term stability and durability owing to the protection of the WS2 interfacial layer. Our findings thus shed light on the important role of the interfacial layer in enhancing the performance of van der Waals 2D/3D heterojunction photodetectors.
Results and discussion
We prepared the Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure photodetectors by the microfabrication technology including photolithography, etching, deposition and sulfurization of the WO3 film, electrode deposition, and transfer of graphene (see the detailed fabrication process in Fig. S1, ESI†). The schematic of the device is shown in Fig. 1a. The top graphene can not only work as the transparent electrode but also avoid Ag oxidation. The WS2 layer (10.9 nm) acts as an interfacial layer separating the direction of contact of Gr with Si. We found that the device with a 10.9 nm-thick WS2 interfacial layer shows the highest responsivity (see later discussion). Without light illumination, the device shows an obvious diode-like rectifying current–voltage (I–V) curve (Fig. 1b and also see linear plots in Fig. S2a, ESI†). Under light illumination (650 nm), an obvious photoresponse can be observed under a negative bias voltage, which increases with the increase of the incident light intensity. Usually, the photocurrent Iphoto, is defined as the difference between the current with and without light illumination (Iphoto = |Ilight − Idark|), which heavily relies on the light intensity and reverse bias voltage. With the increase of the light intensity, the photocurrent increases remarkably and approaches about 1.03 nA and 0.12 mA at a bias voltages of 0 and −5 V, respectively, when the light intensity is about 889.2 μW cm−2 (Fig. S2, ESI†). The photocurrent as a function of light intensity with a bias voltage of −5 V is shown in Fig. 1c, which presents a sub-linear relationship between the photocurrent and light intensity (P). The data can be well-fitted by the equation (1)where A is a fitting parameter, and α is an exponential coefficient. By fitting the data, an exponential coefficient of 0.76 is determined. The obtained value is less than 1, indicating the existence of trap states.31 To quantitatively evaluate the photodetection performance of the device, one of the most important figures of merit, photoresponsivity (R) is calculated, which is defined as (2)where Iphoto is the photocurrent and S is the photosensitive area. In our calculation, S is the internal area (314 μm2) of the ring electrode that comprises the Gr/WS2/Si junction region and the oxide region. The reason for counting the contribution from the internal oxide region is mainly the photocarrier diffusion in Si.22 According to eqn (1) and (2), the photoresponsivity R is proportional to P1−α. Thus, the largest photoresponsivity is 8.4 × 104 A W−1 at a light intensity of 8.8 μW cm−2, and a relatively low photoresponsivity of 4 × 104 A W−1 when the light intensity increases to 899.2 μW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 1c (red line). Note that similar power-law relationships have been observed in other photodetectors and were attributed to the enhanced photocarrier recombination rate at a higher light intensity.25,31 These high responsivities can be explained through the existence of a hole trap in the WS2 film, which increases the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, leading to photogain.27 To verify the accuracy of the high R value apart from in an occasional case, we measured 26 devices in total with optimized thickness. We found that 65% of the as-fabricated devices show responsivities higher than 104 A W−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†). In addition, the device shows good stability when the incident light is alternately turned on and off (Fig. S3, ESI†). To determine the response time of the photodetector, high-resolution time-resolved current under modulated light irradiation was measured as shown in Fig. 1d. The rise time (tr) and the decay time (td), defined as the time interval for the current changes from 10% to 90% when light is turned on or off, and are estimated to be 0.84 and 2.1 ms, respectively.

(b) I–V curve characterization of the device in the dark and under light illumination with varying light intensities. (c) Photocurrent and responsivity as a function of light density. (d) Time-resolved current under modulated light illumination (P = 617 μW cm−2). 
Furthermore, we found that the device is also sensitive to infrared light. As shown in Fig. 2a, the device exhibits a clear photoresponse under 1550 nm light illumination. Fig. 2b shows the temporal response measured under modulated light illumination with varying light intensities from 22 to 230 mW cm−2 at −5 V, and the photocurrent changes from 0.05 to 0.41 μA, corresponding to the responsivity from 0.67 to 0.54 A W−1, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). The 1550 nm light response can be attributed to the absorption by defect energy levels in the WS2 film, and the type-II staggered band alignment in the WS2/Si heterojunction which can enable interlayer excitation due to the small band offset between the valence band maximum of Si and conduction band minimum of WS2 (see detailed information in Fig. S5, ESI†).27,28,32–35 To investigate the wavelength-dependent response characteristic, the spectral response was measured as shown in Fig. 2c and d. It was measured at a fixed incident light intensity of 19 μW cm−2 in the range of 400–1130 nm. Due to the relatively weak photoresponse in the range of 1150–1800 nm, the light intensity was set at 250 μW cm−2 in order to obtain a more accurate photoresponse spectrum in this range. The photodetector shows a broadband photoresponse with a peak sensitivity of 7.93 × 104 A W−1 at 690 nm. The responsivity at 690 nm can reach 8.96 × 104 A W−1 when the light intensity is 6.9 μW cm−2 (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The device exhibits high sensitivity in the range from 400 to 1800 nm and the responsivity drops sharply at around 1100 nm, corresponding to the cutoff wavelength of the absorption spectrum in intrinsic Si. The responsivity in the range from 1150 to 1800 nm is on the order of hundreds of mA W−1, which is possibly due to the defect absorption and interlayer excitation. Importantly, the device shows a high responsivity of 1.05 and 0.735 A W−1 at 1310 and 1550 nm, respectively, indicating its potential applications for optical communication in the O-band and C-band. In general, the response spectra of the device are much wider than those of the common Si-based photodiode, indicating its great potential in short-wave infrared light detection. Furthermore, the internal built-in potential near the junction interface will enable the heterostructure device to detect light signals at zero bias, realizing self-driven photodetection36 (Fig. S6b, ESI†). The high photoresponsivity and broadband response indicate the excellent performance of the Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure photodetector. In comparison to other reported Gr/Si-based photodetectors summarized in Table 1, the photoresponsivity of our device clearly outperforms those of all the others.

For the Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure, the introduction of the WS2 interfacial layer can change the series resistance, the number of interfacial traps, and the band diagrams between graphene and Si. In this regard, the thickness of the interfacial layer (see detailed information in Fig. S7, ESI†) should play an important role in the performance of the Gr/WS2/Si device. All the devices with different WS2 thicknesses show rectification behavior in the dark state and obvious photoresponse under light illumination (Fig. S8, ESI†). However, the photoresponse varied with the change of the WS2 thickness. As shown in Fig. 3a, the responsivity increases to a peak value of 6.8 × 104 A W−1 at 650 nm for 10.9 nm-thick WS2 and then decreases with a further increase of the WS2 thickness. A device with 10.9 nm-thick WS2 exhibits the highest photocurrent (Fig. S8e, ESI†) and responsivity in all devices due to the balance of light transmittance and trap states. For Gr/Si, Gr/WS2 and WS2/Si (Fig. S9, ESI†), the photoresponsivities are in the range of hundreds of mA W−1 to dozens of A W−1, which clarifies that the introduction of the WS2 interfacial layer plays an important role in improving the performance of Gr/Si-based devices. In addition, another figure-of-merit, the specific detectivity (D*), indicating the sensitive of a photodetector, is defined as (3)where e is the charge value of an electron. According to the above equation, the specific detectivity is proportional to the photoresponsivity and inversely proportional to the square root of the dark current, indicating that low dark current and high responsivity imply a higher specific detectivity. Because the series resistance and the barrier heights change with the thickness of the WS2 film, the dark current increases firstly and then decreases, as shown in Fig. S8f (ESI†). Device (21.4 nm thick WS2) exhibits the highest D* of 1.2 × 1012 Jones, which is higher than that of the device (10.9 nm-thick WS2) with 8.0 × 1011 Jones at 650 nm (blue line in Fig. 3a) due to a lower dark current.

(a and b) Responsivity and specific detectivity (a, red line for responsivity and blue line for specific detectivity), and response time (b, red line for rise time and blue line for fall time) as a function of thickness of WS2 films under a reverse bias of −5 V and incident light of 650 nm. (c and d) Spectral response of the device in the wavelength range of 400–1130 nm (c) under a constant light intensity of 19 μW cm−2 and 1150–1800 nm and (d) under a constant light intensity of 250 μW cm−2 at a reverse bias of −5 V. 
The thickness of WS2 can also affect the response speed of the corresponding devices. The response time of the device with different WS2 thicknesses was recorded and the results are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The device (4.7 nm-thick WS2) presents a fast tr of 90 μs and td of 0.2 ms. The response time increases with the thickness of the WS2 film (Fig. 3b), owing to the increase of the electronic transport path and the decrease of the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers resulting from the increase in the number of trap states. Furthermore, the spectral response of the device with different WS2 thicknesses was measured and is shown in Fig. 3c. These photodetectors show high responsivity in the range from 500 to 1000 nm, and the responsivity dropped to lower values at 1100 nm, corresponding to the absorption spectrum and cutoff wavelength of Si. For a deeper understanding of the photoresponse of the detectors, the spectral response in a range from 400 to 1130 nm was plotted in normalized scales as shown in Fig. S11a (ESI†). For the device without the WS2 interfacial layer, the maximum response wavelength is near the band edge of Si. However, for the device with a WS2 interfacial layer, the peak responsivity is about 700 nm due to the introduction of a WS2 film. In the range from 1150 to 1800 nm (Fig. 3d), the responsivity of the Gr/Si heterostructure photodetector is only at the level of sub-mA W−1, while the Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure photodetectors reach hundreds of mA W−1, which means that the defect absorption in WS2 films or interlayer excitation plays a major role when the photon energy is smaller than the band gap of Si. In addition, all the Gr/WS2/Si devices exhibit a self-driven photodetection (Fig. S11b, ESI†) based on a small but detectable photovoltaic effect.28,29,32,33 Fig. S11c (ESI†) shows the responsivity at 1550 nm as a function of thickness of WS2 films, indicating a higher responsivity at the communication band compared with other Gr/Si-based photodetectors.22,28
The exact mechanism of high-performance detection is not known, although it is believed to be associated with defects in the 2D/Si interface. It has been proven that the detection performance can be improved by introducing defects.43 Here, in order to understand the working mechanism of the Gr/WS2/Si photodetector, qualitative energy band diagrams of the photodetector are shown in Fig. 4. The phosphorus doping concentration of Si is 2 × 1015 cm−3, thus the work function (WF) of the doped Si (WSi) is 4.3 eV calculated by the classical formula (see the ESI† Fig. S5).44 For the WS2 film, the WF (WWS2) is about 4.9 and 5.1 eV corresponding to the monolayer and bulk materials, respectively.45 Due to WS2 films with small domains and uncontrolled orderly growth by the thermal sulfurization method, the energy band almost barely changes with thickness, being similar to bulk materials.46,47 Moreover, the WF of graphene (WGr) is slightly larger than the intrinsic value (∼4.56 eV) due to the low level of p-type doping of the substrate, metal doping, water molecules in the air, or the electric field effect tuning process.48 Therefore, before the contacts are formed, graphene, WS2, and Si are located at different Fermi levels, and WSi < WGr < VWS2. After they are in contact with each other, the band will bend according to the classical theory, leading to equal Fermi energy. When the graphene/n-Si heterostructure is formed (Fig. 4a), electrons flow from Si to graphene, resulting in the Fermi level of graphene slightly increasing and the energy levels close to the Si surface bends upward to form a BEF (qφ) from Si to graphene and a Schottky energy barrier ϕm is formed after thermal equilibrium. However, the introduction of WS2 interfacial layer changes the carrier transport characteristics. For the Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure (Fig. 4b), Gr is the transparent electrode, and there are two Schottky junctions. One is between graphene and WS2. Electrons flow from the graphene into the lower energy states in WS2, which bends the energy levels of WS2 downwards and evidently increases the quasi-Fermi level of WS2 and slightly pulls down the quasi-Fermi level of graphene, thus the BEF (qφ1) from graphene to WS2 is established and the barrier height for an electron is ϕ1. The other is between WS2 and n-Si. The electrons in Si inject into WS2, which not only bends the energy levels of Si upwards but also bends the energy levels of WS2 downwards. Therefore, the Schottky junction with a BEF (qφ2) from Si to WS2 is established and the barrier height for electron is ΔEC.

(c and d) Band diagrams under a reverse bias and light illumination. V is the applied reverse bias. EC and EV are the energy of the conduction and valence bands of silicon and EF is the energy of the Fermi level, respectively. ϕm is the barrier height of the electron from graphene to Si. δ is the thickness of the WS2 interfacial layer. ϕ1 and ΔEC are the barrier height of electron from graphene to WS2 and from WS2 to Si, respectively. φ and φ + V are the built-in potential barriers after equilibrium and under reverse bias V for the Gr/Si heterostructure, respectively. φ1 and φ2 are the built-in potential barriers of the heterojunction of graphene/WS2 and WS2/Si for the thick WS2 film, respectively. VWS2 is the potential drop across the interfacial layer. φ2 + V − VWS2 is the built-in potential barriers of the heterojunction of WS2/Si under reverse bias V. 
When graphene is under a negative bias, the Fermi level will be shifted upward (qV) due to the finite density of states (DOS) near the Dirac point, as shown in Fig. 4c. The barrier height for electrons from graphene to Si is reduced. For the Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure (Fig. 4d), there is a potential drop across the WS2 layer, eVWS2, which lifts the quasi-Fermi level of WS2 upward, causing the barrier height from WS2 to Si to sharply decrease or even become negligible. The band bending of Si near the surface becomes steeper. These Schottky barriers lead to diode-like electrical characteristics observed in I–V curves, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The reverse saturation current (Is) for the interfacial improved Gr/Si heterojunction can be modified from the thermionic emission theory as follows44,49 (4)where A* is the effective Richardson constant, T is the absolute temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, and ϕb is the Schottky barrier height. The term  is the transmission coefficient across the WS2 interfacial layer. Eqn (4) suggests that the reverse saturation current can be effectively influenced by the thickness of the interfacial layer and the Schottky barrier height. For the ultrathin WS2 film, electrons may easily tunnel through the film and move to the WS2/Si interface, and the electron barrier height is only ΔEC, which is lower than that in the Gr/Si heterojunction. The reverse saturation current is mainly affected by the Schottky barrier height, and the number of carriers in the WS2 film. Thus, higher dark currents under −5 V were observed in the device with a thin WS2 film. With the thickness increasing, the transmission coefficient across the WS2 interface layer decreases and series resistance increases, causing the dark current to decrease.
Under light illumination, electron–hole pairs generated in bulk Si will be separated by the BEF at the interface. The electrons are transferred to the Si side and the holes are transferred towards the graphene side, as shown in Fig. 4c. For the Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure, quite a lot holes will be trapped in the WS2/Si potential well and the hole trap state in the WS2 film, which leads to noncharge-neutral of the junction, as shown in Fig. 4d. Generally speaking, the electron cannot flow from the metal side to the semiconductor side in a Schottky diode with an n-type semiconductor due to the large Schottky barrier. However, the Fermi level of graphene can shift upward under a negative bias voltage due to finite DOS, leading to a reduced Schottky barrier height. Thus, electrons can cycle in the circuit until the recombination/release of the trapped holes, leading to a photogain, similar to the case in a photoconductive detector. As the reverse bias increases, the barrier height will be further reduced and the BEF (q(φ + V) and q(φ + V − VWS2)) will be further increased, leading to more efficient separation of photocarriers with enhanced photocurrent. With the increase of the thickness of the WS2 film, the number of trap state increases, which increases the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, causing the increase of response time (Fig. 3b) with a high photogain and photoresponsivity (10.9 nm thick WS2) (Fig. 3a). On further increasing the interfacial layer thickness, a large portion of the incident light is absorbed by the WS2 layer, which leads to the reduction in photogenerated carriers in Si. Also, the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers is reduced due to reduced BEF. According to the above analysis, the Gr/WS2/Si heterostructure photodetector can combine the advantages of photovoltaic and photoconductive effects, exhibiting high performance.
In addition, the long-term stability is important for practical applications. In this regard, the long-term stability of the Gr/WS2/Si and Gr/Si heterostructure photodetectors were investigated. Fig. 5a shows the I–V properties before and after storing in a vacuum desiccator for 2 months. It is clear that both the dark current and photocurrent of the Gr/Si device reduce dramatically. The photocurrent of the Gr/Si photodetector drops down to 3.7% of the initial photocurrent after 2 months, as shown in Fig. 5b (black dots), and continues to reduce along with the storage time. The degradation can be attributed to the oxidation effect related to the Gr/Si interface junction or water molecule absorption in a low vacuum environment. In fact, Gr cannot fully protect the device and water and oxygen molecules can still penetrate into the Gr film.50 In contrast, the degradation of the performance of the Gr/WS2/Si photodetector is not as serious as that of the Gr/Si photodetector. The photocurrent only reduces to 87% of the initial value after 2 months of storage (Fig. 5b). The relatively good stability of the Gr/WS2/Si photodetector may arise from the protection of the Si-WS2 interface by the WS2 layer. However, we note that the performance still degrades sharply after 6 months, possibly owing to the degradation of the WS2 layer after a long storage time.51 Further optimization including surface passivation and reducing the break of transfer prepared graphene is needed to improve its stability in the future.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated high responsivity photodetectors based on a graphene–WS2–Si hybrid heterostructure. With the introduction of the WS2 film interface layer, higher photocurrent and more trap states were achieved, compared with the Gr/Si heterostructure photodetector. In addition, the photoresponsivity, specific detectivity, and response time are affected by the thickness of the interfacial layer, due to the changes in the Schottky barrier height, the number of trap states, and light transmittance. Thus, the Gr/WS2/Si device with a 10.9 nm WS2 film shows the highest photoresponsivity (8.96 × 104 A W−1 at 690 nm), high specific detectivity (8.86 × 1011 Jones) and a fast response speed of less than 0.84 ms. The photoresponsivity is quite high compared with the previous reports on Gr/Si-based and 2D materials/Si photodetectors. In addition, the Gr/WS2/Si device presents a broad spectral detection capability of 400–1800 nm with a responsivity of 0.735 A W−1 at 1550 nm, and better long-term stability and reproducibility.
Experimental section
Fabrication of the graphene/WS2/Si heterostructure photodetectors
The device fabrication process is schematically shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). A 500 μm-thick n-type Si with 285 nm thermally oxidized SiO2 was selected as the substrate. The substrate was first patterned using a standard UV-lithography technique and then etched by the reactive ion etching method, forming circular holes with a radius of 5 μm. Then, the substrate was buffered oxide etched for 1 minute to remove SiO2. Next, a series of WO3 films with different thicknesses were deposited on the substrates by the thermal evaporation method, which were sulfurized into WS2 in a high temperature tube furnace using sulfur powder as the sulfur source at a low pressure (120 Pa). After this, a ring shaped Ag electrode (inner diameter: 10 μm, outer diameter: 210 μm) was deposited by combining photolithography and thermal evaporation techniques. The electrode enclosed area contains both the WS2/SiO2/Si region and the WS2/Si junction region. The 200 μm width of the electrode can prevent photocurrent contribution from outside the electrode embraced area. Finally, monolayer graphene was transferred on the WS2 films, forming a graphene/WS2/Si heterostructure.
Characterization
The surface morphology of the devices were characterized using an optical microscope (Olympus, BX60) and the thicknesses of the WS2 films were characterized using an atomic force microscope (AFM, FM-Nanoview1000).
Electrical characterizations and photoresponse measurements
The electrical and photoresponse properties of the devices were determined with a Keithley 2636B as the source and measurement units in a home-made probe station system. All devices were tested at room temperature under an ambient atmosphere. A supercontinuum source with laser light (SC-PRO, YSL Photonics) and an acousto-optic monochromator (AOTF-PRO, YSL Photonics) was used as the light source for the measurements. The spot diameter of the light irradiated on the device was 8.5 mm. The light intensity was measured using a power meter (1935-C, Newport). For transient measurements, the incident light was modulated by a mechanical chopper (SR540, Stanford Research Systems). For the measurement of the response time, a resistor (0.2 MΩ) was connected with the device in series and the voltage variation of the resistor was measured using an oscilloscope (TDS 3054B, Tektronix) to track the fast variation of the voltage with time, which stands for the change of the photocurrent in the photodetector.
