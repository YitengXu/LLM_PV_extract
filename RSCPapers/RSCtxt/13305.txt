    , Accepted 9th January 2017First published on 11th January 2017AbstractUnderstanding the nature and dynamics of the photo-induced transients of all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) is key to their exploitation in potential applications. In order to determine the nature of charge carriers, their deactivation pathways and dynamics, the photo-induced transients of CsPbBr3, CsPbBr2I, CsPbBr1.5I1.5 and CsPbI3 NCs are spectrally and temporally characterized employing a combination of femtosecond transient absorption (TA) and photoluminescence (PL) up-conversion techniques and global analysis of the data. The results provide distinct identities of the excitons and free charge carriers and distinguish the hot charge carriers from the cold ones. The carrier trapping is attributed to the electrons and their dynamics is unaffected in mixed halide perovskites. The excitation energy dependence of the TA dynamics suggests that the trap states are shallow in nature and mainly limited near the band-edge level. In mixed halide perovskites, an increase in the iodine content leads to hole trapping in a short time scale (<5 ps). The insights obtained from this study are likely to be helpful for tuning the photo-response of these substances and their better utilization in light-based applications.
1. Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites (OMHP) have emerged as efficient light absorbers in low cost photovoltaic cells with a power-conversion efficiency >20% within a short period.1 All-inorganic cesium-based perovskites are being considered as alternatives to OMHPs because of their better thermal stability and equally impressive performance.2–5 Applications of colloidal CsPbX3 NCs as light-emitting diodes (LEDs)6,7 and an inexpensive lasing medium with a wide tuning range and a very low pump threshold are already demonstrated.8,9
Interestingly, though OMHPs17–22 have been relatively well studied, an in-depth study of the fundamental photo-induced processes in all-inorganic perovskite (CsPbX3) NCs, such as the pathways of charge carriers and their dynamics, which determine the efficiency of these substances in solar cells or as a lasing medium, is still lacking. The photophysical measurements involving CsPbBr3 are so far restricted to the study of charge transfer dynamics between CsPbBr3 NCs and electron/hole acceptors,10,11 estimation of the degeneracies of band-edge electron and hole states, and multi-exciton dynamics12 and measurement of the electron–hole diffusion length, and carrier mobility in CsPbBr3.13 A few single-molecule studies of the optical properties and photostability of CsPbX3 NCs have also been conducted.14–16 To the best of our knowledge, no detailed study on carrier trapping and dynamics in all-inorganic perovskite NCs, wherein the identity of the photo-generated species is clearly established, has so far been undertaken.
Considering the potential of CsPbX3 NCs in photo-voltaic applications and the importance of charge carrier dynamics in such applications, we embark upon this study to characterize all short-lived photo-induced transients of CsPbBr3, CsPbBr2I, CsPbBr1.5I1.5 and CsPbI3, and follow their dynamics employing femtosecond time-resolved TA and PL measurements as a function of excitation/emission energy. The results establish that the major photoexcited species in these NCs are the free charge carriers as the excitons dissociate within a short time. Up-converted PL dynamics reveal a hot PL of these NCs. TA and PL signals are found to carry information mainly relating to the electrons. In addition to electron trapping, rapid hole trapping in mixed halide perovskites is also observed.
2. Results and discussion
CsPbBr3, CsPbBr2I and CsPbBr1.5I1.5 and CsPbI3 NCs were synthesized following a reported procedure with minor modifications (details in the Experimental section).23 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirm the cubic shape of these NCs with a mean edge-length of 10–12 nm for CsPbBr3, CsPbBr2I and CsPbBr1.5I1.5. For CsPbI3, the edge length is estimated to be 15 ± 2 nm (Fig. 1 and S1, ESI†). The optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the NCs (Fig. 1) show a progressive red shift of the absorption and PL bands with an increase in the iodine content in agreement with the literature.12,23 The PL maximum appears at 509, 530, 570 and 690 nm for CsPbBr3, CsPbBr2I, CsPbBr1.5I1.5 and CsPbI3, respectively and the respective PL QYs are estimated as 51, 19, 16 and 62%.
 Fig. 1  (a) Absorption (black dashed line) and PL (red solid line) spectra (λex = 450 nm) of the perovskite NCs and (b) high-resolution TEM images of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs. Scale bar shown here is of 5 nm. 
The PL time profiles of these samples are best represented by a tri-exponential decay function. The PL dynamics of CsPbBr3 is found to be much faster (4 ns) compared to the iodide containing mixed halide NCs (7 and 17 ns for CsPbBr2I and CsPbBr1.5I1.5, respectively). The longest lifetime (56 ns) is observed for CsPbI3 NCs (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†). The fact that our NCs are less luminescent than those reported in a couple of cases10,23 and exhibit multi-exponential PL dynamics is perhaps a reflection of the presence of trap centres in our systems, as indicated in the recent literature.12,15 The absence of any new PL band suggests the absence of any deep trap states in these NCs.
2.1. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy

CsPbBr3: 350 nm excitation. 
The TA spectra of CsPbBr3 obtained on above-band-edge (350 nm) excitation are characterized by the following features: a broad absorption band (labelled PA1) in the 400–470 nm region, a 2-component bleach (ΔA < 0, where ΔA is the change in absorption) consisting of a peak at 505 nm and a shoulder around 480 nm (labelled respectively as PB1 and PB2) and a second absorption band (labelled PA2) in the 520–560 nm region (Fig. 2). PB2 recovers rapidly leading to a broadening of the spectral envelope of PA1. The formation of PB1 is represented by an ultrafast (<120 fs) and a relatively slower (∼700 fs) component, whereas PB2 and PA2 formation is characterized by the instrument limited rise time (≤120 fs).
 Fig. 2  Time-dependent evolution of the TA spectrum (λex = 350 nm) of CsPbBr3 NCs in the (a) short (0.05–0.4 ps), (b) medium (0.4–2 ps) and (c) long (10–2000 ps) time scales. Panel (d) compares the formation and decay kinetics of PB1 (505 nm) and PA1 (465 nm) bands. The inset to this panel compares the formation and decay dynamics of the PB1 (505 nm) and PA2 (525 nm) band, respectively, in a shorter time scale. As the negative PA2 signal at >1 ps is due to overwhelming contribution of PB1, we relied on global analysis of the data to estimate the decay component. The formation time of PB1 extracted from single wavelength kinetics is 645 ± 45 fs. Panel (e) shows the decay associated spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs. 
As the negative (bleach) signal is sandwiched between two positive absorption bands, a global analysis of the TA spectrum involving multiple wavelengths at the same time (instead of single wavelength kinetic analysis) is carried out to obtain the dynamics of the photoinduced events.24 This analysis yields three kinetic components (700 fs, 45 ps and 2000 ps), as evident from the decay-associated spectra (DAS) shown in panel (e) of Fig. 2. As can be seen, the 700 fs component is associated with PB2 and PA2, while the 45 and 2000 ps components are associated with both PA1 and PB1 bands.
We attribute PB1 to the ground state depopulation as its peak position matches with the first excitonic absorption peak of CsPbBr3.10,25,26 A small contribution of stimulated emission to this negative bleach signal however cannot be completely ruled out.27 As 350 nm excitation creates excitons much above the band-edge, the 700 fs rise of the PB1 signal can be due to the cooling of these hot excitons to the band-edge excitonic state (intra-band relaxation). This conclusion is corroborated by the acceleration of the formation dynamics with a decrease in excitation energy from above- to near-band-edge (panel c, Fig. 3) and also by the recent literature.18,25,26,28 For CH3NH3PbI3, the rise component was attributed to the dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers.17,18 However, in our case, as the exciton dissociation time-constant is reported to be ∼5–6 ps, the 700 fs rise must arise from state filling only. The ultrafast rise component of PB1, which could not be time-resolved, perhaps arises from the columbic interaction between the hot-excitons (produced by the above band-edge pump pulse) and cold-excitons (produced by the probe pulse), as indicated in the literature.12,26
 Fig. 3  Decay associated spectra (DAS) of CsPbBr3 NCs obtained on (a) near band-edge (480 nm) and (b) below band-gap (515 nm) excitation. The dip and discontinuity around 480 nm in DAS in panel (a) is due to the scattered pump laser. Panel (c) the formation kinetics of the PB1 band of CsPbBr3 NCs as a function of the excitation wavelength. 
We attribute the PA1 band to absorption arising from the lowest excitonic state as its formation time is identical to the intra-band relaxation time. We assign PB2 to hot-exciton induced bleach as its recovery dynamics (700 fs) matches the growth kinetics of PB1. PA2 is assigned to the absorption due to hot charge carriers (hot-exciton) as its decay time (700 fs) matches the formation time of PB1 and also, for its absence on near band-gap excitation (Fig. 3). The observation of two long-lived PB bands for OMHPs19 was explained earlier using two VBs with a common CB model. However, in the present case this possibility is ruled out due to the short lifetime of the PB2 band and its absence during near-gap excitation.


CsPbBr3: 480 and 515 nm excitations. 
The TA spectra of CsPbBr3 on 480 (near band-edge) and 515 (below band-edge) nm excitations are found to be less complex (Fig. S3, ESI†) as both PB2 and PA2 bands and 700 fs time-component in DAS are absent (Fig. 3). As 480 nm excitation creates excitons near the band-edge state, it is understandable why the signal due to hot-excitons (PB2 and PA2) disappears and also, why the formation of PB1 is instantaneous (∼140 fs) for these excitations.
The absorption tail of the semiconductor NCs is known to be due to localized energy states (shallow trap/defect sites) near the band-edge arising from the structural disorder or lattice defects.20,29 Considering that the first exciton peak of CsPbBr3 NCs appears at ∼505 nm, 515 nm excitation corresponds to an optical transition from the VB edge to the CB tail. As exciton generation probability is low for this excitation, but the PA1 and PB1 signals are still observable for all excitations, it is evident that these must be due to the free charge carriers.20 This is consistent with low exciton binding energy of CsPbBr3 NCs, which facilitates its dissociation into free charge carriers at room temperature (∼26 meV) and terahertz conductivity measurements.13,23
The 45 and 2000 ps components, which are associated with both PA1 and PB1, represent the decay time of charge carriers through trapping and recombination, respectively. Even though the effective mass of electrons and holes is very similar in CsPbBr3 NCs,23 Lian and co-workers showed that a major portion (67.2%) of this excitonic bleach signal is due to electrons owing to the higher degeneracy of the valence band (VB) compared to the conduction band (CB).10 Hence, the formation of excitonic bleach can be specifically assigned to the intraband cooling of hot electrons and the 45 ps component to electron trapping (vide later for confirmation) as these time scales are consistent with literature data on OMHPs.30,31 The possibility of the 45 ps component arising from Auger recombination is ruled out considering the very low pump fluence (2–4 μJ cm−2) used in our TA experiments. The absence of 45 ps electron trapping component on 515 nm excitation indicates that the charge carriers relax only through the recombination channel.32 This implies that the trap states do not lie below the conduction band-edge, but are placed within the band-edge, as reported in the case of PbS NCs.33


CsPbI3. 
For CsPbI3 NCs the TA spectral features (Fig. S4, ESI†) are similar to that observed for CsPbBr3. DAS for above band-gap (545 nm) excitation (Fig. 4) indicates that the lifetime of hot-excitons is 0.56 ps. The trapping and recombination time-constants estimated from DAS are 215 and >2000 ps, respectively. In a recent study, a time constant of 23 ps obtained from bleach recovery dynamics for CsPbI3 NCs was assigned to Auger recombination.34 However, this possibility is ruled out in our measurements due to the low excitation intensity. The PB1 recovery kinetics for different levels of (545, 575 and 635 nm) excitations (by maintaining nearly a similar number of excitons) show complete disappearance of trapping for 635 nm excitation and a decrease in trapping amplitude from 20 to 12% from 545 to 575 nm excitation (Table S2, ESI†). This clearly indicates a decrease in trapping density towards the band-edge level thus making carrier recombination the major process for the relaxation. This explains why the PL QY for CsPbI3 NCs is higher compared to the other NCs. The difference in the carrier trapping rate in CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs can be rationalised considering the locations of the trap states in two cases. As the trap states in CsPbI3 are positioned close to the higher excitonic states, whereas in the case of CsPbBr3, these are located near the band edge, the trapping rate is significantly slower in CsPbI3.
 Fig. 4  DAS of CsPbI3 NCs on (a) 545 nm and (b) 635 nm excitation. The inset in panel (a) shows the formation (160 ± 16 fs) and decay (540 ± 40 fs) dynamics of the hot-exciton band, as obtained from kinetic analysis of the data at 710 nm. The inset in panel (b) shows the inverse plot of TA amplitude at 685 nm with delay time for all the excitations. 
In order to determine whether the recovery of the PB1 signal is due to recombination of the excitons or free charge carriers, we have examined the dependence of the inverse of the TA signal amplitude on the delay time.35–37 As exciton–exciton annihilation is ruled out in our studies due to low excitation energy density, the observed linear dependence (insets, Fig. 4) suggests that PB1 recovery proceeds through bi-molecular free carrier recombination. This implies that excitons dissociate efficiently into free charge carriers due to low exciton binding energy (∼20 meV) for CsPbI3 NCs. The excitation energy dependence of the TA dynamics of the pure halide-based NCs allows us to conclude that trap states are mainly shallow in nature and no intra-gap or deep trap states are present. These shallow trap states possibly originate from the elemental vacancies, as found for OMHPs.38


Mixed-halide perovskites. 
Mixed-halide based perovskite NCs are more appealing in photovoltaic cells compared to the pure halide based one for their wider optical tunability.39,40 Following above-gap excitation mixed halide perovskites (CsPbBr2I and CsPbBr1.5I1.5) show spectral features and dynamical parameters very similar to those observed for CsPbBr3 NCs (Fig. 5, S5 and S6, ESI†) indicating that insertion of iodide hardly influences the signal due to electrons. In both cases, however, a red-shift of the PB1 band in the early time (<5 ps) is observed unlike in pure halide based (CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3) NCs. This can be understood as follows. As the CB and VB energy levels of CsPbX3 NCs are majorly sensitive to Pb and X, respectively, the VB is shifted to higher energies on replacement of Br by I.41–43 Thus when a mixed halide CsPbX3 NC is excited, holes created at the Br-site can move to the I-site (which acts as a hole trap) leading to a time-dependent red shift of PB1. A similar excitonic red-shift due to hole trapping is observed previously for CdS NCs.44
 Fig. 5  TA spectra at various time delays 1, 5, 50, 500 and 2000 ps for (a) CsPbBr2I at 350 and 500 (inset) nm and (b) CsPbBr1.5I1.5 at 350 and 530 (inset) nm excitations. 
However, a similar red shift of the PB1 band could not be observed for near gap excitation (insets of Fig. 5) of the mixed halide NCs as the VB for mixed halide NCs consists of 5P and 4P orbitals of iodine and bromine, respectively, and near gap excitation corresponds to an optical transition from the top of the VB (I-rich centres) to the bottom of the CB. As the holes are created at the I-rich sites, which are higher in energy compared to the Br-rich sites, hole trapping/migration is not energetically favorable. Unlike that in CsPbBr3, near gap excitation of mixed halide perovskites increases the electron trapping time component from 35–45 ps to 60–65 ps (Fig. S7, ESI†). This can be due to the difference in trap densities at the near band-edge and higher excitonic levels or due to direct carrier trapping from the higher excitonic levels during 350 nm excitation. It indeed requires further study to shed light on the distribution of trap states near the excitonic states for these all-inorganic perovskite NCs.

2.2. PL up-conversion spectroscopy
The PL transients of CsPbBr3 NCs show interesting wavelength dependent (470–550 nm) properties (panel a, Fig. 6). At lower emission wavelengths (<475 nm), the PL transients are characterized by a ∼300 fs component (major) and two other relatively long decay components (9–20 ps and 95–130 ps). However, for wavelengths >485 nm, a sub-picosecond rise component (∼450 fs) along with two other decay components (32–40 ps and 180–290 ps) is observed (Table S4, ESI†).
 Fig. 6  (a) Wavelength dependence of the PL dynamics (λex = 400 nm) of CsPbBr3 NCs and (b) change in PL decay profiles of CsPbBr3 NCs at 510 nm as a function of the concentrations of OV. 
As 400 nm (above band-edge) excitation generates hot charge carriers, the formation time of band-edge emission (∼509 nm) can be due to cooling of the electrons or the holes. However, as this time is very similar to the electron cooling time estimated from the TA measurements, we attribute the formation of PL to cooling of the hot electrons. The other two components (40 and 300 ps) are assigned to trapping and recombination, respectively. Even though a much lower excitation fluence (0.016 μJ cm−2) has been used in PL up-conversion measurement, but the 40–50 ps component is still observed, it reinforces our earlier assignment of this component arising from carrier trapping rather than through an Auger assisted recombination process. The PL dynamics at <485 nm, which are characterized by a ∼300–450 fs decay component, is attributed to hot PL considering that recombination of non-thermalized charge carriers occurs in a similar time scale for OMHPs.30,45 Normalized time-dependent PL spectra do show transformation of the higher band-gap PL due to hot excitonic recombination to band-edge PL as a result of the recombination of the thermalized charge carriers (Fig. S8, ESI†). A similar PL dynamics in two other NCs, CsPbBr2I and CsPbBr1.5I1.5 (Fig. S9 and Tables S6 and S7, ESI†), supports our conclusion that the dynamics of electrons is not affected by the increase in the iodide content.
That the carrier being trapped is indeed the electrons is further substantiated by PL quenching of CsPbBr3 NCs and reduction of the PL lifetime (Fig. S10 and S11 and Table S3, ESI†) in the presence of an electron acceptor, 1,1′-dioctyl viologen (OV). A faster PL decay dynamics in the presence of the OV (panel b, Fig. 6) with an unchanged zero-time PL signal amplitude and formation dynamics (even for the highest concentration of OV) indicates that only PL due to the cold charge carriers (not the hot PL) is quenched by OV (Table S5, ESI†). The electron transfer time is estimated46 to be 6–7 ps from the reduction in the lifetime of the 40 ps trapping component. A similar electron transfer time between perovskite NCs and adsorbed molecular acceptors has recently been reported.10,47 The complete picture obtained from this study on the basis of the above discussion can be best represented by Scheme 1. The study indicates that the trap states in these NCs are shallow and the charge-carriers are easily transferable to an acceptor. CsPbI3 appears to be a better candidate for optoelectronic applications due to its low trap density and long radiative lifetime.

3. Conclusions
In short, a detailed picture of the identity of various charge carriers and their dynamics in CsPbX3 NCs is obtained by ultrafast TA and PL measurements. Spectral signatures of the hot-excitons and free charge carriers are obtained and the kinetic components due to hot carrier cooling, carrier trapping and the recombination process are distinguished by decay associated spectra. Carrier trapping is attributed to the electrons and it is observed that an increase in the iodide content in these NCs does not influence the electron trapping, but generates additional hole trapping centres. We expect the insights obtained from this work on carrier trapping and dynamics of these NCs will be helpful for better utilization of these substances in photo-induced applications.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Chemicals used
Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99%) and lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.9%) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Oleyl amine (OAm, 80–90%), oleic acid (OA, 90%) and 1-octadecene (ODE) were purchased from Aldrich. Lead iodide (PbI2, 99%) and toluene were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Merck, respectively. 1,1′-Dioctyl viologen (OV) was purchased from TCI Chemicals and used as received. OAm and OA were dried under vacuum for 1 h prior to their use. ODE, a non-interacting solvent, was used here for the synthesis of perovskite NCs. Toluene was dried prior its use for the optical studies.
4.2. Synthesis of all-inorganic perovskite NCs
CsPbX3 with different compositions were synthesized following a hot-injection method reported by Kovalenko et al.23 In brief, Cs2CO3 (0.133 g) was loaded into a double-neck round-bottom flask (RB) containing 5 mL of ODE and 0.42 mL of oleic acid. The mixture was kept in a vacuum at 120 °C for 1 hour and then heated under N2 until all Cs2CO3 reacted with OA to form cesium-oleate. During the synthesis of NCs, cesium-oleate was kept at 120 °C to avoid precipitation.
0.069 g of PbBr2 for CsPbBr3, a mixture of 0.046 g PbBr2 and 0.028 g PbI2 for CsPbBr2I, and a mixture of 0.034 g PbBr2 and 0.042 g PbI2 for CsPbBr1.5I1.5 and 0.084 g for CsPbI3 were loaded into a double-neck RB containing 5 mL of ODE and kept in a vacuum for 1 hour at 120 °C. Dried OAm and OA (0.5 mL of each) were added into the mixture at 120 °C to dissolve the lead-salt. The temperature of the reaction mixture was raised to 170 °C and 0.4 mL of cesium-oleate was injected onto it. Immediately after injection, the reaction mixture was cooled using an ice water bath to get the desired nanocrystals. The final composition of the as-synthesized mixed halide NCs was estimated based on the reactant ratio used. The optical properties of the NCs are found to be consistent with the literature.49 Energy dispersive X-ray analysis suggests the actual composition of the mixed halide NCs, CsPbBr2I and CsPbBr1.5I1.5 as CsPbBr2.1I0.9 and CsPbBr1.7I1.3, respectively. As CsPbI3 recrystallizes into the yellow non-luminescent orthorhombic phase upon storage for a few days, all optical measurements were performed with fresh samples.
4.3. Characterization
Synthesized NCs were centrifuged to remove ODE and finally dissolved in toluene. All the optical measurements were performed at room temperature (25 °C) in toluene medium. OV was dissolved in toluene via ultra-sonication due to its poor solubility, and the supernatant liquid was used for all the optical measurements and the residue was discarded. All optical measurements were carried out employing a colloidal solution (in toluene) of the NCs. Details of transmission electron microscopy, and femtosecond transient absorption and emission techniques have been discussed in the ESI.†

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Absorption (black dashed line) and PL (red solid line) spectra (λex = 450 nm) of the perovskite NCs and (b) high-resolution TEM images of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 NCs. Scale bar shown here is of 5 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  Time-dependent evolution of the TA spectrum (λex = 350 nm) of CsPbBr3 NCs in the (a) short (0.05–0.4 ps), (b) medium (0.4–2 ps) and (c) long (10–2000 ps) time scales. Panel (d) compares the formation and decay kinetics of PB1 (505 nm) and PA1 (465 nm) bands. The inset to this panel compares the formation and decay dynamics of the PB1 (505 nm) and PA2 (525 nm) band, respectively, in a shorter time scale. As the negative PA2 signal at >1 ps is due to overwhelming contribution of PB1, we relied on global analysis of the data to estimate the decay component. The formation time of PB1 extracted from single wavelength kinetics is 645 ± 45 fs. Panel (e) shows the decay associated spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs.	 

 	Fig. 3  Decay associated spectra (DAS) of CsPbBr3 NCs obtained on (a) near band-edge (480 nm) and (b) below band-gap (515 nm) excitation. The dip and discontinuity around 480 nm in DAS in panel (a) is due to the scattered pump laser. Panel (c) the formation kinetics of the PB1 band of CsPbBr3 NCs as a function of the excitation wavelength.	 

 	Fig. 4  DAS of CsPbI3 NCs on (a) 545 nm and (b) 635 nm excitation. The inset in panel (a) shows the formation (160 ± 16 fs) and decay (540 ± 40 fs) dynamics of the hot-exciton band, as obtained from kinetic analysis of the data at 710 nm. The inset in panel (b) shows the inverse plot of TA amplitude at 685 nm with delay time for all the excitations.	 

 	Fig. 5  TA spectra at various time delays 1, 5, 50, 500 and 2000 ps for (a) CsPbBr2I at 350 and 500 (inset) nm and (b) CsPbBr1.5I1.5 at 350 and 530 (inset) nm excitations.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Wavelength dependence of the PL dynamics (λex = 400 nm) of CsPbBr3 NCs and (b) change in PL decay profiles of CsPbBr3 NCs at 510 nm as a function of the concentrations of OV.	 

 	Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the formation and relaxation of charge carriers, where X1 and Xn represent, respectively, the lowest and excited electron states in the CB.48 Dotted lines represent the absorption due to hot exciton from Xn (PA2) and free charge carriers from X1 (PA1) states. Dashed lines represent PL due to the recombination processes. τ5 represents the lifetime of the hot PL (420 fs for CsPbBr3).
