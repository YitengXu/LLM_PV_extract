    , Accepted 23rd September 2022First published on 27th September 2022AbstractThe world of semiconductors has drastically improved human lifestyle due to its versatile applications. The demand for new efficient semiconductors is increasing day by day, giving birth to the idea of new synthesis methods. Here, the importance of semiconductor eutectic materials has been presented, as one of the potential candidates for solar-based devices such as photo-anodes for water splitting, along with the micro (μ) pulling method (as a synthesis method for semiconductor eutectic materials). A comparison of the efficiency of the present devices with the eutectic composites has been made, showing semiconductor eutectic materials as a better alternative. In addition, possible changes that can be achieved using the μ-pulling method to enhance the photo(electro)chemical (PEC) properties have focused on semiconducting eutectic materials in this article.
1 Introduction
A catalyst is principally a substance or reagent which improves the chemical reaction rate without being consumed or permanently changing itself and this phenomenon of altering the reaction rate is known as catalysis.1–5 A catalyst speeds up a reaction with gentle temperature changes so that useful reaction rates and better yield of desired products are easily achieved. Essentially, a catalyst creates an alternate reaction route, which has lower activation energy and now more molecules have the energy to react successfully compared to those in the uncatalysed reaction.1,5–7 When a catalyst alters the rate of a chemical reaction on exposure to light or photons, it is called a photocatalyst and the phenomenon is termed photocatalysis.8–12 It is a charge related phenomenon that involves changes at the molecular level.
Considering the electronic structure of solids, in the molecular orbital theory, when several atoms react, the combination of the atomic orbitals gives rise to bonding and antibonding levels. Consequently, the energy levels of the atomic orbitals can be described as the energy bands at the molecular level. The bonding energy levels form a valence band (VB) or highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO and the antibonding levels form the conduction band (CB) or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO. Now, the difference in energy between the VB and CB is known as the bandgap of the material (Eg) with metals having the zero-eV band gap and insulators having the highest Eg, greater than 5.0 eV. Semiconductors have Eg in a range between 1 eV and 5 eV. At low temperatures, all the electrons are in the VB, whereas the CB is effectively empty. When a photon or any other external source of energy strikes the semiconductor material, an excited electron from the VB moves to the CB, generating a hole in the VB.8,13 Semiconductors work best as photocatalysts since they are able to conduct electricity in the presence of light even at room temperature. Every photocatalyst is essentially a semiconductor and consequently, in photocatalysis, the semiconductor material generates an electron hole pair on exposure to light.8 These excited electrons are used to reduce the acceptor, whereas the holes are used for the oxidation of the donor molecule. The importance of photocatalysis is due to the fact that photocatalysts provide both oxidative and reducing environments. The materials involved in these reactions cover a wide range of applications due to their adjustable bandgaps, suitable band edge positions, exceptional chemical stability, ease of synthesis, low cost and a broad range of bandgaps.14,15
One of the applications of the photocatalysts in green energy production is water splitting. In photocatalytic water splitting, the energy of solar radiation is used directly to dissociate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Three types of hydrogen producing systems (Fig. 1) that are used to achieve water splitting are:13,16–20 particulate photocatalysis (PC) systems, photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems, and photovoltaic-photoelectrochemical (PV–PEC) systems.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of different types of solar water splitting systems: (a) particulate photocatalysis (PC) systems, (b) photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems, and (c) photovoltaic–photoelectrochemical (PV–PEC) systems. 
The idea of photocatalytic water splitting was pioneered by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, when they produced hydrogen by PEC water splitting with the photocatalyst TiO2 (anode) and a platinum (cathode).21 Subsequently, metal oxides have been extensively studied for use as semiconductors for photoelectrodes. Semiconductor-based photocatalysts perform water splitting in the following three steps.13,19–22 The surface of the semiconductor absorbs light with greater energy than the semiconductor Eg energy. This leads to excitation of electrons in the VB to the CB, creating excited electrons and holes inside the semiconductor. These photogenerated electron–hole pairs are divided in the bandgap and some accumulate to the anode surface where catalytic oxidation of water occurs and oxygen is generated. In the second reaction, catalytic reduction of water occurs when the photogenerated electrons transport to and reduce the protons on the cathode surface.15 The principle of photocatalytic water-splitting is shown in Fig. 2. Two half reduction and oxidation processes occur on the surface of the semiconductors via the following reactions:13,19,20  
 Fig. 2  The energy diagram of the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. 
From the reaction equations, one can see that 1.23 eV is the minimum energy input needed for water splitting, so theoretically a photocatalyst with a bandgap larger than 1.23 eV should be required for water splitting.23 Consequently, a semiconductor material with a bandgap greater than 1.23 eV will have the band edges to contain the redox potential of water.17,18 In practice, the photon energy used should be more than this theoretical value as there can be different energy losses like energy loss at wire- or electrode-connecting points. Selecting the appropriate semiconductor material for light absorption to drive spontaneous solar water splitting is of primary importance for PEC studies.15 Several examples of such semiconducting materials are highlighted below.
1.1 Metal oxides
Initially, many studies were centred around wide-bandgap oxides, like TiO2 (Eg = 3.2 eV), ZnO (Eg = 3.3 eV) and SrTiO3 (Eg = 3.2 eV), due to their band edge positions perfectly surrounding water redox potential.21,24–26 The challenge here is that for a wider bandgap, light in the ultraviolet region is absorbed, which is less than 5% of the solar energy spectrum. This can be overcome through doping, and light absorption can be extended into the visible region. As an example, the TiO2 photoelectrode was only limited in the UV range due to the wide bandgap (3.2 eV) after its first discovery.21
Later on, many approaches were proposed to solve this issue and made TiO2 applicable in the visible region by manipulating the bandgap.27–30 All these approaches focus on doping by different elements/ions to influence the bandgap. In one approach, researchers narrowed the bandgap of TiO2 by doping it with elements like N, C, B, etc.31,32 Another challenge is the inherent limitations of these materials, like large hole diffusion length.33–38 This issue can be addressed with the use of low dimensional materials that have short diffusion pathways and vast surface area. For instance, lots of metal oxide nanostructures have been synthesised with zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) structures.39–42 As compared to metal oxides, these nanostructured metal oxides have shown better performance in PEC systems.43 In fact, this is an advantage of a few layer 2D structures, which provide faster charge transfer schemes with highly exposed active sites.44
In addition to the change in dimensionality, doping has also been utilized to introduce charge traps that can reduce the recombination rate. For example, overall good conductivity was achieved by doping TiO2 with rare earth elements, which caused shallow traps and increased the overall light absorption.45–47 Also, a lot of phenomena related to doping like redox reactions have also been revealed, but the effect of N doping is still under debate.27 On the other hand, the doped precious and photo-active metals and their related compounds offer the added compensation of higher light absorption capacity and lower bandgap energy.48,49
Other oxides which are of great interest include Fe2O3, BiVO4 and many more as shown in Fig. 3.50–57 Fe2O3 (hematite, Eg = 2.1 eV) is one of the metal oxides that has shown promising performance in recent years.58–62 Its bandgap is perfectly matching with the region for harvesting visible light materials, has quite good photo corrosive stability, ease of availability, and feasible economical production.50–52,63,64 However, without any modifications via doping, co-catalysts, and nanostructuring, hematite has severe limitations for photocatalytic applications like poor surface water oxidation kinetics, short hole diffusion length, low absorption coefficient, and short carriers’ lifetime.53,54,65 The majority of the studies on Fe2O3 have focused on a single specific aspect of these modifications, and the overall performance of the material remains relatively low. BiVO4 (Eg = 2.4 eV) is another widely studied semiconductor that has generated interest due to negative band edge positions, allowing less than 1 V photovoltage.55–57,66,67 Compared to TiO2, BiVO4 absorbs remarkably greater light.68 Unmodified BiVO4, in contrast to hematite, has a better hole diffusion length.69 However, there are two drawbacks with BiVO4. One is the low charge carrier mobility (0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the other is the charge transfer across the BiVO4/H2 O interface. Even though low charge carrier limitations can be overcome by doping, plenty of charge carriers cannot be utilized efficiently due to the recombination at the near-surface region.70

1.2 Nitride and chalcogenides
The possibilities for solar water splitting can be found in materials like metal oxynitrides, nitrides and even chalcogenide semiconductors (see Fig. 3 for some possible examples).71,72 When the O atom is replaced with N or S, due to comparably low electro-negativity, the VB made up of N or S-2p orbitals will move up, whereas the CB containing the metal atomic orbital remains unchanged and the Eg will decrease considerably (Fig. 4).73,74 Chalcogenides have emerged as promising candidates for photoelectrochemical systems, many have already found use in heterojunction solar cells, like CdSe, CuIn–GaSe2.75,76 GeSe is a good example of this category which is usually assumed as a van der Waals (vdW) semiconductor. The formation of a thin oxide on the GeSe surface plays a critical role in the physicochemical mechanisms ruling photoelectrocatalysis. The underlying vdW semiconductor supplies electron–hole pairs, while the terminated GeO layer provides active sites for catalytic reactions.77 However, the disadvantage of chalcogenides for practical use is that they are thermodynamically unstable, i.e. easily oxidized by the photogenerated holes.78

1.3 Other potential materials
Among the materials exhibiting excellent optoelectronic characteristics in solar cells are conductive organic polymers and perovskite minerals. For example, perovskites can absorb up to 900 nm wavelength light and have a charge diffusion length of nearly 1000 nm, which is why solar cells using perovskites have reportedly a conversion efficiency as much as 22.7%.78–80 The main reason of their good properties is the formation of heterojunctions that provide a large absorption option.81–83 Unfortunately, the instability of perovskites in the presence of water makes them hard to study for photoelectrochemical water splitting.
A further example is organic–inorganic composite systems that can be made using conductive polymers like PEDOT and P3HT, since their band structures are in an appropriate range to combine with some semiconductor materials.84,85 The obvious challenge here is to couple the correct organic polymer and inorganic semiconductor such that the most efficient charge transfer can occur. In addition to the aforementioned oxides, a new family of photoanodes has recently emerged in the form of semiconductor eutectic materials that is explained with its synthesis method in the following subsection.
1.4 Eutectics
A semiconductor eutectic composite (Fig. 5) is a monolithic material containing two or more separate phases. These phases emerge in a solid form, from a mixed composition melt upon cooling. The fixed composition and the melting fixed temperature are called eutectic composition and eutectic temperature, respectively. Previously, they were mainly studied for many applications, like building materials, instead of energy generation due to their beneficial mechanical properties and high corrosion resistance.86–88 Recently, these composite oxides have also been the center of research as a photoanode material for PEC systems.89

Potentially, eutectic materials offer distinct advantages for use in solar energy conversion.88,90–92 Some of the properties that make the eutectic composites more appealing for photoanode applications are: (1) highly ordered structure of the constituent phases minimizes charge recombination losses enhancing the charge transport;93 (2) clear edges of the two phases may increase electrical contact within the materials compared to nanostructured materials;94 (3) eutectic systems can be made using a huge variety of materials, which makes it easy to control the harvesting range of light wavelength;86,95–98 (4) the eutectic material has lower melting temperatures compared to component materials as shown in Fig. 6 for the case of the SrTiO3–TiO2 eutectic. Eutectic materials are highly tuneable via the changing atmosphere of growth and annealing process, selective etching and deposition of different functional materials, etc.
 Fig. 6  Phase diagram of the SrTiO3–TiO2 eutectic material. 
The properties of eutectics emerge from their special growth method that is known as the μ-pulling method. The root of this method goes back to the famous conventional growth techniques of single crystals like Czochralski or Bridgman growth methods where materials are made from the melt.99 The importance of this method lies in the concept of phase transition (an effective way to understand the conversion of mass during materials’ growth). As an example, crystallization is a process in which phase transition occurs either from the gas or liquid state to crystalline state, giving rise to short-range and long-range ordered arrangements from disordered arrangement. As a result, the crystal components go through the transition forming the crystalline materials. Since crystallization includes the nucleation and crystal growth process, it gives the opportunity to control the growth parameters during phase transition in the μ-pulling method that can give direct control over the physical properties of the grown material.100 Initially, such systems were used to produce high crystalline single crystals.101 Later on, different solutions were proposed to increase the efficiency of these systems, which led to modification of systems resulting in the μ-pulling method. This method is an economical and time saving method based on the Stepanov method proposed by Ohnishi in which a crucible plays a crucial role. A crucible is a die which holds the melt whose size and shape determine the shape (rods, fibers, plate and tube) of the resultant product.102–104 Other than the crucible, ambient pressure, temperature gradient, seed crystal and pulling rate are the important parameters during the growth of a material from the melt. The crystals of different diameters can be obtained from this method in the range of μm–cm.103–105Fig. 7 shows the schematic of the μ-pulling method along with different examples of SEM micrographs obtained for different eutectic compounds grown by the μ-pulling method.

In this perspective review, we put specific focus on recent advancements in inorganic–inorganic eutectic materials, specifically TiO2-based eutectics and focus on 5 main aspects affecting these materials like temperature, bandgap, structure, light source, and pH. Different methods of synthesis of photoanodes over the years are compared with the μ-pulling method and materials that show promise as photoanodes like semiconducting eutectic materials are discussed.
2 Factors
It is well studied that during the reactions, the efficiency of semiconductor photocatalysts can be controlled by modifying several parameters like pH, temperature, light intensity, bandgap, etc. These factors play a crucial role in the efficiency of solar energy conversion devices and directly affect the PEC properties. In this section, we highlight and briefly discuss how these factors have been controlled in the literature. In addition, opportunities offered by the μ-pulling method to control some of these factors in eutectics are mentioned and detail discussions are made in Section 3.
2.1 Temperature
Temperature does not directly influence photocatalytic activity, as it does not affect the formation of electrons and holes first hand. But it is well known that an increase in temperature speeds up the reaction rate. In the case of photocatalysis, this is achieved by affecting product desorption from the catalyst surface. The temperature affects how the product can efficiently desorb from the surface of the catalyst and this can be understood in both low and high-temperature regions. In a low-temperature regime, the overall vibration of charges starts to decrease due to which energy transfer also gets limited, which in turn, limits desorption. On the other hand, higher temperature contributes to electron transfer to higher energy levels within the valence band. Consequently, it facilitates the formation of electrons and holes, which can be used to initiate redox reactions and rival charge carrier recombination.106,107 In conclusion, this factor can be easily altered to change the photocatalytic activity, keeping in mind that distinct catalysts will have distinct operating temperatures.107–110 Temperature also controls the crystallinity of a material during the synthesis and determines how good the flow of electrons will be in the synthesized crystal. In the μ-pulling method, during the crystal growth of eutectics, the temperature gradient can control the viscosity of the melt.100,111
2.2 Bandgap
It is critical to consider the CB and VB level with respect to H2O redox potential, and that the bandgap of the semiconductor is in the appropriate wavelength range to absorb photons for the generation of electron hole pairs. In Fig. 3, a list of semiconducting materials is shown, the top half shows materials suited for H2 production, while the bottom half of the materials are unsuitable. In the top half of the figure, the semiconductors have VB edges lower than the O2/H2 oxidation potential. Thus, in most cases, there is no need for a co-catalyst. Some materials, (bottom half of Fig. 3) have a bandgap that falls in the visible light region of the solar spectrum but the CB and/or VB band levels are unfit compared to the H2 redox potential, making these materials unsuitable for use, e.g. WO3, ZnO, Cu2O have lower CB potential than what is thermodynamically required.112,113 To solve this issue, band gap engineering is being used so that a large variety of materials can be used for water splitting.114 It works very well with the μ-pulling method since it gives the option to blend the matrices of two or more materials into each other providing opportunity for bandgap manipulation.86,96,115,116
2.3 Structure and morphology
Generally, the method and conditions of synthesis of the material determine the morphology of the photocatalyst. The structure of the catalyst affects photocatalytic activity considerably. In the case of nanoparticles, increased photocatalytic activity is observed with a larger surface area since there are comparably more active sites.117 On the other hand, for small particle sizes, photogenerated electron hole pairs have more probability to move to reaction sites on the surface of the catalyst rather than recombining.118 Normally, different surfactants, temperature, synthesis technique and pH contribute to influence the manner of crystal growth and affect the size and shape of the crystal formed.119 To control the surface, in the μ-pulling method, pulling rate (the rate at which pulling of the seed crystal is carried out) and the crucible play an important role. They can control the size, shape, surface and even precipitation up to the bulk.95,104,105,120–122 On the other hand, interfaces found at the junction of the two materials also display remarkable properties.123,124 These interface-based heterojunctions have also been utilized for solar energy devices where interfaces are main places of charge-transfer.81,125 Such interfaces can be made using the μ-pulling method that can be visible up to the surface and provides profound control of the active sites of heterojunctions at the surface leading to further modulation of PEC properties.
2.4 Light source
Solar irradiance is also an important parameter that can affect the overall efficiency in photocatalytic water splitting systems and is usually measured in suns or Watts per square meter (W m−2).126 In general, concentrated light systems having energies more than the activation threshold have proven to be the cause of an increase in PEC efficiency.107 They are directly related to the performance of the photocatalyst. In general, to simulate the sun in a lab, sources like xenon (Xe) lamps, mercury (Hg) lamps, and light-emitting diode (LED) lights are being used. The spectral range and light intensity vary greatly and depend on the source. Since each source has its own incident photon flux, it can lead to different PEC performances even for the same photocatalyst.127 Moreover, photocatalytic reactions can be divided into two regimes based on their fluxes. The first order regime (≈25 mW cm−2) is based on laboratory research, where chemical reactions are much faster and more dominant than recombination reactions. On the other hand, the half-order regime is for higher intensities in which electron–hole pairs are mainly consumed in recombination reactions instead of the chemical reactions, causing small effects on the rate of reaction. Many pieces of research have revealed the betterment in photocatalytic activity based on fluxes.128,129 They include improvement in photoactivity upon photocatalytic hydrogen production using ZnS and Cd0.4Zn0.6 S after increasing the light intensity. However, there are studies showing that the solar irradiance of up to 52 suns does not saturate the photocatalyst.130 It makes high-intensity solar water splitting a feasible proposition. However, it still has remained a challenge for researchers to understand the mechanisms which affect the relationship between the light intensity and photocatalytic water splitting.
2.5 pH
The environment in which all the photocatalytic properties are measured cannot be ignored and is of great importance. Researchers have studied the effect of different electrolytes on PEC performance which mainly comes from the difference in pH.89,131,132 In chemistry, pH stands for “potential of hydrogen” which helps to label and understand the behavior of electrolytes. The solutions can be divided into acidic (pH < 7) and basic (pH > 7) on the basis of pH. Many kinds of research have been made on different pH solutions, resulting in weak basic solutions as the best environment to enhance H2 evolution in water splitting.133–137 Thus, properties like H+ production and bandgap shifts can be attenuated by selecting a proper pH environment.132
3 Possible eutectic materials for photocatalysis and photoelectrochemistry applications
In this section, materials are illustrated with examples both theoretically and experimentally with different synthesis procedures and a possible extension of betterment in PEC properties by the micro (μ) pulling method. Eutectics made by the μ-pulling method have not been researched in detail in the literature, in particular, for water splitting. The purpose of this perspective is to point out the research of new eutectics in the field of photo(electro)chemistry by comparing the existing few successful attempts of eutectics made by the μ-pulling method with the similar materials synthesized by other methods and proposing some new insights that can open doors to further improvements in the existing research studies.
Many proposed different approaches have been used to achieve photoanodes or highly active photocatalytic materials as previously discussed in Section 1. Other than that, after the discovery in 2011 of black TiO2 having a bandgap of only 1.5 eV, different high pressure and high-temperature synthesis methods were discovered that lead to the increased photocatalytic activity of TiO2.138,139 Many morphological changes were also made in the growth of TiO2, which have already been discussed previously in the section Factors. In addition, the structure of TiO2 is of great significance, as it is found to have three structures/phases in nature named rutile, anatase, and brookite. Each phase has its merits and demerits on application basis. Rutile and anatase structures are extremely important for solar energy conversion applications. It has been found that anatase TiO2 shows a much slower recombination rate as compared to rutile and is a better option for photo-electrodes.140 Since different phases are under discussion, it is important to discuss the phase change materials which cover a vast range of applications from metallurgy to green energy.141
One of these materials caused an uproar in the field of photo-electrochemistry in 2017, when it was mixed with TiO2.86 These phase change materials are called eutectic composites. They are subdivided into three categories based on the combination: organic–organic, organic–inorganic, inorganic–inorganic. Our focus is only on the emerging eutectic composites for photo-electrodes which come under the inorganic–inorganic category. Inorganic–inorganic eutectics are of great importance due to their demand in industry, particularly as engineering materials. They can be made in the form of alloys and their properties can be changed by using different composition schemes. They are of great interest because of their stability, corrosion resistance, and many other exciting properties. Previously, researchers used these eutectic materials for high temperature, thermo-electrical, and many other applications.142 Earlier (see Section 1) presented ideas of bandgap engineering can also be applied to the eutectic composites since they are a combination of one or more different materials. Some of the potential materials for photo(electro)chemical applications are shown in Fig. 3, which can be used in combination as eutectic composites for bandgap modulation. For example, in 2017, for the first time these eutectic materials were fabricated with the help of TiO2 for solar energy conversion. The idea was the same (to manipulate the bandgap), but instead of doping, this research group tried to make an eutectic composite of TiO2 with SrTiO3 (which has a larger bandgap than TiO2). They successfully fabricated a photo-anode using this scheme and opened a new dimension of research that is not limited to TiO2.86 Researchers have made successful attempts to synthesize photo-anodes by using these eutectics.86,89
Among the available synthesis techniques, the sol–gel method is one of the most widely used methods to synthesize materials for photoanodes. In particular, TiO2-based photoanodes with a variety of dopants have been successfully prepared using this approach.143 For instance, the sol–gel method was used to synthesize Ce-doped TiO2 nano-composites. It was reported that the formation of impurity-induced energy levels extends the absorption spectrum.144 Likewise, the sol–gel method was also used by Choi et al.145 to study the effect of doping of numerous metal ions in TiO2. Their results showed the dopant-based phase transformation in TiO2 along with enhancement in photophysical activity. Their findings are of great interest, but this method can cause cracks during the dying phase and can limit the properties. Likewise, dopant-based phase transformation has also been observed in eutectics made by the μ-pulling method.86,89 Moreover, Pawlak et al. achieved selective etching with the control of microrods of TbScO3 perovskites in the garnet matrix of Tb3Sc2Al3O12–TbScO3, eutectic crystals, that shows a variety of options and advantages over the sol–gel method.104 Other than the sol–gel method, techniques like the one-pot method, the ion adoption templating method, hydrothermal treatment, the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique, and many more have contributed and have produced remarkable results in the development of photoanodes in recent years.32,47,146–149 Researchers achieved good photocatalytic activity due to photo-generated charge separation at TiO2/SnO2, by ion adoption and templating methods that had small grain size and good crystalline compatibility.150
It is important to find techniques that are safer such as the μ pulling method. It is possible to control stresses in the μ pulling method, which makes it more appealing for wide opportunities for doping with stress control. Pawlak et al.151 explained how the length of diffusion can be controlled by varying the rate of the μ pulling method. Their results emphasize the importance of interfaces in photocatalysis, which is achievable by the μ pulling method. Sharp interfaces can be accomplished with controllable grain size in bulk form. As an example, Orlinski et al.152 aimed for the MgO–MgAl2O4 eutectic using the μ pulling method and used the MgAl2O4 seed crystal. They effectively attained these eutectics having sharp interfaces and controlled the structure size by varying the μ pulling rate as depicted in Fig. 8.

Increasing the pulling rate refines the structure. Data are reproduced from ref. 152 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2019. 
In the same way, Hachiya et al.47 fabricated V-ion-doped TiO2 thin films on Nb-doped TiO2 substrates using the PLD technique. They described the physics based on low- and high-doping V regimes. Low-doped V samples were found to have V ions as recombination centers, while in highly doped samples, the TiO2 surface was found to play a major role. These results indicate the importance of both surface and doped sites. It is possible to achieve uniformly doped bulk TiO2 with V-doped samples using the μ pulling method which can provide details of doping sites of V and TiO2 at the surface simultaneously. Also, the predicted better gap states can be achieved in V–TiO2 eutectic composites and can enhance PEC properties. As an example, the μ-pulling method has proven to be a simple and fast synthesis technique for the three-dimensional bulk plasmonic with control over the size, shape and chemical composition. Also, resonance at visible and infrared wavelengths in plasmonic nanocomposites by doping has been achieved using the μ-pulling method that makes this method as one of the intriguing methods to grow PEC materials.153,154
In parallel, theoretical approaches using the density functional theory calculations were also made to understand the effect of dopants in TiO2 photoanodes and to find the best candidate among all dopants.155,156 Their findings pointed out iodine as the best dopant due to its incorporation at Ti sites in the TiO2 lattice and found better PEC efficiency than the undoped TiO2. Also, their results concluded nitrogen as the minimum efficient dopant among the chosen list due to its p-type nature.29 The nature of its incorporation in the lattice can change the efficiency of the photoanode. Thus, the μ pulling method stretches the options with easy control of more than one dopant simultaneously, which can result in the enhancement of PEC properties.
Furthermore, oxygen vacancies play an important role in the efficiency of photoanodes, which has been studied in many kinds of research.146 An increase in efficiency of TiO2 electrodes in energy storage application using the one-pot method and the subsequent nitridation treatment was studied by Wang et al.32 Their approach showed the effect of oxygen vacancies on the performance of electrodes. Similar results were found for MCPp-TiO2 (M(II) = Cu, Co, Zn, and CPp = carboxyl porphyrins) composite photocatalysts made under the one-pot solvothermal condition. In addition, the anatase phase was found to play a crucial role as the active phase of TiO2, and all composites showed good photolytic activity and stability.46 The only drawback of the one-pot solvothermal technique is the manual precipitation and then using those precipitates to form the composite. However, eutectic composites are a better option for this, where one can control the size of precipitates directly by controlling the speed in the μ pulling method as in Fig. 6 and 7. Therefore, if such ceramics are made in the form of eutectic composites, they can offer better results due to the uniform precipitation and sharp interfaces throughout the material. Research studies are not only limited to the surface defects but also defects in the bulk have been reported as a cause for better PEC properties. Niu et al. used topotactic transition of the titanium oxalate decahedron in an argon atmosphere to produce carbon-modified polycrystalline anatase TiO2 decahedral plates.31 They aimed and successfully achieved the formation of Ti–C in the interior of plates which enabled them to operate the plates in the visible light region. It depicts that in material synthesis, surface as well as interior changes collectively are responsible for the efficient properties. The μ pulling method is a good technique for this purpose, since it provides the growth of the melt material from pure powders giving the control from bulk to the surface.157
Many other oxides have also been utilized as photoanodes. For example, Andrade et al.147 made seven different electrodes (W:BiVO4 (A), V2O5 (B), WO3 (C), WO3–V2O5 (D), W:BiVO4–WO3 (E), W: BiVO4–V2O5 (F), and W:BiVO4–WO3–V2O5) on FTO substrates by drop-casting. They characterized and found W:BiVO4–WO3–V2O5 as the best photoanode candidate with a photo-current density of 8.2 mA cm−2 due to the combined effect of WO3 and V2O5 in increasing electron and hole mobility, respectively. Their results have a great impact on water splitting applications, but these photoanodes cannot be achieved at larger scales with homogeneous film thickness or internal structure. Thus, it is proposed that the μ pulling method provides ease of synthesis and can help in achieving uniformity up to the bulk form. It is possible to achieve better photo-anodes with the same scheme each time at larger scales using the μ pulling method with the control of shape and size. The WO3–TiO2 and MnTiO3–TiO2 hybrid eutectic has successfully been made for PEC processes using the μ pulling method that shows the achievability of the aforementioned proposal.97,116 Likewise, the perovskite heterojunction based on p-type and n-type materials has been extensively studied for PEC and PV–PEC processes where junctions due to imbalance of charge carriers comes into formation. The formation of these junctions occurs at the interfaces where two different materials meet and made the charge transfer easy. Also, layers of different materials are combined with different absorption ranges so that overall absorption can be attenuated due to which overall PEC properties enhance.81,125 It can further be seen in the form of superlattices.158 These interfaces have been observed to form from the surface to bulk in the eutectics grown by the μ pulling method in different shapes like lamellar, rods and many more that can provide a variety of active sites along with selective etching options resulting in a diverse selection to modulate properties. Thus, sharp interfaces play an important role and can easily be achieved by the μ pulling method.86,89,95–97,104,105,120–122,157
A further important material that has been proven to be a good photoanode is α-Fe2O3. However, its application is limited due to short carrier lifetime, CB minimum more positive than proton reduction potential, shorter diffusion lengths for minority charge carriers, and a low absorption coefficient.13 The μ pulling method can provide a better way to achieve hematite in combination with other oxides to change the CB potential and increase the lifetime of carriers which can then further increase the PEC efficiency.
Another research made on the same oxygen vacancy idea using the flame method and evolution procedure of photoanodes was studied systematically. The researchers successfully improved the efficiency of BiVO4 photoanodes by 3 times from the untreated ones.159 Their theoretical studies were found in full agreement with their experimental finding, where oxygen vacancies were the reason behind the enhancement of PEC efficiency. They also found contributions from interfacial charge transfer and lower adsorption energy as the main phenomenon after oxygen vacancy evolution. This further helped them to improve other oxides like WO3, TiO2, and Fe2O3.159 The mechanisms of interfacial charge transfer can be further improved by achieving sharp interfaces. It can be attained by getting these oxides from the μ pulling method, which can not only improve the PEC performance by increasing oxygen vacancies further in the bulk but also sharp interfaces in a uniform manner.
Microwave-assisted synthesis has also been utilized in the fabrication of a photoanode. Scientists successfully tuned the structure of bismuth niobate by varying temperature and irradiation power in microwave-assisted synthesis and used it as a photoanode. They also synthesized WO3 photoanodes using the same method, made a comparison with BiNbO4, and found the optimum parameters.148 A direct impact of the phase change (from triclinic to orthorhombic) on photocurrent was found. Their results show the importance of evolution of the structure on PEC properties, which can be achieved from the μ pulling method as shown in Fig. 9(a).

The μ Pulling method provides an option to choose several phases during synthesis, which can help in improving the PEC efficiency. Kolodziejak et al. proved this by making the eutectic composites from the mixed powder of TiO2.89 Their group made two different eutectics (WO3–TiO2 and SrTiO3–TiO2) and found that anatase is dominant for WO3, while rutile is the only phase playing a part in SrTiO3 (Fig. 9(b and c)).86
Following the idea of different synthesis techniques, Zhang et al.149 tried to dope Sr in TiO2 nanotube arrays formed on the Ti substrate and successfully synthesized the SrTiO3–TiO2 nanotube arrays by hydrothermal treatment as shown in Fig. 8.149 An increase in the dose of SrTiO3 resulted in a shift of the flat band potential, which ultimately resulted in a 100% increase in photo-electrochemical properties. This research emphasizes the importance of the SrTiO3–TiO2 structure and its effect on bandgap potential. Later on, Wysmulek et al.86 used the same idea differently and synthesized SrTiO3–TiO2 eutectic composites instead of nanotube arrays. They produced photo-anodes of high quality with photocurrents up to 8.5 mA cm−2 under xenon lamps (see Fig. 10 and 11).

It can be seen that the same composition but with a different synthesis approach can give a dramatic change in PEC properties. As it has been suggested and focused on throughout this section that by using the μ pulling method, better results in photo-electrochemical properties can be achieved due to the benefits such as sharp interfaces and many more. On the same lines, Tomczyk et al. successfully attained ZnO–ZnWO4 eutectic rods using the μ pulling method.160 They achieved high-quality samples, where ZnO was embedded in the ZnWO4 matrix as lamellae/layers with low density of defects in bulk form and proposed it for optical applications as shown in Fig. 12. The same type of eutectic was made with a lamellar structure instead of a broken lamellar structure and utilized for optical filters.161 Their results not only prove the ease of synthesis but also show the attainment of sharp interfaces, which supports the assumptions made in this review regarding eutectics. Also, it provides a better platform for material selection for composites and opens new paths for upscaling the manufacturing of these materials at the industrial level. Thus, the μ-pulling method provides a variety of materials that can be combined irrespective of their lattice mismatch and help to modulate the properties according to the desired applications.

4 Outlook and challenges
At present, studies on water splitting have mainly been made on laboratory scales. For several decades, the commercialization of water splitting has failed. It shows low solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency below 10% and uneconomical hydrogen generation costs above 10 EUR kg−1.162 As the scales get larger, several challenges like slow charge shuttling, reduced light absorption, sluggish diffusional transport, and rapid charge recombination appear, which worsens STH efficiency. The active site for charge recombination and water splitting may be intrinsically the same for different photocatalysts, so this intrinsic limitation disrupts higher STH efficiencies. Intense investigations for finding new advanced materials are ongoing, however, the outputs are still far from being industrially promising.
Eutectic composites have great potential as materials for solar-energy conversion.89 Due to the high crystallinity of phases, the charge transport can be improved in each phase. On the other hand, the sharp interfaces between the phases can enhance charge transport between two phases.96,97 Moreover, different bandgap edge positions can reduce the charge-carrier recombination rate.163 There are studies showing that eutectic nanoalloys (made from metals) exhibit a better catalytic behavior compared to the same metals.164 In fact, in liquid metal ultrasonication (and many other liquid-metal-based methods), the process of liquid eutectic alloying is favored. The availability of various combinations of various metal species (binary, ternary, quaternary, etc.) draws a bright future for them. J. M. Yu et al. applied eutectic compounds to passivate high-performance and stable organic-semiconductor photoanodes and achieved a high photocurrent density compared to that of metal oxide photoanodes.165 Their system is quite important because it gives the ability to modify the VB edge and the CB positions of the system to meet the hydrogen and oxygen evolution potential, which consequently can make unbiased water splitting possible. This would be the most ideal form of PEC water splitting. Also, the materials made by the μ-pulling method have only been studied extensively for optical applications, and only a few reports have been made for eutectics as a water splitting candidate paving the way to new research options.
Despite the great potential of eutectic compounds in photoelectrochemical catalysis, there are missing systematic studies on the electronic structure of the surface/interface of eutectic compounds in the different reaction mediums. This is tangible, especially for electron spectroscopy methods, which provide direct insight into the mechanisms behind the improvements of catalytic properties. Such experiments can give a direct comparison with the surface/interface phenomenon and link them to the available application-oriented studies, providing the route to improve their properties.
