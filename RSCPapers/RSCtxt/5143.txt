    , Accepted 20th July 2018First published on 20th July 2018AbstractIn this work, a novel star-shaped conjugated small molecule, 2,2′,2′′-((benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene-2,5,8-triyltris(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-5,2-diyl))tris(methanylylidene))trimalono-nitrile (BTTCN), with a benzotrithiophene donor unit as the core structure and the electron-withdrawing dicyano groups as the end-cappers, was designed and synthesized. It was used as the third component to construct ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a typical polymer/fullerene binary host (PTB7-Th:PC71BM). The results manifested that BTTCN served as an energy cascading interlayer to improve the exciton dissociation and transport of the active layer by doping with only a minimal amount of BTTCN that aided to construct a cascade energy level alignment. In contrast to the binary blends, the as-prepared PSCs with 3 wt% BTTCN dopant showed enhanced short-circuit current densities (JSC), which resulted in an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 8.72% to 9.43%.
Introduction
In the past several years, great progress has been achieved in polymer solar cells (PSCs) by exploring high performance light-harvesting materials, optimizing the film morphology and improving the interfacial contact between the photoactive layer and the electrodes.1–3 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSC systems, which typically contain one donor polymer and one electron acceptor, have achieved a high efficiency exceeding 13%.4–7 Though quite promising, there is still a large efficiency gap to the stage of commercialization.8–11
Ternary organic solar cells (TOSCs) have emerged as a promising strategy to improve the utilization of solar photons by incorporating a third component material in single-junction devices, leading to the enhancement of short-circuit current densities (JSC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE).12,13 TOSCs possess the advantages of improving the photon harvesting ability as tandem cells, while maintaining the simplicity of fabrication that is used in single-junction cells.14–17 These advantages raise increasing interest for developing TOSCs with various compositions of the active layer.18–21 The basic concept for TOSCs is to introduce a third component to extend the light absorption scope.22–29 Therefore, most of the previous research studies focus on involving the third components to improve the light harvesting ability of the active layer.30,31 In addition, other advantages of the ternary blend strategy, e.g. enhancing the charge carrier mobility, improving the film morphology (polymer crystallinity, crystal orientation, domain-size and purity), and increasing the open circuit voltage (VOC), have been demonstrated as well for TOSCs.32–35
In general, the third component improves the PCE of TOSCs via structural (morphological) and/or electronic effects.36 Structurally, the third component can act as a template to facilitate BHJ assembly and the blend film might achieve an ideal nanostructure morphology. This can benefit charge dissociation and transport. Electronically, it can play the role of a “sensitizer” and/or “energy bridging interlayer”. For example, an efficient approach to improve the efficiency of TOSCs is to introduce a dye sensitizer as the third component.36 In some cases, the majority of dye molecules are segregated to donor/acceptor interfaces and work as an energy transfer agent which can facilitate charge separation of the active layer.37 The excited dye sensitizer may transfer energy to either the acceptor or the donor through Dexter or Förster resonance energy transfer. For effective sensitization, careful design of the third component material (for example, suitable surface energy) and regulation of its energy levels (for example, in cascading) are necessary to ensure that the dye sensitizer is in the appropriate phase to achieve efficient charge transfer between the components of the active layer.38 One attractive design strategy for TOSCs is to construct a cascade energy level alignment to facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport.39–42 The facile tunable chemical structures and versatile photoelectric properties of conjugated molecules provide a good opportunity to design novel ternary blend systems with cascade energy levels. They have been explored successively in the past two years.43–47 Commonly, a large amount of the third component is required to utilize its own complementary absorption and/or other advantages mentioned above.48 As for our previous work, it was found that the optimized blending amount of 20% (wt%) for the third component was necessary to improve the utilization of solar energy and carrier mobilities for enhancing the PCE.29
Herein, we demonstrate an interesting example with which a minimal loading amount of a third component (BTTCN, 3 wt%) in a typical polymer/fullerene binary host (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) can be effective enough to improve the exciton dissociation and reduce the charge recombination by constructing a favorable cascade energy level alignment. BTTCN was segregated to donor/acceptor interfaces and acted as a sensitizer in TOSCs, therefore leading to a significant improvement of photovoltaic performance. Specifically, the optimal TOSCs with 3 wt% BTTCN loading exhibits a higher efficiency of 9.43% in contrast to that of its major binary counterpart (8.72%), with a VOC of 0.804 V, a JSC of 17.15 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.4%.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the photoactive materials discussed in this work are depicted in Fig. 1a. The corresponding synthetic procedures of BTTCN are presented in Scheme 1. The target compound was synthesized by a typical Stille coupling reaction using 2,5,8-tris(trimethyl stannyl)benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene (BTT) and 2-((5-bromo-3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen- 2-yl)methylene)malononitrile as the precursors. The BTT unit was selected as the building block due to its good molecular planarity and moderate electron donating ability. The well-known electron-withdrawing dicyano groups were utilized as the end-cappers for fine tuning the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels.

The electrochemical properties of BTTCN were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests with a standard three-electrode system. The corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI).† The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO levels are calculated from the corresponding oxidation and reduction potential onsets.46 The LUMO level is determined to be −3.68 eV, and the HOMO level is −5.77 eV. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, the LUMO and HOMO levels of BTTCN locate at the middle between the HOMOs and LUMOs of the active layers based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends, which suggests its great potential for constructing cascade energy level alignments. Fig. 1c shows the normalized optical absorption spectra of PTB7-Th and BTTCN in thin solid films, in which BTTCN shows an absorption peak between 400 and 572 nm, corresponding to the complementary absorption spectra of PTB7-Th in the short-wavelength region. To understand the role of BTTCN in PTB7-Th/PC71BM blends, photoluminescence (PL) quenching tests for PTB7-Th:BTTCN and BTTCN:PC71BM blend films were performed. The emission spectra of the pure samples of PTB7-Th and BTTCN in comparison with those of their blend films for PTB7-Th/BTTCN and BTTCN:PC71BM are depicted in Fig. S2 and S3.† In both cases, the addition of the samples with low-lying energy levels resulted in obvious PL quenching, indicating efficient photo-induced charge transfer. To further demonstrate the existence of charge transfer between PTB7-Th and BTTCN, we prepared a device using PTB7-Th:BTTCN as the light-harvesting layer. A typical inverted geometry with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag is utilized as shown in Fig. 1d. We noted that the PTB7-Th:BTTCN devices yielded very high VOC under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, which resulted from the large gap between the LUMO of BTTCN and the HOMO of PTB7-Th. The blend with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.5 gave the best performance: VOC, JSC, FF and PCE reach 1.03 V, 6.3 mA cm−2, 0.40 and 2.51%, respectively (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). The binary devices of BTTCN:PC71BM showed no obvious photovoltaic behaviors, which might be the result of their poor film morphology (Fig. S6, ESI†).
To investigate the effects of BTTCN on photovoltaic performance, OSC devices with various BTTCN doping ratios were fabricated. The overall PTB7-Th to PC71BM ratio is kept at 1:1.5 (w/w). The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2a. The corresponding average photovoltaic parameters (VOC, FF, JSC and PCE) of the ternary blend devices and PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary reference devices are summarized in Table 1. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM reference devices yielded an averaged PCE of 8.53% with a typical VOC of 0.804 V, a JSC of 15.68 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.7%. With the incorporation of BTTCN (3 wt% loading) into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary blends, JSC was enhanced obviously. As a result, a higher average PCE value of 9.43% was achieved with average parameters of VOC = 0.804 V, JSC = 17.15 mA cm−2 and FF = 68.4%. The results showed that additional BTTCN components had little influence on VOC for the resulting ternary devices. Increasing the BTTCN doping ratios led to a decreased JSC and FF, which might be related to the aggregate formation of BTTCN and thus the corresponding severe phase separation (Fig. S7, ESI†).

To understand the origin of the enhanced JSC in OSC devices with BTTCN loading, external quantum efficiency (EQE) for the control devices and the devices based on the blends with 3 wt% and 10 wt% BTTCN loading was measured. The results are depicted in Fig. 2b. As compared with the reference devices, the devices based on 3 wt% BTTCN addition showed an overall enhancement in the EQE response across the whole absorption band of PTB7-Th:PC71BM. The calculated JSC values for the reference devices and the 3 wt% BTTCN doped devices are 15.56 mA cm−2 and 17.11 mA cm−2, respectively. This indicates that the enhanced photocurrent mainly comes from the improvements of exciton dissociation or transport from PTB7-Th/PC71BM interfaces, as the low content of BTTCN cannot contribute to the photocurrent. This is consistent with the UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. S8†) for the blend films and 3 wt% BTTCN loading leads to a negligible effect on improving the light-harvesting ability. Further increasing the BTTCN ratio up to 0.10 resulted in an evidently enhanced EQE response within the region from 427 nm to 567 nm, which was ascribed to the absorption of BTTCN. This suggests that for the high doping ratio, BTTCN served mainly as an electron acceptor to separate the excitons. However, it may sacrifice the ability on improving exciton dissociation for PTB7-Th/PC71BM blends with a low feed ratio of 0.03 BTTCN, since the EQE response from PTB7-Th/PC71BM did not show any improvements.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) tests were performed to understand the morphology variations with varying BTTCN loading. A typical phase separated morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.28 nm was found for PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary films (Fig. 3). The RMS roughness values were recorded to be 1.89 nm and 1.32 nm for 3 wt% and 10 wt% BTTCN loading, respectively. The blend films with low BTTCN feed ratios (BTTCN = 0.03 and 0.10) show similar surface morphology to the control film. However, large aggregations became prominent when the BTTCN feed ratio was up to 0.15, leading to a rugged surface morphology. This may be ascribed to the strong crystallization tendency of BTTCN and its limited miscibility with the polymer donor during the film-forming process. The existing large aggregates were also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. S9.† They commonly lead to reduced donor/acceptor interfaces and poor interfacial contact between the active layer and the electrode.26,27 To further understand the morphology variations for the low feed ratio doping films, two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) was performed (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c and d show the out-of-plane and in-plane 2D-GIWAXS profiles, respectively. All of the tested films show similar Bragg diffraction circles, and there is no appearance of any new diffraction peak even for 10 wt% BTTCN addition. The results suggested that the BTTCN addition with a low feed ratio did not obviously change the morphology of the active layers. Considering the much improved photovoltaic performance and enlarged EQE response for the ternary blends of PTB7-Th/PC71BM with 3 wt% BTTCN dopant, as well as little disruption of PTB7-Th/PC71BM crystallinity and orientation, it was deduced that BTTCN molecules were likely to be concentrated at donor/acceptor interfaces.36,38 This would thus play a positive role in facilitating the charge separation due to the well-established cascade energy levels.

The impact of BTTCN on the charge transport properties of the active layers was evaluated. The hole and electron mobility of the blend films were measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al, respectively (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†). The control device showed a hole mobility (μh) of 1.27 ± 0.35 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 5.06 ± 1.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. With 0.03 BTTCN loading, a higher μh of 1.57 ± 0.24 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an enlarged μe of 7.66 ± 0.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained. The increased carrier mobility and reduced μh/μe suggested improved and balanced charge transport, manifesting the possibility in reducing bi-molecular recombination losses (Table 2).

To understand the charge generation and dissociation process in the devices with an optimal BTTCN blend ratio, photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves were plotted as shown in Fig. 4a. Here, Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current densities under light and in the dark. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is equal to zero and Va is the applied bias voltage. The Jph of the ternary blend device reaches saturation at a lower Veff in comparison with that of the binary reference, suggesting a weaker bimolecular recombination and more efficient charge collection. A larger saturated current density (Veff ≥ 2 V) of 17.32 mA cm−2 was found for the ternary blend device in contrast to a Jsat of 16.52 mA cm−2 of the binary reference. The larger Jsat of the ternary blend device suggested an enlarged overall charge generation.49 Furthermore, the charge collection efficiency, which is determined from the ratio of JSC/Jsat, is calculated. In the current case, the JSC values for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM device and PTB7-Th:PC71BM:BTTCN ternary blend device are 15.68 mA cm−2 and 17.15 mA cm−2, respectively. The charge collection efficiency at the short circuit condition for the binary devices and the ternary devices (1:1.5:0.03) is 94.9% and 99.0%, respectively. The incorporation of 0.03-BTTCN into PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends not only enhanced the overall charge generation, but also improved the charge dissociation process, which can be attributed to the improved exciton dissociation at the PTB7-Th:BTTCN interface. In addition, the light intensity dependent VOC was tested to further understand the recombination dynamics, and their fitting results are shown in Fig. 4b. The slope of VOCversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity is used to describe the competition between bimolecular and monomolecular recombination at open circuit conditions.50 The slopes for the binary references and ternary blend devices were found to be 1.21kT/q and 1.13kT/q, which suggests a better interfacial layer and weaker monomolecular recombination with BTTCN blending. JSC as a function of illumination intensity (Plight) is plotted on the double log scale and fitted to the power law according to the relation: JSC ∝ (Plight)α, where the value of α represents the strength of the bimolecular recombination. The deviation for α from unity can be attributed to the space charge effects, bimolecular recombination, and the variations of mobility between the two carriers. The closer α to unity suggests lower bimolecular recombination.51 As shown in Fig. 4c, the resulting value of α was 0.979 for the BTTCN doping device, and 0.958 for the control device, respectively. Furthermore, quantification of the photovoltaic recombination resistance (Rrec) was measured using impedance spectroscopy. Typical impedance spectra of the device with and without 0.03 BTTCN doping obtained for devices under illumination at a bias voltage corresponding to VOC in the frequency ranging from 20 to 1 × 106 Hz are presented in Fig. 4d. The inset shows the impedance equivalent circuit, where Rs is the series resistance, R1 corresponds to Rrec, and C1 is the capacitance. From the impedance spectra, Rrec of the binary device is lower than that of the binary device after BTTCN doping. The higher Rrec of the ternary device reveals that the introduction of BTTCN decreases the recombination owing to the increased Rrec. The electron lifetime might be increased which will benefit charge transport.52 The electron lifetime (τn) was calculated from the Nyquist plot (Fig. 4c) using the equation τe = (2πfmax)−1, where fmax is the characteristic frequency associated with the highest value of the recombination region of the arc in the Nyquist plot. Thus, the calculated electron lifetime of the device with 3 wt% BTTCN doping is found to be 1.06 × 10−5 s, which is longer than the electron lifetime of 7.24 × 10−6 s for the control device. All in all, both Jph–Veff curves and VOC–light intensity and impedance spectroscopy results suggested reduced exciton recombination for the optimized devices, which matched well with the mobility test results.

Conclusion
In summary, a novel star-shaped conjugated small molecule (BTTCN) was designed and synthesized. Efficient PSCs were constructed by incorporating a minimal loading amount of BTTCN into the blend layer comprising a PTB7-Th polymer donor and a fullerene derivative PC71BM acceptor. Of particular relevance is the formation of a cascade energy level alignment, where BTTCN plays a bridging role as an energy cascading molecular dopant and provides additional pathways for exciton dissociation in the bulk heterojunction films. By optimizing the ratio of BTTCN, the resulting ternary blend PSCs exhibited significantly improved power conversion efficiency relative to their binary counterparts. An enhanced PCE value from 8.53 ± 0.19% to 9.43 ± 0.29% was achieved with a minimal loading amount of BTTCN (3 wt%), which was ascribed to the improved charge generation and transport and reduced exciton recombination. The findings suggest an attractive strategy to construct high-performance PSCs by exploring the potential of energy cascading molecules.
