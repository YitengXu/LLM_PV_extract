    , Accepted 26th September 2021First published on 28th September 2021AbstractSurface modification is an effective strategy to promote charge transport and extraction, reduce the carrier recombination probability, and ultimately improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Borophene is the lightest two-dimensional (2D) layered material, with high carrier mobility and high hardness. In this work, a sonication-assisted liquid-phase preparation technique was developed to prepare borophene quantum dots (BQDs) with uniform size, good dispersion, and high stability. The use of BQDs as a surface passivation agent on the TiO2 layer in an inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell was presented. It is found that the boron atoms undergo strong interactions with TiO2 and the perovskite, reducing interfacial recombination and forming a cascade energy alignment for effective charge transport. A CsPbI2Br solar cell with a thin BQD interlayer shows high efficiency of 15.31%, whereas the efficiency was 14.24% for the device with no BQDs. The enhancement in efficiency is mainly due to carrier recombination suppression and a decrease in the defect density at the TiO2/CsPbI2Br interface after BDQ treatment. This work demonstrates that high-quality BQDs have great potential to be applied in perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Inspired by the discovery of graphene,1 two-dimensional layered materials (2DMs) with novel properties and structures have been widely investigated.2 Recently, 2DMs constructed from light and nonmetallic elements, such as nitrogen (N), boron (B), oxygen (O), and carbon (C) atoms, have received wide attention because of their diverse structures and property variations, especially the design of 2DMs with tailored electronic properties and specific functionalities.3–6 Borophene is a typical representative of these new 2DMs constructed from light and nonmetallic elements.7 It is generally composed of boron that is a few atoms thick, and it has received great attention in recent years because of its excellent chemical stability,8 high carrier mobility,9 tunable band gap,10 high energy storage capacity,11 and superconductivity.12 Although a number of theoretical calculations have indicated that borophene with a layered structure can exist with stability,13–15 only a few experiments on borophene have been reported to date due to the complicated structure and electron-deficient characteristics of bulk boron.16–18
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and ease of fabrication.19 After nearly 10 years of rapid development, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly increased from 3.8% (ref. 20) to over 25%, which is close to the levels21 of monocrystalline silicon solar cells. However, a PSC is generally prepared via a low-temperature solution process, which may lead to complex surface conditions, with different types of defects formed on the exposed film surface during the non-uniform film formation process and subsequent annealing.22–25 Experimental results show that defects will increase the carrier recombination probability and seriously affect the efficiency26,27 of a PSC. Therefore, various methods have been used to reduce the defect densities of PSCs, such as improving the process, solution doping, and surface modification. Surface modification is an effective strategy to passivate defects, adding a modified layer onto the surface of the material to promote charge transport28,29 and extraction, reduce the carrier recombination probability, and ultimately improve the performance of PSCs.30 Effective surface modification is still a great challenge for pursuing PSCs with higher performance. In this regard, 2D quantum dots (QDs), such as graphene QDs31 and MoS2,32 are usually utilized for the interfacial engineering of PSCs, including passivation and the formation of cascade energy alignments for effective charge transport, thereby enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs.
In this work, a sonication-assisted liquid-phase preparation technique is developed to prepare BQDs with uniform size and good dispersion. The measured band gap of these BQDs is around 3.0 eV. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to establish the tunable band gap of boron, and the experimental data from the prepared BQDs agrees well with the theoretical values. To demonstrate the potential application of BQDs in optoelectronic devices, an inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell with BQDs as a passivation layer was fabricated. It is found that the BQDs had two important functions. Firstly, the BQDs form an energy gradient at the TiO2 and perovskite interface, facilitating electron transport. Secondly, the BQDs undergo strong interactions with Ti4+ in TiO2 and Pb2+ in the perovskite, respectively, passivating the interface between TiO2 and the perovskite. With the help of this excellent surface passivation effect, a CsPbI2Br device with BQD treatment demonstrates a high PCE of 15.31%. Therefore, this work will allow a novel approach for the application of BQDs in modern photovoltaic devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Boron powder (95%) with an average particle size of 2 μm was purchased from Merck. N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) (AR, >99.5%) was purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Butyl alcohol (NBA) (AR, >99.5%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Cesium iodide (CsI), lead bromide (PbBr2), lead iodide (PbI2), lead acetate (PbAc2), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. DMF and DMSO were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Preparation of a BQD dispersion
In a typical experiment for the preparation of BQDs, 15 mg of boron powder was first added into a mortar and ground for 30 min to make it thinner. Then, it was transferred to a glass vial containing a mixed solution of NMP (9 mL) and NBA (6 mL), and this was stirred at a speed of 400 rpm for 12 h to obtain a transparent suspension. The transparent suspension was probe-sonicated in an ice-bath for 6 h, and following ultrasonic-bath treatment for 2 h at a power of 600 W, a dispersion was obtained. The dispersion was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 20 min, and then a supernatant consisting of BQDs was obtained. By changing the ice-bath time to 4 h and 8 h, respectively, the BQDs with different sizes and uniform morphologies were also prepared by a similar process.
2.3 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
DFT calculations are performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.33 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional using the generalized-gradient approximation (PBE-GGA)34 is adopted for the exchange–correlation functional. All these calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 6.1.0).35,36 In all calculations, the plane-wave expansion of the wave function with an energy cutoff of 400 eV is applied. During relaxation, the force tolerance is set to 0.05 eV Å−1. The bulk B is optimized from the crystal structure in the Crystallography Open Database with 4 × 4 × 4 k-point meshes. The QDs (0.3, 2.0, and 3.7 nm) are cleaved from bulk B, and the vacuum slab is about 10 Å. The QDs are constructed via including all atoms within a given radius. The surface atoms of the QDs are passivated using pseudo-H atoms.37 The gamma point is used for quantum dot calculations. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional is used to calculated band structures and energy levels.
2.4 Solar cell fabrication
FTO substrates were cleaned sequentially with ethanol, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. The cleaned substrates were treated with ultraviolet radiation for 10 min before the deposition of TiO2. After that, the FTO substrates were immersed in 4.5 mL of TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 1 h to deposit the TiO2 layer. PbI2(DMSO) and PbBr2(DMSO) were prepared by a similar synthesis process as previously reported.38 0.9 M CsPbI2Br perovskite precursor solution with the additive PbAc2 was prepared via dissolving PbBr2(DMSO), PbI2(DMSO), CsI, and PbAc2 (molar ratio = 1:1:2:0.025) in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (17:3, v/v). The TiO2 layers were treated with ultraviolet radiation for 8 min, in order to better disperse the BQDs. The BQDs dispersed in isopropanol at different concentrations (0.05 mg mL−1, 0.025 mg mL−1, 0.01 mg mL−1, and 0.005 mg mL−1) were spin-coated on TiO2 using 1000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 40 s. The perovskite solution was spin-coated on the substrates using the same spin-coating process as for the BQDs. Then, the substrates were sequentially heated to 35 °C for 6 min, 120 °C for 10 min, and 180 °C for 3 min. For the hole-transport layer, spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared via dissolving 90 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene and mixing this with 36 μL of t-BP and 22 μL of Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1) solution in acetonitrile. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was deposited on top of the CsPbI2Br perovskite layer via spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the samples were transferred to a vacuum chamber to deposit 80 nm-thick gold top electrodes via thermal evaporation. The active area of each device is 0.09 cm2; a schematic diagram of the device is shown in Fig. S8,† and each square has a side length of 0.3 mm.
2.5 Characterization
The morphologies and nanostructures of bulk B powder and the as-prepared BQDs were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TM-3000), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SU8020), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The BQD suspension was dropped onto an ultrathin carbon-coated holey carbon support film with a 200-mesh copper grid, followed by drying naturally for TEM measurements. The thickness and size of the prepared BQDs were measured with an atomic force microscope (AFM, Dimension FastScan) in tapping mode under atmospheric conditions. AFM samples were prepared by dropping the BQD dispersion onto a Si substrate, followed by drying naturally or under vacuum at 50 °C for several hours. The composition and chemical state were determined by XPS (PHI Quantera II), and the binding energy calibration was referenced to C 1s at 284.8 eV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a D/Max-3c X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), scanning from 5° to 80° and using an operating voltage and current of 40 kV and 15 mA. The UV-vis absorption spectra of samples were collected using a UV-Lambda 950 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-7000 instrument with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm at room temperature. The PL decay kinetics was measured using a FLS980 spectrometer equipped with a pulsed blue laser (405 nm) at room temperature. The samples were prepared via dropping the BQD suspension into 1 cm path-length quartz cuvettes with airtight screw caps. The J–V curves of CsPbI2Br PSCs were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source meter under ambient conditions. The illumination intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)-traceable KG5-filtered silicon reference cell.
3. Results and discussion
Bulk 2DMs can be converted into QDs via destroying the van der Waals layers of their bulk counterparts. Top-down methods are generally used to prepare QDs from their native layered precursors. In comparison with other typical bulk precursors, it is difficult to exfoliate bulk B because more complex and diverse structures exist in bulk B. Therefore, a sonication-assisted liquid-phase preparation technique is developed to prepare BQDs with uniform size and good dispersion in the present work, and the typical process and details are shown in Fig. S1.† The probe sonication power and time are important controlling factors for QD preparation from a native layered precursor. The effects of power on the size of the BQDs are shown in Fig. S2.† It is clear that higher power is beneficial for obtaining smaller-size materials; in particular, at a lower sonication power, only boron nanosheets can be produced (Fig. S2a†). Samples prepared at 600 W are smaller in size than samples prepared at 500 W. In this sense, for the preparation of the QDs, we directly use high sonication power (600 W) to destroy the interlayer forces and in-plane covalent bonds. For the sake of investigating the influence of time on the size, uniformity, and distribution of the obtained BQDs, different probe sonication times at a power of 600 W were selected to observe the effects (Fig. S2 and S3†). Combining TEM images (Fig. S3†) and size histograms of the obtained BQDs (Fig. S4†), it is obvious that as the ultrasound time increases, the size of the BQDs gradually decreases. However, BQDs obtained after 6 hours of sonication are better than those obtained under other conditions; compared with the materials prepared after 8 h, the sample distribution after 6 h is uniform, and most of the BQDs have a size of around 3.2 nm. Therefore, the optimized sonication time is 6 h for the preparation of BQDs.
AFM images indicate that the statistical thickness of the prepared BQDs after 6 h is about 2.5 ± 1 nm (Fig. 1a and b), which corresponds to 5 ± 2 layers. The decreases in both the lateral dimensions (Fig. 1c and S3†) and thickness suggest that bulk B is transformed into BQDs. TEM imaging shows the spherical morphology, and the size is around 4 nm (Fig. 1c). In Fig. 1d, a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image is displayed, confirming the high crystallinity of the BQDs. Fig. 1d also provides a simulated view of the boron crystalline structure and lattice. Regular and clear B atom sites with a periodically arranged lattice can be obviously observed, which agrees well with the corresponding structural model (right side of Fig. 1d). The corresponding representative fast Fourier transform (FFT) diffraction pattern (Fig. 1e) gives interplanar spacing values of 0.18 nm and 0.21 nm, which can be ascribed to the (416) and (321) planes, respectively, of β-rhombohedral B crystals. The results suggest that the crystalline state of bulk B was unchanged during the experimental treatment.

The crystalline structures and phase purities of the bulk B precursor and the prepared BQDs are confirmed based on XRD patterns (Fig. S5†). Compared with bulk B, the main peaks of the prepared BQDs can also be indexed to β-rhombohedral B (JCPDF 00-031-0207),39 suggesting that the B crystalline phase shows no obvious change after bulk B is transformed into BQDs.
After demonstrating the successful preparation of BQDs, their optical properties are investigated via UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 2a). The BQDs show broad absorption ranging from 300 nm to 900 nm, and they can be readily redispersed in NMP and NBA and stabilized for 20 days; an obvious Tyndall effect is observed, indicating the colloidal nature of the obtained BQD dispersion (inset of Fig. 2a). The optical band gap (Eg) is a very important value for QDs, and it can be calculated using a Tauc plot.40 The optical band gap of the BQDs is calculated via the equation (αhν)1/n = C × (hν − Eg), where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, C is a constant of proportionality, ν is the frequency of light, Eg is the band gap, and n is 1/2 or 2 (depending on whether this is direct or indirect band gap material). For the as-prepared BQDs, the fitting results indicate that the BQDs are a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 3 eV (Fig. 2b), implying their potential application in UV-vis photoelectric devices. The photoluminescence (PL) mechanism of the as-prepared BQDs can be investigated using a fluorescence spectrophotometer, and the PL emission spectrum is shown in Fig. 2c. A sharp and narrow emission peak at 440 nm is observed when the BQDs are excited at an excitation wavelength of 372 nm, corresponding to the blue emission band. Moreover, the BQDs exhibit obvious blue fluorescence when they are excited using 365 nm UV lamp irradiation in a dark-box-type ultraviolet analyzer (inset of Fig. 2c), further supporting the existence of a blue emission band in the case of the as-prepared BQDs. In order to further investigate the relaxation process and transient evolution of the photogenerated free charge carriers of the as-prepared BQDs, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements are carried out, and the time-resolved PL decay and fitting curves are shown in Fig. 2d. By using a biexponential decay model,40 the PL decay curve from the as-prepared BQDs can be fitted, and the PL lifetime is considered to be the sum of the fast- and slow-decay components, giving the short lifetime (τ1) and long lifetime (τ2), respectively. The obtained short lifetime, τ1, is 1.67 ns, and the long lifetime, τ2, is 7.70 ns. The obtained average lifetime is 4.43 ns, which is comparable to a previously reported value.41

The PL spectrum of fresh BQDs obtained by grinding-assisted ultrasonic probe treatment in a mixed solvent of NMP and NBA for 6 h (c) and the time-resolved PL decay and fitting curve of a typical sample (d). 
Previous studies have indicated that the size and surface states of 2D QDs are critical factors in determining their PL properties,42 as is the case for graphene quantum dots (GQDs). The surface states of GQDs play a major role in determining their PL properties when GQDs are relatively small in size, while the larger carbon skeleton is the main contributor to the PL features for relatively larger GQDs. Therefore, the effects of the 2D BQD size on the PL properties should be further investigated.
The surface compositions and chemical states of bulk B and the prepared BQDs are investigated using XPS spectra (Fig. 3). In XPS survey scans over binding energies ranging from 0 to 800 eV, the main peaks corresponding to B, C, O, and N are maintained for the two samples (Fig. 3c).
 Fig. 3  XPS characterization of bulk B and BQDs obtained via grinding-assisted ultrasonic probe treatment in a mixed solvent of NMP and NBA for 6 h: the atomic ratios (a) and corresponding XPS survey spectra (c); and high-resolution B 1s spectra for bulk B (b) and BQDs (d). 
The boron element content of the BQDs is slightly reduced after exfoliation compared with bulk boron (Fig. 3a). This is mainly due to airborne impurities and the introduction of the exfoliation solvent. Thus, the carbon and nitrogen content levels increase. Meanwhile, the oxygen content is almost unchanged, which suggested an unchanged transformation from bulk B to BQDs. In general, quantum dots may be oxidized during the preparation process. In order to confirm that the prepared BQDs were not oxidized, high-resolution B 1s spectra from prepared BQD and bulk B precursor samples are further analysed (Fig. 3b and d). Although the peak intensities show obvious changes, the positions of the peaks at both 187.8 eV and 188.6 eV corresponding to B–B bonds hardly change, suggesting that the chemical state of B undergoes no obvious change; this is because the position of the binding energy peak in the XPS spectrum is relative to the corresponding chemical state of the atom. The reason for the changes in peak intensity may be related to the bonding mode of B–B bonds changing to a certain extent in the prepared BQDs.43 The peak at 193.2 eV is corresponding to the B–O bonds (B2O3) in a boron-rich oxide nearly dismisses for the obtained BQDs due to their interactions with the solvent, and similar results are also observed for the preparation of few-layer boron sheets by liquid-phase exfoliation.44 Band-gap modification in 2D materials is highly desirable for building future nanodevices.45 It is expected that the band gap of the BQDs will be tuned as the size changes. UV-vis and PL emission spectra confirmed that the band gap of the as-prepared BQDs is around 3 eV. In order to investigate the band-gap tunable properties of BQDs with different sizes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed (Fig. 4 and S6†). The band structures are derived from the energy levels of the atoms. When two similar atoms come close together, each energy level of the atom splits into two energy levels. One of the energy levels is higher than the original one and the other is lower. This phenomenon becomes more obvious when there are more atoms in a quantum dot, and the band gap becomes narrower. Therefore, when the size of the quantum dot increases from 0.3 nm to 2.0 nm to 3.7 nm to ∞ (bulk), the band gap decreases from 8.23 eV to 5.33 eV to 3.11 eV to 1.58 eV, respectively. The energy levels also become denser. Conversely, from the bulk phase to quantum dots, the band structure changes to energy levels.
 Fig. 4  Experimental data compared with a fitting line based on the DFT calculation data. 
The calculated band gaps for different-sized BQDs are plotted in Fig. 4. The four points of the calculated data are marked as cirlces. By exponentially fitting the four points, they obey the fitting formula given in Fig. 4. Comparing our experimental data (3.0 eV for 4 nm and 1.9 eV for bulk (Fig. S7†)) with the calculated values, there is good agreement with the fitting line. These results demonstrate that the band gap of the BQDs can be tuned as the size changes, and this may open up the possibility of device applications for BQDs.
To evaluate the potential application of BQDs in an optoelectronic device, an inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cell with an n–i–p structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/BQDs/CsPbI2Br/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine](PTAA)/Au was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 5a, and a schematic diagram of the device is shown in Fig. S8.† The BQDs were coated on the TiO2 film as a passivation layer. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping was carried out to ensure that the QD film fully covered the TiO2 surface (Fig. S9†). As shown in Fig. S10,† the effect of the BQD coating on the energy band structure of TiO2 was analyzed via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The corresponding band diagram and a band diagram showing EVBM, Ecutoff, and EF are described in Fig. 5b and S11;† the downshifted conduction band minimum (CBM) position of TiO2 favors photogenerated electron extraction from the perovskite to FTO due to the removed transport barrier. Fig. 5c shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of CsPbI2Br solar cells without and with a BQD passivation layer, and Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters in detail. The amount of BQDs on the TiO2 film was regulated based on the concentration of the BQD solution. A control device without a BQD passivation layer displays a PCE of 14.24% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.24 V. The PCEs of devices with different BQD passivation concentrations first increased and then decreased, and the best efficiency of 15.31% was obtained in the device with 0.01 mg mL−1 BQD passivation.

To understand the reasons for the improved performance of CsPbI2Br cells after passivating with BQDs, we have carried out a series of photoelectric measurements, including steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), space charge-limited current (SCLC) model, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As shown in Fig. S12a,† the PL intensity of the perovskite film with BQD modification is enhanced compared with that of a control film without modification, suggesting that the BQDs can passivate the perovskite film to suppress nonradiative recombination. The TRPL results (Fig. S12b and Table S1†) confirm the PL results; the average charge lifetime of the perovskite film is enhanced from 17.24 to 25.82 ns after BQD treatment. To evaluate the effects of BQD treatment on the charge-transfer process at the perovskite/TiO2 interface, PL and TRPL analysis of hybrid perovskite/TiO2 films was also conducted.

Fig. 5d shows the steady-state current densities and maximum power points of control and optimized devices obtained while tracking at the maximum power points. The stabilized PCEs are ∼13.91% and 15.25% for the control and optimized CsPbI2Br PSCs, respectively.
The photovoltaic performance of the optimized CsPbI2Br PSC is supported by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The EQE spectra of CsPbI2Br PSCs are shown in Fig. S14.† Both integrated current values agree with the Jsc measurements from J–V curves (∼1% mismatch). The improvement can be ascribed to reduced charge recombination in the CsPbI2Br film with the BQD additive. Fig. S15 in the ESI† shows the statistical photovoltaic parameters of 20 individual devices of each type. The CsPbI2Br PSCs with BQD treatment show higher performance and a narrower photovoltaic parameter distribution compared to the control devices, indicating that the introduction of BQDs can improve the reproducibility of CsPbI2Br PSCs.
As shown in Fig. 6a and b and Table S2,† the TiO2/BQDs/CsPbI2Br device shows a lower PL intensity and faster PL quenching than the control TiO2/CsPbI2Br device, suggesting faster photo-induced electron transfer from CsPbI2Br to TiO2 after BQD passivation. Combining the PL and TRPL results, the existence of BQDs not only passivates the perovskite to suppress carrier recombination, but it also enhances carrier extraction at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are performed to provide insight into charge-carrier recombination in the CsPbI2Br PSCs, and the corresponding Nyquist plots and equivalent circuit model are presented in Fig. S13; the fitting parameters are listed in Table S3.† It is found that the optimized device exhibits lower series resistance (Rs) and much higher recombination resistance (Rrec) than the control device. These results are thus supportive of markedly reduced carrier recombination in the optimized device. Therefore, EIS characterization confirms that BQDs can promote the transport of charge carriers, consequently resulting in better photovoltaic performance. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 6c and d, the defect density at the interface between TiO2 and CsPbI2Br was significantly reduced from 1.17 × 1016 cm−3 to 6.47 × 1015 cm−3 after BQD treatment. The shifted B 1s and Pb 4f peaks in the XPS results (Fig. 6e and f) together with the shifted O 1s and Ti 2p peaks in Fig. S16† confirm the existence of strong electronic interactions between the BQDs and Ti4+ in TiO2 and between the BQDs and Pb2+ in the perovskite, suggesting that the TiO2 and perovskite surfaces can be simultaneously passivated by BQDs. Therefore, the BQDs can be applied to improve the photovoltaic performance of CsPbI2Br solar cells through passivating both TiO2 and perovskite to reduce the defect density at the interface and forming a bridge between TiO2 and the perovskite for effective electron transport. In order to evaluate the stabilities of the entire CsPbI2Br PSCs, unencapsulated CsPbI2Br PSCs without and with BQD additives are stored and tested in air (RH ≈ 20%). The optimized device shows a slow decrease in the PCE over time (Fig. S17†), maintaining 94% of its initial efficiency after 40 days. During the same aging process, the PCE of the control CsPbI2Br PSC drops to 87% of its initial value. These results indicate that the optimized CsPbI2Br PSC demonstrates better stability than the control device; the excellent air stability of the optimized PSC is probably due to surface passivation effects from the BQDs.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a sonication-assisted liquid-phase preparation technique is developed to prepare BQDs with a lateral size of 4 nm and a thickness of about 2 nm. They show uniform size and good dispersion. The band gap of the BQDs, calculated from UV and PL emission spectra, is around 3 eV. DFT calculations show that the BQDs show a size-dependent band gap. The band gap can be tuned from 1.58 eV to 3 eV as the size decreases from bulk to 3 nm. Meanwhile, the BQDs exhibit obvious blue fluorescence. These findings are not only useful for understanding the structural and electronic properties of BQDs, but they also help to advance their application in photovoltaic devices. When the BQDs were applied in an inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell as a passivation layer, they underwent strong interactions with TiO2 and the perovskite, reducing interfacial recombination and forming a cascade energy alignment for effective charge transport. With the help of the excellent surface effects, a device with BQD treatment demonstrated a high PCE of 15.31%. Therefore, this work proves that BQDs have great potential to be applied in future optoelectronic devices.
