The gradient refractive index structure, which was generated by removing the PMMA content from a film of PS-b-PMMA/PMMA blends, contributed to the broadband antireflection. The volume fraction of the PMMA block (fPMMA), the total degree of polymerization (N) and the weight percent of the homopolymer played a key role in the formation of the gradient porosity index inner structure. By increasing χN, the PS porous structure was kept from collapsing after removal of the PMMA domain, which led to a stable gradient porosity ratio structure and higher transmittance. While increasing fPMMA, the PMMA domains changed from a dispersed phase to a continuous phase, which caused the residual PS structure to collapse more easily and the transmittance decreased. The best broadband antireflective properties were achieved from the 45 mg mL−1 solution of PS-b-PMMA (Mn = 68000–33500, fPMMA = ∼25%) blended with 30 wt% PMMA: a mean transmittance of 98.4% at full spectrum, and >98.0% in the visible–NIR range between 600 nm and 2000 nm.
1. Introduction
Broadband antireflection (AR) coatings in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, corresponding to wavelengths between 400 nm and 2000 nm, can effectively enhance the transmittance of light through an optical surface, obtain clearer and brighter views of images and achieve high power conversion efficiency for solar cells.1–4 The principle of an AR coating is based on the destructive interference of reflected light from interfaces between the air/film and film/substrate. According to optical theory, the approach for the design of broadband AR coatings, which are multilayer films with a different refractive index for each layer, is:5,6 (1) the optical thickness of each layer has to be at least one quarter of the incident light wavelength. (2) The regular arrangement of the reflective indices of each layer is ng > nk > nk − 1… > n0, where ng, n0, k are the reflective indices of the substrate, air and the sequence number of the layer. (3) The refractive indices of the multilayer stack should satisfy the equation: n1/n0 = n2/n1 = …… = nk/nk − 1 = ng/nk.
Based on the above conditions, a gradient refractive index inner structure is needed to achieve broadband AR. To achieve this objective, a multilayer film with an increasing refractive index from the top to the bottom of the film has been fabricated.6 In recent years, many broadband AR films have been fabricated through different methods, including >99% transmittance from 610–730 nm with a maximum 99.25% at 660.5 nm based on reactive ion etching (RIE) processes,7 almost 100% transmittance between 550 nm and 900 nm through heteroepitaxial growth of nanorods,8 a reflectance of ∼0.7% between 400 nm and 1100 nm by means of replicating fly eyes,9 nearly 0% reflectance of 250–2000 nm according to oblique-angle deposition,10 and so forth. Compared to the above mentioned methods for the fabrication of inorganic materials, polymer broadband AR films, which can be made by the electrostatic self-assembly of colloid particles, which exhibited a broadband AR of more than 95% at visible wavelengths (400–800 nm),11 the breath-figure method, which showed low reflection <1% in the NIR light range (900–2200 nm),12 and layer-by-layer assembly with a maximum transmittance of 99.86% in the visible spectral range and above 97% transmittance of 800–1600 nm by simply changing the deposition cycles of multilayer films,2 would be attractive because of the adhesion to a flexible substrate and the ease of processing.
Nanoporous films from block copolymers after removing one component have been extensively used for broadband AR films.13–16 Kim and co-workers14,16 prepared a sponge-like nanoporous structure from PS-b-PMMA to achieve a minimum reflection of less than 0.1% at visible wavelengths, and triple-layered nanoporous films by sequentially spin-coating three different PS-b-PMMAs with different PMMA block volume fractions. It is worth mentioning that the triple-layered film with three different porosity ratios, which increased from the bottom to the top surface, showed an excellent AR that covered visible light to NIR wavelengths. Although this multilayer film that had a different refractive index for each layer could achieve AR at broadband wavelengths, the interfaces between air/each layer of film/substrate still existed and the methods always needed several steps.17,18 Recently, we reported a porous film with a gradient refractive index structure prepared by a PS-b-PMMA/PMMA blend, which avoided the existence of multiple interfaces and achieved good broadband AR properties.15 It was a simple and effective method to get broadband AR films, however, the best broadband AR properties were not achieved from this system, and the relationship between the intrinsic characteristics of block copolymers and different broadband AR properties was not revealed. Therefore, in this study, the dependence of the antireflective properties of the films on the intrinsic characteristics of block copolymers (fPMMA and χN) and the additional amounts of homopolymer were further and systematically investigated. The best broadband AR film was achieved from solution of PS-b-PMMA (fPMMA = ∼25%) blended with 30 wt% PMMA at 45 mg mL−1: a mean transmittance of 98.4% at full spectrum, a highest transmittance value of 99.6% around 709 nm and 1664 nm, and even in the visible–NIR range a transmittance of >98.0% was achieved between 600–2000 nm, which included >99% at 648–930 nm and 1088–1388 nm.
2. Experimental
Materials
The diblock copolymers of PS-b-PMMA were purchased from Polymer Source Inc. The number molecular weight, PMMA volume fraction and χN of these block copolymers are summarized in Table 1. The bulk PS/PMMA interaction parameter is χ = 0.037.19,20 The homopolymer PMMA with Mw = 1000 g mol−1 (PMMA1) and Mw = 100000 g mol−1 (PMMA2) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS, CH3(CH2)17SiCl3, 95%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Co. The solvents tetrahydrofuran, toluene and acetic acid were purchased from Beijing Chemical, China. The water used here was deionized water. The glass substrates were boiled in a Piranha solution (7/3 (v/v) of 98% H2SO4/30% H2O2) for 30 min to remove the stains on the surface, then washed with deionized water and dried with a nitrogen flow.

The modification of the glass substrates. 
The cleaned glass substrates were immersed in a 0.1% (v/v) solution of OTS in n-hexane. After 5 min they were removed from the OTS solution, washed with n-hexane several times, and dried with a N2 flow quickly.



Sample preparation
          . 
The mixtures of different copolymers and homopolymers (the copolymers with a molecular weight of 130000–133000 and 130000–360000 were blended with PMMA2. The other copolymers were blended with PMMA1.) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of THF and toluene (10 vol%) with four different concentrations (27, 36, 45 and 54 mg mL−1). The solutions were spin-coated onto the modified glass substrates at 3500 rpm for 30 s. After the solvent evaporated completely, all the films were irradiated by a UV lamp (model ZF-1, Shanghai Gucun Optic Instrument Factory, China) with the highest intensity at 365 nm for 3 h. The degraded PMMA was selectively removed by acetic acid for 1 h. Then the film was washed several times with deionized water, and dried with a N2 flow. To obtain the inner surface morphology, the specimen was etched for different lengths of time in a vacuum chamber with an O2 pressure of 150 mTorr and 50 W RF power. Under these conditions, the film was etched at a rate of ∼1.6 nm s−1. To measure the morphology of the bottom of the film, the porous film was hung in HF vapor for 5 min, and then floated on the water. The floated film was picked up by a hydrophobic silicon wafer with the bottom side up.

Characterization

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the surface topography of the spin-coated films. Images were obtained using a SPI3800N AFM (Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan) with a Si tip with a spring constant of 2 N m−1. The cantilevers were operated slightly below their resonance frequency of around 72 kHz. The image acquisition was performed under ambient conditions. The AFM was used in tapping mode to reduce tip-induced surface degradation and sample damage. Imaging was conducted in height mode.
The morphologies and the cross-sectional images of the porous film were investigated by a Micro FEI PHILIPS XL-30-ESEMFEG field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM).
Transmittance measurements in the spectral range 350–2000 nm were performed using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer.
The thickness of the nanoporous film on the silicon wafer was measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry over a wavelength range of 300–800 nm at a fixed incident angle of 70° using a UVISEL spectroscopic ellipsometer (Jobin Yvon, France).
3. Results and discussion
As we previously reported,15 a porous polymer film for broadband and omnidirectional antireflection was made from a block copolymer/homopolymer blend (PS-b-PMMA/PMMA). The use of an OTS modified glass substrate and a mixture of solvents made the PMMA domains form a gradient distribution in the vertical direction of the entire microphase separated film, rather than forming ordinary spherical, cylindrical or lamellar morphologies. After the PMMA domains were removed, a PS porous structure with a gradient porosity ratio in the vertical direction of the film was formed. A transmittance of >97% at both the visible and near-infrared (NIR) light range was achieved for this gradient refractive index structure. When the incidence angle was increased, the total transmittance at three different incidence angles was dramatically improved. In this paper, we further investigated the effects of the total degree of polymerization (N), the volume fraction of the PMMA block (fPMMA), the weight percentage of the homopolymer and the solution concentration on the gradient refractive index structures and broadband antireflection properties, and tried to get much higher broadband transmittance.
The effect of χN of the block copolymer on the mechanism of structure formation and AR properties
The self-assembly of block copolymer thin films with nanometre-sized domains could be controlled by the molecular weight (or the total degree of polymerization, N) and the segmental interaction parameter (χ).21–25 Theories that deal with block copolymer phase behavior can be divided into three categories (Table 1):26 for χN ≪ 10, diblock copolymers exist in a spatially homogeneous state and no microphase separation occurs. When χN ≈ 10 (M26–12, M18–18 and M25–26), disordered microstructures were changed into an ordered state, the size of randomly distributed nanodomains was too small to show a sharp boundary between different domains (Fig. 1a1, d1, e1). For M55–22, M26–68 and M68–33 with χN > 10, the films showed disordered worm-like microphase separation with sharper microdomain boundaries (Fig. 1b1, c1, f1). By increasing χN to 192.4 (M130–360, χN ≫ 10), the size of the microphase separation increased showing sharper microdomain boundaries (Fig. 1g1). Due to the large fPMMA of M26–68 and M130–360 (∼70%), the PMMA domains preferred to merge into protuberances (Fig. 1f1, g1) on the film surface because of the asymmetric boundary conditions and the impact of the solvent mixture.15

The scale bar of each figure is 2 μm × 2 μm. 
After removing the PMMA block, the change of molecular weight (N) also brought about the different gradient porosity ratio inner structures. For block copolymers with the same fPMMA, with increasing χN the size of nanopores became larger, the protuberances disappeared gradually and the gradient change in porosity became more obvious. For instance, M26–12, M55–22 and M68–33 had almost the same fPMMA, however, the surface morphologies and inner structures were different after the removal of the PMMA domains. When the molecular weight was M26–12, semicircular protuberances were tangled with polymer network of 10–40 nm nanopores (Fig. 2a1) on the air–film surface, and the inner structure was compact, also with protuberances on the section side (Fig. 2a1′). For the M55–22 (Fig. 2b1), the boundary of the nanopores was more distinct with a size of 20–30 nm, and these pores were distributed randomly in a matrix of residual PS. As for M68–33, the nanoporous film formed a network with nanopores of 20–50 nm without protuberances (Fig. 2c1). To determine the inner structure we treated the microphase-separated film before UV degradation with O2 plasma, which can etch the film from the surface with an accuracy on the nanometre scale.27,28 After treating with O2 plasma for 60 s and 120 s at a rate of ∼1.6 nm s−1, and then removing the PMMA domains to get the inner surface images (Fig. 3a2–a3, b2–b3, c2–c3), the nanopores became fewer and smaller than before O2 plasma etching and the nanopores on the bottom of the film (Fig. 3a4, b4, c4) were the smallest (10–30 nm) and fewest in number. The surface porosity ratio of each layer of the film was obtained by statistical calculation and labeled in Fig. 3. The gradient porosity ratio structure of M68–33 was more obvious than M26–12 and M55–22 because of the larger difference in the porosity ratio between the top and bottom surfaces.

The above films were then etched by O2 plasma with different exposure times: (a2, b2, c2) 60 s, (a3, b3, c3) 120 s. The etching rate is determined to be ∼1.6 nm s−1.

It was the gradient porosity ratio structure inside the film that determined broadband AR properties. For the copolymers with nearly the same fPMMA, increasing N led to the porous film achieving better broadband AR performance. As for M18–18, M25–26 and M130–133 blended with 20 wt% homopolymer, the mean transmittance values increased as the χN values increased from 13.0, 18.4 to 95.0 (Table 2), and the same tendency was achieved at three concentrations. The block copolymers of M26–12, M55–22 and M68–33, with 30 wt% and 40 wt% additional homopolymer showed this tendency more obviously (Table 3). These results illustrated a synergistic effect between the evaporation of the solvent mixture and the kinetics of the microphase separation.29,30 First of all, with the help of the fast evaporation of THF during spin-coating and the residual solvent toluene, which evaporated continuously, the copolymer (PMMA block) and homopolymer (PMMA) chains moved to adjust the distribution of the PMMA domains in the vertical direction of the whole film. Secondly, it is well known that the increase of χN would induce the increase of the microphase separation size. While χ is not dependent on molecular weight, χN increases with molecular weight and the copolymer is in the strong segregation regime. With increasing N the driving force for phase separation increases,31,32 and the bigger size of the micro-domains makes the movement of the PMMA chains more facile and avoids the entanglement of PS chains. Microphase separation was a local process, requiring only short-range motions of the chains, causing the diffusive process of the chains to become progressively slower with increasing N. So if the additional homopolymer was more than 30 wt% or the fPMMA was more than ∼45%, the block copolymer with a larger N would keep the more stable PS porous structure from collapsing.

The effect of the PMMA fraction on the mechanism of structure formation and AR properties
For the system with strong phase separation of the diblock copolymer AB, the distribution of micro-domains could be tailored by the volume fraction of PMMA in the block copolymer (fPMMA).33,34 When fPMMA < 1/2 (M26–12, M55–22 and M68–33), the smaller PMMA blocks were packed into the interiors of a continuous phase of block PS. After removing the PMMA component, nanopores were distributed randomly in a matrix of residual PS (Fig. 2a1, b1, c1). When increasing fPMMA to 1/2, self-assembly of the symmetric linear diblock led to a lamellar morphology. Also, around fPMMA = 1/2 (M18–18, M25–26 and M130–133) another equilibrium morphology, called the bicontinuous phase (or Gyroid), existed with both PS and PMMA blocks in the films being continuously distributed. So after removing the PMMA domains, the inner structure of the whole porous film formed an interpenetrating polymer network, which was the most obvious for M130–133 (Fig. 2d, e).15 Increasing the volume fraction of the PMMA block (fPMMA > 1/2) induced interfacial curvature, resulting in the smaller PS blocks packed into the interiors of a continuous phase of block PMMA. After removing the PMMA, the pore size of M130–360 was more than 500 nm and the substrate was exposed at 27 mg mL−1 (inner image of Fig. 2g). As the concentration increased to 45 mg mL−1 the residual discontinuous PS block could collapse without the support of the PMMA block (Fig. 2f, f′, g, g′).
To further regulate the distribution and size of the nanopores, different additional weights of homopolymer were used. By adding the homopolymer PMMA, whose molecular weight was smaller than the PMMA block, the homopolymer tended to selectively and uniformly distribute throughout the corresponding block copolymer microdomain, causing changes in the initial surface morphology and separation size.19 When the additional weight of the homopolymer increased, the worm-like pattern gradually disappeared and the PMMA components on the film surface increased and merged into protuberances (Fig. 1a2–a4, b2–b4, c2–c4). After removing the PMMA domains, the size of the nanopores gradually increased (Fig. 2a2–a4, b2–b4, c2–c4), the nanopores on the section side became more and more clear, and the film thickness decreased compared to the film without the homopolymer due to the collapse after removing many more PMMA domains (Fig. 2a2′–a4′, b2′–b4′, c2′–c4′). The nanopore sizes of M26–12 increased from 10–40 nm to 30–100 nm by increasing the weight percent of the homopolymer from 0 wt% to 40 wt%. For M55–22 and M68–33 increasing the addition of the homopolymer also led to enlargement of the nanopores, while the network structure on the surface did not change a lot. Especially, when the addition of homopolymer was 40 wt%, there were large nanopores of 200 nm on the surface, as well as the small ones of 20–50 nm, which may induce light scattering in the visible light range.
Different broadband antireflective properties in the full spectrum range (350–2000 nm) were achieved by means of tuning the volume fraction of the PMMA block (fPMMA) and the weight percentage of the homopolymer. The mean transmittance decreased by increasing fPMMA from ∼25%, ∼45% to ∼70% at three different concentrations (27 mg mL−1, 36 mg mL−1 and 45 mg mL−1), respectively (Fig. 4). The bare glass substrate has a transmittance of ∼92% in the spectral range 350–2000 nm, which was also given in figures for comparison. For the concentration 27 mg mL−1 (Fig. 4a), the mean transmittance decreased from 97.5% for M26–12 (fPMMA = 26.9%) to 94.7% for M26–68 (fPMMA = 68.0%), although the mean transmittance of M130–133 (fPMMA ∼45.0%) was higher than M18–18 and M25–26 (97.1% and 97.5%, respectively). When the concentration was up to 36 mg mL−1 (Fig. 4b), the overall mean transmittance increased slightly compared to 27 mg mL−1. Under these conditions, the mean transmittance value of M130–133 decreased dramatically to 96.3% and maintained the same trend of other block copolymer with fPMMA = ∼45%. When the concentration was 45 mg mL−1 (Fig. 4c), the overall mean transmittance continued to increase, while the value of M18–18 (fPMMA = 44.8%) decreased much more with decreasing fPMMA caused by reduced mean transmittance. The mean transmittance values of block copolymers with fPMMA = ∼45% and ∼70%, which were between 93.5% and 96.5% at three concentrations, were lower than the copolymers of fPMMA ≈ 25% (Table 2). Based on the above transmittance results, the M26–12, M55–22 and M68–33 (fPMMA = ∼25%) were chosen for different additional weights of homopolymer PMMA (Fig. 5). The mean transmittance values of M55–22 and M26–12 decreased slightly as the homopolymer weight increased from 20 wt% to 40 wt%. While M68–33 obtained broadband high transmittance when 30 wt% homopolymer was added at three concentrations (Fig. 5a, b, c): >97.0% transmittance at 27 mg mL−1 between 483–1901 nm, and >98.0% transmittance at 36 mg mL−1 between 444–1981 nm. Especially at 45 mg mL−1, >98% high transmittance between 600–1977 nm, which included >99% at 648–930 nm and 1088–1388 nm, was obtained. The mean transmittance of M68–33 decreased with the addition of 40 wt% PMMA (Table 3). The incident light at certain angles was selectively reflected from the plane of the porous film, so the appearance of a purple color was observed in these films. To appreciate the AR properties more directly, photographs of glass substrates with and without AR films are shown in Fig. 5g. When exposed to sunlight, the bare glass substrate (Fig. 5g1) reflected the sunlight strongly. The AR films from different molecular weight copolymers all demonstrated AR properties and the color of the words were also clearly distinguished (Fig. 5g2–4).

Note that both sides of the glass substrates were coated with the porous films and the incident light was normal. (g) Photographs of glass substrates exposed to sunlight: (g1) a glass substrate without any film coated; (g2–4) glasses with both sides covered with PS porous films of M68–33, M55–22 and M26–12, respectively. 
The effect of different structures on the broadband AR properties could be explained as follows: the amount of the PMMA domains removed increased with fPMMA, so that the size of nanopores would be increased after the removal of PMMA domains; and the cross-linking of PS generally caused an inner volume contraction of the continuous PS matrix due to the covalent coupling of adjacent chains.35 With increased fPMMA, the above two reasons contributed to the collapse of the residual PS structure and the destruction of the gradient porosity ratio inner structure, therefore the light transmittance decreased due to the light scattering or absorption from the nanoporous structures. An exception occurred at 27 mg mL−1 where the mean transmittance value of M130–133 was as good as M26–12. This was because the N value of M130–133 was big enough to maintain the residual PS structure in the film, and due to the symmetric block structure the continuous PS matrix was stable enough to avoid collapsing.
Meanwhile, the polymer with a lower molecular weight has high solubility and the movement of the polymer chains is much easier.36,37 After adding appropriate homopolymer PMMA, whose molecular weight was lower than the PMMA chains of the copolymer PS-b-PMMA, the homopolymer chains migrated to the free surface to adjust the distribution of PMMA domains in the vertical direction of the entire film during the continuous evaporation of solvents. As shown in Table 2, the best mean transmittance values were always obtained when the addition of homopolymer PMMA was between 20 wt% and 30 wt% for different molecular weights. If the amount added was not enough, the movement of PMMA cannot achieve good gradient distribution; while if much more homopolymer was added, the gradient porosity ratio structure would collapse and big nanopores would induce light scattering after the removal of the PMMA domains. So the satisfactory amount of homopolymer was between 20 wt% and 30 wt%.
The influence of solution concentration on the AR properties
According to optical theory,6 broadband AR coating of multilayer film should satisfy the condition that the refractive index of each layer increases from top to bottom. When the number of intermediate layers is extended to be infinite, 0% reflection at full wavelength could be achieved. Herein the gradient refractive index porous film was a continuous transition from a low to a high refractive index, so an optimum film thickness was required for keeping this continuous transition of refractive index.
In our experiment, the film thickness was regulated by solution concentration. For the same block copolymer, the mean transmittance value was increased by increasing the solution concentration (Table 2). For example, when the film thickness of M68–33 with 30 wt% PMMA increased from 154 nm (27 mg mL−1), 233 nm (36 mg mL−1) to 348 nm (45 mg mL−1), the mean transmittance increased from 97.1%, 98.1% to 98.4%. It was the film thickness that ensured the distance for the distribution of PMMA domains in the vertical direction, so the increase in the amount of PMMA microdomains from the substrate/film interface to the film/air interface would be more continuous and the gradient porosity ratio structure would be more precise. When the solution concentration increased to 54 mg mL−1, the film looked a little white and misty gray because the thickness of the film was so large that it induced light scattering.
4. Conclusions
In summary, through spin-coating of a PS-b-PMMA/PMMA blend in a mixed solvent onto an OTS-modified substrate and then selectively removing PMMA domains, a PS film with a gradient refractive index structure was achieved. By changing the volume fraction of one block, the total degree of polymerization and the additional amount of homopolymer, we obtained different surface morphologies and gradient refractive index inner structures. The influence of these structures on the broadband antireflective properties was as follows: when the addition of homopolymer PMMA was 20 wt%, the mean transmittance value decreased at three concentrations with increasing fPMMA from ∼25%, 45% to 70%. For the copolymers with nearly the same fPMMA, increasing N and keeping the amount of homopolymer between 20 wt% and 30 wt%, the porous film would achieve better broadband AR performance; as for the same block copolymer, the mean transmittance value improved by increasing the solution concentration from 27 mg mL−1 to 45 mg mL−1.
