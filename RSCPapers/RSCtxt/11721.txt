    , Accepted 18th November 2019First published on 19th November 2019AbstractTwo conjugated polymers (PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T), differing only in their conjugated backbones with thiophene (T) units in the latter and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units in the former, were synthesized and applied in non-fullerene (NF) polymer solar cells (PSCs). The two polymers displayed similar absorption profiles in solutions and films at room temperature, but PBTCO-TT in solution showed a stronger temperature-dependent aggregation than PBTCO-T. Cyclic voltammetry and density functional calculations confirmed similar molecular energy levels for the two polymers (HOMO/LUMO of −5.41/−3.56 eV for PBTCO-TT and −5.43/−3.55 eV for PBTCO-T). After blending each of these polymers with a NF ITIC acceptor, the resulting PBTCO-TT:ITIC film showed a significantly greater surface roughness and stronger aggregation than the resulting PBTCO-T:ITIC film. In NF PSCs, the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based PSC only gave a PCE of 5.31%, with a VOC of 0.881 V, JSC of 13.01 mA cm−2 and FF of 46.31%, while the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based PSC showed a significantly higher PCE of 10.40% with imultaneous improvement of the VOC to 0.959 V, of the JSC to 16.21 mA cm−2 and of the FF to 66.89%.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn extensive attention because of their advantages in the development of lightweight, flexible and large-area photovoltaic devices.1–4 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of PSCs is composed of a conjugated polymer as the electron donor and small molecule as the electron acceptor. In the past few decades, fullerene derivatives have been widely used as electron-accepting materials in BHJ PSCs because of their advantages of high electron affinities, high electron mobilities, and isotropic electron transport properties.5–7 Although power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of as high as 11.7% have been achieved using fullerene-based single-junction PSCs,8 the weak ability of fullerene-based acceptors to absorb light in the long-wavelength region and large voltage losses of the resulting photovoltaic devices have limited further improvement of the PCEs of fullerene-based PSCs. To overcome the drawbacks of fullerene-based acceptors, much research has been focused on developing novel non-fullerene (NF) acceptors.9–11 Since NF acceptor of ITIC was reported by Zhan and coworkers in 2015,12 PCEs of greater than 16% have been achieved for single-junction NF-based PSCs.13–15 Regardless of whether fullerene derivatives or NF-based acceptors are used in PSCs, a favorable BHJ morphology always plays a crucial role in achieving a high PCE of the resulting device.16 Unlike spheroidal fullerene-based acceptors, high-performance NF electron acceptors have anisotropic electron transport properties, due to their planar conjugated backbones.17 Since the polymer donor and NF acceptors have similar conjugated backbones, it becomes more challenging to form nanoscale bi-continuous phase separation between the NF acceptor and polymer donor than between a fullerene-based acceptor and polymer donor. Hence, the blending of a polymer donor with a fullerene acceptor could yield a BHJ morphology and PSC efficiency quite different than those resulting from the blending of the same polymer donor with an NF acceptor.18,19 Thus, to obtain efficient NF PSCs, it is very important to develop novel polymer donors with the purpose of optimizing the BHJ morphologies, and to study and determine the relationships between the polymer structures, BHJ morphologies and photovoltaic performances.
Several cases of highly efficient NF PSCs were achieved when the appropriate matching donor polymer was chosen. These kinds of donor polymers require not only matched energy levels and complementary absorption spectra with NF acceptors, but also suitable aggregation behavior in solution to form favorable phase-separation with NF acceptors. Considering that their molecular skeletons have a big impact on their aggregation properties and BHJ morphologies,20–28 the tuning of polymer backbones could be an important strategy to use to control their aggregation properties, and thus achieve optimized BHJ morphologies and device performances in NF PSCs. For example (the corresponding polymer structures are listed in Fig. 1), Yan and coworkers reported a highly planar polymer, PffBT4T, which exhibited a PCE of 6.6% in NF PSCs. When benzene units were introduced into the conjugated backbone, the resulting new polymer PffBT4T-B showed a slightly twisted conjugated backbone. After blending with an NF acceptor, a favorable BHJ morphology and high PCE (9.4%) were obtained.29 In work reported by our group, the polymer PBDD4T, which yielded a PCE of 0.92% in NF PSCs, had F atoms introduced into its conjugated backbone to obtain the more planar and strongly aggregating polymer PBDD4T-2F, which yielded a remarkably increased PCE of 8.2% in NF PSCs.30 Zhou and coworkers used alkylated thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) to replace thiophene (T) in polymers J61 to obtain the more planar and strongly aggregating polymer PE1, and this process improved the PCE from 8.30% to 8.43% in NF PSCs.31 In other words, it is difficult to predict whether twisted or planar conjugated polymers show more suitable aggregation behavior to produce better BHJ morphologies, and yield higher PCEs in NF PSCs. Therefore, the tuning of conjugated backbone geometries is very important for novel polymers to achieve highly efficient NF PSCs.

In this work, we designed and synthesized two polymer donors, PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T (Scheme 1), based on BDT and oligothiophene but with different linkers, T in the latter polymer and TT in the former, between two carbonylated thiophene units. The two polymers displayed similar absorption profiles and energy levels, but different temperature-dependent aggregation behavior in solution. Both polymers were blended with ITIC to fabricate PSC devices. The resulting PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based device exhibited a PCE of 5.31%. The twisting of the conjugated backbone was increased by replacing TT with T in PBTCO-T, and the resulting PBTCO-T:ITIC-based device showed a higher PCE, of 10.40%. This big difference between their PCEs was carefully analyzed by studying their conjugated backbone geometries, aggregation behavior and BHJ morphologies.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to both polymers are shown in Scheme 1. Monomer 4 was prepared from 1-(2-bromothiophen-3-yl)-3-ethylheptan-1-one (1) by carrying out two sequential reactions: a Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling followed by a bromination. Finally, the target conjugated polymers PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T were synthesized by carrying out Stille coupling reactions of (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (5) with monomers 4 and 6, respectively. To obtain similar molecular weights, the polymerization times were set at 20 and 24 h for PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T, respectively. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) values of the PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T polymers were found to be 18.7 and 18.6 kg mol−1 with corresponding polydispersity indexes (Đ) of 2.0 and 2.1, respectively. Both polymers displayed good solubility levels in chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. Additionally, the thermal stabilities of the polymers were measured by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 1. The PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T polymers both exhibited excellent thermal stabilities, with 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) of 442 and 456 °C, respectively.

Optical, electrochemical properties and density functional theory calculations
Ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of both polymers were recorded in diluted chlorobenzene solutions and films, as shown in Fig. 2a. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. In diluted chlorobenzene solutions, the PBTCO-TT and PBCO-T polymers showed maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) values at 495 and 475 nm, respectively, at 100 °C. Surprisingly, when the solutions were cooled to room temperature, the two polymers exhibited similar absorption profiles, with a λmax value of 545 nm. This phenomenon may have been due to the different aggregation behaviour of the two polymers. The films of both polymers were prepared by spin-coating them from chlorobenzene solutions. The λmax values of the PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T polymers in the film state were slightly red-shifted, by 3 and 8 nm, respectively, compared with those in solution. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T were calculated to be 1.85 and 1.86 eV, respectively, according to the onset of the solid-state absorption. In order to understand their aggregation behavior in solution, we carried out UV-Vis experiments for both polymers in chlorobenzene solutions at various temperatures. The absorption spectra at various temperatures for both polymers are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the relative aggregation strengths are displayed in Fig. 2b. When the solution temperature was gradually increased, the absorption intensity of PBTCO-TT slowly decreased compared to that of PBTCO-T; at 90 °C, aggregation of PBTCO-TT still occurred but no aggregation was indicated for PBTCO-T, which implied a stronger tendency for PBTCO-TT than for PBTCO-T to aggregate in solution. These results suggested that tuning the conformation of the conjugated backbone by replacing TT with T weakly influenced the absorption spectrum of the polymer in chlorobenzene solutions (room temperature) and films, but strongly influenced the aggregation behavior.

The dashed dotted, dashed and solid lines represent the absorption at 100 °C, room temperature, and as films, respectively. (b) Plots of “relative aggregation strength” versus solution temperature. The relative aggregation strength at any given temperature was derived from the absorption intensity of the polymer (peak at 545 nm) at that temperature relative to the absorption intensity of the polymer at 0 °C. 
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of both polymers were estimated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements.32 The oxidation curves of both polymers are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. On the basis of the onset of oxidation potentials, the HOMO levels were estimated to be −5.41 and −5.43 eV for PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T were calculated to be −3.56 and −3.55 eV, respectively, according to the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg.33 It should be noted that these LUMO levels were expected to be lower than those of values from CV measurements, due to the existence of exciton bonding energy. In any case, the energy levels of both polymer donors were well matched with those of ITIC (ELUMO, −3.78 eV and EHOMO, −5.51 eV).12

To understand the conjugated backbone geometries and energy levels of both polymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on trimers of each polymer. Both trimers were optimized with a Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31g (d, p) level.34 As shown in Fig. 3b, the three units of the trimer of PBTCO-TT showed twist angles of 12.8°, 25.0° and 25.6°, respectively. After replacing the TT units with T units, the resulting trimer of PBTCO-T exhibited a more twisted conjugated backbone with angles of 15.0°, 34.3° and 23.7°, respectively. Additionally, the DFT calculations gave HOMO/LUMO levels of −4.91/−2.62 and −4.93/−2.59 eV, with corresponding bandgaps of 2.29 and 2.34 eV for PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T, respectively, in agreement with the CV and UV-Vis absorption measurements.
Photovoltaic performances
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the polymers, the PSCs were fabricated using a conventional device structure, specifically ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:ITIC/PFN-Br/Al. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating a polymer:ITIC chlorobenzene solution. The PSCs were carefully optimized using various donor/acceptor weight ratios (w/w), 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) volume ratios (v/v) and annealing temperatures as shown in Tables S1–S6 (ESI†). The acquired current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal PSCs are shown in Fig. 4a, and the related data are summarized in Table 2. The PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based PSC gave a PCE of 5.31%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.881 V, short-circuit current density (JSC) of 13.01 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 46.31%. After increasing the twist of the conjugated backbone by using T to replace TT in PBTCO-TT, the resulting PBTCO-T:ITIC-based PSC showed a significantly higher PCE of 10.40% with simultaneous improvement in the photovoltaic parameters, specifically with a VOC of 0.959 V, JSC of 16.21 mA cm−2 and FF of 66.89%. The HOMO offset of each polymer was determined to be only 0.02 eV, but the lower VOC in the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based device could be attributed to its unfavorable BHJ morphology due to the strengthening of the intermolecular interactions in PBTCO-TT.35–37 External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were also taken from the optimized PSCs. As shown in Fig. 4b, the integrated JSC values were calculated to be 12.45 and 15.41 mA cm−2 for the PBTCO-TT:ITIC- and PBTCO-T:ITIC-based PSCs, respectively, consistent with the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurement results.

Charge generation, transport and recombination
To understand the effects of the TT and T units in the conjugated backbones on exciton dissociation and charge transport in these blends, measurements on photogenerated current density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) and space-charge-limited current (SCLC) were carried out.38 The exciton dissociation probability is defined as Pdiss = Jph/Jsat. The photogenerated current density (Jph) was calculated according to the equation Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the light and dark current densities, respectively. Jsat denotes the saturation photocurrent density. The effective voltage (Veff) stands for the difference between the compensation voltage (V0, determined for a Jph of zero) and the applied voltage (V1). As shown in Fig. S3,† when the Veff was less than 1 V, the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based device yielded a higher Jph than the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based device under short-circuit conditions. When Jsat was taken from a Veff of 5 V, Pdiss was calculated to be 60.62% for the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based device and 80.55% for the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based device. This result was in agreement with the J–V measurements showing a higher Jsc value for the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based device than for the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based device.
The electron and hole mobility (μe and μh) values of the PBTCO-TT:ITIC- and PBTCO-T:ITIC-based films were measured using the SCLC method (Fig. 5a and b).39 The μe of the PBTCO-T:ITIC film was 3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, about two times higher than that of the PBTCO-TT:ITIC film (1.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). At the same time, the μh of the PBTCO-T:ITIC film was 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that of the PBTCO-TT:ITIC film (2.11 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). More importantly, the ratio of μe/μh was found to be more balanced for the PBTCO-T:ITIC film (3.3) than for the PBTCO-TT:ITIC film (93.4). The high and balanced charge carrier mobilities of the PBTCO-T:ITIC film were vital for facilitating charge transport and collection, thus yielding a higher JSC and FF than those of the PBTCO-TT:ITIC film.

To understand the charge recombination in these two devices, we analysed the effects of light intensity (Plight) on VOC and JSC. Plots of VOCversus Plight for the PBTCO-TT:ITIC and PBTCO-T:ITIC-based PSCs are shown in Fig. 5c.40–42 In such plots, slopes of 2kT/q and kT/q represent monomolecular and bimolecular recombinations, respectively. PBTCO-TT:ITIC and PBTCO-T:ITIC-based PSCs showed similar slopes of 1.11 and 1.08kT/q, respectively, which revealed bimolecular recombination to be dominant in both PSCs. The relationship between Plight and JSC is described by the formula JSC ∝ (Plight)S, where S stands for the extent of the bimolecular recombination. Plots of JSCversus Plight for these two PSCs are shown in Fig. 5d. The slope of the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based PSC plot was measured to be 0.957, higher than that of the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based device (0.935). These results were consistent the higher FF for the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based device than for the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based device.
Blend morphologies and microstructures
To further understand the difference between the JSC, FF and charge carrier mobility values of the two polymer-based devices, we investigated the organization of blends and surface morphologies of pure polymer and blend films using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based film showed a strong chain-to-chain diffraction peak at 4.63° (1.93 nm) and extremely weak π–π stacking peak. In contrast, the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based film showed a weak chain-to-chain diffraction peak at 4.51° (1.95 nm) and a strong π–π diffraction peak at 24.12° (ca. 0.37 nm). These results revealed the high crystallinity of the PBTCO-TT:ITIC film, but its weak charge transfer ability compared to that of the PBTCO-T:ITIC film. These results helped explain the higher hole and electron mobilities of the PBTCO-T:ITIC film than of the PBTCO-TT:ITIC film. The nanoscale morphologies of the pure polymer and blend films are shown in Fig. 6. Root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness values of PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T were measured from their topography images to be 0.64 and 0.93 nm, respectively. After blending PBTCO-TT with ITIC, the RMS surface roughness value of the resulting PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based film sharply increased to 9.06 nm, and the film showed obvious aggregation characteristics, features detrimental for exciton dissociation and charge transfer. In contrast, the PBTCO-T:ITIC film showed only a slightly higher RMS surface roughness (1.51 nm) and a favourable BHJ morphology, results similar to those for our previously reported polymers with the similar conjugated backbones.43,44 These features were beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transfer, explaining the better Pdiss and charge carrier mobilities of the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based PSCs than of the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based PSCs.

Conclusions
We synthesized and characterized two conjugated polymers, PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T, with the only difference between them being the presence of TT units in the conjugated backbone of the former and T units in the latter. Both polymers displayed good solubility levels in common organic solvents. These quite similar looking polymers displayed similar absorption profiles in solutions and films at room temperature, but quite different aggregation properties in solution and quite different photovoltaic efficiencies. Replacing the TT unit of PBTCO-TT with the T unit to form PBTCO-T resulted in weak aggregation in solution due to the greater torsions in the conjugated backbone. Such aggregation behaviour of PBTCO-T drove it to form a better BHJ morphology with ITIC than was formed by PBTCO-TT. In comparison to the PBTCO-TT:ITIC film, the PBTCO-T:ITIC film exhibited stronger π–π stacking, a lower crystallization ability and smoother surface, which significantly improved exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in higher JSC and FF values for the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based device. Therefore, while the PBTCO-TT:ITIC-based PSC showed a low PCE of 5.31%, the PBTCO-T:ITIC-based PSC exhibited a nearly two-fold greater PCE, of 10.40%. This work demonstrated that tuning the conjugated backbones is an effective method to control polymer aggregation properties and optimize BHJ morphologies for improving PSC efficiency.

 	Fig. 1  Molecular structures of polymers for NF PSCs.	 

 	Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T.	 



PBTCO-TT
	18.7/37.2	442	545	548	1.85	−5.41	−3.56	−4.91	−2.62

PBTCO-T
	18.6/39.1	456	545	553	1.87	−5.43	−3.55	−4.93	−2.58

 	Fig. 2  (a) UV-Vis absorption spectra of both polymers in chlorobenzene solutions and films. The dashed dotted, dashed and solid lines represent the absorption at 100 °C, room temperature, and as films, respectively. (b) Plots of “relative aggregation strength” versus solution temperature. The relative aggregation strength at any given temperature was derived from the absorption intensity of the polymer (peak at 545 nm) at that temperature relative to the absorption intensity of the polymer at 0 °C.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Cyclic voltammogram curves of the polymer films, and (b) the conjugated backbone geometries of trimers of PBTCO-TT and PBTCO-T.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) J–V and (b) EQE curves of the optimized PBTCO-TT:ITIC- and PBTCO-T:ITIC-based devices.	 



PBTCO-TT:ITIC	0.880 ± 0.002 (0.881)	13.11 ± 0.13 (13.01)	45.85 ± 0.82 (46.31)	5.29 ± 0.08 (5.31)

PBTCO-T:ITIC	0.958 ± 0.002 (0.959)	16.15 ± 0.16 (16.21)	66.41 ± 0.60 (66.89)	10.28 ± 0.14 (10.40)

 	Fig. 5  (a) Hole mobilities, (b) electron mobilities, and (c, d) plots of (c) VOC and (d) JSCversus light intensity for the optimized PBTCO-TT:ITIC- and PBTCO-T:ITIC-based devices.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a–d) AFM height images of (a) PBTCO-TT, (b) PBTCO-T, (c) PBTCO-TT:ITIC and (d) PBTCO-T:ITIC films. (e–h) Phase images of (e) PBTCO-TT, (f) PBTCO-T, (g) PBTCO-TT:ITIC and (h) PBTCO-T:ITIC films.
