    , Accepted 27th March 2020First published on 30th March 2020AbstractOvercoming fill factor (FF) decay in thick fullerene active layers has been demonstrated with high hole mobility (μh) polymers. However, this issue remains a challenge for thick active layers with nonfullerene acceptors. Here we demonstrate a high FF and highly efficient nonfullerene based thick active layer with a high μh polymer as the donor. Its relatively balanced hole and electron transport with a μh/μe ratio of 4.42 in a 320 nm thick blend film is realized by the high molecular weight polymer induced higher electron mobility (μe approaching 1 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1) for the blend film. Relative to the pristine IEICO-4F nonfullerene film, 8 times increased μe for the blend film corresponds to closer interdigitation of the IEICO-4F lamella and a higher order face-on orientation of the in-plane (200) peak of IEICO-4F molecules, which are very helpful for electron transport. As a result, solar cells with 320 nm thick binary nonfullerene active layers show an outstanding FF of over 70% and a power conversion efficiency of 13.2%, a breakthrough for high μh polymers as the donor. Our results suggest that high μh polymer donors are promising candidates for nonfullerene based polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure have been regarded as next-generation solar cells due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and rapid energy payback time.1–5 Emerging as a new dawn in the PSC field, nonfullerene polymer solar cells with small molecular nonfullerene acceptors have attracted great attention6–22 and over 17% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) can be achieved.23–28 It should be noted that most nonfullerene PSCs usually display the best device performances with active layer films of about 100 nm thickness.21,29 However, despite materials saving, a thickness of 100 nm for the active layer is not optimal for the processing on a continuous roll-to-roll line. The major drawback is that selection of 100 nm as the average thickness would obviously limit the expansion of a processing window,30,31 resulting in a small processing window (e.g. 100 ± 30 nm) and a low printing speed. Meanwhile, an active layer with a thin thickness of 100 nm is not so sufficient to suppress pin-holes on a large-area flexible substrate if compared with using a thick active layer.30–34 Reproducible fabrication of highly efficient PSCs is an important guarantee for yield control on a large-scale production line.32,35 Consequently, using a thicker active layer of more than 200 nm as the average thickness would be beneficial for the expansion of the processing window, e.g., thickness control of 300 ± 200 nm may supply a large processing window and would be better to achieve pin-hole free printing at a high speed. This lies on the premise that high efficiency could surely be delivered with such a large thickness variation. Therefore, it is desirable to develop highly efficient nonfullerene based thick active layers and evaluate their possible processing window towards large-scale production of PSCs.
A thicker blend film normally has very little effect on the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs and even absorbs incident light more sufficiently, supplying a chance to further enhance the short-circuit current density (Jsc). So far, maintaining a high fill factor (FF) for a PSC with a 300 nm thick nonfullerene based active layer has been a big challenge, particularly achieving a high FF of more than 70%.10 Even for the state-of-the-art PM6:Y6 blend films,21 PSCs showed FF values of 74.8% and 62.3% for 150 and 300 nm thick active layers, respectively, leading to a thickness induced FF decay of 16.7%. In the literature, many fullerene based active layers of more than 300 nm thickness could display a high FF of ∼75%.30,36–39 In a recent report,40 a 380 nm thick ternary all-polymer active layer with polymer N2200 as the acceptor, which is a rare case, shows an FF of 72.1% and a PCE of 10.4% for a 0.04 cm2 aperture area, where N2200 can display a high electron mobility (μe) in field-effect transistors (OFETs). The relatively lower FF values for most 300 nm thick nonfullerene active layers are probably due to the less sufficient carrier transport, particularly coming from the small molecular nonfullerene acceptors. Currently, the design of a nonfullerene acceptor with high μe that can compete with a fullerene derivative such as PC61BM or PC71BM is still a challenging task. For example, based on the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, PC71BM can show a high μe of up to 8.5 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 in blend films30,31 compared with that from 10−5 to 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 for many nonfullerene blend films.12–14,16,17 Even for Y6, its blend films of different thicknesses display largely varied μe values from 1.31 × 10−6 to 3.56 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1.21,26,28,29 For this, researchers have tried alternative methods. In a recent report by Hou, et al., one order of magnitude enhanced μe of the nonfullerene acceptor IT-4F was achieved from a volatilizable solid additive in the active layer, which was removed through high temperature thermal annealing at 140 °C for 10 min.41 The higher electron transport could significantly improve the FF from ∼50% to ∼67% for the IT-4F based active layers of 300–400 nm thicknesses. With minor PC61BM as the second acceptor to enhance electron transport, a 300 nm thick ternary blend film based on PBDB-T-2Cl:BTP-4F:PC61BM could show a much higher FF of 66.7% compared with that of 54.1% for the PBDB-T-2Cl:BTP-4F binary blend film.29 However, further increasing the film thickness to 400 nm for the ternary active layer also encountered a low FF of 53.1%, indicating certain limitations of this method in the expansion of a high efficiency processing window.29
We are interested in developing high hole mobility (μh) polymer donors with strong interchain aggregation ability for efficient thick-film PSCs,30,35,42–45 among which narrow band gap FBT-Th4(1,4)35 and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% (ref. 30) (Si25 in Fig. 1a) comprising a notable skeleton of 5,6-difluoro[2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (FBT) and quarterthiophene (4T) can exhibit a very high μh of 1.92 and 2.46 cm2 (V s)−1 in OFETs, respectively. With PFBT4T as the donor, polymer:fullerene binary PSCs reached historical ceiling efficiencies of 11–12%, with an outstanding FF of ∼75% for 300–400 nm thick active layers.30,36–38,46 Researchers have investigated some nonfullerene active layers with PFBT4T polymers as the donor. Early reports focused on PFBT4T based thin nonfullerene active layers of 70–150 nm, whose PSCs showed FFs between 57% and 62% and PCEs between 6.3% and 10%.47–49 Recently, we employed a high μh PFBT4T polymer Si25 bearing a 25% siloxane-terminated side chain to pair with a nonfullerene acceptor O-IDTBR, whose 400 nm thick active layer displayed an efficiency jump to 11.54%.50 The Si25 based PSCs could deliver a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V and a high Jsc of 21.11 mA cm−2 in the meantime, showing significantly suppressed Jsc–Voc trade-off in the high Voc region. Unfortunately, the high μh Si25 combined with the O-IDTBR with a low electron mobility (μe) resulted in very unbalanced carrier transport (μh/μe = 140 for a 400 nm thick blend film) and severe bimolecular recombination, leading to a very low FF of 53.07% for the 400 nm thick active layer. It should be mentioned that the high μh Si25 based thick active layers from 210 to 560 nm showed very limited FF decay from 53.79% to 51.59%. Generally, in combination with nonfullerene acceptors, so far a PFBT4T polymer has not been able to display its remarkable benefit of high hole mobility in achieving a high FF for resulting thick-film PSCs.

In this work, we report the FF stride over 70% for a 320 nm thick binary active layer with a small molecular nonfullerene acceptor, which is composed of high μh Si25 and IEICO-4F (Fig. 1a). Three Si25 polymers Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 with largely varied molecular weights (Mn) from 12.7 to 105.6 kg mol−1 and an almost comparable polydispersity index (PDI) between 2.13 and 2.32 were compared. In the literature, pristine films of Si25-H2 and IEICO-4F showed a μh of 3.3 × 10−2 and a μe of 1.14 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively, all evaluated by the SCLC method.30,51 For several reported polymer:IEICO-4F blend films, the μe values were between 4.56 × 10−5 and 1.72 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1, also close to that of the pristine IEICO-4F film.52 A simple concern is that the two orders of magnitude higher μh for Si25-H2 relative to the low μe for IEICO-4F would generate very unbalanced carrier transport for their blend film and would probably encounter the case of Si25-H2 and O-IDTBR in our previous report again.50 To this end, using Si25-L or Si25-H1 with a lower Mn as the donor might afford a not so high μh as for Si25-H2, which would provide a chance to modify the hole and electron transport of active layers when paired with the IEICO-4F acceptor. For the real results, polymers Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 displayed SCLC μh values of 2.15 × 10−3, 3.76 × 10−3, and 4.08 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 in the 320 nm thick blend films, respectively, confirming our hypothesis that a Si25 polymer with a higher Mn would show a higher μh. Unexpectedly, the SCLC μe values for the Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based blend films of a 320 nm thickness were 2.61 × 10−4, 6.65 × 10−4, and 9.21 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively, all significantly higher than those for the IEICO-4F pristine film. Relative to the IEICO-4F pristine film, new in-plain (200) peaks for a higher order face-on orientation of IEICO-4F were observed with the IEICO-4F based blend films, as measured by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Particularly, the μe of 9.21 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 for the Si25-H2 based blend film already exceeds that of 4.43 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 for the aforementioned 300 nm thick PBDB-T-2Cl:BTP-4F:PC61BM ternary blend film whose μh/μe ratio is 1.42.29 This is an unusual phenomenon which explains that the electron mobility of a nonfullerene acceptor in a binary blend film can be largely enhanced by a polymer donor (the enhancement is nearly up to one order of magnitude). Consequently, among the three 320 nm thick blend films, the Si25-H2 based one could give the smallest μh/μe ratio of 4.42 and contributed the best PCE of 13.2%, based on a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 26.87 mA cm−2, and an outstanding FF of 70.15%. Even for a much thicker blend film of 460 nm, the PSC still retained a good FF of 66.84%. In addition, a notable thickness window for PCE > 12% could be generated with thick films from 250 to 420 nm. This work highlights the potential of high hole mobility polymer donors in achieving a high FF for thick nonfullerene active layers and paves the way for developing high performance thick-film PSCs towards large-scale production.
2. Result and discussion
The chemical structures of Si25 and IEICO-4F are shown in Fig. 1a. The polymerizations and purifications for the three Si25 polymers are described in the ESI.† The Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 possess Mn values of 12.7, 98.6, and 105.6 kg mol−1, respectively, whose PDI values are 2.13, 2.32, and 2.14, respectively. To evaluate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the series Si25 polymers, we carried out electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, with an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode and ferrocene as the internal standard (Fig. S1†). Based on the onset of the oxidation potential (Eox), the obtained HOMO levels for Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 are −5.27, −5.32, and −5.32 eV, respectively (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the high molecular weight of a Si25 polymer would give a slightly lower-lying HOMO level that is beneficial to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in a PSC. In a previous report by Ma et al., a higher molecular weight PFBT4T could give a higher Voc, implying its lower-lying HOMO level.53 The optical band gaps (Eg-opt) of the three Si25 polymers are obtained from the onsets of their absorption spectra of the neat films (Fig. 1c), which are comparable to 1.65, 1.63, and 1.63 eV for Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2, respectively. Relative to Si25-L, the slightly smaller band gaps for Si25-H1 and Si25-H2 should be ascribed to the stronger backbone aggregations due to the higher molecular weights. Their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of −3.65, −3.62, and −3.62 eV, respectively, are deduced from their corresponding HOMO levels and Eg-opt values. For the IEICO-4F acceptor, its HOMO and LUMO levels of −5.43 and −4.03 eV (Fig. 1b) are calculated according to their corresponding onsets of Eox and reduction potentials (Ered) (Fig. S2†), and an Eg-opt of 1.23 eV is obtained from the absorption onset of 1008 nm in Fig. 1c. The offset for the HOMO levels between the Si25 donor and IEICO-4F acceptor can be as low as 0.11 eV, which may afford solar cells with an optimal Voc.7,19,50
It should be noted that the absorption coefficients of the three Si25 polymers in the wavelength range between 600 and 700 nm are obviously different, despite their comparable absorption in other wavelengths (Fig. 1c). A Si25 polymer with a higher molecular weight shows an enhanced absorption coefficient at 686 nm, suggesting an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) that results from a stronger intermolecular interaction of a D–A conjugated polymer. The maximum absorption coefficient of 5.1 × 104 cm−1 at 686 nm for Si25-H2 is coincidently identical to that for IEICO-4F at 878 nm. Due to the band gap difference between the Si25 polymers and the near-IR absorbing IEICO-4F, the Si25:IEICO-4F blend films can exhibit good complementary absorption in a very large wavelength range from 300 to 1000 nm (Fig. 1d), which may afford Si25:IEICO-4F active layers with a very high short-circuit current in PSCs. It should be noted that, in the range of 700–950 nm, the absorbance of the Si25-L based blend film is somewhat weaker than those of Si25-H1 and Si25-H2 based blend films. This may be related to the slightly larger Eg-opt for Si25-L and different IEICO-4F aggregations in the blend films. The absorption coefficients of the three Si25:IEICO-4F blend films are shown in Fig. S3.† A Si25 polymer of a higher molecular weight is beneficial for achieving a blend film with a higher absorption coefficient.
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the Si25:IEICO-4F blend films, PSCs were fabricated with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PFN-Br/active layer/MoO3/Al. The inorganic/organic ZnO/PFN-Br bi-interlayers on the ITO cathode had been reported before for inverted PSCs, which could facilitate the electron collection by the cathode.54–56 The 320 nm thick Si25:IEICO-4F (D/A ratio of 1:1.5) blend films was fabricated by spin-coating with hot chlorobenzene solutions with a minor 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) of 0.5% by volume as the solvent additive. Then the active layers were thermally annealed at 80 °C for 5 min. The measurements of the PSCs were carried out under illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 2a and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The Si25-L based devices show a Voc of 0.68 V, slightly lower than the 0.70 V for both Si25-H1 and Si25-H2. The Voc values for the three Si25 polymers are consistent with their HOMO differences, in which the Si25-L possesses the upper-lying HOMO level relative to Si25-H1 and Si25-H2 (Fig. 1b). In terms of an empirical formula, energy loss (Eloss) is equal to the lowest energy band gap Eg-opt minus the eVoc, i.e. Eloss = Eg-opt − eVoc.48 Based on an Eg-opt of 1.23 eV for IEICO-4F, the Si25-L exhibits an Eloss of 0.55 eV in the PSC while a lower Eloss value of 0.53 eV is for both Si25-H1 and Si25-H2 based devices. It should be noted that very obvious differences in Jsc and FF can be found for the three Si25 polymers. The Si25-L with the lowest Mn of 12.7 kg mol−1 displays a low Jsc of 19.7 mA cm−2 and an FF of 58.78%, respectively, giving a PCE of only 8.02%. The Jsc and FF for the Si25-H1 with a Mn of 98.6 kg mol−1 can be increased to 23.98 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68.86%, corresponding to an improved PCE of 11.55%. The Si25-L and Si25-H1 possess PDI values of 2.13 and 2.32, respectively, showing a limited difference. The quite different device performances of Si25-L and Si25-H1 should be mainly ascribed to the large increase of the molecular weight and not the molecular distribution effect. The highest Jsc of 26.87 mA cm−2 and an outstanding FF of 70.15% are achieved by the Si25-H2 with a Mn of 105.6 kg mol−1. Thus the higher Mn of a Si25 polymer would be beneficial to the charge separation and carrier transport in PSCs. Considering the slightly higher Mn of Si25-H2 relative to Si25-H1, the narrower molecular distribution (PDI = 2.14) for Si25-H2 relative to the PDI of 2.32 for Si25-H1 may be another positive factor for the elevation of the photovoltaic performance, suggesting a synergistic effect that combines the slightly higher Mn and the slightly narrower PDI in the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance. More importantly, the Si25-H2 based PSCs also show the highest PCE of 13.2%, one of the highest values reported so far for PSCs with an active layer thickness of over 300 nm.21,29,39 An average PCE of 12.88% is obtained from 30 individual devices (Fig. 2b). It should be pointed out that it is the first time that a binary nonfullerene PSC with an active layer thickness at a 300 nm level can exhibit an impressive FF of more than 70% though some fullerene based active layers and ternary active layers with such a thickness can show even better FFs.39,40 The results demonstrate the advantage of a high hole mobility polymer donor in combination with a nonfullerene acceptor in thick-film PSCs. Fig. 2c shows the shelf stability of the encapsulated PSCs in air. The Si25-L based devices display very faint “burn-in” loss in the initial days,49 and then the efficiency can be well maintained. After 36 days of storage, the PSCs exhibit average PCEs of 7.07%, still retaining 92% of the original efficiency. Relatively, the two Si25 polymers with much higher molecular weights show more obvious and longer time “burn-in”. After 12 days, their efficiencies are not so sensitive to storage. For the Si25-H1 based devices, an average PCE of 9.01% can be maintained after 36 days, corresponding to 81% of the original average efficiency (11.2%). For the Si25-H2 based devices, a high level average PCE of 10.85% can be achieved after storage for 36 days, still retaining 84% of the original average efficiency (12.93%).
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based devices are shown in Fig. 2d. The three devices display wide spectral responses from 300 to 1000 nm, well reflecting the effect resulting from the complementary absorptions between a Si25 polymer donor and the low Eg-opt IEICO-4F acceptor. The maximum EQE values of 59%, 73%, and 78% for the Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based devices, respectively, are located at around 625 nm, in which a higher Mw Si25 polymer can exhibit an enhanced spectral response. The integrated Jsc curves from the short to long wavelengths are also shown in Fig. 2d. The obtained integrated Jsc values for the Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based devices are 19.34, 23.16, and 26.29 mA cm−2 (Table 1), respectively. All the integrated Jsc values are comparable with the corresponding Jsc in the J–V measurements, showing small spectral mismatch factors between 1.9% and 3.5%.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pristine and blend films of the three Si25 polymers are shown in Fig. 3a. Under excitation at 448 nm, the Si25:IEICO-4F blend films display different PL quenching extents to the Si25 emissions of the pristine films. The obtained PL quenching of 86.9%, 92.1%, and 93.9% for Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2, respectively, suggests that a higher molecular weight of a Si25 polymer would be beneficial to the quenching of the Si25 emission. A similar PL quenching effect can be obtained with another excitation wavelength of 688 nm (Fig. S4†). To get more details on the exciton dissociation of the blend film, time-resolved PL spectroscopy (TRPL) was performed. Fig. 3b shows the transient PL spectra of Si25-L and Si25-H2 based blend films. The spectra were obtained by exciting the blend film with a laser of 400 nm, and the emission was probed at a wavelength of 750 nm (close to the emission peak of a Si25 polymer). Therefore, the transient PL measurements can monitor the dissociation of excitons generated in a Si25 polymer. The two transient PL kinetics can be well fitted by a bi-exponential function (see the bold lines in Fig. 3b). The fitted lifetime values for the Si25-L and Si25-H2 based blend films are 22.2 and 9.52 ps, respectively (Table S1†). The much shorter PL lifetime for the Si25-H2 based blend film indicates its faster electron transfer from the polymer donor to the IEICO-4F acceptor. It should be noted that under the same condition, the pristine films of Si25-L and Si25-H2 show comparable exciton lifetimes of ∼180 ps (Fig. S5†). We also traced the faint PL signal of the possible IEICO-4F emission at 970 nm, which was fitted by a mono-exponential function (Fig. S6†). The obtained lifetime values are 39.8 and 26.3 ps for the Si25-L and Si25-H2 based blend films, respectively (Table S1†). All the transient PL results suggest that the Si25-H2 based blend film would show obviously higher exciton dissociation efficiencies in the electron and hole transfer processes, which are important to achieve a higher Jsc in the Si25-H2 based PSC. According to the report by Yu et al.,57 saturation current density Jsat, charge dissociation probabilities P(E,T), and the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) of the Si25 based PSCs can be obtained (Fig. S7 and Table S2†), demonstrating that a higher molecular weight of a Si25 polymer is helpful in achieving a higher Jsc.

The dependence of Voc and Jsc on various light intensities (P) can offer deeper insight into the recombination process of the Si25:IEICO-4F based PSCs (Fig. 4). The slope of Vocversus log(P) helps us to determine the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the devices. A slope at kBT/q implies that bimolecular recombination is the dominating mechanism, where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge. As for trap-assisted or Shockley–Read–Hall recombination, a stronger dependence of Voc on light intensity with a slope of 2kBT/q is observed. In our cases, the Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based devices display slopes of 1.35, 1.15, and 1.05 kBT/q, respectively (Fig. 4a). The results indicate that a higher molecular weight of a Si25 polymer can reduce interfacial trap density and suppress trap-assisted recombination, thus giving an enhanced FF. The relationship between Jsc and light intensity (P) can be described by the formula of Jsc ∝ PS. If all free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, the S should be equal to 1, while S < 1 indicates existence of bimolecular recombination. The extracted S values are 0.90, 0.97, and 0.98 for Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based devices, respectively (Fig. 4b). The results suggest that a higher molecular weight of a Si25 polymer is an effective parameter to suppress the bimolecular recombination in thick-film PSCs, which is beneficial for a higher FF.

Fast and balanced hole and electron transport are very important in achieving a high FF in a thick-film PSC.29,58 Si25 is a polymer donor with a very high hole mobility (μh), and fullerene acceptors, such as PC71BM with a matched electron mobility (μe), can afford a relatively balanced μh/μe ratio of ∼2.30 Due to the low μe for a nonfullerene acceptor O-IDTBR, it is not easy for Si25:O-IDTBR thick-film active layers to achieve balanced hole and electron transport to give a high FF.50 Thus it is intriguing to analyze the carrier transport of the three 320 nm thick Si25:IEICO-4F active layers with largely varied FFs from 58.78% to 70.15%.
The mobilities of the pristine IEICO-4F film and the Si25:IEICO-4F blend films were measured via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S8 and S9†), with results summarized in Table 2. The obtained μe for the pristine IEICO-4F film is 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1, almost identical to that in a previous report.51 For several reported polymer:IEICO-4F blend films, the μe values were between 4.56 × 10−5 and 1.72 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1, also close to that of the pristine IEICO-4F film.52 However, significantly enhanced electron transport can be achieved by the Si25:IEICO-4F blend films (Table 2). With Si25-L as the donor, the blend film shows a μe of 2.61 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1. For the Si25-H1 and Si25-H2 based blend films, the μe values can be further improved to 6.65 × 10−4 and 9.21 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively. Relative to that of the pristine IEICO-4F film, 8 times increased μe can be achieved by the Si25-H2:IEICO-4F blend film. Particularly, the μe of 9.21 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 for the Si25-H2 based blend film already exceeds 4.43–5.50 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 for two high efficiency 300 nm thick ternary active layers, where nonfullerene and fullerene bi-acceptors are employed.29,39 The μh values for the three Si25 based blend films are between 2.15 × 10−3 and 4.08 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 and the calculated μh/μe ratios are between 8.13 and 4.42. The results suggest that a higher molecular weight of a Si25 polymer is beneficial for faster and more balanced carrier transport of the blend film, surely suppressing charge recombination and supporting the higher FF and Jsc.

Considering the active layer morphology could be a determining factor for the device performance, the morphologies of the three blends were investigated utilizing atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The height images of the blend films by AFM are depicted in Fig. 5. The Si25-L:IEICO-4F blend film exhibits a relatively rough surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 5.17 nm (Fig. 5a), which corresponds to a low Jsc and FF. The surface morphology can be improved with a higher molecular weight polymer donor. The Si25-H1 and Si25-H2 based blend films show RMS values of 2.78 and 1.73 nm, respectively (Fig. 5b and c). For the Si25-H2:IEICO-4F blend film, there are more obviously fibrous features for the bi-continuously interpenetrating nano-scale networks, which are able to facilitate the exciton dissociation and charge transport and thus improve the efficiency.

The 2D GIWAXS patterns for the four pristine films and three BHJ films and the corresponding line-cuts in the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions are shown in Fig. 6. The pristine IEICO-4F film displays a preferential face-on orientation with respect to the substrate (Fig. 6a), with an IP (100) diffraction peak at a q of 0.31 Å−1 corresponding to a d-spacing of 20.26 Å and a strong OOP (010) diffraction peak at a q of 1.84 Å−1 for a π–π stacking distance of 3.41 Å (Fig. 6c and Table S3†). The three Si25 pristine films possess edge-on dominated orientations with obvious (100), (200), and (300) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction. A higher molecular weight Si25 polymer shows a slightly larger (100) q value, corresponding to a slightly shorter d-spacing (Table S3†). For the three blend films (Fig. 6b), the Si25 polymers exhibit weakened OOP (100), (200), and (300) diffraction peaks for the edge-on orientation and faint IP (100) peaks at a q of ∼0.25 Å−1 for a face-on orientation. The bimodal crystallite orientations for the Si25 polymers in the blend films should be induced by the IEICO-4F acceptor molecules, reflecting certain polymer donor:acceptor interactions. The donor:acceptor interactions in the three blend films all result in decreased coherence lengths (CL) for the polymer OOP (100) crystallites (Table S3†). For example, the Si25-H2 pristine film and its blend film show CL values of 123.13 and 85.04 Å for the OOP (100) crystallites, respectively. The decreased CL may be a factor that causes a lower SCLC hole mobility of 4.08 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 for Si25-H2 in the blend film if compared with that of 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 (V s)−1 for its pristine film. The polymer donor:acceptor interaction also has a great impact on the IEICO-4F crystalline properties. Firstly, relative to that of the pristine IEICO-4F film (the long dashed line in Fig. 6c), the IP (100) diffraction peaks for IEICO-4F in the three blend films continuously shift to high q positions of 0.32, 0.33, and 0.34 Å−1 for the Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based blend films, respectively, which correspond to continuously shortened d-spacings of 19.63, 19.03, and 18.47 Å. The results demonstrate that a higher molecular weight Si25 polymer tends to induce a closer interdigitation of the IEICO-4F lamella. Secondly, relative to the pristine IEICO-4F film, the three blend films all show new IP diffraction peaks at a q of ∼0.67 Å−1 (see the position of the short dashed line), and the peaks should be the IP (200) orientations for the IEICO-4F molecules. It is the first time that IP (200) peaks for a face-on orientation of IEICO-4F can be observed with IEICO-4F based blend films. With a higher molecular weight Si25 polymer, a Si25:IEICO-4F blend film can possess a stronger IP (200) diffraction for IEICO-4F. In addition, the calculated coherence lengths (CL) for OOP (010) crystallites of the Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based blend films are 37.91, 38.06, and 40.25 Å (Table S3†), suggesting that a higher molecular weight Si25 polymer would afford a better π–π stacking. Based on these results, the overall crystalline properties of the IEICO-4F acceptor in the blend films can be enhanced by a higher molecular weight Si25 polymer. It is the modified IEICO-4F morphology that can induce an eight time increase in the electron mobility of the Si25-H2:IEICO-4F blend film if compared with the pristine IEICO-4F film. In some sense, the modified IEICO-4F morphology can be regarded as ordered construction of the IEICO-4F molecules when blended with the Si25 donor in the blend film.

As listed in Table 1, the Si25-H2:IEICO-4F blend film can contribute 320 nm thick PSCs with an excellent PCE of 13.2% and an FF of 70.15%. The evaluation of photovoltaic performances of the Si25-H2:IEICO-4F active layers with varied thicknesses around 320 nm is useful to define a possible thickness window for efficiency control, which is crucial towards future practical applications. The J–V characteristics of PSCs with a thickness range from 150 to 460 nm are shown in Fig. S10,† with detailed photovoltaic parameters listed in Table S4.† Generally, thicker active layers are useful to achieve a high Jsc due to more sufficient light absorbing, except the very thick blend film of 460 nm (Fig. 7). The insufficient light utilization for the 150 nm thick active layer should be related to the moderately molar extinction coefficient (εmax) of about 5 × 104 mol−1 L cm−1 for Si25-H2.30 A similar increase in Jsc had been found in previous reports for Si25-H2:PC71BM and Si25-H2:O-IDTBR active layers.30,50 The Voc values of the devices show a very limited change (0.70–0.72 V). One notable feature of the 150–460 nm thick active layers is that a high FF of more than 66% can be maintained. Another feature is that a thickness window for PCE > 12% may be achieved with thick films from 250 to 420 nm. Thus the Si25-H2:IEICO-4F active layer would be suitable for printing at a 300 nm level average thickness.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, a strategy for achieving a high FF thick nonfullerene active layer is highlighted using a high hole mobility polymer as the donor. For comparison, three Si25 donors Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2, with largely varied Mw and comparable PDI values, were selected to pair with a near-IR absorbing IEICO-4F nonfullerene acceptor to construct the active layers, which showed complementary absorptions. It was found that a higher Mw Si25 donor was beneficial for achieving a higher Jsc of up to 26.87 mA cm−2 in PSCs based on a 320 nm thick active layer, which was supported by steady-state and transient PL measurements, where a stronger PL quenching extent and a faster electron transfer from the Si25 donor to the IEICO-4F acceptor could be observed with the blend film. As expected, the Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based thick blend films displayed high SCLC μh values of 2.15 × 10−3, 3.76 × 10−3, and 4.08 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively. However, the Si25-L, Si25-H1, and Si25-H2 based blend films exhibited unexpected and continuously increased SCLC μe values of 2.61 × 10−4, 6.65 × 10−4, and 9.21 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1, respectively, all significantly higher than that for the IEICO-4F pristine film. Among the three blend films of 320 nm, the Si25-H2 based one, with the highest μh and μe of ∼10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 as well as the smallest μh/μe ratio of 4.42 to achieve relatively balanced hole and electron transport, could contribute an outstanding FF of 70.15% in thick-film PSCs. Relative to the IEICO-4F pristine film, a shortened d-spacing of the IEICO-4F lamella and new IP (200) peaks for a higher order face-on orientation of IEICO-4F were observed with the Si25 based blend films, which were very helpful factors for electron transport. As a result, high PCEs of up to 13.2% were achieved with Si25-H2 based thick-film nonfullerene active layers, a breakthrough for a high hole mobility polymer as the donor. Even for a much thicker blend film of 460 nm, the PSC still retained a good FF of 66.84%. In addition, the Si25-H2 based active layers from 250 to 420 nm are suitable to define a thickness window with PCE > 12% towards large-scale production. The results demonstrate the importance of high and balanced carrier transport in achieving a high FF of a thick nonfullerene active layer, and pave the way towards highly efficient thick-film nonfullerene PSCs.
