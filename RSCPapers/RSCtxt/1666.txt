    , Accepted 6th February 2017First published on 9th February 2017AbstractThe graphene quantum dot (GQD) is a new kind of anode/cathode interlayer material for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The key requirement for a cathode interlayer (CIL) is a low work function. In this article, aiming at application as a CIL for PSCs, we report a general approach to tune the work function of GQD-modified electrodes using alkali metal cations, e.g. Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+. For ITO electrodes modified with these GQDs containing alkali metal cations, the work function can be finely tuned within the range of 4.0–4.5 eV. Owing to their low work function, GQDs containing K+, Rb+ and Cs+ can be used as CILs for PSCs. Their device performance is fairly comparable to that of the state-of-the-art CIL material ZnO. This work provides a rational approach to tune the properties of GQD and to design solution-processable electrode interlayer materials for organic electronic devices.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) present a promising photovoltaic technology with the great advantages of flexibility and low cost with solution processability.1–4 Their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is determined not only by the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer, but also by the anode/cathode interlayer (AIL/CIL) at the interface between the active layer and the two electrodes.5–12 AIL/CIL can lead to Ohmic contact to facilitate charge carrier extraction and block opposite charge carriers to prevent charge recombination at the active layer–electrode interface. The key requirement for AIL/CIL materials is work function.13–15 AIL materials need to have a high work function to match with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor materials to facilitate hole extraction. In contrast, CIL materials need to give a low work function of the cathode to match with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of acceptor materials to improve electron extraction. Therefore, it is very important to tune the work function of AIL/CIL interlayer materials for PSCs.
Typical AIL materials include transition metal oxides (e.g. V2O5, MoO3, NiO),16,17 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)18,19 and graphene oxide (GO) derivatives.20–26 Many CIL materials have been developed, such as low work function metals (e.g. Ca, Ba),27,28 inorganic salts (e.g. LiF, Cs2CO3),29,30 inorganic semiconducting oxides (e.g. TiO2, ZnO)31,32 and organic molecules/polymers.33–37 The graphene quantum dot (GQD) is a kind of newly emerging AIL/CIL material.38–40 A great advantage of GQD is that its chemical structure can be readily modified and its properties can be tuned to meet the requirements of the AIL/CIL. For example, we find that edge-carboxylated GQD (ECGQD) itself is an excellent AIL with a high work function.41 By functionalization with tetramethylammonium or Cs+, GQD derivatives can lead to a low work function and can be used as CILs.39,42 Although GQD derivatives have been intensively studied for many bio-related applications and have been used in active layer organic opto-electronic devices,43,44 research on GQD derivatives as AIL/CIL materials in PSCs is rare.45–48 It is important to establish the relationship between the chemical structures, properties and opto-electronic device performance of GQD derivatives.
In this article, aiming at application as a CIL for PSCs, we report a general approach to tune the work function of GQD-modified electrodes using alkali metal cations. Alkali metals have low work functions, such as Li (WF = 2.93 eV), Na (WF = 2.75 eV), K (WF = 2.29 eV), Rb (WF = 2.16 eV), and Cs (WF = 2.14 eV).45 We find that ECGQD incorporated with an alkali metal cation exhibits a much decreased work function and can be used as a CIL for PSCs. Most importantly, the work function of ITO electrodes modified with these ECGQD derivatives can be finely tuned within the range of 4.0–4.5 eV. The work function modulation of GQD derivatives reported here indicates the rational design of a new kind of solution processable electrode interlayer material for organic opto-electronic devices.
Experimental section
Synthesis of ECGQD-M
ECGQD was synthesized using an oxidation method developed in our previous literature.46 In a typical synthesis, carbon black (2.5 g, Vulcan XC-72 carbon black, Cabot Corporation) was added to a mixture of concentrated H2SO4 (100 mL) and HNO3 (50 mL). The solution was stirred at 130 °C for 24 hours. The mixture was cooled down and diluted with deionized water. The excess amount of acid was neutralized with Na2CO3. Then, the acidity of the solution was adjusted to pH 1. An excess amount of acetone was added to the solution. The precipitate was removed by vacuum filtration. The residual solution was further distilled under reduced pressure to give a solid. ECGQD-M (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) was synthesized by neutralization of ECGQD with alkali metal carbonate in aqueous solution.47 Alkali metal carbonate in aqueous solution (20 mg mL−1) was gradually added into the ECGQD in aqueous solution (10 mg mL−1) until pH = 7. The obtained solution was distilled under reduced pressure to give the product.
PSC device fabrication
Poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazolealt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) was synthesized in our laboratory.49 [6,6]-Phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, American Dye Source) was used as received. All devices with the structure of ITO/CIL/PCDTBT:PC71BM/MoO3/Al were fabricated on pre-cleaned ITO glass substrates. The ITO glass substrates were ultrasonicated for 10 minutes each sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, followed by drying at 120 °C for 2 hours. The ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 25 minutes. As for the CIL of ECGQD-M, the ECGQD-M (2 mg mL−1) in aqueous solution was deposited on ITO substrates by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 1 minute, and then baked on a hot plate at 180 °C for 10 minutes. As for the CIL of ZnO, the ZnO precursor solution (0.04 mol L−1) in 2-methoxyethanol was deposited on ITO substrates by spin-coating at 3500 rpm for 1 minute and then annealed at 200 °C for 1 hour.50 All the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. The PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4 by weight) active layer (75 nm) was spin-coated from the o-dichlorobenzene (in total 15 mg mL−1) solution at 600 rpm for 2 minutes.51 Subsequently, the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber and a 5 nm thick layer of MoO3 was deposited on the active layer under 2 × 10−4 Pa vacuum. Finally, Al (100 nm) was evaporated on the top of the MoO3 anode interlayer. The active area of the cell was 8 mm2.
Characterization
The UPS and XPS measurements were carried out by using a VG Escalabmkll spectrometer (UK) with a He I (21.2 eV for UPS) discharge lamp and Al Kα irradiation source (1486.7 eV for XPS) excitation. The AFM in tapping mode was performed on a SPI 3800N Probe Station (Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan). The samples for AFM measurements were prepared by spin-coating the ECGQD-M dispersion (0.1 mg mL−1) onto mica substrates at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-Vis spectrometer. Film samples used for UPS, AFM and UV-Vis absorption spectra measurements were made by spin-coating of ECGQD-M in aqueous solution on ITO glass substrates using the same parameters as for PSC device fabrication. An Oriel 150 W solar simulator with an AM 1.5 G filter was used to provide illumination of the solar cells of 100 mW cm−2. J–V curves of the devices were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter. EQE measurements were performed using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd).
Results and discussion
As illustrated in Scheme 1, ECGQD-M was synthesized by neutralization reaction of ECGQD with alkali metal carbonate in aqueous solution. ECGQD with a diameter of ca. 3 nm was synthesized by oxidation of carbon black following our previous method.46 ECGQD has a high content of COOH groups at the edge and negligible epoxy/hydroxyl groups on the graphene basal plane. Upon addition of alkali metal carbonate to ECGQD in aqueous solution, the COOH groups at the edge of ECGQD are converted to COO−·M+ groups (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) affording ECGQD-M. The complete conversion of the COOH groups in ECGQD to COO−·M+ groups in ECGQD-M is verified by the shift of the band from 288.8 eV (attributed to COOH groups) to 288.3 eV (attributed to COO− groups) in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) C 1s spectra (see Fig. S1†). The absence of residual alkali metal carbonate in ECGQD-M is proved by the absence of large particles in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of ECGQD-M (see Fig. S2†). Fig. 1 shows the XPS survey spectra of ECGQD-M featuring the existence of alkali metal components. As listed in Table 1, the contents of alkali metal cations in ECGQD-M are around 7–8 at%.

ECGQD-M is readily soluble in water, methanol and ethanol, but insoluble in low-polarity organic solvents, such as toluene, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The solubility makes ECGQD-M suitable for application as CIL in inverted PSCs. Spin-coating of the active layer with low-polarity organic solvents on the top of the ECGQD-M CIL layer will not destroy the interlayer. In addition, ECGQD-M exhibits good film forming properties on the ITO electrode. As shown in Fig. S3,† spin-coating aqueous ECGQD-M solution on the ITO surface causes negligible changes on the AFM height image of the modified ITO substrate. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the AFM height images after spin-coating ECGQD-M is 2.907 nm for ECGQD-Li, 2.801 nm for ECGQD-Na, 2.426 nm for ECGQD-K, 2.330 nm for ECGQD-Rb, and 2.312 nm for ECGQD-Cs, respectively, which are quite close to that (2.502 nm) of the bare ITO surface.
As shown in Fig. S4,† the UV-Vis absorption spectra of ECGQD-M in aqueous solution exhibit negligible absorbance in the visible and near-infrared range. The high optical transparency of ECGQD-M is beneficial for its application as CIL because it allows the most sunlight absorption by the active layer.9 The ECGQD-M films made from spin-coating with ECGQD-M solutions onto the ITO glass substrates all exhibit transparency spectra similar to that of the bare ITO substrate (see Fig. S5†).
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to study the effect of alkali metal cations on the work function of ECGQD-M modified ITO electrode. Fig. 2a displays the UPS spectra around the secondary electron cutoff region of the ECGQD and ECGQD-M modified ITO substrates. The work function is determined from the secondary electron threshold energy (Eth) using the function: WF = hγ − Eth, where hγ is the photon energy of excitation light (He I discharge lamp, 21.2 eV). As shown in Fig. 2b, the work function of the bare ITO substrate is 4.70 eV. When ECGQD was spin-coated on the ITO surface, the work function increased to 5.25 eV, indicating that ECGQD can be used as AIL for PSCs.41 In contrast, deposition of an ECGQD-M interlayer on the ITO surface leads to a decreased work function. The work functions decreased to 4.47 eV, 4.41 eV, 4.33 eV, 4.16 eV and 4.03 eV for ECGQD-Li, ECGQD-Na, ECGQD-K, ECGQD-Rb and ECGQD-Cs, respectively. These results indicate that incorporation of an alkali metal cation is an effective approach to decrease and finely tune the work function of GQD. The larger the atomic number of the alkali metal cation is, the lower the work function of the ECGQD-modified ITO electrode becomes. This trend is also in accordance with that of the work functions of alkali metals themselves. Therefore, we believe that the alkali metal cations play the key role on the work-function decrease of the ITO electrode. According to the study on the work function of Cs2CO3-modified cathodes reported in the literature, the alkali metal cations can form chemical bonds with the oxygen atoms on the ITO surface, inducing an interfacial dipole and lowering the work function of the modified electrodes.52,53 This explanation may also be applicable for ECGQD-M with different alkali metal cations. Our experimental results are also in line with the theoretical results of Colherinhas and Prezhdo's works, who use alkali metal ions to tune the band gaps of carbonaceous aromatic systems.54,55 The low work functions of ECGQD-M modified ITO electrodes indicate that they may be used as CILs for inverted PSCs.

To test the capability of ECGQD-M as a CIL in PSCs, PSC devices with inverted structure were fabricated using ECGQD-M as a CIL. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the device configuration is ITO/CIL/PCDTBT:PC71BM/MoO3/Al, while the CIL is none, ECGQD-Li, ECGQD-Na, ECGQD-K, ECGQD-Rb, ECGQD-Cs, or ZnO. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices under simulated AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4a. Table 2 lists the corresponding parameters, including open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF) and PCE. The device without CIL shows a low VOC of 0.24 V, JSC of 7.81 mA cm−2, FF of 0.37, corresponding to a low PCE of 0.69%. The poor device performance is due to non-Ohmic contact between the ITO cathode and the PC71CM acceptor owing to the high work function of ITO. When ECGQD-M was used as a CIL, the PSC device performance was significantly improved. With the increase of atomic number from Li to K, the VOC and FF increase greatly because of the decreased work function of the ECGQD-M modified ITO electrodes. For ECGQD-K, ECGQD-Rb and ECGQD-Cs as CILs, the VOC remains at 0.88 V, indicating that Ohmic contact has formed between the ECGQD-M modified ITO cathode and the PC71BM acceptor (Fig. 3b). The photovoltaic performances of ECGQD-K, ECGQD-Rb and ECGQD-Cs based devices are all fairly comparable to that of the reference device based on the widely-used CIL material ZnO (WF = 4.30 eV),50 indicating that ECGQD-K, ECGQD-Rb and ECGQD-Cs are excellent CIL materials. The best device performance is obtained with ECGQD-Cs as CIL, which exhibits a VOC of 0.88 V, a JSC of 9.92 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.68, corresponding to a PCE of 5.92%. The decreased work function of ECGQD-M modified ITO electrode also increases the built-in potential across the active layer, which improves charge carrier selection and suppresses charge recombination. This is supported by the higher current density under positive bias (>1 V) and lower current density under reverse bias in the dark J–V plots for the ECGQD-M based devices (see Fig. 5). The improved charge selection leads to a much higher FF in ECGQD-M based devices than that of the bare ITO based device. Fig. 4b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices. The JSC calculated from the integration of the EQE spectra and AM1.5G spectra is consistent with JSC values obtained from the J–V scans. The PSC device results suggest that the work function of ECGQD-M based CILs has a great effect on photovoltaic performance and that ECGQD-M can be used as an efficient CIL for high-performance PSCs.

Conclusions
We have developed an approach to tune the work functions of GQD-modified electrodes using alkali metal cations for solution processable CILs of PSCs. ECGQD-M (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs), in which the COOH groups at the edge of a carbon plane are converted to COO−·M+ groups, were synthesized by the addition of alkali metal carbonate to ECGQD in aqueous solution. The work function of an ITO electrode modified with these ECGQD derivatives can be finely tuned within the range of 4.0–4.5 eV. With the low work function, ECGQD-K, ECGQD-Rb and ECGQD-Cs can be used as CILs for PSCs, and their device performances are fairly comparable to that of the state-of-the-art CIL material ZnO. This work provides a rational approach to design a new kind of solution processable electrode interlayer material for organic electronic devices.
