    , Accepted 16th April 2018First published on 16th April 2018AbstractIt's a challenge to prepare high-performance polymer solar cells (PSCs) employing non-halogenated solvents due to the poor solubility of conjugated polymers. Here, a new region-random copolymer, in contrast to traditional polymers featuring a D–A or D–π–A–π backbone, is synthesized and fully characterized. By polymerizing ffBT-T (π–A) units with BDT (D) units, the resultant polymer PBDT-ffBT-T (P1T) with repeat units of D–π–A or D–A–π exhibits superior solubility in non-halogenated solvents and outperforms its traditional analogues with the highest performance of 8.53% when processed from anisole. Importantly, the optimal device performance is attained with an active layer thickness of over 200 nm and shows no batch-to-batch difference, implying its compatibility with printing technology. Our results demonstrate that this simple chemical modification for copolymers may significantly benefit the development of PSCs using environmentally friendly solvents.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained much research attention because of their advantages in synthesizing a low-cost, flexible and lightweight device.1,2 Over the past decades, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs based on polymer/fullerene and polymer/non-fullerene acceptor systems have surpassed 10% and 12%, respectively.3–5 However, most of the state-of-the-art PSCs were processed from halogenated solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and so on.6–8 These solvents are harmful to human health and the environment as well as being incompatible with solution printing technology for possible large-scale production in future. Therefore, use of eco-friendly and non-hazardous hydrocarbon solvents for the deposition of the active layer is an ideal choice.9–12 Even though great efforts have been made by seeking solvent systems with an appropriate Hansen solubility parameter to match that of specific polymers, only very limited success has been achieved by trial and error so far. The major reason that holds back the widespread use of non-halogenated solvents is the intrinsically poor solubility of the conjugated polymers in these environmentally friendly solvents.13–15
Generally, the solubility of conjugated polymers in the solvents significantly depends on the length of side chains and the segments of the backbone.16,17 Introduction of long-branched alkyl side chains can endow the polymer with better solubility, but the close intermolecular π–π stacking would weaken because of the collisions between the bulky groups.18–20 Therefore, the resultant polymer suffers from the loss of light absorption and low hole mobility, leading to lower short circuit current (Jsc). What's more, the low solubility of the conjugated polymer in non-halogenated solvents is mainly determined by the high regioregularity of the polymer backbone, while the effect of just changing the length of the alkyl side chains on improving the solubility in non-halogenated solvents is insufficient. Recently, the reported results showed that slightly decreasing the regioregularity would be helpful to enhance the solubility of polymers. For instance, Kim et al. synthesized a new asymmetric thiophene–vinylene–selenophene (TVS) moiety as an electron donor (D) unit chemically coupled with a DPP acceptor (A) moiety.21 The relevant polymer, PDPP-TVS, exhibited high solubility, even in non-halogenated solvents. Li et al. designed an asymmetric DPP monomer using two different flanking aromatic substituents. The resultant DPP polymer can be processed from non-halogenated solvents with high performance in FETs (12.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PSCs (6.5%).22 Zheng et al. demonstrated that the introduction of asymmetric indenothiophene derivatives led to high device performance.23 These results indicated that this might be an effective way to improve the solubility and device performance of the conjugated polymers in non-halogenated solvents via modification of the backbone. Moreover, many results showed that random copolymerization would improve the solubility.24–26 However, these methods always involved complicated synthesis procedures with respect to typical copolymers. Most of the conjugated polymers used in PSCs and OFETs were designed to exactly obey the donor–acceptor (D–A) and/or donor–π (spacer)–acceptor–π (spacer) (D–π–A–π) configuration, which might be the biggest obstacle that hinders their solubility in non-halogenated solvents.27–29 This phenomenon may result from the preconception that the desirable conjugated copolymers should be of high structural order and regioregularity in order to achieve high performance.30,31 Therefore, it is still a challenge to synthesize conjugated polymers with a novel molecular backbone for PSCs fabricated by using non-halogenated solvents without sacrificing the device performance.
In this work, a new conjugated polymer is designed and synthesized by breaking the traditional polymeric backbone (D–A or D–π–A–π) to realize the high solubility of the conjugated polymers in non-halogenated solvents. The classical conjugated polymer system based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT) and 5,6-difluorobenzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (ffBT) as D and A units, respectively, was selected as the model for our molecular design. One new electron acceptor segment was achieved by coupling one aromatic thiophene unit (T) as the “π-spacer” to the ffBT unit to construct an ffBT-T (A–π) moiety, which obviously differs from the traditional acceptor units, ffBT (A) and T-ffBT-T (π–A–π) units, in the typical conjugated polymers. After polymerizing A–π units with BDT units, the desirable polymer exhibited superior solubility in non-halogenated solvents and the relevant device outperformed its traditional analogues with D–A or D–π–A–π as repeat units.18,32 More excitingly, the device processed from the non-halogenated solvent could attain the optimal PCE with an active layer thickness of over 200 nm, demonstrating compatibility with future solution-based printing technology for large-scale production. The newly designed donor polymer was also successfully applied to fabricate non-fullerene and ternary PSCs using non-halogenated solvents, implying their potential application in most PSC systems.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The detailed synthesis procedure for an A–π monomer and relevant polymers is shown in Scheme S1† and described in the ESI.† A 4-bromo-7-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluorobenzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole (ffBT-T) monomer was finally obtained directly via a C–H functionalization reaction. The final polymer PBDT-ffBT-T, denoted as P1T, was synthesized via a Stille coupling reaction, where BDT and ffBT-T were used as the D and A units, respectively, as shown in Scheme 1. It should be noted that each BDT end could chemically couple with a T or ffBT end in the ffBT-T segment, so the T and ffBT in the acceptor segments were irregularly distributed along the P1T backbone. The analogs of P1T were also synthesized by polymerizing BDT units with traditional ffBT and T-ffBT-T units, respectively, named PBDT-ffBT and PBDT-ffBT-2T, denoted as P0T and P2T, as control. Identical side chains were applied for the three polymers to eliminate any complications due to the side chain effect on the solubility and photovoltaic performance. Therefore, these polymers are different only in the backbones, enabling us to exactly evaluate the impact of the newly designed backbone on the solubility of polymers and related device performance. Gel permeation chromatography experiments showed that P0T, P1T and P2T have molecular weights (Mns)/polydispersity indexes (PDIs) of 29 kDa/2.6, 37 kDa/2.6 and 32 kDa/4.1, respectively (Fig. S8†). The larger PDI value for P2T might be due to its poor solubility. It is worth noting that although the polymerization reaction time for synthesizing the traditional copolymers of P0T and P2T was carefully controlled and monitored to avoid overpolymerization, the resultant traditional polymers of P0T and P2T exhibited poor solubility in most common solvents. In contrast, for P1T, the reaction always afforded highly soluble products, even as the Mn increased from 37 kDa to 60 kDa.

Solubility properties
The solubility of the three polymers in o-DCB and anisole (AO) was firstly evaluated by heating the solution at 80 °C for 6 hours and then cooling it to room temperature. As shown in the photographs of Fig. 1, for the deliberately designed P1T, a 20 mg ml−1 and a 15 mg ml−1 solution in o-DCB and AO, respectively, could maintain homogeneity and flowability at room temperature. The absorption strengths of 5 mg ml−1/10 mg ml−1/20 mg ml−1 in o-DCB and 5 mg ml−1/10 mg ml−1/15 mg ml−1 in AO, respectively, were also calculated to evaluate the solubility. The results showed that the solubility of P1T in o-DCB and AO solutions was greater than 20 mg ml−1 and 15 mg ml−1, respectively (Fig. 2b and e). For P0T, a 20 mg ml−1o-DCB solution could also maintain homogeneity and the corresponding absorption strength of 5 mg ml−1/10 mg ml−1/20 mg ml−1 is also observed on the standard curve, while obviously insoluble polymeric particles were observed for P0T in AO solution at a concentration of 8 mg ml−1. Its absorption strength of 8 mg ml−1 in AO solution deviated from the standard curve, stating that the solubility of P0T in AO solution should be less than 8 mg ml−1 (Fig. 2a and d). In contrast, P2T just swelled but did not totally dissolve even at a concentration of as low as 8 mg ml−1 in o-DCB and was completely insoluble in AO even after heating at 150 °C overnight, as shown in Fig. 2c and f. Because of the extremely poor solubility of P2T, it was impossible to plot the standard curve of P2T. The solubility of P1T with higher molecular weight (60 kDa) in ODCB and AO solutions was also tested (Fig. S9†).

Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of these polymers in solid films are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption onsets of P2T and P0T polymers are 726 nm and 757 nm, corresponding to the optical band gaps (Eg) of 1.70 eV and 1.64 eV, respectively, while the absorption onset of the newly designed P1T is located at 738 nm between that of P0T and P2T, and the calculated Eg is 1.68 eV. The HOMO levels of the polymers were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2). By combining the CV and Eg results, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO levels of P0T, P1T and P2T are −3.93/−5.57 eV, −3.78/−546 eV, and −3.68/−5.38 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. When the number of thiophene units per repeating segment was decreased from 2T to 1T and then to 0T, the enhanced effective density of the ffBT unit in the polymer backbone led to lower HOMO and LUMO levels. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also carried out for the three polymers and are depicted in Fig. S11.† The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels are −4.96 and −2.95, −4.89 and −2.95, and −4.84 and −2.92 eV, for the P0T, P1T and P2T polymers, respectively. It can be found that the variation trend of DFT results was in line with the CV results (Fig. S11†).

Photovoltaic properties
Device optimization was firstly examined with halogenated solvents as shown in Tables S1–S3.† The optimal current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding parameters are shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2, respectively. P1T afforded the highest PCE (8.16%) in comparison to P0T (5.31%) and P2T (5.72%) with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 13.38 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 70.9%. Although P1T showed a moderate Voc, the considerably improved Jsc and FF led to enhanced PCE. When processed from AO/DPE solvents, the P1T device exhibited an even higher efficiency of 8.53% when compared to the device made from the CB/DIO solution (Table S4†). Importantly, P1T achieved the highest PCE with an active layer thickness of over 200 nm (Fig. S12 and Table S5†), which is very important for large-area solution printing technology. In contrast, P0T had to be spin-coated from the hot AO/DPE solution at 120 °C, leading to an inferior film and very poor reproducibility (Table S6†). As a result, a very low PCE of 3.38% was achieved. P2T couldn't be processed with non-halogenated solvents due to its poor solubility. The Jsc values calculated from the integration of EQE curves agreed well with those obtained from the J–V curves (the deviation is < 5%, Table 2) (Fig. 3b). Noticeably, the PCE of P2T is lower than that previously reported (∼7%), mainly because of its poor solubility, which makes it difficult to process and obtain uniform blend films, even after being spin-coated from the hot ODCB solution. For a further clear comparison, the performance of recently reported polymers having a similar/the same molecular structure is summarized for comparison in Fig. S13 and Table S7.† Without any extra efforts, these devices showed PCEs in the range of 4.9–8.5%.18,24,32–36 What's more, except for the random polymer Th35, all these polymers gave their optimal efficiency only using halogenated solvents, which might be due to their poor solubility.24 These results also demonstrate the feasibility of this novel molecular backbone in realizing the high solubility of conjugated polymers in non-halogenated solvents without sacrificing the device performance. The solvent compatibility of P1T in other non-halogenated solvents was also tested, as shown in Table S12.†

The poor batch-to-batch reproducibility is one of the major bottlenecks for the traditional D–A copolymer towards mass-scale production, due to the difficulty in controlling the molecular weight and PDI via the Suzuki or Stille cross-coupling condensation polymerization reaction. In this work, the designed P1T may be more prone to being different from batch to batch, because of the irregularly distributed T-ffBT moieties along the P1T backbone. To further address this problem, another two batches of P1T featuring different Mns of 51 kDa and 60 kDa, with corresponding PDIs of 2.4 and 2.3, were synthesized. Excitingly, P1T with different Mns also demonstrated to be advantageous in terms of solubility in halogenated and non-halogenated solvents as compared with P0T and P2T. The two batches delivered similar PCEs of ∼8.3% when processed from non-halogenated solvents (Fig. 5a and Table S9†). The insensitivity of solubility and efficiency to the Mn variation would guarantee the reproducibility and offer wide processing windows for solution printing technology.
Charge transport and recombination properties
To evaluate the influence of chemical structure on the charge transportation properties, hole and electron mobilities of the blends were examined (Fig. S14, Table S8†). The hole and electron mobilities were measured with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF/Al, respectively. Fitting by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) model reveals that the P0T, P1T and P2T blends exhibited hole/electron mobilities of 5.17 × 10−5/1.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.40 × 10−4/3.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.08 × 10−5/1.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, when processed from halogenated solvents. When using the AO solvent, the P1T blend showed even higher hole and electron mobilities of 1.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The relatively high hole and electron mobilities of P1T blends both in halogenated and non-halogenated solvents led to enhanced FF and Jsc. The Jscversus light density (Plight) was also examined to probe the charge recombination behavior (Fig. S15, Table S8†). The relationship of Jsc and Plight can be described by the power-law equation Jsc ∝ (Plight)α.37 The calculated α values are 0.925 and 0.934 for P1T processed from CB/DIO and AO/DPE solvents, respectively. The higher α values of the P1T device compared to that of the P0T (0.902, CB/DIO) and P2T (0.918, o-DCB/DIO) devices support its high Jsc and FF.
Crystallinity and morphology study
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was also employed to explore the influence of the molecular structure on the crystallinity and texture features as shown in Fig. 4. The P0T blend showed a strong (100) lamellar packing peak at q = 2.83 nm−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) scanning. The OOP π–π stacking peak located at q = 18.26 nm−1 is not obvious in the P0T blend, which indicates that P0T is more prone to adopting a preferential edge-on crystalline orientation, while for P2T, only a relatively weak (100) diffraction peak, which is located at q = 2.92 nm−1, is observed in the OOP scanning. There was no observed π–π stacking diffraction peak in the blend films in the OOP and in plane (IP) directions, indicating that the crystallinity of P2T in the films was very weak. Noticeably, in previously reported work, conjugated polymers BDT-FBT-2T (or named Th100)24,32, whose molecular structure was similar/identical to P2T, usually displayed high crystallinity due to the two symmetrical thiophene spaces attaching to the ffBT units.24,38 In this work, P2T had to be spin-coated from the hot o-DCB solution due to its poor solubility derived from the shorter alkyl side chains compared to previously reported copolymers. During the thin film deposition, the very fast solvent evaporation and sharp fall in temperature, which is a kinetically unfavorable circumstance for the crystal growth, suppressed the crystallization of P2T (Fig. S16†). Compared to P0T and P2T, the P1T blend exhibited obvious (010) stacking peaks at q = 17.64 nm−1 in the OOP direction and (100) lamellar peaks at q = 2.82 nm−1 in the IP direction, revealing a preferential face-on orientation for P1T in the blend film, which benefits hole transportation and achieving high performance. The crystallization behavior of the P1T blend processed from non-halogenated solvents was similar to that processed from the CB solution. These results hint that P1T was insensitive to the deposition conditions, which would be favorable for future solution printing technology. The morphologies of these blend films were further probed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. S17.† The TEM results showed that the P0T blend processed from the CB/DIO solvent exhibited large phase separation with a domain size of ∼40 nm, which may be due to its higher crystallinity than those of P1T and P2T. The large phase separation may cause severe charge recombination, accounting for the low Jsc and FF. For P2T, some polymer domains (white regions) with diameters ranging from ∼100 to 200 nm were observed, which may be the insoluble polymer particles or precipitates from the hot o-DCB/DIO solution during the spin-coating process. In contrast, the P1T blend could form finely dispersed fibrillar microstructures and bicontinuous networks as processed from the CB/DIO and AO/DPE solvents, which contributes to the higher Jsc and FF for the P1T device as compared with P0T and P2T devices.39,40

Non-fullerene system
Currently, most of the popular non-fullerene and ternary PSCs were processed from halogenated solvents, which are mainly restricted by the low solubility of the conjugated polymers in the non-halogenated solvents.41–44 The possibility of P1T as a donor in fabricating non-fullerene and ternary PSCs with non-halogenated solvents was also examined, as shown in Fig. 5b and Table 2. The P1T:ITIC-Th blend showed a PCE of 8.59% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 14.7 mA cm−1 and a FF of 61.6% as processed from the pure AO solvent. The higher Voc as compared with the P1T:PC71BM device was consistent with the higher LUMO energy levels of ITIC-Th with respect to PC71BM. The P1T:PC71BM: ITIC-Th ternary solar cells with a weight ratio of 1:0.36:1.44 processed from AO/DPE (97/3, v/v) solvents demonstrated a PCE of 9.20%, which is better than that of the binary devices based on P1T. We confirmed that the PCEs of the non-fullerene and ternary devices could be further improved by selecting appropriate non-fullerene acceptors with matched energy levels and complementary absorption range.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized a new type of polymer by breaking the traditional D–A or D–π–A–π configuration. Through the modification of the backbone, the elaborately designed polymer P1T with a repeat unit of D–π–A or D–A–π exhibited significant advantage in solubility in non-halogenated solvents. And in terms of the PCE, the P1T device outperformed its traditional counterparts with enhanced charge mobilities, reduced recombination, improved morphology and an obvious π–π stacking peak. More importantly, the P1T device exhibited the optimal PCE with an active layer thickness of over 200 nm and showed no batch-to-batch difference as processed from non-halogenated solvents, demonstrating that it is potentially applicable in solution printing technology in future. The non-fullerene and ternary PSCs were also successfully realized by employing P1T as the donor material while still using non-halogenated solvents, implying the application feasibility of the new type of molecular structure in most PSC systems. The universality of this molecular modification in other polymer systems is being studied in our lab, which may offer a significant prospect for realizing non-halogenated processing for most of the highly efficient PSCs employing polymer donors and/or acceptors.
