    , Accepted 9th September 2020First published on 30th September 2020AbstractIt is greatly in demand but still challenging to achieve organic photodetectors (OPDs) having both spectrally flat response from ultraviolet to near-infrared and high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). Herein, ternary photomultiplication (PM)-type OPDs are fabricated with two donors and one acceptor in the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layers. Under −25 V bias, the optimized ternary OPD exhibits a relatively flat EQE spectrum from 330 to 810 nm with an average EQE of 3.3 × 105% which is more than 40 times larger than that of the binary OPD. In particular, an EQE up to 5.1 × 105% at 380 nm is obtained for the ternary OPD, representing a record high value among all reported OPDs to the best of our knowledge. Compared to the binary OPD under −25 V bias and 380 nm light illumination, the linear response range of the ternary OPD under the same conditions is 4.5 times larger. Moreover, the ternary OPD shows a rise time of ∼42 ms which is more than one-fold faster than the binary OPD under the same conditions. Therefore, a ternary BHJ provides an effective strategy to develop broadband OPDs with improved EQEs, extended linear response range, faster response, and spectrally flat response from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region.
Introduction
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) are optoelectronic devices which use organic semiconductors as active layers to detect optical signals via electronic processes. With the intrinsic features of organic materials, OPDs can be integrated into various types of promising wearable electronics with the advantages of light-weight, low-cost, solution-processability, and good flexibility.1–3 According to their spectral responsivity bandwidth, OPDs can be classified as narrowband (wavelength-selective) and broadband (panchromatic) devices.2,3 Generally, narrowband OPDs can be used for visible light communication, color discrimination and image sensing, while broadband OPDs can be used in the fields of optical remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and optical spectroscopy instruments.3–6 Moreover, broadband OPDs can also be used for wavelength-selective light detection in combination with a set of color filters.7,8 External quantum efficiency (EQE) is one of main performance metrics of photodetectors to evaluate the conversion efficiency of the number of carriers produced per photon.9,10 Therefore, EQEs of photodetectors are proportional to photocurrent density and are directly related to their responsivity and detectivity.11 Photodetectors with EQEs much higher than 100% can work as optical amplifiers without using a preamplifier circuit.12 Moreover, the broadband OPDs with flat photoresponse can be directly used as optical powermeters for radiometric applications without additional compensation filters.8 Especially for the transfer standard radiometer, one key feature is that no optical elements are needed because it has a flat spectral-response from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared region.13 Accordingly, for the broadband OPDs, it is of importance to have spectrally flat response with high EQEs over the selected wavelength window.
In the past decade, several broadband OPDs have been reported by using a donor material with an acceptor material to construct binary bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layers. However, most EQE spectra of these binary broadband OPDs are not flat.1,14–16 At the same time, their photon responsivities should be improved further. For example, Gong et al. reported a binary OPD exhibiting a spectral-response range from 300 to 1450 nm with EQEs less than 100%.1 In their work, the highest EQE of the OPD under −0.5 V bias was obtained at 400 nm, and the value is about 3 times as large as that obtained at 650 nm. Nie et al. also reported a binary OPD with a spectral-response range from 350 to 900 nm.14 For the OPD, the highest EQE of 1.59 × 105% was achieved under 10 V bias, but the value at 730 nm is about 6 times as large as that at 510 nm under 1.0 V bias. By using [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the electron donor, Zhang et al. fabricated binary photomultiplication (PM)-type OPDs which exhibited a spectral-response range from 320 to 700 nm with a distinct dip.15 Correspondingly, the optimal OPD under −19 V bias showed the highest EQE of 1.16 × 105% at 610 nm, which is about 3 times as large as that at 510 nm. Later on, the same research group replaced the electron acceptor of PC71BM with a nonfullerene acceptor to extend the spectral-response range of binary PM-type OPDs to the near-infrared region.16 Under −20 V bias, the optimized OPD exhibited the highest EQE of 2.8 × 104% at 390 nm which is twice as large as that at 510 nm, and 6 times larger than that at 750 nm (4.0 × 103%). Recently, Armin et al. fabricated binary OPDs by using the electron acceptor of PC71BM blended with a wide bandgap donor polymer of poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothidizole)] (PCDTBT).17 The resulting OPDs under −1 V bias showed a relatively flat EQE spectrum from 350 to 610 nm but an average EQE of only ∼70%. So far, it has still been difficult to achieve binary OPDs exhibiting simultaneously high EQEs and flat EQE spectra in the wavelength region from ultraviolet to near-infrared.
In recent years, ternary BHJ active layers, which consist of two donors with one acceptor, or two acceptors with one donor, have been used to effectively improve EQEs or extend the spectral-response range of organic solar cells.18–20 With the same photon to electron conversion effect shared by OPDs and organic solar cells, doping a second donor or acceptor into binary active layers should be also an effective strategy to achieve OPDs with an even and extended spectral-response. Pioneer work has been demonstrated by Zhang et al. who used a low bandgap material (poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate], PTB7-Th) as a second donor to fabricate ternary PM-type OPDs which exhibited a broad spectral-response range from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region.21–23 Under −25 V bias, the ternary OPDs based on P3HT:PTB7-Th:PC71BM (50:50:1, w/w/w) showed the highest EQE of 4.6 × 104% at 390 nm, which is 21% larger than that at 750 nm, and about 80% larger than that at 510 nm.23 Although the spectral-response range of the ternary OPDs has been extended, the whole EQE spectrum is not flat with obvious dips. The dip in EQE spectrum will become shallower if the absorption spectra of two donors with one acceptor (or two acceptors with one donor) are more complementary.16 Compared to PC71BM, a nonfullerene acceptor of 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((5,5′-(4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)-oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IEICO) shows a narrow optical bandgap of 1.37 eV24 which is beneficial for PM-type OPDs with enhanced EQEs in the near-infrared region.
In this work, PM-type OPDs were demonstrated to have a device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:PTB7-Th:IEICO (90:10:1, w/w/w)/Al. P3HT and PTB7-Th were used as the two electron donors, while IEICO was used as the electron acceptor. Under −25 V bias, the optimized OPD exhibited a spectrally flat response from 330 to 810 nm with a highest EQE of 5.1 × 105% at 380 nm, which is 130% as large as that at 510 nm and 196% as large as that at 780 nm. As far as we know, the EQE of 5.1 × 105% is the highest among all reported OPDs based on photodiode-architecture. Compared to the best binary OPD based on P3HT:IEICO (100:1, w/w) under the same bias of −25 V, the average EQE of the best ternary OPD in the range from 330 to 810 nm is 40.8 times larger. Furthermore, the linear response range of the ternary OPD is 4.5 times larger than that of the binary OPD. Moreover, the ternary OPD under −15 V bias showed a faster response time of ∼42 ms, in comparison with the response time of ∼92 ms for the binary counterpart.
Results and discussion
The ternary and binary PM-type OPDs were fabricated by using P3HT:PTB7-Th:IEICO (90:10:1, w/w/w) and P3HT:IEICO (100:1, w/w) as the BHJ active layers, respectively. Chemical structures and normalized absorption spectra of P3HT, PTB7-Th, and IEICO are displayed in Fig. 1a and b. As shown in Fig. 1b, absorption spectra of the three materials are basically complementary which are beneficial for OPDs with spectrally flat response. The device configuration diagram of OPDs is presented in Fig. 1c. When incident light irradiates from the ITO side, the light is absorbed by the materials near the ITO electrode first and then by the materials near the Al electrode.

Fig. 2a shows the EQE spectra of optimized OPDs using P3HT:PTB7-Th:IEICO (90:10:1, w/w/w) and P3HT:IEICO (100:1, w/w) as BHJ active layers under −25 V bias. The EQE spectrum of the binary OPD is relatively flat from 330 to 610 nm, which is due to the disappearance of the dip in the EQE spectrum around 510 nm. For the PM-type OPDs using P3HT:acceptor (100:1, w/w) as BHJ active layers, a small number of acceptor molecules were surrounded and isolated by a large number of P3HT molecules to form electron traps due to the large lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) difference between P3HT and acceptor.9,12 Under light illumination, photogenerated excitons on P3HT can be dissociated into charge carriers at the interfaces with acceptor molecules. Then the photogenerated electrons will be trapped in the acceptor molecules due to the lack of continuous electron transport pathways in the active layers with a rather low acceptor content. Consequently, when the light irradiates from the ITO side, the light around 510 nm is mainly absorbed by P3HT to generate electrons which are trapped in the IEICO molecules near the ITO electrode. Under large reverse bias voltages, a great deal of electrons trapped in the IEICO molecules near the ITO electrode can transport through the active layer, and be accumulated by the IEICO molecules near the Al electrode. Then more accumulated electrons near the Al electrode can promote hole-tunneling injection from an external-circuit under reverse bias voltages. Therefore, the dip in the EQE spectrum around 510 nm becomes shallower with incremental bias voltages and disappears under −25 V bias (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Moreover, the EQE spectrum shows a clear decline between 610 and 680 nm, which is codetermined by the absorption edge of P3HT and low weight ratio of IEICO in the binary active layer of P3HT:IEICO (100:1, w/w). From 680 to 810 nm, the EQE spectrum shows a clear shoulder, which is ascribed to the strong light-harvesting ability of the IEICO molecules in the long-wavelength region.

By contrast, the EQE spectrum of optimized ternary OPD is relatively flat from 330 to 810 nm under −25 V bias. From 680 to 810 nm, the EQEs of optimized ternary OPD are obviously enhanced (more than 100 times) by doping with 10% weight ratio (10 wt%) of PTB7-Th, which can be ascribed to the following two reasons: (i) the strong light-harvesting ability of PTB7-Th in the near-infrared region; (ii) more migrating electrons accumulated by the IEICO molecules near the Al electrode that can promote the hole-tunneling injection. Meanwhile, a highest EQE of 5.1 × 105% is obtained at 380 nm, which is 30% larger than that at 510 nm, and 96% larger than that at 780 nm. Among all reported OPDs based on the photodiode-architecture and BHJ active layers, 5.1 × 105% is the highest EQE, to the best of our knowledge. The typical EQEs in the literature studies of photodiode-type OPDs are plotted in Fig. 2b and summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Furthermore, the average EQE of ternary OPDs (330–810 nm) under −25 V bias is around 3.3 × 105%, which is more than 40 times larger than that of the binary OPD under the same bias voltage. For all OPDs, EQEs increase distinctly with incremental bias voltages (Fig. S1, ESI†). The possible reasons include three points:25 (i) more electrons trapped in the IEICO molecules near the Al electrode can promote the hole-tunneling injection; (ii) more interfacial band-bending can facilitate the hole-tunneling injection; (iii) the transport velocity of holes in the active layers increases with incremental bias voltages. The observed phenomenon can also be explained by the following equation:16,26 (1)
In the equation, χ is the fraction of dissociated excitons that produce trapped electrons and free-holes, τ is the lifetime of trapped-electrons, T is the transport time of holes in the active layers, μ is the field-dependent hole mobility, V is the reverse bias voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layers. Furthermore, the PM-type OPDs based on 20 wt% PTB7-Th doping were also fabricated to further demonstrate the effect of PTB7-Th doping on the EQEs of PM-type OPDs (Fig. S2, ESI†). Under −25 V bias, the resulting OPD showed an EQE of 1.5 × 105% at 380 nm, which is 29% of that of the optimized ternary OPD based on 10 wt% PTB7-Th doping under the same conditions.
The absorption spectra of blended films based on P3HT:PTB7-Th:IEICO (90:10:1, w/w/w) and P3HT:IEICO (100:1, w/w) are measured and shown in Fig. 3a. For the binary active layers, there is an absorption peak around 510 nm, which is mainly ascribed to the absorption peak of P3HT at 510 nm. Moreover, there is a small absorption shoulder from 680 to 810 nm, which is ascribed to the strong absorption band of IEICO in the long-wavelength range. When 10 wt% PTB7-Th was blended into the active layers, the absorption peak (around 510 nm) of P3HT:PTB7-Th:IEICO (90:10:1, w/w/w) is distinctly reduced, while absorption shoulder in the long-wavelength range is clearly elevated. The reduction in the absorption peak is due to the decreased ratio of P3HT in the ternary active layers. The clear shoulder in the absorption spectrum based on ternary active layers is ascribed to the strong absorption of PTB7-Th and IEICO in the long-wavelength range. It is well known that the electron trap depth of acceptor in active layers is closely related to the surrounding donors, which can be analysed by the energy level difference between the acceptor and the donor. The energy levels of P3HT, IEICO, and PTB7-Th are displayed in Fig. 3b. For the binary active layer, the electron trap depth is 1.05 eV when IEICO molecules are only isolated by P3HT. By contrast, in the ternary active layer, the electron trap depths are 1.05 and 0.31 eV when the IEICO molecules are surrounded by P3HT and PTB7-Th to form electron traps of P3HT/IEICO/P3HT and PTB7-Th/IEICO/PTB7-Th, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the schematic transport process of charge carriers in the ternary OPDs under light illumination and at reverse bias voltages. Under light illumination, photogenerated excitons on P3HT or PTB7-Th can be effectively dissociated into electrons and holes at the interfaces with IEICO molecules. In addition, IEICO can also harvest photons especially in the near-infrared region to generate holes and electrons. Then photogenerated electrons will be trapped in the IEICO molecules due to the lack of continuous electron transport pathways in the active layers with a small amount of IEICO molecules. The trapped electrons in IEICO molecules near the Al electrode will induce the interfacial band-bending to assist the hole-tunneling injection. Therefore, more trapped electrons near the Al electrode will induce more hole-tunneling injection. Moreover, the depth of electron-traps determined by the LUMO difference between IEICO and the two donors (P3HT and PTB7-Th) can significantly affect electron accumulation near the Al electrode. Under a reverse bias voltage, the migration ability of trapped electrons near the ITO electrode is codetermined by the electron mobility of materials and the depth of electron-traps. Under the same bias voltage, the migrating ability of electrons trapped by the shallow traps (0.31 eV) is better than those trapped by the deep traps (1.05 eV). It is known that EQEs of PM-type OPDs strongly depend on the hole-tunneling injection which is determined by the quantity of trapped electrons near the Al electrode.11,27 With incremental bias voltages, more trapped electrons migrated from the IEICO molecules near the ITO electrode to the IEICO molecules near the Al electrode, which can enhance the hole-tunneling injection from the external-circuit. Therefore, with increasing bias voltages, the dip (around 510 nm) in the EQE spectra of the ternary OPD disappears more quickly than that of the binary OPD (Fig. S1, ESI†). This physics can be also used for explaining the phenomenon that EQEs of ternary OPDs are in order of magnitude larger than those of binary OPDs under the same conditions.

It is well known that responsivity and detectivity are two important parameters to evaluate the performance of OPDs. Especially for broadband systems, flat responsivity and detectivity spectra with high values are desirable. The responsivity (R), noise equivalent power (NEP), and detectivity (D*) values are calculated according to the following equations:21,22,28,29 (2) (3) (4)here, λ is the wavelength of incident light, in is the noise current, and S is the active area of the devices (∼4 mm2). The in of the OPDs was obtained by the fast Fourier transformation of dark-current versus time under −25 V bias (Fig. S3, ESI†). It means that the in of the OPDs is determined by 1/f noise in the frequency range of <1 Hz. At the frequency of 1 Hz, the in values of the ternary and binary OPDs under −25 V bias are 4.65 × 10−11 and 6.77 × 10−11 A Hz−1/2, respectively. The shot noise (is) from the dark current can be calculated using the following equation: (5)here, q is the elementary charge and Id is the current of the devices under dark. Under −25 V bias, the Id values of the ternary and binary OPDs are 256 and 2.68 μA, respectively. Then, the is values of the ternary and binary OPDs can be obtained as 9.05 × 10−12 and 9.26 × 10−13 A Hz−1/2, respectively. Based on the in at 1 Hz, the NEP of the ternary OPDs was calculated to be lower than 4.7 × 10−14 W Hz−1/2 (330–810 nm), suggesting that a light intensity of more than 1.2 pW cm−2 can be detected in this range (Fig. S4, ESI†). For the binary OPDs, the NEP (based on the in at 1 Hz) is 2.0 × 10−12 W Hz−1/2 under 380 nm light illumination, suggesting that the weak light detection-limit at this wavelength is about 50.0 pW cm−2. The responsivity and detectivity spectra of the optimized ternary and binary OPDs under −25 V bias are shown in Fig. 5. Both the responsivity and detectivity spectra of the optimized ternary OPD are flat from 330 to 810 nm. For example, the responsivity and detectivity of the OPD at the wavelengths of 380 and 510 nm are 1570 A W−1 and 6.7 × 1012 Jones, respectively. At a longer wavelength of 780 nm, the ternary OPD shows only slightly higher responsivity and detectivity values of 1654 A W−1 and 7.1 × 1012 Jones, respectively. By contrast, the responsivity and detectivity spectra of the binary OPD are uneven in the wavelength from 330 to 810 nm. Moreover, the average responsivity and detectivity values of the ternary OPD (330–810 nm) are 43.8 and 64.0 times as large as those of the binary OPD under the same bias of −25 V. In particular, in the wavelength range from 680 to 810 nm, the average responsivity and detectivity values of the ternary OPD (under −25 V bias) are 114.3 and 172.9 times larger than those of the binary OPD, respectively. The typical responsivity and detectivity values of the optimized ternary and binary OPDs are summarized in Table 1.

To evaluate the performance of PM-type OPDs, the photocurrent density (Jph) under light illumination and bias voltages should be obtained. Fig. 6a shows the Jph–voltage (V) characteristics of the optimized OPDs using P3HT:PTB7-Th:IEICO (90:10:1, w/w/w) and P3HT:IEICO (100:1, w/w) as the active layers. Under light illumination with 1.5 mW cm−2, there is an obvious enhancement of Jph when 10 wt% PTB7-Th was blended into the binary active layer. The phenomenon can be ascribed to the following two reasons: (i) the better hole-transport ability of PTB7-Th than that of P3HT;30,31 (ii) the better migration ability for electrons trapped by the shallow traps (0.31 eV) than those trapped by the deep traps (1.05 eV) under the same conditions. Under different light intensities, current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized ternary and binary OPDs were measured and shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The J of OPDs is gradually improved with incremental light intensities, which is also related to more trapped electrons near the Al electrode thereby inducing more hole-tunneling injection. Under the same light intensity and bias voltage, the J of optimized ternary OPD is distinctly larger than that of optimized binary OPD. The observed phenomena in J–V characteristics of optimized ternary and binary OPDs are in agreement with the observed phenomena in EQE spectra.
 Fig. 6  (a) Jph–V characteristics of the optimized OPDs based on P3HT:PTB7-Th:IEICO (90:10:1, w/w/w) and P3HT:IEICO (100:1, w/w) under light illumination with an intensity of 1.5 mW cm−2; (b) linear dynamic range (LDR) of the optimized ternary and binary OPDs under 380 nm light illumination and −25 V bias; (c) normalized transient-response characteristics (with a period of ∼3 s) of the optimized ternary and binary OPDs under −15 V bias. 
The linear dynamic range (LDR) is another important parameter to evaluate the photosensitivity linearity of OPDs and quantify the detectable linear range. In order to obtain the LDR of optimized ternary and binary OPDs, the Jph–light intensity (Iin) characteristics of OPDs were measured under −25 V bias and with 380 nm light illumination at Iin varying from 5.20 × 10−10 to 6.28 × 10−3 W cm−2, as shown in Fig. 6b. The LDR was calculated according to the following equation:32 (6)Here, Iin-upper represents the maximum light intensity in the detectable linear range while Iin-lower denotes the minimum light intensity. Under −25 V bias, the optimized ternary OPD shows a linear response with 380 nm light illumination at Iin varying from 2.65 × 10−9 to 2.23 × 10−3 W cm−2, exhibiting an LDR of ∼118 dB. The optimized ternary OPD begins to deviate from its linearity when Iin is lower than 2.65 × 10−9 W cm−2, which is due to the weak hole-tunneling injection assisted by the rather less trapped electrons in IEICO molecules near the Al electrode. When Iin is higher than 2.23 × 10−3 W cm−2, the optimized ternary OPD loses its linearity which is caused by the electron trapping saturation. By contrast, under the same conditions, the optimized binary OPD shows a linear response with Iin ranging from 1.95 × 10−8 to 2.96 × 10−3 W cm−2 which corresponds to an LDR of ∼104 dB. Thus, the linear response range of optimized ternary OPD to incident light intensity is 5.5 times as large as that of the binary counterpart. Therefore, the use of ternary BHJ active layers is an effective method to fabricate OPDs with an extended linear dynamic range.
In order to further comprehend the influence of 10 wt% PTB7-Th doping, transient-response characteristics of the ternary and binary OPDs were measured (under 506 nm light illumination with an intensity of 40 μW cm−2) and shown in Fig. 6c. The rise time (defined as the response time from 10% to 90% of peak values) of the ternary OPD under −15 V bias is about 42 ms, which is more than 1-fold shorter than that for the optimized binary OPD (92 ms) under the same bias voltage. With 10 wt% PTB7-Th doping, the light absorption at the wavelengths around 510 nm by the P3HT near the ITO electrode is reduced. Then more light at the wavelengths around 510 nm can reach the materials near the Al electrode. Therefore, there are more trapped electrons accumulated by the IEICO molecules near the Al electrode to assist hole-tunneling injection. For the binary OPD, there is only one type electron-trap in the active layer, i.e. P3HT/IEICO/P3HT (1.05 eV). The relatively deep traps (1.05 eV) will prevent trapped electrons near the ITO electrode migrating to the IEICO molecules near the Al electrode under reverse bias voltages. Therefore, it takes more time for the IEICO molecules near the Al electrode to trap electrons to achieve a saturation state under a reverse bias voltage. For the ternary OPD, there may be two kinds of electron traps in the active layer, i.e. P3HT/IEICO/P3HT and PTB7-Th/IEICO/PTB7-Th. For the electron trap of PTB7-Th/IEICO/PTB7-Th, the trap depth is relatively shallow (∼0.31 eV), which induces an enhanced migrating ability of trapped-electrons near the ITO electrode under reverse bias voltages. Therefore, it takes less time for the IEICO molecules near the Al electrode to trap electrons to achieve the saturation state under a reverse bias voltage. The reasons given above can explain the response speed of the optimized ternary OPD under incident light is faster than that of the optimized binary OPD under the same conditions. Thus, the accelerated response speed of OPDs can be realized by doping another donor into the active layers to adjust the depth of electron traps and control trapped electrons distribution near the electrodes. Finally, the frequency dependent responsivity of the optimized ternary and binary OPDs under −15 V bias was measured and shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The −3 dB frequencies are 19 and 27 Hz for the optimized ternary and binary OPDs under −15 V bias and 506 nm light illumination (40 μW cm−2), respectively. The small −3 dB frequencies are due to the relatively slow response speed of the OPDs.
Experimental
The fabrication and measurements of PM-type OPDs are described in details in the ESI.†
Conclusions
In summary, ternary and binary PM-type OPDs were fabricated by using P3HT:PTB7-Th:IEICO (90:10:1, w/w/w) and P3HT:IEICO (100:1, w/w) as BHJ active layers, respectively. Under −25 V bias, the optimized ternary OPD showed a relatively flat EQE spectrum from 330 to 810 nm with the highest EQE of 5.1 × 105% at 380 nm. As far as we know, this record EQE is the highest among all reported OPDs based on the photodiode-architecture. In the wavelength range from 330 to 810 nm, the average EQE of ternary OPD under −25 V bias is 3.3 × 105%, which is 40.8 times larger than that of the binary OPD under the same conditions. Especially in the range from 680 to 810 nm, the average EQE of optimized ternary OPD under −25 V is more than 100 times larger than that of the binary counterpart. Furthermore, the linear response range of ternary OPD is 4.5 times larger than that of the binary OPD. Under light illumination, the ternary OPD at −15 V bias exhibited a rise time of ∼42 ms, which is more than 100% shorter than that of the binary OPD. Therefore, the strategy of incorporating a second donor component with complementary absorption and tailored energy levels to form ternary BHJ active layers, is promising for broadband OPDs with spectrally flatter response from ultraviolet to near-infrared region, enhanced EQEs, increased linear response range as well as faster response time.
