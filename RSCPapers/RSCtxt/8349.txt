    , Accepted 7th March 2023First published on 8th March 2023AbstractIn the last few years, renewable, inexpensive, biocompatible, and biodegradable wood and lignocellulose materials have triggered considerable research interest for application in various functional devices. However, there is still a lack of a new perspective to deeply understand the structure–property–function relationships of micro-/nanostructures and components of natural wood, so as to explore the potential of wood assembly of nano-energy materials with different dimensions. Herein, the recent progresses in the design and construction of free-standing supercapacitor (SC) electrodes containing wood-derived materials are reviewed. We begin with an illustrated introduction to the hierarchical structure and characteristics of natural wood with a “top–down” view, which includes the cell walls, cellulose microfibers, nanocellulose, and cellulose supramolecules. Next, the fabrication, structure, and properties of lignocellulose are highlighted. We focus on the structure–property–function relationships between the hierarchical micro- and nanoscale structure of wood and electroactive materials. The focus then turns to a summary of the recent advances in wood-based free-standing SC electrodes with a unique point that is ever out of the spotlight, including one-dimensional integrated fibers, two-dimensional flexible films/papers, three-dimensional porous hydrogels/aerogels, and ultra-thick electrodes. Finally, we put forward our perspectives on the challenges to further promoting the development of this emerging field in the future.
1 Introduction
Due to the continuing irreversible depletion of fossil-fuel resources (such as coal, gas, and oil) and global climate change caused by the discharge of industrial waste, it is urgent to develop efficient, sustainable, and green energy storage and conversion systems, in which abundant and renewable materials and eco-efficient synthetic strategies are integrated.1,2 Supercapacitors (SCs) are a highly attractive option in virtue of their remarkable properties including fast rate of charge/discharge, reversibility, high power density, long life span (>5000 cycles), safety, and excellent mechanical performance.3–5 Hence, the SC is expected to serve as the power pivot of consumer electronics, hybrid vehicles, industrial equipment, and so on. For the past few decades, the main focal points of SC research have been the development of electrode materials with high specific capacitance and high cycle stability to improve the energy density and service life of devices, and great progress has been taking place.2,6,7 However, inexpensiveness, elemental abundance, sustainability, eco-friendliness, and recyclability have been raised as the main challenges for SCs when used as power sources of next-generation green and sustainable electronics.8,9 To address these issues requires exploiting novel renewable materials and introducing state-of-the-art technology.
As is well known, wood is a kind of old material with properties of renewability, good workability, low thermal expansion, and desirable mechanical strength among a significant number of alternative materials. With the now available mature technologies (mechanical processing, drying, preservatives), it is easy to obtain a high volume of industrial raw materials from trees, which are widely used in various fields like the building industry, furniture manufacturing, paper making, biorefinery, and industrial or household fuel. Particularly, wood possesses unique hierarchical porous structures directionally built by molecular-, nano-, and microscale accumulation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which enlighten more design and construction in promising nanomaterials.10
Recently, the functionalized applications of renewable, inexpensive, biocompatible and biodegradable wood and lignocellulose materials have been of great interest to many researchers who focus on alleviating the pressures of energy shortage and environmental pollution. Supramolecular self-assembly and surface modification technologies enable bulk nature wood to transform into functional products at various scales, encompassing novel wood-based functional systems (such as compact wood,11–13 transparent wood,14,15 flexible wood,16 and wood sponge/aerogel17,18), cellulose-based one-dimensional (1D) fibers,19–21 two-dimensional (2D) flexible films/papers,22–26 and three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels27–29 and aerogels.30–33 It is believed that these green biomaterials derived from wood will play a great part in future advanced applications.
In the field of energy harvesting and conversion systems, great headway in developing various wood-derived materials for applications has been made, like lithium-/sodium-ion batteries,34–37 SCs,38–41 hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction,42–44 solar cells,45–47 and nanometric generators.48–50 In addition to the resource abundance, sustainability and good biocompatibility of wood, the merits of unique hierarchical cell structure, mechanical flexibility, abundant oxygen-containing functional groups, and high carbon content might live up to its tremendous potential, specifically concerning wood-based electrode materials for SCs. Several reviews of the structure, chemistry, and performance of lignocellulose and the preparation, characterization, and energy storage performance of cellulose-based conductive materials have been published.51–54 They lack systematic discussions on the structure and characteristics of native wood at different levels from a top–down view. Actually, the building blocks at various scales within wood cell walls have interesting structural properties, which allow the reassembly of multi-dimensional porous substrates for constructing hybrid electrode materials. Besides, the effect of the conductive components in composites, like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, conductive polymers, and metallic nanoparticles, are paid more attention to instead of the structural and chemical functions of wood and cellulose-based materials contributing to electrochemical systems.55,56 Huang et al. summarized the hierarchically porous structure of wood and the composition characteristics of multilayer cellulose, but only natural wood with anisotropic straight channels was discussed in the application of electrochemical energy storage devices.57 The reviews from Hu's group focused on wood-based materials in emerging energy applications.58,59 They presented a detailed discussion on the structure and chemical properties of various wood-based materials, including modified wood, cellulose paper, and nanocellulose, while the perspective on the design and fabrication of different scale wood-derived SC electrode materials is rare. There is still a dearth of systematic work that focuses on the progress of design and application in multi-dimensional SC electrodes from solid wood to nanoscale cellulose.
In view of the rapid growth and promising future of this field, herein we strive to make a tutorial review paper that closely connects different-scale wood-based cellulose properties with SC electrode materials (Fig. 1), for the purpose of providing a new idea for designing and fabricating advanced energy storage systems. In this paper, we specifically focus on the recent progress in the construction and application of multi-dimensional SC freestanding electrodes using diverse advanced wood-derived materials with features of various scales of wood cell walls. We emphasize that green, abundant, renewable, inexpensive wood can be derived into a variety of interesting new materials and applied to energy storage devices via various advanced nanotechnologies. From an ordinary piece of wood to 3D porous thick electrodes, flexible hydrogels, lightweight aerogels, 2D flexible film/paper, and even woven and wearable 1D long conductive fibers, they have great potential in aerospace, daily transportation, portable electronics, smart clothing, and electronic skin. The purpose of this review is to provide theoretical and technological references for further development of wood nanotechnologies and expanding the application fields of wood advanced functional materials.

2 Structure and characteristics of wood
There are roughly 73000 species of trees worldwide that have been found to date.65 Common industrial wood can be divided into two main categories: softwood (pine, fir, cypress, etc.) and hardwood (poplar, bass, paulownia, balsa, etc.). There are obvious differences in their macro- and microstructure as shown in Fig. 2a and b. More than 90% of elements of softwood are axal tracheids, which play roles in both mass transfer and mechanical strength to the tree trunk. While hardwood is mainly composed of large-diameter vessels and thick-wall wood fibres (≈50%). The vessels function as channels and the wood fibres take part in mechanical support. These hollow-tube-like cell elements endow bulk wood with high porosity and large specific surface area, as well as hierarchical anisotropic structure, which can also shorten the distance of paths for rapid mass transport. In addition, these “transmission paths” are not sealed, but are connected each other through the transverse elements of ray cells (radial planar cellular structures that are perpendicular to the axial tracheid) and many well-distributed voids with uniform diameter. This is a pivotal factor to obtain excellent water-retaining capacity and allows the cross-transmission of electrolyte and improves the electrochemical reaction rate.66

Regardless of the species of tree, wood is a kind of biopolymer composite material (including ≈40–50 wt% cellulose, ≈10–30 wt% hemicellulose, and ≈20–30 wt% lignin) with a hierarchically anisotropic porous structure (micro-, meso-, and macropores). The hierarchical micro- and nanostructures at different levels from a top–down view for all species of wood can be depicted visually, as shown in Fig. 2c.10,12,59 At the macro level, wood is processed into panel or timber and generally used as framework and decorative materials for architecture, transportation, and furniture fabrication because of the properties of lightweight, excellent mechanical strength, tensile resistance, and artistic grain texture. From a micro point of view, wood is a porous fiber-reinforced laminated composite consisting of numerous continuous well-oriented vessels and lumens at millimeter size, where nutrient solution is transported for the maintenance of tree growth. Continuing with higher magnification, the middle lamella (ML), the thin primary cell wall (P), and the thicker secondary cell wall constitute the wood cell walls, which make up a large part of the mass of wood. The secondary cell wall is usually divided into three layers, denoted as S1, S2, and S3. It can be observed that the orientation and arrangement of cellulose fibrils in each layer display several differences due to the structural adaptation during the growth of the tree.67 In the nanostructure of wood cell walls, cellulose serves as the skeleton of ordered microfibers and glues together with hemicellulose and lignin, contributing to the toughness and rigidity of wood. The interspaces within the well-oriented vessels and cellulose microfibers represent the hierarchically porous nanostructure of wood, including macropores (>50 nm) and mesopores (2–50 nm), which endows wood with characteristics of large specific surface area and light weight. On this nanometer scale, cellulose microfibers can be further split into more sophisticated nanofibrils that consist of tens of 1.5–3.5 nm elementary fibrils, thus providing abundant micropores (<2 nm).68 These individual elementary fibrils assemble with each other by intermolecular interaction to form ordered or crystalline regions interspersed with disordered or amorphous regions. At the supramolecular level, polar cellulose molecular chains with the formula (C6H10O5)n consisting of β-1,4 anhydroglucose units parallel stack adjacently through intra- and interchain hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to assemble nanofibrils, which gives wood its remarkable strength. The abundant oxygen-containing groups (such as hydroxyl groups (–OH) and carboxyl groups (–CH3OH)) on the benzene ring confer good hydrophilicity and chemical activity on cellulose, which is amenable to the introduction of new functional molecules to give cellulose derivatives.69 Moreover, the robust hydrogen bond networks and large aspect ratio make cellulose a stable biopolymer with high axial stiffness and the ability to develop numerous stable electrostatic interactions.70–72
Indeed, from macroscale to nanoscale of wood, each building block of wood has its particular and interconnected attributes, which can inspire the design and manufacture of various advanced functional materials.73,74 Given different morphologies and physicochemical properties of various wood and lignocellulose materials, the multiscale biomaterials and carbon materials derived from wood impart a variety of advantages to electrochemical storage devices, especially for SCs.
3 Fabrication, structure, and properties of cellulose
Based on the longitudinal dimension and diameter of individual cellulose fibrils, and fabrication method, wood-based cellulose is generally divided into cellulose microfiber (CMF) and nanocellulose (including cellulose nanofibril (CNF) and nanocrystal (CNC)). A holistic understanding of the fabrication, structure and properties of cellulose is of the utmost importance to the design and construction of cellulose-based electrodes. The morphologies and structures of cellulose, extracted from wood by the “top–down” strategy, are shown in Fig. 3, and their primary characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

3.1 CMF
CMF is obtained from wood through chemical delignification combined with mechanical isolation. The typical sectional dimension of CMF is from a few to tens of micrometers and the longitudinal dimension is several hundred micrometers. These fibers have roughened surfaces and abundant active groups, which can intertwine through hydrogen bonds to assemble films with high mechanical strength by vacuum filtration. On the other hand, CMF is usually used in the form of ordinary cellulose paper, because the paper obtained by industrial papermaking technology has a lower cost. Within a common cellulose paper, rough and long fibers are interwoven to form a 3D porous network structure, which endows the cellulose paper with high mechanical strength and good flexibility (such as repeated bending, twisting, folding/unfolding, and stretching), making it a good substrate for green and low-cost flexible energy storage devices.51 However, the crystallinity of CMF is usually lower than 60%, and water can easily penetrate the amorphous region of microfibers, which leads to the expansion of the fibers and the significant degradation of their mechanical properties. This means that cellulose paper is more suitable for fabricating non-aqueous SC devices.80,81
3.2 Nanocellulose
Nanocellulose is well known for its intrinsic mechanical strength, flexibility, biocompatibility, earth abundance, light weight, thermal stability, ease of modification, and fibrous morphology with nanoscale dimension.58 Wood-based nanocellulose can be categorized into CNF and CNC according to morphologies and dimensions. Various fabrication methods result in different structures and characteristics of nanocellulose. Here, we mainly describe the relevant information concerning CNF and CNC isolated from wood by combination methods of mechanical, chemical, or enzymatic processes.

3.2.1 CNF. 
CNF has large aspect ratio with a length greater than 2 μm and displays web-like entangled structures, resulting in large specific surface area.82 CNF from wood cell walls is generally prepared through a mechanical fibrillation process. Several mechanical methods are available for the preparation of CNF including high-pressure homogenization, micro-fluidization, high-intensity ultrasonication, and steam explosion.83–85 In a typical mechanical process, the structure of cell walls and hydrogen bonds are destroyed by high-speed shear and constant friction without causing degradation to the cellulose, allowing the extraction of CNF with a diameter of less than 100 nm and a length of 500 nm or longer. However, inhomogeneity and high energy consumption are unavoidable in the preparation of CNF by mechanical methods.86 Chemical pretreatment before nanofibrillation is an efficient approach to minimize the energy requirement and improve the nanofibrillation degree. For example, Isogai and coworkers prepared completely individualized CNF from wood cellulose fibers by a pioneering approach of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO) oxidation under moderate aqueous conditions.87–89 The C6 primary hydroxyls of cellulose can be converted to anionically charged C6 carboxylate groups by TEMPO-mediated oxidation, which forms strong electrostatic repulsion between nanocellulose in water and renders excellent dispersibility. However, the carboxylated CNF generally suffers from a low degree of polymerization and an inferior thermal stability.90 Enzymatic treatment of wood cellulose is a mild and environmentally friendly way, enabling a decrease in required energy consumption for nanofibrillation processes.91,92 Paakko et al.93 combined enzymatic hydrolysis with mechanical shearing and high-pressure homogenization to prepare CNF that mainly consists of fibrils with a diameter of ca. 5–6 nm and fibril aggregates around 10–20 nm. In this enzyme pretreatment, the monocomponent endoglucanase enzyme promoted cell wall delamination and prevented the blocking of the homogenizer even in small-amount addition.94


3.2.2 CNC. 
Compared with CNF, rod-like CNC is much shorter (100–250 nm), and has much lower aspect ratios and higher crystallinity. Acid hydrolysis is the main approach to extract CNCs from lignocellulosic fibers, with acids such as hydrochloric acid,95,96 sulfuric acid,97–99 maleic acid,77,100 and oxalic acid.101,102 When encountering strong acids, the amorphous regions of cellulose molecular chains with disordered arrangement are disrupted whereas the CNCs in crystalline regions remain intact. Sulfuric acid with high concentration of 64 wt% is commonly used at 45 °C to fabricate CNCs of about 5–20 nm in diameter and approximately 100–250 nm in length. In this condition, some surface hydroxyl groups of cellulose are converted into sulfate esters that lead to electrostatic repulsion to stabilize aqueous dispersion of CNCs. The obtained suspension is subsequently diluted with water and washed with successive centrifugations for purification. Dialysis against distilled water is then performed to further remove any free acid molecules from the dispersion. Such CNCs from mineral acid, especially sulfuric acid, have poor thermal stability because the sulfate group possesses a significant barrier for thermal processing in composites.52 In addition, the economic recovery of acids is difficult to achieve because of the large amount of acid that has to be used when conducting hydrolysis at high acid concentrations. By contrast, use of organic dicarboxylic acids (such as maleic acid and oxalic acid) enables full chemical recovery and the resulting CNCs are thermally stable. What is more, the resultant CNCs typically have a longer length (≈300 nm), greater diameter (10–30 nm), and higher crystallinity than the CNCs produced using sulfuric acid.

4 Functions of wood and cellulose within SC electrodes
The main challenge for SCs is often considered to be the development of novel electrodes with increased high energy density comparable to that of current rechargeable batteries, while maintaining their inherent high power density and long cycling life.103 Besides, the development of sustainable, low-cost, lightweight, flexible, ultra-thin or thick electrodes for high-performance SCs is also the prerequisite for various practical applications. Considering the unique physical and chemical properties of wood, the functional contributions of wood and wood-derived cellulose materials to composite systems can be roughly summarized as being in four categories, i.e. (i) a lightweight porous skeleton that induces the organized assembly of active nanomaterials with high mass loading and facilitates the transfer of ions and electrons; (ii) a flexible substrate that supports electroactive materials and endows a free-standing electrode with mechanical flexibility and strength; (iii) a biocompatible adhesive for supramolecular crosslinking with conductive materials; and (iv) an electroactive component for promoting the kinetics of electrochemical reactions of electrodes.
Representative examples of the structure–function–property relationships of wood-derived materials are summarized in Table 2. In this section, we aim to elaborate on the functional contributions of wood and its cellulose derivatives for the design and fabrication of SC electrodes.

4.1 Porous skeletons
Nanocarbon materials including graphene and CNTs have been widely investigated for SCs. However, they are prone to stack and difficult to disperse in solvents due to van der Waals forces and lack of surface functional groups, resulting in the increased resistance of electrodes and strongly limiting their applications in many fields.129,130 Besides, to fabricate binder-free electrodes, the synthesis of various ordered ECPs or metallic oxide nanostructures (such as PANI nanorods,131 PPy nanowires,132 MnO2 nanosheets,133 NiCo2O4 nanorods134) often relies on substrate materials with open-pore microstructure, which ensures the good interfacial bonding within the orderly arrays of active components and minimizes interface resistance, facilitating charge transfer reactions. Impressive progress has already been achieved in designing novel electrode materials by using natural wood and lignocellulose as porous skeletons which provide the template for the growing of conductive nanomaterials and contribute to collection and transfer of ions. For example, anisotropic wood with hierarchically straight channels permits controlled assembly of capacitive nanoparticles on the cell walls by simple methods, resulting in high-mass-loading and high-energy-density SC electrodes.57 Besides, highly porous cellulose products with micron- and nano-sized interconnected pores (such as cellulose paper, nanopaper, and aerogel), serving as the porous scaffold of composite systems, afford more active site for grafting capacitive nanomaterials due to richer oxygen-containing functional groups being exposed on the surface.55 The resulting robust networks comprised of cellulose fiber core and conductive sheath enlarge the accessible electrochemical area of the capacitive components, which improves the electrochemical performances of capacitance, rate performance, and cycle life for composites.
4.2 Flexible substrates
The emerging portable, foldable, and compact electronic products require energy storage devices to be equipped with considerable flexibility, stretchability, and low weight.61,135 It is a grand challenge to maintain good electrochemical properties for flexible SCs when they are bent, folded, deformed or even tailored. Thus, there is a crucial need for the development of electrode materials with robust repeatable flexibility. In recent years, the research on binder-free SC electrodes using cellulose as flexible building block for structure reinforcement has exploded due to fascinating characteristics including high mechanical strength, good flexibility, and high porosity. Because of its easy availability and inexpensiveness, commercial paper is by far the most exploited substrate for flexible SCs, making it possible to scale up the manufacturing of cellulose-based electrodes.80 In a typical graphene-cellulose paper electrode, finely dispersed graphene nanosheets are retained in a cellulose network via simple filtration, coating or printing of slurry, the cellulose paper providing good mechanical strength, flexibility, and structural stability, enabling the composite electrode to store energy upon repeated bending and folding without a dramatic decline in the electrochemical performance.60,136 Besides, compared with polyester fibers, such a biocompatible cellulose product has excellent water and gas permeability benefiting from the porous structure and abundant functional groups, which are essential for wearable devices.53,137 In addition to commercial paper, nanocellulose-based flexible films, fibers, and aerogels with assembly induced by molecular chain rearrangement are also employed for lightweight substrate layers that endow active materials with mechanical flexibility and strength.
4.3 Adhesives
The conventional powder-like capacitive nanomaterials to be used in bulk electrodes inevitably require binders such as polyvinylidene fluoride.138 Therefore, the binder plays a crucial role in electrode processing. However, those common adhesive additives are usually accompanied by toxic and unrecyclable solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.139 In the light of its biodegradability and biocompatibility, as well as fluid transfer properties, low thermal expansion, and mechanical flexibility, nanocellulose is suitable to serve as a valid alternative adhesive for binding with active materials to assemble freestanding electrodes.140 In a fabrication process of MWCNT/GO nanofilm, CNC was employed as a binder in addition to enhancing the dispersion of MWCNT/GO composites, imparting to the freestanding electrode a high conductivity of 892 S m−1 with elevated mechanical properties.141 Cao et al. demonstrated that a freestanding flexible electrode can be created by using CNF as both building skeleton and green binder with no addition of any volatile or toxic organic solvents.142 Besides, at the end of SC device life, cellulose components are easily recyclable and eco-friendly.
4.4 Electroactive components
As wood is the largest renewable natural carbon source on earth, it has also been employed as the precursor (raw material, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) of activated carbon for SCs. Wood- and cellulose-derived carbon materials can be found in the form of carbonized wood (CW),143 carbon paper,144 carbon fibers,145 and carbon aerogels,146 which not only are used as porous self-supporting carbon electrode materials with high conductivity and high specific surface area, but also serve as conductive plates to anchor other nanocarbon and pseudocapacitive materials, giving increased conductivity and enhanced electrochemical stability of composite systems.
As is well known, to fabricate activated carbon (AC) materials for eligible SC electrodes, it is inescapable to consider factors including synthesis temperature, surface functional groups, specific surface area, porosity, etc.147,148 AC derived from fir wood char with a 780 °C KOH activation exhibited a high specific capacitance of 180 F g−1 in H2SO4 solution, which is higher than that of commercial AC (≈100 F g−1).149 The capacitance of a micropore-rich activated CW with a high specific area of 2967 m2 g−1 can even be up to 236 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1.108 With respect to those cellulose-based AC aerogels that carry a more developed porous network structure, the reported capacitance value is further increased to 381 F g−1 in aqueous electrolyte of 6 M KOH.150 Considering such potential capacitive properties exhibited by wood-based carbon materials, it is anticipated that novel hybrid electrodes containing electroactive carbon materials derived from wood components would present appealing performance in SC application.
5 Wood-derived SC electrodes
5.1 Wood-based thick electrodes
Natural wood inherently has hierarchical porous structures integrated by tube-like cells with low-tortuosity and anisotropic channels, which not only are conducive to facilitate ion and electron transport, but also provide natural channels and spatial sites for chemical agents to permeate throughout wood interior, and for nanomaterials to nucleate and grow in cell walls making it easy to realize high areal mass loading of active electrode materials. Wood-based anisotropic 3D thick electrodes can be fabricated by using CW as the active component directly for DLC, or by in situ growth of electroactive materials on CW, even pristine wood. The recently reported typical thick wood-based electrodes for SCs are summarized in Table 3, involving the contents from raw materials and fabrication processes to their electrochemical properties.

5.1.1 Non-carbonized wood electrodes. 
Non-carbonized wood is a kind of suitable porous skeleton for freestanding electrodes due to the excellent hydrophilic property and the abundant oxygen-containing groups on the surface of cell walls in nature, allowing the uniform deposition and stable anchorage of active electrode materials by intermolecular hydrogen bonds.160,161 For instance, Jiao et al.162 demonstrated that fully self-assembly of PANI nanorods can be realized on the surface of wood via the strong hydrogen bonds between the nitrogen lone pairs of aniline and the –OH groups of the wood substrate. Such an eco-friendly PANI/wood free-standing electrode can deliver a high specific capacitance of 304 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. This method is also valid for fabricating PPy/wood composite for SCs.163 When a piece of wood is thin enough, the flexible and elastic properties are achieved automatically because the orientation of cellulose fibrils greatly influences the mechanical performance of the cell and determines the anisotropic properties of the cell wall.152 Lv et al.104 constructed a mechanically flexible wood-based all-solid-state SC by assembling a PPy-coated wood transverse section (WTSS) composite with a thickness of 100 μm. The fabricated SC device exhibits good mechanical flexibility and has a high energy density of 48.83 mW h cm−2 and power density of 0.55 mW cm−2 for practical application.
To further enhance the electrochemical properties of 3D bulk wood thick electrodes, many studies have focused on using micro-/nanostructure engineering techniques to adjust the inherent architecture of wood cell walls. Using chemical and biological methods of structure engineering to separate and reconstruct the three components (cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose) of wood cell walls, wood precursor with more optimized structure, more abundant pores, and higher chemical affinity can be obtained (Fig. 4).66,164

Significant changes in the morphology and structure of bulk wood can be realized by selectively removing the wood components, such as hemicellulose degradation by chemical agents or lignin removal (Fig. 4a).17,165 When most of the lignin and hemicellulose are removed from wood cell walls, the wood monoliths still retain macro- and microstructural integrity while the porosity and elastic deformation considerably increase, not only reinforcing the mechanical flexibility but also facilitating the permeation of chemical modifiers and homogeneous deposition of active materials throughout the 3D hierarchical structure of wood.18 Song et al.166 reported a promising wood-based aerogel fabricated by chemical treatment of NaOH/Na2SO3 mixed solution and H2O2. After chemical treatment for 9 h, the lattices of pristine wood were almost destroyed due to the almost complete removal of lignin and hemicellulose, rendering wood a typical layered structure with attractive compressibility. Chen et al.167 separated cellulose nanofibers from the thin layer of the cell walls by completely removing lignin. The cellulose on the cell wall surface with high chemical activity was bonded with acid-treated CNTs to prepare bulk wood electrodes with excellent electrical conductivity. Due to the complete removal of lignin, a significant number of nanopores are formed on the cell walls. Exposed cellulose nanofibers can easily absorb and preserve liquid electrolytes, providing continuous channels for the transport of electrolyte ions. Xiong et al.151 reported a highly conductive lignin-free wood (LFW)@PANI composite electrode. NaClO2/HOAc as a lignin-removing agent is used to fabricate the LFW with more pores, which enables the smooth entry and uniform deposition of PANI in the wood tubes. As a result, LFW@PANI-based SC exhibited a high specific capacitance of ≈800 F g−1 and a high energy density of 41 W h kg−1. Besides, the channels of LFW can provide sufficient space for alleviating the expansion of PANI, which endows the SC with a high cycle stability of ≈96% after 5000 cycles. It is worth mentioning that the different degree of delignification process has a great effect on the original morphology and structure of wood.
The delignification process increased the accessibility to cell walls and exposed the surface of cellulose fibrils with more active oxygen-containing groups for further chemical modification. In situ fibrillation of cellulose microfibrils without introducing mechanical disintegration in bulk wood is an attractive approach to achieve functional wood with more elaborate micro-nano structures, more developed pores, and higher chemical affinity. TEMPO-mediated oxidation has been found to be an efficient chemical method for in situ nanofibrillation on the surface of delignified wood cell walls.171–173 The principle and process can be found with the preparation of TEMPO-oxidated CNF in section 3.2.1. Li et al.168 developed a novel mesoporous wood aerogel filled with individualized cellulose microfibrils via TEMPO oxidation (Fig. 4b). Such highly mesoporous structure without detriment of natural alignment and organization can be processed into aerogels with high porosity and high compressive strength. The surface area of freeze-dried mesoporous wood aerogel is 5–7 times higher than that of delignified wood.

In situ nanofibrillation can be also achieved on wood cell walls by a chemical dissolution–regeneration method. The chemical component of wood pretreated by delignification is mainly cellulose I (the existing form of natural cellulose). When it meets some green solvents like LiCl/DMAc,174 alkali hydroxide-urea,175 and ionic liquids,169,176 the ordered cellulose I nanofibers on the cell wall surface are dissolved by regulating the reaction time, temperature, and other factors. The dissolved cellulose can be further regenerated through a phase conversion process (from cellulose I to cellulose II) in a coagulation bath and the cellulose molecular chains entangle with each other via strong hydrogen bonding. After supercritical drying or vacuum freeze-drying, the disordered cellulose II on the cell wall surface usually forms a spider silk-like network structure that fills the tubular channel (Fig. 4c), which also greatly increases the specific surface area of bulk wood.
Biological modification of bulk wood is a green way to selectively remove the chemical components and tailor the porous structure of wood under mild and non-toxic reaction conditions (Fig. 4d), including enzymatic hydrolysis170,177 and fungal corrosion.178 Wang et al.179 devised a 3D thick carbon electrode via a critical enzymolysis treatment of wood to obtain a SC with high areal and volumetric energy density. They confirmed that the cellulose enzymolysis hydrolyzing cellulose in cell walls instigated abundant micropores and mesopores within the hierarchical structures of wood and the specific surface area was enlarged to 1418 m2 g−1. The assembled symmetric SC based on such 3D wood carbon electrodes delivered high volumetric energy density of 0.99 mW h cm−3 with excellent cyclic stability for 15000 cycles (86.58%) at 20 mA cm−2. 3D loose precursor with honeycomb-like fabric framework structure and ultrahigh specific surface area in wood can be achieved by fungus-induced partial biodegradability of lignin.180 After carbonization, the lignocellulosic substrate exhibited an ultrahigh specific surface area of 3439 m2 g−1, which was utilized to construct a lithium-ion hybrid SC, exhibiting a superb energy density of 263.9 W h kg−1 at 0.7 kW kg−1.


5.1.2 Carbonized wood electrodes. 
Wood can be transformed from insulator to electric conductor by a high-temperature pyrolysis process, in which the 3D hierarchical architecture with low-tortuosity channels is well preserved.34 Compared with other carbon-based materials, such as graphene and CNTs, CW is a sort of green, sustainable, and cheap carbon material, which is ideally suited for freestanding ultra-thick electrodes for high-performance SCs, due to the 3D interconnected conductive network, hierarchical porous structure with direct channels, and the high specific surface area with more electroactivity. Cuña et al.181 studied the influence of CW anisotropy (Fig. 5a) on electrochemical performance for SC electrodes. They found that the microstructure of the activated carbon monoliths in the transversal direction (Fig. 5b) shows larger surface areas and smaller micropores than that in the longitudinal direction, thus delivering higher conductivity and specific capacitance for transversal carbon monoliths (Fig. 5c). These results illustrate that a short, low-tortuosity transfer path is more conducive to charge storage.182

So far, it is still difficult for carbon materials (also including CW) to adequately meet the needs of high energy density and capacitance, limited by the single energy storage mechanism of EDLC.130 To further improve the electrochemical properties of CW electrodes, various efficient modification methods have been developed, such as surface functionalization,154,185,186 heteroatomic doping,155,187,188 and the deposition of pseudo-capacitive materials.111,157,189,190 Zhang and coworkers183 prepared activated wood carbon monoliths (AWC) as freestanding ultra-thick electrodes through two-step thermal treatment (Fig. 5d). By an air atmosphere-activated process, abundant oxygen-containing groups were induced within the AWC (Fig. 5e), enabling good gel-electrolyte permeation and contributing more energy storage sites. As a result, AWC showed larger current response than pristine wood carbon and presented a pair of reversible redox peaks (Fig. 5f), indicating that the introduction of oxygen-containing functional groups (–CO and C–O–C) can provide additional pseudocapacitance contribution and expose more electroactive sites. Tang et al.184 prepared a novel N, S co-doped carbon skeleton (TARC-N) (Fig. 5g). The porous architecture and surface functionalities are simultaneously optimized by heteroatom doping and subsequent NH3 activation processes, which generate abundant active sites and enlarge the specific surface area (up to 1438 m2 g−1). When serving as a binder-free SC electrode, the resultant TARC-N delivered an impressive specific capacitance of 704 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, which is nearly four-fold larger than that of the sample (169 F g−1) without doping process, and exhibited a favorable cycling stability for 5000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1.
For the purpose of realizing energy storage devices of low cost, large thickness, high mass loading, low tortuosity and high energy/power density, Hu's group107 designed a green and biodegradable all-wood architecture asymmetric SC (AWS ASC) device, which consists of an AWC anode, wood membrane separator and MnO2/wood carbon (MnO2@WC) cathode (Fig. 5h). In the common electrodeposition process, all the small channels were filled with numerous needle-like MnO2 nanosheets gradually, resulting in a significantly increased thickness of the channel walls with a notable high areal mass loading (75 mg cm−2), which is beneficial for efficient ion penetration throughout the entire surface of WC (Fig. 5i and j). MnO2@WC electrode delivers a remarkably high areal capacitance of 4.15 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. The assembled ASC (Fig. 5k) exhibited a high energy density of 1.6 mW h cm−2 and a long lifetime of 93% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles (Fig. 5l).
Inspired by previous work, we put forward a mild and simple approach of ultrasound-assisted assembly integrated with carbonization to construct 3D nanoflower-like MoSe2 encapsulated with hierarchically anisotropic carbon architecture (3D MoSe2 NFs@CDW) (Fig. 6a).191 Due to the removal of lignin and hemicellulose, the MoSe2 NFs permeate and fix throughout the channels rapidly and easily. The structural virtue and synergistic effect from EDLC and faradaic pseudocapacitance endow the 3D MoSe2 NFs@CDW electrode with significantly improved areal specific capacitance of 1043 mF cm−2. To demonstrate the utility of this novel electrode material, we also assembled an aqueous ASC device using 3D MoSe2 NFs@CDW as the anode and common MnO2@CDW as the cathode synthesized via a facile hydrothermal process (step two in Fig. 6a). As a result, the ASCs exhibited a high capacitance of 415 mF cm−2, comparable cycling stability and a high energy density of 147 μW h cm−2 at a power density of 2 mW cm−2, further evidencing the enormous potential of hierarchically anisotropic CW to SCs.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are another kind of emerging porous materials mainly in the form of powder and crystal frameworks, which have a broad application prospect in the field of energy storage materials.192 Further processing, transfer, handling, and practical application of MOFs are often limited by their defects of instability, poor electrical conductivity, and difficulty in collection.193 Interestingly, loading MOFs on the tubular inner surface of wood is a preferable strategy to develop new high-performance functional composites for energy storage.194–196 MOFs/wood hybrid thick electrodes are usually fabricated by a green approach of in situ growth of MOF precursor within the native wood or modified wood followed by subsequent carbonization. Zhang et al.156 devised a series of MOFs@Wood freestanding thick electrodes for SCs, the family of MOFs including ZIF-8, ZIF-67, MOF-74, and MOF-199 (Fig. 6b). They found that the C-ZIF-8@ACW electrode can exhibit ultra-high areal specific capacitances of 12.52 and 8.95 F cm−2 at current densities of 1 and 20 mA cm−2, respectively, attributed to a combination of the 3D porous network structure of natural wood and the microporous/mesoporous property of MOF nanocrystals. Besides, the remarkable cycle stability (10000 cycles, 96.8%) of the assembled SC also showed a great potential of the MOFs@wood thick electrodes in applications. Inspired by this work, our group prepared a thick electrode of carbonized Wood@ZIFs to demonstrate the advantages of such novel carbon materials (Fig. 6c).109 This work explored the contribution of large specific area, direct ion transport channels and high content of N-doping to the enhanced electrochemical property of electrodes by density functional theory calculations.
Up to now, the research of SCs assembled using wood-based monolithic electrodes is still at the primary stage and so still less concerning addressing poor mechanical properties (such as the frangibility that results in the collapse and fracture of the frame structure), even though the appreciable volume and anisotropy of solid wood endow it with good processability, compared with those thinner flexible electrodes in the form of paper or membrane. Thus, it is a significant challenge that cooperating with the advanced nanotechnologies makes wood-based electrode substrates a splendid skeleton with desirable mechanical strength, which is beneficial to a broader range of applications.

5.2 Cellulose microfiber-based electrodes
The development of flexible SCs has evolved as an emerging field to meet the ever-increasing demand for portable and wearable electronic devices, which require the electronic materials to be equipped with favorable bendability and foldability. Papermaking technology makes integral wood convert to flexible membrane (i.e. cellulose paper), in which the CMF network can interact with conductive and electroactive materials to fabricate electroactive paper for charge storage applications. In this section we will discuss the two main strategies for developing cellulose paper-based electrodes: surface coating/deposition and heterogeneous recombination. Table 4 summarizes a comparison of the various CMF electrodes reported recently.

The abundant surface oxygen-containing groups of CMFs provide sufficient active sites to ensure the robust adhesion of functional guest substances. Hence, cellulose paper can act as a substrate for constructing conductive networks through surface coating/deposition, including printing,202–204 vacuum filtration,60,205,206 dipping,113,199 solvothermal,207,208 electrochemical deposition,200 and chemical/physical vapor deposition.115,209,210 Weng et al.60 utilized a simple vacuum filtration method to realize the complete coverage and filling of graphene within cellulose fiber network for the first time. The abundant functional groups on cellulose fibers provide strong interactive sites to bind graphene nanosheets (GNSs), resulting in flexible graphene-cellulose paper electrodes with a good rate capability and long cyclic stability with a high capacitance of 81 mF cm−2. Hu and coworkers used facile solution-based coating (Fig. 7a) and solvent-free drawing (Fig. 7b) methods to integrate single-walled CNTs, silver nanowires and graphene on the surface of cellulose paper, making a more rapid and effective fabrication process for conductive paper.197,211 The SC based on these low-cost CNT-paper electrodes exhibits a specific capacitance of 200 F g−1 and energy density of 30–47 W h kg−1 when only the CNT mass is considered.

Thanks to the favorable mechanical flexibility and toughness coupled with the abundant oxygen-containing functional groups, such 3D fiber networks from commercial paper are qualified for the assembly of multifarious synergistic active materials to fabricate cellulose paper-based electrodes with intriguing heterostructure. Zhang et al.200 developed a Ni/MnO2-filter paper (FP) positive electrode for flexible SCs (Fig. 7c). It is reported that the nickel ions are easily adsorbed and diffused throughout the extremely rough and porous surface of FP by electroless plating strategy, forming highly conductive nickel layers with good adhesion for further deposition of MnO2 layers by electrodeposition. The strategy of assembling active materials layer-by-layer (LBL) based on cellulose paper can not only increase the specific surface area of the material, but also endows composites with outstanding cycling performance even at a high current density. Gui et al.212 reported an interesting paper/CNTs/MnO2/CNTs (P-CMC) composite with dual ion and electron paths via LBL assembly (Fig. 7d). In this 3D multilayered structure, ions can diffuse from the bulk solution between each fiber to MnO2 not only through pathway 1, but also through pathway 2 from the inside of each water-absorbing cellulose fiber to MnO2. As the second electron transfer path for MnO2 and the protective case for integral material, the outermost layer of CNTs improves capacitive performance of MnO2 and alleviates the loss of MnO2 during cycling (Fig. 7e). Besides, all of the results indicate that P-CMC outperforms the polyester-textile-based counterparts, well highlighting the unique advantage of cellulose fiber.
In our group, we have expended a lot of effort on cellulose-based hybrid paper for SC electrodes with high performance and made some gratifying advances in recent years.206,209 Most notable, we focus on the design and the fabrication of bionic structures for SC electrodes, by which improving the transmission efficiency for ions and enhancing the electrochemical responsivity of electrode materials during the electrochemical reaction. Inspired by the synergistic functions and integrated form of the geologic architecture system, we reinvented the ground-mountain-vegetation system via the integration of magnetron sputtering and electrooxidation methods to develop a novel hierarchical cellulose-supported Co@Co(OH)2 heterostructure for flexible SC electrodes (Fig. 7f and g).201 Similar to the role of ground, the cellulose framework is capable of water holding, hydrophilic, and flexible; the sputtered mountain-like Co brings rigidity and mechanical strength for system and superhighway for charge delivery; the quasi-honeycomb nanoarchitecture of Co(OH)2 has a perfect interfacial bonding with the internal Co which acts as vegetation, possessing a large surface area and increasing the electrochemically active sites for redox reactions (Fig. 7h). Due to the synergistic effects from the faradaic materials and cellulose networks, the composite electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 642 mF cm−2 and good rate capability.
An approach to achieve more uniform and intensive interfacial bonding of cellulose paper-based electrodes is recombination, involving mixing cellulose microfibers with active nanoparticles in aqueous solution followed by a filtration process. Via intermolecular electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds, and dative bonds, active materials are facilely grafted throughout each cellulose microfiber.214,215 For example, graphene nanosheets (GNSs) and cellulose pulp can self-assemble by simple solution mixing to integrate into a flexible composite paper with continuously conductive networks (Fig. 7i).213 The GNSs were deposited through a bridge of cellulose microfibers homogeneously and formed a uniform nano-coated structure after infiltration, which provides the paper with high electric conductivity (Fig. 7j). Due to the mechanical locking of the cellulose microfibers by GNS, the flexible and tough GNS/cellulose can be bent and fully restored freely, and exhibits greater modulus than pure cellulose paper (Fig. 7k). Such an approach is also appropriate for fabricating RGO/cellulose116,117 and CNT/cellulose216 composite paper.
5.3 Nanocellulose-based electrodes
Compared with cellulose microfiber at the centi-/micrometer scale, nanocellulose has the advantages of finer nanostructures, good mechanical strength, lower coefficient of thermal expansion, and tunable surface functionalities, which allows it to self-assemble into different types of materials with remarkable properties, such as microfibers, compact films/papers, and porous aerogels. Therefore, nanocellulose is more suitable to fabricate flexible SCs for portable electronics. Extensive progress has been achieved with SC devices using nanocellulose as the critical ingredient. In this section, we will discuss the recent progress of nanocellulose-based electrode materials, including 1D fibers, 2D films/papers and 3D hydrogels/aerogels, and relevant examples are summarized in Table 5 for a pointed comparison.

5.3.1 Fiber-shaped electrodes. 
In view of the merits of nanocellulose mentioned above, it is possible to obtain a strong and oriented structure supported by secondary interactions between the nanofibrils.186 One effective way is to fabricate 1D CNF filaments by extruding a nanocellulose dispersion into a fixation bath, resulting in continuous fibers with a high degree of alignment (Fig. 8a). The spinning solution consists of nanocellulose mixed with a moderate dose of additives, such as organic plasticizers, conductive polymers, and inorganic metallic or nonmetallic active materials, allowing to directly exclude the conductive fibers for SC utilization. Such novel fiber materials play an important role in the field of wearable electronics due to the merits of small volume, light weight, good flexibility, and high tensile strength.232,233 Niu et al.217 prepared a CNF/CNT hybrid non-woven microfiber mat (Fig. 8b) by controlling the extrusion patterns of CNF/single-walled CNT (SWCNT) suspensions in an ethanol coagulation bath and subsequent drying in the air under restricted conditions. Each excluded individual fiber has a rough surface with a uniform diameter of ≈50 μm (Fig. 8c), which results from abundant pores at the nanoscale. SWCNTs can be oriented along the axial direction of the microfiber preferentially without conspicuous aggregation in the extrusion process (Fig. 8d), providing numerous paths for fast electron transport along the axial direction. The CNF/SWCNT hybrid non-woven microfiber mat exhibited an area specific capacitance of 5.99 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.024 mA cm−2 and outstanding electrochemical stability for flexible SCs (Fig. 8e). Particularly, these kinds of wearable SC integrated textiles also displayed outstanding tailorability and damage reliability to meet different requirements (Fig. 8f).

What is more, CNF-reinforced graphene/PPy microfibers (CNFs-RGO/PPy) were fabricated via a similar wet-spinning method (Fig. 8g).235 As an excellent skeleton material, CNFs can not only restrain the serious restacking of graphene nanosheets but also provide substantial hydrogen bonds to strengthen the interlaminar force, which confers a regular circular profile with a multilayered structure to spun fibers in a dry state (Fig. 8h). Consequently, the optimum CNFs-RGO/PPy fibers achieved a high tensile strength of 364.3 MPa, and exhibited an excellent rate performance with ≈98.8% capacitance retention at a 10 times increasing current density.
For all this, graphene nanosheets in dispersion for spinning are apt to form large aggregates of liquid-crystal (LC) phase, which will automatically generate a high-viscosity gel with low flowing property making it difficult to obtain continuously high-performance microfibers.236 Chen et al.128 proposed a strategy of non-liquid-crystal (NLC) spinning and chemical reduction to address this issue (Fig. 8i). As shown in Fig. 8j, the addition of NaOH yields much higher negative charges on GO sheets in alkaline NLC suspension, giving rise to a stronger electrostatic repulsion and weaker hydrogen-bond interaction between GO nanosheets and CNC. This homogeneous NLC GO/CNC dispersion with lower viscosity ensures the smooth extrusion of continuous fibers. Besides, the resultant hybrid GO/CNC fibers acting as an electrode exhibited a high capacitance of 208.2 F cm−3 and a strength of 199.8 MPa.
Despite the electrodes reviewed above exhibiting good electrochemical and mechanical performances, they usually adopt the assembly form of twisted or parallel contacts for SC devices, which will give rise to limited interface adhesion and bulk mass electrolyte layers, automatically reducing the stability and flexibility of devices. Even worse, the exposed conductive layer in such structure has the risk of short-circuiting easily.219 Indeed, composite fibers with core–sheath structure fabricated by coaxial spinning are considered to circumvent these problems.237 Cai et al.218 designed wet spun ternary synergistic coaxial fibers consisting of carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) sheath encapsulating graphene/CNTs/PEDOT:PSS core (Fig. 8k). As shown in Fig. 8l, the ternary core is tightly wrapped by CMC which is ionically conductive while electrically insulative, ensuring an electrode free of short circuit while permitting the ions to pass. Benefiting from good interfacial bonding, such ternary composite structure enables the EDLC of RGO and CNTs well combined with the pseudocapacitance derived from PEDOT:PSS, resulting in fast electrochemical reaction kinetics (Fig. 8m).
In addition to the integration of typical carbon materials/conductive polymers with nanocellulose to prepare spun fiber-based SCs, nanocellulose spun fibers can also be directly carbonized into highly conductive carbon fibers (CFs). Generally, the carbonization of pure nanocellulose will result in CFs with contracted structure and poor mechanical strength because of dehydration reactions and the cleavage of glycosidic linkages. Wang and coworkers proved that bicomponent lignin/CNFs-derived CFs can integrate the advantage of fibrillar structure of cellulose and lignin's high carbon density to overcome the above mentioned defect.205,220 As-fabricated hybrid CFs were obtained at a high mass yield of 41% with well-retained circular cross sections, and exhibited a significant electrical conductivity of 103 S cm−1, being suitable for fiber-shaped capacitors, microelectrodes, and wearable electronics.


5.3.2 Flexible film/paper electrodes. 
Nanocellulose-based film/paper is another type of cellulosic material used for flexible substrates to integrate active materials, which allows the fabrication of flexible freestanding SC electrodes. In the dehydrated state, nanocellulose with large length-diameter ratio is prone to self-assemble through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals force interaction or electrostatic force to form flexible film/paper equipped with numerous micro-/mesopores, which can accelerate ion diffusion and electron migration.238 Besides, the surface hydroxyls and carboxyls endow nanocellulose with excellent water-holding capacity in electrolyte solution. All these merits make nanocellulose a superior separator239,240 and reinforcing material for solid-state electrolytes72,241 for energy storage devices.
Generally, 2D film electrodes can be produced by coating or depositing a single electroactive layer or multiple electroactive layers upon the surface of a flexible nanocellulose film, similar to the fabrication of cellulose paper electrodes mentioned in section 5.2.242,243 One of the versatile approaches involves soaking nanocellulose films into ECP monomer solution and initiating in situ polymerization. A representative flexible PPy/CNF film electrode exhibited a tensile strass of 71.4 MPa and delivered a high areal specific capacitance of 2.26 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2.244 Furthermore, Ravit et al.245,246 utilized a rapid one-step electrochemical polymerization technique to assemble PEDOT and MnO2 nanoparticles on CNC films as SC electrodes (Fig. 9a). The interconnected network-like structure of CNC films renders numerous pores at the nanoscale, resulting in lower interfacial resistance for charge propagation than that of straight PEDOT electrodes.

Nanocellulose film can also be transformed into conductive carbon materials through a simple pyrolysis process, which can then serve as an excellent anode in SCs. In particular, Li and coworkers118 designed a two-level hierarchical porous structure for flexible nanocellulose carbon film by integrating the structural advantages of well compatible CNF and CNC (Fig. 9b–g). In this carbonized nanofilm, the long CNFs formed a macro-porous framework and the short CNCs were assembled around the CNF framework and generated micro-/mesopores. Besides, a thin atomic layer of Al2O3 was deposited on the film, resulting in an integrated and highly conductive network of graphitized nanocellulose fibers with a large specific surface area of 1244 m2 g−1 without aggregation. As electrodes in an SC, these films exhibited far better performance than the reference AC in the high-current range.
Recently, pigment-CNF papers with nanoporous pigment-fiber network structure for flexible SCs were manufactured at pilot scale (Fig. 9h and i) via electronic ink printing.247 As is shown in Fig. 9j, the active layers of graphene and CNTs worked simultaneously as high-surface-area active electrodes and current collectors, printed simply on both sides of the pigment-CNF which serves as a double functional separator-substrate in printed SCs. Later, a kind of novel inkjet-printed SCs, featured by their monolithic integration with paper substrates and high-resolution print images, were manufactured directly on CNF paper using a typical desktop inkjet printer by Choi and coworkers.202 As seen in Fig. 9k, a primer layer of CNF-mediated nanoporous mats, layer of comb-shaped electrodes (Ag nanowires introduced SWNT/AC), and layer of ([BMIM][BF4]/ETPTA) solid-state electrolyte were deposited stepwise via a conventional inkjet printing process, after which the UV-crosslinking process was carried out. The inkjet-printed technology permits the appealing advantage of aesthetic versatility for SCs. In addition, series and parallel circuits were easily connected on the inkjet-printed SCs without the aid of metallic interconnects (Fig. 9l and m), reflecting that the cell voltage and capacitance can be custom-controlled. Given the simplicity and scalability of the inkjet-printed process and the design universality of the device, it is predictable that the application of inkjet-printed nanocellulose-based devices will be scaled to broader domains.
In addition to the representative approach mentioned above to fabricate nanocellulose film electrodes, ECPs and 2D graphene can be also blended into the suspension of nanocellulose to assemble composite film with good flexibility, high mechanical strength and electrical conductivity.248 Various nanocellulose/ECPs composites nanofilms or paper, such as CNF/PANI,249 CNF/PPy,122,250 and CNF/PEDOT,224 have been developed via simple methods that are also applied to fabricate microfiber cellulose paper. What is more, introducing specific ratio of GO that served as reinforcing and structural directing additive can endow the composite film with superior flexibility and a higher surface area.251 Hou et al.221 reported a markedly flexible CNF-based film containing PPy and RGO nanosheets fabricated through an altering filtration method (Fig. 10a). Due to the hydrophilic CNF providing more ion diffusion paths within the RGO lays, and the sandwiched structure (Fig. 10b and c) reducing the charge transfer resistance, such sandwich-like PPy/RGO/CNF film (S-PRC) showed a higher specific capacitance than that of sandwich-like structured PPy NF/RGO film (S-PR) and randomly mixed PPyc/RGO/CNF (M-PRC) (Fig. 10d). What is more, an all-organic paper electrode consisting of wood derivatives and ECP (Fig. 10e–g) also exhibited an enhanced capacitance from 110 to 230 F g−1 due to the introduction of lignosulfonate into the nanocellulose-PEDOT:PSS system.

In recent years, a family of 2D metal carbides and nitrides, known as MXenes, have emerged to combine with 1D nanocellulose to construct various novel functional film materials for different applications due to the outstanding metallic conductivity, good hydrophilicity, high redox activity and atomic-layer thickness.222,252,253 Tian et al.223 prepared a mechanically robust composite thin film by filtrating stable colloidal dispersions of MXene (Ti3C2Tx) and CNFs (Fig. 10h and i). They proposed that the stable blend of the two colloids can be attributed to the electrostatic forces between CNFs and Ti3C2Tx flakes and the adhesion between them benefits from functional groups present on the outer transition metal layer surface of Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 10j and k). Such special interaction gives the composite film a remarkably high mechanical strength of 341 MPa with still a high capacitance of 298 F g−1. They also demonstrated that such MXene/CNF hybrid dispersions can be used as inks to print flexible micro-SCs with precise dimensions (Fig. 10l and m).


5.3.3 Flexible hydrogel electrodes. 
A cellulose-based hydrogel is a robust 3D cross-linked network of hydrophilic polymer chains swollen with solvent water, which possesses excellent shape memory function and maintains structural integrity under various mechanical deformations.254,255 It is intriguing to add conductive and well-compatible nanomaterials into a cellulose hydrogel skeleton to fabricate porous, mechanically robust and conductive gel electrode, which can be applied in novel smart flexible electronics. Cross-linked PANI/CNF hydrogels were fabricated by using Fe3+ as polymerization and crosslinking initiator (Fig. 11a).225 As an SC electrode, PANI/CNF hydrogel delivered a high capacitance of 3060 mF cm−2. Besides, Zhang et al.226 designed and constructed a conductive and continuous hollow PPy/cellulose hydrogel with a biphase porous structure by using a simple electrochemical deposition technique (Fig. 11b). In such a hollow hybrid hydrogel, cellulose acts as the protective shell of the PPy network structure, providing the hollow conductive hydrogel with good mechanical strength and flexibility (Fig. 11c and d). Meanwhile, its 3D porous network structure and superhydrophilicity promote the rapid penetration, diffusion, and transmission of electrolyte ions in the hydrogel matrix. As a result, the gel SC can still exhibit good electrochemical behavior under extreme bending deformation and provide stable energy output.

In order to open up the application fields of hydrogel-based SCs, it is expected that hydrogel-based electrode materials can endow SCs with mechanical flexibility, inherent self-healing ability, biocompatibility, and ideal electrochemical performance.63,256 Han's group227 developed a novel PANI/CNF hydrogel exhibiting favorable self-healing ability by in situ polymerization of PANI and subsequent borax-mediated cross-linking with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (Fig. 11e). The synergy of the dynamic multi-complexation and chain entanglements within PANI@CNF, borax, and PVA leads to the development of a hierarchical network structure with a high conductivity and good moldability (Fig. 11f). The PANI@CNF-PVA hydrogel electrode presented a high specific capacitance of 226.1 F g−1 and a good cycling property with a capacitance retention of 74% after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, such novel hydrogel integrates many appealing features including biocompatibility, pH sensitivity, thermo-reversibility, and, most importantly, fast self-healing ability within 15 s (Fig. 11g), which point to promising applications of the as-prepared versatile ECHs in flexible, self-healing, and implantable electronic devices.


5.3.4 Porous aerogel electrodes. 
An aerogel is an ultralight 3D material derived from a gel where the liquid component has been substituted with air while the cross-linking framework is preserved.257 The well-developed porous structures, large specific surface areas, extremely low densities, and thermal conductivities make it a perfect candidate for applications in insulation, sensors, environmental remediation, and energy conservation.258–260 The physical and chemical peculiarities of nanocellulose allow to be used in the fabrication of a variety of 3D porous materials with large specific surface area, including aerogels.27 The typical fabrication of nanocellulose aerogels for SCs can be roughly described as the sublimation of solid solvent through freeze-drying/critical point drying/supercritical drying from a composite hydrogel. Chen et al.228 constructed an N-self-doped carbon nanofiber (NCNF) aerogel with a silk cocoon-like node morphology by incorporating ZIF-8 nanocrystals on bacterial cellulose.228 Such interesting nanoarchitecture is the result of the perfect synergy between the highly conductive carbon nanofibers and abundant micro-/mesoporous ZIF-8 nanoparticles that function as energy storage nodes (Fig. 12a), which enables the NCNF to exhibit remarkable capacitances of 224 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 612 mF cm−2 at 1.37 mA cm−2. In our recent work, we demonstrated that CNF-derived carbon aerogel (CDCA) can serve as a highly conductive and porous matrix to heighten the mechanical stability and charge-storage kinetics of self-stacked FeOCl layers (Fig. 12b).229 The resultant FeOCl@CDCA electrodes delivered an ultra-high areal specific capacitance of 1618 mF cm−2 (647 F g−1) at 2 mA cm−2 and outstanding cycle stability with no more than 10% capacitance loss after 10000 cycles.

It is believed that chemical cross-linking of CNF contributes to the shape recovery of CNF aerogels and prevents the disintegration of CNF aerogels in aqueous media.127,262,263 Hamedi et al.261 used 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) as a cross-linker to fabricate a CNF aerogel with properties of high surface area and surface charge, as well as excellent compressibility (Fig. 12c and d). Besides, cross-linked nanocellulose aerogels can be integrated with functional polymers and nanoparticles by a rapid LBL assembly (Fig. 12e). The as-prepared SWCNT-functionalized aerogels were used as electrodes in an aqueous SC, and the electrode exhibited a capacitance of ca. 419 F g−1 based on the weight of the active layer. In addition, a fully integrated 3D aerogel SC device was fabricated by the same group for the first time via a similar LBL self-assembly method.230 As is shown in Fig. 12f, the interdigitated layers of interchangeable electrode materials (cationic polyethyleneimine (PEI) and anionic single-wall CNTs functionalized with –COOH) and the separator were assembled on the walls of nanocellulose aerogel substrate in aqueous media successively. In this procedure, each layer was deposited in less than 1 second that was attributed to the convective nature of the flow. Notwithstanding a comparatively mediocre capacitance of 25 F g−1 achieved from this 3D SC, it is a fact that the fully integrated structure of this self-assembled 3D device is a substantial inspiration for designing and fabricating 3D devices. Furthermore, Yang et al.64 used aldehyde and hydrazide as modifiers of CNC to fabricate an ultralight versatile aerogel substrate, in which three types of capacitive materials, namely PPy nanofibers, PPy-coated CNTs (PPy-CNTs), and MnO2 nanoparticles, can be assembled and anchored on CNC networks (Fig. 12g). It is notable that the loading of electroactive materials in the aerogels was up to a mass ratio of 1.5 (loading of electroactive NPs:CNC substrate), exceeding those of many conventional devices fabricated by using metallic substrates. Typical symmetric coin SCs containing hybrid CNC aerogels with PPy nanofibers exhibit a capacitance of 3.32 mF cm−2, excellent rate capability, low resistance, and good cycle performance.
For aerogel architectures to exert their superiorities, it is crucial to effectively regulate and assemble the micro-/nanoscale structure.267 Directional freeze drying, including unidirectional freeze drying (Fig. 13a) and bidirectional freeze drying (Fig. 13b), is another emerging technology for the fabrication of porous nanocellulose aerogels, while the network structure of the cellulose building block can be controlled into the desired anisotropic channels.268 Such robust cellular micro-/nanoscale structure derived from a “down-to-top” strategy enables the aerogel to demonstrate many intriguing properties that resemble but are superior to those of natural wood, including high compression deformation without the collapse of structure, as well as favorable thermal insulation and fire retardancy, which are also highly attractive to SCs.231,269 Therefore, Chen et al.266 reported that CNF combined with lignin from wood permits assembly of an elastic, lightweight, and conductive carbon aerogel (C-AL/CNF) with tracheid-like texture via directional freezing-casting, vacuum freeze-drying, and carbonization (Fig. 13c–e). In this study, alkali lignin (AL) is supposed to prevent interconnected CNF from severe degradation after carbonization; thus, the tracheid-like microstructure of the aerogel (A-AL/CNF) was preserved intact (Fig. 13f and g). In view of the excellent mechanical flexibility and conductivity, a freestanding C-AL/CNF-5 electrode can deliver a specific capacitance of 260 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Besides, the all-solid-state symmetric SC device assembled with the AL/CNF-5 electrode (Fig. 13h) exhibited satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility.

6 Summary and perspectives
For the past few years, wood-based biomaterials have become one of the most attractive solutions to the challenge of developing advanced energy storage devices, due to their unique architecture and physicochemical properties, as well as their being abundant, eco-friendly, and sustainable resources. We reviewed the recent advances in the design and fabrication of wood-derived SC electrodes, with a focus on the structure–function–property relationship between the micro- and nanoscale structure of wood and electroactive material. As the building blocks for SC devices, solid wood and lignocellulose extracted by a “top–down” strategy have many virtues of large specific surface area, tunable porous structure, and surface activity, coupled with excellent thermostability and biocompatibility, which enables remarkably transformative system performance in the manner of constructing high-performance wood-based electrodes. The crucial roles of wood and lignocellulose in bulk SC electrodes mainly include four aspects of functional contribution: (1) lightweight porous skeleton, (2) flexible substrate, (3) biocompatible adhesive, and (4) electroactive carbon component. The synergistic effects stemming from the morphology, mechanics, and electrochemistry of wood allow the design and assembly of various high-performance freestanding SC electrode materials, including but not limited to 1D integrated fiber-shaped electrodes, 2D flexible film/paper, 3D porous hydrogels/aerogels, and ultra-thick electrodes.
However, despite these well-reported achievements that “top–down” fabricated wood-based biomaterials have immense inherent potential as constituent building blocks for “down-to-top” construction, there are still very real challenges to achieving desirable performance of wood-based SC electrodes. Future research should pay more attention to the following issues:
(1) Depth resolution of natural wood
The construction and chemical components of wood cell walls exhibit conspicuous complexity and diversity, which is a stumbling block for preparing high-purity wood-derived materials with low consumption although many dissociation technologies are available. Wood cell wall is a typical hierarchical structure. The secondary wall is composed of S1, S2, and S3 layers, among which the arrangement of fibers and the angles of microfibrils are significantly different, resulting in different mechanical properties. The shearing strength of fibers in cell walls is a crucial factor to a low-cost, green fabrication of wood microfibers and nanofibers. Therefore, it is imperative to further study the general mechanisms of compositional accumulation and resistance to degradation in wood cell walls.
(2) Structural modification and regulation of wood cell wall
Electrodes derived from natural wood consisting of abundant aligned channels with large range of diameters cannot provide sufficiently effective pathways for electrolyte ions, because too narrow pores hinder electrolyte ion accessibility while too large pores will limit the active surface area of the space within the electrode material, which is not conducive to achieving high specific capacitance and high volumetric energy density. The in situ surface engineering inducing micro-/nano-structurization of wood cell walls or fibers is an efficient strategy to overcome this obstacle, like cellulose dissolution–regeneration, nanofibrillation, and selective lignin degradation (see the detailed discussion in Fig. 4). These approaches break through the limitation of improving the energy storage performance of wood-based electrodes by anchoring micro-/nanoscale fiber network on the surface of wood cell walls to increase the volume of micropores and mesopores, while providing more available nanochannels for ion transport within wood-based electrodes.
(3) Reinforcement of interfacial combination
A high-performance electrode exhibiting optimal electrochemical properties relies on a perfect interface between the building blocks to a great extent. However, pristine wood is short of valid binding sites and cellulose products often present inhomogeneous agglomeration when used to fabricate composite electrodes, resulting in a poor interface binding. To obtain a continuous and strong coupling with high-mass-loading electroactive components without a decrease of interface resistance, there is a great need to develop and introduce novel modification methods of surface functional groups, such as radio-frequency-plasma activation, which has been demonstrated to be a green, efficient, and mild method for surface modification of electrochemical energy storage materials.270,271 Besides, methods like atomic layer deposition and magnetron that can achieve high-strength bonding between active substances and wood-derived substrate materials at molecular and atomic levels and accurately regulate the loading of active substances are highly recommended.
(4) Improvement of mechanical properties
Although wood and cellulose are able to be assembled into various functional materials, the mechanical properties, including flexibility, stiffness, and toughness, of wood-based electrodes should be further improved to cater for different situations. Other compelling biomass materials like chitosan, gelatin, algin, and mussel protein can be considered to add to the system to modify the mechanical properties.
(5) Development of multi-functional wood-based electrode materials
The development of multi-functional advanced SC devices has become an irresistible trend. Indeed, significant advancements have been made to develop electrochromic, self-healing, and implantable SCs. It is predictable that wood-derived materials like filament yarn, thin film, and hydrogel with biocompatibility and degradability are suitable for further development of energy storage electrodes for clinical diagnosis and treatment. What warrants special attention is that the interfacial bonding between wood/cellulose and other functional structures, not merely with capacitive active materials, should be further studied.
