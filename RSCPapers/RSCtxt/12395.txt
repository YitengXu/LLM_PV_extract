, Accepted 8th January 2016First published on 13th January 2016AbstractEfficient Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ spectral conversion materials have been prepared by a sol–gel method. The Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ materials can efficiently shift the short-wavelength sunlight in 250–550 nm spectral regions into near infrared emission which matches the higher sensitivity region of Si-based solar cells. The maximal energy transfer efficiency is 76.0% and 80.4% in Mn4+, Nd3+ and Mn4+, Yb3+ co-doped samples when excited at 460 nm, respectively. A dipole–dipole interaction is responsible for the energy transfer sensitization processes from Mn4+ to Nd3+/Yb3+ ions, which has been confirmed by Dexter's theory and the Yokota–Tanimoto model.
1. Introduction
Solar energy is free, clean and abundant in the world and thus is regarded as an ideal replaceable energy for mankind in the future. The capacity of photovoltaic devices to transform sunlight directly into electricity promises a prime technology for solar energy utilization. Currently, the photovoltaic solar cell market is predominated by single-junction crystalline and polycrystalline Si solar cells with a conversion efficiency of about 15%.1,2 Nevertheless, the theoretical maximum conversion efficiency of Si-based solar cells is higher than 30%.3,4 In principle, photons with energy higher than the bandgap of photovoltaic devices are absorbed, but the Si-based solar cell works most efficiently under irradiation of the light in the vicinity of 1000 nm.
To enhance the efficiency of the Si-based solar cell, down-shifting is a promising technique by which short-wavelength sunlight can be converted to light in near-infrared (NIR) region where the photovoltaic solar cell is more sensitive. Lanthanide ions were usually used to obtain NIR light by down shifting because of their rich energy-level structure permitting abundant NIR emission. Among the lanthanide ions, Nd3+ and Yb3+ are particularly noteworthy because their NIR emissions take place at around 900(1060) nm and 980 nm, respectively, which are just above the band edge of Si semiconductor where the solar cell exhibits excellent spectral response. However, the Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions exhibit weak and narrow absorption due to their parity-forbidden 4f–4f transitions, and as a result, only a small part of ultraviolet and visible sunlight can be converted into NIR emission. In order to realize broadband spectral conversion, the f–d transition lanthanide ions (e.g., Ce3+, Eu2+, Yb2+),5,6 transition metal ions (e.g., Cr3+, Mn2+)7–9 and semiconductor quantum dots (e.g., CdSe)10–12 have been widely attempted as sensitizers in Nd3+/Yb3+ doped materials. Nevertheless, enhancing the sensitized Nd3+/Yb3+ NIR emission with excitation at UV-visible light is still a difficult problem to be solved.
In recent years, tetravalence manganese ion (Mn4+) doped luminescent materials have been investigated and attracted much attention.13–22 Mn4+ ions enter into the octahedral sites as substitutes and exhibit deep red luminescence.18,19,23 More importantly, the Mn4+–O2− charge transfer transition and 4A2 → 4T1, 4A2 → 4T2 spin-allowed d–d transitions of Mn4+ exhibit a strong and continuous UV and visible absorption, which indicates the possible application for broadband light conversion. Among these phosphors, the Mn4+ doped Ca14Zn6Al10O35 material is especially attractive because of its high luminescence quantum efficiency, good thermal and chemical stability, and ease of preparation.13,22 Furthermore, the Ca2+ sites can be replaced by Nd3+/Yb3+ ions because of their similar ion radius. This implies that efficient energy transfer from Mn4+ to Nd3+/Yb3+ can possibly take place in the Ca14Zn6Al10O35 matrix. Hence the Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped Ca14Zn6Al10O35 materials promise to be broadband spectral converters to obtain efficient NIR emission (around 1000 nm).
In this paper, two spectral conversion materials, i.e., Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+ and Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Yb3+ have been prepared. The luminescence properties and energy transfer mechanism between Mn4+ and Nd3+/Yb3+ ions were investigated in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials synthesis
The spectral conversion materials were prepared through a sol–gel procedure. Al(NO3)3(H2O)9 (99.9%), Nd(NO3)3(H2O)6 (99.9%), Yb(NO3)3(H2O)6 (99.9%), Mn(NO3)2(H2O)4 (99.9%), Ca(NO3)2(H2O)4 (99.9%), Zn(NO3)2(H2O)6 (99.9%), C6H8O7 (99.9%) were used as raw materials. Firstly, the reagents were dissolved in distilled water with the stoichiometric ratio of Ca14−x/yZn6Al10−zO35:Mnz, Ndx/Yby (x = 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.225, 0.25, 0.275, 0.30, 0.40; y = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.2; z = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0) and subsequently mixed by stirring. Then the C6H8O7 aqueous solutions were dripped into the nitrate solutions with the cation–ligand ratio cation:C6H8O7 = 1:1.5 accompanied by constant stirring. After standing for 12 h, the solutions were dried at 100 °C for 24 hours to obtain precursors. Then the precursors were carried out to remove the organic matter by heating the temperature to 600 °C for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. After grinding, the powders were heated to 1000 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 under air condition and calcined at that temperature for 2 h to obtain the final products.
2.2. Characterization
The crystalline phases of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Bruker D8 advanced equipment, using Cu tube with Cu/K (k = 0.1541 nm) radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a K-Alpha 1063 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a focused monochromatic Al Ka X-ray beam (12 kV, 6 mA, 5 × 10−9 torr). The photoexcitation spectra (PLE) and visible-near-infrared photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured by a monochromator (Zolix Instrument, Omni-λ320i) coupled with photomultiplier (PMTH-S1-CR131) and near infrared sensitive detector (DInGaAs 2600-TE), in which a monochromator (Zolix Instrument Omni-λ320) coupled with a 150 W xenon lamp was used to provide the monochromatic exciting light. The luminescence decay curves were analyzed by a PTI QM 40 spectrofluorometer, using a pulse xenon lamp as the excitation source. The diffuse refection spectra of the samples were measured by a Varian Cary 100 UV-Vis Spectrofluorometer with a DRA-CA-30I Diffuse Reflectance Accessory. The morphology of the prepared samples was characterized by a JSM-6610 scanning electron microscope (SEM).
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ca14−x/yZn6Al10−zO35: Mnz, Ndx/Yby (x = 0.25, y = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, z = 0.2, 0.6). The diffraction peaks of the samples can be identified by comparison with the standard XRD data of Ca14Zn6Al10O35 (JCPDS 50-0426). Ca14Zn6Al10O35 has a cubic structure with space group F23. In Ca14Zn6Al10O35 crystal structure, four of the five independent positions occupied by Zn and Al are in the tetrahedral coordination, with the average Zn–O distances of 1.951 Å and average Al–O distances of 1.719, 1.794 and 1.891 Å, respectively. The fifth independent position is in the octahedral coordination with the Al–O distance of 1.936 Å. In addition, Ca2+ has three different coordination environments. Two of them are in octahedral with the average Ca–O distances of 2.336 and 2.346 Å, and the third independent Ca2+ is in a seven-coordinated polyhedron with an average Ca–O distance being equal to 2.498 Å.24 The schematic of Ca14Zn6Al10O35 crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows the Mn XPS core level spectrum for Ca14Zn6Al9.4O35: Mn0.6. The smoothed XPS spectrum shows the peak of Mn 2p3/2 with a binding energy at 642.3 eV (see Fig. 3). It is known that the peaks of Mn2+ 2p3/2 (MnO), Mn3+ 2p3/2 (Mn2O3) and Mn4+ 2p3/2 (MnO2) locate at 641.7, 641.8 and 642.4 eV, respectively.25 Therefore, the Mn element predominantly behaves as the state of Mn4+ in the Ca14Zn6Al10O35 host. It is commonly accepted that Mn4+ ions are preferentially accommodated at the Al3+ sites in the lattice with an octahedral coordination.13,22 It can be seen that Ca2+ site is likely to be replaced by Nd3+/Yb3+ ion without significant structural changes when a small amount of Nd3+/Yb3+ are introduced, due to the similar ion radius between Ca2+ and Nd3+/Yb3+ (Ca2+: radius = 0.100 nm; Nd3+: radius = 0.098 nm; Yb3+: radius = 0.086 nm). Considering the different valences of Ca2+ and Nd3+/Yb3+, charge compensation is required. The commonly accepted view is that the formative Ca vacancies can compensate charge imbalance.26–28 When Nd3+/Yb3+ ions are co-doped into Ca14Zn6Al10O35 matrix, the Ca vacancies might form and they could keep the electroneutrality of the compound.

The diffuse reflection spectra of Ca14Zn6Al10O35 doped with Mn4+, Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions are shown in Fig. 4. In the Mn4+ single-doped and Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples, it can be seen two strong absorption peaks at 370 nm and 465 nm originating from the spin-allowed Mn4+: 4A2 → 4T1 and Mn4+: 4A2 → 4T2 transitions, which are similar to the experimental results reported previously.29 The absorption band between 300 and 350 nm is due to the charge transfer transition of Mn4+–O2−. In addition, the weak and narrow absorption peaks of Nd3+ are also observed in Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+. The high absorption efficiency of the above mentioned samples in the wide UV-visible light region are beneficial to the realization of the short-wavelength light down-shifting.

Fig. 5 presents the normalized PLE and/or PL spectra of Mn4+, Nd3+, Yb3+ single-doped, Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples. Excitation into the absorption band at 460 nm gives an intense broad red emission around 710 nm originating from the 2E → 4A2 spin-forbidden transition of Mn4+ ions in Mn4+ single-doped sample. The excitation also gives luminescence bands which are located at 900, 1060 nm in Mn4+, Nd3+ co-doped and 980 nm in Mn4+, Yb3+ co-doped samples, originating from Nd3+: 4F3/2 → 4I9/2, Nd3+: 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 and Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transitions, respectively. The PLE spectra monitored at 710 nm of Mn4+ single-doped sample shows three broad peaks around 320, 380 and 470 nm, which can be attributed to the charge transfer transition of Mn4+–O2− and spin-allowed transitions of Mn4+: 4A2 → 4T1, Mn4+: 4A2 → 4T2 corresponding well with the absorption spectrum. It is noteworthy that the PLE spectra shapes of the Mn4+, Nd3+ co-doped sample monitored at 1060 nm and the Mn4+, Yb3+ co-doped sample monitored at 980 nm are quite similar to the Mn4+ single-doped sample (see Fig. 5(a)–(c)). Only weak and discrete PLE peaks in visible region caused by the f–f transitions of Nd3+ appear in the Nd3+ single-doped sample and no PLE peak in visible region is observed in the Yb3+ single-doped sample (see Fig. 5(a) and (b)). Obviously, the typical broad and intense excitation bands in the Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped samples monitored at the NIR region also originate from the charge transfer transition of Mn4+–O2− and spin-allowed transitions of Mn4+: 4A2 → 4T1, Mn4+: 4A2 → 4T2. The characteristics of the above PLE spectra demonstrate that the NIR luminescence of Nd3+/Yb3+ in Mn4+, Nd3/Yb3+ co-doped samples is generated by the energy transfer sensitization from Mn4+ to Nd3+/Yb3+ ions.

In order to optimize the NIR emission performance, the PL for the Ca14−x/yZn6Al10−zO35: Mnz, Ndx/Yby materials with different Mn4+ and Nd3+/Yb3+ doping concentrations were systemically investigated under excitation at 460 nm. When the Mn4+ content is fixed (z = 0.2), it is found that the NIR PL intensity in both the Mn4+, Nd3+ co-doped and Mn4+, Yb3+ co-doped samples increases at first with the increase of the content of rare earth ions, reaching the maximum at x = 0.25 and y = 0.8, respectively, and then decreases gradually as the result of the concentration quenching, just as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). When the Nd3+ and Yb3+ doping contents are fixed at x = 0.25 and y = 0.8, the NIR PL intensity of Nd3+ and Yb3+ can be further enhanced significantly by increasing the Mn4+ doping content (see Fig. 6(c) and (d)), respectively. The NIR emission intensities of the Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions both reach their maximum at z = 0.6. Compared with the Ca13.75Zn6Al10O35: Nd0.25 and Ca13.2Zn6Al10O35: Yb0.8 samples, the NIR luminescence intensity is enhanced by 338 times at 1060 nm for Ca13.75Zn6Al9.4O35:Mn0.6, Nd0.25 and 306 times at 980 nm for Ca13.2Zn6Al9.4O35:Mn0.6, Yb0.8, respectively. The enhancement of the NIR emission induced by co-doped Mn4+ indicates the efficient energy transfer from Mn4+ to Nd3+/Yb3+ ions.

The energy transfer efficiency depends on how well the acceptor energy levels match the frequencies of the donor emission. As we compare the emission spectra of Mn4+ single-doped sample with the excitation spectra of Nd3+ single-doped sample, we can find a good spectral overlap between the Mn4+: 2E emission and the Nd3+: 4F9/2, 4F7/2, 4S3/2 excitation, as shown in Fig. 7(a). Therefore, it enables the efficient sensitization NIR emission by nonradiative resonant energy transfer from Mn4+ to Nd3+ ions via the process Mn4+: 2E + Nd3+: 4I9/2 → Mn4+: 4A2 + Nd3+: 4F9/2, 4F7/2, 4S3/2. From Fig. 7(b), and we can see that there is relatively large energy gap between the Mn4+: 2E level and Yb3+: 2F5/2 level. It seems that efficient sensitization NIR emission by resonant energy transfer from Mn4+ to Yb3+ is unlikely. However, efficient energy transfer from Mn4+ to Yb3+ can still take place in the Mn4+, Yb3+ co-doped samples. From the emission spectrum of Mn4+: 2E → 4A2 shown in Fig. 7(b), we can see that the emission sideband almost extends from the peak at 715 nm to 850 nm, which indicates the strong electron–phonon coupling in Ca14Zn6Al10O35. The strong electron–phonon coupling is beneficial to the phonon-assisted energy transfer.30 Therefore the NIR luminescence of Yb3+ might be mainly generated by phonon-assisted energy transfer from Mn4+ to Yb3+.

The excitation/emission and energy transfer pathways for the Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ ion couples in Ca14Zn6Al10O35 are illustrated in Fig. 8. Firstly, the Mn4+ ions are excited into their charge-transfer or 4T1, 4T2 excited states by the irradiation. Then the excited Mn4+ ions rapidly relax to their metastable 2E state, and the energy transfer takes place via Mn4+: 2E + Nd3+: 4I9/2 → Mn4+: 4A2 + Nd3+: 4F9/2, 4F7/2, 4S3/2 or Mn4+: 2E + Yb3+: 2F7/2 → Mn4+: 4A2 +Yb3+: 2F5/2. The following nonradiative relaxation among the intra-4f shell energy levels performs the population of Nd3+: 4F3/2 and Yb3+: 2F5/2 levels, resulting in the 900, 1060 and 980 nm emissions, respectively.

In order to further understand the energy transfer process and estimate the energy transfer sensitization efficiency, the luminescence decay curves of the Mn4+: 2E → 4A2 emission were measured in the Ca14−x/yZn6Al9.8O35: Mn0.2, Ndx/Yby (from x = 0.00 to 0.40; from y = 0.0 to 1.2) samples under excitation at 460 nm, as shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the decay rate increases with the increase of Nd3+/Yb3+ contents. The effective lifetime of the Mn4+ luminescence is expressed as 
(1)where I(t) is the time dependent luminescence intensity of Mn4+ and τ is the decay lifetime of Mn4+ luminescence. The calculated decay lifetimes are all listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the lifetime of Mn4+ luminescence decreases monotonously from 1.123 to 0.413 ms with the Nd3+ content increasing from 0.00 to 0.40 and from 1.123 to 0.652 ms with the Yb3+ content increasing from 0.0 to 1.2. The Nd3+/Yb3+ concentration dependence of the decay lifetime proves the nonradiative energy transfer process from Mn4+ to Nd3+/Yb3+. The energy transfer efficiency (ηET) can be calculated by31 
(2)Where τ and τ0 are the lifetimes of the Mn4+ luminescence in the Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped and Mn4+ single-doped cases, respectively. The estimated energy transfer efficiencies are listed in Table 1. As expected, with the increase of Nd3+/Yb3+ content, the energy transfer efficiency gradually increases due to the decrease of distance between donor (Mn4+) and acceptor (Nd3+/Yb3+). It should be pointed out that the near infrared emission intensity will decrease when the Nd3+/Yb3+ doping concentration exceeds a certain value, although the Mn4+ → Nd3+/Yb3+ energy transfer probability always increases with the enhancement of Nd3+/Yb3+ doping concentration in our experiment. This means that fluorescence quenching is inevitable because of the intensified Nd3+–Nd3+ or Yb3+–Yb3+ interaction at high Nd3+/Yb3+ concentration.

It is known that the energy transfer types include radiation reabsorption, exchange interaction, and multipolar interaction. For the Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+, the energy transfer based on radiation reabsorption can be neglected because the structure of the emission spectra of Mn4+ is hardly changed in Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ phosphors with Nd3+/Yb3+ content increasing (see Fig. 10). If the energy transfer takes place by exchange interaction, the critical distance between the donor and acceptor should be short enough (<5 Å).32 The distance (RC) between the Mn4+ and Nd3+/Yb3+ ions were estimated with the following equation33 
(3)Here xC is the critical concentration of the doped ions, V is the volume of the unit cell of Ca14Zn6Al10O35 (3286.7 Å3). N is the number of Ca2+ ions in the unit cell (N = 86). The critical concentration are estimated to be about 0.032 and 0.107 for the Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+ and Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Yb3+ from the total concentration of the Mn4+ and Nd3+/Yb3+ ions at which the energy transfer efficiency is 50%. Thus by using eqn (3), the critical distances are estimated to be 13.1 Å in Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+ and 8.8 Å in Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Yb3+. These values are all larger than the typical critical distance for exchange interaction (<5 Å), indicating that the exchange interaction plays an unimportant role in the Mn4+ → Nd3+/Yb3+ energy transfer process. Thus the energy transfer should be performed via electric multipolar interaction.

Base on Dexter's theory of multipolar interaction and Reisfeld's approximation, the type of multipolar interaction between donor and acceptor ions can be expressed in the following equation:34–36 
(4)τ0 and τ are the luminescence decay lifetimes of the donor (Mn4+) in the absence and presence of the acceptor (Nd3+/Yb3+), respectively. C is the acceptor (Nd3+/Yb3+) concentration, and n = 6, 8 and 10 represent the dipole–dipole, dipole–quadrupole, and quadrupole–quadrupole interactions, respectively. With the experimental data, the τ0/τ–Cn/3 plots are illustrated in Fig. 11. The best linear relationship is obtained when n = 6 for both Mn4+, Nd3+ co-doped and Mn4+, Yb3+ co-doped samples, indicating that a dipole–dipole interaction is predominantly responsible for the energy transfer of Mn4+ → Nd3+/Yb3+.

The luminescence decay curves of Mn4+ can also be further analyzed by the generalized Yokota–Tanimoto (Y–T) model:37,38 
(5)with , where τ0 is the decay constant of the donor (Mn4+) luminescence in the single-doped sample, S is the parameter of multipolar interaction that represents the dipole–dipole (S = 6), dipole–quadrupole (S = 8), and quadrupole–quadrupole (S = 10) interactions, respectively. C is the acceptor (Nd3+/Yb3+) concentration. Γ(x) is the gamma function, and C(S)DA is the donor–acceptor energy transfer parameter. ai and bi are the approximant coefficients involved in the electric multipolar interaction. D is the diffusion parameter that characterizes the excitation diffusion among donor ions. In principle, the excited donor ions can transfer their energy to the acceptor ions directly, or after the energy transfer between the nearest donor ions via excitation diffusion until an acceptor ion is reached. It is found in our experiment that the luminescence decay curves of Mn4+ in Mn4+ single-doped samples almost have no change as Mn4+ doping content increases from z = 0.2 to 0.6, as shown in Fig. 12(a). The result indicates that the Mn4+ radiation decay curve is mainly determined by its spontaneous emission of the isolated Mn4+ ions and the diffusion among the Mn4+ ions is of no importance. Thus the diffusion parameter of D can be set to 0. In this generalized Y–T model, the obtained best fitting is at S = 6 for Mn4+, Nd3+ co-doped and Mn4+, Yb3+ co-doped samples, as shown in Fig. 12(b) and (c). This further indicates the energy transfer between the Mn4+ and Nd3+/Yb3+ ions is performed via dipole–dipole interaction.

The decay curves are recorded at 710 nm emission under excitation at 460 nm. 
The SEM images of the Ca13.75Zn6Al9.4O35: Mn0.6, Nd0.25 and Ca13.2Zn6Al9.4O35: Mn0.6, Yb0.8 phosphors are shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b). The phosphors present coherent flake structure. Thus they are likely to be fabricated onto the front surface of solar cells as planar down-shifting layer (shown in Fig. 13(c)). Based on eqn (1) and (2), it is found that the calculated energy transfer efficiency for the Ca13.75Zn6Al9.4O35: Mn0.6, Nd0.25 and Ca13.2Zn6Al9.4O35: Mn0.6, Yb0.8 samples are as high as 76.0% and 80.4%, respectively. Moreover, the integrated NIR luminescent intensity of Yb3+ is 1.12 orders higher than that of Nd3+ in Ca13.75Zn6Al9.4O35: Mn0.6, Nd0.25 and Ca13.2Zn6Al9.4O35: Mn0.6, Yb0.8 under same excitation conditions (excited by 460 nm light) and the Si-based solar cell is more sensitive to the 980 nm light emitted by Yb3+ than the 900, 1060 nm light emitted by Nd3+. Thus the Ca13.2Zn6Al9.4O35: Mn0.6, Yb0.8 phosphor might be more suitable for spectral down-shifting application.

4. Conclusions
In summary, novel NIR phosphors of Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ with high-efficiency are prepared. The Ca14Zn6Al10O35: Mn4+, Nd3+/Yb3+ phosphors exhibit strong absorption due to the Mn4+–O2− charge transfer transition and Mn4+ (3d)-electronic spin-allowed transitions and give intense near infrared emission caused by the energy transfer from Mn4+ to Nd3+/Yb3+. It means that the phosphors can possibly be used as spectral conversion materials to enhance the efficiency of Si-based solar cells. The spectral conversion mechanism is investigated in detail according to their excitation–emission spectra and luminescence decay performance. The dipole–dipole interaction induced energy transfers are responsible for the strong NIR emission of Nd3+/Yb3+ under the excitation of the light ranging from 250 to 550 nm.
