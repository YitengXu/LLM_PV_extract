    , Accepted 21st May 2018First published on 12th June 2018AbstractAlthough significant progress has been made on the performance of inorganic–organic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the commercialization of these PSCs is seriously hampered by their poor thermal/moisture stability. Inorganic cesium-based perovskites with relatively high phase stability are ideal alternatives although they still suffer from low photoelectrical conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, for the first time, fluorine (F) was introduced into the X-site of ABX3 to modulate bulk-phase heterostructures and tolerance factors of inorganic CsPbBrI2−xFx with significantly enhanced PCE and stability. The α-/δ-phase heterojunction is beneficial for efficient dissociation of excitons and charge transport driven by the matched energy band offsets. The lifetime of charge carriers is prolonged due to the retarded charge recombination, which is evidenced by time resolved photoluminescence results; this results in improved short-circuit current density (JSC). In view of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, partial substitution of iodine by fluorine (with a smaller ionic radius) in the ABX3 structure enlarges the inadequate index to stabilize the α-CsPbBrI2 structure. The CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 PSC with an optimized α-/δ-phase heterostructure displays a superior PCE of up to 10.26% and structural stability against moisture and time. This study sets up a new avenue for designing high-performance PSCs for potential industrial applications.
1. Introduction
Owing to their various advantages such as ambipolar transport behavior, high mobility of both charge carriers,1,2 suitable band gap for light harvesting3 and low-cost feasible process,4–7 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been rapidly developed and can be compared with traditional silicon solar cells. Definitely, the freshly prepared typical PSCs with methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA) can achieve striking PCE close to the Shockley–Queisser limit;8,9 this highlights their promising future. However, one severe challenge for the commercialization of PSCs is their poor stability under ambient conditions. Some strategies10,11 have been adopted to solve this, but the underlying problems of degradation against thermal/humid stress and the high cost of encapsulation are yet to be solved. To overcome this, multiple engineering has been applied, such as use of additives12 and chemical composition engineering, to thermodynamically stabilize the cubic structure of the ABX3 formula. Cesium (Cs) has been reported to cooperate with MA13 or FA14,15 for better photo-induced charge segregation and stability resistance to moisture and high temperature. Additionally, triple (MA/FA/Cs)16 and quadruple (MA/FA/Cs/Rb)17 cation perovskites have been recently reported. McMeekin et al.18 and Yi et al.19 mixed both cations and halides, delivering the possibility of long-term stability through first principle computations. The majority of blending-ion strategies abide by the tolerance factor (t) within the range 0.81–1.11. However, the structural stability is still affected by the volatile and hygroscopic nature, provided that organic cations are remained.
The ultimate way to avoid the disadvantages associated with organic cations is to completely replace them with inorganic cations. However, as is known, the most suitable Cs-based perovskite α-CsPbI3—possessing a band gap of 1.73 eV—is not stable at room temperature. The reverse phase transition from the yellow orthorhombic phase (δ) to the black cubic phase (α) is supposed to occur beyond 328 °C. Thus, the α-CsPbI3 quantum dots remain stable in ambient air due to the large contribution of surface energy, but require a complex synthesis procedure;20 Eperon and coworkers have developed a route to form an α-CsPbI3 film that crystallizes at 100 °C by adding hydroiodic acid (HI) to a precursor solution in the absence of air, and the metastable phase changes to the orthorhombic phase upon exposure to air.21 It has been reported that cubic CsPbBr3 is relatively stable at low temperatures and displays a boosted open circuit voltage (VOC) of up to 1.32 V, but with heavy loss of short-circuit current density (JSC).22 Taking advantage of compositional engineering, halogens such as chlorine, bromine and iodine can be incorporated to control the stability and light harvesting ability. Different ratios of iodine to bromine have been explored to balance two crucial metrics, among which CsPbBrI2 may be dominant.23–27 However, even if the phase stability of CsPbBrI2 is preferred over that of CsPbI3, it is of great importance and challenge to further improve the stability of the α-phase under an ambient atmosphere and its PSC performance. It has been reported that the cubic phase of inorganic perovskites is much more stable if the effective tolerance factor (teffective) is between 0.9 and 1.0.25–27 The teffective value of CsPbBrI2 is 0.81, much less than the empirical value for the cubic phase. It has been hypothesized that replacement of halide ions by smaller ions, such as F, may improve the stability of the α-phase in the heterojunction.
Herein, we report a fluorine-modulated bulk-heterojunction of inorganic cesium lead halide PSCs with enhanced efficiency and stability. When a built-in electric field is introduced, the bulk-phase heterojunction becomes superior in terms of charge generation and transport with decreased recombination loss, which has been systematically investigated by photoelectric measurements. The structural stability of the α-phase was also improved via amplifying the inadequate tolerance factor of CsPbBrI2 through substituting F (with a smaller radius) for I. As the fraction of F increased, the teffective of CsPbBrI2−xFx increased, greatly enhancing the structural-stability of CsPbBrI2−xFx. The CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 PSC with an optimized α-/δ-phase heterostructure achieved an enhanced PCE of up to 10.26%. Without encapsulation, the phase heterojunction cell retained 69.81% of its initial PCE after 240 h of storage in a chamber with a constant humidity of RH 20% at room temperature, whereas the pristine cubic CsPbBrI2 heterojunction in the α phase retained only 4.20% of its initial PCE.
2. Experimental
Material preparation and device fabrication
An etched fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was cleaned with deionized water, acetone and ethanol, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 20 min. The compact TiO2 layer (c-TiO2) and mesoporous TiO2 layer (m-TiO2, a 2:5 dilution of Dyesol 18NR-T paste) were then spin-coated on the FTO glass and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in succession. After cooling, the sample was treated with 0.02 M TiCl4 solution for 20 min at 70 °C and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min again. Perovskite precursors (0.8 M) were prepared by mixing CsBr, PbI2 and PbF2 according to the stoichiometric proportions of 1:1:0, 2:1.9:0.1, 2:1.7:0.3, 2:1.5:0.5 and 2:1.3:0.7 for each group in a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Aladdin-reagent) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Aladdin-reagent) in a 7:3 volume ratio. After stirring at 60 °C overnight, 33 μL of hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt%, 99.99%) was added to the precursors followed by stirring for another 12 h at room temperature. Before usage, all precursors were filtered to ensure the quality of the deposited films. The perovskite film was spin-coated on glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in a glovebox. Spiro-OMeTAD solution consisting of 68 mM Spiro-OMeTAD, 55 mM tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and 9 mM lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) in chlorobenzene was deposited as a hole transport layer. Finally, the devices were taken out of the glovebox and completed using about 60 nm Ag electrode evaporated on top of the whole cell.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination was performed by an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D'max-2500 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA, λ = 1.5418 Å). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100) images were obtained at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were conducted using an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher) system based on C 1s at 284.7 eV. The morphologies of perovskite films and the cross-sections of the prepared cells were characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU-70) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDS) detector. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and UV-visible absorption spectra were respectively obtained by a Cary-50 spectrometer (Varian Co.) and TU-1901 spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained using an FLS920 all-functional fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh). Photovoltaic performance was measured by a Keithley 2420 analyzer with a solar simulator (Newport, Class 3A, 94023A) of AM 1.5 G sunlight (100 mW cm−2). Incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained by a multimeter (Keithley 2400) equipped with a power source (Newport 300W xenon lamp, 66920) and monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in the frequency range from 0.1 to 105 Hz at a bias close to the open-circuit voltage.
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns present the structure of CsPbBrI2−xFx as a function of x (x in CsPbBrI2−xFx is obtained according to the EDS and XPS measurements from both top-view and cross-section for the F content in the entire film). For pure CsPbBrI2, the peaks at 2θ = 14.58°, 20.57° and 29.42° corresponded to (100), (110) and (200) planes of α-CsPbBrI2, in good agreement with previous reports.28,29 A series of perovskite films was prepared in the same way by increasing the F concentration via 5%, 15%, 25% and 35% PbF2 addition in the precursor. Moreover, three XRD peaks indexed as the α-phase were present in all the five samples.

HRTEM images of (c) α-CsPbBrI2 and (d) CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 in α-/δ-phase heterojunction. Insets are respectively the SAED patterns of these samples. In (c), the diffraction rings correspond to the (200), (210), (310) and (321) planes of the α-phase. For (d), the diffraction rings correspond to the (110), (200), (210), (310), and (321) planes of the α-phase, and (015) and (133) planes of the δ-phase. 
When the F ratio was larger than 0.12, the δ-phase peak at around 13° was observed, indicating the formation of an α-/δ-phase heterojunction. As the incorporated concentration of F increased from 0 to 0.12, the positions of all the α-phase peaks shifted to higher angles; this confirmed that the smaller fluorine ion (133 Å) replaced the larger iodine ion (220 Å); this resulted in shrinkage of the lattice. Table S1† summarizes the lattice constants in the face-centered cubic form estimated via Bragg's law on the basis of the (110) peaks. A rough calculation for the mixed-phase films was carried out by the XRD semi-quantitative analysis route, and it was found that the δ-phase accounted for about 10%, 20% and 30% in CsPbBrI1.88F0.12, CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 and CsPbBrI1.72F0.28 samples, respectively. To probe the chemical bonding state, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study (Fig. 2). In the XPS spectra with F, the peaks assigned to Pb 4f, Br 3d and I 3d respectively exhibited 0.18 eV, 0.23 eV and 0.15 eV shifts to positions at higher bonding energies; this was indicative of the contraction of PbX6 octahedra due to a larger overlap among the orbitals than that with iodide.30 There was no signal of F 1s for CsPbBrI2, contrary to the core level peak at 687.37 eV for CsPbBrI1.78F0.22; this demonstrated that fluorine ions were indeed inserted into the crystal lattice. Irrespective of the change in the crystal phase, the structure of the CsPbBrI2−xFx unit, as depicted in Fig. 1b, just presented the replacement of I− by F−.

The formation of the α-/δ-phase heterostructure was further identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns obtained, the diffraction rings shown in Fig. 1c indicate that the nanocrystalline CsPbBrI2 is in a single α-phase, whereas the diffraction rings shown in Fig. 1d match those of the two phases well, where the (110), (200), (210), (310), and (321) planes are indexed to the α-phase and (015) and (133) planes are indexed to the δ-phase. To verify the possible differences in surface morphology of the synthesized films, the top views of each composition were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. S1†). Obviously, from CsPbBrI2 to CsPbBrI1.78F0.22, the more the F ions were doped, the larger the perovskite crystals gradually grew. Better coverage and fewer pinholes were mirrored at the same time. It was disappointing that the grain size drastically became extremely small at the F ratio of 0.28; this made the corresponding perovskite thin film less compact. However, we could not differentiate the two phases in the SEM images. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, see Fig. S2 and 3†) shows homogeneous distribution of each element, showing that F has been successfully incorporated uniformly rather than being concentrated on the surface and at the grain boundaries.
Optical properties of CsPbBrI2 and α-/δ-phase heterojunction as a function of x were investigated. The controlled α-CsPbBrI2 film exhibited an absorption edge of 630 nm (see Fig. 3a), leading to a band gap of 1.87 eV detected from the intercept of the Tauc plot (Fig. S5†), which agreed with the purported numbers precisely.22 A slight red shift was observed as the fluorine content increased from 0.12 to 0.22 in the phase hybrid, leading to narrowing of the direct band gap from 1.85 eV to 1.84 eV. We speculated that the interaction between the electrons and the more positively delocalized F− impurity ions changed the density of states.31 It was disappointing that CsPbBrI1.72F0.28 deviated from the gradual changing regulation and altered to a wider band gap (1.86 eV) than CsPbBrI1.78F0.22; this relatively limited its ability to harvest light. Considering the formation of α-/δ-phase hybrids, this probably originated from the excess of the second phase, whose band gap was evaluated to be 2.82 eV with absorption edge at 425 nm (see Fig. S6a and b†). Among the three composite samples, CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 was superior to CsPbBrI1.88F0.12 and CsPbBrI1.72F0.28 in terms of light absorption range and intensity, which outlined the most suitable blend ratio of the two phases induced by incorporating F. The position of PL emission peaks (as shown in Fig. 3b) slightly shifted, in good alignment with the absorption spectra, except for those of CsPbBrI1.72F0.28. The linear relationship shown in Fig. S7† suggested that the perovskite mixtures followed Vegard's law.26,27 PL intensity quenching of the α-/δ-phase heterojunction relative to that of pristine CsPbBrI2 was observed, illustrating weaker radiative recombination of electrons and holes in the integrated phase heterojunction. The heterojunction with an appropriate phase mixing ratio facilitated charge distribution. The exact energy level structure calculated on the basis of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra shown in Fig. 3c–d is displayed in Fig. 3e. The Fermi level of the CsPbBrI2−xFx film shifted to more negative potential as the F ratio increased from 0 to 0.22; this favored better charge separation. It was clearly perceived that CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 occupied the shallowest conduction band edge (CBE) and valence band edge (VBE), establishing a better-matched band structure with the hole transport material (HTM) spiro-OMeTAD and electron transport material (ETM), TiO2. The charge carrier lifetimes of CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 and CsPbBrI2 were acquired by fitting the bi-exponential decays to the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (Fig. 3f), and the fitting results are summarized in Table S2.† The value of the fast decay (τ1) of CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 with the inclusion of the second phase was 1.69 ns as compared to 0.75 ns of CsPbBrI2, revealing fewer defects or traps in the CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 film. Moreover, the slow decay (τ2), which is generally ascribed to non-radiative recombination, provides the values of 19.01 and 3.24 ns.32 Consequently, the average lifetime of the heterojunction perovskite incorporated with fluorine turned out to be 6.11 ns, outweighing that of the CsPbBrI2 film (1.16 ns). We can argue that the transport quality of the CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 film for photoexcited charge carriers is far more prominent because of more efficient electron–hole pair dissociation in the heterostructure composed of α and δ-phases.

Fermi levels and VBE energies are investigated directly from the UPS spectra, and the CBE energies are calculated by subtracting the band gap values extracted from the intercepts in the Tauc plots. (f) TRPL spectra of the CsPbBrI2−xFx films. 

Fig. 4a shows the mechanisms of electron–hole separation and transport in the closely packed phase heterojunction. The band structure of δ-phase was monitored by UPS spectroscopy (Fig. S6c and d†). CBE of the δ-phase was more negative than that of the α-phase, and VBE of the α-phase was more positive than that of the δ phase. Due to the well-aligned band structure, the charge carriers could easily hop away from the hetero-interface upon light irradiation driven by the CB offset of 1.29 eV and VB offset of 0.34 eV, which simultaneously conquered the dissociation barrier of the Frenkel exciton. As a result of the electric field built in the phase heterojunction, the photogenerated electrons in the δ-phase inclined to be transferred to the α-phase, whereas the photogenerated holes in the α-phase inclined to be transferred to the δ-phase.33 Moreover, the lifetimes of the charge carriers were prolonged due to the retarded recombination and promoted charge transfer, corresponding to the TRPL results.

Mesoporous PSCs in the normal configuration glass/FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (Fig. S8†) were fabricated for investigating the photoelectric properties. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the champion solar devices in each group (containing 16 devices) are provided in Fig. 4b, and the corresponding data are tabulated in Table 1. As was anticipated from the optical perspective, the best PCE of 10.26% originated from CsPbBrI1.78F0.22, quantifying the highest JSC of 14.94 mA cm−2. It was supposed that the F-induced bulk-phase-heterojunction benefitted the charge transport process in the perovskite layer, which was in agreement with the aforementioned finding from the PL and TRPL measurements, and thus, the photocurrent density (JSC) improved. JSC in CsPbBrI1.72F0.28 reduced as the α phase lost its dominance over the interpenetrating heterostructure, and lattice defects were induced intensely. Fig. 5 shows the statistical performances of the total fabricated PSCs according to Tables S3–S6,† implying smaller standard deviation and better reproducibility of the heterojunction groups—especially for FF—when the doping ratio is 0.22. To assess photocurrent generation and charge separation performance, incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 4c) were examined, accompanied by integrated current density that matched the J–V curves. Throughout the wavelength range from 300 nm to 700 nm, the IPCE of the best performing phase heterojunction PSC CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 was higher than that of CsPbBrI2. Moreover, the average parameters reproduced the tendency validated in Fig. 4b.

We analyzed charge carrier dynamic processes through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). From the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 4d, the sheet resistance (RSH) and charge carrier transport resistance (RCT) can be fitted in terms of these semicircles by the inset equivalent circuit.34,35 Detailed information is listed in Table S7.† The values of RSH were similar for the cell configurations, except for the perovskite layer, and the fabrication condition was controlled. RCT dropped initially and then increased as x increased, which was responsible for the opposite variation in JSC. The minimum RCT was read from CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 PSC to be around 42.12 Ω, reduced by 28% relative to that of CsPbBrI2 PSC (58.50 Ω). Hence, we speculated that the α-/δ-phase heterojunction was capable of separating photogenerated electron–hole pairs effectively and enhancing the conductivity with appropriate F incorporation fraction; this was consistent with the increase in charge carrier lifetime derived from the abovementioned TRPL measurement.
A simple stability test was implemented under a high humidity of 70% for 24 h. After one-step deposition of the precursor solution, all he prepared samples darkened once they were placed on a 150 °C hot plate; this indicated the formation of the black α-phase. Considering the contrast images shown in Fig. S9,† we clarify that the CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 and CsPbBrI1.72F0.28 films, which do not fade badly, are more phase stable against humid stress than the CsPbBrI2 film and those with lower F fractions whose cubic lattices collapsed and transformed into the yellow δ-phase. The improved stability of the α-/δ-phase heterojunction can be explained in two ways. The δ-phase part of the heterostructure was thermodynamically stable at low temperatures. As more fluorine was inserted into the cesium lead halide lattice, the Goldschmidt tolerance factor enlarged and became closer to the stable value.15 For the purpose of primitively testing the stability of F-induced phase hybrid PSCs, we stored the fabricated cells without encapsulation in a chamber under the condition of RH 20% at room temperature and took them out every 24 h to ascertain their J–V characteristics. The normalized four crucial parameters of CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 and CsPbBrI2 PSCs can be seen in Fig. 6. VOC of the α-/δ-phase heterojunction CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 PSCs did not reduce even after 10 days, and that for CsPbBrI2 merely declined on a very small scale, maintaining 84.72% of the initial VOC. It was also noted that 95.52% (CsPbBrI1.78F0.22) and 68.66% (CsPbBrI2) of FF were retained, both of which presented smooth diminutions. However, when it came to JSC, things were quite distinctive. The former exhibited degradation less than 30%, whereas the latter exhibited reservation less than 10%. Rapid JSC reduction of the unsealed CsPbBrI2 PSC appeared within the first 72 h with the loss of more than 80%. This was partially interpreted as the permeation of the silver electrodes through the HTM (spiro-OMeTAD) into the perovskite layer that resulted in a reaction of the metal with the halides and irreversible damage to JSC.36 Despite the fact that the degradation stemmed from the permeable metal electrode in common, the CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 PSC exceeded the original CsPbBrI2 PSC due to substantial stability of the F-induced α-/δ-phase heterojunction perovskite material. Overall, the remaining PCE of the aged CsPbBrI1.78F0.22 device over a period of 10 days was elucidated to be 69.81% of its initial value, in sharp contrast to that of CsPbBrI2, which was just 4.20%. The stability of the perovskite film was enhanced, and long term performance of the corresponding cells was improved as well.

4. Conclusion
In brief, we opened a new approach for stabilizing all-inorganic cesium-based perovskites by incorporating (smaller) F− into mixed halide octahedra under the rule of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which paralleled the formation of an α-/δ-phase heterojunction. It was certain from the experimental results that phase stability against moisture and photoelectric property—including the generation and transport process of photoexcited charge carriers—were enhanced with an optimal dosage concentration of CsPbBrI1.78F0.22, giving rise to IPCE and conductive property. Eventually, the bulk-heterojunction exhibited minimization of charge recombination, contributing to the intriguing PCE in excess of 10% with a JSC of 14.94 mA cm−2, which was improved by 20% for the best and average records as compared to that of CsPbBrI2 PSCs. It was also apparently evidenced that CsPbBrI1.5F5 PSCs withstanding constant temperature and humidity retained 69.81% of the initial PCE after 10 days, suppressing device degradation over time. Furthermore, this study provides a fresh idea for building phase heterojunctions in PSCs, giving new guidance to the future progress of these photovoltaic applications.
