    , Accepted 5th June 2022First published on 6th June 2022AbstractPerylene-based orthogonal triads were synthesized by attaching two identical electron donor units, i.e., phenothiazine (PTZ, Pery-2PTZ) and phenoxazine (PXZ, Pery-2PXZ), to investigate symmetry breaking spin–orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC). The ISC efficiency was highly dependent on the solvent polarity, which was the maximum in solvents with medium polarity (singlet oxygen quantum yield ΦΔ = 46–70%) and higher than that of the previously reported Pery-PTZ/Pery-PXZ dyads (ΦΔ = 20–60% in DCM). Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed the symmetry-breaking charge transfer (SBCT) process in these compact electron donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) triads, where charge separation (CS) occurred in ca. 0.17–0.27 ps, followed by SOCT-ISC within 1.0–2.6 ns, which are faster than those in the previously reported analogue dyads (CS, 0.25–0.49 ps and ISC, 0.99–5.98 ns). An exceptionally long-lived triplet state was observed for the triads in DCM solution (τT = 359 μs), in glycerol triacetate (τT = 1.62–1.83 ms) and in polymer films (τT = 4.03–5.0 ms). The low-lying long-lived 3CT state of the triad in polar solvent was confirmed by an intermolecular photosensitizing method. Solvent-dependent, triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA)-based p-type delayed fluorescence was observed for the triads (luminescence lifetime = 114 μs under the specific experimental conditions). The triads were also used as efficient triplet photosensitizers for the generation of delayed fluorescence with solvent Green-5 as the triplet acceptor and a long luminescence lifetime up to 94.8 μs was observed.
Introduction
Triplet photosensitizers (PSs) are compounds that generate triplet excited state efficiently upon photoexcitation. These compounds have important applications in photocatalysis,1–4 photovoltaics,5,6 triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion,7–10 photodynamic therapy (PDT)11–14 and artificial photosynthesis.15,16 Regarding these applications, strong light absorption, efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), and long-lived triplet state are the desirable photophysical properties for triplet PSs. Their ISC ability can be enhanced through various approaches, including the heavy atom effect (Br, I, Pt, Ru, etc.),11,17–19 exciton coupling20,21 and use of an electron spin converter.22,23 However, for the conventional heavy atom effect-based triplet PSs, their triplet state lifetimes is usually shortened, whereas longer triplet state lifetimes are beneficial for applications of triplet PSs.24–27 Furthermore, all these strategies suffer from some drawbacks, i.e., high cost, toxicity and complicated synthesis.
Considering this, triplet population via charge recombination (CR) in electron donor–acceptor (D–A) systems has attracted considerable attention.28–31 However, in these molecules, the electron donors and acceptors are usually connected with long linkers, and hence the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor is small, resulting in a small electron exchange integral (J < 0.01 cm−1), i.e., there is a small energy gap between the 1CT and 3CT states. In these systems, the 3CT state can be populated by the radical pair ISC (RP-ISC) mechanism, and then via internal conversion, the locally excited (3LE) state is populated, given that it has lower energy than the 3CT state. The main driving force in RP-ISC systems is the hyperfine coupling interaction (HFI) and the corresponding slow ISC (usually on the nanosecond timescale) makes this molecular structural motif inappropriate for the design of heavy atom-free triplet PSs. Due to the long spacer between the donor and acceptor, the synthesis of these molecules is also tricky. Therefore, it is still a challenge to develop heavy atom-free triplet PSs possessing simple molecular structures and high ISC efficiency.
Alternatively, in compact electron D–A dyads/triads, RP-ISC is inhibited due to the large electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor moieties, i.e., larger J value and 1CT/3CT state energy gap. However, the alignment of the electron donor and acceptor in an orthogonal geometry will enhance the population of the triplet excited state through the spin–orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT-ISC) mechanism.32–37 In this process, the CR between the donor and acceptor produces a large change in the molecular orbit angular momentum. This change in momentum produces a torque, which causes electron spin flipping/rephasing, and the molecular orbital angular momentum offsets the electron spin angular momentum change, hence enhancing the ISC. The effective ISC makes compact electron D–A systems efficient triplet PSs. Thus, chromophores such as anthracene,33,36 Bodipy,32,38,39 naphthalimide and naphthalenediimide37,40–42 have been used for the design of compact D–A dyads undergoing SOCT-ISC as triplet PSs. However, to understand the relationship between the SOCT-ISC efficiency and molecular structures, more examples are needed.
Considering this, symmetry-breaking charge transfer (SBCT) is a promising approach for the preparation of heavy atom-free triplet PSs because of the fast charge separation (CS). SBCT is crucial for CS in the photosynthetic reaction center of bacteria.43–45 Upon photoexcitation, SBCT can occur when the excited chromophore is surrounded by several identical units (electron donor or acceptor).45–49 SBCT has faster CS kinetics than the hetero D–A dyads. Usually, the SBCT is more favorable in polar solvents, where the CT state can be stabilized. SBCT-based molecular systems have various applications, such as in artificial photosynthesis,45,50 photonics51 and solar cells.52 Photoinduced SBCT has also been observed in multi-chromophoric systems containing two or more identical molecules, e.g., anthracene,53–55 perylene,56–59 Bodipy60,61 and metallodipyrrins.62,63 In contrast, examples of SBCT systems containing two identical and strong donors are limited.
Using the concept of SBCT together with the orthogonal conformation will be a fascinating approach to design heavy atom-free triplet PSs to exploit SOCT-ISC, which can enhance the CS process and lead to efficient ISC. Recently, numerous studies have been conducted on the photoinduced SOCT-ISC mechanism, which was confirmed by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy.35,64–66 However, studies on the use of the SBCT approach in compact systems to achieve a longer-lived triplet state has rarely been reported. Thus, new molecular structures are needed to study the role or advantage of introducing SBCT in SOCT-ISC dyads or triads.
Previously, we prepared an orthogonal perylene-phenothiazine (Pery-PTZ) dyad, which showed efficient ISC (ΦΔ = 60%), and long-lived triplet excited state (τ = 156 μs).35 Similarly, a perylene-phenoxazine dyad (Pery-PXZ) was reported with high ISC efficiency (ΦΔ = 84%) and long-lived triplet state (τ = 242 μs).67 Taking advantage of these approaches, herein, we investigated the possibility of enhancing the SOCT-ISC with SBCT in compact electron D–A–D triads. For this purpose, we prepared two different perylene triads with a connection of two phenothiazines (PTZ) units in Pery-2PTZ and two phenoxazines (PXZ) units in Pery-2PXZ (Scheme 1). We studied the SBCT process in the triads using steady-state and femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical computations. Upon photoexcitation, efficient CR-induced ISC was observed, especially in medium polarity solvents. Interestingly, in Pery-2PTZ, a higher singlet oxygen quantum yield and longer-lived triplet state were observed than in the dyad (Pery-PTZ). Alternatively, one-atom substitution in the electron donor unit in Pery-2PXZ resulted in different optical spectral properties compared to that of Pery-2PTZ.

Results and discussion
Molecular design rationale of the triads and synthesis
We designed Pery-2PTZ and Pery-2PXZ orthogonal triads (Scheme 1), in which PTZ and PXZ moieties were used as two identical electron donors attached at the 3- and 9-positions of the perylene moiety for both triads, respectively. Substitution at the 3,10-positions of perylene is also possible. PTZ is a well-known electron donor (EOX = +0.18 V, Fc/Fc+), but it has a unique puckered structure, while the PXZ moiety (EOX = +0.20 V, Fc/Fc+) has a planar structure. Previous studies showed more significant electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor in Pery-PXZ than Pery-PTZ, and thus we expected the same trend for the triads Pery-2PXZ and Pery-2PTZ.
Most importantly, in these triads, there are two-electron donor units; therefore electron transfer should be faster than in the previously reported dyads.45,58 It has already been proven that the ISC mechanism in Pery-PTZ and Pery-PXZ dyads is SOCT-ISC,35,67 and thus for the current triads a similar ISC mechanism is expected. Pery-PTZ and Pery-PXZ were used as references for the comparison of the photophysical and photochemical study of triads. 3,9-Dibromoperylene (Pery-2Br) was used as an intermediate for the preparation of the triads and as a reference compound to investigate the ISC process (Scheme 1). The synthesis is based on the Buchwald–Hartwig coupling reaction, the compounds were obtained in satisfactory yield. The molecular structures of all the compounds were verified via1H NMR, 13C NMR and HR-MS spectroscopy (see Experimental section and ESI†).
UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission
The steady-state UV-vis absorption spectra of the compounds were studied (Fig. 1). Pristine perylene shows characteristic structured absorption bands in the range of 350–440 nm. In contrast, both triads showed red-shifted absorption compared with perylene. Pery-2PTZ has an absorption band centered at 447 nm and significant broadening at the red end, which is attributed to its weak CT absorption. It should be noted that the absorption of Pery-2PTZ is slightly red-shifted compared with the previously reported Pery-PTZ dyad (λmax = 441 nm).35 For Pery-2PXZ, its absorption profile is different from that of Pery-2PTZ, and in that case a well-resolved CT absorption band (S0 → 1CT transition) in the range of 460–550 nm was observed (this range is slightly wider than that of the Pery-PXZ dyad of 450–520 nm),67 and a major absorption band centered at 440 nm was observed. The photophysical properties of the compounds are summarized in Table 1.

The observation of a CT band for Pery-2PXZ shows the strong electronic coupling between the electron donor and acceptor at the ground state, which is different from Pery-2PTZ. The red-shifted CT absorption band is beneficial for various applications. It should be noted that the electronic transition is spin allowed for CT absorption in strongly coupled D–A systems.
To quantify the S0 → 1CT transition probability in Pery-2PXZ, the transition dipole moment (Mabs) was calculated by using eqn (1).68 The obtained transition dipole moment of Pery-2PXZ is 3.7 D. Furthermore, based on the CT absorption band of Pery-2PXZ triad, we also calculated the electronic coupling matrix element (VDA) between the Frank–Condon CT state and the ground state using eqn (2).68 The obtained VDA value is listed in Table 2, which indicates that the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor is strong (VDA = 0.15 eV) and in agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra. (1) (2)where ε(ν) is the molar absorption coefficient on the wavenumber scale, in M−1 cm−1; νabs is the maximum of the S0 → 1CT transition band, in cm−1; NA is Avogadro's constant, in mol−1; h is Plank's constant, in erg s; c is the speed of light, in cm s−1; and n is the refractive index of the solvent. In eqn (2), R is the separation between the center of the electron donor and acceptor (in Å); εCTmax is the molar absorption coefficient at the maximum of the CT absorption band, in M−1 cm−1; ν−CTmax is the absorption maximum of the CT absorption band on the wavenumber scale, in cm−1; and Δν−CT1/2 is the full width of the CT band at half maximum, in cm−1. Note that RPery-2PXZ = 6.35 Å was used to estimate VDA, which was determined by DFT optimization of the geometry.

The fluorescence of the compounds was studied (Fig. 2). Perylene showed a structural emission band with significant vibrational progression (fluorescence quantum yield ΦF = 94%). The fluorescence of both triads was significantly quenched compared with perylene (optically matched solutions were used for direct comparison with pristine perylene, as shown in Fig. 2a). A weak band centered at about 550 nm was observed for Pery-2PXZ, while the fluorescence of Pery-2PTZ was almost completely quenched. This result indicates the photoinduced electron transfer in the triads (efficient CS) because the Förster resonance energy transfer from the perylene moiety to PTZ or PXZ moiety is unlikely.
 Fig. 2  (a) Fluorescence emission spectra of the compounds (λex = 392 nm, A = 0.112). Optically matched solutions were used. c = ca. 1.0 × 10−5 M in n-hexane (absorbance of the compounds was the same at the excitation wavelength). Fluorescence emission spectra of the compounds in different solvents. (b) Pery-2PTZ (λex = 394 nm) and (c) Pery-2PXZ (λex = 394 nm; optically matched solutions were used (c ≈ 1.0 × 10−5 M, A ≈ 0.113), 20 °C. 
The solvent polarity-dependent emission was also studied (Fig. 2b and c). In the case of Pery-2PTZ, its emission was weak even in non-polar solvents, indicating that the electron transfer is efficient from the donor to acceptor, even in n-hexane (n-HEX) (Fig. 2b). The fluorescence quantum yield of Pery-2PXZ significantly decreased with an increase in solvent polarity (Fig. 2c). In n-HEX, a band at 550 nm was observed, which shifted to 600 nm in toluene (TOL), and in medium to high polar solvents the emission was completely quenched. These structureless broad emission bands of Pery-2PXZ are the typical CT emission (1CT → S0 transition). This result indicates the CT character of the emissive S1 state of the triad, and thus non-radiative decay is efficient and ISC from 1CT is also possible. These results are consistent with the previously reported dyads.35,67
The fluorescence of the triads was also measured in deaerated n-HEX solution (Fig. S10, ESI†), interestingly the emission intensity significantly increased compared with that measured in aerated solution, and the possible reason for this is the observation of delayed fluorescence, i.e., TTA-based p-type delayed fluorescence (see later section for details).
The fluorescence lifetimes of the triads were studied (Fig. 3). In the case of Pery-2PTZ, its lifetime was 5.7 ns in n-HEX and 7.0 ns in TOL (Fig. 3a). Considering the low fluorescence quantum yield of Pery-2PTZ (ΦF ∼ 1%, Table 1), these long fluorescence lifetimes are anomalous. We propose that the short component of the fluorescence decay (<100 ps) could not be detected by our fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (IRF: 100 ps). This is supported by the femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies. For the triad Pery-2PXZ, its fluorescence lifetimes were 7.9 ns (in n-HEX) and 11.5 ns (in TOL) (Fig. 3b). The prolonged fluorescence lifetime in TOL than in n-HEX is usual. In ACN, both triads showed a slightly shortened fluorescence lifetime, while the CT state with longer fluorescence lifetime is also known.69 Interestingly, for Pery-2PTZ, its fluorescence lifetime substantially increased from 5.5 ns (in aerated solution) to 12.8 ns (in deaerated solution). Similar results were observed for Pery-2PXZ (Fig. S10, ESI†) and these findings are different from the previously reported Pery-PTZ/PXZ dyads.35,67 The concentration-dependent emission spectra and lifetime decay traces were also recorded (Fig. S11, ESI†), where with an increase in concentration, the fluorescence intensity and lifetimes were prolonged. Again, these results directly indicate that delayed fluorescence can be observed upon photoexcitation, i.e., TTA-induced delayed fluorescence (vide infra).

By using emission data, the transition dipole moment (Mfl) and electronic coupling (VDA) were calculated using eqn (3) and (4), respectively. It was found that the VDA of Pery-2PXZ (0.02 eV) and the VDA of Pery-2PTZ (0.01 eV) are similar to that of the previously reported dyads of ca. 0.01 eV.35,67 (3) (4)where νfl is the fluorescence maxima, in cm−1; kr is the radiative rate constant, in s−1; n is the solvent refractive index; Rc is the separation between the center of electron donor and acceptor, in Å; and νmax is the CT fluorescence maxima in cm−1.
Electrochemical study: Gibbs free energy change in the charge separation (ΔG0CS) and the energy levels of the CT states
Experimental evidence of the ISC mechanism can be obtained by comparing the CT energy (ECT) with the 1CT and T1 states energy in different polarity solvents. To calculate the Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG0CS) for the photoinduced electron transfer process and the energy of the CT state (ECT), electrochemical measurements were carried out (Fig. 4). Pristine perylene has a reversible oxidation wave at +0.55 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) in the potential range used, and the PTZ and PXZ moieties have a reversible oxidation wave at +0.18 V and +0.20 V, respectively (Fig. S12, ESI†).

In deaerated DCM containing 0.10 M Bu4N[PF6] as supporting electrolytes, Ag/AgNO3 as the reference electrode. Scan rate: 50 mV s−1, c = 1.0 × 10−3 M, 20 °C. (c) Gibbs free energy changes of charge separation (ΔG0CS) calculated in different solvents. 
In the case of Pery-2PTZ, two reversible oxidation waves at +0.34 V and +0.88 V and a quasi-reversible reduction wave at −2.01 V (vs. Fc/Fc+) were observed (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, the reversible one-electron reduction potential shifted anodically by 0.10 V with respect to the Pery-PTZ dyad (−2.10 V).35,70 Consequently, the electrochemical gap, ΔEredox (the difference between oxidation and reduction potentials), is reduced. Similarly, for Pery-2PXZ, two reversible oxidation wave potentials at +0.36 and +0.90 V and a reversible reduction potential at −2.04 V were observed (Fig. 4b), and a 0.07 V anodic shift was observed compared with the Pery-PXZ dyad (−2.11 V).67 It is important to note that the amplitude of the first oxidation wave of the two triads is much higher than the second oxidation wave.
Hence, we propose that in these triads, the two donor units may be oxidized simultaneously.71 No splitting of the oxidation waves of the two PTZ/PXZ moieties was observed, indicating that the coupling between the two PTZ/PXZ moieties via the perylene linker is negligible. Specifically, the thermally induced electron transfer between the two PTZ/PXZ moieties (one is oxidized) in the triads is negligible,71 resulting in a substantial impact on electron transfer kinetics (electron transfer should be faster than the monosubstituted dyads). Fig. 4c represents the ΔG0CS values in different solvents with increasing ET(30) values, where in non-polar solvents, the ΔG0CS values are positive, while in moderate to highly polar solvents, the values are negative. For Pery-2PXZ, although the ΔG0CS values are positive in non-polar solvent (+0.24 eV in TOL), they become negative with an increase in the solvent polarity (−0.54 eV, in DCM) and (−0.69 eV in ACN).
In comparison with the Pery-PXZ dyad, the ΔG0CS is −0.35 eV in DCM and −0.42 eV in ACN, which indicate that the CS in Pery-2PXZ has a larger driving force than the dyad. This suggests that the charge separation is faster in the triad than in the dyad due to the larger driving force. In addition, these results indicate that the formation of the triplet state through the CR process is thermodynamically allowed in medium polar solvents; however, the driving force for the formation of the triplet state decreases in highly polar solvents due to the lower lying CT state than the 3LE state or the faster CR process towards the ground state. Given that the CR is usually in the Marcus inverted region, the CR becomes faster with a lower CT state energy. This conclusion is in agreement with the solvent polarity-dependent singlet oxygen quantum yields (Table 1) and the intermolecular photosensitizing experiment. The redox potentials and ΔG0CS and ECSS values in different solvents are presented in Table 3.

The chemical oxidation of the triads and reference compounds was carried out in dry ACN at room temperature using nitrosonium hexafluorophosphate (NO[PF6]) as an oxidant (Fig. 5 and Fig. S13, ESI†). The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of Pery-2PXZ˙+ in ACN (Fig. 5a) exhibited the characteristic bands with the absorption maximum at 544 nm and a broad band in the range of 600–840 nm.64,72 The time-dependent DFT calculations (UB3LYP/6-31G(d)) suggested that the low energy absorption band originates from the HOMOβ−3 → LUMOβ (SOMO) transition (f = 0.020). Moreover, this band is similar to that predicted for the radical cation of the dyad (Pery-PXZ˙+) (see later section).

The EPR spectra of the radical cation of the triads in degassed ACN were studied (Fig. 5b). In the case of Pery-2PXZ, three main splitting lines with g = 2.0041 were observed. These spectral lines were successfully reproduced by simulation using the EasySpin software,73 with the following hyperfine coupling constants: 14N nuclei (I = 1) a(14N) = 0.30 mT; two sets of a(1H) nuclei (I = 1/2); 0.12 mT and 0.05 mT. The largest coupling constants of the 1H nuclei were reasonably assigned with the support of the theoretical calculations to the two sets of equivalent a(1H) nuclei at the Ha, Hb and Hc, Hd positions of the PXZ unit, and the existence of a larger positive spin at these positions further confirmed the assignment (Fig. 5c).
Previously, an intervalence optical transition was observed in a mixed-valence cation radical in two PTZ redox centers, where both PTZ units were linked by para-phenylene, ortho-xylylene, or ortho-phenylene compounds.74 However, we did not observe this interaction between the two PXZ/PTZ radical cation units, which can be ascribed to the presence of a perylene chromophore between the two PXZ/PTZ units. This is confirmed by the fact that the dyad Pery-PTZ˙+ showed similar optical bands upon oxidation (Fig. S13, ESI†). The EPR spectrum of Pery-2PTZ˙+ was also measured and simulated with a g-value of 2.0059 (Fig. S14, ESI†). The experimental and calculated hyperfine coupling parameters presented in Table S1 (ESI†).
Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TA): charge separation (CS) and charge recombination (CR) processes
To investigate the excited-state dynamics and confirm the SBCT process in the triads, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectra were measured in solvents with different polarity, including n-HEX, DCM and ACN, at two different excitation wavelengths (400 and 450 nm). Firstly, we measured the spectra of the reference compounds perylene and Pery-2Br (Fig. S15 and S16, respectively, ESI†), where upon photoexcitation, a strong positive excited state absorption (ESA) band (S1 → Sn transition) centered at about 700 nm and the characteristic ground state bleach (GSB) of perylene at around 440 nm were observed. Moreover, a stimulated emission (SE) band in the range of 460–510 nm was observed. No ISC process was observed for perylene, which is in agreement with its strong fluorescence (ΦF = 94%) and its long fluorescence lifetime (4.6 ns). A triplet ESA band at 500 nm was observed for Pery-2Br due to the heavy atom effect, but its triplet state signal was weak due to the slow ISC.
The fs-TA spectra of Pery-2PTZ measured in non-polar (n-HEX), medium polar (DCM) and high polar solvents (ACN) are presented in Fig. 6. The excitation wavelength was 450 nm, preferably exciting the CT absorption band. In all solvents, at a short delay time, an ESA band centered at 590 nm appeared immediately after excitation (Fig. 6a, c and e, upper panel, respectively). Previously, it was reported that the perylene radical anion shows absorption at 585 nm and the PTZ radical cation in the range of 515–530 nm.68,74 Thus, the band at 590 is attributed to the absorption of the perylene radical anion (Pery˙−). However, the absorption of the PTZ radical cation overlapped with the strong perylene anion absorption band. According to the results obtained by chemical oxidation (Fig. S13, ESI†), the absorption of the PTZ radical cation (PTZ˙+) should appear at about 515 nm. The formation of the CS state was fast (ca. 0.12 ps in n-HEX and 0.17 ps DCM).
 Fig. 6  Femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra of Pery-2PTZ in (a) n-hexane at initial delays, (b) n-hexane at long delays, (c) DCM at initial delays, (d) DCM at long delays, (e) ACN at initial delays and (f) ACN at long delays. λex = 450 nm, 20 °C. 
At longer delay times (Fig. 6b, d and f, lower panel, respectively), the CT state decayed and the perylene triplet ESA appeared at 500 nm in DCM within 1 ns, while in n-HEX, the ISC was much slower, i.e., 5.5 ns. No perylene triplet state was observed in ACN due to the fast decay to the S0 state with a time constant of 389 ps, which agrees with the nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) measurements (see later section). In comparison, for the previously reported dyads, CS takes 0.25 ps and the ISC time constant is 0.9 ns (in DCM).35 Thus, the CS of Pery-2PTZ is faster than that of the previously reported dyads, while the ISC time constant is almost the same. By comparing the fs-TA spectra of pristine perylene and the previously reported Pery-PTZ dyads, the ESA band at 700 nm (S1 → Sn transition) was not observed in these triads with both 400 and 450 nm excitation. This is probably due to the ultrafast CS process, which is faster than the response function time of the instrument (IRF: 120 fs), and therefore the state-to-state transition could not be observed in the fs-TA measurements.
Similarly, the fs-TA spectra of Pery-2PXZ in different solvents with 450 nm excitation were studied (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†). Immediately after excitation, ultrafast charge separation occurred (CS = 0.12–0.27 ps) in all the solvents and at longer delay times with the decay of 1CT, the 3Pery* ESA was prominent with a time constant of 7.6 and 2.6 ns in HEX and DCM, respectively. Compared with the previous Pery-PXZ analogue (CS ∼ 0.49 ps and ISC ∼ 5.98 ns),67 the current triad (Pery-2PXZ) showed faster kinetics in DCM. This is reasonable because the two donor units of the triads can promote electron transfer more efficiently.45
Additionally, we also performed the fs-TA measurements with 400 nm excitation (Fig. S19–S22, ESI†), in which case, the observation of the perylene radical anion and PTZ radical cation was more prominent because the perylene moiety can be preferably excited at this excitation wavelength. For both triads, at the initial delay times after excitation, a broad GSB band was observed, which is in good agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra, and the rapid generation of CT was detected with the appearance of the perylene radical anion at 590 nm and PTZ radical cation at 515 nm.35,56,74 At longer delay times, both bands decayed simultaneously and a triplet band appeared in n-HEX and DCM.
Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ns-TA): triplet excited state of the triads
The ISC efficiency can be approximated using the singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ). The singlet oxygen quantum yield of the triads in solvents with different polarity was measured (Table 1). Highly solvent polarity-dependent ΦΔ values were observed, indicating the mechanism is SOCT-ISC, because the 1CT state energy varied with the solvent polarity, and consequently the ISC efficiency fluctuated. In the case of Pery-2PTZ, the ΦΔ was maximum in chloroform (ΦΔ = 70%), while that in DCM was slightly smaller (ΦΔ = 57%). In non-polar solvents, ΦΔ was low (17% in n-HEX), although in TOL, its value was much higher (ΦΔ = 43%). No 1O2 production was observed in highly polar solvents, e.g., ACN, which implied a faster CR process to the ground state. Similar results were observed for Pery-2PXZ, ΦΔ = 46% (in DCM) and 67% (in chloroform). Thus, we concluded that the SOCT-ISC is efficient in medium polar solvents for these triads.
Previously, the orthogonal Pery-PTZ and Pery-PXZ dyads were prepared and their solvent polarity-dependent singlet oxygen quantum yield and ISC kinetics studied. These dyads showed high ISC efficiency in DCM (50–60%) and the SOCT-ISC mechanism was confirmed by TREPR spectroscopy.35,67 The dependency of ΦΔ on the solvent polarity is almost similar for the triads to that previously observed for the above-mentioned dyads.
Here, we studied the triplet state of the triads using nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) spectroscopy (Fig. 7). In the case of Pery-2PTZ, upon nanosecond pulsed laser excitation, an ESA band in the range of 400–550 nm was detected (Fig. 7a). This is the typical ESA band of the perylene triplet state (3Pery*).35 The GSB at about 450 nm overlaps with the triplet ESA band. These transient features of Pery-2PTZ are similar to that found for Pery-PTZ. In the case of Pery-2PTZ, the apparent triplet state lifetime was determined to be 215 μs by monitoring its decay trace at 500 nm in DCM. However, the intrinsic triplet lifetime was determined to be 359 μs (Fig. 7b), which is much longer than the apparent triplet lifetime and the apparent triplet state lifetime of the previously reported Pery-PTZ (τ = 156 μs). It should be highlighted that the apparent triple-state lifetime is underestimated, given that the intrinsic lifetime is longer, because of the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) effect. Therefore, we obtained the intrinsic triplet-state lifetimes of the triads by fitting τT at two different concentrations with a special kinetic model, which accounts for the TTA self-quenching effect (the details of the TTA-based triplet lifetime fitting model are given in the ESI†).75,76

C = 1.0 × 10−5 M. In deaerated DCM, 20 °C. The intrinsic triplet lifetime is presented after fitting the decay curves with the kinetic model by considering the TTA quenching effect.75,76 
Similarly, for Pery-2PXZ, its ns-TA spectra were recorded (Fig. 7c and d) and a perylene triplet ESA was observed in the range of 400–530 nm. Notably, the ESA band of Pery-2PXZ is slightly different from that of Pery-2PTZ and Pery-PXZ.67 This could be due to the disubstitution of the perylene with two PXZ units, which changes the electronic transition of the perylene unit in Pery-2PXZ. The apparent triplet state lifetime was determined to be τT = 171 μs in deaerated DCM. In comparison, the intrinsic triplet state lifetime of Pery-2PXZ was determined to be 216 μs in DCM.
The ns-TA spectra of the triads were also measured in solvents with different polarity (n-HEX, CHCl3 and ACN). In HEX and CHCl3, both triads exhibited the typical perylene localized triplet state ESA in the range of 400–550 nm (Fig. S23, ESI†). However, for Pery-2PXZ, its ESA band profile is different from that of the Pery-PXZ dyad. The apparent triplet state lifetime of Pery-2PTZ is 27.3 μs and 127 μs in HEX and CHCl3, respectively. Similar results were observed for Pery-2PXZ with triplet lifetimes of 18.6 μs in HEX and 119.8 μs in CHCl3. In deaerated chloroform (Fig. S24, ESI†), the τint of Pery-2PTZ (183 μs) and Pery-2PXZ (153 μs) was also determined, and the intrinsic triplet lifetime of the triad Pery-2PXZ was longer than that of the dyad (τT = 116 μs). No triplet state was observed in ACN, which is in agreement with the fast CR to the ground state (see fs-TA section for details). However, the exact reason for the substantial variation in the triplet state lifetimes in different solvents is unclear. Previously, similar results were observed for 2,6-diiodobodipy.77
To confirm the existence of a low-lying CT state in polar solvents, i.e., ACN, we carried out an intermolecular triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) study (Fig. 8), using diiodo-BDP as the triplet energy donor (3LET = 1.65 eV).78 The triplet energy of Pery-2PXZ is about 1.50 eV (approximated by TD-DFT computation); therefore, TTET between diiodo-BDP and the triads is expected. Interestingly, in the presence of Pery-2PXZ, the triplet state lifetime of diiodo-BDP was reduced from 81.2 μs (Fig. S25, ESI†) to 7.9 μs, and a new absorption band at 570 nm attributed to Pery˙− was observed. It has been previously reported that the absorption of Pery˙− appears at around 570 nm,35,56,67,79 while that of PXZ˙+ at around 540 nm. Hence, it is assumed to be an intermolecular charge transfer from diiodo-BDP to the perylene moiety. After global fitting, the CT state lifetime was determined to be 68.2 μs. Given that the CT state energy (2.47 eV) in n-HEX is much higher than that in ACN (1.97 eV), 3Pery* was observed upon TTET in n-HEX (Fig. S26, ESI†).

(a) ns-TA spectra of a mixture of diiodo-BDP (c = 2.0 × 10−5 M) and Pery-2PTZ (c = 1.0 × 10−5 M), (b) decay trace of the mixture at 570 nm and (c) species-associated difference spectra (SADS). λex = 520 nm, 20 °C. 
To study the effect of solvent viscosity on the triplet excited state, the ns-TA spectra in a viscous solvent (glycerol triacetate) were studied (Fig. S27, ESI†). Interestingly, the triplet state lifetimes of both triads were extended to the millisecond timescale. In the case of Pery-2PTZ, the triplet state lifetime was prolonged to 1.62 ms. Similarly, for Pery-2PXZ, its triplet lifetime was extended to 1.83 ms. The stabilization of the triplet excited state in glycerol triacetate indicates that the molecular diffusion is inhibited in viscous medium, and therefore the quenching effect of TTA on the triplet state lifetimes is minimized. Inhibitions of the vibrational coupling may also contribute to the longer triplet state lifetime in viscous solvent.
To study the effect of rigidification on the triplet state decay kinetics, we also measured the ns-TA spectra of the triads doped in commercially available transparent polymer films. Firstly, polyurethane rubber (Clear Flex 50®) was used. In the case of Pery-2PTZ, under deaerated conditions, the ESA band of the perylene triplet state was observed in the range of 400–530 nm (Fig. S28, ESI†). Interestingly, the triplet state lifetime was much longer (4.03 ms in deaerated and 3.67 ms in aerated conditions) compared with the deaerated fluid solution and viscous solvents. Similar results were observed for the Pery-2PXZ triad (τT = 3.62 ms) (Fig. S29, ESI†). We also prepared polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) thin films of the triads (Fig. S30, ESI†) and long triplet state lifetimes were determined (τT = 5 ms).
The reference compound (Pery-2Br) was also studied (Fig. S31, ESI†). The typical perylene triplet ESA band was observed in the range of 400–550 nm. The presence of two bromine atoms promoted efficient triplet production in Pery-2Br but its triplet lifetime was much shorter (τT = 23 μs). When Pery-2Br was doped in a (Clear Flex 50®) thin film (Fig. S32, ESI†), its triplet state lifetime (τT = 27.6 μs) was almost similar to that in fluid solution. It should be noted that these lifetimes are much shorter than that observed with the triads. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantage of the heavy atom-free triplet PSs.
Observation of TTA-based delayed fluorescence upon direct photoexcitation and TTET/TTA-induced delayed fluorescence using an acceptor
We performed transient emission spectroscopy and observed solvent-dependent delayed fluorescence (Fig. 9). It has been previously demonstrated that the delayed fluorescence of compounds can be directly detected using an ns-TA spectrometer in emission mode for compounds with 2ET > ES1.75,80 In the case of Pery-2PTZ, after excitation at 445 nm under an N2 atmosphere, a long-lived emission band was observed at 560 nm (lifetime τDF = 25.8 μs, Fig. 9a and b). This lifetime was 2000-times longer than the prompt fluorescence lifetime measured in n-HEX under deaerated conditions (12.8 ns). Interestingly, in TOL, Pery-2-PTZ showed a red-shifted delayed fluorescence at 630 nm (similar to the CT emission band) with a delayed fluorescence lifetime of 89.7 μs (Fig. 9c and d).

Similar results were observed for Pery-2PXZ, where in n-HEX, its delayed fluorescence band appeared at 550 nm with a lifetime of τDF = 40.2 μs (Fig. S33, ESI†). In TOL, red-shifted delayed fluorescence was observed at 610 nm with a lifetime of 114 μs. The triads did not show any delayed fluorescence in the polar solvents due to the poor ISC. The observation of solvent-dependent delayed fluorescence with the perylene chromophore has rarely been reported.
Generally, two different mechanisms may lead to delayed fluorescence in organic molecules, i.e., E-type delayed fluorescence and p-type delayed fluorescence. The E-type delayed fluorescence, also known as thermally-induced delayed fluorescence, requires a minimum singlet/triplet energy gap, and thus reverse intersystem crossing (T1 → S1 or T1 → 1CT) is possible. Alternatively, TTA-based delayed fluorescence requires the intermolecular collision of two triplets to form the S1 state. Given that the 1CT/T1 state energy gap is large (0.62–0.65 eV), for the triads, the observed delayed fluorescence is most likely via the TTA up-conversion mechanism (P-type delayed fluorescence), which was confirmed by using a viscous solvent (please see the following section). This solvent-dependent P-type delayed fluorescence has not been reported previously for the Pery-PTZ/PXZ dyads.35,67
The efficient ISC and the long triplet lifetimes of the triads make these compounds suitable for various applications. Herein, we applied the triads (Pery-2PTZ and Pery-2PXZ) as triplet PSs for the generation of TTET/TTA-induced delayed fluorescence, with Solvent Green 5 (SG-5) as the energy acceptor/emitter (Fig. 10). TTET and TTA are intermolecular diffusion control processes and should occur on the microsecond timescale in fluid solution at room temperature. For a mixture of Pery-2PTZ with SG-5, upon pulsed laser excitation, the long-lived fluorescence of SG-5 was observed. The kinetics monitored at 510 nm exhibited a biphasic decay feature. The trace of the luminescence contained a growth phase taking 18.3 μs and a decay phase taking 98.4 μs. The rising phase is mainly attributed to the TTET between Pery-2PTZ and SG-5 via the Dexter mechanism, i.e., the accumulation of the SG-5 triplet state. After reaching the maximum concentration, the decay process is dominant, showing an apparent lifetime of 98.4 μs, which is related to the depletion of the triplet state of acceptor (SG-5) due to the TTA process (Fig. 10a). It should be noted that for Pery-2PTZ alone, no growth phase was observed for the kinetic trace of the delayed fluorescence because there is no TTET process. In contrast, upon the addition of an acceptor, a rise phase for the fluorescence was detected (Fig. 10b), indicating the TTET process (Fig. 8b, note that no delayed fluorescence was observed upon direct photoexcitation in polar solvents). Based on the intrinsic triplet state lifetimes and quenched triplet state lifetime of Pery-2PTZ, the TTET efficiency was calculated as 85.5%. Similar results were observed for the Pery-2PXZ triad, with a delayed fluorescence lifetime of 82.7 μs (Fig. S34 and S35, ESI†).

(c) Delayed fluorescence decay trace at 510 nm of a mixture of Pery-2PTZ and SG-5 in deaerated glycerol triacetate (inset: corresponding delayed fluorescence spectra, which show no long-lived delayed fluorescence was observed except the prompt fluorescence of the acceptor. c[photosensitizer] = 1.0 × 10−5 M and [SG-5] = 2.0 × 10−5 M. The spike at time 0 in (b and c) is the scattered laser. λex = 445 nm, 20 °C. 
The observation of delayed fluorescence was confirmed by measuring the same mixed solution under aerated conditions, where only a prompt fluorescence/laser scattering was observed. To further confirm the intermolecular features of the generation of the delayed fluorescence, we used a viscous solvent (glycerol triacetate). Upon pulsed laser excitation of Pery-2PTZ alone, no delayed fluorescence was observed (Fig. 10c). In contrast, after the addition of the triplet acceptor (SG-5), only the prompt fluorescence of the acceptor was detected, which implies that in viscous medium TTET and TTA are prohibited, and hence no long-lived delayed fluorescence was observed.
DFT calculation: frontier molecular orbitals and spin density distribution
The energy-minimized geometries of Pery-2PTZ and Pery-2PXZ are shown in Fig. 11. Firstly, we examined the PTZ and PXZ moieties, where due to the S and O substitution in their central six-membered ring, PTZ shows a butterfly torsion, while PXZ has a planar structure, respectively (Fig. 11, upper panel).81,82 The distortions in PTZ come from the large discrepancy in the bond length of its C–S atoms (1.78 Å) compared with C–O (1.38 Å), creating tilt angles of 32.3° and 15.02° for PTZ and PXZ, respectively, which makes Pery-2PTZ non-planer, while in Pery-2PXZ, the PXZ moiety adopts a planer geometry. Interestingly, in the S1 state, one unit of the PTZ part of Pery-2PTZ becomes planar, while the other unit is bent. In the case of Pery-2-PTZ, the two PTZ units with the perylene chromophore adopt an equally orthogonal conformation (90.0°), which is similar to the previously reported Pery-PTZ dyad (90.0°).35 It should be noted that the PTZ moiety has a bent conformation. Its UV-vis absorption spectra did not show a clear CT absorption band, although a weak CT band is present at the red end of the absorption spectrum.
 Fig. 11  Optimized molecular structures of Pery-2PTZ and Pery-2PXZ at the ground state (S0), singlet excited state (S1) and triplet excited state (T1), indicating the conformation of these molecules with respect to the donor moieties. The molecular geometric configurations of the PTZ and PXZ donors are also presented at the top. The calculation was performed using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G level. 
In the case of Pery-2PXZ, the dihedral angle between the two PXZ and the perylene moieties is 89.9° on both sides, and interestingly the PXZ moiety has a coplanar structure, which may induce larger electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor. Therefore, a significant CT absorption band is expected in its UV-vis absorption spectra. Also, this dihedral angle between PXZ and perylene is slightly larger than that in the Pery-PXZ dyad (85.5°).67
The frontier molecular orbitals of the triads were studied (Fig. S36, ESI†). In the case of Pery-2PTZ, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is exclusively localized on one PTZ moiety and HOMO−1 is localized on another PTZ part, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is confined to the perylene chromophore. The LUMO orbital of Pery-2PXZ is completely confined on the perylene moiety and the HOMO orbital localized on PXZ. Interestingly, the HOMO and HOMO−1 orbitals are confined on the two PXZ parts, and therefore the HOMO to LUMO is in the CT feature.
The electron spin density distribution of the T1 state and the radical anion and radical cation of the triads were studied (Fig. 12). For both triads, the triplet states are localized on the perylene moieties. Interestingly, in ACN, a slightly delocalized triplet spin density over the PXZ units was observed in Pery-2PXZ (Fig. S37, ESI†), which is consistent with the TTET results (low-lying triplet state is in partial 3CT feature in ACN). According to the spin density distribution of the radical cations and anions, in both triads, the hole is confined to one PTZ and PXZ unit, while the electron is localized on the perylene chromophore. Perylene acts as an electron acceptor and the PTZ/PXZ units act as electron donors in the triads. Interestingly, for Pery-2PTZ, the geometry of both PTZ units at triplet state and radical anion form of the triad is in bent conformation. While for the radical cation form, one PTZ unit changed to planar conformation. In the case of Pery-2PXZ, the geometry is planar in both radical cation and anion forms.

The DFT calculated UV-vis absorption spectra of the radical cations of the triads and dyads show the typical cation absorption features in the range of 500–900 nm, which is consistent with the chemical oxidation results (Fig. S38, ESI†).
The photophysical processes of Pery-2PTZ are summarized in Scheme 2. Upon photoexcitation of the perylene moiety, the 1LE state is populated, which undergoes ultrafast charge separation, i.e., 0.12 ps in n-HEX, 0.17 ps in DCM and 0.18 ps in ACN, to form the 1CT state. It should be noted that the CS process is faster than that for the previously reported dyads (CS, 0.25–0.49 ps).35 In highly polar solvents, the 1CT is non-emissive, leading to faster CR to the S0 state (in 0.39 ns) instead of the 3LE state. The charge recombination results in formation of the perylene localized triplet state in non-polar and middle polar solvents within 5.5 ns (n-HEX) and 1.0 ns (DCM), respectively. The CT state energy is high in n-HEX (3.47 eV), which decreases with an increase in the solvent polarity (1CT, 1.97 eV in ACN), consequently affecting the matching of the 1CT and Tn states, which leads to a decrease/increase in the SOCT-ISC efficiency. A similar energy diagram is proposed for Pery-2PXZ (Scheme S1, ESI†).
 Scheme 2  Simplified Jablonski diagram representing the photophysical processes involved in Pery-2PXZ upon direct photoexcitation of its perylene unit in DCM. The energy levels of the singlet excited states were derived from the spectroscopic data and the energy levels of the charge-separated states were obtained from the average of absorption and emission maxima and from the electrochemistry data. The energy levels of the triplet states were taken from TDDFT calculations. The numbers in superscript designate the spin multiplicity. 
Conclusion
In summary, we prepared perylene-based orthogonal triads by attaching two identical electron donor units of phenothiazine (PTZ) or phenoxazine (PXZ). Their photophysical properties were studied by steady-state and time-resolved transient spectroscopy and DFT calculations. We found that the intersystem crossing (ISC) is highly dependent on the solvent polarity and the ISC efficiency is maximum in medium polar solvents (singlet oxygen quantum yield ΦΔ = 17% in n-hexane, and ΦΔ = 70% in chloroform). The electrochemical study showed that the two electron donors in each triad are simultaneously oxidized in the cyclovoltammetry. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the radical cation of the triads showed that the electron spin–spin interaction between the two radical cations (PXZ˙+) is negligible. The femtosecond transient absorption study confirmed the symmetry-breaking charge transfer process, where charge separation occurred in 0.17 ps, followed by spin–orbit charge transfer ISC within 1.0 ns (in DCM), which is faster than that of the previously reported dyads (0.25–0.49 ps for CS and 0.99–5.98 ns for ISC). According to the nanosecond transient absorption spectra, an exceptionally long-lived triplet excited state was observed in different media (216–359 μs in DCM, 1.62–1.83 ms in glycerol triacetate, and 4.03–5.0 ms in doped polymer films), which is advantageous for various applications. In acetonitrile, with diiodo-BDP as the triplet energy donor and Pery-2PXZ triad as the acceptor, a long-lived low-lying CT state was formed. Solvent polarity-dependent P-type delayed fluorescence was observed for the triads (luminescence lifetime = 114 μs). We also used these triads for the generation of delayed fluorescence with SG-5 as an acceptor (τ = 94.8 μs). Thus, this study will be helpful for the design of heavy atom-free triplet photosensitizers.
Experimental section
General method
All chemicals were analytically pure. The solvents used in the synthesis were dry. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-2550 ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Ltd, Japan). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on an RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu Ltd, Japan). Fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) were measured using an absolute photoluminescence quantum yield spectrometer (Quantaurus-QY Plus C13534-11, Hamamatsu Photonics Ltd, Japan). Fluorescence lifetimes were measured on an OB920 luminescence lifetime spectrometer (in TCSPC detection mode, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd, UK) using the excitation source of a 445 nm EPL picosecond pulsed diode laser (max. pulse width is 95 ps). The instrument response function (IRF) of the luminescence lifetime spectrometer was 100 ps.
Synthesis of Pery-2PTZ
Under an N2 atmosphere, Pery-2Br (205.0 mg, 0.5 mmol) and phenothiazine (207.2 mg, 1.04 mmol) were mixed in dry toluene (15 mL). Then tri-tert-butylphosphine tetrafluoroborate (30.0 mg, 5 mol%) and Pd2(dba)3 (45.0 mg, 3 mol%) were added and the reaction mixture was purged with N2 for 15 min. Subsequently, sodium tert-butoxide (240.0 mg, 5 eq.) was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 120 °C for 10 h. On completion of the reaction, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified via column chromatography (silica gel, DCM/PE = 1:10, v/v) to give a dark-yellow solid (50 mg, yield: 15.4%). Mp: >250 °C. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ = 8.52 (s, 2H), 8.37 (dd, 2H, J1 = 8.0 Hz, J2 = 8.0 Hz), 8.04 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.70 (s, 2H), 7.57 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.09 (d, 4H, J = 4.0 Hz), 6.73 (s, 8H), 6.16 (s, 4H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 126 MHz): δ = 144.7, 144.1, 140.9, 138.8, 132.0, 130.9, 128.9, 128.1, 128.0, 127.2, 127.1, 127.0, 122.0, 121.9, 121.7, 121.6, 121.1, 120.8, 115.5, 113.5.

Synthesis of Pery-2PXZ
Under an N2 atmosphere, Pery-2Br (184.5 mg, 0.45 mmol) and phenoxazine (168.5 mg, 0.92 mmol) were mixed in dry toluene (15 mL). Then, tri-tert-butylphosphine tetrafluoroborate (27.0 mg, 5 mol%) and Pd2(dba)3 (40.5 mg, 3 mol%) were added and the reaction mixture was bubbled with N2 for 15 min. Subsequently, sodium tert-butoxide (240.0 mg, 5 eq.) was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 120 °C for 10 h. On completion of the reaction, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified with column chromatography (silica gel, DCM/PE = 1:10, v/v) to give a dark-orange solid (48 mg, yield: 18%). Mp: >250 °C. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ = 8.46 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz), 8.34 (dd, 2H, J1 = 8.0 Hz, J2 = 8.0 Hz), 8.01 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.65 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.56 (d, 2H, J = 4.0 Hz), 6.80 (d, 4H, J = 8.0 Hz), 6.68 (s, 4H), 6.59 (d, 4H, J = 8.0 Hz), 5.91 (d, 4H, J = 8.0 Hz). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 126 MHz): δ = 147.6, 144.0, 143.5, 131.9, 131.5, 130.5, 128.1, 128.0, 127.9, 126.8, 126.7, 123.8, 123.5, 122.0, 121.9, 121.7, 121.6, 121.1, 120.8, 115.5, 113.4. MALDI-HRMS: calcd ([C44H26N2O2]+), m/z = 614.1994; found, m/z = 614.1999.
Film preparation method
Clear Flex films were prepared by using transparent commercially available polyurethane precursors (Clear Flex 50®, CLRFLX). Clear Flex 50® (150 μL) and DCM (20 μL) were added to the Pery-2PTZ and Pery-2PXZ triads (30 μL, c = 2 × 10−3 M in DCM) and mixed adequately by stirring. The mixed solution (150 μL) was added dropwise onto a quartz plate (diameter of 17 mm and thickness of 1 mm) and the solvent allowed to evaporate, and the resulting film was left to dry for 24 h. We also prepared polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films via the following method: PMMA (50 mg) was dissolved in THF (2 mL). Then, the Pery-2PTZ and Pery-2PXZ triads (20 μL, c = 2 × 10−3 M) were added to PMMA solution (45 μL) and mixed well. 60 μL miscible liquid was cast on a quartz plate and allow to dry. All the films were prepared 24 h prior to the measurements.
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded on a CHI610D electrochemical workstation, Inc., Shanghai China, in N2-purged saturated DCM solution containing 0.10 M Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte, platinum as the counter electrode; glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode; and Ag/AgNO3 (0.1 M in ACN) couple as the reference electrode. DCM was used as the solvent and ferrocene was used as an internal reference.
Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy
A femtosecond Ti:sapphire regenerative amplified Ti:sapphire laser system (Coherent, Astrella-Tunable-F-1k) and femtosecond transient absorption spectrometer system (Ultrafast Systems, Helios Fire) were used for the fs-TA measurements. The amplifier pulse width of 800 nm was 84 fs and the repetition frequency was 1 kHz, and the output power of 800 nm from the amplifier was 7.4 W. The probe pulse was obtained by using approximately 4% of the amplified 800 nm output from the Astrella instrument to generate a white-light continuum (320–700 nm) using a CaF2 plate. Before passing through the sample, the probe beam was divided into two beams. One beam of detecting light passed through the sample, and the other was sent directly to a reference spectrometer, which monitored fluctuations in the detecting light intensity. The fiber optics was coupled to a multichannel spectrometer with a 1.5 nm intrinsic resolution CMOS sensor. The maximum time delay was 8 ns and the instrument response function (IRF) was about 120 fs. At each time delay, the data average was 2 seconds and collected by the acquisition system. In this study, the sample solution was excited by a 400 nm pump beam. The power irradiated to the sample during the test was 0.25 mW. The sample solutions were excited in a 2 mm path-length cuvette. The data was stored in a three-dimensional wave-time-absorbance matrix and exported for use with fitting software. Chirp correction was performed for all data shown here.
Nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) spectroscopy
Nanosecond transient absorption spectra were measured on an LP980 laser flash-photolysis spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, UK) and the transient signal was digitized with a Tektronix TDS 3012B oscilloscope. The samples were purged with N2 for 20 min before the measurement and excited with a nanosecond pulsed laser (OpoletteTM 355II + UV nanosecond pulsed laser, the wavelength was tunable in the range of 200–2200 nm. OPOTEK, USA). The intrinsic triplet-state lifetime was obtained by fitting the experimental decay traces taken at different concentrations, using a special kinetic model with the TTA effect considered.75,76
DFT calculations
All the geometries of the compounds were optimized using DFT with the B3LYP or CAMB3LYP functional and 6-31G(d) basis set. The excitation energy and energy gaps between the S0 state and excited triplet states of the compounds were approximated by time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP (6-31G(d) level based on the optimal ground-state geometry. The hyperfine coupling constants of the radical cations of the compounds were theoretically obtained using DFT with the B3LYP functional and 6-311G(d) EPR-II basis set.83 All the calculations were performed with Gaussian 09W.84
