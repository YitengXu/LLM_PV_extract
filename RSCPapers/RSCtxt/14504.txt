    , Accepted 29th January 2021First published on 8th February 2021AbstractThe bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blend plays an important role in determining the charge transport behavior and efficiency of organic solar cells. Side chain engineering has been recognized as one feasible way to tune BHJ networks. As a promising side chain species, the well-aligned alkyl chains could promote the ordered molecular assembly, but often induce inferior self-aggregated BHJ morphology ascribed to the overly strong crystallinity. Herein, we provide an isomerization strategy to modulate the crystallinity of an alkyl chain attached acceptor. The linear alkyl chain is isomerized to a branched structure with a bulky isopropyl terminal. As a consequence, the crystallinity of the acceptor is mildly reduced but the preferred molecular orientations, absorption and energy level properties are maintained. As for the as-cast devices, the isomerized iso-IDIC generates a better-developed BHJ morphology and a greater efficiency of 13.10% compared to the linear chain attached IDIC (12.37%). Impressively, the slightly decreased crystallinity of iso-IDIC reveals good tolerance to pre/post-treatments of the BHJ, with the thermal annealing delivering over 13.50% efficiency. However, the IDIC based devices produce negative response to the pre/post-treatments, ascribed to the seriously aggregated BHJ networks. Therefore, the BHJ should be carefully modulated and the isomerized side chain proposed here provides a promising approach to finely tune the acceptor crystallinity and the resulting morphology.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction structural organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) have received great attention owing to their low-weight, solution large-scale fabrication and good promise of flexibility.1–4 Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been increased to 18%, which has promoted the successive processes of nonfullerene acceptors since 2015.5,6 On the premise of matched donor/acceptor absorption spectra and energy level gradients, the BHJ active layer morphology plays another critical role in determining the exciton dissociation, charge transport as well as the recombination losses and final PCEs of solar cells.7–13 Therefore, controlling the morphological properties of BHJ would be highly desirable to realize the optimal efficiency of a specific solar cell system.
Given the component of the BHJ layer, it is reasonable that the basic properties of the donor and acceptor materials jointly afford the initial blend morphology, including the nanoscale interpenetrating networks and molecular packing orientations. These morphology-related properties of the materials may involve multiple factors for example the molecular planarity, polarity and dipoles, molecular orientations, etc. Moreover, most of these factors contribute to the macroscopic crystallinity or self-aggregation behavior. It has been intensively discovered that an overly strong self-aggregated donor or acceptor material is of high probability to generate large scale phase-separation and obvious domain boundaries.14–16 As a consequence, the inordinate single-component aggregated BHJ would largely increase the recombination losses and decrease the overall photovoltaic efficiency. Hence, rationally modulating the crystallinity of photovoltaic materials is of great importance to generate an appropriate BHJ morphology and satisfactory efficiency. As one representative nonfullerene reported in 2016, IDIC exhibits strong crystallinity and electron transport properties benefiting from its highly planar acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecular backbone, and receives much attention in the organic photovoltaic field.17,18 In addition to the preferred molecular backbone, the compact well-aligned n-hexyl alkyl side chains which are attached to the sp3 carbon of the backbone further enhance the ordered molecular assembly and crystallinity. Unfortunately, sometimes, this highly crystalline alkyl chain attached acceptor produced serious self-aggregated domains in the BHJ blends.14–16 On the contrary, as another representative nonfullerene reported in 2015, ITIC reveals relatively moderate crystallinity and self-aggregation compared to IDIC, attributed to the bulky aryl side groups (PhC6H13) attached on the IDTT backbone.19 This appropriate crystallinity or self-aggregation behavior endows fine networks in most ITIC based BHJs. However, the innate large steric hindrance from the bulky aryl side groups leads to decreased molecular packing ordering and electron mobility, enlarged π–π stacking distance, blue-shifted absorption spectra and lower extinction coefficient, compared to those of the alkyl-modified analogue with the same A–D–A backbone.20–22 Therefore, the well-aligned alkyl side chains should be a better candidate in fused-ring nonfullerenes. Disappointingly, restricted by the relatively tedious synthetic routes and strong self-aggregation of alkyl-modified acceptors particularly for the π-extended backbones, the alkyl side chains are usually at a disadvantage in the construction of high performance ladder-type acceptors compared to the aryl side chains.
To overcome this dilemma, some pioneering studies have been performed to regulate the self-aggregation behaviors of alkyl attached acceptors toward improved BHJ morphologies and solar cell efficiencies. For example, Bo's group was the first to combine the merits these two side groups and reported an asymmetric side chain modified IDT-OB, which demonstrated reduced crystallinity and developed morphology and higher PCEs compared to those of alkyl-modified IDT-2O.21 More importantly, IDT-OB exhibited better application in thick-film devices. One issue of IDT-OB that needs to be further improved is the somewhat excessive reduction of crystallinity, which caused ∼10 nm blue shifted film absorption. This may suggest that the preserved bulky aryl group is adverse to the crystallinity reservation ascribed to the steric effect and stereoisomers from the chiral sp3 carbon. Considering the mechanisms of both types of side groups, we developed an innovative strategy (alkyl chain with aryl terminal) in our previous study.22 First and foremost, to fulfill the advantages of the well-aligned alkyl side group, the n-alkyl chains are maintained and bonded to the molecular backbone. We then migrated the bulky phenyl groups to the terminal of the alkyl chains, which reduces the serious disturbance to the molecular backbones, but generates moderate steric hindrance between the phenyl terminals. As a result, the crystallinity of acceptor IDIC-C4Ph was reasonably reduced, while keeping absorption profiles similar to those of alkyl-attached IDIC. This modification contributes to a well-developed nanofiber interpenetrating BHJ network, giving rise to an impressive fill factor (FF) of over 78% and PCE over 14% in optimal devices, largely surpassing those of IDIC-based solar cells (12%). Furthermore, we also observed the effective modulation of complicated ternary BHJ morphologies and efficiencies, benefiting from the appropriate crystallinity or self-aggregation behavior of acceptors featured with an alkyl chain-phenyl terminal.23–25
Herein, based on the consideration of the terminal steric effect of the alkyl side chains, we provide a new approach to finely regulate the crystallinity of acceptors. The linear n-hexyl side chain is isomerized to branched 2-methylhexyl which contains a relatively bulky isopropyl terminal. The isopropyl terminals are expected to produce a similar peripheral steric hindrance with the phenyl terminals, and further mildly regulate the crystallinity of acceptors. The chemical structures of the linear alkyl side chain acceptor IDIC and the isomerized alkyl analog acceptor iso-IDIC are displayed in Fig. 1. The results show that this subtle modification produces slightly decreased crystallinity, but keeps the frontier energy levels and absorption profiles similar to IDIC. As a result, the self-aggregation of iso-IDIC is moderately suppressed, generating more fine networks under the as-cast state with increased photocurrent and PCE up to 13.10%. Furthermore, the moderate crystallinity of iso-IDIC affords ample room to further optimize the BHJ morphology through pre- or post-treatments, which are usually performed to strengthen the molecular assembly in the aggregation state. Both thermal annealing (TA) and additive treatments give rise to further enhanced overall PCEs with the optimum over 13.50%. In stark contrast, the highly crystalline IDIC affords an undeveloped as-cast BHJ with the best PCE of 12.37%. Unfortunately, both the TA and additive treatments induce large-scale self-aggregates in the BHJ, which increase the recombination loss and reduce the overall efficiencies. Therefore, the reasonable downshift of the acceptor crystallinity not only affords fine as-cast BHJ microstructures, but also offers good tolerance to pre-/post-treatments to further optimize the photovoltaic performance. This work highlights the importance of appropriate crystallinity of acceptors and provides a new feasible approach to finely regulate their crystallinity or self-aggregation behavior.

Results and discussion
The synthetic approach of iso-IDIC is similar to that of IDIC and is displayed in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The chemical structures of the intermediates and acceptor were characterized using 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. To preliminarily probe the influence of isomerized alkyl side chain on molecules, we conducted quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) for IDIC and iso-IDIC, and gained their molecular conformations, frontier energy levels, electronic static potential (ESP) and dipole moments. As displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the branched alkyl terminal produces negligible impact on the molecular conformation with highly planar molecular backbones similar to that of IDIC. Besides, the two molecules share the identical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (Fig. S2, ESI†). The two molecules reveal comparable ESP map and dipole moments around 0.18 Debye (Fig. 1a). All these observations suggest a minor impact of the isomerized alkyl side chains on the properties of single molecule state, which is understandable considering the difference located at the non-conjugated site. Thus, we then turn to the aggregate states of these two molecules. We firstly performed the 2D-grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) measurements on the neat films of both acceptors to study their crystallinity and molecular orientations. The 2D images and line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. 1b–d. Very similar diffraction patterns are discovered from the two samples with a prominent π–π diffraction peak located at 1.81 Å−1 (out-of-plane), corresponding to a close π–π stacking distance (dπ–π) of 3.47 Å. This characteristic face-on molecular orientation is of importance for OSCs with a vertical orientate charge transport behavior.26–29 However, we can still find some minor differences as for the crystallinity intensities. With a comparable film thickness, the π–π diffraction intensity of iso-IDIC is a little lower than that of IDIC. Given the comparable π–π crystal coherence length (CCL) of about 26 Å of the two peaks, the slightly lower intensity of iso-IDIC probably indicates less crystallites per unit of area than that of IDIC and corresponds to a slightly reduced crystallinity for iso-IDIC. Then, we carried out the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements for two acceptors to further distinguish the crystallinity differences and the curves are displayed in Fig. 1e. The DSC sample exhibits a sharp cold crystallization transition during the heating process at 175.6 °C with a high enthalpy change of −33.35 J g−1, suggesting a strong tendency to form highly ordered crystallites. In contrast, two broad exothermic processes with the peaks located at 149.7 °C and 223.9 °C are detected in the iso-IDIC sample. The extra exothermic process may suggest that there are multiple crystalline states and the flat crystalline peaks with extended and diffused half-widths represent a decreased crystalline process for the iso-IDIC sample. Therefore, we can discover consistent results from both GIWAXS and DSC measurements, that is, the isomerized alkyl side chains in iso-IDIC generate mildly reduced crystallinity than that of the linear alkyl modified IDIC. This decay of crystallinity behavior is probably induced by the increased steric hindrance among the branched chain terminals and the resulting disturbance of orderly molecular stacking in the aggregation state.
Then, we performed ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra measurements for these two acceptors in dilute solutions and thin films as revealed in Fig. 2a–d. IDIC and iso-IDIC demonstrate almost overlapped absorption profiles in both the solutions and films, signifying comparable intermolecular interactions for the two acceptors. Besides, the two acceptors IDIC and iso-IDIC possess comparable maximum extinction coefficients of (1.45 ± 0.08) × 105 cm−1 and (1.48 ± 0.11) × 105 cm−1, respectively. The high extinction coefficients of the two acceptors are beneficial for the BHJ to harvest more solar photons. We then conducted the temperature dependent absorption spectra for the two solutions in chlorobenzene with temperature varying from 20 °C to 100 °C. Again, the two acceptors in solutions exhibit very similar tendencies and the insensitive evolutions suggest the decent intermolecular interactions for both molecules. Thus the isomerization of alkyl side chains did not significantly change the intermolecular interactions, which is consistent with the minor differences of crystallinity for two acceptors as discussed above. The frontier energy levels are evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and are displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The HOMO/LUMO levels of IDIC and iso-IDIC are calculated to be −5.83 eV/−3.87 eV and −5.84 eV/−3.84 eV, respectively, indicating negligible difference as also observed from the DFT calculations. Besides, both the acceptors afford rational level gradients with the donor PM6, as displayed in Fig. 2e, and could generate sufficient driving force for the photo-exciton dissociation inside the BHJ.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the two acceptors, we fabricated OSC devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:Acceptor/PDINO/Al. Here, the classical polymer PM6 was utilized as the donor and the chemical structure is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Chlorobenzene (CB) was used as the processing solvent. The best weight ratio for PM6:IDIC based devices is 1:1 according to previous report. Likewise, the optimal weight ratio for PM6:iso-IDIC based devices was confirmed to be 1:1 (Table S1, ESI†) and the optimal photovoltaic properties and J–V curves are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3a, respectively. As displayed in Table 1, the PM6:IDIC as-cast devices deliver the best PCE of 12.37% with a VOC of 0.963 V, a JSC of 17.94 mA cm−2 and an FF of 71.60%. This optimal efficiency is in line with and even slightly higher than the previous reports, probably related to the different batches of PM6.22,30,31 In comparison, the PM6:iso-IDIC based as-cast devices achieved a greater PCE up to 13.10% with the same VOC of 0.963 V, but enhanced JSC of 18.55 mA cm−2 and FF of 73.26%. The increase of JSC and FF is probably contributed to the better charge transport/collection behavior inside the devices. Moreover, the higher extinction coefficient of iso-IDIC should be another contributor for the increase in photocurrent. To further optimize the efficiency of solar cells, we performed the pre-treatment using an additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) and post-treatment of thermal annealing (TA) for the two BHJs. The TA process is widely utilized to enhance the intermolecular π–π stacking of the donor or/and acceptor materials.32–34 The additive in the blending solution is well recognized to slow the drying process during spin-coating; morphological reorganization could take place during the timescale of additive evaporation, enhancing the self-organization of donor/acceptor molecules.35,36 However, we found an overall decrease of photovoltaic parameters in a TA treated PM6:IDIC solar cell. The reason for this is probably that the TA process usually drives the BHJ system toward the most thermodynamically stable state, which may not be the optimal condition for photovoltaic performance due to the specific material properties. Disappointingly, the DIO process leads to further reduction of photovoltaic performance. Therefore, both the TA and DIO processes generate negative impact on device performance and should be directly correlated with the degeneration of the BHJ microstructures. Different from these, we discovered a simultaneous increase in JSC and FF for iso-IDIC based devices after TA optimization, with a nearly undisturbed VOC relative to its as-cast state. As a result, the TA processed PM6:iso-IDIC achieves increased performance with the best PCE up to 13.53%. The DIO process further mildly increased the FF over 75%, with the optimal PCE reaching 13.21% despite the large downshift of VOC. Hence, we can find that the IDIC and iso-IDIC based OSCs exhibit a reverse response to TA or DIO optimization, and iso-IDIC based devices possess better tolerance to pre-/post-treatments, contributing to more desired efficiencies.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out to probe the origin of JSC evolutions without or with treatments and the corresponding curves are revealed in Fig. 3b. Firstly the JEQESC values integrated from EQE are confirmed with a small deviation around 5% (Table 1). Subsequently, the two as-cast devices demonstrate similar EQE profiles with iso-IDIC based OSC keeping a higher response between 450 and 750 nm, well consistent with the greater JSC than that of its IDIC counterpart. The TA optimization of the PM6:IDIC device leads to a slightly red-shifted spectrum with increased response between 600 and 800 nm, but serious drops between 300–410 nm and 465–590 nm, collectively causing the decrease of photo-response and JSC of solar cells. The additive process further enhances the response between 700 and 800 nm, but forms a vast valley between 480 and 700 nm, resulting in a further reduction in JSC and efficiency. As for PM6:iso-IDIC device, despite the response decrease between 460 and 570 nm after the TA process, the promotion between 570 and 730 nm covers this deficiency and causes a mild increase in JSC. The DIO optimization of PM6:iso-IDIC device contributes to a similar profile with the TA treated device, but with a red-shift (onset) by about 15 nm. Even then, the increase and decrease offsets in response jointly generate comparable JSC values in both TA and DIO treated OSCs. To further understand the shifts of EQE spectra, we measured the corresponding absorption properties of the BHJ blends as displayed in Fig. 3c and d. As indicated in Fig. 3c, identical variation tendencies are observed from these BHJ absorption spectra in the long wavelength greater than 700 nm. Notably, the DIO optimized PM6:iso-IDIC BHJ affords a similar red-shift of its EQE spectrum, compared to the as-cast and TA processed samples. Moreover, we can discover a sharp raised absorption peak located at 725 nm in the DIO processed PM6:iso-IDIC film, which should be contributed by the enhanced ordering of iso-IDIC molecules after optimization. The extinction coefficient spectra of these BHJs exhibit analogous variation curves. The extinction coefficient at 725 nm in the PM6:iso-IDIC spectrum is significantly enhanced. In comparison, the extinction coefficient values of the PM6:IDIC sample are somewhat reduced after the TA and DIO treatments.
To clarify the influence of the acceptor crystallinity on charge transport behavior inside OSCs, we measured the hole (μh) and electron (μe) charge mobilities in the two devices under varied treatments using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model.37 The SCLC curves are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and the corresponding data are collated in Table 2. It is evident from the two as-cast devices, that PM6:iso-IDIC produces concurrently higher μh and μe over 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with preferred balance compared to PM6: IDIC, which could reduce the space charge accumulation and promote the photocurrent generation, thus providing improved JSC and FF in the resultant devices. Despite the rise of μh after the TA or DIO processed PM6:iso-IDIC, the unmanageable even dropped μe around 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 lead to unbalanced charge transport with the μh/μe values exceeding 1.80, which may aggravate the space charge accumulation and increase the recombination loss. With regard to PM6:iso-IDIC, the TA optimization slightly altered the charge mobilities. Encouragingly, both the μh and μe are obviously enhanced while maintaining a small μh/μe value of 1.16, indicative of an improved charge transport behavior.

Next, the charge generation and exciton dissociation behaviors are studied by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) characteristics with the corresponding plots shown in Fig. 4a. The charge dissociation probability Pdiss which is a function of electric field E and temperature T, was calculated based on the Jph under short-circuit current state and the saturated photocurrent at a high reverse bias over 2V.38 The Pdiss data of the two devices under different treatments are displayed in Table 2. It is obvious that both the TA and DIO processes negatively influence the solar cells of PM6:IDIC with a successive drop of the Pdiss after the employment of TA and DIO. In contrast, the PM6:iso-IDIC based devices offer increased Pdiss values after pre- and post-treatments with the DIO optimized device reaching a high Pdiss of 98.7%, suggesting an enhanced efficiency of exciton dissociation inside the well-developed BHJ. In addition, the recombination loss inside the BHJ blend plays another role in determining the photovoltaic efficiencies as well. Therefore we investigated JSCversus light intensity (Plight) and the plots are displayed in Fig. 4b to study the recombination kinetics inside the solar cells. Generally, the JSC and light intensity follow the equation of JSC ∝ Pslight, where s close to 1 signifies insignificant bimolecular recombination behavior.39 As suggested in Fig. 4b and Table 2, increased bimolecular recombination emerges for the PM6:IDIC device after treatments, with the DOI process giving a small s of 0.94. In contrast, all the devices of PM6:iso-IDIC provide high s values of 0.98 and 0.99, preferred by the solar cells to generate decent JSC.

We then performed the transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements to probe the charge carrier dynamics inside the OSCs. The TPC and TPV curves and the corresponding data are shown in Fig. 4c, d and Table 2, respectively. The charge extraction times (τext) are obtained by fitting the TPC decays under short-circuit conditions.40 It is evident that the PM6:IDIC devices deliver prolonged τext values particularly in the DIO processed OSC (11.16 μs). However, the τext values are gradually shortened after the optimization of TA and DIO, as for PM6:iso-IDIC based OSCs. The shorter τext values in the PM6:iso-IDIC devices signify improved charge sweep-out efficiencies and faster charge extraction behaviors. The TPV measurements were implemented under open-circuit conditions. The carrier lifetimes can be obtained by fitting the TPV decays and reflect the recombination time of photocarriers (τrec) inside the photovoltaic devices.41 As indicated in Fig. 4d and Table 2, we can discover that the τrec values are reduced in the PM6:IDIC devices after treatments, and the DIO processed cell generates a smaller τrec of 35.02 μs than that of the as-cast device (40.26 μs). With the acceleration of the recombination of photocarriers, the photocurrent of OSCs could be increasingly damped by the recombination current loss. On the contrary, all the PM6:iso-IDIC solar cells without and with treatments afford higher τrec values, suggesting the effectively suppressed charge recombination. Consequently, the relatively superior charge generation, exciton, transport, extraction and recombination physical processes that occurred inside the PM6:iso-IDIC solar cells are helpful to generate a satisfactory photovoltaic performance. In comparison, these ineffective processes in the PM6:IDIC devices are negative to the solar cell and probably induced by the deteriorated BHJ microstructures.
As discussed above, the BHJ microstructures play a critical role in determining the charge related physical processes inside the OSCs; therefore it is of importance to better understand their BHJ properties. The BHJ microstructures are usually involved in specific molecular stacking and orientations, and the nanoscale networks with appropriate phase-separation behaviors. Hence to probe the molecular orientations of two BHJ blends and their variations under treatments, we carried out the GIWAXS measurements on the BHJ blends of PM6:IDIC and PM6:iso-IDIC and the results are displayed in Fig. 5. In addition, the GIWAXS pattern of the donor PM6 (Fig. S6, ESI†) shows a face-on dominated orientation with a π–π diffraction at Qz = 1.74 Å−1 and laminar diffraction located at ∼0.30 Å−1 in both the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions. Despite the slightly stronger face-on stacking of the acceptor IDIC than that of iso-IDIC (Fig. 1), the PM6:iso-IDIC blend instead of PM6:IDIC produces a mildly enhanced face-on orientation at the same Qz = 1.80 Å−1 with similar CCL around 18 Å under their as-cast state. This may be one contributor to the more preferred charge transport and photovoltaic efficiencies of iso-IDIC based as-cast devices. After the TA process, the π–π diffraction plot of PM6:IDIC is largely enhanced, with the formation of orderly laminar stacking between Qz = 0.30–0.80 Å−1. The enhanced peak of Qz = 0.30 Å−1 and the emerging new peak of Qz = 0.61 Å−1 are attributed to the ordered laminar stacking of the PM6 chains. The new peak of Qz = 0.54 Å−1 is probably originated from the increased n-alkyl side chain packing of IDIC. In addition, the derivation of the broad and complex diffraction peak located at about Qz = 0.77 Å−1 is yet to be confirmed. Nevertheless, these observations strongly suggest the significantly improved molecular packing and crystallinity of both the donor PM6 and acceptor IDIC in their blend, which should be advantageous for OSCs to achieve a better charge transport behavior in the premise of satisfactory BHJ nanoscale networks. With the DIO treatment, the π–π diffraction in the OOP direction is maintained. However, the laminar stacking of PM6 is reduced with the reduction of the (100) diffraction peak at Qz = 0.30 Å−1, and the disappearance of the (200) diffraction peak at Qz = 0.61 Å−1. These variations indicate that the ordered laminar stacking of PM6 is disturbed by the addition of DIO, which is probably one reason for the vast valley in the EQE profile between 550 and 650 nm (where PM6 covers, see Fig. S7, ESI†).
 Fig. 5  The 2D-GIWAXS images of (a–c) PM6:IDIC blends and (d–f) PM6:iso-IDIC blends under different treatments; and (g and h) the corresponding line-cut profiles. 
As for the BHJ blend of PM6:iso-IDIC, we can find a slight enhancement of the π–π diffraction plot in the OOP direction with the identical Qz value of 1.80 Å−1 and similar CCL around 22.52 Å after the thermal annealing of BHJ. In addition, an obvious increase in the laminar stacking in the IP direction at Qxy = 0.29 Å−1 from PM6 with CCL increased from 114.12Å to 134.25 Å indicate the promoted molecular stacking of the donor. Marked positive changes are detected with the treatment of DIO to the PM6:iso-IDIC blend. Firstly, the π–π diffraction in the OOP direction was greatly enhanced with an obvious shift from Qz = 1.80 Å−1 to Qz = 1.89 Å−1, corresponding to the much closer dπ–π from 3.49 Å to 3.32 Å. Besides, the laminar stacking in both the OOP and IP directions are concurrently improved. The laminar stacking of iso-IDIC in the OOP direction was increased at Qz = 0.56 Å−1. Notably, compared to the as-cast sample, the laminar stacking of iso-IDIC in the IP direction was markedly strengthened with CCL increased from 133.68 Å to 190.40 Å and an apparent shift from Qxy = 0.39 Å−1 to Qxy = 0.44 Å−1 (the dlaminar was shortened from 16.11 Å to 14.28 Å) in the DIO optimized BHJ. Therefore, these improvements indicate the advantageous better-developed molecular stacking and orientations, which should facilitate the charge transport behaviors based on reasonable BHJ networks.
To probe the BHJ nanoscale morphology of PM6:IDIC and PM6:iso-IDIC blends under different treatments, we employed the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. From the as-cast BHJ blends as displayed in Fig. 6a and d, we can discover the vermiform phase-separation inside PM6:IDIC, while clear phase-separation with fine fibrous networks are detected in PM6:iso-IDIC. The fibrous BHJ morphology is expected to facilitate the charge transport ability and promote the photovoltaic performance according to previous studies.42,43 The more preferred as-cast BHJ morphology of PM6:iso-IDIC should be contributed by the rationally reduced crystallinity and the self-aggregation of acceptor iso-IDIC, affording a better miscibility with the polymeric donor. Distinguishing surface morphologies can be detected from the AFM images as well. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), fine intertwined fiber arrays take shape on the surface of the PM6:iso-IDIC blend, and are well consistent with the results of the TEM studies. There are also obvious distinctions between the two BHJs after TA treatment as displayed in Fig. 6b and e. Despite the formation of a more clear phase-separation, thickly dotted regular aggregates were found in the TA processed PM6:IDIC blend. These aggregates should be ascribed to the strong self-aggregation behavior of the highly crystalline acceptor IDIC. In comparison, much less and smaller similar aggregates exist in the TA treated PM6:iso-IDIC blend, owing to the mildly weakened crystallinity of the acceptor iso-IDIC. With regard to the DIO processed BHJ, PM6:IDIC gives rise to fibrous phase-separation, which would promote charge transport. However, the self-aggregates observed in the TA treated sample greatly assembled, resulting in large scale aggregates between 200 and 400 nm. The similar large aggregates are detected from the surface morphology as well, as suggested in the AFM image shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Furthermore, the large aggregates may be correlated to the decreased intermolecular interactions between PM6 and IDIC after the addition of DIO. Notably, this weakened interaction should be mainly attributed to the boosted crystallinity of IDIC instead of PM6, given the marked red-shift by over 50 nm of the absorption profiles after DIO addition (Fig. S10, ESI†). Obviously, these dense regular aggregates in TA treated BHJ and large scale aggregated domains in DIO treated PM6:IDIC would remarkably decrease the exciton dissociation and transport efficiency, and increase the recombination losses inside the BHJ, despite the decent molecular orientations observed from the GIWAXS studies. Excitingly, the DIO process further optimized the phase-separation behavior of the PM6:iso-IDIC blend, with the reservation of well-distributed fibrous networks and sweep out of the self-aggregates. Therefore, the mildly reduced acceptor crystallinity via the isomerization of alkyl side chain not only alters the intrinsic BHJ morphology, but also affords more room to further optimize the BHJ morphology and photovoltaic performance.

However, we can note that there are still some disadvantages for the acceptor iso-IDIC with isomerized alkyl side chains, the molecular assembly in BHJ particularly the preferred face-on orientation remains to be further enhanced. The BHJ morphology remains dissatisfactory particularly for the TA processed blend with some self-aggregates. These microscopic defects in BHJ microstructures lead to imperfect charge carrier behavior and unimpressive FFs around 75% and overall photovoltaic performance. Therefore, to further improve the BHJ quality and efficiency of solar cells, the crystallinity of the acceptor should be modulated more finely, and this isomerization strategy of the alkyl side chain provides a feasible approach. Specifically for this work, the results indicate that the crystallinity and self-aggregation properties seem to be retained strongly and require to be further reduced reasonably. By way of replacing the isopropyl with a more bulky tertiary butyl terminal, or extending the linear alkyl chains between the molecular backbone and the bulky terminal, we think the crystallinity of the acceptor could be further suppressed and may generate a more satisfactory BHJ microstructure with greater FFs and PCEs.
Conclusions
To conclude, we report a feasible approach to rationally modulate the crystallinity of an alkyl side chain attached acceptor. By way of isomerizing the linear n-alkyl chain to an isopropyl terminated branched chain, the crystallinity and self-aggregation behavior are modestly weakened, while keeping the nearly undisturbed absorption profiles and frontier energy levels. As a consequence, the new acceptor iso-IDIC generates more preferred miscibility with the donor and better developed BHJ morphologies. These advantages contribute to an impressive PCE up to 13.10% in the as-cast devices, and the thermal annealed solar cells generate an optimal PCE over 13.50%. Furthermore, the DIO additive pre-treatment of the PM6:iso-IDIC solution further optimized the molecular orientations and BHJ morphology, endowing the solar cells with an FF over 75% and a PCE of 13.21%, despite the obvious drop of VOC. In stark comparison, the strong self-aggregated alkyl chain attached IDIC leads to the inferior phase-separation from the PM6:IDIC as-cast blend, responsible for its lower PCE of 12.37% than that of the PM6:iso-IDIC counterpart. Besides, the strong self-aggregation properties of IDIC make it difficult to further optimize the BHJ morphology and photovoltaic performance through traditional thermal annealing and DIO treatments, ascribed to the aggregated phase-separation in processed BHJ. Therefore, we present a promising isomerization strategy to fine tune the crystallinity and photovoltaic performance of alkyl chain attached acceptors. Through the refined side chain structures and crystallinity, we expect further increased efficiency of organic solar cells.
