    , Accepted 1st March 2018First published on 5th March 2018AbstractIn this paper, a direct chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach is applied for the first time to synthesize high quality copper oxide (CuO), copper tungstate (CuWO4) and tungsten oxide (WO3) on F:SnO2 (FTO) substrates for photocatalytic water splitting. Variation of process parameters enables us to tune the stoichiometry of the deposits to obtain stoichiometric, W-rich, and Cu-rich deposits. It is found that the presence of Cu in WO3 thin films reduces the bandgap and enhances the absorption properties of the material in the visible range. The photoelectrocatalytic performance of stoichiometric CuWO4 was found to be superior to that of WO3 oxide under frontside illumination when thin films were used. However, detailed photoelectrochemical investigations of both thin and thicker CuWO4 films reveal that the incorporation of copper also decreases the mobility of both electrons and holes, the latter being the performance-limiting factor. These results are in line with our first-principles calculations of the electronic structure of CuWO4. A charge carrier mobility and diffusion length of ∼6× 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 30 nm were determined by time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements, values comparable to those of undoped bismuth vanadate (BiVO4). Our findings establish new insights into the advantages and limits of CuWO4-based photoanodes, and suggest a possibility of using very thin CuWO4 films on top of highly absorbing semiconductors with optimal electronic properties.
Introduction
Low cost and non-toxic semiconducting metal oxides are attractive candidates for application as catalyst materials in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for the production of hydrogen from water. Binary oxides fulfilling these criteria, such as Fe2O3, TiO2 and WO3, have been extensively studied as photoanode materials.1–4 These materials are stable in aqueous solutions over a broad pH range and are cheap, however, they suffer from disadvantageous photoelectrochemical (band edges at too positive positions vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and electronic properties (low conductivity, and the high recombination rate of charge carriers) which are crucial parameters for the efficiency in PEC applications.2,5 As a consequence, the focus of research has recently turned from binary oxides to ternary oxides as they offer a broader possibility for the variation of composition. In turn, more options to tune the material's optical, electronic and catalytic properties arise. For example, very promising photoelectrocatalytic conversion efficiencies have been obtained with very compact and crystalline films of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4).6,7 These findings prompted the search for other ternary oxide materials and especially CuWO4 with an even lower bandgap (ca. 2.3 eV) than BiVO4 (2.4–2.5 eV) and excellent stability in aqueous electrolytes seems promising.8,9 Notably, Gao and Hamann have recently shown that the catalytic activity of the CuWO4 surface towards water oxidation is very good, practically allowing for quantitative hole collection at larger bias potentials (>1.23 V vs. RHE).10 However, a major factor limiting the performance of CuWO4 photoanodes is their poor charge separation efficiency, leading to enhanced recombination especially at lower bias potentials. As reasons for this, both the bulk (short charge carrier diffusion length) and surface (intrinsic11 and extrinsic12 surface states) electronic properties of CuWO4 have been discussed.13–15 In general, the photoelectrocatalytic performance of photoanodes depends strongly on the fabrication method. For CuWO4 photoanodes, so far mostly sol–gel8,11 and electrochemical13,16 methods have been applied. In addition, very recently CuWO4 thin films were deposited using a two-step atomic layer deposition technique via deposition of copper oxide on tungsten oxide and post deposition annealing.17
In terms of thin film synthesis, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a highly promising technique for the preparation of materials with well-defined composition, morphology, and crystallinity. Its capability to conformally deposit over large areas in high quality at low cost makes this process very appealing for the synthesis of photoanode materials. It is intriguing that, to the best of our knowledge, CVD processes for CuWO4 have not been reported yet. Among the photocatalytically active ternary oxides listed by Marschall,18 only bismuth and zinc ferrite and bismuth vanadate have been grown via liquid injection CVD or conventional CVD and tested in photoelectrochemical water splitting.19–27 The reason why reports on ternary oxides grown by CVD are very rare is the challenge to identify precursor molecules of the respective metals with matching thermal properties in terms of evaporation and decomposition. Equally difficult are the identification and synthesis of molecules containing both metals while being volatile. However, CVD processes are dependent on various parameters, which in turn can be tuned to allow the synthesis of more complex deposits, if the precursors have been chosen rationally.
Herein we present the first synthesis of copper tungsten oxides via CVD based on the precursors bis(ethylacetoacetate) copper, [Cu(etaoac)2],28 and bis(tertbutyl imido) bis(diisopropylamidinato) tungsten, [W(NtBu)2(dpamd)2].29 By variation of the process parameters, deposits with different copper to tungsten ratios are synthesized, which enabled us to study the distinct influence of stoichiometry on the optical and photoelectrochemical properties. In addition, a detailed analysis of photocurrent measurements is performed to identify the performance bottlenecks in light-driven water splitting, first-principles DFT calculations of the electronic structure of CuWO4 are presented, and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements are applied to a stoichiometric CuWO4 deposit to obtain the photocarrier lifetime, mobility, and diffusion length. Based on these results, fundamental enhancements and limits associated with the use of CuWO4-based materials in solar water splitting are elucidated and discussed.
Experimental
The thermal properties of [Cu(etaoac)2] and [W(NtBu)2(dpamd)2] were determined by thermogravimetry experiments. Therefore, simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) was carried out by using a Seiko TG/DTA 6200/SII at ambient pressure (sample size ≈ 10 mg), with a heating rate of 5 K min−1 (N2 flow rate = 300 mL min−1) in a temperature range of 30–550 °C. In order to estimate the evaporation rate, isothermal experiments at 130 °C were carried out with a duration of 180 minutes.
The work in this manuscript includes the chemical vapor deposition of CuWO4 thin films on 1 × 1 cm2 Si(100) (Siegert Consulting) or on FTO coated 1.5 × 2.5 cm2 Pilkington TEC Glass (Xop glass, sheet resistance 12–14 Ω □−1) in a custom built, horizontal cold-wall, low pressure MOCVD reactor. Each substrate was cleaned directly before CVD by a sequence of rinsing with 2-propanol, and 10 minutes sonication in water in order to remove surface contaminants. A general cleaning procedure for the as-received conducting FTO-glass substrates involved degreasing by sonication in acetone and boiling NaOH (0.1 M), rinsing with deionized water and acetone, and drying in air. The precursors [Cu(etaoac)2]28 and [W(NtBu)2(dpamd)2]29 were synthesized as reported in the literature and purified via sublimation (Schemes S1 and S2†). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was measured, to confirm the spectroscopic purity of [W(NtBu)2(dpamd)2]. The high purity of paramagnetic [Cu(etaoac)2] was confirmed by elemental analysis. The precursors were vaporized at 110 °C in separated external precursor reservoirs and delivered to the substrate by individually controlled nitrogen gas flows whereby the lines between the precursor reservoirs and the substrate were heated to 130 °C. Prior to every deposition the parameters were allowed to settle for 30 minutes. After deposition for 60 minutes at 1 mbar the carrier gas flow was switched off and the bubblers were closed. The samples were kept at deposition temperature under flowing oxygen for another 30 minutes before substrate heating was switched off and the substrates were cooled under flowing oxygen before taking out of the reactor. In order to tune the material composition with respect to the copper and tungsten content, six different deposition procedures were applied (see ESI†).
The crystallinity of tungsten and copper containing oxide thin films was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the Bragg–Brentano geometry on a Bruker D8 Advanced Diffractometer [Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å)] with a position sensitive detector. The surface morphology and surface coverage of the deposits were investigated using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM, FEI ESEM Dual Beam™ Quanta 3D FEG).
Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) was used as a standard measurement for the determination of elemental concentrations of the heavy elements Cu and W. A 2.0 MeV 4He+ beam (intensity = 20–40 nA) was applied for films grown on Si(100) at RUBION, the Central Unit for Ions Beams and Radionuclides at the Ruhr-University Bochum. The backscattered particles were measured at an angle of 160° using a Si detector with a resolution of 16 keV. Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) measurements allow the detection of the light elements nitrogen, carbon and oxygen via deuteron beam (1 MeV) induced nuclear reactions. Protons emitted by nuclear reactions with light elements were detected at an angle of 135° with respect to the beam axis. The detector covered a solid angle of 23 msrad, and was shielded by a 6 μm Ni-foil to eliminate elastically scattered deuterons. Typical beam currents are close to 40 nA in an area of ∼1 mm in diameter, while the collected beam charge for a sample was 12 μC. Using the SimNRA program the elemental concentrations were simulated combining values from RBS and NRA.30
Ultraviolet-visible (UV/vis) spectroscopy measurements of the samples deposited on ITO were performed using an Agilent Cary 5000 double beam spectrophotometer. Tauc plots based on the UV/vis data were used to determine the optical bandgap.31
Raman spectra were collected in air and at room temperature with a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm with an output power of 5.0 mW on an inVia Raman system (Renishaw, Wotton-under-Edge, UK) encompassing a Leica DM 2500 microscope using an objective with 50× magnification (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Spectra were recorded with a 2400 grooves per mm grating in an air-cooled charge coupled device (CCD) detector. The system was calibrated using a silicon wafer reference prior to measurements.
The photoelectrochemical setup consisted of an SP-300 BioLogic potentiostat (Claix, France) and a three-electrode cell using a platinum counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) reference electrode. All potential values were recalculated and were reported with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). For photocurrent measurements the photoelectrodes were pressed against an O-ring of the cell leaving an irradiated area of 0.5 cm2. The electrodes were irradiated from the back (through the FTO glass) or from the front side. For monochromatic wavelength-resolved measurements of incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCE) a tunable monochromatic light source (Instytut Fotonowy, http://www.fotonowy.pl) was used provided with a 150 W Xenon lamp and a grating monochromator with a bandwidth of ∼10 nm. Appropriate cutoff filters were used in order to eliminate second-order diffraction radiation. Measurements of photocurrent onsets were carried out under solar simulated irradiation (1 sun) using a 150 W Xenon lamp (LOT Oriel) equipped with an AM1.5G and a KG-3 (Schott) heat-absorbing filter. As the electrolyte, a 0.1 M sodium borate solution (pH 7) was used. Water used in the experiments was of ultrapure quality (18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C and TOC = 1 ppb). For the IPCE determination the average values out of measurements on three different electrodes were calculated for each sample. The value of photocurrent density was taken as a difference between current density under irradiation and in the dark. The IPCE value for each wavelength was calculated according to eqn (1), (1)where iph is the photocurrent density, h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, P is the light power density, λ is the irradiation wavelength, and q is the elementary charge. The spectral dependence of lamp power density was measured using a NOVA II optical power meter equipped with a PD300-UV silicon photodiode (Ophir Optronics).
For the TRMC measurements, the sample was mounted in a rectangular microwave cavity resonator similar to setups described elsewhere.32,33 X-band microwaves are generated and reflected off the cavity containing the sample which is excited by the 7 ns (FWHM) pulses of the frequency-tripled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at a wavelength of 355 nm with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The change in microwave power reflected off the cavity was monitored and correlated with the sum of the electron and hole mobilities through the resonance of the cavity and dielectric properties of the sample (where the εr of CuWO4 is taken to be 20).34
Computational details
The VASP simulation package was used for all spin-polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.35,36 We chose the Local Density Approximation (LDA)37 exchange-correlation (XC) functional with the DFT+U formalism of Dudarev et al.38 because it better describes the strongly correlated electrons of the Cu transition metal in oxide materials.39–42 The typical ab initio-derived values for transition metals are around U–J = 4 eV (ref. 43) and this is also the value commonly used for Cu.44 Furthermore, LDA+U showed better agreement with obtaining the geometry than PBE+U.16 The HSE functional with 16% exchange was then employed for calculating the density of states, giving a bandgap value closer to that found in the experiment. Nuclei and core electrons were described by PAW potentials45,46 such that only the 6, 17, and 12 valence electrons of O-2s22p4, Cu-3p63d104s1, and W-5p65d46s2, respectively, were considered explicitly.
The unit cell for CuWO4 contained 24 atoms with the correct antiferromagnetic ground state order.44,47 Several computational settings were used to achieve convergence. An energy cutoff of 700 eV and a 3 × 4 × 5 gamma-centered k-space grid converged the total energy to 1 meV. Ion positions were relaxed using the conjugated gradient method and the stopping criterion for the ionic relaxation was chosen for all forces to be smaller than 3 × 10−2 eV Å−1. No symmetry was imposed. Ionic relaxation was done with the tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections. The optimized geometry is provided in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Material characterisation
In our previous work, we have identified [Cu(etaoac)2] and [W(NtBu)2(dpamd)2] as precursors for the deposition of metallic copper and tungsten nitrides or tungsten oxynitride thin films, respectively.48–50 The thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 1) indicates, however, quite different thermal properties of the two precursors. An onset of volatilization (1% mass loss) of 148 °C and 180 °C was determined for the copper and tungsten precursors, respectively. In addition, for [Cu(etaoac)2], partial decomposition of the precursor at around 190 °C is observed, whereas [W(NtBu)2(dpamd)2] vaporizes completely without decomposition as indicated by the very low residual mass of nearly 0%.
 Fig. 1  TG analysis of [Cu(etaoac)2] and [W(NtBu)2(dpamd)2] under constant N2 flow and isothermal TGs of both compounds at 130 °C (inset). 
As expected from the substantially different onsets of volatilization, the isothermal TGs (Fig. 1 inset) recorded at 130 °C reveal 2% and 7.8% mass loss within 180 minutes for [W(NtBu)2(dpamd)2] and [Cu(etaoac)2], respectively. For the synthesis of CuWO4 these mass transport differences have to be addressed by parameter variation (see ESI, Table S1†). Table 1 summarizes the copper to tungsten ratios obtained after the final process optimization.

The thin film materials with varying copper and tungsten concentrations were analyzed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify the structure of the deposits and to analyze the presence of potential phase mixtures.
The XRD patterns of the thin films using conditions I–VI are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1–S5†). Besides the binary oxide materials copper oxide (condition I) and tungsten oxide (condition VI), the films deposited with conditions II–V all show the expected characteristic diffractions at 15.3° and 19° corresponding to the (010) and (100) orientation of CuWO4. In more detail, the diffraction patterns of CuWO4 thin films synthesized at 500–700 °C according to conditions III and IV are displayed in Fig. 2a and b. The deposits obtained using condition III are amorphous at 500 °C, while at elevated temperatures the diffraction patterns fit very well with the reference pattern. While following the procedure described by condition IV, the onset of crystallization was shifted to 500 °C and the diffraction patterns of the thin films synthesized at 500 °C and 600 °C fit well with the reference pattern. For the highest deposition temperature, however, a preferred orientation in the (100) direction was detected; indicated by reflections at 19.0° (100) and 38.7° (200). Furthermore, an intense reflection is observed at 37° corresponding to the (002) orientation. Irrespective of the conditions, post deposition annealing for 60 minutes at 750 °C significantly affected the crystallinity of thin films deposited at 500 °C and 600 °C (Fig. S4†). Although post deposition annealing at 750 °C transformed all deposits to crystalline CuWO4, temperatures above 600 °C are not suitable for the FTO/glass substrates and are therefore not applicable for the production of photoanodes. However, independent of the set of conditions employed, crystalline deposits were obtained at 600 °C (Fig. S5 and S6†). This is in line with the literature reporting this temperature to enable proper mixing of the binary oxides when deposited separately on top of each other.14,17,51 Thus, detailed characterization of the composition, morphology and optical properties is presented solely for samples deposited at 600 °C using conditions I–VI. Although the diffraction patterns of CuWO4 and copper oxide/tungsten oxide are very similar, the determination of the presence of CuWO4 is still possible via the presence of the characteristic reflections at 15.3° and 19°. Whether crystalline CuWO4 is embedded in amorphous copper oxide or tungsten oxide, or crystalline WO3 or CuO is present simultaneously is, however, very difficult to determine. Detailed RBS/NRA measurements can shed some light on the composition of the samples and may exclude the presence of the binary oxides.
 Fig. 2  X-ray diffraction patterns of CuWO4 deposited on Si(100) at displayed deposition temperatures using condition III (a) and condition IV (b). Reference patterns taken from the ICSD database: no. 628612 for CuO, no. 50728 for WO3 and no. 24339 for CuWO4. For clarity, only the corresponding reflections of (010), (100), (200) and (022) CuWO4 planes are indicated with dashed lines. The asterisk denotes the diffraction of the underlying Si(100) substrate at 33°. 
In Fig. 3 the RBS spectra of CuWO4 deposited using four different conditions are presented. All spectra are characterized by the presence of tungsten, copper and oxygen, whereas the latter is superimposed by the signal of the underlying silicon substrate. While moving from condition II to condition V, the intensity of the tungsten signal increases while the intensity of the copper peak is reduced. Both metal peaks do not possess symmetric peak shapes independent of the condition and the tailing at lower channel numbers is attributed to rough surfaces. Table S2† gives an overview of the material composition and the respective ratios of copper to tungsten. Using condition I (CuO) and VI (WO3), deposits with nearly perfect stoichiometric metal to oxygen ratios were obtained, which is in line with the observations from XRD measurements (Fig. S7†). Samples synthesized according to condition sets II and III gave copper rich deposits with copper to tungsten ratios of 6 and 1.7.
 Fig. 3  RBS spectra of CuWO4 thin films deposited at 600 °C on Si(100) with varying Cu/W ratios synthesized according to conditions II–V. 
To further investigate the phase composition of the photoanodes, we recorded the Raman spectra of thick layers (∼500 nm) deposited at 600 °C (Fig. S8A†). The material with the stoichiometry calculated to be Cu/W = 1.1 is found to consist of a spectroscopically pure CuWO4 phase, whereas other composites include contributions from WO3 and CuO phases. Note that due to overlapping of the Raman modes for CuO and CuWO4, traces of CuO cannot be completely excluded in the Cu/W = 1.1 material (Fig. S8B†). The recorded Raman modes are attributed to the triclinic structure of CuWO4 (ICSD no. 24339). Furthermore, the vibrational internal (Ag) Raman mode at around 907 cm−1 is assigned to the symmetric stretching of O–W–O bonds, which is related to distorted octahedral [WO6] clusters in a triclinic lattice.52–54
The top view SEM micrographs of the films with varying Cu/W ratios are presented in Fig. 4 and reveal quite different morphologies. The top view images confirm the enhanced surface roughness of films prepared with conditions III (Fig. 4b) and V (Fig. 4d) and less rough films prepared with conditions II (Fig. 4a) and IV (Fig. 4c). Cross-sectional micrographs validate these observations. In addition, the thicknesses of the films were determined to be 100–150 nm for all deposits (Fig. S10†).

Optical properties and PEC measurements
Copper oxides (CuO, Cu2O and Cu4O3) are p-type semiconducting materials with bandgaps ranging from 1 eV to 2 eV and the nature of the transition is experimentally not conclusively determined.55 In contrast, WO3 and CuWO4 are n-type semiconducting oxides with indirect bandgaps of 2.7 and 2.3 eV, respectively.13,56,57 The UV/Vis spectra of the binary oxides and their mixtures according to the deposition conditions I–VI are presented in Fig. 5a. It is visible that with increasing copper content the absorptance is increased and shifted to the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The films on FTO are very thin, exhibiting strong interference features, which makes a precise determination of the bandgap using Tauc plots (Fig. 5b) difficult. The absorption edge, however, significantly shifts to lower energies with increasing Cu content.
 Fig. 5  (a) UV/vis spectra and (b) Tauc plots of thin films deposited using conditions I–VI (Abs. stands for absorptance). Bandgap energies of 1.44 and 2.86 eV were determined for CuO and WO3, respectively. Apparent fine absorptance structure arises from an interference pattern typical for thin films. 
The photoelectrocatalytic properties of films grown under the different conditions were investigated by photocurrent measurements in a neutral borate solution (pH 7). Copper oxide deposited using condition I on FTO glass at 600 °C did not show any anodic photocurrent response, which is in line with its p-type conductivity and rather negative valence band edge rendering the oxidizing power of holes very low. Upon addition of tungsten during the deposition process, the materials turn active in photocatalytic water splitting under front and backside illumination (Fig. 6). As a general result samples synthesized according to conditions IV–VI are significantly more active than the copper rich deposits. These electrodes exhibit a decent photoelectrocatalytic performance with photocurrent onsets at ca. 0.7 V vs. RHE and photocurrent densities higher than 0.06 mA cm−2 at 1.23 eV under 1 sun irradiation (see ESI, Fig. S13†). These values are in line with results reported for CuWO4 in the literature.17 A careful analysis of photoaction spectra (IPCE vs. wavelength plots; Fig. 6) obtained under different conditions (frontside vs. backside illumination) yields several valuable insights into the photoactivity of our thin films. Firstly, under frontside illumination the stoichiometric CuWO4 shows the highest IPCE values, whereas upon backside illumination WO3 photoanodes exhibit the best photoconversion efficiencies. Secondly, in the case of Cu-containing films including CuWO4 it is clear that at short wavelengths the IPCE values under frontside illumination are significantly higher than under backside illumination. This effect is more pronounced with higher Cu content. Notably, pristine WO3 thin films do not exhibit this trend. Since the layers are compact films, these findings suggest that the photocurrent response is, in the case of thin films (100–150 nm) containing Cu, mostly limited by a short diffusion length of the minority charge carriers (holes). Under the frontside illumination, due to the low-penetrating UV light, most of the charges are generated near the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, making it easier for holes to reach the electrolyte. In contrast, under the backside illumination the holes photogenerated by short-wavelength irradiation must overcome the largest distance to contribute to the photocurrent. Since the total distance of the carrier diffusion pathway (ca. 30 nm) and light penetration depth (Fig. S14†) at high energies is comparable with the layer thickness (100–150 nm), the backside irradiation results in lower IPCE values than the frontside irradiation. At lower energies, the light penetration depth exceeds the thickness of the sample and the carrier distribution within the layer becomes independent of the irradiation direction which leads to similar IPCE values. Obviously, in the bandgap region (ca. 540 nm) the absorption coefficient in the order of 103 cm−1 proves the weak absorption properties and consequently IPCE values decrease. Based on these results obtained on thin films we preliminarily conclude that (i) the performance limiting feature of CuWO4 photoanodes is the low mobility of holes; (ii) this low mobility of holes is caused by incorporation of Cu, since pristine WO3 films do not exhibit a significant difference in photocurrents depending on the illumination direction; (iii) the electron mobility in CuWO4 is at least sufficiently high enough to render the performance of thin CuWO4 films better than that of WO3 under frontside illumination.
 Fig. 6  Photoaction spectra (IPCE vs. wavelength plots) of thin films with different compositions measured in borate electrolyte (pH 7) at 1.12 V vs. RHE under irradiation from the frontside (a) and from the backside (b). For the corresponding raw photocurrent data see Fig. S12.† 
As apparent from the optical absorption measurements and photographs of the photoanodes (Fig. S11†) the light absorption of our thin CuWO4 films is rather limited. Therefore, in order to increase the light harvesting, as a next step we fabricated thicker samples (4 h deposition time, ca. 500 nm) and investigated their photocurrent response in comparative analysis with thin samples (Fig. 7 and S15†). Notably, the IPCE values under frontside illumination dropped significantly for thicker samples as compared to thin samples. This indicates that not only the hole mobility, but also the electron mobility is rendered worse in CuWO4, an effect which makes itself, however, apparent first when the sample thickness exceeds 150 nm. Again, this behavior is in stark contrast with that of pristine WO3 photoanodes which show a significant increase of photocurrent under frontside illumination upon increasing the film thickness (Fig. S16†). Interestingly, after etching the CuWO4 thick layer (∼500 nm, Cu/W = 1.1) with acetic acid, the presence of the WO3 component is observed in the Raman spectrum (Fig. S9†), indicating that acetic acid dissolves Cu from the tungstate to form WO3. In addition, the Cu/W = 1.1 sample after etching with acetic acid shows enhanced IPCE values (Fig. S17†). This is in agreement with our calculations showing an increase in the carrier diffusion length for mixed phases of CuWO4 and WO3 compared to the pure CuWO4 phase (data not shown). From this we conclude that the diminished mobility of electrons is also directly related to the presence of Cu in the films. Furthermore, in the visible range (Fig. 7, inset) the thick CuWO4 sample shows enhanced IPCE values under backside illumination. This can be easily understood in terms of more deeply penetrating visible light generating charges near the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, with holes being able to reach the electrolyte more readily. Based on this we conclude that while both electron and hole mobilities are decreased in CuWO4 as compared to WO3, it is in particular the low mobility of holes which exerts the strongest influence on the photocurrent generation and thus represents the major bottleneck in effective charge separation in CuWO4.

The electrodes were measured in borate electrolyte (pH 7) at 1.12 V vs. RHE. The inset shows a zoomed visible-light range. 
In order to shed some light on the question whether the electron and hole mobilities might be related to the intrinsic bulk properties of CuWO4, first-principles calculations of the electronic structure of CuWO4 were performed. The inset of Fig. 8 shows the unit cell used with octahedral coordination for both Cu and W. This work goes beyond previous studies that most commonly use a smaller unit cell with two formula units and compute the band gap without an HSE functional.58 For example, most recently, the electronic structure of CuWO4 was obtained with the HSE functional,59 but the geometry was optimized for a smaller unit cell with the PBE functional; here we use LDA+4 for geometry optimization, since it was found to better reproduce the experimental lattice parameters.16 Accordingly, since the lattice constants are smaller using LDA+4 compared with PBE+4 we use a 13% (ref. 58) portion of exact exchange instead of 16%.20 The band edge character of CuWO4 is revealed from ab initio calculations. As seen in the density of states (Fig. 8), the lower part of the conduction and valence band edge is characterized by a region of dominating Cu 3d states. Hence, bulk CuWO4 can be classified as a Hubbard-type insulator.
 Fig. 8  CuWO4 projected density of states and crystal structure (inset at bottom left) computed with HSE. The energy axis is scaled to have the valence band edge at zero energy. 
The abruptness in the rise of the band edges is an indication of a small electron and hole mobility since a large slope of the density of states is an indication of a large effective mass. The magnetic moments on Cu are 0.67 with LDA+4 and 0.69 with HSE, in agreement with a reported experimental value (0.67).47 The band gap is notable from the density of states plot of Fig. 8: there are no states in the region between the valence band edge located at zero energy and the conduction band edge almost 2 eV above. The band gap was accurately calculated from a band structure based on an automatically generated k-point mesh that subdivides the Brillouin zone in each direction while the origin is at the Γ-point. The band gap was obtained from the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied state in the conduction band of the k-point (1/3, 0, 0) located along Γ–X and the highest occupied state at the valence band edge of the k-point (1/3, 0, 2/5) located along U–Γ. Nevertheless, precise locations in the band diagram are not meaningful due to the low electron and hole mobilities that result in relatively flat bands and many near degeneracies at the valence and conduction band edges (see the band diagram in Fig. S18†). Hence, the calculated bandgap is slightly smaller (1.81 eV), but in reasonable agreement with typically reported experimental values (2.0 eV,60 2.25 eV,56 and 2.3 eV61).
The films obtained by our CVD approach are very thin and slightly lower in activity than the most active materials summarized by Lhermitte and Bartlett,62 but still comparable in activity with other smooth photoanodes.14,15,17,63 The SEM measurement from Fig. 4c indicates that there are fewer grain boundaries for the Cu/W = 1.1 stoichiometry which would imply less carrier scattering and higher effective carrier mobility giving motivation to further investigation, using TRMC. Hence, a CuWO4 sample fabricated under condition IV was deposited on a non-conducting quartz substrate. TRMC is a contact-free pump-probe technique that measures the AC conductivity via the coupling of the mobile photocarriers to the microwave electromagnetic field.64 From the change in reflected microwave power the photoconductivity and carrier mobility can be determined. Fig. 9 shows the microwave conductivity transient after excitation with a 7 ns laser pulse of 355 nm with an intensity of 4.1 × 1013 incident photons per cm2. The microwave conductance is given by the product of the charge carrier generation yield (φ) and combined electron and hole mobility (∑μ) of the system. The mobility of the carriers can then be obtained from the conductive transient peak assuming no major recombination losses at this early time. A value of ∼6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 is found – in the range of the low mobility values for BiVO4 that has been claimed as one of the most promising photoanode materials.65 With the carrier mobility μ, lifetime τ, and diffusion constant D we can extract the carrier diffusion length L, given by L = (Dτ)1/2 with D = kTμ/e. To calculate the carrier diffusion length of the CuWO4 films from the experimental peak mobility and carrier lifetime (Fig. 9) we employ a double exponential model fit to the decay of the signal as adapted from Savenije et al. (eqn (2))66 (2)with a = 0.66, b = 0.27, c = 0.077, τ1 = 50 ns and τ2 = 760 ns (a, b, and c referring to normalized data). Using the fitted shorter time constant of ∼50 ns, which probably reflects early trapping,67 polaron buildup68 and possibly to some extent recombination setting in, we obtain a diffusion length of ∼30 nm which is close to the values for undoped BiVO4. The diffusion length agrees with the above-mentioned trends in IPCE values measured for thinner films (∼100–150 nm) using frontside vs. backside illumination. Although TRMC measures the combined carrier conductivity and does not discern electrons and holes, the minority carrier diffusion length is expected to be inferior taking into account the photocurrent results. The poor transport properties of metal oxides are often caused by small polaron formation leading to slow carrier transport68 which can lead to recombination before the charge carriers reach the surface. However, in spite of polaron generation and low mobility, a long carrier lifetime may also result in a reasonable diffusion length as reported for BiVO4.69 The long-lived tail in Fig. 9 with a time constant of 760 ns implies an even slower recombination compared to BiVO4 and probably reflects multiple carrier trapping and detrapping processes at deeper trap levels.
 Fig. 9  TRMC plot for photoanodes deposited under condition IV (Cu/W = 1.1) on the ns time scale with fit (dashed red) at an intensity of 4.1 × 1013 photons per cm2. 
The peaks of the mobilities of the CuWO4 film shown in Fig. 10 appear to have an almost logarithmic relation to the intensity of the excitation which is comparable to TRMC performed on undoped BiVO4 samples.69 Lower pulse intensities than the domain shown could not be used to excite the film due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. The semilogarithmic plot suggests higher-order, nongeminate electron–hole recombination effects of the CuWO4 sample related to the high carrier density provided by the laser pump pulse. A tentative extrapolation of this behavior towards lower excitation densities would suggest a possibly higher mobility and correspondingly a longer diffusion length, however, such a prediction has to be made with care since trap-filling32,69,70 can also mask lower trap-dominated effective mobility values at photon fluences comparable to AM 1.5 sun conditions. Although much higher mobilities of ∼6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Cu2O and ∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1 for WO3 have been reported, the presented results for the CVD grown CuWO4 sample seem very promising.70,71

Conclusions
In summary, in this work we established a new CVD process for direct deposition of mixed Cu/W oxides enabled by a careful choice of precursors and process optimization. CuWO4 was synthesized for the first time directly from the vapor phase, without the need for any post-deposition annealing procedure. Moreover, the possibility to tune the composition (Cu/W ratio) in deposited materials by adjusting the CVD process parameters allowed us to investigate for the first time systematically the influence of stoichiometry on the photoelectrocatalytic performance of Cu–W mixed oxides and compare them to pristine WO3. We found that the presence of copper in tungsten oxide thin films reduces the bandgap and enhances the absorption properties of the material in the visible range. The photoelectrocatalytic performance of stoichiometric CuWO4 was found to be superior to that of WO3 only under specific conditions: under frontside illumination when using very thin (100−150 nm) films. A detailed comparative analysis of photocurrent data revealed that the incorporation of Cu into tungsten oxide decreases the mobility of both electrons and holes, and the latter has been identified as the performance-limiting factor. First-principles theoretical calculations of the electronic structure of CuWO4 suggest that the low mobility of electrons and holes might be an intrinsic bulk feature of CuWO4 as indicated by an abrupt rise of the density of states at both the band edges. A charge carrier mobility and diffusion length of ∼6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a 30 nm were determined by time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements, values comparable to those of undoped BiVO4. The fact that both low hole and electron mobilities in CuWO4 limit the performance of thicker photoanodes suggests that significant improvements of CuWO4-based photoanodes can be achieved only if the bulk electronic properties of CuWO4 can be engineered, for example by doping. However, the recently established excellent surface catalytic properties of CuWO410 and the relatively good photoconversion efficiencies of very thin CuWO4 films irradiated from the frontside suggest a possibility of using very thin CuWO4 films on top of highly absorbing semiconductors with optimal electronic properties.

 	Fig. 7  IPCE plots for photoanodes deposited under condition IV (Cu/W = 1.1) under frontside (black) and backside (red) illumination with different deposition times (1 hour, open markers; 4 hours, solid markers). The electrodes were measured in borate electrolyte (pH 7) at 1.12 V vs. RHE. The inset shows a zoomed visible-light range.	 

 	Fig. 8  CuWO4 projected density of states and crystal structure (inset at bottom left) computed with HSE. The energy axis is scaled to have the valence band edge at zero energy.
