    , Accepted 13th February 2012First published on 24th February 2012AbstractPhotoactive ZnGeP2 nanowires have been prepared by solid-source sublimation chemical vapor deposition using Sn catalysts. Nanowire films with areas >0.5 cm2 on Si(100) and Si(111) substrates were deposited with variable nanowire length and diameter. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning TEM (STEM), and polarized Raman microscopy indicated nanowires exhibited single-crystal character and compositional homogeneity. Photoelectrochemical measurements performed in an aqueous electrolyte indicated the as-prepared ZnGeP2 nanowires were p-type and capable of passing sustained cathodic photocurrents under white light illumination. The presented results identify a straight-forward approach to the preparation of II–IV–V2 nanowire films with features suitable for optical and photoelectrochemical energy conversion/storage applications.
Introduction
Nanostructured semiconductors in the form of nanowires,1 nanotubes,2–4 and quantum dots5,6 are currently under active investigation as key elements in photoelectrochemical energy conversion technologies. To date, the majority of emphasis has been directed toward common semiconductors such as Si, GaAs, and TiO2. However, phosphide-based semiconductors are the most active and efficient materials for photoelectrochemical water splitting7 and CO2 remediation.8,9 Despite the strong impetus, comparatively little progress has been made in the synthesis, study, and operation of earth abundant phosphide nanowires as photoelectrochemical materials.
Phosphides composed of Zn are attractive for several reasons. From an earth abundance and toxicity perspective, Zn-based semiconductors can be scalable. Zn-based chalcogenide and oxide semiconductor nanostructures have already been extensively studied and explored as photoresponsive materials.10–15 Conversely, Zn-based chalcopyrite phosphides with the nominal II–IV–V2 composition have received much less attention. These phosphides natively exhibit p-type conductivity,16,17 making them natural photocathode materials. These ternary II–IV–V2 phosphides feature the chalcopyrite lattice (Fig. 1) which is akin to a doubled zincblende lattice common in binary III–V phosphides. ZnGeP2, a ternary phosphide, is isoelectronic with GaP, a candidate photoelectrode material studied extensively for abiotic photosynthesis.18–21 ZnGeP2 has a mid-sized bandgap of approximately 2.1 eV17,22 and is therefore apt for supporting fuel-forming photoelectrochemical reactions.23 The band structure of ZnGeP2 indicates that the small effective masses for charge carriers (0.19me and 0.36me for holes and electrons, respectively)24 should correspond to larger charge carrier mobilities25 than in oxides with comparable bandgap energies (e.g. Fe2O3, 50–100me),26–28 an important feature for nanowire photoelectrodes.29

To date, no reports have demonstrated a method to synthesize ZnGeP2 nanowires. Control over the stoichiometry, compositional homogeneity, and crystallinity in the vapor phase deposition of ZnGeP2 is challenging due to the respective volatilities of Zn, Ge, and P.30 Herein we report for the first time a method to prepare ZnGeP2 nanowire films through solid-source sublimation chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using Sn nanoparticles. The use of solid powder sources eschews the need for toxic reagents like PH3(g) commonly used in phosphide nanowire preparation.31,32 We demonstrate the tenability of ZnGeP2 nanowire preparation from elemental Zn, Ge, and red P powders by way of mechanical alloying through high energy ball milling. Film level characterization of as-prepared ZnGeP2 nanowire films by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as single-nanowire examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning TEM (STEM), and polarized single-nanowire Raman microscopy are presented. Preliminary photoelectrochemical data illustrate the capacity for the as-prepared nanowire films to act as photocathodes in an aqueous electrolyte under white light illumination. These combined analyses describe a synthetic approach for the preparation of crystalline II–IV–V2 phosphide nanowire photoelectrodes.
Experimental section
ZnGeP2 nanowire film preparation
ZnGeP2 nanowire films were prepared in a customized tube furnace set-up (ESI† Figure S1). Approximately 8–15 mg ground ZnGeP2 powder was placed on a quartz platform and mounted in a quartz tube (diameter 2.0 cm, wall thickness 1.5 mm, length 32.3 cm) with a single open end. The film growth substrate was placed on a second quartz platform and positioned near the open end of the same quartz tube. This assembly was inserted into a larger quartz tube (diameter 2.2 cm, wall thickness 1.5 mm, length 66 cm) such that the source powder was at the center of a single zone tube furnace (Thermolyne F79345) and the smaller inner tube fit snugly against the closed end of the outer tube (Figure S1). All quartz tubes and platforms were cleaned with aqua regia (3:1 37%(aq) hydrochloric acid and 68–70%(aq) nitric acid, Fisher Scientific) for several hours and were thoroughly dried before use. The double tube set-up established a confined growth zone in one half of the furnace such that the source powder was located at the center of the heating zone and the growth substrate was located at an adjustable zone at lower temperatures. A third quartz platform was inserted as a stopper against the closed end of the inner tube. The tube set-up was evacuated under mechanical pumping to <80 mtorr and purged with Ar(g) (Cryogenic Gases) for a total of four purge-pump cycles. The duration of the final evacuation was 60 min. The valves to the mechanical pump were then closed and the sealed assembly was heated to 650 °C. This temperature was maintained throughout the duration of nanowire film growth. At the end of nanowire film growth, the furnace was cooled to room temperature over the course of approximately 2 h.
Single-crystal Si(100) and Si(111) were used as the growth substrates. Si wafers were cut, etched in hydrofluoric acid (49%(aq) by weight) for 30 s, rinsed in distilled water (>18MΩ cm, Barnstead Nanopure III purifier), and dried in N2(g). The substrates were then immediately transferred to a thermal metal evaporator chamber and pumped to <6 × 10−6 torr. A thin film of Sn (99.99%, Kurt J. Lesker) was evaporated onto the substrates for a film thickness of approximately 10, 20, or 30 nm. Sn film thicknesses were calibrated separately by atomic force microscopy (ESI). All catalyst films were used within 24 h of exposure to air. Evaporated Sn films were suitable catalysts for nanowire film preparation because Sn evaporated onto Si substrates has been previously reported to deposit as islands33,34 necessary for VLS-type catalysis.35,36 Sn islands were confirmed on the growth substrates used for ZnGeP2 nanowire film preparation (Figure S2). Additionally, excess Sn powder (99.5%, Strem) was placed on the quartz platform adjacent to the growth substrate to saturate the vapor phase with Sn(g).
To remove residual Sn from the nanowire films, as-prepared nanowire films were placed in 0.1 M HCl(aq) for 5 min, removed, and immersed twice in fresh distilled water (>18MΩ cm, Barnstead Nanopure III purifier). Lastly, the films were immersed in methanol (Fisher) to remove residual water and allowed to dry in air.
Two types of ZnGeP2 source powder were used. Polycrystalline ZnGeP2 powder was obtained from MolTech GmbH. The second type of source powder was prepared by mechanical alloying of elemental Zn, Ge, and P solids adapted from the preparation of tetragonal ZnP2.37 Stoichiometric quantities of Zn dust, Ge powder (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), and red phosphorus were placed in a hardened steel capsule. Three 10 g, three 3.5 g, and six 1.0 g steel balls were added for a ball to powder mass ratio of approximately 20:1. The capsule was sealed under Ar(g) atmosphere. Mechanical alloying of Zn, Ge, and P was carried out for 4 h in a Spex 8000 laboratory shaker mill customized with a fan to cool the motor for extended milling. The resulting powder was assessed by X-ray diffraction (Figure S5) and used as prepared.
Electron microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a FEI Nova NanoLab FIB-SEM operated at 5.0 kV equipped with a Schottky field emission gun (FEG) electron source and an in-lens secondary electron detector. Film thickness was assessed from scanning electron micrographs by fitting a rectangle across an entire field of view to the film from the Si substrate to the apparent top of the film, identified as the height of the majority of wires. In the case of more irregular films (i.e. growth time of 8 h), the average of 20 long wires in four fields of view was used. Mean nanowire diameters were assessed by measuring the diameters of all nanowires in a horizontal pass across a field of view, consisting of 10 to 30 nanowires.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted with a JEOL 3011 TEM operated at 300 kV equipped with a LaB6 electron source. Scanning TEM (STEM) was performed with a JEOL 2010F analytical electron microscope operated at 200 kV equipped with a Schottky FEG electron source and an EDAX Si(Li) energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector. Samples for TEM were prepared by sonicating ZnGeP2 nanowire films in ethanol (190 proof, ACS spectrophotometric grade, Aldrich) for 30 s and drop-casting onto support grids with an ultra-thin carbon film backed by holey carbon (Ted Pella). STEM samples were likewise prepared by sonication in ethanol, but were drop-cast onto copper support grids with a film of holey carbon only (Ted Pella). STEM grids were pumped to <5 × 10−7 torr in a custom-built high vacuum chamber prior to STEM to minimize carbon contamination. For all TEM examinations, X-ray energy dispersive spectra were recorded to identify the composition of a given nanowire (Figure S7).
Powder X-ray diffraction
Diffraction patterns were acquired with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Kα source, parallel beam optics, and a LynxEye detector. Rietveld refinement and background subtraction were conducted with Materials Studio. Peaks were assigned from simulated X-ray diffraction patterns according to published crystal parameters.17 The resolution of the diffractometer was sufficient to differentiate the reflection at 28.3° from the possible Si reflection at 28.47°.
Optical properties
Reflectance measurements were obtained with a Varian Carey 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with external diffuse reflectance and specular reflectance accessories. Diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded and the data were analyzed according to eqn (1), (1)where F(λ) is the Kubelka-Munk function, R(λ) is the measured, wavelength-dependent diffuse reflectance, α(λ) is the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient, and s is the scattering coefficient, assumed to be wavelength-independent. The optical bandgap was estimated from an analysis of the dependence of the factor (F(R)·Eλ)n on the photon energy, Eλ, where n is a real number. According to eqn (2a) and (2b), the value of n corresponds to ½ and 2 for direct and indirect bandgap semiconductors, respectively,38–40 α(λ)·Eλ = Adirect(Eλ − Eg)1/2(2a) α(λ)·Eλ = Aindirect(Eλ − Eg)2(2b)where Adirect and Aindirect are proportionality constants for direct and indirect bandgap semiconductors, respectively, and Eg is the optical bandgap energy.
Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw RM series spectrometer equipped with a Leica microscope, a Leica N plan 50x objective (numerical aperture = 0.75), Rayleigh line rejection edge filters for 785 nm excitation, a 1200 lines/mm grating, and a CCD detector (578 × 400) in 180° backscatter geometry. A 785 nm diode laser was used as the excitation source with a radiant power of 3.07 mW incident on the sample. For acquisition of Raman spectra of nanowire films, the incident excitation was intrinsically linearly polarized and no polarizing collection optic was used for spectral acquisition. Non-polarized and polarized Raman spectra of individual nanowires were separately obtained using a Renishaw inVia spectrometer equipped with a Leica microscope, a Leica N plan 100x objective (numerical aperture = 0.90), a holographic notch filter, a 1800 lines/mm grating, and a RenCam CCD detector in 180° backscatter geometry. A 514.5 nm Ar+ laser (Laser Physics 25s) was used as the excitation source with a radiant power of 250 μW incident on the sample. Dispersions of isolated nanowires were prepared by sonicating ZnGeP2 nanowire films in ethanol for 30 s and drop-casting onto glass microscope slides. Nanowires grown with a Sn catalyst thickness of 20 nm for 8 h were selected for individual nanowire Raman spectroscopy because their greater length and diameters were more suitable for identification of isolated nanowires with visible light optics. Discrete nanowires were identified and aligned to the excitation beam under bright field reflected light conditions in the microscope in order to excite and collect signal from localized regions of nanowires. A quarter-wave plate was used to circularly polarize the excitation for non-polarized spectra. For polarized spectra, a half-wave plate was used to align the polarization direction of the excitation either parallel or perpendicular to the long axis of the nanowire. Concomitantly, a linear polarizer was placed between the notch filter and the grating to isolate the Raman scatter with polarization directions either parallel or perpendicular to the long axis of the nanowire. The convention used to define the polarization condition for each spectral acquisition is diagrammed in Fig. 7b. For all Raman spectra, incident light fluxes were sufficiently low to avoid appreciable sample heating and power-dependent spectral features.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
ZnGeP2 nanowire film photoelectrodes were prepared on degenerately doped p-Si(111) substrates with a catalyst thickness of 10 nm and a growth time of 4 h. Ohmic contacts to the nanowire films were prepared by scratching the back side of the Si substrate, etching in hydrofluoric acid (49%(aq)), and applying In–Ga eutectic. The electrodes were then mounted onto a coiled tinned copper wire, fixed with conductive Ag epoxy (GC Electronics), and sealed with 1C Hysol epoxy (Loctite). Electrode areas were determined through optical image analysis. Photoelectrochemical analyses were conducted under white light illumination using a tungsten halogen lamp light source (ELH, Osram) equipped with a quartz diffuser. Illumination power densities were calibrated with a thermopile (S302A, Thorlabs) and were set to 100 mW cm−2. A glass cell with an optically flat bottom, a Pt mesh counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode were used to collect photoelectrochemical data with a digital potentiostat (CH instruments 420A). A 20 mM methyl viologen (98% Aldrich) in 1 M H2SO4(aq) solution was used as electrolyte.
Results
Nanowire film characterization
The effect of process parameters including growth temperature, growth time, catalyst type and size, substrate crystal orientation, and type of precursor powder (ground ZnGeP2 polycrystals or mechanically alloyed ZnGeP2 powder) on nanowire composition and size was studied. Crystalline ZnGeP2 nanowires were obtained within a limited but adjustable range of parameters. Suboptimal conditions resulted in either no nanowire film growth or exclusively Ge nanowire film deposition (Figure S8, S11). In the absence of any metal catalyst, no nanowire growth was observed under any condition. Fig. 2 presents cross-sectional and plan view electron micrographs for nanowire films prepared under conditions suitable for ZnGeP2 nanowire film preparation with Sn growth catalysts. Nanowire films were deposited with uniform density across the growth substrates (>0.5 cm2) and showed a tendency for alignment normal to the substrate surface plane. Spheres were consistently observed at the terminal ends of the nanowires, suggestive of a VLS growth mechanism. The observations from multiple sets of growth are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 2 shows ZnGeP2 nanowire films prepared at 650 °C. At this temperature, a red-orange film was also deposited on the quartz tube walls at the end of the growth tube. Lowering the furnace temperature by 50 °C to 600 °C resulted in no nanowire film deposition on the growth substrate (Figure S9) and limited deposition on the walls of the quartz tube. At 700 °C, nanowires composed of only Ge (as determined by Raman spectroscopy, vide infra) were collected on the growth substrate and more extensive and black film deposition occurred on the walls at the end of the quartz tube. The Sn film thickness governed both growth rate and nanowire diameter. Increased Sn film thickness yielded longer nanowires with larger diameters. For example, for a four-fold increase in growth time with constant Sn catalyst film thickness, the nanowire film heights increased by a factor of approximately 1.5 (Fig. 2(a)–(b)). Increased Sn catalyst film thickness by a factor of two resulted in an additional doubling of nanowire diameter and nanowire film height (Fig. 2(b),(c)). Nanowire growth rate appeared to increase with increased Sn catalyst film thickness. However, Sn catalyst film thickness greater than 20 nm resulted in Ge, rather than ZnGeP2, nanowire films as inferred by Raman spectroscopy (vide infra, Figure S10). For all growth durations beyond 1 h, kinked growth was observed. This observation was consistent with changes in relative growth direction due to variable reactant partial pressure during vapor-based growth.41 Growth times beyond 4 h yielded films with increased heterogeneity in nanowire diameter and length. Catalysts films composed of Au instead of Sn yielded exclusively Ge nanowires at conditions suitable for Sn-based growth (Figure S11). Separately, the substrate crystal orientation was not observed to effect perceptible differences in the growth rate, nanowire length, or nanowire diameter of ZnGeP2 nanowire films for a given set of process conditions (Figure S12). Lastly, both the commercially available polycrystalline ZnGeP2 source powder and the ZnGeP2 source powder prepared from mechanical alloying of Zn, Ge, and P yielded ZnGeP2 nanowire films with equivalent morphological and crystalline properties (Figure S6).

Powder X-ray diffractograms for nanowire films prepared as in Fig. 2 show reflections consistent with crystalline ZnGeP2 with the chalcopyrite lattice (Fig. 3a).17 No detectable reflections were noted for diamond cubic Ge or the underlying single-crystal diamond cubic Si substrate for conditions yielding high quality ZnGeP2 nanowire films. Reflections for β-Sn and oxides of Sn33,42 were observed in samples containing ZnGeP2 nanowires. Reflections indicative of β-Sn were not observed after ZnGeP2 nanowire films were etched in 0.1 M HCl(aq) for 5 min. The Sn signature at 30.6°42 provided an internal standard to confirm the absolute 2θ values for ZnGeP2. The relative intensities of the ZnGeP2 signatures indicated a preferential crystalline orientation, consistent with the noted tendency for vertical alignment of nanowires in Fig. 2. Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns yielded lattice parameters a = 5.47 Å, c = 10.81 Å, in accord with the reported crystal parameters for ZnGeP2.17

Raman spectra were collected to separately assess the crystalline character of as-prepared nanowire films and to identify film impurities not detectable by crystallography. Fig. 3b presents Raman spectra for nanowire films prepared under the same conditions as those shown in Fig. 2. Table 2 summarizes the assignments for the observed phonon modes. Raman spectra collected for nanowire films prepared with either Si substrate orientation or either ZnGeP2 source powder showed the same characteristic features indicative of crystalline ZnGeP2.43–46 ZnGeP2 crystallizes in the I2d spacegroup, a member of the D2d (i.e. 2m) point group.17 The irreducible representation for Raman active modes in ZnGeP2 is ΓRaman = A1 + 3B1 + 3B2 + 6E, giving rise to 22 Raman-active modes (accounting for the transverse optical (TO) and longitudinal optical (LO) splitting of the polar B2 and E modes).43 Significant overlap of multiple mixed and pure modes in the ZnGeP2 phonon spectrum43 between 330–400 cm−1 was observed for the prepared ZnGeP2 nanowire films (Fig. 3b). In bulk crystalline ZnGeP2, these modes are convoluted whenever the crystal orientation is not precisely defined relative to the excitation and collection polarization.43 For optimal deposition conditions, the Raman spectra were not dominated by a phonon mode at 300 cm−1 indicative of crystalline Ge.47 A strong Ge Raman signal served to identify conditions that failed to yield ZnGeP2 nanowires. For example, Raman spectra of ZnGeP2 nanowire films prepared with greater than 20 nm Sn catalyst exhibited comparatively more intense signal at 300 cm−1 (Figure S10). An additional signal was observed for some films at 127 cm−1, consistent with a β-Sn phonon.48 After immersion in 0.1 M HCl(aq) for 5 min, this particular feature was no longer observable (Figure S13), in contrast to the unchanged ZnGeP2 phonon Raman signatures after the acid treatment.

The as-prepared ZnGeP2 nanowire films were dark orange in color (Figure S14). Fig. 4 presents the visible light absorption characteristics of the prepared ZnGeP2 nanowire films. For these films, the fraction of reflected light from diffuse reflectance was substantially greater than from specular reflectance (Figure S15). The inferred absorption onset profile indicated an optoelectronic bandgap of 2.3 eV. This estimated bandgap value was consistent with reported pseudo-direct and direct bandgap energies for ZnGeP2 across the range 2.0–2.3 eV.17,49,50 The apparent sub-bandgap absorption in Fig. 4 was also consistent with the reported spectra for bulk ZnGeP2 crystals.22,51

The inset shows a plot of the squared product of F(λ) and the photon energy as a function of photon energy. The x-axis intercept from linear least squares fitting was used as a measure of the optical bandgap of the ZnGeP2 nanowires. 

Fig. 5 presents the photoelectrochemical results for as-prepared ZnGeP2 nanowire films immersed in 20 mM methyl viologen and 1 M H2SO4(aq). Fig. 5a shows the steady-state current-potential response of a nanowire film under white light illumination from an ELH lamp at 100 mW cm−2. Under these illumination conditions, the film exhibited photocathodic behavior, effecting the reduction of methyl viologen. Fig. 5b and 5c present chopped photocurrent-time response for a representative ZnGeP2 nanowire film while poised at a potential (−0.48 V vs. saturated Ag/AgCl) positive of the thermodynamic potential for the methyl viologen2+/+. The as-prepared ZnGeP2 nanowire films exhibited stable cathodic photocurrent, indicating p-type conductivity in the as-prepared films. No photoactivity was observed for the doped Si substrate due to the high, degenerate doping level (Figure S16).

Individual nanowire characterization

Fig. 6 presents TEM data for a representative nanowire prepared with a 10 nm Sn film, a growth time of 4 h, and a nominal diameter of 100 nm. These nanowires were selected since they were appropriate for electron scattering and X-ray emission conditions and assumptions of intermediate voltage electron microscopy.52Fig. 6a presents a bright field micrograph. Uniform diffraction contrast observed throughout the nanowire indicated a singular crystal orientation. Fig. 6b presents a selected area electron diffraction pattern from the same nanowire shown in Fig. 6a. The spot pattern was indexed to the chalcopyrite crystal structure on the <110> zone axis. The intense and well defined spots in the pattern further confirmed the single-crystal quality of the nanowire. Additionally, high resolution TEM as presented in Fig. 6c displayed phase contrast consistent with single-crystal ZnGeP2. The corresponding growth direction was identified as <111> with the perpendicular <112> directions radial along the nanowire diameter. No twinning defects perpendicular to the nanowire axis were observed in more than 15 nanowires examined with high resolution TEM. In three nanowires, single twin boundaries were observed parallel to the long nanowire axis along the <112> of the tetragonal chalcopyrite ZnGeP2 (Figure S17).

Fig. 7 presents elemental distribution profiles in a representative nanowire prepared with a 10 nm Sn catalyst film and a growth time of 4 h. Fig. 7a presents a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) electron micrograph, exhibiting atomic number contrast between the sphere at the terminal end of the nanowire and the nanowire body. The comparatively intense signal from the sphere indicated the presence of an element with higher average atomic number than in the nanowire, consistent with the notion that Sn preferentially was located at the tip of the nanowires. EDS line scans (Fig. 7b,c) across both the short and long axes of the nanowire showed homogenous signal from Zn, Ge, and P. The strength of the Zn Kα and Ge Kα signals were approximately half the signal of the P Kα line, suggesting the expected stoichiometry for this phosphide crystal. Signal for Sn was only strongly collected from the spherical cap on the nanowire (i.e. signal for Sn fell to background levels in the nanowire body). These line scans were corroborated by spot EDS on the same nanowire. The spot EDS demonstrated by standardless quantitation53 that the composition of the nanowire body comprised 24–27 at% Zn, 27–31 at% Ge, and 42–50 at% P, consistent with the expected 1:1:2 stoichiometry for ZnGeP2.

Individual nanowires were characterized by polarized Raman spectroscopy to investigate the long-range high-aspect ratio crystallinity of the prepared ZnGeP2 nanowires at length scales greater than the reduced sample volumes examined in the TEM. Fig. 8 presents single nanowire Raman spectra for a representative nanowire prepared with a 20 nm Sn catalyst film and a growth time of 8 h. In Fig. 8a, a non-polarized Raman spectrum of an isolated nanowire exhibited higher spectral resolution of ZnGeP2 phonon modes relative to the Raman spectra for nanowire films in Fig. 3, consistent with uniform crystallinity. Notably, no Ge signal was observed in the case of isolated nanowires. The reduced spectral overlap in the individual nanowire relative to the nanowire film spectra was attributed to the single crystal orientation of the nanowire with respect to the excitation and collection polarization.

(b) Depiction of coordinate system used for individual nanowire Raman spectra collection. (c) Polarized Raman spectra for an individual ZnGeP2 nanowire. Spectra are scaled relative to the data Y(ZZ)Ȳ acquisition according to the indicated factors. 
The single crystal orientation of individual nanowires allowed for their examination by Raman spectroscopy under polarized conditions, shown in Fig. 8c. Raman spectra obtained in the Y(ZZ)Ȳ geometry yielded the highest signal intensity. Spectra obtained in the Y(XZ)Ȳ, Y(XX)Ȳ, and Y(ZX)Ȳ geometries yielded lower signal intensity. These changes in relative signal intensities indicated that phonon propagation was not equivalent in all directions, i.e. the crystal lattices of the nanowires were oriented in a net direction. Phonons excited along the long axis with the detector polarized to collect phonons scattered along the radial direction were observed as the weakest Raman signal, indicating the long axis of the nanowire consisted of long range crystalline order. Phonons propagating along the shorter dimension of the nanowire were weaker as a result of the smaller crystal domain size in that dimension.
Discussion
This work demonstrates a method for producing ZnGeP2 nanowires that have potential utility as photocathodes in photoelectrochemical systems. The observed photocurrents were low for the employed illumination intensity, as expected for semiconductor nanowire photoelectrode materials whose morphological and electrical properties were not judiciously optimized.54,55 Prior research in our group has elucidated that these material properties in any candidate photoelectrode material must be controlled in concert in order to effect good solar energy conversion behaviors. Nevertheless, the stability in acid as well as good crystalline character suggest higher photoelectrode efficiencies for ZnGeP2 may be attainable. Further studies are necessary to assess the upper limit of ZnGeP2 nanowires as photocathode materials for photoelectrochemical applications like water splitting. The employed route for ZnGeP2 nanowire deposition facilitates such studies.
In contrast to other strategies for the preparation of ternary-phase semiconductor nanowires,56,57 the single-step approach shown here for ZnGeP2 nanowires is simple. The direct ternary-phase crystallization avoids compositional inhomogeneity as seen in many two-step binary-phase conversion strategies.58–61 An important feature of the deposition strategy employed here is the use of Sn as a VLS catalyst. The pseudo-binary Ge–ZnP2 phase diagram (Figure S18) indicates selectivity for ternary-phase nucleation of ZnGeP2 operates within a limited alloy stoichiometry range, i.e. ZnGeP2 decomposes to Ge and ZnP2 phases at even slight deviations from 1:1:2 stoichiometry.17,62 For this reason, Au nanoparticles apparently do not function as VLS catalysts for ZnGeP2 nanowires since the flat liquidus profile of the Au–Zn phase diagram63 instead facilitates the deposition of Ge nanowires. Since Sn is not a well-studied VLS catalyst and because ZnSnP2 represents a closely related crystal structure, Sn substitution on Ge sites in the prepared nanowires was anticipated. However, negligible Sn levels in the nanowire indicated by X-ray spectroscopy were inconsistent with significant Sn alloying and instead indicated Sn acted as a VLS catalyst for crystalline ZnGeP2 nanowires without Sn contamination.
The presented spectra demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy is a particularly useful and rapid probe for the quality of both ensemble films and individual ZnGeP2 nanowires. Cumulatively, the phonon modes observed in the Raman spectra for both the nanowire films and the individual nanowires indicate the as-deposited materials are crystalline ZnGeP2. Specifically for the Raman spectra from individual nanowires, the dependence of the phonon modes with the polarization of the incident/collected light indicate uniform crystallinity that has a specific orientation relative to the long axis of the nanowires. The Raman data also provide rapid insight on the purity of the as-deposited materials. The presence or absence of the Ge phonon mode at 300 cm−1 serves as a useful indicator for whether the employed growth conditions favored ZnGeP2 over Ge deposition. Similarly, the phonon mode for β-Sn indicated when a wet etch could selectively remove the Sn growth catalysts without damaging the crystalline character of the ZnGeP2 nanowires.
The electron diffraction data also strongly indicate the nanowires are single-crystalline. Electron diffraction patterns along a zone-axis of a single-crystal domain yield symmetric spot patterns with spot spacing and symmetry characteristic of the chalcopyrite crystal structure.52 The well-defined spots in the crystal patterns observed for areas encompassing the entire diameter of as-prepared nanowires indicate single-crystal character. The pattern of spots in the electron diffraction also correspond to the expected d-spacing and symmetry along the <110> zone axis of chalcopyrite ZnGeP2. The kinematically forbidden reflections are appropriately absent. Specifically, the diffraction pattern for diamond cubic Ge lattices should show an absence of {200} reflections, but these reflections were clearly evident and indicative of chalcopyrite ZnGeP2 (Figure S19). The electron diffraction patterns, bright field TEM, and HRTEM observed for ZnGeP2 nanowires also collectively suggest a preferred growth direction for ZnGeP2 nanowires along the <111> direction in the tetragonal chalcopyrite lattice.
The observed diffraction spots indicate the <112> direction occurs radially in the ZnGeP2 nanowires. The <112> direction corresponds to the <111> direction in the zinc blende lattice for analogous binary phosphide semiconductors. The chalcopyrite <111> is approximately equivalent to the <112> direction in the zinc blende lattice because  for the tetragonal chalcopyrite lattice. The relative angles between <001> and <112> in the observed diffraction patterns and axis of the nanowire in the corresponding HRTEM micrographs with the same absolute orientation determines the indexing of the axis of the nanowire as along <111>. This preferred growth direction was observed repeatedly for nanowires examined by TEM. Other orientations were observed with less consistency. The observed <111> growth direction does not correspond to a vertical growth orientation relative to the underlying Si substrate. There is an approximately 35° misorientation between the plane normal of the Si (100) substrate and the <111> growth direction and an approximately 19° misorientation with the vertical cubic <111> growth direction available on Si(100). For diamond cubic and zinc blende semiconductors, the <111> growth direction is available on both Si(100) and Si(111) substrate with a tendency for more vertical nanowires on Si(111) substrates.64–66 For the ZnGeP2 nanowires no correlation between nanowire alignment and substrate orientation was observed (Figure S12). The growth direction observed by TEM may account for some of the kinking observed in the nanowires as nanowires may initially grow along a less preferred growth direction before relaxing to the <111> direction. The preferred <111> growth direction also explains the slight deviation from vertical alignment of ZnGeP2 nanowires observed in the SEM (Fig. 2). Without catalyst patterning, the thermal CVD growth system does not inherently favor highly aligned nanowires,57 limiting further comment on the substrate orientation and growth direction based on electron microscopy observations.
Related III–V and I–III–VI2 semiconductor nanowires typically exhibit twinning defects perpendicular to their long axis.31,67,68 Such stacking faults lower the effective charge carrier mobilities. The as-prepared ZnGeP2 nanowires shown here exhibited no twinning defects perpendicular to the long axis of the nanowire. Where observed, twinning faults occurred as isolated defects parallel to the axis of the nanowire, consistent with the proposed radial orientation of the <112> directions31 (Figure S16). The nature of these stacking faults in ZnGeP2 nanowires may also suggest a unique feature of Sn VLS catalysts. A low density of defects along the direction of charge transport in high-aspect ratio ZnGeP2 nanowires (i.e. the long axis) offers the possibility for large charge carrier mobilities, further supporting the possibility of good solar energy conversion properties.29 Studies directed to this purpose are under way.
Summary
ZnGeP2 nanowire films were prepared by solid-source sublimation chemical vapor deposition with Sn catalysts on Si substrates. The cumulative data indicate the prepared nanowire materials are p-type, crystalline, have the target stoichiometry, and can be prepared with tunable lengths and diameters. The preparation of ZnGeP2 nanowire films presented here demonstrates a tenable approach for the preparation of ternary phosphide nanowire films without the use of hazardous phosphorus gaseous precursors. These findings provide new impetus for the application of flux growth techniques to the preparation of ternary phosphides and the use of nanostructured II–IV–V2 crystal phases as photoelectrode materials.
