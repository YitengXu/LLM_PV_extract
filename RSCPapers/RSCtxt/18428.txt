    , Accepted 16th February 2021First published on 17th February 2021AbstractIn terms of high-efficiency PM6:Y6 binary systems, there is still room to narrow the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level offset (0.36 eV) between PM6 and Y6 to further mitigate energy loss through introducing a second acceptor in the construction of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, we designed and synthesized a new slightly twisted perylene diimide (PDI)-tetramer with a large, planar coronene unit as the core, Cor-T-PDI, which has four quasi molecular orbitals that have little energy difference between them. Although the pairing of Cor-T-PDI with PM6 gives a fairly low photovoltaic performance, interestingly, when Cor-T-PDI is used as a second acceptor, an obvious increase in open-circuit voltage (Voc) was achieved for a PM6:Y6 base ternary system due to the creation of a cascade energy level alignment by Cor-T-PDI. After tuning the PM6:Y6:Cor-T-PDI ratio to 1:1.0:0.1, the Voc value was significantly increased to 0.854 V without sacrificing the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), resulting in a high PCE of 16.88% with a low energy loss (0.47 eV), which are among the best values for single-junction OSCs. This preliminary study shows that for a binary system with a high Jsc value but low or moderate Voc values, such as the PM6:Y6 blend, producing a cascade energy level alignment is a more efficient strategy to enhance the PCE by introducing a third component with an appropriate structure. It is believed that lowering the highest unoccupied molecular orbital level of this PDI derivative to fall between that of Y6 and PM6 or tailoring the absorption to achieve a complementary absorption profile with that of the PM6:Y6 blend will further improve the efficiency.
Introduction
Over the past few years, typical nonfullerene electron acceptors with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure have boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs) to 13–15%, such as ITIC, a small molecular acceptor with an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) central building block tailored by end-capping electron-deficient 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) groups.1–5 Recently, Zou et al. developed a new acceptor, Y6, which has a narrow bandgap (1.33 eV) and high electron mobility.6 When paired with the polymer donor PM6, the PM6:Y6-based single-junction OSCs achieved a breakthrough in conversion efficiency (PCE = 15.7%). The efficiency was further improved through fine tailoring the molecular structure of Y6.7–10 Meanwhile, modification of the polymer donor PM6 has also drawn much attention.11–13 Very recently, Ding et al. boosted the PCE up to 18% by replacing the polymer donor PM6 with D18, which contains fused-ring acceptor units and has a higher hole mobility than that of PM6.14
Indeed, relative to developing new high-performance donors (D) and acceptors (A), the ternary concept, introducing one additional electron donor or acceptor into a D/A binary blend, while maintaining the single-junction configuration, is a more convenient strategy to enhance PCEs, via expanding the absorption scope, manipulating the energy levels, and facilitating the morphology of the active layer.15–20 Notably, a low open-circuit voltage (Voc) has become the main factor hindering further improvement in the efficiencies of OSC devices, since the energy loss of Voc relative to the optical bandgap is the main reason for the loss in PCE.21 PM6:Y6 (1:1.20) binary devices have relatively low Voc (0.83 V) values and an energy loss of around 0.49 eV.6 Y6 has a very low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (−4.1 eV) level, while the LUMO of PM6 is −3.44 eV. Therefore, in order to enhance the Voc value, a third component as a guest acceptor should have a LUMO level that lies between the LUMOs of the donor and the host acceptor, thus producing a cascade energy level alignment.22 Recently, by adding a small amount of PC61BM or PC71BM (LUMO = −3.9 eV) into the PM6:Y6 system to enhance the charge transport and reduce recombination loss, several groups have separately achieved high efficiencies of over 16.5%.23–25 Morphology control and the trade-off between voltage and photocurrent are the main critical issues in ternary OSCs. Using a double acceptor alloy strategy, structurally similar nonfullerene guest acceptors with relatively high LUMOs have been widely investigated as guest acceptors in PM6:Y6 to fabricate ternary OSCs to increase the PCE, materials such as ITIC, IDIC, BTP-M, ITCPTC and O-IDTBR.26–30
It is worth mentioning that perylene diimide (PDI), the most extensively used dye in industry, is readily scalable at low cost, making it one of the few feasible candidates for use in commercial OSCs.31 Moreover, the LUMO energy levels of PDI derivatives are between −3.7 and −3.9 eV, which fall between the LUMOs of Y6 and PM6. In general, two types of molecules with very similar molecular structures tend to mix together well and form an alloy. Since PDI derivatives have quite different molecular structures to that of Y6, it is essential to modulate their crystallinity for the sake of forming an acceptor alloy. Generally, the crystallinity of PDI derivatives can be tuned through simply tailoring their configuration. In 2017, Huang et al. reported that a twisted configuration of PDI derivatives as a guest acceptor was essential to produce more quasi LUMOs, which had a significant influence on the Voc value of the ternary device: as the number of quasi-degenerate LUMOs increased, the Voc value increased.32 Recently, PDI derivatives have been employed as second acceptors in coordination with ITIC acceptor to pair various polymer donors (PBDB-T, PBT7-Th, PBDT-T1, PTFT-O and J71) for the sake of enhancing the PCE, some of which are shown in Fig. 1.32–37
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of PDI-based acceptors as the third component in ternary OSCs and PM6 and Y6. 
A lot of studies have confirmed that in the case of PDI-based acceptors, a slightly twisted configuration is beneficial to achieving a good trade-off between the phase separation and charge transport in the active layer.38 Owing to the large, rigid polycyclic aromatic skeleton of PDI, introducing a big, planar core would help to achieve a slightly twisted geometry. Very recently, we obtained a promising PDI-tetramer (Py-e-PDI) based electron acceptor with a slightly twisted configuration through introducing planar pyrene as a core with a C–C triple bond as a linkage to reduce the crowding at the periphery of the core.39 However, Tan et al. reported that an acetylene-linked π-spacer strengthened the planarity of the entire D–A structure, leading to well delocalized highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/LUMO electron orbitals over the whole conjugated structure, thus reducing the number of quasi LUMOs.34
In order to enhance the Voc value of the PM6:Y6 blend, herein we designed a new twisted PDI derivative (Cor-T-PDI) as an additional acceptor. Relative to pyrene, coronene, a six membered fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) ring, has a large planar architecture, with four peripheral PDI units with reduced crowding. Moreover, replacing the acetylene-linked π-spacer with a thiophene ring produces a twisted geometry, thereby leading to four quasi LUMOs. The electron-rich core in Cor-T-PDI was expected to interact with the electron deficient core of Y6 to increase compatibility of the two acceptors. In addition, charge transfer from the coronene core and PDI units in the Cor-T-PDI generates a charge separation (CS) state, which was recently reported to improve its photovoltaic performance as an acceptor.40,41
Result and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of Cor-T-PDI involves only a three-step reaction. As shown in Scheme 1, tetrakis(Bpin)coronene (1) is a key intermediate in constructing the target material. In general, the typical borylation procedure for aromatic compounds involves treating the corresponding brominated derivatives with n-BuLi at low temperature to produce the corresponding dianions, which are then quenched with the corresponding borylating agent. And also, aromatic bromide can be converted to the corresponding boronic acid pinacol ester via a reaction with B2pin2, catalyzed by Pd(II) under alkaline conditions. However, tetrabromocoronene is not available to purchase. Therefore, herein we synthesized compound 2via the direct borylation of unbrominated coronene via an Ir-catalyzed C–H activation.42 Another key intermediate (3) was obtained from mono-brominated PDI (Br-PDI) successively through Stille coupling and a bromination reaction. A further Suzuki coupling reaction between compounds 1 and 3 in a molar ratio of 1:6 afforded the desired four-armed molecule Cor-T-PDI in moderate yield. Cor-T-PDI shows limited solubility in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3. The chemical structure was confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and both low and high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of the Cor-T-PDI. 
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that Cor-T-PDI adopts a nonplanar, 3D-star “core-arm” configuration, which is different from that of Py-e-PDI, which has a planar pyrene as a core and C–C triple bond linker (Fig. 2a).39 The thiophene rings that act as a bridge between the coronene core and peripheral PDI units are almost perpendicular to both the coronene and PDI planes. Therefore, the direct electron communication between the coronene core and peripheral PDI units is limited. Fig. 2b shows pictorial representations of the frontier molecular orbitals of Cor-T-PDI, in which the HOMO is mainly localized on the coronene core, while the electron is delocalized on the four different “arms” and thus, the four quasi-degenerate LUMOs show little energy difference between them. Based on a recent study by Huang et al.,32Cor-T-PDI was expected to significantly improve the efficiency of the PM6:Y6 binary system through enhancing the Voc value as a guest acceptor.

Optical properties
The optical properties of Cor-T-PDI were characterized using UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra of this PDI derivative and the relative monomers (coronene and Br-PDI) in dilute toluene solution. In toluene solution, Cor-T-PDI shows two distinct absorption bands, including a strong band in the short wavelength region (300–400 nm) and a band in the long wavelength region (450–650 nm). Obviously, the former originates from the coronene core, while the latter is related to the PDI units. Noticeably, an obvious vibronic structure was observed for the absorption bands in the long wavelength region. Like other multichromophoric PDI systems, the 0–1 vibronic band of the absorption spectra of Cor-T-PDI at 492 nm is slightly enhanced with respect to the 0–0 band at 528 nm, indicating some extent of electronic coupling between the two adjacent PDI units.41,43 Compared to the absorption in solution, the thin film of Cor-T-PDI shows a broader absorption with a small redshift (17 nm) only for the absorption band in the 300–400 nm region, suggesting weak intermolecular interactions and molecular aggregation in the film.

As shown in Fig. 2c, the emissions of Cor-T-PDI showed heavy solvent polarity dependence. The emission was significantly quenched as the polarity increased, suggesting effective nonradioactive decay channel in polar solvents, and, most probably, a charge separation process.41 Many studies have shown that PDI derivatives as nonfullerene acceptors with a large charge separation help to increase the PCE.40
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PM6, Y6, and Cor-T-PDI in the film state are shown in Fig. 2d. The main absorption in the 400–700 nm range in the spectrum of PM6 is partly overlapped by that of Cor-T-PDI. Quite evidently, the absorption profile is complementary to the PM6:Y6 blend only at a shorter wavelength range (300–400 nm).
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to determine the HOMO and LUMO of the new PDI derivative. As shown in Fig. 4a, Cor-T-PDI underwent an irreversible one-electron reduction originating from the reduction of the peripheral PDI units. The onset reduction potential was found to be −0.90 V (versus Ag/AgNO3). Therefore, the LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −3.78 eV, which is close to those of other PDI derivatives. A reversible two-electron oxidation process was observed for this material. However, it is worth noting that the onset oxidation potential was found to be 0.27 V (versus Ag/AgNO3) and the HOMO was calculated to be −4.97 eV, which is very close to that of coronene. Apparently, there is almost no electronic hybridization between the coronene core and peripheral PDI units in the ground state. This fact is in good agreement with the optical experimental results.
 Fig. 4  (a) Cyclic voltammogram of the Cor-T-PDI thin film and (b) an energy level diagram of the materials used in ternary OSCs (PM6, Y6, Cor-T-PDI). 
The LUMO energy (−3.78 eV) of Cor-T-PDI lies between the LUMO energies of the donor PM6 (−3.61 eV) and the acceptor Y6 (−4.11 eV). Clearly, adding Cor-T-PDI as a third component brings about a cascade-like LUMO energy level alignment in the ternary system (Fig. 4b), which is helpful to increasing the Voc value. Cor-T-PDI serves as an energy bridge to deliver electrons to Y6.
Photovoltaic properties
To test the viability of this new PDI derivative as an electron acceptor, PM6, a high-performance polymer donor, was used to fabricate binary OSCs using a conventional ITO/PEDOT/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag device configuration. Similar to the PM6:Y6 binary system, the photoactive layer was a blend of PM6 and Cor-T-PDI in a ratio of 1:1.20, which was spin-coated from CHCl3 solution. Unexpectedly, this binary device gave poor photovoltaic performance, with a PCE of 1.92% due to low Jsc and FF values (Table 1). The corresponding current density versus voltage (J–V) and EQE curves are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). One possible reason leading to the low PCE of the PM6:Cor-T-PDI based binary device is the inverted HOMO levels for PM6 and Cor-T-PDI, thereby meaning that photoinduced hole transfer from Cor-T-PDI to PM6 was not allowed.27 Encouragingly, an exceptionally high Voc (0.98 eV) value was achieved for this device. Considering that high-efficiency PM6:Y6 binary devices have relatively low Voc (0.83 V) values, introducing Cor-T-PDI into the PM6:Y6 binary blend to fabricate a ternary device was expected to greatly enhance the Voc value and thus substantially improve the efficiency. Furthermore, in this ternary system, the two different acceptors cooperatively promote both electron and hole transfer processes.

To verify whether the addition of Cor-T-PDI as the third component in the PM6:Y6 binary devices enhances the Voc value, we fabricated OSC devices using the same device architecture. Keeping the donor:acceptor ratio (D/A = 1:1.20) constant, various ratios of Cor-T-PDI (0.05, 0.10, 0.20, by wt) were added to the acceptor mixture to construct ternary blends. The control of the active layer thickness was realized by the change in the total concentration in chloroform solution. Fig. 5a shows the J–V characteristics of the devices under an illumination of 1 sun (simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2), and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1. The optimal PM6:Y6 reference binary devices exhibit a Voc value of 0.835 V, a Jsc value of 25.79 mA cm−2, and a FF value of 75.64%, producing a maximum PCE of 15.93% with an energy loss of 0.49 eV. Upon the addition of 0.05 by weight of Cor-T-PDI into the PM6:Y6 blend, the ternary device displayed an obvious enhancement in all its photovoltaic parameters, with a Voc value of 0.852 V, Jsc value of 25.99 mA cm−2, and a FF value of 75.98%, resulting in a PCE of 16.82%. Further increasing the Cor-T-PDI content to 0.10 in the ternary systems, both the Voc and Jsc values exhibited a slight enhancement, while a small drop was observed for the FF value, delivering a PCE of 16.88%, with a reduced energy loss (0.47 eV) for the best devices. Although higher loading of Cor-T-PDI (0.20 by weight) led to continuing improvement in the Voc (0.859 V) value, the Jsc and FF decreased, especially the latter, dropping sharply from 75.53 to 72.76%, leading to a reduced performance (PCE of 15.84%) compared to the PM6:Y6 binary device. It is clear that with the addition of Cor-T-PDI, an obvious increase in the Voc value was observed from 0.835 V for the binary device to 0.852 V for the 0.05 device, 0.854 V for the 0.15 device and 0.859 V for the 0.20 device, which is in agreement with its decreased EA value compared to that of Y6 (creating an energy cascade).

To gain further insight into the contribution of the Cor-T-PDI on the light-to-current conversion, we first carried out EQE measurements. Generally, in most ternary systems, the third component contributes towards an improvement in the PCE by enhancing the Jsc value through expanding the light absorption range. Based on the photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 1, we could see that adding Cor-T-PDI into the PM6:Y6 blends only resulted in a slight change in both the Jsc and FF values and thus the obvious enhancement in the Voc value dominantly contributed towards the improvement in the PCE. Therefore, it is not surprising that the ternary PM6:Y6:Cor-T-PDI blend and binary PM6:Y6 blend showed almost the same EQE spectra, as shown in Fig. 5b. According to optical characterization, the absorption profile of Cor-T-PDI was almost overlapped with that of the PM6:Y6 blend and was slightly complementary only in the 300–400 nm range. This result was also consistent with the absorption experiments. Quite evidently, the formation of a cascade energy level alignment by Cor-T-PDI is responsible for the enhanced Voc value, through improving the exciton dissociation, and decreasing non-radiative recombination.
As shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†), the photoluminescence spectrum of Cor-T-PDI is well overlapped with the absorption band of Y6, and the Förster energy transfer from Cor-T-PDI to Y6 should be allowed. It is obvious that PM6:Y6 binary blend shows efficient quenching, while the PM6:Cor-T-PDI binary blend does not quench well in the range of 650–850 nm from the Cor-T-PDI emission, suggesting that the exciton dissociation efficiency is low in PM6:Cor-T-PDI binary blend (Fig. S2b, ESI†). This is also in good agreement with the low efficiency of PM6:Cor-T-PDI binary devices. The ternary blends show almost the same high quenching as the PM6:Y6 binary blend, indicating that they have good morphologies and that high-efficient charge separation is maintained.
The hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe) of the optimal binary and ternary blended solar cell films were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method using ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag (hole-only) and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN-Br/Ag(electron-only) device structures, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†), due to the nonplanar, 3D-star “core-arm” configuration, pure Cor-T-PDI shows a very low electron mobility (3.65 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is partially responsible for the low Jsc and FF values of PM6:Cor-T-PDI binary devices. While, the PM6:Y6 binary blends show a relatively high electron mobility of 8.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and hole mobility of 4.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are comparable to the values reported in the literature.6 As for the optimal ternary blend with the addition of 0.1Cor-T-PDI by weight, the electron mobility increased to 8.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the hole mobility increased to 5.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Both the electron and hole mobilities show slight enhancement, maintaining relatively balanced charge transport, with μh/μe at 0.58. The slight enhancement in the charge transport in the ternary blend is probably due to the minor improvement in morphology (see the GIWAXS section). This result partially explains why the ternary devices still maintain high Jsc and FF values after adding Cor-T-PDI as the third component, besides the obvious enhancement in the Voc value.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to reveal the morphology structure of pure PM6, Y6 and Cor-T-PDI, as well as the different blends films. As shown in Fig. 6, pure Y6 has a dominant face-on orientation, with two main peaks at qr = 0.295 Å−1 (d = 21.3 Å) and qr = 0.410 Å−1 (d = 15.3 Å), and a (010) peak at qz = 1.77 Å−1 (d = 3.55 Å). Pure PM6 exhibits obvious (100) lamellar peaks in both the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions at qr = 0.290 Å−1 (d = 21.7 Å) and qz = 0.305 Å−1 (d = 20.6 Å). The pure Cor-T-PDI also has (100) lamellar peaks in the IP and OOP directions at qr = 0.270 Å−1 (d = 23.3 Å) and qz = 0.290 Å−1 (d = 21.7 Å). However, compared with pure Y6, the crystallinity of pure Cor-T-PDI is much weaker, which is in agreement with the low electron mobility of the pure Cor-T-PDI film.

The PM6/Y6 blend film retains a dominant face-on orientation with a (100) lamellar peak at qr = 0.300 Å−1 (d = 20.9 Å), and a (010) peak at qz = 0.325 Å−1 (d = 19.3 Å). Meanwhile, the ternary PM6:Y6:Cor-T-PDI (1.00:1.10:0.10) blend film exhibits almost the same molecular orientation, but stronger intensity at the lamellar peaks, which is probably responsible for a slight enhancement in charge transport after adding Cor-T-PDI. However, only a preferred edge-on orientation with lamellar peak at qz = 0.320 Å−1 (d = 19.6 Å) was observed for the PM6:Cor-T-PDI binary blend film. According to the morphology of the active layer investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (see Fig. S4, ESI†), we also found that a small amount of Cor-T-PDI did not bring about any obvious changes in the surface morphology of the active layer. Therefore, in the optimized ternary blend, a small amount of Cor-T-PDI did not have a big enough effect on the morphology, and thus the charge transport was well maintained.
Based on the above result, Cor-T-PDI is not a good electron acceptor for PM6, with a PCE of only 1.92% due to mismatched energy levels, low electron mobility and a narrow light absorption range. However, significantly, for the same donor polymer PM6 with Y6 as an electron acceptor, and Cor-T-PDI as the second acceptor (0.10 by weight), substantial enhancement of the Voc value was observed, from 0.835 to 0.854 V. It is important that adding Cor-T-PDI produces a cascade energy level alignment, where Cor-T-PDI serves as a bridge to transfer electrons to Y6. Therefore, the ternary device probably operates mainly via a charge transfer mechanism. Although Förster energy transfer from Cor-T-PDI to Y6 also occurs, the slight enhancement in the Jsc value indicates only a minor contribution to the improvement of the PCE. Normally, when introducing a second acceptor to improve the efficiency of a binary system, one popular strategy is to select a third component to complement or extend the absorption scope of the binary host and thereby enhance the light harvesting ability of the active layer.15,17,45,46 However, for a binary system with a high Jsc value but a low or moderate Voc value, such as the PM6:Y6 blend, producing a cascade energy level alignment among the three components is a more efficient strategy to enhance the PCE.
Conclusion
In this study, we introduced a big, planar coronene unit as a core to develop a new PDI-tetramer based electron acceptor. The 3D-star “core-arm” configuration endows Cor-T-PDI with four quasi molecular orbitals that have little energy difference between them. Cor-T-PDI was successfully introduced into a PM6:Y6 binary system as the third component to fabricate high-performance ternary OSCs. Binary PM6:Y6 OSC exhibits a PCE of 15.93%, with a Voc value of 0.835 V, a Jsc value of 25.79 mA cm−2 and an FF value of 75.64%, respectively. With the addition of Cor-T-PDI, an obvious increase in Voc was observed. After tuning the PM6:Y6:Cor-T-PDI ratio to 1:1.0:0.1, the Voc was significantly increased to 0.854 V without sacrificing the Jsc and FF values, resulting in a ternary OSC with a high PCE of 16.88%. The forming cascade energy level alignment by Cor-T-PDI plays a dominate role in enhancing the Voc value, probably through improving the exciton dissociation, and decreasing the non-radiative recombination. It is believed that lowering the HOMO level of this PDI derivative to fall between that of Y6 and PM6 or tailoring the absorption to achieve a complementary absorption profile with that of the PM6:Y6 blend will further improve the efficiency. This work is currently underway in our lab. Most importantly, this preliminary study will bring about a new way of thinking: Is there a remarkable difference in molecular design for new nonfullerene acceptors towards binary OSCs and as second acceptors for ternary OSCs?
