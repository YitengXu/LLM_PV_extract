This is the eighteenth annual review published in JAAS of the application of atomic spectroscopy to the chemical analysis of environmental samples. The review follows on directly from last year's
(J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2002, 17, 284-317), and once again uses the revised format which includes less tabulated material. It was recognized by the review group that some of the tables were becoming less comprehensive and that this form of information was better and more easily obtained using electronic searches. We therefore critically report on the most important developments in environmental analysis during the review period, and tend to focus on improvements to existing techniques that provide more reliable and robust analytical methods. Comments on these changes and possible improvements for future reviews will be welcomed by the review coordinator.
1 Air analysis
This section covers the analysis of aerosols, particulates and gases by atomic spectrometric techniques. Noteworthy areas of research and development are highlighted below. Two useful review articles have been published: on the use of lichens as bioindicators of air pollution1 and on the use of TXRF as a micro-elemental technique, which includes a useful sub-section on the analysis of airborne particulate matter.2
1.1 Deposition sampling and analysis
The sampling and analysis of ice cores provides a means of assessing the atmospheric circulation of anthropogenic heavy metal pollution. A consortium of universities have, for the first time, recovered ice core samples from a tropical glacial ice cap in Bolivia and determined a range of heavy metals using a sector field ICP-MS system equipped with a microconcentric nebuliser.3 The work compliments that carried out on Greenland/Antarctic core samples. Contrasting results were noted, however. In this study trace metal concentrations observed in ice core samples from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM at 22000 BP) were similar to concentrations measured in core samples from the early Holocene (8000 BP). However, studies in Greenland and the Antarctic show higher concentrations in samples dating from the LGM compared to samples from the early Holocene, although the authors stressed that repeat sampling and analysis is required to assess temporal variability. Further work will also focus on the determination of Hg because of the practice, widely used in South America, of recovering gold using the amalgamation technique. The consortium has also used their high resolution system to analyse ice core samples from Mont Blanc to assess the atmospheric levels of U in the recent ‘atomic age’.4 A certified reference river water SLRS-3 (NRC, Canada) was used throughout the study for internal quality control. To aid the assessment of contributions from rocks and soil, i.e., crustal enrichment factors, Al was determined by ETAAS and D/H ratios were determined as a means of assessing seasonal periodicity. As expected, U concentrations in post World War Two core samples were elevated compared with those in pre-war samples. Higher concentrations were noted in the summer than winter, probably due to thermal inversion layers hindering long-range particle transportation. The authors suggest that the predominant sources would have been mining activities associated with U extraction in East Germany and in France. Further work is planned to determine U isotopic signatures, partially in response to current concerns over the use of depleted uranium munitions in recent Balkan conflicts.
Measurement of ultra-trace levels of heavy metals in ice core samples is not easy; for example, Pb concentrations can be at the pg g−1 level. Australian workers have outlined their contamination control procedures.5 Analytical blanks can be successfully controlled by using vigorous cleaning of plastic laboratory apparatus and by the use of sub-boiling distillation for acids. ‘Clean room’ air quality must be continuously assessed through the use of air and deposition-sampling techniques to ensure standards are maintained. Contributions from the sample i.e. deposition of dust particles on the outer cores and the associated chiseling with stainless steel tools was assessed using artificial ice core samples prepared from high purity water. The authors followed a standardized protocol in preparing ice cores to ensure that blanks associated with the preparation and analysis of inner core samples can be reduced to less than 1 pg total lead. An alternative procedure for ice core sampling and analysis has been described by McConnell and co-workers.6 They used an online continuous ice core melter linked to a low resolution ICP-MS system equipped with an USN introduction system. Although the brass heater plate precluded the measurement of Cu, Ni and Zn, good agreement was obtained with results reported elsewhere for Pb in Greenland ice core samples using the more conventional chiseling approach. The injection of ‘timer’ standards is used to determine residence times within the system and to correlate with measurements of cations and anions made with the co-attached continuous flow analyzer (CFA). The melt from the outer core is directed to waste, that from the middle core to the CFA and that from the inner core to the ICP-MS. Pump rates for the three zones were designed to ensure that lateral flow on the melter heater is strongly outward in order to minimise lateral contamination. Preliminary investigations using ice core samples associated with known volcanic events suggest that there are no problems with particles. It is assumed that these are of such a size that they pass through the system and are subsequently vaporised in the plasma.
Goodsite and co-workers7 used high resolution AMS to obtain 14C dating of ‘post-bomb’ peat archives of atmospheric pollutants. They initially compared an extensive set of published experimental data that allowed them to generate a 14C calibration curve for the northern hemisphere to a precision of 1–2 years. They showed that this new procedure offers a means of testing the validity of measurements made with the more conventional 210Pb procedure that can be influenced by irregularities on the surfaces of peat bogs, e. g., variable trapping rate of radionuclide fallout material. Finally, they applied this ‘bomb-pulse’ dating procedure to profiles of Hg concentration in these peat cores that were in fair agreement with ice core and other archive studies.
1.2 Real-time measurements
A number of researchers are continuing efforts to develop instrumentation for real time measurements. This is of interest given that temporal resolution is lost with conventional filtration based procedures. A half-way house approach is the use of the so-called ‘streaker’ sampler, a filtration substrate that can be rotated on a timed basis. Deposited material is subsequently analysed in the laboratory. The use of the PIXE technique in association with this sampler has been highlighted in previous Updates. Advances in this approach have been reported. Workers at the University of Antwerp placed a conductive mask under the nucleopore filter substrate so that it could be analysed by SIMS.8 This feasibility study showed that it was possible to obtain information on low Z elemental ions and low molecular fragment ions, thus providing complementary data to that obtained using PIXE. In a similar vein, Cahill and co-workers continue to develop their rotating drum impactor sampler equipped with Mylar impaction films.9 With the PESA technique they were able to measure successfully the hydrogen content of samples by obtaining a consistent and uniform hydrogen blank in the Mylar substrate. In conjunction with STIM and S-XRF techniques they are now able to achieve mass closure on size and time resolved aerosol samples approaching 80% compared with gravimetric sampling. Nitrates are a large component in such fine particulates and further work is being carried out to increase this mass closure value through the determination of nitrogen in such samples.
A number of instrumental approaches continue to be explored with an ultimate aim of producing robust continuous emission monitors
(CEM) for the determination of trace metals in stack gases. Work is focusing on reducing the limitations of current systems. For example, Trassey and co-workers10 have examined calibration protocols used in conjunction with prototype online ICP-AES systems and have concluded, not surprisingly, that matrix matching between samples and standards is required for the successful analysis of stack gases, e.g., matching the CO2 content. In the case of constant load systems, such as incinerators, this may be possible and may only require periodic checking of the stack gas composition. However, with other combustion systems that have a more fluctuating gas matrix, this could be difficult and some form of automatic gas monitoring with active feedback would be required. LIBS techniques continue to attract attention, particularly temporal gating procedures to maximise the S/N ratios between atomic emission signals and the continuum background.11 Improvements in S/N ratios and associated analysis algorithms offer possibilities for the direct analysis of ambient air particles,12 another long-term goal of CEM systems. Oikari and co-workers at the Tempere University of Technology in Finland are developing an AAS technique using a dc nitrogen plasma excitation source with Zeeman background correction.13 The detection limits of the current prototype are 0.04 mg m−3 for Cd and 0.4 mg m−3 for Pb. The authors have concerns over the atomisation of particulate bound metals and the relatively high detection limits. However, even in its current form, they see the system's potential as an online measurement technique to support research into combustion and other thermal processes where high temperature waste streams exist.
1.3 Instrumental techniques for bulk analysis
X-ray techniques such as PIXE continue to be widely used for the analysis of airborne particulate matter.14,15 Beaulieu and co-workers improved the detection limit achievable with PIXE by reducing the signal contribution from the impaction substrate.16 They achieved this by taking microscopic photographs of the aerosol deposits to determine the area of each deposit. They then used these values to optimise beam sizes, thus reducing the influence of the substrate. TXRF is gaining in popularity, due no doubt to an increase in the number of vendors supplying such instruments. Conventionally, aerosol samples are collected on a filter and pretreated either by acid digestion17 or an ashing procedure.18 The resultant solution is pipetted onto a clean flat carrier such as quartz or, if cost is an issue, Perspex. Quantification is generally achieved by adding a known quantity of an internal standard element. The solution spots are subsequently dried to provide a thin layer for analysis. German researchers have developed a more direct procedure.19 They built a special impactor/electrostatic sampler to collect size segregated ambient air aerosol samples directly onto glass–carbon carriers. Perspex carriers were not successful owing to enhanced particle losses from charging effects. Stack gas samples were obtained using a separate sampler designed in-house, but in this case quartz fibre filters were used as impaction substrates. Being ‘depth’ filters, these samples required a digestion step prior to analysis. Future work is planned to sample stack aerosols directly onto suitable TXRF carriers. INAA is recognised as a reference technique for the analysis of aerosol samples and offers the extremely low detection limits that are often required for ambient air measurements. Farinha and co-workers, in light of the proposed new EU daughter directive on heavy metals in the ambient air, re-examined their procedures for the determination of Cd and Hg in air filter samples.20 They noted that the determination of Hg could be compromised by the coexistence of Se in samples: a Se∶Hg ratio of 5 could introduce a relative error of around 100% in the measured Hg concentration. An improved procedure was developed for the determination of Cd. They now monitor the 336.2 keV gamma line of 115In as well as the 527.9 keV gamma line of 115Cd.
1.4 Instrumental techniques for analysis of individual particles
There is interest in determining the size and compositional distribution (major, minor and trace elements) of individual particles because of their link with respiratory diseases. However, no one technique is available that can provide the complete picture. For example, online and real-time sizing can be obtained using aerosol TOFMS techniques. Qualitative information about the composition of particles can also be obtained. EXPMA is widely used to quantitatively determine the major elements in individual particles. However, there is an awareness that transition metals may play a key role in biological reactions and that they are often at trace levels in environmental particles. Furthermore, it may be important to identify the source of these particles which, in certain cases, are only distinguishable on the basis of their particular trace element content. Two emerging technique for the determination of trace elements in individual particles are µXRF and µPIXE. Vincze21 and co-workers demonstrated that it is possible to determine the trace element content of individual fly ash particles in the 20–60 µm size range using both X-ray tube and synchrotron radiation excitation sources. With the SR source, detection limits were in the range 10–100 ppm. The quantitative evaluation of the data is based upon an iterative Monte Carlo simulation using a combination of a priori assumptions for the shape and physical measurements to estimate diameters, average density and organic content of individual fly ash particles. The simulation model was validated using NIST K961 glass microspheres (nominal 32 µm diameter), resulting in uncertainties of 3–10%. Uncertainties obtained on the analysis of individual coal and wood fly ash particles were estimated to be in the 5–30% range. Belgian researchers used µPIXE and proton backscattering techniques to track the fate of Siberian aerosols.22 They were able to identify K- and Cl-rich particles containing high concentrations of heavy metals, which they attributed to the heavy metals industry in Central Siberia. There is growing evidence that the surface chemistry of particles may play a major part in biological reactivity. Kendall and co-workers have investigated the interaction of surfaces of fine atmospheric particles (PM 2.5) with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) using XPS.23 They noticed that nitrate, ammonium and sulfate ions were removed from the surface of particles upon immersion in BALF. They also observed interactions between components in BALF and particles by an increase in a signal they attributed to an amide group, suggesting that protein or other nitrogen-containing molecules from BALF had adsorbed onto the surface of the particles.
1.5 Organometallic and metalloid species
Researchers at the University of Pau have now turned their attention to measuring volatile metal species in stack gas samples from a coal combustion plant. Experiments were carried out using their cryogenic sampling system in conjunction with an off-line GC-ICP-MS analysis method.24 They detected Cu, Hg, Se and Sn in these cryogenic traps. Higher concentrations of these metals were found in impinger samplers taken in parallel. The impinger samplers would have collected gaseous, gaseous-bound and sub-micron particulate material, i.e., material which would have passed through the prefilter assembly. The cryogenic sampler would ideally have collected only gaseous species. In a frank discussion, the authors outline the technical difficulties in sampling such a harsh environment and noted that the lack of standards in this area can hinder both qualitative and quantitative measurements. Researchers in Britain have described an alternative sampling procedure for a less demanding application. Using a Tedlar gasbag sampling system they collected landfill gas from a domestic waste site.25 In the laboratory, gas samples were adsorbed onto a cooled sorbent trap (Porapak Q) followed by rapid liberation onto a porous layer open tubular GC column (PLOT). A programmed thermal desorption step was used and analytes of interest detected using an AED. This approach has a number of advantages. The switching valve between the sorbent trap and the GC column allows venting of the unwanted gas matrix components, thus protecting the GC column from contamination. The switching valve also ensures that helium carrier gas is continuously flowing through the system, thus maintaining system stability. Although the work primarily focused on the determination of sulfur species, chromatographic peaks ascribed to arsenic and antimony species were found. The presence of these elements in leachate samples taken from the same site was confirmed by HGAAS and quantification of these volatile species is being attempted. Ito and Shooter have developed a novel version of the conventional impinger sampler.26 They sampled ambient air through a standard ICP concentric nebuliser into a modified Scott-type spray chamber. Particulates were prefiltered from the air stream using a 0.2 µm teflon filter. A 1%
(v/v) nitric acid solution was used to form the aerosol that was collected in a plastic bottle attached to the drain of the spray chamber and subsequently analysed off-line by ICP-MS. A UV lamp was mounted in the modified spray chamber to decompose organometallic species. Evaluation of this sampler is continuing.
1.6 Certified reference materials
It was noticeable this year, as in previous Updates, that a large number of papers published in this area continue to contain little or no information about the quality of results produced. This hinders the assessment of new analytical methodologies and the comparability of results obtained in different locations. A major problem has been the lack of suitable certified reference materials. Progress is now being made to fill these gaps. NIST have made available two new bulk reference dusts, SRM 2583 and 2584. These originate from samples collected from houses surveyed during a lead abatement programme. They are certified for a range of metals and will be suitable for indoor air quality studies. The certified ambient air filter produced in association with the IAEA in Vienna is now available as SRM 2783. Ambient dust was collected, jet milled and an aqueous slurry prepared. Filters were then prepared by passing known volumes of the homogenized slurry through filters that were subsequently dried. However, attempts are continuing to produce more realistic filter reference materials. NIST is leading a project in which gram quantities of PM2.5 material have been collected using an ultra-high-volume cyclonic sampler. There are plans to recover this material from the filters, homogenize it and re-suspend it in a controlled atmosphere for subsequent resampling onto 37-mm diameter quartz fibre filters. The IRRM in Geel has taken a more direct approach. High volume PM10 samplers were used to collect airborne particulate matter and a number of 35-mm diameter filter circles were then cut from each high volume filter. These filters are undergoing certification and should be available in the first half of 2003.
2 Water analysis
Publications in the area of environmental water analysis using spectroscopic instrumentation are summarised in Table 1. No major technological developments in the instrumentation used have been reported over the period of this Update. The primary focus has been on new applications of existing instrumental methods. Important advances in the understanding of environmental water analysis have been documented, including: a greater understanding of mercury speciation analysis; the use of ICP-MS instrumentation containing dynamic reaction cell (DRC) technology for the analysis of samples with problematic matrices; methods for taking real-time pollutant measurements; and the certification of new RMs.

The most widely studied elements in this year's review are those of toxicological interest, e.g., As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se and Sn. Multi-elemental methods for various elements in different water matrices have also appeared in the literature. As noted in last year's review27 many of these analytical methods are based on the use of solid phase extraction employing small columns of differing types, in conjunction with a chelating agent to sequester the analyte of interest, retaining it on the column. This allows interfering ions, which are not retained on the column, to be removed, while the analytes can be concentrated prior to elution, effectively bringing their concentration within the detection limit of the instrumentation being used. Conventional FAAS is often utilised in conjunction with on-line FI. This approach has been used for many years and the methods detailed in Table 1 provide little new development save for new column materials. However, these methods do allow widely available instrumentation to be used to solve difficult analytical problems, such as the determination of trace elements in sea-water.

Speciation methods have been reported, particularly for As, Cr, Hg and Sn, where there are marked differences in toxicity between the species commonly occurring in the environment, e.g., CrVI is much more toxic than CrIII, and also for distinguishing between elemental and organometallic species, e.g., Sn is non-toxic whereas organotin species are highly toxic. The most significant step forward in this area is the greater use of speciated isotope dilution calibration methods, where the chemical species of interest is quantified using a standard containing a different isotope of the analyte. This methodology must obviously use mass spectrometry as the detection method so that the isotope ratio can be measured. The great advantage of this approach is demonstrated by the recent work of Heumann's group,28 where problems in the derivatisation of mercury prior to GC measurement have been highlighted and overcome by the use of an enriched isotopic standard of methylmercury chloride.
2.1 Sample preparation

2.1.1 Sample collection and preservation. 
Sampling is an often overlooked part of the analytical process, so it is encouraging to see some good papers in this area, particularly when they introduce important new approaches to sample acquisition.

In situ passive sampling using a membrane has been compared to a conventional composite bottle sampling method for sampling urban stormwater runoff.29 The membrane sampler yields the metal concentrations corresponding to the electrochemically available fraction of the total metal. Moreover, it provides improved accuracy compared with bottle sampling because contamination during sample transport and handling is minimised. Laboratory handling is reduced by direct determination of the accumulated metals on the receiving membrane by LA-ICP-MS. This type of instrumentation and expertise is becoming more available because of the maturity of the technique. A study of the extraction fraction (EF) of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb sampled from wastewater by a concentric microdialysis probe equipped with one of two polysulfone membranes has been presented.30 Various factors, e.g., pH and concentration of ligands, were investigated and a number of applications can be envisaged. Ma et al.31 applied the collodion film method to the sampling of single rain drops. Elemental analysis of the rain drop nuclei and pollutants in the liquid phase by PIXE and micro-PIXE showed the presence of Ca, S and Fe.
An interesting in situ approach to the measurement of UVI in groundwater has been reported.32 The instrumentation comprised a remote fibre-optic flow cell and a small length of cation exchange membrane, which permits diffusion of the uranyl ions into an internally renewable solution of Arsenazo III. The U ions form a colorimetric complex with the reagent, which is measured via a fiber-optic cell coupled to a LED. High concentrations of calcium and thorium were shown to interfere with the measurement and a detection limit for UVI of 1 µg l−1 was reported. Various applications can be envisaged for this approach and it would be interesting to consider other elements that could be detected in a similar way.
New field sampling techniques have many applications in environmental science, particularly for sampling water in remote or inaccessible places. A simple and apparently effective technique has been described for the field sampling of arsenite in water.33 Arsenite is co-precipitated with dibenzyldithiocarbamate and recovered by filtration prior to quantitative release by oxidation to arsenate followed by measurement using ICP-MS. Arsenate in the sample does not interfere with the methodology, which effectively stabilises arsenite during transit and storage. A simple field-flow preconcentration method for the determination of Cu in sea-water has been reported.34 Samples are pumped through mini-columns packed with Amberlite XAD-4 impregnated with 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol, which retains the Cu but not the saline matrix. The mini-columns are returned to the laboratory and the Cu eluted with a small volume of an ethanolic hydrochloric acid solution and determined by FI-AAS. The methodology was validated by analysis of the CRMs SLEW-3 and NASS-5. The authors have also reported similar systems for the determination of Pb35 and Cd in sea-water.36 Kaneko et al.37 have proposed a new method for the determination of Pb in water samples that could be further developed as a field test kit. The Pb is extracted from a 1 ml solution using a microtube and reacted with a fluorescent ligand, which is measured spectrophotometrically.
A review of present knowledge about errors at specific stages in the sample preparation procedure, derived from environmental research and national monitoring programmes in Belgium, has appeared.38 A useful report on sample collection, filtration and preservation protocols for the determination of total dissolved Hg in water samples has been published.39 From an economic perspective the study identified HDPE or PP as the bottles of choice for storage of water samples before analysis. Twelve 0.45 µm filter systems were evaluated in terms of their potential for Hg contamination and their retention of Hg during filtration of river samples. The blank values indicated that contamination was not a problem, but different recoveries of Hg were obtained. The systems providing maximum recovery values (80%) were based on the hydrophilic Durapore® membrane and the lowest recoveries (<40%) were found with nylon type filters. Different approaches to the preservation of Hg in different water samples were tested. Mercury was stable for 28 d in 0.5% BrCl, but the other systems tested showed a loss of ca. 20% over this time period. The preservation of inorganic As speciation in drinking water by using EDTA has been reported.40 This work shows that the stability of AsIII and AsV is significantly affected by the presence of iron oxyhydroxides, which can form a precipitate during sample transport and quantitatively remove the dissolved arsenic in 18 h. The addition of EDTA virtually eliminated this loss by sequestering the iron present in the sample. This approach was tested on three well waters with differing AsIII∶AsV ratios, with the most dramatic conversion of AsIII to AsV of 2 ppb over a 30 d period. All the well waters not treated with EDTA had losses of a factor 2–5 in less than 1 d.


2.1.2 Preconcentration and separation procedures. 
As noted in last year's review27 and as touched upon above, a large number of publications detail the use of preconcentration methods based on short columns packed with a chromatographic or absorbent solid phase. The elements of interest are removed from the sample by the column, usually on-line or by using a flow-injection approach, and the matrix flows to waste. The analytes are then eluted and determined, often by FAAS or ICP-MS. Applications involving different refinements of this general approach are detailed in Table 1. These include: modification of the solid phase to enhance or render it more specific to the analyte; the use of ligands or chelating agents to enhance uptake of a metal–ligand complex; and selective elution of different physiochemical forms of the analyte to provide speciation data.
An interesting method for simultaneous analyte preconcentration and matrix removal using field-flow fractionation, coupled to ICP-MS, has been published.41 A high molecular weight compound added to the sample prior to analysis complexes the analytes, which remain in the analysis channel of the field-flow fractionation unit, while the uncomplexed matrix elements are removed by permeation through a membrane. Preconcentration factors of 50–1400 fold were reported for the determination of As, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, Re, Sn, Te, Tl, Y, Zn and Zr in the presence of 5000 mg l−1 Ca or Na.
The use of solid phase microextraction
(SPME) continues to be reported. In the current context SPME relates to the use of modified fibres attached within a dedicated holder, similar in size to a large GC injection syringe. This type of preconcentration technique has mainly been applied to metal speciation via GC separation coupled to atomic spectroscopic detection. Aguerre et al.42 reported the optimisation of SPME with GC-ICP-MS for the speciation of butyl- and phenyltin compounds in waste water samples. The optimised method gave detection limits in the range 1–42 ng l−1 as Sn for the compounds tested. A similar method has been reported for the simultaneous determination of organotin (butyl- and phenyltin) and organolead (methyl- and ethyllead) compounds using SPME and GC-ICP-AE detection. The derivatisation was carried out in situ using a 20 ml sample and tetrapropylborate, which converts all the analytes to the corresponding alkylpropyl derivative. The gaseous products were then sampled from the closed system by headspace analysis using a SPME fibre. Different optimization experiments were carried out to find the best reaction temperature (room temperature) and reaction time (20 min). Under these conditions detection limits of 0.2 ng l−1 as metal were reported. In a move away from speciation methods using chromatography coupled to atomic spectroscopy, a validated SPME-TOF-ICP-MS procedure for determining the anti-fouling paint additive tributyltin in sea-water with a detection limit of 5.8 ng l−1 was developed.43 The relatively high vapour pressure of the TBTCl compound allowed its sampling via headspace analysis using SPME.


2.1.3 Hydride generation methods. 
Several interesting publications have appeared over the last year, which deal with the determination of different elements and their species in water samples, using hydride generation or cold vapour generation. Organometallic species may require conversion to a form which can produce a hydride. As a result of the sample being introduced to the instrument as a vapour or gas, lower detection limits compared with those from solution nebulisation are obtained. Moreover, trapping methods can be used to preconcentrate the analyte, or separate it from other metal containing species or the matrix.
A method for the measurement of total Hg levels in sea-water that can be used on-board ship has been reported.44 An on-line CV-AAS system using a drying unit and gold amalgamation gave detection limits of 1 ng l−1 and a long-term stability of 6.2% RSD over 12 h. A similar method has been reported for the determination of Se in mineral water samples.45 Gold wire was used to trap the selenium hydride produced prior to thermal desorption into AAS or AFS instrumentation. A detection limit of 5 ng l−1 was achieved with a precision of 3.0% RSD (n
= 14). Another interesting method for the measurement of selenium uses in situ trapping of selenium hydride on a rhodium-coated tungsten coil, prior to detection with ETV-AAS.46 This approach extended the coil lifetime to 2000 firings. A detection limit of 50 ng l−1 was achieved and the method was validated by analysis of the NIST SRM 1640 (trace elements in natural water).

Multi-elemental hydride generation methods have been developed in the past year. As, Sb, and Se have been determined in water samples using HG-AAS.47 An automated hydride generation cryogenic trap ICP-MS system was developed for measuring inorganic and methylated species of As, Ge and Sb in marine and fresh waters.48

2.2 Speciation
A number of speciation methods using reductive vapour generation sample introduction
(HG and CV) have been described since the last review. The speciation of Sb using stibine generation and ICP-AES or sector field ICP-MS detection was possible by determining the antimony concentration under different pH conditions and calculating SbV by the difference between SbIII and total Sb.49 A HG-AFS method for the determination of inorganic arsenic species in natural water samples used FI and a knotted-reactor to preconcentrate and separate the species.50 This involved the on-line formation of the AsIII–pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDC) complex in acidic conditions, adsorption onto the inner walls of the reactor, elution with HCl, and detection by HG-AFS. Total inorganic As was determined after prereduction of AsV to AsIII with L-cysteine. The concentration of AsV was calculated by the difference of the total inorganic arsenic and AsIII.
Speciation methods based on the use of liquid chromatography coupled to atomic spectroscopy have been described. A review on the speciation of aluminium in freshwater51 cited 130 papers dealing with aspects of aluminium toxicity and the methods, similar to those described here, which have been used to measure aluminium in water samples. Ion chromatography coupled via a conductivity detector to ICP-MS has been used to determine nitrate, sulfate, halide ions and As in drinking water.52 A multi-elemental speciation method for the measurement of toxic metal species has been reported.53 Anion-exchange chromatography coupled to ICP-MS detection was used to determine arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, selenite, selenate and hexavalent chromium in water samples. Gradient elution was used to baseline separate all the analytes. The limit of detection was reported to range from 40 ng l−1 to 1 µg l−1. A new gas–liquid separator for the determination of AsIII, AsV, MMAA and DMAA in river water using HPLC coupled to HG-AFS gave detection limits of 50–70 ng l−1.54 The speciation of an unusual Se species, selenocyanate, along with SeIV and SeVI, in petroleum refinery waste and waste from a gold mine used anion-exchange HPLC coupled to HG-AFS to give detection limits of 26–34 ng l−1 for all three Se species.55 The selenoamino acids and oxidation states of inorganic Se have been determined using reversed-phase HPLC coupled to UV-HG-AFS. Irradiation by UV light effectively converts the organometallic Se to an inorganic form, which more readily forms a hydride with sodium borohydride. The detection limits were in the range 0.3–0.7 µg l−1. An on-line method for the separation and determination of SbV and Me3Sb in the presence of SbIII used anion-exchange HPLC coupled to hydride generation AFS.56
Significant contributions to the literature have been made on speciation methods using gas chromatography coupled to atomic spectroscopy. A report on the speciation of Hg shows that the commonly used GC methods based on ethylation can underestimate the concentration of methylmercury in the sample because elemental mercury may be formed during the ethylation procedure, rather than the expected methylethylmercury compound. By using a methylmercury standard containing an enriched isotope of mercury, the authors28 were able to show that halide ions present in the sample converted Hg2+ to Hg0 in solution. The species-specific isotope dilution calibration method used was not only able to identify this decomposition, but could also correct for it. The analytical method finally developed used propylation rather than ethylation, because this did not lead to the formation of elemental Hg from methylmercury. It is easy to see how isotopically enriched metal containing compounds can be used to improve metal speciation analysis, both in the validation of existing methods and in the certification of reference materials with lower uncertainties.
Three gas chromatographic detectors
(MS, MIP-AES, ICP-TOF-MS) have been compared for the determination of organolead speciation in rainwater samples.57 The most sensitive methodology, with absolute detection limits of 15 fg as Pb of organolead compound using 5-ml sample volumes, was GC-ICP-TOF-MS. Intrinsically, GC-MS was the most specific option, because the species could be detected directly from molecular information. However, GC-MS could not measure the compounds of interest in non-polluted samples, which was possible with the other systems tested. The determination of organolead compounds in snowmelt water by GC-ICP-TOF-MS produced detection limits of 10–15 fg as Pb.58 A broad range of organotin compounds present in harbour water from the southeastern coast of India has been quantified by GC-ICP-MS.59 Detection limits in the range 19–85 fg l−1 were reported for butyl-, phenyl- and octyltin. A conventional GC flame photometric detector was used to determine methyltin species in water.60 The volatile methyltin hydrides were measured by a GC-FPD system with a purge-and-trap injector that gave detection limits of 3–18 ng l−1.
A review of the importance of speciation analysis of heavy metals in natural waters has been published,61 as has a review (420 references) detailing the environmental chemistry and concentration of Sb in fresh, marine and estuarine waters, as well as soil and sediments.62 A review and commentary on chronic arsenic exposure in Bangladesh and West Bengal highlights groundwater in 59 districts having arsenic levels greater than the WHO maximum permissible concentration.63 The authors estimate that this problem affects a staggering 148 million people in this study area alone and go on to give detailed clinical effects of arsenic poisoning in the population. A different paper on this subject reports the arsenic speciation in tube-well water samples collected from West Bengal, India.64 HPLC coupled to ICP-MS detection was used to separate AsIII and AsV and two methylated forms. The total As concentration in the water samples was measured by FI-ICP-MS. Low concentrations of the methylated forms (<2 ppb) and high concentrations of the inorganic forms (>300 ppb) were found and the total As concentration agreed with the sum of the four individual species to within 10%.
2.3 Instrumental analysis

2.3.1 Atomic absorption spectrometry. 
A number of applications using electrothermal or flame AAS for the measurement of metals in different types of water sample have been reported over the period covered by this Update. However, many of these methods are similar to established procedures and are therefore only listed in Table 1 and not discussed further.
Moreno et al.65 reported the use of an electrochemical flow-cell for the permanent modification of a graphite tube with palladium. The modified tube was used to trap elemental mercury produced from the reduction of rain, potable and non-potable water samples, prior to analysis by ETA-AAS. The absolute detection limit produced was 26 pg of mercury and the method was validated by comparing the analysis of spiked samples with a CV-AAS method.
Other ETA-AAS methods for the analysis of metals in water samples are worth consideration. Trace levels of barium in river water have been determined using magnesium nitrate as a matrix modifier and a lanthanum-coated graphite tube.66 The determination of chromium in river water by ETA-AAS, after preconcentration on a tantalum wire, overcame the interference from matrix elements present in the samples at 103–104 fold excess and generated a detection limit of 15 ng l−1.67 The speciation of chromium has been facilitated by selective absorption of CrIII on a cellulose micro-column prior to analysis. Total chromium was subsequently determined after reduction of CrVI to CrIII, thus allowing determination of both species by difference.68 Yeast has been used to concentrate silver in water samples prior to analysis by ETA-AAS.69 Tributyltin has been selectively retained on an Amberlite XAD-2 column modified with tropolone in the presence of sulfuric acid, prior to analysis of the tin content by ETA-AAS.70 The method achieved a detection limit of 14 ng l−1 and a recovery of 100% for the analysis of freshwater samples.
An ETA-AAS method for the simultaneous determination of As, Cu, Mn, Sb and Se using a transversely heated graphite tube atomiser and Zeeman background correction has been validated using a NIST CRM.71


2.3.2 Atomic emission and atomic fluorescence. 
A modification to the liquid sample introduction system, involving a vertical cyclonic spray chamber/Nafion membrane-based desolvation system, was used to eliminate the nitric acid interference in ICP-AES.72 Three different matrices were studied: water, and solutions containing 0.9 and 3.6 mol l−1 of nitric acid. The cyclonic spray chamber was heated at 100 °C and the membrane at 60 °C using air as dryer gas. The new desolvation system accepted an increase in nitric acid concentration, without a change in the emission signal, regardless of the element and line. Hence, elements in these matrices could be calibrated with standards prepared with de-ionized water. In order to test the plasma excitation conditions, the intensity ratio of the Cr II 267.716 nm and Cr I 357.869 nm lines was measured for each combination of desolvation system and matrix. Standard configurations of desolvation systems were also evaluated, and the depressive effect of nitric acid could only be eliminated when working at a high spray chamber temperature and/or low liquid flow.
Some notable ICP-AES applications involving analyte preconcentration have been reported. The determination of molybdenum in sea-water by ICP-OES has been improved by carrying out factorial optimisation experiments.73 Four variables (solution volume, shaking time, thiocyanate concentration and hydrochloric acid concentration) were optimised to achieve greater selectivity during the preconcentration of MoV as the thiocyanate complex using polyurethane foam in the presence of the saline matrix. A microcolumn packed with nanometer TiO2 as solid phase extractant has been developed for the simultaneous preconcentration of Cu, Mn and Ni from lake water, prior to measurement by ICP-OES.74 Preconcentration of Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn on Amberlite XAD-4 resin coated with different dithiocarbamate ligands has been used for the determination of trace concentrations in saline matrices by ICP-OES.75 A poly(acrylphenylamidrazone-phenylhydrazide) chelating fiber has been used for the enrichment of AuIII and RuIII ions from solutions containing Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn and Zn in 200–1000 fold excess, followed by measurement by ICP-OES.76 The fiber could be re-used eight times and gave acceptable recoveries for the metals under investigation. The US Department of Agriculture77 compared ICP-MS and ICP-AES for the determination of the trace element composition of municipal water in the United States. Municipal waters around the US were sampled during three different seasons and analysed for Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, V and Zn using the two techniques. The two sets of data agreed well and no real significant seasonal variability was identified. The study highlighted the fact that water is not a significant source of most trace elements in the US diet.


2.3.3 X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. 
Fewer reports of the use of XRF for the analysis of metals in water have appeared this year. Methods for the determination of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ga, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn impurities in wastewater samples by XRF analysis have been reported.78 For the direct determination of impurities in the samples, quasi-solid specimens based on gelatin (agar) were prepared and methods to form organogels and thin films from water samples were also investigated. Total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) was used to measure the trace metal concentrations of mineral spring waters in central Anatolia, Turkey, using gallium as an internal standard.79 The elemental concentrations obtained by TXRF were comparable to results obtained by both ICP-MS and GFAAS after separation and preconcentration on an Amberlite XAD-4 column. X-ray electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) techniques have been investigated for the analysis of surface and groundwaters.80


2.3.4 Mass spectrometry. 
2.3.4.1 ICP-MS analysis. 
Reaction cell technology of different designs has now reached the stage where instrumentation is available in environmental analytical laboratories and methods are being developed to solve real analytical problems. Particularly interesting in this respect are a series of papers reporting the use of reaction cells for the determination of various metals in difficult matrices such as sea-water.
Leonhard et al.81 determined metals in sea-water using an ICP-MS instrument equipped with an octopole reaction/collision cell. The use of He or H2 as the collision gas reduced serious polyatomic interferences from matrix elements, e.g., ArCl+ or ArNa+. Detection limits ranged from 0.3 ng l−1 for U to 20 ng l−1 for Fe and As in diluted sea-water. The CRMs NASS-5 and SLEW-3 were analysed for As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, U, V and Zn and the concentrations determined for most elements agreed with the certified values to within 19%, with no sample pre-treatment other than dilution. An instrument equipped with a DRC has been used to determine the total concentration of V and its oxidation states in sea-water.82 The potentially interfering polyatomic ions ClO+ and SOH+ at the V m/z value of 51 were reduced in intensity by approximately four orders of magnitude by using NH3 as the reaction cell gas, giving a detection limit for V of 6 ng l−1. Speciation of the oxidation states of V was carried out using reversed phase ion-pair HPLC coupled to ICP-MS detection. The limits of detection for VIV and VV were 7.0 and 13.0 ng l−1, respectively. Values for V in the CRMs SLRS-3 (River Water), SLEW-2 (Estuarine Water) and locally collected water samples agreed satisfactorily with the reference values. Further work by this research group has focused on the determination of total Cr and the speciation of Cr oxidation states in sea-water using an instrument equipped with a DRC.83,84 The polyatomic ions ArC+, ClOH+, SO+, ArCH+ and ClO+ that potentially interfere with the Cr isotopes at m/z 52 and 53 were reduced in intensity by approximately 2–3 orders of magnitude by using NH3 as reaction cell gas. Limits of detection for 52Cr and 53Cr were 15.0 and 24.0 ng l−1, respectively. The method was used to determine Cr in the CRM SLRS-3 and SRM 1643d.83 Reversed-phase HPLC coupled to ICP-MS was used to determine the Cr oxidation states in water samples.84 The DRC reduced possible polyatomic interferences by 3 orders of magnitude to generate detection limits based on a peak height of 60 ng l−1 for both Cr species. Louie et al.85 used a DRC instrument with ammonia reaction gas to determine Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and V in sea-water. Good recoveries were obtained for Cr, Mn and V in diluted sea-water and the CRMs CASS-4, NASS-4 and SLEW-3. Polyatomic interferences were reduced significantly but not completely for Cu and Ni, giving rise to a small positive bias.
Applications using instrumentation with mass analysers other than those based on quadrupole ion separation, such as time-of-flight (TOF) and sector field ICP-MS, have also been reported. The determination of transition and REE in sea-water by flow injection ICP-TOF-MS was validated for selected transition elements by analysis of the CRMs NASS-5 and CASS-4. Recoveries of the REEs from sea-water were between 96 and 101% and limits of detection were in the 20–50 pg 1−1 range.86 Magnetic sector ICP-MS with a desolvating nebuliser was used to determine 230Th and 231Pa with a detection limit sufficiently low that these elements could be determined in deep ocean water, thus providing important information on oceanic circulation and mixing rates.87 Volpe et al. deployed ICP-MS on-board ship for the first time for the real-time analysis of marine surface waters.88
The use of ICP-MS allows powerful calibration methods such as isotope dilution analysis to be employed for the determination of analyte concentrations with low uncertainty values. An on-line flow injection method for the direct determination of silver in sea-water by ID-ICP-MS has been described.89 A mini-column packed with Dowex 1-X8 anion exchange resin was used to separate and concentrate Ag from sea-water. Recoveries of 96 and 100% were obtained for the CRMs SLEW-3 and CASS-4, respectively, and the detection limit was 60 pg l−1. Yamada et al.90 investigated the simultaneous determination of Cd, Cu and Pb in river water samples by ID-ICP-MS following preconcentration of the analytes on a chelating resin.
2.3.4.2 Other MS methods. 
The Ca isotopic composition of “modern” Atlantic Ocean water has been determined by TIMS.91 A rapid method for measuring the abundance of the 15N nitrate ion in contaminated groundwater samples employed a super-absorbent polymer resin powder to collect the nitrate.92 The resin was oven dried and analysed directly using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to an elemental analyser. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) was used to measure 14C in sea-water samples near radioactive waste dumping sites.93 Data on 14C and 3H concentrations in samples from former dumping sites in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans are described and compared.

2.4 Metrology and data quality
This section deals with current thinking on the use of quality systems in the analysis of water and, in particular, the use and certification of CRMs. The justification for developing a strong metrological basis for analytical measurements involving spectroscopic analysis is discussed by De Bievre et al.94 They report the conclusions resulting from the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) International Measurement Program (IMEP) for trace elements in water (IMEP rounds 3, 6 and 9). The trials are performed using the participants' chosen spectroscopic techniques, which in this case were ETA-AAS, FAAS, ICP-AES and ICP-MS. Participants of the IMEP rounds are required to report values for specific elements in the round-robin water samples, along with a statement of the uncertainty for the analytical procedure used. The study showed that more than 50% of the results and their stated uncertainties do not overlap with the uncertainty range of the certified reference value for the samples. Analysis of the IMEP-9 intercomparison sample (trace elements in natural water) for cadmium and lead performed by nine national metrology institutes using only isotope dilution calibration has been reported.95
Work on a number of CRMs has been published over the period of this Update. New data for Si and thirty-one trace elements (Ag, B, Br, Cs, Ga, Ge, Li, Pd, Rb, Se, Th, Ti, Tl, W, Y, Zr and the REEs) in the natural water RM SLRS-4, available from the Canadian NRC, has been compiled along with the associated uncertainty values.96 None of these elements was originally certified in this RM. High-resolution ID-MS with a sector-field ICP-MS instrument was used for the certification of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in an estuary water RM (LGC6016).97 Certified values were initially calculated using a consensus mean from 14 laboratories but this was found to be unsatisfactory due to the large discrepancies in the reported concentrations. The material was re-analysed using ID-ICP-MS techniques. A conventional quadrupole ICP-MS was used to determine Cd and Pb, whereas Cu, Ni and Zn were determined using a magnetic sector ICP-MS, which allowed significant polyatomic interferences to be overcome. For example, the high Na content interferes with 63Cu through the formation of ArNa+ and Na2OH+, which in a conventional quadrupole instrument would cause an erroneous increase in signal intensity. For each analyte a combined uncertainty of 2–3% was found, which represents a 10-fold improvement compared to certification by inter-laboratory comparison. The combined uncertainty budget indicates that most of the systematic uncertainty derived from the instrumental isotope ratio measurements.
An intercomparison exercise concluded that sampling and sample handling were weak links in the trace metal analysis of sea-water and that the analytical methods are satisfactory for the accurate determination of Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn and Pb.98 The quality of quantitative and semiquantitative analysis by ICP-MS was investigated by analysis of the SLRS-3 river water CRM.99 Quantitative methods were based on external calibration by simple and weighted linear regression and the semiquantitative analysis programme used internal calibration with Bi, In and Sc. Results from the three quantification methods for the elements studied agreed with certified values. Relative uncertainties obtained by semiquantitative analysis ranged from 20%, for concentrations around the LOQ, to 6% for concentrations 100 times higher than the LOQ.
3 Analysis of soils, plants and related materials
This section of the review covers what the authors believe to be the most significant developments in analytical methodology for the analysis of soils and plant tissue samples. In places, however, it also covers analysis of sediments and some other environmental materials where the information would be of interest to analysts primarily concerned with soils and plants. Much of the review covers what the authors perceive to be interestingly novel applications, rather than instrumental developments per se. At times this means that individual papers may be relevant in more than one section, and the reader should bear this in mind when looking for a particular topic. For example, some sample preparation developments may feature as an integral part of a novel application of a particular analytical technique, such as ICP-MS or ICP-AES.
3.1 Sample preparation

3.1.1 Sample dissolution procedures. 

Sample preparation is the most critical part of most analyses because it is responsible for the largest and often hidden sources of errors. An excellent review on preparation steps in trace element environmental analysis has been published.38 It summarizes present knowledge about the possibilities and the potential errors in preparation steps. Possible effects of the preparation procedure on the quality of measurement are also systematically discussed.
As in past Environmental Updates, the use of reagents to co-precipitate trace elements from water or sediment samples has reappeared. A cerium(IV) hydroxide co-precipitation method has been developed100 for the determination of Cd, Co, Cu, Ni and Pb in aqueous solutions, water and sediment samples by FAAS. The procedure was validated by analysing the sediment SRM, GBW 07309.
Many papers on microwave-assisted digestion continue to appear. It is well known that the complete dissolution of samples that contain silicates in their matrix (e.g., soils, sediments, plants) is difficult and cannot be ensured by a simple procedure. Therefore one major advantage of open-vessel acid digestion, unlike the conventional closed-vessel high pressure methods, is that it allows HF to be used to remove Si from geological and plant samples as volatile SiF4. The application of open vessel focused microwave acid digestion has been described for the preparation of geological and environmental samples for analysis using ICP-MS.101
In another noteworthy study, Yehl et al.102,103 described the microwave-assisted extraction of monomethylarsonic acid from soil and sediment SRMs. Arsenic-containing species were extracted from soil and sediment SRM by a mixture (1 + 1) of acetone and HCl (10% v/v) in a sealed vessel in a microwave oven during heating to 160 °C at pressures up to 1150 kPa (160 psi). Following separation by anion-exchange HPLC, those species that gave a volatile derivative on reaction with borohydride in acid were detected by plasma-source MS. For 1 + 1 mixtures of acetone + 5% HCl, methanol + 5% HCl, and propan-2-ol + 5% HCl, recoveries ranged from 91% to 112%. Similar recoveries were obtained for ultrasound-assisted extractions with the same solvents.
Some workers have investigated104 the application of a micro-digestion device for elemental analysis of biological samples by adapting a commercially available piece of equipment for high-pressure ashing for the digestion of micro-samples of biological origin. The attachment, which is reported to be suitable for solids and liquids, was tested by analyzing two RMs: NBS SRM 1571 Orchard Leaves and BCR CRM 414 Plankton.104
Xu and co-researchers105 have described a fully alkaline procedure, including alkaline fusion, pre-reduction of SeVI to SeIV in alkaline medium and an alkaline mode of H2Se generation, together with ICP-AES for the determination of total Se in biological and environmental samples. The major advantage of the alkaline fusion coupled with alkaline mode hydride generation is that the volatile losses of Se are avoided by changing it into soluble salts such as selenate or selenite. Also, the chemical interferences from the co-existing transition metals Cu, Fe and Mn are eliminated. The method was verified with a CRM and successfully applied to several “real” samples, such as Se-enriched plasma, egg, animal feeds and soils.
Papers reporting the results of a comparison of different digestion methods resurfaced this year. Sun and co-workers106 compared different digestion methods for the total decomposition of siliceous and organic environmental samples prior to their analysis by ICP-OES. In the paper, microwave-assisted, hotplate heating and pressurized digestion in pressure bombs were employed for the determination of nine heavy metals in sediment, soil, sludge and oil. Microwave-assisted digestions yielding recoveries of all elements >85% with various combinations of HNO3–HCl–HF and HNO3–HCIO4–HF were considered to be viable alternatives to conventional digestion systems because of their more intensive reaction conditions. Three digestion methods were reported107 for the FI-HG-AAS determination of Te in sludges and road dust after preconcentration. A mineralisation procedure using a microwave oven proved to be the most efficient sample preparation technique, with recovery values from 98 ± 2% to 103 ± 4%. Good agreement was observed between the certified values for a RM and the measured values. Three decomposition procedures were evaluated108 for the determination of Cr, Ni and V in biological matrices (earthworms, feathers, lucerne). In a noteworthy paper, Krachler and co-workers109 evaluated four analytical approaches for the determination of Sb and As in ancient peat samples. They observed that INAA underestimated the values in a systematic manner, whereas HG-AAS and sector field-ICP-MS data agreed very well. For the quantification of As and Sb, ICP-MS was preferred over INAA and HG-AAS. Regardless of the digestion method selected, instrumental methods should be optimized for the procedure finally used. Kalembkiewicz and Sitarz-Palczak110 established the optimum conditions for total Mn determination in soil by FAAS.
Over the past decade, several groups have advocated that slurries may be analyzed directly, eliminating, or at least minimizing, many of the problems associated with sample dissolution. Again this year a paper111 appeared reporting the determination of Pb concentration in lake sediment samples by means of ultrasonic slurry sampling ETAAS. In another study,112 Cd and Pb in plant tissue were determined by transversely-heated ETAAS with Zeeman background correction using automated ultrasonic slurry sampling.
Batch sequential extraction techniques for fractionating metals or metalloids in soils are time consuming and subject to several potential errors. A noteworthy paper113 has described the fractionation of As in soil by a continuous-flow sequential extraction method, with the benefits of simplicity, speed, less risk of contamination, and less vulnerability to changes in extraction conditions compared with traditional batch methods.
Soylak and co-workers114 described a sensitive and simple separation-enrichment technique for the determination of trace amounts of Cd, Co, Cu, Fe and Mn. Metal ions were complexed with 1-nitroso-2-naphthol at pH 9. Following solid phase extraction on Diaion HP-20 resin, metals were determined by FAAS and recoveries >95% were obtained.


3.1.2 Speciation. 
It has long been accepted that the determination of total concentrations of elements in environmental samples does not give an accurate estimation of the potential environmental impact of such elements. As in previous years, papers on speciation continue to proliferate, indicating the vital importance of information about bioavailability and toxicity that is hopefully provided by such studies. A method for the determination of arsenic species
(arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA) in environmental solid samples by ion-exchange LC coupled on-line to an AF spectrometer through HG has been developed.115 Detection limits ranging from 0.02 to 0.04 mg As kg−1 for all species in all matrices were obtained. Excellent (90–100%) recoveries of total As were obtained for sediment and sludge RMs, whereas yield did not exceed 62% for a soil RM. The method was applied to the determination of As species in orthophosphoric acid extracts of three RMs (river sediment, agricultural soil, sewage sludge) certified for their total As content, and to real world samples.
There are still very few papers on selenium speciation studies in plants. With various Brassica species accumulating Se up to thousands of mg kg−1, it is obvious that some of them can be used for Se phytoremediation. In a very detailed paper, Montes-Bayon and co-researchers studied Se speciation in Brassica juncea by LC with ICP-MS and ES-MS detection.116 Extraction of Se species was evaluated by several digestion/extraction procedures, including the use of HCl, Tris–HCl buffer, and enzymatic hydrolysis with proteinase K and protease XIV. Some of the species produced by the plant, such as selenomethionine, can be identified at µg kg−1 levels by HPLC-ICP-MS while others needed to be further characterized by ES-MS.116 Ferri and co-workers117 optimized two methods for Se speciation studies in plants. They used differential-pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry (DPCSV) for very low Se concentrations and ICP-AES for higher concentrations. The methods were used to determine Se in fruits (capsule and seed) of a Se-enriching plant from Venezuela (Lecytis ollaria). A sequential sample preparation process was developed118 for the speciation analysis of Se-enriched edible mushroom. Five different sample extraction methods were compared and the most efficient method—a three-step process involving the use of water extraction and two proteolytic enzymes, pepsin and trypsin—had an extraction efficiency of 75%. The three-step sample preparation method, followed by use of HPLC-AFS with a high-pressure nebulizer, proved to be applicable to the speciation analysis of Se-enriched Agaricus bisponis.
Papers have been published on the speciation of rare earth elements in soil by a five-step sequential extraction procedure coupled with ICP–MS119 determination, and on the determination of fractions of Be, Ni and V in soil.120 The speciation of Cd, Cr, Pb and Zn in core and superficial sediments has also been reported.121 Li and Thornton122 reported the chemical partitioning of trace and major elements in soils that had been contaminated by mining and smelting activities. They employed a 5-step sequential extraction procedure, with multi-element determinations in extraction solutions by ICP-AES. The precision was estimated to be about 5% and the overall recovery rates were between 85 and 110%. Alvarez and co-workers studied extractable forms of heavy metal in sludge samples from wastewater treatment plants.123 They applied a sequential extraction scheme according to the BCR's guidelines to the sludge and determined 13 metals in the sludge extracts by ICP-AES. The BCR sequential extraction scheme followed by ETAAS has been applied124 to the determination of extractable Tl in soil, sediment and fly ash CRMs.
Pavlikora et al.125 studied the sequential fractionation of spinach biomass with a view to partial characterization of cadmium-binding compounds and determination of the Cd concentration in each fraction identified. They found the majority of the Cd extracted in the methanol + H2O and in H2O fractions (oligopeptides, mainly phytochelatins, extractable polypeptides, proteins) and in methanol + H2O + HCl fractions (compounds isolated from cell walls and cytoskeleton after hydrolysis).
Elik and Akcay126 reported the sequential ultrasonic leaching of strontium from sediments using the leaching scheme of Tessier. The ultrasonic leaching method (ULM) produced comparable results to a conventional procedure. In addition the ULM reduced the time required for Tessier fractionation from 21 h to 1.7 h. The recoveries of total Sr, using NIES CRM–2, ranged from 75% to 101% for the conventional procedure and 84% to 109% for the ULM.
Zhang and Shan127 evaluated the bioavailability of trace elements in five Chinese soils. They concluded that no significant relationship could be found between the bioavailability index and soil characteristics.


3.1.3 Selective extraction methods. 
Knowledge of the levels of metals available to plants has been a cornerstone of plant and soil sciences and of agronomy for decades, and consequently many indicative operationally defined extraction procedures exist. They can be divided into two groups: sequential extraction and simple extraction. Both extraction procedures are time-consuming because they need long mechanical shaking time. Nowadays, ultrasonic extraction has emerged as a good alternative to extraction procedures with mechanical shaking. In a noteworthy paper,128 total and sequential extraction procedures for As have been developed. The methods were applied to the determination of heavy metal contents in fractions and soluble metal in mud from contaminated soils.128 Six extraction agents were tested by Bajcan et al.129 for the determination of plant-available Se. The 0.1 mol l−1 KH2PO4
+ K2HPO4
(at pH 7) was reported to be the most suitable.
Arsenic mobility and transport in the environment are strongly influenced by the element's associations with the diverse solid phases in soils and sediments. Keon and co-researchers130 reported the validation of an arsenic sequential extraction method for evaluating mobility of As in sediments. They tested a procedure intended to differentiate six pools of solid phase arsenic.
A cold ultrasonic acid extraction method for extracting Cu, Pb and Zn from soil samples has been published.131 Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni and Sr were only partially extracted by the technique. Comparable results were obtained when the new method and hot-plate acid digestion method were applied to soil CRM samples.


3.1.4 Reference materials. 
The role and importance of certified reference materials cannot be overemphasized in environmental analysis. Their use has risen steadily in the past two decades. However, Jenks and Stoeppler132 surveyed 26 scientific journals and observed that only about 55% of the abstracts mention the use of CRMs! Publishers of scientific journals were requested to recommend where and how the use of CRMs should be described in abstracts. Wang and co-workers133 have reported details of certified or reference values for nearly 70 elements and element oxides prepared and characterized by the Institute of Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration. In a similar study, Gwozdz and co-workers134 have described the preparation of a candidate RM for the determination of Ir and other platinum-group elements in clays and sediments. Hammerschmidt and Fitzgerald135 have reported the formation of methylmercury as an artifact during extraction from a sediment RM. The IAEA Marine Environmental Studies Laboratory organized an inter-comparison exercise for the determination by INAA of 40 trace elements in a sediment to produce a proposed RM for environmental studies; measurement precisions of 1.8–12.3% were obtained.

3.2 Instrumental methods of analysis

3.2.1 Atomic absorption spectrometry. 
As in previous years, flame AAS still enjoys pride of place for heavy metals analysis in a number of laboratories. The flame AA spectrometric determination of Pb levels in dust and date palm in the environment of 6–10 year-old school children has been reported.136 Perez-Cid and Bola137 analyzed sediments collected from different sampling stations of the Leca River (Portugal) for Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn by FAAS. They estimated the potential mobility of metals in these samples by comparing the results of the total digestion with those obtained by single extractions using EDTA and acetic acid.
A number of papers have appeared in previous Updates comparing the levels of metals in soils and fruit samples that they produce. This year, Tokalioglu138 has reported the determination of heavy metals in soil extracts and plant tissue samples (fruits, leaves, twigs and roots) around a zinc smelter. Mercury determination is still an important aspect of many analytical chemists' jobs because of its toxicity. Duran and Adams139 reported the determination of Hg in soil samples by mineralization in aqua regia followed by CV-AAS and by direct determination on a solid matrix by pyrolysis and preconcentration using an automatic mercury analyzer (AMA). The accuracy of the AMA was assessed by analysing samples of US Geological Survey Standard rocks.
It is a source of personal nostalgic joy to the authors of this section to observe that the technique of atom trapping FAAS is still being improved upon. Sun and fellow researchers have described the determination of trace Pb in Chinese herbs by derivative atom trapping FAAS with a modified water-cooled quartz atom-trapping tube. The sensitivity of the derivative method was reported to be 2 or 3 orders of magnitude better than that of FAAS while the detection limit improved by 1–2 orders of magnitude. Satisfactory recoveries of 93–108% for Pb were obtained.140 Yaman and Dilgin141 attempted to identify the Cd phases most responsible for fruit-available Cd by determining the Cd concentration in fruit samples by slotted tube atom trap (STAT)-enrichment-FAAS. The soil samples near the fruit plants were also analyzed for Cd by using various digestion and selective extraction reagents. Acceptable agreement was found when the results by STAT-enrichment-FAAS and GF–AAS were compared.
In a useful paper from Spain, Rucandio and Petit-Dominguez142 reported the versatility of an ETAAS method for the determination of cadmium in several sample types, such as soils, sediments, coals, ashes, sewage sludges, animal tissues, and plants. The researchers obtained Cd recoveries in the range 93–106%. From these studies, they concluded that the analytical procedure is scarcely matrix dependent, and the results obtained for a wide diversity of RMs are in good agreement with the certified values.
In a noteworthy paper, a new method for the determination of trace Ba in environmental samples by ETAAS was reported.66Coated graphite tubes were produced with lanthanum, zirconium, tungsten, molybdenum or tantalum in order to avoid generating Ba carbide. The results showed that the tube coated with lanthanum was the best. The Ba in Geochemical Standard Reference Samples Soil-1 (GSS–1) was determined by the new method and the results obtained confirmed its reliability and accuracy. The detection limit for Ba was 2.1 × 10−12 g and the RSD was 5.4% for 15 ng Ba ml−1. Lima et al.143 investigated the use of a tungsten–rhodium coating on the integrated platform of a transversely heated graphite atomizer as the permanent chemical modifier for the determination of Cu in sediments by using digested and slurry samples for ETAAS analysis. They observed that the permanent modifier was as efficient as the conventional Pd + Mg(NO3)2 modifier for obtaining good thermal stabilization of Cu in the digested and slurry samples. The detection limits obtained with the modifier were 1.6 µg g−1 and 0.33 µg g−1 for digested and 1.0%
(m/v) slurry sediments, respectively.
Lilleengen and Wibetoe144 investigated the determination of both the total and extractable amounts of Cr and Co in soil samples. For the total metal contents, ultrasonic slurry sampling graphite furnace AAS was used and the results were compared with those by conventional analyses after microwave digestion. Excellent agreement with CRM certified values was found for total Cr and Co using slurry sampling. To test the accuracy for the extractable Cr, CRM 483 sewage sludge-amended soil was analyzed and yielded values that were 37% and 32% higher than the certified values for EDTA and acetic acid extractable Cr, respectively. A slurry ETAAS technique has been used to determine Ni and Cr in wheat flour and its by-products.145 Slurries (3% w/v) were prepared in a mixture of 15% HNO3–10% H2O2 as suspending medium.
Dobrowolski146 used a 6% slurry of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) in 4% hydrofluoric acid and 1% nickel nitrate as modifier for the determination of Se in soils by graphite furnace AAS. Silica was removed from the soil sample with PTFE to avoid severe matrix effects. The results for the determination of Se in soil RMs by means of the slurry-sampling technique using aqueous standards were in good agreement with the certified values. In another noteworthy paper,147 an experimental design was developed to obtain a simple procedure for global determination of organotin compounds in sediment. Sediment was extracted by a two-phase method and Sn was determined in the organic extract by ETAAS, with Pd as modifier. A Plackett–Burman design was used for screening and a fractional central composite design (CCD) for optimizing in the evaluation of the effects of several variables. Results for the RM PACS–2 showed that it was possible to extract 82% of the organotin content of the CRM. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.08 µg g−1 and the RSD was 4%.
A technique for Sn determination in marine sediment, soil, coal fly ash and slurried coal samples by hydride generation-ETAAS has been reported.148 A batch mode generation system and Ir-treated graphite tubes were used for the HG and atomization, respectively. A noteworthy paper from Ringman et al.149 reported a microwave-assisted digestion of organoarsenic compounds for the determination of total As in aqueous, biological and sediment samples using FI-HG-ETAAS. Sodium persulfate, NaF and HNO3 served as digestion reagents, which allowed a quantitative transformation of organoarsenic compounds to hydride forming species in a commercial microwave sample preparation system. Sediment samples and plant materials showed recoveries for As around 100% after a single-step digestion. Fish, lobster and mussel samples usually require either the use of high pressure vessels or a second digestion step, if medium pressure vessels are used.
A particularly interesting and unusual application of ETAAS has been described by Chen and Beckett,150 who have developed a technique involving the coupling of sedimentation field-flow fractionation
(SdFFF) with ETAAS for characterizing soil and sediment colloids. The combined SdFFF–ETAAS technique has high resolution particle separation capability and a relatively high elemental analytical sensitivity. It was used to determine the distributions of metals in two natural soil and sediment samples and a model iron oxide coated kaolin. The results obtained were in good agreement with those obtained using ICP-MS.


3.2.2 Atomic emission spectrometry. 
The spectral interference in the determination of molybdenum in geological samples by ICP-AES has been investigated by Agnihotri and Sarin.151 The results at one of the recommended wavelengths, 281.615 nm, were severely affected by a spectral interference from argon, leading to inaccurate analytical results. However, at an alternative wavelength, 202.030 nm, the slit had to be reduced to cut out the emission from an Fe line (202.074 nm), thus affecting the analytical sensitivity of measurements. The attenuation of the emission signal at 202.030 nm could severely limit the determination of Mo in geological samples.
It is well known that Ca causes a severe spectral overlap when sulfur emission is measured. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model has been used to correct the interference effects caused by Ca when determining S from extracted soil samples by ICP-OES.152 Interferences were classified according to how they affected the regression coefficients in the MLR model. The new technique152 was reported to be accurate and easy to use when compared to two separate single variable regression models previously used to correct for spectral interference.
An ultrasound-assisted extraction method was developed153 for the determination of toxic elements in contaminated soil samples by ICP-AES. The determination of Ag, As, Cd and Pb in ultrasound-assisted extracts of SRM 2710 and SRM 2711 by ICP-AES was carried out with high accuracy and precision (RSD <3.7%). Although the certified concentrations of the SRMs were obtained for the four metals, the determination of Cu in SRMs by the same technique failed to obtain the certified concentrations.
ICP-AES is being increasingly used for the determination of relatively rare elements, often after separation and pre-concentration. For example, separation and pre-concentration of the PGEs and Au on modified silica and XAD sorbents in the presence of cationic surfactants for their determination by ICP-AES has been reported.154 Cai et al.155 have reported a sensitive and rapid method for the determination of Eu, La and Yb by ICP-AES after solid–liquid extraction with microcrystalline naphthalene. Determinands were quantitatively adsorbed on tribromoarsenazo–cetylpyridinium bromide–naphthalene (TBA–CPB–naphthalene), and determined by ICP-AES after desorption with 3 mol l–1 HCl. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the detection limits of this method for La, Eu and Yb were 1.3–8.6 ng ml–1. The method was applied to the analysis of CRMs and gave results in good agreement with reference values. Ai and Tang156 developed a new method for the determination of trace Nb and Ta in soil and geochemical exploration samples by ICP-AES with solvent extraction FI. The Nb and Ta were extracted with mixed MIBK and TBP at 1 mol l−1 HF and 4 mol l−1 H2SO4. The detection limits were 0.5 × 10−12 g l−1 and 0.8 × 10−12 g l−1. The method was applied to the determination of trace Nb and Ta in national standard samples and the results were in good agreement with certified values.
Shtangaeva et al.157 reported the combination of ICP-AES and INAA as being effective for studying the distribution of a wide range of elements in soils and plants. The research team carried out a detailed characterization of soil samples from sites with different levels of contamination, both before and after the cultivation of oats and barley. A total of 21 elements in the soil and 28 elements in the plants were determined by INAA while distributions of As Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in soil leachates were studied by a sequential leaching procedure and ICP-AES. It was found that plants significantly affect most of the soil characteristics, including the leaching of heavy metals.
A particularly interesting paper from Santamaria-Fernandez and co-researchers158 described the optimization of an empirical multielement sequential extraction method for metal partitioning in soils and sediments. The method uses centrifugation to pass one extractant solution—adjusted sequentially to a series of pH values—through a contaminated soil sample. Once optimum conditions had been obtained, sequential leaches were analysed by ICP-AES and chemometrics were employed to identify the composition of each component.
Rybak and Salin159 reported the application of an induction heated electrothermal vaporization sample introduction arrangement for the determination of As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn in soils and sediments by ICP-OES. They examined four CRMs and found that plots of intensity versus certified concentration for the four CRMs were linear with log–log slopes of 0.98–1.02 and r2 values greater than or equal to 0.995 for As, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Aqueous standard solutions were used for the analysis of all four CRMs by standard additions, resulting in recoveries ranging from 54–139%
(average recovery of 101 ± 15%) across all six elements in all four samples.
Reimann and co-researchers have investigated the influence of extreme pollution on the inorganic chemical composition of some plants.160 They collected leaves of nine different plant species from nine catchments spread over a 1,500,000 km2 area in northern Europe. Additional soil samples were taken from the O-horizon and the C-horizon at each plant sample site. All samples were analyzed for 38 elements by ICP-MS, ICP-AES or, for Hg, CV-AAS techniques.


3.2.3 Atomic fluorescence spectrometry. 
There is little to report about atomic fluorescence spectrometry in the past year in terms of new developments. Xiong161 described a new method for the rapid determination of Hg in soil by HG-AFS. Samples were leached at 80–100 °C with aqua regia
(H2O +
aqua regia, 1 + 1). Trace Hg in a polluted farming soil RM was determined by the new method and the result obtained was in good agreement with certified value; recoveries ranged from 87 to 105%.


3.2.4 Mass spectrometry. 
In a paper from Smith et al.,162 the formation of involatile methylantimony species by Clostridium spp. was described. The authors used GC-MS to detect trimethylantimony in the headspace of a soil enrichment culture designed to promote growth of Clostridia. Isolates of the latter were shown to biomethylate inorganic Sb in non-septic culture, using HG-GC-AAS. GC-MS profiles of headspace gases from soil enrichment cultures shown to generate trimethylantimony were used to select characterised Clostridium spp. for assessment of Sb biomethylation capability.
Since 87Sr is spectrally overlapped by 87Rb, separation prior to determination is a prerequisite for accurate Sr isotope ratio determination, especially in soil samples. In a significant contribution to the MS literature last year, Latkoczy et al.163 developed an on-line IC method (HPIC) for routine separation of Rb and Sr prior to strontium isotopic ratio determination by sector field ICP-MS. The Sr isotopic ratios in human bones and reference soil samples from the corresponding archaeological sites were determined. The authors concluded that diagenetic influences in Sr isotope ratios in prehistoric human bones were negligible, and groupings of individuals could be performed.
A combined gas chromatography-combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometer
(GC-C-IRMS) has been developed for stable carbon isotope analysis of amino acid enantiomers in soil samples.164
The important role of certified reference materials cannot be over emphasised in analysis. For the first time in the International Measurement Evaluation Programme (IMEP)-14, a sediment sample was offered to analytical laboratories to perform measurements of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, U and Zn. IDMS was applied as a primary method of measurement to achieve traceable results. For reference measurements of As, Fe, Hg and Zn, NAA and Zeeman AAS were applied. The reference values (ranges) were characterized as “certified”
(for Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni and U) or “assigned”
(for As, Cu, Fe, Hg and Zn) according to IMEP policy. The measurement uncertainty of the certified/assured reference values was calculated according to the ISO/BIPM Guide.
3.2.4.1 Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. 
The types of determinations that have been performed by ICP-MS over the past twelve months rather closely reflect what was reported in last year's review.27 Thus, there have been few really fundamental advances in spectrometric technique. Rather there has been steady progress in the applications area as the potential of atomic spectrometry is increasingly recognized and/or becomes more widely available. This progress is worth discussing, at least briefly, in the hope that it will stimulate further innovative applications, even if it overlaps a little with sample preparation sections of this review.
Speciation of elements in soils and plants often results in solutions with very low concentrations of the determinands. For such solutions, the very low detection limits achievable by ICP-MS make it an invaluable analytical tool. For example, Abedin and colleagues165 used ICP-MS for speciation of arsenic present in straw from rice plants from paddy irrigated with As-contaminated water. Their research was prompted by concerns over the possibility of the straw being used as animal feed, thus introducing As to the food chain. Jackson and Bertsch166 were concerned about the passage of As from organoarsenic compounds used as feed additives in the poultry industry, via poultry manure, to soils. They separated six As species chromatographically, again using the excellent detection limits of ICP-MS for quantification. Other such studies include the speciation of As in plant and soil associated with an As ore vein,167 and in an As-accumulating fern, Pityrogramma calomelanos, which is regarded as a potential phyto-remediator for As-contaminated soils.168 Optimisation of the coupling of capillary zone electrophoresis and ICP-MS has been described for the speciation not only of As, but also of Sb, Se and Te in soil extracts.169 Coupling of IC and ICP-MS was suggested to be an efficient and sensitive approach to determining As and Se species in soil extract and groundwater samples.170
In addition to the two examples of selenium speciation reported above, the accumulation of the element by various brassica species grown hydroponically has been studied in detail,116 as mentioned in section 3.1.2. Several digestion or extraction procedures were evaluated, including the use of HCl, Tris–HCl buffer and enzymatic hydrolysis using proteinase K and protease XIV. The suggested occurrence of a possible seleno-amino acid containing a Se–S bridge bond with a structure similar to that of cystine flags the potential high value of multi-element analysis of separated species in speciation studies.
As for arsenic, speciation of tin often produces solutions with very low determinand concentrations, and several groups have therefore explored the low-level detection power of ICP-MS for this determination. Most of the samples studied have been sediments,171–173 and isotope dilution methodology is sometimes advocated to circumvent problems associated with clean-up or extraction procedures.171,173 For the determination of Sn in soils, continuous hydride generation has been employed to further enhance sensitivity prior to the ICP-MS determination.174

Operationally defined sequential extraction procedures and ICP-MS have been used for the speciation of Be, Ni and V in soils around an oil-fired power plant in Hungary.120 A five-step extraction removed more of each element than a three-step extraction. Wang and co-workers119 used similar procedures to speciate REE in soils. A procedure based upon cation exchange HPLC-ICP-MS has been evaluated for the speciation of Al in soil extracts and lake water samples.175 In the past, ETAAS has been most widely used for such Al speciation studies.
A particularly notable application of ICP-MS detection in speciation studies was the establishment of the presence in soils of iodine bound to humic acids.176 It was inferred that the iodine was organic because of the coincidence of the elution times in size exclusion chromatography of high molecular weight organic compounds and some of the iodine. In a similar study, using field-flow fractionation, links were established between soluble organic matter size fractions and the transport of complexed trace metals.177
The natural abundances of some elements in soils and plant materials are so low that ICP-MS becomes the method of choice even for total elemental analyses. It has been used, for example, for the determination of lanthanides in pondweed,178 REEs in wheat,179 actinides,180 Tc,181 Np182 and Pu183 in a variety of environmental samples, Tl in soils and rapeseed,184 and airborne contamination of tree bark by Pd, Pt and Rh.185 Even with the low detection limits of ICP-MS, clean-up or preconcentration may still be required from time to time. This was so for the determination of Ag, Au, Te and U in surface waters and biological samples such as apple leaves.186 Similarly pre-concentration of REEs by co-precipitation with Fe(OH)3 and Ti(OH)4 has been used for their quantification in soils and sediments by ICP-MS.187 A pre-concentration procedure has also been described for the determination of Eu, La and Yb in exhaust particulates and foliage samples.155
Although ICP-OES is often adequate for rapid screening of soils and plants for a range of pollutant elements,153 ICP-MS is increasingly being used for this purpose. In one such study, 38 elements were monitored in willow, pine and spruce trees, and in 9 ground-flora species.160 The importance of the availability of multi-element determination capability is often highlighted,109 and may lead to important but unexpected findings at times. For the determination of 10 elements in moss samples, ICP-MS was shown to outperform INAA and AAS.188
One way in which the capabilities of ICP-MS irrefutably surpass those of ICP-AES is its ability to determine isotope ratios. Over the past year this has resulted in a number of applications papers where the technique has been selected because isotopic ratios are important. Examples are the measurement of 239Pu∶240Pu ratios to quantify nuclear testing fallout189 and at Kosovo post-Chernobyl,190 measurement of Sr isotope ratios to assess diagenetic influences on prehistoric human bones,163 measurement of 238U∶235U ratios in sediments in the vicinity of a uranium enrichment plant191 and in tree bark,192 and measurement of 236U in Chernobyl soils.193 The measurement of lead isotope ratios down dated deep marsh cores194 and in a trapped pocket of tree bark195 allows chronosequences of Pb isotope ratios to be created. There have been, surprisingly, far fewer studies where deliberate isotopic enrichment, for example with 10B,196 has been used as an investigative tool to help elucidate ecosystem functioning.

Isotope dilution ICP-MS seems to be finding more widespread applications. It has been used to validate a proposed method for the on-line determination of silver in sea-water and marine sediment,89 to compensate for possible losses in the pre-concentration of ultra-traces of U and Th in silicate rocks,197 and to certify a potential CRM sediment.198 It has also been used to improve reliability when co-precipitation with iron and aluminium hydroxides is used to remove isobaric interferences from zirconium and tin in the determination of Cd in sediments, the Cd being masked against precipitation with NH3.199,200 For the determination of Zn in plant samples by ID-ICP-MS, the main uncertainty was reported to be contamination during Zn separation coupled with uncertainty about the isotopic composition of “natural” Zn.201
The ability of ID-ICP-MS to compensate for losses of determinand at various stages in the overall analytical process makes it an obvious choice for improving reliability of data when electrothermal vaporization is used for sample introduction in ICP-MS. Miller-Ihli and Baker202 used such an approach when investigating micro-heterogeneity of distributions of Cu, Fe and Ni in mixed feed and soil samples when employing ultrasonic slurry sampling. They used Pd as a carrier to enhance transport and oxygen ashing. Mestek and colleagues203 described a way of interfacing a conventional GBC graphite furnace atomizer to an ICP-MS, and tested the system by determining Ni in plant samples. Transfer efficiency through the interface was around 20%.
The reliability of data produced by ID-ICP-MS is such that it is sometimes regarded as providing results that may be used to assess the adequacy of alternative approaches. For example, it was used to validate data produced by laser ablation ICP-MS for the determination of Hg in sediment samples.204 The two techniques gave results that were in good agreement for 14 sediments when the LA-ICP-MS system was calibrated using two sediment CRMs and one soil CRM. Klemm and Bombach205 have described a simple glue-based method for target preparation for LA-ICP-MS that could be used for the analysis of powdered rocks, sediments and soils.
An interesting paper has been published on the transfer of calibration between CRMs.206 The point is made that if CRMs are used to calibrate an ICP-MS system that is performing well, the additional uncertainty associated with data obtained using the system to produce a new CRM may be negligible compared with the uncertainty associated with the certified values provided for the CRMs that had been used for calibration.
The previous paragraph assumes, of course, that there are no unsuspected matrix-dependent interferences associated with analysis to produce the new CRM. It should not be forgotten that isobaric interferences can occur in ICP-MS, for example in the determination of Re in rock and soil samples,207 and chemical separation may be necessary prior to the final determination stage. Several polyatomic interferences have been reported from major matrix elements in the determination of trace elements in biological marine samples, which those analyzing such samples by ICP-MS should be made aware of.208 Matrix effects too may be problematic in the analysis of soils, sediments and geological materials,209 and ID-ICP-MS is perhaps one of the best ways to confirm that these are not a source of systematic error.
3.2.4.2 Thermal ionization mass spectrometry. 
Metal contamination of soils by diffuse atmospheric deposition is a worldwide phenomenon. The assessment of incorporation of exogenous metal contaminants in soils is of major environmental importance. Semlali and co-researchers have estimated the distribution of endogenous and exogenous Pb in two soils with contrasting pedogenesis, both representative of undisturbed ecosystems. Lead isotope analyses were performed using high-precision TIMS.210 Endogenous and exogenous Pb concentrations and exogenous 206Pb∶207Pb ratios of the samples were calculated using bulk Pb and Sc concentrations and bulk 206Pb∶207Pb ratios. Bacon211 determined the isotopic composition of Pb collected with grass samples taken over the period 1989–2001 from plots at two upland locations in Scotland using TIMS. The 206Pb∶207Pb ratio increased steadily at all the plots throughout the period of the study, indicating the reducing influence of petrol Pb, but the author observed that the changes were not as great as might be expected with the decrease in the use of leaded petrol. From the result, the author concluded that a substantial proportion of deposited Pb now has its origin other than in petrol. The results also suggest that although petrol Pb has been eliminated, traffic is still a source of Pb and another source defined as “traffic lead” should be considered.
A method based on extraction chromatography for the precise determination of 235U∶238U isotope ratio in soil samples by using TIMS has been developed.212 The isotope ratios were measured on three standards using a VG 54-30 thermal ionisation mass spectrometer in static mode with Faraday cup and Daly ion counting system. The reproducibility for standards and soil samples obtained in the study was better than 0.2% at two standard deviations. Uranium isotopic compositions were determined in soil samples and compared between the Chernobyl nuclear accident site and the criticality accident that occurred in Japan at the JCO site.

Isotope dilution-TIMS has been used213 to examine the certified Cd and Zn contents of four CRMs: 2 soils, 1 plant and an animal tissue. The CRMs were chosen to be of contrasting origin and Cd∶Zn content. Three digestion procedures were compared: (i) an open tube aqua regia procedure; (ii) microwave digestion using Teflon bombs; and (iii) HF digestion using PTFE bombs. In the same study, a filament loading procedure was developed to allow sequential analysis for Cd and Zn on a single filament during TIMS analysis. The authors concluded that the most efficient procedure in terms of costs and productivity for future work of this kind would be a combination of microwave digestion and sequential analysis for Cd and Zn on the same filament.
Diessler and co-workers186 have an on-line pre-concentration system for Ag, Au, Te and U that uses solenoid valves, a mini-column to retain the complexes formed with the ammonium salt of O,O-diethyldithiophosphoric acid and elution with methanol. Detection limits ranged from 0.05 to 22.4 pg ml−1 for U and Te, respectively. Accuracy was assured by the analysis of standard reference enriched water, sea and river waters, milk powder, apple leaves and urine, after microwave-assisted digestion of the last three materials.
The distribution of Ni and other elements in freeze-dried young leaves of Berkheya coddii Roessler (Asteraceae), one of five Ni hyper-accumulating plants from South Africa investigated, has been studied.214 The authors generated two-dimensional quantitative maps to determine the distribution of Ni, as well as macro- and micro-nutrients, using the scanning nuclear microprobe. The highest Ni enrichment was found in leaf margins, leaf mesophyll and midrib epidermis of very young apical leaves.


3.2.5 Particle-induced X-ray emission. 
Studies related to elemental deficiency and toxicity in plants, as well as environmental pollution, require accurate, fully quantitative methods with good spatial resolution. Ideally, these studies should be conducted on organs and tissues as far down as the cellular level. This is where micro-PIXE has been applied until now and can in the near future play a much more important role. A timely review of micro-PIXE in plant sciences (present status and perspectives) has been published.215
Wallander et al.216 used PIXE to estimate the elemental composition of ectomycrorhizal rhizomorphs grown in contact with different minerals in forest soil. The study observed that a high concentration of K in some rhizomorphs (up to 11 mg g−1) suggests that these fungi are good accumulators of K and may have a significant role in transporting K to trees.
The micro-PIXE technique has also been applied to the determination of arsenic in biomat
(microhabitats of bacteria) and lower plants such as lichen and mosses around an As mine site at Gunma, Japan.217 It was concluded that application of micro-PIXE analysis to the determination of As in the lower plants and biomat gives not only the distribution of a hazardous element such as As, but also information about its origins.
That PIXE is becoming an important technique in plant science is not in doubt. Harju and co-workers218 demonstrated the important role of PIXE to plant and environmental scientists by applying the technique to monitor trace elements in bark of Scots pine. The bark samples were analysed directly by radially scanning from inner to outer bark in order to study the variability of elemental concentrations in different layers. The study demonstrated that external-beam thick-target PIXE is a sensitive and reliable method for quantitative determination of heavy metals in tree bark samples.
Micro-PIXE has recently been used to resolve a controversy over the possible role of the root apoplast as an iron-storage pool for plants.219 Micro-PIXE analyses in pixel mode were complemented by another technique. Based on the correlation between iron and soil related elements like Al, Si and Ti, most of the Fe located at the root surface could be attributed to soil contamination. It was also shown that these soil contaminations lead to an overestimation of the apoplastic Fe concentrations determined by the methods commonly used in botany.
In another study, the metal distribution within mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots of Epipactis atronibens collected from Zn mine tailings was investigated using PIXE and AAS.220Elemental maps from PIXE showed that plant root epidermis and fungal coils that had developed within cortical cells of roots collected from the zinc mine tailings were the main sites of Pb and Zn accumulation, associated with increased concentrations of Ca, Cd, Fe, Mn, S, Si and Ti. The results suggest a bio-filtering effect against heavy metals by orchid mycorrhizal fungi.
During the period covered by this review, PIXE has also been used in conjunction with other techniques. In a noteworthy study undertaken to understand mechanisms of plant adaptation to a hostile environment, Mesjasz–Przybylowicz and co-workers221 used simultaneously two complementary techniques—PIXE and proton back scattering spectrometry (BS)—to study elemental distributions in seeds of Biscutella laevigata L. from Zn wastes in Oikusz, Poland. The results show that plants strictly and actively select elements and their amounts taken up by different tissues. This mechanism is probably responsible for their survival. In another study Ager and co-workers222 investigated the sites of metal localization within Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, when plants are grown in a Cd-rich environment, by making use of nuclear microscopy techniques. Micro-PIXE, Rutherford BS (RBS) and SEM analyses were performed in the scanning proton microprobe and the results obtained showed that Cd is sequestered within the trichomes on the leaf surface. Additionally, regular PIXE analyses were performed on samples prepared by an acid digestion method in order to assess the metal accumulation of such plants. Huerta et al.223 investigated the total elemental composition of soils contaminated with wastewater irrigation by combining PIXE, RBS and INAA for elemental analysis. Results indicated that heavy metal total concentrations exceed the critical soil total concentrations according to environmental regulations. In a useful review paper “The nuclear microprobe—a challenging tool in plant sciences”, Mesjasz–Przybylowicz224 has discussed the role of the technique in plant science. The advantages of X-ray spectrometry in the field of rapid non-destructive multielement analysis of environmental samples have been increasingly recognized over recent decades.


3.2.6 Developments in X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. 
During the year under review, papers on the XRF technique continued to proliferate. The first room-temperature X-ray absorption spectra of higher oxidation states of the tetramanganese complex of photosystem II have been reported by Haumann et al.225 The Mn complex of photosystem II catalyzes water oxidation. For the first time, its advancement through the reaction cycle was monitored by time resolved X-ray absorption measurements at the Mn K-edge at room temperature. The complex was stepped through its four oxidation states by nanosecond laser flashes applied to samples exposed to the X-ray beam. Time courses of the X-ray fluorescence intensity were recorded during a flash sequence.
It is well known among scientists that concentrations of both essential and toxic elements in pine needles are influenced by environmental factors, either directly from air pollutants or indirectly from acidification. In the past, the focus has been on determining mean concentrations for bulk samples of pine needles. However, in a noteworthy paper,226elemental distributions along the length of pine needles without any visible morphological damage have been studied for a number of important elements. The variations of element concentrations along the needle length were reported to be very large for some elements, e.g. Mn and Zn, whereas for others, e.g. Cu and Fe, concentrations were almost constant. Also, for some elements, large differences with age class were observed, and also variations with soil pH and light conditions. Scanning energy-dispersive XRF spectrometry was used and the results were validated by independent analysis with graphite furnace AAS.
Pukhovski has published a review on the role of XRF analysis in the Russian State Agrochemical Service.227 The author traced the role of the technique from the beginning, in the 1950s, up until the present time.

Micro-synchrotron X-ray fluorescence was used to examine the metal distribution in Cd-challenged corn (Zea mays) roots.228 The results from the study suggest that Cd alters Ca distribution in root tissues.
A simple and rapid XRF method has been developed for the determination of carbon in lake sediments.229 Carbon Kα intensities of thin layer specimens were assessed by an XRF spectrometer equipped with synthetic multi-layers as the analyzing crystal without any matrix corrections. The detection limit of the method was 2 µg (0.2 µg cm−2) and it was applied successfully for paleo-environmental analysis.
The biogeochemical dynamics following land use change from forest to pasture in a humid tropical area have been studied using the multi-element approach of XRF spectroscopy.230 The total amounts of 29 elements in topsoils were determined when forest was changed to pasture land. A study on the savanna suggested that the surface soils might be contaminated with Th, Ti, U and V because of increasing phosphate fertilizer applications. The authors determined by XRF the dynamics of Ce, Ga, La, Nb, Nd, U, V and Y in a savanna soil that had received NPK fertilizers, farmyard manure (FYM) and FYM + NPK for 50 years, using an adjacent uncultivated site as a reference.
The essentiality of Cr and the disturbances that its deficiency produces in humans are of interest. Consequently, the determination of chromium in drugs of vegetable origin used in physiotherapy is of importance. De Ruiz et al.231 investigated different analytical methodologies for the preconcentration and determination of trace Cr by XRF in medicinal herbs with effects on metabolism. The methodologies were applied with very good results to the determination of trace Cr in the medicinal herb Taraxacum officinale and in synthetic samples.
Using an energy-dispersive XRF analysis with a Ti-filtered X-ray tube, Anjos et al.232 developed a technique for the determination of several elements, such as Br, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Pb, Rb, Sr, Ti, Zn, and Zr, at µg g−1 levels in radish plants (root and foliage) cultivated in soils treated with concentrations of 10, 20 and 30 t ha−1 of organic compost from urban garbage. The results suggest that radish plants can be used as bioindicators of contamination of agricultural soils. Varga et al.233 reported the determination of Cd, Fe, Ni and Pb distributions between the symplasm (cytoplasm) and apoplasm (cell wall) of cucumber roots and leaves by total reflection XRF spectrometry.
The importance of knowing the source profile for soil in Hong Kong for the determination of the main air pollutant sources in the city and for assessment of the impact of Asian dust storms in Hong Kong has been fully highlighted by Yu et al.234 The authors determined 19 chemical elements in soils associated with different rock types by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence. They concluded that Ca provides a good marker element for identifying dust episodes in Hong Kong while Al does not.
In a novel application, EDXRF with a 109Cd excitation source was used for the multi-element analysis of two tobacco leaves and ten brands of cigarettes widely consumed in Nigeria.235 14 elements were determined in dried tobacco leaves, cigarettes and ashes. In a similar study, EDXRF spectroscopy has been used for the determination of essential and trace elements contents of some 20 Nigerian medicinal plants.236 The accuracy and precision of the technique were assured by analyzing the European Community Bureau Reference Standard BCR 62 (Olive Leaves). The results show that many of these plants contain elements of vital importance for human metabolism and for prevention and healing of diseases. In a similar study, EDXRF and TXRF were used to analyse surface soil samples for elemental concentrations and the mobile (bioavailable) fractions in the soil.237 EDXRF was also used to analyse the aerosol particles in two size fractions: PM 2.5 and PM 2.5–10. Also, TXRF and other methods have been applied to the characterization of low-volume xylem sap control and Ni-contaminated cucumber plants grown hydroponically with urea as the sole N source.238 In these saps, collected for an hour, Ca, K, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn, as well as malic, citric and fumaric acids, were determined.
In an international study, Cercasov et al.239 investigated the suitability of three lichen species (Cetraria islandica, Evernia prumastri and Ramalina farinacea) as transplants for trace-element air biomonitoring. They were exposed on substratum-free supports, from July 1996 until July 1997, in three European Countries with different climates (Germany, Italy, Romania), at six sites with different types of air pollutants. After 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of exposure, some portions of thallus were collected, prepared and measured by INAA and EDXRF. Fifteen environmentally relevant elements were determined. The results obtained confirmed Evernia prumastri as the most suitable, followed by Ramalina farinacea and Cetraria islandica.
Silicon K XRF spectra of soil samples from a volcanic island have been measured using a commercially available wavelength dispersive XRF spectrometer for elemental analysis.240 Extended X-ray emission fine structure (EXEFS) was found at the low energy side of the K XRF diagram lines. Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were obtained for the same samples and for aerosols collected on the same island.


3.2.7 Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy. 
LIBS is one of the newest analytical techniques and is based upon the measurement of emission lines generated by atomic species close to the surface of the sample, thus allowing their chemical identification. Capitelli and co-researchers241 applied LIBS to the determination of total contents of heavy metals in a number of reference soil samples. The technique was validated by comparing LIBS data with data obtained on the same soil samples by conventional ICP spectroscopy. Partial agreement was obtained between the two sets of data, suggesting the potential applicability of the LIBS technique to the measurement of heavy metals in soils. In a similar study, Mosier-Boss and Lieberman242 described the direct push fibre-optic LIBS sensor probe for real-time, in situ measurement of metals in soil.
The advantages of hyphenated techniques in environmental analysis are very well known. In a noteworthy paper, Hilbk-Kortenbruck and co-workers243 investigated the use of a hyphenated technique combining LIBS with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) for the determination of heavy metals in soils. Measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure in order to evaluate the applicability of the technique for fast in-situ analytical purposes. The plasma radiation was detected using a Paschen–Runge spectrometer equipped with photomultipliers for the simultaneous analysis for 22 different elements. The calibration curves based on the LIF signals showed significantly improved limits of detection of 0.3 and 0.5 µg g−1 for Cd and Tl, respectively, compared to 6 µg g−1 for Cd and 48 µg g−1 for Tl initially obtained.
One major obstacle in the estimation of carbon inventories in soils is lack of a rapid method for determining total soil C. Researchers investigating C cycling in soils and dynamics of soil C in global change processes would benefit immensely from the introduction of a simple, rapid, accurate and precise method that could be used in the field. Cremers and co-workers244 have tested a new method for predicting total soil carbon using LIBS. The results suggest that LIBS rapidly and efficiently measures soil C with excellent detection limits (ca. 300 mg kg−1), precision (4–5%) and accuracy (3–14%). Also, it was observed that results from LIBS measurements and dry combustion analyses were highly correlated for soils of distinct morphology and a sample could be analyzed in less than 1 min by LIBS. One major advantage of LIBS over other methods is that it is readily adaptable to a field-portable instrument.
Lazic and co-workers245 investigated the self-absorption model in quantitative LIBS measurements on soils and sediments. Their results were reported to be significant for some field applications, such as on-board marine sediment analysis, where a significant matrix variation with layer depth is common.
Compositional characterization of encrustation in marble with LIBS is the title of an interesting paper from Maravelaki-Kalaitzaki et al.246 They observed that LIBS can be used as an autonomous in situ diagnostic technique to obtain in-depth elemental profiling of encrustation, even in cases of highly inhomogenous layered crusts such as those of un-weathered Pentelic marble.
That LIBS is already attracting interest from far and wide is shown by a paper from Wainner and colleagues247 on the results of a grant from the US Army Research office for the development of a commercial LIBS chemical sensor that is sufficiently compact and robust for use in the field. The portable unit was developed primarily for the rapid, non-destructive detection of Pb in soils and paint. Both the laboratory and portable LIBS systems exhibited similar performance with regards to detection of Pb in both soils and paint over the 0.05–1% concentration levels. The results obtained are very encouraging for the development of lightweight, portable LIBS sensors that use less expensive and less sophisticated laser and detector components. The portable LIBS system was also field tested successfully at sites of documented Pb contamination on military installations in California and Colorado.

4 Analysis of geological materials
4.1 Reference materials
Last year's review in this series27 pointed the reader to Kane's248 tutorial review on the use of reference materials (RMs). Since then there has been a plea to authors of published papers to include information about the use of CRMs in their abstracts, because these are widely available in electronic form.132 In a survey of 26 scientific journals it was found that only ca. 55% of abstracts mentioned the CRMs described in the paper, often rather incompletely. It was suggested that publishers' notes to authors should include recommendations about where and how the use of CRMs should be described. It will be interesting to see if this idea is taken up by any of the geoanalytical journals!
A new series of geochemical reference materials has been produced by the Institute of Geophysical and Geochemical Exploration in China.133 Certified or reference values for over 60 major and trace elements are tabulated for a limestone, granitic gneiss, amphibolite, a lake sediment and three stream sediments.
As analytical methods improve there is a pressing requirement to extend the elemental coverage of existing RMs. Selenium is of interest as a tracer of certain ore deposits, as well as for its potential toxicity. Marin and colleagues249 have compiled selenium values for sixty-five geological RMs, including their own data, obtained by ETV-AAS. An overview250 of suitable RMs for thorium identified an IAEA database as a particularly useful source of information and gave its URL.
It is helpful if RMs, originally certified for their elemental components, can be characterised for their isotopic composition as well. An example is the NIST series of certified glasses, SRM 610-617, which are widely used to calibrate a number of in situ microprobe techniques. Woodhead and Hergt251 presented the first compilation of the Nd, Pb and Sr isotope ratios in SRM 610, 612 and 614. These appeared to be homogeneous at the sampling volumes and levels of analytical precision obtainable with current TIMS instrumentation. However, large differences in isotopic composition were observed between the different reference glasses, suggesting the presence of significant amounts of these trace elements in the initial starting material used to prepare the glasses. As a result, the isotopic composition of one CRM cannot be extrapolated to another. Similarly, B and O isotope ratios have been determined on SRM 610/612, and on JB-2 (basalt) and JR-2 (rhyolite) from the Geological Survey of Japan,252 with the aim of providing reference data for both microanalytical and wet chemical techniques. The B isotope compositions of SRM 610 and 612 were indistinguishable, whereas significant differences were found in the O isotope ratios, possibly because of the different amounts of trace element oxides added to the silicate matrix during their preparation.
The quest for RMs suitable for in situ analysis continues. A relatively new RM, BCR CRM 680, consisting of a polyolefinic matrix doped with various metallic compounds at trace concentrations, has been evaluated for its suitability for calibrating microanalytical techniques.253 Micro-heterogeneity data obtained using LA-ICP-MS were compared with those from synchrotron micro XRD and satisfactory agreement between the two sets of results was observed.
The need for well-characterised, homogeneous RMs which closely match minerals in which light elements, such as Li, Be and B, are major constituents, has been recognised by Dyer and co-workers.254 This prompted an extensive collaborative exercise in which large gem crystals, covering a broad spectrum of minerals, were made available and characterised by a wide range of analytical methods covering both in situ and wet chemical techniques. This sample suite, together with the data reported, is a major contribution to the aim of producing consistent analysis of light element bearing minerals. New B isotopic data were also produced for some of these proposed mineral reference samples.255
4.2 Sample treatment

4.2.1 Solid sample introduction. 
4.2.1.1 Laser ablation. 
Laser sampling of geological materials for both elemental and isotopic analysis has wide application in the characterisation of ore deposits. These include studies of fluid inclusions in quartz from tin256 and copper257 deposits, carbonaceous substances such as kerogens in bitumens from a uranium ore deposit258 and PGEs in a nickel sulfide ore body.259
The use of lasers to sample biological matter with a visible record of cyclic growth, e.g. tree rings, is well documented. A recent example is the use of porite corals to assess the environmental impact of gold mining in Papua New Guinea.260 The trace element abundances in the corals clearly recorded the dramatic changes in environmental conditions in the locality. A particularly novel application has been the estimation of the geological age of ancient halite (NaCl) evaporites by LA-ICP-MS and the extraction of DNA from the same material.261 This study strengthened the argument that microorganisms may survive in evaporite deposits over geological time.
Although LA-ICP-MS is now regarded as a routine analytical technique, it is still hampered by a lack of suitable calibration standards. Because natural sulfide minerals are often heterogeneous, Wilson et al.262 have produced a synthetic trace metal sulfide with an Fe, Cu, Zn and S matrix by precipitation from solution. Approximately 200 g of the material, PS-1, were synthesised by the method described; preliminary data suggest that PS-1 is suitable for use as a sulfide calibration standard for quantitative analysis by LA-ICP-MS. The authors stress that other researchers should be able to produce alternative synthetic sulfides with different proportions of matrix elements and a wide range of trace metals using this methodology. Other synthetic, matrix-matched standards that have been developed specifically for LA-ICP-MS include a range of Ti-bearing minerals263 and obsidian standards for the quantification of 47 minor and trace elements in obsidian rocks and archaeological artefacts.264
Nowadays, the most common laser ablation systems in use are based on Nd:YAG lasers operating in the UV at 266 nm. Although shorter wavelength systems are available, there has been interest in improving the ablation characteristics of the 266 nm Nd:YAG systems, particularly for use with highly UV-transparent samples such as quartz. Researchers at ETH Zürich have constructed a high power system, equipped with homogenizing optics to provide a “flat-top” laser profile, and thus improve the laser energy transfer onto the sample.265 The energy densities are adjustable between 4 and 45 J cm−2; at optimum energies there is less cracking of quartz during ablation and a reduction in elemental fractionation.
A wide range of elements can be determined in melt and fluid inclusions as small as 10 µm by LA-ICP-MS. However, the detection of some elements is limited by polyatomic and isobaric interferences. The capability of dynamic reaction cell technology to reduce such interferences, using hydrogen to remove Ar-based polyatomic ions, has been assessed.266 The reaction cell coped well with fast transient signals and allowed Ca and Fe to be determined using the most abundant isotope; detection limits were improved by factors of 250 and 20, respectively. Alternative methods to quantify the composition of melt inclusions by deconvoluting the analytical signal from a mixture of melt inclusion and host mineral have also been examined.267
Although the great attraction of laser ablation is its ability to obtain spatial information on a scale of 5–300 µm, there is still interest in employing the technique for bulk sampling of geological materials. One advantage often cited is the minimal sample preparation required compared with solution analysis. However, whether pressed powder pellets204,205,268 or fusion with lithium metaborate269 is used, neither represents a saving of effort compared with the preparation required for the established technique of XRF. In the early reports of bulk analysis by LA-ICP-MS IR lasers tended to be employed, whereas the current generation of lasers coupled with ICP-MS are UV devices designed for single mineral analysis. Motelica-Hieno and Donard268 assessed the influence of the matrix and laser wavelength (266 and 1064 nm) on quantitative bulk analysis using silicate RMs. At 266 nm, they found that matrix effects could be reduced but not overcome unless the external calibration standards were very closely matched in terms of their chemical and mineralogical composition. To compensate for differences in response factors between matrices they proposed a strategy of applying multiple internal standards by selecting elements representative of the different mineralogical phases of the matrix. In an alternative approach, Günther et al.269 investigated different calibration strategies using external non-matrix matched RMs. Various internal standards were tested before lithium was selected as the most suitable. Use of the calculated stoichiometric composition of lithium tetraborate to estimate the concentration of lithium internal standard resulted in a consistent bias; this was overcome by determining Li in a fused geological RM for each batch of samples and applying a correction factor.

Precise in situ measurements of isotope ratios, comparable to those obtainable by TIMS, are now regularly achieved with laser ablation coupled to multiple-collector (MC) ICP-MS. Such studies include Pb–Pb dating of apatite, monazite and sphene,270 Re–Os isotope measurement in mantle sulfides271 and the determination of W isotope ratios.272 The Hf–W isotope chronometer can provide important information about processes occurring during the early evolution of the solar system but it has not been widely used up to now because of analytical difficulties. Hirata272 optimised the analytical strategy for the determination of W isotopes by LA-HC-ICP-MS, including the use of time resolved analysis to provide effective data acquisition while minimising losses during the integration of transient signals. The internal precision proved to be sufficient to detect natural variations (typically 0.04–0.2%) in the 182W∶183W isotope ratio originating from radiogenic contributions of 182Hf.
Not all isotope studies require the best precision. Depending on the application, modern quadrupole ICP-MS instruments are capable of providing isotope data that are fit for purpose. An example is a method for determining Pb isotopes in lake sediments by LA-ICP-QMS, which was applied to determining the amount and origin of historical contamination by Pb.273 Brugier et al.274 claim to have successfully determined in situ Pb∶Pb and Pb∶U ratios on single zircon grains for geochronological purposes using LA-ICP-QMS, with a spatial resolution of 40–50 µm, without the need for matrix matched RMs.

Laser-induced breakdown spectrometry
(LIBS) has been used in a number of geochemical applications involving process control where low detection limits are not important. These include on-line determination of major constituents in iron-ore slurries,275 analysis of a mineral melt at 1600 °C,276 gypsum and coal,277 and the automated analysis of phosphate ores.278
4.2.1.2 Slurry sampling. 
The introduction of geological samples into analytical systems as slurries for elemental determination continues to be a minority interest. However, anyone seriously thinking about adopting this technique should consult an extensive review of the literature published between 1990 and 2000279 on methodologies for slurry sampling combined with detection by ETV-AAS. The technique has advantages when it comes to the determination of Hg in coal. Flores et al.280 developed a rugged method based on chemical vapour generation from slurried coal. Powdered samples were treated with 1 mol l−1 nitric acid for 2 d before Hg vapour was generated directly from the unfiltered solution, collected in a graphite tube, treated with gold or rhodium modifier and determined by ETV-AAS, with a limit of detection equivalent to 0.009 µg g−1 Hg in the original coal. A batch mode hydride generation system was used by Moreda-Pineiro and co-workers to measure Hg281 and Sn148 in a range of geological and environmental sample slurries by vapour generation ETV-AAS. Five chemical modifiers have been tested for the direct determination of Co in coal fly ash and slag by ultrasonic slurry sampling ETV-AAS; 0.5% v/v nitric acid proved to be the most effective.282


4.2.2 Sample dissolution. 
For solution techniques such as AAS or ICP, sample dissolution is the most critical part of the analysis, particularly for the unwary, because it can be responsible for the largest (and often hidden) sources of error. A review38 of present knowledge concerning the possible sources of error during the various stages of sample dissolution is therefore welcome. Of particular relevance to practising geoanalysts is a systematic evaluation of methods for the decomposition of geological materials for trace element determination by ICP-MS,283 carried out by workers in Tasmania. Five methods of digestion were tested: mixed acid digestions in (a) Teflon vials on a hot plate, (b) a high pressure digestion system and (c) a microwave oven, a combined HF–HNO3 acid attack and lithium tetraborate fusion, and a sodium peroxide sinter. The advantages and disadvantages of the five different methods investigated are summarised. Not surprisingly, the preferred method depended on the individual sample composition. The message is clear—no single decomposition protocol will allow the measurement of all trace elements in all types of geological samples by ICP-MS, and it is important to recognise the limitations of each methodology, particularly microwave-based digestions.
One of the more novel applications of sequential leaching was the determination of U and 238U∶235U ratios in extracts of freshwater sediments, prepared according to the three-stage BCR sequential extraction protocol.191 The extracts were passed through an anion exchange resin (BioRad AG1-X8) and the U eluted with 8 mol l−1 HNO3 prior to analysis by ICP-MS. The method was applied to the study of uranium pollution in the vicinity of a uranium enrichment plant; the results suggested that the U is discharged from the plant in a relatively refractory form.


4.2.3 Separation and preconcentration. 
Preconcentration is often required prior to determining Ag, Au and the PGE in geological samples, even with the high sensitivity and selectivity of modern instrumentation. Recently, several methods employing microcolumns packed with chelating adsorbent have been developed for use with FI-FAAS.284–286 Ag, Au, Pd and Pt were selectively retained on a microcolumn packed with an isodiphenylthiourea immobilized silica gel and eluted with thiourea.284 Detection limits of 0.33, 3.2, 4.7 and 69 ng ml−1, for Ag, Au, Pd and Pt, respectively, were reported; the accuracy of the method was demonstrated by analysing a number of geological and metallurgical RMs. Amidinothioureido-silica gel285 and 2-mercaptothiazoline immobilized silica gel286 have also been used as chelating agents for the determination of Ag, Au and Pd, and Au and Pd, respectively.
TEVA, a relatively new ion exchange resin from Eichrom, has been used to successfully separate Ir, Os, Pd, Pt, Re and Ru from geological matrices after conversion to their bromo complexes by heating with a HF–HBr mixture in a Teflon bomb.287 A three-step procedure was used to convert the bromo complexes to chloro complexes, which have weaker affinities to the resin, and to elute the elements of interest. This method is claimed to be particularly suitable for the preparation of geological samples prior to isotopic analysis because the total blanks were <14 pg for Pd, Pt and Ru and <10 pg for Ir, Os and Re for a 0.2 g sample. This resin has also been used to separate Re from rock and soil samples after an alkali fusion.207

Copper ores and concentrates are not amenable to the classical fire assay approach for separating Au, Pd and Pt from the matrix elements, and therefore alternatives have been sought.288,289 A procedure based on an aqua regia digestion, followed by collection as a mercury amalgam prior to determination by ETV-AAS and ICP-AES, was applied to three Canadian CRMs.288 Although good agreement with the certified values for Au, Pd and Pt was reported, it is doubtful whether the materials tested were representative of high copper matrices.
The nickel sulfide fire assay–tellurium coprecipitation separation procedure for the determination of PGE in silicate rocks by ICP-MS has been revisited with the aim of reducing losses of the more volatile PGE.290 By dissolving the nickel sulfide bead in 20.2% HCl in an open system that allowed H2S to escape without loss of HCl, Os was almost completely recovered and any potential loss of Pd minimised.

High field strength elements (HFSE), i.e., Hf, Nb, Ta and Zr, and the REE are two other groups of chemically similar elements, for which separation from matrix elements is desirable for accurate determination at the low abundances found in many rocks. A review of the techniques and fundamentals of the separation chemistry of the lanthanides highlights why some separations work well and provides explanations for why others are less successful.291 Pin and Joannon292 developed a method that uses cation exchange and extraction chromatography in tandem, without an intervening evaporation step, to recover the lanthanides quantitatively. Isotope dilution was used for Hf, Th and Zr, which were determined simultaneously with the REE, with recoveries between 94 and 98%. Yang and Pin293 experimented with a novel solid-phase extraction scheme for the separation of the HFSE from Al-, Ti- and Fe-rich geological materials. The resin was prepared by impregnating hydrophobic microporous polymer beads with N-benzoyl-N-phenylhydroxylamine. After an HF–HClO4 attack to remove silica, the rock solution was made up in 4 M HCl and loaded onto the resin. The authors considered the method to be superior to a liquid–liquid extraction with respect to its selectivity and ease of manipulation, even though an oxalic–HF acid mixture or 5 M HF was required to elute the HFSE off the column. The use of nanometer sized particles of titanium oxide for on-line separation and preconcentration of REE prior to measurement by ICP-AES294 may herald the future for such applications of nanometer sized material, as its special properties make it very suitable for this purpose.
With the advent of multicollector ICP-MS, there has been a drive to simplify the separations required for precise isotope ratio determinations in geological materials. Kleinhanns et al.295 devised a scheme for separating Hf, Lu, Nd, Sm and the lanthanides from a single sample digest. The procedure consists of five steps: (1) sample dissolution by sodium peroxide sintering; (2) separation of the HFSE (including Hf) using a HF-free anion-exchange column; (3) purification of Hf on a cation-exchange resin; (4) separation of the REE from other matrix elements by cation exchange; and (5) separation of Lu, Sm and Nd from the other REE by reversed-phase ion chromatography. Munker and co-workers296 developed a three-column separation method for Hf, Lu, Ta and Zr–Nb, using Eichrom® Ln-Spec resin and Biorad® AG-1-X8 resin. They claim that this procedure permits, for the first time, combined isotope dilution measurements of Nb–Ta, Zr–Hf and Lu–Hf using a mixed 94Zr176Lu180Hf180Ta tracer.


4.2.4 Speciation studies. 
Several useful reviews relating to elemental speciation have been published recently, including a two-part review of the coupling of LC to ICP-MS.297,298 The first part discusses general aspects, such as the advantages of ICP-MS as a LC detector, the problems encountered for particular analytes or mobile phase composition, and the coupling itself. The second part focuses on some key elements, e.g. As, I, Pt, Se and Cd, and suggests that Sn speciation is still dominated by GC-AED. Pereiro and Diaz299 compared the merits and limitations of GC-MIP-AED for the speciation of Hg, Pb and Sn compounds in environmental samples, with those of other hyphenated GC-based techniques. The effect of different sample preparation methods on the accuracy and precision of data obtained by GC-based methods is also discussed.
For the separation of organotin compounds GC coupling is the preferred chromatographic technique, but the elemental detector can vary widely. Organotins in marine sediments have been quantified using GC coupled to ICP-MS,59,171,173 ICP-AES,42 MIP-AES,300 a pulsed flame photometric detector,301 and Hy-FAAS.302 There is still concern over whether different extraction procedures provide complete recovery. Thus, three liquid–solid extraction techniques: leaching with mechanical shaking, ultrasonic and microwave-assisted extractions—with a methanol–acetic acid mixture in all cases—were evaluated by Encinar et al.173 They observed that the tributyltin concentration measured in marine sediment CRM PACS-2 was higher than the certified value for both microwave and ultrasonic extraction; this was not the case for mechanical shaking. Carpinteiro et al. advocated ultrasound-assisted leaching in the presence of acetic acid as a fast and simple procedure for the simultaneous leaching of butyl and phenyl organotin species.300 Solid-phase microextraction may offer a suitable alternative to liquid–liquid extraction, although the ability of the analyte to absorb or adsorb on the fibre is not entirely independent of the matrix components.42 During the certification of PACS-2, Yang and Lam172 developed a method for the determination of butyltin by HPLC-ICP-MS with the express purpose of providing data by a second independent method to complement those from the more established GC-based techniques. They reported an assessment of the stability of PACS-2—an important property for a CRM. If properly refrigerated, the butyltin species remained constant over 2 years.
Studies of mercury methylation and de-methylation in sediment cores have demonstrated the potential for the interconversion of Hg species during sample processing.135,303 In sediment samples, methyl (Me) Hg levels typically represent only a few percent or less of the total Hg. Nevertheless, even the formation of minor amounts of MeHg during the analytical procedure will result in significant systematic errors. The extraction procedure of Lambertsson et al.,303 based on CuSO4, H2SO4 and KBr, showed less than 0.05% conversion of Hg to MeHg. However, when bromide was used for the extraction, some transformation of one species to the other was observed. A similar effect was noted by Hammerschmidt and Fitzgerald135 when extracting MeHg from a sediment RM by both aqueous distillation and leaching with dilute solutions of HNO3. The development of a method for mercury speciation using a capillary cold trap as a novel sample introduction and separation system for MIP-AES is noteworthy.304 The procedure, which comprises a derivatization step, on-line gas phase extraction, preconcentration and analyte separation, is semi-automated. Detection limits of 6.0, 0.95 and 1.25 ng l−1 for Me2Hg, MeHg and Hg, respectively, were achieved, even though the CCD detector used was not really appropriate for recording transient signals.


4.2.5 Vapour generation. 

Different sample pretreatments for the determination of As by hydride generation have been assessed for their ability to provide complete recoveries of organoarsenic compounds, especially arsenobetaine.149,305–307 Ringmann et al.149 demonstrated that a microwave-assisted digestion using sodium persulfate, sodium fluoride and nitric acid effected a quantitative transformation of organoarsenic compounds to hydride forming species, but the operating conditions depended on the nature of the sample. Sediment and plant material only required a single-step digestion with medium pressure, whereas high-pressure vessels or a second digestion step were usually needed to measure total As in seafood. Coal, fly ash and slag samples are particularly amenable to microwave digestion procedures prior to the measurement of As, Sb and Se by Hy-ETV-AAS308 and As and Hg by cold vapour/Hy AAS.309
Variations on established analytical methods employing vapour generation have been applied to geological materials, including the determination of trace Se in rocks by Hy-AAS,310 Bi in geological RMs by Hy-AAS,311,312 Te in sediments by FI-HG-AAS107 and Au in ore samples by FI-vapour generation-AAS.313 Gaseous halides are often less prone to interferences from other matrix elements than their corresponding hydrides. Thus, Lopez-Molinero and co-workers314 explored the use of NaCl and sulfuric acid to generate germanium tetrachloride prior to measurement by ICP-AES and applied the method to the analysis of coal and lignite samples.

4.3 Instrumental analysis

4.3.1 Atomic absorption spectrometry. 

FAAS and ETV-AAS are still widely used in geoanalytical laboratories and existing methods involving these mature techniques are still being modified for specific applications. Data for selenium at trace levels in 65 geological RMs, with a detection limit of 0.02 µg g−1, have been reported.249 Samples were decomposed with a HNO3–HF mixture, Se reduced to SeIV with HCl and then separated from the matrix on thiol cotton, before measurement by ETV-AAS using palladium and magnesium nitrates as a matrix modifier. A tungsten–rhodium coating on the integrated platform of a transversely heated graphite atomiser was found to be a suitable matrix modifier for the determination of Cu in sediments by ETV-AAS.143 For the quantification of Ga in complex ores by ETV-AAS, nickel, magnesium and aluminium nitrates were used as matrix modifiers after separation with Amberlite XAD-2 resin coated with 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol.315 More novel was the use of 3D calibrations in the determination of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in geological samples by direct solid sampling ETV-AAS, with a comparison of the performance of transverse and longitudinal tube graphite furnaces.316
Because of its potential toxicity, it would be useful to determine the Tl content of sediments on a routine basis. However, ETV-AAS, a suitable technique for this type of analysis, suffers from a chloride interference that, up until now, has not been completely eliminated despite the efforts of many researchers. Vale and co-workers317 opted for direct solid sampling because they considered that the somewhat lower precision, compared with that achieved in the analysis of solutions, would be more than compensated for by a gain in accuracy of the results, as essentially no sample preparation was required other than some additional grinding. Even so, the determination of Tl in marine sediments necessitated the use of Zeeman background correction and application of chemical modifiers to control the spectral and non-spectral interferences caused by the relatively high chloride content. Villar et al.124 encountered similar problems when determining extractable Tl in sediments by ETV-AAS after application of the BCR sequential extraction scheme. They recommended the use of Pd as a matrix modifier, along with the omission of the pyrolysis stage and avoidance of HCl in the digestion mixture; the limit of detection in BCR extracts was 0.05 mg kg−1.


4.3.2 Atomic fluorescence spectrometry. 
Although there are few developments to report in atomic fluorescence spectrometry
(AFS), many laboratories frequently use this technique to determine Hg. Guo et al.318 proposed a new method for the determination of Hg by AFS following on-line solvent extraction covalent hydride generation in a non-aqueous medium. Ramalhosa et al.319 employed HPLC-cold vapour-AFS to separate and quantify methylHg and inorganic Hg. The use of UV radiation to oxidise organic forms of Hg and tin(II) chloride for the reduction in acidic medium and the introduction of a water vapour trap resulted in a low detection limit of 10 pg. D'Ulivo and colleagues320 sought to improve the analytical performance of hydride generation non-dispersive AFS by investigating the use of additives, such as L-cysteine and thiourea as masking agents, and optical filters to improve the signal to noise ratio.


4.3.3 Atomic emission spectrometry. 
The dearth of recent geoanalytical papers citing ICP-AES as the technique of choice might lead one to wonder whether geochemists have largely forsaken the technique for ICP-MS. Total S can be routinely measured by ICP-AES as part of a multielemental package, provided the spectrometer is purged of air because the analytical wavelengths for S lie in the UV. Okai et al.321 have contributed data for total S in 31 geochemical RMs using an ICP emission spectrometer fitted with a semiconductor photodiode detector. Results obtained from digestions in HF–HNO3–HClO4 acid mixtures were low compared to those in HF–aqua regia or from fusions. Because the high salt content in fusion solutions affects the performance of the ICP and results in lower sensitivity, HF–aqua regia digestions were preferred unless the sample type demanded a fusion for complete dissolution. Detection limits using a 0.1 g sample were 5 µg g−1 for the HF–aqua regia digestion and 15 µg g−1 from a fusion. Agnihotri and Sarin151 also digested their samples in HF–aqua regia before investigating spectral interferences during the determination of Mo by ICP-AES. They demonstrated the potential for overestimating Mo concentrations in geological samples if the interferences from iron and aluminium on the Mo lines at 202.074 and 281.615 nm, respectively, are not taken into account.
ICP-AES is not usually the technique of choice for the determination of the PGEs but several developments have been reported recently. Wu et al.322 devised a low temperature ETV-ICP-AES method employing gaseous sample introduction of Pd oxinate. They achieved a detection limit of 50 ng with an improvement of an order of magnitude in sensitivity compared to conventional ETV-ICP-AES. Choi et al.323 used anion exchange chromatography to preconcentrate Au, Pd and Pt from chromite ores in order to attain the sensitivity required for these measurements by ICP-AES.


4.3.4 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. 
Earth scientists have always been in the vanguard of developments in ICP-MS and this continues to be the case. For an authoritative account of the recent advances in ICP-MS, including magnetic sector instrumentation and laser ablation sample introduction, readers should consult the latest Atomic Spectrometry Update on atomic mass spectrometry.324 In geochemistry, one of the major growth areas has been the applications of magnetic sector ICP-MS. As a consequence, for the sake of clarity, the present author has decided to distinguish between developments using quadrupole-based ICP-MS and those in magnetic sector ICP-MS.
4.3.4.1 Quadrupole-based instrumentation. 
Even though quadupole ICP-MS instruments offer ever-increasing sensitivity, there are still applications that require the geoanalyst to employ separation and preconcentration techniques prior to detection. A number of these are covered in Section 4.2.3, including those for the determination of Hf, Nb, Ta and Zr,293 Hf, Th, Zr and the REE292 and Re207 in geological materials. The feasibility of quantifying As, Br, I and Se simultaneously by ICP-MS, after sintering and separation using a simple cation-exchange scheme, was assessed by Li and co-workers.325 With the bulk of the major and trace cations removed, limits of quantification of 0.04, 0.15, 0.03 and 0.004 µg g−1 were obtained for As, Br, I and Se, respectively; ammonia was effective in eliminating the memory effect of Br and I. Wang and Hansen326 explored a novel on-line separatation/preconcentration system incorporating a renewable ion-exchange micro-column interfaced with ICP-MS via a home-made direct injection high efficiency nebuliser. The procedure was validated by determining Ni and Bi in a river sediment CRM.
Over the last decade, ICP-MS has become an important source of data on the REE content of geological material. Well-known polyatomic interferences that require the application of correction factors become more significant when determining the REE at trace concentrations. Rather than opting for separation and preconcentration of the REE, Olive et al.327 applied an external correction procedure, based on the analysis of a RM closely matched in composition to the unknowns, to correct for interferences and variations in instrument sensitivity. Although this approach was shown to be successful for basaltic and ultramafic rocks down to REE abundances of ng g−1, it is unlikely to have universal application. Other research groups have been seeking to develop protocols that encompass a wide range of trace elements, including REE. Carignan and co-workers328 used flow injection ICP-MS in their routine procedure for the determination of over 40 trace elements following decomposition by fusion with LiBO2. For rocks containing very low concentrations of REE, U and Th, these elements were separated by on-line low pressure liquid chromatography before detection by ICP-MS. Duan et al.187 developed a procedure for the determination of more than 20 elements, including REE and HFSE, for the analysis of soils and sediments that have low calcium and magnesium contents. Their method was based on a Na2O2–NaOH fusion followed by a Fe(OH)3–Ti(OH)4 coprecipitation; batches of 30 samples could be processed in 6 h by a skilled technician. Jain et al.329 reported significant polyatomic interferences from zirconium fluoride on Sm and Eu when analysing zircons following a HF–HNO3 digestion.

Isotope dilution
(ID) generally provides better accuracy and precision than other calibration techniques, such as external calibration, because a ratio rather than an absolute value is measured. ID-ICP-MS has been successfully used to determine the Ag content of marine sediment digests.89 Both Ag isotopes are prone to polyatomic interferences from oxides and hydroxides of niobium and zirconium, so a mini-column packed with Dowex 1-X8 anion exchange resin was used to separate and preconcentrate Ag in an on-line FI system. Similarly, Inagaki et al.199 employed a co-precipitation method to remove tin and zirconium in digested marine sediments, prior to the measurement of Cd by ID-ICP-MS. The procedural blank for the co-precipitation separation was estimated to be less than 0.0001 µg g−1. The advantages of combining ID with chemical separation prior to ICP-MS measurement were exploited by Pin and Joannon in determining Th and U at low levels in silicate geological materials.197 They achieved external reproducibilities of about 1% RSD down to low ng g−1 concentrations.

Dynamic reaction cells
(DRCs) have been used in several different modes to circumvent interferences known to occur during analysis by ICP-MS. Hattendorf et al.330 minimised the formation of metal argide ions in the determination of Nb and Zr in chromium-rich samples using hydrogen as the reaction gas. The formation of CrOx+ ions was enhanced when the DRC was operated in pressurised mode. Simpson and co-workers331 used oxygen to actively promote the oxidation of interfering species to higher oxides in a DRC to effect a separation of analyte from an interfering oxide. Thus, oxides of the HFSE (Zr, Nb, Hf and Ta), which interfere with the measurement of Ag, Au, Pd and Pt, were virtually eliminated at a high oxygen flow of 2.3 ml min−1. Ion–molecule reactions in a DRC have been used to reduce the 87Rb isobaric interference on 87Sr in the measurement of stronium isotope ratios by monitoring the SrF+ ion beams formed by the reaction of Sr with CH3F.332 The precision of the 87Sr∶86Sr isotope ratio measured was close to counting statistics, without any chemical separation from Rb, and the resultant Rb/Sr age determinations of magmatic rocks had precisions of the same order of those measured by TIMS.
Although the measurement of very precise isotope ratios is the domain of multiple-collector ICP-MS, useful data can be obtained by quadrupole ICP-MS, particularly for environmental applications. Recent examples include the determination of 240Pu∶239Pu for the rapid dating of recent aquatic sediments333 and studies of the geochemical behaviour of Pu in marine sediments,334 as well as 238U∶/235U ratios in stream sediments to monitor the distribution and fate of waste discharged by a uranium enrichment plant.191
4.3.4.2 Magnetic sector instrumentation. 

Magnetic sector ICP-MS instruments are more expensive than quadrupole-based instruments but provide enhanced sensitivity and higher mass resolution. Gäbler335 has reviewed the applications of single- and multiple-collector magnetic sector ICP-MS in different fields of geochemistry and indicated where the use of magnetic sector ICP-MS is advantageous.

Single collector ICP sector field (SF)MS instruments are optimised for high ion transmission at high mass resolution. Consequently, they can be used in high resolution mode to avoid polyatomic interferences without the need for chemical separation. Most of the REE can be determined at low mass resolution (R
= 300) but a resolution of 3000 was required to determine Sc accurately in river sediments.336 However, for the determination of Pd in rocks, only a small part of the interferences can be spectrally resolved and alternative strategies employing high-performance ion chromatography (HPIC)-ICP-SF-MS at low resolution were preferred by Hann and colleagues.337 Koellensperger et al.338 analysed rock samples for Ir by ICP-SF-MS after a complete microwave-assisted acid digestion with HF–HCl–HNO3. Limits of detection of 6 and 15 pg g−1, respectively, were obtained at a mass resolution of 400 using membrane desolvation and at a mass resolution of 9500 without desolvation.
Multiple collector ICP-MS (MC-ICP-MS) continues to attract much attention and is fuelling a great diversity of applications in the earth sciences. High precision Pb isotope ratio measurements can be achieved using thallium as an internal standard to account for mass discrimination and instrumental drift339 as well as matrix effects for samples with total dissolved contents less than 700 mg l−1.340 However, Thirlwall341 has shown that the assumption that the mass bias for thallium is similar to that of Pb may not be entirely justified, because of the unusual solution chemistry of thallium in the nebuliser. He used a 207Pb–204Pb double spike to accurately correct for mass bias and improve the external precision. Inappropriate tail corrections may also account for large inaccuracies in Pb isotope determinations by MC-ICP-MS.342
The ability of MC-ICP-MS to provide precise measurements, often comparable to results obtained from TIMS, for a wide range of radiogenic isotope systems is well recognised. However, many recent papers do little more than report the transfer of existing TIMS methods to new MC-ICP-MS instruments. There is now a drive to simplify the tedious sample preparation procedures that were necessary when the technique of choice was TIMS. A combined chemical separation of Hf, Lu, Nd, Sm and the REE from a single sample digest for the study of Sm–Nd and Lu–Hf isotope systematics295 and a single column separation procedure for the purification of Hf and Lu by ion exchange296 have been devised. In some cases sample preparation may be virtually eliminated, as in the measurement of 87Sr∶86Sr ratios in carbonates.343 Currently the use of the Re–Os isotopic system as a geochronometer is limited because of the lack of accurate gravimetric standards for the preparation of Os spiking solutions. This should improve now that Yin and co-workers344 have demonstrated that anhydrous K2OsCl6 can be used to prepare an Os spike calibration to an accuracy of ±0.2%. Various approaches to the determination of Th and U isotope ratios in silicate rocks by MC-ICP-MS have been published during the review period.345,346
The list of elements for which MC-ICP-MS isotope data are available is growing continually. Rehkamper et al.347 published an in-depth investigation of Tl isotope variations in marine materials. Lithium isotope ratios in igneous rocks were obtained after a single-step column separation,348 Mo isotopic compositions were precisely determined by adding a Mo double spike prior to chemical separation349 and the Mg isotopic compositions of various materials were examined by minimising the contributions of C2+, CN+ and MgH+ molecular species.350


4.3.5 Other mass spectrometric techniques. 
For many years precise isotope ratio measurements were almost exclusively the domain of TIMS. However, with the advent of MC-ICP-MS this is changing rapidly. It is therefore timely that Birck has reviewed the present status of TIMS.351 One advantage that TIMS has over MC-ICP-MS is its better yield, defined as ions measured per atoms consumed, making TIMS the more attractive technique where limited sample mass is available or increased precision is required for samples of the usual size. Birck concluded that the theoretical limits of precision could only be achieved for a few elements, such as Os, and that significant effort in development would be required to attain the same performance for a number of other elements.
Various improvements in analytical methodologies for TIMS have been reported during the current review period. Yokoyama and co-workers developed a new method of determining highly precise 234U∶238U ratios from a very small amount (10–100 ng) of U, based on the measurement of UO2+ ions.352 A simplified procedure for the measurement of Pb isotopic composition of very small samples, using two-stage column chromatography without requiring the use of a double spike, was proposed by Kuritani and Nakamura.353 More unusual was the novel application of oxygen isotope analysis of uranium oxides by TIMS to identify the origin of uranium oxides in nuclear forensic science.354 Wang et al.355 described an improved procedure for the separation and purification of B using a B-specific resin, Amberlite IRA743, followed by a mixed ion exchange resin, prior to measurement by positive TIMS.

Accelerator mass spectrometry
(AMS) is used in archaeology, geology and environmental science for the analysis of 10Be, 14C, 36Cl and other cosmogenic radionuclides. It is also the technique of choice for the detection of long-lived radionuclides that cannot be practically analysed with decay counting or conventional mass spectrometry. Tuniz356 has reviewed the current position of AMS with recent applications, but his paper is of limited value as it does not quote any references. Accurate and reliable 14C chronologies have been developed for loess deposits using a chemical protocol to extract the organic matter from the loess prior to dating by AMS.357 The ages obtained were in good agreement with data from luminescent measurements. Minami and Nakamura358 constructed a system to extract C from meteorites using a vacuum-tight rf melting method to study radiocarbon activities in meteorites by AMS; they achieved collection efficiencies of about 90%. Carbon-14 dating has been used to date peat deposits7 as an alternative to the more customary 210Pb method, and was applied to the identification of temporal changes in mercury concentrations in Danish and Greenland peat cores.

Secondary ion mass spectrometry
(SIMS) has been successfully employed by earth scientists for in situ analysis of picogramme amounts of material and to record spatial information. Larocque et al.359 used SIMS to evaluate the importance of magnetite and FeTi oxides as hosts for Au in igneous rocks and hydrothermal ore deposits. Hauri et al.360 described in situ determinations of N abundance, δ13C and δ15N in diamonds by SIMS. The high transmission and sensitivity of the current generation of SIMS instruments means they are not only capable of determining 207Pb∶206Pb ratios in monazites,361 and U–Pb dating of detrital zircons,362 but can make significant contributions in the field of light stable isotopes. Aleon and co-workers363 developed a new procedure to measure O isotope ratios and, more generally, stable isotope ratios in microparticles with a few ‰ precision, using quantitative imaging with a scanning microbeam. Ion images were acquired with an electron multiplier and image processing allowed computation of isotopic ratios in selected areas. The accuracy of this method was assessed for the determination of 18O∶16O ratios in quartz and magnetite RMs powdered to a grain size of 2–5 µm. They also applied this technique to interplanetary dust particles,364 where they determined 1H∶2H, 12C∶13C, 16O∶18O, 27Al and 28Si to identify their origins. The recent availability of quantitative data from a suite of large gem crystals, in which light elements are major constituents, represents a major step towards the routine analysis of the light elements in geological materials by techniques such as SIMS.254
Although spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS) is not widely used in geoscience, Jochum and co-workers365 reported on progress in multi-ion counting SSMS in the analysis of geological samples. For a wider assessment of recent developments in all aspects of atomic mass spectrometry, the reader is referred to the recent JAAS Update on this subject.324


4.3.6 X-ray techniques. 
Routine applications of XRF to geological materials received during the period under review include the analysis of gravity cores,366 polluted lake and river sediments,367,368 new geological RMs369 and raw materials for the glass and ceramic industries.370 XRF spectrometers are important tools for gathering extraterrestrial elemental data and many of the more interesting developments in XRF technology are targeted towards this area of application. NASA is funding the development of an instrument capable of capturing both XRD and XRF information using a charge-coupled device as the X-ray detector.371 Because of its capabilities and small size it could be used in future Mars missions for the analysis of rocks. Details of the techniques used to measure the surface composition of asteroid 433 Eros remotely,372 and the compact imaging XRF instrument designed to map the Moon,373 have been published recently. Back on Earth, the practicalities of analysing very small samples of meteorites, with masses of no more than 120 mg, by XRF have been described by Wolf and Palme.374
Factors that affect the accuracy of measurements by XRF have been considered in a number of papers. Borkhodoev375 re-examined the accuracy of the fundamental parameters (FP) method in relation to the analysis of rocks and studied the factors contributing to the FP uncertainties. Bosch-Reig et al.376 looked at the possibility of applying a substitution-dilution method to correct for matrix interferences. The routine control of accuracy in silicate rock analysis was assessed by Vendemiatto and Enzweiler377 and the statistical basis for the validation of an XRF method for the analysis of iron ores evaluated by Pereira and Brando.378 For measurements on pressed powders, it is important to eliminate particle size effects as a source of inaccuracy. Mzyk et al.379 described their procedure for eliminating such effects for powdered samples of copper ores, concentrates and slags, by the addition of internal standards in the form of powders with a very small grain size.
There have been more reports than usual of the use of synchrotron radiation
(SR) as an excitation source for XRF for geological applications, although this is probably due to quirks of the abstracting system rather than any other factor. SR-XRF was used to determine REE distributions in lunar rocks,380 trace metal profiles in ferromanganese nodules381 and spatially resolved information about the structural and chemical properties of individual particles of fly ash.21,382 The technique has also attracted attention for the analysis of individual fluid inclusions, although much of the data presented was semi-quantitative.383–385 The feasibility of obtaining 3D elemental images of fluid inclusions, consisting of multiphase and irregular objects trapped in a host mineral, was established by Menez and co-workers,386 using a third generation synchrotron light source.
Although most earth scientists have limited access to proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE) facilities, there have been several reports of the use of PIXE to provide high resolution elemental data for geochemical applications. These have included the mapping of U in potassium-bearing minerals,387 the distribution of elements in Au and base metal ore deposits,388 detailed documentation of mineral assemblages389 and monazite geochronology.390 Workers at the new CSIRO–GEMOC nuclear microprobe facility have been engaged on developing methods for the analysis and imaging of fluid and melt inclusions.391–394
