    , Accepted 5th September 2016First published on 8th September 2016AbstractIn this work, we designed three dyes (Ru1, Ru2, and Ru3) by modifying the square-planar quadridentate ligand of the experimental Ru(II) complex K1, [RuL(trans-NCS)2] with L = dimethyl-6,60-bis(methyl-2-pyridylamino)-2,20-bipyridine-4,40-dicarboxylate, from a theoretical viewpoint. As is known, K1 shows obvious advantages over the famous dye N749 in light absorption ability because of its highly conjugated ancillary ligands. Density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory methods were used to determine the geometrical structures, electronic structures and absorption spectra of the dye complexes. A quantum dynamics method in conjunction with extended Hückel theory was used to simulate the interfacial electron transfer process at the dye–TiO2 interface. The calculated results suggest that Ru1, which contains arylmethane groups, presents improved light absorption and efficient interfacial electron transfer compared with the reference dye K1. We also verified that the position of the anchoring carboxylic acid groups could largely guide the rate of interfacial electron transfer. Ru3, whose anchoring groups are attached to pyridine rings, would have significantly faster interfacial electron transfer than Ru2, whose anchoring groups are attached to the pyrrole ligands; this is because varying the position of the anchoring group results in a difference in the extent of electron donor–acceptor orbital interactions. We expect that the current study will provide some theoretical guidelines for the experimental synthesis of novel Ru(II) complex dyes.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention in the past two decades due to their low cost and potentially high efficiency for converting solar energy to electricity.1–6 A typical DSSC consists of four ingredients: the dye sensitizer; the wide band gap TiO2 semiconductor; and the I−/I3− redox electrolyte and counter electrode. In DSSCs, the dye is employed to absorb light radiation, and the photo-excited electrons are subsequently transferred to the TiO2 semiconductor. Through this process, the absorption range can be efficiently extended to the visible region, which dominates the solar spectrum. The performance of DSSCs depends largely on their light harvesting efficiencies (LHE) and interfacial electron transfer (IET).7 Generally speaking, a large LHE, which is directly related to the intensity and coverage of the absorption spectrum, is a prerequisite for achieving better photocurrent performance. The fast IET between the dye and TiO2 could, in principle, minimize the loss of the utilized photon energy as heat through the electron–phonon relaxation pathway.8 Modification of dyes offers a promising strategy for tuning the above two factors.
Ru(II) complexes, such as the black dye N749,9 are the most successful dyes for DSSC applications at present. Ru(II) complex dyes usually exhibit broad absorption coverage and improved molar absorptivity with long-term stability. One of the main drawbacks of Ru(II) complex dyes is that they show weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions; this usually results in poor performance for harvesting sunlight.10 In this respect, substantial research efforts have been devoted to the design of novel Ru(II) complex dyes with excellent light-absorption abilities.11–23 The N749 dye features three –NCS ligands, which could possibly lead to several issues: (1) poor NIR sensitization due to the lack of an effective chromophore; (2) weak Ru–NCS bonds, resulting in decreased stability of the dye complex; and (3) low synthetic yield because of the conformation isomers of the –NCS moiety. Fortunately, there have been many attempts to replace or reduce the monodentate –NCS ligand.24 It should be noted that NCS-free Ru(II) complexes also display relatively low light-absorption abilities.25,26 Bearing these points in mind, recently, a new Ru(II) complex (K1, see Fig. 1) featuring a square-planar quadridentate ligand with arylamine moieties and two –NCS ligands was synthesized and reported by Inomata et al.27 The square-planar quadridentate ligand maintains the trans-coordination of the two –NCS ligands in K1. The trans-coordination has extended absorption in the longer wavelength region compared with the cis-coordination. Moreover, the arylamine moiety has excellent electron donating capability and is effective in raising the energy levels of the corresponding molecular orbitals;28–30 this could contribute to a broad and red-shifted absorption. Indeed, experimental results suggest that K1 displays obvious advantages over the famous N749 in its light absorption ability.27 It is therefore essential to develop new dyes with excellent photocurrent performance based on K1. From the experimental point of view, the design of dyes often involves a trial-and-error approach, which is quite time-consuming and non-economical. Therefore, it is essential to screen out possible candidates prior to experimental tests. Theoretical investigations based on the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) methods can be of great help for designing novel sensitizers with targeted properties.
 Fig. 1  Schematic structures of the K1, Ru1, Ru2, and Ru3 dyes. 
Inspired by these rectifiers, with K1 as the reference dye, we theoretically designed a series of novel Ru(II) complex dyes (namely Ru1, Ru2, and Ru3, as shown in Fig. 1). In K1, the presence of arylamine moieties forms a conjugated ancillary ligand; the conjugation is further enhanced in Ru1 due to the unusual arylmethane ligand. Ru2 features two pyrrole ligands, in contrast to Ru1, and the anchoring carboxylic acid groups, –COOH, are attached to the pyrrole ligands. Ru3 differs from Ru2 only in the position of the anchoring group; that is, the –COOH groups are moved to the pyridine ligand in Ru3. We expect that this modification will have profound effects on IET because the excited state of the dye should be located around the anchoring group to facilitate electron injection; this is closely related to the position of the anchoring group. DFT/TDDFT calculations were used to address the geometrical structures, electronic structures, and absorption spectra of the isolated dyes and the interface details of dye/TiO2 combined systems. The simulation of IET was performed using the semi-classical quantum dynamics approach, which is based on the semi-empirical extended Hückel theory (EHT) method. The calculated results suggest that the corresponding absorption properties and electronic structures, as well as the IET dynamics, can be efficiently tuned with these modifications; as a result, potential high efficiency Ru(II) complex dyes could be identified.
2. Computation details
The geometry optimization of the free dye was performed using the B3LYP functional,31 the LanD2Z pseudopotential basis set32–34 was used to describe the central Ru atom and the 6-31G(d) basis set35,36 was used for other atoms (C, H, N, O, S). Based on the optimized ground state geometry, the vertical excitations were calculated by the TDDFT method using the combination of basis sets described above. Here, we used different functionals, such as B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP,37 and LC-wPBE,38–40 in the TDDFT calculations. Regarding the benchmark calculations, 135 singlet → singlet allowed transitions were calculated. Solvent effects (n,n-dimethylformamide, DMF) were included in the calculations by means of the polarizable continuum model (PCM). All calculations of the isolated dye complexes were carried out using the Gaussian09 package.41 In order to gain insights into dye/TiO2 interactions, we constructed a periodically repeated TiO2 anatase (101) surface which was modeled by a (TiO2)80 supercell comprising two layers of Ti and O atoms. The vacuum layer was larger than 15 Å to avoid artificial interactions between successive slabs. For the optimization of the dye/TiO2 combined system, we employed the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).42–45 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional46 with the Projector Augmented-Wave (PAW) method47,48 were used in the calculations of extended systems. Note that the PBE functional was chosen over B3LYP and other hybrid functionals because of its relatively small computational cost. The dye/(TiO2)80 interface structure was optimized at a single Gamma k-point and a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The bottom layer of the TiO2 slab was fixed at its bulk position, and the remaining layers together with the dye complexes were allowed to move until the forces on the atoms were less than 0.02 eV Å−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometrical structures of isolated dyes
The optimized ground state structures of the isolated dyes are shown in Fig. 2, and some selected geometrical parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Note that experimental data on the geometrical parameters of the reference K1 dye are still unavailable as of now.27 Examination of the data listed in Table S1 (ESI†) shows that all the calculated values of the geometrical parameters are similar. All the dyes display nearly square-planar geometry, as shown by the dihedral angle of θN1–N2–N3–N4. The calculated Ru–N bond lengths fall in the range of 1.982 to 2.188 Å; the bite-angles of the chelating ligands are approximately right angles, close to 90°, which are in good agreement with previous theoretical and experimental investigations of other related Ru(II) complexes.15,17,19,23 This validates the chosen method for predicating the geometrical parameters of the under-investigated dye complexes. Despite the similarities, there are also minor differences between the calculated results for the four complexes. For example, the Ru–N bond lengths of the symmetric positions are closer to each other, i.e., for K1, N1 and N2 or N3 and N4 atoms have the same chemical environments, and thus the bond lengths are 2.129 Å for Ru–N1 and Ru–N2 and 2.041 Å for Ru–N3 and Ru–N4. The values of rows 5–6 suggest that the Ru–NCS bond is bent, with a maximum skewing of ca. 10°, for Ru2. Bent Ru–NCS bonds are common in Ru(II) complexes.15,23

3.2 Properties of frontier molecular orbitals
The properties of frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) are very important in determining the charge-separation process in DSSCs. In order to favor efficient charge separation from the dye to the TiO2 semiconductor, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) should be localized around the electron donor moiety and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) should be localized around the electron acceptor moiety. To understand how variations in the structures affect the spatial distribution of FMO, we present the isodensity plots of the FMOs for all dyes in Fig. 3. The partial densities of states and the corresponding schematic FMO energy diagrams are shown in Fig. 4. As is shown, the higher-energy HOMOs (HOMO and HOMO–1) show main contributions from the mixed orbitals of the central Ru atom and the two axial –NCS ligands in different percentages; the higher-energy HOMOs originate from the non-bonding combinations of the Ru d orbitals with the p orbitals of the –NCS ligands. In addition, it is shown that the S atom from the –NCS ligand makes a considerable contribution to the outermost orbitals of these dyes. Due to the similar distribution, HOMO−1 is degenerate with HOMO, and they have nearly the same energy. In contrast, the lower HOMOs, i.e., HOMO−7, lying ca. 2.0 eV below the HOMO, are largely distributed over the central Ru atom and ancillary ligands. Meanwhile, the three lower-energy LUMOs (LUMO, LUMO+1, and LUMO+2) involve less contribution from the –NCS ligand. In particular, the LUMOs in K1 and Ru1 exhibit distribution asymmetry and populate dominantly over the ancillary ligands containing the anchoring carboxylic acid groups. This is due to the geometrical asymmetry of the ancillary ligands and the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the anchoring carboxylic acid groups. In addition, for K1, Ru1, and Ru3, the anchoring carboxylic acid groups make considerable contributions to the LUMOs; this could favor fast electron injection from the dye excited states to the TiO2 semiconductor conduction band (CB), which is responsible for higher power conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, for Ru2, the LUMO orbital has fewer electrons located at the anchoring carboxylic acid group compared with the other three dye complexes. This is unfavorable for electronic coupling between the dye excited states and the TiO2 CB and possibly results in slow electron injection processes.

Because of the marked change in the orbital distribution compared with the other three dye complexes, the energies of the LUMOs are significantly destabilized in Ru2. This downshift in the energy levels leads to shrinking of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap. The calculated results show that Ru2 and Ru3 have much smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gaps than the reference dye K1, whereas Ru1 shows a comparable energy gap. The calculated HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of the four dyes increase as follows: Ru2 < Ru3 < K1 ≈ Ru1. A smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap tends to result in red-shifted and broadened absorption. For Ru2 and Ru3, the change in the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps is mainly due to the variation of the LUMO energy levels. This confirms that modification of the ancillary ligand is an efficient way to tune the electronic properties of Ru(II) complexes. From the energetic point of view, the energy level of the dye LUMO should be higher than the TiO2 CB to permit an adequate driving force for efficient IET, and the energy level of the dye HOMO should be more negative than the I−/I3− redox potential to facilitate dye regeneration. It is shown that, for all dyes, the energy levels of the HOMO are sufficiently lower than the I−/I3− redox potential (−4.6 eV),49 ensuring fast regeneration of the oxidized dyes. Meanwhile, the energy levels of the LUMO (except for Ru2) are located at ca. −2.5 to −3.5 eV and are higher than the TiO2 CB (−4.0 eV),50 permitting efficient electron injection. For Ru2, the LUMO orbital energy is very close to the TiO2 CB; this leads to inefficient electron injection.
3.3 Optical absorption spectra
Based upon the optimized ground state geometries, TDDFT calculations were carried out to obtain the optical spectra. It is widely accepted that for charge-transfer excitations, TDDFT calculations with traditional functionals may lead to errors on the order of several electron volts; range-separated hybrid functionals could be a means to remedy this problem. Fig. S1 (ESI†) presents the simulated absorption spectra of K1 calculated with different range-separated functionals. It should be noted that the experimental absorption spectrum of K1 shows a broad absorption from the visible region to the near-infrared region. The lowest-lying excitation energies (λmax) are determined to be ca. 590 nm and the dominant absorption band is between 400 and 500 nm, according to experiments. As shown from Fig. S1 (ESI†), different functionals can give rise to strikingly different absorption spectra. For K1, the absorption in the near-infrared region of the spectrum is absent when the LC-wPBE and CAM-B3LYP functionals are employed. The λmax values calculated with LC-wPBE and CAM-B3LYP are ca. 428 and 508 nm, respectively, which are blue shifted with respect to the experimental values. The absorption spectrum obtained by B3LYP shows peaks at ca. 715 nm with a small oscillator strength of 0.0207, which has not been detected experimentally. Moreover, the B3LYP results show two additional peaks at ca. 607 and 498 nm with considerable oscillator strengths of 0.0431 and 0.0837. Overall, the B3LYP functional gives the best agreement with the experimental trend on the relative positions of the absorption bands among the three functionals; therefore, it was used as the method of choice for further calculation of the absorption properties. Indeed, the TD-B3LYP method has been widely used to calculate the absorption spectra of Ru(II) complex dyes.
Next, we focused on a comparison of the absorption spectra between K1 and the newly designed dyes Ru1, Ru2, and Ru3. The simulated absorption spectra for the four dyes obtained at the TD-B3LYP/LanL2DZ//6-31G(d) level of theory are presented in Fig. 5. The absorptions between 400 and 800 nm are presented because only the visible and NIR regions of the solar spectrum can be harvested effectively. The calculated electronic excitations and oscillator strengths, as well as their main assignments for the most relevant excitations of the absorption bands, are listed in Table 1. Other excitations are disregarded due to their negligible intensities. As can be seen from Fig. 5, all complexes show broad absorption from the visible region up to the near-infrared region. Particularly, for K1, the absorption bands are predicated between 400 and 800 nm, as noted above. The strongest absorption, predicated at 498 nm, is attributed to the HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 transition. According to the above discussions on electronic structure, the HOMO−1 orbital originates from the Ru d and –NCS p orbitals, and LUMO+1 is a mixture of the arylamine and −COOH π* orbitals. Therefore, the HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 transition can be assigned to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in character. Ru1 exhibits a similar absorption band to K1; however, the absorption spectrum is largely broadened along with stronger intensity. For example, the major absorption of Ru1 is predicated at 501 nm; however, the intensity is significantly stronger than that of K1. Ru2 has well-resolved absorption bands at 736, 613, and 478 nm. The strongest absorption peak (at 478 nm) results from the HOMO−7 → LUMO transition and can be attributed to ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT); it is different from that of K1 and Ru1. Ru3 has three relatively weak absorption peaks with respect to Ru2. The strongest absorption of Ru3 is located at 444 nm and also has MLCT character. It is known that the LHE is related to the character of the absorption band; that is to say, a dye with an absorption peak towards the longer wavelength region and a stronger absorption band would have a large LHE. It is obvious from Fig. 5 that the absorption spectra in the selected range for the newly designed dyes are significantly broader and stronger than that of K1. The broader and stronger absorption spectrum more closely matches the solar spectrum, which probably induces improved performance.

3.4 The dye/TiO2 interface
In order to gain deeper insights into the interface interaction details, in the following we will address the geometrical structures, electronic structures, and IET processes of the dye/TiO2 combined systems. Numerous adsorption configurations exist between Ru complex dyes and the TiO2(101) surface, as is the case for the adsorption modes.51–56 Fourier transform infrared spectra experiments have suggested that inorganic and organic chromophores with anchoring carboxylic acid groups adsorbed onto the TiO2(101) surface usually adopt dissociative bidentate bridging modes.57 This has also been demonstrated by previous theoretical studies.52,56 Therefore, for the convenience of discussion, the bidentate bridging mode was adopted for dye adsorption in the current work, although some differences may arise for other adsorption modes. We emphasize that our goal is to qualitatively evaluate the differences in interface interactions in the same adsorption mode among the investigated dyes. The corresponding adsorption geometries after optimization are shown in Fig. 6. Also, the important bond lengths and adsorption energies are listed in Table 2. As can be seen in Table 2, all the dyes show a rather strong adsorption onto the TiO2(101) surface, and the interface Ti–O bond lengths are similar for all cases. The calculated Ti–O bond lengths are 2.093 and 2.112 Å for K1, 2.060 and 2.139 Å for Ru1, 2.068 and 2.034 Å for Ru2, and 2.053 and 2.114 Å for Ru3. It is noteworthy that the two Ti–O bond lengths at the dye–TiO2 interface are different because the deprotonation of the –OH moiety from the anchoring carboxylic group leads to the transfer of a proton to the surface oxygen atom, which results in a difference in the acidity of the under-coordinated surface Ti atom; a more acidic Ti atom tends to form stronger Ti–O interactions (short Ti–O bond length). The adsorption energy Eads for dye adsorption is defined as Eads = Edye+TiO2 − Edye − ETiO2, where Edye+TiO2, Edye, and ETiO2 represent the total energies of the dye/TiO2 combined system, free dye, and isolated TiO2 slab, respectively. A negative value of Eads is indicative of stable adsorption. As shown in Table 2, the calculated adsorption energies are about −4.30, −3.74, −3.19, and −3.89 eV for K1, Ru1, Ru2, and Ru3, respectively, which are adequately large to allow chemisorption of the dye on the TiO2 surface.

In order to clarify the bonding mechanism, we present the charge density difference, which was calculated by subtracting the charge density of the dye/TiO2 combined system from that of the individual dye and TiO2 components, in Fig. 7. It can be seen that for K1, Ru1, and Ru3, the charge accumulation and depletion regions mostly occur at the dye/TiO2 interface, with considerable contributions from the partial dye and TiO2 components. Whereas for Ru2, the charge density is highly localized at the dye complex. It has been widely accepted that significant charge redistribution centered at the dye/TiO2 interface is favorable for the formation of covalent bond, which is an indication of strong interaction. The strong interaction could significantly promote electron transfer from the dye to TiO2via the dye–TiO2 interface. Therefore, we can infer that the interaction between Ru2 and TiO2 is rather weak compared with the other three dyes; this also coincides with the smallest adsorption energy of Ru2. Overall, intuitive plots of charge density difference for the four dyes validate the data of the adsorption energies presented in Table 2. Photo-excitation of the dye from its ground state to the excited state which is in resonance with the TiO2 CB; then, the electron is injected from the dye to the TiO2 surface. As suggested by Fermi's golden rule, the rate of electron injection is proportional to the nonadiabatic coupling or overlapping of the electron donor and acceptor states. In order to maximize the electron injection, significant hybridization between the dye excited state (electron donor orbital) and the TiO2 CB (electron acceptor orbital) is required. Fig. 8 presents the band-decomposed partial charge distributions of the electron donor and acceptor orbitals. The electron should be excited from the ground state of the dye (HOMO) to the excited state (LUMO), and then the excited state electron is injected to the TiO2 conduction band; therefore, for a dye/TiO2 combined system, the electron donor orbital is usually chosen as the low energy conduction band with the largest contribution from the dye molecule, whereas the electron acceptor orbital is chosen as the TiO2 conduction band edge. As shown, for all dyes, the electron acceptor orbital corresponds to the CB edge, which is delocalized over the TiO2 surface with no charge distribution residing in the dye complexes. Meanwhile, the electron donor orbital, which corresponds to the dye LUMO orbitals (not exactly the same), has a large contribution from the TiO2 substrate (except for Ru2). This distribution of electron donor and acceptor orbitals ensures a strong orbital interaction and favors efficient electron transfer. For Ru2, the electron donor orbital is confined within the dye complex; this minimizes the donor–acceptor overlap. Therefore, upon formation of the Ru2/TiO2 interface, the electron cannot be efficiently excited from the ground state of the dye to its excited state and then transferred to the TiO2 CB, leading to inefficient charge separation.

In order to quantitatively estimate the rate of IET among the four dyes, we performed semi-classical quantum dynamics simulations of the dye/TiO2 combined systems following a previously reported methodology based on the semi-empirical EHT method. This method requires fewer transferable parameters (1 to 9 parameters per atom), providing an excellent cost-benefit option for accurate description of chemical bonding and energy bands in very large periodic systems. This method is, therefore, suitable to provide a clear chemical picture of the nature of the electronic excitations and the IET mechanism at the semi-quantitative level. Indeed, the EHT method has been successfully applied in the analysis of IET for studies of sensitized TiO2 surfaces.8,58–61 For more details regarding the implementation of this method, please refer to ref. 59 and 62. Fig. 9 presents the relaxation dynamics of IET starting from the initial electron donor state for the four dyes. The population is the time-dependent survival probability that the electron is still in the dye complex at time t. Propagation is performed by integrating the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) analytically in sufficiently small time intervals of 0.5 fs for 5000 fs simulation time. The electron population decreases as a result of nonadiabatic coupling between the electron donor and acceptor states. It is shown that for K1, Ru1, and Ru3, the electron is almost completely injected after t ∼ 5000 fs. Meanwhile, for Ru2, the IET time is significantly longer than for the other three dyes. The decay curves of K1, Ru1, and Ru3 can be well fitted by the exponential function f(t) = exp(−t/τ), which allows us to conclude that the three dyes undergo ultra-fast electron transfer events from the dye excited state to the TiO2 CB (∼0.5 ps for K1, ∼1.0 ps for Ru1, and ∼1.7 ps for Ru3). Exponential fitting of the decay curve of Ru2 to a first-order expansion, f(t) = 1 − exp(t/τ) ≈ t/τ, gives the time scale of IET. As shown, the relaxation time in Ru2 is about 200.1 ps, which is more than two orders of magnitude slower than that of the K1, Ru1, and Ru3 dyes. The significantly slow electron injection in Ru2 is attributed to its weak electron donor and acceptor interactions, as noted above. This suggests that attachment of the anchoring carboxylic acid group to the pyrrole ancillary ligand may not form an efficient interface with the TiO2 surface for fast IET.

4. Conclusions
We have theoretically investigated a series of Ru(II) complex dyes (Ru1, Ru2, and Ru3) with unusual square-planar quadridentate ligands based on K1. The key properties of these dyes, such as their geometrical structures, electronic structures, absorption spectra and IET, are discussed explicitly.
Our calculated results show that for all the dyes, the HOMOs dominantly originate from the combination of the Ru d orbital and the p orbitals of the –NCS ligands; meanwhile, the LUMOs mainly originate from the combination of the π* orbitals of the ancillary ligands. This orientation of the HOMOs and LUMOs benefits the intra-molecular charge transfer process. We noted that the HOMOs are lower in energy than the I−/I3− redox potential, indicating that the dye regeneration process will be efficient; the LUMOs are higher in energy than the TiO2 CB (except for Ru2), meaning that only K1, Ru1 and Ru3 will have thermal dynamics-allowed IET. All the designed dyes have better LHE than K1 due to their broader and stronger absorption bands in the visible region and the near-infrared region.
Inspection of the dye/TiO2 interface reveals that all the four dyes can stably adsorb onto the TiO2 surface. K1, Ru1 and Ru3 can form efficient interfaces with TiO2, and electron transfer from the three dyes to TiO2 occurs on an ultra-fast time scale (i.e., ∼0.5 ps for K1, ∼1.0 ps for Ru1, and ∼1.7 ps for Ru3). We also demonstrated that the position of the anchoring group has important effects on the IET efficiency; this can be understood from both the thermal dynamics and quantum dynamics points of view. The anchoring group is attached to the pyrrole moiety in Ru2 and to the pyridine moiety in Ru3; for Ru2, the LUMO energy is significantly downshifted, leading to an extremely small thermal dynamics-allowed driving force for electron injection. In addition, the time scale of IET dynamics for Ru2 (∼200.1 ps) is significantly slower than that for Ru3 due to the small extent of conjugation between the pyrrole and –COOH groups, which inhibits the spreading of the LUMO orbital distribution to the anchoring carboxylic acid group; thus, substantial state hybridization between the dye excited state and the TiO2 CB is unlikely to occur.
Overall, our results indicate that the newly designed dyes Ru1 and Ru3 would be promising dyes for achieving better performance than the reference K1 dye because they have much better light-harvesting efficiencies and comparable electron injection efficiencies. This work provides theoretical insights regarding the role of modification of the ancillary ligands of Ru(II) complexes, which is expected to provide valuable hints for the design of more efficient dyes for DSSC applications.
