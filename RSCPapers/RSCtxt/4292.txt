    , Accepted 31st October 2022First published on 31st October 2022AbstractPhotodetectors with excellent high-temperature performance and facile fabrication are desirable for harsh environment applications. Herein, we report high-temperature, self-powered PDs by adopting 0D–3D mixed-dimensional perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films and simple carbon-electrode device configuration. Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films are prepared through the water-based two-step spin-coating method, wherein the CsCl additive strategy for the PbBr2 precursor film is proposed and it is vital to the target film formation. Based on the optimized Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film, the self-powered, carbon-electrode PD with outstanding photodetection performance is obtained.

Moreover, 0D perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 can suppress the cubic to tetragonal phase transition of 3D perovskite CsPbBr2−xCl1+x, and thus the resulting PD can work effectively at ∼300 °C, for which a dark current density of 6.34 × 10−8 A cm−2, an on/off ratio of over 1.44 × 105, and a stable working duration of ∼300 min are achieved, indicating its excellent tolerance to high temperature and ideal compatibility for practical applications.
1. Introduction
Photodetectors (PDs) with the functionality of directly transforming light into electrical signals have become a significant research branch of optoelectronics and drawn tremendous attention.1–3 A variety of PDs from ultraviolet to terahertz response regions have been demonstrated over the past few decades, targeting their applications in optical communication, astronomy, photography, environment sensing, medical analysis, and safety equipment.4–7 With the development of PDs, the ones with extended ability to work under high-temperature harsh conditions are highly desired to be explored, especially for flame detection, space exploration, and military applications.8–12 It is generally accepted that the 5 S requirements including high sensitivity, high signal-to-noise ratio, high spectral selectivity, high speed, and high stability should be satisfied in terms of practical applications of PDs.6,13 As for high-temperature detection, the 5 S requirements are more important than for room temperature. The traditional PDs fabricated with Si and III–V compound semiconductors are susceptible to temperature fluctuation and easily degrade at elevated temperatures because of significantly increased dark current, finally hindering their widespread applications.14 Some wide bandgap semiconductors such as AlxGa1−xN,15 SiC,11,16 and Ga2O310,12 have been developed for high-temperature PDs. However, PDs based on them are often limited to operate below 200 °C, which cannot fulfill the abovementioned applications. Meanwhile, these high-temperature PDs are generally fabricated by photolithography, electron beam lithography, or focused ion beam technology,11,12,15,17,18 which are complicated, time-consuming, and uneconomic, thus hampering the development of practical routes. Therefore, the construction of high-temperature PDs with satisfactory performance and facile fabrication processes is still highly anticipated.
Recently, the emergence of all-inorganic perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I, or their mixtures) has attracted tremendous attention for optoelectronic devices owing to their ungraded stability and unique optoelectronic properties, including high optical absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, and tunable optical band gap, coupled with the low-cost and simple film preparation process.19–21 These properties render them promising for the fabrication of high-performance solar cells,22 light-emitting diodes,23 lasers,24 and especially emerging perovskite PDs.7 Numerous studies have been performed to explore all-inorganic perovskite PDs by optimizing the material features and designing device configurations. For example, Bao et al.25 introduced polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) to modify the substrate and obtain the CsPbIxBr3−x film with much improved film quality. The resulting PDs based on CsPbIBr2 and CsPbBr3 show detectable limits of tens of pW cm−2 and a fast response speed. Zeng et al.26 demonstrated poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA) interfacial-tunneling-layer-enhanced CsPbBr3 PDs featuring a photo-/dark-current ratio of 2.13 × 108 and a peak detectivity as high as 1.24 × 1013 Jones. Yang et al.27 employed polyethylene glycol (PEG) to passivate the localized defects in CsPbI2Br films through the Lewis acid–base interaction, which enables the PDs with optimized specific detectivity (D*) of 2.2 × 1011 Jones and a linear dynamic range of 116 dB. They reported recently a facile one-step spray-coating approach to deposit cesium lead halide perovskite thick films for filterless narrowband photodetectors, which exhibited a D* of 2.43 × 1010 Jones at 655 nm with an FWHM of 25 nm.28 In our previous work,29 we demonstrated a simple intermediate phase halide exchange method to prepare desired dual-phase CsPbCl3–Cs4PbCl6 films, which provide the self-powered, visible-blind UV PD a favored response range of 310–420 nm, a high R peak of 61.8 mA W−1, an exceptional D* maximum of 1.35 × 1012 Jones, and a particularly fast response speed of 2.1/5.3 μs. All these achievements consolidate the great promise of all-inorganic perovskite PDs. In spite of the significant progress, high-temperature all-inorganic perovskite PDs are rarely reported so far. This is mainly related to the unsatisfactory thermal stability of all-inorganic perovskite materials as well as the unstable organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) and metal electrodes of the PDs.30,31
Herein, we demonstrate for the first time high-temperature all-inorganic perovskite PDs by using 0D–3D mixed-dimensional perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films and the carbon-electrode device configuration. The 0D–3D films possess higher phase-transition temperatures than the 3D CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film, while the carbon-electrode device configuration avoids the use of organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) and metal electrodes that would affect the thermal stability of PDs because the degradation of the organic HTM and the ionization of the metal electrode would be accelerated at high temperatures. Based on the optimized Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films, carbon-electrode, a self-powered PD with a responsivity (R) peak value of 0.18 A W−1, a specific detectivity (D*) of 1.65 × 1013 Jones, coupled with a fast response time of 1.23 μs can be obtained. Moreover, it can work effectively at temperatures up to 300 °C, for which the dark current density of as low as 6.34 × 10−8 A cm−2 and the on/off ratio as high as 1.44 × 105 are achieved. And, it sustains the photodetection functionality for over 300 min at such a high operating temperature, indicating excellent tolerance to high temperatures and ideal compatibility for practical applications.
2. Results and discussion
The 0D–3D mixed-dimensional perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film was prepared by the water-based two-step spin-coating method, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). First, 100 μL of the PbBr2 precursor containing 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, or 0.15 M CsCl additive was spin-coated onto the FTO/TiO2 substrate. The 0.00 M CsCl represents the PbBr2 precursor without any additive. Next, the sample was thermally treated at 90 °C for 30 min to produce the PbBr2 film. After that, 100 μL of CsCl/H2O solution with a typical concentration of 0.7 M was spin-coated onto the as-obtained PbBr2 film. Finally, the sample was annealed at 350 °C to form the Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film. Note that the component ratio of 0D perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 and 3D perovskite CsPbBr2−xCl1+x can be simply regulated by adjusting either the dose of the CsCl additive in the PbBr2 film or the concentration of CsCl/H2O solution.

(b) XRD patterns of pristine PbBr2 films containing 0.00, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 M CsCl additive. (c) XRD results of Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films obtained with different PbBr2 films. All of them were prepared with 110 μL of CsCl/H2O solution with a constant concentration of 0.7 M. (d1–d4) SEM images of PbBr2 films and (e1–e4) SEM results of the as-obtained Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films prepared with (d1 and e1) 0.00 M, (d2 and e2) 0.05 M, (d3 and e3) 0.10 M, and (d4 and e4) 0.15 M CsCl additive. 

Fig. 1(b) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PbBr2 films prepared with 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 M CsCl additive. The XRD peaks at 18.75°, 23.73°, 30.66°, and 34.03° can be assigned to the (020), (111), (211), and (031) planes of orthorhombic phase PbBr2.32 By comparison, the additional XRD peaks such as the ones at 11.68°, 29.51°, and 30.33° can be identified for PbBr2 films with the CsCl additive. These XRD peaks are indexed to 2D perovskite CsPb2(BrCl)5,33,34 indicating that most of the CsCl additive is transformed into CsPb2(BrCl)5, remaining in the PbBr2 film as the secondary phase. Moreover, in terms of PbBr2 films formed with 0.1 M and 0.15 M CsCl additives, the extra XRD peaks at ∼15 were detected, which are indexed to 3D perovskite CsPbBr2−xCl1+x. In addition, one can see that the CsCl additive can transform the preferred orientation of the PbBr2 film from [020] to [031], since the (020) XRD peak is more intense for the PbBr2 film without the CsCl additive but the (031) XRD peaks are higher for those containing the CsCl additive.32,35 After deposition of CsCl/H2O solution and thermal annealing, all the PbBr2 films can be converted into perovskite films, which are mainly composed of CsPbBr2−xCl1+x, as indicated by their clear XRD peaks at ∼15.62°, 22.04°, and 38.69° (Fig. 1(c)).36,37 Besides, both 2D perovskite CsPb2(BrCl)5 and 0D perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 can be found from the sample based on the PbBr2 film without the CsCl additive,38,39 while the component of 2D perovskite CsPb2(BrCl)5 is absent in the films produced with PbBr2 films containing the CsCl additive, leading to the formation of 0D–3D mixed-dimensional perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films. Note that the additive concentration seems to have marginal influence on the component ratio of 0D perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 and 3D perovskite CsPbBr2−xCl1+x, as observed from the XRD patterns.
Furthermore, the influence of the CsCl additive on surficial morphology features of PbBr2 and Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with the results shown in Fig. 1(d1–d4) and Fig. S1 (ESI†) for PbBr2 films and Fig. 1(e1–e4) for Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films. The PbBr2 film without the CsCl additive has a flat surface and there are a few of randomly distributed pinholes in it. The pinholes multiply remarkably for PbBr2 films with the CsCl additive, wherein the one with the 0.10 M CsCl additive seems to possess the highest pinhole density among them and the surface of the one with the 0.15 M CsCl additive becomes rougher. In terms of perovskite film formation by a two-step solution reaction, a porous lead halide film with a flat surface makes the reaction occur more easily and leads to the formation of a pure-phase and compact film.40,41 Therefore, we speculate that the 0.10 M CsCl additive seems to be the best choice for preparing the target sample. As shown in Fig. 1(e1), some pores appear on the film prepared with PbBr2 without the CsCl additive, which is largely caused by the insufficient reaction between PbBr2 and CsCl, because the compact microstructure of the PbBr2 film blocks the downward diffusion of CsCl. Note that the pores easily stimulate the formation of shutting paths in the final PD, leading to its inferior performance. Fortunately, the use of the CsCl additive enables the formation of Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films with full coverage and clear grain boundaries. Moreover, the Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film obtained with the 0.10 M CsCl additive exhibits coarser grains than the other two. The average grain sizes are estimated to be 0.39, 0.62, and 0.58 μm for Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films prepared with 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 M CsCl additives, respectively.
On the other hand, the effects of the CsCl/H2O concentration on morphological and structural properties of Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films were studied, wherein the concentration of the CsCl additive was fixed at 0.10 M. Fig. 2(a–c) present the SEM images of Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films produced with 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M CsCl/H2O, respectively. All of them are composed of closely packed crystalline grains with full surface coverage, wherein the triple-junction grain boundaries with a predominant equal vertex angle of 120° can be identified. The Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film prepared with 0.7 M CsCl/H2O exhibits quite a flat surface. By contrast, some bulges emerge on surface of the other two films and they grow larger for the one obtained with 1.2 M CsCl/H2O, which is probably ascribed to that more 0 D perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 species are formed near some CsPbBr2−xCl1+x grain boundaries and hinder the coarsening of some grains but cause the abnormal growth of others.22,40,42 The XRD results in Fig. 2(d) consolidate that all the films are composed of 0 D perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 and 3D perovskite CsPbBr2−xCl1+x. And, both the XRD peaks of Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 and CsPbBr2−xCl1+x components are more higher for Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films prepared with 1.0 M CsCl/H2O, revealing their better crystallinity. The UV-Vis absorption spectra in Fig. 2(e) show that there is successive absorption onset blue-shift for Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films with increasing CsCl/H2O concentration from 0.7 M to 1.2 M. The bandgaps were estimated to be 2.64, 2.69, and 2.73 eV for Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x samples prepared with 0.7, 1.0 and 1.2 M. The narrowed bandgap can be ascribed to the halide exchange between Br− in Cs4Pb(BrCl)6/CsPbBr2−xCl1+x with Cl− in CsCl, wherein the more Cl− in the Cs4Pb(BrCl)6/CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film is accompanied by the larger bandgap because of the smaller ionic radius of Cl− than Br−.29,43 In spite of the varied bandgaps, all the Cs4Pb(BrCl)6/CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films are suitable for UV-vis PDs.

Furthermore, Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films prepared with 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M CsCl/H2O were used to fabricate PDs to study their photoelectric conversion properties, wherein the carbon-electrode device configuration with the layer stacking of FTO/TiO2/Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x/carbon was adopted. Once the incident light was absorbed by the Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film, photo-induced electrons and holes were generated. After that, the photo-induced electrons injected into the TiO2 layer and were further collected by FTO, while photo-induced holes were generated by the carbon electrode, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). In this way, light signals can be transformed into electrical signals to realize the self-powered photodetection functionality.29,44 On the other hand, such a device configuration is free of organic hole HTMs and metal electrodes that would affect the thermal stability of PDs because the degradation of the organic HTM and the ionization of the metal electrode would be accelerated at high temperatures. Therefore, better thermal stability is expected for the PDs.

Fig. 3(b) shows the dark current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of self-powered PDs fabricated with Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films by using 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M CsCl/H2O. They show the asymmetrical dark current character under positive and negative bias, with the typical rectifying behavior of a diode, which indicates the formation of built-in-fields in as-fabricated PDs and thus endow their availability for self-powered photodetection.25,29,31 Furthermore, their dark current densities under 0 V bias were measured. As seen from Fig. 3(c), all the dark current densities are stable during the test period of 1000 s, revealing the excellent ambient stability of the as-studied self-powered PDs based on Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films. Meanwhile, the CsCl/H2O concentration has a significant impact on the dark current densities, which are estimated to be 5.51 × 10−10, 3.13 × 10−10, and 5.99 × 10−9 A cm−2 for the ones built with Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films formed with 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M CsCl/H2O, respectively. Light J–V curves of the as-studied PDs measured under simulated AM 1.5G illumination are given in Fig. 3(d). The curves are similar to those of photovoltaic cells, indicating the fact that the as-studied PDs regain the self-powered photodetection ability.45 The photovoltages are determined to be 1.59, 1.55, and 1.56 V for self-powered PDs based on Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films prepared with 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M CsCl/H2O, respectively, while the short-circuit current densities are estimated to be 4.04, 3.72, and 2.05 mA cm−2, respectively. The increased photocurrent with the decreased CsCl/H2O concentration reveals the enhanced photoelectric conversion capacity of the PDs, as a result of the enhanced photoelectrical properties of Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of as-studied PDs are shown in Fig. 3(d). All the PDs show the clear photoresponse without any bias voltage, verifying their self-powered functionality again. The photocurrent onset wavelengths are fitted to be 467, 470, and 480 nm for self-powered PDs fabricated with 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M CsCl/H2O, all of which agree with the absorption characters of the corresponding Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films. As with the short-circuit current densities, the self-powered PD fabricated with a larger concentration of CsCl/H2O solution yields lower EQEs. Based on the EQE results, the responsivity (R) curves of the as-concerned PDs can be obtained, as given in Fig. 3(f). The R peaks are determined to be 0.18, 0.16, and 0.13 A W−1 for the self-powered PDs fabricated with 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M CsCl/H2O. Furthermore, the specific detectivity (D*) spectra of as-fabricated PDs are derived from the dark current and R results. As seen from Fig. 3(g), the self-powered PD fabricated with 1.0 M CsCl/H2O yields the best D* values, and its D* peak can reach as high as 1.65 × 1013 Jones, beyond most of the self-powered perovskite PDs reported previously, as presented in Table S1 (ESI†). These results can be ascribed to the fact that the self-powered PD prepared with 1.0 M CsCl/H2O yields the lowest dark current in spite of its moderate R values. The response speed of the best-performing self-powered PD is investigated using a transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement system, with the result shown in Fig. 3(h). The decay time was fitted to be 1.23 μs, which is comparable with the results reported earlier.1,4,7 Note that our PD has a relatively larger active area of 0.09 cm2, which is accompanied by a higher parasitic capacitance and thus slows down the response of the PD. As the active area of PD is reduced, the faster response speed can be expected.25 In addition, the photodetection ability of the self-powered PD fabricated with 1.0 M CsCl/H2O was demonstrated by measuring its response to a 405 nm on/off modulated laser. As seen from Fig. 3(i), the periodic response signals can be measured by the PD, indicating that it can function as the self-powered device for light signal detection.
Finally, the optoelectronic characteristics of the typical self-powered PD prepared with 1.0 M CsCl/H2O were studied under various working temperatures from 25 to 350 °C to demonstrate its high-temperature performance. Fig. 4(a) shows the corresponding dark J–V curves. As seen, the dark current densities increase slowly with the increase in the working temperature from 25 to 300 °C and enlarge suddenly as the working temperature reaches up to 350 °C. Such a common phenomenon could mainly originate from the hot-electron effect.11,46 To be specific, with increasing working temperature from 25 to 300 °C, the growing thermally-excited electrons could improve the conductivity of Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film, resulting in enlarged dark current densities. On further increasing the working temperature to 350 °C, the work function of Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x and the barrier height between it and electrodes can be substantially reduced, leading to a significant decrease of the contact resistance and thus suddenly increased dark current densities. Even so, the above results disclose that as-fabricated PD has an excellent thermal tolerance at various high temperatures below 300 °C, evidencing that it has the capacity to be serviced under harsh environments. Noting that the working capacity of as-studied PD against high-temperature harsh conditions is superior to those of commercial SiC PDs and other traditional PDs,11,15,16 which are generally serviced below 150 °C or only at room temperature (RT). Fig. 4(b) shows the dark J–V plots recorded under 0 V bias voltage. Under different working temperatures, the dark current densities are quite stable during the whole test period. The dark current values are estimated to be 4.61 × 10−10, 1.18 × 10−9, 1.97 × 10−9, 3.88 × 10−9, 3.55 × 10−9, 3.14 × 10−9, 4.71 × 10−9, and 5.21 × 10−8 A, when the working temperatures are 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 °C, respectively. Similarly, one can see that the PD can endure the working temperature up to 300 °C. Fig. 4(c) shows the light J–V curves measured under simulated AM 1.5G illumination and varied working temperatures. Both the short-circuit current densities and open-circuit voltages improve with the increased working temperatures from 25 °C to 300 °C, while the short-circuit current enlarges suddenly and the open-circuit voltage decreases significantly as long as the working temperature reaches 350 °C. The on/off ratios of the PD working on different temperatures are presented in Fig. 4(d), from which the values are estimated to be 1.14 × 106, 4.51 × 105, 3.06 × 105, 1.58 × 105, 1.67 × 105, 1.91 × 105, 1.29 × 105, and 1.51 × 104, when the working temperatures are 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 °C, respectively. In addition, the high-temperature, long-term working stability of the PD was evaluated at 300 °C under the illumination of an on/off modulated blue LED (1 W, 5 V bias voltage). As observed from Fig. 4(d), both the dark and light current densities are quite stable during the whole test period of 300 min, showing its excellent operation stability under a high-temperature atmosphere. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the PD without any encapsulation can retain over 92% of its initial photocurrent value after being placed in ambient air for about one month, further disclosing its promising storage stability. Overall, all the above results make sense that a self-powered PD based on the optimized Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film is highly promising for high-temperature applications.

(f) Long-term response to an on/off modulated blue LED (1 W, 5 V bias voltage) recorded at 300 °C for the same PD. 
To understand the excellent high-temperature tolerance of the self-powered PD based on the 0D–3D Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film, temperature-dependent XRD tests were performed on the pure CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film and the typical Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film. The clear XRD peaks at 15.23°, 21.63°, and 30.93° can be detected from the CsPbBr2−xCl1+x sample at RT, which are in line with those of cubic phase perovskite. With the increased test temperature from RT to 100 °C, its main XRD peaks shift to smaller diffraction angles, as result of expanding lattices.47 When the temperature reaches up to 150 °C, another diffraction peak emerges at 30.69°, beside the shifted peak positions. With a further increase in temperature, the emerged XRD peak becomes more and more strong, confirming that the crystal structure of the CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film transforms into a tetragonal structure.48,49 In terms of the XRD pattern of the Cs4Pb(BrCl)6/CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film at room temperature, the clear peaks at ∼20.00°, 22.99°, and 31.59° can be assigned to the (104), (300), and (223) planes of Cs4Pb(BrCl)6, while the XRD peaks at ∼15.00°, 22.04°, and 30.45° can be attributed to (100), (110), and (200) of cubic phase perovskite CsPbBr2−xCl1+x. Moreover, the cubic to tetragonal phase transition is absent for the CsPb(BrCl)6/CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film under elevated temperatures, as high as 350 °C. These results make clear that the Cs4Pb(BrCl)6/CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film possesses much higher phase transition temperature than the pure CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film, which endows the better high-temperature tolerance of resulting self-powered PD. The inhibited high-temperature phase transition of the Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film can be mainly ascribed to as-formed 0 D perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 species near CsPbBr2−xCl1+x grain boundaries, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c). The lattice expansion of 0D perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 hinders the lattice distortion and grain deformation of 3D perovskite CsPbBr2−xCl1+x under high temperature, thus slowing down the 3D perovskite phase transformation.50

3. Conclusions
0D–3D mixed-dimensional perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films were obtained by the use of a water-based two-step spin-coating method, modified by the CsCl additive strategy for the PbBr2 precursor film. The dose of the CsCl additive and the concentration of CsCl/H2O solution play significant roles in 0D–3D Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film growth. By optimizing these factors, the 0D–3D Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films with full coverage, large-sized grains, and high crystallinity are obtained, which can further enable the carbon-electrode, self-powered PDs with simple configuration and outstanding performance. In particular, the best-performing one yields a superior R peak of 0.18 A W−1, a high D* of 1.65 × 1013 Jones, and a fast response time of 1.23 μs. More importantly, it is found that 0D perovskite Cs4Pb(BrCl)6 can withhold the cubic to tetragonal phase transition of 3D perovskite CsPbBr2−xCl1+x and thus make the PD work effectively at ∼300 °C. Under such a high working temperature, the self-powered, carbon-electrode exhibits a dark current density of 6.34 × 10−8 A cm−2, an on/off ratio of over 1.44 × 105, and a stable working duration of ∼300 min. Our work suggests that CsPbBr2−xCl1+x films modified by dimension engineering can be good candidates for high-temperature PDs and thus opens up a new direction to explore more materials for high-temperature PDs.
4. Experimental section
Materials
All of the chemicals and reagents were used without further purification, including ultra-dry PbBr2 (≥99.998%, Alfa-Aesar), ultra-dry CsCl (≥99.5%, Alfa-Aesar), anhydrous DMF (≥99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), anhydrous DMSO (≥99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), conductive carbon paste (Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd), and FTO glass (8 Ω sq−1, Pilkington TEC Glass).
Preparation of the FTO/TiO2 substrate
The FTO glass sheet was orderly cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol for 20 min, and dried by N2. After being treated with UV-ozone for 20 min, the TiO2 layer was deposited by spin-coating of 100 μL TiO2 sol onto the FTO glass sheet and further annealing at 500 °C in ambient air for 60 min.
Preparation of the Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film
First, the PbBr2 precursor with the CsCl additive was prepared by dissolving PbBr2 and CsCl (molar ratio = 1:0.00, 1:0.05, 1:0.10, or1:0.15) into DMF and DMSO mixed solvents (4:1 V/V) with stirring at 80 °C for 30 min. Then, 80 μL of the as-obtained PbBr2 precursor was spin-coated onto the FTO/TiO2 substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal treatment at 90 °C for 30 min. Next,110 μL of CsCl/H2O solution with varied concentrations of 0.7, 1 or 1.2 M was spin-coated onto the PbBr2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, each of the samples was annealed at 250 °C for 5 min.
Fabrication of carbon-electrode self-powered PDs
The carbon back-electrode with a constant active area of 0.065 cm2 was coated onto the as-prepared Cs4Pb(BrCl)6–CsPbBr2−xCl1+x film by screen-printing conductive carbon paste at room temperature. After thermal treatment at 120 °C for 15 min, the target PD was obtained.
Characterization
Temperature-dependent and room-temperature XRD patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffraction system with an X-ray tube with Cu Kα radiation and equipped with a high temperature sample table. Absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis/NIR spectrophotometer (U-4100, Hitachi). The SEM images were acquired using a field-emission SEM (JEOL-7100F). J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2636 source meter. EQE spectra were recorded using a Zolix DSR-101-UV system equipped with a Si PD as a reference. The R curves of the PDs can be obtained using the following formula: , where λ is the wavelength, h is the Planck constant, c is the light speed, and e is the elementary charge. D* spectra can be calculated using the following equation: , where A is the device working area, e is the elementary charge and Id is the measured minimum dark current. The TPC curve was recorded using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, MSO5204B) with an input resistance of 50 Ω, where the device was illuminated with a 405 nm pulse laser (MDL-NS-405). All the measurements of PD performance were conducted under an ambient air atmosphere with a RH of 40–50% and a temperature of ∼25 °C.
