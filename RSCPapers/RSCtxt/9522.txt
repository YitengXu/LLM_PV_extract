    , Accepted 20th December 2019First published on 20th December 2019AbstractElectrode materials exhibiting nanostructural design, high surface area, tunable pore size, and efficient ion diffusion/transportation are essential for achieving improved electrochemical performance. In this study, we successfully prepared cobalt phosphide and cobalt nanoparticles embedded into nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon (CoP–CoNC/CC) using a simple precipitation method followed by pyrolysis–phosphatization. Subsequently, we employed CoP–CoNC/CC as the electrode for supercapacitor applications. Notably, the resultant CoP–CoNC/CC displayed a high surface area with tunable porosity. Based on the benefits of the CoP in CoNC/CC, improved electrochemical performance was achieved with a specific capacitance of 975 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 in a 2 M KOH electrolyte. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor using CoP–CoNC/CC (positive electrode) and activated carbon (AC) (negative electrode) exhibited a specific capacitance of 144 F g−1, a specific energy of 39.2 W h kg−1 at 1960 W kg−1 specific power, with better cyclic stability. The higher performance can be attributed to the synergetic effect between CoP, Co metal, and the nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon in three-dimensional carbon cloth (CC). These excellent properties make CoP–CoNC/CC a promising electrode for developing future energy-storage devices.
Introduction
Recently, environmental deterioration and energy shortage have attracted considerable attention for the identification of clean and renewable energy sources. Among various electrochemical energy technologies, supercapacitors (SC) with a superior power density (up to 105 kW kg−1), an extremely long cycle lifetime, and fast charge/discharge rates have attracted significant research attention from both industry and the academy.1–3 These merits are extensively used to argue for the replacement of conventional rechargeable batteries for practical applications, including portable electronic devices, back-up power systems, hybrid electric vehicles, and storage. But, the power density of the supercapacitors is somewhat poor when related to those of the batteries and fuel cells. Therefore, it is critical to find an appropriate electrode material to improve the corresponding electrochemical performance. To date, several electrodes, such as carbon materials, metal hydrides, metal oxides, conductive polymers, metal selenides, metal nitrides, and metal phosphides, have been studied for developing supercapacitors.4–11 Among these, metal phosphides have gathered considerable attention because of their superior redox activity, high chemical stability, and particularly high electrical conductivity.12,13
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently attracted significant attention owing to their easy synthesis, structural morphology, tunable pore size, unusually huge specific surface area, and metal ion-rich centers, which provide ample space for electrochemical reactions.14–20 Recent literature has revealed that MOFs have been extensively considered for energy and environmental applications such as batteries, solar cells, supercapacitors, and water splitting.21–29 However, the poor electrical conductivity and large steric hindrance effects minimize their applicability in electrochemical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a new strategy for enhancing the MOF electrochemical performance. Generally, MOFs formed through intermolecular bonding or coordination bonding between the metal ions or clusters, with organic linkers providing exclusive 2D or 3D structural frameworks. MOF formed through various organic linkers, which offer different structural morphologies as well as electrochemical properties. Among various MOFs, the imidazole-based frameworks offer good metal ion coordination with the imidazole ligands, and its rich nitrogen, carbon, and metal ions provide good electrolyte ion diffusion pathways and improve the conductivity.30–34 Among the reported MOFs with various metal ions, cobalt-based MOFs possess good dualistic reversible redox pairs and extremely high stability in highly concentrated alkaline electrolyte media.
Recently, metal phosphide-based electrodes have shown excellent electrical conductivity and promise as energetic materials for energy storage applications. Among those electrode materials, CoP has been studied in various research fields such as electrocatalytic energy, electronics, photonics, etc.35–37 These widespread applications are due to submetallic alloy properties that arise from the combined properties of metalloid phosphides and metallic cobalt. It is the cobalt whose intrinsic higher conductivity promotes boosted the electro-kinetic rates, over-whelming the oxides. Cobalt phosphides offer rapid electron transfer kinetics among electrode and electrolyte interface, generating better power density in SCs and enhanced electrocatalytic performance for electrocatalysts. Additionally, in alkaline electrolyte media, sulfide-based electrodes tend to decompose, gradually but profoundly losing their initial capacity. Hence, the active reaction kinetics and robust strength of cobalt phosphides show promise for use in electrochemical and electrocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the direct growth of these MOF nanostructures on the substrate without using binder or additives can assure improved electrical conductivity as well as mechanical strength. Among various substrates, carbon cloth (CC) is an economy and easily accessible texture with good electrical conductivity, robust corrosion resistance, excellent flexibility, and particularly high mechanical strength.38–41
Herein, we report the synthesis of polyhedral Co-MOF anchored onto CC by a simple precipitation method to yield Co-MOF/CC. Further pyrolysis of Co-MOF/CC resulted in Co metal nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-containing nanoporous carbon (CoNC/CC). Electrochemical activity and electrical conductivity were further improved by partially converting Co metal into cobalt phosphide with a low percentage of phosphate precursor by pyrolysis and phosphatization under argon atmosphere resulting in CoP- and Co metal-embedded nanoporous carbon (CoP–CoNC/CC). Supercapacitance performances of prepared Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC electrode materials were investigated by bi- and tri-electrode configurations. The experimental results illustrated that CoP–CoNC/CC maintains extremely high specific and areal capacitance in 2 M KOH electrolyte, outstanding rate capability, also long cycling retention capability. Also, assembled hybrid SCs (CoP–CoNC/CC//AC) demonstrated very high volumetric capacity, stability, and energy density.
Experimental section
Synthesis of Co-MOF/CC
Co-MOF was prepared according to a reported protocol.42 Specifically, 6.55 g of 2-methylimidazole (organic linker) was slowly added into 100 ml methanol and stirred well to obtain a homogeneous solution (Solution A). Pre-cleaned, dried CC was immersed into solution A. In another beaker, 2.9 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O was slowly added into 100 ml methanol under vigorous stirring until to obtain a homogeneous solution (Solution B). The obtained a homogeneous solution B was injected into solution A under vigorous stirring. And then, the final solution was kept undisturbed for 24 h at 25 °C. Finally, the CC with purple deposits was carefully collected, washed many times in ethanol solution, and dried under vacuum conditions at 80 °C to obtain pure Co-MOF/CC. The mass loading of Co-MOF on CC was 0.7 mg cm−2.
Preparation of CoNC/CC
CoNC/CC was obtained by high-temperature carbonization using a programmable furnace under Ar atmosphere. Per the typical method, 3 × 3 cm2 Co-MOF/CC was carbonized up to 800 °C with a constant ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 and maintained for 3 h in Ar atmosphere to attain CoNC/CC. The mass loading of CoNC on CC was 0.58 mg cm−2.
Preparation of CoP–CoNC/CC
To prepare CoP–CoNC/CC samples, 3 × 3 cm2 CoNC/CC and a low weight percentage of 10 mg sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (NaH2PO2·H2O) were kept at distinct positions in a ceramic boat, with the phosphate precursor located in upstream Ar purging. In this manner, the precursors were heated up to 300 °C with a contant ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 and maintained for 1 h to obtain CoP–CoNC/CC. The mass loading of CoP–CoNC on CC was 0.6 mg cm−2. The obtained samples were further subjected to physical and electrochemical analysis.
Material characterization
The chemical structure and surface morphological properties of the prepared Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC electrodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Rigaku Ultima), Raman spectroscopy (LabRam ARIMIS IR2), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ULVAC-PHI), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEOL; JEM-2010) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS-mapping) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Quanta 25FEG). N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were carried out by Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area analyzer.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical analysis of the Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC electrodes were taken using bi- and tri-electrode configurations in aqueous electrolyte (ZIVE SP5). For tri-electrode configuration; working electrode (as-prepared Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC (1 × 1 cm2)), reference electrode (Hg/HgO) and counter electrode (platinum wire). In the frequency range of 106 Hz to 0.01 Hz, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The two-electrode measurements were employed for a hybrid device configuration (CoP–CoNC/CC//AC).
Results and discussion
The crystallinity of the prepared Co-MOF, CoNC, and CoP–CoNC electrodes, investigated by XRD measurements, are revealed in Fig. 1. The XRD analysis of Co-MOF pattern is well correlated with previous literature, indicating the formation of pure Co-MOF.43–47 After pyrolysis at 800 °C under Ar atmosphere, a broad peak appeared around 25–32° due to the formation of amorphous carbon. In CoNC, the two diffraction peaks at around 44.20° and 51.50° correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of metallic cobalt (JCPDS# 15-0806), respectively.48,49 Also, the diffraction peaks appearing at 31.60°, 36.40°, 46.30°, 48.20°, 52.10°, 56.02°, and 56.70° (JCPDS# 29-0497) for CoP–CoNC/CC refer to the (011), (111), (112), (211), (103), (020), and (301) planes of CoP, respectively.49–52 The presence of both the CoP and Co metallic phases after phosphorization confirms that both the metallic cobalt and CoP are wrapped into the carbon matrix in CoP–CoNC.

The surface morphologies of the prepared Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC samples obtained from FESEM are demonstrated in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2(a and b), the FESEM image of Co-MOF/CC depicts polyhedron-shaped Co-MOF with a size between ∼0.4–0.9 μm are well grown on the surface of CC. The firm attachment of Co-MOF onto CC is due to the presence of sufficient nucleation sites present on the CC substrate, which acts as a 3-dimensional, highly porous current collector, facilitating the growth of nanomaterials as competently as other substrates such as Ni-foam. Upon carbonization under the Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h, Co-MOF polyhedra anchored on CC were transformed to metallic cobalt embedded in nanoporous carbon. Nevertheless, the separate polyhedra could still be identified even after carbonization (Fig. 2(c and d)). Moreover, CoNC was strongly attached to carbon fiber after carbonization.

This strong attachment promotes conductivity between CC and porous polyhedral carbon-containing cobalt, thereby enhancing contact among electrolyte ions and electrode and also lowering the diffusion pathways of electrolyte ions. The small porous cavities present on the polyhedral porous structure of CoNC/CC provides open space for shielding strains while the charge–discharge cycle as well as promotes the diffusion/transportation of ions into the interior of the active material. Besides, the strong attachment and 2-D like structure on CC provide more electroactive sites with easy access to the electrolyte ions than other nanodimensional structures. Fig. 2(e and f) shows that the CoNC/CC maintains integrity even after phosphorization. The morphology of the prepared CoP–CoNC/CC was further characterized by HR-TEM analysis.

Fig. 3(a–c) demonstrates that CoP and Co nanoparticles were well encapsulated by a few layers of nitrogen-doped carbon shells derived from the carbonized imidazole ligands. The nitrogen-doped carbon shells with an inter-planar spacing of 0.34 nm played a significant role in fixing the Co and CoP nanoparticles and thereby improved the stability during the electrochemical reaction process. The lattice spacings of 0.20 and 0.34 nm are well consistent with the planes of Co nanoparticles (111) and graphitic carbon (002) (Fig. 3(d)). The 0.28 nm lattice spacing is consistent with the (011) CoP plane (Fig. 3(e)).44,45,53–55Fig. 4(a–h) illustrates the EDS mapping and percentage of elements in prepared polyhedral CoP–CoNC/CC.

The cobalt element in the polyhedral unit tends to agglomerate to form large particles, resulting in enhanced crystallization of both cobalt and carbon and improved intensities in the selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) (Fig. 3(f)). The elemental analysis report clearly describes the presence of Co, C, N, O, and P in prepared CoP–CoNC/CC (Fig. 4(a–h)). This result indicates that C, N, and O derived from carbonized imidazolium ligand were distributed throughout the polyhedral structure. The small percentage of phosphorous in the polyhedral unit indicates that only a small percentage of cobalt was converted to form the CoP nanoparticles that directly enhance electrical conductivity during the electrochemical process, thereby improving overall energy storage performance. The degree of carbon graphitization of the carbonized samples is explored by Raman spectra. Fig. 5 shows the Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and Co–P–CoNC/CC Raman spectra. Peaks at 1345 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 are well consistent with the D (disordered structure) and G (graphitic structure) bands of carbon materials, respectively. The degree of graphitization and defects present in carbon materials are usually estimated from the intensity ratio of D band to G band (ID/IG). ID/IG ratios of the as-prepared Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC were found to be 1.15, 1.19, and 1.39, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Raman spectra of the as-prepared Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC. 
The higher ID/IG ratio of the CoP–CoNC/CC resulted from the higher number of defects originated by CoP insertion and nitrogen doping during graphitization.46,47 Moreover, it is well-known that the increase in defects favours the reaction kinetics and electroactivity of carbon-based materials in energy conversion and storage devices.
To determine the oxidation state of each element, XPS analysis was carried out, and the results are presented in Fig. 6. In the spectrum of the CoP–CoNC/CC sample, peaks for C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, Co 2p, and P 2p are observed (Fig. 6(a)). The deconvoluted spectrum of C 1s (Fig. 6(b)) shows three peaks situated at the binding energies of 284.5 eV, 285.1 eV, and 286.3 eV, which are assigned to the CC, C–N, and C–O bonds, respectively, suggesting the graphitic nature of carbon.52,56 The N 1s spectrum (Fig. 6(c)) is deconvolved into three peaks located at 398.4, 399.4, and 400.9 eV that are assigned to the pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N, respectively. The heterogeneous nitrogen atom doped into the electrocatalyst provides numerous advantages to boosting electrochemical reactions: (a) the heterogeneous N atom provides p-electrons into the π-conjugated sp2 carbon system, thus effectively boosting electronic conductivity; (b) pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N create some defects in the carbon system, which facilitate mass transport.56,57 The deconvoluted spectrum of O 1s is presented in Fig. 6(d). The typical peaks located at the binding energies of 531.2 eV, 532.2 eV, and 533.9.7 eV are assigned to CO/–C–O–C–, –O–CO, and –N–O–, respectively.58 This result confirms that the carbonized imidazolium-based organic linker is effectively connected to the Co in the MOF structure. Fig. 6(e and f) shows the deconvoluted spectrum of Co 2p, and the P 2p peaks of CoP–CoNC/CC. In the XPS deconvoluted spectrum of Co 2p (Fig. 6(e)), the peaks at 778.6 eV and 781.7 eV correspond to cobalt 2p3/2, whereas the peaks at 793.6 eV and 797.9 eV are related to cobalt 2p1/2, with two satellite broad signals appearing at 786.0 eV and 803.6 eV. The peaks at 778.6 eV (2p3/2) and 793.6 eV (2p1/2) correspond to the metal-bonded cobalt present in the cobalt phosphide, although the peaks at 781.7 eV (2p3/2) and 798.0 eV (2p1/2) are consistent with the covalently bonded cobalt. Also, the P 2p deconvoluted spectrum shows three main peaks (Fig. 6(f)). The double peaks at 130.1 and 129.6 are consistent with 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively, along with a single strong peak around 133.7 eV ascribed to the oxidized P species and well-matched with earlier reports elsewhere.49,57,59,60 Therefore, the XPS studies confirm the successful preparation of CoP–CoNC/CC.

The electrochemical performances of the prepared electrodes are directly associated with the surface area and porosity of the samples. Samples with a greater surface area could provide more active sites that enhance electrochemical performances during electrochemical reactions. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the prepared materials to evaluate their surface area. In Fig. 7(a and b), the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm curve is a type-IV adsorption isotherm with obvious hysteresis loops, indicating the presence of mesopores in CoNC and CoP–CoNC. The specific surface area and average pore diameter of the prepared CoNC and CoP–CoNC were 230 m2 g−1, 242 m2 g−1 and 5 nm, 5 nm, respectively, clearly demonstrating the porous nature of the electrocatalysts. The relatively higher surface area along with the presence of pores in CoNC and CoP–CoNC could enhance the electrochemical activity and charge storage in SC applications.

Electrochemical performance of electrodes
To study the supercapacitor applications for Co-MOF/CC, Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) analysis was made in a tri-electrode cell configuration. Fig. 8(a) depicts comparative CV curves for Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC in the potential window range between 0.0 to 0.6 V (vs. Hg/HgO), at a fixed scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in 2 M KOH. All three samples showed over the wider potential window a well-defined couple of redox pairs.

(d) CV and (e) GCD analysis for CoP–CoNC/CC electrode at various scan rate and current density, respectively. (f) The specific and areal capacitance of CoP–CoNC/CC electrode as a function of current density. 
This result might be due to Co2+/Co3+ conversion changes through the electrochemical process. The redox reaction mechanism can be understood by the following reversible processes in alkaline electrolyte medium.61,62 CoP + 2OH− ↔ CoP(OH−)2 + 2e−(1) Co + 2OH− ↔ Co(OH)2 + 2e−(2) Co(OH)2 + OH− ↔ CoOOH + H2O + e−(3) CoOOH + OH− ↔ CoO2 + H2O + e−(4)
The CoP–CoNC/CC electrode can be noted to have a much greater confined region and stronger redox peaks than Co-MOF/CC or CoNC/CC electrodes, indicating its higher supercapacitor performance and enhanced electrochemical activity. The outstanding activity of CoP–CoNC can be attributed to the uniformly distributed CoP on Co metal-embedded nanoporous carbon.
Furthermore, the effective involvement of CoP in intercalation/de-intercalation of OH− ions produced additional active sites. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC at a fixed current density of 2 mA cm−2 over the potential window of 0.0 to 0.6 V (vs. Hg/HgO) are shown in Fig. 8(b). The CoP–CoNC/CC exhibits a much longer discharge time than the Co-MOF/CC and CoNC/CC electrodes. These results indicate that CoP-inserted CoNC/CC possesses more electrochemically active sites, noticeably increasing its energy storage capacity.
Nyquist plots of the Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, CoP–CoNC/CC electrodes are displayed in Fig. 8(c). The solution resistance (Rs) value of the electrode/electrolyte interface is acquired in the high-frequency region from the intercepts on the real axis. The Rs value of the CoP–CoNC/CC electrode (2.10 Ω) is relatively inferior to that of the Co-MOF/CC (2.28 Ω) and CoNC/CC (2.15 Ω) electrodes.
Values suggest that the prepared CoP–CoNC/CC electrode has reasonable conductivity with remarkable electrolyte ion transport between the interface of electrode/electrolyte. The EIS results are well consistent with the CV & GCD measurements.
The CV curves for the CoP–CoNC/CC electrode measured at distinct scanning rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 8(d). A couple of redox peaks are noted at all scanning rates in the 0.0 to 0.6 V potential window for the CoP–CoNC/CC electrode. This pattern might be ascribed to the strong redox reactions between electrolyte ions and Co species. The scan rate was gradually increased from 5 mV s−1 to 100 mV s−1, the reduction peaks slightly shifted to lower potential region meanwhile the oxidation peak shifted to a higher potential. This shifting is due to the insufficiency of charge–discharge processes at the electrode/electrolyte interface at higher scan rates, as reported elsewhere.

Fig. 8(e) demonstrates the GCD curves of the CoP–CoNC/CC electrode within 0.0 to 0.6 V potential range (vs. Hg/HgO) at different current densities ranging from 1 to 10 mA cm−2. From Fig. 8(e), it can be seen that CoP–CoNC/CC exhibits nonlinear charge–discharge behaviour. This behaviour is attributed to the pseudocapacitance of the electrode that arises from the redox reaction of Co(II)/Co(III). The CoP–CoNC/CC electrode demonstrates high specific capacitance of 388, 444, 566, 711, 861, and 975 F g−1 at current densities of 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1 mA cm−2, respectively.
In particular, owing to the limited interaction between electrolyte ion and active material over a limited timeframe at higher current densities, the specific capacitance decreases with an increase in current density (Fig. 8(f)). For the CoP–CoNC/CC electrode, a maximum specific capacitance of 975 F g−1 was attained at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. This specific capacitance of the prepared CoP–CoNC/CC is compared with those previously reported MOF-based SC electrodes (Table 1).

This behaviour is due to a synergetic effect between CoP, CoNC nanoporous carbon, and the two-dimensional structure of CC as explained below. The distinctive combination of cobalt species and carbon-based linker in polyhedral structure strongly anchored on the CC surface allows electrolyte ions to easily interact with the active species and contribute to the more positive side of the oxygen evolution potential. Nitrogen doping in a porous polyhedral carbon structure offers additional active sites that are promising to improve the faradaic capacity of the electrode. The above properties associated with the high electrical conductivity of CoP contribute to the overall improvement of supercapacitance performance.
Electrochemical performance of hybrid supercapacitor
The P-doped CoP–CoNC/CC electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance; therefore, to investigate its feasibility for practical applications, an aqueous hybrid SC (CoP–CoNC/CC//AC) was assembled. Fig. 9(a) displays the schematic diagram of the CoP–CoNC/CC//AC device. Fig. 9(b) displays the CV curves for the CoP–CoNC and AC electrodes at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, which are well consistent with earlier reports.73 The mass ratio of the positive (CoP–CoNC/CC) and negative (AC) electrodes was balanced in 1:0.92 ratio. Analysis of the CV and GCD performance of the prepared device (CoP–CoNC/CC//AC) was measured to know its electrochemical behaviour at different voltage windows at a fixed scan rate of 100 mV s−1 as displayed in Fig. 9(c) and (d). The CV curve of the hybrid supercapacitor exhibits a large quasi-rectangular area between 0 and 1.4 V, demonstrating that the assembled hybrid SC steadily worked up to the voltage of 1.4 V. Fig. 9(e) depicts CV curves for the hybrid SC measured at different scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1 in a fixed voltage window of 0 to 1.4 V. The CV curves exhibit quasi-rectangular shapes with steady increases in cathodic and anodic currents with increasing scan rate without alteration, indicating good rate capability. Meanwhile, a pair of redox peaks noticed in each CV curve indicate the co-existence of pseudocapacity along with double-layer capacitance.

Remarkably, the couple of redox peaks is detected even at higher scan rates, confirming that the prepared CoP–CoNC/CC//AC hybrid SC has strong electrochemical reversibility performances and fast kinetics of electron transport. GCD measurements for CoP–CoNC/CC//AC hybrid SC were performed at different current densities ranging from 4 to 20 mA cm−2, as demonstrated in Fig. 9(f). The GCD curve shows non-symmetric behavior which is due to the battery-like faradaic reaction of the positive electrode materials used in hybrid SC.74 Also, the low coulombic efficiency of hybrid SC might be due to the electrochemical polarization of the electrodes in the set voltage window.75 The specific capacitance as a function of the current density of the prepared SC is demonstrated in Fig. 9(g). SC exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 144 F g−1 at 4 mA cm−2. The maximum retained capacitance of up to 79% of initial capacitance was observed while increasing the current density from 4 to 20 mA cm−1, indicating good rate capability. For practical evaluation of supercapacitor applications, specific energy and specific power represent additional key factors. The specific energy and power calculated from the discharging plot are plotted in a Ragone plot in Fig. 9(h). The Ragone plot shows that with increasing specific power, specific energy gradually decreases. The CoP–CoNC/CC//AC shown maximum specific energy of 39.2 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 1960 W kg−1. Moreover, at a high current density of 20 mA cm−1, the hybrid SC maintained specific energy of 30 W h kg−1 with a high specific power of 9800 W kg−1. Table 2 compares the CoP–CoNC/CC//AC hybrid SC obtained values with recently studied other MOF-based SC devices. The long-term stability performance for the CoP–CoNC/CC//AC hybrid SC was further evaluated by cyclic stability measurement for 5000 cycles. The CoP–CoNC/CC//AC hybrid SC retained 86.58% even after 5000 cycles from its initial capacitance (Fig. 9(i)), indicating superior cyclic stability. Moreover, before and after cycling of EIS measurements of the CoP–CoNC/CC//AC hybrid SC were studied, as represented in Fig. 9(j). Nyquist plots of the fabricated device before and after cycling nearly coincide, with no significant variation observed. The solution resistance (Rs) values of the CoP–CoNC/CC//AC hybrid SC before and after cycling were 2.84 and 3.00 Ω cm−2, respectively. The very small or negligible variation of Rs after 5000 cycles indicates the superior capacitive performance of the CoP–CoNC/CC//AC hybrid SC. Thus, the CoP–CoNC prepared in this work acts as a propitious electrode material prepared via precipitation followed by the pyrolysis-phosphorization method on CC, with a unique polyhedral morphology. The electroactivity and electrolytic properties of the studied material can be ascribed to the following scientific reason. The prepared CoP–CoNC is enriched with two types of cobalt atoms, each differently bonded. One is a covalently bonded cobalt atom, storing energy by Faraday's reactions offering higher capacitance value. Meanwhile, metallic cobalt offering free electrons which improve electrical conductivity as well as rate capability.12 Furthermore, the presence of nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbon also boosts electrical conductivity, enhancing the rate of the electron transfer kinetics throughout the electrochemical reactions.76 Also, the acquired morphology enhances the accessibility to electrolytes and boosts the frequency of significant ions on the electrode surface. The unique polyhedral morphology of the prepared CoP–CoNC performs well in both electrochemical and electrocatalytic performance.

Conclusion
We prepared Co-MOF/CC via a simple precipitation technique and converted it to a CoP–CoNC/CC composite electrode by the pyrolysis–phosphorization method. Structural and morphological properties were verified by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FESEM, HR-TEM, and XPS analysis. The prepared Co-MOF/CC, CoNC/CC, and CoP–CoNC/CC electrodes were directly employed as binder-free supercapacitor electrodes. CoP–CoNC/CC exhibited the maximum specific capacitance of 975 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 compared to other electrodes prepared in this study. Furthermore, assembled hybrid exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 144 F g−1 at a current density of 4 mA cm−2, with a high energy density of 39.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1960 W kg−1 and good cyclic stability, with a capacity retention of 86.5% even after 5000 cycles. The overall finding reveals that the binder-free CoP–CoNC/CC electrode reported could offer a new pathway to next-generation energy conversion and storage technology.
