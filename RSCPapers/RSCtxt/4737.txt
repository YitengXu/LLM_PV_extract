    , Accepted 24th July 2021First published on 27th July 2021AbstractInterest in deep-sea hydrothermal research has been rapidly increasing. Advances in harvesting energy from hydrothermal vents will facilitate long-term seafloor observation systems that do not rely on batteries. A thermoelectric generator can continuously convert hydrothermal heat into electrical energy, but the extreme environment of the deep sea makes heat dissipation a challenge. To address this issue, we developed the hydrothermal fluid ejector, which is a novel cooling structure with no moving parts that can change the cold-side heat transfer from natural convection to forced convection. By combining a thermoelectric generator with the ejector structure, we can utilize the kinetic energy of a vent flow instead of a pump-driven cooling system to drive cold water. This cooling method is highly reliable and requires no auxiliary power. An experiment was conducted with a scaled model and particle image velocimetry to validate the water driving capability of the ejector, and a laboratory experiment was conducted to validate the cooling method. The experimental data were consistent with simulation results using computational fluid dynamics. The experimental results indicated that the ejector could improve the thermoelectric generator output power by 19.5–32.5%. Thus, the proposed structure can facilitate practical and maintenance-free cooling for deep-sea thermoelectric generator systems.
1. Introduction
Deep-sea observation, especially over the long term, requires a steady supply of electricity. Hydrothermal vents are a hotspot for deep-sea exploration and can potentially serve as a reliable source of energy. The temperature of the vent flow can be over 473 K, and the temperature of ambient water can be as low as 277 K.1–3 Thus, a natural temperature difference field forms around hydrothermal vents and is an ideal energy source for thermoelectric devices.4–6 Many approaches can be used to generate electricity from hydrothermal vents, such as the organic Rankine cycle (ORC), environmental fuel cell and thermoelectric generator. The ORC generator comprises four major parts: the heat exchanger, turbine, pump and generator. Hiriart et al. proposed a submarine ORC generator that utilises the vent flow as the heat source and cold seawater as the coolant.7 Yamamoto et al. designed and constructed a deep-sea hydrothermal fluid-seawater (HF-SW) fuel cell that was able to generate an output power of more than 21 mW.8 Xie et al. utilised the thermal gradient between the vent fluid and ambient seawater to develop two prototypes of thermoelectric generators, both of which realised a watt-level power output.9–11
The thermoelectric module uses the Seebeck effect to realise thermoelectric conversion directly, which makes it portable and convenient to deploy. The thermoelectric generator has an output power ranging from microwatts to kilowatts with no complicated system.12–14 From vehicle exhaust to solar energy, thermoelectric modules have been used for thermoelectric conversion.15,16 Because of their high reliability and minimal maintenance, thermoelectrics have great potential for the application in power supply for long-term deep-sea observation. Means for improving the output power of the thermoelectric module include (i) the structural optimisation of thermoelectric modules and (ii) the improvement of the heat transfer capability of both the hot and cold sides of thermoelectric modules (TEMs).Many studies have been reported on the optimization of the TEM. For example, Kishore et al. used the Taguchi method to optimise the geometric parameters of the cross-sectional area and height of p–n legs of a 30 × 30 mm2 TEM, thereby increasing the efficiency by 1.46% at a fixed ambient temperature.17 For the recycling of fluid waste heat, Luo et al. optimised the cross-section of the thermoelectric semiconductor according to the specific temperature difference, thus ensuring that all semiconductors generated the same current, thereby decreasing current losses.18
When the TEMs for a thermoelectric generator have been fabricated or selected, heat transfer enhancement is a dominant factor for increasing the output power. The output power of a thermoelectric module is sensitive to the temperature difference between its hot and cold sides. A thermoelectric module is generally 3–10 mm thick, thus making it difficult to sustain a large temperature difference between the sides under natural convective cooling.19 To enhance the hot-side heat transfer, Bass et al. used swirl fins to increase the gas turbulence in a vehicle waste gas heat recycle test, achieving a maximum output of 1086 W.14 For the cold side of the TEM, possible cooling methods can be divided into passive and active cooling. For passive cooling, heat transfer can be enhanced by adding a heat sink and optimizing the geometry. Lineykin et al. used a heat sink to enhance the TEM's cold-side heat transfer, demonstrating that for the given heat sink, the maximum output power can be achieved by effectively combining the electric load with the thermoelectricity module.20 Reducing the thermal resistance of the cold side can also boost heat transfer efficiency. Wojtas et al. applied a microfluidic heat transfer system to reduce the thermal contact resistance of a thermoelectric generator to enhance its performance.21 For active cooling, a fan or water pump is usually used for the cooling system which needs extra power. The auxiliary consumption of active cooling may decrease the net output in some cases. Catalan compared the fin dissipation by a fan (active cooling) with loop thermosiphons (passive cooling). Experimental results show that the net output is 37.5% higher under loop thermosiphon cooling than under fan cooling because the auxiliary consumption of fans decreased the net output.22 Gu et al. investigated the influence of water velocity on the net output, finding that the net power decreased as the consumption of the pump increased when cooling at water velocities exceeding 0.045 m s−1.23 Aljaghtham et al. simulated conversion of heat into electricity, considering both heat conduction and air cooling. They obtained maximum thermoelectric power by optimizing oil pan geometries and driving conditions.15 All these researches indicated that the cooling method has significant influence on the thermoelectric generator's net output.
The extreme conditions of hydrothermal vents mean that conventional cooling systems are inadequate for meeting the needs of thermoelectric generators on the seafloor. In addition, the cooling system requires additional power to operate while a passive cooling method lacks auxiliary consumption. In this study, we considered the possibility of utilizing the vent flow to drive ambient seawater for cooling without the need for additional electricity consumption or auxiliary moving parts. We developed a novel cooling structure for thermoelectric generators that we call the hydrothermal fluid ejector, which utilizes the kinetic energy of the vent flow instead of a pump to drive cold water. The ejector changes the cool-side heat transfer of the thermoelectric generator from natural to forced convection, enhancing the heat dissipation of the cold side. Furthermore, the ejector has a reliable and straightforward structure, making it a potentially attractive choice as a cooling system for thermoelectric generators on the seafloor.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Hydrothermal power generator and the proposed ejector
A thermoelectric module is obtained by connecting thermoelectric conjunctions, and a thermoelectric generator consists of TEMs and a sealing structure. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of thermoelectric conjunction in a thermoelectric module. Heating the hot side of the conjunction forms a temperature difference at the sides. According to the Seebeck effect, a voltage difference is produced between the sides.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of a thermoelectric junction. 

Fig. 2 shows a hydrothermal power generator, which is a thermoelectric generator operating in a deep-sea environment. The TEMs are encapsulated in a titanium cavity, and the heat sink is on the cold side of a thermoelectric module. By mounting the hydrothermal power generator on the hydrothermal vent, the high-temperature fluid flows through the inner hole, which heats the hot side of the thermoelectric module. At the same time, the cold side is cooled by steady-state ambient seawater through the heat sink, which establishes a temperature difference that can be used to output power. Increasing the temperature difference is a direct way to improve the output power. He et al. used forced water as the cooling system of a thermoelectric generator.24 Luan et al. constructed a deep-sea power generator system with natural convection cooling.25 When the hot side is at a relatively steady temperature, enhancing the heat dissipation of the cold side is essential for increasing the output power. Fig. 2(a) shows a hydrothermal power generator with natural convection cooling, and Fig. 2(b) shows an image of the proposed ejector. The structure mainly consists of a nozzle and chamber. The fluid from the hydrothermal vent is accelerated as it flows through the nozzle, forming a low-pressure zone at the nozzle outlet. Thus, ambient seawater is driven into the throat to act as a cooling flow for the hydrothermal power generator.
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of a hydrothermal power generator installed over a hydrothermal vent on the seafloor: (a) natural convection cooling; (b) forced convection cooling through the hydrothermal fluid ejector; (c) cross-section view of the thermoelectric power generation module. 
Because forced convection has greater heat transfer efficiency than natural convection, it is a practical approach in improving the output power. The thermoelectric generator consists of 18 modules. HZ-2-type TEMs (Hi-Z Company, San Diego) were used in this study. These TEMs are made from commercially available Bi–Te material. The TEM is sealed in the titanium cavity with heat-resistant epoxy resin, and the heat sink is mounted on the cold side of the TEM, as shown in Fig. 2(c).
2.2 Hydrothermal fluid ejector model
Ejectors are used in heat-driven refrigeration systems as a promising alternative to traditional compressor-based systems.26–28 An ejector has two inlets and one outlet port. The primary flow represents the high-temperature vent flow. This flow enters through the first inlet and produces a pressure difference, which drives the secondary flow entering from the low-pressure inlet port, the secondary flow being the ambient cold water. The ejector has a relatively simple structure with no moving parts, which gives it high reliability and effective operation.29 By combining the thermoelectric generator and ejector in a horizontal transcritical CO2 direct–expansion cycle, Ghazizade-Ahsaee and Askari boosted the coefficient of performance by 16%.30 The flow velocity of a hydrothermal vent can reach 1–2 m s−1.31 Thus, the kinetic energy of the flow can be used by the ejector to drive ambient cool water. Fig. 3 shows the combined structure of the hydrothermal power generator and ejector. There is a cavity with a nozzle in the middle and the throat outside. The suction chamber is between the throat and nozzle. This study focused on enhancing the heat dissipation on the cold side of the thermoelectric module, and fluid mixing was not considered. The primary flow is the vent fluid flowing through the cavity, and the secondary flow is the ambient seawater flowing through the chamber. Note that the subscripts 0, S, and 3 refer to the primary, secondary, and mixed flows. The momentum equation from Section 1–1 to Section 2–2 is given by (1)where g is the acceleration of gravity, G is the weight flow rate, ν is the velocity, α is the throat contraction angle, P is the pressure, ρ is the density, H is the height, and f is the area.

2.3 Thermodynamic model of heat dissipation in the thermoelectric module
For a hydrothermal power generator, the temperature of the hot flow from the vent is relatively steady. To increase the temperature difference, we focused on analyzing the heat dissipation from the cold side. Fig. 4 shows the heat transfer from the cold side of the thermoelectric module to ambient seawater. For heat convection between a fluid and solid, in natural convection, liquid water heat transfer coefficient varies between 50 and 1000 W m−2 K−1 and in the forced convention between 100 and 20000 W m−2 K−1.32 Thus, the convection state is a critical factor for enhancing the cold-side heat transfer.
 Fig. 4  Scheme of the cold-side heat transfer. 
The heat transfer equation can be derived as follows. First, the heat flux from the hot side of the thermoelectric module to the cold side is given by (6)whereλ1, δ1 and fi are the thermal conductivity, thickness, and contact area of the TEM respectively, Th and Tc1are the temperatures of the hot and cold sides, respectively. The heat flux from the cold side of the TEM to the heat sink is given by (7)where λ2, δ2 and Tc2 are the thermal conductivity, thickness, and temperature of the heat sink, respectively.
The heat flux from the heat sink to ambient water Φ = hoAs(Tc2 − TL) + hoηefl(Tc2 − TL) = hoηofw(Tc2 − TL)(8)where fw = fs + fl, , and ηe is the fin efficiency.
By combining eqn (6)–(8), we can obtain the heat flux from the hot side of the thermoelectric module to the cold water: (9)
The heat convection coefficient is given by (10)where λwis the thermal conductivity of water, L is the length of the heat sink, and Nu is the Nusselt number (Table 1). Eqn (9) shows that the heat flux of the thermoelectric module can be increased by increasing ho. For natural heat convection,ho = 587.1 W m−2 K−1 at Tc2 = 342 K and TL = 299 K.

3. Simulation and experiment
3.1 Simulation method

Fig. 6(a) shows the hydrothermal power generator's computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Eighteen TEMs were sealed in the titanium cavity, and their cold sides were in contact with the aluminium heat sink. A realizable k–ε turbulence model was selected for predicting ejector performance; the model has two inlets and one outlet. The two inlets represent the hot vent flow and the cold ambient water flow, respectively, and the outlet acting as the outflow of the mixed water. The flow in the ejector was steady and axisymmetric, so we used a 1/6 model of the generator for the simulation. The model was immersed in seawater, and the ambient water temperature was set to 300 K. The primary flow was the flow from the hydrothermal vent. The secondary flow was ambient water and was used to enhance the cold-side heat transfer efficiency of the thermoelectric module. To increase simulation precision, we sliced the model into 45 bodies and refined the meshing grid around the TEMs, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Fig. 6(c) shows the numerical results for the hot-side average temperature versus the number of elements. The change in the results between the second (element count: 885809) and fifth cases (element count: 4565291) was 1.6%, the change in the results between the fourth (element count: 2899367) and fifth cases (element count: 4565291) was 0.3%. Therefore, we used a medium-size meshing strategy with a mesh of 2899367 elements. The simulation has been performed using the commercial software ANSYS fluent (V16.2). Tables 2 and 3 show the material properties and boundary conditions used in the CFD model.

3.2 Experimental validation of the ejector model
To validate the velocity distribution of the simulation results, we designed a scaled model and performed an experiment to obtain the velocity distribution of the secondary flow through particle image velocimetry (PIV). Fig. 7 shows the velocity measurement rig, which consisted of the scaled ejector model, water pump, camera (V2512, PHANTOM), and line laser (MGL-F532, CNI). The model was mounted in a transparent water tank, and 50 μm-diameter polyamide resin particles were added to the water as the ambient seawater; the density of the particles is 1.03 g cm−3. An adjustable pump drove the water jet representing the primary flow. The water flow rate was measured using a flowmeter between the outlet of the pump and the inlet of the ejector. Images of the fluid zone were recorded at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. The light sheet was perpendicular to the camera axis and passed through the model axis. Thus, we could obtain the cross-sectional velocity distribution.

3.3 Experimental validation of the increased power generation
A laboratory experiment was conducted to verify the influence of the cooling method on the output power. Two independent circulation loops were connected to the generator for heating and cooling. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the oil heating circuit used an adjustable oil pump, and the cooling water circuit used an adjustable water pump. Thus, the flow rates for both the hot oil and cold water could be controlled independently. The maximum output of the oil pump was 5 m3 h−1, and the maximum output of the water pump was 30 L min−1, which was sufficient to meet our requirements. The generator was fully immersed in a 6 m × 3 m × 1.5 m pool filled with water at 299 K. We used a watertight cable to connect the generator with the measurement instruments. An electrical load (IT8511A+, ITECH) was used to measure the output power of the generator. Thermocouples (5TC-TT-K-30-36, OMEGA) were mounted on the sides of the TEMs to acquire the temperature difference. A temperature measurement system was used to record the temperature data.

We used an equivalent model to conduct the power output experiment. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the out part of the ejector is replaced by a cooling cavity with six cold water inlets, a pump was used to drive the cold water as a secondary flow in the ejector. The heat transfer oil loop and the cooled water are isolated by the thermoelectric generator cavity. By controlling the cold water rate, we can simulate the cold flow according to the optimized results. Table 4 is the specification of the instruments used in the experiment.

4. Results and discussion
4.1 Validation results with particle image velocimetry
We conducted a PIV test to validate the driving capacity of the ejector. During the PIV test, the camera frame rate was set to 2000 fps. Fig. 10(a) shows the experimental results. The centre of the secondary flow had a high velocity, which decreased closer to the model surface. In actual applications, the zone between the inlet and outlet of the nozzle is the cooling zone of the TEMs, so we extracted the velocity distribution here. According to PIV results, when the primary flow velocity was 1.0, 1.3, and 1.56 m s−1, the corresponding secondary flow velocity was 0.051, 0.058, and 0.071 m s−1, respectively. The flow velocity distribution is analysed by the third-party inspection agency BeiYan Inc.; the uncertainty of PIV image processing is 3%. Three groups of simulation tests were conducted with primary flow velocities of 1, 1.3, and 1.6 m s−1. The simulation results were consistent with the PIV results, as shown in Fig. 10(b). The indicated that the hydrothermal vent flow could be utilized to drive the ambient seawater as an alternative to the water pump.

4.2 Simulation results
To validate the power output of the hydrothermal power generator, three tests were conducted with hot oil velocities of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m s−1. First, we start the oil pump and heater; after the temperature and oil flow rate reached a steady state, we started recording the output power and temperature difference. For each oil velocity, there were two test phases. In the first phase, we only started the oil pump. In the second phase, we started the water pump to simulate the cooling effect of the ejector. Table 5 presents the experimental process. By comparing the cooling effects of natural convection and forced convection, we could validate the influence of the ejector on the output power of the generator.

Fig. 11 shows the simulated temperature distribution at a hot oil velocity of 1 m s−1. Forced convection increased the temperature difference of the TEMs by 10 K compared to natural convection. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the ejector effectively enhanced the cold-side heat transfer. Because of the radial spread of the hot oil flow, the central heat sink had the highest cold-side temperature. Fig. 11(a) shows that heat dissipation reduced the surface temperature of the heat sink for natural convection. Fig. 11(b) shows the temperature distribution of the TEMs. The middle TEM had the highest cold-side temperature, and the TEM near the inlet and outlet had relatively low cold-side temperatures. For forced convection, Fig. 11(c) shows that the heat sinks had an apparent temperature gradient following the flow direction of the cold water. Fig. 11(d) shows that the first thermoelectric module had the lowest cold-side temperature. As the cold water was heated, the cold-side temperature increased in the flow direction of the cold water.

Forced convection cooling: temperature distributions of the (c) thermoelectric generator and (d) thermoelectric modules on the hot and cold sides. 

Fig. 12(a) shows the temperature differences between natural convection and forced convection. At a vent flow velocity of 1 m s−1, the temperature differences with natural and forced convection were 114 and 128 K, respectively. At a vent flow velocity of 1.5 m s−1 and hot oil temperature of 478 K, the average hot-side temperature of the middle thermoelectric module was 437.5 K, and the average cold-side temperature was 322.4 K for a temperature difference of 115.6 K with natural convection. With forced convection induced by the ejector, the hot and cold-side temperatures were 440 and 313 K, respectively, for a temperature difference of 127 K. At a vent flow velocity of 2 m s−1, the temperature differences were 116 and 128 K. Thus, the forced convection cooling with the ejector increased the temperature difference by 14, 11.4, and 12 K. Fig. 12(b) shows the influence of the cooling water velocity on the cold-side temperature. At a cooling water velocity of 0.005–0.1 m s−1, the cold-side cooling started changing from natural to forced convection, and the average temperature decreasing rate Δ = ΔT/Δν reached 47 K m−1 s−1. As the cooling velocity increased, the cold-side temperature of the thermoelectric module approached the water temperature, and the heat transfer rate decreased to 8.8 K m−1 s−1 according to the equation Φ = hAΔT. Although the cooling capacity increased with the cooling velocity, effective cooling was still obtained at low velocities. Thus, the ejector can be expected to provide a cooling effect by driving the water flowing from the hydrothermal vent.

4.3 Power experimental result

Fig. 13(a)–(c) shows the experimental results for the output power of the hydrothermal power generator. At a hot oil flow velocity of 1 m s−1, the average output power improved from 4.42 to 5.4 W, and the output power is improved by 22.2%. At a hot oil flow velocity of 1.5 m s−1, the output power improved from 4.52 to 5.4 W for an improvement of 19.5%. At a hot oil flow velocity of 2 m s−1, the maximum output power of 6 W was achieved for an improvement of 32.5%. For a thermoelectric module based on bismuth telluride, the Seebeck coefficient reaches its maximum around 470 K. Thus, the temperature difference and output power can be maximized at this temperature.

4.4 Ejector parameters versus cooling effect
To explore the influence of structural parameters on the secondary flow, we built a parameterized model of the thermoelectric generator in CFD. We optimized the chamber radius, nozzle radius, and chamber length by fixing the primary flow rate to 1 m s−1 and setting the maximum secondary flow rate as the optimization objective. Fig. 14 shows the secondary flow rate and velocity versus the structural parameters. Fig. 14(a) shows the effect of varying the chamber radius Rn within a range of 61–80 mm. The secondary flow reached a maximum flow velocity of 0.058 m s−1 at a chamber radius of 68 mm. As the chamber radius increased, the cold-water flow had a more extensive section area. We obtained a maximum flow rate of 2.9 × 10−4 m3 s−1 at a chamber radius of 72 mm. Increasing the chamber radius reduced the flow friction, increasing the cold-water flow and enhancing the cold side's heat dissipation.
 Fig. 14  Secondary flow rate versus different structural parameters: (a) nozzle radius, Rn, (b) chamber radius, Rc, (c) chamber length Lc and (d) hydrothermal properties. 
The flow rate reached a maximum at 2.5 × 10−4 m3 s−1 and then stabilized. Fig. 14(b) shows that increasing the nozzle radius Rc from 12 to 32 mm decreased the secondary flow rate and velocity. The secondary flow rate changed from 8.7 × 10−4 to 2.7 × 10−5 m3 s−1, which indicates that the nozzle radius is a key design parameter for the ejector. At a steady primary flow rate, a small nozzle radius results in a high primary flow velocity; this produces a more significant pressure difference at the nozzle outlet. Fig. 14(c) shows that increasing the chamber length Lc initially increased the secondary flow rate, which reached its maximum at a chamber length of 240 mm. Increasing the chamber length further made the primary flow unable to build a practical pressure difference for driving the secondary flow. Fig. 14(d) shows the secondary flow rate with different hydrothermal vent flow velocities. At the same vent flow velocity, the secondary flow rate increased with the hydrothermal vent radius. This is because the kinetic energy increases with the primary flow rate. Even a tiny secondary flow velocity can provide effective cooling compared with natural convection. Therefore, this hydrothermal power generator can be used with most hydrothermal vents.
5. Conclusions
We proposed a novel hydrothermal fluid ejector that induced forced convection cooling for hydrothermal power generators on the seafloor. The ejector can be combined with TEMs to realize a self-cooling generator. This cooling structure is maintenance-free because there are no moving parts. Thus, it is suitable for the extreme conditions of the deep-sea environment. In addition, the proposed design does not require an additional power supply because it utilizes the kinetic power of the flow from a hydrothermal vent. The results from laboratory experiments and simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of the ejector, which improved the output power by 19.5–32.5%. The cooling effect improves with the vent flow velocity. Adding the ejector changes the cold-side heat dissipation from natural convection to passive forced convection, which effectively enhances the heat transfer. The above ejector can be combined with highly reliable TEMs to develop a more efficient and environmentally sustainable hydrothermal power generator to serve as a steady electricity supply for long-term observation of sites on the seafloor. Thus, the proposed ejector can potentially serve as a cooling system for extreme deep-sea environments.
