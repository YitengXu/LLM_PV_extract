    , Accepted 18th October 2016First published on 18th October 2016AbstractAcene is a type of important organic semiconductor which has promising applications in various optoelectronic devices. The fission of a singlet to triplet in it has been expected to elevate the quantum efficiency of organic solar cells. However, the quantum efficiency is still very low and the fission process is still under debate. Controversies also exist on the energies of the singlet and triplet states in acene. Using the many-body Green's function theory, which includes the GW method and Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE), we compared the electronic excited states of several kinds of acene molecules (naphthalene to pentacene) at geometries optimized by different approaches. The energies of both the singlet and triplet depend strongly on the geometries of the molecules and their stacking. The non-negligible contribution from the resonant and anti-resonant transition coupling can cause large errors of the Tamm–Dancoff approximation, and the full BSE is required to get accurate results which are consistent with experiments. We found that accurate ionization energies and exciton energies can only be obtained when the geometries optimized by the Hartree–Fock approach are used. Singlet fission may be realized in isolated molecules, clusters, and surfaces, but it is hard in perfect pentacene crystals energetically. We provide a methodology for future research on acene-based solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
1 Introduction
Linear π-conjugated organic semiconductors have garnered considerable research interest for decades because of their potential applications in various electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as organic thin films, field effect transistors, liquid crystal displays, organic light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaic devices, etc.1–4 As active layers in these devices, organic semiconductors have much more favourable features than their inorganic counterparts, for instance, they are much cheaper, more abundant, more flexible, can be used at a lower temperature, and have a lower power consumption.5 Acene, which is composed of linear chains of planar fused benzene rings, is a type of important organic semiconductor. Acene has excellent electronic properties, e.g. large charge carrier mobilities, stable structures, and tunable electronic band gaps.6
Singlet fission is a process of exciton multiplication in organic semiconductors where one singlet exciton could split into two triplet charge carriers.7–9 It may allow photovoltaic devices to circumvent the Schockley–Queisser limit in power conversion efficiency10 and be dramatically more beneficial than conventional solar cells where one photon can only create one electron–hole pair. For a system where the lowest optically allowed singlet excited state has an excitation energy more than twice that of its triplet energy, such as in pentacene and its derivatives, singlet fission can overcome thermalization losses and turn every singlet into two triplets in a sub-100 fs timescale.11,12 The external quantum efficiencies of photovoltaic devices based on pentacene can be above 129%.10,12
Various theoretical methods have been applied to elucidate the mechanism behind the singlet fission process.13–16 However, to do this, a first principles method, which can predict accurately the electronic and excitonic levels for acene molecules in both the gas phase and as a crystalline structure, is needed, since the acene used in photovoltaic devices is in the crystalline form while the experimental data (e.g. the ionization energy, the energy of triplet) for the gas phase are more abundant. Based on this, we can examine reasonably the phenomena like singlet fission, charge transfer excited states, and charge carrier separation at the donor/acceptor interface in solar cells. Advanced quantum chemistry approaches, such as multi-reference Møller–Plesset perturbation theory,13 complete-active space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2), and complete-active space self-consistent field (CASSCF),14 can only treat molecular systems presently. The many-body Green's function theory (MBGFT), typically the combination of the GW method and Bethe–Salpeter equation (GW + BSE),17,18 is a state-of-the-art first principles method to deal with electronic excited states for both molecular and periodic systems. Sharifzadeh et al. calculated the electronic levels and singlet energies for the pentacene molecule and crystal.5 Although their results for the crystal are in good agreement with experiments, the energy gap of the molecule between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) deviates from the experimental value by 0.7 eV. Furthermore, the exciton energies for the molecule are evaluated within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA) which may cause large errors as demonstrated before for organic molecules.19,20 It is quite necessary to re-examine the electronic and excitonic energies of pentacene with the GW + BSE approach to find out where the errors might come from and to set up a scheme for future investigations on the electronic and optical properties of donor/acceptor complexes such as pentacene/C60.
In this work, we investigated the ionization energies (IEs), HOMO–LUMO gap, energies of singlet and triplet excitons for naphthalene (n = 2), anthracene (n = 3), tetracene (n = 4), and pentacene (n = 5) (Fig. 1), the dependence of these quantities on the geometries optimized by different methods, and the effect of resonant–anti-resonant transition coupling on the exciton energies. Our calculations show the importance of going beyond the TDA for both singlet and triplet excitons. We found that the energies based on the Hartree–Fock geometries are the closest to the experimental data. Calculations also indicate that singlet fission is not favourable in the perfect pentacene crystal but can be realized in the molecule from the point of energetics. We hope that this work can provide a benchmark for future investigations on acene and related solar cells.

2 Computational details
2.1 Ground state
Structures of the acene molecules are shown in Fig. 1(a). Their ground state geometries are optimized by the Hartree–Fock (HF) approach, the second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) approach, and density functional theory (DFT) with the exchange–correlation functionals CAM-B3LYP21 and PBE,22 respectively, using the GAUSSIAN09 code23 with the 6-31g(d,p) basis set. Fig. 1(b) displays the unit cell structure of the pentacene single crystal studied in this work which consists of two non-equivalent molecules arranged in the herringbone configuration. This structure has a triclinic crystalline lattice with a = 6.275 Å, b = 7.791 Å, c = 14.556 Å, α = 76.434°, β = 87.585°, and γ = 84.707° according to the experiment.24 The structure of the crystal is optimized within DFT by the SIESTA code25 employing the PBE exchange–correlation functional and the double-ζ plus polarization functions constructed by atomic orbitals as the basis set. A k-point mesh of 3 × 3 × 1 is used for crystal structure optimization.
2.2 GW method
We used the GW method to compute the electronic levels, ionization energies, and band structures via the quasiparticle (QP) equation:26 (1)The GW method has been demonstrated to predict the band gap of crystals, IE, and affinity potential of molecules with a high accuracy.18,27–37 In eqn (1), ∑(r,r′,E) is the non-local, energy-dependent self-energy operator which describes the exchange–correlation interactions among electrons. In the GW method proposed by Hedin,26 ∑(r,r′,E) can be approximated by: (2)where G and W are the one-body Green's function and the screened Coulomb interaction, respectively. The static part of W is calculated within the random phase approximation, while its dynamic part is represented by the plasmon pole model proposed by von der Linden and Horsch.38,39 In this work, GW calculations are performed by the one-shot G0W0 method.18 However, in the calculations of the screened Coulomb interaction and Green's function, a scissor shift is applied to the DFT energies of unoccupied orbitals. The scissor shift is adjusted until it equals the difference between the quasiparticle band gap and the DFT one. The IEs of the acene molecules are determined by the formula: IE = EDFTvacuum − EGWHOMO(3)where EDFTvacuum is the vacuum level.
2.3 Bethe–Salpeter equation
The BSE describes the motion of a coupled electron–hole pair (exciton) through the two-particle Green's function. The full BSE takes the form:18 (4)with R = D + 2KR,x + KR,d and C = 2KC,x + KC,d for singlet-to-singlet excitation, where D ≙ (EQPc − EQPv).40R and −R* are the Hamiltonians corresponding to the resonant (v → c) and the anti-resonant (c → v) transitions, respectively, while C and −C* denote the resonant and anti-resonant transition coupling (RARC). KR,x(KR,d) and KC,x(KC,d) are the bare exchange term (screened direct term) of the electron–hole interaction kernel for the resonant transition and the corresponding coupling terms, respectively. EQPc and EQPv are the quasiparticle energies for the unoccupied (conduction) and occupied (valence) orbitals calculated by the GW method, respectively. Ω is the excitation energy. Within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation, C is assumed to be zero; this is a good approximation for cases where the coupling terms are much smaller than the resonant and anti-resonant terms. For singlet-to-triplet excitations, terms R and C in eqn (4) become R = D + KR,d and C = KC,d, respectively, with the bare exchange contributions removed. The exciton wave function is expressed as: (5)
Our calculations are carried out by a Gaussian orbital-based code.39–42 The starting DFT eigen wave functions are represented by orbitals of s, p, and d symmetry, while operators in the GW and BSE are represented by orbitals of s, p, d, and f symmetry. Decay constants of the Gaussian orbitals were optimized with the density fitting approach. They were adjusted until the orbital energies calculated by the Gaussian orbital basis set reproduce (within 0.1 eV) those obtained by a well-converged plane-wave basis set and they have also been well tested to give converged excitation energies. The decay constants have been applied in previous GW + BSE calculations on organic systems, e.g. sexithiophene, DNA, RNA, and biological chromophores.20,42–45 All the unoccupied orbitals are included in the construction of the self-energy operator and dielectric functions which are needed for the computation of the screened Coulomb interaction.
For comparison we also evaluated IEs and excitation energies of acene molecules by other approaches, for example, IEs by the ΔSCF method46 with the PBE and B3LYP functionals and the outer valence Green's function (OVGF) theory,47 and excitation energies by the TDDFT method with the PBE and B3LYP functionals. These calculations are conducted by the GAUSSIAN09 code with the 6-311++g(d,p) basis set.
3 Results
3.1 Acene molecules
The difference in the ground state structures optimized by various theoretical approaches for the acene molecules is manifested in Fig. 2. For all the four acene molecules from n = 2 to n = 5, the average C–C bond length follows the trend HF > CAM-B3LYP > MP2 > PBE. The average bond length in HF is 0.01–0.02 Å longer than that in PBE. However, the excitation energy difference between the HF and PBE geometries is huge. Tables 1 and 2 list the calculated IEs and HOMO–LUMO gaps of the acene molecules by the GW method at different geometries, respectively. For all the acene molecules, the IEs at the HF geometries are the closest to the experimental data.48 For example, IE (n = 5, HF) is smaller than the experimental value by 0.21 eV, while IE (n = 2, HF) deviates from the experiment by just 0.04 eV. The gap between IE (n = 5, PBE) and the experiment can be as large as 0.39 eV. The gap between IE (n = 2, PBE) and the experiment is the smallest (0.17 eV) for the four acene molecules at the PBE geometries. This trend is also manifested in other first principles methods. As shown in Table 1, the IEs at the HF geometries are closest to the experimental values for the OVGF theory and the ΔSCF method at the levels of PBE and B3LYP. At the HF geometries the GW method is the closest to the experiments compared to the other approaches.

Rangel et al. evaluate the IEs of acene molecules with G0W0 at the PBE and B3LYP geometries.32,36 Our results agree with theirs within 0.2 eV. As to the HOMO–LUMO gap, the difference between our GW calculations and the experiments is about 0.1 eV for tetracene and pentacene (Table 2). The difference is relatively larger for naphthalene (∼0.4 eV) and anthracene (∼0.2 eV).

Fig. 3 compiles the energies of the lowest singlet and triplet excitons for acene molecules at different geometries and different theoretical levels. The most interesting and surprising point is that the TDA underestimates the energies for both the singlet and triplet of all the acene molecules by 0.2–0.4 eV except for the singlet state of naphthalene when compared to the full BSE. This point has not been taken into account in the previous BSE-TDA investigation on the excited states of the pentacene molecule by Sharifzadeh et al.5 In their work, Sharifzadeh et al. predict the energy of the lowest singlet excited state (ES1) in the pentacene molecule to be 2.2 eV, which seems to be in good agreement with the experimental value (2.3 eV). However, according to our calculations, the TDA causes 0.3 eV error in ES1 for the pentacene molecule. Considering this effect, ES1 of the pentacene molecule is closest to the experiment at the HF geometry. The errors at the CAM-B3LYP, MP2, and PBE geometries are 0.33, 0.51, and 0.48 eV, respectively. For the energy of the lowest triplet state (ET1) in the pentacene molecule, at the level of the full BSE, the difference (0.05 eV) between the energy at the HF geometry and the experiment is also the smallest, while the energies at the CAM-B3LYP, MP2, and PBE geometries deviate from the experiment by 0.29, 0.51, and 0.46 eV, respectively.49–53 The energies of the triplet states at the HF geometry are also consistent with other high-level quantum chemistry methods. For example, our energy gap between the lowest two triplet states (1.20 eV) is nearly the same as that from the CASPT2/CASSCF method (1.24 eV).13 For the anthracene and tetracene molecules, the agreement in ES1 and ET1 between the HF geometry and the experiment is even better than that for the pentacene molecule. For the naphthalene molecule, it seems that the HF geometry provides the worst ES1 while the PBE geometry gives the best. However, for ET1 within the full BSE, the energy at the HF geometry is comparable to that at the CAM-B3LYP geometry and is still the best option, while the energy at the PBE geometry is the worst. This contradiction can be attributed to the uncertainty in the assignment of the absorption peak to the lowest singlet excited state (S1) since the experimental absorption spectrum of the naphthalene molecule is very broad and extremely weak and is also composed of many closely-spaced peaks in this energy region. In fact, for the highest absorption peak (Sh) of the naphthalene molecule whose corresponding experimental one54 is sharp, its energy at the HF geometry agrees with the experimental value within 0.1 eV as shown in Fig. 4. The HF geometry is also the most favourable for the energy of Sh of the pentacene molecule.55 One should note that the difference in the energy of the singlet excited state for the naphthalene molecule at the HF, CAM-B3LYP, MP2, and PBE geometries is small compared to that of the other acene molecules (Fig. 3 and 4), although the structure difference between HF and PBE is the largest for the naphthalene molecule (Fig. 2). Although the TDA is accurate enough for S1 of the naphthalene molecule, it leads to a 0.6 eV error in Sh of the naphthalene molecule (Fig. 4). This indicates the importance of going beyond the TDA for the excited state calculations on the acene molecules. This phenomenon has already been observed in other organic molecules like thiophene, DNA and RNA nucleobases, chromophores, etc.27

The solid horizontal lines indicate the experimental results.54,55 
The different effect of the TDA on S1 of the naphthalene molecule from that on its lowest triplet state (T1), on its Sh, and on S1 and T1 of the other acene molecules is due to the special composition of its S1. T1 of naphthalene, and S1 and T1 of the other acene molecules are all composed of the HOMO → LUMO transition, but the second lowest singlet excited state (S2) of the naphthalene molecule originates from the HOMO → LUMO transition, while the wave functions of S1 and Sh of the naphthalene molecule are  and , respectively. The TDA does underestimate the energy of the S2 of naphthalene by 0.24 eV, similar to the other excitations as mentioned above with a HOMO → LUMO character. The error in the TDA results from the non-negligible contribution from the RARC, i.e. the off-diagonal terms C in eqn (4). This is due to both the strong bare exchange interaction (Kx) and the strong screened direct interaction (Kd) between the electron and hole in the excited state, for example, for the pentacene molecule, the matrix elements KC,xH,L;H,L = 0.9 eV, KC,dH,L;H,L = −0.3 eV between the HOMO(H) → LUMO(L) transitions. Thus the matrix elements for the RARC are CH,L;H,L = 1.5 eV for the S1 state and CH,L;H,L = −0.3 eV for the T1 state. The matrix elements for the resonant transition are RH,L;H,L = 3.1 eV for the S1 state and RH,L;H,L = 1.4 eV for the T1 state. The magnitude of the RARC is thus comparable to that of the resonant transition.
For the naphthalene molecule, not only are the diagonal matrix elements of the bare exchange interaction huge, e.g. KC,xH,L+1;H,L+1 = 1.0 eV and KC,xH−1,L;H−1,L = 1.0 eV, but the off-diagonal ones are also huge, e.g. KC,xH,L+1;H−1,L = 0.9 eV. Since the components |HOMO → LUMO+1〉 and |HOMO−1 → LUMO〉 for the S1 state of the naphthalene molecule are in anti-phase, the total effect of RARC for the S1 state is much small and the TDA is enough for S1. The components |HOMO → LUMO+1〉 and |HOMO−1 → LUMO〉 for the Sh state of the naphthalene molecule are in phase so that the effect of RARC for it is very pronounced (0.58 eV), which amounts to twice that of the S1 state of the other acene molecules.
TDDFT gives the same trend as our full BSE (Table 3). For acene molecules with n = 3–5 the lowest excitation energies from TDDFT are lower than the experimental data just like for the full BSE. TDDFT energies at the HF geometries are higher, and also closer to the experiments, than those at the CAM-B3LYP, MP2, and PBE geometries. It seems that both the IEs and excitation energies from various approaches, including ΔSCF, OVGF, TDDFT, and our GW + BSE, demonstrate that HF is the most appropriate strategy to optimize the geometries of acene molecules.

Our energies of the S1 and T1 states calculated by the GW + BSE-TDA at the PBE geometries compare well with the corresponding work by Rangel et al.36 Their energies of S1(T1) for naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, and pentacene are 4.0(2.8), 3.4(1.8), 2.7(1.1), and 2.2(0.7) eV, respectively, while ours are 4.14(2.7), 3.39(1.76), 2.60(1.1), and 2.06(0.65) eV. However, as discussed above, full BSE calculations beyond the TDA are required to give a reasonable prediction.
3.2 Pentacene crystal
Here we use DFT-PBE to optimize the coordinates of atoms in the unit cell of the pentacene crystal but fix the lattice constants to the experimental values. We show that structures based on PBE can give a band structure and optical absorption spectrum consistent with experiment. Fig. 5 shows the band structures in the PBE and GW. Pentacene crystal is a direct gap semiconductor. The valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) locate at the R point, not at the Γ point. The band gap at the R(Γ) point is 0.7 eV (0.8 eV) in the PBE and 2.0 eV (2.2 eV) in GW. The GW band gap agrees with previous GW calculation56 and the experiment57 (2.2 eV). The spacing between bands a and b is increased by ∼9% and that between bands c and d increases by ∼18%. Because the two molecules in the unit cell are non-equivalent, the electronic bands are in pairs but not of two-fold degeneracy. This could induce Davydov splitting.
 Fig. 5  Band structures of the pentacene crystal calculated by the DFT and GW methods. Energies are referenced to the VBM. a, b, c, and d denote CBM + 2, CBM + 1, VBM − 1, and VBM − 2, respectively. 
To describe the excited states, we used a k-point mesh of 8 × 8 × 4 to get the converged excitation energies with error smaller than 0.05 eV. Fig. 6 shows the optical absorption spectra with the electric field of the incident light polarized along the x, y, and z directions denoted in Fig. 1. Electron–hole interaction influences the shape and the position of the spectra. With the electron–hole interaction taken into account, the spectra red-shift by 0.3 eV. The exciton binding energy is at the level of a few hundred meV with the largest (0.5 eV) for the lowest several singlet excited states. The optical gap, which is set to the energy of the lowest singlet excited state, is at 1.6 eV, agreeing with previous BSE investigations.5,36,56,58 The lowest absorption peak is at 1.7 eV which is in accordance with the experiments (1.8 eV).59–61 The energy of the lowest triplet state is 1.2 eV which is 0.4 eV higher than the BSE value from Tiago et al.56 The binding energy of the lowest triplet state is 1.1 eV which is consistent with the BSE results from Cudazzo et al.58 From Fig. 7, only the lowest two triplet excitons are of the Frenkel type with each exciton localized on one of the non-equivalent molecules in the unit cell. Starting from the third lowest triplet state whose energy is 1.6 eV, the triplets become charge transfer states with the exciton binding energy smaller than 0.5 eV.

The spectra are calculated with the e–h interaction (red solid line) or without e–h interaction (dark solid line) with an artificial Gaussian broadening of 0.02 eV. 
 Fig. 7  Electronic charge distribution (red solid surface) for (a) the lowest triplet exciton and (b) the third lowest triplet exciton in the pentacene crystal. The hole is fixed on a benzene ring as represented by the yellow balls. The blue and grey balls represent C and H atoms, respectively. It is a Frenkel exciton in (a) and a charge transfer exciton in (b). 
The BSE calculation for the crystal here is carried out within the TDA. In the crystal, the electronic orbitals are delocalized over the two molecules in the unit cell. The electronic screening effect is also more pronounced in the crystal than the molecule (the dielectric constant of the pentacene crystal is calculated to be 3.1). So the bare exchange interaction and the screened direct interaction in the crystal are much weaker than those in the molecule where the electronic orbitals are highly localized and the interactions between the electron and hole are strong. The RARC effect is negligible and the TDA is accurate enough for the crystal. This can be deduced indirectly from the accurate prediction of both the band gap and energy of the lowest singlet state by the GW and BSE-TDA from the calculations by us, Sharifzadeh et al.,5 and Rangel et al.36
4 Discussion
For the pentacene molecule, ES1 > 2ET1 for all the geometries we have studied including HF, CAM-B3LYP, MP2, and PBE. Especially for the MP2 and PBE geometries, ES1 is more than four times ET1. The ratio between ES1 and ET1 is very sensitive to the structure of the molecule. For the pentacene crystal, it has been generally considered that ES1 > 2ET1. From our calculations, ES1 − 2ET1 = −0.8 eV, so it seems that the singlet fission condition is not fulfilled. In the literature, theoretical results for the gas phase molecule are often used to interpret the experimental observations on pentacene crystal and film, especially for the triplet states, which may give misleading conclusions. The pentacene crystal and film samples prepared in experiments usually contain defects and disorder. These defects, disorder, surface of the sample, and interface between pentacene and acceptors in solar cells can provide some sites where ES1 > 2ET1 is possible locally and singlet fission could proceed. This may explain why singlet fission could happen in pentacene crystal and film but the efficiency is not high. It will be interesting to investigate the influence of imperfection on the excited states of acene crystal and film. Modification of the acene molecule and changing their packing pattern may help to improve the efficiency of singlet fission.
5 Conclusions
Using the GW method and Bethe–Salpeter equation, we systematically studied the electronic structures, singlet and triplet excited states, and optical absorption of acene molecules and crystal. We found that calculations based on the Hartree–Fock-optimized ground state geometry can predict an accurate ionization energy, and energies of the singlet and triplet state for acene molecules with n = 2–5 benzene rings. We also found large errors of the Tamm–Dancoff approximation in the energies of both the singlet and triplet excitons for the acene molecules. This provides a methodology for future research on related molecules and the solar cells composed by them. The energy of the lowest singlet excited state of the pentacene crystal is smaller than twice that of the lowest triplet state, which means that it is impossible for singlet fission to occur in perfect crystal. Imperfections like defects, disorder, and surface may facilitate singlet fission.
