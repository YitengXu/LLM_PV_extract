Introduction
Visible-light-induced water splitting has received considerable attention in terms of solar energy conversion and hydrogen energy storage.1 In particular, the construction of well-organized nanostructures consisting of organic photosensitizers is of interest from the viewpoint of improving photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity.2 Jiang and co-workers reported that a poly(phenyleneethynylene) conjugated backbone wrapped with a poly(benzyl ether) dendrimer framework bearing charged exterior surfaces showed amazingly high activity, i.e., the quantum yield for the hydrogen evolution reaches 0.26 upon irradiation with a light of wavelength 410–430 nm.3 We described the fabrication and efficient photoinduced electron transfer processes of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)/anthryl dendron4,5 and SWCNT/fullerodendron4,6 supramolecular nanocomposites, coaxial nanowire structures of which provide a photofunctional interface between the SWCNT-core and the dendron-shell. Since recent studies indicated that the coaxial nanowire structures could improve carrier collection and overall efficiency with respect to bulk semiconductors of the same materials,7 we have explored the photosensitized hydrogen evolution using our coaxial supramolecular systems possessing the SWCNT-core. We found that SWCNT/fullerodendron and SWCNT/fullerodendron/SiO2 coaxial nanohybrids can be used as effective photosensitizers, which show high quantum yields, 0.28 and 0.31, respectively, for catalytic hydrogen generation from water under visible light irradiation (450 nm).8 These photosensitizing systems contain three components, which are the photosensitizer, electron relay (methyl viologen), and co-catalyst (colloidal platinum) (Fig. 1a). Upon photoirradiation, intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer from the photosensitizer to the co-catalyst via methyl viologen takes place producing hydrogen. In view of achieving compact and practical artificial photosynthetic devices, construction of a simpler photocatalytic system by skipping the electron relay is required. However, in the absence of an electron relay molecule, the efficiency of the water splitting reaction falls off markedly because of a decline in electron transport activity from the photosensitizer to the co-catalyst. In this context, several attempts to construct a photosensitizer/co-catalyst interconnecting molecule (Fig. 1b), which has a covalent bond between the photosensitizer and the co-catalyst, have been made.9 For instance, Sakai reported that the Ru(bpy)32+ derivative (photosensitizer) was covalently connected to a Pt(II) complex (co-catalyst). The quantum yield of this dinuclear complex for the H2 production was estimated to be 0.01,10 although that of an ordinal three-component system consisting of Ru(bpy)32+, methyl viologen, and Pt(II) complex was 0.02.11 The reason why hydrogen evolution by employing the photosensitizer/co-catalyst interconnecting molecule is not so efficient is because the connection between a photosensitizer and a co-catalyst might accelerate not only electron transfer from the photosensitizer to the co-catalyst but also charge recombination. Hence, inhibition of the charge recombination process is key to constructing an efficient photosensitizer/co-catalyst interconnecting molecular system. Although there are some reports on efficient photocatalysts that employ CNTs as an electron channel to reduce the recombination rate of charge carriers,12 a photosensitizer/co-catalyst interconnecting system having coaxial nanowire structure containing SWCNTs as the core has never been described. These backgrounds prompted us to investigate the introduction of Pt(II) complexes into the shell moieties of the coaxial photosensitizer, SWCNT/fullerodendron supramolecular system, since efficient charge migration and inhibition of the charge recombination might be expected as a result of construction of the coaxial nanowire structure. Here we describe the fabrication of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) supramolecular systems that can be used for photosensitized hydrogen evolution without any aid of electron relay such as methyl viologen.

Experimental section
Materials and methods
TEM measurements for the composites were conducted using a Jeol JEM-200EXII electron microscope (200 kV). The specimens for the measurements were prepared by applying a few drops of the sample solution onto a holey carbon-coated copper grid (Ouken-Shoji, 200-Abmesh), and then evaporating the solvent. The absorption data were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3150 spectrophotometer using a standard cell with a path length of 10 mm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation was carried out using a Seiko SPA 400-DFM and the samples for the observations were prepared by placing a drop of SWCNT aqueous solution on freshly cleaved mica, then allowing them to dry with a dryer. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were performed on the Pt LIII-absorption edge (11563 eV) using a hand-made liquid holder with windows of Kapton film at the National Laboratory for High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK-PF AR; BL-NW10A). We used IFEFFIT code13 with the FEFF6 procedure14 for the analysis of XAFS spectra. FT-IR spectra were recorded using Shimadzu IR Affinity-1. SWCNTs (HiPco) were purchased from Unidym Co. and used after purification. All other reagents were purchased from Kanto Kagaku Co., Ltd, Aldrich Chemical Co., and Tokyo Kasei Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used as received. Fullerodendron was prepared according to the reported procedure.15
Purification of SWCNTs
SWCNTs were purified according to the reported procedure.16 SWCNTs (100.0 mg) were heated by microwave irradiation for 4 h at 300 °C to remove amorphous carbon. The resulting solid was sonicated in concentrated HCl (5 mL) at 17–25 °C for 10 min to remove iron impurities. The resultant suspension was filtered using a membrane filter (pore size 0.45 μm), and the filtrate was washed with deionized water. After freeze-drying for 4 h, pure SWCNTs (2.7 mg) were obtained. The purified SWCNTs were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S6, ESI†). Furthermore, we confirmed the complete disappearance of metal nanoparticles on the SWCNTs by means of TEM.
Synthesis of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) coaxial nanowires
SWCNTs (HiPco: 1.0 mg) were placed in a water solution (10 mL) of the fullerodendron (25.5 mg, 0.01 mmol) and then sonicated with a bath-type ultrasonifier (ULTRASONIC CLEANER vs-D100, 110 W, 24 kHz) at 17–25 °C for 1 h. After the suspension was centrifuged at 3000 g for 30 min, a black-colored supernatant dispersion, which included excess fullerodendrons and SWCNT/fullerodendron supramolecular nanocomposites, was collected. The SWCNT/fullerodendron nanocomposite was purified by dialysis for 2 days using dialysis tubing (SPECTRUM RC MEMBRANES Pro 4) to remove excess fullerodendrons. The dialysis process was continued until the dialysate showed no absorption change at 258 nm in UV-vis spectra. Then 5.0 mL of the stock solution of SWCNT/fullerodendron nanocomposites (SWCNTs; 0.5 mg, fullerodendron; 12.8 mg) was diluted with 95.0 mL of deionized water to obtain a solution of the SWCNT/fullerodendron nanocomposite (SWCNTs; 2.5 × 10−2 mg, fullerodendron; 6.4 × 10−1 mg, in deionized water 100 mL), which was used for the following experiment. To the aqueous solution of SWCNT/fullerodendron nanocomposites was added potassium tetrachloroplatinate(II) (1.7 mg, 4.1 μmol) in deionized water (0.38 mL) and stirred at 50 °C for 12 h.
Hydrogen evolution from water using SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) coaxial nanowires
Typically, an aqueous Tris-HCl buffer solution (3.5 mL, pH 7.5, 5 mM) of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) nanohybrids (5.0 mL) and BNAH (38.6 mg, 1.8 × 10−4 mol, 1.20 mM) in the presence or absence methyl viologen dichloride (MV2+, 92.4 mg, 3.6 × 10−4 mol, 2.40 mM), in a Pyrex reactor, was degassed for five cycles and purged with Ar. Upon vigorous stirring, the solution was irradiated with a 300 W Xenon arc light (Ushio model UXL-500 W) through the band-pass filter (450 ± 5 nm: ASAHI SPECTRA CO, M. C. 450/10 nm 50 × 50). After a designated period of time, the cell containing the reaction mixture was connected to a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, TCD, molecular sieve 5A: 2.0 m × 3.0 mm, Ar carrier gas) to measure the amount of H2 above the solution. The apparent quantum yield (ΦH2) is defined as follows. ΦH2 = number of H2 generated × 2/number of photons absorbed, which was evaluated from a change in power of the transmitted light, measured using a power meter (Photo-Radiometer Model HD 2302.0 coupled with the irradiance measurement probe LP 471 RAD having an exposure window diameter of 1.6 cm) placed behind the cell parallel to the irradiation cell face.
Results and discussion
SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) coaxial nanowires were fabricated by complexation between K2PtCl4 and SWCNT/fullerodendron supramolecular nanohybrids prepared according to the literature (Fig. 2).17 Purified SWCNTs were used because contaminating metal catalysts in purchased HiPco need to be removed in this experiment. In a typical run, to a solution of the SWCNT/fullerodendron nanocomposite (SWCNTs; 2.5 × 10−2 mg, fullerodendron; 6.4 × 10−1 mg) in deionized water (100 mL), which was prepared according to our previous report, was added K2PtCl4 (1.7 mg, 4.1 μmol) in deionized water (0.38 mL) and stirred at 50 °C for 12 h. It is notable that aggregation of SWCNTs is observed upon adding not less than 3.7 mg (8.9 mmol) of K2PtCl4 into the solution of the SWCNT/fullerodendron nanocomposite.

Complex formation between SWCNT/fullerodendron and platinum(II) can be monitored by the time course of UV-vis spectral changes during the reaction (Fig. 3). The absorbance at 260 nm increases gradually up to 3 h because of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) from the tertiary amine of the dendron moiety to Pt2+ (Fig. 3a). Subsequently, the absorbance at 260 nm decreases gradually with the proceeded ligand exchange reaction from Cl− to COO− of the dendron (Fig. 3b). Complexation of K2PtCl4 to the poly(amidoamine) dendrimer exhibited similar spectral changes.16 The coaxial nanowire structure having an isolated SWCNT was confirmed by the vis-NIR spectrum of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) (Fig. 3c). From the comparison of the absorption bands (500–1350 nm) arising from SWCNTs before and after the complexation, absorptions decreased slightly because the dispersion of the hybrids was diluted via the complexation process. However, no bundle formation of SWCNTs is observed, after the formation of the SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II). Raman spectra of the coaxial nanowires showed typical scattering of the radial breathing modes (RBMs) and the tangential displacement mode (TDM) of SWCNTs were observed at 213, 225, 235, 240, and 1598 cm−1 (Fig. S8A, ESI†). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) coaxial nanowires showed a higher contrast image compared with that of the SWCNT/fullerodendron supramolecular nanocomposite because of the complexation of platinum(II) to the shell moiety (Fig. 4a). From the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 4b), it was supposed that the K2PtCl4 was not converted into platinum nanoparticles, but coordinated to the shell of an individual coaxial nanowire via ligand exchange reactions, because a very thin nanofiber structure (2–3 nm in diameter) was observed. This result is confirmed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, i.e., no diffraction peaks were observed for SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) coaxial nanowires. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation before and after the formation of dendron–platinum(II) complexes reveals the thickness of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) (ca. 2.8 nm) is almost the same as that of SWCNT/fullerodendron (ca. 2.5 nm). These observations were consistent with the SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) coaxial nanowire structure, the SWCNT-core surrounded by the fullerodendron-shell that was coordinated to platinum(II).

In order to clarify the chemical environment and charge state of the shell-anchored Pt complex, the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopic measurements of the fullerodendron–platinum(II) complex were conducted (Fig. S4A, ESI†). Since the appropriate Pt-concentration for XANES measurements is ca. 20 mM, the fullerodendron–Pt(II) complex was used for the experiments because SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) was not able to disperse in water. The complex formation between fullerodendron and K2PtCl4 took place in the same way as the SWCNT/fullerodendron (see ESI,† Fig. S1–S3). In XANES spectra at the Pt LIII edge, the white line at around 11565 eV is an absorption threshold resonance, which is known to be intensified as a result of oxidation.18 The formation of the Pt(II) complex in the shell moiety via ligand exchange reaction was confirmed by comparing the absorption peak areas of Pt foil, Pt2O, and Pt(II) complexes reported in the literature.19 Furthermore, Fourier transforms (FT) of the X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data for the fullerodendron–Pt(II) complex show a strong peak at around 1.6 Å attributable to Pt–N and/or Pt–O coordination bonds formed by the complexation of Pt(II) with the dendron-shell (Fig. S4B, ESI†).
Continuous H2 evolution from water using SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) coaxial nanohybrids was investigated. In a typical experiment, 150 mL of aqueous solution of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) hybrids (SWCNT content was 0.48 mg), Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 7.5, 0.12 mM), and benzyldihydronicotinamide (BNAH; 1.2 mM), while being stirred vigorously at 25 °C, was exposed to a light of wavelength >422 ± 5 nm using a 300 W Xenon arc lamp. After the designated period, the gas phase above the solution was analyzed by gas chromatography. Fig. 5 (■) shows plots of the total amount of H2 produced versus time using SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) nanohybrids. A steady generation of H2 (8.6 μmol h−1) was observed without an induction period or a decrease in activity during 5 h of irradiation. On the other hand, the coaxial nanohybrids became less active after 10 h because of the consumption of the sacrifice donor, BNAH. Furthermore, no hydrogen evolution was observed in the absence of BNAH. It is notable that the dispersibility, Raman spectrum, and absorption spectrum of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) remained unchanged after the photoirradiation, indicating that the system is quite stable. Compared with the H2 generated by the use of the SWCNT/fullerodendron supramolecular nanohybrid coupled with a colloidal polyvinyl alcohol(PVA)–Pt catalyst in the presence or absence of methyl viologen dichloride (MV2+), 5.3 μmol h−1 (Fig. 5 (●)) or 1.2 μmol h−1 (Fig. 5 (▲)), respectively, the SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) interconnected system exhibits higher H2 production efficiency (8.6 μmol h−1, Fig. 5 (■)). This result indicated that the efficient electron transfer pathway was constructed by the interconnection between the SWCNT/fullerodendron photosensitizer and the Pt(II)-catalyst. Interestingly, in the presence of MV2+, H2 generation was reduced to 1.7 μmol h−1 by the use of the SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) nanohybrids (Fig. 5 (✦)), in marked contrast to SWCNT/fullerodendron supramolecular nanocomposites that required MV2+ as electron relay for efficient evolution of hydrogen. This result indicated that diffusion of MV˙+ produced by one-electron reduction of MV2+ from the surface of the SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) nanohybrids hampered the electron transfer to the Pt(II) complex on the shell of the coaxial nanohybrid. Energy diagram for the hydrogen evolution systems (SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II), MV2+, and Pt nanocolloid) is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Although the three-component system containing SWCNT/fullerodendron, MV2+, and Pt(0) might be more exothermic reaction, SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) have an advantage of efficient electron transfer from C60 to Pt(II) because of direct incorporation of Pt(II) complexes into the dendritic wedges. In order to clarify the utility of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) nanohybrids as a photocatalyst, we evaluated quantum yields for the hydrogen evolution upon irradiation of monochronic light at 450 ± 5 nm. The overall quantum yields for the hydrogen evolution (2 × number of H2 generated/number of photons absorbed) were 16% (for SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II)), 28% (for SWCNT/fullerodendron in the presence of a colloidal PVA–Pt catalyst and MV2+),8 4% (for SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) in the presence of MV2+), and 4% (for SWCNT/fullerodendron in the presence of a colloidal PVA–Pt catalyst) indicating the Pt(II) complex within the shell of the hybrid is important for efficient hydrogen evolution. The quantum yield of hydrogen evolution using the SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) nanohybrid is lower than that of the three-component system8 consisting of SWCNT/fullerodendron, MV2+, and Pt colloid, because the photons absorbed by the Pt(II) complex might not contribute to the hydrogen evolution. But considering the efficiency and content of platinum in the photocatalytic system, the quantum yield (Φ = 0.16) per concentration of platinum of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) (2.7 × 10−2 mM) is estimated to be 5.93 mM−1, which is much higher than the three component system (0.65 mM−1). Furthermore, hydrogen production using SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) is quite efficient in terms of turn over frequency (TOF) of the Pt co-catalyst, because the H2-evolution rate obtained by the use of SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) was estimated to be 3.2 × 10−1 mol h−1 M−1, which is 50 times higher than that of the three-component system (6.3 × 10−3 mol h−1 M−1). Then the SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) supramolecular system is attractive from the point of view of reduction of platinum usage.

Conditions: [MV2+]0 = 2.4 mM; [BNAH]0 = 1.2 mM; [Tris-HCl buffer]0 = 5.0 mM (pH = 7.5); [PVA–Pt]0 = 740 μM, amount of solution = 150 mL, stirring vigorously at 25 °C under Ar, upon exposure to a light of wavelength >422 ± 5 nm with a 300 W Xenon arc lamp. 
Conclusions
In summary, we have described the direct incorporation of a Pt(II) complex into the shell of coaxial nanowire possessing the SWCNT-core. In the presence of BNAH as the sacrifice donor, the SWCNT/fullerodendron/Pt(II) coaxial photosensitizer exhibits a high activity (Φ = 0.16) for hydrogen evolution from water under visible light irradiation without any aid of electron relay such as methyl viologen, although the quantum yield is lower than that of the three-component system containing SWCNT/fullerodendron, methyl viologen, and Pt nanocolloid (Φ = 0.28).8 As the result of the fabrication of the shell-anchored Pt(II) complex, the efficiency of hydrogen evolution per amount of platinum is 23 times higher than that of the three-component system. It is notable that the photosensitizer/co-catalyst interconnected system is potentially an extremely efficient photocatalyst because the electron relay process of the three-component system can be skipped. Further studies on the fabrication and applications of the coaxial nanowires based on the SWCNT-core are now in progress.
