    , Accepted 3rd April 2020First published on 8th April 2020AbstractAmmonia (NH3) has been considered to be a promising hydrogen storage medium owing to the carbon-free features, easy liquefaction storage, low transportation costs, and potential ammonia production from renewable energy sources. On-site hydrogen production using ammonia decomposition offers a sustainable and cost-efficient solution for hydrogen refuelling stations, and separating H2 from a H2–N2 mixture is a necessary step to obtain high-purity H2 (>99.97%). In the scale of a hydrogen refuelling station (∼300 Nm3 h−1), using pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) is not feasible owing to its low recovery, while using polymeric membranes cannot meet the H2 purity demand. To achieve both a high H2 purity and high H2 recovery, we developed a physical-chemical system model of a 300 Nm3 h−1on-site NH3-fed hydrogen refuelling station to optimize a H2 purification subsystem, and furthermore predicted the system efficiency and economic feasibility. We validated our system model using experimental data, and compared eight different scenarios of H2 purification subsystems. The results reveal that a NH3-fed on-site hydrogen refuelling station using a “PSA-to-membrane” subsystem is a feasible method of producing high-purity H2 with a H2 recovery greater than 95%, which is 29% higher than a system only using PSA. Correspondingly, the system efficiency increased from 59.1% to 85.37%, and the total specific cost was reduced by 22% to 4.31 € per kg. The feedstock cost accounts for 74% of the total specific cost. Using our optimized hybrid H2 purification subsystem, the H2 production cost of the NH3-fed on-site hydrogen refuelling station was at least 15% lower than other carbon-free routes (such as electrolysis, solar thermolysis, photo-electrolysis, etc.), and comparable to that of a methane steam reforming system with carbon capture and storage.
Introduction
The problems of global warming, climate change, and fossil fuel depletion have been the main motivation behind the search for clear solutions to replace the use of fossil fuels. Hydrogen has been considered to be one of the most significant clean fuel sources that does not produce carbon emissions.1 However, the development of hydrogen energy technology has been relatively slow, owing to the high costs of the new infrastructure for accessing hydrogen supplies, and the storage and transportation of hydrogen.2 To increase the efficiencies and reduce the losses in transport and storage, hydrogen can be stored chemically in solid hydrides, hydrocarbons or carbon-free NH3. The reason for the interest in using NH3 for H2 storage involves its carbon-free features, easy liquefaction storage, low production and transportation costs, and the potential for ammonia production from renewable energy sources. Several renewable energy based integrated ammonia power systems have been analysed by Dincer et al.1,3 Wind and solar energy could be used for ammonia production as a way of storing hydrogen energy. Furthermore, the implementation of a decentralized “H2 economy” means many small-scale and middle-scale on-site H2 production stations from NH3 may be needed in the future. So far there has been a lot of research conducted in the role of NH3 in H2 economy.1,2,4–8
In addition to NH3 decomposition, the purification of the H2 product is one of the key challenges of using NH3 as a H2 storage media. There are now standards available for the composition requirements of H2 for various applications, such as, ISO 14687-2:2012 (ref. 9) for proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and ISO 14687-3:2014 for stationary PEM fuel cells (FCs). For a stationary PEM fuel cell (FC), the N2 molar fraction can constitute up to 40%, while for FCEVs, the H2 molar fraction can reach as high as 99.97%. Generally, there are several methods for H2 purification: pressure swing adsorption (PSA), membrane separation and cryogenic recovery. Compared with the other two methods, cryogenic recovery is the most energy consuming and is suitable for large-scale industrial applications. Thus, PSA and membrane separation are promising technologies for use in small-scale on-site H2 production from NH3.
Pressure swing adsorption, first developed in the 1950s, is one of the most well developed separating units. Since the 1980s, the traditional separation process for producing high purity H2 has been PSA.10 Product purities of 98%, or even 99.999% are not unusual for the PSA process. Activated carbon and zeolites are the most common porous materials used in H2 purification by PSA, and a lot of research has been carried out on the isotherms of different gases.11–15 With regards to the PSA cycle schedule, most of the H2 losses occur in the initial moments of the blowdown. Thus, one or more ‘pressure equalization’ steps are introduced to increase the H2 recovery.16,17 The units built up to 1975 had four columns and the H2 recovery was around 60%. Nowadays, H2 recovery for a modern large PSA unit with 16 columns is approaching 90%.10 Large-scale PSA units have reached a mature stage owing to the high feed pressure (∼30 atm or more) and the implementation of complex cycle patterns (i.e. a poly-bed process with more pressure equalization steps).
Membrane separation technologies have the potential to reduce operating costs, minimize unit operations and reduce energy consumption. Thus, the development of effective selective membranes has attracted considerable interest in industry and academia.18 Several dense metal membranes have commercialized and extensively used in the semiconductor and LED industries to provide high purity H2.19 Among these dense metal membranes, Pd-based membranes are the most studied, and demonstrate an outstanding performance compared with other metal membranes. However, the expensive price of the Pd membrane prevents it from being used extensively, despite its high permeability and high selectivity. At present, polymeric membranes dominate the H2 separation membrane market, because of their lower material and manufacturing costs, easy accessibility and mild operation conditions. Generally, a high recovery can be achieved by using a large membrane area thanks to the low price. However, polymeric membranes have a relatively low permeability and selectivity,20–22 which make it improper for H2 purification with an ultra-high purity. Physical aging and plasticization are also important for the lifetime of the polymeric membrane.
Despite the mature technology in large-scale PSA units, small-scale PSA units (<500 Nm3 h−1) with a relatively low feed pressure (<10 atm) and less flexibility for modification of the cycle steps, have a relatively low recovery. Thus, combining a PSA unit with membrane separation could be a promising way to obtain high-purity H2 with a high recovery and good economy, and it could be a solution for small-scale on-site H2 production using NH3. There has been some research conducted on hybrid separation systems in other applications. Carrara et al.23 investigated the possibility of increasing the energy efficiency of a methane-steam-reforming (MSR) H2 production plant through the introduction of the Pd membrane which is placed upstream of the PSA unit. Nikolić et al.24 studied the application of a hybrid PSA/membrane scheme on the process of H2 production from MSR off gas. Li et al.25 studied two PSA/membrane hybrid processes for H2 purification from coal gasification syngas. Ohs et al.26 combined the CO2 permeable membrane and PSA unit together for bio-H2 purification.
To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is a lack of knowledge about the development of the H2 production system from NH3 with hybrid separation configurations. In this study, the energy efficiency and economic performance of H2 production systems using NH3 are evaluated, with a focus on the effects of different separation configurations. The H2 production system has the capacity for a small hydrogen station. PSA, Pd membrane and polymeric membrane separation methods were all simulated and compared to find the optimal option.
System description and mathematic model
The H2 production system is shown in Fig. 1, and it mainly consist of four parts: the NH3 decomposition subsystem, NH3 removal unit, H2 purification subsystem, and dispensers. First, NH3 is decomposed, and then the NH3 that has not been decomposed is removed in the NH3 removal unit, resulting in a mixture of H2 and N2. The purification of H2 could be realized through PSA, membrane separation, or the combination of the two technologies. As the pressure difference is essential both in the membrane separation unit and PSA unit, compressors are used in the process as needed. Optimizing the purification subsystem based on the recovery, purity, costs and energy efficiency is the main task of this study. As the PSA process is far more complex than the other units, the parametric study of the PSA process is performed alone, and the performance results of the PSA unit are fitted and used for optimization of the whole system. The design requirements on the system include a H2 purity of 99.97%, H2 productivity of 300 Nm3 h−1 (25 kg h−1), and a pressure of 900 bar, according to the demands of a hydrogen station.27
 Fig. 1  NH3-fed on-site hydrogen refuelling station system. 
NH3 decomposition unit and NH3 removal unit
NH3 decomposition is designed to take place over a commercial Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (ACTA Hypermec 10010) at about 500 °C.28 According to the experiments results, conversions very close to equilibrium can be achieved owing to the high activity of the catalyst. The relationship between the conversions and pressure levels is fitted based on the experimental results28 for a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1200 h−1, and is used in this study. About 15.5% of the gas mixture resulting from the decomposition is burned to provide the heat load for decomposition. Several heat exchangers are introduced to recover the waste heat. (1)
Zeolite Li-X is used as an adsorbent for NH3 removal, and the NH3 concentration could be reduced down to 0.01–0.02 ppm using dynamic adsorption methods.29 Thus, the trace amount of NH3 can be neglected in the following H2–N2 separation unit. The condition of the ammonia feed and the outlet conditions of the NH3 removal unit are shown in Table 1.

Membrane separation unit
The membrane separation unit in this study has the configuration of a hollow fibre module, and a typical hollow fibre bundle is of the order of 105 hollow fibres, which are tightly packed.22 The gas mixture is introduced into the bore side and the purified product is collected in the shell side. A counter current flow mode was chosen to maximize the available driving force of the mass transfer.
A discretized model is used for the mathematic description of the membrane separation component. The mass balance equation is shown as eqn (2), in which Ci is the component molar concentration and Ji is the permeation flux. The permeation flux across the membrane is calculated based on the permeability Pi, the membrane thickness and the partial pressure difference across the membrane, as shown in eqn (3). The isothermal process assumption is introduced to balance the energy in the membrane separation unit. (2) Ji = (ptube,i − pshell,i)Pi/l(3)
In this study, two different membranes are simulated, including one polymeric membrane and one Pd membrane. The permeability of H2 and N2 for each membrane is shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the commercial polymeric membrane, PPO,22 has a relatively low permeability and selectivity, while the Pd membrane, GTC-75,30 has a relatively high permeability and selectivity. The thickness of the PPO membrane is assumed to be 1 μm,31 and the thickness of the GTC-75 membrane is 7.1 μm.

PSA unit
For this study, an established and published PSA process consisting of two beds and six cyclic steps, with one pressure equalization is used.32 The cycle sequence and time schedule for the PSA process is shown in Fig. 2. Zeolite 13X is used as the adsorbent in the PSA process. To obtain high-purity H2 under different conditions, the purge step in the PSA cycle is controlled by means of the purge-to-feed ratio (P/F ratio), which is defined in eqn (4). (4)
 Fig. 2  Cycle schedule for the 2-bed PSA process. 
The dynamic model for the PSA process used in this work mainly consists of mass, energy, and momentum balance equations, which are briefly introduced here. The mass balance for each species in the fluid phase is shown in eqn (5), in which ε is the porosity, Di is the diffusion coefficient, and Ni is the source term related to the adsorption. (5)
The generation term is the sum of the accumulation in the gas phase in particles and the amount adsorbed, as shown in eqn (6), in which Qi is the component concentration in the adsorbent. (6)
Ergun's equation was applied to the pressure drop across the bed. The bulk flow heat balance is shown in eqn (7), in which k is the heat transfer coefficient and λ is the thermal conductivity. (7)
The mass balance for the adsorbed phase is approximated with an linear driving force (LDF) rate model using a constant lumped mass-transfer parameter ki as shown in eqn (8), in which  is the component concentration in the adsorbent at the adsorption equilibrium. (8)
The adsorption equilibrium is predicted using the Sips model as shown in eqn (9), and the parameters for H2 and N2 are shown in Table 3.12 (9) Qm = k1 + k2T(10) B = k3exp(k4/T)(11) ni = k5 + k6/T(12)

Compressors
Compressors are used to generate the driving force for membrane separation or the PSA unit. In this study, isothermal compression using multistage compressors with inter-stage cooling are assumed, and the energy consumption is calculated according to eqn (13), in which ηcom is the compressor efficiency. (13)
System configuration
In this study, different system configurations were compared to find the optimal solution from the point of view of the energetic efficiency and economic analysis. Firstly, there are two options for the pressure level in the NH3 decomposition reactor, which could be at atmosphere pressure or at an elevated pressure, which is the same as the pressure for separation. If NH3 decomposition takes place at an elevated pressure, a compression process could be omitted at the inlet of the H2–N2 separation system, and this will certainly reduce the costs related to the compressor at the cost of a slightly reduced conversion in NH3 decomposition. Secondly, different configurations of the separation system are discussed. A preview is shown in Table 4, including separation by PSA or membrane only, membrane cascade, and several hybrid configurations.

Energetic and economic performance
In order to compare different configurations, the energetic and economic performance are evaluated. The energy efficiency is defined using eqn (14), taking into account all of the energy consumption during the separation process. The LHV represents the lower heating value of the components. It should be mentioned that compression work is unnecessary before NH3 decomposition even if the reaction takes place at an elevated pressure, because pressure control for liquid NH3 is easy. (14)
The specific total cost (STC) is the sum of the specific investment costs (SIC) and the specific operation costs (SOC). The SIC include terms related to the decomposition, membrane separation, PSA process, and compressors, as shown in eqn (16). The SOC include terms related to the ammonia feed, decomposition catalyst, membrane, adsorbent and electricity, as shown in eqn (17). (15) (16) (17)
The SIC are calculated using the annual hydrogen productivity and the equivalent annual investment costs which are calculated according to the even yearly cash flow during the plant lifetime,34 as shown in eqn (18). (18)
The specific operation costs are calculated using the annual hydrogen productivity and the yearly operation costs, as shown in eqn (19). (19)
More details about the calculation of investment costs and operation costs are included in the ESI.† Information about prices and lifetimes are shown in Table 5.

Validation
A simulation package known as the gPROMS process builder was used to solve the above described mathematical model. The breakthrough experiments by Jee15 were used for validation of the adsorption column model, as shown in Fig. 3a. The membrane separation model was validated by comparison with the results from Coker,39 as shown in Fig. 3b. Generally, the predicted results were in good agreement with the data in the references.

Results
In this section, results from different configuration systems are analysed from the point of view of the purity, recovery, energetic efficiency and economic analysis. The effects of the pressure level on the performance of the system are also studied.
H2 purification using a PSA unit
There are many factors affecting the performance of the PSA process, such as cycle configuration, time schedule, the flow rate of feeding and purging, boundary conditions, the properties of the adsorbents, and so on, which makes PSA analysis and optimization complex. Moreover, when combining PSA with other chemical engineering processes, taking into account all of the factors for PSA would be impossible. Thus, in this study, four main factors are considered based on the PSA cycle,32 and those are adsorption pressure, P/F ratio, feed flowrate and feed composition.
For a certain adsorption pressure and inlet composition, high-purity H2 could be produced by setting the feed flowrate, cycle schedule, and purge flow rate properly. In this study, the superficial velocity in the PSA column at the AD step of PSA cycle was around 0.01m s−1 in different cases, and the superficial velocity at the PG step was around 0.02m s−1. Fig. 4a shows the amount of N2 adsorbed during the PSA cycle, including the adsorption and desorption process.
 Fig. 4  Performance of the PSA unit: (a) adsorbed nitrogen at the end of each step in cycle, and (b) recovery and processing capacity under different working conditions. 
In this section, different adsorption pressure levels (11, 8, and 4 atm) and different inlet H2 molar fraction (75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%) were simulated. The effects of the feed composition on the recovery and processing capacity were studied while maintaining the product purity (≥99.97%). The calculated results are shown in Fig. 4b as dots. Generally, the recovery and processing capacity increase with the H2 molar fraction of the feed and adsorption pressure. The results of these cases are fitted using surface functions and will be used in the following study when dealing with hybrid separation configurations.
For cases with an inlet H2 molar fraction of 75%, the effects of the adsorption pressure level on the energy efficiency and specific costs are shown in Fig. 5a with decomposition at the same pressure as the adsorption. Generally, the energy efficiency increases with the adsorption pressure and is approximately equal to the recovery when compared with Fig. 4. Fig. 5a also shows the energy efficiency when the decomposition pressure is 1 atm. It can be seen that although the elevated pressure level makes the composition conversion decrease slightly, it does increase the energy efficiency owing to the reduction of the compression work for the PSA unit. As to the specific costs, it can be seen from Fig. 5a that the feed cost contributes to the specific cost of H2 the most. Generally, for a specific productivity, a lower recovery means a higher amount of feed, and a higher operation cost with feed. Thus, the costs are lower for cases with a higher adsorption pressure, and the total specific cost is about 5.54 € per kgH2 when the adsorption pressure is 11 atm. Moreover, it is expected that the specific cost could be reduced significantly by increasing the recovery.
 Fig. 5  Effects of pressure level on specific costs of the system using PSA-only separation: (a) adsorption pressure, and (b) decomposition pressure. 

Fig. 5b shows the effects of the NH3 decomposition pressure on the specific costs when the adsorption pressure is 11 atm. It can be seen that, if NH3 decomposition takes place at the adsorption pressure, the reduced conversion means a higher cost of NH3. However, costs related to the compression decreased much more, leading to a decrease in the total specific cost. In addition, the increase in the feed costs owing to the elevated decomposition pressure would be even smaller in cases with a higher recovery. Thus, NH3 decomposition at an elevated pressure in this study is preferred from the point of view of the energetic and economic performance. For a case in which decomposition and adsorption occur at 11 atm, the total specific cost is 5.54 € per kgH2, while it is 5.77 € per kgH2 for a case in which decomposition occurs at atmospheric pressure and adsorption at 11 atm, and the reduction is about 4.1%.
H2 purification with membrane separation
In this section, one stage of the membrane separation and the membrane separation cascades are all studied. According to the previous analysis, NH3 is decomposed at an elevated pressure which is the same as the pressure for membrane separation. Fig. 6a and b show the purity and recovery of a one-stage membrane separation when the feed pressure is 11 atm. As can be seen, the separation using a one-stage Pd membrane could produce high-purity H2 with a high recovery. For a 1 mol s−1 H2 and N2 mixture, a 300 m2 GTC-75 membrane is needed to obtain 99.97% H2 with 90.8% recovery. However, the case using the PPO membrane did not give a good performance, owing to the low permeability and selectivity.
 Fig. 6  Performance of membrane separation systems: (a) purity of one-stage membrane; (b) recovery of one-stage membrane; (c) purity and recovery of PPO membranes cascade. 
For the PPO membrane, the results of cascades with different numbers of stages are shown in Fig. 6c. The recovery of each stage membrane is set to about 98%. It can be seen that, owing to the low selectivity of the PPO membrane, even the membrane cascade of the four stages only achieves a purity of 99.84%, which still does not reach the requirement of 99.97%. Furthermore, the recovery decreases when the number of stages increases. Moreover, the membrane area also increases significantly with the number of stages, which increases the facility size in addition to the several compressors needed in cascade system.
The specific costs for the case using the GTC-75 membrane are shown in Fig. 7a. Owing to the high price of the Pd membrane, the costs related to the membrane contribute significantly to the total specific cost in addition to the feed cost. As the costs related to compression only accounts for 6% for the case of 11 atm, increasing the pressure to save the Pd membrane area is beneficial to cost reduction, as shown in Fig. 7b. The total specific cost is about 5.39 € per kgH2 when the pressure for membrane separation is 29 atm. The energy efficiency was slightly decreased with the increase in pressure, because the compression work required increased with pressure. It should be mentioned that, the recovery in Fig. 7a is 90.8%, still far away from the required 98%, and the membrane area increases significantly when the recovery is higher, causing the costs to become unpractical.
 Fig. 7  (a) Specific cost distribution of the system using the Pd membrane; and (b) the effects of the Pd membrane pressure on the total specific cost and energy efficiency. 
H2 purification with hybrid PSA/membrane separation
From the analysis above, it can be shown that, separation by PSA could produce high-purity H2 but with a relatively low recovery, separation using a Pd membrane has a high specific cost despite its high purity and high recovery, and separation using a PPO membrane does not meet the requirements of purity despite the high recovery. Thus, combining the PSA unit together with the polymeric membrane is a promising way to meet the demands of both the purity and recovery. There are several types of hybrid separation system shown in Table 4. Despite the different combinations, there are some common features. First, high-purity H2 is obtained from the PSA unit. Second, to obtain a high total recovery, the recovery for the membrane stage is set to be sufficiently high (≥98%), and the tail gas from the PSA unit and the gas from the membrane are recycled if needed. Thus, the high recovery and high purity could both be realized by the hybrid separation systems.

Fig. 8a shows the recovery, specific costs and energy efficiency of four hybrid separation configurations. Generally, hybrid separation configurations have a better performance than the Pd membrane unit and PSA unit. The recoveries of the hybrid separation methods are all higher than 95%, the energy efficiency approaches 80% or higher, and the total specific cost is about 4.31–4.72 € per kgH2, which is about a 16–24% reduction when compared with the Pd membrane system or PSA only. The configuration of “PSA-to-membrane” is the best option among the cases shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Specific costs, recovery and energy efficiency of systems with hybrid separation configurations: (a) four hybrid configurations, and (b) the other two hybrid configurations with two recirculation loops. 
In addition to the four hybrid separation configurations shown in Fig. 8a, there are still two configurations with two recirculation loops, named ‘MEM–PSA–MEM–RR’ and ‘MEM–MEM–PSA–RR’ in Table 4. As there is only one branch of tail gas in these two configurations, the membrane unit with tail gas was set to achieve 98% recovery, and the other membrane area was a free variable. The results are shown in Fig. 8b. It can be seen that, for the configuration ‘MEM–PSA–MEM–RR’, the total specific cost increases slightly in the 2nd stage membrane area. Moreover, when the 2nd stage membrane area is small enough, the ‘MEM–PSA–MEM–RR’ configuration is simplified to the configuration of ‘Membrane-to-PSA’. Thus, the total specific cost of ‘MEM–PSA–MEM–RR’ is approaching that of ‘Membrane-to-PSA’ when the 2nd stage membrane is close to zero. However, for ‘MEM–MEM–PSA–RR’, the total specific cost increases significantly with the decrease of the 2nd stage membrane area. Upon comparing Fig. 8a and b, it can be seen that the configuration of ‘PSA-to-membrane’ has the highest energy efficiency and the lowest total specific cost among all of the hybrid separation subsystems.

Fig. 8a also shows the specific cost distributions of some of the hybrid separations. As can be seen, the ‘PSA-to-membrane’ case has the lowest compression costs, which is in accordance with its energy efficiency performance. Furthermore, the ‘PSA-to-membrane’ case also has the highest PSA costs. Other hybrid separation configurations reduce the PSA costs by placing the PSA unit in the downstream, but accordingly, the costs associated with compression and membrane are increased, leading to an increase in the total specific cost.

Fig. 9 shows the effects of pressure on the performance of the ‘PSA-to-membrane’ system, including the adsorption pressure and the pressure for membrane separation. As can be seen, with the increase in the adsorption pressure, the energy efficiency increases. The reason for this is not straightforward. Increasing the adsorption pressure in the ‘PSA-to-membrane’ case has two effects. One is the decrease in the conversion of the NH3 decomposition, as the decomposition pressure is set as equal to the adsorption pressure as shown in the ‘H2 purification with PSA unit’ section. The other is the increase in the recovery of the PSA unit, which decreases the flow rate of the PSA tail gas, the recycle flow rate and the corresponding compression work. These two effects both contribute to the energy efficiency, and the decrease in the compression work dominates the net effect. The total specific cost also decreases with the increase in the adsorption pressure. The pressure of the membrane separation is also studied, as shown in Fig. 9b. It can be seen that, with the increase in pressure, the energy efficiency and total specific cost both decrease. This is because more compression work is needed for a higher pressure and membrane costs are reduced by the higher pressure difference across the membrane.

Different separation subsystems have been simulated in sections before. Configurations that meet the demand for H2 purity (99.97%) are summarized in Table 6. Comparing the six hybrid separation configurations in Table 4, it can be found that configurations with more stages have a lower energy efficiency owing to the increased compression work used. Furthermore, the placement of the PSA unit also affects the energy efficiency. As the high-purity H2 is produced from the PSA unit, the stream molar flow rate decreased a lot after passing the PSA unit and the compression work that followed was therefore smaller. Thus, from the view of energy efficiency, placing the PSA unit on the upstream is recommended.

Fig. 10a shows the specific cost details of the system with a ‘PSA-to-membrane’ and the system with PSA only. It can be seen that the hybrid separation configuration significantly reduced the feed costs by increasing the recovery, and slightly increased the costs related to compression. The costs associated with the PSA unit were almost the same. For the ‘PSA-to-membrane’ configuration, a recovery higher than 95% means there is not much potential to further reduce the feed cost (about 3.19 € per kgH2 or 3.54 $ per kgH2, accounting for 74%), and the remaining part of the specific costs (about 1.125 € per kgH2 or 1.25 $ per kgH2) mainly includes the cost of compression, PSA and decomposition, and the cost of the membranes, accounting for about 13.3%, 6.5%, 3.63% and 2.56% respectively. Further improvement could be sought from the optimal design of the PSA unit, as increasing the recovery of the PSA would not only reduce the volume of the PSA columns, but also reduce the tail gas flow rate from PSA, resulting in a decrease in the succeeding compression work. Thus, increasing the recovery of the PSA could further reduce the total specific cost of H2 production.
 Fig. 10  (a) Comparison of the specific cost between the system using ‘PSA-to-membrane’ and the PSA-only separation subsystems, and (b) comparison of the H2 production costs between the different routes. 
Furthermore, it would be meaningful to compare the specific costs in this study with other hydrogen production routes. However, there are some uncertainties regarding the cost of hydrogen production which are strongly affected by the production technology, existing infrastructure, feedstock price, and some further simplifications and assumptions. Thus, care should be taken in carrying out comparisons. According to Dagdougui et al.,40 the hydrogen production cost from MSR varies from about 1.25 US$ per kgH2 for large systems to about 3.50 US$ per kgH2 for small systems with a natural gas price of 0.3 US$ per kg. In addition, the cost for carbon-capture-and-storage (CCS) varies from about 0.19 to 0.29 US$ per kgH2.41 The production cost in this paper by ‘PSA-to-membrane’ configuration is 4.31 € per kgH2 (about 4.78 $ per kgH2), with an ammonia price of 0.5US$ per kg. Thus, roughly, the H2 production cost by ammonia is comparable to that by MSR with CCS, but slightly higher, which is most attributable to the feedstock cost difference. If comparing between carbon-free routes, then H2 production from ammonia would be more competitive, as other carbon-free routes have a cost ranging from 5.1 to 10 US$ per kgH2,41 as shown in Fig. 10b. Furthermore, as the NH3 decomposition in this study uses the auto-thermal configuration, which means a portion of the NH3 feed is used as fuel to provide a heat load, other heating methods could be adopted as necessary to save the use of NH3. If so, the specific total cost of hydrogen production could be reduced to about 3.8 € per kgH2 or 4.24 $ per kgH2.
Conclusions
In this study, we developed a physical-chemical system model of a 300 Nm3 h−1on-site NH3-fed hydrogen refuelling station to evaluate its efficiency and economic feasibility. The detailed physical-chemical models of the PSA unit and membrane separation unit were built after validation using experimental data obtained from two membrane materials and a zeolite 13X adsorbent. Firstly, we compared eight types of H2–N2 separation subsystems including PSA-only, membrane-only, and several hybrid PSA/membrane configurations. The main conclusions are as follows:
(1) In spite of a minor decrease in NH3 decomposition conversion, pressurizing the NH3 decomposition reactor (up to 11 atm) can better match the subsequent H2 purification process in pressure, hence, an extra compressor for membranes or PSA should be avoided. Overall, a pressurized NH3 decomposition reactor can make the system more compact and reduce specific costs by 4.1%.
(2) We found a small-scale 2-bed 6-step PSA unit with zeolite 13X has a relatively low recovery of 66%, leading to an energy efficiency of 59% and an estimated total specific cost of 5.54 € per kgH2 in the system using PSA-only purification.
(3) Separation using a Pd membrane could produce high purity H2 with a recovery of 90.8%, but the high price of the Pd membrane results in an estimated total specific cost as high as 5.39 € per kgH2 even if the pressure is increased to 26 atm. Separation using a PPO membrane can achieve a high recovery but cannot meet the purity requirements, even if using a 4-stage cascade.
(4) The six hybrid separation configurations tested could all produce high purity H2 with a recovery greater than 95%, and the energy efficiencies were greater than 80%. Fewer stages in the hybrid configurations and placing of the PSA unit upstream were found to be beneficial to the energetic and economic performance. The ‘PSA-to-membrane’ configuration has the lowest specific cost of about 4.31 € per kgH2, about 22% lower than that of using PSA alone, showing a substantial improvement.
(5) For the H2 production system with a ‘PSA-to-membrane’ configuration, the total specific cost of 4.31 € per kgH2 mainly consists of 74% feed costs, 13.3% compression cost, 6.5% PSA cost, 3.63% decomposition cost and 2.56% membrane cost. As its recovery is greater than 95%, further improvements could be sought from the optimal design of the PSA unit, as increasing the recovery of PSA could reduce both the PSA costs and the compression costs.
(6) The cost of H2 production from ammonia in this study is significantly lower than other carbon-free H2 production routes, and is comparable to that from MSR with CCS, but slightly higher, mainly due to the difference in the feedstock costs. If a heat load other than NH3 fuel could be used for the decomposition, the specific total cost of hydrogen production could be reduced to 3.82 € per kgH2.
