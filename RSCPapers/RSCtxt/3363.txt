1. Introduction
The field of textiles has experienced great development and a high degree of innovation during the last few years. Modern textiles can no longer be considered as mere garments since nowadays they incorporate new functionalities. These functionalities are normally provided by the development and application of new materials. The different applications developed include: flame resistance,1 thermal regulation,2 electrochromic,3 antimicrobial,4 UV protection,5 self-cleaning,6 solar energy harvesting,7 photonic,8 electrical conduction,9 or even catalysis,10 have been reported on textiles. Electrical conduction is of particular interest since its development allows the integration of computing, digital components and electronics in the fabrics. Different methods have been developed for conferring conductivity on fabrics, such as: the employment of metallic fibers,11 chemical metallization of fibers,12 extrusion of fibers with conducting particles,13 or the synthesis of conducting polymer film on the fabrics.14–16
Recently, graphene has emerged as a revolutionary material due to its amazing properties such as: high electron mobility at room temperature (2.5 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1), high thermal conductivity (above 3000 W m K−1), Young's modulus (1 TPa), intrinsic strength (130 GPa), impermeability to any gases, ability to sustain high electric currents densities, easy chemical functionalization, etc.17 Its isolation in 2004 by A. K. Geim and K. S. Novoselov,18 and the groundbreaking experiments they performed allowed them to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010.19 Possible applications of graphene materials pointed out in bibliography include: flexible electronics, photonics and optoelectronics, spintronics, composite materials, energy generation and storage, biomedical applications, sensors, etc.17,20 The number of papers published every year related to graphene has suffered an exponential evolution, as does the number of patents. European Union has devoted a great economic effort (1000 million €) to graphene research under the Graphene Flagship Horizon 2020 programme. The aim of this programme is “to take graphene and related layered materials from the realm of fundamental science to industrial and societal applications in the space of ten years”.
Having mentioned all the properties and possible applications of graphene materials family, the integration of graphene into textiles was a logical step in order to achieve not only conductive textiles but also multifunctional fabrics. Several reviews have been written about the production and application of graphene fibers that is another area of development in the field.21–24 The methods for the production of G fibers are normally based on the coagulation of a precursor solution. However, up to date, no review has been written about graphene-based fabrics and their applications. The aim of this review is to fill the existing gap with an evaluation of all the work performed in this area and their applications. The review is focused on the most widely employed approaches to obtain G-based fabrics: the chemical deposition of G, GO or RGO on fabrics and the production of GWFs by means of CVD technique.
2. Graphene-based fabrics
Mainly, three methods have been developed in bibliography for the production of G-based fabrics/yarns. The first one is the chemical coating of fabrics/yarns with G materials such as G, GO, RGO, etc. The second one consists in the CVD deposition process of G on a metallic mesh (Cu normally) that is later removed by an acid treatment, remaining after this process only the G-fabric structure, these type of fabrics are named graphene woven fabrics (GWF). And the third one, includes the production of G fibers and its application on fabrics that is not considered in the review since it has been widely covered in other reviews.21–24
The most widely employed method is the first one due to its easy application, as well as scalability. As well, usually, the material employed to coat the fabrics is GO that is cheaper than G and can be obtained in larger quantities due to the process of production that consists in chemical oxidation methods.25,26 GO is an insulating material due to the disrupted sp2 structure produced by the oxidation of graphite during its synthesis. However, its conductivity can be partially restored after reduction of GO to produce RGO.25,26
2.1. Graphene-coated fabrics
This section provides a compilation of the work performed in bibliography employing simple coating of G, GO, RGO, etc. on fabrics or textile fibers mainly by aqueous solution impregnation (dip coating). As mentioned previously, GO is the most employed material due to its lower prize. In addition, GO has a negatively charged structure which makes it ideal for its dispersion in aqueous solutions.27 What is more, the negative charges of GO allow their interaction with the functional groups of the fabrics, thus increasing the fixation of GO. The posterior conversion to RGO by chemical, electrochemical, thermal or UV methods allows the partial restoration of conductivity as explained previously. However, the reduction is not complete and recalcitrant oxidized groups cannot be reduced, thus conferring a negative zeta potential to the surface of RGO.27 On the other hand, G has no charged surface and tends to precipitate in aqueous solutions. When employing G in solution to coat fabrics, the deposition has to be aided by dispersants to help in the dispersion and stability of the G solutions. A lot of work has been performed employing the coating of fabrics with G materials.28–85
Fig. 1 shows the adsorption process of GO sheets on the surface of different fibers to form a GO layer. Thereafter, the reduction converts insulating GO to conducting RGO due to the partial restoration of the sp2 structure. GO on fabrics has a characteristic brown color, which is converted into black color after reduction. The process for fixing G is similar to this one but it does not include the reduction process. The interaction of GO, G or RGO with the fibers is essential to allow their fixation on the fibers surface and obtain a proper coating with good conductivity. Functional groups present on the fibers help in their fixation. Their interaction with the fibers can be through electrostatic interaction, van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, π–π interactions, hydrophobic interactions, etc. In order to boost their fixation, different chemicals and processes have been also employed for such purpose.

BSA, which is a pH sensitive protein, has been widely employed for this objective.37,40,45,49,57,58,62 Below pH 4.9 it has positive charge and above pH 4.9 negative charge. When adsorbed on the fabrics, the positive charges of BSA helped in the adsorption process of GO (which has negative charges) and created electrostatic forces that allowed the self-assembly of GO on the fabrics. Molina et al. applied plasma treatment to generate negative charges on the surface of PES,45 these negative charges increased the BSA fixation that charged positively the surface of the fabrics, and allowed the self assembly of GO sheets. In addition, the high roughness produced by the plasma treatment also helped in the fixation process of GO sheets. Zhao et al. also applied plasma treatment in order to increase the wettability of nylon/lycra fabrics and facilitate GO adhesion.80
NCPCl has been employed to treat PES fibers and increase GO adsorption.34 The interaction between PES and NCPCl was due to hydrogen bond between carboxyl groups of PES and pyridinium group of the surfactant. A complete study taking into account the different interactions (and their energy) that can take place between the fiber surface and GO was performed. The most effective adsorption took place at pH 3 (where an adsorption capacity of 0.38 mg GO/g fiber was obtained).
Chitosan has been employed as dispersant and binding additive of GNSs.28 WPU has been also employed as dispersant and binding additive of GNPs. Hydrogen bonds were formed between –NH groups of WPU and –OH groups of GNPs.29,31 The employment of PU has been also reported,50 it was fixed on PET due to the interaction between the carbonyl group of PET and the –NH group of PU. Dipolar interactions or hydrogen bonding helped in the fixation of RGO on the fabrics. The use of resins has been also reported for increasing the fixation of G derivatives.52
PEI, which reacted with hydroxyl groups of cellulose, was employed to form a cationic layer on cotton fabrics. Thereafter layer-by-layer self-assembly approach was employed to coat samples with multiple alternate layers (up to 6) of PEDOT-PSS-GNS (polyanion) and chitosan (polycation) based on electrostatic interaction.30
SDS surfactant helped in the dispersion of GNRs in solution but also increased their affinity to cotton fibers and produced a more evenly distribution of GNRs on the surface of the fibers (Fig. 2).60 Sodium cholate surfactant has also been employed for the dispersion of GNSs.72,73

Acid treatment has been also reported on carbon fibers to increase their hydrophilicity and increase ERGO adhesion.82
The dip coating method has been widely employed, and the majority of papers have employed this approach. The fabric is placed in contact with the solution containing the G material for a certain amount of time and after this, the fabric is dried. If necessary, reduction is performed afterwards. However, other methods for G and GO deposition have been employed, such as: vacuum filtration,32,61 brush coating,33,78 direct electrochemical deposition,82,84 electrophoresis,64,67,68 kinetic trapping method,47 wet transfer of monolayer films,42,75 or screen printing.63 The use of ultrasonication during the synthesis has also been reported during the dip coating process and allowed a homogeneous distribution of the coating on the fabrics.48,50,61,71,76
When employing GO, a reduction method is necessary to restore the conductivity of the G structure. The majority of works that employ GO as precursor, employ chemical reductants such as ascorbic acid,36,38,61,80 Na2S2O4,38,39,43–45,57 hydroiodic acid,37,46,49,51,59,62,65,85 hydrazine,38,40,46,48,50,58,59,67,68,74,76,84 NaBH4,38,69 NaOH,38,83 TiCl3,54,56 ammonium hydroxide,67 or hydroxylamine hydrochloride.81 However, other methods such as thermal reduction,71,77–79 electrochemical reduction,64,82,84 or UV reduction33 have been applied due to the advantage that no chemicals are employed and no by-products are generated by the reduction process. In the case of thermal reduction, the process has to be carried out in inert atmosphere and damage to the fibers can occur due to the elevated temperature. The electrochemical reduction needs a conductive substrate to carry the current flow and for this reason it is mainly applied on carbon cloth substrates. In a study, the effect of the reductant (NaBH4, N2H4, C6H8O6, Na2S2O4 and NaOH) on the electrical properties of RGO/cotton fabrics was performed by Shateri-Khalilabad et al.38 To reach proper levels of conductivity, different number of G/RGO layers are normally applied to the fabrics.
Different textile substrates have been employed in bibliography, Table 1 shows a summary of the work performed.28–85 As well, composition, different parameters employed during the synthesis of the coating, method of reduction, application of the fabric and properties of interest have been included in Table 1.

2.2. Applications of graphene coated fabrics
2.2.1. UV-blocking. Graphene derivatives have been widely employed as UV-blocking materials for coating the fabrics and obtain functional fabrics.28–33 G has a UV absorption peak around 281 nm, hence it can absorb UV radiation with a wavelength comprised in the 100–281 nm range. For wavelengths >281, reflection could play a role due to the planar structure of G.29 With a value a UPF >50, excellent UV protection is achieved, in all the works performed in bibliography, high UPF factors can be easily achieved with low G concentrations. The durability of the coatings was confirmed after washing tests, where little variation of the UPF factor was observed.28–32Tian et al.28 coated cotton fabrics with GNSs with the aid of chitosan as dispersant and binding additive. With a low G content in the coating solution (<1% wt) the UV-blocking properties of the substrate increased a 60-fold when compared with bare cotton. Qu et al.29 coated cotton fabrics with GNPs. WPU was employed to aid the dispersion of GNPs at different content (0.05–0.4% wt). Hydrogen bonds were formed between –NH groups of WPU and –OH groups of GNPs. With a small GNPs content a high UPF was achieved (356.74, 10-fold increase when compared to bare cotton fabric). Tian et al.30 deposited by electrostatic layer-by-layer self-assembly PEDOT-PSS (polyanion) and chitosan (polycation). GNS were also employed to dope PEDOT and enhance its electronic and UV-shielding properties. First of all, a cationic layer was formed on cotton fabrics with PEI coating, which reacted with hydroxyl groups of cellulose fibers. Thereafter the anionic layer (GNS/PEDOT/PSS) was deposited by electrostatic self-assembly. After washing and drying, the cationic layer (chitosan) was applied. This process was repeated from 1 to 6 times. The presence of GNS produced a decrease of the electrical resistivity of 2 orders of magnitude. The UPF also increased notably due to the presence of GNS (92.4 vs. 312, without and with GNSs, respectively).
Hu et al.31 coated cotton fabrics with GNPs. Fig. 3a shows the cotton fabric prior to the GNPs deposition and Fig. 3b shows the fabric after the coating was applied. The UPF value achieved in this case was 500 (0.8% wt GNPs), a 60-fold increase when compared to bare cotton fabrics. In addition, the fabrics also showed increasing far-infrared emissivity as the GNPs content increased. The higher content of GNPs allows the heat to be converted into infrared light that could be detected by a thermograph (this can be observed from Fig. 3c to Fig. 3f). Far-infrared radiation boosts blood circulation and metabolism as well as it helps in recovering muscles form fatigue. For this reason, materials that emit far-infrared radiation have been employed for therapeutic and health purposes. Conductivity and thermal conductivity increased with the increasing G content, as well.

Tang et al.32 coated cotton with GO by vacuum filtration deposition, thereafter Pani was chemically deposited on the surface of the GO/cotton fabric. Fabrics acted as UV-blocking and conductive materials. Since GO is an insulating material, Pani provided the conductivity. When GO was deposited on the surface of cotton, it provided a substrate where Pani could be homogeneously coated and agglomerations of Pani were avoided, which boosted the conductivity of the fabrics. Javed et al.33 coated cotton and wool fabrics by brush coating with GO. Later GO was reduced to RGO by UV light irradiation, avoiding the employment of additional chemicals to achieve the GO reduction. Strong GO adsorption was obtained on both fabrics due to strong van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds. Excellent UV blocking properties were also observed by the authors.

2.2.2. Hydrophobic fabrics. Graphene oxide is amphiphilic since it has hydrophobic areas where functional groups are not present and hydrophilic ones where they are present. The edge regions are more hydrophilic due to the presence of these functional groups that facilitate the adhesion with the functional groups of the fabrics. However, the central part of the GO sheets is mainly composed of CC bonds which confere them a hydrophobic behavior in this part. This has been employed to produce hydrophobic fabrics. Tissera et al.35 coated cotton fabrics with GO by dipping method in solutions containing different GO concentrations. With the more concentrated solutions, thicker GO coatings were deposited on the fabrics, mid regions of GO were dominant (hydrophobic regions) and consequently more hydrophobicity was obtained. Shateri-Khalilabad and Yazdanshenas36 produced conductive superhydrophobic textiles by coating cotton with RGO and later with nanostructured PMS (a hydrophobic material in the form of filaments of 30–90 nm). GO was fixed on cotton through van der Waals and hydrogen bonds and was reduced by ascorbic acid. The reduction of GO to RGO produced the removal of functional groups and RGO gained hydrophobicity as quantified by contact angle measurements. The additional PMS coating provided nanoscale roughness and further increased the contact angle on the conductive fabrics. Thus, self-cleaning fabrics could be obtained. Fig. 4 shows images of water contact angle measurements performed on original cotton fabric (Fig. 4a), RGO–cotton (Fig. 4b) and PMS–RGO–cotton (Fig. 4c).

2.2.3. Electrically conductive fabrics. The majority of works compiled in this review take advantage of G, or RGO coatings to produce conductive fabrics. The conductivity gained allow these fabrics to be employed for functional textiles, antistatic materials, etc. The conductivity obtained on the fabrics depends on the concentration of G/GO/RGO in the solution employed to coat the fabrics. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the surface conductivity of PET fabrics with the RGO content employed in the coating solution. In this study, PU was employed as an intermediate adhesive layer and dipolar interactions or hydrogen bonding helped in the fixation of RGO on the fabrics. With a concentration higher than 0.001% RGO wt in solution, an abrupt change in the surface conductivity was obtained due to the formation of a continuous and conducting RGO layer on PET fabrics. Being such an important parameter, the concentration of the GO/RGO/G solutions for the different studies has been also included in Table 1 when available.
 Fig. 5  Change in the surface conductivity of the composite fabrics with the increase in the weight fraction of RGO in the initial aqueous dispersion. The insets display SEM images of the composite fabrics prepared at RGO fractions of 0.001 (I), 0.030 (II) and 0.080 wt% (III). Reproduced from ref. 50 with permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
The conductivity obtained also depends on the number of G/RGO layers applied and it is normal to apply a high number of G/RGO coatings on the fabrics to achieve appropriate levels of conductivity. Fig. 6 shows an evolution of the resistance of the cotton fabrics coated with RGO–BSA (CCF–RGO) and RGO (SCF–RGO). As it can be seen, BSA coating improves the fixation and conductivity of the fabric whichever the number of coatings applied. The number of G/RGO layers applied on the fabrics has been also indicated in Table 1 when available.

As explained previously, the reductant has also a marked influence on the conductivity obtained. Shateri-Khalilabad and Yazdanshenas38 coated cotton fabrics with GO and studied the effect of the reductant employed on the conductivity of RGO/cotton fabrics obtained. The reduction time is also important and it is a parameter that should be optimized when obtaining RGO coatings from GO since it depends on the type of reductant employed as well as the synthesis conditions. In this sense, Ha et al.49 studied the reduction process of RGO deposited on PES and cotton fibers aided by BSA coating. Authors employed Raman spectroscopy to study the reduction of GO by HI and showed that the conducting pathways on the fibers are formed within the first minute of reduction. Thereafter, conductivity remains stable till 20 min of reduction, and beyond this time, a decrease of conductivity was observed, maybe due to the deposition of I− that could act as scattering centers for the current flow.
The most important parameters of conducting fabrics have been summarized in Table 1 (conductivity, sheet resistance, electrical resistance, etc.). However, some aspects of the papers dealing principally on conductivity will be summarized following (special synthesis methods, special properties or applications, etc.).
Yun et al.37 obtained conductive and colored nylon-6 yarns through dying RGO with rhodamine 6G. The conductivity of the fabrics only varied a 9% in the 220–325 K, which demonstrated its applicability for real-life applications. Woltornist et al.47 coated PET simulated leather fabrics with a mixture of FLG and graphite obtained by ultrasonication. The approach employed was a kinetic trapping method, which consisted in a mixture of n-heptane and water. Both are poor solvents for FLG and graphite and both accumulate in the interface between the two solvents, the exfoliation of graphite was also facilitated in this way by means of ultrasonication. When a hydrophilic surface was present, FLG/graphite deposited on its surface. Fabrics were placed in contact with the mixture and were ultrasonicated to allow the deposit of the coating, weight uptakes as high as 15% of graphitic material on the fabrics were achieved. Graphite tended to accumulate in the interstices between the fibers and FLG were deposited on the surface of the fibers.
Other methods employed for obtaining conductive yarns include wet transfer of monolayer G. Neves et al.42 synthesized monolayer G by CVD on Cu foil and transferred it to PP and PLA fibers by wet method to produce conductive and transparent coatings on the fibers (fibers were immobilized on a rigid PET support). The surface of the fibers was previously treated with ultraviolet-ozone treatment to remove impurities from the surface of the fibers and produced a more uniform surface that promoted G adhesion.
Due to the resistive response of G conducting fabrics, they have been tested as electrothermal materials. The temperature of the fabrics can be tuned by varying the potential and shows applicability for heating garments (for instance for maintaining the body temperature of patients, etc.).50 Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the temperature of RGO–PU/PET fabrics depending on the applied potential.

Molina et al. published different works43–45 in which PES fabrics were coated with RGO and they performed a complete electrical and electrochemical characterization of these materials with non-traditionally employed techniques for the characterization of these materials such as: cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or scanning electrochemical microscopy. The RGO coatings demonstrated to be electroactive and were homogeneously distributed on the surface of the fabrics. In their electrochemical characterization using scanning electrochemical microscopy, its amphoteric behavior was observed. The RGO coatings could act either as a reductant or as an oxidant.44 In cyclic voltammetry characterization, only low scan rates allowed the observation of RGO redox processes due to the resistive nature of the coatings, composed of lots of RGO sheets that allowed the electrical flow through the fabric.
Hsiao et al.51 coated PU fiber mats, obtained by electrospinning, with GO, later GO was converted to RGO with hydriodic acid as the reducing agent. Electrical conduction of the fiber mats was further improved with the deposition of thiophenol-modified AgNPs. Fig. 8 shows a schematic representation of the production process, in which the functional groups of GO bonded with the functional groups of PU nanofibers by means of hydrogen bonding. AgNPs were fixed due to π–π interaction between RGO and thiophenol-modified AgNPs. Fig. 9a shows the PU nanofibers, and after GO deposition it can be seen that all the voids between the nanofibers were coated with GO (Fig. 9b). Fig. 9c show the cross section of the GO/PU nanocomposite. Fig. 9d and Fig. 9e show the surface and cross section of the RGO/PU composite, respectively.

Hybrid conducting materials consisting of GO and a conducting polymer were reported by Molina et al.,41 who deposited PPy/GO hybrid material on PES fabrics by means of chemical oxidation of pyrrole/GO solution by FeCl3. Different GO contents were employed (10, 20 and 30% wt respect to pyrrole mass) to study the effect on the conductivity. During the polymerization, GO acted as a counter ion (negative charge) to neutralize the positive charges created in the structure of PPy (polarons and bipolarons). When PPy/GO was deposited, the fabric became conductive (177 Ω per square, for 10% wt GO content). When the GO content increased, the surface resistivity also increased slightly. An excessive amount of GO, increased electrical resistance due to its insulating nature. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements showed a decrease of the doping level of the polymer (N+/N) as the GO content increased, in accordance with the surface resistivity results. GO as counter ion has the advantage of its high size (between hundreds of nm and several µm) when compared with traditional organic counter ions, and cannot be expulsed from the PPy structure due to dedoping. Due to the immobilization of GO inside the polymer structure, cations would migrate to produce the compensation of charges inside PPy.

2.2.4. Thermally conductive fabrics and flame retardant fabrics. G is also known for its high thermal conductivity,17 as high as 3000 W m K−1. In this way, Abbas et al.52 coated cotton fabrics with G to increase its thermal conductivity. This could be useful for the production of summer clothing that allows the rapid dissipation of heat. It is also important to increase the hydrophilicity of the fabrics, which allows sweat to not accumulate, thus allowing heat dissipation. The increase of the thermal conductivity was due to the presence of G which is a good thermal conductor and it was also related to the concentration of the filler. In addition, the reduction of the air permeability of the fabrics (lower porosity) also enhanced the thermal conductivity of the fabrics. When comparing with other thermal conducting fillers (MWCNTs and BN), better results were obtained with G. Authors also performed dyeing of the conductive fabrics with different colors and different filler contents to see the effect of the fillers on the final color of the fabric. The thermal conductivity provided by RGO also minimized resistive heating and allowed stable field emission in field emission devices.68 Hu et al.31 also observed the increase in the thermal conductivity of cotton fabrics when coated with GNPs.Graphene derivatives have been also employed as flame-retardant fillers to produce fabrics with more thermal stability and flame retardant properties. Huang et al.53 coated cotton fabrics with intumescent flame retardant-polyacrylamide/GO by layer-by-layer assembly. An increase in the temperature of decomposition and the time of ignition was observed. Conversely, the heat release rate was diminished.

2.2.5. Photocatalytic fabrics, antibacterial and antifungal fabrics. GO and RGO coatings have shown photocatalytic activity on fabrics.55,58 Krishnamoorthy et al.55 coated cotton fabrics with GO to obtain photocatalytic and antibacterial fabrics. Photocatalytic activity was measured by measuring the photoreduction of resazurin (blue) to resorufin (pink) under UV irradiation. UV-light of energy 3.54 eV was irradiated on the fabric, which produced the creation of electron/hole pairs since the energy irradiated is higher than the GO bandgap (3.26 eV in this study). The electron reacted with the resazurin dye, which was reduced. Antibacterial activity was tested with Gram-positive (Streptococcus iniae) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli DH5α) bacteria, being more toxic to the former one. The antibacterial mechanism could involve direct contact (due to damaging produced by functional groups) and/or oxidative stress (produced by reactive oxygen species created by GO).Sahito et al.58 cationized a cotton fabric with BSA. With the BSA coating an increase of 67.74% of GO deposited was obtained when compared to bare cotton. Finally, GO was converted to RGO by hydrazine hydrate vapors. Electrical conductivity and photocatalytic activity in the degradation of a MB solution were improved with the BSA coating, due to the higher amount of RGO deposited. In addition the authors pointed out the possibility of employing the fabric in the future for textile-structured solar cells.
RGO-coated fabrics have been also employed as substrate materials onto which TiO2 NPs have been deposited to obtain photocatalytic fabrics.54,56,57 Under irradiation, TiO2 NPs produce electrons and holes. Electrons combine with O2 and produce O2−, and the combination of holes and water generates hydroxyl radicals. These highly active oxygen generated species can oxidize organic pollutants. The efficiency of photocatalytic processes is determined by the electron/hole pair life, which is around 10−9 s for TiO2 alone.54 The time needed for chemical interaction with organic matter is in the 10−8 to 10−3 s order; therefore a decrease of the photocatalytic efficiency is observed. In this sense, G materials act as conducting materials and enable the effective electron/hole separation due to their conducting pathways. In this way, the lifetime of the electron/hole pair is increased, as does the photocatalytic efficiency of these materials. Other advantage is that G materials can also extend light absorption, acting as an electron donor to produce more O2− radical species. In addition, G materials can also act as adsorbents of organic matter, thus facilitating the contact between the photocatalytic material and the pollutants, organic matter, bacteria, etc.54
Karimi et al.54 coated cotton fabrics with GO and PU. Thereafter TiCl3 was added, and acted as a reductant of GO and at the same time, TiO2 NPs (8–13 nm) were formed due to the oxidation of Ti3+. Authors performed a series of experiments varying the GO and TiCl3 concentrations. The effect of these parameters on the photocatalytic efficiency (in the degradation of MB dye solution) was measured and optimized with a mathematical model. The modified fabrics were also employed as antimicrobial (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) and antifungal materials (Candida albicans). Cytotoxicity tests were performed and showed no hazard for health. In another article,56 the same authors published a similar study.
Molina et al.57 developed RGO-coated PES fabrics and coated them with commercial TiO2 NPs. An increase in the number of RGO coatings applied, produced an increase of the conductivity and a decrease of the charge transfer resistance of the fabrics in solution. Consequently, an increase in the photocatalytic efficiency (in rhodamine B degradation) was also observed.

2.2.6. Fabric sensors. Taking advantage of their high surface area and conductivity, G coated fabrics/fibers have been also employed as sensors for different purposes: electrodes for heart rate monitoring,59 strain sensor,60 H2O2 sensor,61 glucose sensor,61 NO2 gas sensor,62 and acetone and methanol sensor.63Yapici et al.59 coated nylon fabrics with RGO to produce electrodes for obtaining electrocardiograms. The performance of these electrodes was very similar to the conventional electrodes employed for such purpose and presented several advantages over traditional electrodes (Ag/AgCl) such as: they alleviate the need for gel, provide comfort, wearability, reusability and easy integration in personal clothing.
Gan et al.60 coated cotton fabrics with GNRs obtained from MWCNTs unzipping by strong oxidants. Bending, stress–strain and washing experiments showed no significant degradation of the conductivity of the fabrics. A linear dependence of the resistance on the strain was observed when elongation was lower than 20%, indicating that the fabric could be employed as a strain sensor in smart textiles. GWFs have been more widely applied for this purpose due to their higher sensitivity as will be seen in Section 2.4.1.
Liang et al.61 coated silk fiber mats with GO via vacuum filtration. Later GO was reduced to RGO chemically. The morphology of the composite showed a loose structure on the top of the film and a compact structure at the bottom of the film, due to the accumulation of RGO sheets. The porous structure helped to the diffusion of analytes to the electrode. The composite material also showed capacitive properties due to the high surface area of the silk/RGO composite. Thereafter, PtNPs were deposited on the RGO/silk fiber mats via CV electrodeposition, a spiky structure in the form of flowers was obtained (Fig. 10a and b). Fig. 10c shows the EDX analysis which corroborates the presence of PtNPs on the surface of the fibers. The modified fibers were employed as electrode materials for H2O2 sensing (Fig. 10d). H2O2 is a by-product of many analyte-specific enzymes, as well as a known brain neuromodulator. After modification with glucose oxidase enzyme, the conducting fibers were also employed as glucose sensing material that could be employed for diabetes diagnosis.

Yun et al.62 coated cotton and PES fibers with BSA to facilitate GO adsorption. After chemical reduction, the conductive fibers were embroidered in commercial fabrics and employed as gas sensors. The obtained sensors were 3-fold more sensitive to NO2 than when obtained in the form of flat RGO films, which can be attributed to the high surface area of the yarns. When exposed to NO2 as an oxidizing gas, the resistance of the RGO sensor decreased owing to the increased hole concentration resulting in the negative sign of the response. Washing and bending (1000 tests) did not affect the performance of the fibers and provided a constant response for 7 days monitoring (0.13% variation). Ethanol, ethylene, acetone, and CO2 gases in 10-fold concentrations did not cause interference in the NO2 determination.
Skrzetuska et al.63 coated cotton fabrics with G pellets (23 nm of thickness, 68 G layers on average) and MWCNTs by screen printing technique and the developed fabrics were employed as gas sensors. The change in the electrical resistance of the fabrics when exposed to different vapor gases was employed as an indication of the gas concentration. Methanol and acetone gases were employed to test the sensing properties of the screen printed electrodes, being more sensitive to methanol than towards acetone. The differences could be attributed to differences in the dipole moment, which is lower in the case of methanol (1.61 D vs. 2.91 D for acetone).

2.2.7. Electrocatalytic materials. G materials are also electrochemically active and have been employed for producing fabric electrodes for different electrochemical applications such as anodes for microbial fuel cells,64 cathodes in dye sensitized solar cells,65 cathode membranes for dye degradation,66 or photoelectrode materials.74Liu et al.64 deposited electrochemically ERGO on carbon cloth. The fabrics were employed as anode materials for a Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediatorless microbial fuel cell. ERGO promoted the growth of bacteria growth due to its biocompatibility and enhanced electron transfer rate due to two mechanisms: direct electron transfer and through cell-excreted mediator-enabled electron transfer pathways. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces pyocyanin, phenazine-1-carboxamide or phenazine-1-carboxylic acid that can function as redox mediators for the transfer of electrons between the bacteria and the anode electrode. The ERGO modification improved power density and energy conversion by 2.7 and 3 times, respectively.
Sahito et al.65 obtained RGO coated fabrics and employed them as counter electrode in dye sensitized solar cells. The counter electrode in this type of cells is usually coated with Pt to increase its electroactivity, the counter electrode with RGO is Pt free and hence it is cheaper. The energy conversion efficiency obtained with the RGO/cotton fabric was lower than that obtained with Pt counter electrode. However, there are several advantages with this type of electrodes, such as: the low cost, the simple production method, flexibility and biodegradability of the materials, which make this type of electrodes promising candidates for future technology of textile structured solar cells.
Zhao et al.66 developed PPy/RGO coated PES filter cloth membranes and employed them at the same time as membrane and cathode material. AQSA was employed as a dopant to improve the conductivity of the membrane and the generation of radicals. The filtration effect enhanced the contact between the membrane and the pollutants. The membrane was employed in an electro-Fenton system to degrade an organic pollutant (MB). H2O2 was produced on the cathode through O2 reduction, which reacted with Fe2+ to produce hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals that were responsible for oxidizing organic matter. Hydroxyl radicals could also be directly produced on the cathode. RGO acted as an effective bridge between PPy and the catalyst.
Tian et al.74 wrapped CNT fibers with GO by means of π–π interaction, and later reduced to RGO. TiO2 was also deposited by CVD to produce photoelectrode materials. When depositing TiO2/RGO on CNTs, the photocurrents obtained were multiplied by a 5 factor when compared with TiO2/CNTs (132 vs. 25 µA cm−2). This was due to the deposition of more TiO2 NPs and the creation of donor–acceptor interfaces due to tight binding between RGO and TiO2 NPs.

2.2.8. Field emission fabrics. The use of G-coated fabrics has been even reported in field emission devices. Roy et al.67 deposited RGO and CNTs on carbon cloth/PET substrate for increasing field emission for flexible device applications. A decrease in the turn-on field and in the current density at the threshold field was observed and it was due to an enhanced edge effect of RGO caused by the synergy between RGO and CNTs. Maiti et al.68 carried out a similar study for the same application. In this study, RGO was deposited on carbon cloth and was etched with plasma to produce G nanocones that acted as cold electron emitters. The effect of the time of plasma etching was studied, obtaining the best results with 3 min etching. The thermal conductivity of G minimized resistive heating and allowed stable emission. As examples of application authors pointed out rolled-up field emission displays, bendable X-ray generators, etc.
2.2.9. Capacitors and energy storage. Carbon materials are of interest for the production of capacitors since their high surface area allow them to adsorb more electrolyte ions, which increases the double layer capacitance. In this sense, G and derivatives have a high surface area (2630 m2 g−1)20 which make them ideal candidates for such purpose. In addition, their conductivity enhances the performance of the capacitors and reduces their internal resistance, thus improving the rate performance. This is why the use of G derivatives for supercapacitors is on the increase. The same happens in the field of fabrics, where the applications of G materials allows to obtain flexible supercapacitors.61,69–85 Fig. 11 displays a diagram showing the double layer capacitive performance of a carbon fiber electrode before and after ERGO deposit. An increase in the surface area allows the material to adsorb more ions. Fabric supercapacitors have also the advantage that they are highly porous and facilitate electrolyte access. However, the capacitance obtained by carbon materials is low and other pseudo-capacitive materials are usually added on top of them to increase their capacitance. These pseudo-capacitive materials include conducting polymers such as PPy,70,71,80,81,83 Pani,74,85 PEDOT,73 and metal oxides such as MnO2 (ref. 72, 73 and 83) or V2O5.75 The use of MWCNTs has also been reported to increase double layer capacitance and conductivity.75,81 The design of the supercapacitor has been studied as a key factor for enhancing the electrolyte-accessible surface area and increase the capacitance of the system when compared with traditional configurations.77 Following, the most interesting works related to G-based fabrics for supercapacitor applications will be briefly summarized.

Yaghoubidoust et al.70 coated cotton fabrics with GO and later with PPy obtained by chemical oxidation, obtaining a double layer coating. The previous GO deposit enhanced conductivity of the fabric, it should be taken into account that GO could be partially reduced to RGO during the oxidation process of pyrrole to PPy. Specific capacitance was also improved by the GO coating as measured by CV. Xu et al.71 employed a similar approach, however in this case authors reduced GO to RGO to obtain more conductive coatings. Although the presence of RGO produced a thinner PPy coating (1.5 mg cm−2 vs. 6 mg cm−2), the capacitance was higher in the case of PPy/RGO coating. This can be attributed to a higher surface area, yielding increased electrode/electrolyte interface areas. In addition, RGO formed a conducting layer below the PPy layer, which facilitated the electron transfer between RGO and PPy. The presence of RGO coating stabilized PPy and increased its cycling stability due to the interaction between RGO and PPy (π–π interaction) which limited the swelling and shrinking of the PPy coating. A similar effect of stabilization of the conducting polymers has been observed by other authors.85 Zhao et al.80 coated nylon-lycra fabrics with RGO and later a PPy film was also deposited on the surface of the fabrics. In this case, the capacitive performance was even better under 50% stretching, since strain allowed a better contact between RGO sheets.
Liu et al.81 coated PES non-woven fabrics with RGO, PPy and MWCNTs and studied its performance as supercapacitor material. A synergistic effect was observed among all the components of the flexible fabric. The presence of RGO increased the surface area of PPy, and MWCNTs increased the conductivity, high rate performance and the stability.
Yu et al.85 deposited Pani nanowires array coating on nitrogen-doped carbon fiber cloth. Thereafter RGO was deposited on top of the Pani coating to buffer the volume change of Pani that suffers in the oxidation/reduction process, which contributed to enhance the long term stability of the supercapacitor. Strong π–π interaction allowed good electron transfer between Pani and the basal plane of RGO. Nanostructured Pani allowed a high electrode/electrolyte interface area and short diffusion lengths, and RGO decreased the internal resistance of the electrode.
Huang et al.83 deposited RGO, MnO2 and PPy successively on the surface of stainless steel fibers. The obtained fibers could be knitted into fabrics for wearable energy storage textiles. RGO improved charge transfer with MnO2 and increased capacitance. MnO2 contributed to the pseudocapacitance and PPy improved electron transfer and also participated in the pseudocapacitive charge storage. The yarns could be assembled in series and in parallel to meet the voltage and current requirements in real applications. In addition, the yarns could be knitted into patterns without loosing their properties.
Yu et al.72,73 published two works in which they coated fabrics with GNS/MnO2 coatings. Fabrics were previously coated with exfoliated GNS and after this, electrochemical deposition of MnO2 was performed. Materials with high specific capacitance were obtained (315 F g−1). MnO2 was employed as a typical active pseudocapacitive material which uses fast and reversible redox reactions at the surface of electroactive materials. GNS acted as a conductor that facilitated the electrochemical synthesis of MnO2NPs and facilitated fast electron transport between GNS and MnO2NPs. The morphology of the MnO2NPs (flower-like) enhanced the surface area and reduced ion diffusion length during charging/discharging. In addition, GNS acted as a double layer capacitor, accumulating electrical charges arising from ion absorption (double layer capacitance). In another work, authors employed a conductive wrapping of PEDOT/PSS or SWCNTs on the GNS–MnO2/PES fabrics.73 This wrapping further increased the specific capacitance (till 380 F g−1) and the rate capability, which can be attributed to shorter ion diffusion path and increased electronic conductivity. The additional conductive wrapping created a new electron transport path and also participated in increasing the capacitance through double layer capacitance (SWCNTs) or pseudocapacitance (PEDOT).
Shakier et al.75 obtained supercapacitor electrodes based on layer-by-layer assembly of G layers acting as conductive spacers between layers of V2O5 coated-MWCNTs. The G coatings provided an extra conductive pathway, avoided the agglomeration of MWCNTs and enhanced the specific capacitance by a 67%, till values as high as 2590 F g−1. Electrodes stored charge through electric double layer capacitance (MWCNTs) and through pseudocapacitive mechanism (V2O5). The optimal thickness of the V2O5 coating on MWCNTs was 3 nm, a higher thickness decreased the ratio of utilization, which decreased the specific capacitance.
Wang et al.76 employed nanofabrics of electrospun polyamide coated with RGO to produce supercapacitive materials. The nanofabrics increased the surface area of the fabric and avoided the aggregation of RGO, thus being advantageous when compared to microfabrics (capacitance when employing nanofabrics was 4.4 times higher than with microfabrics). GO with different sizes were coated on the fabrics to study the influence of this parameter on the capacitive behavior (diameters: <200 nm (S), 200–450 nm (M), >450 nm (L)). GO was fixed on polyamide through hydrogen bonding between GO functional groups and the amide groups of polyamide 66. The optimal size of GO nanosheets was 200–450 nm, because they had a size that could wrap the fibers and maintained the pores of the fabric. The lowest size (<200 nm) did not produce proper coatings due to an incomplete coverage of the fibers, and the highest size (>450 nm) blocked the pores of the fabric due to the larger size of GO nanosheets. Medium size GO nanosheets improved GO loading and fixation, surface area, conductivity and electrolyte could easily access, thus obtaining the highest capacitance values.

Ramadoss et al.79 coated carbon fabrics with GO and later reduced it to RGO by thermal treatment at low temperature. High values of specific capacitance were achieved (414 F g−1) and a good rate capability was also observed, which was attributed to a shorter diffusion path for electrolyte and electrons, a highly activated surface and improved electrical conductivity. Two pieces of the conducting fabric, were separated by filter paper separator and a flexible solid state supercapacitor was obtained employing a H3PO4/PVA gel as electrolyte. Bending did not cause significant change in its properties. 5 supercapacitors were mounted and charged, and they powered a LED for more than 15 minutes. A nanogenerator could also be integrated to harvest the energy from vibrational and mechanical deformation to charge the capacitor and this one supplied power to a photosensor. This demonstrates their application for wearable and portable devices.
Liu et al.84 coated cotton yarns with Ni by a polymer-assisted metal deposition method. Later ERGO was deposited by means of electrochemical methods and was further reduced with hydrazine. The fibers obtained showed high capacitance values and could be embroidered or weft due to the enhanced mechanical resistance provided by Ni coating. The fibers could be connected in series, in parallel or in a combination of both to meet operational voltage or power requirements.

2.3. Graphene woven fabrics
Another method that has been applied for the synthesis of G-based fabrics is the production of graphene woven fabrics.86–101 This method consists in growing G coating on a metallic mesh (normally Cu) by CVD (Fig. 13a).86 During the growth, Cu wires interconnect due to the high temperature employed in CVD growth (∼1000 °C). Thereafter, the Cu mesh is removed by FeCl3/HCl treatment and the G structure collapses (upper and lower part of the wires) to produce graphene micron-ribbons. The resulting structure has the form of the Cu mesh employed (Fig. 13b). Fig. 13c shows a photograph of the resulting GFWs structure. Fig. 13d shows a TEM micrograph and the diffraction pattern which shows a hexagonal symmetry. Two sets of the hexagonal spots can be observed with a rotation of 26° between them. This is due that the two sides of the GWF that collapsed are analyzed at the same time. The GWF structure obtained is polycrystalline with several G layers and surface wrinkles are present. The sheet resistance of GWFs can be tuned by varying the coverage of G by simply varying the parameters of the supporting Cu mesh (width of wires and distance between wires). Table 2 shows a compilation of the works that have dealt with GWFs and their applications.

2.4. Applications of graphene woven fabrics
2.4.1. Sensors for strain, torsion, movement, acoustic, pulse, monitoring etc. GWFs have been widely employed for the production of strain sensors due to the high sensitivity of their structure to deformation. Li et al.86 coated GWFs with PDMS to produce composites that were employed as strain sensors. The sensors were more sensitive when the strain was applied in the direction of the fibers (x direction) rather than when a combined stress was applied (x and y directions) (Fig. 14a). The strain range was limited to 5% to avoid irreversible tensile strain that provoked breakage of the G structure. Under this limit, the sensor was reversible (Fig. 14b). Fig. 14c shows the application of the sensor for monitoring the movement of a finger.

(b) Electromechanical properties of the GWF/PDMS films. Resistance change relative to the original value (ΔR/R0) recorded for a number of cycles at tensile strains of 2% and 5%.

In another work,87 the same authors performed a similar study and explained the mechanism underlying for such good performance of GWFs as strain sensors. Under strain, cracks in the structure begin to form at weak points. The crack length and crack density propagate with the increasing strain (Fig. 15). After removing the external force, the cracks disappear and the fractured GWF recovers to its initial position since it is stuck to PDMS substrate. These cracks are responsible for the change in resistance of the sensor. In this paper, very high gauge factors for GWF/PDMS were reported (106 for strain > 7%). The sensors were also employed for compression, torsion and shearing strain sensing, although the response was much lower than when employed for strain monitoring.

Wang et al.88 applied bio-inspired Voronoi polycrystalline micromechanics model and experimental validations to explain such high gauge factors. It was demonstrated that the successive cracking, the “fish-scale” like network structure of GWFs (overlapping of G crystals on the grain boundary), and the superlubricity between overlapped G flakes play a crucial paper.
Lee et al.89 produced piezoresistors by assembling GWF on PDMS where Ti–Au electrodes had been previously deposited (round and band type) to produce touch sensors.
The method employed for producing GWFs has also been employed for producting G fibers by Wang et al.90 The G fibers were coated with PVA to produce protected conducting fibers that were mounted on PDMS film to construct a strain sensor.
Yang et al.91 employed GWFs as strain sensors for human monitoring (human skin movement, pulse, jugular venous pressure, body movement), acoustic signal acquisition, and spatially resolved monitoring of external stress distribution. Thicker G coatings produced GWFs with a larger stretching range (>20%), however sensitivity was sacrificed (lower gauge factors). The higher stretching limit would allow to employ these sensors for monitoring activities such as walking, running and grasping. Wang et al.92 applied GWFs for similar body motion monitoring (clenching, phonation, expression change, blink, breath, and pulse). Authors pointed out applications such as lie detectors based on muscle deformation amplitude, or evaluation of the degree of fatigue by measuring the frequency and amplitude of the blinks, etc.
Torsion sensors have also been reported by Yang et al.,93 obtained by wrapping GWF/PDMS around a PDMS rod and applying torsion to the polymeric rod. Differences were observed when pre-stretching to the PDMS film was applied or not. When applying a 20% pre-stretching, the sensor could withstand torsions of up to 800 rad m−1 because waving of the GWFs was avoided and their tolerance to high strains was improved. Lower pre-tensions favoured the sensitivity due to a large gauge factor. The sensor could discriminate among forward and backward torsion by the change in resistance and the response was not dependent on the frequency of the applied load.
Wang et al.94 employed GWFs for sound signal acquisition and recognition. The sensor, which was very sensitive to tiny strains and vibrations, was located on a human throat and it was employed to register the muscular movement/vibration. It was used for collecting and recognizing the 26 english letters, some typical Chinese characters, phrases and animal sounds. The waveforms were specific of each letter and showed similar key features when performed by different people. The same signal wave forms were obtained without vocalization, which could help patients with problems in vocalization. In addition, authors pointed out the employment of these sensors in earthquake monitoring, animal communication and robotic voice development. The sensor was also employed to perform measurements with a loudspeaker, where the sensor was located on the loudspeaker membrane. The audio frequency and the collected signal had a matching synchronization.

2.4.2. Solar cells. GWFs have been also employed in solar cells, where GWF functioned as the transparent electrode in Schottky junction with Si to allow enhanced photovoltaic conversion.86 In addition, GWF allowed electron/hole separation and hole transport, while electrons were driven into silicon, which allowed the production of electricity. Different additives were employed to improve solar energy conversion (HNO3, PEDOT and HBr/Br2 redox mediator). Kang et al.95 deposited PtNPs on GWFs for producing hybrid Schottky junctions and photoelectrochemical solar cells. The deposition of Pt increased the work function of GWFs and reduced the sheet resistance. The optical pathlength was also increased by PtNPs absorption of light and more carriers were photogenerated. However, an excessive amount of PtNPs was detrimental since it hindered light transmittance. Fig. 16 shows a scheme of the solar cell configuration (Fig. 16a), as well as the synthesis of PtNPs (Fig. 16b) and the final cell configuration with PtNPs (Fig. 16c). The presence of PtNPs improved the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current density. Photoexcited charge carriers generated in n-Si were separated by the built-in field, electrons were directed to the n-Si region and holes moved towards GWF. The solid electrolyte, acted as a redox mediator and holes were captured by NO3− that diffused to the GWF and was reduced again to NO3−. This redox reaction forms a photoelectrochemical channel for hole carriers. Both effects were synergistic and contributed to enhance the power conversion efficiency. In addition, the solid electrolyte acted as an anti-reflection layer and as a chemical carrier.

2.4.3. Electromagnetic shielding. Han et al.96 employed the GWFs for obtaining IR transparent and conducting materials that were applied for electromagnetic shielding. The influence of square aperture and wire width of the mesh on the optical transmittance, electromagnetic shielding and conductivity was evaluated. An increase in the square aperture caused an increase of the transmittance, however conductivity and electromagnetic shielding followed the inverse trend. The thickness of the ribbons was around 6 nm, and 12 nm in the intersections. The dominant shielding mechanism of GWFs was microwave absorption to electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range of 9.2–15 GHz. The high surface area of GWFs caused multiple reflections of the radiation in the GWFs that enhanced its absorption.
2.4.4. Supercapacitive materials. GWFs have been also employed as flexible supercapacitive materials, alone97,98 or combined with pseudocapacitive materials such as MnO2 (ref. 98) or Pani.99,100Zang et al.97 obtained GWFs and deposited them on different substrates (polishing cloth, polyethylene, PET and filter paper) and studied their capacitive behavior. Supercapacitors with very low thickness (<1 mm) were mounted with PVA–H3PO4 as polymer gel electrolyte and the best results were obtained on polishing cloth. Deformation of the devices (fold, twist, knead, and curl) increased capacitance due to a better contact between the electrode and the gel electrolyte. Therefore, the supercapacitors could be shaped into different forms without loss in their capacitance.
Li et al.98 obtained GWFs composed of G layers and porous carbon on the core, hence integrating the conductivity of G and the porous characteristics of porous carbon. Depending on the synthesis conditions and cooling rate, the composition of the material could be adjusted. Thinner multilayer G films provided a larger specific surface area and voids for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. Thicker deposits provided a better skeleton structure to be filled with other functional materials. The mean pore size of the material was in the 2–3 nm range, favouring the formation of an electrical double layer. N-doping enhanced the pseudocapacitive effect and improved the specific capacitance by a 150%. Capacitance could be further increased depositing other materials such as MnO2 on the surface of the GWFs.
Zang et al.99 coated GWFs with Pani obtained by potentiostatic deposition and employed the Pani/GWFs composite as supercapacitor material. GWF acted as support material onto which Pani could be deposited and also as a current collector for capacitance measurements. In addition, GWFs also acted as a double layer capacitor and Pani acted as a pseudo-capacitive material. The presence of Pani improved greatly the capacitance of GWFs (from 2 mF cm−2 to 23 mF cm−2) (Fig. 17). The supercapacitor showed great stability after 2000 cycles with no appreciable loss of capacitance (Fig. 17e); what is more, bending and curling even improved the areal capacitance since a better contact between the polymer gel electrolyte and the electrode was favored.

In another study,100 the same authors employed the same approach to produce supercapacitors and tested the static and dynamic performance under strain. The GWFs were assembled on pre-stretched polymer substrates in order to improve flexibility and enlarge the strain range of the supercapacitors. Till a 30% strain, no change in the capacitance was observed. Pani was also electropolymerized on GWFs as explained previously in order to increase capacitance.99 No change in the capacitance was neither observed till a 30% strain. According to this, the maximum strain for the dynamic tests was restricted to 30%. The supercapacitors could withstand high rates of dynamic stretching (60%/s, strain frequency 1 Hz). The GWFs increased the surface area and the robustness, being more suitable for dynamic stretching deformation.

2.4.5. Mechanical properties. GWFs also confer enhanced mechanical strength. Liu et al.101 reinforced epoxy resin with GWF, the mechanical properties of epoxy resin were improved by the presence of GWF. When the force was applied at 45° respect the direction of the fibers, the composite had better mechanical properties than when it was applied at 0°. In the latter case, only the fibers that are parallel to the force play a role in mechanical resistance. On the other hand, at 45°, both the weave and weft of the GWF make a contribution towards the improvement of its mechanical properties. Zhang et al.102 performed an interesting analysis of the mechanical properties and behavior of GWFs by computational modelling. Authors provided guidelines for the theoretical mechanical analysis of GWFs and concluded that the mechanical properties of GWFs can be adjusted by varying the weave density.
3. Conclusions and perspectives
Textile fabrics present different advantages when compared with sheet materials, such as their high surface area, flexibility, mechanical properties, etc., which make them attractive substrates onto which other functional materials can be deposited. On the other hand, graphene (G) and related materials have emerged as a revolutionary material in the field of materials science and physics due to their extraordinary properties. G materials provide a conductive platform that can be integrated into textiles by means of chemical deposition, by producing graphene woven fabrics (GWFs) or by integrating conductive fibers of G in the fabrics. A lot of work has been performed with G-based fibers and there are several reviews that deal with this topic.21–24 For this reason, this subject has not been included in the present review. The present review is focused on the chemical deposition of G materials on fabrics/yarns and the synthesis of GWFs and their applications.
The chemical method is simple and can be scaled up by means of traditional techniques employed in textile industry such as soaking, drying, reducing with chemical compounds, etc. Graphene oxide (GO) is employed as the main G source since it is cheap and it can be produced in great quantities and for the moment is the only G derivative that could meet the large requirements of G for textile industry if this technology were to be established. GO is simply adsorbed on the surface of the fabrics by means of chemical interactions (electrostatic, hydrogen bonds, π–π interactions, etc.). GO is an insulating material, however, its conductivity is partially restored by means of chemical, thermal, electrochemical or UV reduction to produce reduced graphene oxide (RGO). However, the conductivity obtained with this procedure is lower than in the case of GWFs since RGO retains some degree of oxidation (functional groups) after reduction. The applications of these type of fabrics (composed only of G or with other functional materials) can be: UV protection, conducting fabrics, antistatic fabrics, IR emission, hydrophobicity, sensors for electrocardiogram acquisition, heat generation, thermal conduction, photocatalytic activity, electrocatalytic activity, antibacterial, antifungal, gas and liquid sensors, anode for microbial fuel cells, cathode for solar cells, field emission devices, capacitive materials for energy storage, etc.
With the GWFs, higher conductivity is obtained, however the synthesis route consists in chemical vapor deposition on a Cu mesh (most widely metal employed as substrate), the subsequent removal of the copper mesh by chemical dissolution and the transfer of the remaining G mesh to a substrate to support it. The GWFs are composed of several G layers with polycrystalline nature. Due to the high conductivity obtained, this method could be employed for applications where high conductivity is needed, being sensors one of the main uses of this type of textile structures. The high sensitivity of these fabrics as strain sensors, as demonstrated by their very high gauge factors, opens the door to new applications such as voice recognition, movement sensors, breath and pulse sensors, etc.
Regarding future developments, more effort should be devoted to increasing the adhesion of G/GO/RGO coatings. In the case of GO, given the negative charges of GO due to the presence of oxygen containing functional groups, cationization of the surface of the fabrics should be accomplished. This has been mainly attained by means of chemical compounds (already under investigation, being bovine serum albumin coatings the most employed).
The development in the area of energy applications will certainly be explored in more depth in the future and more applications will be envisaged. These applications include flexible supercapacitors composed of G alone or combined with other capacitive materials, their development will allow the implementation of electronic textiles with different functionalities. Other type of materials or devices that harvest energy from body temperature (thermoelectric materials) or body movement could also be integrated taking advantage of G thermal and electrical conductivity. The applications of G as electrode material for energy applications also include Li-ion batteries, Li–sulphur batteries, Li air/oxygen batteries, fuel cells, microbial fuel cells, enzymatic fuel cells or solar cells for example.103,104 Some of them have already been reported for G-based fabrics and other will be explored shortly.
The application of semiconducting nanoparticles on G fabrics should be studied in more depth, since mainly TiO2 nanoparticles have been applied for the moment.54,56,57,74 With the functionalization by other semiconductors, G fabrics could be employed as photocatalytic materials or could be integrated in solar cells to increase the energy conversion efficiency.61,87,95 Given its organic nature, the modification with organic dyes can be easily achieved through π–π interactions or hydrophobic interactions,105 and can be used as an approach to increase the bandwidth energy absorbance of G materials, which mainly absorb radiation in the UV-region, to visible regions where dyes absorb.106 This approach would also led to an increase in the energy conversion efficiency in solar cells.
Another area of research not covered by bibliography up to date is the employment of modified G materials such as nitrogen-doped G,107–109 metallic doped G110 that have been applied for the fields of sensors, catalysis, etc. The application of other 2-D materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides should also be subject of future study due to their interesting properties.111–114
Another possibility pointed out in bibliography is the production of bionic materials integrating nanomaterials (such as G or carbon nanotubes) on natural fibers (for example on silk produced by spiders).115
