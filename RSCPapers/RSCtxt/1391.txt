    , Accepted 3rd May 2019First published on 4th May 2019AbstractThe ability to develop novel nanomaterials, and to precisely manufacture their functional structures at the nano- and microscales would benefit many emerging device applications. Herein, as a first example, we describe the exploration of feasibility for the morphological replacement of an iron-based MOF bearing trimeric FeIII–O clusters, MIL-88A preform, with a polyhedral architecture of around 0.4 × 1.2 μm by a lithium ferrite (LiFe3O5) phase via solid–liquid pseudomorphic transformation reactions in biologically and environmentally favourable aqueous lithium hydroxide (LiOH). The reaction proceeds at 170 °C, and the overall reaction can be described as Fe3O(H2O)2(FMA)3(OH)·nH2O (MIL-88A) + 7OH− + Li+ → LiFe3O5 + 3FMA2− + (n + 6) H2O (FMA = fumarate). It was proposed that through the coordination substitution of a MOF ligand by OH−, follow-up dehydration and dehydroxylation, and final H+/Li+ ionic exchange, the monolithiated iron oxides formed thermodynamically at comparatively low temperatures, which transcribe the global nanostructure morphologies of the polyhedral MOF preforms with the hexagonal symmetry, but were composed of interconnected LiFe3O5 particles (about 16 nm) that crystallize in a typical magnetite-type cubic (Fdm) structure. Given the characteristic texture and structure of the Li–Fe oxide replica, cubic LiFe3O5 was preferentially employed as a new type of electrode material in rechargeable lithium cells. Notably, from the electrochemical evaluation, this metal oxide system exhibits decent anodic performances by undergoing a nine-electron conversion reaction, showing a substantially high specific capacity with an average potential of 0.8 V versus lithium metal, a long service life (700 cycles), and exceptional high-rate capability (up to 2.0 A g−1). The synthetic paradigms demonstrated that the MIL-88A to LiFe3O5 conversion may be transferable to other advanced inorganic-based electrodes from the parent metal compound such as LiFeO2, LiMn2O4 or LiCoO2 toward sustainable energy fields.
Introduction
Concerns about the shortage of fossil fuels and the surge in environmental pollution prompt the effort to explore green natural resources, e.g., solar, wind and tidal powers.1 Considering that they are intermittent and localized, effectively storing energy from these sources, especially during a peak period, is vital prior to proper use and transportation.1 As such, energy storage naturally becomes currently a widely discussed topic in our society, and has received worldwide attention.1 Among various forms of energy systems, “rocking-chair” Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are acknowledged to be the most promising alternatives due to their high round-trip energy density efficiency (typically exceeding 90%, except at the highest power densities).2 Since their birth in 1991, LIBs have been the dominant energy supplies for portable digital products such as cell phones and laptops.2,3 The development of LIBs is inadequate, however, to meet the burgeoning demand for energy, especially the emergent electric vehicles and smart grids. A further breakthrough in LIB applications requires the boost of specific capacities of the electrode materials.2,3 With respect to the anode side, which serves as an important component for LIBs, the available reversible capacities of the state-of-the-art negative-plate materials are normally limited to 372 mA h g−1 and 175 mA h g−1 for commercially available graphitic carbon and lithium titanates (Li4Ti5O12) respectively associated with finite inserted Li+ in the host lattice, thus bringing about a bottleneck for further breakthroughs in LIB performance. Intensive research has been conducted to search for viable, low-cost substitutes for anodes.2,3
Strikingly, conversion-type transition-metal compounds (CTTMCs) with diverse anionic species (e.g., oxides, sulfides, selenides, fluorides, nitrides, phosphides, and so forth) are capable of providing multielectron reactions (hosting Li+ ions to generate lithium salt/M followed by the more or less reversible oxidation of M to CTTMCs, or a slightly different one) compared to the traditional intercalation-type anodes, and hence multiple times higher capacity values.3–6 Nevertheless, the widespread implementation of these conversion anodes has been severely hindered by the relatively extensive volume expansion (100%–200%) during replacement redox reactions between Li+ and transition-metal cations as well as poor intrinsic conductivity of solid bulk materials, eliciting the pulverization of electrode film and formidable kinetic problems.4–6 To make up for these two common deficiencies, researchers have recently focused on the design of multidimensional self-assembled structures, which was quickly proven fruitful as a nanoengineering strategy to promote the utilization, reaction kinetics, and robustness of electrode materials, as they combine the multiple benefits from low-dimensional building blocks, complex pore configurations and overall hierarchical configurations.4–6 To be more specific, the superiority of hierarchical nanostructures is reflected in three aspects:4–6 (1) the primary nanobuilding blocks can ensure short electron/Li+ solid-state diffusion lengths together with more electroactive sites relative to their large counterparts for fast charging, and in part relax the lattice stress/strain generated during a charge/discharge process for increased lifespan, (2) their structural stability is significantly enhanced since the nanosized components are integrated in a large and thermodynamically stable second architecture, lowering the risk of electrochemical agglomeration and interfacial side-reactions during electrode production and repeated cycling, and (3) the porous structures in the hierarchical architecture can simultaneously guarantee efficient impregnation of the electrolyte, sufficient channels for ion transport and enough specific surface area for active mass and electrolyte contact to enhance rate performance, and moreover function as “buffers” to rightly accommodate volume swing to enhance cycling performance.
Thanks to the significant advances made in this regard, to date, a vast array of hierarchical nanostructures of various CTAMs with certain geometric shapes have been fabricated primarily via a post-template thermolysis method,4–8 whereas from a synthesis perspective, the drawbacks of this method are the stringent calcination conditions (e.g., temperature and atmosphere), low reproducibility, excessive sintering and crystallite growth and/or high tendency of structural collapse that occurs during thermal degradation.4 Furthermore, these syntheses are cost-intensive and eco-hazardous processes due to the high temperature processing and release of highly harmful gases.4 In seeking to make a significant step forward to their practical applications, there is still a critical need for the identification of high-performance electrodes, and the development of more general, facile, inexpensive and green strategies that facilitate a greater control over material structuralization, before their practical applications become possible.
Among all the anodic conversion oxides mentioned above, iron-based materials like Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and especially lithium ferrite with structural diversity (e.g., LiFeO2, LiFe5O8 and Li5FeO4) are of particular interest by virtue of their environmental affinity, wide availability of raw materials and consequently low price, and high theoretical capacity (Fe2O3 = 1005 mA h g−1, Fe3O4 = 924 mA h g−1, LiFeO2 = 848 mA h g−1).9–11
In the present work, a hierarchical nanocrystalline cubic phase LiFe3O5, a new member in the lithium–iron oxide (LixFeyOz) family, with an internal porous structure and high surface-to-volume ratio has been fabricated from a pre-shaped dense MIL-88A polyhedron purely using a mild alkaline solution by versatile solid–liquid pseudomorphic transformation reactions, reactions which retain the architectural motif on the mesoscale while altering the chemical composition and structure on the molecular scale.12–16 Such soft chemical synthesis routes enable us to prepare novel materials, that are almost impossible to achieve with conventional routes of the elevated-temperature solid-state method.5,9,17 It is also emphasized that neither a high temperature special furnace is required nor are noxious gases liberated during synthesis, in contrast to conventional techniques,5,9,17,18 which greatly reduces the fabrication costs, saves energy and protects ecosystems. Significantly, the exceptional electrochemical performance of rechargeable Li cells employing the new pseudomorph is highlighted.
Results and discussion
Pseudomorphic synthesis of the cubic LiFe3O5 mesostructure
Briefly, the procedure by which we prepared the cubic pseudomorphs is composed of two steps, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (see the Experimental section† for details). It includes: (1) large-scale growth of polyhedron-shaped micrometric crystals of MIL-88A, through conventional hydrothermal synthesis, where no extra additives are applied, and (2) dispersion of the thus-obtained objects into a hot (170 °C) and static solution containing a large excess of LiOH (1.6 M), and then sealing it.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the pseudomorphic synthesis of the lithium ferrite solid structures. The sacrificial MIL-88(A)-based polyhedron is shaped in the first step through a common hydrothermal process. The inset figure shows the structure of MIL-88A, as viewed along the a axis (left) and the c axis (right), as well as one μ3-oxo-bridged trimeric unit that is built up of iron octahedra and a fumaric spacer (middle) (blue: Fe, red: O, gray: C; H has been omitted). 
The porous iron fumarate MIL-88A (Fe) (see the structure in Fig. 1) or Fe3O(H2O)2(O2C–C2H2–CO2)3(OH)·nH2O in this synthesis system is a highly flexible iron(III) dicarboxylate MOF of the well-known MIL-88 structure type,19–21 which is based on the oxo-centered trimers of metal(III) octahedra connected by a bidentate aliphatic or aromatic linear linker. This delimits a 6-connected acs net built up of trigonal bipyramidal cages (∼6 Å) of trimers between which 1D hexagonal-shaped channels (5–7 Å) are lying along the c-axis.19,22 By taking advantage of their remarkable structure peculiarity, which confer these MOFs unique reactivity, high catalytic activity, water stability, nontoxicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability, scientists continue to place a strong emphasis on their applications in fields as diverse as catalysis, adsorption, sensing, biomedicine, etc.19,21,22
As seen in Fig. 2a, all of the reflection peaks of these precursor materials could be unambiguously indexed in the hexagonal space group of MIL-88 as P2c, indicating that pure and well-crystallized products were obtained with MIL-88A topology.21–23 Note that there was little change for our pattern compared with the simulated results of MIL-88A synthesized under similar conditions. Such diversity has been described before and was caused by the differences in size, and pore opening as a consequence of their flexible structure and water absorption inside the pores.23 The absence of any linkages between the trimers within the (ab) plane is at the origin of the flexible character of these crystalline solids.19 The thermogravimetric (TG) curve clearly suggests that there was continuous weight loss (34.76%) at low temperatures (<290 °C), which was associated with physisorbed and metal coordinated water molecules in their matrix, including that evolved from the hydroxyl units (Fig. S1†). As the temperature further increases, the samples further undergo a sharp loss, corresponding to the decomposition of organics (FMA).23 The general scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, shown in Fig. 2b–d, announced a mono-disperse, homogeneous polyhedron, or rather hexagonal rod-like crystals (aspect ratio of 4.0) with an average length of about 1.2 μm and a gyration diameter of 300 nm. A close observation reveals that these elongated particles possessed smooth facets. Such high-quality crystals of MOFs with well-defined, special architecture are important toward the fabrication of anisotropic inorganic materials.

In the second step, the crystalline phases have been transformed from hexagonal MIL-88A to a phase with LiFe3O5 composition as confirmed by chemical analysis. The TG curves of the product tend to be smooth (Fig. S1†), indicating the total possible conversion of MIL-88A. This observation was supported by N2 adsorption–desorption measurement that displays the disappearance of microporosity, as will be discussed later. The characterization by power X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) (Fig. 3a) indicated that the LiFe3O5 phase belongs to a magnetite-type face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal system (classified as “inverse cubic spinel”) with the Fdm space group according to the JCPDS database.24 Complementary XPS analysis provides further information on the near surface chemistries of the magnetite-type compound LiFe3O5. In the wide XPS spectrum (Fig. S2†), only iron, lithium and oxygen elements were probed besides the reference C signal. In the high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 3b), two distinct peaks at binding energies of about 710.4 (Fe 2p3/2) and 724.1 eV (Fe 2p1/2), with their associated satellite peaks at 718.9 and 732.6 eV, respectively, are observed, which were characteristic of trivalent iron reported in iron oxides.25–277Li NMR spectra (Fig. S3†) acquired on a 14.1 T spectrometer show no signal at room temperature within the normal frequency range of common paramagnetic solids, revealing very strong hyperfine coupling due to the close proximity of Li to the magnetic Fe atoms in the ferromagnetic LiFe3O5.28 Meanwhile, the invisibility of any peaks around 0 ppm confirms the thorough rinsing of LiFe3O5 without any residual of Li salts (LiOH or lithium fumarate).29 The O 1s spectrum exhibits two peaks (Fig. 3c), the dominant peak at 529.8 eV corresponds to the lattice oxygen in LiFe3O5, whereas those at a higher binding energy of 531.5 eV are generally derived from adsorbed oxygen.25–27 In addition, the Fe 3p and Li 1s spectra were also recorded.

As a reference, the Powder Diffraction File (PDF) standard cards of pure cubic magnetite (ICDD card PDF file number 75-0449) are represented at the bottom of the figure. (b) Fe 2p, (c) O 1s and (d) Fe 3p/Li 1s photoelectron spectra of the product. 
However, as the binding energy for the Li 1s emission peak is very close to the Fe 3p peak near 55.8 eV,25 accurate determination of their binding energy was precluded because of the superposition. All the above-mentioned results corroborate the formation of high-purity LiFe3O5 without contamination after the chemical transformation of the iron fumarate MOF MIL-88A.
Based on our results and literature reports, we presumed that the chemical process that occurred in one pot in the course of this work should involve a sequence of solution mediated, progressive, simultaneous structural phase evolution, which could be rationalized as follows: after infiltrating into the interconnected porous network (or defects) in the MIL-88A crystals, competing OH− ions undergo exchange with a hydrophilic aliphatic linker, bridging fumarate in the iron coordination sphere as a monovalent capping ligand or counterion to form Fe3O(H2O)2(OH)7·nH2O, similar to ‘solvent assisted ligand exchange’.30 To obtain charge neutrality, two negative OH− ions per Fe3O unit are needed. (1)
The released linker in the basic digest solution was successfully monitored by means of the liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectrum (Fig. S4†). The observation also hints at the possible recycle of the FMA2− ligand to resynthesize MIL-88A, making this method more economic. It is important to note that MIL-88 frameworks are flexible and well known for their giant swelling effect (or breathing-like qualities/properties) as mentioned earlier. Such flexibility intrinsic in these solids, along with the contribution of cavities/acidity should be very favorable for the entrapment of guest species OH−, and incorporation into the MOF lattice.19,21,22 At relatively low temperatures, the metastable Fe3O(H2O)2(OH)7·nH2O mesophase may begin to decompose and lose water molecules from free and structure-bonded water, as well as hydroxyl successively to form a Fe3O4OH phase. (2)
In the as-generated aqueous LiOH/Fe3O4OH system, the protons in the non-equilibrium material, Fe3O4OH, in the reaction bath were considered to be replaced by Li+ ions via a hydrothermal H+/Li+ ion-exchange reaction,29,31,32 which results in exclusively the precisely stoichiometric LiFe3O5 formation. Fe3O4OH (s) + Li+ (aq) + OH− (aq) → LiFe3O5 (s) + H2O (l)(3)
In order to explore the H+/Li+ ionic exchange conditions, we performed a couple of experiments by changing the reaction conditions such as temperature, reaction duration, and the concentration of the alkali. The Li/Fe ratio was determined to be 0.101 and 0.042, respectively, for the reaction product obtained after a short time of 15 h at 170 °C and at lower temperatures of 150 °C for enough time, suggesting large amounts of residual H atoms in the powders. Chemical analysis of the reaction product synthesized with dilute synthesis media (0.8 M) revealed that Li/Fe = 0.214. The above results clearly show that the reaction required not only sufficient time for ionic exchange between H+ and Li+, but also reaction temperature (minimum of 170 °C) to facilitate the exchange kinetics,31,32 due to its nonspontaneous and endothermic nature.14,21 This may be explained by the stronger O–H interaction than that of O–Li. On the other hand, Kim et al. proposed that some binding sites for Li+ ions to occupy the host, FeOOH, only become available at higher pH.29 This explained the deviation of the Li/Fe ratio from 1/3 after dilution of the synthesis media.
According to the above discussion, the driving force of the overall reaction in this work can be ascribed to the entropic effect rather than the enthalpic change.14,21 The entropy driving forces for the final lithium ferrite formation mean the increased randomness with the proceeding of the reaction, which can be seen from the large quantities of dissociative FMA2− and water molecules removed from the starting material, and is therefore as expected.21 Obviously, this is not a topotactic phase change for the overall reaction;16,33,34 it involves a series of complex and undefined structural changes on the crystallographic level during the cubic-phase formation,16,33,34 yet these significant structural changes allow the new structure to precipitate without destroying the existing morphology of the pre-shaped solid body,33 which will be narrated in the following sections of the main text or figures.
It can be discerned from Fig. 4a–d that pseudomorphism was successfully observed in the polyhedral shape of the iron(III) fumarate crystals, on a sub-micron scale after this reaction. It is worth noting that pseudomorphism is well known in the mineral world.15 However, relatively few studies have achieved sub-micrometer pseudomorphism, let alone in the realm of MOFs.14,16 The daughter phase derived from the regular polyhedron of MIL-88A was observed by SEM (Fig. S5a†) after a duration time of 2 min by roughening of the smooth parent surface, because of the surface-directed growth of small ill-defined nuclei of sub-few nanometers (Fig. S5a–d†).35 According to microscopy observations, the final product consists of small agglomerated clusters, each of which is composed of dozens of 0D irregular particles with a size up to 16 nm (Fig. 4c and e). This means that besides phase transformation, the growth of crystallites likely due to Ostwald ripening occurs at the comparatively low temperature, favoring the formation of smaller nanocrystalline phases.36 The average crystallite sizes of the targeted phase calculated from the XRD pattern by the Scherrer equation (Fig. 3a) are estimated to be 16.7 nm, in good agreement with the microscopy observations (Fig. 4c and e) of the individual LiFe3O5 domains here. From TEM images (Fig. 4d), it can be clearly seen that an open porous structure was well developed after the transformation of the MOF owing to the escape of organic constituents, and the interstitial pores, about 7–8 nm (Fig. 4e and Fig. S6†), formed in-between the LiFe3O5 nanocrystal are uniformly distributed in an appropriate looser polyhedron. Thereafter, the above result suggests spatiotemporal harmonization of the MOF dissolution, intermediate decomposition and dissolution, and new phase nucleation and crystallization, making the MIL-88A to LiFe3O5 conversion a feasible mesoscale pseudomorphic transformation.13 Unambiguously, this chemical solution route is an attractive strategy for introducing structural hierarchy and porosity. From high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images (Fig. 4e) and the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 4f) featuring multiple diffraction rings, the LiFe3O5 crystals can be definitely identified as a polycrystalline phase with a cubic Fe3O4 structure,24 as previously described by the XRD pattern (Fig. 3a). The high textural porosity of the resultant hierarchical, porous system constructed from LiFe3O5 crystals was well certified by nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis at 298 K (Fig. 4g and h). Negligible N2 adsorption occurs at a low relative pressure of P/P0 < 0.1,37 suggesting the absence of micropores in the sample (see comparison with that of the replaced parent material in Fig. S7†). In the high-pressure range of P/P0 > 0.6, clear hysteresis loops are observed, demonstrating a mass of mesopores.37 The isotherm behavior of the present materials can be classified as characteristic Brunauer–Deming–Deming–Teller (BDDT) type IV shape with H3 type hysteresis loops in the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification,37 which is typically attributed to the aggregates of nanoparticles giving rise to narrow slit-shaped mesopores. According to the desorption branches by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, the sample has a unimodal pore-size distribution with a peak pore size of ∼7.7 nm (Fig. 4h), in good agreement with the previous TEM observations in Fig. 4e and Fig. S6.† Furthermore, on the basis of the isotherm, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the present material are determined as 65.14 cm2 g−1, and the calculated pore volumes as 0.164 cm3 g−1, which are higher than most of the previous data reported for iron oxide-based nanostructures.4,5,23,38 This originated porosity in combination with the nanosized building blocks enables them to maintain structural integrity during repeated insertion/extraction of Li+ ions, to be penetrated easily by the electrolyte, and to provide ample active sites for the accumulation of redox ions or charge.4–6

Replication of the iron-based MIL-88A solid was also performed in aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) medium to further explore the pseudomorphic transformation pathway. It is significant that the type of alkali has a remarkable influence on the composition, the crystalline structure and the extent of pseudomorphic retention of the prepared powders. As seen in Fig. S8,† no reflections corresponding to similar NaFe3O5 were found for the reaction products synthesized with NaOH medium. By contrast, a single phase rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 (hematite) was obtained in the NaOH/MIL-88(A) system. This was most likely due to the large ionic radius of Na+, making it harder to occupy the H+ sites. XRD patterns recorded in intervals of 2.5 h (Fig. S8†) revealed that the transformation of MIL-88A into Fe2O3 has been subjected to an intermediate goethite phase, α-FeOOH. Accordingly, the reaction in the NaOH/MIL-88(A) system may proceed as follows: (4) 2FeOOH (s) → Fe2O3 (s) + H2O (l).(5)
This unexpected phase evolution process in the NaOH/MIL-88A system implies that there must be an undefined factor controlling the cubic LiFe3O5 phase generation rather than α-Fe2O3. We inferred from the results that the total molar reaction Gibbs function change (ΔrGm) of the overall reactions (6) at a given temperature should play a decisive role in generating a more thermodynamically stable cubic phase.21 It is also noteworthy from SEM images (Fig. S9†) of the product prepared with the same parameters (alkali concentration and replication time) but using NaOH that only irregular-shaped dense particles with uneven particle size distribution (around 100–800 nm) were remarked, suggesting the failure of the replication process. This was probably because the conditions of kinetics and spatial coupling between dissolution and crystallization were not well established, when using a base with a higher alkalinity.13 However, we are making efforts to achieve the superior structural replication of the MIL-88A polyhedron to α-Fe2O3 by optimizing the reaction conditions, such as reaction temperature, concentration, and duration of reaction using other hydroxides without any Li source (e.g. NH4OH, NaOH and KOH). (6)
Use of the mixed lithium iron oxides Li–Fe–O in Li storage
Lithium ferrite is another vital iron-based electrode material for LIBs.9–11 To demonstrate the anodic properties of our material, coin-type cells (CR2032) were fabricated. The general features of the galvanostatic discharge–charge (GDC) potential profiles (Fig. 5a) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. 5b) of this sample are in congruence with those of the reported iron oxide electrodes that undergo the conversion mechanism.9,38–41Fig. 5a depicts the representative GDC profiles of the lithium ferrite electrode collected with a cut off potential window of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a rate of 0.1 A g−1. Notably, three distinct regions are detected during the first discharge curve, including two sloping potential plateaus presented from 2.846 to 1.2 V and 1.2 to 0.8 V and a long, flat potential plateau observed around 0.8 V with a potential drop to the cutoff potential of 0.01 V, and ∼86% of the Li-storage capacity was delivered at lower than 1 V. These results correlate with the curves with three cathodic peaks in the initial negative CV sweep and suggest a multi-step lithiation process (Fig. 5b).38–40 According to the earlier studies, the former two regions (or the equivalent small reduction peaks at 1.65 and 0.98 V) could be discerned to correspond to a lithium intercalation reaction, for low levels of lithiation, leading to the formation of Li1+xFe3O5 intermediates (0 < x < 2.54, based on the capacity value) with phase transformation.38–40 They disappear in the subsequent cycles (Fig. 5a and b), indicating that these processes that occurred in the initial cycle are irreversible as they are followed by the decomposition and destruction of the crystal structure.42,43 The complete reduction of iron from Fe(III) (and Fe(II)) to neutral Fe(0) with the formation of amorphous Li2O accompanied by the electrolyte reduction contribute to the broad voltage curve below 0.8 V and the spiky reduction peak centered at 0.59 V.38–40 During the charging process, a plateau with two transitions at ∼1.56 and ∼1.76 V in the charge process can also be clearly identified, which are consistent with the CV curves with two broad overlapping anodic peaks at 1.63 and 1.83 V and are attributed to the reversible oxidation of Fe(0) to Fe(II) and further oxidation to Fe(III), respectively.38–40 In the second cycle, the well-defined discharge plateau was replaced by a predominant sloping portion (about 0.89 V; reversible reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(0)), which is characteristic of a heterogeneous Li uptake/extraction reaction.44 The full lithiation voltage (primary discharge plateau) from the second cathodic process is slightly higher than that in the first cycle, probably due to the lithium-driven textural/structural and/or compositional modification after the first cycle, as well documented in literature reports.38,40 It is noteworthy that the voltage profiles and voltammetric curves nearly overlap in subsequent cycles, indicating good reversibility and stability of the electrochemical reactions between Fe(III) oxide and Fe(0), and this is further confirmed by the cycling performance.

Impressively, the lithium ferrite electrode exhibits high first-cycle discharge and charge capacities of 1410.0 and 1054.7 mA h g−1, respectively, based on the mass of LiFe3O5, corresponding to a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 74.8%. The relatively small and irreversible Li+ consumption during the first cycle could be commonly associated with few Li+ trapping in internal electroactive sites, and predominantly with ineluctable decomposition of the electrolyte to form a SEI membrane (reflected by the lower discharge slope and/or the diminished cathodic CV peaks after the first discharge).9,40,45 For the complete reduction of Fe(III) → Fe(0), one would expect a maximum uptake of 9 Li/LFO (∼947.8 mA h g−1). Accordingly, the markedly high charge capacity that is close to the calculated theoretical value of LiFe3O5 through the nine-electron conversion reaction suggests high reversibility of the lithium reaction. The underlying reason for the high reversibility during the electrochemical process could probably be as follows. Firstly, the small-sized lithium ferrite crystals can lead to the generation of finer iron Fe clusters grown in a Li2O matrix, that act as catalysts in the delithiation reaction to prompt the reduction of electrochemically inactive Li2O.46 The catalysis effect of Fe is generally accepted in various fields, which however was not the case for some other transition metals such as Zn, Mn, etc.47,48 Secondly, according to the composition of lithium ferrite (0.5Li2O·1.5Fe2O3), it might possibly be regarded as a Li2O–Fe2O3 binary composite system. It has been observed in lithia/TMO composite-oxide electrodes that the presence of the pre-added and well-dispersed lithia component may prohibit the grain agglomeration of Fe during the discharging step, effectively absorb the stress, and restrain the conversion-produced Li2O from entering the irreversible SEI film and thus help to improve the initial coulombic efficiency and long-term reversibility of the TMO component.44
Deeper insight into the redox reaction with regard to the structural modification taking place in the oxide is given by XRD (Fig. 5c) and XPS measurements (Fig. 5d) during the first lithium insertion-release. As is shown, the XRD pattern of the crystalline LiFe3O5 phase (cubic phase) is nearly unchanged at the beginning of lithiation, except for slight and collective peak shifting to a low-angle side (Fig. 5c, 1.40d), suggesting that Li initially intercalates into the lithium ferrite crystalline lattice and incurs a slight lattice expansion.49 The lattice expansion with Li+ insertion is readily explained by a decrease in Fe valence with discharging.49 With further intake of lithium ions (Fig. 5c, 0.90d), the lithium ferrite lattice further expands, and additional peaks (superstructure reflections, marked by ‘☆’) that would point to a possible Li/Fe ordering were observed, along with the prompt signal degradation of the lithium-inserted phase (Li1+mFe3O5) (m < x), which means the structure transition of hexagonal Li1+mFe3O5 prior to the subsequent disintegration. When fully discharged to 0.01 V (Fig. 5c, 0.01d), only weak signals representing reduced body-centred-cubic (bcc) iron (e.g. a broad peak at a 2θ value of 45, marked by ‘○’) and fcc Li2O (a broad peak at a 2θ value of 33.8, marked by ‘Δ’) became visible in the experimental spectrum. No signature of crystalline phases is detectable in the fully-charged sample (Fig. 5c, 3.00c), confirming the amorphous character of all particles after the first cycle stemming from the collapse of the lithium ferrite crystalline lattice,42,46 which prevents the clarification of the structure formed during this oxidation process, meanwhile, the less crystalline structure could provide more active sites and faster ion diffusion kinetics.50
The XPS spectra of the Fe 2p core levels, which are sensitive to the valence state of iron, permit determination of the change in the composition of the material on the electrode surface by comparing with that of various iron oxides in the Handbook of XPS. Fig. 5d presents our XPS measurements of the Fe 2p core level spectra of the lithium ferrite electrode for different states during the first reduction–oxidation process. The binding energies of the referential Fe(0) (or Fe metal), Fe(II), and Fe(III) oxidation states are given by the vertical markers in Fig. 5d, and the locations of the corresponding satellite peaks for the Fe(II) and Fe(III) states are given by the dashed lines.51–53 In the first two stages of lithiation (1.40d and 0.90d), an increasing electronic distribution of Fe and/or lower valence core level peaks that should correspond to the intermediate product of small clusters (Fe-rich Fe–O–Li clusters) of partially reduced LiFe3O5 intercalated with Li+ ions became visible with the decreased amplitude of the initial Fe(III) feature.51–53 At the final stage of lithiation (0.01d), the core-level structure is broad with two overlapping Fe(0) shoulders51–53 and its signal is attenuated by the SEI layer.54 In delithiation (3.00c), obvious peak clusters of the Fe 2p3/2 component at a binding energy of 710.7 eV, which is the characteristic of Fe(III),51–53 were observed, suggesting the back-formation of trivalent iron from metallic iron. However, iron metal seems to be not oxidized completely as revealed by the peak of Fe(II) observed at a binding energy of 714.9 eV, which may presumably result from part lithium irreversibly remaining in the lithium ferrite electrodes because of the thicker films we made for ex situ electrochemical analysis.
Taking into account these measurements, during the first discharging step, irreversible destruction of the crystal framework occurs and Fe is driven out from the lattice to form a hybrid consisting of amorphous Fe–Li2O composites. The reversible reaction is related to the Li2O formation/dissociation along with a reduction/oxidation process of the metal particles. These pieces of experimental evidence well supported the results obtained from the GDC and CV profile analyses (Fig. 5a and b), whereby we inferred that LFO undergo an electrochemical conversion/deconversion reaction. However, more detailed investigations are needed in future to acquire accurate information on the species formed during electrochemical cycling.
The lithium cycling behavior of lithium ferrite was firstly tested at a low current density of 0.1 A g−1 in the potential window of 0.01–3.0 V (Fig. 5e). The active lithium ferrite electrode is able to deliver a reversible capacity as high as 802.9 mA h g−1 after 40 galvanostatic cycles. More importantly, the resultant average CE attained 100% beyond few cycles (Fig. S10†), suggesting that the SEI membrane was stable during repeated cycling and there were minimal side reactions.38
High-rate discharge and charging processes are very crucial for real-world applications in LIBs, such as electric vehicle braking and fast recharging of cellphones.55 In general, higher current densities can destroy the structure of electrode materials and result in rapid capacity attenuation. In our case, however, the electrode prepared from the lithium ferrite presents decent cyclability at very fast charge–discharge rates from 0.5 to 2.0 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 5f, capacities of 627.6 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 together with 546.9 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 over 700 repetitive cycles can be steadily preserved. Even at 2.0 A g−1, a comparatively better capacity (410.5 mA h g−1) beyond that of graphitic carbons can still be maintained. It should be mentioned here that to our knowledge, the recently reported different modified forms of iron oxide anodes typically operate at rates of <0.2 A g−1 within 200 cycles and have an inferior rate capability (see the comprehensive comparison in Fig. S11†), while the results here clearly demonstrate that our lithium ferrite electrode can tolerate cycling with varied rates and are suitable for high power applications.
The excellent rate capability of the lithium ferrite electrode can also be confirmed by the related rate profiles shown in Fig. 5g. There is a minor dropout voltage (ΔV) at each current density (Fig. S12†), implying that a slight polarization occurred for this system,43 which thus results in an excellent rate capability, as well as high voltage efficiency and roundtrip energy efficiency. The low electrode polarization at large current densities suggests good conductivity of both electrons and ions of the active materials,55 likely associated with the good contact between the electrolyte and internal electroactive centers, and shortened transport and diffusion paths of electrons and ions enabled by the open porous structure, large surface area, and nanosized LiFe3O5 subunits.55 Furthermore, the similarity of the charge/discharge curves with relative clear discharge/charge plateaus reveal the excellent structure stability of mesostructured lithium ferrite.45,55 As can be seen from an ex situ SEM test of the cycled electrode (Fig. S13†), the overall geometric configuration of lithium ferrite micron particles was barely changed after prolonged cycling, suggesting good tolerance for volume change during cycling and can be explained by the presence of buffer voids, their composition features and hierarchical architecture.4–6,55 Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the lithium ferrite electrode during cycling tests provided further evidence of the superior electrode reaction kinetics and stability of the battery (Fig. 5h). In the spectra, the intercepts of the curves on the real axis are 10.9 and 4.7 Ω for the 1st and 400th cycles, respectively, implying very low internal resistance (Rs) of the lithium ferrite electrode.55 The values of film resistance (diameter of a high-frequency semicircle; small overlapping arc in the high-frequency end; RSEI) and charge-transfer resistance (diameter of an intermediate middle-frequency semicircle; Rct) were also low and retain about 5–15 Ω with long-term cycles, as shown in Fig. 5h, implying the formation of thin and stable SEI on the surface of the lithium ferrite electrode and efficient migration of ions and electrons at the electrolyte–electrode interface during the charge/discharge process.55 Besides, the little variation of the slope of the inclined line at a low frequency (indexed with Warburg impedance (Zw)) indicates stable solid-state Li+ diffusion upon cycling.55 The above results unambiguously highlight the electrochemical merits of the mesostructured electrode.
On the basis of the above analysis, the Fe-based materials here were proved to feature the typical behavior of conversion electrodes in a lithium cell, though the phase after cycling is still ambiguous and needs a global study. Nevertheless, they have demonstrated high electrochemical rechargeability and high, fast and stable energy storage properties characterized by a low intercalation (∼0.8 V) in lithium cells, owing to their unique structural and chemical characteristics obtained from the novel design, rendering them as potential anodes. Several possibilities accounting for their sustained superior lithium-storage performance are presented: structurally, the hierarchical, porous system constructed from mesoporous crystalline LiFe3O5 integrates the merits of materials with different sizes (microsize/nanosize), and pores (mesopore). Firstly, due to the small diffusion distances and rich reactive sites for charge transfer, their nanometric lithium ferrite building blocks could quickly take up and store numerous Li+ ions. Besides, the small size of a LiFe3O5 nanocrystal is pivotal to the full utilization of the catalytic properties of nano-Fe-rich clusters to electrochemically decompose Li2O during charging. These endow them with high reactivity and large lithium capacity. Secondly, the hierarchical mesoporous structure of cubic LiFe3O5 offers an interpenetrating porosity and concomitant high surface area, which are beneficial for the transportation of lithium ions to the internal surface and fluxing across the interface, and for decreased polarization, thus achieving ultra-fast energy storage and release. Thirdly, the small lithium ferrite nanocrystal can partly relax the mechanical strain caused by lithium insertion or removal to prolong the cycle life, while the voids amongst the organized nanobuilding blocks provide free room for even better resistance ability to volume change and then inhibit the aggregation and fragmentation of the electrode material, giving rise to improved cycling stability. Lastly, the hierarchical large polyhedron particles typically of micro-/submicrometer dimensions prevent the aggregation of the particles, in that smaller particles with higher surface energies are easier to aggregate together. Chemically, we associated the enhanced reversibility of the lithiation–delithiation process with the presence of the interstitial Li–O species in the Li–Fe oxide crystalline structures. It was proposed that the additional Li–O component in the ternary crystalline system may act as a confining matrix (or a grain growth inhibitor) to prevent the agglomeration of Fe during discharging, an oxidant to oxidize Fe to Fe(III), and the buffer zone to digest the volume change yielded by the reacted phase much better compared to binary FexOy. As a result, with this design, the new pseudomorph material from MOFs is anticipated to manifest outstanding electrochemical performance.
Conclusion
In summary, we have presented a single-step pseudomorphic replication technique, which was studied as an example of the solution mediated conversion of an archetypical iron-based MOF polyhedron (ca. 1.2 μm in length and 400 nm in width), MIL-88A (hexagonal 3D structure), to a novel LiFe3O5 lithium ferrite material via low temperature hydrothermal treatment with concentrated aqueous LiOH. For the ordered LiFe3O5 compound, structural characterization reveals a cubic (Fdm space group) structure. Starting from discrete polyhedral particles of MIL-88A assembled by Fe3O inorganic building blocks, ligand-exchange results in the formation of intermediate Fe3O(H2O)2(OH)7·nH2O, and then dehydration and dehydroxylation yield Fe3O4OH, which in turn converts into LiFe3O5 mesostructures of densely packed granuliform nanocrystals with a diminutive size of ca. 16 nm via a H+/Li+ ionic exchange reaction, while preserving the same shape and dimensions throughout these solid/solid transformations. For the first time, the electrochemical lithiation–delithiation of this new pseudomorph was well evaluated. Preliminary characterization by electrochemical techniques, ex situ XRD and XPS analyses etc. suggests that the cubic LiFe3O5 was highly reactive towards lithium and offered a low electrode potential against pure lithium, high Li storage capacity (∼800 mA h g−1) with a nine-electron redox reaction and fairly stable high-rate performance (∼410 mA h g−1 without any decay upon 700 consecutive cycles at 2.0 A g−1), probably due to its structural and componential merits, demonstrating competitive advantage over the most commonly used anodes. Such an anode opens the possibility of producing LIBs with higher energy/power densities. More meaningfully, this straightforward, facile and benign (‘green’) chemical technique may enable a paradigm shift in tailored synthesis and design towards a variety of materials science applications. Future conversions of MOF solids into additional interesting lithiated metal oxide compositions and other nanoarchitectures are envisioned.
