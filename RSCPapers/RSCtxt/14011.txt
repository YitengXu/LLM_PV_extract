    , Accepted 3rd July 2019First published on 3rd July 2019AbstractElectrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising strategy to produce syngas, which is an essential feedstock for production of different industrial chemicals. However, it remains a great challenge to realize stable electrosynthesis of syngas with potential-independent CO/H2 ratios due to the limited mass transport and inefficient catalytic interface. Herein, a series of nitrogen-doped tubular carbon foam electrodes were designed and used as both gas diffusers and self-supported electrocatalysts. Owing to the direct delivery of CO2, forced convection flow and tunable number of active sites, the monolithic tubular electrodes enable efficient electrosynthesis of syngas with tuned CO/H2 ratios (1:3 to 2:1) by CO2 reduction in a wide potential range (−0.5 V to −1.3 V vs. RHE). Experimental and simulation studies reveal that the novel tubular carbon foam configuration significantly enhances the mass transport and provides an efficient triple-phase catalytic interface, resulting in relatively stable syngas production in the high-overpotential region.
1. Introduction
Synthesis gas (syngas, a mixture of CO and H2) is an extremely important feedstock for production of liquid fuels and industrial chemicals.1 At present, syngas is mainly produced by gasifying coal or coke.2 This process, however, not only requires expensive industrial equipment and consumes fossil energy, but also causes serious waste pollution. It is of great significance to develop new technologies for clean production of syngas. Recently, the emerging electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 under mild conditions provides a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach for syngas production.3–9 And this approach will be more promising by combining green electricity generated from renewable energy. Over the past few years, a vast variety of catalysts have been investigated for the catalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into syngas, including homogeneous molecular metal complexes and various heterogeneous nanocatalysts.10–21 Unfortunately, most of these catalysts suffer from voltage-sensitive electrocatalytic performance, i.e., a slight voltage fluctuation may result in a dramatic change of the product composition. This adverse effect is apparent in the use of renewable energy, e.g. solar energy or wind power, due to its unstable voltage output. Therefore, a high performance electrocatalyst with stable syngas selectivity spread over a relatively wide voltage window is in high demand for integration with renewable energy sources.
A possible reason for the strong voltage dependence of the syngas composition is the insufficient supply of CO2 at high overpotentials as a result of the mass transport limitation.22,23 As the supply rate of CO2 fails to reach the consumption rate due to the diffusion limitation, a CO2 deficient environment will form near the catalytically active sites, resulting in insufficient *COOH intermediates, which leads to a dominant hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).24 Hence, it is highly desirable to not only explore a novel electrode with a triple-phase interface having high intrinsic catalytic activity but also overcome the kinetics limitation for efficient electroreduction of CO2 to syngas with potential-independent CO/H2 ratios.
The sufficient supply of gaseous reactants during the electrocatalytic process can be accomplished with porous gas diffusion electrodes which have been extensively used in the HER,25 solid oxide fuel cells,26 and CO2 reduction.27,28 The direct delivery of gaseous substrates through forced convection flow ensures a sufficient supply of CO2 to break through the mass transport limitations. The gas diffusion layers are commonly made of porous carbon materials. Carbon foam with a highly open pore structure and large interfacial surface area offers great potential for constructing novel gas diffusion electrodes.29,30 In addition, carbon foam is easily processed and can be cut into any desired shape and structure which is important for the practical applications of gas diffusion electrodes. However, the low specific surface area and chemically inert surface make pristine carbon foam an incompetent catalyst or catalyst support. Much research has been performed to modify the pore structure and surface chemical properties of the carbon foam. Our previous work has indicated that ammonia etching is an effective approach to modify the carbon pore structure and surface chemical properties simultaneously.31,32 Herein, a series of N-doped tubular carbon foam electrodes were synthesized through ammonia etching. The obtained carbon foam electrodes function as both gas diffusion electrodes and self-supported electrocatalysts for tunable syngas production (Scheme 1). Ammonia etching can improve the carbons' electrocatalytic performance by introducing defects and nitrogen species. The carbon foam's highly open framework ensures rapid mass transport, while its tubular shape promotes forced convection, by which the monolithic tubular electrodes yield a stable and tunable product composition (CO:H2 molar ratio, ranging from 1:3 to 2:1) in a wide potential range (−0.5 V to −1.3 V vs. RHE).

2. Experimental
Preparation of carbon foam
Firstly, commercial polyurethane foam (PU foam, provided by Yantai Wanhua Polyurethane Co. Ltd., China) with dimensions of 30.0 × 20.0 × 2.0 cm3 was washed with distilled water and ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 10 h. Then, 100 g of asphaltene (the tetrahydrofuran (THF) soluble fraction of the coal liquefaction residue) was dissolved in 300 g of THF and ultrasonically mixed for 2 h to form a solution. Subsequently, the PU foam was impregnated with the solution at room temperature, and complete adsorption was achieved by repeatedly compressing and expanding the PU foam. After removing the residual solution, the impregnated PU foam was dried at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the impregnated PU foam was oxidized in air at 350 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 to oxidize the thermoplastic asphaltene. Finally, the solidified foam was carbonized at 600 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 in flowing nitrogen. After cooling to room temperature, the monolithic carbon foam was obtained and denoted as CF.
Preparation of N-doped tubular carbon foam electrodes
First, the as-prepared CF was cut into a cuboid shape with dimensions of 2.0 × 1.5 × 1.5 cm3. Then, the cubic carbon foam was transferred to a corundum boat that was placed in the constant temperature zone of a tube furnace and heated to 1000 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in flowing argon. Subsequently, the atmosphere inside the furnace was replaced with flowing ammonia and held for the desired time (30, 60, 90 and 120 min) and the N-doped carbon foam electrodes were obtained and denoted as CF-30, CF-60, CF-90 and CF-120, respectively. When prolonging the etching time to more than 120 min, the structure of the carbon foam monolith will be destroyed. By cutting them into the desired hollow cylindrical shape with a height of 15 mm, an inner diameter of 6 mm and an outer diameter of 12 mm, the N-doped tubular carbon foam electrodes were obtained. For comparison, the corresponding N-doped planar carbon foam electrodes (pCF-30, 60, 90 and 120) were also fabricated under the same conditions. The CF-120 was ground into powder to illustrate the effect of the monolithic tubular structure on the catalytic performance.
Materials characterization
The morphologies and structures of the samples were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi SU8200). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C with a physical sorption instrument (Micromeritics 3Flex 3500). The specific surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and pore size distributions were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/Max-2400 diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectra were obtained using a Thermo Fisher Scientific DXR Raman microscope, using a 532 nm laser as the light source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained using a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with monochromatized Al Kα as the excitation source.
Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical experiments were carried out in a three-electrode system on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E). The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 was achieved in a gas-tight H-type cell, which was separated by a proton exchange membrane (Nafion® 117, Dupont), and each compartment contained 50 mL aqueous 0.1 M KHCO3 solution and approximately 40 mL headspace. The synthesized N-doped tubular carbon foam was directly used as both the gas diffuser and working electrode. Platinum foil (1 × 1 cm2) and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) served as the counter and the reference electrode, respectively. All potentials were measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and converted to the RHE reference scale using E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V + 0.0591 × pH. Before electrolysis, the catholyte was first purged with Ar (99.999%) for 30 min to remove any dissolved gases, and then purged with CO2 (99.999%) for at least 30 min to ensure that the catholyte is saturated with CO2. During the experiments, CO2 was continuously delivered into the cathodic compartment at a constant flow rate of 20 sccm.
To use the powdered material as the active component, 10.0 mg of CF-120 powder and 40 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution (Dupont) were dispersed in a solution of 700 μL deionized water and 260 μL ethanol by sonication for 1 h to form a uniformly dispersed ink. For comparison, various volumes (20 μL, 30 μL, 40 μL, and 50 μL) of catalyst ink were also pipetted onto the surface of a carbon paper (0.5 × 0.5 cm2) and dried under an infrared lamp.
Product analysis
The gaseous products were detected using an on-line gas chromatograph (SHIMADZU, GC-2014) every 25 min. The volume of the gas sampling loop was 1 mL. The GC was set up to pre-separate the gas sample through a packed P–N column (80/100 mesh, 3.2 × 2.1 mm × 1.0 m) and reverse purge the CO2 and C2 hydrocarbons (if any) before passing through a packed MoleSieve 13X column (80/100 mesh, 3.2 × 2.1 mm × 2.0 m). The separated H2 was quantified using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and CO and CH4 were passed through a methanizer and quantified using a flame ionization detector (FID). The liquid phase products were identified using a 1D 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscope (Bruker AVANCE III 500) using the WET solvent suppression pulse sequence. For quantifying the liquid products, 500 μL electrolyte was mixed with 100 μL D2O and 0.05 μL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) as an internal standard.
Calculation of faradaic efficiency and production rate of CO or H2
The faradaic efficiency was calculated as follows: (1) (2)where VCO or H2 is the measured volume concentration of the product in a 1 mL sample loop based on calibration of the GC with a standard gas, Q (=20 sccm) is the flow rate of CO2, N (=2) is the number of electrons required to produce a molecule of CO or H2, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), p0 is the atmospheric pressure (1.013 × 105 Pa), R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), T is the ambient temperature (298 K), and itotal is the recorded total current. The production rates are momentary rates of CO and H2 formation. They are calculated according to the time when the gas sampling loop is filled with the gas sample. The gas filling time is 1/(20/60) = 3 s. The generated amount of CO or H2 can be quantitatively analyzed using the GC. Thus, the momentary production rates of CO or H2 can be obtained.
Gas diffusion simulation
Gas diffusion was studied by the finite volume method (FVM) with Fluent software (FLUENT 18.1). The influence of the temperature field was not considered as the temperature variation in the experiment was very small. The monolithic tubular porous medium model was built according to the microstructure of tube-like carbon foam, and the contrasting planar porous medium model was established based on the planar carbon foam without the tubular appearance. The species transport model was used for describing the diffusion of CO2. The governing equations and solver settings in the current simulation were based on the literature.33
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a presents a schematic illustration of the fabrication process of N-doped carbon foam. In this procedure, PU foam, a porous 3D flexible organic foam with an open skeleton (pore size: ∼500 μm), high surface area and low density (Fig. S1†),34 acts as a sacrificial template. By the template method, the highly open carbon foams can be controllably synthesized under mild conditions in the absence of foaming agents. For improvement of the conductivity and mechanical properties of carbon foam, asphaltene, a high aromatic matter, was chosen as the carbon precursor. The PU foam was first impregnated with a solution of asphaltene/THF. Due to the highly open structure inside the PU foam (Fig. S1b†), the asphaltene solution can easily penetrate it, and infused PU foam was obtained. After extracting the residual impregnated solution and solidifying in an air atmosphere, asphaltene was homogeneously coated on the surfaces of the PU foam skeletons and solidified foam was obtained. Through carbonization and further ammonia etching, the solidified foam was transformed into N-doped carbon foam. As revealed in Fig. 1b, the strategy for synthesizing the CF is readily scalable. Although the foam skeletons shrank during the carbonization, CF with dimensions of 22 × 15 × 1.5 cm3 was still obtained. Fig. 1c and d show the FESEM images of CF at various magnifications. Obviously, the CF has perfectly inherited the 3D interconnected macroporous networks of PU foam, although the void size is reduced to 200–300 μm (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d demonstrates that the CF has quite a smooth surface. Fig. 1e shows the top view photograph of the monolithic tubular electrode. It's worth noting that the monolithic electrode can be arbitrarily cut into the desired shape (Fig. S2†), which can be assembled on gas diffusion supports with different diameters. To further study the morphology of the monolithic tubular electrode, the FESEM images are presented in Fig. 1f and g. The carbon foam maintains its monolithic 3D macroporous framework (Fig. 1f) after the ammonia etching process, which provides not only the electron transfer networks, but also the gas and electrolyte transport channels. Fig. 1g shows the rough and porous surfaces compared to the smooth CF skeletons, indicative of the etching effect of ammonia at high temperature.35,36 The cross-sectional view of the 3D carbon skeleton (Fig. S3†) shows a cable like structure with a rough surface and dense skeleton, by which the surface modification of ammonia etching can be verified. The rough surface provides abundant catalytically active sites, while the dense skeleton ensures the high mechanical strength and good conductivity of carbon foam. Meanwhile, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping demonstrated the presence of C, N and O (Fig. 1h), which were homogeneously distributed along the whole rough structure. The highly open porous structure could promote the infiltration of the electrolyte and improve the surface usage.37

The surface wetting property is a key factor in determining the performance of the electrocatalyst. The contact angles (CAs) were measured to study the effect of the ammonia etching on the wettability of N-doped carbon foam. As shown in Fig. S4a,† the droplet of water could quickly infiltrate the N-doped carbon foam within 20 ms, indicating good hydrophilicity. This can be attributed to the increased surface polarity of CF as a result of the nitrogen species introduced by ammonia etching. In contrast, for pristine carbon foam, the water droplet resting on its surface indicated its hydrophobicity (CA = 119°) (Fig. S4b†). It is reasonable to assume that the 3D macroporous structure and hydrophilic surface of N-doped carbon foam can improve the mass transfer on the gas-liquid-solid triple-phase boundary and consequently promote the catalytic reaction.
The pore structures of various carbon foam electrodes were further revealed by the N2 adsorption–desorption measurements (Fig. 2a). Apparently, the specific surface area (SBET) gradually increased by prolonging the ammonia etching time. The SBET of CF-30, CF-60, CF-90 and CF-120 was 726, 807, 1118, and 1223 m2 g−1, respectively, which are much higher than that of pristine CF (8 m2 g−1). The sharp increase of the SBET at low pressures is attributed to the nitrogen filling in micropores below 2 nm (Fig. 2b). The micropore volume and mesopore volume of CF-120 were calculated to be 0.6 cm3 g−1 and 0.55 cm3 g−1, respectively, indicating its hierarchical pore structure. The pore size distributions of various carbon foam electrodes are shown in Fig. 2b. The mesopores are narrowly distributed in the range of 2–5 nm. The abundant micropores and small mesopores present in thick foam walls are beneficial for the accessibility of active sites.31 The voids and cells function as the gas diffusion channels and the electrolyte reservoirs,38 and the interconnected 3D networks can serve as the transport highways to improve electron transfer and significantly accelerate catalytic kinetics. The microstructures of the samples were further verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 2c presents the XRD patterns of the various carbon foam electrodes. A broad peak located at ∼26° and a weak peak at ∼42° corresponding to the (002) and (100) diffraction peaks, respectively, indicate the turbostratic carbon nature of the samples. With the increase of the etching time, the diffraction peak around 26° shows a noticeable blue shift, suggesting that large amounts of defects are introduced into the carbon layer leading to an expanded interlayer spacing.39 The Raman spectra of the samples show that the peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) of CF-30, CF-60, CF-90, and CF-120 are 0.99, 1.05, 1.07, and 1.11, respectively, much higher than that of pristine CF (0.70) (Fig. 2d), indicating the lattice defects and disorder features of the N-doped carbon foam electrodes. The peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) progressively increased by prolonging the etching time due to the introduced defects,40 which are consistent with the XRD results.

Fig. 3a shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of CF-120, again confirming the existence of C, N, and O elements in the N-doped carbon foam electrodes. Fig. 3b and c show the high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s and C 1s. The high-resolution N 1s spectrum can be fitted to four peaks at 398.7, 400.4, 401.4 and 402–405 eV, corresponding to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N and N-oxide, respectively (Fig. 3b and S5†).41 It has been reported that the introduction of nitrogen species, especially pyridinic-N, could lead to numerous defects and active sites, thus resulting in a desirable CO2RR performance.24,42–44 Meanwhile, some researchers reported that pyrrolic-N plays an important role in improving the CO2RR performance by stabilizing *COOH and suppressing the HER. Therefore, it can be determined that nitrogen defects are beneficial to the CO2RR.45,46 The high-resolution C 1s spectrum is deconvoluted into several subpeaks (Fig. 3c), which correspond to the CC (284.6 eV), C–C (285.5 eV), C–N (286.2 eV), C–O (286.7 eV) and OC–O bonds (290.4 eV),47 indicating successful incorporation of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functional groups into the carbon foam electrodes. Fig. 3d shows the contents of different types of N species in the N-doped carbon foam electrodes as characterized by XPS. Notably, the contents of both pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in the samples increase by prolonging the etching time, which leads to an increase in the number of active sites. The increased nitrogen content is favorable to enhancing the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the monoxide product, while lowering the FE of the hydrogen product.48

To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the N-doped carbon foam electrodes, a series of monolithic tubular electrodes were assembled using a specially designed electrode holder (Fig. S6†). The composite configuration can work as the gas diffuser and offer a unique opportunity for a high-rate electrochemical reaction relative to conventional configurations.49Fig. 4a shows the FE for CO production on various monolithic tubular electrodes at different applied potentials. Initially, the FEs of CO for CF-30, CF-60, CF-90 and CF-120 significantly increase with the applied potential and reach their maxima at about −0.50 V. Unlike the corresponding planar electrodes (pCF) (Fig. S7†) or powder-like electrode materials reported previously,48 the N-doped carbon foam electrodes show a stable FE of CO in a relatively wide potential window. This exciting phenomenon could well be associated with the enhanced continuity of the surface reaction, which results from the facile mass transport of CO2 inside the monolithic tubular electrode.27 From the overall perspective, the FE of CO increases with the N content of catalysts and SBET. Specifically, CF-120 exhibited the highest FE of ∼60% for CO production among the various catalysts, whereas CF-30 showed the lowest FE of ∼20%. Besides CO, the content of H2 is also a significant parameter for evaluating the proportion of syngas. Therefore, the composition of the gas products was analyzed using the online GC system. As shown in Fig. S8,† CO and H2 along with an extremely low amount of CH4 (below 1%) were detected, which are desirable components of syngas mixtures. However, the main product using pristine carbon foam as the catalyst is hydrogen (Fig. S9†), indicating its low electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction. Furthermore, the possible liquid products were also analyzed by 1D 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and the contents of liquid products are below the detection limit (Fig. S10†). Obviously, the controllable relative proportions of CO and H2 provide an opportunity for tunable syngas production. Using CF-30, CF-60, CF-90, and CF-120 as catalysts, the ratios of CO/H2 in syngas varied from 1:3 to 2:1 in a wide potential range. Notably, the CO/H2 ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 are all in the optimal syngas region (Fig. 4b),16 and are ideal for different industrial applications, such as methanol synthesis (0.5),16,50 hydroformylation (1.0),51 and short-chain thermochemical synthesis (2.0).16,51 The relationship between the N content in samples and the associated FE for CO or the CO/H2 ratio is shown in Fig. 4b. The FE for CO and the CO/H2 ratio were found to be positively correlated with the N content, implying that N species play a key role in syngas proportion control, which agrees well with the previous reports.51

(b) Faradaic efficiencies and the corresponding proportions of syngas at −0.6 V vs. RHE as a function of N content in the various samples. (c) CO production rates of various samples at different applied potentials. (d) Partial current densities for CO at different applied potentials. (e) Partial current densities for H2 at different applied potentials. 
The syngas production rate is also an important parameter for evaluating the catalytic performance. Here, the CO and H2 production rates are shown with varying applied potentials (Fig. 4c and S11†). As expected, the production rates of both CO and H2 increase along with the elevated potential in a wide range (−0.25 V to ∼−1.1 V vs. RHE). In this case, the undersupply of CO2 certainly will decrease the content of CO in the syngas, namely, the mass transport of CO2 significantly affects the composition of the product. Fig. 4d and e show the partial current densities for CO (jCO) and H2 (jH2) production, respectively. The jCO curves of all the samples show a similar tendency with the increase of the applied potential. However, the CF-120 exhibits the highest jCO and the lowest jH2, demonstrating its superior CO2RR selectivity. Moreover, the CF-30 and CF-60 exhibit higher HER activities than CO2 reduction activities (jH2 > jCO), while the CF-120 exhibits higher CO2 reduction activity than HER activity (jH2 < jCO). Benefiting from these characteristics, the proportion of syngas can be well regulated.
To further illustrate how the kinetics controls the catalytic process, the catalytic performances of the corresponding powder materials were investigated. The electrode with CF-120 powder as the active material was prepared by dropping a catalyst ink onto a carbon paper electrode. The CF-120 powder electrode in a CO2-saturated electrolyte exhibits a larger current density and a more positive onset potential than that in an Ar-saturated electrolyte (Fig. S12a†), again confirming the intrinsic activity of N-doped carbon foam. Nevertheless, the FE of CO over the powder electrode is less than 40% and decreases with the increase of overpotential after reaching the maximum (Fig. S12b†). In order to clarify the effect of mass transfer distance on the electrocatalytic performance, a series of powder electrodes with different catalyst loadings were prepared. Fig. S13(a1–d1)† shows cross-sectional FESEM images of the CF-120 powder electrodes with different catalyst loadings. We can see that the catalyst coating thickness increased from ∼30.3 to ∼76.5 μm by increasing the catalyst loading from 0.8 to 2.0 mg cm−2. These carbon particles accumulated together compactly, which significantly increased the mass transfer resistance of CO2 in the catalyst. Besides, the usage of a binder inevitably decreased the conductivity of the powder catalyst and reduced the utilization of active sites. As expected, the maximum FE of CO (FEmax-CO) over the series of powder electrodes decreased from ∼40% to ∼28% as the catalyst loading increased from 0.8 to 2.0 mg cm−2 (Fig. S13(a2–d2)†). Meanwhile, the overpotentials of FEmax-CO also showed an increasing trend, that is, the electrocatalytic performance significantly deteriorates by increasing the CO2 diffusion distance. Thus, our monolithic tubular electrode with low diffusion resistance and abundant accessible active sites shows great potential for use in the high-efficiency electrocatalysis process. To reveal the electrokinetics of the reaction at the monolithic tubular electrode, the monolithic planar electrode and the corresponding powder electrode, the Tafel plots are presented (Fig. 5a and S13(a3–d3)†). The Tafel slope at low overpotentials for the monolithic tubular electrode was determined to be 103 mV dec−1, lower than those for the planar electrode (188 mV dec−1) and powder electrodes (153–213 mV dec−1), suggesting favorable kinetics for CO production.52 The formation of the *COOH intermediate is determined to be the rate-limiting step in the CO2 reduction process.46,53 The poor kinetics on the planar electrode and powder electrodes are probably due to the limitation of mass transfer, which also implies that the monolithic tubular electrode has a huge advantage in the catalytic reaction.

(c) The long-term stability of CF-120 for producing syngas: operated at a potentiostatic potential of −0.6 V for 8 h; geometric current density vs. time (left axis) and FEs of CO and H2 production vs. time (right axis). 
To further demonstrate how the monolithic tubular structure affects the gas mass transfer, the gas concentration distributions in various electrodes were simulated. Based on the parameters and sizes of electrodes used in the actual experiment (Fig. S14†), a tubular porous model with 12 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness is established. Here, we focus on gas diffusion performance with the finite volume method of FLUENT software to investigate the effects of appearance on electrode properties theoretically. Fig. 5b compares the monolithic tubular electrode and the corresponding planar electrode, both of which are composed of interconnected 3D macroporous networks. The only difference between the two models is their shape. In the case of the tubular electrode, as the CO2 flows into the tubular carbon foam from the top, the gas will fill the electrode chamber quickly through forced convection. Therefore, the environment near the active sites can maintain a high CO2 concentration. As shown in Fig. 5(b1), the blue color cold area represented high concentrations of CO2 inside the monolithic tubular electrode, indicating a very high efficiency of mass-transfer, which was very positive for the three-phase contact in the CO2 reduction process.54 In the case of the planar electrode, the air content inside the electrode far away from the CO2 outlet remains at a high level (Fig. 5(b2)), resulting in a CO2 deficient environment near the active sites. The different CO2 concentration gradient demonstrates the different gas diffusion mechanism, i.e., forced convection in the tubular electrode and molecule diffusion in the planar electrode, by which a CO2-rich environment can be formed in the tubular electrode. The simulation results agree well with our expectation and the experimental results; the gas diffusion efficiency can be appreciably enhanced by optimizing the morphology and appearance of the electrode.
The long-term stability of an electrocatalyst for producing syngas is crucial for practical applications. Taking CF-120 as an example, the syngas proportion remains stable (CO/H2 molar ratio = 2:1) with a slight decrease in current density for more than 8 h of continuous operation (Fig. 5c), indicating excellent cycle durability. To verify the reason for the decrease in current density, we investigated the chemical states of N dopants after 8 h of testing. The relative contents of various N dopants show no obvious differences compared with the original CF-120. However, the atomic concentration of total N decreased from 5.6 to 4.6 at% (Fig. S15†), which could be the cause of deactivation.
To emphasize the stable syngas production in a wide potential range of the N-doped tubular carbon foam electrodes, the CO/H2 ratio fluctuations as a function of voltage are compared with those in the recent representative literature (Fig. 6). Obviously, the tubular carbon foam exhibits the lowest voltage sensitivity. By combining the high electrocatalysis activity and low voltage sensitivity, the N-doped tubular carbon foam shows great potential for converting CO2 into syngas with tuned CO/H2 ratios using renewable energy.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a series of N-doped tubular carbon foam electrodes were successfully prepared through a facile and scalable approach and used in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for the first time. The novel porous monolithic tubular configuration enables direct delivery of CO2 and enhanced mass transport, resulting in an efficient triple-phase catalytic interface. Acting as both gas diffusers and self-supported electrocatalysts, the monolithic tubular electrodes exhibit stable production of tunable syngas from the reduction of CO2 in a wide potential range (−0.5 V to −1.3 V vs. RHE). The CO/H2 ratio of the produced syngas is tunable from 1:3 to 2:1 by controlling the nitrogen defect enrichment. Considering its facile synthesis process, cost-effectiveness, 3D interconnected macroporous networks and excellent electrocatalytic activity, the tubular carbon foam monolith can act as a promising modified gas diffusion electrode or supporting scaffold, showing great potential in catalysis and energy storage devices.
