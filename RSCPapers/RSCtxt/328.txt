1. Introduction
Photocatalysis is very important for current environmental and energy issues, which offers a “green” technology for completely eliminating various kinds of contaminants (especially some azo dyes) and obtaining ideal hydrogen energy from sunlight and water.1–3 Semiconductors are commonly selected as photocatalysts because they can absorb light over a wide spectral range.2,3 However, wide band gap semiconductor based photocatalysts (TiO2, ZnO, ZnS, etc.) only can be excited by ultraviolet (UV) and near UV light, which account for only 4% of the total solar spectrum, to generate charge carriers for promoting the surface redox reactions.3–10 So far, near infrared (NIR) and IR light (collectively called (N)IR) of sunlight (accounting for 53%) are still not fully utilized by present photocatalytic systems, which has become gradually an urgent challenge for chemistry and materials science. To effectively utilize the (N)IR light, an ideal photocatalytic system should have at least the following two specifications: effectively activated by (N)IR light and efficient light restriction.
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs), as a novel class of recently discovered nanocarbons, display abundant photo-physical or chemical properties (photoinduced electron transfer and redox properties, luminescence and so on).11 The strong size and excitation wavelength dependent photoluminescence (PL) behaviors further enhance their photocatalytic properties.11 Especially, the up-converted PL of CQDs infer the possibility to construct a CQDs based (N)IR light sensitive complex photocatalytic system.11–14 In our previous work, TiO2/CQDs and SiO2/CQDs complex systems were demonstrated to show excellent photocatalytic abilities in visible light,11 while they were still weak in the (N)IR wavelength zone. Recently, the photocatalytic properties of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) have been extensively studied. It is demonstrated that Cu2O can effectively adsorb molecular oxygen, which can scavenge photogenerated electrons to restrain the recombination of electron/hole pairs, and consequently improve photocatalytic efficiency.15 In light of its relatively narrow band gap (about 2.2 eV), high photostability, and low toxicity,15–18 Cu2O was a potential candidate for designing the CQDs based (N)IR light sensitive photocatalyst.
Herein, we report the facile one-step ultrasonic fabrication of a CQDs/Cu2O composite with protruding nanostructures on the surface. Significantly, we demonstrate for the first time that this photocatalytic system could harness (N)IR light to enhance the photocatalytic activity based on the collective effect of the superior light reflecting ability of the Cu2O protruding nanostructures and the up-converted PL property of CQDs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of CQDs
A suitable amount of glucose was dissolved in deionized water (50 mL) to form a clear solution (1 mol L−1). NaOH (50 mL, 1 mol L−1) solution was added to the solution of glucose, then the mixed solution was treated by an ultrasonic wave (150 W, 40 KHz) for 1 hour. The crude sample (20 mL) obtained from glucose/NaOH was adjusted to pH = 7 with HCl. After that, the crude solution was given a dialysis treatment using a semi-permeable membrane (MWCO 1000) to remove any impurities except for the CQDs sample. After filter treatment, the obtained solution was brown, implying the formation of CQDs.
2.2. Synthesis of CQDs/Cu2O photocatalysts
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. In a typical synthesis, 150 mL NaOH (1 mol L−1) was added to 150 mL CuSO4 (0.1 mol L−1) solution drop by drop to form a flocculent suspension, which was given an ultrasonic treatment (150 W, 40 KHz) for 15 min, and followed by adding 20 mL polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 50 g L−1) solution to it. After that, 100 mL glucose (C6H12O6) solution (1 mol L−1) was added slowly to the obtained mixture with stirring, followed by an ultrasonic treatment for 60 min. After ageing for 1 or 16 hour(s), the obtained raw products were washed, centrifuged several times with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, and oven-dried at 60 °C for 6 h. Finally, the CQDs/Cu2O (glossy) or CQDs/Cu2O composite were obtained.
2.3. Photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue (MB)
Photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue (MB) was carried out in a 100 mL conical flask containing 50 mg L−1 MB solution and a suitable amount (30 mg) of CQDs/Cu2O nanocomposite as catalyst. Different lamps for illumination were positioned inside a cylindrical vessel and surrounded by a circulating water jacket for cooling. The solution was stirred for 12 h to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The probe was then irradiated with four different light irradiations: UV (18 W and 150 W), visible and (N)IR light (150 W), (N)IR light (150 W). Visible and (N)IR light, and only (N)IR light were obtained by using cutoff filters to remove light of λ < 400 nm or λ < 700 nm and suitable attenuation slices to control the power of the light (400 W halogen lamp). MB was determined spectrophotometrically at λmax = 605 nm.
2.4. Photocurrent response measurements
Commercial indium tin oxide (ITO) was used as the substrate for electrode buildup, and cleaned by sonication sequentially for 20 min each in acetone, 10% KOH in ethanol and doubly deionized water. Photoelectrochemical experiments were performed in a conventional three-electrode cell (Pyrex window) with a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. The working electrodes were ITO/CQDs/Cu2O, ITO/CQDs, ITO/commercial Cu2O with the glass side facing the incident light. They were prepared by spreading aqueous slurries over ITO glass substrates. The electrolyte used in cells was 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at pH = 6.8. A 400 W Xe lamp was used as light source with a Schott optical filter RG 780 to get (N)IR light and positioned 3 cm away from the photoelectrochemical cell. The photocurrent signal was recorded with a CHI 660C workstation (CH Instruments, Chenhua, Shanghai, China) connected to a personal computer. All electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature.
2.5. Characterization
TEM and high-resolution images of samples were obtained with a FEI-Tecnai F20 (200 kV) TEM. The XRD pattern was recorded with an X-ray diffractometer (Empyrean, Holand Panalytical). SEM images of samples were obtained with a Philips XL30. Fluorescent spectrophotometry was recorded on a FluoroMax 4 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) spectrophotometer, while DRS absorption and reflectance spectra were obtained with a PerkinElmer Lamda 750 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussion
The preparation of CQDs from glucose could be achieved by the ultrasonic synthetic method in the presence of NaOH (experimental details given in ESI†), the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution (HR)-TEM images and infrared spectrum of the as-prepared CQDs are displayed in Fig. S1 and S2†, which are similar to the CQDs structure obtained in our previous work.11a Here, the CQDs/Cu2O composite with protruding nanostructures was synthesized by a one-step ultrasonic method and the morphology and structure of such a CQDs/Cu2O composite are shown in Fig. 1a–d. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows near spherically shaped colloidal particles in 1–3 μm diameter. The TEM (inset in Fig. 1a) and SEM images of a single CQDs/Cu2O particle (Fig. 1b) demonstrate its surface protruding structures. HRTEM image of the CQDs/Cu2O composite shows a perfectly crystallized structure (also certified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, Fig. S3†), with the CQDs deposited on the surface of Cu2O (Fig. 1c), then the CQDs/Cu2O particle can be well understood to have a good composite construction. Fig. 1d shows the HRTEM image of CQDs/Cu2O with the lattice spacings around 0.25 nm and 0.32 nm, which agree well with the crystallographic <111> spacing of Cu2O and <002> spacing of carbon,11,15,19–21 demonstrating that the CQDs are successfully loaded on the surface of Cu2O particles. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element mapping result (elements distribution of Cu, O and C, Fig. 1e–h) further confirms that CQDs are evenly distributed on the surface of Cu2O.

In order to obtain an excellent photocatalyst, the study on the interaction or relationship between photocatalyst and light is essential. So the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) absorption and reflectance spectra of the CQDs/Cu2O composite were recorded. The DRS absorption spectral results demonstrate that the CQDs/Cu2O composite can adsorb significantly more light in the 600–2500 nm region as compared with pure commercial Cu2O (Fig. 2a). The absorption edge of the CQDs/Cu2O composite clearly tailed out to longer wavelengths due to the presence of CQDs on the surface of Cu2O, while more absorption in the (N)IR range was observed concurrently with less extinction in the (N)IR region. The different colors of CQDs/Cu2O (deep brown) and commercial Cu2O (brick-red) samples shown in the inset pictures are consistent with the spectral lines showing that the CQDs/Cu2O composite has wider and stronger absorption. Meanwhile, inset (Fig. 2a, top right corner) is the enlarged graph of DRS absorption spectra in the range of 260–320 nm. The absorption band of CQDs/Cu2O represents the typical absorption of an aromatic π system, similar to that of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,11,13,22–25 which is the characteristic absorption of CQDs (Fig. S4† from 260–320 nm). As shown, the commercial Cu2O does not have an obvious absorption band in this range, again proving that CQDs are effectively loaded on the surface of the Cu2O particles. Fig. 2b shows the DRS reflectance comparison between the CQDs/Cu2O composite and pure commercial Cu2O sample. The former indeed has lower reflectance (18.85–30.36%) than that of the commercial Cu2O (48.81%–68.75%) in the range of 640–2500 nm, further demonstrating that the CQDs/Cu2O composite has a better light restriction ability. These results define the CQDs/Cu2O composite as an “(N)IR-sensitive” structure, where the combination of two parts gives rise to synergistic properties arising from the beneficial interaction between CQDs and Cu2O.

DRS absorption spectra clearly show the optical absorption of CQDs/Cu2O shifts towards (N)IR light wavelengths, implying the possibility of photoelectrical and photocatalytic responses in the (N)IR region. To evaluate the photoelectrochemical property of CQDs/Cu2O, a series of photoelectrochemical experiments was performed. Remarkably, as expected, the CQDs/Cu2O composite is indeed able to generate a significant photocurrent even under (N)IR-light irradiation (red line in Fig. 2c), while pure CQDs and Cu2O display weak (blue line) and no (black line) photocurrents, respectively. In order to test and verify the photocatalytic activity of the CQDs/Cu2O composite, the degradation of methyl blue (MB) in aqueous solution under (N)IR light was performed. The corresponding plot of MB concentration versus reaction time with different photocatalysts under irradiation of (N)IR light (λ > 700 nm) is shown in Fig. 2d, from which we can see that the photodegradation process over CQDs/Cu2O composite is efficient with about 90% MB decomposed after 240 min. In control experiments using pure CQDs or Cu2O as photocatalysts, no or little (<3%) reduction of MB was observed, that is to say, commercial Cu2O and CQDs do not have photocatalytic activity under (N)IR irradiation. The photochemical experiments indicate that the excellent photocatalytic behavior of CQDs/Cu2O should be attributed to the special composite structure and the interaction between the CQDs and Cu2O.
To verify whether the protruding nanostructures on the surface of the CQDs/Cu2O composite can enhance the (N)IR light harnessing ability and photocatalytic activity, the CQDs/Cu2O sample with a glossy surface (called CQDs/Cu2O (glossy) or CQDs/Cu2O (g)) was synthesized by controlling the ageing time, and its photocatalytic property was tested and compared with that of the CQDs/Cu2O composite. The composition of the CQDs/Cu2O (g) was confirmed by its EDS spectrum and EDS element mapping data (Fig. S5 and S6†). The SEM and TEM (inset) images of the CQDs/Cu2O (g) are shown in Fig. 3a, clearly revealing that the surface of the sample is smooth and does not have any protuberant structures. The DRS absorption and reflectance spectra of the CQDs/Cu2O composite and CQDs/Cu2O (g) are compared in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3b, the absorption of CQDs/Cu2O (g) is located at a shorter wavelength region as compared with that of the CQDs/Cu2O composite, and as revealed in Fig. 3c, more light (about double) is reflected by CQDs/Cu2O (g). In other words, more light reaching the surface of the CQDs/Cu2O composite is absorbed due to the introduction of the protruding structures, which may cause multiple reflections of the incident light during irradiation.26 Therefore, it is noteworthy that the protruding nanostructures of the CQDs/Cu2O composite are favourable for increased absorption in the (N)IR wavelength region. The photocatalytic activities of the CQDs/Cu2O composite and CQDs/Cu2O (g) were further compared by using the photodegradation of MB under (N)IR light as a probe reaction (Fig. 3d). Under the same experimental conditions, the CQDs/Cu2O composite shows higher photocatalytic activity of 90% degradation of MB, while the degradation was only 40% for CQDs/Cu2O (g). Considering that the CQDs/Cu2O composite and CQDs/Cu2O (g) have the same element species (Cu, O, C), then the key point for such an enhanced photocatalytic activity of the CQDs/Cu2O composite lies in the unique protruding nanostructures on the surface. The protruding nanostructures can allow multiple reflections of (N)IR light on the surface of the CQDs/Cu2O composite photocatalyst and make better use of the light source, resulting in improved photocatalytic activity, which agrees well with the results of DRS absorption and reflectance spectra. The above results unequivocally indicate that such unique protruding nanostructures are responsible for the greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity of the CQDs/Cu2O composite.

The CQDs we prepared have excellent up-converted PL, and they can be excited by long-wavelength light (>700 nm) with the up-converted emissions located in the range of 390–700 nm. Fig. 4a shows the up-converted PL spectra of CQDs with excitations at 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 and 1000 nm. As it is known, the bandgap of about 2.2 eV restricts the activation of Cu2O by energy from visible light-radiation with wavelengths in the range of 300–564 nm to form photogenerated electrons and holes. Considering the up-converted emissions are located in the range 390–700 nm, the available up-converted wavelengths which can be further used to excite Cu2O should be in the range of 300–564 nm. Here, according to the up-converted PL spectra of CQDs, we compared the detailed emission energy distribution located in the range of 390–564 nm in Fig. 4b. Here, the shaded areas were used to determine the integral areas of the up-converted emissions between 390 and 564 nm excited by 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 and 1000 nm. We can see that, for the CQDs, the largest integral area/the highest energy distribution of the up-converted emission located between 390 and 564 nm is displayed for the excitation wavelength at about 900 nm. Consequently, the up-converted PL response of CQDs is indeed responsible for the photoelectrical and photocatalytic properties of the CQDs/Cu2O composite in the (N)IR range. That is to say, it is reasonable to attribute the excellent photoelectrical and photocatalytic response of CQDs/Cu2O in the (N)IR region to the existence of the energy transfer from the up-converted emission energy of CQDs to Cu2O. It suggests that CQDs can be used as a powerful energy-transfer component for applications in environmental and energy issues.

On the basis of the above experimental results, the photocatalytic process of the CQDs/Cu2O composite under (N)IR light can be described as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4c. When the CQDs/Cu2O composite photocatalyst is illuminated (Fig. 4c (1)), the protruding nanostructures allow multiple reflections of (N)IR light between the vacant spaces of these protruding particles, which can make better use of the source light and therefore offer an improved photocatalytic activity.26 On the other hand, CQDs can absorb (N)IR light (>700 nm), and then emit shorter wavelength light (390–564 nm) as a result of up-conversion, which in turn further excites Cu2O to form electron/hole (e−/h+) pairs (Fig. 4c (2)).11 The electron/hole pairs then react with the adsorbed oxidants/reducers (usually O2/OH−) to produce active oxygen radicals (e.g. ˙O2, ˙OH), which subsequently cause the degradation of organic dye (MB).4,8–10,28 Significantly, when CQDs are attached to the surface of Cu2O, the relative position of the CQDs band edge permits the transfer of electrons from the Cu2O surface, allowing the charge separation, stabilization, and then hindering e−/h+ pairs' recombination.11,18,29 The electrons can be shuttled freely along the conducting network of CQDs, and the longer-lived holes on the Cu2O then account for the higher activity of the composite photocatalyst.11,18,29 In addition, the degradation rate of MB over the composite CQDs/Cu2O showed a great decrease in the presence of benzoquinone or ethanol (Fig. S7†), which are scavengers of active oxygen radicals (such as ˙O2, ˙OH or ˙O2−),30,31 clearly indicating the involvement of active oxygen radicals in the MB degradation process and proving that the degradation of MB is not the effect of photobleaching. Finally, for organic pollution degradation, the p–p interaction between the conjugated structure of CQDs and the benzene ring of MB is beneficial to the enrichment of MB on the surface of the CQDs/Cu2O composite.27 To date, some efforts have been devoted to developing visible-light photocatalysts and (N)IR sensitive sensors, but studies on (N)IR photocatalysts are far less than for visible-light photocatalysts. The research on (N)IR photocatalysts is not only meaningful for fundamental catalytic studies, but it is also significant for other related new energy areas, such as the photovoltaic industry, photobiochemistry, etc.
To demonstrate the correlation between the photocatalytic activity of the CQDs/Cu2O composite and excitation light, we examined the photocatalytic behaviors of the CQDs/Cu2O composite under different light irradiations (UV, visible and (N)IR light, (N)IR light). During the photodegradation process, the probe was irradiated with four different light sources: UV light (18 W, 150 W, UV lamp), visible and (N)IR light (150 W, 400 W halogen lamp, using cutoff filters to remove light of λ < 400 nm and suitable attenuation slices to control the power of light), (N)IR light (150 W, 400 W halogen lamp, using cutoff filters to remove light of λ < 700 nm and suitable attenuation slices to control the power of light). UV-vis absorption spectra of samples were then measured at regular intervals of 30 min to monitor the reaction. As shown in the comparison data displayed in Fig. 5a, the photocatalytic ability of the CQDs/Cu2O composite under (N)IR light irradiation (150 W) is lower than the other two control experiments (under 150 W UV light, visible and (N)IR light), but remarkably higher than the other control experiment using 18 W UV light as irradiation light. Then it can be concluded that the CQDs/Cu2O composite really and truly realizes the efficient usage of the full spectrum of sunlight. Fig. 5b shows digital images of MB solutions after different times of (N)IR light irradiation, Fig. S8† displays the digital results of two contrast samples under UV light (18 W, 240 min) and UV light (150 W, 120 min).
 Fig. 5  (a) Photocatalytic degradation of MB in the presence of the CQDs/Cu2O composite irradiated by four different light sources: UV light (18 and 150 W), visible and (N)IR light (150 W, 400 W halogen lamp, using cutoff filters to remove light of λ < 400 nm and attenuation slices to control the power of light), (N)IR light (150 W, 400 W halogen lamp, using cutoff filters to remove light of λ < 700 nm and suitable attenuation slices to control the power of light); (b) digital images of MB solutions under (N)IR light irradiation for different times (0, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min). 
Notably, in the present system, the loading amount of CQDs can affect the photocatalytic properties of CQDs/Cu2O. The photocatalytic degradation ability of CQDs/Cu2O on MB reaches the highest (about 90% degradation) rate with a CQDs loading amount of 7.16 wt%. However, on further increasing the loading amount of CQDs to 8.31 wt%, the degradation rate of MB decreased to 88% (Table S1† and Fig. S9†). This should be attributed to the fact that surplus CQDs can block the electron/hole pairs from reacting with the adsorbed oxidants/reducers (usually O2/OH−) to produce active oxygen radicals (e.g. ˙O2, ˙OH).
A practical photocatalyst should be stable enough for repeated applications. Some photocatalysts, such as the N-doped TiO2 and sulfide photocatalysts, sometimes suffer from instability under repeated use.32,33 To test the repeatability of MB bleaching on the CQDs/Cu2O composite, we carried out the bleaching experiment repeatedly ten times. As shown in Fig. 6, the MB dye is quickly bleached after every injection of the MB solution, and the CQDs/Cu2O photocatalyst is stable under repeated application with nearly a constant photodecomposition rate. Thus, the CQDs/Cu2O composite is an effective and stable photocatalyst under (N)IR light.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel CQDs/Cu2O composite photocatalyst with efficient (N)IR activity was successfully synthesized by an easy, low-cost, green and one-step ultrasonic method. This composite has an efficient (N)IR photocatalytic activity based on the combined effect of superior light reflecting ability of the Cu2O protruding nanostructures and the up-converted PL property of CQDs. As mentioned above, UV light only accounts for 4% of sunlight, so (N)IR light sensitive photocatalysts will be a developing trend in photocatalysis and will become gradually an urgent challenge for chemistry and materials science. We therefore expect that our findings will stimulate further fundamental work and development in preparation of (N)IR-sensitive photocatalysts, which may significantly push research in current environmental pollution, energy issues and other related areas.
