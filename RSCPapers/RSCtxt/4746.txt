    , Accepted 27th March 2017First published on 30th March 2017AbstractThe influence of co-deposited transition metals X (X = Ta, W, Nb) with various relative concentrations on the photoelectrochemical performance of BiVO4 is investigated. Thin film material libraries with well-defined composition gradients of Bi, V and two transition metals are fabricated by combinatorial sputter co-deposition. Materials with the highest photoelectrochemical performance are identified by high-throughput characterization of the Bi(V–Mo–X)O4 material libraries using an optical scanning droplet cell. Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 and Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4 material libraries show the highest improvement in the photocurrent, with ten times higher photocurrents of up to 1 mA cm−2 compared to a BiVO4 reference material library. Deviations from the V:Bi equiatomic ratio lead to a decrease in the photocurrent for pristine monoclinic BiVO4. By the addition of transition metals this effect is minimized and no significant decrease in the photocurrent occurs up to 10 at% variation from the equiatomic V:Bi ratio. Excellent photoelectrochemical performance is reached under these conditions in regions with a V:Bi atomic ratio of 70:30 and co-deposited Nb concentrations of >10 at%. Scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy allows the evaluation of the correlation between the generated oxygen at a photoanode and the measured photocurrent.

Broader context
Using sunlight as an alternative energy source to produce hydrogen from water is probably the holy grail in the field of sustainable energy conversion and storage. BiVO4 has been shown to be a promising material with absorption in the visible part of the solar spectrum. However, the poor electron transfer kinetics within the BiVO4 film results in low efficiencies. Transition metals are added to increase the photoelectrochemical performance. Systematic studies on Bi(V–Mo–X)O4 material libraries are performed to analyze the influence of two simultaneously added transition metals (Mo + Nb, Ta or W) with respect to the Bi:V atomic ratio. New material compositions with up to 10 times higher photocurrents as compared to pristine BiVO4, even in V-rich regions, are found on the Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4 library. By means of in situ scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM) oxygen is detected under local illumination on material libraries with composition gradients. This provides insights into material decomposition and the produced oxygen from water splitting in alkaline media.

Introduction
A high-throughput accelerated search for stable semiconductor materials possessing a low band gap and long lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers is essential to identify and optimize suitable materials for solar water splitting applications.1–4 For the kinetically more hindered and rate-determining oxygen evolution reaction (OER), BiVO4 is considered a promising material,5–8 due to its band gap of 2.4 eV.3,9–11 However, its photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance is limited by poor electronic conductivity resulting in high recombination rates of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.12–17 Incorporation of transition metal atoms, such as W3,18–20 or Mo,21–23 into the VO4-tetrahedron lattice is a promising approach for improving the electronic conductivity of BiVO4-based materials. This effect is based on a decreased recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers resulting in higher photocurrents. Increased charge separation is due to the enhanced electronic conductivity induced by incorporating these additional metals into the lattice. An increased incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was reported by Park et al. upon combining Bi–V–W–O with a second metal.24 From screening of different metals while maintaining a constant V:Bi ratio, the highest PEC improvement was obtained for W–Mo containing films as compared to W–BiVO4 films. Further, Berglund et al. reported the highest photocurrent enhancement in monoclinic BiVO4 films containing 6 at% Mo and 2 at% W prepared by evaporation of Bi, V, Mo and W.25
In order to maximize the PEC performance of BiVO4, a large quantity of well-defined and comparable samples need to be investigated to optimize the concentration of the additional transition metals. The high number of possible combinations of four different elements requires an efficient and reproducible preparation technique with precise control of the concentration of each element. Methods such as metal–organic-decomposition including spin-coating or drop-coating17,26–28 result in the formation of homogeneous films; however, varying the concentration of transition metals incorporated into BiVO4 is difficult. On the other hand, using electrodeposition a control of the V:Bi ratio, the concentration of the potential additional element, the particle size and film thickness is difficult to realize29,30 preventing the use of these techniques for the preparation of samples. Chen et al. reported reactive sputter deposition of uniform BiVO4 on indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrates with post-annealing and observed an increase in the photocurrent for a near-equiatomic V:Bi ratio with a slight excess of V.31 In addition, the influence of Mo-content varied between 1 at% and 5.5 at% with a constant V:Bi ratio was analyzed with respect to the PEC performance of sputtered BiVO4.32 Another approach was based on a KOH treatment to remove impurities after annealing, thus reaching higher photocurrents.33 Moreover, a post-hydrogen treatment can increase the crystallinity resulting in higher photocurrent densities.34 Pihosh et al. demonstrated that a thin layer of sputtered BiVO4 on WO3 nanowires enhances the overall PEC performance.35
We report for the first time a combinatorial material science approach1,36,37 together with high-throughput assessment techniques38,39 to elucidate the relation between systematic variations in composition, process parameters, microstructure and functionality utilizing thin film material libraries (MLs) of BiVO4 based materials. Magnetron sputter deposition is used for the fabrication of MLs, which allows the analysis of a large quantity of well-defined compositions. In this way, the influence of two co-deposited transition metals in dependence on the V:Bi ratio on the PEC performance is studied. Based on DFT calculations performed by Yin et al., Mo was found to be the most promising transition metal for the substitution of V sites to increase the conductivity as it narrows the pinning of the Fermi level as compared to W.40 Therefore, in our studies Mo was selected as a fixed element for the co-deposition process. Further DFT calculations of Zhao et al. suggested an enhancement of the PEC efficiency by the insertion of Nb into the lattice.41,42 To the best of our knowledge, the effect of Nb on the PEC response regarding the OER has not been confirmed by experiments until now. Therefore, in the present work, the PEC performance of co-deposited Bi(V–Mo–X)O4 (X = Ta, W, Nb) MLs was investigated. We report systematic studies leading to an improvement of the PEC performance of BiVO4 due to the addition of two transition metals simultaneously, namely Mo/Ta and Mo/Nb. Time-consuming sample-by-sample fabrication and characterization24,31,32,43,44 was prevented by utilizing a previously described optical scanning droplet cell2,45 for automated and rapid PEC screening of the MLs. The increase in the photocurrent in the presence of the additional transition metals as compared to the pristine BiVO4 ML is discussed with respect to the morphology and crystal structure at characteristic material compositions. Further, detection of produced oxygen at a photoabsorber under illumination is essential to draw conclusions about the photodecomposition of a material. By using scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM),18 local illumination and in situ detection of the oxygen evolved at the ML is introduced for the first time as a high-throughput screening method, allowing a correlation between the photocurrent and the generated oxygen under local illumination for defined material compositions.
Experimental part
Sample fabrication
Bi(V–Mo–X)O4 thin film MLs were fabricated by magnetron sputter deposition in a load-locked high vacuum sputter system (AJA International, USA) at a base pressure of <5.8 × 10−8 Torr. The deposition was performed on a square-shaped 7.5 cm × 7.5 cm fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate by using a co-deposition process from Bi2O3 (purity 99.95%), V (purity 99.9%), Mo (purity 99.9%), W (purity 99.99%), Nb (purity 99.95%) and Ta (purity 99.995%) targets. In order to achieve well-defined composition variations, the targets were confocally positioned at an inclination angle of α ≈ 45° with respect to the substrate normal, while the FTO substrate was held stationary. The depositions were performed at a constant pressure of 5 m Torr with a continuous Ar gas flow of 40 sccm. In the cylindrical deposition chamber, the azimuthal angle between the four sputter targets was 90°. The V and Mo targets were positioned opposing each other, while the Bi2O3 target was fixed between them. This target arrangement was kept constant for the co-deposition process together with X (X: W, Nb and Ta), where the X target was attached on the opposite side of the Bi2O3 target. Fig. 1 shows the target positions used to fabricate the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML. Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the sputter power for the deposition of the MLs. After deposition, all MLs were annealed in air at 500 °C for 4 h. The heating rate was adjusted to ∼15 °C min−1 and after heating the MLs were cooled to room temperature. The whole synthesis equipment is designed and controlled such that high reproducibility and repeatability are achieved for multinary material library systems.39,47,48 Furthermore, due to the fact that the libraries have a continuous almost linear composition gradient, all compositions within a targeted compositional area are present and the samples are very well comparable.

Black dots indicate the measurement areas. 
Material characterization
The annealed MLs were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Leo 1530VP) at 2–15 kV acceleration voltage. SEM images were obtained at all 255 measurement areas on each ML. Elemental composition mapping was performed using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (INCA x-act OXFORD Instruments) at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV with an aperture of 30 μm. The composition mapping was performed on 255 measurement areas (measurement grid of spacing 4.5 mm × 4.5 mm) over the 7.5 cm × 7.5 cm material library. In order to calculate the composition of a particular measurement area V was normalized against Bi to obtain the V:Bi ratio. O was not considered during EDX analysis. For convenience, the elemental composition of a measurement region is described as (BiaV1−a)100−x−yMoxXy in at%. The accuracy of the EDX measurements was about 1 at%, and the composition values of each measurement region are rounded to the nearest number. Concentrations below 1% are denoted as 0 at%.
Crystallographic analysis of the MLs was carried out using an automated X-ray diffraction (XRD) system (X'Pert PRO PANalytical, Bragg–Brentano geometry; Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation) with a measurement grid spacing of 4.5 mm × 4.5 mm. The area illuminated by the X-ray beam (2θ dependent) was of elliptical shape with a size of ∼3 mm × 3 mm. The identified phases are based on data from “Pearson's Crystal Data” database (BiVO4 – #1411659), (Bi2VO5 – #1520408). The XRD-viewer software developed for high-throughput XRD assessment49 was used for the phase analysis and to plot relative intensity maps of the MLs.
Raman spectra were recorded using a Jobin-Yvon iHR550 spectrometer using a 532 nm Ventus laser (2 mW).
PEC measurements with the OSDC
High-throughput PEC characterization was performed using an OSDC with an automated electrolyte exchange system described in detail elsewhere.45 Into the measuring cell, which was fixed on x–y–z-stepper motors, a quartz light fiber with a diameter of 1 mm was introduced, including a Pt wire counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl reference electrode. The light reached the ML through the front opening of a 1 mm diameter Teflon tip. A 150 W Hg–Xe-lamp (Hamamatsu, Japan) served as the light source with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The library was characterized in the x- and y-directions with an increment of at least 4 mm in 0.1 M Na2B4O7·4H2O (Sigma Aldrich, >99.5% purity) buffer. To avoid leakage of the electrolyte caused by the hydrophilicity of the ML and to improve the kinetics of O2 evolution, the pH value was adjusted to 9. At each point a LSV was recorded in the potential range from −0.2 V to 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl) with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The shutter was opened and closed for 5 s each. The photocurrent was calculated by subtracting the dark current from the current measured under illumination. The applied potential (Eapplied) was calculated against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to E (mV, RHE) = 210 mV + Eapplied + (59 × pH).
Detection of oxygen with SPECM
A double junction Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl electrode was utilized as the reference electrode and a large Pt-mesh was used as the counter electrode ensuring a non-limiting electrode reaction. The 7.5 cm × 7.5 cm ML was placed in a flat dish and connected with Cu wires, which were insulated against the solution. The cell was completely filled with the same electrolyte used for the OSDC measurements. The sample was polarized during the whole measurement at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). For local detection of evolved oxygen, a microelectrode fabricated using a 25 μm ∅ Pt-wire (Goodfellow, Germany) was used. A 150 W Hg–Xe-lamp light source was coupled to the microelectrode by means of a light fiber (HITRONIC® POF Simplex PE), using the glass capillary of the microelectrode to focalize the radiation on the investigated surface. Light with an approximate intensity of 280 mW cm−2 reached the sample. The microelectrode was fixed on an x-, y- and z-positioning system and the area scan was performed in the x, y plane. The grid for a surface scan was predefined to 1 mm for both x- and y-increments. The z-distance was corrected at each measurement point using a previously calculated tilt plane for the analyzed sample. During the scan, the Pt-microelectrode was polarized at −0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl) to reduce oxygen produced by the photoabsorber during illumination. The currents measured at the ML and at the tip were corrected by means of the current detected in the dark without irradiation.
Results and discussion
Fabrication and characterization of material libraries (MLs)
Evidently, the complex interplay between material composition, morphology and crystal structure is the core question to be answered. Since material composition, morphology and crystal structure cannot be independently controlled during the synthesis of the material libraries we carefully controlled the composition during materials library fabrication and examined the morphology and crystal structure for each composition using automatic SEM and XRD.
Elemental composition
The co-deposition of Bi(V–Mo–X)O4 thin film MLs was realized with the sputter target arrangement indicated in Fig. 1a. The co-deposition was performed on rectangular FTO substrates from Bi2O3, V, Mo and X targets. The location of the targets for the pristine BiVO4 ML and of the second transition metal (X = Nb or Ta) are shown in addition in Fig. S1–S3 (ESI†). The combinatorial deposition with this target arrangement resulted in a variation of the layer thickness, which is indicated in Fig. 1 at the four corners of the ML. For all MLs, a significant increase of the layer thickness from the upper left corner to the bottom left corner was observed, for instance from 257 nm to 687 nm on the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML (Fig. 1a). The increase of the layer thickness on the right side of the ML was around 100 nm.
EDX analysis was performed to determine the elemental concentration of Bi, V, Mo and W on the ML (Fig. 1b–d). The V:Bi atomic ratio is known to have a major impact on the PEC performance31 and therefore it was calculated for each ML with respect to the V concentration (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). For instance, the atomic ratio of V:Bi in the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML varied from 79:21 to 30:70 (Fig. 1b), while the concentration of Mo and W (Fig. 1c and d) varied from 0.5 at% to 5.2 at% and 3.8 at% to 35.5 at%, respectively. All MLs including the pristine BiVO4 ML with no additional transition metals exhibited a similar trend of the equiatomic ratio of V:Bi along the diagonal, as displayed in Fig. 1b and Fig. S1–S3 (ESI†). An excess of V (V:Bi >70:30) was reached in the upper left corner of the coordinate system, while the V:Bi atomic ratio decreased to 30:70 at the bottom right corner of the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML (Fig. 1b). For other MLs the Mo concentration increased up to 8.5 at%, on the right side of the ML, while the concentration of Ta and Nb varied from 4 at% to 28 at% and 2.8 at% to 19 at% respectively (Fig. S2d and S3d, ESI†).
Structural characterization
The crystal structure of BiVO4 also has an impact on the PEC performance. The monoclinic scheelite structure was reported as the phase with the best photoelectrocatalytic properties.6,8 XRD analysis was performed on all MLs to investigate possible changes of the crystal structure with compositional variations and to analyze if additional transition metal oxide phases were formed.7,19,21,46 The latter ones were reported to act as recombination centers for photogenerated charge carriers, thus decreasing the PEC performance accordingly.27,28 In Fig. S4 (ESI†) the XRD patterns are summarized for the material compositions at each corner of the four different MLs. The monoclinic scheelite type structure was present in all regions of the MLs, even in the presence of high relative concentrations of additional transition metals (Fig. S4a and b, ESI†). Park et al.24 reported a shift of the characteristic monoclinic peak at 2θ = 28.87° upon insertion of Mo into the BiVO4 lattice using the metal–organic decomposition method, which led to a deformation of the monoclinic structure and a change in crystal symmetry from monoclinic to tetragonal.23 Here, the co-deposited MLs did not exhibit any shift of the 28.87° diffraction angle in the presence of additional transition metals. This coincides with the results of Mo-doped BiVO4 and Mo–W co-doped BiVO4 thin films prepared by means of sputter deposition on FTO, for which also no peak shift was reported.25,32 The XRD patterns in the V-rich regions of the ML with high concentrations of W, Nb or Ta (Fig. S4a, ESI†) did not show any additional peaks, which indicate the formation of transition metal oxides such as tungsten or vanadium oxide. However, the interaction with the FTO substrate and the possible overlapping of monoclinic BiVO4 peaks complicate a clear assignment. Most probably, the transition metals are fully integrated into the BiVO4 lattice and the formation of transition metal oxides was avoided during sputter co-deposition. Moreover, diffraction peaks of Bi2VO5 were detected in the Bi-rich regions of all MLs (Fig. S4d, ESI†).31,47
By combining information on crystallinity, layer thickness, and material composition, color-coded relative intensity maps of the BiVO4(112) peak were created by plotting the intensity of the characteristic monoclinic peaks observed at 2θ = 28.87° over the physical coordinates of all MLs (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Color-coded map of the relative intensity of the characteristic monoclinic BiVO4 XRD peak at a diffraction angle of 2θ = 28.87° for the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML. 
The region with an equiatomic ratio of V:Bi shows the highest relative intensity of this characteristic peak for all MLs (Fig. S5, ESI†). With increasing transition metal concentration the relative intensity of the characteristic peak decreased, which can be attributed to a decrease in crystallinity. High relative intensity was therefore observed in regions with low transition metal concentration and a V:Bi atomic ratio close to 50:50. SEM images (Fig. S6, ESI†) were acquired at locations along the diagonal, starting at regions with high relative intensity (Fig. 2 and Fig. S5, ESI†). With increasing W and Mo concentration the particle density decreased substantially, which correlates with the relative intensity map of the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML. The same correlation of the morphology and relative XRD intensity were observed along the diagonal of the equiatomic V:Bi ratio on the Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4 ML (Fig. S5 and Fig. S6, ESI†). The addition of Mo–Nb and Mo–W decreased the roughness of the film. This change in the grain size with a higher amount of transition metals coincides with the observation of Chen et al., who reported an increase in the grain size with increasing Mo content from 1 at% to 3 at%.32 In contrast, starting at the left corner of the BiVO4 reference ML, the grain size decreased along the diagonal of equiatomic V:Bi ratio (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The highest roughness was present in the upper left region of this ML. No distinguishable variations in the roughness or grain size were observed for the Bi(V–Mo–Ta)O4 ML (Fig. S6b, ESI†).
No variation of the monoclinic scheelite structure was recognized in the presence of additional transition metals in the XRD patterns. Raman spectroscopy offers a more sensitive method to detect changes in the metal–oxygen bond length upon insertion of Nb, Mo, W or Ta into the lattice. In Fig. 3, the expected Raman bands for monoclinic BiVO442,48 at 328, 370, 710 and 829 cm−1 are shown for all corners of the different MLs. Merupo et al.23 reported a shift to lower wave numbers of the symmetric V–O stretching mode upon replacement of V by Mo in the VO4 tetrahedron.
 Fig. 3  Selected parts of Raman spectra at each corner of all MLs. In V-rich regions (a) a shift of the stretching mode (829 cm−1) is observed only on the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML. At V:Bi close to 50:50, at high (b) and low (c) transition metal concentrations, a peak shift to lower wave numbers is recognized compared to the reference BiVO4. Additionally, merging of the peak at 328 cm−1 and 369 cm−1 is observed. In Bi-rich regions, a broad peak at 848 cm−1 is detected indicating Bi2VO5 (d). 
This higher stretching frequency was attributed to a shorter metal-bond length. According to eqn (1), reported by Thalluri et al.,42 the bond length changed in these MLs between 1.6941 Å (Fig. 3a) and 1.7023 Å (Fig. 3d) in the presence of additional transition metals (Nb, Mo, W and Ta). ν (cm−1) = 21349exp(−1.9176r (Å))(1)In our previous work, we demonstrated a merging of the bands at 328 and 370 cm−1 into a single peak upon insertion of Mo into the lattice.30 This effect was recognized in regions with a V:Bi atomic ratio close to 50:50 (Fig. 3b and c). For Bi(V–Mo–Ta)O4 and Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4 no shift of the stretching mode at 829 cm−1 was observed in Bi-rich regions (Fig. 3a) compared to the BiVO4 ML. Moreover, no merging of the symmetric and asymmetric deformation mode was recognized except for the MLs containing Mo and W. In these cases, a decrease in the stretching mode to 824 cm−1 was observed. Assuming no co-deposition of Mo at this point of the Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4 and Bi(V–Mo–Ta)O4 MLs, these results indicate that the bond length is solely changed by a replacement of V with Mo or W, while insertion of Nb and Ta, having the same number of valence electrons as V, does not affect the bond length. In contrast, in V-rich regions (Fig. 3d), the Raman band of the symmetric V–O stretching mode shifted from 829 cm−1 to a broader band of 849 cm−1. In combination with XRD, these bands indicated the presence of a Bi2VO5 phase, which is in agreement with the work of Barreca et al.48 For the other MLs, the stretching mode is shifted to lower wave numbers with lower intensity as compared to the other regions. The Mo–O–Mo stretching mode might overlap the signal of the Bi2VO5 stretching mode. In Fig. 3c and d, a Raman band at 870 cm−1 was observed, which is attributed to the Mo–O–Mo stretching mode and confirmed a replacement of V by Mo.23 No bands that correspond to transition metal oxides such as MoO3, Nb2O3, WO3 or Ta2O3 were present in the Raman spectra (Fig. S7, ESI†) even at high concentrations (Fig. S7a, ESI†). The Raman band at 1000 cm−1 observed in some spectra might indicate the presence of VO2.48,49
Photoelectrochemical performance

High-throughput screening of MLs. 
An optical scanning droplet cell (OSDC) with an integrated light fiber and an electrolyte exchange system was utilized to evaluate the PEC performance of all MLs by recording automatically a linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) with chopped light at each measurement area of the ML. The photocurrent was obtained by subtracting the dark current from the current measured under illumination. In Fig. 4 the PEC performance of all MLs is summarized at a selected potential of 1.23 V (vs. RHE).
 Fig. 4  Color-coded maps of the photocurrent measured with the OSDC for BiVO4 (a), Bi(V–Mo–Ta)O4 (b), Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 (c), and Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4 (d) MLs prepared by magnetron sputter deposition in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH = 9) at a bias potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE. Black dots represent the measurement areas. 
The pristine BiVO4 ML (Fig. 4a) exhibited its highest photocurrents with the V:Bi ratio close to 50:50 with a local maximum in regions with a small grain size (Fig. S5, ESI†). The overall photocurrent of this pristine ML was the lowest of all MLs. Increased photocurrents were measured for the ML with Mo and Ta, with a maximum of 0.5 mA cm−2 with <1 at% of Mo, 6 at% of Ta and a V:Bi ratio close to 55:45 (Fig. 4b). Enhanced photocurrents for the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML were reached along the diagonal with an equiatomic V:Bi atomic ratio with the highest photocurrents of up to 1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4c). These maximum photocurrent density regions coincided with the relative XRD intensity variation of the BiVO4(112) peak as presented in Fig. 2. Besides this, morphology changes (Fig. S6, ESI†) in coherence with the concentration of the additional transition metals (Fig. 1) might influence the PEC performance along the diagonal, resulting in a decrease of the photocurrents in regions with high concentrations of Mo and W and a low relative diffraction intensity (upper right corner). The highest PEC performance was therefore observed for regions with the highest nanocrystalline structure, near equiatomic V:Bi ratio and lower transition metal concentration.
Nevertheless, V-rich (>70 normalized at% of V) and Bi-rich (<30 normalized at% of V) areas revealed photocurrents below 0.3 mA cm−2, which is higher than those of the pristine BiVO4 ML. Correspondingly, the ML with Mo and Nb exhibited a similar behavior in the area with a V:Bi atomic ratio close to 50:50, where the photocurrents increased to up to 1.2 mA cm−2 at low Mo (<1 at%) and Nb concentrations (around 5 at%). In contrast, low PEC performance was noticed in the Bi-rich region of all MLs, which was attributed to the formation of the Bi2VO5 phase (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4, ESI†). The photocurrent decreased in V-rich areas (V:Bi > 70:30) below 0.2 mA cm−2 on MLs with Mo–W and Mo–Ta composition gradients. In contradiction to this, in V-rich areas on the Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4 ML no decrease in the photocurrent was observed as compared to the equiatomic V:Bi ratio, and photocurrents up to 1 mA cm−2 were reached with a V:Bi atomic ratio of >70:30 and Nb concentrations of >10 at%.
The film thickness can additionally influence the PEC performance, but is not discussed in detail here. The change in the photocurrent especially in this V-rich region was attributed to the addition of Nb, because the variations of the layer thickness of Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 and Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4 were similar. Moreover, the concentration of the transition metals in this region (W >30 at% and Nb >10 at%) might be a reason for the difference in the PEC performance. To study the influence of the material composition on the water oxidation performance, LSVs of the four corners of all MLs are compared in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Photocurrents close to zero were observed for the reference BiVO4 ML in both V-rich and Bi-rich areas (Fig. S9a and d, ESI†). In contrast, the addition of Mo and Nb (Fig. S9a, ESI†) increased the photocurrent to up to 1 mA cm−2 around a bias potential of 1.0 V vs. RHE in V-rich areas with high concentration of Nb ((Bi0.28V0.78)88Mo0Nb12). The photocurrent of Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 and Bi(V–Mo–Ta)O4 MLs increased to up to 0.2 mA cm−2 at the same bias potential in this region. Bi-rich areas generated the lowest photocurrents, observing the best performance for ML with added Mo and W under these conditions (Fig. S8d, ESI†) attributed to the presence of the Bi2VO5 phase. The highest photocurrents were obtained at the corner with low concentrations of Mo and X (X = Ta, W or Nb) and an atomic ratio of V:Bi close to 50:50 (Fig. S8c, ESI†). Another parameter addressing the influence of the added transition metals is related to the applied bias potential. Particularly, the photocurrent onset potential shifted to higher anodic values in Bi-rich areas of all MLs. A lower anodic bias potential for light induced water splitting indicates a shift of the Fermi level upwards to more negative potentials (vs. NHE) resulting in a higher band bending after thermodynamic equilibration in contact with the electrolyte and improved charge carrier separation.53 As a consequence less external energy is required to split water.54 In addition, the incorporation of an additional transition metal increases the charge carrier density by enhancing the electrical conductivity and mobility of these charge carriers, if the insertion of the additional element into the lattices affects the shape of the electronic band structures and reduces the effective number of holes on top of the VB.41 As discussed previously, the XRD pattern showed the presence of Bi2VO5 only in Bi-rich regions, but did not clearly indicate the presence of transition metal oxides or vanadium oxides whereas Raman analysis indicated the presence of VO2 (Fig. S7b and d, ESI†). The dark current of the LSV measurements, detected during the time when the shutter was closed, can provide some information about the possible reduction/oxidation processes at the surface, e.g., V4+ oxidation49 or oxidation of transition metal oxides such as MoO327 and WO3. The dark current on the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML across the V-concentration gradient from the upper left corner to the upper right corner with a W concentration of >20 at% shows an oxidation peak at 0.75 V (vs. RHE) (Fig. S9a, ESI†). The peak decreased with decreasing V-concentration from a V:Bi atomic ratio of 79:21 and is not detected at a V:Bi atomic ratio of 48:52. A change in the V-concentration and the W-concentration simultaneously (upper left corner to bottom left corner) resulted in the same decrease in the oxidation peak (Fig. S9c, ESI†). LSVs of the reference BiVO4 ML without additional transition metals starting from the V-rich region to the V:Bi ratio close to 50:50 in both directions of the MLs (Fig. S9b and d, ESI†) indicated the same decrease in the oxidation peak at 0.75 V (vs. RHE) upon changing the V:Bi atomic ratio. Thus, this oxidation peak is attributed to the oxidation of V4+ to V5+. Supposedly, during sputter deposition, VO2 is formed, although the favored formation of V2O5 was reported at an annealing temperature of 500 °C.33,50 The formation of VO2 next to the high W-concentration can be a reason for the lower photocurrents in V-rich regions on the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML. A high transition metal concentration decreases the space charge region resulting in less charge carrier separation.51 Nevertheless, the results of the LSV in combination with XRD and Raman analysis indicate that even at high transition metal concentrations no oxides (e.g., WO3, MoO3) are formed. Furthermore, in the presence of transition metals the photocurrent was still improved in the presence of Bi2VO5 phases as compared to Bi-rich regions on the pristine BiVO4 ML.
From wavelength-dependent photocurrent spectroscopy the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE, Fig. S10, ESI†) was calculated for material compositions with the highest PEC performance identified from OSDC scans (Fig. 4). In agreement with the results in Fig. 4, the highest improvement of up to 26% was observed for Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4, while the lowest IPCE values below 2% were detected for the pristine BiVO4 ML. Recently, we demonstrated a good relation between band-gap determination from IPCE and UV-Vis measurements for Mo-doped BiVO4.30 Assuming an indirect band-to-band transition, the band gaps determined from the IPCE values do not show a relevant influence on the band gap caused by the addition of transition metals. The band gap was calculated for all MLs to be 2.34 eV with the selected material compositions with a near equiatomic Bi:V ratio. These results are in agreement with the Raman and XRD analysis, which do not exhibit any change in the crystal structure. Moreover, the change in the bond length shown with Raman analysis (Fig. 3) supports the assumption of an improved charge transfer by the insertion of the transition metals into the monoclinic BiVO4 lattice resulting in a distortion of the lattice. In agreement with the findings of Seabold et al. with respect to Mo:BiVO446 and according to DFT calculations of Park et al.24 a possible explanation for the observed increase in the PEC performance in the presence of the added transition metals can be an improved electron transport to the back contact during front-side illumination due to a decreased activation energy for polaron hopping via preferably formed V4+ centers assuming a localization of the transition metals at the V-atom.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements on the MLs supported the possible formation of V4+ centers (Fig. S12, ESI†) which might be the reason for improved electron transfer and higher PEC performance. In the presence of two added transition metals, a significant deviation from the ideal capacitor-type behaviour was recognized. In particular, at low frequencies diffusion limited processes were observed (Warburg behavior) indicating a bulk V4+ to V5+ oxidation in the dark (see the ESI† for details).


In situ detection of oxygen
In order to determine the Faradaic efficiency of the OER at semiconductors under illumination, usually on-line detection of oxygen is applied using gas chromatography or mass spectrometry.26,52 However, both methods do not allow direct O2 detection close to the semiconductor surface during illumination. For local detection of O2 during localized illumination of the thin film MLs with composition gradients, a scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM) set-up was used operated in the sample generation/tip collection mode. The molecular oxygen produced at the photoabsorber under illumination was directly detected at the closely positioned Pt-microelectrode by electrochemical reduction of O2.18,20,24 The sample photocurrent was simultaneously recorded as the difference of the sample current under irradiation and in the dark, while the tip current was corrected by the background current in the dark. The screening of the MLs was performed with an increment of 1 mm in the x- and y-directions corresponding to 14 times the number of data points increased as compared to the OSDC measurements. The color-coded map of the photocurrent recorded using SPECM of the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML (Fig. 5) shows that the same regions as expected from the OSDC measurements exhibit the highest photocurrents with the highest photocurrents detected close to the diagonal with a near-equiatomic V:Bi ratio.
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent (a) and tip current (b) of the Mo–W–BiVO4 ML determined using SPECM with a 25 μm Pt-microelectrode and a connected light fiber in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH = 9) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The tip was polarized to −0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl) for O2 reduction. Correlation between the tip current and the photocurrent measured at the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML (c). The values were normalized by the maximum current detected at the tip and the sample, respectively. Colored points emphasize the different influence of the material composition. 
The lowest photocurrents under these conditions were obtained at Bi-rich areas with photocurrents <13 μA (Fig. 5a), corresponding to the photocurrents measured with the OSDC for the same region (Fig. 4). The tip current, which is proportional to the amount of O2 evolved at the sample surface, showed the highest reduction currents close to the diagonal of the V:Bi atomic ratio of 50:50, with slightly less O2 production with the SPECM tip positioned above the Mo-rich region (upper right corner of Fig. 5b). Using SPECM a decrease of the photocurrent was detected upon increasing the V:Bi atomic ratio to more than 60:40 or decreasing it to less than 40:60. In contrast to the work of Chen et al., who observed lower photocurrents for samples with 60 at% Bi and 60 at% V, respectively,31 no significant difference of the photocurrent was recognized in these composition regions. This was attributed to the addition of Mo and W.
To correlate the photocurrent measured at the illuminated semiconductor and the O2 reduction at the Pt-microelectrode, the normalized photocurrent at each x-, y-coordinate was plotted against the normalized tip current (Fig. 5c). This correlation between the tip current and the sample photocurrent varied depending on the material composition. In the ideal case, the normalized photocurrent and tip current have the same value. This was observed for instance in V-rich regions with W concentrations of around 31 at% and in the upper right part of the ML with W concentrations of around 10 at% and a V:Bi atomic ratio of 55:45. In Bi-rich areas low photocurrents (Fig. 5) were detected and nearly no oxygen was detected at the SPECM tip.
In general, the tip current was influenced by the diffusion of oxygen from the sample to the tip and the rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the SPECM tip. Lower normalized tip currents in comparison to sample currents may be observed, if the photogenerated oxygen does not reach the tip leading to a collection efficiency below 1. Evidently, this may be due to a high oxygen production rate and a diffusional loss to the bulk of the electrolyte or due to a very large tip-to-sample distance. Moreover, side products at the photoabsorber and photocorrosion could affect the anticipated ratio between collected oxygen and photocurrent. The latter was observed for a few material compositions, for instance at the nanocrystalline films on the Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 ML at the bottom left corner with V:Bi of 54:46, 1 at% of Mo and 8 at% of W (red color in Fig. 5c). The decomposition under illumination led to an increase in the conversion of oxygen at the tip, but to lower photocurrents measured at the ML. At most material compositions on this ML, the normalized sample current is higher compared to the normalized tip current, which results mainly from the higher radius of the illuminated area as compared to the size of the SPECM tip.
Conclusions
The influence of two co-deposited transition metals on the PEC performance of monoclinic BiVO4 was evaluated aiming at improved photoelectrocatalytic properties of such photoanodes. Simultaneously, by sputter co-deposition of thin film material libraries, the variation of the V:Bi atomic ratio and its impact on the photoelectrocatalytic activity in the presence and absence of additional transition metals were analyzed. A significant increase in the PEC performance was obtained in addition to the already well-established Mo–W insertion by simultaneous integration of Mo–Nb and Mo–Ta. The photocurrent measured at pristine BiVO4 was enhanced by about 5 to 12 times upon addition of Mo–Nb and Mo–Ta, respectively. A correlation between the V:Bi atomic ratio and the photocurrent was found. The highest photoelectrocatalytic activity was reached with a near-equiatomic V:Bi ratio, while V-rich and Bi-rich regions were nearly photocatalytically inactive. The addition of Mo–W, Mo–Nb and Mo–Ta increased the PEC performance for all V:Bi atomic ratios between 79:21 and 30:70. For Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 and Bi(V–Mo–Ta)O4 the highest photocurrents were observed at a near-equiatomic V:Bi ratio. The decrease of the photocurrent in Bi-rich regions (V:Bi >40:60) was attributed to the formation of Bi2VO5 and VO2. In V-rich regions (V:Bi >60:40) the photocurrent decreased with increasing W or Ta concentration on Bi(V–Mo–W)O4 or Bi(V–Mo–Ta)O4. Only upon addition of Nb >10 at% even at a V:Bi atomic ratio of >70:30 were excellent PEC performances reached with an excess of V.
Correlation between the photocurrent and the O2 production for different material compositions was demonstrated by means of scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM) allowing a focalized illumination and the localized detection of O2 at the positioned SPECM tip. Only a few material compositions were identified where photodecomposition occurred and a good stability at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) in alkaline media was demonstrated under illumination for most material compositions.

Broader context
Using sunlight as an alternative energy source to produce hydrogen from water is probably the holy grail in the field of sustainable energy conversion and storage. BiVO4 has been shown to be a promising material with absorption in the visible part of the solar spectrum. However, the poor electron transfer kinetics within the BiVO4 film results in low efficiencies. Transition metals are added to increase the photoelectrochemical performance. Systematic studies on Bi(V–Mo–X)O4 material libraries are performed to analyze the influence of two simultaneously added transition metals (Mo + Nb, Ta or W) with respect to the Bi:V atomic ratio. New material compositions with up to 10 times higher photocurrents as compared to pristine BiVO4, even in V-rich regions, are found on the Bi(V–Mo–Nb)O4 library. By means of in situ scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM) oxygen is detected under local illumination on material libraries with composition gradients. This provides insights into material decomposition and the produced oxygen from water splitting in alkaline media.
