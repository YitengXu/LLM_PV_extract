    , Accepted 15th May 2017First published on 16th May 2017AbstractIn this work, we describe the efficiency enhancement in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by using TiO2/silver nanoplate plasmonic nanocomposite photoanodes. The nanocomposite photoanodes with tunable plasmonic properties assembled from shape/size-selected silver (Ag) nanoplates were applied to enhance the light absorption for high-performance DSSCs. It was found that the localized surface plasmon resonance can be tuned over a range from 500 to 1000 nm, which is strongly dependent on the shape and size of Ag nanoplates and the refractive index of the surrounding dielectric. The effects of the size and shape of Ag nanoplates on the surface plasmonic resonance and the efficiency of DSSCs were evaluated experimentally. Furthermore, a three-dimensional finite element method was employed to investigate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) for the shape and size effect of Ag nanoplates.
1. Introduction
Solar energy is a widely known source of alternative energy. The use of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is one of the most promising approaches for the direct conversion of sun light to electricity at high efficiency with low cost, because of their potentially high efficiency and low cost fabrication processes.1–3 Furthermore, DSSCs have a variety of applications such as in windows or wearable electronic products due to their transparency and flexibility.4–6 DSSCs utilize sensitizing dyes adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) which absorbs sunlight in the ultraviolet region7 is one of the most prominent oxide materials for photovoltaic applications,8,9. The wide band gap of TiO2 limits its absorption to the ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum.10 Also, the low electron mobility of TiO2 leads to an inferior conversion efficiency of solar cells.11 For these reasons, many studies on the development of sensitizers have been conducted in order to enhance light harvesting in the visible light region.12,13 While the development of new dyes has led to continued improvements in the efficiency of DSSCs in recent years,14,15 they are still restricted by weak absorption of the dye sensitizer such as ruthenium(II) polypyridyl dyes (e.g. N719 and N749). N719 absorbs light strongly at 535 nm wavelength, but it drastically reduces extinction coefficients at longer wavelengths.16 Therefore, enhancing the light harvesting efficiency in the 300–900 nm wavelength range is considered as a favorable approach to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and photocurrent of these devices.17,18 It is well known that an effective method for trapping light or enhancing light harvesting to develop new photovoltaic devices is utilization of some noble metallic nanostructures with a high scattering cross section.19–24 It has been reported that metal nanoparticles such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag) can enhance the photoresponse of photovoltaic devices by acting as light trapping agents,25 photosensitizers,26 and electron traps for facilitating charge separation.27,28 These nanoparticles have a strong optical behavior in the visible region due to the surface plasmon resonance effect due to collective electron oscillation.29–31
In this work, we achieved a cooperative efficiency enhancement of 37% by incorporating the size-selected Ag nanoplate mixture into TiO2 photoanodes. It was demonstrated that the localized surface plasmon resonance can be tuned over a range from 500 to 1000 nm, which is strongly dependent on the shape and size of Ag nanoplates and the refractive index of the surrounding dielectric, while N719 dye molecules show absorption in 500–560 nm. The localized plasmon resonance enhanced the light harvesting efficiency of DSSCs.
The effects of the size (40–200 nm) and different weight fractions (wt%) of Ag nanoplates on the performance of DSSCs were studied experimentally and evaluated by using several microscopic and spectroscopic characterization techniques, including TEM, UV-vis, and EIS. Furthermore, finite element analysis was carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics software for an in-depth study on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Ag nanoplates with various shapes and sizes.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of silver nanoplates
All chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. For the synthesis of Ag nanoplates, 0.75 g poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution (25 mL) at room temperature and then 0.043 g AgNO3 was introduced in the mixture. After that, the glass vial was immediately sealed and heated at 150 °C for 5 h. With the heating time, the shape and the size of the Ag nanoplates could be controlled.32,33 As shown in Fig. 1, Ag nanoplates with an average width of ∼200 nm were obtained. The synthesized Ag nanoplates could be separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm several times. Finally, the product was redispersed in ethanol solution to obtain a stable suspension.

2.2. Fabrication and evaluation of nanocomposite DSSCs
The prepared Ag nanoplate solution was added to the TiO2 nanoparticle paste (Solaronix; 15–20 nm in diameter). To investigate the effect of Ag nanoplates on the efficiency of the DSSCs, the weight fractions of the Ag nanoplates were varied from 0.25 to 1.00 wt%. The prepared TiO2/Ag nanoplate composite paste was printed on a FTO glass (fluorine-doped tin oxide, SnO2:F; Pilkington) substrate and thermally sintered. Sandwich type DSSCs were assembled by using an N-719 dye-coated TiO2/Ag nanoplate composite photoanode and a Pt counter electrode. The electrodes were fitted together and sealed with a melting sheet (SX 1170-60, 60 μm-thick). Then the iodide-based redox electrolyte (Iodolyte AN-50, Solaronix) was injected through a hole in the cell to fill the gap between the two electrodes.
2.3. Characterization
A UV-visible spectrophotometer (S-4100, Scinco) was used to acquire the UV-vis spectra of the plasmonic nanocomposites. For the UV-vis measurements, the TiO2/Ag nanoplate composites were dispersed in an ethanol solution. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) observations were performed using a FEI Tecnai 20 operating at 200 kV (point resolution 2.4 Å, line resolution 1.44 Å). To confirm the ingredient of the nanocomposite films, elemental mapping was carried out at 200 keV and an electron spot size of 2.2 nm. The data were collected for 5 min. Incident photons to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed as a function of the wavelength ranging from 300 to 800 nm in the AC mode with a bias light. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained using an Ivium CompactStat impedance analyzer in the range of 0.01 Hz to 1.5 MHz. In order to obtain a J–V curve and measure the efficiency of the DSSCs, a digital sourcemeter (Keithley 2611A) was utilized under solar illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G).
2.4. Numerical simulation
For theoretical calculation, an electromagnetic simulation of Ag nanoplates was carried out using the COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2 wave optics module, which is a commercial finite element software package. The software was run on a 2.50 GHz (24 processors) Intel Xeon CPU with 32 Gb RAM. Fig. S1(a)† shows a three dimensional (3D) model, a single Ag nanoplate was placed on a center surrounded by an air layer. Also, a perfectly matched layer (PML) was additionally modeled on the air layer for prevention of backscattering from these boundaries. The radii of the air layer and PML were λ/2 and λ, respectively, where λ is the incident wavelength of light. The nanoplate was set as an equilateral triangle with the side length (l) from 60 nm to 180 nm, maintaining the thickness of 5 nm. The radius of curvature (r) at three nanoplate corners was varied from 10 nm to 26 nm to investigate the shape effect on the plasmon resonance wavelength (Fig. S1(b)†). The minimum mesh size was 3 nm around the nanoplate, and the maximum size of the air layer was one fifth of the wavelength.
By assuming a time-harmonic electric field, this model solves the electric field E(r,t) using Maxwell's equation (1):34 (1)where the constants μr and εr are the relative permeability and complex value of relative permittivity, respectively. The material properties of Ag were obtained from ref. 35 The electric field (i.e. incident light) was propagated through the z-direction with a peak amplitude of Ex = 1 V m−1 (see Fig. S1(a)†). Using parametric sweep analysis, the wavelength λ was varied from 350 nm to 1100 nm. To calculate the scattering energy, we used a well-known scattered field formula which is calculated by integrating the Poynting vector of the scattered field over the surface of the nanoplate.
3. Results and discussion
In the chemical reduction (2), triangular Ag nanoplates were selectively prepared by reducing AgNO3 in the presence of PVP and DMF. HCONMe2 (DMF) + 2Ag+ + H2O → 2Ag0 + Me2NCOOH + 2H+(2)
It was observed that the color of the Ag nanoplate colloid solutions were changed in the order of red, green, and gray over the chemical reduction time (Fig. 1(e)). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation indicates that initially small spheres were formed (Fig. 1(b)), followed by the assembly of the small spheres. A melting-like process occurred between the spheres, which led to crystalline particles with well-defined shapes. It was found that triangular nanoplates and spherical nanoparticles coexisted in the Ag colloid solution as shown in the TEM image (Fig. 1(c)). On increasing the chemical reduction time up to 5 hours, the formed triangular Ag nanoplates became larger and a wider variety of shapes were found as shown in Fig. 1(d). These findings correspond to previous studies related to the synthesis of silver nanoplates32 and nanoprisms.33 In order to investigate the relationship between the size, shape, and optical properties of the Ag nanoplates in depth, UV-vis absorption spectra of the Ag nanoplate colloidal solutions were measured. Fig. 1(e) shows that the colloidal solution with red color had peaks at 400 nm and 550 nm, the green one had peaks at 420 nm and 750 nm, and the gray one had peaks at 450 nm and 950 nm, respectively. Thus, it was demonstrated that the absorption peak shifted to a longer wavelength (called “red-shift”), as the size of the Ag nanoplates increased and the shape of the Ag nanoplates became more sharp (see inset figures in Fig. 1(e)). It was also found that the full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the absorbance peak broadened as the size of the Ag nanoplates increased. These phenomena of the red-shift and the broadening could be attributed to the dynamic depolarization36 and the radiation damping effect,37 respectively. Meanwhile, the peaks near 400 nm were derived from spherical silver nanoparticles,21,38 as shown in Fig. 1(b). It was also observed that the peak of the spherical Ag nanoparticles decreased and shifted to longer wavelengths as the reduction time increased. This is because the Ag nanoparticles grew larger and the number of spherical nanoparticles decreased during the reduction process. These results corresponded to the results of TEM images (Fig. 1(b–d)).
In this study, we suggested the silver nanoplate-based plasmonic nanocomposite photoanodes in order to enhance the performance of DSSCs. Firstly, using the 550 nm resonant Ag nanoplates, TiO2/Ag nanoplate composite photoanodes for DSSCs were fabricated with different amounts of Ag nanoplates from 0.25 to 3.00 wt%. To investigate the effect of Ag nanoplates on the efficiency of DSSCs, the J–V curves of the DSSCs were measured as shown in Fig. 2(a). It was found that the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of the photoanodes increased as the weight fraction of the Ag nanoplates increased up to 0.5 wt%, resulting in the increase of the efficiency. The 0.5 wt% Ag nanoplate composite photoanode had the highest efficiency, an approximately 26% increase. The increase in the efficiency is clearly derived from the enhanced light absorption by the electrons in the silver nanoplates due to their local surface plasmon resonance effect which is proportional to the number of metal nanoparticles incorporated into the TiO2 electrode. This increases the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of the DSSCs and hence their efficiencies (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2(d), the light absorption of the photoanode was enhanced centrally at 550 nm wavelength (see the red line in Fig. 2(d)), compared with that of the pristine TiO2 case (black line). This supports the enhancement in the light absorption by the plasmon resonance effect of the Ag nanoplates in the nanocomposite photoanode. Apart from the electron injection from the dye molecules due to the photoexcitation, the Ag nanoplates are also photo-excited due to the plasmon resonance effect, resulting in the charge separation accompanied by the transfer of photo-excited electrons from the Ag nanoparticles to the TiO2 conduction band and the simultaneous transfer of compensative electrons from the donor in the electrolyte to the Ag nanoparticle.39 A transfer enhancement synergetic photocatalytic mechanism is proposed in Fig. 3 to help understand the photocatalytic process that takes place on the TiO2/Ag nanoplate composite photoanodes. Incorporating Ag nanoplates into the photoanode of the DSSCs makes the fermi level (EF) of TiO2 increase considerably with the synergetic effect between the charge transfer and SPR absorption of the Ag nanoplates.40,41 Based on the above mechanism, the strongly localized electromagnetic field around the Ag nanoplates strongly enhanced the optical absorption efficiency of the dye molecules,39,42,43 resulting in the observed increase in the photocurrent of the Ag nanoplate-incorporated DSSCs. However, when the amount of Ag nanoplates was higher than 0.5 wt%, it was observed that the current density (Jsc) decreased again, causing a decrease in the efficiency of the plasmonic DSSCs (Fig. 2(a)). This might be because a large number of Ag nanoplates were prone to be aggregated and exist inside the TiO2 crystallites rather than arranging them in the surface of TiO2 crystallites and thereby increase the parasitic absorption, which does not generate an electron/hole pair. This parasitic absorption significantly disrupts the plasmonic effect and eventually decrease the photocurrent and the efficiency of the DSSCs after reaching a maximum favorable incorporation of Ag nanoplates.44 Therefore, in the 550 nm plasmonic DSSCs, the optimal weight fraction of the Ag nanoplates was found to be 0.5 wt% (Table 1).

In order to further enhance the efficiency of the plasmonic DSSCs, the 750 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates were also incorporated into the plasmonic DSSCs with the 550 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates of 0.5 wt%, as shown in Fig. 2(b). It was noteworthy that a 37% improvement in the efficiency was achieved for the DSSC compared to the conventional pristine TiO2 photoanodes, incorporating the 550 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates of 0.50 wt% and the 750 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates of 0.25 wt% together. The large improvement of the efficiency was due to the synergetic plasmonic effect, enhancing the light absorption ranging from 400 nm to 1000 nm as shown in Fig. 2(d). It was observed that the light absorption was dramatically enhanced after incorporating the 750 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates with the 550 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates (see the blue line), compared to the case of 550 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates only (see the red line in Fig. 2(d)). Thus, it was demonstrated that the light absorption of the photoanode was enhanced and hence the photocurrent was increased, extending the local surface plasmon reasonance (LSPR) effect further using various plasmonic Ag nano-structures. However, when higher than 0.25 wt%, the efficiency of the plasmonic DSSCs decreased again, because of the excessive amount of Ag nanoplates. A high concentration of nanoparticles was prone to be aggregated, becoming a micro-sized particle and inhibiting the surface plasmonic effect. Therefore, in this work, the optimal weight fraction of the 750 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates was found to be 0.25 wt% when the 550 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates were 0.50 wt% in the plasmonic nanocomposite photoanode.
To investigate the effect of the 950 nm-resonant nanostructures on the performance of DSSCs, Ag nanoplates with plasmon resonance at 950 nm were also applied to the plasmonic DSSCs (550 nm-Ag NPs: 0.50 wt%, 750 nm-Ag NPs: 0.25 wt%). Unfortunately, however, it was found that the efficiency of the plasmonic DSSCs decreased immediately after incorporating the 950 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates as shown in Fig. 2(c). This might be because the numerous Ag nanoplates increased the grain boundary and the recombination probability of the photo-excited electrons with oxidizing species or the tri-iodide ions in the electrolytes, inhibiting the photocurrent and the photo-conversion efficiency. Moreover, although the light absorbance was slightly enhanced (Fig. 2(d)), the solar irradiance spectrum above the atmosphere and at the surface has a lower output power at 950 nm wavelength compared to that of the visible range (Fig. S2†). Thus, there was no significant difference between the total amounts of light energy absorbed in the 550/750 nm-plasmonic photoanode and the 550/750/950 nm-plasmonic photoanode. Based on these results, it was demonstrated that the optimally incorporated 550 nm- and 750 nm-plasmonic photoanode was more desirable for high performance of DSSCs than the photoanode incorporating plenty of Ag nanoplates with 550 nm, 750 nm, and 950 nm-resonance.

Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of TiO2–Ag nanoplate plasmonic nanocomposite photoanodes. The elemental scans clearly revealed the presence of both TiO2 nanoparticles and Ag nanoplates in the nanocomposites. It was noteworthy that Ti and Ag locations show a strict correlation in the TiO2–Ag nanocomposites, Ag nanoplates being on the surrounding area of TiO2 nanoparticles. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) shown in Fig. 4(e) further confirmed the presence of Ti and Ag in the nanocomposites. It was also found that the Ag ingredient was rarely observed (5.73%) because of its small concentration.

To further confirm the enhancement of photocurrent in the plasmonic DSSCs, we measured the IPCE spectra of DSSCs fabricated with various Ag nanoplates. As shown in Fig. 5, the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra exhibited a significant enhancement in the DSSC performance based on the TiO2/Ag nanoplate composite compared to those of the DSSCs based on the pristine TiO2. It was noteworthy that the enhancement in the IPCE occurred centrally at 550 nm wavelength, where the Ag nanoplates are most vigorously plasmon-resonant (Fig. 2d). This means that the efficiency of the plasmonic DSSCs was improved dominantly by the plasmon resonance effect of the 550 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates. The IPCE spectrum broadened to a longer wavelength upon incorporation of Ag nanoplates on the TiO2 surface, due to the surface plasmon resonance effect. However, there was no significant increase in the IPCE at 750 nm wavelength, even when 750 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates were incorporated. This might be because the photo-excited electrons from 750 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates was not enough to transfer to the conduction band of TiO2, so that the electrons were recombined with oxidizing species or the tri-iodide ions in the electrolytes, and IPCE could not increase at 750 nm wavelength. Thus, we can conclude that the intrinsic increase in the photocurrent is primarily related to the enhanced electron injection and transfer ability of the Ag nanoplate-incorporated photoanodes. When the 950 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates were incorporated together, the IPCE decreased again. This is because the numerous Ag nanoplates increased the grain boundary and the recombination probability of the photo-excited electrons, inhibiting the photocurrent and the IPCE, corresponding to the results of J–V curves.

Meanwhile, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of conventional DSSCs and Ag-incorporated plasmonic DSSCs were acquired by measuring the interfacial impedance between the working electrodes and the electrolyte (Fig. 6) under solar illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G). Each Nyquist plot displays two semicircles: the smaller semicircle in the high-frequency range is attributed to the charge-transfer resistance of the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface (R1), and the larger semicircle in the low-frequency range is related to the charge transport/accumulation at the dye-attached TiO2/electrolyte interface resistance (R2). CPE1 and CPE2 represent the constant phase elements at the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface and TiO2/electrolyte interface, respectively.45,46 Here, the Rt (R1) value can be ignored since it remains fairly consistent, and the DSSC components were the same, except for the different concentrations of Ag nanoplates in the photoanode. The changes in Rct (R2) can mainly be attributed to the changes in the Ag content in the photoanode, which contributed the most to the internal impedance. It was observed that the Ag-incorporated DSSCs exhibit lower resistance values implying more efficient charge-transfer processes across the plasmonic photoanode/electrolyte interface, while the pristine DSSC shows the highest R2 (Table 2), indicating that the presence of Ag nanoplates in the TiO2 photoanode improved the electron transport across the interface between the photoanode and electrolyte. This also contributed to the improvement of the overall electron-transport process in the plasmonic devices. The lowest R2 was achieved by incorporating Ag nanoplates with 550 nm and 750 nm resonance, resulting in better connectivity and more conducting pathways created by the presence of Ag nanoplates within the TiO2 nanoporous structure. It would be easier for the electrons released by the redox reaction at the interface to reach the dye cation across the TiO2/Ag nanoplate composites. However, the interfacial impedance between the photoanodes and the electrolyte (R2) increased again when incorporating the 550 nm, 750 nm, and 950 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates all together (Table 2). This is because a number of Ag nanoplates directly in contact with the dye could act as charge carrier recombination centers, causing a decrease in the photocurrent.47,48 This result corresponded with those obtained from the J–V curves in Fig. 2(c).

Meanwhile, the maximum frequencies (ωmax) at the highest values of recombination region arcs for the pristine TiO2 and TiO2/Ag nanoplate composites were 10.47 Hz, 8.05 Hz, 7.14 Hz and 9.38 Hz, respectively. Since ωmax is inversely associated with the electron lifetime, τn = 1/(2πf), a decrease in ωmax indicates a reduced rate for the charge-recombination process in a DSSC. Thus, it was observed that the electron lifetime (τn) increased upon incorporating 550 nm-resonant and 750 nm-resonant Ag nanoplates (Fig. 6(b)). This means that the electrons with longer τn survived the recombination. Meanwhile, the electron transport time (τd) was obtained from the relationship between the electron transportation resistance (Rt) and interfacial charge transport resistance (Rct), using the relation of (τd/τn) = (Rt/Rct). It was revealed that the DSSCs incorporating Ag nanoplates exhibited a longer electron transport time. Unfortunately, however, the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) derived from ηcc = (1 + Rt/Rct)−1 decreased upon incorporating the Ag nanoplates with 550 nm and 750 nm resonance, in contrast with the results of the cell efficiency (Table 2) and the IPCE (Fig. 5). This was because the charge-transfer resistance of the dye-attached TiO2/electrolyte interface (Rct) decreased, while the charge-transfer resistance of the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface (Rt) was almost maintained as mentioned above.
IPCE can be determined as a collective measure of the efficiencies (η) of three key cell processes: light harvesting (LH), separation of opposing charges (CS), and collection of the charges (CC) at the appropriate electrodes. IPCE = ηLH·ηCS·ηCC(3)
From the result of IPCE, it was demonstrated that a significant enhancement in the IPCE of the DSSC based on the TiO2/Ag nanoplate composite was achieved, compared to those of the DSSCs based on the pristine TiO2. Therefore, it seemed that the increase in the efficiency of light harvesting (ηLH) enhanced the IPCE of the plasmonic DSSCs, even though the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) was decreased.
From the previous results, it was obvious that the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is dependent on the shape and the size of nanostructures. For the in-depth study on the LSPR of Ag nanoplates with various shapes and sizes, finite element analysis was carried out. Firstly, to investigate the shape effect on the LSPR, we varied the edge curvature radii (r) of the Ag nanoplate from 10 nm to 28 nm, maintaining the side length (l = 110 nm) and the thickness (t = 5 nm). As shown in Fig. 7(a), it was revealed that the resonance wavelengths of the Ag nanoplates with a curvature radius of 28, 22, 16, and 10 nm were 600, 645, 695, and 745 nm, respectively. It means that the resonance peak gradually shifted to a longer wavelength (red-shift) as the shape of the Ag nanoplate changed from a circular plate (r = 28 nm) to a triangular plate (r = 10 nm), corresponding to the experimental results (Fig. 1). Comparing the cross-sectional view (z = 0) of the normalized electromagnetic field distribution in the Ag nanoplate, it was noteworthy that the enormous LSPR could be attributed to the anisotropic geometry of the nanoplates, which led to a significant electromagnetic-field enhancement in the vicinity of the sharp corner area at the resonance wavelength (Fig. 7(b–e)). It was because the sharp geometry of the anisotropic nanostructures increases the electromagnetic field, producing “hot spots” which are not observed in spherical geometry.49–51

Secondly, the size effect on the LSPR of the triangular Ag nanoplate was also investigated. The side length (l) was varied from 60 nm to 180 nm as measured in TEM images, maintaining the edge curvature radius (r = 10 nm) and the thickness (t = 5 nm). It was found that Ag nanoplates with the side length of 60, 110, and 180 nm had the resonance peaks at 540, 745, and 975 nm wavelength, respectively (Fig. 8(a)), indicating that the absorption peak shifted to a longer wavelength as the side length (l) increased, because of the dynamic depolarization. Meanwhile, it was also observed that the absorbance peak broadened as the side length (l) of the nanoplates increased, due to the radiation damping effect. These results corresponded to the previous results of the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 1(e)). Fig. 8(b–d) show the electromagnetic fields of triangular Ag nanoplates at resonance wavelengths. The LSPR was observed strongly at the corners (hot spots) because of their sharp geometry. It was also revealed that the strong electromagnetic field area was relatively decreased as the size of the nanoplate increased, resulting in the red-shift of the resonance peak. Furthermore, it was noteworthy that these results showed good agreement with the experiment results (see Fig. 1(e) and 8(a)) by explicitly specifying differences in the LSPR with the shape and size of the Ag nanoplates.

Based on these FEM analysis results, it was demonstrated that the LSPR highly depends on the shape and the size of nanostructures. For these reasons, the incorporation of the shape/size-selected Ag nanostructures was desirable for high performance DSSC application.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we suggested the efficiency enhancement in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by using TiO2/silver nanoplate plasmonic nanocomposite photoanodes. The nanocomposite photoanodes with tunable plasmonic properties assembled from the shape/size-selected Ag nanoplates were applied to enhance the light absorption for high-performance DSSCs. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrated that the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is dependent on the material, shape, size, and polarization. Particularly for the Ag nanoplates studied here, the high-order resonances resulted in higher contribution than low-order resonances to the absorption enhancement of DSSCs through an improved overlap with the active material absorption spectrum. Consequently, the improvement of 37% in the efficiency of DSSCs was achieved in this work. These results suggest a new approach to achieve higher overall enhancement through improving broadband absorption.
