    , Accepted 21st November 2019First published on 21st November 2019AbstractThe lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 is a potential candidate for LEDs, the photoluminescence performance of which is reinforced greatly by Mn doping. Here, we analyzed the geometric, electronic and photoluminescence properties of Mn-doped Cs2AgInCl6 by means of first-principle calculations. We found that in the interior of Cs2AgInCl6, the Mn dopant formed defect complexes by substituting an Ag atom and generating an Ag vacancy (MnAgVAg) owing to the charge balance and the weak distortion of the metal octahedra. The MnAgVAg defect introduced two defect bands in the forbidden gap, which was contributed predominantly by the 3d orbitals of the Mn2+ ions. The electron transition of the Mn2+ ions from the first excited state to the ground state, i.e., from 4T1 to 6A1 states, gives rise to the PL spectrum that is lower than the bandgap. Therefore, we show that the Mn dopant indeed reinforces the PL performance of Cs2AgInCl6 greatly and is beneficial for its use as an LED material.
1. Introduction
In 2009, Kojima et al. fabricated MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells for the first time and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 3.8%, which stimulated a research boom in the field of perovskite solar cell materials.1,2 Because of the superior optoelectronic properties,3–7 perovskite materials show important applications in solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers and photodetectors.8–15 However, the instability of perovskite materials under study and the biotoxicity of lead in lead-halide perovskites severely restrict their development in these areas. Therefore, it is necessary to find new environmentally friendly perovskite materials.16–19
Among the potential candidates, lead-free double perovskite materials show similar geometric structures to those of conventional ABX3 perovskite materials, but they are more stable, thereby attracting extensive attention.20–24 A double perovskite material is obtained by replacing the B-site cation with a pair of monovalent and trivalent metal cations, such as replacing two Pb2+ ions with an Ag+/Bi3+ pair, Cu+/In3+ pair, Ag+/Sb3+ pair or K+/Bi3+ pair.25–29 Majher et al. reported the double perovskite Cs2Na1−xBi1−xMn2xCl6 to be a promising red phosphor.30 Feng et al. found that the stability of Cs2AgSbCl6 could be reinforced.31,32 Cs2AgInCl6 is also a lead-free, non-toxic and stable double perovskite material with a direct optical bandgap of 3.3 eV at room temperature.33–37 Some characteristics of Cs2AgInCl6, such as low trap density, wide bandgap and ultra-long carrier lifetime, have led to its potential applications in UV detection, LEDs, etc.35
In previous investigations, many metal ions, such as Bi3+, Ni2+, and Mn2+, have been used to modulate the photoelectric properties and stability of these perovskite materials. For example, the Bi dopant can enhance the stability of MAPbI3, Cs2AgInBr6 and Cs2AgSbBr6.3,16 Bi, Cu and Tl can modulate the bandgap and change the colors of CsPbBr3, Cs2SbAgCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6, respectively.38–40 Yong et al. showed that the incorporation of 11.9% Ni in CsPbCl3 increased the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 2.4% to 96.5%.41
Among these metal dopants, Mn2+ ions are often used to modulate the physical properties of solid materials. For instance, Akkerman et al. proved that the stability of CsPbI3 was greatly enhanced via Mn doping.42,43 Mn doping also stimulated strong orange-yellow emissions in CsPbCl3.44–47 Recently, Locardi et al. reported that Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals exhibited a PL emission spectrum centered at 620 nm after the incorporation of Mn. Meanwhile, the PLQY of Cs2AgInCl6 changed from 1.6% white emission to 16% in the orange region.48 This meant that Mn doping is an efficient strategy to improve the luminescence performance of Cs2AgInCl6 perovskite. However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon has not been understood clearly. It is difficult to judge experimentally how the divalent Mn2+ ion substitutes the inequivalent host metal ions, i.e., the Ag+ and In3+ ions. Furthermore, only with clear information about the doping configuration in Cs2AgInCl6 perovskite, can we understand the variation in the electronic structures and thus, the luminescence performance. Unfortunately, these questions have not been addressed yet. Therefore, we performed DFT calculations in this work to determine the geometric and electronic structure of Mn2+-doped Cs2AgInCl6. We found that MnAg plus VAg defect complexes emerged easily in the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice. We deduce that the electronic transition of Mn2+ from the 4T1 to 6A1 state is responsible for the reinforced orange luminescence observed experimentally.
2. Calculation methods
We used the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)49 to perform all calculations in this study. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)50 model was adopted to deal with the exchange and correlation interactions of electrons. The interactions between electrons and ions were computed using the PAW method. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional was employed to obtain better accuracy in the electronic structures.51 The cutoff energy, the convergence accuracy and the residual force were set to 400 eV, 1 × 10−4 eV per atom and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. We used a supercell of 40 atoms for calculations. The Brillouin zone integral was summed over the full Brillouin zone using 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack special K points.
3. Results and analysis
3.1 Geometric structures
Since the electronegativity of Mn2+ and Cl− are so different that the replacement of Mn2+ on Cl− positions in the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice is difficult, the related defects are not discussed in this paper. Considering the replacement position and charge balance, we employed seven doping strategies in the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice: (a) an Mn atom substitutes a Cs atom, represented by MnCs; (b) an Mn atom substitutes an In atom, marked by MnIn; (c) an Mn atom substitutes an Ag atom, denoted as MnAg; (d) two Mn atoms substitute an Ag/In pair, represented as MnAgMnIn; (e) one Mn atom substitutes an Ag atom and an Ag vacancy, marked by MnAgVAg; (f) one Mn atom substitutes an Ag atom and a Cs vacancy, denoted as MnAgVCs; (g) one Mn atom substitutes an In atom and a Cl vacancy, labeled as MnInVCl. We calculated the formation energies52,53 (Ef) of all these defects in the doped system according to the formula:  where Eini and Edf are the total energies of the supercell before and after doping, respectively. ni is the number of elements added or removed during the formation of the defects, μi is the chemical potential of the element. For the metal cations, the chemical potentials were obtained from the calculations of the respective bulk materials. For the chlorine atom, the chemical potentials were obtained from the calculations of chlorine gas.
From the data in Table 1, we could see that, among the defects in the Cs2AgInCl6 system, the formation energy of MnCs was the highest, and the formation of MnAgVAg was the lowest. That is, the substitution of a Cs atom by an Mn atom is the most difficult to occur in the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice, while the defect of an Mn atom substituting an Ag atom plus the generation of an Ag vacancy is the most easily occurring condition.

The formation of various defects can also be understood qualitatively via analyzing the geometric structure of Cs2AgInCl6. The Cs2AgInCl6 supercell was in the cubic phase with the space group Fmm, and the lattice constant was 10.64 Å after structural optimization. Due to the difference in the ionic radii and electronegativity between the dopant Mn atoms and the host atoms (Ag, In, Cs, Cl), all the defects or defect complexes would alter the local geometric structure inside the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice. Some defects, namely MnCs, MnAgVCs and MnInVCl, induce an obvious contraction of bond lengths and changes in the bond angles. Moreover, the MnInVCl defect causes the cation octahedra, including AgCl6 and MnCl6 octahedra, to deviate manifestly from the ideal octahedron structure, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Both geometric variations triggered by these defects lead to high formation energies in the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice. When the MnAg and MnIn defects are introduced into the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice, they give rise to the contraction of the cation–chlorine bond, i.e., the Mn–Cl bond, while the bond angles do not change, that is, the ideal MnCl6 octahedron is preserved, which is shown in Fig. 1(c). Thus, in this case, the formation energies of the defects are lower due to lesser geometric distortion. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig. 1(d), when an Ag vacancy is generated near the MnAg defect to compensate for the nonisovalent substitution, which is supported by the charge distribution, the formation energy of the MnAgVAg defect thus decreases to the lowest value among those of the defects considered in this work. In other words, the excess electron induced by the Mn dopant in the MnAg-containing system gives rise to the electronic expansion of the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice, and the VAg vacancy relieves this expansion. Therefore, the lattice parameters of the MnAgVAg-containing system are slightly smaller than those of the MnAg-containing system. Coincidentally, our results are similar to the phenomenon observed by Michaelis et al., where the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of Cu(II)-doped Cs2SbAgCl6 double perovskite shows that the substitution of Ag+ by Cu2+ produces an Ag+ cationic vacancy to maintain charge neutrality in the doped system.39 Therefore, we used the Cs2AgInCl6 supercell containing the MnAgVAg defect as the representative configuration in the following sections to analyze the electronic structure and photoluminescence altered by the Mn dopant.

3.2 Electronic structures
The band structure of Cs2AgInCl6 calculated using the HSE functional is shown in Fig. 2(a), which gives a typical direct bandgap with a value of 2.37 eV.37 From the density of states (DOS) illustrated in Fig. 2(b), we could see that the conduction band minimum (CBM) was predominantly contributed by the 5s-orbitals from the In and Ag cations, while the valence band maximum (VBM) was attributed to the hybridization between the Cl-3p orbitals and the Ag-4d/In-4d orbitals. Meanwhile, the orbitals of Cs ions contributed little to the band edges. For the Cs2AgInCl6 system doped with Mn ions, we only considered the most stable configuration, i.e., the system with MnAgVAg defects. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the band gap of the Cs2AgInCl6 system with MnAgVAg defects was 2.65 eV, which is slightly larger than that of the undoped system. It was still a direct band structure, but there was one impurity state near CBM and one impurity band near VBM in the forbidden gap. According to the Partial density of states (PDOS) of the Mn-doped Cs2AgInCl6 system, the impurity bands were mainly contributed by the Mn-d orbitals, which are exhibited in Fig. 3(a). The energy difference between these impurity bands was about 1.70–1.92 eV. That is, these impurity bands assist in generating electron transitions lower than the bandgap of the host Cs2AgInCl6 system. This transition energy of 1.70–1.92 eV was near the PL emission peak of the Mn-doped Cs2AgInCl6 material centered at 632 nm,33,48 which confirms that the Mn d–d transition gives rise to the experimentally observed PL enhancement of Mn-doped Cs2AgInCl6.

The two double-headed arrows in (a) represent the band edge transition and the Mn d–d transition, respectively. 

Fig. 3(b) shows that owing to the incorporation of Mn, the CBM of the MnAgVAg-containing Cs2AgInCl6 system is derived from the Mn 3d and In 5s orbitals. Furthermore, the 3d orbital of Mn contributes predominantly to the impurity states in the forbidden gap. With respective to the orbital angular momentum I, the d orbital of the Mn atoms composed of five d-orbits, i.e., dxy, dxz, dyz, dx2−y2, and dz2. They are the five-fold degenerated states in the standard atomic model. However, when the Mn atom is introduced into the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice, it turns to an Mn2+ ion with the electron configuration of 3d.5 In the double perovskite material Cs2AgInCl6, Mn2+ ion forms the MnCl6 octahedron. That is, it lies in the octahedral crystal field. Due to the decrease in the symmetry of the potential field, the 3d orbital of Mn2+ ion degrades to the double degenerated dx2−y2 and dz2 (eg) states and the triple degenerated dxy, dxz, and dyz (t2g) states. Because of the strong interactions with the ligands in the octahedral crystal field, the eg of Mn2+ sites are above the energy levels of t2g. In the ground state of the Mn2+ ion, all electrons are in a high spin state, i.e., the five unpaired electrons occupy all the up spin eg and t2g states, yielding a total spin multiplicity of 6, which is called 6A1 in the group theory, and the energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 4. When the system is excited by external irradiation, it changes from the ground state to the first excited state. In other words, one of the up spin electrons transits upward to occupy the down spin states, resulting in a total spin multiplicity of 4, denoted as the 4T1 state. The photoluminescence behavior is the process, in which the electrons in the excited states transit back to the ground states. In this case, it is the d–d transition of the Mn2+ ions from the first excited state 4T1 to the ground state 6A1. The transition from 4T1 to 6A1 state of the Mn d electron is nominally spin forbidden. However, this transition can be activated by impact excitation from a light-excited carrier of the host material to the Mn dopant, leading to relatively efficient emission. This special illumination is usually characterized by a long lifetime, such as 974 μs.33 The band structure of Mn-doped Cs2AgInCl6 shows that the energy difference between those two states is about 1.70–1.92 eV, illuminating light with a wavelength near the experimentally observed 632 nm. This can help to increase the PLQY of Cs2AgInCl6, just as reported by Locardi et al., who found an enhancement in orange emission after the incorporation of Mn dopant into the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice.

4. Conclusions
We employed density functional theory calculations to analyze the geometric, electronic and photoluminescence properties of the Mn-doped Cs2AgInCl6 material. By analyzing the formation energy, we found that, although there may be many defects related to the Mn dopant, the MnAg plus VAg defect (MnAgVAg) had the lowest formation energy due to the charge balance and weak distortion of the metal octahedra. Using the MnAgVAg-containing Cs2AgInCl6 system, we found that this defect configuration brought about two defect bands in the forbidden gap, both originating from the 3d orbitals of the Mn2+ ions. The electron transition from the first excited state to the ground state, i.e., 4T1 to 6A1 state, leads to the PL spectrum that is lower than the bandgap. Therefore, the Mn dopant indeed reinforces the PL performance of Cs2AgInCl6 greatly and is beneficial for its usage as an LED material.
