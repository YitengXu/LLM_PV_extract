    , Accepted 19th February 2019First published on 20th February 2019AbstractIn terms of the in-depth development of organic dyes, targeted and selective energy control is becoming a more and more important objective. Herein, four indoline sensitizers based on D–π–A–π–A construction were designed and synthesized with exactly the same donor and acceptor segments. Their molecular planarity was regulated by introducing various side chains into donor bridges. Interestingly, along with an improvement of planarity at a donor bridge, the HOMO levels of the dyes lift gradually, and more importantly, their LUMO levels remain at around the same value. Besides, better molecular planarity is obviously preferred to obtain higher charge injection efficiency but, an overly planar molecule may cause an overly high HOMO level, leading to poor dye regeneration efficiency. Furthermore, an appropriate side chain also restrains charge recombination to some extent, while an overly large side chain gives more chance for I3− to recombine with charge in the conduction band. Accordingly, our results demonstrated that regulation of planarity at a donor bridge not only provides targeted and selective control of the HOMO of the dye, but also enable fine adjustment with multiple interfacial charge transfer processes. Molecular planarity deserves to play an important role in the design of organic dyes, providing a significant strategy for the further development of organic sensitizers.
Introduction
Along with extensive applications of organic dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the energy control of them has attracted more and more attention as it plays an important role in affecting interfacial charge transfer processes in photovoltaic devices.1–3 There are two critical interfacial charge transfer processes in a DSSC device: (i) photo-excited charge injection from the LUMO of the dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and (ii) oxidized dye regeneration by receiving charge from the redox couple to the HOMO of the dye. To guarantee the thermodynamic possibilities of these two processes, the LUMO level of the dye should be higher than the CB of TiO2 and the HOMO level should be lower than the redox potential of the redox couple. Moreover, to realize highly efficient charge transfer, a certain energy gap should also be applied as the driving force. On the other hand, if these energy gaps are overly large then this excess energy will be wasted.4 Accordingly, energy control of the dye is a quite complex and systematic task.
Molecular engineering is a common strategy used to regulate energy levels. Generally, the introduction of a stronger donor results in the dye having a lower HOMO level, while the introduction of a stronger acceptor results in a higher LUMO level. Many efforts have been made towards achieving ideal energy levels by developing novel donor and acceptor segments over the past two decades.3,5–13 In our previous works, multiple donor groups with strong electron-donating capability, such as indoline- and carbazole-substituted indoline groups, have been introduced into dye molecules and the HOMO levels of the dyes were gradually lifted.14–16 However, along with the upshift of the HOMO level, the LUMO level was also lifted synchronously to some extent, thus resulting in an undesired waste of energy and low regulation efficiency.5,15 A similar situation was also found in the regulation of LUMO levels, that is, along with the downshift of the LUMO level the HOMO level also decreased synchronously.17,18 Thus, a targeted and selective energy control strategy is readily required to enhance regulation efficiency and achieve ideal energy levels.
With this in mind, in this work, four indoline dyes with different π-conjugation bridges between donor and auxiliary acceptor units were designed and synthesized (coded as CS dyes, shown in Scheme 1). The planarities of these four π-bridges were gradually adjusted by introducing side chains with different steric hindrances. Along with improving the planarity, the HOMO levels of the dyes were selectively lifted step-by-step, and more importantly, the LUMO levels remained at around the same value, suggesting a quite promising strategy of targeted and selective energy control. Moreover, the effects of molecular planarity on multiple interfacial charge transfer processes were also evaluated and investigated in detail.

Optical and electrochemical measurements
UV-visible spectra of four dyes, both in solution and on a TiO2 electrode, were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2501PC spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out on a Hitachi F-4600 spectrophotometer. Time-correlated PL signals of all four dyes, both in solution and on an electrode, were recorded using a FLS980 Spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments). The PL decay signals were detected at 680 nm upon excitation with a picosecond pulsed diode laser EPL-450 at 450 nm. The cyclic voltammograms tests were performed on a CHI660B electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments) using a three-electrode cell. A dye-loaded TiO2 electrode was used as the working electrode and a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode with a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) acting as a reference, while 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was used as the supporting electrolyte. After the measurements, ferrocene was added as an external reference for calibration purposes (0.63 V vs. NHE).
Fabrication and measurements of the cell devices
For the fabrication of DSSCs based on CS-25–28, 6 μm nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes with a 4 μm scattering layer were used as the TiO2 electrodes. All of the TiO2 electrodes were prepared and modified according to a reported procedure.20 The dye-loaded electrodes were prepared by immersing TiO2 electrodes into around a 0.3 mM dye solution (CHCl3/MeOH, v/v, 1/4) overnight. The active area was controlled to be 0.16 mm2. A H2PtCl6 solution (0.02 M in 2-propanol solution) was used to prepare the counter electrode. The Pt catalyst was deposited on a cleaned FTO glass through coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution with heat treatment at 500 °C for 30 min. In this work, a mixture of 0.5 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidiazolium iodide, 0.10 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile was used as the redox electrolyte. The dye-loaded amount was determined by desorbing the dye from the surface of the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode (thickness: 6 μm, area: 2 × 2 cm2) into NaOH solution (H2O/EtOH = 1/1, v/v) and analyzed by a UV-visible spectrophotometer. A corresponding dye solution with known concentration was also analyzed and used as an external standard. For the dummy cell, a 3 μm ZrO2 electrode was prepared by exactly the same method as described above, except using ZrO2 paste, which was prepared according to a published procedure.21

J–V curves were obtained using an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp (OTENTO-SUN II, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd) as the light source. The power was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a reference silicon cell (BS-520, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). The photocurrent action spectra were measured with a monochromator (M10-T, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). The intensity of the monochromic light was calibrated using a reference silicon cell (S1337-1010BQ, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd).
Charge lifetime and charge density in the complete DSSCs were measured by stepped light-induced transient measurements of the photocurrent and voltage (SLIM-PCV) using a PSL-100 (EKO Co. Ltd).22 A laser (λ = 473 nm) was used as the light source. The transients were induced by a stepwise change in the laser intensity which was controlled by adjusting its voltage. The photocurrent and photovoltage transients were monitored using a digital oscilloscope through an amplifier. Through varying the laser intensity, the lifetime could be estimated over a range of open-circuit voltages by fitting a decay of the photovoltage transient with exp(−t/τ).22 The electron density measurements were performed as follows: the DSSC was illuminated for 5 s while a bias voltage was applied to make the cell open-circuit, then the laser was shut down simultaneously, and the cell was switched from open to short circuit. The resulting current was measured over 25 s and then the electron density could be calculated through integrating the electric charge. All experiments were conducted at room temperature. Ten samples were fabricated and tested for each measurement and median values were selected to be reported in this work.
Theoretical calculations
All of the theoretical calculation analyses were performed using a Gaussian 09 program.23 The ground-state geometries of the dyes were optimized on the basis of hybrid density functional theory (DFT, B3LYP) with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) excited states calculations and the molecular geometries of the two dyes at the first excited singlet states were performed at the MPWPW91/6-311G(d,p) level with an optimized ground-state geometry. Solvation effects (chloroform) were taken into account in the TDDFT calculations.
Results and discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, four novel D–π–A–π–A indoline dyes with exactly the same donor and acceptor groups were designed and synthesized. The only difference in the four dyes is the planarity of the donor bridge between the donor and auxiliary acceptor part, which was adjusted by introducing thiophene units with different side chains. When the side chain of a thiophene unit was hydrogen (CS-25), the dihedral angle between the indoline and thiophene planes was calculated to be only 21.5°. Along with an increase in the steric hindrance from the side chains, the dihedral angles of the dyes CS-26–28 increased to 40.7°, 45.2°, and 51.1°, respectively, suggesting a gradual decrease in the molecular planarity, which might have a significant effect on the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties.
Optical and electrochemical characterization
As shown in Fig. 1, around a 20 nm red-shift in the maximum absorption peak (λmax) was found for CS-25 with respect to the other three dyes. With a decrease in the molecular planarity, the λmax values of CS-25–28 lay in the order of CS-25 > CS-26 > CS-27 > CS-28, due to the weak ICT process in the poor planarity molecules. On the other hand, the molar extinction coefficients (εmax) of alkyl substituted dyes (CS-26–28) were obviously higher than that of CS-25, which could compensate for the narrow absorption spectra to some extent (Table S1 in ESI†). While adsorbed on 3 μm TiO2, the λmax values of all four dyes blue-shifted with respect to their λmax value in solvent (Fig. 1, inset). Noticeably, along with an improvement in the planarity, the blue-shift increased from 3 nm for CS-28 to 14 nm for CS-25. As is well known, the deprotonation effect can be overcome by a strong electron withdrawing effect of an auxiliary acceptor.5 Thus, the larger blue-shift of CS-25 should be mainly caused by H-aggregation due to its better molecular planarity, which might affect its photovoltaic performance. In the case of CS-28, the cyclohexyl side chain obviously presented a better anti-aggregation effect, thus resulting in a smaller blue-shift.

Meanwhile, the PL spectra of CS-25–28 were also evaluated and the λPL values were determined to be 588, 592, 612, and 614 nm, respectively (Table S1 and Fig. S1 in ESI†). Combined with their λmax values, the energy losses were calculated to be 0.39, 0.47, 0.57, and 0.61 eV for the four dyes, respectively. Herein, larger energy losses imply easier excited state relaxations, including vibrational, solvent, and torsional relaxations.24 As is known, planarization is a common process during the excitation of a dye. Therefore, with better molecular planarity, a dye will obviously save more energy due to less torsional relaxation energy loss.
Furthermore, through the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique, the lifetimes (τsolution) of the four dyes were found to be 5.94, 5.51, 5.37, and 4.14 ns for CS-25–28, respectively, lying in the same order of molecular planarity (Fig. 2). That means the improvement in the planarity also resulted in the benefit of a long excited charge lifetime, which might promote a high electron injection efficiency (ηinj).

To determine the effect of the molecular planarity on the energy levels, cyclic voltammograms of the four dyes were measured (Fig. S2 in ESI†) and the data are also presented in Table S1 (ESI†). By using exactly the same benzothiadiazole substituted benzoic acid as the acceptor part, the LUMO levels of CS-25–28 were obtained as quite similar values of −1.26 to −1.27 V. On the other hand, the donor parts of the four dyes were also exactly the same and their HOMO levels were found to be 0.73, 0.79, 0.80, and 0.83 V, respectively, lying in the order of CS-25 < CS-26 < CS-27 < CS-28, which could only be attributed to the different molecular planarities of the donor bridges. In other words, when the planarity of a donor bridge was changed, the HOMO level of the dye was adjusted. More importantly, during the adjustment, the LUMO levels of the dyes were not affected, showing us a promising strategy to realize targeted and selective energy control.
As mentioned above, the energy levels of a dye are quite important factors that affect critical interfacial charge transfer processes during photon-to-electron conversion, that is, the LUMO level affects the injection efficiency, while the HOMO level affects the dye regeneration efficiency.
Although the LUMO levels of the four dyes remained at around same value, the τsolution gradually increased along with the improvement in the molecular planarity, which might result in the benefit of a high ηinj value. Thus, the ηinj values were also evaluated according to eqn (1): (1)where τTiO2 is the PL lifetime when the dye is loaded on a TiO2 film. As shown in Fig. 2, while loaded on the TiO2 film, the PL decay signals of all four dyes presented obvious quenching due to injection of the excited charge into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and their lifetimes (τTiO2) sharply decreased to 0.59, 0.53, 0.61, and 0.50 ns, respectively. Notably, in these measurements, 20 mM CDCA was used during the preparation of the dye-loaded TiO2 surface to prevent π-aggregation, which also caused fluorescence quenching. As a result, the electron injection efficiencies (ηinj) for CS-25–28 were calculated to be 90.07%, 90.38%, 88.64%, and 87.92%, respectively. Accordingly, although the planarity of the donor part cannot affect the LUMO level of the dye, better molecular planarity is still obviously preferred to achieve a longer lifetime and higher ηinj value, which lead to better photovoltaic performance.
Besides, along with the improvement in the molecular planarity, the HOMO levels of the dyes gradually lifted. This means that the free energy gap between the HOMO of a dye and the oxidation potential of the I−/I3− couple gradually decreased, which may affect the dye regeneration efficiencies (ηreg), thus being another important factor affecting the photovoltaic performance to a considerable extent. Thus, with a similar technique, the ηreg values of all four dyes were also estimated according to eqn (2):21 (2)where τI−/I3− and τblank are the PL lifetimes of a dummy cell with and without the I−/I3− couple electrolyte. A ZrO2-based electrode was applied to assemble the dummy cell instead of a TiO2-based one to prevent the influence of charge injection,21 while 20 mM CDCA was also used to exclude the influence of π-aggregation. In this way, when the I−/I3− couple was injected, the PL decay could only arise from the charge transfer from the I−/I3− couple to the HOMO of the dye, simulating the dye regeneration process. As shown in Fig. 3, without the I−/I3− couple, the PL lifetimes (τblank) of the CS-25–28-based ZrO2 dummy cells were measured to be 3.56, 3.33, 3.24, and 2.31 ns, respectively, lying in the same order as their lifetimes in solution. When the I−/I3− couple was injected, the PL lifetimes (τI−/I3−) were efficiently quenched to 0.73, 0.50, 0.46, and 0.33 ns with ηreg values of 79.49%, 84.98%, 85.80%, and 85.71% respectively. As a result, the planarity improvement of the donor bridge is preferred to save energy and obtain a high charge injection efficiency. However, the overly high HOMO level arising from an overly planar donor bridge may also result in a decrease in the dye regeneration efficiency, which will definitely depress the photovoltaic performance.

Theoretical approach
To gain an insight into the effect that the energy levels and electronic transition processes have upon photoexcitation and conformational relaxation, DFT and TD-DFT calculations and the molecular geometries of four dyes at the first excited singlet states were optimized using the Gaussian program at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) and MPWPW91/6-311G(d,p) levels, respectively. Solvation effects (chloroform) were also taken into account in these calculations with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) implemented in Gaussian 09.23
The DFT calculations were found to satisfactorily reproduce the experimental trend of the energy levels for all four dyes (Table S2 and Fig. S3 in ESI†). Along with an improvement in the donor bridge planarity, the HOMO level gradually shifted, higher while the LUMO levels remained around the same values. Absorption spectra of CS-25–28 were also simulated by TDDFT calculations. The maximum absorption peaks were extracted as 522, 499, 489, and 483 nm, respectively, which presented a good consistent relative trend with the experimental results. Furthermore, the PL properties of these dyes were also calculated by optimizing their molecular geometries in the first excited singlet states to obtain the energy loss values. Noteworthy, the relative tendency of theoretical energy loss was also in good accordance with the experimental results. More importantly, obvious planarization can be observed in Fig. 4 for all four dyes in their first excited singlet states. Thus, a more planar molecule will obviously save more energy due to less torsional relaxation cost, which is consistent with our previous discussion and may positively contribute toward its photovoltaic performance.

Photovoltaic performances
To determine the actual influence of molecular planarity on photovoltaic performance, DSSC devices sensitized by all four dyes were fabricated and evaluated. In good agreement with the absorption spectra, the onset wavelengths of the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for CS-25–28 were found at 770, 750, 740, 710 nm, respectively (Fig. 5a). As mentioned above, due to the absence of co-adsorbent, π-aggregation occurred on the TiO2 surface for a planar dye, such as CS-25. Thus, its IPCE values were relatively lower than those of CS-26, which showed a broad action area with a high plateau from 410 to 630 nm. The maximum IPCE value (IPCEmax) of CS-26 was determined to be around 84%@490 nm.
 Fig. 5  (a) IPCE action spectra and (b) J–V curves of the four dye sensitized DSSCs. 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidiazolium iodide, 0.10 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile was used as the liquid redox electrolyte. 
However, when the side chain was altered to an ethyl or cyclohexyl group, the IPCEmax values of CS-27 and CS-28 were only around 51% and 30%, respectively, although the π-aggregation of the dye was further prevented.
Considering the only slightly lower ηinj and high ηreg values of CS-27 and CS-28, the charge injection processes might not be the main reason for their poor IPCE values, with respect to CS-26. Besides ηinj and ηreg, the IPCE values are also affected by another two factors according to eqn (3):4 IPCE = LHE × ηinj × ηreg × ηcol(3)where LHE is the light-harvesting efficiency and ηcol is the charge collection efficiency. Therefore, the LHE values of the four dyes were first evaluated and compared (eqn (4), shown in Fig. 6): LHE = 1 − 10−A(4)where A is the absorbance of dye-loaded TiO2 film. The εmax of CS-25 was the lowest among the four dyes, however, CS-25 still showed the highest LHE values within the region of 510–700 nm. On the other hand, CS-27 presented medium LHE values across the spectrum, although it possesses the highest εmax value.
 Fig. 6  LHE spectra of CS-25–28 calculated from the absorption spectra of dye-loaded 6 μm TiO2 electrodes. 
Actually, a side chain with large steric hindrance not only prevented π-aggregation, but also enlarged the molecular volume and decreased the dye-loading amount, which affected the light-harvesting capability to a considerable extent. The highest dye-loading amount obtained was 2.92 × 10−7 mol cm−2 by CS-25 (Table 1). When a methyl group was introduced, the value of CS-26 slightly decreased to 2.57 × 10−7 mol cm−2. However, when the side chain was altered to an ethyl or cyclohexyl group, the dye-loading amounts sharply decreased to 1.86 and 1.64 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for CS-27 and CS-28, respectively. Considering the similar molar extinction coefficients of CS-26–28, the relatively low dye-loading amounts of CS-27 and CS-28 might lead to a poor light-harvesting capability on TiO2 film, thus resulting in poor IPCE performance.

Moreover, after the injection of excited charge into the CB of TiO2, there is an important competition between charge collection and recombination, where the latter is generally characterized by the charge lifetime. Thus, the ηcol value can be qualitatively evaluated by the charge lifetime of the dye, which can be measured by SLIM-PCV. As shown in Fig. 7b, at a fixed charge density, the charge lifetimes increased gradually from CS-25 to CS-27, while the charge lifetime of CS-28 did not continue to increase, but decreased to a similar value as that of CS-26. That is, the ηcol values of the four dyes lie in the order of CS-27 > CS-28 ≈ CS-26 > CS-25. Therefore, as an overall result of LHE, and ηcol, CS-26, with appropriate molecular planarity and volume, presented the best IPCE performance among all four dyes.
 Fig. 7  (a) Open-circuit voltage (VOC) and (b) charge lifetime as a function of the charge density based on four dye-sensitized solar cells. 
Accordingly, the highest short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) was obtained by CS-26-sensitized DSSC as 16.96 mA cm−2, which was over 3 times as high as that of -sensitized CS-28 (Fig. 5b). Notably, the measured JSC values were quite coincident with their integrated values of IPCE spectra (Table 1), suggesting the reliability of the results. More interestingly, as the molecular planarity weakened, the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) values of the dyes increased from 0.695 V for CS-25 to 0.748 V for CS-27 accordingly first, and then dropped down to 0.722 V for CS-28. To gain more insight into the VOC variation, SLIM-PCV measurements were further conducted on all four DSSCs.
As shown in Fig. 7a, VOC as a function of charge density was applied to study the CB edge shift (ΔECB). For all four DSSCs, the VOC values increased linearly with the logarithm of the charge density, exhibiting a similar slope. Obviously, the charge density produced by CS-26-based DSSC was higher than the others, which followed the same trend obtained in the photocurrent results.
However, at a fixed charge density, there were around 27, 59, and 69 mV enhancements for CS-25 compared with CS-26, CS-27, and CS-28, meaning that the CB edge of TiO2 would be lifted to a greater extent by the dye possessing better molecular planarity. As is well known, ΔECB can be expressed as eqn (5):25 (5)where q is the electron charge, μnormal is a component of dipole moment of the individual sensitizer perpendicular to the TiO2 surface, γ is the surface concentration of the dye, ε0 and ε are the permittivity of the vacuum and the dielectric constant of the organic monolayer. Thus, to reveal the reason for the larger ΔECB values of more planar dyes, the vertical components of the dipoles of the dyes were calculated using the Gaussian 09 program, possessing the same direction but different magnitudes. As shown in Fig. S4 (in ESI†), the vertical dipole moments increased from 5.17 D of CS-28 to 6.63 D of CS-25, along with an improvement in the molecular planarity. Taking the trend of the dye-loading amounts into account, the different ΔECB values of the four dyes can be easily understood.
Except for ΔECB, another important factor affecting the VOC value is the charge density in the CB of TiO2.26 As discussed above, the ΔECB value of CS-25 was even larger than that of CS-26, however, the VOC value of CS-25 was 39 mV lower than that of CS-26. Thus, this difference should arise from the different charge densities in the CB of a TiO2 electrode, which is strongly dependent upon the charge recombination rate. Therefore, to further understand the differences in the VOC values, the profile of the charge lifetime against charge density of these dyes was studied again (Fig. 7b). As mentioned above, at a fixed charge density, the charge lifetimes increased gradually from CS-25 to CS-27, while the charge lifetime of CS-28 did not continue to increase, but instead decreased. In our opinion, when the side chain was altered to a cyclohexyl group with large steric resistance, the two adsorbed dyes would be separated too far away from each other by the large side chain, which gave sufficient room for I3− species. That would absolutely result in a higher possibility of contact between I3− and a TiO2 surface, leading to a much faster charge recombination rate of a CS-28-based DSSC than that of a CS-27-based device. Consequently, as an overall result of the CB edge shift and the charge recombination, the obtained VOC values of the four DSSCs lay in the order of CS-27 (0.748 V) > CS-26 (0.734 V) > CS-28 (0.722 V) > CS-25 (0.695 V).
Conclusions
In conclusion, four indoline sensitizers based on a D–π–A–π–A construction were designed and synthesized. Various donor bridges with different side chains were introduced between the indoline and benzothiadiazole segments to adjust the dihedral angles of these two planes, thus resulting in fine regulation of molecular planarity. Along with the gradual improvement in the planarity at a donor bridge, the HOMO levels of the dyes selectively lifted while their LUMO levels remained at around the same value. Besides, better molecular planarity is obviously preferred to obtain higher charge injection efficiency, while an overly planar molecule may cause an overly high HOMO level, leading to poor dye regeneration efficiency. Furthermore, an appropriate side chain also restrains the charge recombination to some extent, while an overly large side chain gives more chance for I3− to recombine with a charge in the CB of TiO2. Accordingly, our results demonstrate that the regulation of donor bridge planarity can not only allow the targeting and selective control of the HOMO level of a dye, but also allow fine adjusting of the multiple interfacial charge transfer processes, suggesting an important role of molecular planarity, and providing a powerful strategy for the rational molecular design of organic dyes in the future.
