    , Accepted 9th October 2017First published on 10th October 2017AbstractPhotophysical properties and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) reactivity for anthrol carbaldehydes 1–5 have been investigated computationally and experimentally by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence and laser flash photolysis (LFP). 1,2-Disubstituted anthrol carbaldehydes 1 and 2 are not ESIPT reactive, contrary to naphthol analogues. The main deactivation channels from S1 for 1 and 2 are fluorescence (ΦF = 0.1–0.2) and intersystem crossing (ISC) to almost isoenergetic T2 states. The triplet states from 1 and 2 were detected by LFP (in N2-purged CH3CN, τ = 15 ± 2 μs for 1, and τ = 5.5 ± 0.1 μs for 2). In contrast, 2,3-disubstituted anthrols 3–5 undergo efficient barrierless ultrafast ESIPT. However, the typical dual emission from locally excited states and ESIPT tautomers were not observed since ESIPT proceeds via a conical intersection with S0 delivering the keto-tautomer in the hot ground state. Therefore, anthrols 3–5 are about ten times less fluorescent compared to 1 and 2, and the emission for 3–5 originates from less-populated conformers that cannot undergo ESIPT. Keto-tautomers for 3–5 were detected in CH3CN by LFP (λmax = 370 nm, τ = 30–40 ns). The difference in ESIPT reactivity for 1–3 was fully disclosed by calculations at ADC(2)/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory, and particularly, by calculation of charge redistribution upon excitation to S1. Only 2,3-disubstituted anthrols exhibit polarization in S1 that increases the electron density on the carbonyl and decreases this density on the phenolic OH, setting the stage for ultrafast ESIPT.
Introduction
Some organic chromophores exhibit enhanced acidity or basicity upon electronic excitation.1,2 If acidic and basic sites are in close proximity, excitation can lead to excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT).3,4 ESIPT has been intensively investigated over five decades because of its fundamental aspect in chemistry and biology.5 Furthermore, ESIPT found numerous applications, primarily in material science,6,7 but also in the fields of sensing,8–13 bioimaging,14–16 solar energy conversion,17 UV-photostabilizers,18–22 laser dyes,23–27 organic light-emitting devices,28,29 long-lived pH jumps,30 molecular switches,31,32 or switching of polymorphs.33
The most common acidic group in ESIPT reactions is phenolic OH,34 whereas the basic site is usually encountered in a carbonyl group,35 or a nitrogen atom in a heterocycle.36 The first molecule that was experimentally found to undergo ESIPT was salicylic acid.37 Later, salicylaldehyde derivatives were studied38,39 and the ESIPT was investigated theoretically.40 The reaction scope was extended to naphthol carbaldehyde derivatives.41–44 Extending the size of chromophore has advantages because larger molecules can be excited by near-visible light available from the usual laser sources, and emission in the visible spectrum enables applications in different areas of sensing and material science. We investigated how the increase of the size from naphthalene to anthracene affects the photophysics and ESIPT reactivity of these larger molecules. The known differences in the photophysics of naphthalene and anthracene chromophores makes predictions as to the ESIPT reactivity of anthrol carbaldehydes not possible a priori. The key differences between the naphthalene and anthracene photophysics are in the ordering of the singlet and triplet excited states energy levels, where competitive pathways such as intersystem crossing (ISC) are expected to play a more important role for anthracenes. Moreover, anthracenes ESIPT reactivity could also be significantly affected by the different position of the energy levels imposed by different substitution patterns.45 Herein we report the investigation of the photophysical properties and ESIPT reactivity for a series of anthrol carbaldehydes 1–5 (Fig. 1) by combining theoretical and experimental methods. Our key experimental findings are that substitution pattern on the anthracene moiety affects ESIPT reactivity, and that tautomers formed by ESIPT are not emissive. Ab initio calculations fully disclosed the mechanistic aspects for the differences in observed photophysics and ESIPT reactivity of 1–5.

Results
Conformational equilibria and singlet excited states for carbaldehydes 1–3
To fully understand the photophysical properties of anthrol carbaldehydes, ab initio calculations were performed on molecules 1–3. With respect to the mutual orientation of the hydroxyl and the carbonyl groups, we distinguish between syn–syn (A), syn–anti (B), anti–syn (C) and anti–anti (D) conformers (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The relative energies of the four conformers were calculated at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory (Table 1). For all three carbaldehydes the syn–syn conformers, exhibiting an intra-molecular hydrogen bond, are the most stable structures in gas phase. Computations performed using the COSMO continuum solvation model48 in acetonitrile confirm that syn-syn conformers are the most stable ones.

Rotation of the CHOH and OH groups about the C–C and C–O bonds, respectively is strongly destabilizing. In carbaldehyde 3 the syn–anti and anti–syn structures are found 0.41 (9.45) and 0.38 eV (8.76 kcal mol−1) higher in energy. The anti–anti structure is weakly stabilized by the O⋯H interaction, and it is found 0.30 eV (6.91 kcal mol−1) above the minimum. From Table 1 it is evident that that the same trend is found for 1 and 2. Solvation leads to stabilization of the conformers. In particular, in CH3CN the anti–anti structures of 1–3 are found 0.19 (4.38), 0.21 (4.84) and 0.19 eV (4.38 kcal mol−1), higher in energy than the corresponding syn–syn structures. This ensures that in the ground state the Boltzmann population of conformers B–D is small at room temperature, both in gas phase and in solution, and that these conformers are not the main species involved in the primary excitation process. However, nonradiative deactivation from the excited electronic states may supply sufficient energy to the system to allow conformational changes. In particular, a relatively low energy barrier of 0.16 eV (3.69 kcal mol−1) was found for the conformational change 3B → 3D in S0 (for the calculated conformational change barriers in S0 and S1 see Table S1 in the ESI†). Thus, to obtain a wider picture of the reactivity of 1–3, we explore the excited electronic states properties of all conformers.
The lowest three ADC(2)/aug-cc-pVDZ vertical excitation energies of 1, 2 and 3 together with the most relevant molecular orbitals involved in the excitation are compiled in Table 2, and Tables S2, S3 in the ESI.† In all carbaldehydes except in 2B, the lowest excited state (S1) is a ππ* state with dominant HOMO → LUMO transition, corresponding to the La state. While La is a locally excited state, it has a partial charge transfer character. This is evident from the frontier orbitals of 3A shown in Fig. 3, where one sees that translocation of electron density from the anthracene ring to the carbonyl group takes place upon photoexcitation. Higher in energy are the second ππ* state, mostly the Lb state with dominant contribution from HOMO−1 → LUMO, and an nπ* state with excitation from the oxygen lone pair orbitals to the anthracene ring. Relevant molecular orbitals contributing to the excitation to S1, S2 and S3 for 3B–3D, as well as for all conformers of 1 and 2 are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S3–S13).

Absorption and fluorescence properties of carbaldehydes 1–3
The calculations above are relevant to the measured absorption spectra. Absorption and fluorescence spectra for 1–5 were measured in CH3CN (for all absorption and fluorescence spectra see Fig. S14–S31 in the ESI†). In addition, for 1 and 2 the spectra were measured in cyclohexane, and for 3 in cyclohexane and ethyl acetate. Generally, all compounds have the lowest energy absorption band in the visible region (375–550 nm) corresponding to the S0 → S1 transition, populating S1 state that has the La character (Fig. 4). Higher in energy, at ≈350 nm, is the absorption band with the typical anthracene vibronic progression, corresponding to the population of the S2 state that has the Lb character. As demonstrated for 3 (Fig. S22 in the ESI†), the lowest absorption band is solvatochromic, exhibiting ≈10 nm hyposchromic shift upon an increase of the solvent polarity from cyclohexane to CH3CN. The hyposchromic shift indicates that polar solvent stabilizes more S0 than the Franck Condon (FC) state. The absorption band that corresponds to S2 is not solvatochromic.

We will see shortly that the conformer dependent energy ordering influences the emission from the lowest excited state of 1–3. Geometry optimization of the La(ππ*) state provides basic information on emissive properties of these molecules, as well as their ESIPT reactivity. Adiabatic excitation energies (ΔEa) computed as the energy difference between the optimized ground (Smin0) and excited state structures (Smin1), and vertical emission energies (Eemission) computed as the difference in energy between the excited and ground state at the Smin1 geometry for carbaldehyde 3 are compiled in Table 3 (for 1 and 2 in Tables S4 and S5 in the ESI†).

Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements for all molecules were performed in CH3CN and cyclohexane, but for 3–5 fluorescence in cyclohexane could not be detected. For 3, the fluorescence was also measured in EtOAc (all spectral properties are compiled in Table S5, ESI†). Fluorescence spectra in CH3CN are shown in Fig. 5 (for other spectra see Fig. S14–S31 in the ESI†). All fluorescence spectra in all investigated solvents are characterized by the presence of one band. In CH3CN, the emission maxima are at 500–550 nm (in cyclohexane for 1 and 2 at 480 nm). Based on calculations (Table 3, and Tables S4, S5 in the ESI†), the band observed in the fluorescence spectra can be assigned to the locally excited S1 state. Fluorescence spectra are more solvatochromic then absorption spectra with opposite trends being observed. Upon polarity increase, spectra are bathochromically shifted (for 1 and 2, ≈20 nm from cyclohexane to CH3CN), in accord with a partial charge transfer character of S1 that is more stabilized in polar solvents. Addition of protic solvent significantly quenches fluorescence (see Fig. S25 in the ESI†) requiring measurements to be conducted in aprotic solvents only. Comparison of the calculated and measured fluorescence maxima is given in Table S7 (ESI†). For 1 and 2 the calculated excitation energies are somewhat overestimated (corresponding to the shift in the absorption spectrum of ≈20 nm), whereas a better correlation was obtained for the emission energies. For compound 3, a difference between the calculated and experimental values is smaller. Nevertheless, the fluorescence from the phototautomers 1-K–5-K (Fig. 6) formed by ESIPT, or the characteristic dual emission usually seen with the systems undergoing ESIPT were not observed.

Quantum yields of fluorescence were determined by use of acridine yellow as a reference (ΦF = 0.57)49 whereas decay times from S1 were measured by time-correlated single photon counting (SPC, Table 4 and Table S8 in the ESI†). Fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) for 1 and 2 are significantly higher than for 3–5, due to emission from the most stable and the most abundant conformer 1A or 2A, from the S1 surface minimum. On the contrary, the most abundant conformer 3A is not emissive since it undergoes barrierless ESIPT (vide infra), and along the ESIPT pathway deactivates via a conical intersection between the S1 and S0. Thus, emission for 3 is most probably observed from conformers 3B or 3D which are higher in energy (see above) and likely present in small amounts in solution at room temperature.

We notice that in S0 conformers 3B and 3D are 0.31 (7.14 kcal mol−1) and 0.19 eV (4.38 kcal mol−1) higher in energy then 3A (Table 1). However, in S1 the energy ordering of conformers changes, so that 3B is 0.20 eV more stable than 3D, although both are higher in energy than 3A. The barrier for conformational change 3B → 3D in S0 is 0.16 eV (3.69 kcal mol−1) and it increases to 0.27 eV (6.22 kcal mol−1) in the S1 state (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Thus, conformational switch 3B → 3D may take place in S0 if the system acquires enough energy at higher temperature, but in S1 it is very unlikely since the barrier is relatively high and the excited state has a finite lifetime. On the other hand, the energy barrier for 3D → 3B is only 0.09 eV (2.07 kcal mol−1) in S1, allowing for this conformational change during the S1 lifetime. Thus, it is plausible that upon excitation of 3D (the second conformer in energy in S0), the switch 3D → 3B takes place in S1. The same behavior is anticipated for 4 and 5.
For carbaldehydes 3–5 the ΦF depends on the excitation wavelength, whereas the appearance of the excitation spectra depends on the detection wavelength (see Fig. S22 in the ESI†). Since we excluded the presence of impurities in the sample (for the synthesis see the ESI†), the finding suggested that conformers A–D have different absorption spectra. Moreover, we see a general trend that ΦF is higher upon excitation at the shorter wavelength where the less abundant conformers B–D have higher absorptivity than the most stable non-fluorescent conformer A (Table 2). Higher ΦF upon excitation at shorter wavelength may also be correlated with excitation to a higher vibrational level, leading to the conformational change and population of emissive conformers B and D. However, calculated energy barriers for the conformational change in S1 are larger than in S0 (Table S2 in the ESI†), indicating that all conformational changes except D → B are improbable during the S1 lifetimes. Taking into account rotational lifetimes observed for methoxyanthracene where interconversion between the rotamers was observed,503–5 seem to have similar photophysical properties since conformational change D → B probably takes place in S1.
Fluorescence spectra for 1–5 were measured at different temperatures. For 1 and 2, at higher temperatures the fluorescence decreases, but for 3–5 the trend is opposite (see Fig. 7 and Fig. S17, S20, S28, S31 in the ESI†). The increase of ΦF with temperature for 3–5 is in accord with the emission being observed from the less populated conformers B–D whose content in the solution increases with temperature. By assuming that the rate constant for fluorescence from the conformers is not temperature dependent, for carbaldehyde 3 the energy barrier for fluorescence was estimated from the ΦF dependence on temperature by applying Arrhenius equation (Fig. 4 bottom and eqn (S4) in the ESI†). The slope of 640 ± 40 K−1 corresponds to an activation energy of 0.05 eV (1.2 ± 0.1 kcal mol−1) which may be related to the calculated barrier for the OH bond rotational in S1 and conversion 3D → 3B. Since the fluorescence quantum yield generally decreases with temperature which was not accounted for in the estimation of Ea, the value may also represent a lower limit for the conversion of conformers in S0. For example, the calculated barrier for conversion 3B → 3D in S0 is 0.16 eV.
 Fig. 7  Fluorescence spectra of 3 in CH3CN (λex = 420 nm) at different temperatures (top) and dependence of the ln(Φ0/Φ) on 1/T (bottom), linear fitting of the data to Arrhenius equation gives the value for the slope of 640 ± 40 K−1. 
The decays for the fluorescence of 1–3 in CH3CN are single exponential indicating existence of one emissive species in S1. For 1 and 2 this decay probably corresponds to conformer A, whereas for 3 it is related to the decay from the exited state of conformer B or D. Single exponential decays measured with the SPC set-up used, did not explicitly indicate that ESIPT in CH3CN takes place. However, ΦF for 1 and 2 are significantly lower and S1 lifetimes are shorter than for the parent 2-anthrol (10) in CH3CN (ΦF = 0.88, τ = 25.3 ns).51 Faster decays for the fluorescence of the carbaldehydes indicates the nonradiative deactivation from S1, which in principle may be due to ESIPT that populates nonfluorescent keto-tautomers, or intersystem crossing (ISC) that populates triplet states. On the contrary, the fluorescent lifetime for 3 in CH3CN is comparable to the one for 2-anthrol, due to emission taking place from conformer B or D that cannot undergo ESIPT or ISC (vide infra). However, 3B or 3D are weakly populated, so the ΦF is low.
Decay of fluorescence for 1 and 2 in cyclohexane and for 3 in EtOAc was best fit to a function corresponding to the sum of two exponentials with both pre-exponential factors being positive. If the emission from keto-tautomers was detected, than the emission kinetics collected at long wavelength where only keto-tautomers emit would include a growth component with a negative pre-exponential factor because the keto-tautomers are formed in the S1 state. The likely reason for the observed dual fluorescence for 1–3 in cyclohexane or EtOAc, or for 4 and 5 in CH3CN is the presence of conformers which have different S1 lifetimes (see above).
Calculations of ESIPT pathway
ESIPT requires that a translocation of charge from the hydroxyl to the aldehyde group takes place upon electronic excitation. Therefore, the different propensity of 1A, 2A and 3A for ESIPT can be understood from differences in the electron density of the corresponding S1 and S0 states shown in Fig. 8. Blue regions indicate an increase of electron density in the excited state with respect to the ground state, whereas red areas indicate the reduction of the electron density.
 Fig. 8  Projection of the electron density difference between the S1 and S0 states on the electron isodensity surface of S0 at the minimum energy geometry of S0. 1A (left), 2A (middle) and 3A (right). Areas of depletion (increase) of electron density in the excited states are shown in red (blue). 

Fig. 8 shows that 1A and 2A cannot undergo ESIPT. Moreover, the S1 potential energy curve along the ESIPT coordinate has a single well corresponding to the reactants, 1A and 2A and no evidence for stable keto-tautomers 1-K-A and 2-K-A was found. On the other hand, minima have been located on the S1 surfaces of 1A and 2A corresponding to isomers 1-K-B and 2-K-B in which rotation about the formally double CC bond takes place (Fig. 9). However, the energy of these structures is comparable to the energy of the corresponding FC geometries. Specifically, the energy of 1-K-B is almost isoenergetic with 1A and the energy of 2-K-B is 0.25 eV (5.77 kcal mol−1) lower than the energy of the 2A FC geometry. While the solvent can modify these values to some extent we believe that the population of both 1-K-B and 2-K-B tautomers is quite unlikely owing to the energy barrier for CC bond rotation that needs to be surmounted on the way to the formation of photoproducts 1-K-B and 2-K-B. However, these tautomers may be populated by solvent-assisted ESIPT in protic solvent, accounting for the complete fluorescence quenching.

From Fig. 8 it is evident that a substantial migration of charge from the hydroxyl to the aldehyde group takes place only in 3A. This sets the stage for ESIPT. Fig. 10 shows the potential-energy profiles of the electronic ground state and of the two lowest excited states, the optically bright La(ππ*) and dark Lb(ππ*) states, along the proton-transfer reaction path. The driving coordinate is the O–H bond length of the phenolic OH group. The graph describes the movement of the proton from the phenolic OH to the aldehyde group. The potential-energy profile of the La state exhibits a shoulder along the proton transfer coordinate, but supports no minimum on the reactant side. The movement of the proton has an opposite effect on the energies of the La(ππ*) and the electronic ground state. While the energy of the La(ππ*) steeply decreases from 3.64 to 1.72 eV, the energy of the ground state increases and the two potential energy surfaces intersect at an O–H distance of ∼1.7 Å. Thus, 3A deactivates non-radiatively to the electronic ground state. Once on the ground electronic state, one would expect that the gradient of the ground state potential energy surface drives the proton back to the phenolic OH group.
 Fig. 10  Energy profiles (in eV) of the electronic ground state (S0, blue) and the La(ππ*) (red) and Lb(ππ*) (green) states of 3A. The energy profiles were obtained by linear interpolation in internal coordinates between the FC and CI geometries. The length of the intramolecular hydrogen bond is given in Å. The insets show the FC and CI geometries (energy profiles including also the two lowest triplet states are shown in Fig. S35 and Cartesian coordinates are given in the ESI†). 
However, the 3-K-A conformer with rotated H-atom bond has been locate on the ground state surface, 2.05 eV above the global minimum. Due to the large excess in kinetic energy ∼2 eV (46.12 kcal mol−1) that the system has acquired in going from the FC region to the CI, the conformer can be populated. For the rotated conformer the La(ππ*) state is found vertically 1.29 eV (29.73 kcal mol−1) higher in energy. In addition, one can consider the 3-K-B isomer located on the ground state surface 1.89 eV above the global minimum, but the structure is unstable on the La(ππ*) surface and optimization leads to CI with the ground state.
Triplet excited state properties of 1–3
From the above considerations, it is evident that the low ΦF of 1 and 2 cannot be attributed to ESIPT. Therefore, we considered the possibility that low-lying triplet excited states of the most abundant conformers 1A and 2A get populated. Table 5 compiles vertical excitation energies to the lowest two triplet states of 1A, 2A and 3D computed at the Smin0 and Smin1 geometries, while Fig. S32–S35 in the ESI,† show the energy profiles of the relevant singlet and triplet excited states in the region from Smin0 to Smin1.

Comparing the vertical excitation energies of 1A to the S1 and T2 state one finds an energy difference of −0.08 eV (−1.84 kcal mol−1) at Smin0 and −0.34 eV (−7.84 kcal mol−1) at Smin1. For 2A (Tables S2 and S4, ESI†), these values are 0.08 eV (1.84 kcal mol−1) at Smin0 and −0.26 eV (−5.99 kcal mol−1) at Smin1. In both cases the energy gap between the S1 and T2 states is relatively small. However, in 1A the energy gap increases when going from the FC geometry to Smin1 while in 2A the ordering of the S1 and T2 states is exchanged meaning that in the region of the configurational space encompassing the relaxation pathway from FC to Smin1 the two states cross. In addition, in the Smin1 region where the system is effectively trapped, the S1–T2 gap is smaller for 2A than for 1A. Therefore, without assuming a priori a large difference in the spin–orbit couplings in the two systems, the population of T2 should be favored in 2A. Turning to 3D one finds S1–T2 energy gaps of 0.05 eV (1.15 kcal mol−1) at the Smin0 geometry and −0.61 eV (14.06 kcal mol−1) at the Smin1 geometry. Here, the larger slope of the S1 surface points to a fast relaxation from the FC region to the S1 minimum. Once in the region of the S1 minimum, the T2 state is too high in energy to be efficiently populated by ISC. Consequently, considering energies of excited singlet and triplet states, efficient ISC and triplet population are anticipated for 1 and 2, but not for 3.
Laser flash photolysis (LFP)
LFP was used to detect the keto-tautomers 1K–5K, triplet excited states, or other plausible intermediates in the photochemistry of 1–5 (for all transient spectra see Fig. S36–S49 in the ESI†). The samples were excited by a YAG laser at 355 nm, or in some cases in the LFP experiments of 3 at 266 nm. The spectra were measured in CH3CN and CH3CN–H2O, where protic solvent was anticipated to affect the ESIPT efficiency. Moreover, the measurements were performed in N2- and O2-purged solutions, where O2 is expected to quench triplet excited states.
In N2 purged CH3CN solution of 1, a transient was detected absorbing over the whole spectrum with maxima at 375 and 485 nm (Fig. S36 and S37 in the ESI†). The transient was formed within the laser pulse and it decayed to the baseline with non-exponential kinetics. However, when the laser power was reduced, the decay could be fit to a single exponential function with k = (6 ± 2) × 104 s−1 (τ = 15 ± 2 μs). The transient was quenched with O2 (in O2-purged CH3CN k = 3 × 107 s−1, τ = 33 ns), so we assigned this transient to the triplet excited state of 1. Thus, non-exponential decay kinetics in N2-purged solution can be attributed to triplet–triplet annihilation. In O2 purged CH3CN solution of 1, at short delay after the laser pulse (40 ns), a negative signal was detected due to fluorescence, whereas at longer delays (60 ns) the triplet is observed, and after its decay no other transient was detected. Addition of H2O to the O2-purged CH3CN did not change the appearance of the transient spectra or decay kinetics of the triplet state of 1.
Similar to 1, in the N2-purged CH3CN solution of 2 we detected the triplet excited state. It absorbs over the whole spectrum and has maxima at 375 and 525 nm. The triplet is formed within the laser pulse and its signal decays to the baseline with unimolecular kinetics k = (1.8 ± 0.1) × 105 s−1 (τ = 5.5 ± 0.1 μs). In O2-purged solution the triplet is quenched (k = 2.8 × 107 s−1, τ = 35 ns). In addition to the triplet, in N2-purged solution, at 300–400 nm we detected a different short-lived transient with the lifetime of τ ≈ 12 ns (see Fig. S38 and S39 in the ESI†). The transient was tentatively assigned to keto-tautomer 2-K, although calculations point to inefficient ESIPT. However, due to limits for the time resolution of the LFP set-up, no further experiments were warranted, so unambiguous assignment of the additional transient was not possible.
Transient absorption spectra for 3 are significantly different then for 1 and 2. In N2-purged CH3CN solution in the visible part of the spectrum, at short delays a negative signal due to fluorescence was detected, and at longer delays a positive signal with a maximum at 370 nm (Fig. S40 in the ESI†) was observed. Since the maximum of the absorption almost coincides with the excitation wavelength of 355 nm, the sample was excited at 266 nm to get a better quality spectrum (Fig. 11). The transient with the maximum at 370 nm was formed within the laser pulse and its decay was fit to a sum of two exponentials with k = (3.2 ± 0.1) × 107 s−1, (τ = 31 ± 1 ns); and k = (2.7 ± 0.1) × 106 s−1, (τ = 360 ± 10 ns). In O2-purged solutions the short-lived transient was not quenched, whereas the long-lived was. Thus, in O2-purged solution one transient was detected with a maximum of absorption at 370 nm and mono-exponential decay kinetics k = (3.3 ± 0.1) × 107 s−1, (τ = 30 ± 2 ns). The short-lived transient was assigned to keto-tautomer 3-K, whereas the long-lived transient (360 ns) probably corresponds to the triplet excited state of 3.
 Fig. 11  Transient absorption spectrum of 3 in O2-purged CH3CN obtained by exciting at 266 nm with a delay of 40 ns after the laser flash (inset: decay at 380 nm). 
To verify the assignment of the transient with a maximum at 370 nm to 3-K, the LFP measurements were performed for solutions of 3 in CH3CN–H2O (1:1) and CH3CN–D2O (1:1) which were optically matched at the excitation wavelength (355 nm) under oxygen. Due to a primary isotope effect which should affect the ESIPT kinetics, as well as the kinetics for the decay of keto-tautomer, it was anticipated that in D2O the transient would be formed with lower initial absorbance right after laser excitation and it would have slower decay kinetics. Surprisingly, we observe a negative isotope effect for the transient formation (judged from the initial absorbance for the transient kH/kD = 0.7–0.8), whereas the transient decay kinetics is similar in both solvents, τD2O = 91 ± 1 ns, and τH2O = 91 ± 5 ns.
Negative isotope effects have been documented for systems where the proton transfer equilibrium is reached first, followed by a slower different rate determining step takes place.52,53 Consequently, in our system we propose that ESIPT takes place in an ultrafast process (femtosecond timescale) giving keto-tautomer 3-K-A, that rapidly undergoes back proton transfer to 3A. However, we have probably detected keto-tautomer 3-K-A′ that is formed from high energy tautomer 3-K-A in a slower process (in picoseconds) not involving proton transfer (Scheme 1). Thus, with the setup used that has a resolution in nanoseconds, only 3-K-A′ was detected, formed within the laser pulse. Transient absorption spectra for 4 and 5 were very similar to those for 3. In the transient absorption spectra of 4 and 5 in CH3CN, a transient was detected absorbing at 300–400 nm, whereas in the visible part of the spectrum the negative signal due to the fluorescence dominates. The signal with the maximum at 370 nm for 4 has decays with τ = 20–30 ns, and for 5τ = 28 ± 1 ns. The decay and the intensity of the transient formation were not affected by O2, so they were assigned to 4-K or 5-K, respectively. In O2-purged CH3CN the lifetime of the transient is τ = 28 ± 2 ns (4-K), and τ = 38 ± 2 ns (5-K). Addition of H2O affected the transient formation efficiency, they were formed about three times less efficiently, based on the signal intensity at 370 nm, immediately after the laser pulse for the matched absorbances at the excitation wavelength. However, the decay is slower in the aqueous solution with τ = 30–40 ns, and τ = 50 ± 2 ns. In summary, LFP measurements allowed for the detection of triplet states from 1 and 2 and keto-tautomers from 3–5.

Discussion
Photophysical properties and photochemical reactivity of anthrol carbaldehdyes 1–3 are significantly different from the behavior known for ESIPT observed with naphthol carbaldehdyes. From the qualitative investigation of frontier molecular orbitals involved in the population of S1, the above findings for 1–3 are at first sight counter-intuitive. For all three derivatives the most stable conformer is the syn–syn (conformer A) with an intramolecular H-bond. Furthermore, the LUMO orbital is significantly localized at the C–C bond between the anthracene and the carbonyl, making it partly double bond in character, and the LUMO has an orbital lobe on the carbonyl oxygen, leading to the expectation that the carbonyl should have an increased electron density in S1 (Fig. 3, and Fig. S3, S7 in the ESI†). The fluorescence solvatochromic properties for 1–3 are in agreement with a polarized S1 state, which is a prerequisite for ESIPT to occur. However, the quantitative investigation for the electron density difference between S1 and S0 (Fig. 5) clearly demonstrates that electronic excitation leads to translocation of charge needed for ESIPT in anthrol 3 only, where the electron density in S1 increases at the carbonyl oxygen. On the contrary, the electron density in S1 is located on the carbonyl C-atom in 1 and in the anthracene rings in 2. Hence, 3 undergoes barrierless ESIPT, whereas for 1 and 2 formation of keto-tautomers is not plausible since it would be highly endergonic, and the corresponding 1-K-A and 2-K-A do not have minima on the excited state surface. On the other hand, ESIPT has been observed for both 1,2- and 2,3-substituted naphthol carbaldehydes derivatives.41–44 Thus, 1,2-substituted naphthols derivatives (analogous to 1 and 2) show emission of phototautomers in aprotic solvents. However, in protic solvents where the intramolecular H-bond between the carbonyl group and the phenolic OH is perturbed, the emission of the locally excited state of naphthols was detected,41,43 whereas 1 and 2 are not emissive. Comparing naphthol and anthrols clearly indicate that additional fused benzene ring affects the electronic distribution in S1 leading to different photophysical properties and photochemical reactivity.
Due to generally high stabilization of the syn–syn conformer A compared to B–D conformers, with larger energy differences between the conformers in S1 (Table S2, ESI†), the conformer conversions are not likely to occur during excited state lifetimes, except for 3D → 3B for which a low energy barrier of only 0.09 eV was found. For 1–3 in CH3CN, single exponential decays of fluorescence indicate the presence of only one emitting species in S1. On the other hand, the likely reason for the observed dual fluorescence for 1,2 in cyclohexane and 4–5 in CH3CN with a low contribution of one decay component is probably due to a small contribution from conformers B–D that are populated in S0. Consequently, photophysical properties and photochemical reactivity of 1–3 are mostly governed by the NEER principle (non-equilibration of the excited-state rotamers).54,55 That is, the conformer distribution in S0 is mostly maintained upon excitation to S1 due to improbable conformer interconversions in S1 imposed by high energy barriers. Since anthrols 1 and 2 are not reactive in ESIPT, their most abundant conformers 1A and 2A are emissive. Therefore, ΦF for 1 and 2 is about ten times higher than for 3.
Shorter singlet lifetimes for 1 and 2 compared to 3 and 2-anthrol are due to nonradiative decay from S1 by ISC. Assuming that difference in singlet lifetimes for 2 and 2-anthrol is only due to ISC, the rate constant for ISC in 2 can be approximated, kISC ≈ 1 × 108 s−1. This rate represents only an upper limit since ISC is in competition with internal conversion (IC). The obvious reason for the efficient ISC in anthracene derivatives 1 and 2 is the existence of the triplet T2 state with energy that is comparable to the FC or relaxed S1 state energies (Table 5). For the analogous naphthols, the energy differences between the singlet and triplet excited states are larger, and ISC takes place only in the non-hydrogen bonded conformers in protic solvents,41 where the ESIPT does not compete with ISC.
Although anthrol 3 reacts in ESIPT, it does not exhibit the typical dual fluorescence, as is the case with salicylaldehyde or naphthol carbaldehyde derivatives. Namely, along the ESIPT trajectory, a conical intersection with the S0 leads to the formation of 3-K tautomer in the hot ground state. In this sequence conformer A is repopulated, but the amount of energy supplied by the IC (1.73 eV) may lead to conformational changes. The fluorescence is detected only from the locally excited state of non-reactive, less populated conformers 3B or 3D. Consequently, ΦF increases with temperature and depends on the excitation wavelength. This finding is unprecedented to the ubiquitous molecules undergoing ESIPT where the characteristic Stokes-shifted emission was observed.38–44
Keto-tautomer 3-K was detected by LFP. The negative isotope effect for the formation of the detected transient indicated that this transient corresponded to conformer 3-K-A′ whose formation may be possible from the hot-ground state of 3-K-A reached via a S1/S0 conical intersection, or to stereoisomer 3-K-B populated by H2O-assisted formal ESIPT. In analogy, the keto-tautomers detected by LFP from structurally similar molecules 4 and 5 probably correspond to the analogous structures 4-K-A′ and 5-K-A′. Population of these keto-tautomers that have longer lifetimes then the usual emissive keto-tautomers formed by ESIPT may find applications in different aspects of material science or in organic synthesis if some suitable quenchers could be found that would react with 3-K to 5-K in a Diels–Alder reaction giving complex molecular structures. Formation of keto-tautomer 3-K from 3-A is in principle possible also on the triplet excited state surface (see Fig. S35 in the ESI†). However, it can be accomplished only by use of a triplet sensitizer that would excited 3A to the triplet state. Direct excitation of 3A leads to deactivation via ESIPT so that the triplet state can never be reached.
Although tautomers formed by ESIPT from anthrol carbaldehydes are not emissive, photochemically reactive anthrols may have numerous applications, primarily due to the fact that they can be excited by visible light. Thus, applicability of these molecules as photoswitches, photostabilizers, temperature or H2O sensors in material science as well as in biology is anticipated.
Conclusions
Photophysical properties and photochemical ESIPT reactivity of anthrol carbaldehydes 1–5, compared to the corresponding naphthol carbaldehydes, is unexpected and unprecedented. Surprisingly, 1,2-disubstituted anthrol carbaldehydes 1 and 2 are not ESIPT reactive, whereas 2,3-disubstituted anthrols 3–5 undergo efficient barrierless ultrafast ESIPT. However, unlike the usual molecules undergoing ESIPT, the typical dual emission from locally excited states and ESIPT tautomers were not observed since ESIPT proceeds via a conical intersection with S0 delivering keto-tautomer in the hot ground state. It is an important finding, which calls in question some literature precedent where ESIPT was reported not to take place due to the lack of tautomer emission. Consequently, findings described herein have significant impact in understanding ESIPT reactivity in general. We fully disclosed reasons that lead to different photophysical properties and reactivity of naphthol and anthrol carbaldehydes. The fact that a small change of chromophore by addition of one benzene ring has profound consequences should be taken into account when designing molecules for different applications.
Experimental and computational methods
Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements
Stock solutions of 1–5 were prepared by dissolving 2–3 mg of the compound in 10 mL CH3CN (corresponding to concentrations of 6.0 × 10−4–1.3 × 10−3 M) For the absorption and fluorescence measurements, the stock solutions were diluted 20–100 times so the final concentrations in CH3CN were 1 × 10−5–3 × 10−5 M. Absorption measurements were performed on a Cary 1 spectrometer. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a PTI QM40 fluorometer. All slits (excitation and emission) were set to a bandpass of 2 nm (5 nm in case of 3–5). The spectra were corrected for fluctuations in the lamp intensity and transmission of optics. Fluorescence quantum yields were determined by use of acridine yellow as reference (ΦF = 0.57),49 which prior to the measurements was recrystallized three times from CH3OH. Carbaldehydes 1 and 2 were excited at 410, 420 or 430 nm, and the emission was collected in the range 430–800 nm. For carbaldehydes 3–5 the excitation was at 400, 420 and 450 nm or 420 and 450 nm and the emission was detected in the range 440–800 nm. Two or three quantum yields were calculated (eqn (S2) in the ESI†) and the mean value was reported. The measurements were performed in the temperature range 20–54 °C, and the temperature was maintained by a thermostat which was calibrated.
Fluorescence decays, collected over 1023 time channels, were obtained on an Edinburgh Instruments OB920 single photon counter using a light emitting diode for excitation at 405 nm. The instrument response function (IRF), using LUDOX as the scatterer, were recorded at the same wavelength as the excitation wavelength and had the half width of the IRF ≈0.2 ns. The time increment per channel was 0.098 ns for 1 and 2, or 0.049 ns for 3–5. Emission decays for samples were recorded until they reached 3 × 103 counts in the peak channel at 500 and 530 nm for 1 and 2, and at 550 and 575 nm for 3–5. Global analysis of two or three decays was performed by fitting the decay to sums of exponentials using global Gaussian-weighted non-linear least-squares fitting based on Marquardt–Levenberg minimization implemented in the Fast software package from Edinburgh Instruments. In the global analysis, the decay times were linked for the traces collected at different wavelengths. The fitting parameters (decay times and pre-exponential factors, eqn (S1) in the ESI†) were determined by minimizing the reduced chi-square χ2 and graphical methods were used to judge the quality of the fit that included plots of the weighted residuals vs. channel number.
Laser flash photolysis (LFP)
All LFP studies were performed on a system previously described56 using as an excitation source a pulsed Nd:YAG laser at 355 or 266 nm (<20 mJ per pulse), with a pulse width of 10 ns. Static cells (7 mm × 7 mm) were used and the solutions were purged with nitrogen or oxygen for 20 min prior to performing the measurements. Absorbances at 355 or 266 nm were ∼0.3–0.5.
Calculations
The ground state geometries of four possible conformers of carbaldehydes 1–3 were optimized using the MP2 method with the resolution of identity approximation (RI).57 The Dunning correlation consistent basis set augmented with polarization and diffuse functions, aug-cc-pVDZ, was used throughout the work.58 The relative energies of the conformers were determined in the gas phase. To investigate the effect of the solvent on the energy ordering a continuum solvation model, the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) was used.55 For the simulation of bulk acetonitrile (CH3CN) and ethyl acetate (EtOAC) environments we chose dielectric constant of ε = 37.5 and ε = 6.0, respectively. All calculations were performed with Turbomole 7.0.57
The algebraic diagrammatic construction to second order (ADC(2)) method was selected to investigate excited electronic states.59,60 The method is suitable for investigating low lying ππ* states in fused aromatic ring systems as the ordering of the La(ππ*) or Lb(ππ*) states and the interstate gap are typically well described with ADC(2).61,62 Adiabatic excitation energies were computed by optimizing both ground and excited state structures.
