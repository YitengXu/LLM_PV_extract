    , Accepted 14th November 2021First published on 15th November 2021AbstractAn asymmetric zinc phthalocyanine dye (KH1) bearing three 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy donor groups and one carboxylic acid anchoring group was synthesized as a sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The DSSC based on KH1 showed a 3.12% power conversion efficiency (PCE) under AM 1.5G conditions. Upon addition of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a coadsorbent, the PCE slightly enhanced to 3.21%, probably because the bulky donor groups on the dye can efficiently inhibit dye aggregation. Furthermore, this blue dye (KH1) was also applied to combine with a commercially available red-brown metal-free organic dye (RK1) for a co-sensitized DSSC, which exhibited an improved PCE of 6.67% than RK1 alone (5.75%). Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP/def2-SVP) and time-dependent DFT (TPSSh/def2-SVP) were performed to study the structural, electronic and optical properties of eight isomers of KH1. We found that the isomers are nearly isoenergetic structures (0.38–1.07 kcal mol−1) and the electronic absorption spectra show two strong Q bands in the visible region (625–660 nm) and a less intense B band in the UV region (345–350 nm) for all the isomers, in agreement with the UV-Vis spectrum with deviations of up to 0.15 eV. Excited states that show a contribution of the carboxyl moiety in the unoccupied MOs at regions of 370–420 nm and 650 nm suggest that electron injection into the semiconductor would be favored at these wavelengths. These results are coherent with the IPCE values determined in this study for KH1 where the maximum values are near to 400 nm and 690 nm. The adsorption of each of the isomers on a TiO2 cluster was analyzed resulting in energetically favorable complexes. The results demonstrate that the co-sensitization of phthalocyanine and organic dyes may lead to further improvement of photovoltaic performance. In addition, theoretical calculations may provide a molecular comprehension of the electronic and optical properties of the dyes.
Introduction
Global warming which is closely related to the tremendous consumption of fossil fuels and emission of carbon dioxide and increasing energy needs all around the world requires the usage of renewable energy resources free of environmental pollution such as solar energy.1 In solar energy generation, using solar cells is an attractive way of achieving a sustainable supply with electricity. Many studies have been carried out on this source in recent years2–4 because of solar energy being largely available to cover the energy demand of the whole of humanity.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are an option for conventional silicon based solar cells owing to their advantages of easy and fast fabrication, low cost and high photoelectric conversion efficiencies.5–8 Different dyes such as metal organic, organic and natural dyes are used as sensitizers for solar energy conversion in DSSCs.9–12 Metal complex dyes have some advantages such as high solar cell efficiency and stability, easy electron capture and slow electron–hole recombination when compared to the other dyes.12,13 Over the last few decades, intensive studies have been done on the development of these dyes used as sensitizers in DSCCs.7,9–12,14,15
The partial absorption of the solar spectrum is one of the central problems that DSSCs are currently facing.7 Co-sensitization, which involves the use of two or more different dyes that have complementary spectral responses, is a powerful technique to enhance the light-harvesting abilities of DSSCs.16 Co-sensitization of small organic dyes with larger organometallic complexes is advantageous because they can fit into the empty interstices which gives a higher overall coverage of the surface area of the metal oxide nanoparticles. Also, small organic dyes reduce the aggregation of organometallic complexes.17
Metalloporphyrinoid dyes have attracted attention as potential light-harvesting sensitizers for solar energy conversion due to their extended absorption bands in the visible region.18–21 In particular, zinc porphyrins and phthalocyanines (Pcs) with comparatively long-lived excited singlet states have been commonly used as sensitizers in DSSCs,21–23 with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in certain cases exceeding 10%.24–27 However, many other metal complexes suffer from short-lived excited singlet states as a result of fast relaxation to the triplet state and the ground state due to the heavy atom effect. Diverse synthetic strategies have been improved to satisfy the demand for achieving dyes with optimal performance such as suitable energy levels for charge injection and dye regeneration, enhanced absorption in the visible and NIR regions and an anchoring group to attach to the semiconducting materials.11
Owing to their important properties such as high chemical stability, the diversity of substituents in the peripheral or non-peripheral positions, and thermal and light stability, Pc dyes have recently attracted considerable interest both in scientific work and in industrial applications.28 Furthermore, Pc dyes have been found to display long wavelength absorption and fluorescence in the range of 650 nm to 800 nm.29 However, Pc compounds have a strong tendency for aggregation in water and other polar solvents due to their planar structures.30–32 In order to avoid the issues encountered with aggregation of the Pc, it was envisaged that the presence of the bulky substituents located at the peripheral position on the Pc rings would minimize the tendency to form aggregates.33,34 According to the literature on DSSC studies35 the presence of a tert-butyl group as a substituent on the Pc core not only avoids the formation of molecular aggregates but also optimizes the photocurrent of the device with efficiencies. Considering the importance of the Pcs having tert-butyl groups for DSSC studies, we report on the use of “push” (tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy) and “pull” (carboxylic acid) functionalized zinc phthalocyanine as a dye photosensitizer, Scheme 1. The carboxylate functional group is used to anchor the dye to the semiconductor surface. The bulky tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy groups enhance solubility and minimize the aggregation of metallo phthalocyanines (MPcs). The recovered solubility leads to the effective impregnation of the photoanode from a solution of a sensitizer. In the light of this information, co-sensitization of KH1 a newly synthesized organometallic compound and RK1 a commercial organic dye was also studied for DSSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and spectroscopic characterization

Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of the new sterically hindered asymmetric Zn(II)Pc (KH1). An asymmetric Zn(II)Pc derivative was synthesized by the cyclotetramerization reaction with phthalonitriles 1 and 2 in the presence of anhydrous zinc acetate, DBU, as a strong nitrogen base and n-pentanol. The statistical condensation method was used for the preparation of the asymmetric Zn(II)Pc. Mixed condensation of 4-(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy)phthalonitrile (1) and 3,4-dicyanobenzoic acid (2) afforded the asymmetric Pc (KH1). Generally, this method predicts that the reaction of two different phthalonitriles in a 3:1 ratio will afford a mixture of products. So, the same molar ratio of two dinitrile derivatives 1 and 2 was tried to synthesise the desired product. KH1 was separated by flash column chromatography from the corresponding symmetric Pc derivatives and the other products. A series of characterization techniques including elemental analysis, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry have been used to characterize the obtained structure; the spectroscopic data were confirmed with the structure of the compound. The results are given in the experimental section. All spectra related to KH1 are given in the ESI† file (Fig. S1–S5).
The IR spectrum of KH1 indicates the asymmetric Pc structure with OH group vibrations at around 3274 cm−1 associated with carboxylic acid and the characteristic C–H stretching vibrations of t-butyl groups appeared in the range of 2955–2870 cm−1. The mass spectra of this compound were obtained using both MALDI-TOFF and Micromass Q-Tof techniques. The molecular ion peak of KH1 was observed at m/z: 1276.43 [M + 2H]+ and [M + H]+ 1275.57, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum of KH1 exhibits the carboxylic acid OH proton at 10.90 ppm as a broad singlet, aromatic protons belonging to the Pc core between 9.71 and 7.90 ppm as multiplets and aromatic protons of phenoxy groups between 7.42 and 7.01 as broad singlet peaks. The ratio of the aromatic protons of the Pc macrocyle to 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy and carboxylic acid protons confirmed the asymmetric structure of KH1. The 13C NMR spectral data of KH1 given in the experimental section are also in good agreement with the proposed structure.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of KH1, RK1 and KH1 + RK1 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution are displayed in Fig. 1a and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. The absorption bands of the KH1 dye in THF solution consist of a Soret band at 300–400 nm (λmax = 350 nm) and a sharp Q-band at 650–750 nm (λmax = 675 nm) due to π–π* transitions. The RK1 dye exhibits two different absorption bands which are the π–π* transition at 250–400 nm (λmax = 327 nm) and intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) at 400–600 nm (λmax = 478 nm). KH1 + RK1 solution prepared by taking a 1:1 ratio from KH1 and RK1 shows an extended spectral response range from the UV to the near-IR region. Fig. 1b illustrates the absorption spectra of KH1, RK1 and KH1 + RK1 on TiO2 films. Due to J-aggregation and interactions of KH1 and RK1 dyes with the TiO2 surface, the maximum absorption peaks compared to the solution are red shifted 10 nm and 21 nm, respectively. Similarly, the absorption bands of the co-sensitized system (KH1 + RK1) exhibited a slight bathochromic shift compared to the bands of KH1 and RK1 dyes alone, implying weak J-aggregation and interactions of these dyes with the TiO2 surface. The absorption spectrum of the KH1 dye on the TiO2 is slightly broadened with respect to that in solution, implying weak aggregation on TiO2 due to the presence of bulky donor groups in the dye.36 The combination of KH1 and RK1 dyes is expected to increase light harvesting efficiency in DSSCs by extending the spectral absorption range.37 As shown in Fig. 1b, for KH1 + RK1 the light absorption in the region of ∼ 400–600 nm increased compared to KH1 which enables harvesting of more light.38

Cyclic voltammetry was carried out to determine the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the KH1 dye and its corresponding voltammogram is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). As shown in Table 1, the LUMO level is above the TiO2 conduction band and the HOMO level is lower than the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte, ensuring efficient electron injection and good dye regeneration, respectively.39 It should be noted that the HOMO level is higher than that of our previous hexylsulfanyl electron donor-based asymmetric zinc phthalocyanine dye (GT4),40 which may be attributed to the relatively lower electron donating ability of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy groups.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The structure of RK1 is given in Fig. 2. In order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of KH1, the J–V characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under AM 1.5G standard illumination with I−/I3− electrolyte. The details for the procedure can be found in the (ESI†). The J–V curves of the DSSCs based on KH1, RK1, KH1 + RK1 and KH1 + CDCA systems are shown in Fig. 3a and b and their photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The DSSC based on the KH1 dye alone gave an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.12%, with a Jsc of 7.18 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.649 V, and a FF of 0.67. Under the same conditions, the DSSCs with dyes bearing hexylsulfanyl (GT4) and tert-butylsulfanyl (GT6) donor groups showed inferior photovoltaic performances of 2.51% (Jsc = 6.42 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.592 V, FF = 0.66) and 2.74% (Jsc = 7.08 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.595 V, FF = 0.65). When 0.1 mM CDCA as a co-adsorbent was included in the solution of the KH1 dye, the PCE was slightly improved to 3.21% (Jsc = 7.23 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.653 V, FF = 0.68). The slight improvement of PCE for KH1 can be rationalized by the fact that the dye aggregation may be weak or negligible.41,42 When the CDCA was increased to 0.3 mM, the Jsc, Voc and PCE values were decreased since the co-adsorption process reduces the amount of dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface (Fig. S7, ESI†).43 In contrast to KH1, the PCE for the DSSC with GT4 improved by 27% in the presence of 5 mM CDCA. Evidently, the three-dimensional or bulky electron donor groups in KH1 may lead to an aggregate-free dye layer and a surface blocking effect through steric hindrance on the TiO2 surface, favoring higher Jsc and Voc.44

In order to obtain a panchromatic solar cell for better photovoltaic performance, the co-sensitization technique was also applied to this blue phthalocyanine dye (KH1) together with a red-brown metal-free organic dye (RK1).45 For the co-sensitization, the TiO2 electrode was firstly immersed into RK1 solution for 6 h and then covered with KH1 for different immersion times. Similarly, the electrode was dipped into KH1 and RK1 solutions for 3 h and various immersion times, respectively (see the ESI† for details, Table S1). The best PCE of 6.67% (Jsc = 12.20 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.749 V, FF = 0.73) was obtained for the DSSC with a KH1 + RK1 (3h + 6h) co-sensitized system, while the DSSC based on the RK1 dye alone showed a PCE of 5.75% (Jsc = 11.53 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.723 V, FF = 0.69) (Fig. 3a and Table 2). Impressively, both Jsc and Voc were increased and the PCE improved by 16%. The enhancement of Jsc for KH1 + RK1 is mainly attributed to the increase of light absorption in the region of ∼ 400–600 nm when compared with KH1 (Fig. 2b), which enables harvesting of more light.38 Since the molecular size of RK1 is smaller than KH1, the small molecules fill the spaces of the large molecules and form a compact layer on the TiO2 surface during the co-sensitization process. As expected, the compact layer effectively blocks the recombination of injected electrons with electrolyte, resulting in a higher Voc.38
To further analyze the differences in Jsc, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the DSSCs based on the individual sensitizers and the co-sensitizers were measured and are plotted in Fig. 2b. In accordance with the absorption spectra on the TiO2 film, the DSSC based on KH1 shows a high IPCE in the range of ∼ 650–750 nm (maximum IPCE value of 47% at 685 nm), while the DSSC with RK1 is effective in the range of ∼ 400–600 nm (maximum IPCE value of 73% at 480 nm). For the co-sensitized system, the gap of the photoresponse in the range of ∼ 400–600 nm for KH1 is filled up by the contribution of RK1, resulting in an improved Jsc.16 It can also be seen that the IPCE values noticeably increase in the region of RK1, and decrease in the region of the Q band of KH1. This implies that RK1 occupies some sites of KH1 on the TiO2 surface. The IPCE values are also in good agreement with Jsc results in Table 2, indicating the advantage of the co-sensitization technique.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was conducted to investigate the charge recombination processes at the interfaces of the DSSCs. The major semicircle in the Nyquist plots is attributed to the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2 electrode/dye/electrolyte interface (Fig. 4a). The Rrec values of the DSSCs increased in the order of KH1 (84 Ω) < RK1 (119 Ω) < KH1 + RK1 (125 Ω), which are consistent with the variation trend of their Voc values. In other words, the larger Rrec indicates that the charge recombination can be suppressed efficiently, ensuring a higher Voc.46 The electron lifetimes (τe) estimated from the Bode plots are 5.87, 13.89 and 32.90 ms for KH1, RK1 and KH1 + RK1, respectively (Fig. 4b), which are also in good agreement with their Voc values. Therefore, the improvement of the photovoltage for the co-sensitizers is well explained by the Nyquist and Bode results.

Theoretical calculations

Molecular structures. 
A tetra substituted AB3-type phthalocyanine derivative can be obtained as a statistical mixture of eight regioisomers owing to the various possible positions of the substituted groups.47 In this section, we analyze the molecular and electronic structure of eight possible isomers for the system studied in this work (a–h), which differ in the position of the substituent in rings 2, 3 and 4 (Fig. 5). The molecular geometry of the isomeric conformations was fully optimized at the B3LYP/def2-SVP level of theory in the gas phase, in order to obtain the lowest energy geometry. Then, vibrational frequencies were calculated for each isomer to confirm that all structures were minimum energy states (all the frequencies obtained are positive). To guarantee that the minimum energy structure of each isomer is obtained, we started the optimization calculations with completely flat structures including the substituents. The optimized structures are shown in Fig. 6 as front and side views, and the absolute and relative energies obtained from the theoretical calculations are also included. All the optimized isomers present a planar macrocycle, as can be seen from the side view in Fig. 6, and the substituents (s) exhibit a bending angle ∠C(Pc)OC(s) of ∼121°. From the eight isomers studied, the most stable corresponds to conformation d. It can be seen that the relative energies have values in the range of 0.38–1.07 kcal mol−1 indicating that the differences in the molecular structures do not impact in a significant way on these energies. The structural changes are mainly due to the β position of the substituent 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy in the benzene ring of Pc. We also explore the aromaticity of rings 2, 3 and 4 where the substituents are coordinated to these rings and calculated the geometrical aromaticity index named HOMA (harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity).48 The HOMA values calculated are very similar (0.93) for the three rings and for all the isomers, which indicate that these rings are aromatic. These results indicate that the change of the substituent in the β position does not affect the aromaticity of the rings involved.

Theoretical electronic absorption spectra. 
In Table 3, we present the more relevant parameters obtained from the time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations for the Q and B bands and the main molecular orbitals that contribute to the electronic transitions. Since the simulation of the UV−Vis electronic absorption spectra depends on the size and nature of the molecular system, the choice of the functional is based on previous studies in macrocyclic systems.49–51 The TPSSh functional has shown good agreement with the experimental data, for this reason, we have chosen this functional to perform this work. We calculated the electronic spectrum for each one of the isomers (a–h) in the solution phase using the same solvent as that employed in the experiment (THF).

As expected, the results of the electronic spectra are very similar for the isomers that differ in their total energies with values of up to ∼1 kcal mol−1, as shown above. Although only one Q experimental band was found, the theoretical calculations predict for all isomers two strong Q bands in the visible region (625–660 nm) and one B band of less intensity in the UV region at around 345–350 nm. In all the cases, the Q bands correspond to the first and second singlet excited states (numbered as (1) and (2) in Table 3) while the B band is present between the excited states 30 to 40. While isomer h shows the longest absorption wavelength (Q) of 660 nm, isomer e (656 nm) predicts the Q band of larger intensity. Considering the experimental spectrum of this work for the system under study, the deviation computed for Q and B bands is in the range of 0.0–0.15 eV. These errors are minimal and are within the acceptable range for this type of calculation.52,53 The dipole moment was also calculated for the ground state of each isomer and shows that all isomers present a polarity, which is in the range of 0.83–5.03 Debye. The narrow range of polarity would explain the difficulty to separate the isomers in the sample used in this work.
On the other hand, the nature of the excited states is characterized by visualizing the charge density difference (CDD) plots, which takes the difference between the charge densities of the excited state and the ground state.55,56Fig. 7 shows the CDD plots of the Q and B bands as also the transition H → L+2 of d isomer, where the hole density is represented by green color and the electron density is represented by blue color. The CDD can further verify the charge transfer of the system. For both Q and B bands, the electron density is concentrated mainly in the core of the macrocycle and the hole density is distributed in almost the entire phthalocyanine. We note that the S1 excited state (Fig. 7) shows an electron region close to the carboxyl moiety. This fact is increased for the S17 state (H → L+2 transition), where the electron is strongly located on the carboxyl group while the hole density is found throughout the phthalocyanine. The latter demonstrates a significant charge separation between the carboxyl group and the rest of the molecule, which would favor the interaction between this group and the semiconductor TiO2. A similar behavior was found for the other isomers (Fig. S8, ESI†).

S1 and S2 correspond to Q bands, S32 to the B band and S17 corresponds to the H→L+2 transition. Blue represents the electron and green represents the hole. 


Molecular orbital analysis. 
For the d isomer, the two Q bands calculated are pure states. The Q band at 647 nm corresponds to a transition H → L and the Q band at 629 nm is a transition H → L+1. Both bands are transitions of the type π → π*. These molecular orbitals are located mainly in the macrocycle core, as shown in Fig. 8 but the LUMO shows a slight contribution of the carboxyl moiety. It is important to note that, except for the HOMO, the other occupied MOs have considerable contribution from substituent groups while LUMOs are mainly located in the whole phthalocyanine. No contribution of the metal atom (Zn) is observed. These results suggest a flow of charge from the substituent groups towards the region of the macrocycle. It is more difficult to analyze the B bands because the excited states are represented by several electronic transitions. To understand better these bands, we calculated the natural transition orbitals (NTOs)54 that give account of the whole excited state. The occupied and unoccupied NTOs show little contribution from the substituent groups and a strong contribution from the macrocycle core with a character of the type π → π*, which was similar to that observed in the LUMO. In summary, the computed Q and B bands predict the expected behavior of phthalocyanines.
 Fig. 8  Surfaces of the main molecular orbitals that participate in the electronic transitions of the d isomer. 
The other isomers have similar behavior of Q bands to isomer d, however, there are some differences in the occupied orbitals of the B band. For the latter, the b, e, f and g isomers have little contribution from the macrocycle core while a, c and h isomers have the same behavior as d with an important contribution of the core (Fig. S9, ESI†). Finally, a significant participation of the carboxyl moiety in the L+2 orbital was found in each isomer, which could favor the interaction with the semiconductor. For the d isomer, the transition H→L+2 corresponds to the excited singlet state S17, which is a pure excited state having only this electronic transition with an energy of 2.97 eV (417 nm). A similar behavior is found for the pure excited state S27 that is a H→L+3 transition with an energy of 3.34 eV (371 nm). In summary, the S1, S17 and S27 excited states showing a contribution of the carboxyl moiety in the unoccupied MOs suggest that the electron injection to the semiconductor would be favored at these wavelengths. These results are coherent with the IPCE values shown in Fig. 2 for KH1 where the maximum values are near to 400 nm and 690 nm.


Molecular electrostatic potential. 
We also explored the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) in the ground state of the isomers, which gives information about the electron-rich and electron-poor regions in the molecule.57Fig. 9 shows a surface of MEP for the d isomer. An electrophilic region (blue) on zinc is found that denotes an electron-poor site on the metal atom, as expected. While the four azomethine nitrogen atoms show strongly nucleophilic regions (red) because of the lone pairs of these atoms, the zones of the substituents are moderately electron-rich regions (green-yellow). In addition, a strong nucleophilic zone is observed on the carboxyl moiety which would be favorable to interact with the semiconductor. The same behavior was observed for the other isomers (Fig. S10, ESI†).

Effect of substituents on the zinc phthalocyanine framework. 
To understand the influence of substituents on the optical properties of the molecule, we have optimized the molecular structure of KH1 without a substituent, and also with 1, 2 and 3 substituents leading to a d isomer (Fig. S11, ESI†). The nomenclature used follows the numeration of the rings of Fig. 4, i.e. the system ZnPc_23 means that it has two substituents in rings 2 and 3. For this study we included seven new systems of this type besides the d isomer. Then for the optimized geometry, we calculated the TD-DFT spectrum of these molecules. Because it is not possible to compare the total SCF energy for the different number of electrons of the molecules, we analyze the HOMO and LUMO and the GAP between them as a measure of their reactivities (Table 4). Even though there is no unique trend, we found that the HOMO energy is lower when the number of substituents decreases, from the fully substituted (d isomer) to unsubstituted (ZnPc). A similar trend is obtained for LUMO energy. This one leads to an increase in the GAP from the d isomer to ZnPc and as a result a lower reactivity for the latter system.

TD-DFT calculations show that as the number of substituents increases from ZnPc to the d isomer, the molecule absorbs at a longer wavelength, which shows that the substituents have a bathochromic effect, mainly in the Q bands of the systems (Table 5). A substituent effect on the B band of these molecules is minimal as can be seen for the absorption bands in this table. The results demonstrate the importance of the substitution in phthalocyanines and a way for tuning the absorption of these compounds.

Formation of the isomer–TiO2 complex. 
We have analyzed the adsorption of each of the isomers on the TiO2 semiconductor. All the complexes were formed by the anchoring of the –COOH group of the isomer on a TiO2 anatase (101) cluster model. The semiconductor is frozen in the optimization of the isomer–TiO2 complex to avoid its deformation and preserve its anatase phase structure. The TiO2 model contains one layer and it has fourfold and fivefold coordinated Ti atoms (Ti4C and Ti5C) and threefold and twofold coordinated O atoms (O3C and O2C). The H(OH) atom of the carboxyl is bonded to one oxygen atom O2C in the optimization. All complexes were optimized using the Quantum ATK package.58
The optimized structure and the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of the d-TiO2 complex are shown in Fig. 10. The interaction between d and TiO2 occurs through a monodentate interaction between the –O(OH) of the carboxyl and titanium atom (Ti5C) at 1.93 Å, showing a covalent interaction as occurs with the O–Ti bonds in TiO2. Similar distances have been reported in other complexes with the anatase TiO2 (101) surface.59 We also found the formation of one weak hydrogen bond H(TiO2)⋯O(COO) at distances of 2.45 Å. For complexes a, b, c, e, f, g and h-TiO2 (Fig. S11, ESI†) a distance of 2.04, 1.91, 1.95, 1.92, 2.02, 1.97, and 1.96 Å, respectively, is found for –O interacting with the Ti atom and the formation of one hydrogen bonding occurs at distances of 2.04, 2.55, 2.41, 2.56, 2.16, 2.30 and 2.33 Å, respectively. The results suggest that these two interactions contribute to stabilizing the adsorption of Pc on the TiO2 cluster.
 Fig. 10  Optimized molecular structure and the HOMO and LUMO for the d-TiO2 complex. 
To determine if the complex is energetically favorable, we calculated the binding energy of the d-TiO2 complex using the equation ΔEint = Ed-TiO2 − (ETiO2 + Ed). According to this definition, a negative value of ΔEint indicates a favorable binding. The energy of the fragments (TiO2 and d) was calculated on the optimized geometry of the isolated species in the gas phase. The binding energy of the complex is −0.58 eV indicating that the interaction between the fragments is exergonic and the complex is energetically favorable. The calculation of ΔEint for the other isomers predicts in all the cases exergonic interactions following the decreasing order in the binding energy (eV): c (−0.73) > b (−0.65) > h (−0.57) > e (−0.53) > g (−0.47) > f (−0.46) > a (−0.40).
On the other hand, Fig. 10 shows the frontier molecular orbitals of the d-TiO2 complex, where it can be recognized clearly that the donor species (HOMO) is the phthalocyanine and the acceptor species (LUMO) is the TiO2 cluster. The latter molecular orbital is located at the edges of the cluster, mainly on the titanium atoms because they are fourfold Ti atoms with only four oxygen atoms around them indicating less electron density in those regions of the cluster model. Similar behavior in the HOMO and LUMO is observed for the other complexes (Fig. S12, ESI†). In summary, the results show that the adsorption of the Pc isomer on the TiO2 cluster is feasible by the carboxyl moiety being most favorable for the c-TiO2 complex (ΔEint = −0.73 eV).


Electron injection from the dye to TiO2. 
We have calculated the ΔGinject for the most stable isomer (d) and for the isomer that forms the most stable complex with the semiconductor, which corresponds to isomer c, with the aim to determine the electron injection from the isomer to the semiconductor using60–62ΔGinject = Edye* − ECB = Edye + E0–0 − ECBwhere Edye* represents the oxidation potential of the dye in its first singlet excited state and ECB is the reduction potential of the TiO2 conduction band (CB). For the latter, we consider a value of ECB = −4.3 eV which is reported in other studies.63,64Edye is the oxidation potential of the dye in its ground state and E0–0 corresponds to the singlet–singlet vertical excitation energy for the first excited state.
For both isomers (c, d), we found that Edye* has a higher energy than the conduction band of the semiconductor (Table 6), thus the processes are exergonic62 and therefore the electron injection from the first excited state of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 is thermodynamically favored. According to Grätzel,65 for an efficient conversion of solar energy to electric current to occur, ΔGinject must be at least 0.5 eV greater than ECB, so the c and d isomers promise an efficient injection of electrons in the process since ΔGinject is greater than ECB.

Conclusions
In this study, a push–pull zinc phthalocyanine dye (KH1) having 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy donor groups, was synthesized for DSSCs. The DSSC based on the dye exhibited a PCE of 3.12% which is slightly lower than that of the dye with a coadsorbent (3.21%). This may be attributed to the bulky structure of the donor groups in the dye. Co-sensitization of KH1 with an organic dye (RK1) exhibited a PCE value of 6.67%, which is higher than the RK1 dye alone (5.75%). A theoretical study was also performed using density functional theory to characterize the molecular and electronic structure of eight isomers of the KH1 compound. The isomers are energetically very similar with differences of up to 1.07 kcal mol−1 the d isomer being the most stable. The theoretical UV-Vis spectra simulated using the TD-DFT approach show that the electronic transitions for Q bands have a strong contribution from the macrocycle core. The substituents participate in the occupied MOs (HOMO−1, HOMO−2, and HOMO−3) and the carboxyl moiety shows in all isomers a slight contribution in the LUMO and an important contribution from LUMO+2 suggesting that a feasible interaction with the semiconductor could occur. The nature of the absorption bands calculated by the TPSSh functional indicates that the calculated transitions are of the π → π* type. The substituents cause a decrease in the energy GAP of the molecules and have a bathochromic effect on their Q bands. The charge density difference (CDD) plots demonstrate a significant charge separation between the carboxyl group and the rest of the molecule for all the isomers, which would favor the interaction between the dyes and the semiconductor TiO2. The binding energy computed in the gas phase between the isomer and a TiO2 anatase (101) cluster model indicates that it is energetically favorable for all the isomers suggesting that their adsorption on the semiconductor is possible. In addition, the electron injection from the dyes to the semiconductor is favorable since ΔGinject is greater than ECB. The results indicate that the zinc phthalocyanine dyes bearing bulky donor groups are a promising candidate for non-aggregated and co-sensitized solar cells.

Computational details
The optimization of molecular geometry for the ground state of isomers a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h was carried out using density functional theory (DFT) in the gas phase. We used the functional hybrid B3LYP67–69 because it was used in other works on macrocyclic systems obtaining a good agreement between the theoretical and experimental data.40,70 This functional was used with the Ahlrich def2-SVP basis set for the geometry optimization. Calculation of vibrational frequencies was carried out to confirm that the optimized structures are states of minimal energy. The UV-Vis electronic absorption spectra were calculated for all the isomers in the solution phase using the time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approach.71,72 The solvent was simulated with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM).73,74 We used tetrahydrofuran (THF) because it was the solvent used for the experimental part of this work. Singlet–singlet vertical transitions of the Franck–Condon type and 40 excited states were computed for each isomer. The hybrid functional TPSSh75,76 was used for all isomers in the TD-DFT calculations. The molecular orbitals (MOs) of each system were built to analyze the electronic transitions of the excited states. All calculations mentioned above were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.77 To calculate the charge density difference (CDD) in the isomers, the Multiwfn78 software was used.
To determine the interaction between the isomer and the semiconductor (TiO2), we optimized the isomer–TiO2 complexes, where the semiconductor is frozen, and the isomer is fully optimized. The functional Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) was used for the complexes, and all the atoms represented by the medium base, along with the PseudoDojo norm-conserving pseudopotential. The complexes were optimized at the DFT level of theory using the Quantum ATK package.58 A cluster model of TiO2 (Ti40O82H4) extracted from the anatase phase (101) crystallographic structure was used as utilized in previous studies.49,51,52
