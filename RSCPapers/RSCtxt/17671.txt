1. Introduction
Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a protracted period of time. Diabetes is either due to the inadequate production of insulin by the pancreas or due to the improper response of cells in the body to the insulin produced. The elevated levels of sugar in the blood pose serious and greater life-threatening risks to diabetic patients such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, eye problems, dental disease, nerve issues, and foot problems.1–4 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, and half of all deaths attributable to high blood glucose occur before the age of 70 years.5,6 In 2016, an estimated 1.6 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes. Another 2.2 million deaths were due to high blood glucose in 2012. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) also predicted that 425 million adults (20–79 years) were living with diabetes and this will increase to 629 million by 2045.7 Although various blood sugar monitoring systems are available in the market, they are not necessarily adopted favorably due to their high cost and inaccuracy. Due to the growing concern of this disease, there is an urge to develop an efficient and accurate device for monitoring glucose levels in the blood so as to secure reliability. Diabetes is a serious, sometimes life-threating disease. It can affect every body part of a person: for example, it may cause kidney damage, nerve damage, amputations, and blindness. It also increases the risks for heart stroke and blood vessel disease.
In the past few decades, several detection devices have been established for glucose sensing such as acoustic,8 magnetic,9 thermal,10 optical,11 and electrical transducers.12 Among these devices, electrochemically induced diabetic sensors have been considered as the most promising for monitoring glucose levels due to their superior performance, easy fabrication, and miniaturization.13–15 Electrochemical glucose sensors are mainly classified into enzymatic and non-enzymatic sensors.16,17 In the former, glucose-sensitive enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) are important components for the modification of electrode surfaces. On the other hand, non-enzymatic sensors are based on the direct electrocatalysis of electrode materials through the oxidation of glucose in the sample. Currently, the synthesis of electrochemical glucose sensors with good selectivity, sensitivity, and stability for commercial applications is still challenging. Electrochemical glucose sensors are based on potentiometric, amperometric, or conductometric sensors. These sensors for the measurement of glucose levels in clinical chemical analysis are ideally suited for hospital and non-hospital settings, due to their high sensitivity and selectivity, portable field-based size, rapid response time, and low-cost.
Electrochemical glucose sensors should have enough active sites with good selectivity, and their performances should be stable. In addition, their electrode materials should be conductive and have good mass transfer properties to transform the electrochemical reaction into current signals. Various materials have been studied as electrochemical glucose sensors, such as metal, metal oxide nanostructures, carbon-based materials, polymers, and their hybrid nanocomposites.18,19 Among them, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been taken as the most promising materials for this application. The as-developed MOF-derived materials, which have functional components, a well-defined morphology, and a favorable structure, show great promise as improved electrocatalysts in a wide range of energy-conversion reactions.153
In fact, MOFs have been widely explored in various electrochemical systems for catalytic applications in sensors due to the electrochemical nature of many metal ions contained in their structures.20–22 First, MOFs have recorded the highest specific surface areas (∼6200 m2 g−1) among the reported porous materials with large accessible pore volumes and well-defined pore size distributions, which means that they have the chance to expose the most active sites.23 Second, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline polymeric hybrid materials comprising metal ions (or clusters) and organic linkers. All the metallic ion sites exposed on the surface of this crystal structure should have the same activity to show good selectivity. MOFs have been particularly suited for glucose detection due to their low cost and superior electrochemical redox properties arising from their electroactive species (metal ions or organic ligands) combined with a large porosity. A large number of micropores, different sizes of pores, and large specific surface areas of MOFs can increase the adsorptive capacity of MOFs to hold immobilized glucose molecules. Moreover, MOF-based sensors are highly sensitive and selective to glucose due to the interaction of glucose with the linker or the metal via reversible or electrostatic bonds.
Despite the advantages mentioned above, MOFs have their limitations for glucose sensor applications due to their poor electronic conductivities, low mechanical stabilities, and inferior electro-catalytic abilities.24–26 Thus, diverse routes of modifications (e.g., incorporation of conductive phases such as carbon materials and metal nanoparticles) have been devised and employed to overcome their poor conductivity, expanding their applications as efficient electrode materials.24–28 Likewise, sacrificial templates of MOFs have been widely used for the controlled preparation of high surface area materials such as carbon nanostructures, metal oxides (MOs), metal composites (M/MO/C), and other metal-containing materials like metal carbides (MCs) and metal nitrides (MNs) via pyrolysis under operating atmospheric (N2, O2, and Ar) conditions (Fig. 1).28–32 On the other hand, to further improve their sensitivity and selectivity, researchers are also focusing on the development or modification to achieve new MOF-based systems to enhance catalytic synergism.33–36 Now, by choosing the appropriate organic and inorganic components of MOF precursors and regulating the heat treatment conditions, it is achievable to design and develop shape-, size-, porosity-, phase-, and/or conductivity-controlled nanoporous transition metal oxide materials.154 Additionally controlling the calcination temperatures and morphologies of MOF precursors is a viable method for achieving advantageous electrochemical performances.155,156

A few reviews have summarized the applications of MOFs in various fields, but few of them have systematically organized their applications of glucose sensing, and the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy have rarely been compared. In this review, we will focus on the application of MOF-based materials for glucose sensing. First, their applications as enzymatic glucose sensors have been discussed. Then, MOF-based materials have been divided into different types for non-enzymatic glucose sensors, which is the main research interest in this area. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in this area have been discussed. Despite the use of MOFs as raw materials for glucose sensing, their remarkable properties have been found to have resulted in deep investigations into combining their properties with those of a variety of functional materials.  The micropore/mesopore ratio can be easily adjusted by manipulating the various metal ions in the MOFs, resulting in the dimensions of MOFs ranging from 1-D to 2-D and 3-D since their original forms can be maintained even after carbonization.157,158 By carefully selecting metal nodes and organic linkers, fabricating new MOF crystal structures, and matching MOF pore architectures to nanoparticles encapsulated, high performance electrochemical sensors can be introduced.159 To retain the large surface area of the MOF, it is critical to prevent metal NPs from blocking the pores of the MOF during encapsulation.160 Their preparation along with these materials has remarkably improved the catalytic performance of MOFs for glucose detection.
2. MOF-based materials as enzymatic glucose sensors
2.1. History of enzyme-based sensors
The concept of glucose sensing was proposed by Clark and Lyons in 1962.37 Since then, enormous efforts have been made by the scientific community to improve the performance of such devices in the past 56 years.37–39 As such, enzyme-based glucose sensors have been commercialized to a large extent in clinical diagnosis and personal health management by complying with the basic requirements (e.g., biocompatibility, calibration, specificity, and good linearity). The employment of enzyme-based sensors brings some negative effects as well as positive roles. However, one of the major challenges for enzyme-based sensors is the long-term stability of the enzyme as the crucial component, whether the sensor can be reused and possibly be incorporated into a cyclic operation of the system. The most commonly used enzymes for the fabrication of glucose sensors are glucose oxidase (GOx) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). Although GOx is a highly selective enzyme for glucose sensors, it is very sensitive to external conditions such as the pH value, temperature, and the chemical environment. It loses its activity at low and high pH values (<2 or >8) and at temperatures over 40 °C.2,40–42 GOx-based sensors are also seriously influenced by exposure to humidity. The relatively low activity of GOx leads to its dependence on the oxygen concentration of its surroundings. In order to overcome these disadvantages, many studies have been conducted on the GOx enzyme with lower activity towards oxygen.43
2.2. Glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme-based glucose sensors
Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is a subclass of zeolitic MOFs and it is a well-known microstructure due to its unique cavity and tunable pore size to accommodate biomolecules and to protect them from major external stimuli.44,45 A GOx encapsulating MOF can act as a tandem enzyme, which means that the enzyme governs two concurrent reactions, for glucose oxidation and H2O2 reduction.46 An innovative protocol was proposed for the successful encapsulation of TiO2 and GOx inside the cavity of ZIF-8 to fabricate a GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) composite. The as-synthesized composite is applicable for mediator-free glucose detection in an aqueous medium.47 The large surface area and tunable cavity size of the MOF are more favorable to encapsulate both TiO2 and GOx. Moreover, the high surface area and charge storage capacitance of TiO2 nanoparticles can offer excellent electrocatalytic activity toward both glucose oxidation and hydrogen peroxide reduction. This composite detects a low-level concentration (80 nM) of glucose by utilizing a very low concentration of the enzyme (62 μg in 1 mL). Li et al. successfully encapsulated the enzyme into the metal–organic framework (ZIF-8) platform during in situ growth of ZIF-8 on electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) nanofiber membranes. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Au nanoparticles were adsorbed onto CA/ZIF-8@enzyme membranes and were utilized as highly flexible electrodes for self-powered biosensors to monitor glucose.48 The as-proposed glucose biosensor demonstrated excellent stability in continuous long-term monitoring for up to 15 h.
Exfoliation of mesoporous MIL-100(Fe) and microporous MIL-127(Fe) as new and efficient matrices for immobilization of enzymes was investigated for constructing biosensors. Patra et al. reported bioelectrodes based on iron(III) trimesate MIL-100(Fe) and GOx supported on platinum nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) with excellent electrocatalytic activity for amperometric glucose biosensor detection.49 Mesoporous MIL-100(M) (M = Fe, Cr, and Al) and microporous iron(III) azobenzenetetracarboxylate MIL-127(Fe) were tested as hosts for immobilization of the GOx enzyme for the building-up of glucose biosensors. Among MIL-100(M) (M = Fe, Cr, and Al) and MIL-127(Fe) based biosensors, the MIL-100(Fe) based biosensor is superior in terms of sensitivity, linear concentration range, and limit of detection. The superior electrochemical performance of the MIL-100(Fe) based biosensor was explained as due to the catalytic properties of Fe3+ centers and the GOx enzyme. In particular, Fe3+ cations of MIL-100(Fe) exhibited intrinsic peroxidase-like activity.
A new type of glucose biosensor was fabricated based on bimetallic Ni/Cu-MOFs with field-effect transistors (FETs) as the channel layers. The Ni/Cu-MOF films were grown in situ on a pre-prepared FET device, and modified with the glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme by using glutaraldehyde (GA) as a linker.50 The fabricated sensor (GOD-GA-Ni/Cu-MOF-FET) showed good field effect performance and excellent responses to glucose sensing with high sensitivity (26.05 μA cm−2 mM−1) in a low concentration range (0.001–20 mM) and a low detection limit (0.51 μM) due to the synergistic effect of Ni and Cu ions in the MOFs.

Summary. The majority of enzyme-based glucose commercial sensors use first- and second-generation GOx-based methods, and the need for an O2 supply has been met using semipermeable membranes, which are simple and cheap to produce. Advanced sensor systems capable of oxygen-free, selective, and energy-efficient glucose detection are, nevertheless, in great demand.

2.2.1. Multi-enzyme-based glucose sensors. 
Recently, multi-enzyme systems involving consecutive series of enzymatic reactions have attracted great attention due to their potential for important biological applications.51 MOFs were reported to exhibit mimetic enzyme peroxidase-like activity. Through the co-operation of MOFs as mimetic and natural enzymes, new kinds of biomimetic multi-enzymes are established. Mimetic multi-enzyme systems were developed by embedding GOx in ZIF-8 and used as biosensors for electrochemical glucose detection.52 To further improve the performance of multi-enzyme-based glucose biosensors, an exfoliated metal–organic coordination polymer (MOCP)–enzyme biocomposite (MEBC) was proposed for amperometric biosensing of glucose and environmentally toxic phenols through the immobilization of GOx and tyrosinase enzymes, respectively.53 The MOCPs can immobilize the enzymes with high load/activity and mass-transfer efficiency. This glucose biosensor exhibited wide linearity in the range of 0.025–1092 μM with a detection limit of 15 nM and much higher sensitivity (80 μA mM−1 cm−2) as compared to sensors prepared by conventional polymerization methods. Using MOF-based materials to understand the direct electron transfer from horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to electrode materials is another strategy to construct electrochemical glucose sensors. Wu et al. studied the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) within zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8).54 The GOx&HRP/ZIF-8 composite was prepared by the coprecipitation method in an aqueous solution. This MOF-composite was used for highly sensitive and stable detection of glucose. The same research group used polydopamine (PDA) to prepare a highly stable and reusable micrometer-sized novel PDA tethered GOx/ZIF-8 composite through covalent and non-covalent interactions. The composite exhibited only half of the catalytic activity as compared with the GOx&HRP/ZIF-8 composite, but the enzyme in the system could retain its activity for a longer time.55 A novel amperometric GOx/PDA/ZIF-8@rGO immobilized glassy carbon electrode (GCE) biosensor was constructed for glucose detection based on the mimetic multi-enzyme system by combining the microcapsule and GOx (Fig. 2a).56 The PDA/ZIF-8@rGO/GCE microcapsule was constructed of PDA, CaCO3 templated ZIF-8, and graphene nanosheets. This construction could not only provide a non-toxic environment due to the organic solvents used but also immobilize the GOx enzyme into the structure. The folded graphene nanosheets (rGO) were bound to the PDA/ZIF-8 microcapsule through π–π interaction and to ZIF-8 through hydrogen bonding, as depicted in Fig. 2b and c respectively. The resulting electrochemical biosensor exhibited extraordinary electrochemical detection performance of glucose, opening a new route for extending the electrochemical enzyme-based biosensor to mimetic multi-enzyme systems.

Summary. The immobilization of an enzyme layer on an electrode enhances the quality of the electrode in glucose measurement, since a stably mounted enzyme on the electrode leads to dependable performance of the electrode in long-term operation. In addition, the electrocatalytic mediator layer plays a significant role in determining selectivity and sensitivity.


2.2.2. Ratiometric glucose sensors. 
Ratiometric analytical methods have been developed to overcome the poor selectivity, stability, and repeatability of biosensors. Ratiometric electrochemical sensors are constructed based on two electroactive materials. One electroactive material produces an internal reference signal as a built-in correction for the background current difference among the modified electrodes. The other electroactive material plays a crucial role in monitoring analytes in electrochemical applications.57–59 Thus, this method can greatly improve the stability and reproducibility of biosensors. The GOx enzyme was immobilized onto a Au nanoparticle deposited Cu-BTC MOF/3D-KSC electrode to construct a ratiometric electrochemical glucose biosensor (Fig. 3a and b).60 The octahedral nanostructured Cu-based metal–organic frameworks (Cu-BTC MOFs) were first grown on the smooth channel walls of the three-dimensional macroporous carbon (3D-KSCs) with a diameter of 10 μm (Fig. 3b(A, E and B, F)), then 10–20 nm sized Au nanoparticles were electrodeposited on the Cu-BTC MOF/3D-KSC electrode under −0.2 V for 120 s as shown in Fig. 3b(C and G). The Au nanoparticles not only immobilized the GOx enzyme but also catalyzed the O2 reduction reaction and improved the electrical conductivity of the Cu-MOFs. There was no difference in AuNPs/Cu-BTC MOFs/3D KSCs after immobilization of the glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme on the AuNP/Cu-BTC MOF/3D KSC electrode (Fig. 3b(D and H)). The Cu-BTC MOFs catalyze glucose oxidation as a reference signal. The reduction peak current density of the Cu-BTC MOFs increased, while the current density of the O2 reduction peak decreased due to the consumption of O2 in glucose oxidation which was catalyzed by the GOD enzyme.

(b) SEM images of 3D-KSCs (A, E), Cu-BTC MOFs/3D-KSCs (B, F), AuNPs/Cu-BTC MOFs/3D-KSCs (C, G) and GOD/AuNPs/Cu-BTC MOFs/3D-KSCs (D, H). Reproduced from ref. 60 with permission.

Summary. The capacity of the ratiometric electrochemical sensor to reduce or overcome environmental differences, artificial variables, electrode modification layers, and other factors, thereby significantly improving the reliability, stability, and repeatability of test findings, has piqued attention. The suggested sensor can perform well, and the glucose sensor's repeatability and stability are excellent.


2.2.3. Hemin-based glucose sensors. 
Hemin as a natural metalloporphyrin can not only act as a redox mediator based on the electrochemical performance of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) reversible redox but can also act as an enzyme based on its peroxidase-like activity. The good catalytic activity of hemin makes it a preferable option to insert into host MOFs.61 Multifunctional MOFs were used to encapsulate hemin into amino-containing Fe-MIL-88 MOFs (hemin@MOFs), which were further supported using Au nanoparticles (Au/hemin@MOFs). This system was then explored for its application for thrombin (TB) detection through the fabrication of an electrochemical aptasensor.62 The composite was conjugated with glucose oxidase (GOx) and an aptamer, which was used as a secondary aptamer bioconjugate for detection of glucose. The Au/hemin@MOF composite could act as a redox mediator directly for electrochemical signal generation and further amplification by the generation of H2O2 from glucose oxidation. Thus, the aptasensor showed good sensitivity due to the plenty of hemin encapsulated in the MOFs as signal probes. The higher electrocatalytic activity of the Au/hemin@MOF composite was due to the excellent conductivity of the AuNPs. Similarly, He et al. synthesized a 3D ball-flower-like hollow cage structure Cu-hemin metal–organic framework (Cu-hemin MOF) to load the GOx enzyme for electrochemical glucose biosensing.63 The enzyme molecules were incorporated into Cu-hemin MOFs by utilizing the pores of the MOFs, which helped avoid the aggregation of the enzyme molecules on the electrode surface. This composite exhibited good performances toward both oxygen reduction via the Cu-hemin MOFs and glucose oxidation via the GOx enzyme. As such, it can help avoid the difficulties of traditional nanomaterials and other MOFs as supporters to load the GOx enzyme.64

Summary. Despite the fact that hemin/MOF composites can be one of the most promising candidates for glucose sensors, their poor electrical conductivity remains a constraint that must be considered. One strategy for improving the electrical conductivity of the sensors is to fabricate target composites via pyrolysis.


2.2.4. Porphyrin-based glucose sensors. 
Porphyrins are considered to be the most important mimics of many enzymes with enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards biological molecules.65,66 However, the applications of porphyrins in electrochemical biosensors have been limited mainly owing to their poor conductivity. The immobilization of porphyrins onto carbon materials provides a promising approach to enhance their electrocatalytic activity due to their good conductivity.67 In this aspect, Ling and coworkers prepared porous carbon by direct carbonization of an N-rich zeolite-type metal–organic framework (ZIF-8) as both a precursor and a template. This porous carbon was conjugated with porphyrin (iron(III) meso-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin chloride (FeTCPP)) through π–π noncovalent interactions to form a porphyrin–porous carbon nanocomposite (PorPC). The ZIF-8 nanoparticles exhibit the well-known hexagonal crystal structure of 100 nm diameter, approximately (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows the SEM image of the carbon material with an intersecting three-dimensional structure and it is similar to the morphology of PorPC (Fig. 4C), indicating that the porous carbon retained its pristine structure after conjugation with FeTCPP. When GOD was immobilized onto the surface of PorPC, it tended to aggregate into an island-like structure (Fig. 4D). This nanocomposite was utilized for the construction of a glucose biosensor on the basis of O2 consumption by coupling with the GOx enzyme.68

Summary. Recently, several porphyrin-based MOFs have been created and used as enzyme mimics for glucose sensing. However, colorimetric tests are notorious for their low sensitivity, which limits their use at low concentrations. However, the current sensing system has been successfully used to determine glucose in actual blood samples with good recovery.

2.3. Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme-based glucose sensors
Like GOx, the glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme has also been used for glucose sensing. This enzyme has few drawbacks like conjunction with cofactors, low selectivity, poor thermal stability, and high overpotential which may be attributed to minimizing the electron-transfer kinetics.69 Despite these drawbacks, GDH is widely used in commercial applications like test strips because it is independent of the dissolved oxygen.
The unique properties of ZIFs potentially resulted in a new paradigm for surface immobilization of biorecognition units and electrocatalysts for the development of biosensors. Here, ZIFs were used as host matrices for co-immobilization of electrocatalysts methylene green (MG) and the GDH enzyme for the development of glucose biosensors.70 In this work, Ma et al. synthesized five typical ZIFs such as ZIF-8, ZIF-9, ZIF-67, ZIF-68, and ZIF-70 with various structural properties. Among all the ZIF materials, ZIF-70 had the highest surface absorption capacity, which resulted from the combination of hydrophobic interactions, donor–acceptor bonding, and hydrogen bonding. A biosensor was finally constructed by drop-casting an MG/ZIF-70 composite onto a glassy carbon electrode, followed by GDH coating onto the MG/ZIF-70 composite. The sensor was highly sensitive to glucose within a linear detection range of 0.1–2 mM.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) form a three-dimensional network on electrode surfaces with high surface area to enhance the electron transfer and mechanical stability of the modified electrode. A novel Tb@mesoMOF–CNT composite for glucose biosensors was proposed by growing Tb@mesoMOFs on the CNTs’ surfaces, which served as supporting matrices for the co-immobilization of the MG and GDH onto the glassy carbon electrode surface.71 The detailed synthetic procedure for the Tb@mesoMOF-CNT composite and the modification process of the final electrode are shown in Fig. 5a. The composite-based biosensor showed excellent electrochemical performance for glucose detection with the help of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). The electrocatalytic activity of GDH/MG-Tb@mesoMOF-CNT/GCE towards the glucose oxidation is shown in Fig. 5b. The anodic peak current increased and the cathodic peak current decreased gradually upon increasing the concentration of glucose, showing an electrocatalytic reduction reaction. The mechanism involved in this reaction was that glucose was oxidized into gluconolactone by NAD+ and was accompanied by the reduction of NAD+ to NADH with the help of the GDH enzyme. The anodic peak current of glucose oxidation exhibited a linear tendency toward the glucose concentration. The detection limit (8 μM) of this method was much lower than those of other reported glucose biosensors.

Summary. GDH glucose sensors permit selective and sensitive glucose detection without incubation, with a broad range of values in artificial serum during a short measurement period. For self-monitoring blood glucose sensors, this type of sensor is very promising.
2.4. Drawbacks of enzymatic glucose sensors
Although the enzymes are selective and sensitive to glucose, they are very costly, sensitive and vulnerable to collapse when the temperature or pH parameters are not optimal. Enzymatic glucose sensors are hampered also by limited pH ranges, extreme temperatures, and variable humidity levels. These inconveniences have led researchers to study and develop glucose sensors without the need for an enzyme (Table 1).

3. MOFs and their composites/modified materials as non-enzymatic glucose sensors
Although enzyme-based electrochemical glucose sensors have good enough detection limits, the stability of the enzymes is still a big problem for their real applications. Recently, researchers focused their interest on developing non-enzymatic sensors for glucose detection. These non-enzymatic sensors are based on the direct electrocatalysis of electrode materials towards glucose.72–74 With superior performances (like good sensitivity, high stability, and easy fabrication), extensive efforts have been made by the research community to explore high-performance non-enzymatic glucose sensors for monitoring glucose levels. Tables 2–4 summarize MOF-based non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors for the sensing of glucose levels in an alkaline medium. The detectable concentration ranges of the glucose level and their detection limits along with the sensitivities of various non-enzymatic based sensors are also given in Tables 2–4.

3.1. Pristine MOF-based non-enzymatic sensors
Due to their well-known exceptional properties, MOFs have been widely applied in glucose sensors (Table 2).75,76 For example, a novel Cu-based MOF was exploited for a non-enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensor.77 The results showed that the Cu-MOF sensor exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards glucose in the range of 0.06 μM to 5 mM with a sensitivity of 89 μA mM−1 cm−2 and a detection limit of 10.5 nM. Moreover, this sensor is considered to be highly selective for glucose with almost no responses to other coexisting interferences, such as fructose, sucrose, ascorbic acid, uric acid, and dopamine. Furthermore, a carbon paste electrode (CPE) was employed to modify Cu-MOF due to its renewability, good reproducibility, and high stability.78 A highly porous Cu3(BTB)2 (H2O)3 (DMF)9 (H2O)2 (Cu-MOF) (BTB = benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tribenzoic acid) with a large pore size was demonstrated as a non-enzymatic sensor for the electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide and glucose.79 The high electrocatalytic activity of the Cu-MOF modified electrode was due to the electron transfer processes of the Cu(II)-MOF/Cu(I)-MOF redox couple. This Cu-MOF modified CPE presented a well-behaved redox event due to electroactive metal centers in the MOF in pH 7.2 phosphate buffer solution which can be utilized to catalyze the electroreduction of H2O2 (−0.2 V). This modified electrode also exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose (0.7 V) in alkaline solution. This sensor system exhibited good anti-interference properties for glucose as well as H2O2 detection.
For the first time, different nanocrystal planes of [Cu3(btc)2] were described as nonenzymatic electrocatalysts for glucose detection.80 The sample S1 with a cubic shaped morphology was obtained without the addition of CTAB (Fig. 6A(a and b)). When increasing the concentration of CTAB to 0.005 M, the sample S2 morphology was in a truncated cubic shape (Fig. 6A(c and d)). The sample S3 morphology changed from cuboctahedrons to octahedral nanoparticles (S4) upon further increasing the concentration of CTAB from 0.01 to 0.1 M (Fig. 6A(e–h)). The [Cu3(btc)2] nanocube (S1) with 6 {100} crystal plane modified electrode showed better electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation than the other three prepared nanocrystals. Interestingly, by changing the morphology of the [Cu3(btc)2] nanocrystals from nanocubes to octahedra, the electrocatalytic activity of the non-enzymatic glucose sensor also decreased due to the difficulty in guest-glucose diffusion, as shown in Fig. 6B. There was a remarkable increase in the peak current of the S1-GCE after the addition of glucose compared to that before its addition. Hence, the current–time response of the S1-GCE displayed an observable increase in the current response of glucose sensing after successive injections of glucose compared with the S2-GCE, S3-GCE, and S4-GCE (Fig. 6B(a and b)). As shown in Fig. 6B(c), the sensitivity (549 μA mM−1 cm−2) of the S1-GCE was better than those of the S2-GCE (77 μA mM−1 cm−2), S3-GCE (<1 μA mM−1 cm−2), and S4-GCE (<1 μA mM−1 cm−2) and also some other reported materials such as Cu nanobelt (0.0798 μA mM−1 cm−2),81 Cu nanoporous (220 μA mM−1 cm−2)82 and N-doped carbon–Cu nanohybrid (223.6 μA mM−1 cm−2)83 electrode materials. Moreover, a remarkable glucose signal was observed for the S1-GCE with other interfering species such as ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), dopamine (DA), and KCl (Fig. 6B(d)). These excellent results indicated that [Cu3(btc)2] nanocubes have high catalytically active sites for glucose oxidation provided by the well-distribution of nanocube structures and nanopores on the MOFs. Moreover, a MOF coating was fabricated on a gold electrode surface through the conversion of Cu(OH)2 nanobelts to Cu3(BTC)2 MOFs.84 This MOF coating was prepared at a 1:1 EtOH:H2O volume ratio of the MOF precursor solution. The MOF coating showed the best sensing properties due to the formation of a homogenous and defect-free MOF coating on the electrode surface. The Cu3(BTC)2 MOF sensor exhibited higher sensitivity (273 μA mM−1 cm−2) for electrochemical detection of glucose compared to nanostructured metallic copper.82 This approach for the fabrication of MOF coatings with unique properties is expected to be compatible with MOF-based electrochemical applications.

Recently, Ni-based nanomaterials have been used for non-enzymatic glucose detection due to their low cost and good electrocatalytic performance arising from the redox behavior of the Ni2+/Ni3+ couple in an alkaline electrolytic solution.7,85,86,161,165 Nickel-based metal–organic framework (Ni-MIL-77) ultrathin nanobelts were also synthesized by a one-pot solution process under solvothermal conditions.87 A Ni-MIL-77 modified electrode offers superior electroanalytical performance as a non-enzymatic glucose sensor due to the catalytic effect of the Ni3+ ion in Ni-MIL-77 for the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone. Moreover, Ni-MOF nanobelts were successfully applied for glucose detection in serum samples with good selectivity and sensitivity (1.542 μA mM−1 cm−2), stability, and a low detection limit (0.25 μM). In another study, a Ni-based metal–organic framework nanosheet array on Ni foam (Ni-MOF/NF) was developed for the electrochemical detection of glucose in a basic solution.88 Ni-MOFs are synthesized by the hydrothermal treatment of Ni2+ and terephthalic acid in N,N-dimethylformamide. The LOD (85 nM) of the Ni-MOF/NF was much lower compared to some reported Ni-based electrochemical glucose probe sensors.89–91 The reason was the mutual adsorption between the terephthalic acid existing in MOFs and glucose, which increased the glucose concentration on the electrode surface. Moreover, Ni-MOF also exhibits structural stability, high surface area, more exposed active sites, and reduced catalyst use without sacrificing catalytic activity. Xuan et al. synthesized laminar-structured Ni-MOFs and longitudinally-expanded to Ni-MOF layers to increase nickel active sites, which not only contribute to enhancing the current response of glucose detection but also show the oxidation peak evolution of Ni ions with different sonication treatment times.92 The 60 min sonication treated Ni-MOF exhibits enhanced Ni(III)/Ni(II) redox couple properties and specifically more Ni(IV)/Ni(III) double nickel cation catalysis channels compared to the 0 min Ni-MOF. Therefore, the 60 min Ni-MOF shows an expansion in the linear range of glucose current response, a high sensitivity, and a low detection limit in the CV test as well as the chronoamperometry tests. More importantly, an all-solid-state, safe non-enzymatic sweat glucose biosensor was assembled by using a solid-state PVA/NaOH electrolyte and a disposable 60 min Ni-MOF working electrode. Gumilar et al. recently reported a glucose sensor based on a hierarchical 3D sheet-like structured Ni-BDC (BDC = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid) MOF.93 The 3D morphology of the Ni MOF was formed by combining 2D nanosheets in the presence of shape-directing agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone and acetonitrile. The Ni-BDC MOF modified electrode shows superior electrocatalytic activity towards glucose sensing with a high sensitivity of 635.9 μA mM−1 cm−2 in the range of 0.01 to 0.8 mM, compared to other M-BDC MOF nanosheets (M = Cu, Mn, Zr).
Zhou et al. successfully synthesized a new redox-active 3D [Mn2{Ni(C2S2(C6H4COO)2)2} (H2O)2]·2DMF (DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide) on Cu foam by a hydrothermal method, which exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance.94 As the inorganic analog of the organic tetrathiafulvalene-tetrabenzoic acid (H4TTFTB),95,96 nickel bis(dithiolene-dibenzoic acid), [Ni(C2S2(C6H4COO)2)2], acts as a redox-active, versatile connecter for the synthesis of new functional metal–organic frameworks. [Mn2{Ni(C2S2(C6H4COO)2)2} (H2O)2]·2DMF is isomorphic to the reported [Mn2(TTFTB) (H2O)2] but it behaves as a highly sensitive sensor for glucose detection with a wide linear range (2 μM–2 mM) and a low detection limit (0.1 μM), due to the redox-active states of the [NiS4] core. This process may offer a new opportunity to design and develop non-noble-metal-based redox-active metal–organic frameworks for electrocatalytic applications.

Summary. Although pristine MOFs have notable catalytic capabilities, they have synergistic effects when incorporating metal nanoparticles into MOF structures. Unfortunately, pristine MOFs have no potential to provide additional glucose oxidation catalytic sites.
3.2. MOF composite-based non-enzymatic sensors
Various materials are used to modify electrode surfaces for designing new electrochemical biosensors with desirable properties. The electrode surfaces of these modified materials facilitate electron transfer to ultimately have a positive effect in the construction of electrochemical biosensors. Electrochemical biosensors based on MOF composites may exhibit good performance due to the electroactivity and stability of the materials. Thus, researchers are interested in synthesizing MOF composites that are more favorable than other composite materials. Composites with carbon materials and metal/metal oxide nanoparticles had better aspects to enhance the performance of electrochemical glucose biosensors. The analytical parameters of the various composites of MOFs with carbon materials and metals as glucose sensor electrodes are given in Table 3.

3.2.1. MOF/carbon material-based non-enzymatic sensors. 
Although there are reports on using MOFs for sensing applications,97 the poor conductivity and low stability properties of most MOFs limited their performances. To overcome this problem, MOFs have been combined with certain carbon nanomaterials like graphene derivatives, CNTs, and carbon black to improve their physico-chemical properties. They are capable of enhancing the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activities of the MOF composites.98,162
CNTs have been extensively used as efficient electrode materials due to their large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and good mechanical stability.99 Ni-MOF/CNT composites were reported as effective electrode materials for amperometric detection of glucose with low detection limits, and high selectivity and sensitivity.100 The obtained Ni-MOF nanostructures displayed porous structures in which close contact between the glucose and active centers was stimulated through pores and channels. A porphyrin (Co-TCPP) adsorbed Co-MOF with MWCNTs was used for the electrochemical sensing of glucose.101 The composite exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity than their individual counterparts due to the combination of the excellent conductivity of MWCNTs, the biomimetic catalytic feature of Co-TCPP, and the high-density active sites of the Co-MOF. The linear range and LOD of the modified electrode for glucose sensing were 1–400 and 0.28 ppb, respectively.
Graphene derivatives have excellent electrical conductivity along with various other advantages like CNTs. In graphene-based composite materials, the transfer of electrons takes place at the edge plane surface rather than basal planes. A Ni(II)-based metal–organic coordination polymer nanoparticle (NiCPNP)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite was reported for electrochemical nonenzymatic glucose sensing.102 The composite was formed by hydrothermal treatment of a mixture of tannic acid-functionalized graphene oxide and NiCl2 aqueous solution in dimethylformamide. This suggests that GO plays an important mediating role in the growth of NiCPNPs. This nanocomposite modified electrode exhibited high catalytic activity for glucose electrooxidation while avoiding interference from common species. The application of this glucose sensor was successfully demonstrated in human blood serum samples. A high-performance flexible MOF electrode was successfully fabricated by structurally integrating 2D oriented assemblies of electrocatalytic Cu3(btc)2 nanocubes with freestanding amino-functionalized graphene paper, denoted NH2-GP-Cu3(btc)2.103 The modularity of this approach stems from the fact that not only can smaller Cu3(btc)2 nanocubes be prepared through interfacial synthesis from an oil–water interphase, but the obtained monolayer of Cu3(btc)2 nanocubes can also be well-packed with a uniform size on the paper electrode in a short time. More importantly, the post-assembly of amino-functionalized graphene paper restores its ordered structure and electron-transport properties. This modified graphene paper also improves the electrical conductivity of Cu3(btc)2 and gives rise to oriented Cu3(btc)2 nanocubes with excellent electrocatalytic activities, which have been apparent by the sensitive and selective detection of lactate and glucose. The NH2-GP-Cu3(btc)2 modified electrode exhibits long-term stability, reproducibility, flexibility, easy-recycling, and excellent electrochemical activity towards real sweat lactate and glucose of human beings, which offers possibilities for real-time detection of sweat even though it is flexible and incorporated into compact electrochemical systems, which is of great importance for its utilization in miniaturized and compact devices. Flexibility is one of the critical significances for the use of the modified paper electrode in the fabrication of advanced non-implantable biosensors for analysis of real-life samples by in vitro and in vivo studies. Fig. 7 shows the overall sensing performance of the flexible NH2-GP-Cu3(btc)2 modified electrode, effected by the bending-induced mechanical stress. When tested for different bending angles (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180°) for different bending times (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200), the flexible NH2-GP-Cu3(btc)2 electrode exhibits minimal change in the amperometric response to 300 nM glucose and 0.8 mM lactate, but the changes in amperometric responses are less than 10% after bending 200 times (Fig. 7(A–C)). Taking these effects into consideration, the results show that immense and repetitive bending has a negligible impact on the amperometric responses to glucose and lactate. The favorable responses are due to the high stiffness and toughness of the NH2-GP-Cu3(btc)2 electrode and magnificent adhesion between the Cu3(btc)2 nanocubes and the NH2-GP substrate. Amperometric responses are measured at an applied potential of −0.1 V for lactate and +0.65 V for glucose (Fig. 7D). Dynamic measurements give fast, dynamic, and instantaneous responses on the addition of sweat into the electrolyte solution, whereas static measurements are performed in the case where sweat is already in the electrolyte solution rather than its addition to the electrolyte. Static responses are relatively lower than dynamic responses toward sweat lactate and glucose but this tiny difference can be acceptable. This result indicates that the real performance measured by dynamic tests will achieve 95% when the modified paper electrode is applied to work in a real-time manner.

Acetylene black (Acb) is a special type of conductive carbon black and it has become an important conductive additive due to its high electrical conductivity and low cost. The electrocatalytic activity of a Co-MOF modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was further improved by the addition of Acb, which facilitated charge transfer while improving the contact between Co-MOF and the GCE. A new Co-MOF/Acb composite was constructed via hydrothermal reaction by combining the advantages of both Co-MOF and acetylene black (Acb).104 This fabricated composite electrode, when added with 2% Acb, exhibited superior sensing performance for glucose oxidation with high sensitivity (0.255 μA μM−1 cm−2), a low detection limit (1.7 μM), and high selectivity and stability. Wei et al. developed a simple, portable, and user-friendly electrochemical analytical chip based on a Co-MOF/CC/Paper hybrid button-sensor for nonenzymatic quantification of glucose.105 The flexible Co-MOF/CC not only provides high surface area and more catalytically active sites than a traditional plane electrode but can also be assembled with patterned paper to form an electrochemical coin-chip based sensor. Using the button-sensor, rapid quantitative detection of glucose was achieved with high selectivity and stability in complex bio-matrixes including serum, urine, and saliva. An electrochemical non-enzymatic glucose sensor was fabricated by direct growth of a conductive Ni/Co bimetal MOF on flexible carbon cloth (Ni/Co(HHTP)MOF/CC) via a one-step hydrothermal method.106 Due to the excellent conductivity of the MOF and CC and the synergic effect of the Ni and Co elements, the developed sensor electrode not only provides a large surface area and more catalytically active sites but also boosts the electrochemical performance. The Ni/Co(HHTP)MOF/CC shows excellent electrocatalytic activity towards glucose sensing in an alkaline medium with a linear range of 0.3 μM–2.312 mM, a low detection limit of 100 nM, and a high sensitivity of 3250 μA mM−1 cm−2 and also shows comparable sensing performance in human serum, tea and orange juice with recoveries in the range of 100.31% to 107.00%.


3.2.2. MOF/metal/metal oxide-based non-enzymatic sensors. 
Besides adding carbon nanomaterials to improve the conductivity of MOFs, loading electrochemically active metal nanoparticles within their channels to form MOF/metal/metal oxide composites is another strategy to improve the performance of MOFs.107 In these composites, metal nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the interior of the MOFs. For example, Zhao et al. encapsulated NiIr nanoparticles into the cavities of MIL-101 and applied them to dehydrogenation of hydrazine monohydrate in alkaline solution.108 Two types of metal-ZSM-5 electrodes – transition-metal ion exchange form (M-ZSM-5; M = Cu and Ni) and nanocrystalline form (M-Nano-ZSM-5; M = Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, and Mn) – were employed for electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose and methanol.109 The electrocatalytic activity of the latter was significantly higher than that of the former. A non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor based on a Cu2+-exchanged electrode exhibits the highest current sensitivity (59.85 μA mM-1) for glucose oxidation, whereas the corresponding Ni2+-exchanged electrode exhibits a high current sensitivity (4573 μA M−1) and sensing ability in methanol oxidation. To date, many metals and metal oxides have been used to prepare MOF-based composites for electrochemical sensors.
Among various metal nanoparticles, Ag nanoparticles are identified to exhibit excellent electrical conductivity and biocompatibility for the sensing of biomolecules in electrochemistry.110,111 For example, a novel non-enzymatic glucose sensor was fabricated based on a Ag@ZIF-67 composite.112 Ag nanoparticles were encapsulated into a Co-based porous MOF (ZIF-67) through a sequential deposition–reduction method to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the modified electrode towards glucose oxidation. The electrocatalytic performance of the modified electrode was investigated with Ag loading. The sensitivity was increased by two and a half times by increasing the Ag content from 0% to 0.5%. The 0.5% Ag@ZIF-67 modified electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic activity, good selectivity, and stability. Peng et al. prepared a flower-like Ag nanoparticle decorated Ni-based metal–organic framework for electrochemical determination of glucose.113 The electrochemical glucose sensor based on AgNPs/Ni-MOF shows high sensitivity (1.29 mA mM−1 cm−2), with a low detection limit (4.7 μM) in the linear range of 0.01–4 mM.
Metal–organic frameworks (ZIF-8) were used as host matrices to encapsulate Cu nanoparticles (2.5–5 nm) for non-enzymatic glucose sensing under alkaline conditions.114 The hybrid made by incorporating Cu nanoparticles into ZIF-8 (Cu-in-ZIF-8) was further applied as an electrochemical interface for modifying a screen-printed electrode. The porous structure of ZIF-8 was beneficial for the fast diffusion of glucose to offer space for uniform dispersion of Cu NPs. Compared with Cu NP loaded ZIF-8 (Cu-on-ZIF-8), the ZIF-8 in Cu-in-ZIF-8 protects the Cu NPs from (i) dissolution, (ii) particle migration, and (iii) agglomeration during the electrocatalytic process. The proposed Cu-in-ZIF-8 composite exhibited higher catalytic activity and better cycling stability than Cu-on-ZIF-8 towards glucose sensing in alkaline media. As shown in Fig. 8, the catalytic activity of Cu-on-ZIF-8 almost decreased to zero after 25 times of cycling. In contrast, only 9.3% of the activity was lost for Cu-in-ZIF-8 even after 35 times of cycling towards glucose oxidation. This impressive stability of Cu-in-ZIF-8 was mainly due to the steric hindrance of Cu NPs, while the unstable activity of Cu-on-ZIF-8 was due to the easy agglomeration of Cu NPs during the process. The Cu-in-ZIF-8 sensor showed better repeatability and reproducibility for evaluating glucose levels in rat serum samples. The glucose concentration in a rat serum sample obtained using the Cu-in-ZIF-8 based sensor (24.6 mM) showed a good agreement with that obtained using a commercial glucometer (23.4 mM), which demonstrates its reliability for real sample detection. Bimetallic transition particles have acted as efficient electrode materials for the fabrication of non-enzymatic glucose sensors with high sensitivity and selectivity due to their multiple functionalities, stability and high catalytic activity compared to monometallic particles.2 Kim et al. reported a bimetallic Cu@Ni metal–organic framework with a solid microsphere-like structure for electrochemical glucose oxidation.115 The prepared bi-metallic MOF structure provides active glucose-sensing sites and excellent pathways for the transfer of electrons compared to the individual materials. The developed sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 496.0 μA mM−1 cm−2 and a limit of detection of 0.4 μM, and excellent selectivity in the range from 0 to 5.0 mM.

CuO nanoparticles are one of the most promising materials for the fabrication of electrochemical sensors due to their remarkable stability, low cost, good electrocatalytic activity, high surface area, and excellent anti-interference properties.116–118 Zhang et al. constructed a CuO nanoparticle decorated straw-sheaf-shaped Ce–metal–organic framework (Ce-MOF) composite by in situ attachment of CuO nanoparticles onto Ce-MOF.119 The fabricated CuONP/Ce-MOF composite-based glucose sensor showed a wide linear range of 5 nM–8.6 mM, an ultrasensitivity of 2058.5 μA mM−1cm−2, and a low detection limit of 2.0 nM. The designed sensor was also successfully used in the detection of glucose in human serum samples because of its wonderful repeatability, reproducibility, stability, and selectivity.

Summary. Integration of metal nanoparticles into a MOF structure enhances the catalytic activity as well as the functional sites. The glucose oxidation and the improved catalytic characteristics of metals and NPs, as well as of metal oxides and sulfides, can be investigated extensively and the increased conductivity, electrocatalytic characteristics and wide surface area of various metals in the MOF indicate that the rates of electron transfer may increase.

3.3. MOF-derived material-based non-enzymatic sensors
MOFs with highly porous metal oxides (MOs) and MO@C have also been used as sacrificial templates to fabricate high-performance sensor electrodes. Such MOFs fulfill the requirements of a homogenous dispersion of metallic species on carbon materials to provide a carbon coating on these MO nanoparticles to prevent their agglomeration. In addition, materials derived from the unique construction of MOFs also act as good candidates for self-supported electrodes. The excellent structural properties of MOF-derived materials make them potentially interesting for various electrochemical applications. Table 4 summarizes typical examples by using MOF-derived materials for glucose sensing applications.

3.3.1. Carbon/metal/metal oxide-based non-enzymatic sensors. 
Among all transition metals and their oxides, Cu and CuO are interesting materials for electrochemical glucose sensors due to their low cost, non-toxic nature, and environmental stability. Moreover, the electrochemical glucose oxidation on Cu/CuO showed fast kinetics.120,121 In order to avoid aggregation while enhancing their electrocatalytic activity, Cu materials are combined with carbon-based nanomaterials. Compared to pure Cu particles, Cu–carbon nanomaterial composites have shown noticeably enhanced catalytic activity for glucose oxidation.122 MOF-derived metal/metal oxide nanoparticle embedded carbon composites are useful for glucose sensing due to improvements in mass and electron transport processes.123 The metal oxide–carbon structure not only conserves the morphology of the parent MOF but also improves the understanding of the influence of morphology on glucose sensing. Archana et al. reported a disposable, cost-effective, and free-standing CuO/NiO–C composite probe for a flexible nonenzymatic glucose sensor.124 Cello Tape (CT) is used to fabricate a simple and cost-efficient electrode to avoid the blockage of catalytically active sites via binder utilization, cracking or peeling off of the catalyst layer, and poisoning of the modified electrode surface due to the adsorbed intermediate species. CuO/NiO–C shows significant electrochemical behavior toward glucose sensing due to the interconnected network in the material and the synergistic impact of bimetallic oxides. A yolk–shell hollow Ni/NiO@C microsphere structure was synthesized by thermal treatment of well-defined Ni-MOF.125 Because of the more active sites of Ni/NiO nanoparticles, the excellent conductivity of carbon, and hierarchically porous nature of the yolk–shell hollow microsphere structure, the as-synthesized material worked as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for glucose oxidation in alkaline electrolyte and H2O2 reduction in neutral electrolytic solution. The constructed sensor achieved a wide linear range of 0.01 to 10 mM with a sensitivity of 1291 μA mM−1 cm−2 and a detection limit of 0.116 μM for the glucose analyte and exhibited a sensitivity of 32.09 μA mM−1 cm−2, a detection limit of 0.9 μM and a linear range of up to 80.7 mM for the H2O2 analyte.
A binder-free non-enzymatic glucose sensor was proposed based on a porous carbon/Cu composite material.126,163 This composite was prepared through pyrolysis of HKUST-1 (Cu-BTC), which was directly grown on Cu foam by anodic electrodeposition. The excellent electrochemical activity of the modified electrode can be attributed to the three-dimensional hierarchical structure and the synergistic effect between the Cu substrate and porous carbon matrix. Thus, this electrode could be a promising candidate for the fabrication of non-enzymatic glucose sensors, especially for saliva-based glucose sensors due to its ultra-sensitivity. For instance, copper–copper oxide embedded carbon nanostructured materials (Cu–Cu2O–CuO/C) were prepared by the pyrolysis of Cu-based MOFs at 700 °C and 800 °C under an argon atmosphere.127 These composites were washed with HCl solution to obtain Cu/C700 and Cu/C800 nanostructures. Cu/C800 showed superior electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation over the other Cu/C700 material due to its larger specific surface area and lower film thickness on a glassy carbon electrode surface (GCE).
Self-supported electrodes have better electrocatalytic activity in comparison with the same active materials coated on a glassy carbon electrode. Therefore, a porous Ni@C nanosheet membrane was anchored onto inexpensive Ni foam by hydrothermal synthesis followed by carbonization of the Ni–metal organic framework (Ni-MOF) formed on the Ni-foam.128 As the mesoporous Ni@C nanosheets had a 10 nm pore diameter with a platelet morphology, they were favorable for an efficient mass transfer process. This composite acted as a self-supported electrode for glucose sensing with excellent anti-interference performance along with good stability. The glucose concentration obtained using a Ni@C/Ni foam-based sensor (4.15 mM) was in good agreement with the clinical reports which were obtained using a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase sensor (4.25 mM) in human blood serum samples. Ni nanoparticles exhibited an outstanding electrochemical performance as glucose sensors with high sensitivity (32.79 mA mM−1 cm−2), a low detection limit (50 nM), and good stability. However, the narrow linear range of Ni catalysts for glucose sensing limited their practicability. An introduction of another metal can be used to solve this issue through the enhancement of the properties of catalysts. Bimetallic electrocatalysts are good alternative electrodes for non-enzymatic glucose sensors owing to their excellent properties like their easy fabrication, low cost, and high catalytic activity. A self-supported CuNi/C electrode was prepared by electrodeposition of Cu nanoparticles on a Ni-based MOF derivative for a glucose sensor.129 CuNi/C electrodes have the excellent characteristics of hierarchically porous architectures with high conductivity owing to Ni/C substrates. Hence, the CuNi/C electrochemical glucose sensor was capable of exhibiting high sensitivity and a low detection limit. These deposited Cu nanoparticles altered the structure of the derived materials to show an enhanced electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation. A hierarchically porous three-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube array integrated bimetallic cobalt copper organic framework (NCNT MOF CoCu) was successfully prepared using the pyrolysis of a bimetallic cobalt copper organic framework precursor, which shows high electrocatalytic activity for sensing of both glucose and hydrogen peroxide molecules due to the large number of active sites and high surface area of the NCNT structure.130 The fabricated sensor exhibited a high sensitivity of 1027 μA mM−1 cm−2 and 639.5 μA mM−1 cm−2 and an LOD of 0.15 μM and 0.206 μM over a wide linear range 0.05–2.5 mM and 0.05–3.5 mM for glucose and hydrogen peroxide, respectively. The developed sensor was also used as a suitable probe for the detection of glucose and hydrogen peroxide in real blood serum samples and showed acceptable results compared to commercial tests.
Besides the deposition of nanoparticles on MOFs, other methods have been used to fabricate bimetal MOF-based sensors. For example, a novel electrochemical sensing platform was presented based on a NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet (NS)/graphene nanoribbon (GNR) modified GCE for non-enzymatic glucose detection.131 Initially, nanoflower-like NiCo LDH nanosheets were synthesized using ZIF-67 MOFs as templates. In the next step, graphene nanoribbons were prepared through longitudinal unzipping of MWCNTs and mixed with NiCo LDH nanosheets to fabricate a mechanically stable modified electrode. This proposed sensing platform exhibited a fast amperometric response with high sensitivity (344 μA mM−1 cm−2) and a low detection limit (0.6 μM) over a wide linear range (5–800 μM).132
Graphene is a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice-like structure, composed of monolayers of carbon atoms with multifunctional groups. This material exhibits superior properties including large surface area, low manufacturing costs, excellent electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. A novel 3D hierarchically porous Co nanobead/rGO nanocomposite glucose sensor was fabricated by pyrolyzing the corresponding rGO/CoMOF.133 The rGO not only improved the electrical conductivity but also increased the surface area. Such properties caused the enhancement of the electron and mass transfer properties of the Co nanobead/rGO nanocomposite. Recently, bimetallic oxides have been employed as promising electrode materials for electrochemical applications because of their higher catalytic activity and electronic conductivity in comparison with simple metal oxides. A hollow CuCo2O4 polyhedron anchored onto porous reduced graphene oxide (PrGO) was prepared by simple thermal decomposition of heterobimetallic ZIFs/porous graphene oxide (Cu-Co-ZIFs/PGO) (Fig. 9a).134Fig. 9b shows the morphologies of the PGO, Cu-Co-ZIFs, Cu-Co-ZIFs/PGO, and CuCo2O4/PrGO. The PGO displays a wrinkled sheet-like structure with numerous pores. The Cu-Co-ZIF crystals are in a regular rhombic dodecahedron shape and agglomerate with each other to be attached onto the PGO sheets. The particle size of the Cu-Co-ZIF decreases and becomes more uniform with increasing PGO content. The reason is that more PGO provides more crystal nuclei for the growth of Cu-Co-ZIF crystals. After thermal decomposition, PrGO sheets are intertwined with the CuCo2O4 polyhedron crystal structure to make the surface of the polyhedron very rough and inward constricted. PrGO sheets can also serve as protective agents against the agglomeration of metal particles while providing the conduction path for electron transfer. Thus, the composite showed outstanding electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation. Nickel is an attractive transition metal for glucose oxidation with higher electrocatalytic activity. According to density functional theory (DFT), Ni2P shows more catalytic activity than the traditional platinum catalyst.135 A high-performance electrocatalyst (Ni2P/graphene) was reported for nonenzymatic glucose sensors in an alkaline medium based on a Ni-MOF-74/graphene-derived composite.136 Initially, Zhang et al. prepared a MOF-74/graphene composite by a hydrothermal process. Then, it was annealed at 275 °C under an argon atmosphere along with sodium hypophosphite to produce a Ni2P/graphene composite. This composite exhibited not only excellent electrocatalytic activity towards glucose detection but also high selectivity and sensitivity (7234 μA mM−1 cm−2) to glucose in both buffer solution and human serum.

3.3.2. Metal/metal oxide-based non-enzymatic sensors. 
For electrochemical applications, efforts to synthesize nanostructured metals and metal oxides have been made by controlling their size, shape, composition, porosity, and surface area. Different physical and chemical methods have been proposed to develop metal nanostructures. Their practical applications are still limited because of their complicated synthetic process. In this section, the pyrolysis of MOFs has been used as a method to synthesize metal/metal oxides.167
A stacked porous CuO nanosphere structure was derived from Cu-MOF microrods by optimizing the temperature and thermal decomposition atmosphere without any post-treatment.137 Such hierarchical CuO structures, with controllable porosity and adjustable morphology, are efficient electrocatalytic materials for glucose sensing. CuO-350-NA was prepared by first heating it at 350 °C in a nitrogen environment and then in air (Fig. 10(A)). The morphology of CuO-350-NA, varied from the parent molecule, was not smooth due to the self-assembly of homogeneous nanospheres into microrods (Fig. 10(B)(a and b)), indicating a change in the morphology that occurred from the interior to the external surface. These two-step thermal treatment processes prevented the fast formation of new Cu–O bonds and facilitated the construction of hierarchical nanosphere structures with pores (Fig. 10(B)(c and d)). On the other hand, the CuO-350-AIR sample was synthesized by thermal treatment of Cu-MOF at 350 °C in the air (Fig. 10(A)). The rod shape morphology of the CuO-350-AIR sample was almost destroyed, compared to the pristine Cu-MOF microrods, and appeared as clusters (Fig. 10(B)(e)). Higher magnification images of CuO clusters show close packed structures without any space between them (Fig. 10(B)(f–h)), which would restrict the permeation of electrolytes and lead to low electrochemical catalytic activity. The specific surface area of the hierarchically porous CuO-350-NA nanospheres is much larger than that of the CuO-350-AIR cluster structure. The larger surface area provided more electrochemical active sites for glucose oxidation, leading to a higher sensitivity by absorbing more glucose molecules. The CuO-350-NA sample exhibited outstanding sensing performance to glucose with a sensitivity of 1806 μA cm−2 mM−1 in a wide linear range of 0–6.535 mM, and a detection limit of 0.15 μM, while the sensitivity of the CuO-350-AIR sample was 1614.4 μA cm−2 mM−1 with a detection limit of 0.63 μM in the linear range of 0–4.035 mM. Cheng et al. constructed MOF-derived porous CuO polyhedrons on carbon cloth (CC) by an in situ synthetic procedure.138 First, they prepared uniform Cu(OH)2 nanorods on CC, then converted the Cu(OH)2 nanorods into porous CuO polyhedrons through a copper-based metal–organic framework (Cu-BTC) intermediate. This synthetic procedure leads to several advantages. First, the flexible carbon cloth offers more surface area for material growth, excellent mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and good corrosion resistance due to its three-dimensional structure. Second, the ordered structure and the porosity of CuO facilitate the penetration of more glucose molecules and transportation of ions/electrons. Third, the fabricated CuO polyhedron based carbon cloth can be directly used as the electrode for sensing without using any conductive adhesives. The fabricated CuO polyhedron/CC modified electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high sensitivity of 13575 μA mM−1 cm−2 with a response time of 2.3 s and a low detection limit of 0.46 μM in the linear range of 0.5–800 μM.

The fabrication of nanomaterial modified electrodes by electrodeposition is considered as an alternative to the drop-casting method. This method allows the formation of rigidly adhered materials to the underlying substrate and it does not require any additional binders such as Nafion. A CuO film was electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode from Cu-MOF for selective determination of glucose in alkaline media.139 The synthesis processes were as follows: first, Cu(OH)2 NWA cores were fabricated by anodization of Cu foil, then the HKUST-1 shells were transferred to the Cu(OH)2 NW cores’ surfaces by the in situ process. Finally, these Cu(OH)2@HKUST-1 core–shell NWAs were transformed into CuO/Cu2O simultaneously after calcination and formed CuO/Cu2O@CuO/Cu2O NWAs. By tuning the Cu-MOF concentration, deposition potential, and time, self-supported CuO/Cu2O@CuO/Cu2O core–shell nanowire arrays (NWAs) derived from Cu(OH)2/HKUST-1 core–shell NWAs were synthesized. The structure of the CuO/Cu2O@CuO/Cu2O core–shell NWAs provided a large surface area, abundant active sites, and also good electrolyte permeability in the electrochemical measurement.140 This composite performed as an excellent glucose sensor with the least anti-interference effects (e.g., towards uric acid, ascorbic acid, and L-cysteine co-existing with glucose). In addition, a novel electrochemical Cu3(BTC)2-derived CuO nanorod-modified electrode was fabricated and used as a non-enzymatic glucose sensor.141 The CuO nanorods showed higher glucose sensitivity because of their larger surface area, compared with commercial CuO powder and other CuO-based electrocatalysts.
A three-dimensional (3D) nickel oxide (NiO) electrode was fabricated by annealing a Ni-MOF-based membrane.142 The excellent electrochemical performance of this modified electrode was attributed to the uniform distribution of NiO particles on the Ni mesh, direct electron transfer from the Ni mesh to electroactive NiO particles, and high porosity. In order to achieve electrochemical glucose sensing, NiO needs to be activated into high-valent nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) before it can be used as a catalyst for glucose oxidation. The peak current in the cyclic voltammogram increases with the scan rate. The linear relationship between the corresponding peak current and the square root of the scan rate suggests that the electron transfer process is limited by diffusion. Because Ni(OH)2 is electrochemically oxidized to NiOOH, which diffuses to the electrode surface from the bulk electrolyte solution, it may be used for electrochemical glucose sensing. A nonenzymatic glucose sensor was built based on a Au nanoparticle decorated Ni metal–organic framework (MOF)/Ni/NiO nanocomposite.143 The Au–Ni composite was synthesized by calcination of Ni-MOF followed by physical adsorption of Au nanoparticles. The Au–Ni composite modified electrode showed better electrocatalytic activity towards glucose oxidation with a LOD of 0.1 μM and a linear range of 0.4–900 μM in alkaline media (e.g., compared to the Ni-MOF/Ni/NiO composite modified electrode).143
A novel Co(OH)2/GCE modified electrode was fabricated via a layer-by-layer deposition method followed by normal immersion in NaOH solution.144 The electrodeposition method was used to fabricate benzoic acid-functionalized GCE (F-GCE) and Co(BTC) MOF/GCE modified electrodes. Then, Co(OH)2 with a hierarchical flake nanostructure/GCE was constructed by immersing the Co(BTC) MOF/GCE modified electrode into 0.1 M NaOH solution at room temperature. Finally, the Co(OH)2/GCE showed good performance toward glucose detection with a linear range from 0.005 to 6.7 mM and a LOD of 1.73 mM. Enzymatic free electrochemical glucose sensors are developed based on a cobalt-based metal–organic framework (Co-MOF) and MOF-derived cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) by ionothermal and one-pot conversion methods.145 The introduction of an ionic liquid enhances the electrical conductivity of the MOF, thereby improving its electrochemical performance by increasing the interlayer distance with anchoring ionic liquid cations. Co-MOF showed better electrocatalytic activity toward glucose-sensing than MOF-derived Co(OH)2 in an alkaline solution because of the support of the ionic liquid.
The applicability of certain transition metal oxides (such as Co3O4 composites) has been explored more intensively due to their enhanced electrocatalytic activity and chemical stability.146 Madhu et al. prepared a pongam seed shell-derived activated carbon and cobalt oxide nanocomposite (PSAC/Co3O4) for two different applications such as high performance nonenzymatic electrochemical glucose sensors and supercapacitors. In addition, the fabricated glucose sensor exhibited an ultrahigh sensitivity of 34.2 mA mM−1 cm−2 with a low detection limit (21 nM) and long-term durability. For example, cobalt oxide hollow nanododecahedra (Co3O4-HND) were synthesized by the calcination of a Co-based metal–organic framework (Co-ZIF-67) at 300 °C under an oxygen atmosphere.147 The composite exhibited high catalytic activity and showed outstanding electrochemical performance for determining glucose with a good window of 2.0 μM to 6.06 mM. This sensor showed a high sensitivity (708.4 μA mM−1cm−2), a low detection limit of 0.58 μM (S/N = 3), and a fast response time (<2 s). The same strategy was also used to prepare a nanoporous carbon (NPC)/Co3O4 composite from a single precursor source of ZIF-67 by a two-step thermal annealing process in an inert atmosphere.148 The differential pulse voltammetric response of the NPC/Co3O4 composite modified electrode exhibits linearity in the concentration range of 5 × 10−12–2.05 × 10−10 M for glucose sensing with a low detection limit of 2 × 10−12 M. Han et al. fabricated a glucose sensor based on Co3O4 with a curved sheet morphology by rationally designing a Co-based metal–organic framework.149 The one-dimensional molecule structures of Co-MOF precursors were further stacked into micro-flower clusters via a 3D framework. Then, the micro-flower clusters were transformed into Co3O4 sheets by thermal treatment in air. The Co3O4-modified glassy carbon electrode (Co3O4/GCE) showed excellent glucose sensing performance with sensitivities of 254.21 μA mM−1 cm−2 and 102.80 μA mM−1 cm−2 in the range of 0.001–2 μM and 2–8 mM. Abrori et al. used FeBDC (BDC = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate)-derived Fe3O4 as a sensitive layer for electrochemical detection of glucose due to its large surface area and sensitive and selective electrocatalytic activity.150–152 The resulting Fe3O4-based electrochemical glucose sensor had sensitivity characteristics of 4.67 μA mM−1 cm−2, a linear detection range of 0 to 9 mM, a lower detection limit of 15.70 μM, and good stability and reproducibility.

Summary. The outstanding sensing performance of MOF-derived non-enzymatic sensors encourages scientists to investigate them. Furthermore, high selectivity and sensitivity to human serum can also be achieved using MOF-derived electrodes, suggesting that they are very promising for practical applications, with outstanding stability and reproducibility. Application of certain transition metals can lead to outstanding, very sensitive electrical performance and broad ranges of detection.

3.4. Drawbacks of non-enzymatic glucose sensors
Because of the low biocompatibility, high price, and time-intensive production procedures of some new glucose sensors based on MOFs or metal/metal oxides, the need for introducing more selective MOF composite materials with low detection limits, broad detection ranges, and quick reaction times is even more urgent than before. It is still a challenge for available sensors to continuously monitor glucose levels.
4. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we have discussed MOF-based materials for functionalization of detection electrodes and their application in the evaluation of glucose in diabetes patients. The enzymatic reaction while performing analysis of glucose is a key factor in the detection of glucose moieties with other sample factors taken into consideration regarding sensitivity. The large surface area, high degree of chemical tunability, and high charge storage properties of MOF-based materials increase their electrocatalytic activity, which makes them potential candidates for glucose sensing. The immobilization of detection electrodes with such MOF-based materials enhances their sensitivity and selectivity with the inhibition of interfering moieties. The glucose sensitivity of these electrodes is determined by two electrochemical methods, viz. amperometry and differential pulse voltammetry. Based on the biorecognition elements, such sensors can be classified into two types. One is based on enzyme functionalization and the other type is non-enzyme-based sensors.
The amalgamation of biorecognition elements, high sensitivity and selectivity, and simplicity make such biosensors potential candidates for the rapid and one-spot quantification of glucose. The interfacial characteristics of the biorecognition element and the degree of chemical tunability of the host moiety have a significant role in the pretentiousness of the biocatalytic commotion on the electrode's surface. Selective integration of enzymes into the pores of MOFs is aided by fine tailoring of the pore size and pore walls. The biocompatibility and high surface area favoring a high enzyme loading into 3D-MOF voids favor the diffusion of glucose and glucose oxidase and also decrease the leaching process. Such biosensors involve the immobilization of biomolecules such as enzymes into the cavities of MOFs or MOF-based materials. Based on these biomolecules, these sensors are further classified into single enzyme-based biosensors and multienzyme-based biosensors. Generally, glucose oxidase (GDH) and glucose dehydrogenase are used for glucose sensing. Various MOFs reported are ZIF-8, ZIF-9, ZIF-67, ZIF-68, ZIF-70, MIL-100(Fe), MIL-127(Fe), etc., which proves MOFs as potential substrates for the detection of glucose in diabetic patients. Though both enzymes GOx and GDH show better electrocatalytic activity with high sensitivity and target specificity, there are certain limitations. GOx based sensors are hygroscopic and are sensitive to very low and very high pH values. GOx and GDH have poor thermal stability, due to which these sensors show errors in sensing results at temperatures above 40 °C. Apart from these, MOFs in conjunction with various nanomaterials are also used for the evaluation of glucose samples. GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) and Tb@mesoMOF-CNT composites are such examples of reported bioelectrodes. This conjunction with various nanomaterials gives an additional concurrent reaction. The GOx@ZIF-8(TiO2) composite induces glucose oxidation and H2O2 reduction, while the Tb@mesoMOF-CNT composite induces glucose oxidation plus NAD+ reduction.
The use of multi-enzymes is another process for the modification of MOF-based electrodes. The immobilization of GOx and HRP within ZIF-8 is an example of a multi-enzyme sensing system. The main advantage of such a system is that the electrode will receive electrons directly from HRP so as to retain the activity of GOx for a longer time.
Another strategy in glucose detection deals with the decoration of MOFs’ pores with natural metalloporphyrins. Catalysis, redox reactions, and loading platforms within a single material are indicative of the multifunctional roles of MOF composites. Hemin, a metalloporphyrin, acts as a redox mediator in the electrochemical Fe(III)/Fe(II) reversible redox reaction and also acts as a peroxidase-like activity-based catalyst. The MOF MIL-101(Al)-NH2 oxidizes peroxidase in the presence of H2O2, which further promotes glucose oxidation with the help of GOx immobilization. Apart from heme porphyrin, derivatized and other metal porphyrins are also used for glucose sensing, but their poor conductivity has limited their use. PorPC is an example of such derivatized porphyrins.
Rapid analysis with high sensitivity and target specificity makes use of non-enzyme sensors an appropriate technique for glucose sensing but the use of enzymes for immobilization is often hindered by their operational instability, tough retrieval, and lack of reusability. The immobilization strategies of such enzymes on substrates in order to stabilize them in a peculiar atmosphere while retaining their operational performance are an important concern. To overcome such disadvantages, non-enzymatic sensors are the suitable option which is based on the direct electrocatalysis of electrode materials. The increase in reaction exposure surface of MOF materials can facilitate rapid analysis by accomplishing electrochemical reactions at a faster rate. Cu-MOFs, [Cu3(btc)2] nanocubes, Ni-MIL-77 ultrathin nanobelts, etc., are some of the examples of MOF-based electrode materials. These MOF-based materials also reduced the cost and efforts of enzymes and their immobilization, respectively.
To improve the physicochemical properties of MOFs, certain carbon and other metal or metal oxide materials are also used by some researchers for the evaluation of glucose. These carbon nanomaterials include graphene derivatives, CNTs, and carbon black. Improving electro-conductivity is another strategy for designing novel versions of MOFs to attain a better LOD in sensing glucose moieties. For this, metal or metal oxides are generally added. This enhances the electrochemical performance and stability due to their excellent conductivity, ultra-large specific surface area, and high mechanical strength. Ag@ZIF-67, Au@MIL-100(Fe), and Cu-in-ZIF-8 are some of the modified MOF versions reported in the scientific literature.
Apart from these, 3D hierarchically porous Co nanobead/rGO nanocomposites were also used to fabricate glucose sensors to improve electrical conductivity due to the increased surface area and thus enhanced electron and mass transfer properties of the Co nanobead/rGO nanocomposites. Certain bimetallics such as Cu-Co-ZIFs/PGO, NiCo-MOF-74 particles and Co-Nx/C also prove to be a better option in the development of new generation MOFs.164,166 Apart from Cu-, Ni-, and Co-based MOFs, other transition metal–organic frameworks based on Al, Zn, Au, Tb, and Fe have also been explored for the better sensing of glucose. All these approaches and analytical strategies have potential significance in the electrochemical sensing of glucose with the integration of hybrid MOFs and have potential solutions in future applied research subjects. Furthermore, recent progress in machine learning tools in correlating sensitivity with material physicochemical properties and functions to decouple glucose signals from other interfering moieties holds promising future in advances in glucose sensing. Future research needs to enable practical application of MOFs in electrochemical glucose sensing. Also, the analysis of catalysts after use can be investigated by using AZtecFeature particle analysis software and high sensitivity X-Max and Ultim Max EDS analysis.
Most investigations should focus on developing a sensor with a broad linear range, a low detection limit, and good anti-interference characteristics. Besides the wide area, rich redox-active sites and appropriate pores for load transference for ion stability need to be investigated in the future research of MOF based glucose sensing. Researchers’ work in the future is anticipated to push forward toward developing test kits capable of detecting very minute amounts of glucose using various body fluids and portable, subcutaneous, and tiny implantable devices. Spintronic detection methods have been suggested in an effort to go beyond the existing electrochemical approaches. Traditional electronics have long been seen as being slower, less efficient, and using more energy. But recently spintronics have been shown to be much more efficient and quicker, and using less electricity.
The summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the application of pristine MOFs, MOF composites and MOF hybrids for glucose sensing is shown in Table 5.
