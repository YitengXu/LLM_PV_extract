1 Introduction
Semiconductor nanomaterials have received considerable interest. In the fields of optics and optoelectronics, solar cell absorbers and photovoltaic devices based on nanomaterials are excellent candidates, for their high efficiency, low cost and abundant diversity.1–4 A high photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE), up to 20%, has been achieved in organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells,5,6 and copper zinc tin sulfoselenide (CZTSSe) solar cells with a certified efficiency of 12.6% have been reported.7 Furthermore, controllable thin films and various devices are conveniently fabricated from the colloid nanocrystal “ink”, combined with spin-coating and mature ink-jet printing technology. Until now, several tens of nanocrystals have been investigated, like the binary CdS, CdSe, InP, SnO, ternary ZnSnP2, CuTaN2, CuInS2, CuInSe2 and quaternary Cu2ZnSnS, CIGS4.8–16 However, both organic and inorganic hybrid perovskites are unstable under ambient conditions, which limits their practical application in the solar cell field. Cd is a toxic element, and In, Ga and Te are rare elements. There is still an urgent need to explore highly efficient, nontoxic nanocrystals for application in photovoltaic cells.
Recently, novel I–V–VI2 ternary copper antimony sulfide semiconductor nanocrystals have emerged as a promising photovoltaic candidate,17–24 because of the nontoxic nature of the constituent elements, earth-abundance and low cost components compared with In, Ga, Te, and Cd. All the four phases developed, namely, CuSbS2, Cu12Sb4S13, Cu3SbS4 and Cu3SbS3, are p-type semiconductors with a band gap from 1.1 to 2.5 eV, and have strong absorption in the visible region (>105 cm−1 for bulk CuSbS2).19 Previous works mainly focused on the controllable synthesis method, steady-state absorption, electronics, magnetics and band gap properties. It is worth noting that our previous work illustrates a green synthesis method of CAS NCs with high yield (up to 90%), including CuSbS2, Cu3SbS4 and Cu12Sb4S13,17 which is essential for their practical use in photovoltaic devices. Nevertheless, their intrinsic photon induced carrier dynamics within the intraband and interband is still barely touched. The investigation of electron and hole relaxation dynamics makes great sense to the realization of the potential of CAS NCs in applications such as photovoltaic cells and other optoelectronic devices.
In semiconductor NCs utilized for photovoltaic device applications, the electrons and holes undergo spatial separation, cooling, trapping and recombination. The photoinduced separation of electrons and holes will generate photovoltage and current, then drive the redox reaction at the surfaces.25,26 So, the effective separation of electrons and holes is important for high performance devices. However, many surface states exist on NCs, and the carriers can easily be trapped by these surface states and affect the performance of the optoelectronic devices.27 Thus, the understanding of the carrier dynamics is important for the practical use of semiconductor NCs. In this contribution, we demonstrate the ultrafast dynamics of photo-induced carriers of the as-prepared CuSbS2, Cu12Sb4S13, and Cu3SbS4 NCs at the visible spectrum band, with the assistance of the fs-resolved pump–probe technique. Three components of the decay dynamics at the time scale of femtoseconds and picoseconds are fitted and attributed to carrier cooling, trapping and recombination. Besides, the saturable absorption (SA) to reverse saturable absorption (RSA) transition indicates that CAS NCs have potential for application as an optical limiter.
2 Characterization of copper antimony sulfide nanocrystals
Copper antimony sulfide (CAS) quantum dots (QDs), including CuSbS2, Cu12Sb4S13, and Cu3SbS4, are synthesized through a hot-injection method according to our previous work,17 and the details are elaborated in the fabrication section of the ESI.†. The phase controllable preparation can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of the three precursors. From Fig. 1(a)–(c), one can easily find that the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized samples are in good agreement with the CuSbS2, Cu12Sb4S13, and Cu3SbS4 patterns, respectively. Moreover, the intense peaks can be indexed as the (111), (200), (240), and (022) crystal planes of orthorhombic CuSbS2 for Fig. 1(a), (222) and (440) reflections of cubic Cu12Sb4S13 for Fig. 1(b), and (112) and (204) crystal planes of tetragonal Cu3SbS4 for Fig. 1(c). The chemical compositions of the as-prepared CAS have also been characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), as shown in Fig. 1(d)–(f). From the EDS results, it is clear that the elemental ratios (Cu:Sb:S) of various samples are very close to those of stoichiometric CuSbS2, Cu12Sb4S13, and Cu3SbS4, respectively, which can further confirm the phases of the as-prepared samples and be well matched with the results shown in Fig. 1(a)–(c).
 Fig. 1  The XRD patterns and EDS spectra of CuSbS2 (a and d), Cu12Sb4S13 (b and e), and Cu3SbS4 (c and f), respectively. 
The microstructures of the as-prepared CAS are further studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Fig. 2(a)–(c) show the TEM images of CAS, where one can clearly find that the CAS QDs are quasi-spherical QDs. Moreover, the size distribution histograms shown in Fig. 2(d)–(f) reveal that the CAS QDs have the diameters of 6.23 ± 0.70 nm (σ = 11.2%), 5.35 ± 0.41 nm (σ = 7.7%), and 4.72 ± 0.52 nm (σ = 11.0%) for CuSbS2, Cu12Sb4S13, and Cu3SbS4, respectively. These results show that all the standard deviations of the CAS QDs are about 10%, which suggests that these QDs are monodisperse with narrow size distributions. Fig. 2(g)–(i) show the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of various CAS QDs. The well-resolved lattice fringes reveal that the as-prepared CAS QDs are single crystals. Furthermore, the clear lattice distances of 0.297 nm, 0.300 nm, and 0.313 nm can be correlated with the (200), (222), and (112) crystal planes of CuSbS2, Cu12Sb4S13, and Cu3SbS4, respectively. These results further confirm the crystal structures of the as-synthesized QDs, which are well fitted with the XRD results shown in Fig. 1(a)–(c).

The steady-state optical absorption of CuSbS2, Cu3SbS4 and Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals was measured at room temperature (298 K). All the three phases of copper antimony sulfide nanocrystals have strong absorption in the visible spectrum band, and are blue shifted compared with the bulk materials (CuSbS2 (chalcostibite), Cu12Sb4S13 (tetrahedrite), and Cu3SbS4 (fematinite)),28 resulting from the quantum confinement effect. Only little difference can be observed from the stead-state absorption spectra. Interestingly, Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals show some absorption in the infrared (IR) range, which might be applied in the infrared photonics. To obtain the band gap of the nanocrystals, the tauc plot was employed by plotting (Ahν)1/nversus hν, where A is the absorbance of the sample, hν is the photon energy of light, and n is 2 for indirect band gap materials and 0.5 for direct band gap materials.29 The fitted band gap values (shown in Fig. 3(b)) are 1.4 eV and 1.6 eV for indirect band gap Cu3SbS4 and CuSbS2 NCs, and 2.1 eV for direct band gap Cu12Sb4S13 NCs, by extrapolating the linear portion of the spectrum in the band edge region, which agree well with our previous report.17

3 Experimental setup
3.1 Nonlinear optical absorption
Nonlinear absorption is investigated using the open-aperture Z-scan technique,30 schematically shown in Fig. 4. The absorption properties are characterized by moving the Cu12Sb4S13 NC along the symmetric Gaussian beam, where the light intensity varies with the “z” axis. The as-prepared CAS NC dispersed in n-hexane solvent is held in a 1 mm cuvette, which is fixed at the computer-controlled transfer stage. Input ultrafast pulses are generated from a Ti:sapphire amplifier (center wavelength: 800 nm; repetition rate: 1 kHz; pulse width: ∼100 fs). The beam is divided into two by a 10/90 splitter. The small-proportion light collected by detector 1 is set as reference and the rest 90% part is used to excite the sample. Using a lens (f = 50 cm), the parallel beam is shaped into a symmetric spatial profile (radius of the beam waist is ∼40 μm). The nonlinear absorption properties can be deduced by fitting the normalized transmittance P2/P1, where P1 and P2 are the powers of the referenced detector 1 and signal detector 2. The intensity dependent nonlinear absorption can be further confirmed by the P-scan technology,31 namely, a variable attenuator is placed before the splitter and employed to change the incident power, while the sample is fixed at the focal position.

3.2 Transient absorption measurements
The non-degenerate fs-resolved transient absorption (TA) spectrum technique is employed to study the ultrafast photoinduced carrier dynamics of the CAS NCs.32Fig. 5 gives the diagram of the TA experiments. The pump light (wavelength: 400 nm) is generated from the optical parametric amplifier (TPR-TOPAS-U, America) through nonlinear frequency conversion, and half chopped to a repetition rate of 500 Hz, which sufficiently pumps the electrons to a highly excited state for most semiconductors by single photon injection. The probe light, a femtosecond white continuum (1 kHz, 400 nm–720 nm), is generated by delivering the amplified fs pulses into a thin CaF2 crystal through self-phase modulation (SPM). The electrons can be excited to the conduction band when the sample if injected by the pump pulse, then undergo a series of relaxation dynamics, and recombine with the holes. The detector and spectrometer collect and analyse the wavelength dependent absorption difference of the probe light when the delay line moves, that is the TA signal (ΔA). Here, ΔA is the absorption difference of the probe light with/without the pump light (the details are provided in the ESI†). The spot diameters of the pump and probe beam in the sample are ∼340 μm and ∼120 μm, respectively. Besides, the energy for the pump is larger than for the probe, in order to observe high signal-to-noise TA absorption signals. In general, the TA signals are generated by multi-dynamics in semiconductors, like ground state bleaching (GBS, ΔA < 0), excited state absorption (ESA, ΔA > 0) and stimulated emission (SE, ΔA < 0).

4 Results and discussion
Only linear absorption exists at low intensity, where linear transmittance of the Cu12Sb4S13 NCs dispersion is measured to be 28.6% and the corresponding linear absorption coefficient is 12.5 cm−1. After increasing the pulse energy, a transition from saturable absorption to reverse saturable absorption is observed from the experimental results of Cu12Sb4S13 NCs (Fig. 6(a)). Initially, transmittance increases with the optical intensity and shows a typical bleaching signal when the input laser pulse energy is less than 0.22 μJ. More intensity induced stronger saturable absorption. Thus, the modulation depth varies from 0.9% to 1.6% when the incident energy varies from 0.05 μJ to 0.22 μJ. A reverse saturable absorption signal occurs when the energy is over 0.22 μJ, and the valley deepens with the increased light intensity. These intensity dependent nonlinear absorption properties can be further confirmed by the P-scan technology. The normalized transmittance versus the input intensity is shown in Fig. 6(b), which increases when the energy is lee than 0.22 μJ and then decreases thereafter, matching well with the Z-scan experimental results.
 Fig. 6  (a) Z-scan experimental results under the incident power from 0.05 to 0.96 mW. (b) P-scan curve: transmittance versus incident pump power. 
To obtain the nonlinear absorption coefficient, a model concerning both SA and RSA is employed. The total absorption coefficient α(I) can be written as33,34 (1)where α0 is the linear absorption coefficient, IS is the saturable light intensity, and β is the two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient. Therefore, the modified normalized transmittance deduced from eqn (1) can be expressed as (2)where Q(z) = exp(α0LI/(I + IS)) and q(z) = βI0Leff/(1 + (z/z0)2). I0 is the on-focus light intensity, Leff = (1 − e−α0L)/α0 is the effective length of the sample, L is the length of the sample, and z0 is the Rayleigh length.
It is worth noting that the pure solvent may contribute some nonlinear absorption at high incident energy. A pure solvent is also measured as reference at the pulse energy of 0.22 μJ and 0.96 μJ as shown in Fig. 7. One can see that the solvent contributes 1/8 compared with the CAS dispersion to the total SA signal when the energy is 0.22 μJ. At the high intensity of 0.96 μJ, the solvent also gives weak SA, while the total signal is changed into RSA, which indicates that the total nonlinear absorption is from the CAS NCs, not the solvent.

The value of IS and β can be obtained by plotting the Z-scan experimental data using eqn (2). The calculated IS and β are listed in Table 1. In the SA regime, it can be seen that β is negative. Both IS and β increase with the incident energy. The largest value of IS and β is 5.5 GW cm−2 and −0.27 × 10−3 m GW−1 at the pulse energy of 0.22 μJ. For RSA, β is positive and increases with the pulse energy, and IS also increases with the energy. This intensity related SA to RSA phenomenon has been investigated in other nano-materials.34–36 Under low intensity, bleaching of the ground state absorption is dominant, thus giving the SA signal. RSA occurs when the intensity rises further, which originates from the two-photon absorption. It is worth noting that RSA is a typical phenomenon in optical limiting devices, indicating that CAS NCs are potential candidates for application in this field.

The transient absorption spectra of CAS NCs versus delay line and probe wavelength are shown in Fig. 8. It is easily observed from the spectra that the absorption intensity for all three phases shows wavelength related characters, with non-symmetric profiles peaking at ∼650 nm corresponding to the energy bandgap. The absorption spectra at the delay line of 0.3–50 ps suggest that the decay dynamics is fast at the earlier stage and slow later as shown in Fig. 8(d)–(f), which can be attributed to different relaxation processes. Under the pump power and wavelength of 100 μW and 400 nm (3.1 eV), TA signals for CuSbS2 within the measured probe spectrum band are positive. The wide band positive signal is mainly from the ESA. That is to say, the absorption section of the excited state is larger than that of the ground state (σ1 > σ0), resulting in an increase in the fluence dependent absorption coefficient, which can be understood by the following explanation:37 The steady-state absorption coefficient can be depicted as α0 = σ0N, and evolved as the fluence dependent nonlinear absorption coefficient: α(I) = σ0n0 + σ1n1. As a result, the absorption difference is calculated to be positive, under the condition of σ1 > σ0, where N (N = n0 + n1), n0, n1, I0 and Iex are the total population of the carriers, population at the ground state, population at the excited state, and transmitted probe intensity without and with the pump beam. The TA spectra of Cu3SbS4 and Cu12Sb4S13 have a similar absorption profile and peak wavelength (shown in Fig. 8(c)–(f)), despite the intensity difference, which results from the amounts of carriers participating in the relaxation dynamics.

To estimate the broad band photon induced absorption, the global fitting technique is employed to analyse the TA spectra and cooling dynamics. As the whole probe band spectra show similar relaxation dynamics, only one principal component can resolve the whole profile via singular value decomposition. The obtained principal kinetics for CuSbS2 dispersion is shown in Fig. 9(a), giving three time constants, which are 360.6 fs, 5.159 ps and 62.77 ps. The corresponding TA spectra are shown in Fig. 9(b), which nearly reproduce the measured spectra in Fig. 8(b), and further confirm the uniform photon induced absorption at the white continuum band. Moreover, the values for Cu3SbS4 and Cu12Sb4S13 are fitted to be 360.0 fs, 5.002 ps, 42.49 ps and 369.9 fs, 3.840 ps, 42.44 ps, respectively (principal spectra and kinetics are shown in Fig. S3, ESI†).

The charge carrier dynamics can be attributed to the electrons and holes’ excitation, trapping and recombination. A valence/conduction band model (Fig. 10(a)) is introduced to show the dynamics of electron and hole relaxation. After photoexcitation, electrons are instantly excited a highly excited state through the vertical Franck Condon transition within a short period of ∼300 fs and meanwhile the holes are left off the valence band. For semiconductor materials, the investigation of the carrier “decay” dynamics is quite important to analyze the mechanism and potential for practical application in optoelectronic devices. A three-exponential model  is employed to fit the decay dynamics of the charge carriers. Excited electrons/holes at high energy states will “decay” to the edge of the conduction/valence band in the first 381 fs. Owing to trapping of the surface states, the charge carriers were trapped at the surface for a relatively long period of about 5.5 ps. At last, the electrons and holes recombine in a long period of 65.6 ps. Fig. 10(b) gives the carrier dynamics at the probe wavelength of 550 nm (inset is the part at the earlier 6 ps). What should be pointed out is a tiny valley at the front of the rise dynamics, which comes from the n-hexane solvent response (see ESI† (Fig. S1)).

After 400 nm excitation, the electrons are pumped to high states of the conduction band, leaving off the holes at the valence band (I). Excited charge carriers cool down to the band edge (II).

(c) Power dependent relaxation from 22.5 to 500 μW. (d) Linear peak response of the dynamics until the power reaches 500 μW without saturation occurring. 
The power dependence of the dynamics is investigated at the pump power of 22.5–500 μW. No obvious nonlinear response occurs, until the pump power reaches 500 μW, despite the increase in the intensity and signal-to-noise ratio, as shown in Fig. 10(c). Moreover, the multi-excitation is still within the linear range without saturation occurring, as proved by Fig. 10(d), indicating that the observed signals are from single photon excitation processes. Nevertheless, more carriers can be excited, trapped and recombined when the power increases. It is easily deduced that the lifetimes of decay dynamics will increase, accordingly. Table 2 summarizes the lifetimes τ1, τ2 and τ3versus pump power. Interestingly, τ1 increases from 0.287 ps to 0.491 ps, τ2 from 4.7 ps to 10.1 ps, and τ3 from 56.9 ps to 95.1 ps, with the pump power increasing from 22.5 to 500 μW.

The broad band photoinduced absorption signals are shown in Fig. 7. Although the global fitting analysis can be conducted using a simple model with one principal component, the relaxation dynamics versus probe wavelength for CuSbS2 are further investigated at four different wavelengths, from 530 nm to 650 nm. Despite some absorption intensity difference, the cooling dynamics for the CuSbS2 NC is independent of the probe wavelength, which can be proved by the normalized ΔA (Fig. 11(a)). Similar wavelength independent dynamics have been investigated in other semiconductors.38–40 As three different phases of the CAS NCs (CuSbS2, Cu3SbS4 and Cu12Sb4S13) are successfully synthesized, their cooling dynamics are compared under the same condition. It is clearly seen that Cu3SbS4 and Cu12Sb4S13 NCs decay faster than the CuSbS2, shown from the normalized relaxation dynamics in Fig. 11(b). For Cu3SbS4, τ1, τ2, and τ3 are 0.328 ps, 4.4 ps and 35 ps, whereas the lifetimes are 0.330, 4.9 ps and 62.6 ps for CuSbS2. And the time constant for Cu12Sb4S13 NCs is nearly the same as that for Cu3SbS4. It is worth mentioning that the stoichiometric ratios of Cu3SbS4 and Cu12Sb4S13 NCs are similar and are different from CuSbS2. One possible explanation is that surface states have a close relationship with the stoichiometry of the CAS NCs, resulting in the difference of the decay dynamics. Previous works have studied the electronic energy band structure for CAS NCs, where CuSbS2 and Cu3SbS4 are indirect band gap materials and Cu12Sb4S13 has a direct band gap structure.19 It can be deduced that the dynamics have a close relationship with the stoichiometric amount of Cu, Sb and S or size decided surface states, not the band structure.

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we demonstrate the transition from the photoinduced bleaching to absorption with the assist of Z-scan technique, and the spatial separation and recombination of electrons/holes on CAS NCs using fs-resolved TA spectra. It is found that the hot electrons decay to the band edge of the conduction band at a time scale of hundreds of femtoseconds. As abundant surface states, defect states exist, coming from the near Bohr radius size confinement, the carriers were trapped at a timescale of several picoseconds. At last, electrons and holes recombine during tens of picoseconds. Also, carrier dynamics versus probe wavelength, pump power and phases were investigated. This work suggests that CAS NCs can be a potential candidate for application in the optical limiting system. And the study on intrinsic electron/hole dynamics will aid in the improvement of CAS based optoelectronic devices.
