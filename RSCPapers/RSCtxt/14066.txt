    , Accepted 7th March 2023First published on 7th March 2023AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) materials with upright stacking form layered van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) are currently believed to be attractive prospects for optoelectronic, photocatalytic, and thermoelectric devices because they can merge the capabilities of distinct 2D materials. Herein, we evaluate the electronic, optical, photocatalytic, and thermoelectric response of model-I and model-II of Ars/SGaInS vdWHs via first-principles computations. The energetic, dynamical, and thermal stabilities of these vdWHs suggest great promise in experimental functionality. Model-I and model-II are indirect semiconductors with type-II band alignment and bandgaps of 1.53 eV and 1.86 eV, respectively. The built-in electric field considerably accelerates the transmission of electrons from the Ars layer to the SGaInS layer. Compared to pristine monolayers, both models contain appropriate band edge positions to ensure overall water splitting efficiently. Interestingly, at −8% compressive strain, model-I secures type-III band alignment, which is very advantageous for field-effect transistors. In the visible and ultraviolet zones of the radiating spectrum, the proposed vdWHs significantly improved the absorption spectra, and the biaxial strain also has a considerable impact on optical absorption. The investigated vdWHs have high Seebeck coefficients and substantial electrical conductivities, which contribute to high power factor values, particularly at 700 K. The outcomes specify that our designed Ars/SGaInS vdWHs have a multifunctional character that can perform a better role in optoelectronics, photovoltaics, photocatalysis, tunneling field effect transistors, and thermoelectric devices.
Introduction
The extremely sophisticated research on the structural impacts of material characteristics in accordance with their dimensionality has made materials science a renowned field. The characteristics of bulk materials have been defined by the unrestricted migration of electrons in all possible directions.1 Due to quantum confinement, 2D materials have influenced the study of materials because of their outstanding structural, electrical, optical, magnetic, and thermoelectric characteristics.1–4 These can be applied for numerous purposes, such as sensing, catalysis, storage applications, thermoelectric devices, and electrical components, for e.g., field-effect transistors.5–8 Numerous studies have demonstrated that 2D semiconductor materials are much suited to increase green energy compared to their bulk analogues because the greater specific surface area of 2D monolayers can deliver an improved redox reaction.9 This is because 2D materials have recently been thought to have new physical and chemical capabilities.10–12
2D semiconductors have already been distinguished as prospective applicants for water splitting photocatalysts.4,13 The production and isolation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs are made easier by 2D semiconductor photocatalysts, which greatly shorten the transformation paths of photogenerated electrons and holes.14–16 On the basis of a recommended framework to split water, the valence band edge potential (EVBM) of the photocatalysts needs to be more negative compared to the oxidation potential, and the conduction band edge potential (ECBM) must be more positive compared to the reduction potential.17,18 In addition, the semiconductor photocatalyst must have at least a 1.23 eV bandgap. A photocatalyst with a 1.5–3.1 eV range of bandgap is much suited to efficiently exploit sunlight because visible light makes up half of the solar radiation.14,19 Recent research suggests that the built-in electric field may bypass the 1.23 eV bandgap restriction of photocatalysts.20 The band edge potentials are calculated with regard to the vacuum levels that are also changed as a result of the two surfaces with varied vacuum levels, thus expanding the overpotentials of the photogenerated carriers.21,22 Photocatalyst proficiency is also strictly constrained by solar power conversion, optical absorption, and photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination. Building the type-II vdWHs, the conduction band minima (CBMn) and valence band maxima (VBMx) are distributed spatially at various layers, which encourages the proficient detachment of photogenerated electron–hole pairs23–25 and improves the effectiveness of solar energy transformation.26 On the other hand, thermoelectric nanodevices facilitate the direct and reversible thermal-to-electrical energy conversion based on the Seebeck effect,27 offering a viable method for producing electricity from waste heat. The effects of climate change and pollution on the environment will be minimized as a result of using this method.28 A strong thermoelectric material needs to have a good electrical conductivity, minor thermal conductivity, and a large Seebeck coefficient.29 However, these fundamental characteristics are tightly linked and depend on the electronic and crystal structure.
Group III MX-monochalcogenides (where M = Ga and In and X = S, Se, and Te) are a new class of 2D monolayers, drawing tremendous focus because of their possible usage in upcoming optoelectronic devices.30–32 By mechanical cleavage and solvent exfoliation, 2D GaS and GaSe have been effectively manufactured from their bulk analogs.33,34 Compared to graphene or other 2D materials, these 2D GaS and GaSe materials show greater optical sensitivities. In addition, InSe has been successfully synthesized through experimentation, and it possesses a broad bandgap, good metal contacts, and great electron mobility.35 Some 2D MX materials, such as GaS monolayer, have a very large indirect bandgap (>3.0 eV), which leads to the ineffective absorption of visible light.36,37 The electronic properties of materials are significantly influenced by their structural symmetry. Compared to pristine monolayers, the Janus structures of various 2D monolayers have displayed distinctive physical characteristics. By interchanging S atoms with Se atoms along one side of MoS2, the Janus monolayer MoSSe has been produced, which breaks the plane mirror symmetry and produces surprising results and fascinating properties for this material.38,39 The Janus monolayer MoSSe was discovered to be an effective photocatalyst because of its considerable optical absorption in the visible radiations, ideal band edge locations for water dissociation, and substantial carrier mobility.40 Theoretically, Hu and Wei41 claimed that the Janus Ga2SeTe, Ga2STe, and Ga2SSe monolayers have appropriate band edges to overlap the redox potentials of water. The Janus monochalcogenides M2XY single layers (M = Ga and In and X/Y = S, Se, and Te) have been inspected via first-principle simulations. The outcomes not only highlight the photocatalytic effectiveness of these monolayers but also reveal how to create Janus monolayers, which is usable to alter the electronic properties and band edge potentials of 2D photocatalysts.42 The very probable electrical, optical, mechanical, and photocatalytic behaviors of the monochalcogenides XGaInY (where X, Y = S, Se, Te) are currently being studied. The results shed light on the possible implications in optoelectronics and photocatalysis.4 Another group-V elemental 2D semiconductor created through experimental means is arsenene (Ars),43 which exhibits good stability and a honeycomb structure comparable to phosphorene. Arsenene's geometric formations have been observed in both buckled and puckered states; compared to puckered Ars, the buckled Ars is somewhat more stable.44 The buckled Ars is a possible option for the creation of heterostructures to provide efficient water splitting photocatalyst because of its good optical characteristics and indirect 2.28 eV bandgap.45,46 Ars has potential uses in blue light sensors, light emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and even flexible sensors due to its electronic structure characteristics.47
Due to excessive carrier recombination and inefficient light use in photocatalytic processes, monolayer materials face significant hurdles. Type-II vdWHs frequently improve the isolation of photogenerated holes and electrons, decreasing carrier recombination, extending carrier lifespan, and increasing the quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reactions.48,49 There has been research on various group-III Janus monochalcogenides-based and Ars-based vdWHs, such as In2SeTe/Ga2STe,50 C2N/Janus monochalcogenides,51 SeGa2Te/SeIn2Se,26 SGaInSe (SeGaInS)/PtSe2,52 InSe/Ars,53 Ars/graphene,54 PtS2/Ars,55 Ars/GaX (X = S, Se),56 InS/Ars,57 Ars/Cdo,18 and MTe2/Ars (M = Mo, W).17 The results demonstrate potential applications in photocatalysis, anode materials, electronics, optoelectronics, and photovoltaics. However, there has been no comparative investigation into the photocatalytic and thermoelectric capabilities of Ars/SGaInS vdWHs. Ars and SGaInS monolayers possess identical hexagonal lattice structures and constants. Furthermore, the reasonable experimental synthesis of heterostructures has a lattice mismatch of up to 5%. Our demonstrated Ars/SGaInS vdWHs have a lattice mismatch of 3.9%, which is suitable for the epitaxial growth of high quality heterostructures. Creating Ars/SGaInS vdWHs is expected to merge the benefits of these two monolayers and may lead to significantly better results. This work thoroughly examines the linked Ars/SGaInS vdWHs characteristics and explains how they could be used as an incredibly efficient photocatalyst for overall water splitting by means of first-principles computations. In addition, the vdWHs not only have tunable indirect type-II band alignment but have also significantly improved the optical spectra in the visible and ultraviolet range, which will facilitate the transformation and detachment of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and improve the water redox reaction to generate hydrogen on the semiconductor surface. For nanodevices, the heterostructures also show significant thermoelectric characteristics. Our results will expedite the applications of group III Janus monochalcogenides in the field of optoelectronics, photocatalysis, and thermoelectric devices.
Methodology
The plane wave Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is used throughout the present work for all density functional theory (DFT) calculations.58 The projected augmented wave approach59 and the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)60 were employed to optimize the geometry of the structure and to assess the exchange-correlation functional. We employed the HSE06 functional61 with Gamma-centered 16 × 16 × 1 k-mesh to acquire a much more meticulous electronic band structure to resolved the underestimation of the bandgap in PBE calculations. The results are based on the plane-wave model with a cutoff energy of 500 eV. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), a Gamma-centered 28 × 28 × 1 k-mesh is sampled for structural relaxation. The weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction at the interface of the heterostructures was described by the Grimme (DFT-D3) approach.62,63 A vacuum level of 25 Å was subjected along the z-direction to diminish the interaction among the periodic pictures. The convergence benchmark for the force and total energy was set to 0.01 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively, to achieve complete relaxation of all atoms in the unit cell. As used in the PHONOPY algorithm, a finite displacement approach was employed for phonon dispersion computation.64Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were used at 500 K with a total simulation time of 5 ps in 2 fs time increments, which is regulated,40 to check the thermal stability.65 Utilizing the Boltzmann semi-classical concept and constant relaxing time approach (CRTA) as a part of the BoltzTraP code, the thermoelectric characteristics (Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and electrical conductivity) are studied.66,67
Results and discussion
To explore the Ars/SGaInS vdWHs, first, we optimized the pristine SGaInS and Ars monolayers geometry. The optimized lattice constant of these monolayers are 3.76 Å and 3.61 Å, respectively. The bond lengths of Ga–In, Ga–S, In–S, and Ars–Ars are 2.65 Å, 2.40 Å, 2.51 Å, and 2.50 Å, respectively. These structural characteristics are highly comparable with the preceding findings.4,17,18 The mismatch between the lattice constants of SGaInS and Ars monolayers was estimated using the formula . The feasible experimental synthesis of heterostructures has a lattice mismatch of up to 5%. Our established Ars/SgaInS vdWHs has a lattice mismatch of 3.9%, which is appropriate for the epitaxial development of competent quality heterostructures. The interfacial characteristics are highly dependent on the local configuration and atoms in contact. For the construction of vdWHs, the Janus SGaInS has GaS- and InS-terminated surfaces with Ars monolayer. Therefore, we study the two possible models (model-I & model-II) with GaS/InS divergent planes in Ars/SGaInS vdWHs, which depicted in the ESI,† Fig. S1 in both top and side views. Here, we modeled the heterostructures with four possible stackings. In model-I, stacking-A, both Ars atoms are placed at overhead positions of S and In atoms; in stacking-B, the bottom layer Ars atom is placed on the center of the hexagon of SGaInS, whereas the top layer Ars atom is on the overhead position of the S atom. In stacking-C, the lower layer Ars atom is configured above the In atom, while the other Ars atom is configured on the hollow center position, while in stacking-D, the lower layer Ars atom is over headed on the S atom, while the other Ars atom is projected on the hollow spot of the SGaInS monolayer. Similar stacking setups are accomplished in the Ars/SGaInS vdWHs model-II, as presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). To verify the stabilities of models-I and model-II, we first compute the binding energy Eb, which is quantified using the following expression Eb = EvdWHs − ESGaInS − EArs(1)where the respective total energies of the Ars/SGaInS vdWHs, SGaInS monolayer, and Ars monolayer are EvdWHs, ESGaInS, and EArs, respectively. A low value of Eb, by definition, denotes the energy stability of the heterostructures. The stability of the heterostructures system increases as the Eb value becomes more negative. Due to the smallest Eb, the stacking-B configurations are the most stable in both models with −1.40 eV and 1.39 eV. It is quite important to highlight that the subsequent research is based on the super stable configuration (stacking-B). The phonon band spectra support the overall dynamic stability of the super stable Ars/SGaInS vdWHs (model-I and model-II) configurations. Both the model-I and model-II favorable configuration (stacking-B) have a very negligible imaginary frequency Γ point, which is in the expectable error range, demonstrating the heterostructures’ dynamic stability. In comparison, the Ars/SGaInS vdWHs have 6 atoms per unit cell, resulting in a total of 18 modes, where 3 of the modes are acoustic and 15 are optical. Fig. 1(a) and (b) provides illustrations of the phonon band spectra. The weak vdW interactions and poor interlayer coupling are specified with the lowermost optical modes that are close to the acoustic modes. The same arrangement has also been seen in an earlier study.68 The AIMD simulation with a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell was used to assess the thermal stability at 500 K. Following a 5 ps simulation period, the original structures showed negligible structural deformation and bond splitting, which is displayed in Fig. 1(c) and (d). According to the figure, Ars/SGaInS vdWHs exhibit energetic thermal stability at high temperatures because the entire potential energy average value practically stays unchanged. On the basis of binding energies, dynamic stabilities, and thermal stabilities, it is anticipated that the Ars/SGaInS vdWHs will be feasible for experimental implementation.

To investigate the electronic characteristics of Ars/SGaInS vdWHs, first, we determine the band structure of SGaInS and Ars monolayers with the PBE functional, which underestimates the bandgaps, as tabulated in Table 1. To acquire a more precise and reliable band structure of these pristine monolayers, we used the HSE06 functional. According to Fig. 2(a) and (b), the pristine monolayers have an indirect bandgap of 2.22 eV and 2.66 eV, respectively. These computed results are pretty comparable with those found in previous investigations.4,17,18

 Fig. 2  Electronic band structure of monolayers (a), (b) and their vdWHs (c), (d) using HSE06 functional. Projected band structures of vdWHs (e), (f). 
Using the HSE06 functional, the computed band structures of both models of Ars/SGaInS vdWHs are illustrated in Fig. 2(c) and (d) with indirect bandgaps of 1.53 eV and 1.86 eV, respectively. In both the models, the VBMx are positioned at the K–Γ BZ symmetry point. The CBMn of model-I is positioned at the M symmetry point of BZ, while in model-II, CBMn is slightly shifted to the right side of the M symmetry point of BZ. More profound knowledge of Ars/SGaInS vdWHs band alignment is accomplished through the exploration of projected weighted bands. According to Fig. 2(e) and (f), in both the models, the CBMn mainly occurred due to the SGaInS monolayer. In contrast, the VBMx occurred due to the main contribution of the Ars monolayer, which explores that both models are securing type-II band alignments. Such type of an alignment efficiently encourages the detachment of electrons and holes, suppressing carrier recombination and enhancing the carrier lifetime. Fig. 2(e) and (f) also explains that photogenerated electrons migrate from Ars to the SGaInS layer, while the holes travel from SGaInS to the Ars layer. Hence, the Ars/SGaInS vdWHs deserve promising attention in photovoltaic and photocatalytic water splitting applications.69,70 Moreover, the calculated density of states of Ars/SGaInS vdWHs also confirmed the type-II band alignment. For both the models, the CBMn mainly appear because of the S-p orbital with a minor contribution of the Ga-s orbital, while the VBMx clearly appears due to the Ars-p orbital, as displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The tremendous technique for changing the characteristics of 2D layered materials is strain engineering.2,71 The biaxial strain is described by ε = a − a0/a0, whereas a and a0 symbolize the strained and unstrained lattice parameters. All strains are applied under an elastic boundary that is entirely transformable. According to Fig. 3, the bandgap of vdWHs in both models monotonically decreases under compressive and tensile strain, except at 2% compressive stain. Under tensile strain, the CBMn makes a transition to the Γ symmetry point of BZ, whereas the VBMx remains at the K–Γ point.
 Fig. 3  The bandgap variations of Ars/SGaInS vdWHs with tensile (2%, 4%, 6%) strain and compressive (−2%, −4%, −6%) strain. 
In case of −2% and 4% compressive strain, the VBMx shifted to the Γ point, whereas VBMx remained the same as the unstrained system. At −6% compressive strain, both the models CBMn make a transition to the K point of BZ. All these transitions are clearly displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The projected band structure (Fig. S4, ESI†) under compressive and tensile strain shows that both models still remain type-II band alignment. More interestingly, under −8% compressive strain, the VBMx of model-I is locates above and the CBMn is below the Fermi level. The VBMx arises due to the orbitals of Ars layer, whereas the CMBn appears due to the orbitals of the SGaInS layer, as displayed in Fig. 4(b). This noticeably implies that the heterostructures contain a type-III band alignment with a broken-gap. It should be underlined that because of the presence of band-to-band tunneling, the type-III band alignment vdWHs may exhibit the clear negative differential resistance phenomenon.72 The schematic diagram is presented in Fig. 4(a) to describe the underlying principle of such a band alignment. Such vdWHs makes it feasible for electrons to tunnel straightforwardly to the CBMn of the SGaInS layer from the VBMx of the Ars layer, which effectively resists the thermal distribution and is particularly advantageous for tunnel field-effect transistors.

The charge transport phenomena over the vdWHs interface is very essential. To identify the precise situation of charge redistribution, the charge density difference (Δρ) is examined, as acquired through the following equation. Δρ = ρvdWHs − ρSGaInS − ρArs(2)where ρvdWHs, ρSGaInS, and ρArs are the charge densities of the Ars/SGaInS vdWHs, SGaInS monolayer, and Ars monolayer, respectively, which is also presented in Fig. 5(a) and (b). Charge reduction and deposition are symbolized by the yellow and cyan isosurfaces, respectively. The built-in electric field has a crucial role in examining the photocatalytic function because it can effectively improve the translocation of photogenerated charges.
 Fig. 5  The charge density difference isosurfaces of model-I (a) and model-II (b), (yellow and cyan isosurfaces show the charge buildup and exhaustion, respectively). Electrostatic potential difference through the interface of model-I (c) and model-II (d). 
According to Fig. 5(c) and (d), there is a substantial potential drop (ΔV) across the heterojunction, leading to a strong built-in electric field directed from the SGaInS layer to the Ars layer. The built-in electric field significantly accelerates the transmission of electrons from the Ars layer to the SGaInS layer. The greater work function of SGaInS (6.82 eV) compared to Ars (5.78 eV) causes electrons to move from the Ars layer to the SGaInS layer, demonstrating that Ars acts as a p-doped and SGaInS as an n-doped component. Moreover, the electrostatic potential of the Ars/SGaInS vdWHs in both models also show that electrons are moving from the Ars layer to the SGaInS layer because SGaInS has a deeper potential than Ars.
The effective mass (m*) plays an important part in electron–hole separations. On the basis of the evaluated band structures, the m* of holes and electrons are determined via parabolic fitting to VBMx and CBMn, respectively. The m* of vdWHs is calculated using the equation shown below.73,74 (3)where k and E are the wave vector, energy, and Planck's constant that correspond to the wave vector k, respectively. In comparison to earlier, As/CdO,18 gallium–chalcogenides/Ars,75 MoSSe/BSe,25 TMDCs/As,17 and silicon–monochalcogenides76 systems, the calculated m* of electron and hole of model-I and model-II of vdWHs are much smaller. This means that the photogenerated charge carriers of our predicted vdWHs have superior proficiencies to address the surface and undertake reactions to increase the photocatalytic activity. According to Table 1, the vdWHs relative ratio (R) between the electron and hole m* is more than one. The photocatalytic activity is stimulated by the larger R, which demonstrates that the photogenerated electron–hole pairs have substantial compatibility to detach. This shows how photogenerated charge carriers effectively separate electrons from the holes and have low recombination probabilities, which are essential for photocatalysis.
A successful technique for converting solar energy is the production of hydrogen using photocatalysis. The photocatalytic performance can be predicted by the relative positions of the ECBM and EVBM in relation to the water redox potential. The fundamental criterion for a photocatalyst is that the ECBM and EVBM must overlap the water redox potentials to achieve complete water splitting. Specifically stating, the ECBM must be positioned above H+/H2 (reduction potential) and that the EVBM must be positioned below H2O/O2 (oxidation potential). At pH = 0, the standard level potentials for the oxidation and reduction of water are −4.44 eV and −5.67 eV, respectively. Here, we incorporate the dipole correction77 to calculate the vacuum level difference (ΔΦ, depicted in Fig. 5(c) and (d)) at the terminated surfaces of vdWHs, which shows a significant influence on the ECBM and EVBM of the photocatalyst. Our computed band edge potentials of monolayer SGaInS and Ars are in agreement with earlier hypothetical research,4,18 which verifies the accuracy of the established theoretical approach. The Janus SGaInS ECBM is −4.46 eV with reference to the vacuum level of the InS side, which is lower than the H+/H2 (−4.44 eV), but shifted to −4.40 eV, which is related to the vacuum level of the SGa side. Due to the built-in electric field, the Janus SGaInS monolayer is an active photocatalytic material, but the monolayer is considered a very poor photocatalytic material because the EVBM is positioned very far away from the oxidation potential, and the ECBM almost touches the reduction potential of water, as displayed in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  The band edge positions of isolated monolayers and their vdWHs. The reduction potential (H+/H2) and oxidation potential (O2/H2O) denoted by dotted lines at pH = 0. 
The Ars monolayer band edge positions fulfill the criteria of water splitting. Compared to pristine monolayers, the vdWHs of both models have suitable ECBM and EVBM to do overall water splitting efficiently, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Moreover, the influence of biaxial strain on the band edge positions of the Ars/SGaInS vdWHs has been noticed. According to Fig. S5 (ESI†), at 2%, −2%, and −4% biaxial strain, the ECBM and EVBM of both models efficiently overlap the redox potentials of water. At −6% strain, model-I can reduce the water into H2 and fail to oxidize into O2, whereas it completely failed to fulfil the oxidation and reduction criteria with 4% and 6% tensile strain. But at 4% tensile strain, model-II can dissociate water into H2 and fail to oxidize H2O to O2, while the band edge positions of model-II with −6% and 6% strain are entirely unable to overlap the water redox potentials. Here, we can conclude that our predicted vdWHs could offer a meaningful direction for experimental implementation and their prospective uses in photocatalysis.
The suitable band alignment and sufficient energy gap allow the photocatalyst to capture a substantial percentage of the radiated solar energy. Materials must have specific optical characteristics to be categorized in photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices. To elaborate the optical characteristics, the imaginary portion of the dielectric function of pristine SGaInS and Ars and their vdWHs are examined, as presented in Fig. 7. The results clearly demonstrate that the SGaInS monolayer can only be harvested in the ultraviolet zone of solar radiation because of no absorption peak in the visible region, whereas the Ars monolayer has substantial absorption spikes in visible and ultraviolet zones. Compared to the pristine one, the computed results noticeably show that both models of vdWHs exhibit strong absorption spikes that capture the visible and ultraviolet zones of the solar radiations. As we are aware, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light make up approximately 52%, 43%, and 5% of the energy in solar radiation, respectively.74 This assures that these heterostructures can capture up to 50% of solar energy. In addition, biaxial strain has a considerable impact on optical absorption. As seen in Fig. S6 (ESI†), red and blue shifts are seen in both model-I and model-I with increasing tensile and compressive strain, respectively. Therefore, using biaxial stain is an efficient method to achieve programmable tweaking of the optical characteristics of Ars/SGaInS (model-I and model-II) vdWHs.

To estimate the thermoelectric properties of the As/SGaInS vdWHs, the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory within the constant relaxation time approximation, as implemented in the BoltzTraP code, was used. Using this package and based on the electronic structure, the Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (σ), electronic thermal conductivity (κ), and power factor (PF) are all calculated. The obtained results are given with respect to the relaxation time, and it depends on the material properties. However, in this study, the relaxation time is fixed to 10 fs (τ = 10−14 s), as shown by many studies.78,79 Here, the thermoelectric properties of pristine monolayers are also calculated, as presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†), which clearly indicates that the designed heterostructures’ thermoelectric properties are better regarding their monolayers. At various temperatures, Fig. 8(a) and (b) displays the Seebeck coefficient of model-I and model-II with respect to the chemical potential. The negative and positive results suggest the p-type and n-type doping in the system, respectively.

Every term of the thermoelectric properties significantly improved the features in p-type and n-type. According to Fig. 8(a) and (b), the intense and larger peaks of the Seebeck coefficient are seen around the Fermi level of both the p-type and n-type doping sides at 300 K, and are hindered at greater temperatures, suggesting an ideal carrier concentration, which is advantageous for improving the thermoelectric efficiency. The highest values of the Seebeck coefficient for the model-I with p-type doping was determined to be 1517 μV K−1 and for the model-II with n-type doping was 1936 μV K−1 at ambient temperature.
The Seebeck coefficient for excellent thermoelectric devices is often superior to 200 μV K−1.80,81 An exceptional improvement can be credited to the quantum confinement phenomena, which encourages sharp DOS spikes and flat energy bands near the Fermi energy, as depicted in Fig. S2, ESI† and Fig. 2, respectively. Because of the similar symmetry of the valence and conduction bands, the computed Seebeck coefficient for p-type and n-type doping is practically identical (see Fig. 2). In Fig. 8(c), (d), the electrical conductivity is shown with respect to the chemical potential. The gradual reduction in the electrical conductivity in p-type and n-type doping is correlated with an increase in the Seebeck coefficient. As the doping concentration increases, the electrical conductivity also increases. It is evident from Fig. 8(c), (d) that electrical conductivity is insensitive to temperature changes. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows how the electronic thermal conductivity varies in relation to the chemical potential. The electronic thermal conductivity exhibits greater temperature sensitivity. On the other hand, it demonstrates that in n-type doping, the values of PF are comparatively higher. A larger power factor that is essential for effective thermoelectric behavior is produced by the interaction between an electrical conductivity that is sufficiently large (at higher μ) and a strong peak in the Seebeck coefficient close to the Fermi energy (at smaller μ), as displayed in Fig. 8(e) and (f). Here, the PF for model-I and model-II is shown with respect to the chemical potential at 300 K, 500 K, and 700 K. At higher temperatures, the PF also exhibits larger values for n-type doping in comparison to p-type doping, and it rises as the doping level rises. Interestingly, model-I and model-II Ars/SGaInS estimated power factors at 300 K, 500 K, and 700 K, which exhibited noticeably higher values than other examined low-dimensional materials,82 indicating their possible use in thermoelectric devices.
Conclusion
In short, using first-principles computation, we anticipated a type-II Ars/SGaInS vdWHs for promising electronic, optical, photocatalytic, and thermoelectric properties. Model-I and model-II of Ars/SGaInS vdWHs could have great attention in experimental implementation due to their confirmation of energetic, dynamic, and thermal stabilities. Both models are semiconductors that retain type-II band alignment and have indirect bandgaps of 1.53 eV and 1.86 eV, respectively. The alignment of the type-II band potentially boosts electron and hole isolation, suppressing carrier recombination and enhancing the carrier lifetime. The built-in electric field is produced due to the large ΔV across the interface, which significantly speeds up electron transmission from the Ars layer to the SGaInS layer. In both models of vdWHs, the m* of the electron and hole are notably smaller. This indicates that the photogenerated charge carriers are more competent at addressing surfaces and carrying out reactions to boost the photocatalytic activity. Compared to their isolated monolayers, both models have appropriate band edge positions to carry out overall water splitting efficiently. More interestingly, model-I successfully achieves type-III band alignment at −8% compressive strain, which is particularly beneficial for field-effect transistors. Our proposed vdWHs improved the absorption spectra in the visible and ultraviolet zones of the irradiating energy. Red-blue shifts have also been spotted in both model-I and model-I with tensile and compressive strain, respectively. Moreover, the vital power factor is obtained due to high Seebeck coefficients and significant electrical conductivities, especially at 700 K. According to our results, we predict that Ars/SGaInS vdWHs can perform better in the fields of optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and tunneling field-effect transistors.
