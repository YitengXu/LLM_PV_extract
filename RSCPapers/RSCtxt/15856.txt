    , Accepted 25th June 2018First published on 27th June 2018AbstractControl over charge carrier transport in a low-temperature processed device is of key significance to realize high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and tandem solar cells. For low-temperature processed perovskite devices, a great challenge still remains due to the commonly inferior crystallinity and poor electron mobility of low-temperature processed electron transport materials. Meanwhile, electron transport layers (ETLs) produced at low-temperature show poor capability of managing the quality of overlying perovskite films, leaving abundant defects at grain boundaries, which hinder the efficient charge carrier transport or even result in severe energy loss by trap-assisted recombination. Here we present highly efficient PSCs realized by employing a tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) modified SnO2 ETL prepared at low-temperature (100–150 °C). TMAH modified SnO2 significantly enhances not only the conductivity of the SnO2 ETL for efficient electron extraction but also the electronic properties of the overlying perovskite film for fast electron transport across the grain boundaries. With this proposed novel ETL, an average efficiency above 20% is achieved for the low-temperature-processed PSCs, with an even higher efficiency exceeding 21% for the champion device. These low-temperature processed PSC devices also show reliable reproducibility and stability.
1. Introduction
Organometal trihalide perovskite materials have evoked colossal interests due to their superior optoelectronic properties including tunable direct band gaps,1,2 large absorption coefficients,3 high ambipolar mobilities,4 long diffusion lengths5 and excellent defect tolerance.6 Benefiting from these advanced properties, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved tremendous progress, and highly efficient PSCs have been fabricated by device structure optimization,7–10 controlling perovskite crystal growth11 and dedicated interface engineering.12,13 Among different device structures, thin film planar heterojunction PSCs have been actively pursued due to their relatively simple device fabrication process. In a typical planar device, the perovskite layer is sandwiched between the hole and electron transport layers (HTL and ETL, respectively).14 The ETL and HTL are responsible for extracting photo-generated electrons and holes from an excited perovskite absorber at the corresponding interfaces and then transporting them through each layer to the outside circuit. Because the device will inevitably require an optimized carrier transport pathway that leverages all of the device layers and the associated interfaces,13 an ETL with high electron mobility and a proper band edge position is especially preferred and intensively studied. Although the pioneered TiO2 is the most widely used ETL material for PSCs, its relative low mobility (0.1–1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and high processing temperature make it not an ideal material for the commercialization of PSC technology. Therefore, wide bandgap semiconductors, such as ZnO,15 SnO2,16 and In2O3 (ref. 17) have been investigated as potential alternatives to TiO2. Among them, SnO2 has attracted tremendous attention as a promising and effective ETL material for high performance PSCs because of its excellent chemical stability and high electron mobility (100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1), suggesting faster transport of electrons to the transparent electrode. Moreover, SnO2 has a large band gap of 3.6–3.8 eV,18 while its conduction band edge is in good alignment with the LUMO of the perovskite absorber.19
Recently, both spin coating16,20 and atomic layer deposition (ALD) methods21 have been applied to deposit high quality SnO2 ETLs for PSCs. Even with relatively low-temperature (∼180 °C) solution processed SnO2 nanoparticle thin films as ETLs,22 PSCs show an efficiency of over 20%. It should be noted that, for overall optimized device performance, post thermal treatment with a temperature as high as 200 °C is still necessary in these studies, which is still too high to be well compatible with the roll-to-roll manufacturing of perovskite devices and detrimental to most flexible plastic substrates where a working temperature below 150 °C is required.23 A higher annealing temperature of up to 450 °C can greatly enhance the crystallinity (and thus the conductivity) of SnO2 thin films and further improve device performance.24,25 However, the performance of perovskite devices incorporating solely low-temperature solution processed SnO2 nanocrystals as ETLs is far from satisfactory, which can be explained by the large density of surface traps of the as-synthesized nanocrystals with low conductivity.25 On the other hand, despite the high defect tolerance of perovskite materials, perovskite grain boundaries are prone to having a large number of interface states or defects (mainly under-coordinated Pb and I ions), due to the low thermal stability of the polycrystalline perovskite.26 These states or defects will act as charge-trapping or carrier recombination centers, triggering a higher recombination rate at the boundaries for energy loss or inducing a reversed electric field across grain boundaries. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to preparing perovskite films with large grains27,28 or passivated boundaries.26 In-situ- or post-treatment of perovskite boundaries by the introduction of additives, such as PbI2,1,2 PCBM,26 Lewis bases,29 guanidinium,30 ionic liquids31–33 or iodide ions,34 has been exploited to passivate these defects and enhance device performance. Nevertheless, the improvement of the efficiency is not always satisfactory, because these treatments were usually aimed at exerting effects on the perovskite layer alone, instead of other layers and interfaces.
In this work, we develop a simple strategy which is able to improve the electronic properties of SnO2 ETLs and simultaneously passivate perovskite grain boundary defects. Intrigued by the advantages that tetraalkylammonium ions can serve as effective ligands to fabricate ultra-fine SnO2 nanoparticles in solution for obtaining ultra-smooth SnO2 thin films,35 we report here an innovative method to fabricate efficient planar PSCs by introducing the ionic liquid tetramethylammonium hydroxide N(CH3)4OH (TMAH) into SnO2 nanoparticle suspension for low-temperature processed ETLs. As is expected, PSCs with the TMAH-incorporated SnO2 ETL yield an efficiency as high as 20.52%, with a stabilized output efficiency of up to 19.62% as well as outstanding device stability. We attribute this high performance to the dual effects of TMAH: (1) improving the conductivity of the TMAH-SnO2 ETL for enhanced charge extraction from the perovskite absorber and improved electron transport/transfer from the perovskite to the conductive electrode; and (2) enhancing charge transport at perovskite grain boundaries. Benefiting from the solution process, TMAH can also provide both the cationic [N(CH3)4+] and anionic (OH−) capping agents for defect passivation at the perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries. The developed technology for simultaneous modification of the ETL and perovskite layer using ionic liquids in the present work will pave a new way for further efficiency improvement of PSCs.
2. Results and discussion
SnO2 nanoparticles (n-SnO2, used without further modification) were prepared by a reduction–oxidation method.35 For the preparation of TMAH-modified SnO2 (TMAH-SnO2), the TMAH solution was directly added to the n-SnO2 nanoparticle aqueous solution. Fig. 1a shows the high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) image of TMAH-SnO2 with an average size of about 5 nm. The interplanar spacing of the SnO2 particles is ≈0.333 nm, which can be attributed to the d-spacing of the (110) crystal plane. The clear lattice fringe also indicates the excellent crystallinity of the TMAH-SnO2 nanoparticles. Additionally, it can be found that the unmodified fresh n-SnO2 shows severe aggregation, whilst the TMAH-SnO2 appears as individual particles even after the colloidal solution was stored for 12 h, owing to the presence of TMAH ligands (Fig. S1, ESI†). The TMAH-SnO2 dispersion remains stable without any observable precipitation for at least 12 h whilst the pristine n-SnO2 colloid precipitates completely in 2 h (Fig. S2†). The stable dispersion of TMAH-SnO2 enables the deposition of compact SnO2 thin films via spin coating. Fig. 1b displays the XRD patterns of n-SnO2 and TMAH-SnO2 deposited on soda lime glass, where the weak and broad peaks located at 26.5°, 33.7° and 51.8° can be indexed to the (110), (101) and (211) planes, respectively. The characteristics of the broad peaks arise from the nano-size effect of SnO2. Furthermore, the existence of TMAH can be confirmed by Raman measurements (Fig. S3†).

Fig. 1c shows the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) cutoff edge for n-SnO2, TMAH-SnO2 and the perovskite. Based on the UPS spectra, the conduction band edge of n-SnO2, TMAH-SnO2 and LUMO of the perovskite is determined to be −4.31 eV, −4.21 eV, and −4.37 eV, respectively. Fig. 1d illustrates the corresponding energy level diagram determined from the UPS spectra. It is clear that the conduction band edge of n-SnO2 is level with the LUMO of the perovskite. In contrast, the conduction band edge of TMAH-SnO2 is about 0.16 eV higher than the LUMO of the perovskite. Minemoto and co-authors' study theoretically proved that an ETL with a 0.0–0.3 eV higher conduction band position relative to the perovskite absorber will not impede the electron injection from the excited absorber into the ETL but restrain the interface recombination, leading to more efficient perovskite solar cells.36 This strategy was adopted and experimentally confirmed by Kapil et al. on the C60 ETL and by Meng et al. on the ZnO ETL to improve the performance of PSCs.37,38
The TMAH-SnO2 films were deposited on FTO substrates by spin coating its colloidal nanoparticle dispersion. Planar PSCs were fabricated in the configuration of Glass/FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The TMAH concentration, annealing temperature and ETL thickness were optimized for the designed PSCs to achieve the best performance (Fig. S4†), where these parameters can strongly influence the electrical properties of the ETL. For comparison, devices using n-SnO2 as the ETL were also fabricated. As displayed in Fig. S5,† the improved light transmission of the TMAH-SnO2 coated substrate to bare FTO glass substrates is consistent with a previous study.39 As shown in Fig. 2a, the perovskite film deposited on the TMAH-SnO2 ETL is compact without any observable pinhole. Fig. 2b illustrates the cross-section SEM image of a PSC device, indicating that the perovskite layer on TMAH-SnO2 is compactly composed of two or three grains, perpendicular to the FTO surface, in a typical size of 300 nm. The thickness of SnO2 and spiro-OMeTAD is about 10 nm and 100 nm, respectively. To enhance light absorption, we deposited a thick perovskite layer of about 600 nm by slightly reducing the spin-coating speed. Although the perovskite layer in our study is much thicker than a conventional absorber (∼ 350 nm), the devices still have a high fill factor and large short-circuit current density, which is due to the superior electronic properties of the obtained perovskite absorber. Fig. 2c displays the J–V curves of n-SnO2 and TMAH-SnO2 based devices, and the typical photovoltaic-parameters of PSCs built on different ETLs are listed in Table 1. It can be learned that the device based on n-SnO2 shows a fill factor (FF) of about 70.43%, and the efficiency is determined to be 18.14% under 100 mW cm−2 of 1.5 AM illumination. Notably, the typical device based on TMAH-SnO2 achieved an efficiency of 20.28%, with the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and FF being 1.141 eV, 22.51 mA cm−2 and 79%, respectively (Fig. 2c). The current density from the IPCE is calculated to be 21.66 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2d), which is in agreement with the Jsc obtained from the J–V curve. It could be observed that the IPCE is very high in the range from 350 nm to 750 nm, indicating thorough light absorption and photoelectric conversion of the device. Notably, IPCE spectra have a steep onset at the long wavelength side, indicating efficient carrier transport throughout the device before recombination. A comparison of the photovoltaic characteristics reveals that the remarkably increased FF mainly dominates the improved efficiency of the TMAH-SnO2 cells, while the Voc and Jsc are almost similar for the devices based on both the TMAH-SnO2 and n-SnO2 ETLs.

As shown in Table 1, the series resistance (Rs) of the TMAH-SnO2 device is 33 Ω which is much lower than 66 Ω for the n-SnO2 based cells, corresponding to the enhanced FF of the PSC with the TMAH-SnO2 ETL. What is more, we also fabricated PSCs using the SnO2-nanoparticle (Alfa Aesar) ETL at 150 °C. These devices have a similar low Rs to TMAH-SnO2 PSCs, but a low FF of about 67.71% leads to an efficiency of only 17.01%. If the annealing temperature for SnO2 increases to about 230 °C, a higher efficiency of up to 20% can be achieved, indicating that a higher temperature annealing process is necessary for achieving efficient devices based on Alfa-SnO2. By replacing the FTO/glass substrate with the ITO/glass (10 Ω □−1) substrate with higher transparency in the visible–ultraviolet range (Fig. S5†), the efficiency can be further boosted to 21.05% by improving the Jsc from 22.51 mA cm−2 to 23.31 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3). Therefore, our method is concluded to be very competitive for low-temperature-processed photovoltaics.

At this stage, the most rational reason for the high FF and high device performance of the TMAH-SnO2 based PSCs can probably be ascribed to the enhanced conductivity (lower Rs) of both the ETL and perovskite films. To prove this, we recorded the contact current mapping and I–V curves by c-AFM measurements (as shown in Fig. 4 and 5). While the I–V curve clearly shows ohmic contact between the FTO substrate and AFM tip (Fig. S6†), both the TMHA-SnO2 and n-SnO2 films exhibit Schottky contact with both the FTO electrode and AFM tip (Fig. 4c and f), also confirming that the FTO substrate is well covered by compact semi-conducting SnO2 nanoparticle films. The contact current is about 50 nA and 0.5 nA for the TMAH-SnO2 and SnO2 ETLs at a bias voltage of 1 V, respectively, demonstrating the significantly enhanced conductivity of the TMAH-SnO2 layer. This improved conductivity could also be confirmed by the lower Rs of the devices and Hall measurements (Table S1†). It is believed that the high conductivity of TMAH-SnO2 finally leads to the dramatically enhanced device performance by improving the FF. The low conductivity of low-temperature solution processed SnO2 nanoparticle films has been widely reported,25 which generally results from the weak crystallinity24 and the large density of surface defects.40 The effects of TMAH inclusion on the conductivity of SnO2 could be attributed to: (1) the improved uniformity of the films (reduced roughness seen in Fig. 4), since tetraalkylammonium ions can serve as effective ligands to fabricate ultra-fine SnO2 nanoparticles in solution for depositing ultra-smooth SnO2 thin films.35 (2) N(CH3)4+ can serve as a capping agent for oxygen vacancy passivation at the nanoparticle surface.41,42

(c and f) Current curves traced from (b) and (e) for different positions of perovskite layers. The grain boundaries of the perovskite on TMAH-SnO2 display impressively high conductivity. 
Benefiting from the all-solution process, TMAH is also found to play a crucial role in modifying the morphology and electronic behavior of perovskite films. As indicated by the surface SEM images (Fig. S7†), the perovskite grain size depends on the concentration of TMAH in the TMAH-SnO2 precursors. We propose that TMAH may increase the hydrophilicity of SnO2, and this higher hydrophilicity leads to smaller perovskite grains, as revealed in a reported study.43 Generally, a smaller grain size results in more grain boundaries, which may be a disadvantage to charge transport in the perovskite layer. However, the TMAH-SnO2 based devices perform even better with increased grain boundaries (Fig. S4b†). From the c-AFM results shown in Fig. 5, it is found that the grain boundaries of the perovskite layer on TMAH-SnO2 are more electronically conductive. As mentioned above, it is common sense that defect density is higher at the boundaries than in the bulk for the perovskite, and carrier transport would be hindered or even stopped in this zone via defect-assisted recombination. Therefore, the conductivity is commonly lower at the boundaries. The perovskite layer on n-SnO2 (Fig. 5a–c) remained in line with this trend, while the conductivity at the grain boundaries, for the perovskite film deposited on TMAH-SnO2, is found to be even higher than that in the perovskite grains.
To further elucidate the underlying mechanism behind the c-AFM observations, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved-photoluminescence (TR-PL) measurements44 were performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The peak intensity of the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite on TMAH-treated glass (TMAH-perovskite) is 20% higher than the reference (pure) perovskite. The higher PL intensity indicates that the defects in the TMAH-perovskite are much less than those in the reference perovskite. It is also clear that the TMAH-perovskite has a longer decay time than the perovskite, which is in agreement with the steady state PL results. The longer decay time probably indicates the effective passivation of defects in the perovskite by TMAH. Recently, Huang et al. proposed an effective defect passivation approach in PSCs using quaternary ammonium halides with a structure of NR4+X−, where R is an alkyl or an aryl group and X is halide.45 Quaternary ammonium and halide ions can efficiently passivate charged defects, either positively or negatively in the perovskite. Since TMAH has a similar NR4+X− structure, it is reasonable to propose that the defects at the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite can be passivated efficiently, and then the recombination or the trapping process at the grain boundaries can be alleviated. The electronic passivation approach can also be understood by the fact that the ionic defects (such as I−, Pb2+, and methylammonium vacancies) in the polycrystalline film have a small migration activation energy (<0.1 eV),46 and TMAH ions are easy to move into perovskite layers during the solution and the subsequent annealing process. It should be emphasized here that the concentration of TMAH must be controlled carefully. Actually, excess N(CH3)4+ ions will provide additional electron trapping centers in the ETL and/or behave as a new type of defect in the devices. That's why treatment with a large concentration of TMAH decreased the performance of PSCs (Fig. S4b†). When the perovskite film comes into contact with TMAH-SnO2 or n-SnO2, the intensity of PL is strongly quenched, an indication of the efficient electron transfer from the perovskite to the ETL. Furthermore, the comparison of the TR-PL spectra of perovskite/n-SnO2 and perovskite/TMAH-SnO2 confirms that electrons transfer faster from the perovskite to TMAH-SnO2 than to n-SnO2.

Hysteresis is one of the most concerning issues in planar PSCs, which may be due to ion migration inside the perovskite layer,47 the defect-related trap–detrap process at the grain boundaries48 or carrier accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface.12 In our devices, we also observe just a small hysteresis in the J–V curves shown in Fig. 7a. The efficiency determined from the reverse and forward scan is 20.52% and 19.32%, respectively. Furthermore, the stabilized power output (photocurrent densities vs. time) and I–t curve, as shown in Fig. 7b at a bias of the Vm (maximum power point = 0.97 V), showed that the current density quickly reaches saturation, and the current density is similar to the Jsc extracted from the J–V curves. The stabilized PCE from the I–t curve is determined to be 19.62%, which is in agreement with the value of the reverse scan, only 0.9% lower than 20.52% determined from the J–V curves (Fig. 7a). Therefore, the hysteresis is very small, and the PCE determined from the J–V curve of the reverse scan direction is reliable. Moreover, the J–V curves also show little hysteresis at different scan rates varying from 0.01v/s to 0.04 V s−1 (Fig. 7c), and the efficiency also remains unchanged under continuous scan (Fig. 7d). Further studies should be carried out to thoroughly eliminate the hysteresis under different scan directions for our samples.

To check the performance reproducibility of the device prepared using the proposed technique, 16 pieces of devices were fabricated, and the statistics of their performance parameters was carried out. The distribution of the photovoltaic parameters shown in Fig. 8 proves that our results are reliable and reproducible. The device stability test was also conducted on encapsulated cells sealed with resin. It was found that the TMAH-SnO2 based devices demonstrate similar high stability to the n-SnO2 based cells, maintaining 97% of their initial efficiency after 360 h (Fig. S8†). This result indicates that the inclusion of TMAH will not affect the stability of the devices. The devices degraded after a longer storage span, probably due to the unstable Spiro and corrosive additives like TBP or lithium salt.49 Finally, we also fabricated a flexible device on the ITO/PEN substrate in the configuration of PEN/ITO/TMAH-SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, and the resulting plastic solar cell yields an efficiency of 15.07% in the first try (Fig. S9†). However, the fabricated plastic devices with the n-SnO2 ETL did not work, indicating the superior properties of the TMAH-SnO2 thin films as electron conductive layers in low-temperature-processed electronic devices.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, in this work dual-functional TMAH-SnO2 thin films were developed as ETLs for highly efficient perovskite solar cells prepared at low temperature. Remarkably enhanced conductivity can be realized in TMAH modified SnO2 ETLs, which is much higher than those of the control samples without TMAH inclusion. Meanwhile, charged defects at the perovskite grain boundaries can be effectively passivated by the existence of TMAH in the ETL. TMAH improves charge transport between the perovskite and the ETL. As a result, a highly reproducible and stable device with an efficiency exceeding 21% has been achieved, which is impressive for low-temperature processed planar PSCs. The technology presented here will be helpful for development of highly efficient PSCs at low-temperature.

Preparation and modification of SnO2 nanoparticles
SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized according to a previous report.35 Briefly, 0.242 g SnCl4·5H2O was first dissolved in 50 mL DI water (18 MΩ) under stirring for 5 min, which was denoted as solution A. Simultaneously, 0.05 g NaBH4 was dissolved in 20 mL DI water and denoted as solution B. Then solution B was added drop-wise to solution A. The obtained mixture underwent severe stirring at room temperature for about 2 h. During the reaction, the color of the solution turned from grey to white, suggesting the formation of SnO2 nanoparticles. As the reaction finished, the nanoparticles were collected by centrifuging and washed with DI water. The centrifuging and washing processes were repeated 3 times. The collected nanoparticles were diluted to be around 4 mg mL−1 in water to complete the preparation of the n-SnO2 colloidal solution. For the TMAH-modified SnO2 (TMAH-SnO2) colloidal solution, various volumes of TMAH solution (TMAH, 10 wt% in water) were added to the obtained n-SnO2 colloidal solution and stirred for 5 min at room temperature. The added TMAH was varied from 0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% to 2% in volume ratio (TMAH solution: n-SnO2 solution).
Preparation of perovskite solar cells
An FTO/ITO glass sheet was sequentially cleaned with detergent (Micro-90, 2% in water), acetone, ethanol and DI water for 30 min. Before deposition of SnO2 thin films, the cleaned FTO was treated with ozone plasma for 15 min. The SnO2 thin films were spin-coated onto the FTO at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and the obtained electrodes were annealed at various temperatures (100 °C, 125 °C, 150 °C, and 175 °C) for 30 min. Then the thin films were cooled down to room temperature naturally. Perovskite layers were deposited onto the SnO2-coated FTO directly by spin coating the precursor using the anti-solvent process. The perovskite precursor solution was first prepared by mixing FAI, MAI, PbI2 and PbBr2 in DMF and DMSO (1.25 M with respect to Pb, DMF:DMSO = 4:1). 1% KI doping (K:Pb atom ratio in solution) is achieved by adding KI solution in DMF to the perovskite precursor solution (0.1 M). The stoichiometric composition of the precursor is FA0.75MA0.25PbI2.5Br0.5. Before spin coating, the precursor was filtered with a 0.2 μm syringe filter. The perovskite precursor was first spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s, and the spin rate was increased to 3000 rpm for another 30 s. During the second step of spin coating, CB was poured onto the substrate. After spin coating, the electrode was moved to a hot plate at 100 °C for 60 min, in order to remove the solvent and for the perovskite crystal growth. The spiro-OMeTAD (80 mg mL−1 in CB) solution with LTFSI (9.1 μg mL−1) and 4-TBP (28.5 μL mL−1) was then deposited onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm-thick gold electrode was deposited using a thermal evaporator at a rate of 0.1 nm s−1. The active area of the device was determined to be 0.09 cm2 using the mask on the top of the substrate during thermal evaporation.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken with a field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM, JEM-2100F) operating at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The morphologies of the SnO2 layer and the perovskite layer were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI). The conductivity of the thin films was studied by using a conductive atomic force microscope (c-AFM, Bruker) in TUNA mode. The steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films were measured using a 1/4 m monochromator (Cornerstone™ 260) equipped with a silicon charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. A continuous wave laser (405 nm, 50 mW) was used as the excitation source, and luminescence was detected using the CCD. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi, with the HeI (21.22 eV) emission line employed for excitation. The data were acquired at a bias of −10 V. The work function of the measured samples can be calculated from the following equation: hν = EFermi − Ecutoff, here, hν = 21.22 eV and EFermi = 21.08 eV (using Ni as the standard sample for calibration). The J–V measurements were carried out in ambient air with a Keithley-2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2, Oriel Sol1A Class ABB Solar Simulator). The light intensity was calibrated with a silicon reference cell (NREL) equipped with a power meter. The devices are measured in the reverse scan (1.2 V to −0.20 V, 0.01 V per step). For hysteresis studies, forward scans (−0.2 V to 1.2 V, 0.01 V per step) were also taken. The delay time has been selected from 1 ms to 1000 ms. IPCE measurements were carried out using an Enli Tech (Taiwan) EQE measurement system.
