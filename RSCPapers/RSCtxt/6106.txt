    , Accepted 29th July 2017First published on 7th August 2017AbstractWe present a comprehensive steady-state and time-resolved UV-Vis-NIR absorption and fluorescence study of the hole-transport material H101 to characterise its photophysics in different organic solvents and on mesoporous Al2O3 and TiO2 thin films. Photoexcitation of H101 at 400 nm in organic solvents populates the S1 state which shows intramolecular relaxation on a picosecond time scale. Branching from the relaxed S1 state leads to population of the T1 triplet state and the ground electronic state S0. Triplet formation is induced by the internal heavy-atom effect of the sulphur atom, and the triplet yield decreases substantially with solvent polarity. On mesoporous Al2O3, intermolecular exciton-splitting is observed leading to the formation of a radical cation – radical anion pair (H101(S1) + H101(S0) → H101˙+ + H101˙−) followed by exciton recombination. On mesoporous TiO2, efficient electron injection is observed in addition to exciton-splitting. Complementary spectroelectrochemistry experiments enable a full spectral characterisation of the cation species H101˙+ and H1012+. Extensive DFT/TDDFT calculations successfully assign the spectral features of all experimentally observed species. Implications for the function of H101 in photovoltaic devices are discussed.
1. Introduction
Triarylamines (TAAs) exhibit tunable electron-donor properties and have therefore become important building blocks in donor–acceptor dyes and hole-transport materials (HTMs) for efficient dye-sensitised and perovskite thin film solar cells.1–4 Characterising the photoinduced electronic relaxation pathways of such systems using time-resolved optical detection techniques, such as ultrafast broadband transient absorption spectroscopy, is therefore required to understand e.g. their involvement in the electron injection process of solar cell dyes.5–11 Even in the case of HTMs, where the primary functions are accepting the hole of the oxidised photoactive dye or perovskite species and subsequent transport of the positive charge by hole hopping to the back electrode, knowledge of the competing photoinduced pathways is of considerable interest: for instance, the photoexcited HTM may contribute to the photocurrent of a solar cell by injecting electrons into TiO212 or via a FRET mechanism, thereby increasing the efficiency through panchromatic light-harvesting.13
Most of the solar cell devices used so far have employed spiro-MeOTAD as HTM.2 It exhibits a strong absorption band peaking at 390 nm and thus does not interfere with dye or perovskite absorption in the visible range. Recently the quest for alternative HTMs replacing the expensive spiro-MeOTAD has led to the development of various HTMs, including small TAA-based systems, with hitherto largely unexplored photophysical and charge transfer properties.2 An example is “H101” (Fig. 1), consisting of two methoxy-substituted TAAs bridged by an EDOT (3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) unit. H101 and related systems exhibit good power conversion efficiencies in thin-film solar cells, are easier to synthesise and more cost-effective than spiro-MeOTAD.14,15

We present in this work a study of the excited-state dynamics of H101 in organic solvents and on mesoporous Al2O3 and TiO2 thin films using steady-state absorption/fluorescence and ultrafast pump – supercontinuum probe (PSCP) transient absorption spectroscopy complemented by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). The experimental findings are supported by extended DFT/TDDFT calculations to better understand the electronic structure of the neutral, cation and anion species of this HTM. Our investigations should be helpful for obtaining a better understanding of the photoinduced charge-transfer processes of such small-molecule HTMs on thin films and eventually in dye-sensitised and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation and characterisation
H101 (purity >98%) was purchased from Dyesol. n-Hexane (Merck, Uvasol, >98.5%), THF (Merck, Uvasol, >99.9%), ethanol (Merck, LiChrosolv, >99.9%), chlorobenzene (Merck, for synthesis, >99%), acetone (Fisher, analytical reagent grade, >99.98%), acetonitrile (Fisher, HPLC gradient grade, >99.99%), 2-propanol (Fisher, >99.97%), methanol (Fisher, HPLC grade, >99.99%) and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Sigma Aldrich/Fluka, for electrochemical analysis, >99.8%) were used as received.
Thoroughly cleaned and dried microscope glass slides were employed as substrates for preparing mesoporous layers of TiO2 and Al2O3. Mesoporous TiO2 layers with a thickness of about 2 μm were obtained by doctor blading and sintering (450 °C) a commercial nanoparticle paste (Dyesol, DSL 90T) diluted with 2-propanol. For the preparation of the mesoporous Al2O3 layers, 0.4 g poly(ethylene glycol) (Sigma Aldrich, Bio Ultra 20000) was slowly dissolved in 5 g of an aqueous colloidal Al2O3 nanoparticle suspension (Nyacol AL20). Five drops of a 1 M tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution (Sigma Aldrich) in methanol were added to this suspension under stirring. This paste was diluted by a certain amount of methanol to control the thickness of the final Al2O3 layer. For instance, a dilution factor of 1.5 provides a ca. 6 μm thick mesoporous Al2O3 thin film. Homogeneous HTM layers on top of the films were prepared by spin-coating 100 μL of a 3 mM solution of H101 in chlorobenzene for 4 s at 500 rpm and 30 s at 2000 rpm after 28 s loading time. The sample was dried for 15 min at 80 °C on a hotplate under nitrogen atmosphere. It should be kept in mind that H101 does not have a COOH group and therefore does not chemically bind to the mesoporous thin film, in contrast to a typical solar cell dye. H101 merely infiltrates the pores, and the H101 interface layer is then, in the ideal case, in van der Waals contact with the surface atoms of the mesoporous oxide scaffold.
2.2 Steady-state spectra
Steady-state absorption spectra over the spectral range 200–2000 nm were measured using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on an Agilent Cary Eclipse spectrometer. All of these experiments were performed at T = 296 K, and the sample solutions were bubbled with nitrogen prior to the measurements. Spectroelectrochemistry of H101 in acetonitrile containing tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (100 mM) was performed as described previously.5,6,8
2.3 PSCP spectroscopy
Femtosecond pump–probe broadband transient absorption spectra were recorded using two PSCP setups covering the UV-Vis and NIR regions (260–700 and 850–1600 nm, respectively). Detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and working principle can be found elsewhere.6,8,16–24
For the measurements in organic solvents, 10–15 mL of a nitrogen-saturated H101 solution was passed through a flow cell (path length 1 mm, window thickness 200 μm), so that the sample volume was exchanged after each pump–probe cycle. Solutions with an OD of 0.2 (at 400 nm, 1 mm path length) were employed, and the initial concentration of H101 was in the range 36–46 μM. For thin film experiments, the samples were mounted inside a home-built aluminium gas flow cell7 and constantly purged by nitrogen (Messer, purity 4.6). A fast piezo x/y translation stage was employed to move the sample, so that each laser shot was hitting a fresh spot. H101 was excited by 400 nm pulses from the glass side at every second shot of the 920 Hz laser system. Typical laser pump pulse fluences were in the range 100–150 μJ cm−2 for experiments in organic solvents and 20–70 μJ cm−2 for thin film experiments, as determined by a combination of a CCD camera and a calibrated photodiode detector. The relative polarisation of the 400 nm pump and supercontinuum probe pulses was set at the magic angle (54.7°). Chirp-correction was performed using the coherent response of the pure organic solvents or of a TiO2/glass sample (cross-correlation and time-zero accuracy ca. 80 and 10 fs, respectively).
2.4 Global kinetic analysis of transient absorption data
PSCP data sets were analysed by the global kinetic modelling approach described previously5,6,20,22,25 using the kinetic scheme discussed in Section 3.5. Gaussian functions were employed to parametrise the species-associated spectra of the different electronic species. During the optimisation procedure, which also considered the experimental time resolution, the parameters of the Gaussian functions as well as the lifetimes of the different electronic species were varied.
2.5 TCSPC experiments
Fluorescence decay curves of H101 in different organic solvents were recorded at room temperature on a Horiba Jobin-Yvon TemPro TCSPC setup (time calibration 55 ps per channel, software: DataStation 2.5, DAS6.4) which was kindly provided by K.-H. Drexhage and J. Arden-Jacob (ATTO-TEC GmbH, Siegen).26 The samples were excited at 368 nm (Horiba Jobin-Yvon NanoLED-370, FWHM 1.2 ns, repetition frequency 1 MHz). Deconvolution was performed employing an instrument response function (IRF) obtained from a Ludox AS-40 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in water, leading to pure monoexponential decays over at least three orders of magnitude. In all cases, the integral fluorescence was collected at magic angle. The estimated accuracy of the lifetimes is ca. 50 ps.
2.6 DFT/TDDFT calculations
Calculations for H101 were performed as described previously5,6 using the program package Q-Chem 4.4.27 Briefly, the structure of the neutral S0, S1 and T1 states of H101, the H101˙+ radical cation and the H101˙− radical anion were optimised using the “MPW133.9PW91” functional as described previously.5 Transition energies were determined for all species. Calculations were carried out for vacuum conditions and in acetonitrile (C-PCM model). The transition density matrix analysis was performed using the TheoDORE package28 and the resulting densities drawn using Jmol.29
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra of H101 in organic solvents
Steady-state absorption spectra of neutral H101 in the region of the S0 → S1 absorption band near 400 nm and the corresponding steady-state fluorescence spectra are compared in Fig. 2(A) in six organic solvents. Characteristic values are summarised in Table S1 (ESI†) including the values for the solvent polarisability function R(n) and the solvent polarity function Δf calculated from the refractive index n and dielectric constant ε for each solvent.30
 Fig. 2  (A) Steady-state absorption (left) and fluorescence spectra (right) of H101 in the organic solvents acetonitrile (1), methanol (2), ethanol (3), THF (4), chlorobenzene (5) and n-hexane (6). Fluorescence spectra were scaled by the OD value at the excitation wavelength 400 nm. The solvatochromism analysis for the absorption maximum as a function of the solvent polarisability function R(n) and for the Stokes shift as a function of solvent polarity function Δf are shown in (B and C), respectively. 
The fluorescence spectra did not show any dependence on the excitation wavelength in the range 300–450 nm. Moreover, both the fluorescence excitation and absorption spectra were identical for instance in ethanol and acetonitrile (see Fig. S1(A), ESI†). The emission spectrum showed vibronic structure in non- and mid-polar solvents but became unstructured in polar solvents. The absorption maxima shifted to the red with increasing solvent polarisability (Fig. 2(B)), while the Stokes shift was correlated with the solvent polarity (Fig. 2(C)), see also Table S1 and Fig. S1(B), (C) in the ESI.† The Stokes shift was in the range 1070–2340 cm−1 and increased slightly with solvent polarity. This indicates an only small increase of the dipole moment in the S1 state.
The intensity of the fluorescence spectra in Fig. 2(A) was normalised to the OD value at the excitation wavelength 400 nm. The relative emission intensity was similar in the organic solvents, except for n-hexane. Assuming similar radiative rate constants, the total excited-state lifetime in n-hexane should therefore be shorter. This already suggests the presence of a nonradiative channel in the excited state, which is faster in n-hexane compared with the other solvents. This will be confirmed by the PSCP and TCSPC data below.
We also note that the absorption band near 400 nm stayed the same when the concentration was varied in the range 0.6–40 μM (see Fig. S1(D), ESI†). Thus the formation of aggregates in this concentration range can be neglected. We determined the absolute peak absorption coefficient εmax of neutral H101 to be in the range 49000–57000 M−1 cm−1, slightly depending on the solvent (see Table S1, ESI†).
3.2 Steady-state absorption spectra of H101 cations
Absolute steady-state absorption spectra for the radical cation H101˙+ and the dication H1012+ were determined by spectroelectrochemistry and are presented in Fig. 3. At a voltage of 0.6 V the first oxidation step occurred leading to the formation of H101˙+ (red line). The spectrum is characterised by two prominent peaks, one in the NIR (λmax = 1470 nm, εmax = 31300 M−1 cm−1) and the other in the visible range (λmax = 635 nm, εmax = 35000 M−1 cm−1). The NIR radical cation band is a useful fingerprint band, e.g. for monitoring electron injection from H101 into TiO2, as will be shown later on. Increasing the voltage to 1.2 V leads to formation of the dication H1012+ (blue line) with a characteristic strong absorption peak in the NIR (λmax = 1000 nm, εmax = 75500 M−1 cm−1). The peaks of the cation spectra can be fully assigned with the aid of TDDFT calculations, as described in Section 3.7. We note that attempts to obtain a spectrum of the H101˙− radical anion species failed.
 Fig. 3  Steady-state absorption spectra of H101 (black line), the radical cation H101˙+ (red line) and the dication H1012+ (blue line) in acetonitrile obtained from the spectroelectrochemistry experiments. In the case of H101˙+, a scaled steady-state absorption spectrum of H101 was added to account for the bleach originating from oxidised H101. For obtaining the spectrum of H1012+, a scaled H101˙+ spectrum was additionally subtracted to remove absorption contributions of the radical cation. 
3.3 Excited-state dynamics of H101 in organic solvents
Broadband PSCP transient absorption spectra of H101 in n-hexane and in acetonitrile are shown in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively. The corresponding transient absorption spectra for H101 in THF and methanol are depicted in the ESI,† including an example for the chirp-correction (Fig. S3–S5, ESI†). The complete set of transient absorption spectra for H101 in the four organic solvents and on the Al2O3 and TiO2 thin films are shown as contour plots in Fig. S6, ESI.† Selected kinetic traces are compared in Fig. 6 for longer time scales and in Fig. S7 (ESI†) for early time scales. We also compare the TCSPC results in organic solvents on the nanosecond time scale in Fig. 7.

Fluences are 138 μJ cm−2 and 101 μJ cm−2 for the UV-Vis and NIR range, respectively. The blue and orange dotted lines in the bottom panel are the inverted steady-state absorption spectrum and the steady-state stimulated emission spectrum of H101.

 Fig. 7  Fluorescence decays of H101 in organic solvents upon photoexcitation at 368 nm obtained from TCSPC experiments for the solvents n-hexane, THF, ethanol, methanol and acetonitrile. 
In all PSCP experiments, H101 was excited to the S1 state by a 400 nm pulse. For H101 in n-hexane (Fig. 4), the dynamics around t = 0 in the top panel shows the build-up of a ground-state bleach (GSB) around 420 nm and broad S1 → S0 stimulated emission (SE) around 475 nm. Both are superimposed by Raman structure of H101 which appears within the time-overlap of the pump and probe pulses. In addition, broad S1 → Sn excited-state absorption (ESA) appears which extends into the NIR range. In the second panel the Raman structure has disappeared, and substantial spectral changes are only observed in the 400–480 nm range. Because the GSB feature below 400 nm does not change, the dynamics must be due to intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) or structural relaxation in the S1 state. This leads to an apparent decay of the GSB around 420 nm (likely due to changes in the oscillator strength of a superimposed ESA band) accompanied by the appearance of a sharp peak structure in the SE feature around 475 nm. We note that the SE of this “relaxed S1 state” already very much resembles the steady-state SE spectrum, depicted in the bottom panel as an orange dotted line.
In the third panel, showing the time-scale up to 80 ps, we observe the beginning of a slower process which is characterised by a slight decay of SE and ESA above 420 nm. The spectral development proceeds in the bottom panel showing the transient spectra up to 1491 ps. The SE band around 475 and the ESA band above 680 nm completely decay, and at the same time a new absorption band appears, with a peak at 610 nm. Obviously the S1 state electronically decays to a long-lived non-fluorescing electronic state (most likely by intersystem crossing (ISC) to the T1 triplet state, see below) which does not decay on the time scale of the PSCP experiment (1.5 ns). Note that the GSB feature below 400 nm decays only slightly, showing that the competing S1 → S0 decay (most likely fluorescence with possible contributions of internal conversion) is only a minor channel in n-hexane. This will be also confirmed by the TCSPC experiments and our global kinetic modelling below.
In acetonitrile (Fig. 5), the dynamics is qualitatively similar but shows the following important differences: in the second panel (up to 1.2 ps), beside the apparent reduction of the bleach feature already seen in n-hexane (due to S1 relaxation), we observe a red-shift of the SE band which is assigned to solvent relaxation. Also, in the third and fourth panel we find that the relaxed SE band centred at 500 nm and the ESA band at ca. 680 nm decay more slowly compared with the case in n-hexane (see also Fig. 6(A) and (D) for comparison), and that the remaining absorption band now peaks at ca. 640 nm (assigned to T1 → Tn absorption). Note that the GSB band around 400 nm decays substantially to about 50% of the original amplitude. This is in contrast to the n-hexane case and strongly suggests that in acetonitrile the relaxation from S1,relaxed to the ground electronic state S0 more efficiently competes with the ISC channel S1,relaxed → T1. This will be also confirmed by the TCSPC experiments and our global kinetic modelling below. In the solvents THF and methanol the relaxation of H101 exhibits “intermediate behavior” between n-hexane and acetonitrile (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). A more extended discussion is given in the ESI.†
3.4 Excited-state lifetimes from TCSPC experiments
TCSPC experiments were carried out to obtain the lifetime of the S1 state in solution. Semilogarithmic fluorescence decay curves are presented in Fig. 7. In all solvents, we observe clean monoexponential fluorescence decays over about three orders of magnitude. Lifetime values are summarised in Table 1. We find that the S1 lifetime is shortest in the nonpolar solvent n-hexane (500 ps) and longest in the highly polar acetonitrile (1930 ps). THF, ethanol and methanol have decay times in the range 1080–1300 ps and thus show intermediate behavior. Together with the results of the PSCP experiments (e.g. the long-lived GSB in n-hexane, Fig. 4) this suggests that there is a solvent-dependent kinetic competition between radiative decay and nonradiative relaxation to a long-lived non-fluorescing state. This process is most likely ISC to the T1 state of H101, as will be shown below. The ISC apparently slows down with increasing polarity of the solvent.

3.5 Global kinetic analysis
We carried out a global kinetic analysis to obtain a complete description of the excited-state dynamics of H101 in organic solvents. Table 1 summarises the time constants and quantum yields. Kinetic simulations are included in Fig. 6 as solid lines (for the early-time behaviour see Fig. S7, ESI†). Based on the PSCP and TCSPC results we propose the mechanism shown in Fig. 8. After photoexcitation (S0 → S1) the initially prepared Franck–Condon state quickly relaxes (S1 → S1,relaxed) with the time constant τ1. This relaxed singlet state then decays either to the T1 triplet state via ISC (S1,relaxed → T1, time constant τ2a) or back to the ground electronic state S0 (S1,relaxed → S0, time constant τ2b). Simultaneous optimisation of the species-associated spectra (SAS) of S1, S1,relaxed and T1 and the time constants was performed using the constraint that the rate constant for the decay of S1,relaxed must stay within ±15% of the sum of the rate constants for ISC and relaxation to the ground electronic state from TCSPC, i.e. k2,total = kTCSPC = k2a + k2b or in terms of the time constants: τ2,total = k2,total−1 = τTCSPC = (τ2a−1 + τ2b−1)−1.
 Fig. 8  Proposed relaxation mechanism of H101 in organic solvents. 
In all solvents, the initial relaxation process of H101 in the S1 state is very fast (τ1 = 1.0–1.5 ps). The relative stabilisation of the S1 state is stronger in polar organic solvents, but still the differences are quite small, as can be seen from the measured fluorescence Stokes shifts which vary only in the range 1070–2340 cm−1 (Table S1, ESI†). Therefore the time constant for the radiative decay τ2b of S1,relaxed should be largely independent of the solvent. The global analysis for H101 in n-hexane converges robustly to a value of τ2b = 4 ns, a reasonable value for a radiative lifetime of such an organic molecule. A value of τ2a = 490 ps is obtained for the ISC step. Therefore in n-hexane ISC to the T1 state is the dominant excited-state channel with the quantum yield Φ2a = 89%.
For modelling the spectral dynamics of H101 in the other solvents, the radiative lifetime τ2b was fixed at a value of 4 ns. Interestingly, we observed that the ISC time constant τ2a became slower in polar solvents (e.g. 3900 ps in acetonitrile) leading to a substantial decrease of the ISC quantum yield (51% in acetonitrile). Obviously, the electronic coupling between the relaxed S1 state and the T1 state is better when the former one is less stabilised. We note that such a polarity-induced reduction of the quantum yield for T1 formation has been also observed for other molecules, such as all-trans retinal.31 In that case, ISC from S1 to T1 involved a two-step process with intermediate population of a 1nπ* state. For H101, the presence of sulphur in the EDOT unit likely induces ISC via an internal heavy-atom effect enhancing spin–orbit coupling.32
The SAS from the global kinetic analysis are presented in Fig. 9. The S1 species (black line) shows an SE feature below 540 nm and an ESA feature above, including a weak NIR peak at 1100 nm. The S1,relaxed species looks very similar, but the SE feature is red-shifted due to dynamic solvation and more structured because of intramolecular relaxation. The T1 species exhibits a characteristic band with a peak at ca. 610 nm. Spectral fits showing the contributions of the individual species (S0, S1, S1,relaxed and T1) at selected times are shown for further illustration in the ESI† (Fig. S8–S11).

3.6 Ultrafast dynamics of H101/Al2O3 and H101/TiO2
Contour plots of transient UV-Vis-NIR PSCP broadband absorption spectra of H101 on mesoporous Al2O3 and TiO2 thin films were already included in Fig. S6(E) and (F) (ESI†). The corresponding sets of transient absorption spectra are provided in Fig. 10 and 11, respectively.
 Fig. 10  PSCP spectra of H101 on mesoporous Al2O3. λpump = 400 nm, fluence: 43 and 26 μJ cm−2 for the UV-Vis and NIR transient absorption spectra, respectively. The blue and orange dotted lines in the bottom panel are the inverted steady-state absorption and the steady-state stimulated emission spectra of H101, respectively. The violet dotted line is the absorption spectrum of the radical cation H101˙+ from spectroelectrochemistry. 
Based on the surface polarity of Al2O3 alone, one would expect that H101 experiences an environment with a polarity between THF and n-hexane, as suggested by our previous study of the solar cell dye D49 on Al2O3.6 The overall dynamics of H101 on the mesoporous large band-gap Al2O3 thin film is however much faster than in organic solvents: Fig. 10 (top panel) shows the formation of an initial GSB centred at 410 nm and ESA above 530 nm reaching into the NIR. The fingerprint peak around 1100 nm (also seen in the organic solvents) suggests that the absorption arises from the S1 state. This is confirmed by the emission “shoulder” at ca. 480 nm in the second panel (spectra at 0.2 and 1.2 ps) which must also belong to S1. Drastically different dynamics is already observed in the second panel where GSB and ESA drop to ca. 50% of their initial amplitude. Note however that there is almost no decay in the wavelength range around 1500 nm. In the third panel, the decay of GSB and ESA proceeds. For instance, at 80 ps the GSB has already decayed to 15% of its initial value.
By 80 ps (third panel), the SE and ESA fingerprints of the S1 state have disappeared, but still there is clear absorption around 600 and 1500 nm which decays further up to ca. 1500 ps, the maximum time range studied (bottom panel). The results from spectroelectrochemistry in Fig. 3 strongly suggest that this species is the H101˙+ radical cation (compare with the violet dotted line in the bottom panel of Fig. 10). Electron injection is not feasible on Al2O3,5,6 and therefore the radical cations must have been generated by exciton-splitting, i.e. H101(S1) + H101(S0) → H101˙+ + H101˙−. The spectral features of the H101˙− radical anion highly likely overlap with radical cation features and might also partly fall into the 700–860 nm range which was not covered in the current study (see also our calculations in Section 3.7). We note that triplet formation can be safely neglected in our analysis because it occurs on much longer time scales (500 ps or more, see Table 1). Our results suggest that exciton-splitting is the key process for explaining the dynamics of H101 on Al2O3. The subsequent recombination of excitons is an inhomogeneous process and therefore distributed over a wide range of time scales from a few picoseconds to the several hundred picosecond range. Overall it is much faster than the dynamics observed for isolated H101 in organic solvents.
Next we investigated the dynamics of H101 on TiO2, see Fig. S6(F) in the ESI† and Fig. 11. Electron injection after photoexcitation is feasible in this system, because the S1 state of H101 lies substantially above the conduction band (CB) edge of TiO2.14 The initial dynamics (Fig. 11, top panel) resembles that of H101 on Al2O3. Yet, already at 1.2 ps (second panel) the characteristic absorption peaks of the H101˙+ radical cation at 600 and 1500 nm are much more pronounced than on Al2O3. We take this as clear indication for substantial electron injection from H101 into the CB of TiO2. We therefore observe contributions of electron injection in addition to the exciton-dynamics already discussed for H101/Al2O3. The latter will certainly be present for H101 molecules located further away from the TiO2 surface. Based on the substantial long-lived GSB contribution seen in the third and fourth panel, which decays only very slowly by radical cation – electron recombination, we estimate that roughly 50% of the radical cation formation occurs via the electron injection channel. The other 50% correspond to exciton recombination which mainly accounts for the fast decay of the GSB band.

The blue and orange dotted lines in the bottom panel are the inverted steady-state absorption and the steady-state stimulated emission spectra of H101, respectively. The violet dotted line is the absorption spectrum of the radical cation H101˙+ from spectroelectrochemistry. 
3.7 DFT/TDDFT calculations
We carried out complementary DFT/TDDFT calculations to characterise the electronic transitions for neutral H101 (S0 and T1), the H101˙+ radical cation and the H101˙− radical anion. Fig. 12 displays the results for the S0 geometry of neutral H101 in vacuum (A) and acetonitrile (B) as stick spectra and also as a convolution of the transitions with a Gaussian function of 4000 cm−1 FWHM (red dashed line). We observe good agreement with the experimental steady-state absorption spectrum (blue solid line): the main band at 400 nm is due to the S0 → S1 transition, whereas the second broad band below 300 nm originates from a range of higher energy singlet transitions. In panels (C) and (D), the corresponding results are shown for neutral H101 at the relaxed S1 geometry. In this case, the position of the S0 → S1 transition should provide a reasonable estimate for the location of the fluorescence spectrum. Indeed, the agreement of the convolution with the experimental emission spectrum (green solid line) is satisfactory. We also employed a H101-based model system without methoxy substituents to analyse the vibronic structure of the steady-state fluorescence and absorption spectra. Details are provided in the ESI† (Fig. S12).

(B) Calculation for the S0 geometry using the C-PCM model for acetonitrile, including the experimental steady-state absorption spectrum (blue line). (C) Vacuum calculation based on the S1 geometry. (D) Calculation employing the S1 geometry in an acetonitrile environment (C-PCM model), including the experimental fluorescence spectrum (green line). Red columns represent the oscillator strengths f of the individual electronic transitions. Red dashed lines denote simulations based on a convolution with Gaussian functions (4000 cm−1 FWHM): in the case of the absorption spectra (A and B), the convolution encompasses all electronic transitions, whereas for the emission spectra in (C and D) the convolution employs only the lowest energy transition (S1 → S0) responsible for fluorescence. 

Fig. 13 contains a plot of the S0 → S1 transition density. The hole density (blue) and particle density (red) show that upon photoexcitation electron density is mainly shifted from the nitrogen lone pair of each TAA unit to the thiophenyl ring of the EDOT moiety. It can be therefore interpreted as an nπ*-type transition.

In Fig. 14 we report our DFT/TDDFT results for the T1 triplet state transitions and compare them with the T1 → Tn absorption spectrum of H101 in acetonitrile obtained from the global analysis of the PSCP experiments (blue line). The agreement is reasonable, and the calculated band is shifted toward shorter wavelength. Such a blue-shift might arise from a too large Hartree–Fock exchange in the functional, as found in our systematic study of different functionals in the previous investigation of the solar cell dye E6.5

(B) Calculation for the T1 geometry using the C-PCM model for acetonitrile, including the species-associated spectrum from our global kinetic analysis (blue line). Red columns and dashed lines represent the oscillator strengths f of the individual electronic transitions and the convolution with Gaussian functions (4000 cm−1 FWHM), respectively. 
Calculation results for the H101˙+ radical cation (red) and the H101˙− radical anion (green) are presented in Fig. 15 for vacuum conditions (A) and in acetonitrile (B). The main features of the experimental steady-state absorption spectrum or H101˙+ (blue line) are very well reproduced, however the calculation overestimates the transition energies systematically, similar to the observation for the triplet state. In panel (B), the experimental band in the NIR around 1500 nm is due to the D0 → D1 transition. The weak absorption band at 810 nm arises from D0 → D2. Several doublet transitions, most prominently D0 → D4, contribute to the second intense fingerprint band in the visible part of the spectrum.

(B) Calculation for the D0 geometry using the C-PCM model for acetonitrile, including the experimental steady-state absorption spectrum of H101˙+ from spectroelectrochemistry (blue line). Columns and dashed lines represent the oscillator strengths f of the individual electronic transitions and the convolution with Gaussian functions (4000 cm−1 FWHM), respectively. 
The strongest band of the calculated H101˙− radical anion spectrum in vacuum is located around 1000 nm (Fig. 15(A)) and overlaps with that of the radical cation. This might explain the observation why in the PSCP spectra of Fig. 10 for H101/Al2O3 we observe relatively stronger absorption in the NIR (i.e., sum of H101˙+ radical cation and H101˙− radical anion) compared to the region near 600 nm, while we observe almost a 1:1 ratio in the NIR and 600 nm regions on TiO2 on longer time scales (Fig. 11).
To obtain information, how the positive (negative) excess charge is distributed in the radical cation/anion, we calculated the difference between the Mulliken charges of the radical cation/anion and neutral H101. The results for vacuum conditions are provided in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The results suggest that the excess charge is mainly located on the thiophenyl ring of the EDOT moiety and the adjacent aryl rings of the TAA units.
We also calculated the absorption spectrum of the singlet dication H1012+ (Fig. 16) and compared it with the spectrum obtained from spectroelectrochemistry (blue line). The prominent experimental S0 → S1 peak at ca. 1000 nm is well described, including the much weaker broad pedestal toward shorter wavelength. The latter arises from a combination of several transitions. Also the large oscillator strength of the main absorption band is correctly reproduced, see also the comparison with H101 and H101˙+ in Fig. 3.

(B) Calculation for the S0 geometry using the C-PCM model for acetonitrile, including the experimental steady-state absorption from spectroelectrochemistry (blue line). 
In general, the DFT/TDDFT calculations provide a good description of the experimental spectra and suggest that the spectral assignments of all species in the steady-state and time-resolved spectra are reasonable. A complete compilation of the transition energies and corresponding oscillator strengths for all species of interest is provided in the ESI† (Tables S2–S5). Geometries (xyz coordinates) for different H101 species are provided in the ESI† as a separate file.
4. Conclusions
The current experimental and theoretical study has provided a comprehensive characterisation of the spectroscopy and dynamics of the small-molecule hole-transport material H101. H101 is excited to the S1 state by absorption of 400 nm light. After intramolecular S1 relaxation, formation of the T1 triplet state is the dominant channel in nonpolar solvents, but in highly polar solvents the decay to the ground electronic state S0 competes more efficiently. Intersystem crossing is induced by the internal heavy-atom effect of sulphur.
On “non-injecting” thin films, such as large band-gap Al2O3, intermolecular exciton-splitting is the dominant channel, and there are no spectral indications for T1 formation. We also showed that H101 efficiently injects electrons into the CB of mesoporous TiO2. Looking at the situation in photovoltaic devices, the same must hold for electron injection from H101 into the CB of perovskites which is located at only slightly higher energy than the CB of mesoporous TiO2.33 Therefore HTMs such as H101 will contribute to panchromatic light-harvesting by collecting high-energy photons. This is likely a beneficial property, especially in inverted planar architectures of perovskite thin film solar cells where illumination of the perovskite occurs from the HTM side and the HTM is in direct contact with the perovskite layer. In addition, the exciton-splitting mechanism might also be beneficial, because it prevents H101 from getting trapped in a long-lived triplet state which could open pathways resulting in unwanted chemical decomposition reactions of the HTM.
