    , Accepted 20th August 2021First published on 20th August 2021AbstractEfficient and long-term stable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via water splitting are urgently desired to ease the energy crisis and develop the sustainability of human society. However, the HER performance of state-of-the-art Pt in non-acidic solutions is unsatisfactory due to the severely sluggish kinetics. Here, DFT theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru/RuO2 composites enable high HER activity to be pursued under non-acidic conditions because of the distinctive Ru and RuO2 interface, which possess not only a strong capability to adsorb and dissociate water but also appropriate binding energies of H and OH. Therefore, we employ a simple strategy, including heating under an oxygen-poor environment and/or in situ electrochemical reduction, to partially reduce RuO2. The formed Ru/RuO2 interfaces demonstrate superior HER activities (e.g. η10 = 17 mV, 35 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH) than Pt/C (e.g. η10 = 27 mV, 58 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH) at both small (10–100 mA cm−2) and large (1 A cm−2) current densities in alkaline solution and even real seawater. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to investigate the structure-HER performance relationships. Moreover, benefiting from the bifunctional character of RuO2, a two-electrode system based on Ru/RuO2 composites and RuO2 exhibits the lowest cell voltage for water splitting in both 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. A 300 h-stability test at 10 mA cm−2 without an obvious decay demonstrates the industrial prospects of the Ru/RuO2 composites to generate green energy.

Broader context
The severe dependence on burning fossil fuels has triggered the depletion of traditional energy and the jeopardization of Earth's ecosystems. Alternatively, hydrogen that processes the highest mass-energy density (120 MJ kg−1), is deemed as clean energy that can be stored, moved, and delivered efficiently. Water electrolysis with renewable solar and wind energy resources is a promising option for carbon-free hydrogen production. Though Platinum (Pt) is a well-known catalyst for electrical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the high cost and unsatisfactory performance in non-acidic media restrict its scalable commercialization. Here, distinctive ruthenium and ruthenium oxide (Ru/RuO2) composites are proposed as superior HER catalysts according to density functional theory calculations, which are then synthesized by cost-effectively in situ electrochemical reduction and/or thermal processes. The optimal Ru/RuO2 composites outperform commercial Pt/C catalysts for HER in a wide range of non-acidic media and real seawater as well. The comprehensive analyses of theoretical calculations and experimental results illustrate the structure-HER performance relationships for the first time, which not only come up with an outstanding catalyst for overall water splitting but also pave roads for the exploration of new catalysts.

Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) is a promising candidate for the future energy supply because it has the highest gravimetric energy density of all fuels and water is the sole combustion product.1,2 The conversion of abundant water into hydrogen motivates great interest in the electrolysis of water, which involves two half-reactions: the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER).3,4 To produce H2 cost-effectively and sustainably, the desirable HER catalysts have to be both active and stable in acidic, alkaline, and neutral media.5,6 Among reported electrocatalysts, Pt and Pt-group metals are the most efficient catalysts for the HER in acidic media due to the optimal Gibbs free energy (ΔGH) of metal–hydrogen bonding (M–Hads) at the center of the HER volcano plot.7,8 However, producing H2 in alkaline and neutral media remains a challenge due to the large kinetic energy barrier of the water dissociation step (i.e., the Volmer reaction)9,10 and even the state-of-the-art Pt catalyst shows poor activity under those conditions.11 Therefore, identifying efficient and economical HER catalysts functional in non-acidic environments, like seawater, is crucial to the hydrogen economy.12
Recently, many low-cost transition metal composites (oxides,13 sulfides,14,15 phosphides,16–18 carbides,19,20 and nitrides21) and carbon materials have been explored as alternatives in non-acidic media. However, their HER performance is still inferior to Pt-group materials, and also their catalytic and chemical stability do not meet the requirement of industrial applications and the environment.22,23 On the other hand, Ruthenium (Ru), possessing a similar M–Hads bond energy as Pt but with a cheaper price, shows a great potential to be an alternative HER catalyst.24 Therefore, a few studies based on Ru metal, alloys, and composites have been tried,25–37 such as RuCu nanocrystals,38 carbon quantum dots (CQDs)-loaded Ru metal or RuNi bimetal nanoparticle electrocatalyst (Ru@CQDs, RuNi@CQDs),28,35 Ru-Co nanoalloys,33 and Ru@C2N.29,30 Some demonstrated high activity for the HER, attributed to their optimal hydrogen binding energy at the catalyst surface that is facilitated by either the formed alloy structure or the carbon substrates. However, these synthetic methods are complicated and have high-energy consumption, like the synthesis of CQDs supports, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) precursors and high-temperature annealing processes are required.30,39,40 To simplify the industrial process and lower the cost, catalysts that could work efficiently for the overall water-splitting reaction (both HER and OER) are especially preferred. Therefore, the development of facile processes to synthesize Ru-based catalysts with superior efficiency and bifunctional property for overall water-splitting are in demand.
To improve the HER performance of Ru-based catalysts, it is important to identify rate-limiting reaction steps. Various studies have illuminated the first step of water dissociation as well as proper M–Hads bonds are the key issues.41–43 Therefore, forming metal/metal oxide interfaces may be a method to improve the HER performance in non-acidic environments.41 For example, Subbaraman et al. designed Li+–Ni(OH)2–Pt interfaces for alkaline HER, which utilized the oxide to provide the active sites for water dissociation, while the metal to facilitate hydrogen adsorption and desorption to generate H2.44 Similar studies are also found for NiO/Ni-CNT and Ni/CeO2-CNT.45,46 Moreover, consider that RuO2 is the state-of-the-art catalyst for OER and displays great capability for water dissociation, but its electrocatalytic activity toward HER is not sufficient.47,48 Hence, the formation of proper Ru/RuO2 composites could be one of the simplest strategies to achieve cost-effective HER catalysts.
As the corresponding oxide of Ru, the phase transformation of RuO2 into Ru inspired us to produce the Ru/RuO2 composites via an in situ electrochemical strategy. Understanding the electrochemical processing is crucial to control the transformation of RuO2, however, the reduction of RuO2 under negative potential is debated. It has been reported that RuO(OH)2 is observed on the surface of RuO2 and subsequently reduced to metallic Ru.49 While the formation of metallic Ru has been doubted based on theoretical studies of shifts in the energy of the X-ray photoelectrons.50 A more nuanced mechanism accounting for the pH of the reaction solution suggests that the reduction of RuO2 only occurs in acidic media and not in alkaline solutions.51 Therefore, conditions must be elucidated before implementing the electroreduction on RuO2, which not only contribute to efficient catalyst design but also reveal the active sites.
Here, based on the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we develop a simple method to precisely synthesize Ru/RuO2 composites, which are capable of evolving H2 with high efficiency and great stability in non-acidic media. Only small overpotentials are required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for HER in different conditions (η10 = 16, 17, 29 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH, and 1 M KPi, respectively), which are comparable to and even outperform the optimized commercial Pt/C and many other reported electrocatalysts. Systematic investigation reveals that the excellent HER performance is due to the synergistic effect of the Ru and RuO2 interfaces, which could be obtained from the annealing under an oxygen-poor environment and/or in situ electrochemical reduction. Further combining with the RuO2 anode for overall water-splitting reaction, the Ru/RuO2//RuO2 two-electrode cell shows the best performance with great stability up to 300 h without noticeable degradation compared to the reported catalysts. Moreover, the Ru/RuO2 composites not only outperform Pt/C in alkaline media from 10 to 1000 mA cm−2 with good stability but also in seawater as well. The study of structural changes and mechanisms of the HER of RuO2 may provide further impetus for designing efficient and pH-universal water-splitting catalysts.
DFT calculations for catalyst design
DFT calculations were performed to help design high-efficient catalysts for the HER. In acidic conditions, the metal–hydrogen (M–Hads) bond serves as a key part of the HER process. While in alkaline and neutral media, the water dissociation step, as well as the proper M–Had are both significant for HER performance, and they depend on how H2O, H, and OH bond to the surface of the catalysts. RuO2 has outstanding catalytic activity toward the OER, while poor performance for the HER. The proper modification of RuO2 with HER active Ru would help to design an effective HER catalyst. Hence, binding energies of H2O, H and OH and the H2O dissociation on the Pt (111), Ru(001) facets, RuO2 (110), and Ru/RuO2 composites were examined (Fig. 1). The computed surfaces were selected from the most commonly observed ones in both experimental and theoretical modeling studies. The first step is water (H2O) adsorption on the surface of selected metals (M). Due to the excellent H2O adsorption capacity of Ru (0.85 eV) and RuO2 (0.64 eV), the Ru/RuO2 surface displays higher M–H2O binding energy (0.60 eV) than Pt/C (0.48 eV), which improves H2O adsorption and accelerates the Volmer step. In the following step, H2O is decomposed into H and OH, and the easier water dissociates, the more protons can be supplied and the faster the reaction should be. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the H2O dissociation on the surface of Ru/RuO2 is much easier than that on the Pt/C surface, because RuO2 shows the lowest H2O dissociation energy and contributes to H2O dissociation on the surface of Ru/RuO2. Furthermore, Ru/RuO2 interface has moderate H and OH binding energies which are comparable to Pt/C, leading to efficient hydrogen evolution and rapid regeneration of active sites. Therefore, the Ru/RuO2 composites demonstrate an outstanding H2O adsorption, H2O dissociation, and appropriate binding energies of H and OH, showing a potential HER catalyst to replace Pt in non-acidic media that is being carefully studied and correlated with detailed experiments.

Surface reduction chemistry and electrochemical evaluation
The catalyst was fabricated with a precipitation method followed by an annealing process. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) was used as the precipitant. After the introduction of KOH into the solution of RuCl3, Ru3+ precipitated and formed RuO2–RT (RuO2·xH2O, RT for short), which is also formulated as Ru(OH)3. In terms of the heating process, the metal hydroxides are converted to metal oxides and are denoted as RuO2-300Ar after annealing at 300 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were applied to investigate the morphology and crystal structure of obtained RuO2-300Ar. The as-prepared RuO2-300Ar materials are made of aggregated nanoparticles with a diameter of 50–100 nm (Fig. 2a). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in the inset of Fig. 2a reveals a characteristic halo ring pattern due to an amorphous structure. Meanwhile, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) in Fig. 2b shows a random distribution of atoms, which is consistent with the results of diffraction patterns in Fig. 2a and f, indicating the amorphous structure of RuO2-300Ar. Considering that there are many contradictory opinions regarding the structural changes of RuO2 during the HER,49–51 the structure and composition of RuO2 are characterized after the HER experiments. Clearly, morphological changes and polycrystalline rings of hexagonal Ru are observed (Fig. 2c). Meanwhile, the HRTEM image reveals an amorphous region and d-spacings of 0.214, 0.206 nm assigned to Ru (002), (101) facets, confirming the partial reduction of RuO2 to Ru under negative potential (Fig. 2d). Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis shows that most of the reduced Ru are distributed on the surface of the particles (Fig. 2e). The diffraction pattern of materials after the HER exhibits two peaks located at 38.08 and 44.01° (Fig. 2f), which are ascribed to (100) and (101) planes of crystalline Ru (JCPDS: 01-089-4903). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to further examine the structural and electronic changes of the obtained RuO2-300Ar, where the Ru 3d5/2 detected at 280.54 eV corresponds to Ru4+ before HER (Fig. 2g). This peak shifts to a lower binding energy of 280.20 eV after HER, which is attributed to Ru0. Raman was also carried out and the result shows three major Raman-active modes Eg, A1g, B2g of RuO2 in both samples before and after HER (Fig. S2, ESI†), suggesting that RuO2 still exists after HER. All these findings confirm that the amorphous RuO2-300Ar was partially converted to Ru after HER and the mixture of Ru/RuO2 composites serves as the catalytic component for producing hydrogen. A detailed study about structural changes of RuO2 during HER will be discussed later.

To evaluate the catalytic activity during the HER, polarization curves are collected in 1 M KOH (pH = 14) with a three-electrode system, where the resistance compensation and RHE calibration of the reference electrode were applied to eliminate the effect of solution resistance and calculation errors of the reference electrode (Fig. S3, ESI†). Among the three commercial catalysts (Fig. 3a), Pt/C still exhibits better activity for HER (27 mV) than Ru (32 mV), and commercial RuO2 (100 mV) to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (η10). Noticeably, the RuO2-300Ar electrode shows a η10 value of only 17 mV, which is even lower than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Similar results are obtained with the rotating disk electrode (RDE) system (Fig. S4, ESI†).

(c) Overpotentials and tafel slops of RuO2-300Ar and Pt/C at 10 mA cm−2, with other recently reported HER electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH. (d) Multi-current chronopotentiometric curves obtained with the RuO2-300Ar and Pt/C electrodes in 1 M KOH without iR compensation. 
To better understand the intrinsic and kinetic properties of catalysts, electrochemical surface area (ECSA) normalized polarization curves, charge transfer resistance, and Tafel slopes are calculated. The ECSA corrected RuO2–300Ar electrode displays the highest HER activity, which is about 2.5 times that of Pt/C and Ru, and 17.7 times that of commercial RuO2 at an overpotential of 80 mV (Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†), suggesting the high intrinsic activity of RuO2-300Ar toward HER. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data show a smaller charge transfer resistance of RuO2-300Ar (0.4 Ohms) than that of Pt/C (2.9 Ohms) at an overpotential of 50 mV for the HER, demonstrating more efficient electron transfer at the interface of the RuO2-300Ar electrode and the electrolyte (Fig. S6, ESI†). Importantly, the Tafel slope of the RuO2-300Ar electrode is 35 mV dec−1, which is lower than that of Pt/C (59 mV dec−1) and Ru (74 mV dec−1) and commercial RuO2 (101 mV dec−1) in 1 M KOH solution (Fig. 3b). Based on our knowledge, the overpotential and Tafel slope of RuO2-300Ar outperforms most of the reported catalysts toward the HER (Fig. 3c and Table S9, ESI†).52–56 Furthermore, the lower Tafel slope value of the RuO2-300Ar catalyst implies faster charger transfer kinetics and a more rapid increase of current density for the HER with increasing overpotential, resulting in a competitive advantage for industrial applications, especially for current densities on the order of 1000 mA cm−2. Hence, catalytic activity to drive current density up to 1000 mA cm−2 is compared between RuO2-300Ar and commercial Pt/C without iR compensation to mimic the production of hydrogen in an electrolyzer. As shown in Fig. 3d, RuO2-300Ar surpasses Pt/C at all current densities from 10 to 1000 mA cm−2. The difference of overpotential increases along with the increase of current density, and a 375 mV value of lower overpotential at 1000 mA cm−2 is observed for RuO2-300Ar than that of Pt/C. In addition, the stabilities of RuO2-300Ar under multiple current densities are also superior to that of Pt/C (Fig. S7, ESI†).
On another hand, in acidic conditions, the hydronium cation (H3O+) serving as the proton source is coupled with an electron transferred from the electrode to form adsorbed hydrogen atoms. An appropriate M–Hads binding energy is important for HER under acidic conditions, which should be neither too low nor too high.32 Pt is reported to show an optimal value of M–Hads.57 Surprisingly, the RuO2-300Ar electrode merely requires a η10 value of 16 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, comparable to that of the optimal Pt/C (Fig. S8a, ESI†). More importantly, a neutral solution (such as KPi) is environmentally friendly for water splitting, which not only reduces adverse damage to the environment but also extends the lifetime of devices.58 Thus, the HER performance in 1 M KPi buffer electrolyte (pH = 7) was investigated. The RuO2-300Ar electrode is also highly active and requires a η10 value of 29 mV (Fig. S8b, ESI†). The result is much better than most of the reported top-performing HER catalysts in neutral media (Table S11, ESI†), for example, RuP2@NPC (η10 = 57 mV),59 CrOx/Cu–Ni (η10 = 48 mV),42 Rh2P (η10 = 38 mV)60 and Co-Fe-P (η10 = 138 mV).61
Effect of annealing temperature and environment
To better understand the effect of annealing temperature and environment, various RuO2 samples were obtained by treating RuO2–RT at multiple temperatures and environments. Generally, low-temperature annealed RuO2 materials are amorphous particles (Fig. S9, ESI†). As the temperature increases, diffraction peaks, which can be assigned to the tetragonal phase RuO2 (JCPDS No. 01-088-0322), are present. Moreover, hexagonal close-packed Ru (JCPDS No. 01-089-4903) is observed in RuO2-500Ar, due to the oxygen-poor environment. No Ru phase is present in RuO2-500Air, due to the oxygen-rich surroundings during the calcination process in air. In-depth analyses from EELS reveal the oxidation state of bulk RuO2 materials. Unlike the identical M3 edge of 400Air and commercial RuO2 (Fig. 4a), the M3 edge of 400Ar lies between that of Ru and RuO2 references and shifts to a higher energy than that of 300Ar, suggesting that the samples heated under Ar have lower oxidation states due to oxygen-poor conditions. Notably, the surface areas are almost the same for the RuO2 samples under Ar or Air at the same temperature (Fig. S12, ESI†). The detailed analyses for RuO2 materials are presented in the ESI† (Fig. S10–S12).

(c) Cyclic voltammogram study of RuO2-300Ar in 1 M KOH: CV scan positively from x to 1.03 V vs. RHE without any activation to investigate the reduction process. −0.08 to 1.03 V cycle 2 is CV after holding the electrode at the potential of −0.08 V for 5 min for HER. (d and e) High-resolution Ru 3d XPS spectra of crystallized RuO2 materials (d) and amorphous RuO2 materials (e) prior to and post HER in 1 M KOH. (f and g) Ru-M3 edge (f) and O-K edge (g) EELS spectra of RuO2-300Ar, 300Air prior to and post HER and compared with commercial Ru and RuO2. 
The electrocatalytic activities of RuO2 samples were then carefully evaluated and compared (Fig. 4b and Fig. S13, Table S2, ESI†). Based on these results, three features need to emphasize. Firstly, low-temperature annealed RuO2 displays a higher HER activity regardless of Ar or air environment. Secondly, despite a similar ECSA for RuO2-Air and RuO2-Ar at each temperature, the HER performance of RuO2-Ar is obviously superior to that of RuO2-Air except at 250 °C. Thirdly, the ECSA trends of 300Ar ≈ 300Air > 300H2 > 400Ar are not consistent with the HER activities of 300Ar ≈ 400Ar > 300Air ≈ 300H2. Therefore, the HER performances are partially related to the annealing temperature and environment. Whereas the activity difference between RuO2-Ar and RuO2-Air is not related to the number of active sites but may be due to the generation of metallic or lower oxidation states Ru, which can be observed in the original structure of RuO2-500Ar and 400Ar, as well as in the reduced RuO2-300Ar after the HER. In addition, compared to the stable and high HER activity of RuO2-300Ar, RuO2–RT shows a progressively optimized HER performance with LSV test cycles (Fig. S14, ESI†). Hence, the structural transformations under negative potential need to be further studied to understand structure-HER performance relationships.
Effect of in situ electrochemical reduction
First of all, the reduction process of RuO2-300Ar was studied via multiple cyclic voltammogram (CV) scans positively from x V to 1.03 V vs. RHE. The initial x value is 0 and declines to −0.08 V with a decrease of 10 mV per scan. Unlike the initial CV having a rectangular shape which is a feature of RuO2, the peak for hydrogen oxidation becomes apparent as the scanned potential shifts negatively (Fig. 4c). After the chronoamperometry at −0.08 V for 5 min, the CV curve shows a characteristic shape that is very similar to that of metallic Ru (Fig. S15, ESI†). It indicated that the negative potential enhances the reduction process within a few minutes or even seconds to form Ru metal, which will be analyzed via various techniques.
Post characterization of RuO2 samples after HER was conducted. The morphology of RuO2 at all temperatures seems unchanged after the HER based on SEM images (Fig. S16, ESI†). Unlike the crystallized RuO2 maintaining almost an identical morphology and diffraction pattern (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†), Ru metal appears after HER on the amorphous RuO2 samples (Fig. S17 and S19, ESI†). Furthermore, the HRTEM images reveal that the newly formed lattices of Ru integrate with the irregular atomic arrangement, demonstrating the complexity of metallic Ru and substrate RuO2. The composition and elemental ratios were also evaluated with EDX for each sample (Tables S3 and S4, ESI†), indicating that oxygen atoms are losing after HER on the amorphous RuO2 samples. The surface analyses from the XPS spectra and in-depth analyses from EELS on the Ru valence state reveal that the oxidation states of crystallized RuO2 do not change after HER (Fig. 4d, f and Fig. S20, ESI†). Notably, the shift of the Ru 3d region to lower binding energy for Ru0 for the amorphous RuO2 (Fig. 4e and Fig. S21, ESI†) and another shift of the M3 edge to the direction of the Ru reference were observed for 300Ar after HER (Fig. 4f), indicating the reduction of amorphous RuO2 under negative potential. The ratio of Ru to RuO2 after the reduction was also determined by XPS spectra (Tables S5 and S6, ESI†), where the 300Ar sample after HER demonstrated a higher Ru to RuO2 ratio of 4:1 than other samples. Furthermore, the single broad O–K edge of the 300Ar sample after HER is distinguished from the double peaks of the RuO2 samples, confirming the reduction to metallic Ru (Fig. 4g).
Comprehensive analyses of different samples show that the Ru/RuO2 composites can be obtained by not only electroreduction but also thermal annealing under oxygen-poor environments. ECSA normalized polarization curves confirmed the superior intrinsic activity of Ru/RuO2 composites toward HER (Fig. S22, ESI†) when comparing RuO2-300Ar (Ru/RuO2) to 300H2 (Ru) and 300Air (RuO2). According to the DFT calculations, RuO2 is good at the first step (water dissociation) but poor for H desorption whereas Ru does the opposite. Ru/RuO2 interface not only benefits from RuO2 to facilitate the water dissociation but also possesses optimal H binding energy to produce H2 thanks to the existence of Ru, which further makes Ru/RuO2 outperform commercial Pt/C, Ru, and RuO2 for HER. Therefore, both the theoretical DFT and the experimental results about the Ru/RuO2 composites kept consistent and successfully illustrated the HER mechanisms under acidic and alkaline conditions.
The application for overall water-splitting
RuO2 has been a well-known and outstanding electrocatalyst for OER due to the great capability toward water dissociation and lower energy gaps of intermediates (*OO*H phase) during OER.62 Materials that serve as bifunctional catalysts for both HER and OER are preferred for industrial applications, which could simplify these systems and reduce manufacturing costs.63,64 Therefore, the overall water-splitting performance based on RuO2 was investigated. Ru metal is not stable under OER conditions due to the oxidation of Ru0 to dissolvable oxide Ru6+.62,65 While crystallized RuO2 annealed in air displayed excellent stability and activity for the OER, where the RuO2-300Air shows the best OER performance compared with RuO2-400Air and commercial RuO2 due to the smaller particle size and lower crystallization (Fig. S23 and S24, ESI†). Hence, RuO2-300Air was used as the counter electrode for OER and paired with RuO2-300Ar to drive the overall water-splitting reaction. In both alkaline and acidic media (Fig. 5a), only 1.45 and 1.54 V are required for 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, which is comparable to reported catalysts (Table S12, ESI†).53,55,63,66,67 Long-term stability tests based on two electrode of RuO2-300Ar//RuO2-300Air were also collected (Fig. 5b and Fig. S25, ESI†). In either 1 M KOH or 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, RuO2-300Ar//RuO2-300Air maintains excellent catalytic activity for water splitting for up to 300 h. Even though the power was deliberately switched off for 24 h during the testing, the catalytic activity and stability of this system are almost unaffected, which is further confirmed by elemental analysis that no signal of Ru in the electrolyte after the usage.

In this work, we also studied the HER performance of the RuO2-300Ar electrocatalyst in real seawater (Fig. S26, ESI†). A multi-step chronoamperometric curve was carried out to compare the HER performance of RuO2-300Ar and Pt/C at different current densities from 10 to 250 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5c). RuO2-300Ar surpassed Pt/C at each current density and an overpotential difference of 198 mV was observed when driving 250 mA cm−2. The overall water-splitting performance was also compared with the two-electrode configuration between RuO2-300Ar//RuO2-300Air and Pt/C//comm. RuO2 (Fig. 5d), and the set-up photo and video for water-splitting in real seawater are shown in Fig. 5e and ESI† (video). The potential required for RuO2-300Ar//RuO2-300Air was 203 mV lower than that of Pt/C//comm. RuO2 to produce 100 mA cm−2, where its advantages became obvious with the increase of current density.
Conclusions
In summary, under the guidance of DFT calculations, unique Ru/RuO2 composites were proposed and successfully obtained via simple heating under oxygen-poor environments and/or in situ electrochemical reduction. The electrochemical evaluation of the Ru/RuO2 composites displays comparable and even better HER activity than Pt/C and many other electrocatalysts at pH values from 0 to 14. Both the theoretical DFT and the experimental results illustrated that the origin of the excellent electrocatalysis is due to the synergistic effect of the Ru/RuO2 interface, which holds outstanding H2O adsorption, H2O dissociation, and appropriate binding energies of H and OH. The two-electrode study shows that the RuO2-300Ar//RuO2-300Air system can be used as potential electrocatalysts for overall water-splitting in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes and even in real seawater, which provides a promising entry point for serving as catalysts for commercial water electrolyzers. Our work proposes a novel cost-effective strategy to realize metal/metal oxide catalysts that are highly active and stable for generating hydrogen under pH-universal electrolytes.
Experimental
Chemicals
Ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (RuCl3·xH2O, Sigma-Aldrich), potassium hydroxide (KOH, Sigma-Aldrich), Ruthenium black (particle size: 6 nm, Sigma-Aldrich), 20% Pt/C (20% Pt on graphite, Sigma-Aldrich), Ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2, Sigma-Aldrich), Nafion solution (5 wt% in a mixture of alcohols and water, Fuel Cell Store), carbon (Vulcan XC-72) were used as received. Carbon Cloth (CC) was purchased from Fuel Cell Store and cleaned with water, ethanol, and acetone before use.
Synthesis of RuO2
RuO2 was synthesized by a simple solution method and followed by annealing in different atmospheric conditions. In a typical synthesis, 100 mg of RuCl3·xH2O was dissolved in 10 mL of distilled deionized water (DDW) with magnetic stirring, forming an acidic solution. Then 1 M KOH solution was dropwise added into the solution while stirring. The reaction was done when the pH of the solution was close to 7. After the reaction, the product was decanted and rinsed with DDW five times using a centrifuge and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The as-prepared sample is denoted as RuO2–RT (RT for short). The obtained precursors were then annealed at 250, 300, 400, 500 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 to form RuO2-250Ar, RuO2-300Ar, RuO2-400Ar, RuO2-500Ar, respectively (250Ar, 300Ar, 400Ar, 500Ar for short). For comparison, the obtained products were calcined under Air atmosphere with the same program to prepare RuO2-250Air, RuO2-300Air, RuO2-400Air, RuO2-500Air, respectively (250Air, 300Air, 400Air, 500Air for short). To obtain Ru, the precursors were calcined at 300 °C for 2 h under H2 atmosphere.
Preparation of pure RuO2 electrode
About 10 mg of RuO2 catalyst was dispersed in 500 μL of a water/ethanol mixture with a volume ratio of 1:1. The suspension was ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then 100 μL of the homogeneous suspension was dropped onto cleaned CC and left to dry under air. The active loading of the catalysts was 2 mg cm−2. For simplicity, these pure RuO2 electrodes were named according to the annealing temperature and atmosphere, such as RT, 250Ar, 300Ar, 400Ar, 500Ar, 250Air, 300Air, 400Air, and 500Air. After electrochemical measurements, these coated CCs were placed in a vial and ultrasonicated to collect catalysts. The collected catalysts after HER are denoted as RT-HER, 250Ar-HER, 300Ar-HER, 400Ar-HER, 500Ar-HER, 250Air-HER, 300Air-HER, 400Air-HER, and 500Air-HER. Then samples were washed with DDW and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight for further characterization.
Preparation of 20% RuO2/C, 20% Ru/C and 20% comm. RuO2/C electrodes
About 1 mg of RuO2-300Ar, 4 mg of carbon (VulcanXC-72) and 40 μL of a 5 wt% Nafion solution were dispersed in 460 μL of a water/ethanol mixture with a volume ratio of 1:1. The suspension was ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then 100 μL of the homogeneous suspension was dropped onto washed CC and left to dry under air. The active loading of the catalyst RuO2-300Ar was 0.2 mg cm−2. To prepare the 20% Ru/C and 20% comm. RuO2/C electrode, 1 mg of commercial Ru metal or commercial RuO2 was used instead of RuO2-300Ar, and other conditions were kept the same. The active loading of the Ru or RuO2 catalyst was 0.2 mg cm−2.
Preparation of 20% Pt/C electrode
To prepare the 20% Pt/C electrode, 5 mg of commercial Pt/C was used instead of 1 mg of RuO2-300Ar and 4 mg of carbon, and other conditions were maintained the same. The active loading of the catalyst Pt was 0.2 mg cm−2.
Rotating disk electrode
About 1 mg of RuO2-300Ar, 4 mg of carbon (VulcanXC-72) and 40 μL of a 5 wt% Nafion solution were dispersed in 960 μL of a water/ethanol mixture with a volume ratio of 1:1. The suspension was ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then 8 μL of the homogeneous suspension was dropped onto polished graphite (surface area 0.196 cm2) and left to dry under air. The active loading of the RuO2-300Ar catalyst was 0.04 mg cm−2. For Pt/C, 5 mg of 20% Pt/C was dispersed instead of RuO2-300Ar and carbon. The active loading amount is the same as RuO2-300Ar.
Material characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15406 nm) at a beam voltage of 40 kV and a current of 44 mA. Due to the limited amount of material after HER, the XRD patterns were compared by collecting the data of working electrodes (catalysts coated carbon cloth). The peak at 43° is attributed to the substrate carbon cloth. The Raman spectra were taken on a Renishaw 2000 Raman microscope, which includes an optical microscope and a CCD camera for multichannel detection. A laser of 514 nm was used as the excitation source and silicon wafer was used to calibrate the instrument. The morphologies of the materials were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI Nova SEM 450) with an accelerating voltage of 2.0 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was collected on an Oxford Aztec energy microanalysis system with X-Max 80 silicon drift detector. Detailed information of the surface morphology, particle size, and structure were performed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Talos F200X instrument with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done on a PHI Model 590 spectrometer with multiprobes (Al Kα radiation, λ = 1486.6 eV, operated at 250 W). The energy calibration was referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV during analysis. The surface area of the material was determined by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1-1C automated adsorption system. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was acquired with a Themis instrument in the 300 kV TEM diffraction mode with a convergence angle of about 1 mrad and a collection angle of about 2.5 mrad. Elemental compositions of the electrolyte before and after the HER were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using a Rigaku ZSX Primus IV sequential wavelength-dispersive XRF diffractometer equipped with a 4 kW Rh anode X-ray tube.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation using a three-electrode configuration. The cell setup consisted of a working electrode coated with catalysts, a graphite rod as counter electrode, and Hg/HgO, KOH (1.0 M) reference electrode for measurements in 1.0 M KOH, Hg/HgSO4, K2SO4(sat) reference electrode for measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4, Saturated calomel electrode (SCE) for measurement in 1.0 M KPi. The reference electrodes were calibrated against a reversible hydrogen electrode in high purity hydrogen saturated solution using two Pt wires as the working and counter electrodes, respectively. The average of the potentials at which the current crossed zero was taken to be the thermodynamic potential for the hydrogen electrode reactions (Fig. S3, ESI†).
To study alterations in the electrochemical behavior of the catalysts, cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the potential range of 0–1.03 V vs. RHE was investigated before and after HER measurements. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was measured at ambient temperature to evaluate the HER activity of the catalysts with a sweep rate of 2 mV s−1. Before collecting the LSV curves, at least 20 cycles of CV in the active region were performed and continuous H2 was purged into the electrolyte to establish standard conditions. A chronopotentiometric test was done to show electrode durability. A continuous current density of 10 mA cm−2 was used for the cathodic reaction without iR-compensation. The Tafel slopes were calculated by fitting the linear regions of the Tafel plots to the Tafel equation (Z = blog(j) + a) by replotting the polarization curves. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the potentiostatic mode with a frequency range from 0.1 to 100 kHz. To measure the ECSAs, the double-layer capacitance was measured using CV with a scan rate ranging from 5 to 50 mV s−1 in a non-faradaic potential window of 0.5 to 0.6 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH. A specific capacitance of 40 μF cm−2 was used to calculate the ECSAs for RuO2, Ru, and Pt. All the LSV tests were represented with iR compensation except when noted, which is done via iR compensation command in CHI software by applying the test potential, step amplitude, compensation level and overshoot level as 0 V, 0.05 V, 100% and 2%, respectively.
DFT calculation
For DFT calculations, we used the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) to calculate the binding energy for the specific surfaces of materials.68,69 The projected augmented wave pseudopotentials70 and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient-corrected exchange–correlation potential71 are implemented with the VASP package. A plane-wave basis using a planewave kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV and gamma-centered Monkhorst–Pack30 electronic wavevector grid of 5 × 5 × 1 were applied for the calculations. First-order Methfessel–Paxton electron smearing of 0.05 eV and Spin-polarizations were considered in the DFT.

Broader context
The severe dependence on burning fossil fuels has triggered the depletion of traditional energy and the jeopardization of Earth's ecosystems. Alternatively, hydrogen that processes the highest mass-energy density (120 MJ kg−1), is deemed as clean energy that can be stored, moved, and delivered efficiently. Water electrolysis with renewable solar and wind energy resources is a promising option for carbon-free hydrogen production. Though Platinum (Pt) is a well-known catalyst for electrical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the high cost and unsatisfactory performance in non-acidic media restrict its scalable commercialization. Here, distinctive ruthenium and ruthenium oxide (Ru/RuO2) composites are proposed as superior HER catalysts according to density functional theory calculations, which are then synthesized by cost-effectively in situ electrochemical reduction and/or thermal processes. The optimal Ru/RuO2 composites outperform commercial Pt/C catalysts for HER in a wide range of non-acidic media and real seawater as well. The comprehensive analyses of theoretical calculations and experimental results illustrate the structure-HER performance relationships for the first time, which not only come up with an outstanding catalyst for overall water splitting but also pave roads for the exploration of new catalysts.
