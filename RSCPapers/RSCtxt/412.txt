Introduction
The elimination of hazardous organic pollutants from water has become an issue of global concern.1–4 Compared with traditional strategies to treat wastewater,4,5 photooxidation has shown many advantages, such as solar energy utilization, thorough degradation and capability of removing toxic, bioresistant, and inorganic compounds.6,7 Owing to low cost, photochemical stability, low toxicity and unique opto-electronic properties, TiO2 is an efficient photocatalytic material to degrade pollutants.8–11 Plenty of efforts have been devoted to improve the photocatalytic capability of TiO2. There are three main factors that influence its photocatalytic efficiency: crystalline phases,6,12 specific surface areas,13,14 and optical structures.9,15–18 Among three crystalline phases, anatase exhibits the best photocatalytic performance in comparison with rutile and brookite.13,19 Materials with high specific surface areas, such as mesoporous TiO2 and P25 nanoparticles, have been prepared to improve pollutant adsorption and hence to enhance photocatalytic capability.13 In recent years, hierarchical structures have drawn great attention for their superior photocatalytic performance thanks to the synergetic effects of different dimensional levels.9,18,20 Yu et al. fabricated hierarchical macro/mesoporous TiO2 which showed 2 times higher photocatalytic efficiency than P25 due to higher surface area and light scattering.21 Tang et al. prepared hierarchical TiO2 nanoflake and nanoparticle hybrid structures, whose photocatalytic efficiency in degrading methyl orange and bisphenol-A approximated that of P25.22 Most hierarchical structures focused on combining the high surface area of the nanostructure with the light scattering and highly efficient medium diffusion of the microstructure. However, TiO2 nanostructures have some intrinsic weaknesses. For example, heat treatment and UV illumination will induce a collapse of the porous structure.23 In addition, there are always some surfactant residuals resulting from the fabrication process, which decrease the catalytic capability.23,24 Moreover, nanoparticles usually give birth to problems of separation and reutilization.25 Therefore, it is difficult to improve photocatalytic performance of TiO2 just by fabricating nanostructures.
Nowadays, many scientists pay attention to preparing optical structures to enhance light absorption by photon confinement and scattering.9,26 Zhou et al. fabricated hierarchical structures utilizing leaves as templates. The rate in splitting water of the artificial leaf was 3.3 times higher than that of P25 due to a high light scattering effect and N self-doping of the artificial leaf structures.17 However, this method is restricted for its application by its template resource and lab-scale fabrication. Herein, we fabricated a hierarchical structure of TiO2 material combining a photonic crystal (PC) structure and sphere structure. The inverse opal TiO2 photonic crystal (i-TiO2-PC) microspheres combined the advantages of slow photons in PCs and strong scattering in microspheres that had high photocatalytic capability. Moreover, our fabrication method provided a low-cost and facile strategy to fabricate this kind of TiO2 material with high efficient photocatalytic performance in bulk, which showed promise for fabrication and application of photocatalysis materials.
PCs are novel materials with effective optical structures and have attracted intense interest in the photocatalysis field. The PC is an ordered periodic dielectric material with a latex constant in the wavelength scale.27 Moreover, PC has photonic stop band for certain frequencies, and can slow down the light group velocity near the stop band.28–30 The slow photon effect can enhance the interaction between photons and materials. If the photons are located in the red or blue edge of the stop band, the light will interact more strongly with the high or low dielectric component correspondingly.31,32 In our previous work, Pt-loaded hierarchical TiO2 PC photocatalysts doubled the hydrogen evolution in comparison with nanocrystalline TiO2 due to the synergetic enhancement of slow photons of the PC and multiple scattering among the segments.33 In this work, we present a TiO2 material with a more efficient optical structure combining the PC structure and sphere structure fabricated by spray drying. According to Mie scattering theory, spherical materials have better scattering ability than the planar segment.34 The i-TiO2-PC microsphere materials with spherical structure are able to further enhance the scattering and achieve better photocatalytic capability. The i-TiO2-PC microspheres can combine the advantages of slow photons in the PC and strong scattering of the microspheres. The prepared i-TiO2-PC microspheres have good stability, permeability and large surface area, which help show high efficiency in water treatment. With the scattering and slow photon synergetic effects, the new structures show excellent photocatalytic capability demonstrated by photodegrading methylene blue (MB) under UV illumination. Under the optimized conditions, the rate constant of the hierarchical structure is ca. 1.66 times larger than that of Degussa P25.
Experiment section
Synthesis of hierarchically i-TiO2-PC spheres
Monodispersed core–shell P(St-MMA-AA) latex spheres were synthesized by emulsion polymerization using a modified method.35 The precursor suspensions were prepared by mixing TiBALDH solution (Sigma-Aldrich) with PS latex spheres with different sizes: 184, 222, 260, 309, and 364 nm. In aqueous solution, the PS concentration was 5% and template-to-precursor volume ratio was 74:39, which was selected from the optimized results of several different ratios of 74:26, 74:39, 74:52, and 74:78. Precursor suspensions were sonicated for 15 minutes to ensure that both the PS particles and the Ti precursor were well-dispersed in the suspensions. The lab spray dryer (YC-015 from Shanghai Pilotech Instrument & Equipment Co., Ltd) was set with an inlet temperature of 200 °C, air-blower relative rate of 80, De-block piston relative frequency of 10 and pump relative rate of 60. The suspensions were sprayed by the nebulizer, dried by the heated carrier air in the tubular furnace, and collected after a cyclone separator. The collected powder was calcined in an oven at 450, 500, 600, 700, 750, 800 °C for 4 hours at a ramp rate of 1 °C min−1. In addition, the P25 spheres were obtained by spraying P25 nanoparticle suspensions with a concentration of 2 wt%.
Materials characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken by a JEOL FE-SEM 6700F microscope operating at 3.0 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 X-ray powder diffractometer using a high-power Cu KR radiation. Reflective spectra were retrieved from a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 apparatus at −196 °C. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed at 250 °C for 10 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area. Reflective spectra were obtained from Shimadzu UV-2450 UV-Vis spectrophotometer in air. The reflective spectra for i-TiO2-PC spheres cannot be retrieved directly, due to their small dimensions and strong scattering. Their reflective spectra were represented by that of planar PCs. The PCs were prepared by coassembling PS spheres and a Ti precursor with a volume ratio 74:39 in constant temperature (60 °C) and humidity (60%), and following calcination at 700 °C for 4 hours at a ramp rate of 1 °C min−1.33
Photocatalytic testing
In the photocatalytic process, 50 mg samples were firstly activated for 30 min under monochromic light irradiation (365 ± 5 nm, STL118/20D UV Lamp, Power 20 W). The activated samples were dispersed in 50 mL 0.1 mmol L−1 MB aqueous solutions for investigating samples at different calcination temperatures, as well as in 50 mL 0.2 mmol L−1 MB aqueous solutions for researching samples with different stop bands. After stirring in the dark for 30 minutes to reach adsorption equilibrium, the suspensions were illuminated under UV light. Degradation was monitored by taking aliquots at increasing time intervals. These aliquots were centrifuged and then tested using a 25 Lambda UV-vis spectrometer. The rate of degradation was assumed to obey pseudo-first-order kinetics. The degradation rate constant, k (min−1), was obtained by a least squares fitting according to the equation, A = A0e−kt, where A was the intensity of the characteristic absorption peak of MB after degradation for a time of t (min), A0 was the initial intensity.36,37
Results and discussion
Fabrication and characterization of i-TiO2-PC spheres
The fabrication diagram of the hierarchical i-TiO2-PC spheres is presented in Fig. 1a. As the PS latex spheres were dispersed in an aqueous solution, the Ti precursor was chosen for its advantage of water solubility.38 The i-TiO2-PC spheres were obtained by spraying a mixed solution of PS latex spheres and Ti precursor aqueous solution with a spray dryer, followed by calcination.

(b) The as-prepared i-TiO2-PC spheres had strong light scattering ability. (c) Typical SEM images of the as-prepared PC spheres via spray drying showing the spherical patterns and the 3D hexagonally ordered arrangement of the PS latex spheres. (d) The 3D hexagonally ordered porous structures were obtained after removing the PS latex spheres. 

Fig. 1c shows the typical SEM images of the corresponding opal PC spheres in low and high resolution. The opal PC spheres were polydisperse and their diameters ranged from several to tens of micrometers. In each PC sphere, the PS latex spheres with diameters of 210 nm were arranged in a 3D hexagonally ordered structure. After the template was removed by calcination, i-TiO2-PC spheres with diameters ranging from 1 μm to 10 μm were formed and had 3D hexagonally ordered pores. In comparison of the sizes of the PC spheres, the average diameter of i-TiO2-PC spheres was smaller than that of their corresponding opal PC spheres. Simultaneously, the diameter of pores in i-TiO2-PC spheres was also smaller than that of PS spheres in opal PC spheres. The shrinkage was attributed to the decomposition of the precursor during the calcination process.
In traditional methods of fabricating inverse opal PCs, it always took a long time for templates to assemble or coassemble with a precursor on substrates under conditions of constant temperature and humidity.9,39 In our experiment, the process of spray drying was fast and on a large scale. Even though this process induced some order destruction (Fig. 1c and d), which resulted from the insufficient time for the PS spheres to assemble during the spraying, the defects had little influence on the properties and performance of the material. In addition, the i-TiO2-PC spheres showed very good stability for the structure without destruction during the photodegradation process (ESI,† Fig. S1).
Optimization of structure and performance for i-TiO2-PC spheres
The volume ratios of template-to-precursor have a great influence on the structure of the material. Since the volume fraction of latex spheres in opal PCs was approximately equal to the close-packing limit (74%) of FCC structures,40 four different ratios of template-to-precursor were chosen: (a) 74:26, (b) 74:39, (c) 74:52, (d) 74:78. The pores in the spheres obtained with a ratio of 74:26 (Fig. 2a) were disordered due to the excessive shrink of TiO2. The shrink resulted from a limited quantity of precursor and the great fraction of organic component in the precursor molecules. The spheres obtained with ratios of 74:39 and 74:52 (Fig. 2b and c) had a similar morphology of well-ordered pore arrangement. Nevertheless, the yield of the former (28.6%) was larger than that of the latter (23.1%). Due to the lower adhesion stress resulting from the larger precursor fraction in suspensions, the small spheres were prone to be produced and separated by the exhaust duct. When the ratio reached 74:78, the precursor was overfilled (Fig. 2d). Accordingly, the volume ratio of 74:39 for template-to-precursor was preferred.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of i-TiO2-PC spheres with different template-to-precursor volume ratios: (a) 74:26, (b) 74:39, (c) 74:52, and (d) 74:78. The ratios were designed based on the similarity of the volume fraction of spheres in opal PCs to the close-packing limit (74%) of FCC structures. The well-order 3D micropore framework can be obtained when the ratio of template-to-precursor is 74:39 and 74:52. 
In addition, the structure and crystalline phase of i-TiO2-PC spheres were subjected to calcination. Fig. 3 presents the SEM images of the i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres (the number denotes the template diameter of PS latex spheres) upon calcination at different temperatures: (a) 450 °C, (b) 500 °C, (c) 600 °C, (d) 700 °C, (e) 750 °C, (f) 800 °C. The spheres with calcination temperatures below 700 °C (Fig. 3a–e) showed well-ordered pore structures. At the calcination temperature of 800 °C (Fig. 3f), the structure of pores broke down and was attributed to the crystalline growth at elevated temperature.18
 Fig. 3  SEM images of i-TiO2-PC spheres subjecting to different calcination temperatures: (a) 450 °C, (b) 500 °C, (c) 600 °C, (d) 700 °C, (e) 750 °C, and (f) 800 °C. The 3D hexagonally ordered porous structures can be retained at temperatures below 750 °C. At the calcination temperature of 800 °C, the pores are broken due to the crystalline growth at elevated temperature. 
The XRD patterns of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres treated above calcination temperatures are shown in Fig. 4a. In the range 450 °C to 700 °C, the intensity and half-peak breadth of the anatase TiO2 peak (101, 2θ = 25.4°) increased with increasing calcination temperature. As the calcination temperature further increased, nevertheless, the intensity and half-peak breadth of the anatase TiO2 peak decreased. In addition, a new peak of rutile TiO2 (101, 2θ = 27.4°) appeared at 800 °C. The results indicated the transition from amorphous to anatase phase below the calcination temperature 700 °C and transition from anatase to rutile phase above 700 °C. The phase transition temperature was higher than that via a traditional base-catalysed preparation method, due to the suppression of phase transition and crystal growth by the organic component of protamine in TiBALDH molecules.41,42

(b) Pseudo first order rate constants of P25, sprayed spheres of P25 and as-prepared i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres subjecting to above calcination temperatures. The P25-spheres had superior photocatalytic performance than P25 nanocrystallines due to its better scattering ability. The sample of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres calcined at 700 °C had the best photocatalytic efficiency as a result of its higher anatase composition. 
To demonstrate the superior performance of the prepared i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres, the photocatalytic ability was investigated by photodegradation of the MB dye under UV irradiation (Fig. 4b). At calcination temperatures of 450, 500 and 600 °C, the rate constants for these samples were smaller than 0.02 min−1. With the calcination temperature increasing, more anatase formed, hence improving the photocatalytic performance. As the calcination temperature reached 700 °C, the rate constant reached 0.219 min−1, which was even larger than P25 (0.0918 min−1), the best commercial photocatalytic material.18 When the temperature exceeded 700 °C, some anatase phase transformed into rutile, hence weakening the photocatalytic performance. At temperatures of 750 °C and 800 °C, the rate constants were 0.120 min−1 and 0.131 min−1, respectively. Accordingly, the optimized calcination temperature was 700 °C in order to obtain the best photocatalytic performance.
In order to further enhance the performance of the materials, the stop band of PC was optimized to the absorption region of TiO2. In our experiment, a monochromatic light (365 ± 5 nm, the dotted line in Fig. 5a) corresponding to the excitation wavelength of anatase TiO2 was adopted. The samples with stop bands centered at 335, 351, 368, 380, and 432 nm were designed and achieved template sizes of 220, 260, 280, 308, and 360 nm, respectively. In the following text, the PC samples were marked by the template sizes. In Fig. 5a, it shows that the excitation spectra of TiO2 stands on the red edge of the stop band of i-TiO2-PC-260, and on the blue edge of i-TiO2-PC-308. Fig. 5b shows the apparent rate constants in photodegradation of MB by P25 nanoparticles as well as the i-TiO2-PC control sample with a stop band away from the absorption of TiO2, and with stop bands centered at the above wavelengths. It demonstrates that the apparent rate constants (0.0685 min−1) of i-TiO2-PC-260 with a stop band centered at 351 nm is the greatest and 1.66 times greater than that of P25 (0.0413 min−1).

Performance enhancement by Mie scattering and slow photons of i-TiO2-PC spheres
The i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres with a calcination temperature of 700 °C showed the best performance and were better than P25.
However, the specific surface area of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres (42.5 m2 g−1) was smaller than that of P25 (54 m2 g−1). In addition, the XRD pattern suggested that the calcination temperature of 700 °C was the best crystallization temperature for anatase. Moreover, the stop band of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres was away from the absorption of TiO2 so that the effect of slow photons was avoided. Consequently, the photocatalytic improvement should be attributed to the strong scattering of the i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres. The sideways and back scattering was able to prolong the path of light propagation, hence improving catalytic capability. In the following text, the scattering of materials will be analyzed by Mie theory with respect to intensity and angular scattering.
In order to investigate the influence of Mie scattering on the photocatalytic capability, the photodegradation system should satisfy some conditions: (1) frequencies of incident light are unchanged, (2) independent particles, which means the distance between particles should be more than 20 times than diameter of the particles, i.e. critical volume fraction of 0.056% for the particles, (3) no multiple scattering.34 In our reaction system, no parameters violated these requirements, as the UV lamp irradiated light with constant frequency and intensity, and the volume fraction for the particles was 0.025% (1 wt%). The scattering efficiencies for the particles in this paper were calculated by Mie functions.34,43
The scattering efficiencies with respect to the diameters of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres and P25 under the illumination of UV light of wavelength 365 nm were calculated (Fig. 6). For the i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres, their effective refractive index was 1.29 calculated via formula: neff = (nTi2fmed + nmed2fmed)1/2, where nTi and nmed referred to the refractive index of anatase TiO2 and the medium respectively, and fTi and fmed were the volume fraction for TiO2 and medium respectively. The results suggested that the diameter of maximum scattering efficiency was 0.44 μm. As for the sample of i-TiO2-PC-180, the diameters of the spheres were distributed in the range 1 μm to 10 μm (inset (b) of Fig. 6), while the diameters of P25 nanoparticles were about 20 nm. The calculation results demonstrated that scattering efficiencies of the i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres (ca. several to 60 cm−1) were dramatically larger than P25 (ca. 0.1 to 0.6 cm−1). Therefore, the photocatalytic capability of i-TiO2-PC spheres was enhanced by light scattering.
 Fig. 6  Mie scattering efficiencies of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres and P25 with respect to the diameter of the spheres. The inset (a) represents the enlarged curve for P25 whose diameters are approximated to the range 15 to 25 nm. The inset (b) represents the size distribution of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres. 
The angular scattering for different diameters of particles was computed and analyzed (Fig. 7). Four sizes were chosen: 20 nm for the average size of P25, 440 nm for the size corresponding to the maximum scattering efficient, 1 μm and 5 μm for the minimum and medium sizes of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres, respectively. The results showed that the forward scattering decreased with decreasing diameter, while intensity of scattering in side angles increased with decreasing the diameter. If the photons were scattered to the side direction, the propagating path of the light was prolonged and the probability for the light to be absorbed was increased. Therefore, the reduced size of particles gave rise to more photons scattered in side angles so that the photodegradation efficiency was enhanced. Nevertheless, the particles shouldn't be too small because a small scattering intensity induced by the sizes would depress the catalytic capability. In consequence, the particle size should be optimized in a reasonable range. As for the sample of i-TiO2-PC-180, the sizes of spheres were mostly distributed in the range 1 to 5 μm. This size distribution not only had good scattering capability but also had good sideways scattering. With the improvement of Mie scattering, it showed that the rate constant of P25 sprayed spheres (0.156 min−1) was 1.7 times higher than that of P25 (0.0918 min−1).
 Fig. 7  Mie angular scattering of i-TiO2-PC spheres with different diameters: (a) 20 nm, (b) 440 nm, (c) 1 μm, and (d) 5 μm. With the diameter increasing, the light is superior to be scattered forwardly but inferior to be scattered sideways. 
In order to further demonstrate the superior photocatalytic performance of materials, the slow photon effect was also analyzed, in addition to scattering. The photocatalytic capabilities for i-TiO2-PC samples with different stop bands: 335 nm, 351 nm, 368 nm, 380 nm, 432 nm, were characterized (Fig. 5b). As illustrated in a previous part, the slow photons at the red edge of the stop band were able to enhance the interaction between the photons and TiO2, the high refractive index part. Therefore, the apparent rate constant (0.0685 min−1) of i-TiO2-PC-260 with a slow photon effect was larger than that of i-TiO2-PC-180 (0.0444 min−1) without that. In addition, the photocatalytic performance of i-TiO2-PC-280 (0.0570 min−1) was better than that of i-TiO2-PC-220 (0.0404 min−1), even though the specific surface area of former was smaller than that of the latter. The improvement resulted from the slow photons in the margins of the spheres, and the stop band position of this part showed blue shift for the angular dependence of PCs.44 Nevertheless, the photocatalytic performance of i-TiO2-PC-308 (0.0278 min−1) was inferior in comparison with that of i-TiO2-PC-360 (0.0346 min−1), even though the specific area of the former was greater than that of the latter. The efficiency reduction came from the suppression of slow photons that were located in the low dielectric medium. Accordingly, the results support that slow photons were able to enhance the photocatalytic performance of i-TiO2-PC.
Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented the fabrication and optimization processes of hierarchical i-TiO2-PC spheres. The rate constant in photodegrading MB of the i-TiO2-PC-260 material was ca. 1.66 times larger than that of Degussa P25. The enhancement of the performance was attributed to the synergetic effect of the Mie scattering for microspheres and slow photon effect of PC. The microscale inverse opal spheres were able to scatter light effectively, therefore, the light propagating path was prolonged, which improved its photocatalytic capability. The slow photons of PC enhanced the interaction between photons and TiO2 by locating the photons in the red edge of stop band of the materials. From the perspective of optical structure, the materials with a slow photon effect and light scattering are promising in enhancing the ability of pollutant elimination, light harvesting of solar cells, and conversion efficiency of hydrogen evolution.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of the rapid quantity fabrication process of hierarchical i-TiO2-PC spheres. The i-TiO2-PC spheres were obtained by a spray method and sacrificing template method. (b) The as-prepared i-TiO2-PC spheres had strong light scattering ability. (c) Typical SEM images of the as-prepared PC spheres via spray drying showing the spherical patterns and the 3D hexagonally ordered arrangement of the PS latex spheres. (d) The 3D hexagonally ordered porous structures were obtained after removing the PS latex spheres.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of i-TiO2-PC spheres with different template-to-precursor volume ratios: (a) 74:26, (b) 74:39, (c) 74:52, and (d) 74:78. The ratios were designed based on the similarity of the volume fraction of spheres in opal PCs to the close-packing limit (74%) of FCC structures. The well-order 3D micropore framework can be obtained when the ratio of template-to-precursor is 74:39 and 74:52.	 

 	Fig. 3  SEM images of i-TiO2-PC spheres subjecting to different calcination temperatures: (a) 450 °C, (b) 500 °C, (c) 600 °C, (d) 700 °C, (e) 750 °C, and (f) 800 °C. The 3D hexagonally ordered porous structures can be retained at temperatures below 750 °C. At the calcination temperature of 800 °C, the pores are broken due to the crystalline growth at elevated temperature.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) XRD patterns of the i-TiO2-PC-180 subjecting to different calcination temperatures: 450 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, and 800 °C. (b) Pseudo first order rate constants of P25, sprayed spheres of P25 and as-prepared i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres subjecting to above calcination temperatures. The P25-spheres had superior photocatalytic performance than P25 nanocrystallines due to its better scattering ability. The sample of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres calcined at 700 °C had the best photocatalytic efficiency as a result of its higher anatase composition.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Reflectance spectra of i-TiO2-PC spheres with stop bands centered at 335 nm, 351 nm, 368 nm, 380 nm, and 432 nm. The legend indicates the corresponding template sizes. The dotted line represents the emitting spectra of the UV lamp with a centered wavelength of 365 nm. (b) Apparent rate constants of P25 nanoparticles, i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres as a control sample, and i-TiO2-PC with the above stop bands. The photodegradation rate constants were averaged over three times.	 

 	Fig. 6  Mie scattering efficiencies of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres and P25 with respect to the diameter of the spheres. The inset (a) represents the enlarged curve for P25 whose diameters are approximated to the range 15 to 25 nm. The inset (b) represents the size distribution of i-TiO2-PC-180 spheres.	 

 	Fig. 7  Mie angular scattering of i-TiO2-PC spheres with different diameters: (a) 20 nm, (b) 440 nm, (c) 1 μm, and (d) 5 μm. With the diameter increasing, the light is superior to be scattered forwardly but inferior to be scattered sideways.
