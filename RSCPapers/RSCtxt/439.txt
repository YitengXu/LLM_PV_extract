    , Accepted 9th September 2015First published on 9th September 2015AbstractIn an effort to develop visible-light-driven heterostructured photocatalysts with high activity, a novel quantum-sized tubelike BiVO4 sensitized TiO2 microflower catalytic system was successfully fabricated by using a facile hydrothermal and ultrasonic adhering approach. The structural and optical properties of the as-prepared samples were comparatively characterized. The staggered band structure of quantum-sized BiVO4 decorated TiO2 not only extended the photo-response range but also promoted photoexcited charges transfer and separation. Photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared samples were examined by the degradation of toluene under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). Compared to the individual TiO2 microflower, BiVO4 quantum tube, BiVO4 nanoparticle and nano-BiVO4/TiO2, the quantum-BiVO4/TiO2 (Q-BiVO4/TiO2) composite exhibited higher photo activities. Electron spin resonance (ESR) examinations confirmed the generation of the photo-induced reactive oxygen species (˙OH and ˙O2−) which were involved in the photocatalytic process of Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composites. Furthermore, the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite mainly originated from the high separation efficiency of photo-induced electron–hole pairs and the efficient production of hydroxyl radicals. A detailed mechanism accounting for the superior photocatalytic activity was proposed in terms of the energy band structures of the components.
Introduction
Recently, the semiconductor-based photocatalytic oxidation process as an economical and environmentally friendly technology has emerged as an important approach in environmental pollutant remediation.1 Generally, the process features that when a semiconductor photocatalyst system is exposed to light of sufficient energy, the absorption of photons by the semiconductor provokes electron–hole pairs and consequently induces photocatalytic reactions at its surface.2–4 Among all kinds of semiconductor photocatalysts, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has proved to be the most promising photocatalyst in heterogeneous photocatalysis owing to its unique characteristics like chemical stability, low cost and nontoxicity.5,6 However, the low utilization efficiency of solar energy and rapid recombination of photo-generated charge carriers result in the limitation of its practical applications.7 Among the many modification strategies developed, coupling with a narrow band gap semiconductor to form a heterojunction8–10 proves to be effective for expanding the spectral range of light-absorption and promoting the separation of photo-induced charge carriers.11,12
As a unique nanomaterial, quantum-sized semiconductors with some unusual properties including quantum confinement effects and multiple exciton generation effects have attracted wide research attention.13,14 Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, PbSe and SnO2 have been assembled onto a host semiconductor and then used for photoconversion-related technology with great success. People have fabricated heterojunction systems using the above-mentioned quantum-sized semiconductor sensitized TiO2 for photocatalytic applications.15–20 Alternatively, monoclinic BiVO4 (m-BiVO4) has received continuous and consistent attention due to its narrow band gap (2.4 eV), favorably positioned band edges, high stability and excellent performance for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and the evolution of O2.21–26 However, poor charge separation and charge transport abilities are intrinsic short comings of m-BiVO4. In order to achieve more effective separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs, controlling morphologies, and the formation of heterojunctions have been considered as the optional strategies.27–31 It has been noticed by the authors that Professor Grätzel once quantitatively integrated the behavior of the photo-induced charge carrier by employing mathematical equations. By referring to the equation τ = r2/π2D, where τ is the average diffusion time from the bulk to the surface of the photo-generated carriers, r is the grain radius and D is the diffusion coefficient of the carrier,32 it would be easy to find that reducing the grain size could be favorable for rapid transfer of photo-induced charges from bulk to the surface. The carrier mobility is low for the pure BiVO4, however, which could be compensated by an unexpectedly long carrier lifetime for certain charge diffusion length. Based on the carrier lifetime, τ, and the carrier mobility, μ, the carrier diffusion length L of BiVO4 has been estimated, given by L = (Dτ)1/2 with D = kTμ/e, of ∼70 nm.33,34 These considerations inspired us to further investigate the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 modified by quantum-sized BiVO4.
On the other hand, taking into consideration the extensive industrial manufacture and wide application of chemical products, the environment we are living in has been seriously polluted by various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Among various VOCs, toluene is regarded as a ubiquitous hazardous reagent due to its environmental persistence and high toxicity, which has severely threatened human health.35,36 Semiconductor-based photocatalytic oxidation has been considered to be one of the most promising ways of removing toluene toxic species from air.
Herein, the quantum-sized m-BiVO4 tube was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. To utilize visible light efficiently and promote the separation of photo-induced charge carriers, the quantum tubes of m-BiVO4 were employed as the semiconductor sensitizer, combined with the prepared hierarchical architectured TiO2 microflowers with large surface area. The crystal structure, morphology, and optical properties of the as-prepared TiO2 microflower, m-BiVO4 quantum tube and quantum-BiVO4/TiO2 (Q-BiVO4/TiO2) catalysts were comparatively investigated. Electron spin resonance spectrum (ESR) investigations clearly revealed that the heterostructure between the quantum-sized BiVO4 and TiO2 microflower could efficiently generate reactive oxide species including the pretty active hydroxyl radical, which significantly enhanced the photooxidation degradation of toluene species.
Experimental section
Synthesis of TiO2 microflowers
All of the chemical reagents (Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd, China) were of analytical grade and used without further purification. TiO2 microflowers were prepared according to the previously reported hydrothermal method.37 In a typical synthesis, 2.4 mL tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) and 12 mL glycerol were added to 36 mL of absolute ethanol with magnetic stirring, respectively, the two as-prepared solutions were mixed together, followed by stirring for 10 min, and then the mixture was transferred into a 120 mL Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 °C for 24 h. After hydrothermal processing, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally. Subsequently the obtained samples were collected and washed with ethanol, and then dried at 80 °C overnight. The samples were finally annealed in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 3 h at a ramp rate of 1 °C min−1. As a result, the pristine anatase TiO2 microflowers were obtained.
Synthesis of BiVO4 quantum tubes
Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Na3VO4·12H2O, and sodium oleate were purchased from Shanghai Reagent Company and used as purchased without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 1.2 mmol sodium oleate were added to 20 mL distilled water and then 0.4 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was put into the dispersion of sodium oleate under vigorous stirring for ca. 10 min. Then, an aqueous solution (20 mL) of Na3VO4·12H2O (0.4 mmol) was injected into the above solution. After vigorous stirring for 60 min, the mixture was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed and heated at 100 °C for 12 h. The system was then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The obtained products were collected and washed with n-hexane and absolute ethanol repeatedly, and finally dried under vacuum at 40 °C overnight for further characterization.
Synthesis of Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composites
15 mg BiVO4 quantum tubes, 200 mg TiO2 microflowers and 60 mL cyclohexane were added into a 100 mL beaker and the mixture was sonicated for about 30 min. The dispersion was vigorously stirred for about 2 h at room temperature, and then stirred at 80 °C in an oil bath pot to evaporate the cyclohexane. Finally, the prepared product was collected for further characterization.
Photocatalyst characterization
The morphology of the as-prepared samples was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOLJSM-6360LV microscope) with an accelerating voltage of 30.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed at room temperature on a JEOL JEM-2000 EX electron microscope, using an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was conducted on an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 microscope, operating at 300 kV. The purity and crystalline phases of the as-prepared samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/Max 2550VB/PC diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source, which operated at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5600 electron spectrometer with Al Kα radiation at 1486.6 eV under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. All of the binding energies were calibrated by using surface adventitious carbon (C 1s at 285.38 eV) as a reference. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the samples were measured on an UV-vis spectrophotometer (JASCO, UV-550). The photoluminescence (PL) characteristics were probed on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature (excited at λ = 325 nm). ESR signals of reactive oxide species were detected on a Bruker ECS106 X-Band spectrometer, which were generated in the photocatalytic system with radical spin-trapped reagent 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pirroline-N-oxide (DMPO) (purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.). The irradiation source was a high-pressure xenon short arc lamp (a Phillips 500 W Xe lamp) with a UV-cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm), and the light intensity at the illumination position is 120 mW cm−2. To reduce the experimental errors, the identical quartz capillary tube was used throughout the ESR measurements. Typical experimental conditions: temperature = 298 K, center field = 3400 G, sweep width = 300 G, frequency = 9.865 GHz, modulation amplitude = 1.00 G, and microwave power = 20 mW.
Photocatalytic activity evaluation
Photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the photocatalytic decomposition of toluene under visible-light illumination in a homemade quartz reaction cell about 160 mL, which is equipped with two KBr windows and a sample holder (diameter, 13 mm) for the catalyst wafer (20 mg). The reaction atmosphere was air whose relative humidity was 45%, and the reaction temperature was about 35 °C. After the catalyst wafer was placed in the sample holder, a small quantity of toluene (4 μL) was injected into the reactor with a microsyringe. After the toluene fully volatilized, and subsequently reached adsorption equilibrium in the reactor, the Xenon lamp (XQ-500W) with a 400 nm UV-cutoff filter was turned on. In situ FTIR spectra of the photocatalytic reaction of reactant on catalysts were recorded using a FTIR spectrometer (Bruker VERTEX 70-FTIR). All the IR spectra were recorded over accumulative 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the range of 4000–600 cm−1. The concentrations of toluene were detected by using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) equipped with a FID (HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 320 μm × 0.25 μm)) and a TCD (Porapak Q).
Results and discussion
The morphologies and crystal structures of the as-synthesized BiVO4 quantum tube, TiO2 microflower and Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite were characterized by SEM, TEM, and HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 1a, the obtained m-BiVO4 appears as tiny tubes with high uniformity on a large scale. The magnified TEM image (Fig. 1b) illustrates that the m-BiVO4 quantum tubes have a uniform hollow structure with an ultranarrow diameter of ca. 5 nm, an ultrathin wall thickness of ca. 1 nm and a length of ca. 30 nm. Moreover, the corresponding HRTEM image in Fig. 1c evidences the crystalline structure of the BiVO4 quantum tube. The measured lattice fringes of 0.312 and 0.254 nm match well with the (103) and (020) crystallographic planes of m-BiVO4. As shown in Fig. 1d, the TiO2 microflower is hierarchical and composed of several dozen nanopetals consisting of interconnected nanoparticles (see the inset of the TEM image). The typical SEM and TEM images of the resultant Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite are displayed in Fig. 1e. It can be seen that the BiVO4 quantum tube has been uniformly deposited onto the TiO2 surfaces. An HRTEM image from the area marked by the yellow ellipse in Fig. 1e indicates that the observed lattice fringe spacings of 0.352 and 0.254 nm correspond to the (110) plane of anatase TiO2 and the (020) plane of monoclinic BiVO4, respectively (Fig. 1f), which reveals that the composite is highly crystallized. The above observations suggest that BiVO4 quantum tubes have been successfully combined with the TiO2 microflower and the heterojunction microstructure in the fabricated composite is formed.

Fig. 2 displays the XRD patterns of the as-prepared BiVO4 quantum tubes, TiO2 microflowers and Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composites. In Fig. 2a, the XRD pattern of BiVO4 matches well with monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS no. 75-2480) and the diffraction peaks at 2θ of 18.98°, 28.59° 28.80°, 30.53°, 35.19° and 47.27° could be indexed to the (011), (103), (112), (004), (020) and (024) crystal planes of monoclinic BiVO4, respectively.

Furthermore, the broad nature of the XRD peaks indicates the presence of the small-sized particles, which is consistent with the result of BiVO4 TEM images. From Fig. 2b, it can be seen that the as-synthesized pure TiO2 powder could be assigned to the anatase phase (JCPDS No. 71-1166). The diffraction peaks of the TiO2 microflower are sharp and intense, suggesting that the catalyst is highly crystalline. The XRD peak positions of TiO2 do not change, which demonstrates that the introduction of quantum-sized BiVO4 causes no impact on the crystal phase and crystallinity of TiO2. However, in the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite, no significant peaks of BiVO4 can be observed, which could be ascribed to its broadband of diffraction pattern with low intensity compared to TiO2 and high dispersion.
XPS was employed to further analyze the surface chemical composition and chemical status of elements in the as-prepared samples. Fig. 3a presents the survey spectra of the TiO2 microflower and Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite. Compared with the spectrum of the pure TiO2, new peaks for Bi and V elements are observed with Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composites. In Fig. 3b, the high-resolution Ti 2p spectrum presents two peaks at binding energies of 458.6 (Ti 2p3/2) and 464.3 eV (Ti 2p1/2), which are assigned to Ti4+ in anatase titania.38 It is indicated that the loading of BiVO4 quantum tubes exerts no significant influence on the chemical status of Ti elements. Two bands at binding energies of 159.1 eV and 164.4 eV can be respectively ascribed to the Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2, confirming that the bismuth species in the composite are Bi3+ cations (Fig. 3c).30 From Fig. 3d, it is found that the peaks at 516.8 eV (V 2p3/2) and 524.2 eV (V 2p1/2) are the split signal of V 2p, assignable to the V5+ oxidation state.39Fig. 3e and f show the high-resolution O 1s spectra for the TiO2 microflower and Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite. In Fig. 3e, the asymmetrical O 1s signal is fitted into two bands at 529.9 eV and 530.9 eV, which can be attributed to the lattice oxygen (Ti–O) and surface hydroxyl groups (O–H), respectively.40,41 However, in Fig. 3f, the asymmetrical O 1s signal of the composites can be fitted into three peaks at the band energies of 529.8 eV, 531.7 eV and 533.2 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen (Ti–O), the oxygen species of lattice oxygen of Bi–O bands and surface adsorbed oxygen species as hydroxyl-like group or O− defect oxide, respectively.42 Therefore, the result of the XPS analysis further confirms the existence of BiVO4 in the composite powders, consistent with those results of the XRD and HRTEM characterizations.

The optical absorption properties of the as-prepared samples were measured by UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra. As shown in Fig. 4a, in contrast with the pure TiO2 that has a steep absorption edge at approximately 410 nm, the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite exhibits a distinct red-shift, whose absorption edge extends to the visible wavelength of 520 nm. The band-gap energy of the obtained photo-active components can be estimated from the Tauc's plots by the following equation (αhν) = A(hν − Eg)n/2, where α is the absorption coefficient near the absorption edge, h is Planck's constant, A is a constant, ν is the light frequency, and Eg is the absorption band gap energy. Among them, n is 1 and 4 for a direct and indirect band gap semiconductor, respectively, depending on the characteristics of the transition in a semiconductor.43 Plots of (αhν)2versus hν of the samples are presented in Fig. 4b. The intercept of the tangent to the X axis exhibits a good approximation of the band gap energy of the samples. The band gaps of TiO2 and BiVO4 are respectively estimated to be about 3.15 eV and 2.65 eV. Herein, the band gap of BiVO4 is higher than those reported in literature,22,44 due to the quantum confinement effect of the quantum-sized BiVO4. Besides, the absorption edge of the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite is about 2.9 eV, suggesting that incorporation of the BiVO4 quantum tubes could enhance the visible light absorption of pure TiO2.

PL emission results from the irradiative recombination of the excited charges. Semiconductor photocatalysts with lower PL intensity usually possess strong photocatalytic activity due to the high separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs.45 The PL characteristics of the samples were studied to reveal the interfacial charge transfer dynamics. Herein, the room-temperature PL spectra were measured in air at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm, which could excite TiO2 at the same time. As shown in Fig. 5, the typical emission peaks appear around 400 nm and 468 nm. The emission band at 400 nm can be attributed to band-edge emission of free excitons. The luminescence peak around 467 nm originates from the surface-state related recombination of the electron–hole pairs in the TiO2 microflower, BiVO4 quantum tube and BiVO4/TiO2 composite.46,47 In Fig. 5, the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 samples exhibit diminished PL intensity in comparison with pure TiO2 and BiVO4, which indicates that the loading of BiVO4 results in a remarkable decline in the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs.

In situ FTIR analysis
FTIR is an available technique for mechanistic studies due to its high sensitivity and relatively rapid response, which can be used to monitor the transient events adsorbed on the surface of catalysts during the reaction on a real-time.48,49 The reaction process of the partial photo-oxidation of toluene in gas–solid regime was studied by in situ FTIR spectra. When toluene reached adsorption equilibrium on the surface of the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 wafer, the system was irradiated with visible light (λ > 400 nm). A set of IR absorption spectra yielded by toluene degradation is shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  
In situ FTIR spectra of toluene photo-oxidation on the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite collected at different illumination times under the visible-light irradiation. 
Before visible-light irradiation (t = 0), the characteristic absorption bands of toluene appearing at 3075, 3037, 2936, 2883, 1611 and 1500 cm−1 are very strong (Fig. 6a). The bands in the 3100–2880 cm−1 range are assigned to the C–H stretching mode of the aromatic ring (3075 and 3073 cm−1) and methyl stretching vibration (2937 and 2884 cm−1), while bands at 1611 and 1500 cm−1 are assigned to the skeleton stretching vibrations of the aromatic ring.50,51 As the irradiation time extended, a decreasing intensity of characteristic bands of toluene was observed and after 6 h, most of the toluene was decomposed. Simultaneously the bands corresponding to CO2 (2360 and 2340 cm−1) became stronger and some new adsorbed surface species were formed with the photocatalytic reaction proceeding, as evidenced by the FTIR spectra in Fig. 6c. New bands appeared at 1690, 1675, 1660, 1640, 1630, 1550, 1530 and 1512 cm−1. Among them, the bands located at 1690, 1675 and 1660 cm−1 are related to the stretching vibration of the aldehydes, indicating the formation of benzaldehyde. The bands at 1640 and 1630 cm−1 are assigned to the scissor vibration modes of adsorbed water. In addition, the appearance of bands at 1512, 1530 and 1550 cm−1, which are attributed to asymmetric stretching vibration of the carboxylate group COO−, implies the presence of some benzoic acid. Besides, as the reaction proceeded, the band centered at 1455 cm−1 split into two bands at 1445 and 1465 cm−1 related to benzyl alcohol, and their intensity decreased, suggesting that the formed benzyl alcohol was oxidized by activated oxygen species.52–54 In Fig. 6e, the bands appearing in the 3750–3600 cm−1 range are related to hydroxyl groups present on the catalyst surface, which play different roles in the photocatalytic oxidation process. The surface hydroxyls with absorption bands at 3696, 3683, 3660 and 3640 cm−1, corresponding to bridged –OH, act as adsorption sites. Meanwhile, the bands at 3740, 3728, 3715 and 3704 cm−1 are due to terminal hydroxyls that can trap photo-generated holes, which act as the sources of ˙OH radicals. Besides, the band at 3623 cm−1 is assigned to OH bending mode.55,56Fig. 6b, d and f more clearly describe the concentration changes of toluene, intermediates, CO2 and H2O species with time. According to the above results and previous reports,54,57 toluene could be partially photo-oxidized to benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. Meanwhile, it was partially mineralized into carbon dioxide and water.

Fig. 7 displays the photocatalytic degradation of toluene over different samples. According to the result of a blank experiment (without photocatalyst), the self-photolysis of toluene could be neglected. For the commercial P25, the pure TiO2 microflower, BiVO4 nanoparticle and nano-BiVO4/TiO2, the conversion of toluene is about 12%, 38%, 56% and 69% after 6 h of visible-light irradiation, respectively. However, for the individual BiVO4 quantum tubes, the conversion of toluene is about 76%. After the incorporation of BiVO4 quantum tubes into TiO2 microflowers, the photocatalytic performance improved remarkably compared with the single-component samples and the nano-BiVO4/TiO2. The conversion of toluene over the composite was as high as 89% under the same conditions. A pseudo-first-order decay kinetic model was employed to fit the degradation data by following the linear transformation: ln(C0/Ct) = F(t) = kt (k is the first-order kinetic constant), as shown in Fig. 7b. The apparent toluene degradation constant (3.65 × 10−1 h−1) over the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composites was about 3.3 and 1.8 times of that over TiO2 and nano-BiVO4/TiO2. It is also shown that the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of toluene over Q-BiVO4/TiO2 is much higher than that of the individual TiO2 and nano-BiVO4/TiO2 composite. The improvement is partially due to the introduction of the quantum-sized BiVO4, which extends the spectral response and reduces the recombination of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs.

Mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic performance
The reactive oxygen species, especially hydroxyl radical (˙OH) and superoxide anion radicals (˙O2−) have been considered to be the key species in the photocatalytic decomposition of many hazardous organic compounds due to their high reaction activity. ESR measurements are usually employed to explore the reactive oxygen species evolved during the photocatalytic process. Fig. 8 displays ESR spin-trap signals (with DMPO) of the as-prepared samples in two different dispersions. As shown in Fig. 8a, four distinct characteristic peaks with intensity 1:2:2:1 for the DMPO–˙OH adduct were observed with the suspensions of the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite under the visible light illumination, indicating that the ˙OH radical was produced efficiently. However, under identical conditions, no such signals were detected with aqueous dispersions of the BiVO4 quantum tube, TiO2 microflower and in the dark. From Fig. 8b, the six characteristic peaks of the DMPO–˙O2− adducts were detected for the visible-light irradiated methanol suspensions of Q-BiVO4/TiO2, the BiVO4 quantum tube and TiO2 microflower, while the intensity of such signal for methanol dispersions of TiO2 microflower is very weak. In addition, compared with the BiVO4 quantum tube, the observed intensity of DMPO–˙O2− adducts for the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite was pretty stronger.

ESR results confirm that ˙OH and ˙O2− were produced in the visible light irradiated suspensions of the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite; ˙OH radicals with strong oxidation capability acted as the predominant active species, which induced the degradation of organic pollutants. Furthermore, it is strongly indicated that the photo-induced electron–holes in the Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite are long-lived enough to react with adsorbed oxygen and surface hydroxyl groups to produce reactive oxygen species, implying the effective separation of the photo-generated charges and the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity.58
To explain the photocatalytic mechanism based on the electronic structures, a schematic illustration of interparticle photo-generated charge transfer behavior is shown in Fig. 9.

The band edge positions of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of a semiconductor can be determined through the equation:59ECB = χ − E0 − 1/2Eg, where χ is the absolute electronegativity of the compound (χ is 5.9 eV and 6.04 eV for TiO2 and BiVO4, respectively). E0 is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV) and Eg is the band gap of the semiconductor. The band gap of BiVO4 and TiO2 was respectively evaluated as 2.65 eV and 3.15 eV from the UV-vis spectra. Thus, the calculated CB and VB edges of BiVO4 were 0.21 and 2.86 eV, and of TiO2 were −0.17 eV and 2.98 eV, respectively. However, similar to the metal–semiconductor contact in a Schottky junction,60–62 the interfacing of two semiconductors with different band structures leads to the charge redistribution equilibrating Fermi level.63 Theoretically, it is assumed that two Fermi levels approach consistency under thermal equilibrium.64–66 When the two semiconductor materials (BiVO4 and TiO2) are joined together and the heterostructure is formed, the Fermi levels of two components would achieve consistency.67–69 As a consequence, the CB and VB of BiVO4 shift upward, lying above that of TiO2. When the system is irradiated under visible light (>400 nm), lots of high-energy electrons in the VB of BiVO4 are excited to the CB as holes are generated in the VB. Because the CB edge potential of BiVO4 is more negative than that TiO2, the photo-generated electrons tend to migrate toward the CB of TiO2, which results in the gathering of a large number of excess electrons in the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore, the photo-induced electrons and holes can be separated efficiently through the interface, which can react with the adsorbed O2 and surface hydroxyls respectively to yield active radical species. Subsequently, the radicals could be transformed into strong oxidative reactive species (˙OH) that are mainly responsible for the degradation and mineralization of the adsorbed pollutants.
Visible-light excited high-energy electrons in BiVO4 can thermodynamically transfer to the CB of TiO2, prolonging the charge lifetime and promoting the separation. Furthermore, the implanted quantum-sized dimension of BiVO4 tubes merit short diffusion path for the transfer of photo-induced charges, which is beneficial for the enhancement of the photocatalytic reactivity. Therefore, for the fabricated Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite, more separated charges will reach the surface and drive the subsequent photocatalytic reactions, consequently, making it exhibit much higher photocatalytic activities than individual TiO2 and BiVO4 as well as nano-BiVO4/TiO2.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized a quantum-sized tubelike BiVO4 photocatalyst, and then constructed the heterostructured Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite via an easily accessible route. The introduction of quantum-sized m-BiVO4 not only made the photoresponse extend to the visible region but also played a key role in promoting the generation of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs and their efficient separation across the interface between BiVO4 and TiO2 under visible light. Compared to pure TiO2 and BiVO4, Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composites could generate lots of hydroxyl radicals. The Q-BiVO4/TiO2 composite is expected to improve the ability of mineralization for volatile organic pollutants, and further be utilized as a new visible-light-harvesting photocatalyst for practical applications.
