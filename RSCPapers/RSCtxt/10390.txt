    , Accepted 13th March 2020First published on 14th March 2020AbstractThe development of thermoelectrics for high-temperature applications imposes several essential requirements on the material properties. In some energy-conversion scenarios, the cost and thermal stability requirements may dominate over efficiency issues, making abundant, high-temperature-stable and low-toxic oxides attractive alternative thermoelectric materials. As compared to “traditional” thermoelectrics, oxides possess unique redox flexibility and defect chemistry, which can be precisely tuned by external temperature and oxygen partial pressure conditions. This work aims to demonstrate how, by redox-sensitive substitutions, the thermoelectric properties of oxides can be tuned and enhanced. The proposed strategy is exemplified by considering molybdenum-containing strontium titanate within nominally single-substituted and nanocomposite concepts. The involved materials design allows us to proceed from an in-depth understanding of the redox-promoted effects to the demonstration of the enhanced thermoelectric performance attained by redox engineering. Synergistic enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and suppression of the thermal conductivity due to combined carrier filtering effects and efficient phonon scattering at redox-induced interfaces provided up to 25% increase in the thermoelectric performance. The results demonstrate extraordinary flexibility of the perovskite lattice towards retaining a rich combination of the molybdenum redox states and shifting their ratio by tuning the A-site stoichiometry, and the prospects for developing new materials combining thermoelectric and (electro)catalytic functionalities.
1. Introduction
Thermoelectrics harvesting has emerged as a promising alternative green technology, with prospects for the conversion of waste or solar heat into electricity by reliable, sustainable and scalable devices, taking advantage of self-sufficiency to enable mobile or remote applications.1 The range of potential applications that thermoelectrics can serve well today is limited mostly by relatively low conversion efficiency of the known materials,2 which can be represented by the dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT = σ × α2/κ × T, determined by basic physical properties: electrical and thermal conductivity (σ and κ), and the Seebeck coefficient (α). Those “niche” applications include electricity generation in extreme and remote environments with limited maintenance capability, waste heat recovery in internal combustion engines, decentralized combined heat and power generation systems in developing countries. A particular emphasis is given to renewable energies, and micro-generation for sensors and microelectronics, where the required power levels are relatively low.3 Research on STEG (Solar Thermoelectric Generator) technology is flourishing4–6 and is considered promising for both concentrated and non-concentrated systems, with a particular emphasis given to various hybrid concepts involving photovoltaics.5,7
“Traditional” Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3 and PbTe thermoelectrics, half-Heusler alloys, intermetallic Zintl phases, skutterudites and some silicon-based alloys demonstrate a suitable performance (ZT ≈ 1) to cover low- and intermediate-temperature-application ranges.8–10 However, most of these materials lack the thermal and chemical stability above ∼500–600 °C and/or require a protection/vacuum packing to operate at high temperatures under oxidizing conditions like air. Very attractive thermoelectric conversion efficiency in materials containing bismuth, tellurium, lead, antimony and germanium is actually compromised by their cost, toxicity and/or natural abundance.11
There is a compelling need for thermoelectric materials, based on abundant and less toxic components, capable of withstanding operation under high temperature conditions, which also allows achieving a higher Carnot efficiency, and under oxidizing conditions without disruptive phase transformations. Most of these requirements are inherent for semiconducting oxide materials,12,13 along with their unique redox flexibility which allows controlled engineering of their defect chemistry and phase composition by interaction with the atmosphere. It is also essential to define known excellent electrocatalytic properties of oxides. So far, in thermoelectric oxides this inherent property was considered only as a guideline for suitable operation conditions. It should be noticed that in “traditional” thermoelectrics the chemical interaction with the atmosphere is always detrimental and leads to degradation of thermoelectric performance.
Decoupling of the physically entangled electrical and thermal transport parameters towards enhanced thermoelectric performance in both “traditional” intermetallic and alternative oxide materials requires combined approaches comprising nanostructuring, mesostructuring, band alignment and engineering.14 While thermoelectrics now appear to be ready for another leap forward relying on new advances in physics outside the standard band transport model,15 one still can still consider some unique possibilities arising from the specificity of each material's family. Some evident guidelines for oxide-specific tailoring of their thermoelectric performance include: (i) switching the redox states of the cations affects the electronic band structure, (ii) redox-promoted phase transformations may have significant microstructural impacts, (iii) redox transformations can be frozen in metastable states. From known families of oxide thermoelectrics like layered cobaltites, manganites, delafossites and ZnO-based materials,12,13,16–18 strontium titanate represents probably the best model system for demonstrating the redox engineering approach. The latter is due to unprecedented stability of the SrTiO3 perovskite at an extremely wide range of temperatures and oxygen partial pressures, lattice flexibility for accommodating substituting cations and various defects, and possibility to freeze-in its high-temperature defect chemistry below 1473 K.13,19–28
The possibilities to achieve high thermoelectric performance in SrTiO3-based materials, reaching values around and above ZT = 0.4, were convincingly demonstrated in several studies.23,28–31
Introducing oxygen vacancies under highly-reducing conditions to generate charge carriers and enhance phonon scattering represents a known SrTiO3-specific redox tuning approach.28,32 Several approaches to introduce metallic nanoinclusions formed by reduction of oxide/salt precursors to improve the phonon scattering, charge carrier concentrations and mobility were demonstrated in ref. 33–35. However, these studies did not consider the possibility of partial retaining of the redox-sensitive cations in the perovskite structure and related effects, the corresponding changes in defect chemistry mechanisms and alternative ways for tuning the redox-promoted effects by shifting the A:B site stoichiometry. The current work explores those possibilities taking advantage of the rich redox chemistry of molybdenum, offering gradual valence changes in the versatile perovskite lattice and controlled nanostructuring retained even at very high temperatures. The proposed compositional design allows understanding the particular impacts provided by the redox-sensitive cation on the structural and transport properties, and demonstrates how these findings can be involved for a significant improvement of the thermoelectric performance.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Processing and sample preparation
Various compositions including nominal single-substituted SrTi0.97Mo0.03O3±δ, SrTi0.94Mo0.06O3±δ, Sr0.97Ti0.97Mo0.03O3±δ, Sr0.95Ti0.90Mo0.10O3±δ, and composite formulations based on A-site stoichiometric Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ and A-site deficient Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ matrixes with and without the addition of 10% mol MoO3 (Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo) were prepared via a solid-state route. This method has been chosen to minimize any additional nanostructuring effects imposed by the soft-chemistry-based preparation procedures on the structural and transport properties of the target ceramic samples. The following precursor powders were used: SrCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.9%), TiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%), La2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.9%) and MoO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%), more details of similar processing approaches to producing donor-substituted SrTiO3-based thermoelectrics can be found elsewhere.28,36 Accurately weighed precursor mixtures for obtaining single-substituted materials were milled with ethanol and calcined in air at 1173 K (2 h), 1273 K (5 h) and 1533 K (5 h) with intermediate re-grindings. One can employ the same route for the synthesis of pristine Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ. The Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo composites were prepared by accurate mixing of the above powders with MoO3, milling with alcohol and one more calcination step at 1533 K for 5 h in air. After the final calcination step in air, all powders were ball-milled with ethanol and dried. Thus the prepared samples are further referred to as “oxidized” or prepared under “oxidizing conditions”. The corresponding powders were isostatically pressed in the shape of disks and sintered under highly-reducing conditions (10% H2–90% N2 atmosphere at 1773 K for 10 h); these samples are further denoted as “reduced” or processed under “highly reducing conditions”. Part of the sintered ceramic samples was ground to fine powders for XRD analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Appropriate freshly-fractured pieces of the reduced ceramics were used for detailed SEM/EDS and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. Lamellae for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis were prepared by using a focused ion beam method (FIB) (Dual Beam Helios Nanolab 650) from dense ceramics. The thermal diffusivity and geometric density measurements were performed on disc-shaped ceramic samples of a similar thickness (∼1.00 mm). For the measurements of the electrical properties (electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient), the reduced ceramics were cut into rectangular bars.
2.2 Characterization
The identification of the phase composition was performed using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer (Cu Kα) in the range 2θ = 20–80° (a step of 0.02° and an exposition time of 200 s); the corresponding lattice parameters were calculated by a profile matching method in Fullprof software.37 The phase morphology and distribution were studied by SEM (Hitachi SU-70 instrument) and EDS (Bruker Quantax 400 detector) analyses. Scanning transmission electron microscopy with a high annular angular dark field (STEM-HAADF) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) were performed using FEI Tecnai F30 with a Field Emission Gun and a FEI Titan G3 X-FEG gun with a CETCOR Cs-probe corrector from CEOS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed at CEMUP (Materials Centre of the University of Porto) on a Kratos AXIS Ultra HSA spectrometer using monochromatized Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Potential deviations induced by electric charge of the samples were corrected using the C 1s band at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. XPS spectra were deconvoluted into individual components using symmetric Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shapes, except for molybdenum metal peaks which were fitted using an asymmetric line shape, after a Shirley-type background subtraction. The intensity ratios for spin–orbit splitting components of Ti 2p and Mo 3d doublets were constrained to 2:1 and 3:2, respectively.20,38 The relative contents of Ti and Mo oxidation states were calculated from the ratio of peak areas of the deconvoluted components to the corresponding total core-level peak area. XPS data treatment and quantitative analysis were performed using CasaXPS software. The total electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (α) were measured simultaneously in a flowing 10% H2–90% N2 mixture on stepwise cooling, more details of the corresponding procedures can be found elsewhere.20,39 Identical measurement profiles were implemented for thermal diffusivity (D) and specific heat capacity (Cp) studies, using Netzsch LFA 457 Microflash and Netzsch DSC 404 C equipment, respectively. Thermal conductivity (κ) was calculated using κ = DρCp, where ρ is the sample density. The Hall coefficients of the bulk samples with a typical dimension of 8 × 8 × 0.5 mm3 were measured under magnetic fields from −0.5 T to 0.5 T under the same atmosphere from 300 K to 873 K using the Hall measurement system IPM-HT-Hall (Fraunhofer IPM).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Assessment of the redox-tuning concept for single-substituted Sr(Ti,Mo)O3±δ
Understanding the principles to design thermoelectric oxides by involving their redox properties requires knowledge of the individual impacts on the electrical and thermal transport provided by the redox-sensitive cation, like molybdenum. These insights can be obtained by studying single-substituted compositions, where the variations in relevant mechanisms are mainly determined by the fraction of molybdenum cations, their oxidation states and the possible presence of A-site cation deficiency. Representative X-ray diffraction patterns of the Sr(Ti,Mo)O3±δ precursor powders processed in the air at 1533 K (Fig. 1A and B) indicate that under these conditions the SrTiO3 perovskite lattice cannot fully accommodate the molybdenum cations. The appearance of secondary SrMoO4 and rutile phases is driven by a compromise between the solubility of molybdenum cations in the B-sites, the tendency to form a relatively stable SrMoO4 scheelite40 and the presence of A-site deficiency. Taking into account that, under oxidising conditions, the charge compensation through the formation of Ti3+ species and oxygen vacancies is unlikely, the corresponding defect reaction following the Kröger–Vink formalism41 can be written as: (1)where ε accounts for the residual SrMoO4 content, η is the deviation from nominal A-site stoichiometry, and φ, ψ and (x − ε − φ − ψ) are the fractions of possible Mo6+, Mo5+ and Mo4+ species that can be substituted for Ti4+ in the perovskite lattice. Note that the deviation from the unit stoichiometric ratio η = 1 − Sr:(Ti + Mo) determines mainly segregation of rutile, rather than effective A-site deficiency in the perovskite lattice, which depends on the residual fraction of effectively charged Mo6+ and Mo5+ species in B-site positions. In addition, precipitation of the secondary phase SrMoO4 also implies a corresponding decrease in the perovskite unit cells. Thus, eqn (1) is written per 1 − η − ε perovskite cell to emphasize the co-segregation of rutile (η) and SrMoO4 (ε). A noticeable amount of SrMoO4 impurity even in SrTi0.97Mo0.03O3±δ suggests a low solubility of molybdenum in SrTiO3 under oxidising conditions, limited by the charge compensation constraints due to high expected oxidation states of molybdenum42 and titanium cations. The compensation is likely to involve the predominant formation of cation vacancies  and the corresponding extended defects including Ruddlesden–Popper-type faults (SrO)RP; this corresponds to well-known defect chemistry mechanisms in donor-substituted SrTiO3.20,22
 Fig. 1  Room-temperature XRD patterns of the oxidized (A and B) and reduced (C–F) Sr(Ti,Mo)O3±δ samples. The profile fitting results for reduced samples and the corresponding parameters are shown in (C–F). 
Nominal A-site deficiency (η) promotes the onset of the secondary rutile phase (Fig. 1B), while SrMoO4 dominates for the nominal stoichiometric ratio, i.e., Sr:(Ti + Mo) = 1:1, as shown for SrTi0.94Mo0.06O3±δ (Fig. 1A).
While the A-site cation content appears to provide certain flexibility in controlling the secondary phases, in all cases the XRD results confirm the expected formation of a cubic perovskite as a major phase; SrTi0.97Mo0.03O3±δ and Sr0.95Ti0.90Mo0.10O3±δ samples show similar tendencies for the phase composition when processed under oxidising conditions (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Thus, the final sintering step under a reducing atmosphere is essential for triggering thermoelectric performance in titanates, leading to more homogenous phase composition (Fig. 1C–F). Additional minor reflections corresponding to the (110) and (200) planes of metallic molybdenum are observed for A-site deficient compositions, but, surprisingly, were not detected for SrTi0.97Mo0.03O3±δ and SrTi0.94Mo0.06O3±δ. This indicates that reducing conditions yield close matching to the nominal stoichiometric ratio Sr:(Ti + Mo), minimizing the concentration of A-site vacancies, possibly because the highly stable perovskite structure of SrTiO3 allows flexible redox changes of Mo6+/Mo5+/Mo4+, and partial reduction to Ti3+ provides alternative charge compensation. Stabilization is expected by close matching between the ionic radii of Mo6+ (0.59 Å), Mo5+ (0.61 Å) or even Mo4+ (0.65 Å) with Ti4+ cations (0.605 Å).43 Otherwise, one should expect extensive reduction to metallic Mo, as reported for molybdenum trioxide, which reduces almost entirely to metallic molybdenum at temperatures around 1000 K within one hour44 in hydrogen, i.e., under somewhat milder reducing conditions than those imposed in the present work.
Additional XPS measurements provide a better insight into the actual redox composition of the reduced single-substituted Sr(Ti,Mo)O3±δ ceramic samples. The line shape of the Mo 3d spectra is rather complex, indicating the presence of multiple oxidation states (Fig. 2). Indeed, Mo 3d envelopes were deconvoluted into eight peaks, namely four spin–orbit doublets with splitting energy from the 3d5/2 to 3d3/2 sublevels of around 3.13 eV, following the literature data.38 These four spin–orbit components exhibit average binding energies at 227.8/230.9 (3d5/2/3d3/2), 230.5/233.6, 231.9/235.0 and 232.8/236.0 eV (Table S1 in ESI†) corresponding to Mo0, Mo4+, Mo5+ and Mo6+ oxidation states, respectively.38,45 Concerning the Ti 2p core level, high-resolution XPS spectra show typically two major peaks at 458.6 an 464.4 eV attributed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin–orbit doublets, respectively, of Ti4+ cations (Fig. S2 in the ESI†).20,46 The additional and low intense doublet observed at the low energy-side is assigned to Ti3+ cations.20,46 Quantitative estimates for the concentrations of molybdenum and titanium cations in various oxidation states, obtained by deconvolution of the corresponding contributions to the XPS spectra, are listed in Table S2 in the ESI.†

The obtained results unambiguously highlight a high versatility of the perovskite lattice, which allows such a rich interplay of the redox states, retained even after processing under highly-reducing conditions. The XPS quantification results (Table S2†) agree very well with the previous observation that the presence of A-site deficiency promotes segregation of metallic molybdenum, as suggested by the XRD data (Fig. 1D and F). The trends in the calculated lattice parameters (Table 1) also confirm the partial substitution of titanium with molybdenum.

The XPS results also suggest a higher concentration of Ti3+ in SrTi0.94Mo0.06O3, required to compensate the incorporation of donor species (Mo6+ and Mo5+), along with a larger unit cell volume as compared to SrTi0.97Mo0.03O3 (Table S2†). Thus, the formation of the defects in reduced Sr(Ti,Mo)O3±δ can be represented by the following mechanism: (2)where φr and ψr denote the fractions of Mo6+ and Mo5+ substituted for Ti4+ in reduced samples. Eqn (2) is written per (1 − η) perovskite cell to emphasize the impact of partial segregation of Mo. It is also a suitable description for both types of deviations from nominal stoichiometry, i.e. for Sr:(Ti + Mo) < 1, when nominal Sr-deficiency (η > ε) promotes segregation of metallic Mo, and for Sr:(Ti + Mo) > 1, when segregation exceeds the nominal Sr deficiency (ε > η) inducing extended defects.
The above results give only general guidelines regarding the defects in the reduced Sr(Ti,Mo)O3±δ without detailing their spatial distribution. This information is delivered by high-resolution STEM-HAADF studies, showing the contrast by atomic number. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows two regions with the same [1−10] zone axis which reveal significant inhomogeneities of the molybdenum substitution in the perovskite lattice. These atomic-level inhomogeneities are composed of the Mo-rich perovskite islands in the SrTiO3-based matrix, comprising 6-fold coordinated molybdenum cations, presumably in the 4+, 5+ and 6+ oxidation states. The question why these inhomogeneities appear may be addressed by coming back to the phase composition after processing under oxidising conditions (Fig. 1B), where the precursor powders contained a fraction of the SrMoO4 scheelite. The redox-induced transformation of the tetragonal SrMoO4 into the SrMoO3 cubic perovskite readily takes place at temperatures around 1000–1100 K (ref. 47) and involves losses of relatively mobile oxygen ions, while further random distribution of the molybdenum cations in the perovskite matrix can be kinetically impeded. Thus, the Mo-rich inhomogeneities in the SrTiO3 lattice might be inherited from the residual SrMoO4 formed during the pre-processing under the oxidising conditions: (3)
An example of the distribution of those inhomogeneities on a larger scale is shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Low-resolution STEM images of the reduced Sr0.97Ti0.96Mo0.06O3±δ lamella (A and B), showing areas analysed by the EDS line scan (orange line with a cross, C) and HRSTEM-HAADF (D–F). The intensity distribution of the STEM-HAADF signal along the yellow line (E) is shown in (F). 
A white contrast (Fig. 3A and B) bears a resemblance to the grain boundary interfaces, but, in fact, higher resolution images combined with the EDS line scan analysis (Fig. 3C–E) reveal a continuous structure with a transition from the SrTiO3 to SrMoO3 perovskite lattice. An increase in the intensity of the STEM-HAADF signal (Fig. 3F) from darker to the brighter area of the (111) plane (Fig. 3E) clearly shows this transition due to the higher atomic weight of molybdenum as compared to titanium. Such regions are continuously present in different sample locations, indicating their presumably uniform spatial distribution, with a potential suppressing effect on the phonon transport.
The combined SEM/EDS microstructural studies of the fractured Sr(Ti,Mo)O3±δ ceramics (Fig. S4 in ESI†) feature a relatively small grain size as compared to SrTiO3 with common donor-substituting redox-stable cations (e.g., ref. 20, 23, 27 and 48) and nanoscale segregation of the molybdenum nanoparticles, locally observed even in the case of SrTi0.94Mo0.06O3±δ. This reveals slight Mo exsolution even for nominal stoichiometry Sr:(Ti + Mo) = 1:1, apparently compensated by the local formation of Ruddlesden–Popper-type layers (SrO)RP (ε ≈ η). This mechanism is expected to contribute at least partially also in the case of A-site deficient compositions, in accordance with eqn (2). The formation of SrO-rich phases is known for hindering the grain growth in titanates.24 Similar small grains were also observed in the case of Sr(Ti,W)O3±δ ceramics processed under the same conditions,35 where tungsten represents another example of redox-sensitive cation showing an onset of the metallic phase on reduction. Contradictory to the known fact that the presence of A-site deficiency in other SrTiO3-based materials promotes better densification,24,49,50 the relative densities of Sr0.97Ti0.94Mo0.06O3±δ and Sr0.95Ti0.90Mo0.10O3±δ are relatively low as compared to the stoichiometric compositions (Table 1). A possible explanation for this finding may rely on ready reactivity of secondary phases SrMoO4 and TiO2, which were previously co-segregated by calcination under oxidising conditions (eqn (1)), on reverting to reducing conditions. This may facilitate the onset of highly dense metallic inclusions, hindering full densification: SrMoO4 + TiO2 → SrTiO3 + Mo + 1.5O2(4)
High refractoriness of molybdenum may explain its ex-solution on the nano- and submicron-scale.
Although the presence of significant residual porosity (Table 1) complicates the correct analysis of the electrical and thermal transport properties, the results on electrical and thermal conductivities (Fig. S5 in ESI†) propose some useful guidelines. Firstly, the electrical conductivities are mostly independent of the sample composition, do not exceed 5 S cm−1 and show temperature-activated charge transport behaviour; these hardly can be assumed as promising for SrTiO3-based thermoelectrics.28,30,51 Considering only the major charged defects and assuming that the nominal A-site deficiency vanishes on reduction due to exsolution of metallic Mo (eqn (2)), the concentration of the charge carriers converges to the following charge neutrality: (5)
The lowest conductivity of Sr0.97Ti0.94Mo0.06O3 stems from exsolution of a significant fraction of molybdenum and corresponding depletion of  and  resulting in an effective decrease in the charge carrier concentration  while the amount and morphology of the exsoluted metallic Mo are far below the percolation threshold, required for a parallel contribution to electrical conductivity. Strontium titanate is widely recognised in the literature as a band conductor, with some studies reporting a temperature-activated hopping conduction mechanism (ref. 52 and references therein). It is generally accepted that the defect structure of donor-substituted SrTiO3 is nearly frozen and corresponds to that at temperatures close to sintering.20,25,28 In this case, the observed σ vs. T trends (Fig. S5A in ESI†) can be attributed to the exponential increase in the polaron mobility with temperature,53,54 in contrast to the bandlike mode where the carrier mobility decreases due to scattering by phonons. The estimates for the activation energy (Ea) assuming the small polaron mechanism  (ref. 53) are plotted in the inset in Fig. S5A†vs. nominal molybdenum fraction in the samples. The values are in the range 16–22 kJ mol−1, within the previous results obtained for Nb-substituted SrTiO3 with a similar temperature-activated character of the electronic transport.26,55
Thus, the single-substituting approach provides evidence that using the redox-sensitive cations like Mo straightforwardly for improving the electronic transport in SrTiO3-based thermoelectrics is not efficient enough, likely due to insufficient stabilisation of  species as compared to the redox-stable high-valent Nb5+, Ta5+, Ln3+ donor cations and owing to the formation of porosity due to redox-promoted chemical expansion/contraction effects. Possible evaporation of MoO3 under oxidising conditions56,57 during pre-processing of the powders in air may also reduce the actual fraction of molybdenum cations as compared to the nominal, but is not expected to occur under strongly reducing conditions and affect the final densification. The results on the thermal conductivity (Fig. S5B in ESI†), however, suggest that the presence of molybdenum is favourable for suppressing the thermal transport. As an example, the values for porous Sr0.95Ti0.90Mo0.10O3±δ, corrected to 100% of the theoretical density assuming that spherical pores are homogeneously distributed in the bulk,58 are still below those obtained for the denser SrTi0.97Mo0.03O3±δ and SrTi0.94Mo0.06O3±δ. These benefits are likely provided by the segregation of nanoscale Mo particles and the formation of the inhomogeneities on the atomic scale, acting as efficient phonon scatterers, and additional factors discussed below. It should be noticed that such nanostructuring is produced and retained after sintering at 1773 K for 10 h, viz., under conditions favourable rather for the formation of coarse structures. In this sense, the refractoriness of the redox-sensitive cation in the metallic state can be one of the critical issues in order to benefit from the redox engineering of SrTiO3 thermoelectrics.
3.2 Co-substituted (Sr,La)TiO3±δ – MoO3 composite concept
The question how to achieve a synergy between the redox-promoted structural features and the inherent promising thermoelectric properties of SrTiO3 can be addressed by designing the compositions containing a significant excess of the redox-sensitive cation, while a reasonable electrical performance of the perovskite matrix is ensured by the donor co-substitution with a classical redox-stable cation like La3+. La-substituted strontium titanate itself is a known thermoelectric material with an excellent performance,23,28,59,60 which, in turn, can be potentially improved by introducing the cation vacancies.20,60–62 The optimal donor-substitution level, leading to the best combination of electrical and thermal transport properties, corresponds to ∼10 at% of lanthanide (e.g., ref. 28 and references therein). Thus, one can design the model systems as nominal composites based on either the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ or Sr0.85La0.10TiO3 perovskite matrix with a co-addition of 10% mol MoO3.
The results of X-ray diffraction studies mainly confirm the trends expected for oxidising conditions (Fig. S6 in the ESI†): pristine Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ are single-phase cubic perovskites, while Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo show the presence of SrMoO4 and TiO2 phases, similar to the single-substituted Sr(Ti,Mo)O3±δ. Nominal excess of molybdenum cations with preference to the B-site substitution prevents the formation of strontium-rich extended defects like (SrO)RP by promoting the A-site deficiency: (6)
In this case, the defect chemistry has been written per (1 + x − ε − p) perovskite unit cells to emphasize the correlations between the defect chemistry and precipitation of TiO2 (p), and effective incorporation of Mo species, after subtracting also the fraction of precipitated SrMoO4 (x − ε). Partial segregation of Ti accounts for the corresponding incorporation of Mo species into the B-site combined with changes in nominal Sr-deficiency; this may be assessed by considering the mass action constant of a partial Schottky reaction: (7) (8)
Thus, p increases with x and/or η, indicating that additions of Mo and nominal A-site deficiency η promote TiO2 exsolution, in good agreement with the XRD results (Fig. S6 in ESI†).
After reduction, the pristine Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ retain the single-phase perovskite structure. The patterns of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo indicate the presence of only one additional phase, namely, metallic Mo, similar to the single-substituted compositions (Fig. 1C–E). Surprisingly, detailed SEM/EDS inspection (not shown) of the reduced samples containing molybdenum did not reveal even minor TiO2 inclusions, which might not be detectable by the XRD. Thus, the accommodation of nominal molybdenum in the perovskite lattice takes place along with the generation of A-site and oxygen deficiency: (9)
Note that these expected changes in defect chemistry are written per 1 + x − (εo + η) perovskite unit cells, to account for the effective incorporation of Mo species. The corresponding segregation of Mo is accounted by εo + η, where εo represents segregation on adding Mo to the nominal composition Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ, and η accounts for changes in Mo segregation on varying the nominal A-site deficiency in the initial perovskite matrix. Based on eqn (8), the actual perovskite phase composition can be described as (Sr0.9−ηLa0.1)1−wTi1−wMowO3±δ, where efficient solubility of molybdenum in B-sites (w) is given by: (10)
This also contributes to A-site deficiency (11)where the additional term corresponds to relative changes in nominal A-site deficiency: (12)
Thus, the upper limit for the concentration of strontium vacancies in SrTiO3 is set by nominal A-site deficiency, combined with the effective solubility of Mo species. This is determined by ionic radii of the constituent Monx+ cations63 in MoO6 “building blocks”, since the initial composite formulations contain a significant molybdenum excess, combined with redox conditions. However, A-site deficiency seems somewhat independent of the degree of ionization of the donor species, which has not been clearly recognized earlier (e.g., ref. 20). In fact, the degree of ionization determines mainly the charge carrier concentration: (13)
Thus, prevailing incorporation of Mo4+ under reducing conditions (i.e. 2φr + ψr ≪ 2(x − εo)) may even suppress the carrier concentration, with a negative impact on conductivity.
One may also estimate the impact of Sr stoichiometry and co-additions of La on effective solubility of Mon+ species by assuming ∼10% as a reasonable limit for A-site deficiency accommodated by the perovskite lattice (ref. 63 and references therein). On combining eqn (10) through (12) one expects a maximum molybdenum solubility of about ∼0.09 at% in the case of the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ matrix and ∼0.05 at% for Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ. In fact, one expects even lower actual solubility of the molybdenum excess due to processing under highly-reducing conditions, which provide a strong driving force for extensive reduction to metallic Mo.
These tendencies are well reflected even on the microscale, as evidenced by the representative SEM micrographs (Fig. S8 in the ESI†) showing a transition from dense and homogeneous pristine Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ (A) and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ (D) ceramics to micro- and nanoscale composites Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo (B and C) and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo (E and F). The brighter particles correspond to metallic molybdenum, as further confirmed by the EDS studies (Fig. 4). Co-substituted compositions allow much denser ceramics as compared to the single-substituted materials (Table 1). The reasons for this behaviour are not clear enough, although one might expect that the sintering is facilitated by the formation of the liquid phase upon heating (the melting point of SrMoO4 is ∼1313 K (ref. 64)). In the case of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo, the molybdenum segregation proceeds on the nanoscale, with a significant fraction of the particles around and below 100 nm (Fig. 4A). Rather coarse Mo particles are formed in Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo, where the nominal A-site deficiency of the matrix shifts the defect chemistry mechanism towards the preferential formation of Mo0 (Fig. 4B and S8E, F†).
 Fig. 4  EDS mapping results obtained for fractured Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo (A) and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo (B), showing the formation of molybdenum submicron- and nanoparticles. 
The Mo-rich inclusions with the perovskite structure are again observed in both Mo-containing co-substituted compositions, similar to those found in the single-substituted materials (Fig. 3 and S3 in ESI†). Fig. 5 shows a representative atomic-resolution elemental map. The atomic weight contrast viewed along the (110) direction allows detecting inhomogeneities in both A- and B-sites. Hence, Mo-rich regions surprisingly also present a lanthanum excess. STEM-HAADF studies of pristine Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ and Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ (not shown) showed only some minor inhomogeneities in the La3+ distribution close to the grain boundaries. Such cation ordering might be promoted by the differences in donor substitution mechanisms under oxidizing and reducing conditions. Under oxidizing conditions the formation of two  defects is compensated by the creation of a  cation vacancy in the vicinity of those defects. These vacancies further mediate the cation diffusion65 under reducing conditions and may facilitate the incorporation of SrMoO3 blocks formed by scheelite reduction into the perovskite matrix. In this interpretation, the coexistence of molybdenum and lanthanum cations in the observed areas (Fig. 5) can be considered as a consequence of redox design by shifting from oxidizing to reducing conditions. However, additional studies are needed to corroborate this hypothesis or figure out other possible factors responsible for this behaviour.

The distribution of elements in the corresponding planes of the perovskite lattice is illustrated by intensity variations recorded by the STEM-HAADF detector. 
The results of electrical characterisation (Fig. 6) indicate that the total conductivities of all prepared co-substituted and pristine samples are essentially similar at temperatures above 600 K. These results are in general agreement with the data on charge carrier mobility and concentration, obtained by the measurements of the Hall effect (Fig. S9 in ESI†), where the observed differences in electronic transport parameters of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ and Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo are negligible.
 Fig. 6  Temperature dependencies of the electrical conductivity (A) and Seebeck coefficient (B). 
It should be noticed that up to 600 K the Hall effect data might not be reliable enough due to the common problems of the electrical contacts with oxide ceramics at low temperatures. At temperatures above 500 K, all samples show typical metallic-type behaviour (Fig. 6A); substitution of Sr2+ with La3+ and Ti4+ with a fraction of Mo6+ and Mo5+ fills the n-type conduction band and provides a negative sign of the Seebeck coefficient in the whole studied temperature range. Apparently “unusual” conductivity behaviour at low temperatures showing a peak and decrease on further cooling for several samples was, in fact, also observed for many other donor-substituted titanates. This can be attributed to the presence of acceptor states at the grain boundaries and/or formation of thin oxidized shells at the surface of the grains during cooling from high sintering temperatures.62,66 The impact of the Mo presence is rather noticeable for the Seebeck coefficient, featuring opposite and well-reproducible trends for A-site stoichiometric and A-site deficient matrixes. Within a parabolic band model, the Seebeck coefficient increases proportionally to the charge carrier effective mass (m*) and decreases as  The latter term is mostly dominated by the fraction of lanthanum, substituting strontium  in agreement with the charge concentrations in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ and Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo ceramics obtained from the Hall effect measurements (Fig. S9 in the ESI†). The same measurements suggest that a significant effect of the molybdenum presence in the ceramic matrix on the effective mass is also not expected, as the charge carrier mobilities are almost similar. At the same time, one should not exclude the possible differences in contributions from the scattering of electrons by impurities and phonons.67 However, the results of Hall effect measurements performed in this work can be affected by the contact resistance and provide rather a general comparison of the electronic transport parameters. More guidelines on these points can be obtained from the calculation of the electronic band structure, actually complicated by the presence of molybdenum in various oxidation states, simultaneous isovalent and aliovalent substitution, and related effects on the density of states. A plausible explanation for improving thermopower in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo may consider the energy filtering effects in nanocomposites and heterostructures.68–70 These effects are notably explored for “traditional”, intermetallic and organic–inorganic nanocomposite thermoelectrics (e.g., ref. 70–76) while being scarcely reported for oxide materials.77–79 The concept of energy filtering implies that the low-energy charge carriers are filtered out by a potential barrier between the semiconductor matrix and metallic nanoinclusion, promoting a large and energy-asymmetric differential conductivity near the Fermi level, which, in turn, leads to an enhanced Seebeck coefficient.75,80 According to a theoretical model proposed for n-doped PbTe, containing randomly-distributed spherical metallic nanoinclusions with radius R and volume fraction cv, the relaxation time (τi) for the various-energy electron scattering on the nanoinclusions by the potential at the semiconductor/metal interface (VB) can be presented as: (14)
Smaller-size nanoinclusions produce a more significant impact on the Seebeck coefficient. Although the charge carrier scattering may simultaneously lead to suppressing the electrical conductivity, this trade-off does not necessarily occur if the interface potential, inclusion volume fraction and radius are properly optimised.68 One expects that the observed Mo- and La-rich inclusions in the crystal lattice (Fig. 5) may also contribute to the energy filtering since metallic nature of the nanoinclusions is not a strict prerequisite for this process (e.g., ref. 77, 80 and 81). This scenario likely describes the observed difference in the Seebeck coefficient between pristine Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ and Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo. On assuming a parabolic band model in the energy-independent scattering approximation,82 the Pisarenko relationship can be represented as: (15)where m* is the charge carrier effective mass, and e, h and kB are the carrier charge, Planck's and Boltzmann constants, respectively. Thus, roughly similar charge carrier concentrations (Fig. S9 in the ESI†), but notably distinct Seebeck coefficients (Fig. 6B) obtained for Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ and Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo ceramic samples suggest a difference in charge carrier effective mass for these compositions. This might be considered as additional evidence of the presence of energy filtering effects.83 On the other hand, excessive formation of large (sub)micron-size metallic Mo particles in the case of the A-site deficient matrix is beyond the conditions for effective low-energy electron filtering and may promote short-circuiting between the grains and a significant decrease in the Seebeck coefficient was observed.
The observed trends are finally responsible for the highest power factor observed for Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo (Fig. 7A), which is around ∼17% higher than that observed for the pristine composition. This enhancement does not appear very large. However, the modelling and experimental results obtained in other studies evidence that a significant improvement in electrical performance due to energy filtering effects by nanoinclusions is only possible in a relatively narrow concentration/size range (e.g., ref. 68, 70 and 84).
 Fig. 7  Temperature dependencies of the power factor (A), lattice thermal conductivity (B) and overall performance ZT (C). 
On the other hand, this is well-compensated by the fact that the nanoinclusions may also act as efficient phonon scatterers and decrease the lattice thermal conductivity. Fig. 7B shows the corresponding results, where the lattice contribution was estimated from the electrical conductivity data (Fig. 6A) and Wiedemann–Franz' law assuming the Sommerfeld value (2.45 × 10−8 W Ω K−2) of the Lorenz number.85 Actually, these data bring the same logical implications as in the case of the Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 6B): the exsoluted molybdenum nanoparticles in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo have appropriate geometrical dimensions and spatial distribution for effective phonon scattering, while excessive concentration and coarsening of these particles hinder this effect in Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo. Metallic molybdenum possesses at least one order of magnitude higher thermal conductivity compared to SrTiO3, and, in the absence of nanostructural and quantum-confinement effects, this results in even slightly higher thermal conductivity of the composite as compared to the pristine Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ (Fig. 7B). It should be noticed that the presence of atomic-scale La- and Mo-rich inhomogeneities (Fig. 5) contributes along with the Mo nanoinclusions to the significantly lower thermal conductivity of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo. In contrast, the particle coarsening and thermal short-circuiting overcompensate this effect in Sr0.85La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo.
Finally, the synergistic enhancement of the power factor and suppression of the thermal conductivity are responsible for the highest dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT observed for the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ – 10Mo nanocomposite (Fig. 7C). At 1223 K the ZT enhancement provided by molybdenum addition and redox tuning corresponds to 25%, as compared to pristine Sr0.9La0.1TiO3±δ. These findings for model systems are believed to open further possibilities for designing SrTiO3-based thermoelectrics and for transforming the concepts matching other thermoelectric oxides. This is mainly provided by extraordinary flexibility of the perovskite lattice towards retaining a rich combination of the redox states of transition metal cations and inherent capabilities for tuning the phase separation on the nanoscale, essential for tailoring the carrier filtering effects and efficient phonon scattering at redox-induced interfaces. Importantly, this work demonstrates that the extent of the “redox engineering” can be controlled not only by the external conditions and the fraction of the redox-sensitive cation, but also by varying the A-site composition of the perovskite phase. Previous studies have convincingly demonstrated that introducing the cation vacancies in donor-substituted SrTiO3 promotes the formation of defect structures, favourable for both low, glass-like thermal conductivity, and fast charge carrier transport.20,27,36,61,62,86 Attempt to design all these features together, to a certain extent, resembles well-known all-scale panoscopic approach for designing “traditional” thermoelectric materials,14 being, at the same time, essentially unique for oxide thermoelectrics in terms of their defect chemistry and redox flexibility. Another important implication is that seeking the redox-promoted enhancement of thermoelectric properties actually drives the thermoelectric research towards looking for often similar microstructural and chemically-induced features to those valued in the catalysis research (e.g., metallic nanoparticles, the presence of redox couples, etc.). In particular, molybdenum and molybdenum oxides are the basis for many heterogeneous catalysts, effective in controlling the rate and selectivity of a wide range of chemical reactions87,88 mainly due to a variety of available molybdenum redox states. Thus, one may anticipate similar material engineering principles for the development of innovative hybrid concepts combining thermoelectric and (electro)catalytic functionalities, which have recently gained a significant research interest.89–91
4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that the thermoelectric properties of strontium titanate-based materials can be enhanced by employing a redox-tuning approach, where the introduction of redox-sensitive molybdenum cations leads to a simultaneous enhancement of the power factor and suppression of the thermal transport provided by an interplay of various molybdenum oxidation states and their incorporation and segregation mechanisms. The strategy involved preliminary processing of Mo-containing SrTiO3 and Sr0.9−zLa0.1TiO3±δ – 10% mol MoO3 (z = 0, 0.05) composite formulations under oxidizing conditions to promote at least partial incorporation of the molybdenum cation into the perovskite lattice, followed by a deep reduction in a H2-containing atmosphere. Combined XRD/SEM/EDS/HRSTEM-HAADF/XPS studies confirmed that this approach results in partial substitution of titanium with molybdenum in 6+, 5+ and 4+ oxidation states and exsolution of metallic Mo on the nanoscale, leading to a nanocomposite structure with atomic-scale inhomogeneities in the perovskite matrix. While the single-substituting approach was found to be ineffective to provide a reasonable electrical performance, a synergy between redox-promoted structural features and high thermoelectric properties was achieved in composite formulations, provided by an enhanced Seebeck coefficient and lowered thermal conductivity. The analysis of defect chemistry mechanisms, micro- and nanoscale ceramics morphology, phase distribution and effects of A-site stoichiometry of the perovskite matrix on the transport properties suggests that the observed improvements are mainly contributed by carrier filtering effects and enhanced phonon scattering at various redox-promoted interfaces. The results open prospects for designing multifunctional materials, where their attractive thermoelectric properties are combined with potential catalytic and electrocatalytic activities.
