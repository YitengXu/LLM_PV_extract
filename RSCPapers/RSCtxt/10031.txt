    , Accepted 22nd October 2020First published on 23rd October 2020AbstractAmong the layered two dimensional semiconductors, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is considered to be an excellent candidate for applications in optoelectronics and integrated circuits due to its layer-dependent tunable bandgap in the visible region, high ON/OFF current ratio in field-effect transistors (FET) and strong light–matter interaction properties. In this study, using multi-terminal measurements, we report high broadband photocurrent response (R) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of few-atomic layered MoS2 phototransistors fabricated on a SiO2 dielectric substrate and encapsulated with a thin transparent polymer film of Cytop. The photocurrent response was measured using a white light source as well as a monochromatic light of wavelength λ = 400 nm–900 nm. We measured responsivity using a 2-terminal configuration as high as R = 1 × 103 A W−1 under white light illumination with an optical power Popt = 0.02 nW. The R value increased to 3.5 × 103 A W−1 when measured using a 4-terminal configuration. Using monochromatic light on the same device, the measured values of R were 103 and 6 × 103 A W−1 under illumination of λ = 400 nm when measured using 2- and 4-terminal methods, respectively. The highest EQE values obtained using λ = 400 nm were 105% and 106% measured using 2- and 4-terminal configurations, respectively. The wavelength dependent responsivity decreased from 400 nm to the near-IR region at 900 nm. The observed photoresponse, photocurrent–dark current ratio (PDCR), detectivity as a function of applied gate voltage, optical power, contact resistances and wavelength were measured and are discussed in detail. The observed responsivity is also thoroughly studied as a function of contact resistance of the device.
I. Introduction
High sensitivity photodetectors showing fast responses to optical fields capable of converting optical inputs to electrical signals are the building blocks of many multifunctional optoelectronic devices. These components find broad applications in consumer electronics, optical communications,1 sensors in supermarkets, self-driving cars, bioimaging and living cell inspection,2–5 infrared imaging, weather monitoring6 and cameras.7 Despite the tremendous growth in research during the past few years, Si-based photodetectors are difficult to replace and still comprise the largest share of the electronic industry due to their low-cost and ease-of-integration in devices. Photodetectors beyond CMOS-based technology with reference to the scaling limit, speed and device density show limitations for applications in near-infrared or far-infrared regions. Currently, many infrared CMOS photodetectors are based on InGaAs or HgCdTe, which suffer from high cost of manufacturing. Furthermore, CMOS-based photosensors may not be a good candidate for future technologies, such as wearable electronics, due to their geometric limitations and difficulty in integration to thin, flexible devices.
Two-dimensional, layered materials consisting of single-to-few atomic layers show potential for applications in flexible electronics due to their transparency and flexibility. In addition, they provide a unique opportunity to expand optical sensitivity beyond the limit of CMOS devices. Among the various 2D materials investigated for their photodetection properties, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are at the forefront due to their tunable bandgaps in the UV-visible regions.8–10 They show strong light–matter interactions due to the presence of van Hove singularities in the density of states. This is due to the localized nature of the electronic wave-functions of the d-orbitals in transition metals and p-orbitals of chalcogen atoms.11–13
MoS2 is one of the most studied materials among the TMD family due to its common availability and stability under ambient conditions. Many photoconductivity studies of MoS2 are focused only on the visible region of the solar spectrum, reportedly showing a wide range of photoresponsivities spanning from values as low as 0.5 mA W−1 to values as high as 880 A W−1 and being highly dependent upon the applied gate voltage, source–drain voltage and incident optical power.14–16 The photoresponsivity, (R), is inversely dependent on the applied optical power (R ∝ Popt−γ).15,17–19 It is also linearly dependent on the applied drain–source voltage (Vds). The response time is one of the crucial figures-of-merit for photodetectors used in fast/slow and weak signal detection. Many 2D semiconducting systems show response times as large as ms to as small as μs.14–16,18,19 The response time depends upon the area of the detector, laser power and the method of measurements. Two-dimensional semiconductors not only show high responsivity at room temperature but also yield a stable photodetection characteristic under extreme conditions such as a wide temperature range (20 °C to 400 °C) and a high radiation environment.20–22 These properties make 2D semiconductor-based photosensors especially promising for optoelectronics.
Many photodetectors operate either in the visible region of the solar spectrum or using monochromatic laser sources and show extremely high responsivity, external quantum efficiencies (EQE) and excellent low-signal detection.11,17,18,23–27 However, multifunctional applications could be explored using single device components if the photosensor worked in a broad spectral range instead of just a single wavelength. However, to our knowledge, only a limited number of studies on broadband photodetection in 2D material-based devices have been reported. Choi and coworkers28 reported broadband photodetection using a 60 nm thick MoS2 photodetector fabricated on a Al2O3 dielectric substrate. They observed a broadband photoresponsivity of ∼50 mA W−1 in the range of 450 nm to 750 nm. The responsivity reported by Choi et al. is smaller than the reported broadband responsivity of 0.5 A W−1 announced by Tsai et al. in the range of 400 nm to 700 nm.29 Recently, Lee and coworkers30 reported gate voltage dependent broadband photoresponsivity of a graphene-contacted few-layered MoS2 phototransistor. They observed R ∼ 10−3 A W−1–1 A W−1 from 450 nm to 800 nm when the transistor operated in the OFF state. This value increased substantially by three orders of magnitude to 103 A W−1 when the transistor operated in the ON state at an applied gate voltage, Vg = 20 V. The graphene contact on MoS2 could be responsible for high carrier conduction/injection from the MoS2 channel to the graphene-contact electrodes. There are a very few studies elucidating the possible broadband optical response of MoS2 phototransistors. Some of these responsivities are still poor in the whole spectral region or particularly in the IR region. The intrinsic photoresponse is still enigmatic due to the various factors involved in the device fabrication such as contact resistance between the metal contact and the semiconductor channel which forms Schottky barriers and limits efficient charge-carrier injection from the semiconductor to the metal. The quality of the material is also an important factor as impurity scattering could further reduce the photocurrent response. The environmental conditions during the measurements could also cause poor responsivity, for example if the device is exposed to the ambient conditions and water vapor on the surface of the 2D channel inhibiting the photocurrent generation.
In this work, we explored the intrinsic broadband photoconductivity of ∼10–15 atomic layered MoS2 photo-transistors from the visible-to-IR region fabricated on a 285 nm thick SiO2 coated on a Si substrate. We measured the intrinsic optical conductivity using multi-terminal (4-terminal) measurements, which showed a much higher response compared to the conventional 2-terminal measurements. The photoconductivity was evaluated using both white and monochromatic light, yielding high photoresponsivity as a function of gate voltage, incident optical power and wavelength.
II. Synthesis and device fabrication
We synthesized bulk MoS2 crystals through a traditional chemical vapor transport (CVT) technique31–33 using iodine as the transport agent. We exfoliated single- to several atomic-layer thick MoS2 flakes from a bulk single crystal using the mechanical Scotch tape exfoliation technique (ESI Fig. S1†) and characterized via Raman microscopy to confirm the quality of the crystal. Raman spectroscopy measurements of single-layer to seven-layer thick flakes are presented in Fig. S1(b)† along with the Raman spectrum of bulk MoS2. We fabricated the FET devices using few-atomic-layer MoS2 (a 12 nm thick device presented below and a second 15 nm thick device presented in the ESI†) on a clean Si substrate thermally deposited with a 285 nm thick SiO2 layer. We fabricated several multilayered MoS2 FETs using a Microtech Laser writer (Model # LW405) and metal contacts (5 nm Cr/80 nm Au) were deposited using a Lesker e-beam evaporator with a base pressure in the low 10−8 Torr range. After the devices were fabricated, the channel area was covered with a thin layer of Cytop (transparent thin polymer film) to prevent the MoS2 layers from direct exposure to the ambient air/oxygen environment. Our previous experience suggested the long durability of the device when encapsulated or coated with Cytop.34–36
III. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic of the device with a measurement scheme. Fig. 1(b) shows the optical image of the device with 6 contacts fabricated on the Si/SiO2 substrate. The thickness of the MoS2 layer is 12 nm as measured by atomic force microscopy. A highly p-doped Si substrate was used for the back gate to control the charge carrier density inside the channel. Fig. 1(c) shows the drain–source current (Ids) as a function of drain–source voltage (Vds) measured using 2-terminals, source (S) and drain (D) contacts. The I–V curve shows linear dependencies between 0 and 200 mV and at all applied gate voltages without showing any sign of nonlinearity even though there is a possibility of Schottky barrier formation between the semiconductor and the metal junction. This linear I–V behavior is due to the thermionic emission process at room temperature due to thermal energy where the carriers can be easily promoted into the conduction bands from the valence band. Fig. 1(d) shows the Idsvs. Vds graph measured using 4-terminal configurations from the same device that yields a much higher drain current (4 times higher) compared to the current measured using 2-terminal configurations. This enhanced output current measured by the 4-terminal method is due to the elimination of the contact resistance associated with the 2-terminal measurement. 2D semiconducting materials composed of single to few-atomic layers are prone to form Schottky contacts due to the Fermi level pinning (FLP) at the interface, which arises from the difference in the work function between the metal and the semiconductor.37

(b) The optical image of one of the ∼12 nm thick MoS2 devices with multi-terminal contacts using Cr/Au (5 nm/80 nm) metal contacts fabricated on the 285 nm SiO2 layers deposited on the p-doped Si substrate. (c and d) The Ids value as a function of Vds at several constant gate voltages using 2- and 4-terminal configurations, respectively. 
The work function of few-layered MoS2 is ∼5.2 eV and for Cr is 4.5 eV.38 Theoretically, it could form a Schottky barrier height of ∼0.7 eV. This barrier height may vary with the number of semiconducting layers.37 For monolayer MoS2 contacts with 3D metals, strong pinning is found at the metal–semiconductor (M–S) interface.37 The FLP originates from several factors such as the formation of an electric dipole at the interface due to the change in the charge distribution at the junction and metal & defect/disorder induced gap states.39,40 The pinning may be less pronounced in multilayered MoS2 compared to the single layer. The charge accumulation on a multilayer is larger than on a single layer, which could reduce the pinning effect.

Fig. 2 shows the transport characterization of the MoS2 FET. Ids as a function of Vbg at fixed Vds = 50 mV, 100 mV, 150 mV and 200 mV were measured using the 2-terminal method as shown in Fig. 2(a). The FET shows the minimum current at applied negative Vbg which indicates the OFF state of the transistor and when the gate voltage is swept to the positive direction, current increases exponentially, which confirms the ON state of the transistor. The FET behavior as a function of gate voltage shows minimum current at negative applied gate voltage and increases exponentially when swept towards the positive gate voltage indicating that the MoS2 crystal shows high electron doping as previously reported by several research groups.41–44 The high electron doped behavior in MoS2 is found to originate from the high density of the S vacancy in MoS2 crystals.45,46 The magenta color lines shown in the Idsvs. Vbg graph for both 2- and 4-terminal measurements of Fig. 2(a) and (b) are the linear-fit to one of the curves at Vds = 150 mV used to extract the slope of the curve. The charge carrier mobility was calculated using the standard MOSFET transconductance formula as shown below and using the slope values of . (1)where L = 13.7 μm is the channel length of the device between source and drain contacts (used for the 2-terminal method), W = 6 μm is the width and Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the device. For a 285 nm thick SiO2 layer, calculated Ci = 12.738 × 10−9 F. The calculated 2-terminal mobility for our few layered MoS2 devices is 14 cm2 V−1 s−1. Fig. 2(b) shows the same data as that of 2(a) but measured using the 4-terminal method. We used , where l = 4.8 μm is the channel length between two voltage leads V1 and V2 to calculate the carrier mobility from the 4-terminal measurements as the channel length for this measurement is the length between two voltage probes V1 and V2 and not between the “S” and “D” contacts. The voltage drop measured or sensed between V1 and V2 contacts using the 4-terminal method and the mobility extracted using the same drain–source voltage Vds = 150 mV, (same as Vds for 2-terminal measurements). Similar to Idsvs. Vds, the current measured using the 4-terminal method in gate sweep is also much higher (∼5 times higher) than that obtained through the 2-terminal method. The 4-terminal mobility μ4T = 33 cm2 V−1 s−1 is larger than that given by the 2-terminal mobility.41 Similar mobility was extracted from the second device #2 using 2- and 4-terminal configurations (see ESI Fig. S5†). Ids as a function of the Vbg plot shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b) are again depicted in Fig. 2(c) and (d) but at the logarithmic scale to visualize the ON/OFF current ratio of the device. The current ratio of the FET between ON and OFF states is 105, which is similar to many reported multilayer MoS2 FET.41,47–49 The ON and OFF current ratio is expected to increase as the applied Vds increases, but we limited Vds to 200 mV for the safe operation of the device and to avoid damaging it before the optical measurements were performed at a later stage. The Ids value saturated above the gate voltage Vbg = 5 V and suggested that accumulated free charge carriers near the source contact were swept across the depletion region by the applied electric field and current remained nearly constant. The saturation of current was because of the fully depleted channel and limited to the contact resistance for the measurements using 2-terminal configurations. The 4-terminal measurements have the same effect of depletion of the channel, but higher current saturation was observed due to the elimination of contact resistance.

The electrical and optical transport properties measured from the second device #2, given in the ESI,† showed photoconductivity properties similar to those of device #1. The FET transport measurement of device #2 was performed with the gate sweep from −20 V to 15 V. Device #2 showed a threshold gate voltage VT ∼ −10 V, which was different from the threshold gate voltage of device #1, VT ∼ 0 V, which can be obtained by linear extrapolation from the Idsvs. Vbg graph, Fig. 2(a) or (b). Both devices showed similar ON/OFF current ratios and threshold voltage swings. The threshold gate voltage difference could be due to the thickness difference between the two devices, where device #1 is 12 nm thick and device #2 is 15 nm thick. Additionally, some photoresist polymers may be leftover at the interface between semiconductor and metal junction during the fabrication process, which could also result in differences in FET characterization from one device from the other.
In order to study the optical properties of the device, the white light source (Motic MLC-150 C halogen fiber optic illuminator) was fed through a microscope lens. The optical power was initially measured with a power meter at the sample position while varying the intensity of the light under dark room conditions. Fig. 3 shows the overall optical response of our multilayer MoS2 phototransistor using white light illumination. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the drain–source current as a function of applied gate voltage at different illuminating optical powers including the dark current (Idark). Idark was measured when the illuminator is turned OFF and in a dark room environment. In the following optical measurements, we commonly used bias voltage and optical power. The bias voltage is applied between the source and drain to drive the carrier from the source contact to the drain contact. The optical power is the power provided by the illuminated light on the top of the channel which generates electron–hole pairs within the semiconducting channel, and the electrons and the holes will move towards the drain or source by applied bias voltage.
 Fig. 3  (a and b) The drain–source current as a function of applied back gate voltage at an illuminated optical power Popt = 0.02 nW, 0.2 nW, 0.68 nW, 1.32 nW, and 2.27 nW measured using 2- and 4-terminal methods respectively. (c and d) The 2- and 4-terminal photoresponsivity of the device as a function of gate voltage at constant input optical power. 
The observed drain–source current increases with an increasing optical power from 0.02 nW to 2.27 nW using both 2- and 4-terminal measurements. We calculated the photogenerated current Iph by subtracting the dark current from the values of Ids when measured with illuminated light called Ilight, (Iph = Ilight − Idark). Ilight is equal to Ids but under illumination. We saw a significant enhancement in photocurrent when measured using the 4-terminal configuration compared to using the 2-terminal configuration (ESI Fig. S2†). The threshold voltage decreases and the current increases as a function of increasing optical power, indicating that the photogating effect in our device is similar to the results previously reported for InSe and ReS2 phototransistor devices.19,50 Photogating phenomena may arise from charge traps at the interface between MoS2 layers and SiO2. Electron–hole pairs created by photoexcitation are pulled towards the electrode by the applied voltage. In MoS2, photoconduction is facilitated by the majority of charge carrier electrons and the minority of carrier holes. Holes can be easily trapped at the interface producing photogain, while an electron can move through the external circuit many times before it recombines with a hole. This enhances the photogain of the device.19 This photogating effect may also increase the electron–hole recombination time since more positive charge carriers are generated with increasing optical power, filling the trap states. We extracted the responsivity of the device using the relationship . Popt is the optical power illuminated on the channel area.
However, taking the device geometry into account, we calculated the optical power incident on the sample area using the formula , where P is the total power measured using a power meter, r is the radius of the spot and A is the area of the sample. In 2-terminal measurements for all the applied power, R increases with increasing gate voltage and reaches to a maximum value between 0 V and 10 V of applied gate voltage. This indicates that the number of electron–hole pairs generated increases with increasing gate voltage or increasing accumulation of carriers at the interface. The number of generated carriers saturates above a certain gate voltage [>5 V, as seen from Fig. 3(c) and (d)] and is limited by contact resistance. This results in the saturation of electron–hole pair generation and the decrease in responsivity by further increasing the power. The responsivity measured using the 4-terminal configuration which is depicted in Fig. 3(d) is much larger than that measured using the 2-terminal configuration due to the elimination of the contact resistance. The highest responsivity obtained is 6 × 103 A W−1 at Popt = 0.02 nW. This value is similar to the high responsivity reported in monolayer MoS2 but at higher applied Vds = 8 V.15 The phototransport parameters such as responsivity, EQE, PDCR and detectivity values obtained from this study are compared to the reported results from several research groups and presented in ESI Table 1.† The responsivity saturated at high gate voltage using 4-terminal measurements, whereas the responsivity decreased slowly above Vbg = 5 V using the 2-terminal configuration [Fig. 3(c)]. The decreasing trend of responsivity for the 2-terminal method could be caused by the heating of the contacts due to the contact resistance. The saturation of photoresponsivity using 4-terminal measurements [Fig. 3(d)] suggested that the photocarrier generation in the channel became saturated. Thus, a further increase in gate voltage did not increase the responsivity of the device. Using the 2-terminal configuration not only the channel was depleted but also the photogenerated carriers were limited due to the effects of contact resistance, which limited the current flow and decreased the current with increasing gate voltage. A similar value for the responsivity was measured on the second MoS2 device #2 which is presented in the ESI (Fig. S7†).
In the ESI, Fig. S3† shows R at Vbg = 0 V and 10 V as a function of illuminated optical power under white light at the logarithmic scale. The highest responsivity obtained from our few-layered MoS2 transistors when measured using the two-terminal configuration is 103 A W−1 for Vbg = 0 V when the transistor is in its ON state and under an illumination power Popt = 0.02 nW [Fig. S3(a)†]. We fitted the responsivity using the power law (R ∝ P−γ) as a function of Popt. From this fitting, we obtained the exponent γ = 0.5–0.6. The same power law exponent was also obtained from the 4-terminal data as shown in Fig. S3(b).† The decrease in responsivity as a function of optical power in a sublinear manner is due to the charge trap which can occur at the interface between MoS2 and SiO2 substrate. SiO2 has many dangling bonds51 and can be the primary source of charge traps at these defect sites. The influence of charge trap could be significant in these 2D materials where the surface to volume ratio is large, which leads to large responsivity. The presence of defects (missing S atoms)46 could be another reason for this high responsivity due to the charge trap on the defect sites.
The contact resistance has a considerable effect on the transport properties of the device, particularly in 2D material based devices as we saw in previous sections. The lower the contact resistance, the better the device performance which increases the current injection rate from the semiconducting channel to the metal contacts and vice versa.41,52Fig. 4 shows the contact resistance extracted from the 2- and 4-terminal photocurrent measurements using the following formula (2)where Vds is the drain–source voltage applied and measured between source and drain contacts for 2-terminal measurements, while the current is also measured at the same two contacts. In 2-terminal measurements, current flow causes an electric potential drop across the two test leads (source and drain) and the contact interface so that the resistance of the contacts is inseparable from the device under test. However, using 4-terminal configurations, a pair of contacts [outer pair, source and drain in Fig. 1(a)] provides the current and the other pair of contacts V1 and V2 is used to sense the potential drop across the device. In the 4-terminal case, there is no current flow through the remote voltage-measuring leads and therefore no electric potential drop across the voltage contacts, thus eliminating the effects of contact resistance from the measurement. The contact resistance Rc was extracted at Vds = 200 mV from the gate sweep data. In eqn (2), R2T = Vds/I2T is the total resistance of the channel including the effect of two metal contacts and R4T = Vds/I4T is the total resistance of the channel when the effect of the two metal contacts are eliminated. Therefore, R2T − R4T provides the contact resistance of the two metal contacts and (R2T − R4T)/2 yields the contact resistance of each metal contact from the device. Fig. 4(a) demonstrates that the Rc values have a significant effect on the low gate voltage, where the transistor is in OFF state. The contact resistance without illumination is 450 kΩ at Vbg = 10 V, and 100 kΩ at Vbg = 50 V. When the channel is illuminated by light, more carriers are generated and conducted through the MoS2 channel, which reduces the barrier height at the contacts. For 2.27 nW of white light illumination, contact resistance at Vbg = 10 V is reduced to 200 kΩ, which is 2.25 times smaller compared to the case without light illumination.

The solid lines in both the graphs are the power law fit from where the values of the exponents are extracted. (c) Photoresponsivity R measured using the 4-terminal method as a function of contact resistance Rc of the device at the logarithmic scale at several constant applied gate voltages. 
The contact resistance does not significantly depend upon the light intensity at high gate voltage, since most of the carriers are already populated at the interface with high enough applied gate voltage so that the illumination does not increase the number of carriers in the channel. The Rc value was fitted with a power law of the form Rc ∝ Vbg−δ. The δ value indicates how the intensity of the illumination affects the contact resistance. The δ value extracted from the power law fitting varies from 0.75 (when no light is shining on the device) to the value 0.44 (when illuminating the device with Popt = 2.27 nW optical signal). We also plotted Rc as a function of the optical power at fixed gate voltages as depicted in Fig. 4(b). The solid (magenta) lines are fit to the experimental data with the power law Rc ∝ Popt−ν. As expected, Rc values are less dependent upon the optical power at high gate voltage (blue dots) or when the transistor is in the ON state compared to the OFF state (red dots). The exponent ν has values of 0.12 at Vbg = 10 V and 0.03 at Vbg = 40 V. The contact resistance could also be improved using 2D metal contacts such as graphene or similar metallic 2D crystals.52–54 We also extracted the relationship between photoresponsivity R and the contact resistance Rc of the device as shown in Fig. 4(c). We have the relationship of responsivity as a function of Popt know as R ∝ Popt−γ from device #1 presented in ESI Fig. S3(a) and S3(b)† at fixed gate voltage. We also have a similar power law relationship of contact resistance Rc with Popt at a fixed gate voltage Rc ∝ Popt−ν. We extracted the relationship between R and Rc as R ∝ Rηc, where η = γ/ν (from the relationship R ∝ Popt−γ and Rc ∝ Popt−ν and also see the ESI description of Fig. S7†). At Vbg = 10 V, we extracted the value of η = 4.1 as shown in Fig. 4(c), which is equal to the value obtained from γ and ν from Fig. S3(b)† and Fig. 4(b) as η = γ/ν = 0.53/0.12 = 4.4. We also measured the contact resistance as a function of Vbg and Popt from the second device #2 [ESI Fig. S8(a)–(c)†] and extracted the relationship between photoresponsivity R and the contact resistance of the device as shown in ESI Fig. S8(d).† We know that R ∝ Popt−γ from Fig. S7(c) and S7(d)† at a fixed applied gate voltage. We also have the same power law relationship of contact resistance Rc with Popt at a fixed gate voltage [Fig. S8(c)†]. We extracted the relationship between R and Rc as R ∝ Rηc, where η = γ/ν (see the ESI description of Fig. S8†). We plotted the R values from the 4-terminal configuration as a function of Rc at the Log–Log scale at several constant Vbg for device #2 [Fig. S8(d)†]. Each line shows at constant Vbg and increasing function of Popt as shown in the arrow sign in Fig. S8(d).† The data for Vbg = 0 was fitted with the power law R ∝ Rηc. The exponent extracted from the fitting was η = 5.3, which was close to the value calculated from the exponents γ = 0.71 from 4-terminal measurements [Fig. S7(c)†] and ν = 0.14 [Fig. S8(c)†] as γ/ν = 5.1.
Although there are several reports that discuss the photoconductivity of MoS2 and other dichalcogenide compounds using monochromatic light, limited information is available about broadband photodetection to pave the way for a broader range of practical applications. Thus, we extended the present study to explore the optical properties of the MoS2 photodetector device to the broader spectral range using a customized experimental setup using a xenon lamp as the light source and a monochromator as the detector as shown in Fig. 5(a) to study the wavelength dependent photoconductivity. The power delivered to the sample area (channel area) was calculated by measuring the power incident on the device at each and every wavelength that we used for photoconductivity measurements. The photoinduced transfer curves Idsvs. Vbg are obtained under the illumination of fixed monochromatic lights in the spectral range of 400 nm to 900 nm.

(b and c) The responsivities as a function of applied gate voltages at several illuminated wavelengths from 400 nm to 900 nm measured using 2- and 4-terminal configurations respectively. The input optical power on the sample measured from 400 nm to 900 nm wavelengths are 0.16 nW, 0.32 nW, 0.26 nW, 0.23 nW, 0.22 nW, 0.19 nW, 0.16 nW, 0.12 nW, 0.07 nW and 0.2 nW respectively. 
The power dependent photocurrent as a function of gate voltage is measured and from there, we extracted the responsivity of the device at several applied gate voltages and plotted it as a function of wavelength. The responsivity as a function of Vbg at several constant wavelengths measured with 2- and 4-terminal methods are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b) respectively. Similar to the responsivity under white light in Fig. 3(c), the 2-terminal responsivity increases as a function of Vbg and peaks between 0 V and 10 V. The maximum R value measured at a 400 nm wavelength between Vbg = 0–10 V then decreased slowly with increasing wavelength into the IR wavelength range, which is similar to the reported results by Lee et al.30 The highest 2-terminal responsivity observed in our multi-layered MoS2 devices is ∼800 A W−1 at a wavelength of 400 nm. The responsivity decreases with increasing wavelength as shown in Fig. 5(b). The gate voltage dependent responsivity measured using a 4-terminal configuration is depicted in Fig. 5(c). As mentioned previously, measurements performed using 4-terminal configurations show much higher responsivities (by an order of magnitude) compared to the responsivity extracted using the 2-terminal measurements. The responsivity increases continuously as a function of increasing gate voltage and reaches 6 × 103 A W−1 at Vbg = 55 V. The photodetector shows higher R in the ON state of the transistor compared to the OFF state which is in agreement with the results reported by Lee and coworkers.30

In the near infrared region, few-layered MoS2 has very low absorption due to the nature of its indirect band-gap and band-edge. Due to the weak absorption, it is difficult to measure the response from the sample. The missing data are due to the uncertainty of measuring the photocurrent above a certain gate voltage at wavelengths λ = 800 and 900 nm due to the weak absorption of the material.27,29
To understand the wavelength dependency of the data, we plotted the responsivity as a function of wavelength from the maximum value or peak position (Vbg = 0 to 50 V range) of R vs. Vbg graph in Fig. 5(b) and (c) and depicted in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The highest 2-terminal responsivity (R2T) of our few-layered MoS2 photodetector measured at 400 nm is 800 A W−1 and shows a dip at 500 nm. Then, R2T shows a broad peak like feature around 600 nm before dropping in value as it approaches the infrared region at 900 nm [shown in Fig. 6(a)], where it still shows high values of R (20 A W−1) and gate voltage dependency. All the gate voltage dependent responsivity data shows a similar trend of wavelength dependence while also matching the absorption spectrum of the crystalline MoS2 materials.55–57 The broad peak like feature in R from 600 nm to 700 nm at low energy is due to the A and B excitonic transitions between the maximum of the valence band and the minimum of the conduction band at the K-point of the Brillouin zone for MoS2 nanosheets.9 The responsivity extracted from the 4-terminal measurements is shown in Fig. 6(b) as a function of wavelength at several constant back gate voltages. The highest responsivity measured is ∼6000 A W−1 under 400 nm illumination compared to its 2-terminal value, which is an order of magnitude smaller. The overall response of the responsivity and its wavelength dependence is similar to the 2-terminal measurements. These results show the impact of contact resistance on the transport properties of the device, particularly in few atomic layers of TMDs. The responsivity near infrared is still high ∼100–500 A W−1. The responsivity slowly decreased above Vbg = 10 V for the entire spectral range when measured using the 2-terminal method [Fig. 6(a)]. On the other hand, the responsivity increased monotonically until Vbg = 40 V, and saturated at Vbg = 50 V when measured using a 4-terminal configuration [Fig. 6(b)]. Due to the weak absorption for few-layered MoS2 in the near-IR region as discussed before, it was difficult to extract the photocurrent precisely for λ > 700 nm. The responsivity showed a sharp decrease above 650 nm due to the low absorption of the indirect band gap of MoS2 in the near-IR region. This suggests that the few layered MoS2 can be used in broadband photodetection applications where the metal contacts to 2D materials are less affected by the contact resistance, which increases the charge collection efficiency at the metal–semiconductor interface resulting in better performance. The use of graphene for source and drain contacts reported by Lee and coworkers shows good efficiency of current injection due to the minimization of the contact resistance.58 Similarly, Kim and coworkers used graphene as the contact electrode to enhance the collection of charge in the vertical MoS2/WSe2 p–n junction solar cell.52 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is another figure-of-merit, which is defined as the ratio of the number of electron–hole pairs created to the number of incident photons. High EQE values would indicate suitability for light-to-current conversion applications. The maximum EQE values extracted from the device range from 105 to 106% (ESI Fig. S4†).
In addition to responsivity and EQE, another figure-of-merit used to quantify photodetector performance is the photocurrent-to-dark current ratio (PDCR). PDCR is a measure of the photodetector sensitivity with respect to the dark current (also called the leakage current). We extracted the PDCR values for both 2- and 4-terminal measurements [shown in Fig. 6(c)] using the relationship below for the entire wavelength range included in our study, (3)
The highest PDCR value obtained from our device is 90 and 50 for 4- and 2-terminal methods respectively at 400 nm and it decreases to 5 at IR, λ = 900 nm. These values are much higher than those obtained using the traditional photodetectors currently in use such as AlN, GaN, SiC, Ga2O3etc.59–62 Tsai and coworker reported a PDCR value of 3000 at room temperature for few layered MoS2 but at high applied Vds = 5 V. We further evaluated the specific detectivity, which is another important parameter to determine the capability of a phototransistor to respond to a weak light signal, which is also shown in Fig. 6(d). If the dark current is considered to be the single major contributor to the noise current, then the detectivity can be calculated using the following formula (4)where R is the photoresponsivity, A and q are the channel area of the detector and electron charge (q = 1.6 × 10−19 C) respectively. The detectivity of the device measured using the 4-terminal method is slightly higher than that measured using the 2-terminal method. The highest detectivity measured at λ = 400 nm is 1011 Jones and decreases slowly to the value of 5 × 109 Jones at λ = 900 nm. Our few-layered MoS2 photodetector's detectivity in the visible range is slightly higher than the reported value for a 60 nm thick MoS2 phototransistor reported by Choi et al. and two orders of magnitude higher in the IR region.28 These discrepancies could be attributed to the contributions from contact resistance, applied bias voltage, etc. Similar to the responsivity, the PDCR and detectivity values measured in the near-infrared region showed a sharp decrease due to the weak absorption of the few-layered MoS2 crystals. The PDCR values extracted from 4-terminal measurements were much higher than the 2-terminal values in the visible region and became closer when the device operated in the near-IR region.
IV. Conclusions
We explored the broadband photodetection on few-layered MoS2 phototransistors encapsulated with Cytop fabricated on a p-doped Si/SiO2 substrate. The photoconductivities are measured using the conventional 2-terminal and 4-terminal methods to observe the intrinsic phototransport properties. We compared the results obtained from white light and monochromatic light illumination ranges from λ = 400 nm to 900 nm. The devices exhibit high responsivity in white light as well as under monochromatic light illumination. An order of magnitude increase in the responsivity was observed when we measured using the 4-terminal method due to the elimination of contact resistance between the semiconductor MoS2 and metal contacts. We extracted the contact resistance, which clearly indicates the dependencies of photoresponsivity on few-layered MoS2. The responsivity as a function of contact resistance clearly indicates the intrinsic photoconductivity affected by metal contacts. We also observed high photoresponsivity and EQE as a function of applied gate voltage. We observed R values as high as 6 × 103 A W−1 at λ = 400 nm which decreases to 20 A W−1 in the IR region at λ = 900 nm. The observed EQE value is as high as 2 × 106% measured using a 4-terminal configuration, which is an order of magnitude higher than the 2-terminal measurements. This suggests that our measurement using the 4-terminal method provides the value of the intrinsic photoconductivity, which was extracted by eliminating the contact resistance. Furthermore, we also presented in detail the PDCR and detectivity of the device as a function of wavelength from 400 nm to 900 nm, showing that the few-layered MoS2 could be a suitable candidate for broadband photodetection when appropriate contacts are used by reducing the contact resistance of the device which enhances the responsivity and providing the intrinsic physical properties of the material. The broadband photosensitivity can be further enhanced using plasmonic nanoparticles and/or heterostructure devices using different types of 2D materials with varying bandgaps.
V. Methods
Fabrication and electrical and optical measurements
Few layered MoS2 flakes were exfoliated using blue Nito tape (product #SPV 224 PR-M) and then transferred on to a clean SiO2 substrate with a 285 nm thick oxide layer. Metal contacts were fabricated using a Laser writer (Model # LW405) and Cr/Au (5 nm/80 nm) were deposited using a Lesker e-beam evaporator at a 10−8 torr vacuum pressure. The devices were encapsulated with an ∼20 nm thick Cytop layer (amorphous fluoropolymer). Keithley instruments 2612B and 2635 source meters were used to perform electrical measurements. A white light source using a Motic MLC-150 C halogen fiber optic illuminator was used for white light measurements and a xenon lamp coupled with a monochromator was used for broadband photoconductivity measurements from λ = 400 nm to 900 nm. The 2-terminal method was performed using two contacts, source (S) and drain (D) contacts, as shown in Fig. 1(a), where both current and voltage drop were measured at the same contacts. On the other hand, in 4-terminal measurements while current was measured at S and D contacts, voltage was sensed through two separate terminals V1 and V2. Thus, the 4-terminal measurement eliminates the effect of contact resistance associated with the 2-terminal method. The same Vds was applied to the source to drive the accumulated charge carriers as applied using the 2-terminal method but it senses the voltage drop using V1 and V2 terminals.
Raman measurements
The Raman measurements of several MoS2 crystals with different thicknesses were performed using a Renisha inVia Raman setup at room temperature and under ambient conditions.
