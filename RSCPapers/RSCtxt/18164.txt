    , Accepted 7th January 2015First published on 8th January 2015AbstractWe report novel hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) TiO2 nanotube-branched rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays (H-TiO2 NRAs) on FTO substrates that serve as model architecture for efficient quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). The newly designed H-TiO2 NRA photoanode offers a large surface area for high QD loading with high light scattering properties. In the meantime, the presence of anatase–rutile heterojunction at the interface helps the rutile nanorods to efficiently collect photo-injected electrons from the anatase nanotubes, reducing electron recombination with the electrolyte and QDs. As a result, the H-TiO2 NRA photoanode with a thickness of only 1 μm, exhibits a solar energy conversion efficiency of 1.04%, which is 2.7 times higher than that found in the pristine nanorod array-based QDSCs, demonstrating the synergistic effect of rutile nanorods and anatase nanotubes for photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have been attracting considerable attention because quantum dots (QDs) exhibit extraordinary properties over conventional organic dyes. The significant advantages of QDs, such as tunable band gap, high extinction coefficients and multiple exciton generation have made them prime candidates for the design of next-generation solar cells.1–5 Although there have been quite a few studies on the application of QDs, such as CdS,6,7 CdSe,8 PbS,9 Ag2S,10 and CuInS2,11 as sensitizers for light harvesting in solar cells, the reported highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for QDSCs is less than 7%,12,13 which lags remarkably behind those of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).14,15 QDSCs remain far from optimized. Up to now, many investigations have been conducted to improve the energy conversion efficiency of QDSCs, including the development of novel photoanode architectures,16,17 various sensitizers,18 electrolytes,19 and counter electrodes.20
Transport and recombination of electrons are major parameters for the overall efficiency of solar cells. One dimensional (1D) structures, especially vertically aligned nanowires/nanorods on top of a substrate have been widely investigated as photoelectrodes in solar cells because they provide a direct conduction pathway for photo-generated electrons to rapidly collect and transport.21–24 However, the photovoltaic performance of 1D nanostructure based QDSCs is limited by their insufficient surface area and considerable free space between adjacent 1D nanostructures resulting in limited QDs loading and poor light harvesting. Therefore, the design and fabrication of novel branched hierarchical nanostructures are warranted to further improve the performance of solar cells. On the other hand, heterojunction structures are considered to be able to promote the charge separation and restrict electron recombination owing to their various phases with different energy band structures, which has been widely used in photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical devices.25–28 The synergistic effect of anatase mixed with rutile TiO2 phases has been demonstrated to enhance the photovoltaic performance on account of a stepwise band edge structure.29–31 Therefore, it is highly desirable to introduce branched nanostructures retaining the two phases in the solar cell devices, which can significantly enhance charge separation and transportation. However, as far as we know, there are few reports on the photovoltaic performance of anatase–rutile heterostructured TiO2 nanorods and even less research on the charge behavior at the anatase–rutile interface, which would be very significant for developing efficient solar cell devices.
In this study, we have combined the strategies of branched structures and phase junctions to build hierarchical TiO2 nanorod arrays (H-TiO2 NRAs) composed of rutile trunks and anatase nanotube branches. The anatase TiO2 nanotubes were assembled on rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays (TiO2 NRAs) through a liquid-phase conversion process using ZnO nanorods as a template. Scheme 1 illustrates the fabrication stages of H-TiO2 NRAs and the resulting novel photoelectrodes for QDSCs. The idea involved is to employ an anatase–rutile heterojunction to combine the functions of anatase nanotubes for light harvesting and rutile nanorods for fast electron transport. In addition, we have demonstrated that anatase–rutile heterojunction is beneficial to improve the electron transfer from the anatase nanotubes to the rutile nanorods and suppress electron recombination with the electrolyte and QDs. As a result, it exhibits a 2.7 times higher overall efficiency than that of pristine TiO2 NRAs, demonstrating its potential use in photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 NRAs
The TiO2 NRAs were directly grown on FTO substrates (14 ohm per square, Nippon Sheet Glass) via a hydrothermal method reported previously.32 In brief, 15 mL of deionized water was mixed with 15 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (36–38%, Beijing Chemical Works). The mixture was stirred under ambient conditions for 5 min. Then, 0.5 mL of tetrabutyl titanate (98+%, Aladdin) was added to the mixture and stirred for another 5 min. Then, the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL volume), where a cleaned FTO glass was placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon reactor with the conductive side facing down. The hydrothermal synthesis was maintained at 150 °C for 20 h in a regular laboratory oven. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the FTO substrate with the TiO2 NRAs was taken out, rinsed extensively with deionized water and allowed to dry in ambient air.
2.2. Synthesis of branched ZnO/TiO2 NRAs
First, a thin layer of ZnO was coated on the surface of the TiO2 nanorods using a sol–gel method to seed the oriented growth of ZnO nanorods.33 In brief, 0.075 mol Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (99+%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) and 0.075 mol monoethanolamine (99+%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) were dissolved in 100 mL 2-methoxyethanol (99+%, Xilong Chemical Co. Ltd.) solution at room temperature. The resultant solution was stirred at 60 °C for 0.5 h to yield a clear and homogeneous solution. Then, the bare TiO2 nanorod array film was immersed into the ZnO solution for 10 s at room temperature and withdrawn at a speed of 2.0 cm min−1 followed by heating at 200 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the sol–gel deposition and baking procedures were repeated 8 times to obtain the desired thickness. After that, the samples were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. Then, ZnO nanorods were grown by immersing the ZnO seed-coated TiO2 nanorod array film into aqueous solutions containing 25 mM zinc nitrate hydrate (99+%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) and 25 mM hexamethylenetetramine (99+%, Aladdin) at 85 °C for various durations. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the film was taken out and washed with deionized water to remove excess reactants followed by drying under a flow of N2.
2.3. Synthesis of H-TiO2 NRAs
The synthesized branched ZnO/TiO2 NRAs were immersed in an aqueous solution consisting of 0.075 M ammonium hexafluorotitanate (98%, Aladdin) and 0.2 M boric acid (99.5+%, Beijing Chemical Works) at room temperature for 0.5 h. In this solution, ammonium hexafluorotitanate hydrolyzed to TiO2 on the individual ZnO nanorods whereas ZnO dissolved simultaneously in the solution with the acids produced by ammonium hexafluorotitanate hydrolysis. Subsequently, the resulting films were immersed in a 0.5 M boric acid solution for 1 h to remove the residual ZnO inside the tubes. The H-TiO2 NRAs were finally rinsed with deionized water and calcined at 500 °C for 0.5 h to increase the crystallinity.
2.4. QDSC device fabrication
The arrays were sensitized with CdS QDs under the same conditions using a modification of the previously reported successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) route.34 In a typical procedure, the nanorod arrays on FTO substrates were first immersed in a solution containing 0.125 M Cd(NO3)2 (99+%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) in ethanol for 2 min, to allow Cd2+ to adsorb onto the surface of TiO2. After being rinsed with ethanol and dried under a steam of N2, the substrates were then dipped into a solution containing 0.125 M Na2S (98+%, Xilong Chemical Co. Ltd.) in methanol for another 2 min, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ reacted with S2− to form the desired CdS. The substrates were then rinsed with methanol to remove the excessive ions and dried again under a stream of N2. This typical procedure was repeated ten times to obtain the desired thickness of CdS. Care must be taken here because of the slight toxicity of CdS to the human body. The Pt counter-electrode was prepared by dripping a drop of 19 mM H2PtCl6 isopropyl alcohol solution onto a FTO substrate, followed by heating at 385 °C for 30 min. The working electrode and the counter-electrode were cohered together by epoxy resin. The polysulfide electrolyte consisted of 2 M Na2S, 2 M S and 0.2 M KCl in methanol–water (7:3 by volume).
2.5. Characterization and measurements
The morphology and lattice structure of the samples were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; XL 30 ESEM FEG, FEI Company) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; TECNAIG2, FEI Company). A TEM equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer was used to analyze the composition of the nanostructures. The crystal structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/Max-2550 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å; 50 kV, 200 mA) in the range of 20–80° (2θ) at a scanning rate of 5° min−1. The diffuse reflectance spectra and adsorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV3600, Shimadzu).
The separation characteristics of the photo-generated charge carriers were tested by a lock-in-based surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement system, which consists of a monochromator (Omni-λ5006, Zolix) and a lock-in amplifier (model SR830-DSP) with an optical chopper (model SR540) running at a frequency of 23 Hz. Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were carried out on a self-made instrument. The sample was excited with a laser radiation pulse (wavelength of 532 nm and pulse width of 5 ns) from a third-harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research, Inc.). The intensity of the pulse was regulated with a neutral grey filter and determined by an EM500 single channel Joule meter (Molectron, Inc.). The PV transient signal was registered using a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix). Both the SPV and TPV measurements were performed under an air atmosphere at room temperature.
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of the QDSCs were recorded using an electrochemistry workgroup (CHI 630b, made in China) in the dark and under illumination. A 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W, Global Xenon Lamp Power) with appropriate filter was used as the light source. The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2, which was measured with a radiometer (Photo-electronic Instrument Co., attached to Beijing Normal University, China). The effective area of the cell was 0.2 cm2. The electron lifetime of the samples was obtained from open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) measurements, which were conducted by turning off the illumination on the QDSCs at steady state and monitoring the subsequent decay of the Voc. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with an electrochemical analyzer (LK2006A, Lanlike) in the dark over different bias voltage in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.5 Hz. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with the Zview software in terms of the appropriate equivalent circuit.
3. Results and discussion
The process for synthesizing H-TiO2 NRAs starts with growing vertically aligned rutile TiO2 NRAs on a FTO-coated glass substrate by a hydrothermal method (Scheme 1a). Then, the ZnO/TiO2 hierarchical structure was formed by a solution growth of branched ZnO nanorods on the TiO2 NRAs (Scheme 1b). Finally, ZnO nanorods were converted to TiO2 nanotubes via liquid-phase TiO2 deposition and simultaneous ZnO dissolution upon immersing the array in an aqueous solution consisting of ammonium hexafluorotitanate and boric acid (Scheme 1c). The conversion process can be described by the following chemical reactions:35,36 TiF62− + 2H2O ↔ TiO2 + 4HF + 2F−(1) H3BO3 + 4HF ↔ BF4− + 3H2O + H+(2) ZnO + 2H+ ↔ Zn2+ + H2O(3)
As shown in eqn (1), TiO2 is deposited by the hydrolysis of the Ti-fluoride complex ion (TiF62−). The produced HF and the added H3BO3 moves the reaction to the right in eqn (2), creating H+. This acidic solution then dissolves ZnO simultaneously as depicted in eqn (3).

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of TiO2 NRAs, the ZnO/TiO2 hierarchical structure and H-TiO2 NRAs. The typical XRD pattern in Fig. 1 reveals that the crystal phase of the TiO2 NRAs (curve a) used as the backbone was a rutile phase (JCPDS 21-1276). The enhanced (002) diffraction peak indicates that the nanorods are well crystallized and oriented with respect to the FTO substrate. The crystal structures of the as-synthesized ZnO/TiO2 hierarchical structures are presented in curve b. The additional diffraction peaks with values of 31.8°, 34.4°, 47.6°, 56.7° and 68.0° can be indexed as hexagonal wurtzite-type ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451). After the liquid-phase conversion process (curve c), the diffraction peaks of ZnO disappear while new peaks corresponding to anatase TiO2 are detected, indicating the successful conversion of ZnO to anatase TiO2.

Fig. 2a and b show typical FESEM images of the TiO2 NRAs grown directly on the FTO substrate. The nanorods containing many step edges are tetragonal in shape with an average diameter of 50–100 nm. The cross-sectional images (Fig. 2b) indicates that the TiO2 nanorods have an extremely smooth sidewall and grow perpendicular to the FTO substrate with a length about 1 μm. Fig. 2c and d present the FESEM images of the obtained ZnO/TiO2 hierarchical structure after 4 h of solution growth. The ZnO nanorod templates with an average diameter of ∼100 nm and a length of ∼500 nm are dispersed orientationally on the TiO2 nanorods with a corolla-like nanostructure. The cross-sectional view shown in Fig. 2d reveals that dense ZnO nanorods are vertically grown on the outer surface of the TiO2 NRAs, which completely cover the backbone. After the conversion process, it is found that the TiO2 nanotubes retain the length of the ZnO rods, most of them are open at the top end and the hollow cores have approximately the same width as the original ZnO rods. Meanwhile, we can adjust the length of the branched TiO2 nanotubes through the growth of the ZnO nanorods with different hydrothermal reaction times (ESI, Fig. S1†).

In Fig. 3, low magnification TEM image reveal that the TiO2 nanotubes have an inner diameter of 100 nm and a wall thickness of 50 nm. The HRTEM image depicts that the TiO2 nanotubes have an anatase phase, which is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 1c). A lattice spacing of 0.352 nm corresponds to the (101) planes of anatase TiO2. In addition, CdS QDs with diameter of 5–10 nm were coated on the polycrystalline TiO2 and the observed 0.336 nm fringes of the QDs corresponds to the (111) plane of the cubic phase of CdS. The EDX spectrum further confirmed that the films are only composed of TiO2 and CdS (Fig. 3e). When compared to the branched ZnO/TiO2 NRAs (ESI, Fig. S2†), the disappearance of the Zn element further proves that ZnO was completely converted to TiO2.

Fig. 4a shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of bare TiO2 NRAs and the H-TiO2 NRAs with different reaction times without QD loading. The reflectance values of the H-TiO2 NRAs are larger than those of the TiO2 NRAs in the wavelength range of 400–650 nm, revealing that the incident light is significantly scattered by the branched TiO2 nanotubes with lengths of several hundred nanometers. In addition, with an increase in the length of the TiO2 branches, better reflection can be obtained due to the longer interwoven nano-branches, which can effectively confine the incident light in the electrodes. After CdS QD deposition, it is evident that a significant increase in the absorption intensity occurred in the H-TiO2 NRAs in the visible region compared with that of the TiO2 NRAs. Such enhanced absorbance is believed to due to an increased QD loading and improved light scattering ability from the TiO2 nanotube branches.

The SPV method is a well-established non-contact technique for the characterization of semiconductors, which relies on analyzing the illumination-induced changes in the surface voltage.37 It is an effective way to study the process of photo-induced charge separation and transfer on the surface and interface.38–40Fig. 5 illustrates the SPV spectra of bare TiO2 NRAs and the H-TiO2 NRAs with various reaction times. For single rutile TiO2 NRAs, the SPV response is obtained in the range of 300–420 nm due to the band–band transition (electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band). In contrast, the H-TiO2 NRAs produce a much broader and stronger SPV response than TiO2 NRAs, which shows the excitation of both anatase and rutile contribute to the SPV signal and result in a larger total charge in the mixed-phase H-TiO2 NRAs. Based on our previous results, there is an interface junction formed between the anatase and rutile phases, which can promote photo-generated electron transfer from anatase to rutile TiO2 and effectively separate charge carriers.41 Then, the injected electrons from the anatase branches will quickly transport along the single crystalline rutile trunks to the FTO substrate, which is good for charge collection.

Fig. 6 depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) and power output characteristics of typical QDSCs fabricated from bare TiO2 NRAs and H-TiO2 NRAs with different reaction times. The cell parameters of these devices are summarized in Table 1. The markedly enhanced device performance of QDSCs fabricated with H-TiO2 NRAs is clearly seen. An improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.56% was achieved using H-TiO2 NRAs obtained after a hydrothermal growth time of 1 h (denoted as H-TiO2 NRAs (1 h)), compared to PCE = 0.38% using pure rutile TiO2 NRAs. As the hydrothermal reaction time increases, the PCE is further enhanced and the highest PCE was obtained from the sample hydrothermally grown for 4 h, exhibiting a Voc of 500 mV, Jsc of 4.95 mA cm−2, fill factor FF of 0.42 and PCE of 1.04%, which is about 2.7 times higher than that found with the bare TiO2 NRAs device.

The key to highly efficient QDSCs lies in a large amount of QD loading, sufficient light harvesting and slow interfacial electron recombination. First, the capacity of QD loading exerts a profound influence on the photocurrent density. By subtracting the electrode effect from the QDs-sensitized TiO2 samples, we can deduce the optical absorbance value of only QDs. From Fig. S3,† a stronger absorption was observed with H-TiO2 NRAs, which indicates the larger loading of QDs in this electrode when compared to the TiO2 nanorod electrode. Second, the diffuse reflectance measurements reveal stronger scattering for the H-TiO2 NRAs in comparison with that of pure TiO2 NRAs, suggesting an improved light harvesting efficiency and therefore higher short circuit current Jsc. Then, we investigated the electron recombination kinetics of the QDSCs fabricated from the various electrodes by the OCVD technique and EIS measurements. The OCVD method is a way to probe the kinetics of recombination during the relaxation from an illuminated quasi-equilibrium state to the dark equilibrium state. The electron lifetime is given by τn = −(kT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1,42,43 where kT is the thermal energy, e is the positive elementary charge and dVoc/dt is the first-order time derivation of Voc. Fig. 7a shows the electron lifetime as a function of Voc for TiO2 NRAs and the H-TiO2 NRAs electrodes. It is found that the τn for the H-TiO2 NRAs is evidently larger than that for the TiO2 NRAs, indicating a reduced recombination of electrons with the electrolyte. The charge transfer (recombination) resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface was studied at various forward biases in the dark through EIS measurements, which is a useful technique to understand the electron transport and recombination in electrochemical systems.44 As shown in Fig. 7b, a larger resistance was observed in the QDSCs fabricated with H-TiO2 NRAs. The increase in the resistance at the interface means that the dark current resulting from interfacial recombination decreases, which agrees well with the dark current measurement shown in Fig. S4.†

The wavelength of the laser pulse is 532 nm. Inset: schematic setup of TPV measurements. (d) Schematic configuration for our device showing the interfacial charge transfer and recombination processes. 
Because the anatase–rutile heterojunction increases the recombination resistance, it should also influence the recombination kinetics of the QDs on the anatase nanotubes. To clarify this point, we further performed TPV measurements to study the charge recombination process in the absence of the redox electrolyte (Fig. 7c). Under an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, the fast positive TPV response peaked at 2 × 10−7 s, which indicates that plenty of photo-induced electrons have been injected into the TiO2 from the photoexcited CdS QDs. Thereafter, the slow decay of the TPV response corresponds to the charge recombination of holes with electrons in the trap/conduction band states of the TiO2 semiconductor with time. Again, the QDs on the H-TiO2 NRAs display a much slower decay than those found in the TiO2 NRAs, indicating that the recombination of electrons and holes could be restrained by the anatase–rutile heterojunction. As shown in Fig. 7d, the conduction band energy level of the rutile phase is lower than that of the anatase phase and the heterojunctions formed at the interface can facilitate a gradual transfer of the photoexcited electrons from anatase to rutile TiO2 and block the recombination reactions of electrons with holes in the QDs and electrolyte-oxidized species, consequently leading to the enhancement of Voc, FF and Jsc.
Though the efficiency reported here is lower than 3.2% reported by Sun et al.,45 the enhancement in cell performance is quite reasonable for the purpose of this study, namely, to evaluate the effect of an anatase–rutile heterojunction on CdS-QDSCs. We believe that the energy conversion efficiency will be further improved by increasing the length of nanorod backbone and nanotube branches. In addition, the band gap of CdS (∼2.4 eV) limits the absorption range below the wavelength of about 550 nm. To further improve the photovoltaic performance, it is necessary to pay attention to the research on narrower band gap sensitizers, such as CdSe, CuInS2 and co-sensitizers, which have been demonstrated to be more effective in visible light harvesting. The related study is in progress and will be reported soon.
4. Conclusions
In summary, hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanotube branches have been successfully assembled onto primary rutile TiO2 nanorod arrays. The newly designed H-TiO2 nanorod array electrodes offer a large surface area for high QD loading with high light scattering properties. In the meantime, the presence of a rutile–anatase heterojunction at the interface helps the rutile nanorods to efficiently collect photo-injected electrons from the anatase nanotubes, reducing charge recombination with the electrolyte and QDs. As a result, the QD-sensitized H-TiO2 NRA photoanode, only 1 μm thick, exhibits a maximal solar energy conversion efficiency of 1.04%, which is 2.7 times higher than that of the TiO2 NRAs photoanode. More importantly, the nanotube branched hierarchical nanostructure shows tremendous potential for use in photocatalysts, photoelectrochemical water splitting, supercapacitors and Li ion batteries.
