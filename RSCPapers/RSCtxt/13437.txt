    , Accepted 3rd October 2021First published on 5th October 2021AbstractHerein, a N-doped porous carbon/Co3Fe7 alloy composite (FP-950) was prepared via direct carbonization of a cheap and readily available bimetallic conjugated microporous polymer (CMP), namely Fc–Por, composed of ferrocene (Fc) and Co–porphyrin (Co–Por), via the copolymerization of 1,1′-ferrocenedicarboxyaldehyde and pyrrole which could be manufactured in the industrial scale in the presence of cobaltous acetate. The special carbon encapsulation structure of nanohybrids promotes the synergistic effect of Co3Fe7 and Co5.47N, which could protect the nanoparticles from the harsh environments. Moreover, the ultrahigh specific surface areas and the hierarchical pore structure are beneficial for the exposure of catalytically active sites. Hence, FP-950 exhibits a robust trifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. For example, it exhibits an acceptable HER performance with an overpotential (Eover) of 299 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope value of 144 mV dec−1. Meanwhile, FP-950 also displays impressive activity towards the OER with a low operating overpotential of 346 mV and a small Tafel slope value of 89 mV dec−1. Furthermore, FP-950 also presents acceptable ORR performance in alkaline environments which makes it an excellent catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries with a high specific capacity of 792 mA h gZn−1 and a super long life-time of 83 h (10 mA cm−2). By using FP-950 as the sole catalyst for full water splitting, an alkaline electrolyzer affords a cell voltage as low as 1.63 V at 10 mA cm−2. Finally, this also revealed that FP-950 could be used for overall water splitting in a self-powered manner under ambient conditions with a high H2 evolution rate of 569.5 μmol h−1. This work paves the way for the rational fabrication of a low-cost trifunctional electrocatalyst which could be further applied in sustainable energy technologies.
Introduction
The sustainable development of human society requires the exploitation of renewable energy conversion systems as alternatives to dwindling fossil fuels, such as fuel batteries, metal-air batteries, and water-splitting devices.1 Compared with traditional green energy devices, i.e., solar and wind energy, which are strongly dependent on weather conditions, these newly developed techniques are simpler and more convenient to use,2 whereas, the efficiency of these emerging energy systems mentioned above is determined by the electrode reactions which are largely dependent on the activity of electrocatalysts. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are three key reactions commonly involved in these renewable energy systems.3
Noble-metal based catalysts, i.e. Pt-, Ir-, and Ru-based catalysts, present remarkable activity for these reactions. Unfortunately, apart from their high cost, these catalysts also suffer from poor stability and susceptibility to poisoning and are currently only confined to laboratory applications.4 In general, effective electrochemical devices are commonly composed of two processes. For example, a rechargeable Zn-air battery requires the ORR and OER for discharging and charging on a cathode.5 The HER and OER are involved in water-splitting devices,6 whereas, many of the reported precious-metal catalysts are only active toward one single reaction. For example, the state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts are active towards the ORR, but exhibit poor OER performances. Ir- and Ru-based catalysts are considered as the benchmark for the OER, but they present little activity towards the ORR.7 The fabrication of an electrode using two different catalysts not only increases the manufacturing complexities, but also results in poor compatibility.8 Thus, for the implementation of various sustainable energy devices in the near future, it is highly necessary to explore inexpensive and durable electrocatalysts by engineering the bi- or tri-functionality on a single catalyst, in particular, the trifunctional catalysts, which are quite essential components in self-powered, electrochemical water splitting devices.9,10
During the past few decades, great efforts have been devoted to finding nonprecious-metal catalysts as substitutes to precious metal catalysts and tremendous progress has been achieved.11 Among the numerous catalysts, transition metal-based catalysts, especially the FeCo alloy-based catalysts with embedded Fe/Co–Nx sites, have recently been recognized as effective trifunctional catalysts from both computational and experimental results.12 Such catalysts are generally prepared by heat-treating a mixture of carbon precursors with metal sources, whose structure and active sites are formed randomly. Therefore, much effort should be focused on the fabrication of alloy-based catalysts with desirable component-structural features, e.g. robust interfacial conjugation, rational heteroatom doping, large specific surface areas, and hierarchical pore architecture.
Metal-chelated conjugated microporous polymers (M-CMPs), a subclass of porous organic polymers (POPs) with a programmable preparation process, have recently emerged as a versatile platform for the development of multifunctional materials for specific applications.13 Porous organic polymers (POPs) are an emerging class of multi-dimensional porous network materials built via strong covalent linkages between various organic building blocks with different geometries and topologies.14 To date, thousands of POPs with varied structure and composition have been successfully prepared.15 They have been applied in the field of heterogeneous catalysis,16 sensing,17 light emitting,18 batteries,19 supercapacitors,20 drug delivery,21 and organic photovoltaics.22 Outperforming the liner polymers, POPs feature a rigid skeleton which could be well retained after the thermal treatment. Recent years have witnessed their great application potential as precursors for highly active electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage devices.23 However, it is hard to obtain a trifunctional catalyst from the monometallic CMPs.24 To engineer multiple functionalities on a single catalyst, a lengthy and expensive synthesis process is always required, including tedious monomer synthesis, noble metal catalysis, and harsh synthetic conditions, which greatly blocks the real application of CMPs.25
Herein, a task-specific bimetallic conjugated porous polymer (Fc–Por) composed of ferrocene (Fc) and Co–porphyrin (Co–Por) was facilely synthesized by the condensation of pyrrole and 1,1′-ferrocene-dicarboxaldehyde in the presence of CoCl2. Direct pyrolysis of Fc–Por yields N-doped porous carbon catalysts (FP-X, X is the pyrolysis temperature) embedded with a well-defined Co3Fe7 alloy and Co5.47N, as well as widespread Fe/Co–N active sites. The optimum catalyst, i.e., FP-950, featuring a hierarchical pore structure and highly specific surface areas, exhibited excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activity for the synchronous ORR, OER and HER, under alkaline conditions, which makes it an excellent catalyst for Zn-air batteries as well as water splitting devices. By using FP-950 as the sole catalyst for full water splitting, an alkaline electrolyzer affords a cell voltage as low as 1.63 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Finally, this also revealed that FP-950 could be used for overall water splitting in a self-powered manner under ambient conditions with a high H2 evolution rate of 569.5 μmol h−1. This work paves the way for the task-specific fabrication of low-cost trifunctional electrocatalysts which could be further used in sustainable energy technologies.
Results and discussion
The preparation of Co3Fe7 alloy-based electrocatalysts is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The bimetallic CMP, namely Fc–Por, was facilely prepared via direct polymerization of 1,1′-ferrocenedicarboxyaldehyde and freshly distilled pyrrole with cobaltous acetate in a high-pressure Teflon-lined autoclave using glacial acetic acid as the solvent.26 And the targeted catalysts, i.e., FP-X (X is the pyrolysis temperature, X = 850, 950 and 1050 °C), were obtained via direct carbonization of the as-synthesized Fc–Por at target temperature under argon. The details are provided in the ESI.†
 Fig. 1  Schematic procedure for the synthesis of the Fc–Por porous precursor and final FP-950 catalyst. 
The formation of the porous network was initially validated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As seen from Fig. 2a, clear peak signals assigned to the porphyrin ring (3314 cm−1)27 and ferrocene (1680 cm−1)28 could be observed, indicating the coexistence of these two units in the porous skeleton. Moreover, feature peaks attributed to the formation of the Co–N bond (1046 cm−1) could also be detected, verifying the precise coordination of Co residing inside the porphyrin center.29 Solid state 13C NMR spectra in Fig. 2b further shows the connection of Fc and Por, in which prominent carbon signals originating from porphyrin (129.31 and 167.66 ppm) and Fc (40.51 and 68.17 ppm) are detectable.30Fig. 2c and S1† show the powder XRD pattern of the as-synthesized samples. No feature peaks were detected from the powder XRD pattern of the polymer precursor (Fig. S1†), indicating the amorphous structure of the prepared polymer.31 However, obvious diffraction peaks at 44.7°, 65.1° and 82.4° assigned to the (110), (200), and (211) crystal planes of the Co3Fe7 alloy (JSPDF No. 48-1816) could be detected from the XRD patterns of pyrolysis samples.32 In addition, a clear signal at 25.9° indexed to the graphitic carbon could also be found from the XRD pattern.33 The remaining peaks at 43.0°, 50.7° and 74.9° are ascribed to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes of Co5.47N (JSPDF No. 41-0943).34 The high graphitization of FP-950 could also be verified using the Raman spectrum in Fig. 2d. One could clearly observe that owing to the catalysis of iron and cobalt, the intensity of the graphitic band (1600 cm−1) is much stronger than that of defective carbon (1334 cm−1) with a calculated intensity ratio (ID/IG) of 0.877, indicating the prominent conductivity of FP-950, which is beneficial for electrocatalysis.35 TGA was performed to judge the thermal stability of the as-synthesized polymers and synchronously simulate the formation process of catalysts (Fig. S2†). As seen from Fig. S2,† Fc–Por features excellent thermal stability with a weight retention of about 49.9% even at a high temperature of 800 °C.

The porous feature of the synthesized samples was confirmed using low temperature nitrogen sorption isotherms. As seen from Fig. 2e, a typical isotherm combines the characteristics of type I and IV with a vertical uptake at the low pressure (P/P0 < 0.01) and a large hysteresis loop between the adsorption and desorption branches, suggesting the coexistence of micropores and mesopores for both samples.36 Furthermore, with the continuous increase of pressure (P/P0 > 0.95), rapid growth could be further detected, revealing the simultaneous existence of macropores.37 And the hierarchical pore structure could be observed directly from the pore size distribution curve (PSD). Fig. 2f shows the NLDFT pore size distribution curves. It can be clearly seen that FP-950 shows three peaks with a main peak centered at 0.72 nm, combined with two secondary peaks at 1.59 and 2.74 nm, respectively. And Fc–Por shows a main peak at 1.04 nm, coupled with two secondary peaks at 1.49 and 3.95 nm, respectively. The PSD curves based on the BJH model further confirm the existence of mesopores (Fig. S3†), in which prominent mesopores are observable for both samples. All this indicated the coexistence of micro- and meso-pores. The calculated BET surface area is 127.8 m2 g−1 for Fc–Por, whereas, after pyrolysis, it increases to 520.4 m2 g−1 for FP-950. The total pore volume is also increased with pyrolysis treatment. The details about the porosity is listed in Table S1.†
As observed from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 3a and b, the bimetallic CMP is composed of intergrown spherical particles. Similar to the polymer precursor, roughly spherical particles could also be found from the SEM (Fig. 3c and d) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. 3e and S4†) images of FP-950. However, different from the polymer precursor, black particles ascribed to the newly formed alloy particles could also be observed from Fig. 3e and S4.†Fig. 3f shows the HR-TEM images of FP-950, in which nanoscale crystallites (marked by a red rectangle) encapsulated by a graphitic carbon layer with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (002) crystal plane of graphitic carbon, could be clearly observed. The special core–shell structure could not only enhance the synergistic effect of Co3Fe7 and Co5.47N active sites, but also increase the catalytic stability.38 As seen from Fig. 3g, apart from the graphitized lattice fringes, clear lattice fringes with measured d-spacings of 0.202 and 0.207 nm could also observed, ascribed to the (110) lattice plane of the Co3Fe7 alloy and the (111) plane of Co5.47N, respectively.39,40 Furthermore, the EDS mapping confirms the coexistence of C and N elements in FP-950 (Fig. 4) which are homogeneously distributed in the entire carbon matrix. However, the signals of Fe and Co are highly localized at the sites where the alloy nanoparticles appeared. Fig. S5† shows the elemental mapping of FP-950 after concentrated acid etching, in which, the highlighted part of alloy particles disappeared, and instead, numerous hollow pore structures appeared.

XPS survey scan results in Fig. 5a further validated the coexistence of C, N, Fe and Co on the surface of FP-950. The details are listed in Table S2.† As depicted in Fig. 5b, the high-resolution N 1s spectra of FP-950 could be deconvoluted into five peaks, located at 398.1, 399.3, 400.1, 401.1, and 402.3 eV, assignable to the pyridinic-N (0.55 wt%), metal coordinated-N (1.18 wt%), pyrrolic-N (1.84 wt%), graphitic-N (1.17 wt%), and oxidized-N (0.99 wt%), respectively.41 As seen from Table S3,† the total content of pyridinic-N, metal-N and graphitic carbon which are commonly regarded as the catalytically active sites favorable for electrocatalysis is 2.90 wt%, higher than that of FP-850 (1.58 wt%) and FP-950 (0.35 wt%).42Fig. 5c shows the C 1s spectra of FP-950, in which, clear peaks related to C–C (284.8 eV), C–N (285.8 eV), CN (287.1 eV), and C–O (289.8 eV), respectively, could be clearly observed.43 The high-resolution Fe 2p spectra in Fig. 5d could be divided into six peaks. The peaks at around 709.8 and 719.7 eV correspond to zero-valent iron, originating from the alloy nanoparticles. The peaks centered at 712.6 eV and 725.2 eV are deemed as ionic state peaks, and the binding energy located at 715.9 and 732.2 eV are the satellite peaks.44 The Co 2p spectra (Fig. 5e) further confirm the existence of the Co3Fe7 alloy and Co–N species. Metallic Co peaks at 779.9 eV and 794.7 eV are derived from the alloy phase. The peaks at 784.8 eV and 797.3 eV are assignable to the Co–N species. The peak at around 789.1 eV and 800.5 eV are assigned to the satellite peaks.34 In conclusion, the high content of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, together with the metal coordinated-N in FP-950, can accelerate the electrochemical processes.41 The wide existence of alloy nanoparticles in the carbon-based catalysts with a hierarchical pore structure ensures fast electron transport during the catalytic process.9 Moreover, the ultrahigh specific surface areas are beneficial for the exposure of catalytically active sites.45 The XPS details of FP-850 and FP-1050 are shown in the supporting information (Fig. S6 and S7†).

Electrochemical performance
The appealing structure inspired us to study their electrocatalytic properties on the ORR, OER and HER, respectively. The catalytic performance based on the oxygen chemistry of pyrolysed samples and commercial Pt/C (20%, as the reference) (Fig. S8†) was examined via rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technologies. The HER is conducted on a glass carbon electrode using the three-electrode system. The potential used in this work is a value relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).
Preliminarily, the catalytic activity for the ORR was estimated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 0.1 M KOH saturated with oxygen or argon. As displayed in Fig. S9,† all the prepared catalysts features prominent reduction peaks in O2-saturated media, but not in the electrolytes saturated with argon, indicating the prominent catalytic activity of FP-X catalysts for the reduction of O2.46 Based on the LSV curves shown in Fig. 6a, among the FP-X samples, FP-950 shows the most prominent ORR activity with the most positive onset potential (Eonset = 0.94 V) and half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.808 V), as well as the highest limited current density (JL = 4.46 mA cm−2), which is superior to all these synthesized catalysts and close to that of Pt/C (Eonset = 1.03 V, E1/2 = 0.81 V and JL = 5.63 mA cm−2). The details of the electrochemical parameters are listed in Table S4.† Tafel slopes extracted from the LSV curves were plotted to evaluate the reaction kinetics of the as-prepared catalysts.47 As observed from Fig. 6b, FP-950 displayed a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec−1 comparable to that of Pt/C (71 mV dec−1), but much smaller than that of other catalysts (116 mV dec−1 for FP-850 and 120 mV dec−1 for FP-850), revealing an enhanced ORR kinetics of FP-950.48Fig. 6c shows the LSV curve of FP-950 collected at different rotation rates under alkaline conditions, respectively. One could obviously observe that the current density increased with the increase of rotating speeds of the electrode, indicating the first-order reaction kinetics toward dissolved oxygen. The corresponding K–L plots (the inset of Fig. 6c) were used to calculate the number of transferred electrons (n). The almost parallel fitting lines with an n value of 3.91 at 0.5 V revealed a four-electron dominated pathway for the reduction of oxygen in the measured electrolytes. RRDE measurements were performed to intuitively elucidate the ORR catalytic process. As seen from Fig. 6d, FP-950 presents four-electron reaction kinetics for the ORR in the tested medium, approaching the value of commercial Pt/C. And the yield of the two-electron byproduct, i.e., hydrogen peroxide, is less than 8.9% at the tested potential from 0.1 to 0.7 V, close to that of commercial Pt/C (less than 2.0%). The long-term running stability, as another vital parameter for the real application of catalysts, is determined by current–time chronoamperometric (i–t) measurements. As illustrated in Fig. 6e, FP-950 shows a long-term stability, outperforming that of commercial Pt/C under alkaline conditions. After a continuous cycle of 20000 s, the current of FP-950 decreased to 83.2% of its initial value, whereas, an intense current decrease of 65.1% was detected for the Pt/C loaded electrode. The LSV curve recorded before/after the i–t measurements also validates the prominent stability of FP-950 in alkaline media. As seen from Fig. S10,† FP-950 presents a negative shift of 27 mV for the E1/2 (Fig. S10a†) smaller than that of Pt/C (34 mV, Fig. S10b†) calculated under identical conditions. Fig. 6f shows the immunity of FP-950 to the small molecules (methanol) confirmed via i–t tests in alkaline electrolytes in which the methanol was injected at the time of 400 s. It is noted that FP-950 also displays a better tolerance to methanol exceeding that of Pt/C in alkaline electrolytes. As shown in Fig. 6f, contrary to the dramatic drop of the current density on Pt/C, the current value of FP-950 decreases more slightly after the addition of methanol, and with the time reaching 3000 s, the current density decreases to 70.9% (vs. 48.5% of Pt/C) of its initial value. And the prominent methanol immunity could also be validated from the LSV curve recorded before and after the addition of methanol (Fig. S10c and d†). Compared with the drastic change in the polarization curves of Pt/C, a more slight E1/2 change was observed for the FP-950 loaded electrode. Further information about the control samples is presented in Fig. S10.†

To explore the nature of the catalytic activity, both SCN−1 poisoning and acid leaching experiments were conducted.47 The electrochemical poisoning experiment was performed via injecting SCN−1 (5 mM) into the electrolyte which could be adsorbed by both M–N sites and metallic Co3Fe7 nanoparticles. As observed from Fig. S10e and f,† a dramatic current decay coupled with an intensive negative shift of E1/2 was detected after the injection of SCN−1, suggesting that both M–N sites and Co3Fe7 nanoparticles play a vital role in the catalytic process. Meanwhile, the E1/2 and limited current density of FP-950 treated with HCl (12 M) are changed dramatically (Fig. S10f†), revealing that the catalytic capacity is strongly related to Co3Fe7 nanoparticles. To further reveal the role of M–N sites, the SCN−1 poisoning experiment was further conducted on the catalyst by etching with acid, which could eliminate the influence of alloy nanoparticles. As seen from Fig. S7f,† compared with the LSV curves collected free of SCN−1, an intensive negative shift of E1/2 was observed after the injection of SCN−1, and the limited current density also changed dramatically. And such a finding validates that the M–N sites play a vital role in the catalytic process.
Subsequently, we evaluated the OER and HER activities of FP-X catalysts together with commercial Pt/C in O2-saturated 1 M KOH. As shown in Fig. 7a, among these samples, FP-950 shows the best activity with an overpotential of 346 mV (at 10 mA cm−2), smaller than that of IrO2 (488 mV) and other control samples (454 and 489 mV for FP-850 and FP-1050, respectively). And it is also comparable to some of the recently reported non-noble metal catalysts (Table S6†). As shown in Fig. 7b, compared with other counterparts, FP-950 also presents the smallest Tafel slope (89 mV dec−1), more positive than that of other FP-X catalysts (156 mV dec−1 for FP-850 and 178 mV dec−1 for FP-850) and IrO2 (125 mV dec−1), indicating favorable reaction kinetics towards the evolution of oxygen under alkaline conditions.49 The electrode reaction kinetics over the OER process was validated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) performed at 1.57 V vs. RHE. As revealed in Fig. S11,† FP-950 exhibits a charge transfer resistance (Rct = 14.4 Ω) smaller than that of other samples (107.1 Ω for FP-850 and 193.5 Ω for FP-1050), implying its superior electron transfer properties.50 Furthermore, FP-950 also presents a super long-term catalytic stability. As seen from Fig. 7c, after continuous i–t tests of 40000 s, the current density of FP-950 could still retain 94.3% of the initial value. And the excellent stability could be further seen from the LSV curves collected before and after the i–t test. It could be clearly seen from the inset part of Fig. 7c that after i–t tests of 40000 s, only a tiny change of the overpotential (17 mV) was detected for the FP-950 loaded electrode.

Then, the HER activities of FP-X samples were also evaluated. As observed from Fig. 7d, FP-950 also shows the best HER performance among the serial FP-X catalysts, which afforded a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at the electrode overpotential of 299 mV smaller than that of other prepared catalysts, and comparable to that of some of the recently reported non-noble metal catalysts (Table S6†). However, there are still some gaps compared with the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. In addition, the Tafel plots obtained from the HER polarization curves further validate the favorable catalytic kinetics of FP-950. As seen in Fig. 7e, the Tafel slope of FP-950 is measured to be 144 mV dec−1, smaller than that of FP-850 (166 mV dec−1) and FP-1050 (168 mV dec−1). Fig. S12† shows the EIS spectra of FP-X recorded at −1.33 V vs. RHE. As seen from the Nyquist plot, FP-950 displays a charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of 24.7 Ω, smaller than that of FP-850 (89.1 Ω) and FP-1050 (207.1 Ω). The long-term stability was determined by continuous CV tests for 3000 cycles. The LSV curve collected after the CV cycles is almost overlapped with the one recorded before the CV measurements with a negligible change of overpotential (9 mV), indicating the prominent stability of FP-950 (Fig. 7f).51 These results clearly demonstrate that FP-950 features excellent activity, strong stability, and high selectivity towards the ORR, OER and HER, simultaneously in alkaline electrolytes, all of which are extremely significant for the application in real devices.52
Zn-air battery performance
Regarding its outstanding OER and ORR activities and stabilities, a rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB) was assembled using FP-950 loaded carbon paper as the air cathode, Zn plate as the anode, and a mixed solution of KOH (6 M) and Zn(OAc)2 (0.2 M) as the electrolyte (Fig. 8a). Fig. 8b shows the charge and discharge polarization and corresponding power density curves, and the FP-950 battery delivers a peak power density of 167.4 mW cm−2 at a current density of 323.7 mA cm−2, comparable to many of the reported alloy catalysts (Table S7†). Moreover, as seen from Fig. 8c, the battery catalyzed by FP-950 could discharge continuously for 83 h by the galvanostatic discharge at 10 mA cm−2, indicating the super discharge stability of FP-950. In addition, FP-950 also presents an excellent dynamic response characteristic of voltage responding to the current set up and current set down from 0 to 150 to 0 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8d). As we can see from Fig. 8e, the ZAB equipped with FP-950 presents an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.486 V, and the batteries connected in series show an OCV of about 2.972 V. A fan (1.5 V) can be driven by a FP-950 catalyzed Zn-air battery (Fig. 8f). The specific capacity of the FP-950 catalyzed battery is calculated to be as high as 792 mA h g−1 normalized to the mass of consumed Zn (96.6% utilization of the theoretical capacity, 820 mA h g−1) at the discharge current density of 10 mA cm−2.53Fig. 8g shows the comparison of efficiency and long-term rechargeability of FP-950 and Pt/C for the home-made ZABs. When cycled at a constant current density of 10.0 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8h), the Zn-air battery based on FP-950 catalysts delivers an initial discharge potential of 1.13 V and a charge potential of 2.07 V, which are significantly better than those of the Pt/C–IrO2 battery (2.40 and 1.33 V). After 400 cycles of continuous operation, 1.10 V discharge potential and 2.10 V charge potential are still maintained, which strongly proves a high bifunctional activity and great stability of the FP-950 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 8i, in the first cycle, the voltage gap is 0.957 V with a discharge voltage of 1.119 V and a charge voltage of 2.079 V, whereas the corresponding trip efficiency is 57.4%. After the 200th cycle (middle), the voltage gap is 0.991 V with a discharge voltage of 1.129 V and a charge voltage of 2.121 V, and the corresponding trip efficiency decays to 53.5%, a decrease of only 3.9% compared to the first cycle. Even after the 400th cycle, the voltage gap only increased to 1.035 V with a discharge voltage of 1.095 V and a charge voltage of 2.130 V. Compared to the first cycle, the value corresponding to the trip efficiency drops to 51.4% and merely decreases by 6.0%, which indicates the efficiency and long-term charge–discharge stability of FP-950. Further analyzing the stability of FP-950, the catalyst underwent charge and discharge cycles were collected for further TEM and XPS characterization. As seen from Fig. S13,† similar to the original catalyst, the graphitic carbon layer encapsulated alloy particles with a typical core–shell structure could also be clearly observed after long charge–discharge cycles. Meanwhile, the XPS fittings (Fig. S14†) of the Fe and Co are almost identical to the original one. All these consequences further verified the superior stability of the prepared catalyst.

Overall water splitting performance
Benefitting from the excellent catalytic performance of FP-950 in both the OER and HER, we assembled a two-electrode water electrolyzer, whose anode and cathode are both supported by the carbon cloth loaded with 1 mg FP-950. Surprisingly, we can easily find H2 and O2 bubbles escaping from the surface of the electrode, and the observed voltage of the water electrolyzer with FP-950 is 1.63 V at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9a). Additionally, a super long-term durability is achieved with only slight current loss during 28000 s continuous water electrolysis (Fig. 9b). Based on the unique electrocatalytic activity of FP-950 observed in the ORR, OER, and HER, a self-powered electrochemical water splitting system, powered by two series-connected zinc-air batteries, is demonstrated. As shown in Fig. 9c, both H2 and O2 were produced simultaneously upon connecting the two zinc-air batteries in series. And the generated volume ratio of H2 to O2 was very close to the expected 2:1 stoichiometry for full water splitting with an average H2 production rate of 569.5 μmol h−1 at a voltage of 2.97 V powered by two home-made Zn-air batteries in series (Fig. 9d).

Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel bimetallic CMP composed of ferrocene and Co–porphyrin was well designed and facilely prepared through a simple one-pot homogeneous polymerization of 1,1′-ferrocenediformaldehyde and pyrrole. Direct pyrolysis of Fc–Por achieved carbon-based catalysts with the encapsulated Co3Fe7 alloy and Co5.47N nanoparticles. FP-950 featuring a hierarchical pore structure and high porosity presents acceptable catalytic activity for the ORR, OER, and HER, simultaneously. Furthermore, the special carbon encapsulation structure of nanohybrids endowed FP-950 with excellent stability which could be used as a catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries and water splitting devices. Further experiments validate that the overall water splitting could be realized in a self-powered manner under ambient conditions using FP-950 as the sole catalyst.
