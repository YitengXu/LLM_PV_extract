    , Accepted 17th March 2020First published on 17th March 2020AbstractThe rapid improvements in the performance of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells have been astonishing but their commercialized production requires further achievements on device stability and efficiency. Herein, we introduce a bifunctional additive, biuret, with multiple Lewis base groups to regulate the crystallization process of perovskite crystals and passivate the defects at grain boundaries. Compared with the control, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), films processed with biuret exhibit increased grain size, reduced trap state density, and more uniform local photoluminescence. The addition of biuret leads to suppressed trap-assisted nonradiative recombination and an efficiency improvement from 18.26% to 21.16%, which is among the highest efficiency for MAPbI3 solar cells with the mesoscopic structure. Meanwhile, as biuret interacts with uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide from the iodoplumbate complex on two adjacent perovskite grains, the thermal durability of the MAPbI3 film is enhanced due to the crosslink through chemical bonding. Under 85 °C annealing in nitrogen, the biuret-modified device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after 12 days while the control cells lose more than half the efficiency.
1. Introduction
Solar cells based on organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite absorbers have received tremendous interest due to their cost-effective processing and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). With the great efforts of the perovskite solar cell (PSC) community, the PCEs of PSCs have been dramatically improved from the initial 3.8% to the presently certified 25.2% during the last decade.1,2 However, the enhancement of photovoltaic performance and stability is still required for commercialization of PSCs.3–6 It is widely recognized that a high density of charged ionic defects will be inevitably generated at the surface and grain boundaries of polycrystalline grains during the thermal annealing process, due to the low thermal stability and low formation energy of perovskite materials containing organic components.7,8 The degradation of perovskite films has been reported to preferentially occur at grain boundaries owing to the trap-assisted carrier recombination.9–11 Therefore, regulation of the perovskite crystallization behavior to increase the grain size and reduce the grain boundary density is considered as an active strategy for enhancing the device efficiency and stability.
In this context, numerous strategies including solvent/anti-solvent engineering, composition engineering, and additive engineering have been developed.12,13 Among these approaches, the introduction of additives has made significant progress in this goal over the last few years.14,15 For instance, liquid additives such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)16 and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)17 were reported to retard the perovskite crystallization rate thus enlarging the grain size and improve the film crystallinity. However, this kind of volatile additive easily escapes during the film formation process and cannot perform defect passivation and/or stability enhancement functions. Some additives can achieve stability enhancement by in situ forming a grain encapsulation layer, in which defect passivation was absent yet due to lack of functional groups that could effectively interact with charged defects.18,19 These defects can still reduce the photovoltaic performance and cause device instability issues, including ion migration and related hysteresis phenomena, and device degradation in ambient air.7 To passivate these ionic defects, molecules with Lewis acid or base groups have been reported to perform as electron acceptors or donors that can interact with the charged defects, therefore eliminating the associated defect-induced charge traps.20–22
Here, we introduce biuret, a compound with multiple Lewis base groups, as the perovskite precursor additive. Biuret acts as an O-donor to strongly coordinate with lead iodide (PbI2) and form an intermediate phase, which further slows down the perovskite crystallization rate. The connection between adjacent perovskite crystals is enhanced by the crosslinking structure of biuret, which induces excellent thermal durability of the MAPbI3 film. Meanwhile, the residual biuret remaining in the final perovskite film efficiently passivates charged ionic defects. As a result, additive molecular modulation simultaneously increases the perovskite grain size and crystallinity and decreases the density of defects acting as centers for nonradiative charge carrier recombination. Accordingly, we achieve a PCE of over 21% for MAPbI3 solar cells with almost constant efficiency at 85°C for 12 days.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Morphology and crystallization behavior
As shown in Fig. 1A, the biuret additive was added into the MAPbI3 precursor solution, which was then spin-coated onto the mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer. As can be seen from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the biuret-modified perovskite films exhibit remarkably enlarged grains compared to the control sample while the surface morphology becomes rough when the amount of biuret exceeds 2 mol% (Fig. 1B, C and S1†). The average grain size (Fig. S2†) was estimated to be about 375 nm for the pristine perovskite film and approximately 729 nm for the perovskite film with improved morphology at 2 mol% biuret. The increase of grain size is attributed to the formation of a methylammonium iodide (MAI)·PbI2·DMSO·biuret adduct, leading to the increased activation energy, which decreases the number of nucleations and slows down the crystal growth.22,23 The XRD pattern of this adduct is shown in Fig. S3.† Retarding the crystallization rate is further observed from Fig. S4† where the color variation of the biuret-modified perovskite film during the annealing process is much slower than that of the control film.

(E) The peak intensity and FWHM of the (110) plane as a function of the biuret amount. 
The influence of biuret on the crystalline properties of perovskite films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. 1D). The XRD patterns in Fig. 1D show no additional peaks or peak shifts after the addition of biuret, indicating that the addition of biuret in the precursor does not influence the crystal structure. The main peaks located at 14.1° and 28.4° correspond to the (110) and (220) crystal planes of the cubic perovskite phase, respectively.24 The enhanced diffraction peak intensities and reduced full width half-maximum (FWHM) values of the (110) plane indicated that the perovskite crystallization was enhanced after the addition of biuret (Fig. 1E). According to the Scherrer equation (see the ESI† for calculation details), we calculated the crystallite size with the FWHM of the (110) peak. At an optimum ratio of 2 mol% biuret, the crystallite size increased from 51.8 nm to 66.3 nm, which is consistent with the SEM results (Fig. 1B and C). In addition, the ratio of the (110) peak intensity to the (222) peak intensity increased from 8.1 to 10.9 upon incorporation of 2 mol% biuret. This underlines that biuret plays an important role in the preferred orientation of perovskite crystals. The occurrence of the preferred orientation towards the (110) direction would be beneficial for enhanced charge transport.25
The attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) measurements were conducted to investigate whether biuret remained in the perovskite film after the annealing process (Fig. 2A). Compared to the pristine MAPbI3 film, the biuret-modified MAPbI3 film presents characteristic peaks around 3600 to 3300 cm−1 and 1800 to 1600 cm−1, which were ascribed to the N–H stretch and CO stretch of biuret, respectively, confirming the presence of biuret after film formation. The N–H stretching vibration peaks of the biuret were shifted in combination with MAPbI3, which indicates a chemical interaction of the ammonium group in biuret with the perovskite component (Fig. S5†). A magnified fingerprint region containing the characteristic peaks of the CO bond is shown in Fig. 2B. The peak for CO stretching vibration of biuret was observed to shift from 1722 to 1713 cm−1 in the biuret-modified MAPbI3 film, which is related to the extent of electron delocalization in the N–CO–N system. The coordination effect of the oxygen atom is considered to decrease the double bond character of the CO bonds and conduct a shift of the carbonyl stretching mode to lower frequencies.26 This result indicates that there is interaction between the carboxyl groups of biuret and the perovskite component. This interaction was further confirmed by the shift of the Pb 4f orbital in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the biuret-modified MAPbI3 film (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, an evident O 1s peak centered at about 532.7 eV was observed for the biuret-modified MAPbI3 film (Fig. 2D). A negligible O 1s peak was also observed for the pristine MAPbI3 sample, possibly a result of a small amount of oxygen adsorbed on the sample surface and/or diffused into the sample during sample preparation.27 As for C 1s spectra of the control MAPbI3 film (Fig. 2E), a peak component at about 286.2 eV is assigned to the carbon from the methyl group in MAPbI3. Meanwhile, a small shoulder at about 284.8 eV should be assigned to adventitious carbon in the environment.28 After the introduction of biuret, a new C 1s component emerges at about 290.2 eV, which stems from biuret. As for N 1s spectra (Fig. 2F), a peak component at about 402.3 eV was present in both samples and is assigned to the nitrogen from the methylammonium group.29 At the same time, a small shoulder peak at about 400.8 eV was observed in the biuret-modified sample, which originated from the biuret molecule. These observations further confirm that biuret remained in the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite film and the passivation of Pb2+ defects by the carbonyl groups.

Based on the above analyses, the main chemical reactions involved in the formation process of perovskite grains are proposed. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, MAI, PbI2, and biuret are dissolved in the mixed solvent of dimethylformamide (DMF) and DMSO, and then the light yellow and transparent precursor solution is spin-coated on the TiO2 coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrate. PbI2 as a Lewis acid can form a coordination bond with the O-donor type of Lewis base (DMSO and biuret). After anti-solvent (chlorobenzene) treatment, the MAI·PbI2·DMSO·biuret intermediate phase is obtained. DMSO that could help to obtain a high-quality perovskite film will be thoroughly removed after annealing for a few minutes, but biuret still exists in the perovskite film at this time and in the following annealing process. The residual biuret can further promote the ripening process of the perovskite films, contributing to the formation of larger size grains. Moreover, the remnant biuret molecules in the films interacted with the perovskites through a coordinative covalent bond to passivate defects at the surface and grain boundaries.

(C) XRD patterns of pristine and aged biuret-containing MAPbI3 films for 168 h at 85 °C in a N2 glovebox. Peaks indexed with * originate from PbI2. 
To determine how the biuret influences the thermal stability of perovskite, XRD analysis on the pristine and thermally aged perovskite films was conducted. The analysis was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere and in the dark to avoid the influences from moisture, oxygen, and light. Under these conditions, an obvious distinction between control and biuret-containing samples appears, indicating a difference in their resistance toward thermal-induced decomposition. Fig. 3B and C show the XRD evolution for the control and biuret-containing MAPbI3 films after 168 h (1 week) of continuous thermal annealing at 85 °C. For the control sample, a strong PbI2 diffraction peak appears at 12.7° after the annealing test, and the diffraction peak of PbI2 is even stronger than that of perovskite (Fig. 3B). The weak perovskite diffraction peaks suggest a serious degradation of the MAPbI3 material. In contrast, the biuret-containing samples largely retain their initial features, demonstrating enhanced thermal stability (Fig. 3C). Although there was a tiny PbI2 peak at 12.7° in the aged target sample, the MAPbI3 (110) plane signal was still strong. The ratio of the MAPbI3 (110) peak intensity at 14.1° to the PbI2 (001) peak intensity at 12.7° was calculated to be 3.83 compared to 0.77 of the control sample. This could be attributed to the strong interaction between MAPbI3 and biuret molecules, which increases the activation energy for the thermal decomposition.20,30,31
2.2. Optical and electronic properties
To gain more insight into the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films before and after adding biuret, a series of optical and electrical measurements were conducted. Fig. S6† shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films. The film with the biuret additive shows stronger absorption than the control one because of the improved morphology and crystallinity (Fig. 1). Then, we plotted the curves of the logarithmic absorption coefficient (α) as a function of the photon energy to investigate the Urbach energy (Eu), as illustrated in Fig. 4A. Generally, higher Eu correlates to more trap states (subgap tail states) in the perovskite films. Here, the Eu is derived from the Urbach tail near the optical band edge. In the lower photon energy region, α follows the Urbach empirical rule by the equation32 (1)where α0 is a constant, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of light. Therefore, the Eu can be estimated from the slope above by fitting and calculating using the Urbach empirical equation. The relatively low Eu is indicative of a low degree of energetic disorder, leading to reduced subgap tail states and thereby decreasing nonradiative recombination. We found that Eu values of the biuret-modified sample (28.5 meV) are lower than those of the control sample (33.9 meV), which indicates the passivation of subgap tail states by biuret.

(C and D) Dark I–V curves of electron-only devices with the device structure shown in the inset. (E and F) Spectral PL mapping of perovskite films. 
The trap state density of the perovskite films was quantitatively measured based on the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model by measuring the dark current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the electron-only devices with a structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag. Fig. 4C and D show the dark J–V curves of the corresponding samples, in which three regions can be distinctly observed. The current signal increases linearly with the voltage at the ohmic regime, then shows dramatically rapid nonlinear growth in the trap-filled limited (TFL) regime, and eventually exhibits quadratic voltage dependence in the trap-free SCLC (Child) regime. The trap state density can be estimated from the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) which corresponds to the onset voltage of the TFL region, as shown in the following equation33 (2)where e is the unit charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), L is the thickness of the perovskite layer, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite film,34 and nt is the trap state density. The VTFL of the control and biuret-modified devices is evaluated to be 0.35 and 0.21 V, respectively. Therefore, the trap state density had declined from 7.7 × 1015 (control device) to 4.6 × 1015 cm−3 (target device), consistent with the trend of Eu values. These results imply that the addition of biuret could effectively enhance the quality of the perovskite films by suppressing surface defects.
We then conducted photoluminescence (PL) measurements to investigate the influence of trap density reduction on perovskite emission properties. As shown in Fig. 4B, the PL peak intensity of the biuret-modified perovskite film is more than double compared with the control film, indicating reduced nonradiative charge recombination of the biuret-modified perovskite film. Meanwhile, the biuret-modified film displayed a blue-shifted PL peak compared with that of the control one, which indicates that biuret can passivate the trap states near the surface or along grain boundaries.21 To fully understand the observed phenomenon, micro-PL mapping of these perovskite films was recorded. Fig. 4E and F show the mapping of the PL peak position over 100 × 100 μm2 regions. Compared with the control samples (Fig. 4E), a much more uniform distribution in spectral emission is observed for the biuret-modified samples (Fig. 4F), suggesting the homogeneous and defect-less film surface, consistent with the single-point PL measurements (Fig. 4B). In addition, the average PL emission peaks of these samples are calculated to be 776.5 (control sample) and 769.6 nm (biuret sample). This blue-shift on the microscale regions further confirmed that the passivation effects of the defects induced by biuret can benefit the full surface of the perovskite film.35
2.3. Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of MAPbI3 PSCs was assessed with different amounts of the biuret additive (Fig. S7†). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The amount of added biuret varied from 0 mol% to 4 mol% with respect to PbI2. As the biuret additive increased from 0 mol% (control) to 2 mol%, the Voc and FF of the PSCs were gradually enhanced. With the addition of 2 mol% biuret, the average Voc and FF were improved from 1.06 ± 0.01 V to 1.11 ± 0.01 V and 75.33 ± 0.42% to 79.42 ± 0.37%. This resulted in an enhancement in the average PCE from 18.06 ± 0.17% to 20.70 ± 0.75%, while further increasing the amount of the biuret additive leads to the decrease of photovoltaic performance. The excess biuret in the perovskite films may impede charge transport along the grain boundaries, which also accounts for the poor surface morphology in Fig. S1B.†

Fig. 5A shows the J–V curves of the best-performing devices, with the photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1. The control device exhibits a PCE of 18.26% with short-circuit current density (Jsc) = 22.69 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.06 V, and FF = 76.07%. In contrast, when 2 mol% biuret was introduced, the Jsc, Voc, and FF are increased to 23.55 mA cm−2, 1.11 V, and 80.73%, yielding a promising PCE up to 21.16%, which to our knowledge is the highest PCE for MAPbI3 solar cells with a mesoporous electron transport layer (Table S3†). Fig. S8† shows the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the champion devices. The integrated current densities for the control and biuret-containing devices are 21.64 and 22.65 mA cm−2, respectively, which is consistent with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves within 5% deviation. Fig. 5B and C show the J–V curves measured in both reverse- and forward-scan directions with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters listed in Table S2.† It was found that the device with the biuret additive has almost identical J–V characteristics with negligible hysteresis. To quantify the reduced hysteresis, we calculated the hysteresis index (HI) based on the method described in previous reports. The HI decreases from 0.086 (control device) to 0.004 (biuret-modified device). The effective suppression on hysteresis behavior greatly improves the consistency for extracted photovoltaic parameters in different scan directions, which can be ascribed to the reduced density of trap states and suppressed ion motion and/or surface charge trapping.

Steady-state power output under continuous illumination can give more accurate and reliable photovoltaic performance of devices under working conditions. Fig. 5D and E show the steady-state PCE and current density measured at a maximum power point. The PCEs of the champion devices with and without biuret stabilize at 20.86% and 17.74% with photocurrent densities of 21.96 and 19.93 mA cm−2, respectively, which are very close to the values obtained from the J–V measurements. As shown in the Fig. 5D and E insets, the photocurrent of the biuret-modified device increased quickly to maximum steady-state photocurrent. However, the photocurrent of the control device needed more than 4 s to fully saturate. This indicates that the charge extraction kinetics in the control device are longer than those in the biuret-modified device, which is responsible for pronounced hysteresis before the addition of biuret.
2.4. Charge recombination
Nonradiative charge recombination is an important process that influences the photovoltaic performance, hysteresis behavior, and long-term stability of PSCs. To further understand the improvement of device performance, the charge recombination process in the complete devices was characterized. Fig. 5F shows the plots of −dV/dJ versus (Jsc − J)−1 and the linear fitting curves for the control and biuret-modified devices. The ideality factor m can be derived from the linear fitting results.24 The biuret-modified device exhibits a decreased m value (1.69) compared with the control device (2.02). The ideality factor m depends on charge diffusion and recombination processes.36 The smaller the value of m is, the less recombination is caused by traps in the device. Hence, a smaller m means that the charge recombination in the biuret-modified device was reduced due to the reduction of trap states.
To provide more solid evidence on the charge recombination process, the dependence of the Voc on light intensity for the control and biuret-modified devices was measured. The slope deviation of Vocversus the natural logarithm of light intensity from kBT/q indicates the occurrence of nonradiative trap-assisted recombination (monomolecular recombination), which has been reported to be a dominant recombination pathway in PSCs.37,38 As shown in Fig. 6A, a slope of 1.88 kBT/q and 1.34 kBT/q was estimated for the control and biuret-modified cells, respectively. This suggests that the trap-assisted charge recombination process was effectively suppressed by the biuret. Open-circuit voltage decay measurements were also performed to investigate the transient process of charge recombination. As shown in Fig. 6B, compared to the control device, the biuret-modified device demonstrates a prominently slower Voc decay. The Voc decay time constant of the biuret-modified device (1.43 ms) was estimated to be ∼5 times larger than that of the control device (0.28 ms). The electron lifetimes (τn) are also calculated using the following equation39 (3)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the positive elementary charge. As shown in Fig. S9,† the biuret-modified device displays a longer τn with less charge recombination, which leads to the improvement of photovoltaic performance, especially promotion of the Voc.

2.5. Device stability
The device thermal stability was evaluated under 85 °C continuous annealing in a nitrogen glovebox. The introduction of biuret demonstrated a strong positive effect on the stabilization of the unsealed MAPbI3 devices. As shown in Fig. 7A, the biuret-modified devices showed excellent thermal stability, retaining 94% of its initial efficiency after 288 h (12 days). In contrast, the control cells retained only 50% of the original efficiency after 192 h (8 days), the degeneration of which is similar to other reports.30 Moreover, the device storage stability was also evaluated in ambient air (temperature of 20–25 °C; relative humidity of 30–40%) using unencapsulated cells in the dark (Fig. 7B). In contrast to the observed efficiency degradation (that maintains 81% over 1000 h), in the control devices, the biuret-modified devices retained more than 93% of the original efficiency over 1000 h, demonstrating obviously enhanced stability in the natural environment. The enhancement of air stability could be ascribed to the improved morphology and crystallinity of the biuret-modified perovskite films, as well as the passivation of defects at the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films by the residual biuret.13,20

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple and effective approach by using the bifunctional additive biuret to obtain high-performance MAPbI3 solar cells. The strong interactions between biuret and perovskite components could retard the grain growth rate, which facilitates the growth of high-quality perovskite films with large grain size, preferred orientation, reduced defect density, and superior electronic properties. Meanwhile, the remnant biuret in the final films can passivate ionic defects and act as a molecular lock to prevent thermal degradation. As a result, we achieve greatly enhanced solar cell performance with efficiencies exceeding 21% for MAPbI3 solar cells, accompanied by outstanding thermal and environmental stability. We believe that the present work will stimulate other successful developments on bifunctional additive molecules in the future.
