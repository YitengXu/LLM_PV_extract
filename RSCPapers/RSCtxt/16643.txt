    , Accepted 4th October 2018First published on 9th October 2018AbstractThe great interest in developing efficient and stable bifunctional electrodes for electrocatalytic water splitting is due to the rapid growth in demand for sustainable and renewable energy sources. Here, we present an original electrode design strategy which can be used for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This strategy is based on the direct formation of active catalytic material on the electrode surface during electrolysis. In our case, cobalt hydroxides (β-Co(OH)2 and CoO(OH) for HER and OER, respectively) in a carbon matrix are produced by the chemical and electrochemical transformation of various forms (glass, glass-ceramic and polycrystalline) of Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 during electrolysis in 1 M NaOH solution. The CoOx(OH)y/C composites demonstrate remarkable stability over time (more than 50 h), and bifunctional catalytic activity with an overall water splitting potential close to 1.8 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The range of overpotentials for OER and HER is 346–365 and 326–369 mV, respectively. These electrodes can invert the OER and HER processes with a total overpotential of 0.6 V in the cell. This remarkable CoO(OH) ↔ Co(OH)2 inversion in the carbon matrix its further utility for creating bifunctional electrodes for long-life water splitting cells.
Introduction
Over the last decade, success in the production of electricity from renewable sources, such as solar or wind energies, has set a new challenge in modern power engineering. Because the energy generation from these sources is unpredictable and recurrent, it is important to use the sources efficiently. There are two main ways to solve the problem: storing electric power in the rechargeable batteries or supercapacitors, or converting electric power to another form. In the conversion strategy, splitting water molecules to form hydrogen and oxygen allows the energy to be stored in an ideal eco-friendly form.1,2 However, in practice, this reaction requires a large overpotential compared with the theoretical value (1.23 V). Currently, the most effective and stable electrocatalysts with relatively low overpotential values are materials based on noble metals.3,4 Ru and Ir oxides demonstrate good performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas metallic Pt performs well in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).5–8 However, the high cost of these materials limits their applications and prevents the implementation of water conversion technology on a large industrial scale. A number of compounds based on transition metals, as well as Mo, W, and their combinations and composites with carbon, show attractive catalytic activity in electrolysis.2,9–19
The development of bifunctional electrodes for water splitting is an important task because it involves the manufacture of only one type of universal electrode.20 The HER and OER mechanisms are different, which requires the presence of different catalytic sites on the surface.21–23 For electrocatalysts, a high surface area with efficient charge transfer to the current collector can facilitate the preliminary growth of the nanostructure on the electrode surface (e.g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, nanotubes and nanorods with various morphologies).15,16,18,19 Another approach deals with the formation of catalyst thin films on the surface of the current collector during electrochemical reactions.13,24–27 This process favors high stability and efficiency, but the current collector area becomes a limiting factor. To combine the advantages of these two approaches, we have considered another possible method of electrode production. The method is based on two sequential steps: (i) covering the current collector with the initial composite; (ii) formation of the nanoscale active catalyst on the electrode surface by chemical or electrochemical conversion during water splitting. To verify these principles, the Co-containing phosphate system was chosen for investigation.
Recently, substantial attention has been paid to Co-containing compounds (oxide/hydroxides, phosphides, phosphates) because of their excellent simultaneous OER and HER activity.24,28–35 In these systems, the electrochemical conversion of the initial catalyst particles is often observed. For example, Ryu et al. showed that the bifunctional catalyst, CoP, retains its composition during HER, but during OER it is transformed to the oxo/hydroxo-form of Co.36 Yang et al.37 and Jiang et al.38 reported that the conversion of a phosphide/phosphate-containing thin film on the electrode surface improves the catalytic efficiency. A similar conversion was also observed for the mixed Co–Ni phosphide/phosphate system (Ni–Co–P) in alkaline media.39 The literature indicates that for successful application to OER catalysis, cobalt species on the electrode surface must be converted to CoOx, which facilitates the Co2+ ↔ Co3+ ↔ Co4+ transition.40 For oxides/hydroxides or phosphates, this conversion can be achieved easily via tuning the solution pH.41 Therefore, various Co-containing systems should be studied in greater detail.
The appearance of the final electrocatalyst particles in the system is a dynamic process. Thus, their formation is influenced by the chemical, phase, and granulometric composition of precursors, the nature of the electrolysis media, and the mode and time of the electrochemical transformation. The large number of these factors means that we cannot estimate their simultaneous impact in the present work. Therefore, some factors are neglected in this study. As the initial precursor, different forms of Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 (glass, glass-ceramic and polycrystalline) were used in combination with a carbon matrix. The electrochemical treatment was performed in 1 M NaOH solution, which should provoke the predicted conversion of the initial phosphate to the oxo/hydroxo-form of Co.
During the long-term stability tests the phosphate material in all samples is converted to stable nanoforms of β-Co(OH)2 and CoO(OH) for HER and OER, respectively. The value of the overpotential for the solid-state sample at 10 mA cm−2 is 321 mV, which equals that of the conventional RuO2 electrocatalyst (319 mV, under the same conditions). These new chemical species also exhibit sustainable bifunctional catalytic activity over more than 50 h. Moreover, the electrodes are capable of Co2+ ↔ Co3+ electrochemical inversion even after polarity switching, preserving the same overpotential value. The results indicate that this approach is promising for the production of electrodes with bifunctional catalytic properties for water splitting.
Experimental
Synthetic procedures
NaPO3 and Co3O4 (analytical grade) were used as initial reagents. The reaction process was consistent with the scheme 4NaPO3 + Co3O4 → Na4Co3P4O15 + ½O2(1)
To obtain polycrystalline, glass or glass-ceramic samples the following techniques were used.
(i) The polycrystalline sample of Na4Co3P4O15 (SS) was synthesized using a conventional solid-state reaction. A starting mixture of NaPO3 and Co3O4 (4:1 molar ratio) was milled for 0.5 h in an agate mortar. The powder was transferred to a ceramic crucible and pre-heated at 400 °C for 2 h. Then, the powder was re-ground and finally calcined at the optimized temperature (700 °C) for 50 h.
(ii) The Na4Co3P4O15 glass (G) was obtained by a melt-quenching method. An appropriate amount of Co3O4 was dissolved in NaPO3 flux at 1050 °C in a platinum crucible and kept under isothermal conditions for 6 h. The blue glass was formed by pouring the melt onto a steel plate.
(iii) To fabricate the glass-ceramic sample (GC), some of sample G was ground well in an agate mortar for 0.5 h and heat treated at 600 °C for 6 h in a ceramic crucible.
Chemical stability tests
The specimen tests were performed at pH values of 7, 13 and 14 using phosphate buffer solution (100 mL of 1 M buffer solution, containing 57.7 mL of 1 M Na2HPO4 and 42.3 mL of 1 M NaH2PO4), and 0.1 or 1 M NaOH. The samples (≈0.2 g) were left in the solutions for 7 days, and then they were separated by filtration, washed with distilled water, dried in air and analyzed.
Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for all samples were collected at room temperature (40 kV, 30 mA, 5–60° per step, 2 s per step) by the conventional Bragg–Brentano technique on a θ–2θ Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λCuKα1 = 1.54056 Å) and graphite counter monochromator. The microstructure and morphology were obtained by SEM at a 10 kV accelerating voltage on a Magellan 400 scanning electron microscope equipped with an Oxford X-Max microanalysis EDS system after sputtering with Au, which was used to confirm the composition. The FTIR spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 at room temperature mixed with KBr (for IR spectroscopy grade, PIKE Technology) using a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1S spectrometer. The thermal behavior was studied on a simultaneous thermogravimetry/differential thermal analyzer (DTG-60H, Shimadzu). The chemical states of the elements under the catalyst surfaces were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements performed on a VG ESCALAB MK II electron spectrometer.
Preparation of working electrodes and electrochemical measurements
All Na4Co3P4O15 powders were mechanically milled in a planetary ball mill under the following conditions: atmosphere, air; medium, alcohol; milling speed, 565 rpm; ball-to-powder mass ratio, 10:1; and milling time, 1 h. For the fabrication of the working electrodes, the ground powders were mixed with conductive carbon black (Super P) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 85:10:5. Then, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) was added to make a slurry. The slurry was pasted onto carbon fiber (HCP331N) with a 1 × 1 cm2 working area and dried at 100 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. In addition, to prepare the electrodes covered with Pt/C or RuO2 (used as benchmarks for investigating HER and OER, respectively) with carbon black and PVDF (95:5 weight ratio), a similar preparation technique was used.
All the electrochemical studies were carried out using an electrochemical analyzer/workstation (Model 760E, CH Instruments). A typical three-electrode set-up was used with a Hg/HgO electrode as a reference electrode and a platinum plate as a counter electrode. The potential measured against the Hg/HgO electrode was converted according to the Nernst equation, Evs. RHE = Evs. Hg/HgO + 0.097 + 0.059 pH. Electrochemical measurements were performed in 1 M NaOH solution (pH ≈ 14). Multiple cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans were performed for 10 cycles at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 until stable work was obtained before the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were collected at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 with iR correction. Chronopotentiometry was carried out under a constant current density of 20 or 10 mA cm−2. AC impedance spectroscopy was performed in the frequency range from 105 to 10−2 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV at the open circuit potential.
Results and discussion
Double phosphates with the general formula Na4MII3P4O15 (MII – Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) exhibit promising electrochemical properties, which may make them suitable as electrode materials in Na/Li-ion cells and hybrid supercapacitors.42–48 The crystal structure of these mixed polyanionic compounds, Na4MII3(PO4)2(P2O7), consist of infinite parallel MII3P2O13-sheets [MII1O6 + MII2O6 + MII3O5 + P1O4 + P2O4] linked by two types of P2O7 groups. This type of linkage produces an open 3D framework with large channels, in which four types of Na sites are located.49–52 In general, the presence of various MIIOx forms and their complex structural evolution during electrochemical reactions44,46,47 can be a favorable factor for the electrocatalytic OER process, as it has been shown for a number of double orthophosphates or diphosphates.53–55 However, the use of mixed polyanionic phosphates for water splitting has not been studied. Also, there is practically no information on Na4MII3(PO4)2(P2O7) stability towards various types of aqueous alkaline or acid electrolytes. For example, existing studies do not consider the products after chemical or electrochemical conversion.48 There are only two commonly used synthesis routes for Na4MII3(PO4)2(P2O7), which are modifications of solid-state or flux techniques.42–44,48,49,52 As a possible alternative, glass-ceramic technology should be considered. In recent years, this approach has been used to produce complex phosphates with practically important electrochemical properties.56–58 For comparison, in this work, we used both the solid-state and glass-ceramic methods.
To estimate the phase composition of the polycrystalline sample obtained by the solid-state method (SS), XRD analysis and FTIR were used. A typical XRD pattern, shown in Fig. 1a, confirms presence of the pure Na4Co3P4O15 phase (PDF #00-089-0579, orthorhombic system, sp. gr. Pn21a). The XRD data are consistent with the results observed by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 1b). In the FTIR spectrum of the sample, there is a broad band at 1200–880 cm−1, which includes many overlapping peaks. According to the literature,52 these peaks are assigned to a combination of the vibration modes of the P2O7 and PO4 groups. The sharp peak at 722 cm−1 corresponds to asymmetric stretching of the P–O–P bonds and indicates the presence of the P2O7 group.

The halo pattern with no distinguishable peaks in the XRD spectrum indicates that the melt-quenched sample (G) is amorphous (Fig. 1a). Moreover, all peaks in the FTIR spectrum are expanded, which confirms the partial disorder in the structure (Fig. 1b). During the fabrication of the glass-ceramic species (GC) from melt-quenched glass (G), the thermal behavior of the precursor was examined by differential thermal analysis (DTA). As shown in Fig. 1c, the DTA curve contains two weak exothermic peaks at 435 and 468 °C and one strong endothermic peak at 732 °C. The appearance of the first two peaks is caused by crystallization of the amorphous material to a glass-ceramic, whereas the last peak is at the melting point of the phosphate. Considering these data, we chose 600 °C as the heat treatment temperature to prepare the GS sample. After annealing for 1–3 h, the sample contained a trace amount of impurities as intermediate products (Fig. S1, ESI†). When the thermal treatment time was increased to 6 h, only the target phase of Na4Co3P4O15 (GS) was formed.
Before the electrodes were manufactured, the samples were milled in the planetary ball mill. The SEM images (Fig. 1d and S2, ESI†) show that the powders after milling have an average particle size smaller than 10 μm. Then, to test the chemical stability of the pristine material before the electrochemical processing, these fine powders were treated in aqueous media with different pH values. As expected, the phosphate materials were stable in aqueous solution at pH 7 (XRD and FTIR analysis, Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). However, in the alkaline media, there was a gradual degradation of all samples accompanied by the material turning from pink to light brown (Fig. S5, ESI†). According to the XRD data (Fig. S4, ESI†), the complex phosphate was converted to β-Co(OH)2 (PDF #00-003-0913, hexagonal system, sp. gr. Pm1). Moreover, the degradation increased as the pH increased from 13 to 14 (EDS data, Fig. S6, ESI†). This result was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†). When the pH value increased, the intensity of the absorption bands decreased in the region of 1200–880 cm−1, which is related to the of PO4/P2O7 group vibration, whereas the absorption band around 3600 cm−1 assigned to the β-Co(OH)2 O–H bond increased rapidly. Consequently, the phosphate degradation can be represented by Na4Co3P4O15 + 8NaOH → 3Co(OH)2 + 4Na3PO4 + H2O(2)
It is expected that an alkaline electrolyte (1 M NaOH) will gradually destroy the initial forms of phosphate and subsequently form cobalt hydroxide. Thus, for our investigation we used 1 M NaOH solution.
Before conducting the electrochemical tests, the electrodes were characterized by SEM (including EDS and element mapping) and by XPS. SEM shows that Na4Co3P4O15 particles form small agglomerations with a mosaic distribution in the carbon matrix (Fig. 2), confirming the formation of a homogeneous composite. The XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 3 and their interpretation is given in Table S1, ESI.† The decomposed Co 2p spectrum consists of four peaks corresponding to the spin–orbital splitting state, 2p3/2 and 2p1/2. The intense peak with a maximum at 781.9 eV and satellite at 785.2 eV are attributed to the 2p3/2 state. Thus, the peak at 797.9 eV and its satellite at 803.0 eV are assigned to the 2p1/2 state.39,55 The P 2p spectrum shows a clear single peak at 133.3 eV, which indicates the presence of a phosphate species.55,59 This conclusion was confirmed by the O 1s spectrum, in which the two decomposed polynomial peaks (530.9 and 531.8 eV) belong to the P–O bonds.55,59 Another two intense peaks with binding energies of 284.8 and 1071.9 eV correspond to C 1s and Na 1s, respectively.

The OER and HER activities for water splitting were measured using a typical three-electrode cell in 1 M NaOH solution. The electrochemical investigation includes two identical stages of successive measurements for both OER and HER for each sample. The sequence of techniques was as follows: (i) AC impedance; (ii) multiple CV, scans were performed for 10 cycles at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with a potential window in the range from −0.1 to 1.6 V (until stable work is achieved); (iii) AC impedance; (iv) LSV curves were collected at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 with iR correction; (v) chronopotentiometry curves were recorded at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 over 14 h.
The cyclic voltammograms for all as-prepared electrodes are similar. As shown in Fig. 4a, two peaks are observed during cathodic scans on multiple CV curves, in the ranges 1.11–1.17 V and 1.34–1.43 V, which correspond to the Co2+ → Co3+ and Co3+ → Co4+ transitions, respectively. The Co4+ → Co3+ and Co3+ → Co2+ (anodic scans) reductions appear as reverse peaks in the ranges 1.23–1.24 V and 0.88–0.94 V, respectively. After 10 cycles, a gradual approximation of Co3+/2+ and Co4+/3+ values is observed; the cathodic and anodic peaks are shifted to the left and right sides, respectively, indicating the gradual stabilization of the electrochemical process. The LSV results for OER tests are given in the Table 1 and Fig. 4b. Bare carbon fiber or carbon fiber with carbon black exhibits poor OER and HER activity (Fig. S7, ESI†). Thus, enhanced OER activity results mainly from the presence of the initial phosphates. The observed overpotentials for all samples at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 showed small discrepancies in the range of 309 to 326 mV, and they are similar to that of the reference sample (319 mV for RuO2). However, when the current density reaches 100 mA cm−2, the divergence in the performance increases. The G and SS samples exhibit better overpotential performance (448 and 456 mV, respectively) than the GC (500 mV) sample. These overpotentials are even lower than the overpotential for the RuO2 electrode (533 mV), measured at the same current density. The OER activity correlates well with the calculated data from the Tafel plots. As shown in Fig. 4c, the Tafel slopes increase in the sequence GC, G, RuO2, SS. In fact, the Tafel slope for SS (85.3 mV dec−1) was slightly lower than that for RuO2 (86.2 mV dec−1). These results indicate that the catalytic performance of Na4Co3P4O15 for the OER is good, and the activity of material depends on the synthesis method.

This trend is changed after the long-term stability test. As illustrated in Fig. 4d, the behavior of these catalysts is also similar. No significant curve shift in the potential scale was observed. After 0.5 h of rapid growth, the overpotential increased slowly for all samples. The largest increase in the potential value after 14 h (4.4%) was recorded for GC, whereas the increases were 3.7 and 3.2% for the G and SS catalysts, respectively. In the last 2 h of the measurements, the overpotential was stable and practically unchanged. This result indicates that the initial material under electrochemical conditions in alkaline solution is gradually converted and achieves equilibrium at the end of the test. The AC impedance spectroscopy results confirm this assumption (Fig. 4e). The conductivity of the electrodes is changed, and more details of the equivalent circuits and measurement results are given in Fig. S8, ESI.† Multiple CVs measured after the stability test also demonstrate the change in the electrode behavior (inset, Fig. 4a). All the peaks for the Co2+ ↔ Co3+ ↔ Co4+ transitions are shifted to the cathodic region at about 0.1 V, which correlates with the deterioration of electrocatalytic properties.60 Further LSV measurements and Tafel plot calculations (Fig. 4f and g) confirmed that the electrocatalytic activity of materials decreases. Table 1 compares the increased overpotentials of 15–34 mV dec−1 with previous values after chronopotentiometry. The Tafel slopes for all samples are similar (Fig. 4g), indicating the formation of one type of electrocatalyst. The repeated long-term stability tests did not reveal any significant changes in overpotential values (Fig. S9, ESI†), showing that electrodes with stable characteristics were formed.
To elucidate the state of the catalyst after electrochemical treatment, we examined the electrodes by several methods. The SEM images are shown in Fig. 5a and indicate the agglomeration of nanoflakes (∼2 μm) in combination with clusters of fine particles (<1 μm). EDS analysis and elemental mapping (Fig. 5) show the regular distribution of cobalt and oxygen with a mosaic distribution of carbon atoms and only traces of phosphorus and sodium on the surface of the electrode. XRD and FTIR spectra confirm complete decomposition of Na4Co3P4O15 (Fig. 5b and c). All the diffraction peaks were indexed as CoO(OH) (PDF #00-007-0169, rhombohedral system, Rm). XPS analysis indicates the presence of only Co, O, Na and C on the surface (Fig. 6 and Table S1, ESI†). Two major peaks observed in the Co 2p binding energy spectrum after deconvolution (Fig. 6b) are fitted by four polynomials at 779.9, 780.7, 794.9 and 796.5 eV and reflect the coexistence of Co3+ and Co2+.61 No evidence of phosphorus was detected (Fig. 6c). The presence of O, Na and C and the state of their chemical bonds remain practically unchanged. In particular, the signal in the Na spectra is due to the sorption of sodium ions on the surface from the electrolyte. In summary, the electrochemical transformation of complex phosphate Na4Co3P4O15 in the OER is written as 4Na4Co3P4O15 + 32NaOH + 3O2 → 12CoO(OH) + 16Na3PO4 + 10H2O(3)

Oxides and hydroxides of transition metals, in particular Co, are highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting in alkaline solution. The OER mechanism consists of four consecutive steps62–64 M + H2O → M-OH + e− + H+(4) M-OH → M-O + e− + H+(5) M-O + H2O → M-OOH + e− + H+(6) M-OOH → M + O2 + e− + H+(7)
These steps accompany changes in the oxidation state of the polyvalent metal, which acts as an active catalytic center. Co undergoes the cyclic transformation M2+ ↔ M3+ ↔ M4+. In the first step, the H2O molecule adsorbs onto the active site and dissociates (eqn (4)). Then, M-OH loses a second proton and interacts with the additional water molecule (eqn (5)), leading to the formation of the M-OOH species (eqn (6)). In the last step, M-OOH dissociates and evolves an oxygen molecule and a proton (eqn (7)).
Similar to previous measurements, the study of the HER activities of G, GC, SS and Pt (20%)/C (as a reference) began by measuring the CV dependency, and then recording the LSV curve (Fig. 7a). As shown in Table 2, the overpotential values are in the ranges −282 to −355 mV, −320 to −377 mV and −466 to −476 mV at current densities of 10, 20 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. Calculation of Tafel plots (Fig. 7b) demonstrates a large differences in values, in the order SS < G < GC (Table 2). This result indicates the system is in a non-equilibrium state. Further chronopotentiometry measurements chronopotentiometry curves are shown in Fig. 7c. After the first 2 h for the G and SS electrodes and 1 h for the GC electrode, the overpotential rapidly decreases. Then, the decrease in potential slows down and the time-potential curves approach a plateau. However, the GC electrode reaches its minimum at −388 mV after 7 h of treatment, and the overpotential tends to increase slightly (−398 mV). The longest stable segment is obtained for the SS electrode. After 6.5 h, the potential growth stops at −352 mV and becomes constant toward the end of the measurement (14 h). In contrast, the G electrode achieves relatively stable values only after 8 h, but even then, there is a slow increase in overpotential at about 10 mV. These results mean that during chronopotentiometry, the conversion of complex phosphates takes place. Moreover, the rate of conversion depends on the initial form of the material (SS, GC, G). This transformation reflects the change in the conductive properties of the electrodes (Fig. 7d and S10, ESI†). The results of the LSV tests and Tafel plot calculations are given in Fig. 7e and f. The catalytic activity for HER is decreased (Table 2). Compared with the previous results, the Tafel plot slopes for HER increase at 26–33 mV dec−1, although the order of catalytic activity remains the same as before, SS > G > GC (Table 2). The finial chronopotentiometry (Fig. S11, ESI†) does not reveal major changes in the catalytic activity for HER, which confirms that an equilibrium state was achieved in the system.

The conclusions drawn from the electrochemical experiments are consistent with the results of the electrode studies after the long-term HER test. The SEM images in Fig. 8 show that the morphology of the electrodes changed, and the following types of particles are visible on the electrodes: hexagonal plate-like discs, with an average width of ∼5 μm (main part); elongated nanoflakes (average size ∼2 μm); and merged clusters of fine particles (size <1 μm). EDS element mapping (Fig. 8) shows that the fine particles consist of carbon, whereas the nanoflakes and hexagonal discs contain Co and O, and a decreased amount of Na. No P was detected. The regular hexagonal plate-like shape of the particles has the same morphology as previously reported for particles of cobalt hydroxide.30 FTIR spectra analysis (Fig. 8) shows that vibrations are absent in the region from 900 to 1300 cm−1, which corresponds to characteristic vibration of phosphate groups and confirms their absence. The new intense vibration at 3622–3626 cm−1 indicates the appearance of OH groups in the composition. Fig. 8 shows the XRD pattern of the SS electrode after the long-term stability test. No trace of the initial phosphate is detected. The XRD patterns show good convergence with the diffraction profile of β-Co(OH)2 (PDF #00-003-0913). A more detailed analysis revealed additional peaks at 20.3, 37.0, 39.2 and 50.6°, which are assigned to the (003), (101), (012) and (015) planes of CoO(OH) (PDF #00-007-0169), indicating the partial oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+. The results agree well with the XPS measurements (Fig. 9 and Table S1†). Compared with the as-prepared phosphate, the XPS curve for Co 2p is shifted to the low-energy range, indicating the partial increase in the oxidation state of Co. For clarity, the initial spectrum was decomposed to polynomial peaks (Fig. 9). Two peaks with calculated maxima at 780.5 and 795.6 eV were observed and, as for the initial compound, were attributed to multiple chemical states of Co2+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively. The two polynomial peaks at 779.9 and 794.9 eV belong to Co3+ according to the literature.65,66 Thus, the peaks at 790.2 and 804.3 eV are their satellites. In Fig. 9, no peaks near 133 eV were detected. This observation confirms the results of the previous analysis, in which P was absent and complete conversion of the initial material was observed. The O 1s spectrum contains three oxygen bonding peaks (Fig. 9). The first peak at 529.7 eV is attributed to the lattice oxygen species, the second strongest peak centered at 531.0 eV is usually related to the lattice hydroxyl oxygen species, and the peak at 532.3 eV is associated with physically and chemically adsorbed water molecules near the surface.24,66,67

In our opinion, the formation of β-Co(OH)2 results from the interaction of the as-prepared phosphate with 1 M NaOH, according to eqn (2). The presence of two oxidation states of Co in the sample after the HER suggests a partial interaction between Co2+ and O2 in the air on the contact surface of the electrode during preparation and measurements because the experiments were not performed under an inert atmosphere. This interaction corresponds to 4Co(OH)2 + [O2]in air → 4CoO(OH) + 2H2O(8)
The evolution of hydrogen bubbles in the electrode surface during the HER process promotes mixing with the electrolyte solution, and thus accelerates the decomposition of the initial compound. The decomposition kinetics also depend on the form of the as-prepared compound (SS, GC or G), which affects the nucleation rate, growth and final size of β-Co(OH)2 nanoparticles. Thus, the growth kinetics of nanoparticles result in diverse final catalytic features for the HER and OER.
The HER process (Tafel–Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanisms)68,69 corresponds to three transformations, associated with various segments of the Tafel plot.
The Volmer reaction occurs on a Tafel plot at 120 mV dec−1: H+ + e− + M → M–H(9)
The Heyrovsky reaction occurs on a Tafel plot at 40 mV dec−1: M–H + H+ + e− → H2 + M(10)
The recombination step (Tafel reaction) occurs at 30 mV dec−1 2M–H → 2M + H2(11)
Therefore, in our case according to the Tafel plots (Table 2), the limiting factor is the Volmer reaction.
A large number of different CoOx/C composites are good electrocatalysts for OER and HER. Typically, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotential values are in the ranges 260–380 and 150–430 mV for the OER21,29,61,70–73 and HER,66,73,74–77 respectively. In our case, the final values were in the ranges 340–360 (OER) and 280–360 mV (HER). After the first cycle of electrochemical tests (partial transformation of the complex phosphate to CoOx) the overpotential values were lower for both reactions (Tables 1 and 2). This indicates that the phosphate acts as a supporting electrocatalyst. Zhan et al.77 showed that in an alkaline medium, cobalt phosphates rapidly transform into oxide/hydroxides. In contrast, nickel phosphates (including Ni/3d metal combinations) are much more stable.78,79 This work facilitated the discovery of several hybrid systems with high electrocatalytic efficiency.39,78,79 According to Li and Zhao,78 phosphate-supported electrocatalysts improve water adsorption, which improves the electrocatalytic characteristics substantially. Thus, multimetal complex phosphates are attractive candidates for creating next-generation bifunctional electrodes for water splitting.
Finally, we investigated the bifunctional activity of the electrodes for overall water splitting in NaOH media in a two-electrode electrolyzer. Fig. 10a shows the durability test results for a SS∥SS cell at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 50 h. In the first 1 h, the cell potential gradually decreased from 1.87 to 1.85 V and stopped at 1.83 V after 10 h, indicating the stabilization of the catalysts. This result is consistent with the LSV measurements conducted before and after the long-term stability test (Fig. 10b). The polarization curve recorded after chronopotentiometry demonstrates a deviation from the previous data. The potentials at current densities of 10, 100 and 200 mA cm−2 shift from 1.80, 2.52 and 3.14 V to 1.80, 2.61 and 3.35 V, respectively. The change in cell potential during the first 2 h is caused by the degradation of the complex phosphate to Co2+/3+ hydroxides on both electrodes. The new phases of β-Co(OH)2 and CoO(OH) catalyze H2 and O2 evolution reactions on the cathode and anode surfaces, respectively. In fact, switching the electrode polarity in the SS∥SS cell provokes a switching of values of the potential-time dependencies (inset, Fig. 10a). For the first 35 min, the cell potential rapidly increases from −1.31 to 1.83 V. The potential is the same as in the previous case and indicates the reduction of Co3+ in CoO(OH) and the oxidation of Co2+ in Co(OH)2. This result demonstrates that the electrodes perform an overall inversion for the OER and HER processes preserving an overpotential of 0.5 V in the cell (compared with the theoretical potential of 1.23 V for water splitting) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Thus, the electrolysis cell is in an equilibrium state that is stable over time. This bifunctional inversion electrocatalyst is promising as a basis for manufacturing long-life water splitting cells.

Conclusions
We investigated a strategy of obtaining electrochemically active Co(OH)2 and CoO(OH) nanoparticles in situ in a carbon matrix via chemical and electrochemical transformation of glass, glass-ceramic and polycrystalline forms of Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 in 1 M NaOH solution during water splitting. After stabilization, the electrodes showed good electrocatalytic activity and similar overpotentials for OER and HER (346–365 and 326–369 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively). The CoO(OH)/C∥Co(OH)2/C system for water splitting showed excellent long-term stability over more than 50 h at 10 mA cm−2 with a total overpotential of 0.6 V. These electrodes switched between catalyzing the OER and HER processes while preserving a cell voltage of 1.8 V, which indicates that the cell achieved an equilibrium state in alkaline medium. Therefore, the formation of nanoparticles in a carbon matrix has two main advantages: (i) the composite has good conductive properties; and (ii) the nanosystem topology is formed during electrolysis, which ensures that it is stable over time. Most importantly, the method for obtaining these electrodes is simple, inexpensive, and can be scaled up easily to large devices. These conclusions indicate that this strategy should be investigated further. For example, the selection of precursors for obtaining of nanosystems in situ, including the combination of 3d metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu), should be explored. Our method can significantly improve the catalytic activity of materials during the process of creating new electrodes with an extended lifetime.
