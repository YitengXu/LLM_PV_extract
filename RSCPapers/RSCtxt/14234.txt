    , Accepted 23rd January 2018First published on 23rd January 2018AbstractThe electrolyte is the second key component governing at once the power conversion performances and the stability of dye-sensitized solar cells. Towards the integration of more sustainable materials, we have focused on the replacement of the major constituent of the electrolyte, namely the 1,3-di-alkyl imidazolium iodide. We synthesized two new iodide molecules derived from the natural amino acid L-proline: (S)-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-1,1-dimethylpyrrolidinium iodide (PMeI) and (S)-2-(ethoxycarbonyl)-1,1-ethylpyrrolidinium iodide (PEtI). In combination with the C106 polypyridyl ruthenium(+II) sensitizer, power conversion efficiencies of 7.1% for PMeI and 6.5% for PEtI were obtained under standard Air Mass 1.5G conditions in conjunction with the low-volatile 3-methoxypropionitrile-based solvent. The relationships between these iodide molecules with the power conversion efficiencies and the interfacial charge transfer processes are herein discussed, and the new iodide molecules are systematically compared to the best standard 1,3-di-methylimidazolium iodide.
Introduction
The constant rise in energy demand together with the finite nature of fossil fuels prompts the development of longer-term and sustainable alternative energy sources. Most current technologies and materials developed are derived from petroleum resources. Nowadays, renewable energies stand for about 13% of the energetic mix, with sun energy (ca. 1018 kW h per year) being at the forefront owing to its potential to fully meet current and future needs.1 Among all the different photovoltaic (PV) technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) show concrete potential for lower cost solar conversion. They offer new opportunities for display integration, such as for building façade or street furniture to prompt the development of delocalized electricity production grids or for indoor application, for which conversion efficiencies close to 30% have recently been reported.2
Although the field is dominated by the emergent halide perovskite solar cell technology for which the device architecture closely resembles solid-state DSCs, the domain of DSCs maintains constant progress. Certified power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 14% have been attained thanks to the development of a new generation of dyes, more oxidant one electron redox couples,3 improvements in stability (in part triggered by an improved comprehension of degradation mechanisms induced by light and/or thermal stress (IEC 61646)),4 development of p-type DSCs for p–n tandem integration,5 improved textural or optoelectronic characteristics of photo-anodes based on TiO2,6 extension to blue colored DSCs,7 and the development of more sustainable aqueous electrolytes.8 This technology has a set of advantages over other technologies. One exciting factor is that the device architecture and its components can be made more compatible with the development and integration of more sustainable materials. For instance, different natural dyes have been proposed,9 aqueous electrolyte has been introduced to replace nitrile-based solvents10 and natural sugar-based iodide chemicals relying on D-glucose or D-mannose have been used as part of the redox mediator in the electrolyte formulation.11 Currently, 1,3-dialkyl imidazolium iodide compounds are the dominant iodide source in the electrolyte, showing the greatest power conversion efficiencies and stability.12 Other types of cations such as pyrrolidinium, pyridinium, quaternary alkyl ammonium, phosphonium etc. have also been proposed with limited success.13 The development of alternative and greener molecules for the electrolyte is worth pursuing. 1,3-Dialkyl imidazolium iodide compounds, as the major component of the electrolyte, are included at a high concentration, 1 mol L−1, which represents ca. 225 g L−1 of electrolyte, in order to ensure good mass transport, a high ionic conductivity to avoid fill factor penalties, and fast dye regeneration, which is important to avoid dye degradation over time. The role that the electrolyte plays in the device performance is thus pivotal. It not only controls the mass transport of the redox mediator and the dye regeneration, but also contributes to maintaining the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode and non-geminate recombination dynamics at low levels.
In this work, we report a new and more sustainable family of iodide-based molecules which are derived from the natural L-proline amino acid. These new molecules, when used in a device, give performances close to the benchmark 1,3-di-methylimidazolium iodide in conjunction with the low-volatile 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) solvent. The synthesis, performances in complete devices with ruthenium(+II) polypyridyl C106 dye, and the influence of the structure of the cation on the mass transport properties, non-geminate charge recombination and trap state distribution are herein discussed.
Results and discussion
A series of iodide-based ionic liquids derived from L-proline were synthesized in one step.14 We reacted the amino acid L-proline with either methyliodide or ethyliodide under basic conditions at 50 °C (Scheme 1). The final compounds, coded PMeI or PEtI, were obtained in 83% and 25% yields, respectively. The electrolytes were prepared on the basis of the low-volatile MPN solvent. Its composition corresponded to an optimized formulation for C106 dye in agreement with the literature,15 namely 1 mol L−1 of iodide source (DMII, PMeI or PEtI), 0.15 mol L−1 of iodine I2, 0.5 mol L−1 of 1H-N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB) and 0.1 mol L−1 of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS). The performances of these new iodide-based proline molecules were systematically compared to the current best standard, namely 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII). The physical characteristics of the new electrolytes are gathered in Table 1. DMII has a melting point of 93.6 °C, thus belonging to the class of ionic liquids.16 PMeI is a viscous yellowish liquid at room-temperature. By contrast, the introduction of the longer perethylated chain to the pyrrolidine base (PEtI) leads to a liquid-to-solid transition which translates into an important rise in the melting temperature to 125.9 °C as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Consequently, PEtI is categorized as an ionic salt owing to the weak but in this case highly structured hydrogen–hydrogen bonding between pyrrolidine core units in the crystal.

In DSC devices under both load and illumination, tri-iodide mass transport is the slowest process among all other charge transfer processes which are taking place on femto-to-millisecond time scales. The charge transfer resistance on the Pt counter-electrode and I3− mass transport properties were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/Pt symmetric cells. For the sake of a systematic comparison with the standard DMII, we determined the I3− diffusion coefficient for DMII in MPN of 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 in good agreement with the literature values.13c,15a,17 For the L-proline derivatives, the diffusion coefficients decreased only slightly, i.e. 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 for PMeI and 1.4 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 for PEtI (Table 1). These slight changes are attributed to the viscosity increases of the electrolytes based on L-proline (viscosity varies from 2.10 cP for DMII to ca. 2.50 cP for the new electrolytes).18
Interestingly, the L-proline electrolytes present an advantage compared to the first series of more sustainable electrolytes that we developed based on sugar for which the tri-iodide diffusion coefficients lay well below 10−5 cm2 s−1 as a result of the more viscous media reaching up to 3.80 cP.11 EIS showed that the charge transfer resistance on platinum nanoparticles is higher in the case of the L-proline derivatives, i.e. 3.5 and 8.2 Ω cm2 for PMeI and PEtI, respectively, compared to ca. 1.7 Ω cm2 for DMII. We hypothesize that the increases in charge transfer resistance are the result of the stronger adsorption of the cation onto the Pt surface through the ester function of the L-proline, thus impeding to some extent the charge transfer to the I3−/I− redox mediator.19
The intrinsic chemical stability of the electrolytes was evaluated on a FTO/Pt symmetric cell according to the IEC61646 protocol for accelerating tests, under two sets of conditions: 1000 hours at room temperature/ambient light, and 1000 hours at 60 °C under 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 1). Like the standard DMII, both electrolytes containing the amino acid derivatives were very stable over 1000 hours at room temperature/ambient light conditions, regardless of the tri-iodide diffusion coefficient, the charge transfer resistance and the electrolyte ohmic drop. However, under accelerating light and thermal stress, i.e. at 60 °C under 100 mW cm−2, the electrolyte based on PEtI systematically failed to pass the 1000 hours threshold. It systematically and reproducibly showed leakage between 650 and 800 hours of ageing. This suggests the formation of more volatile byproducts at the surface of the platinum nanoparticles upon light and thermal stress. A chemical degradation taking place on platinum was also supported by the occurrence of a noticeable charge transfer resistance increase measured by EIS. In a recent work, we highlighted that robust electrolytes based on the MPN solvent lead to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) resulting from the solvent decomposition upon sensitized-TiO2 and Pt electrodes under thermal stress.4 This process is taking place concomitantly with the formation of two volatile byproducts stemming from the solvent breakdown, namely methanol and acrylonitrile. Consequently, we argue that PEtI may play a catalytic role in the solvent decomposition upon platinum. In contrast with such an interfacial process, the electrolyte ohmic drop and tri-iodide diffusion coefficient remained comparatively stable upon ageing. This suggests that the bulk electrolyte properties of PEtI were maintained. The chemical stability was verified for over 1000 hours for the other electrolytes (Fig. 1). The charge transfer resistances and tri-iodide diffusion coefficients decreased with time in agreement with previous reports in the literature relating to DMII.4b,20

The performances of the new electrolytes in complete devices were evaluated using the high molar extinction coefficient ruthenium(+II) polypyridyl C106 dye.21 The device based on the benchmark DMII electrolyte exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.0% under standard Air Mass (A.M.) 1.5G illumination conditions (Jsc = 16.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 680 mV with ff = 69.3%) (Fig. 2). This value falls within the best values reported so far for this dye in combination with a low-volatile MPN-based electrolyte composition.15 Although inherently behind in terms of solar-to-electricity conversion performances, PMeI and PEtI-based electrolytes maintained good power conversion efficiencies of 7.1% (Jsc = 17.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 608 mV with ff = 68.4%) and 6.5% (Jsc = 15.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 613 mV with ff = 67.3%), respectively. The disadvantage of L-proline derivatives stems mainly from the photovoltage values which are about 70 mV lower, and to a lesser extent from the fill factors which reflect the greater charge transfer resistances measured for the L-proline derivatives, especially for PEtI. The L-proline derivatives also produce more dark current which explains to some extent their lower photovoltages.

To gain more insight into the relationship between the structure of the iodide source and the milli-second charge transfer processes in the device (i.e. non-geminate charge recombination and charge transport in TiO2), EIS experiments were carried out on complete devices. For this, the transmission line model was used as an electrical equivalent circuit to determine electron lifetime and electron transport time towards collection (Fig. 3).22 The cation structure had a little but visible influence on these characteristics. The distribution of the traps below the conduction band of TiO2 displayed an exponential feature in agreement with the common observations made in the literature. The energy and the distribution of these surface traps were comparatively similar between DMII and PMeI.

A slight downshift of ca. 40 mV was noticed for the ethyl counterpart. This result signifies that DMII and PMeI have a very similar electrostatic interaction with the TiO2 interface.23 Interestingly, the dynamic of non-geminate recombination with PMeI molecules was very similar to that with DMII at fixed energy (Fig. 3b). It was also equivalent to that with PEtI when the applied voltage was greater than the open circuit photovoltage (i.e.>700 mV). However, at lower bias voltage, PEtI showed a charge recombination dynamic of up to ca. two times faster, which may explain why PEtI showed power conversion performances that were inferior to those of its methyl-counterpart, in addition to the greater charge transfer resistance on platinum and trap downshift. The transport time was only very marginally longer with PMeI.
These results indicate not surprisingly that the iodide counter-ion plays no role or only a marginal role in the dynamic of electron transport by a trapping/detrapping mechanism. In other words, in contrast to alkali cations which are sometimes incorporated into the electrolyte composition,24 there is no ambipolar diffusion mechanism between the electron localized at the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles and the iodide counter-ion.
Conclusions
This work stands as a second example of the feasibility of successfully replacing the major component of the electrolyte, namely the imidazolium cation of the iodide source, with a greener and more sustainable molecule. Herein, two new derivatives of the L-proline amino acid, PMeI and PEtI, were synthesized and incorporated in a benchmark electrolyte formulation based on the low-volatile MPN solvent. Power conversion performances of up to 7.1% for PMeI were obtained using C106 dye under standard A.M. 1.5G conditions. The shorter length of the alkyl chain of the pyrrolidinium in PMeI resulted in a higher overall PCE than was obtained with PEtI. This series of molecules shows improvements in terms of performances and viscosities with respect to the first generation of sustainable alternatives based on sugar. Although we agree that currently these molecules show slightly lower performances in complete devices, mainly due to their greater charge transfer resistances and lower photovoltage production, this work paves the way for the integration of alternative and greener electrolytes which can closely compete with the standards used in dye-sensitized solar cells.
Experimental
All chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade or better, and were purchased from Aldrich, Acros or Fisher Scientific. The 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) was used as received from Aldrich.

1H NMR (300.13 MHz) and 13C NMR (75.47 MHz) spectra were recorded in CDCl3 (internal standard Me4Si). TLC was performed on Silica F254 plates and detection was by UV light at 254 nm or by charring with the phosphomolybdic-H2SO4 reagent. FTIR spectra were obtained on an AVATAR™ 320 from neat samples using ATR and are reported in cm−1. Mass spectral data were acquired on a WATERS Micromass ZQ spectrometer or a WATERS Micromass Q-TOFF spectrometer. Column chromatography was effected on Silica Gel 60 (230 mesh). Cyclohexane and ethyl acetate were distilled before use.
Thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry analyses were realized on a Netzsch Thermal analyzer STA 449C Jupiter and Netzsch scanning calorimeter (DSC 204 F1), respectively. The thermal analyzer was coupled to a mass spectrometer QMS 403 Aëolos with a stainless steel capillary and an SEV detector Channeltron, for analysis of gas release. The counting time for the mass spectrometer was 20 ms per m/z values (scanning width: m/z = 10–150 amu) with a dwelling time of 1 s. The samples (10–15 mg) were heated in an alumina crucible until 1000 °C under air for TGA; they were cooled down to −100 °C and then heated up to 200 °C under argon for calorimetric analysis, applying in both cases a heating ramp of 10 °C min−1.
The DSC assembly was performed as follows. Two types of anatase TiO2 layers were deposited by manual screen-printing (Tiflex) upon Nippon Sheet Glass (NSG10) FTO glass. The first layer, of ca. 9 μm thickness and 63% porosity, consisted of nano-sized particles of 20 nm acidic anatase TiO2. This layer was sheltered by a second layer of ca. 5.5 μm thickness composed of 400 nm size anatase particles to back-reflect unabsorbed photons in agreement with Mie scattering theory. Prior to screen printing, the NSG10 glass was chemically treated by a 0.04 M TiCl4(aq.) solution for 30 minutes at 70 °C to hamper excessive charge recombination from the FTO to the electrolyte. This procedure was reproduced for the post-annealed photo-anode to optimize the charge collection efficiency while reducing the electrode porosity to ca. 57%. The electrodes were submitted to a post-annealing treatment to remove terpineol and the binder/porogen according to the literature.25 Prior to sensitization, the photo-anode was heated at 520 °C for 30 minutes in air to remove atmospheric residues naturally adsorbed upon the TiO2 surface. The photo-anode was then sensitized at room-temperature for 15 hours in dark conditions. The light absorber used herein was the heteroleptic ruthenium(+II) C106 dye first proposed by Wang et al.15b The synthesis and purification by sephadex column was carried out according to the literature. The dye solution used for sensitization was composed of 300 μM of dye in a 1/1 v/v tertbutanol/acetonitrile solvent mixture including an equimolar ratio of chenodeoxycholic acid as a de-aggregating agent.
TEC7 Pilkington FTO glass was used as the counter-electrode. A hole of ca. 200 μm in diameter was drilled by sandblasting to enable electrolyte injection by vacuum back-filling. The glass was then cleaned once for 15 minutes in 0.1 M HCl solution and twice for 15 minutes in ethanol using an ultrasonic bath. The counter-electrodes were kept in ethanol until use. A drop of 5 mM H2PtCl6 (EtOH) solution was cast and heat-treated at 450 °C for 15 minutes in air to yield a layer of PtOx–Pt nanoparticles. The two electrodes were assembled by a 25 μm thick transparent Surlyn® gasket polymer DuPont.
The tri-iodide diffusion coefficient and interfacial charge transfer resistance on the FTO-Pt electrode were determined using EIS on a FTO-Pt/electrolyte/Pt-FTO symmetric cell configuration. EIS measurements were performed from 200 kHz down to 10 mHz. The spectra were obtained by superimposing a sinusoidal perturbation of 10 mV in the dark at 25 °C. The measurements were conducted with a Biologic VMP3 potentiostat/galvanostat/impedance meter. The EIS data were analyzed using ZView 3.2b software with a Randles electrical equivalent circuit.26 The diffusion coefficients were determined using the equation DI3− = L2/Ws, where L corresponds to the separation distance between the two FTO-Pt electrodes and Ws to the Warburg coefficient determined by the fitting analysis of the low-frequency Nernst diffusion part of the Nyquist plot. All kinetic parameters acquired from EIS were determined after simulation with the adequate equivalent electrical circuits, e.g. transmission line model for DSC devices.27 Ionic diffusion coefficients were also determined by cyclic voltammetry using a Pt micro-electrode (limiting current approach).
Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSCs were recorded by means of a Keithley computer controlled digital sourcemeter combined with a 3A class Newport SOL3A sun simulator with an A.M. 1.5G filter (100 mW cm−2). The incident light power was measured by a silicon diode reference cell calibrated at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). J–V characteristics were measured under illumination by changing the bias voltage from short-circuit to open-circuit conditions. The active surface was masked by black tape with an aperture 1 mm larger than the TiO2 photo-anode area (0.152 cm2). The PCE values correspond to the best reproducible values obtained. The reproducibility in PCE values were in the range of ca. 0.15%.
