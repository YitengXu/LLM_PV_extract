    , Accepted 19th December 2017First published on 20th December 2017AbstractWe suggest a new degradation mechanism of commonly used gold electrodes in hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) originating from chemical interaction between gold and highly reactive iodine-containing byproducts formed in the course of perovskite decomposition. Intensive UV-irradiation of perovskite would typically lead to the release of volatile I2 and CH3NH3I (MAI) resulting in the formation of recently reported highly reactive polyiodide melts (RPMs) with the general formula MAI–nI2. These RPMs react aggressively with metallic gold at room temperature causing the formation of [AuI2]− and [AuI4]− complexes and, consequently, precipitation on the gold interface of a new (MA)2Au2I6 phase with a tetragonal symmetry. The high rate and depth of this reaction renders gold an easy target for attack under these particular conditions despite its notorious chemical inertness, thus making gold unsuitable for widespread use in iodine-based perovskite solar cells; other cheaper and more stable materials are needed as a better choice for further development in this area.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently emerged as one of the most promising types of low-cost photovoltaics due to their high efficiency (>22%) and the ease of fabrication.1–3 At the same time PSCs still suffer from a lack of stability of either the whole device or its individual components.4–7 Intense studies are being performed in the field of solar cell encapsulation,8–10 but this approach has not been able to prevent internal malfunctioning of the device.11 Internal degradation may include inter-diffusion of ions from different materials,12–14 interfacial degradation,15,16 and current–voltage hysteresis involving ion motion.17–19 Another important aspect of PSC stability is the dependence of degradation mechanisms on the device architecture.20,21 One of the most widely used PSC configurations with a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) > 22% is FTO/TiO2/perovskite/HTM/metal.1 In this typical architecture, the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3), the organic hole-conducting material (HTM: spiro-MeOTAD or PTAA), and the metal contact (Au, Ag, or Al) can undergo degradation in the course of solar cell operation.22,23 The gold contact is commonly considered to be the most stable electrode material while Al and Ag undergo rapid degradation and corrosion followed by the formation of oxides (AlOx)24 and iodides (AgI).25,26 On the other hand, gold is also not a completely stable electrode material and may also cause a drop in PSC performance. Thus, several recently published articles were dedicated to the stability of the gold electrode. Domanski et al. showed the migration of gold through spiro-MeOTAD and into the perovskite layer when a PSC was exposed to AM 1.5G illumination and 70 °C temperature.27 This agrees with the notion that the migration of gold is usually considered to be thermally activated. In another article, Cacovich et al. reported that long term light exposure of perovskite solar cells causes gold and iodine migration from the metal contact and from the perovskite layer, respectively.28 However, one important issue concerning the degradation of gold electrodes in PSCs through ion migration, published by Besleaga et al., is the strong dependence of stability on the absence/presence of pinholes in perovskite thin films.26 According to ref. 26, only in PSCs with pinholes a strong degradation of both gold and perovskite was observed while pinhole-free devices showed no significant degradation even with 70 °C aging.
It's worth pointing out that, besides diffusion, no other possible degradation mechanisms of gold electrodes are discussed in the literature. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, there are no articles focusing on the chemical degradation features of gold electrodes as might be caused by gold interaction with iodine-containing compounds. According to recent studies,29,30 several possible products of perovskite decomposition (e.g. MAI and I2) dependent on applied conditions may interact with each other forming recently reported highly reactive polyiodide melts with the general formula MAI–nI2.31 In the present study, we show that chemical interaction of gold contacts with the above-mentioned compounds could play an important role in explaining the nature of the intrinsic instability of PSCs.
Results and discussion
It is well-known that hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites can degrade if affected by factors such as humidity, elevated temperature, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.22 Usually, perovskites (in our case, CH3NH3PbI3 = MAPI) undergo irreversible degradation with the formation of various solid and volatile products: PbI2, CH3NH3I, HI, CH3NH2, I2, etc.4 Thus we performed several series of model experiments with the degradation of MAPI in the presence of gold in order to identify the possibility of a chemical interaction between gold and volatile products of MAPI decomposition, particularly, to simulate in an accelerated manner the two main factors of internal perovskite degradation under operating conditions: elevated temperature (150 °C) and intensive UV-light (∼254 nm) irradiation.

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the mixture of MAPI and metallic gold powder (Au) before (black line) and after continuous exposure under elevated temperature (red line) and UV-irradiation (blue line) conditions. Both patterns include phases of MAPI and PbI2; however, the sample degraded via UV-irradiation contains a number of additional peaks corresponding to one or more unknown phases indicated by asterisks. This discrepancy reveals that the products of perovskite decomposition strongly vary under the two mentioned constraints. It should be noted that almost all possible by-products and their combinations are expected to form and concentrate in a sealed/encapsulated PSC under long-term operation. In the case of usual TGA experiments (see ESI, Fig. S6†) or UV-irradiation alone provided in open air, only some of the by-products are generated and they have no tendency to be concentrated.
 Fig. 1  X-ray diffraction patterns of mixed powders of MAPI and gold before (black line) and after degradation under high temperature (red line) and UV-light irradiation (blue line) conditions. Brown and orange vertical bars correspond to MAPI and PbI2 reflections; the “Au” label refers to metallic gold reflections shown for the reference; asterisks indicate peaks of the unknown phase. 
It is natural to expect that the unknown phase may correspond to some complex gold compounds (e.g. AuI32 like in the case of silver25); however, the peaks of the unknown phase do not match with gold(I) iodide reflections (JCPDS card no. 15-521). It's worth mentioning that chemical interaction of Au and I2 takes place only at temperatures higher than 120 °C and requires a long period of time.33 A rapid reaction with metallic gold is induced only by applying molten iodine at around 170 °C, resulting in AuI formation (see ESI, Fig. S1†). In the same manner, I2 reacts with metallic lead, while a vigorous reaction with metallic lead at room temperature occurs in the case of its reaction with the mixture of I2 and MAI representing recently discovered reactive polyiodide melts.31 This means that each of the expected MAPI degradation by-products, e.g. I2, HI, MA, and MAI, alone does not transform gold. However, occasional formation of even a single small source of reactive polyiodide melts leads to the immediate uptake of iodine vapour above and around them. Therefore, these melts start to concentrate locally incoming iodine and other degradation products being a viscous liquid with a reduced partial pressure of iodine.28 At the same time, the reactive polyiodide melts contain ionic species, like MA+, and that would favour the formation of complex phases of ionic origin, instead of less stable binary phases such as AuIn. Thus, the formation of RPMs during UV-irradiation of the MAPI/Au mixture and the subsequent reaction of RPMs with metallic gold is likely to be the main reason and the key origin of the chemical degradation of gold leading to the formation of the unknown phase in Fig. 1. Our hypothesis is partially supported by the literature where Pistor et al. report on MAPI degradation under a 532 nm laser beam in a Raman spectrometer with the formation of polyiodide species.34
In order to clarify our hypothesis on the formation of RPMs during perovskite decomposition followed by their chemical interaction with gold, we performed a number of experiments with metallic gold and polyiodide melts MAI–nI2. First, we applied RPMs onto thermally deposited gold films and observed the quick formation of a black film (see Fig. 2(a)). According to the XRD pattern in Fig. 2(c), the obtained new black film consists of two phases – MAI and an unknown phase, named “black” and marked in Fig. 2(c) with black squares. In order to check whether the interlayer of organic HTM spiro-OMeTAD, usually used in PSCs between the metal electrode and perovskite, prevents gold from chemically interacting with RPMs or not, we carried out analogous experiments applying RPMs on the thin film of spiro-OMeTAD with and without the gold underlayer. According to our findings, spiro-OMeTAD intensively interacts with RPMs, changing color to brown and ultimately dissolving in them (see ESI, Fig. S2†). This fact correlates with the literature27,28 and supports our hypothesis that organic HTM spiro-OMeTAD cannot be an effective barrier between perovskite and the metal electrode, allowing processes such as ion diffusion or chemical reaction between components to occur. Indeed, in the case of the spiro-OMeTAD/gold bilayer, a similar black phase with the same number of XRD reflections forms within several minutes on the top of the gold film (see ESI, Fig. S2†). The presence of spiro-OMeTAD does not prevent chemical reaction.
 Fig. 2  (a) Photographs of Au films before and after their interaction with RPMs; (b) SEM micrograph of the black film; and (c) XRD pattern of a gold film converted by RPMs; red bars correspond to reflections of the unknown phase from Fig. 1; black squares refer to the black phase in (a); blue and green bars correspond to reflections of MAI and Cs2Au2I6 (card no. 23-889), respectively. 
The peak positions of the unknown phase (red sticks in Fig. 2(c)) observed after the degradation of the MAPI/Au mixture under UV-light irradiation and the black phase (black squares) obtained via the reaction of gold with RPMs are in good agreement with respect to several intense peaks. Other peaks may overlap with MAI reflections or have too low intensities.
For a more detailed analysis of the “black phase”, we conducted its direct solid-phase synthesis from I2, MAI, and Au in a 1:1:1 ratio at 150 °C for 5 days in a closed glass vial to simulate possible interactions of degradation products in a sealed operating solar cell. According to the XRD pattern in Fig. 3(a), we obtained a new phase with no traces of MAI or Au. The analysis of the XRD pattern revealed the formation of a single-phase sample crystallized in a tetragonal symmetry with the I4/mmm space group. The crystal structure parameters of the new phase refined from the XRD pattern were a = b = 8.457 ± 0.009 Å and c = 12.415 ± 0.013 Å. There is a similar phase, Cs2Au2I6, described in the literature with close lattice parameters: a = b = 8.284 Å and c = 12.092 Å.35,36 The Cs2Au2I6 phase (or Cs2([Au(I)I2][Au(III)I4])) has a tetragonal perovskite structure where all AuI6 octahedra are distorted with a breathing-mode type distortion (elongated Au(III)I6 and compressed Au(I)I6 ones, see ESI, Fig. S3†).36 As a result of such distortion and two different types of gold atoms, all indexes in the Cs2Au2I6 formula are doubled. The similarity in the symmetry, lattice parameters, and XRD patterns between the black phase and Cs2Au2I6 supports our hypothesis that the black phase has the MA2Au2I6 composition. All the crystal lattice parameters of (MA)2Au2I6 are slightly larger than the parameters of the Cs2Au2I6 analogue because of the larger ionic radius of MA+ (2.70 Å) compared to Cs+ (1.81 Å).37 The results of our EPMA elemental analysis of the I:Au ratio vary from 2.9:1 to 2.6:1, which are close to the theoretical I:Au ratio of 3:1 in the (MA)2Au2I6 phase. The small iodine deficiency may be explained by partial decomposition of this phase and iodine sublimation under electron beam pointing with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

The inset shows a fragment of the (MA)2Au2I6 spectrum in the 80–200 cm−1 region; (c) FTIR spectrum of the (MA)2Au2I6 phase with assigned vibrational modes. The inset shows a fragment of the FTIR spectrum in the 2400–3500 cm−1 region. 
To gather more detailed information on the structure of the (MA)2Au2I6 phase, we also studied the samples with Raman spectroscopy, which revealed several characteristic vibrational modes in different regions of 100–160, 1400–1600, and 2750–3200 cm−1 (see Fig. 3(b)). All the peaks with Raman frequencies higher than 1000 cm−1 are attributed to vibrational modes of the CH3NH3+ cation while the 100–160 cm−1 region corresponds to vibrational modes of Au–I polyhedrons. According to site symmetry analysis, this phase has two different I sites: I(1) at (x, x, 0) and I(2) at (1/2, 1/2, z).38 The theoretically calculated Raman modes associated with these two sites are A1g + B1g + B2g + Eg (for I(1)), and A1g + Eg (for I(2)).38,39 Similar to Cs2Au2I6, gold atoms in the (MA)2Au2I6 phase must have different valence states, i.e. Au(I) and Au(III), which form linear AuI2 and square planar AuI4 structural components, respectively. In the Raman spectrum we observe typically three peaks at 113, 130, and 148 cm−1 which we assign to B1g, A1g (AuI4), and A1g (AuI2) vibrational modes. Similar modes with the same Raman shifts were observed in the literature for the Cs2Au2I6 phase.38 An analysis of the (MA)2Au2I6 structure by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed intensive vibrational modes corresponding to fragments of the methylammonium cation. All the vibrations are determined and assigned in Fig. 3(c). Keeping in mind the Raman spectroscopy data, we can conclude that the MA+ cation is incorporated into the crystal lattice and is not an admixture of MAI in the sample. The optical properties of the (MA)2Au2I6 phase were studied by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). This method revealed a sharp absorption edge at approximately 1.2 eV (see Fig. S5, ESI†) which indicates the semiconductor nature of (MA)2Au2I6. The bandgap energy (Eg) of (MA)2Au2I6 was determined by two methods, i.e., using the first derivative of diffuse reflectance and the Kubelka–Munk (K–M) model. Both methods gave very close Eg values of 1.165 eV and 1.186 eV showing that (MA)2Au2I6 is a narrow bandgap semiconductor.
The refined experimental reflections of (MA)2Au2I6 were used to index the unknown phase formed during light-induced degradation of MAPI with gold. As shown in Fig. 4, most of the marked peaks coincide with experimental (MA)2Au2I6 reflections thus supporting our contention about the pathway of UV-induced formation of RPMs and their chemical interaction with metallic gold.
 Fig. 4  XRD pattern of UV-degraded MAPI/Au (black line) compared with experimentally obtained (MA)2Au2I6 phase reflections (pink bars). Asterisks show the unknown phase which represents neither MAPI (brown bars) nor PbI2 (orange bars) reflections. 
A final point concerns the possible (MA)2Au2I6 phase formation mechanism which, in turn, depends on the mechanism of MAPI decomposition during PSC operation. Our experimental results demonstrate that the products (and consequently the mechanisms) of thermally induced and UV-light-induced MAPI degradation are very different. According to the literature, temperature-induced degradation of perovskite (at 85 °C and higher temperatures) leads to the release of solid PbI2 and volatile HI and CH3NH2 according to the reported reaction:40 CH3NH3PbI3 = PbI2 + CH3NH2 + HI(1)
Here 85 °C is a standard temperature for photovoltaic device stability tests according to the IEC norms. Notably, HI in ref. 38 escapes more readily from the perovskite than CH3NH2. This was explained by hydrogen-like bonding of amine species in the perovskite lattice. However, according to our thermogravimetric analysis data (see Fig. S6, ESI†), no significant amount of iodine-containing species is released below 325 °C. The mass loss starting at 100 °C and reaching a maximum at 150 °C is entirely due to the formation of CH3NH2 molecules and its fragments. As a result, no chemical interaction with gold happens at elevated temperatures, even up to 150 °C. It is worth pointing out here that other known degradation factors like humidity cannot induce the transformation of highly inert gold into any complex phase or the formation of RPMs via iodine and MAI release from perovskites since a photochemical process is obligatory for the formation of elemental iodine oxidized from any form of iodides. For example, according to the literature, the main perovskite degradation products under humidity are known to be PbI2 and MAI,41 intermediate phases such as (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O,42 or hydrated perovskite CH3NH3PbI3·H2O.43 The released MAI turns into an aqueous amorphous form and doesn't decompose to molecular iodine which can lead to the formation of an RPM with MAI. In our study, PbI2 was the only perovskite decomposition product observed in the mixture of MAPI/Au powders after 14 days of exposure to 55% relative humidity in a desiccator (see Fig. S9†).41,43
On the other hand, UV-light induced degradation of perovskite differs from the high-temperature decomposition and may cause further decomposition of MAI via the reactions of photogenerated charge carriers.7 Valence band holes (h+) and conduction band electrons (e−) formed in the TiO2 and MAPI have been found to be responsible for the light-induced degradation of perovskite according to the sequence: 2h+ + 3I− = I3−(2) 2e− + O2 + 2H+ = H2O2(3)
This is in line with previous studies of UV-light induced perovskite decomposition.44,45 Unfortunately, not only UV-light can be harmful for the perovskite. Even green light from a 532 nm laser beam in Raman spectrometers is able to decompose perovskite into PbI2 and, finally, into polyiodide species.34 This finding together with our experimental results shows that even visible light can degrade hybrid perovskites irreversibly, creating danger for gold electrodes.
We postulate that the presence of iodine in the MAPI/Au system is a critical factor which promotes degradation of metallic gold. According to the Pearson hard and soft acid base concept, gold (Au+) and iodide (I−) are the soft acid and the soft base respectively, so having a strong affinity to each other.46 But as we mentioned earlier in the text, the presence of only gold and iodine does not lead to the intensive chemical interaction. The situation dramatically changes when molecular iodine I2 transforms into polyiodide ion I3− through the classical “soft” acid–base reaction:47 I2 + I− = I3−(4)
Polyiodide species are known to have strong reactivity towards various metals including gold. This chemical interaction has been widely used in microelectronics for simple and fast etching of gold electrodes at room temperature. Polyiodide for etching is prepared from I2 and KI (or NaI) in the form of a water solution.48
Here we show that in the case of solid-state perovskite solar cells polyiodide ions are also able to appear through the simultaneous release and interaction of MAI and I2 from MAPI under UV-irradiation. But in contrast to the KI–nI2 system where metallic gold oxidizes with the formation of gold(I) iodide, the interaction of the MAI–nI2 RPM with metallic gold leads to the formation of [AuI2]− and [AuI4]− chemical species which further interact with MA+ cations to form the (MA)2Au2I6 phase.
Based on these facts, we can conclude that the chemical nature of gold makes it vulnerable in iodine-containing systems such as CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cells. Several ways of solving this problem are possible: replacing gold with a more stable electrode material (e.g. carbon), Au/HTM/MAPI interface engineering with buffer layers, or replacing vulnerable organic selective layers (e.g. spiro-OMeTAD) with more stable inorganic materials (e.g. NiO49). The second is considered to be a promising approach, already reported in a number of articles50,51 where buffer layers were applied on metal/HTM (e.g. metallic Cr27) and HTM/perovskite interfaces (e.g. MoS2,52 Al2O3,53 and graphene oxide54) in order to block ion migration from perovskite or the metal electrode through the solar cell. In most cases, the presence of a buffer layer improves the stability of PSCs which may also be caused by the chemical stability of these materials to highly reactive polyiodide melts. For more effective stabilization of PSCs further research in this field is required.
Conclusions
Summing up, we conceived and proved a possible degradation mechanism of gold electrodes in lead iodide PSCs based on chemical interaction between Au and iodine-containing products of perovskite decomposition. UV-light-induced decomposition of MAPI leads to the release of I2 and MAI resulting in the formation of highly reactive polyiodide melts with the general formula MAI–nI2. RPMs can react with the Au electrode oxidizing it and converting it into ionic [AuI2]− and [AuI4]− complexes which are able to form the (MA)2Au2I6 phase on Au/perovskite interfaces or diffuse through the solar cell. (MA)2Au2I6 was also synthesized as a single phase from MAI, Au, and I2 and comprehensively characterized by a number of methods, revealing its crystal structure parameters (tetragonal symmetry, a = b = 8.457 Å, and c = 12.415 Å), chemical structure ([AuI2]−, [AuI4]−, and CH3NH3+ components), and optical properties (sharp absorption edge with Eg ∼ 1.16–1.18 eV). As a result, we show that gold is not a completely stable material for use in iodine-based perovskite solar cells. The poor stability together with high cost of metallic gold makes it essential to replace it with cheaper and more stable electrode materials such as carbon and copper.
Experimental section
Materials and methods
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I = MAI, Dyesol), iodine (I2, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), lead iodide (PbI2, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), gold (99.99%), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, >99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, >98%, Sigma-Aldrich), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4, anhydrous, >99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) were commercially purchased.

Preparation of perovskite. 
Perovskite was synthesized via a solution method in DMSO. 1 M solution of PbI2 and MAI in a 1:1 ratio was deposited on glass substrates by doctor-blading and then annealed at 100 °C until complete evaporation of the solvent. Perovskite powders were also prepared from DMSO solution via complete solvent evaporation and powder annealing at 100 °C.


Degradation experiments. 
Powders of MAPI and metallic gold (about 100 micron particles) were mixed in a volumetric ratio of 2:1, respectively. The obtained mixture was divided into two equal parts and used for degradation experiments with different key factors (temperature and UV-irradiation).


Thermal degradation. 
The MAPI/Au mixture was sealed in a glass vial and annealed at 150 °C for 240 hours. Such a high annealing temperature was chosen to speed up the release of volatile degradation products from perovskite during its thermal decomposition, as inferred from the TGA data (see ESI, Fig. S6†).


UV-light degradation. 
Another part of the MAPI/Au mixture was sealed in a quartz cuvette in order to prevent chemical interaction of perovskite with ozone molecules, abundantly generated under UV-irradiation, and keep all the potential degradation products in place with no dissipation to the surroundings; this simulates operation conditions of any sealed solar cell. The UV-lamp emission wavelength was about 254 nm. The sealed mixture was exposed to UV-irradiation for 10 hours. Every hour the UV-lamp was turned off for 20 minutes in order to prevent strong heating of the lamp. During the whole experiment the sample was kept at room temperature with a thermostat excluding the possible influence of heating on the light-induced degradation.


Reactive polyiodide melt preparation. 
RPMs were prepared in a glass vial by simple mixing of I2 and MAI powders in a 2:1 molar ratio at room temperature. Complete conversion of solid powders to a liquid melt took about 1–2 min with constant shaking.


(MA)2Au2I6 phase preparation. 
The (MA)2Au2I6 film was prepared via conversion of the thermally evaporated gold film by RPMs. The time of conversion was varied from 5 min for a thin film of (MA)2Au2I6 on gold to 30 min for complete conversion of the 200 nm gold film. The excess iodine was extracted by multiple rinsing in CCl4. The excess MAI was evaporated at 150 °C for 30 minutes since the (MA)2Au2I6 phase is stable at this temperature.
The (MA)2Au2I6 powder was prepared via a solid phase synthesis from MAI, I2, and Au in a 1:1:1 molar ratio in a sealed glass vial. The preparation temperature was 150 °C, and the period of growth reached 5 days.

Characterization

X-ray powder diffraction. 
X-ray powder diffraction analysis was performed using a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 (Japan) with a rotating copper anode (CuKα irradiation, 0.15418 nm). XRD patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 5–60° with a 0.02° step. Diffraction maxima were indexed using the PDF-2 database. The pattern fitting was provided using WinXPOW software.


Raman spectroscopy. 
Raman spectroscopy was performed using an InVia Raman microscope setup (Renishaw, UK) equipped with a 514 nm laser source and power neutral density filters. All the spectra were collected using a 50× long focus objective, 5–50% laser power, and acquisition time in the range of 5–30 seconds. The laser power and acquisition time were adjusted properly taking into account the limited stability of (MA)2Au2I6 samples under laser irradiation (see the ESI†). A silicon wafer was used for preliminary calibration.


Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. 
FTIR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Frontier infrared spectrometer in the 400–7000 cm−1 wavenumber range using the diffuse reflectance mode. Thin films of (MA)2Au2I6 were obtained on gold films following the method described above. For this analysis, gold was converted by RPMs into the (MA)2Au2I6 phase incompletely, preserving the underlying gold film as a mirror for diffuse reflectance.


UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. 
DRS spectra were recorded using a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer) with pre-aligned tungsten–halogen and deuterium excitation sources in the 300–1500 nm wavelength range.


SEM and EPMA. 
Electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) was performed using a Zeiss Supra 40 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an X-max 80 EDS detector (Oxford Instruments). The accelerating voltage for EPMA and SEM was 20 keV.


TGA-DSC. 
Thermogravimetric analysis including differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) was performed on an STA 409 PC Luxx thermal analyser (NETZSCH, Germany). The released gases were in situ detected during the TGA experiment using a coupled QMS 403 C Aeolos quadrupole mass spectrometer (NETZSCH, Germany). During the measurements about 10 mg of MAPI powder was heated from room temperature to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under an argon flow (10 mL min−1).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  X-ray diffraction patterns of mixed powders of MAPI and gold before (black line) and after degradation under high temperature (red line) and UV-light irradiation (blue line) conditions. Brown and orange vertical bars correspond to MAPI and PbI2 reflections; the “Au” label refers to metallic gold reflections shown for the reference; asterisks indicate peaks of the unknown phase.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Photographs of Au films before and after their interaction with RPMs; (b) SEM micrograph of the black film; and (c) XRD pattern of a gold film converted by RPMs; red bars correspond to reflections of the unknown phase from Fig. 1; black squares refer to the black phase in (a); blue and green bars correspond to reflections of MAI and Cs2Au2I6 (card no. 23-889), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Fitted XRD pattern of a single phase (MA)2Au2I6 sample; (b) Raman spectra of (MA)2Au2I6 (black line) and MAI (blue line). The inset shows a fragment of the (MA)2Au2I6 spectrum in the 80–200 cm−1 region; (c) FTIR spectrum of the (MA)2Au2I6 phase with assigned vibrational modes. The inset shows a fragment of the FTIR spectrum in the 2400–3500 cm−1 region.	 

 	Fig. 4  XRD pattern of UV-degraded MAPI/Au (black line) compared with experimentally obtained (MA)2Au2I6 phase reflections (pink bars). Asterisks show the unknown phase which represents neither MAPI (brown bars) nor PbI2 (orange bars) reflections.	 
CH3NH3PbI3 = PbI2 + CH3NH2 + HI	(1)
2h+ + 3I− = I3−	(2)
