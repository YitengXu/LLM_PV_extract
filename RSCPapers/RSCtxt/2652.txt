    , Accepted 21st July 2017First published on 21st July 2017AbstractThis work unfolds novel electrocatalytic effects of tin for all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). By the introduction of Sn2+ ions into the electrolyte, tin nanoparticles are in situ electrodeposited on a carbon felt electrode. The effectiveness of the two tin species (Sn2+ and Sn4+) as well as their impact on the kinetics of cathode (VO22+/VO2+) and anode (V3+/V2+) half-reactions are also evaluated comprehensively. Cyclic voltammetry reflects the excellent improvement in reaction kinetics, particularly for the anode half-reaction (i.e. V3+/V2+ reduction) by reducing its peak potential separation from 1011 to 589 mV, owing to the deposition of tin nanoparticles in its vicinity. The electrocatalytic effects of tin cause a significant improvement in key performance parameters of voltage efficiency, energy efficiency (EE), specific discharge capacity, discharge energy density and cycling stability for VRFBs. The VRFBs employing Sn2+ ions in the anolyte exhibit an EE of 77.3% at a high current density of 150 mA cm−2 while the corresponding specific discharge capacity and discharge energy density are increased by 26.2 and 32.0%, respectively, as compared to the pristine system. Thus, electrolyte utilization is also increased at faster charge/discharge rates due to the reduction of overpotentials. Various characterization techniques confirm the deposition and effectiveness of tin at the electrodes. EIS studies reveal remarkable acceleration in the charge transfer process for the V3+/V2+ redox couple which is considered as a performance limiting reaction for VRFBs nowadays. Therefore, the convenience in its application coupled with effectiveness for VRFBs, makes tin a commercially feasible electrocatalyst for this technology.
1 Introduction
The alarming depletion of non-renewable energy sources (coal, gas, oil, etc.) and the environmental as well as health hazards associated with them have brought the scientific community to think seriously about the utilization of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal, etc. over the last few decades. However, due to their intermittent nature, renewable energy sources are not reliable for continuously meeting the energy demands. Therefore, serious attention is given by the scientific community to the development of technologies to efficiently store energy from these sources. Especially, the development of electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems (batteries, capacitors, fuel cells, solar cells, etc.) are highly pursued research areas.1,2 Among many types of secondary batteries (lithium ion, sodium ion, redox flow, etc.), redox flow batteries, especially all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) proposed by Skyllas-Kazacos's group at UNSW in the mid-1980s,3 are a promising candidate for medium-to-large scale grid applications.4–6 Their key advantages are high energy efficiency, decoupling of energy and power, flexibility in design, safety, reliability, environmentally friendliness, low chances of cross-contamination and long cycle life. In the VRFBs, energy is stored in the form of electrolytes flowing through a cell consisting of electrodes and a membrane. The positive electrolyte (catholyte) and the negative electrolyte (anolyte) are comprised of VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples, respectively, having a theoretical potential of 1.26 V. Generally, the electrolyte media for the conduction of protons is sulfuric acid, whereas mixed-acid electrolytes (sulfuric and hydrochloric acids)7 also look promising. Carbon felt (CF) and graphite felt are generally used as electrode materials due to their low cost and chemical and electrochemical stability in a highly acidic environment.8 In the early years of VRFB technology development, an electrode was considered to provide only an electrochemical surface for redox reactions to take place and little attention was given to the performance enhancement by its modification or introduction of electrocatalysts. But for the last five years or so, researchers in this field, have focused their efforts to improve the kinetics of electrodes along with addressing other issues such as the membrane, electrolyte and system. Various reports show that improved reaction kinetics at the electrodes can significantly overcome the issues of various polarizations arising from charge transfer, mass transfer, ohmic and activation overpotentials. The recent work on the improvement of electrochemical reaction kinetics at the electrodes for VRFBs involves a variety of surface treatment procedures and the use of various catalysts.9 Noticeable surface treatments are thermal treatment,10 plasma treatment,11 microwave treatment12 and other reagent treatments like Hummer's reagent,13 Fenton's reagent,14etc. Various electrocatalysts, either carbon-based or metal-based or their composites, have also been evaluated to improve the VRFB performance. Carbon-based catalysts mainly include graphene (edge-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets, graphene oxide nanoplatelets, graphene oxide nanosheets, graphene nanowalls, nitrogen-doped graphene, etc.),15 multi-walled carbon nanotubes and/or carbon nanofibers16,17 and nitrogen-doped carbon materials.18 Metal oxides like niobium oxide,19 tungsten trioxide,20 lead oxide,21 cerium oxide,22 titanium oxide,23 manganese oxide24 and zirconium oxide25 have also been studied and found effective. However, one of the problems of metal oxides and other electrocatalysts may be the tedious fabrication process and stability issues after long cycling as the embedded particles can peel off from the surface, and also the CF fibers may lose their stability in the fabrication process, thus hindering their application in commercial systems. Since the realization of the effectiveness of catalysts on VRFB performance, there has been an increasing trend of electrode modification studies. Formerly, it was thought that the kinetics of a positive half reaction (V(IV)/V(V)) is slower than that of the negative half reaction (V(III)/V(II)) and thus needs improvement, but recent reports have pointed out the more sluggish kinetics of the latter.26 In fact, there is a need for improvement of both half reactions. Electrolyte additives, both organic and inorganic, have been known since long to improve the performance of VRFBs.27 Electrolyte additives especially organic are generally studied in VRFBs to improve the solubility and stability of vanadium species as well as to avoid precipitation because the four vanadium species tend to precipitate under different conditions of solubility and temperature: V(V) precipitates in the form of V2O5 at elevated temperatures (45 °C or above) and V(III) precipitates at lower temperatures.28–30 But recently electrolyte additives, noticeably metal salts, have been found to cause a catalytic effect on VRFB performance.31–33 For instance, employing bismuth as an electrolyte additive showed better kinetics for V(II)/V(III) redox reactions which improved the VRFB performance significantly.31 Therefore, functioning of electrolyte additives as catalysts, because of their convenience in application, can significantly promote VRFB technology by lowering its cost with the increase of fuel utilization. Tin is a non-toxic, cheap and safe semiconductor metal of Group 14 and has been used for catalytic applications in the field of energy storage technologies and other catalytic applications.34,35 However, catalytic application of tin for VRFB technology has not been explored yet, though it has been studied as one of the redox couple for redox flow batteries.36 Electrodeposition of tin has been known since the nineteenth century in both acidic and alkaline media. Also, there are no corrosion effects of tin in sulfuric acid as it is not reacted by dilute sulfuric acid. Therefore, the electrolyte medium and potential conditions in VRFBs can be suitable for in situ electrodeposition of tin. Moreover, the properties of corrosion resistance, wettability and electrical conductivity of tin also favor its suitability for catalytic applications. Based on the effectiveness of metal salts as electrolyte additives and the catalytic properties of tin, we employed it for VRFBs. This will open a new window of application of tin-based catalysts for this technology.
In this work, for the first time, catalytic effects of tin through in situ electrodeposition on the performance of VRFBs are comprehensively studied. Not only the effect of concentration of tin but also its presence in either the anolyte and/or the catholyte as well as the speciation effect i.e. stannous (Sn(II)) and stannic (Sn(IV)) are taken into account. The correlation of performance improvement with the electrochemistry of tin and the mechanism of electrocatalytic function of tin are also discussed.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods
The chemicals used were VOSO4·nH2O, H2SO4 (95%, Daejung Chemicals), SnCl2·2H2O (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and SnCl4·5H2O (98%, Sigma-Aldrich). Polyacrylonitrile-based carbon felt (XF-30A) and perflourosulfonic acid-based membrane (Nafion 117) were purchased from TOYOBO Inc. and DuPont, respectively. All solutions were prepared in de-ionized water.
V(IV) electrolyte solution of 1.5 M concentration was prepared by dissolution of VOSO4·nH2O in 3 M sulfuric acid. V(III) electrolyte solution was prepared by electrolytic reduction of V(IV) solution. The concentration of vanadium in the electrolyte solution was confirmed by UV-visible measurements. Small quantities (up to 0.02 M) of Sn2+ and Sn4+ ions were added to the electrolyte solution in the form of their chloride salts.
2.2 Characterization
The SEM images were taken with a FE-SEM (Teneo Volume Scope) and EDS analysis was carried out with an Inspect-F SEM instrument, after washing the cycled CF samples several times with de-ionized water. The conductivity of the electrolyte samples was measured with a bench top conductivity meter (Orion Star A212, Thermo Scientific). The UV-Vis measurements were made with a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent). The anolyte and catholyte samples were diluted by a factor of 20 and then scanned in the wavelength range of 800–200 nm. Three readings were taken for each sample. For tin crossover studies, concentration analysis of tin in the electrolyte samples was carried out with an ICP-OES instrument (Varian-720ES, Agilent Technologies). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the cycled CF samples was performed with a PHI 5000 Versa Probe (Ulvac-PHI) instrument, using an Al – Kα monochromator source (power 24.5 W, spot size: 100 μm × 100 μm). The spectra of the samples were taken with a constant analyser energy mode with a pass energy of 117.4 eV for a wide scan and 46.95 eV for a narrow scan. The instrument was calibrated with an adventitious C 1s peak (284.6 eV). The CF samples were washed with DI water before XPS measurements.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were carried out with an Autolab PGSTAT 302 electrochemical workstation (Metrohm-Autolab B.V.). A glassy carbon (GC) electrode (diameter = 3 mm) was used as a working electrode along with Pt mesh as counter and Ag/AgCl as reference electrodes. Before each measurement, the GC electrode was polished with 0.05 micron γ-Al2O3 powder till a mirror-like surface finishing. Cyclic voltammetry was performed in a 1.5 M solution of VO2+/V3+ (1:1), 1.5 M VO2+ or V3+ in 3 M H2SO4 with/without tin ions. Cyclic voltammetry of the anolyte at different scan rates was also carried out. Linear sweep voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in a solution of 1.5 M VO2+/3 M H2SO4. At least three scans were taken for each measurement and the third scan is plotted in the cyclic and linear sweep voltammograms. EIS studies were carried out in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV at potentials of 1 V and −0.6 V in solutions of 1.5 M VO2+/3 M H2SO4 and 1.5 M V3+/3 M H2SO4, respectively. The EIS data were fitted with equivalent circuit models using the NOVA software.
2.4 VRFB performance
The schematic of the VRFB cell fixture is shown in Fig. S1a.† The dimensions of the cell are: the end plate (13 × 9.5 × 2 cm), current collector plate (13 × 9.5 × 1 cm), and flow frame (9.5 × 6 × 0.3 cm). A single cell was assembled with a Nafion 117 membrane sandwiched between two CF (PAN-based, thickness = 4.0 ± 0.3 mm) electrodes, the anode and cathode, with an active area of 25 cm2. Viton gaskets were used between the flow frame (with CF inserted) and the graphite current collector (gasket thickness = 0.6 mm) and between the current collector and the membrane (gasket thickness = 0.4 mm), at each side. Catholyte (V(IV)) and anolyte (V(III)) solutions of 50 mL each with a concentration of 1.5 M in 3 M H2SO4 were stored in glass bottles and pumped through the cell with a peristaltic pump (Masterflex, Thermo Fisher Co.) at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1 (as shown in Fig. S1b†). Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling at different current densities were controlled with a Maccor Battery Testing System Series 4000 (Maccor Inc.). A potential window of 1.60–0.7 V was applied for all experiments. To avoid oxidation from air, both electrolyte solutions were purged with nitrogen gas prior to cycling and sealed for all experiments. The volumes of the electrolyte solutions that remained after the experiments in the reservoirs as well as retained on the CF electrodes were also monitored. The as-received CF was used for all experiments. However, for experiments with thermally oxidized CF electrodes, thermal treatment was carried out at 450 °C for 4 hours in air. The experiments for reproducibility confirmation were carried out under the same testing conditions. The values of EE, VE, CE, specific capacity, and discharge energy density were averaged for four cycles at each current density. The experiments with a different cell design were also conducted under the same experimental conditions but with a different cell fixture.
For tin crossover studies, the VRFB cell as shown in Fig. S1† was assembled with the electrolytes containing Sn2+ ions either in the anolyte or catholyte. The electrolyte solutions were pumped for 48 hours at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1, without applying the galvanostatic/potentiostatic conditions. After that, the volume of each electrolyte solution was measured and its tin content was analysed by ICP-OES.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the presumptive electrocatalytic activity of tin in a VRFB system. The reduction potentials for Sn2+/Sn and Sn4+/Sn2+ redox couples are −0.13 V and 0.15 V, respectively, versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Thus, they can be practicable candidates for in situ deposition during the flow battery operation. As the deposition potential for the Sn2+/Sn redox couple is adjacent to the V3+/V2+ reduction reaction, its impact can therefore be significant for this half-reaction. The influence of the tin activity on vanadium reactions and VRFB performance will be discussed in the following sections using various analytical techniques.

Fig. 2 shows the electrochemical performance of the electrolyte with and without tin ions. All potentials are reported with respect to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode unless mentioned otherwise. Fig. 2a shows cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of 3 M H2SO4 with/without Sn2+ or Sn4+ ions which reveal two peaks, the one in the cathodic scan at −0.49 V can be attributed to the electrodeposition of Sn from Sn2+ and the corresponding oxidation peak during the anodic scan at −0.39 V can be assigned to the dissolution of Sn to Sn2+. It can be seen that electrodeposition of Sn starts at −0.47 V and the peaks for tin deposition appear at −0.49 V, whereas the corresponding peaks for tin dissolution appear at −0.39 V. The reverse anodic peak current intensity is higher than the cathodic one, as generally evidenced in electrodeposition of metals from ions.37 Therefore, the low peak intensity of tin deposition is due to the nucleation growth mechanism during the electrocrystallization process, as generally evidenced in tin electrodeposition.38Fig. 2b shows CVs for the V3+/V2+ redox couple in 1.5 M V3+/3 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the presence of Sn2+ ions. It can be noticed that the Sn deposition peak (as evidenced in the CV in sulfuric acid as shown in Fig. 2a) has disappeared. Actually, the tin deposition peak aligns with the V3+ reduction peak. This coupling of redox activities of vanadium and tin has a phenomenal impact on the reaction kinetics of the V3+/V2+ redox couple. It results in the extraordinary reduction in the peak potential separation of the V3+/V2+ redox couple as well as a significant increase in peak currents, as compared to the V3+ electrolyte without Sn2+ ions. This results in the faster reaction kinetics of the anodic couple redox reactions, particularly the V3+ reduction reaction. As a matter of fact, as soon as the deposition of tin takes place, it facilitates the V3+/V2+ reduction reaction. The kinetics of the V2+/V3+ oxidation reaction also seem to be enhanced. As shown in Fig. S2c,†the CVs obtained with 1.5 M solution of VO2+/V3+ (1:1) in 3.0 M H2SO4 also give a picture of improvement in the kinetics of vanadium redox reactions. There are well-defined peaks of oxidation of V(IV) to V(V) and reduction of V(III) to V(II) at 1.23 and −0.81 V, respectively, for the pristine electrolyte. The reversibility of these peaks is low in the corresponding reverse scan. It is known that the GC electrode has a poor reversibility towards vanadium redox couples combined with the fact that the cyclic voltammetry of vanadium redox couples depends on many factors including chemical/electrochemical treatment of the electrode surface, vanadium solution concentration, vanadium solution composition, type of working electrode, etc.26,39 Therefore, the low intensity of V(V) reduction and V(II) oxidation peaks may possibly be due to the low reversibility of these redox reactions at the GC electrode surface, initial scan direction and electrolyte composition. In Fig. S2c,† the anodic peaks at −0.39 V can be seen in the presence of tin ions, whereas the corresponding tin reduction peak aligns with the V(III)/V(II) reduction peak. The V3+ reduction peak potential is decreased by 90 and 210 mV in the presence of Sn4+ and Sn2+, respectively. During the reverse scan, Sn is oxidized again to Sn2+ or Sn4+ at −0.39 V. Clearly, both Sn2+ and Sn4+ improve the kinetics of VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+, with the role of Sn2+ being more dominating. The corresponding wide-scan CVs of the sulfuric acid with tin ions are shown in Fig. S2a.† During the scan in the anodic direction, a reduction peak at −0.50 V is seen only in the case of Sn2+, whereas oxidation peaks at −0.39 V appear in the case of both Sn2+ and Sn4+. Theoretically, Sn2+ is reduced to Sn at a potential of −0.136 V (vs. SHE), whereas Sn4+ is reduced to Sn2+ at +0.151 V (vs. SHE). The reduction peak of tin species at −0.50 V is not visible in the presence of vanadium redox couples (Fig. S2c†). It means that Sn2+ is deposited at the electrode just before the reduction of V3+ to V2+ and its peak couples with the V3+ reduction peak. As a result, not only the peak potentials of the V3+/V2+ reduction reaction are shifted towards the right side but also the peak amplitudes are increased significantly. From these results, it can be inferred that the presence of Sn2+ can improve the kinetics of vanadium redox reactions more significantly, as compared to Sn4+. It is also clear that the kinetics of V3+/V2+ are enhanced much more than VO2+/VO2+, by both Sn2+ and Sn4+. Similarly, as shown in Fig. S2b† the CVs measured in anolyte solution (1.5 M V3+/3 M H2SO4) also depict an improvement in the kinetics of vanadium redox reactions in the presence of Sn2+ ions. In view of the vanadium redox reactions (eqn (S1) and (S2)†), it seems that the cathode reaction may be more complicated than the anode reaction. This was the conclusion of earlier reports on vanadium reaction kinetics,40 being one of the factors that research studies have been pursued mainly for the improvement of the cathode reactions, with little attention given to the anode reactions. In fact, both the anode and cathode reaction kinetics need to be improved for higher performance of VRFBs as the recent reports claim the sluggish kinetics of the anode reactions, emphasizing more work for the enhancement of its kinetics.26,40 This study indicates that the presence of tin ions slightly decreases the onset potential for the oxidation of VO2+ as compared to the pristine electrolyte. But the onset potential for the reduction of V3+ is remarkably improved, especially with Sn2+ in the electrolyte. Fig. 2(c and d) show the LSV plots of positive and negative vanadium redox couples, respectively, in VO2+ solution. The onset potential is marginally lower in the presence of Sn2+ ions in the anodic scan of the cathodic redox reaction. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) plots of the reduction reaction (Fig. 2d) of the anodic redox couple show a noticeable reduction in the onset potential. Corresponding to a potential of −0.7 V, the current value with the Sn2+ ions in the electrolyte is about 2.5 times higher than that of the pristine electrolyte. The CVs at different scan rates of the anolyte with and without Sn2+ ions are shown in Fig. 2(e and f), respectively. The cathodic peak current of the V3+/V2+ redox couple increases linearly with the square root of the scan rate (as shown in Fig. S2d†), which means that the redox reaction of V3+/V2+ is quasi-reversible. The fact that the peak potential separation is significantly reduced in the presence of Sn2+ ions, i.e. from 1011 mV to 589 mV at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 is obvious from Fig. 2(e and f). The potential of tin oxidation/reduction is between the potential of VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+, providing suitable conditions for its deposition and dissolution from/to the electrolyte to/from the electrodes. In short, CVs and LSV plots show improvement in the kinetics of vanadium redox reactions upon introduction of tin ions into the electrolyte, especially for the sluggish V3+/V2+ redox couple with a more pronounced effect from Sn2+ ions.

Performance of the VRFB employing electrolytes with tin ions as the electrolyte additive is thoroughly investigated by varying the concentration of Sn2+ using a VRFB cell as shown in Fig. S1.† The electrolyte concentration of 1.5 M (theoretical capacity = 40.2 A h L−1) at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1 and a voltage window of 1.60–0.7 V was employed for all VRFB tests. Fig. 3 gives the effect of concentration of Sn2+ ions on the VRFB performance. Sn2+ ions were added to both the catholyte and the anolyte in varying concentrations of 0.005, 0.01 and 0.02 M. Sn2+ ions are found to be useful in reducing the overpotential for both charging and discharging, as shown in Fig. 3a. At a high current density of 150 mA cm−2, the charging potential is 26 mV lower and discharging potential is 54 mV higher (at 2.5 A h L−1) with an electrolyte containing 0.01 M Sn2+ ions, thus clearly reducing the overpotentials and improving the performance by increasing the useful potential window by 80 mV as compared to the pristine electrolyte. This improvement of activation potentials confirms the effectiveness of Sn2+ ions in the electrolyte. The variation of the energy efficiency (EE), voltage efficiency (VE) and coulomb efficiency (CE) with current density at different concentrations of Sn2+ is shown in Fig. 3(b and c). CE is the ratio of the discharge capacity to the charge capacity, whereas EE is the ratio of the discharge energy density to the charge energy density for each cycle. The VE is obtained by dividing the EE by the CE. The CE values increase with an increase in the current density. Addition of Sn2+ ions causes an increase in the EE, especially remarkable at high current densities, as shown in Fig. 3b. At 150 mA cm−2 with 0.05 M Sn2+ ions, the EE increases from 73.6 (pristine) to 75.8% while a further rise to 76.2% is observed with 0.01 M concentration. However, increasing the concentration to 0.02 M decreases the EE to 75.5%. Thus, employing 0.01 M Sn2+ ions has the highest VE and EE values with a minor variation in the CE. One noteworthy thing is the variation of discharge capacity with current density as shown in Fig. 3d. It is found that the presence of tin ions causes a significant increase in the specific capacity, the effect being more pronounced at higher current densities. At 150 mA cm−2, Sn2+ ions enhance the discharge capacity from 19.2 to 23.5 A h L−1 with an average increase of 22.6%. At this current density, electrolyte utilization is increased from 47.6 (pristine) to 58.4% (with 0.01 M Sn2+) with reference to the theoretical capacity of 40.2 A h L−1. Specific discharge energy density values (Fig. 3e) are also increased at all current densities, noticeably at higher ones. At 150 mA cm−2, the discharge energy density value increases by 26.9% (from 22.2 to 28.1 W h L−1). Fig. 3f shows the cycling performance for 50 cycles at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 with pristine and 0.01 M Sn2+ ions in terms of specific discharge capacity and EE. In the presence of tin ions, the specific discharge capacity shows improvement as compared to the pristine electrolyte, owing to the increased electrolyte utilization as a result of the enhanced reversibility of the vanadium redox reactions.

The speciation effect of tin ions on VRFB performance was also taken into consideration. Tin exists in two oxidation states, i.e. Sn2+ and Sn4+. When these two tin species were evaluated for VRFBs, different behaviors are observed. The results of VRFB performance with 0.01 M of Sn2+ or Sn4+ are shown in Fig. 4. The galavanostatic charge/discharge cycle at 150 mA cm−2 shows that Sn4+ contributes to decrease the discharge overpotential by 36 mV (at 2.5 A h L−1), but has no effect in reducing the overpotentials for charging. As a result, a small increase in the discharge capacity from 19.2 to 20.8 A h L−1 is observed. This response is quite different from that of Sn2+ ions which have shown considerable reduction in overpotentials for both charging and discharging. Fig. 4(b and c) display the average values of EE, VE and CE at different current densities. An EE increase of 1.3% at 150 mA cm−2 is observed with the electrolyte containing Sn4+ ions. The specific discharge capacity and discharge energy density with the electrolyte having Sn4+ ions, however, are lower than Sn2+ ions, especially at higher current densities as shown in Fig. 4(d and e). From these results, it can be concluded that Sn4+ ions marginally improve the performance of VRFBs, but less effective than Sn2+ ions which play a more significant role in enhancing the performance of VRFBs, probably due to the difference in their electrochemical behavior.
 Fig. 4  Comparison of VRFB performance with 0.01 M of Sn2+ and Sn4+ (electrolyte concentration: 1.5 M, flow rate: 50 mL min−1 and theoretical capacity: 40.2 A h L−1) (a) galvanostatic charge/discharge at 150 mA cm−2 with 0.01 M Sn4+ in the electrolyte; (b) EE at different current densities; (c) CE and VE at different current densities; (d) specific discharge capacity vs. cycle number at different current densities; (e) specific discharge energy density vs. cycle number at different current densities and (f) capacity retention with and without 0.01 M Sn2+ or Sn4+ ions in the electrolyte at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. 
Another important issue in VRFB technology is the capacity decay mainly due to the undesirable crossover of vanadium species through the membrane in addition to protons as well as the irreversible change of the vanadium species. Though capacity decay is basically related to the membrane performance and requires development of specialized membranes to alleviate this problem, however, it is reported that electrodes also have a considerable influence on capacity retention as the capacity loss may partly be due to the degradation of the electrodes.41,42 The improvement observed in capacity retention by the surface treatment of electrodes or the introduction of catalysts, reported in the literature, supports this fact.15–17 During cycling, the charge transfer resistance at the electrodes, especially the anode, increases which results in the increase of overpotentials for both charge and discharge reactions of vanadium redox couples, thus decaying the capacity.42 In this work, Sn2+ ions are additionally found to improve the capacity retention of the system. The volumes of the catholyte and anolyte were monitored for each test and it was found that after 70 cycles (about 150 hours of VRFB operation), the volume of the catholyte was about 4 mL more than that of the anolyte, indicating a net transfer of the anolyte to the catholyte. This imbalance of the electrolyte during cycling is a serious problem in VRFBs and membranes are being developed by researchers to prevent the crossover of vanadium species through the membrane. Another fact inferred from the change of the electrolyte volume after cycling is that the tin ions may not help prevent the crossover of vanadium species. Thus, the improvement in capacity retention may be attributed to the enhancement of the reaction kinetics at the electrodes, involving higher reversibility of the redox reactions at the electrode while increasing the electrolyte utilization. As shown in Fig. 4f, over the 50 cycles at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 (the cycles from the 21st to the 70th) with 0.01 M Sn2+ ions in the electrolyte, it retains 85.3% of its initial capacity measured at the 21st cycle (33.3 A h L−1 at the 21st cycle to 28.5 A h L−1 at the 70th cycle) while the pristine electrolyte retains only 76.6% at the 70th cycle. Thus, Sn2+ ions also help improve the stability of the system. The effect of Sn4+ ions on the capacity retention (Fig. 4f) is negligible as compared to that of the Sn2+ ions. In short, a small quantity of Sn2+ ions (0.01 M) as an electrolyte additive can significantly enhance the VRFB performance by improving the key parameters of EE, VE, specific discharge capacity, discharge energy density, capacity retention and fuel utilization (ratio of actual capacity to theoretical capacity).
Having confirmed the higher performance with 0.01 M of Sn2+ as compared to Sn4+, VRFB tests of 0.01 M Sn2+ with thermally oxidized carbon felt were investigated to further confirm the effectiveness of tin ions (Fig. S3†). Thermal treatment is a traditional surface treatment technique to introduce oxygen functional groups on the electrode surface, thus increasing its hydrophilicity. However, the impact of any treatment/catalyst in VRFBs depends also on the type of electrode material used. For the CF electrode material used in this study, thermal treatment (at 450 °C for 4 hours in air) is found to cause a minimal effect on the performance as shown in Fig. S3.† The charging overpotentials remain the same while only a small improvement in the discharging overpotentials is observed at higher current densities. Upon introduction of 0.01 M Sn2+ ions, however, the performance is increased by the thermally oxidized CF. 0.01 M of Sn2+ with thermally oxidized CF gives EE values of 88.9, 85.8, 82.9, and 77.1% and specific discharge capacities of 33.8, 31.5, 28.8, and 23.5 A h L−1 at current densities of 50, 75, 100 and 150 mA cm−2, respectively. Thus, it is apparent that effects of tin ions sufficiently outweigh those of thermal treatment.
As the cell architecture also has a considerable impact on VRFB performance, therefore, tests with 0.01 M of Sn2+ were also conducted with a different cell fixture (Fig. S4a†). With this cell fixture, VRFB performance was measured with the same cell components (electrode and membrane) and experimental conditions (electrolyte concentration, electrolyte volume, and VRFB testing conditions) as for the performance measured with the cell fixture as shown in Fig. S1.† The only difference is the cell design. As shown in Fig. S4(b–d),† addition of Sn2+ increases the specific discharge capacity, EE and VE similar to the cell shown in Fig. S1.† Therefore, in any case, Sn2+ ions show almost the same improvement in performance, regardless of the type of cell fixture used.
To practically evaluate the effectiveness of tin for anode and cathode reactions, 0.01 M of Sn2+ ions were added to either the anolyte or catholyte and the results are presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a compares the performance of the VRFB at 150 mA cm−2 with electrolytes containing tin ions in either the anolyte or catholyte. Sn2+ ions are found to reduce the overpotentials, more significantly in the case of the anolyte. The discharging potential is increased from 1.30 V for the pristine to 1.33 and 1.37 V for the catholyte and the anolyte with Sn2+ ions, respectively. Thus, the iR drop is decreased by 32 and 69 mV for the catholyte and the anolyte, respectively, as compared to the pristine electrolyte with no Sn2+ ions. Therefore, it is clear that the presence of Sn2+ ions improves the charging and discharging potentials, more prominently for the anolyte. The effects on the EE, VE and CE values are displayed in Fig. 4(b and c). Though both electrolytes with Sn2+ ions show relatively decreased CE values at all current densities, the corresponding EE and VE values are increased, particularly in the case of the anolyte which shows an EE of 77.3% (higher by 3.7% than that of the pristine) at a high current density of 150 mA cm−2. The VRFB with the Sn2+ in the anolyte exhibits EE values of 89.3, 86.1 and 83.5% at current densities of 50, 75 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively. The same trend is observed in the specific discharge capacity and specific discharge energy densities (shown in Fig. 5(d and e)) which are improved by the presence of Sn2+ ions either in the catholyte or anolyte at all current densities, prominently at higher current densities. At 150 mA cm−2, the specific discharge capacity (24.2 A h L−1) and specific discharge energy density (29.3 W h L−1) are increased by 26.2 and 32.0%, respectively. Stable cycling performance for 70 charge/discharge cycles in terms of efficiencies is shown in Fig. S5d.† Therefore, the presence of Sn2+ ions, especially in the anolyte, significantly improves the VRFB performance. This also suggests that the anode reaction is the limiting reaction in VRFBs.
 Fig. 5  Effect of 0.01 M Sn2+ present only in the anolyte or catholyte on VRFB performance (electrolyte concentration: 1.5 M, flow rate: 50 mL min−1 and theoretical capacity: 40.2 A h L−1) (a) galvanostatic charge/discharge at 150 mA cm−2; (b) EE at different current densities; (c) CE and VE at different current densities; (d) specific discharge capacity vs. cycle number as a function of current density; (e) specific discharge energy density vs. cycle number at different current densities and (f) Sn2+ crossover studies from the anolyte to the catholyte and vice versa (initial Sn2+ concentration is 10 mM). 
The presence of 0.01 M Sn2+ in the anolyte shows the highest VRFB performance, quite consistent with the findings in the electrochemical measurements (CVs and LSVs). However, the improvement in the performance with Sn2+ ions in the catholyte is addressable, although CV and LSV show some improvement in the reaction kinetics of the VO2+/VO2+ couple. To further investigate this finding, the possibility of the crossover of Sn2+ ions through the cation exchange membrane (Nafion 117) was studied. This was accomplished by flowing the electrolyte through a VRFB cell with 0.01 M Sn2+ ions either in the anolyte or catholyte for 48 hours under the absence of galvanostatic/potentiostatic conditions. In contrast to the cycling conditions, no electrolyte imbalance was evidenced in this case in terms of volume. Thus, it can be inferred that the volume imbalance is due to the transfer of water along with the vanadium species during the charge/discharge reactions. The concentration of Sn after the diffusion experiments was measured by ICP-OES (shown in Fig. 5f). It is found that only ∼10% of Sn2+ ions cross through the membrane in 48 hours due to diffusion effects (difference of tin concentrations in the anolyte and catholyte). The situation can be different during the cycling of VRFBs, as the migration effect (movement of tin ions towards the electrode under the influence of an applied current during the charge/discharge reactions) can also come into play under galvanostatic/potentiostatic conditions. This was evaluated by measuring the CVs of the cycled electrolyte samples which proved the tin ion crossover during cycling. It can be inferred that during the initial charging, the anode is at the negative potential and Sn2+ ions can cross the membrane towards the anolyte under the combined diffusion and migration effects, and thus deposit on the electrode. The reverse can happen during discharging. Also during discharging, reduction takes place at the cathode and Sn2+ ions can deposit, rendering some improvement in the reaction kinetics of the cathode redox couple. Therefore, performance improvement in the catholyte can be partly attributed to the tin ion crossover under the diffusion and migration effects as well as the increased reaction kinetics at the cathode.
In summary, the presence of Sn2+ ions in either the anolyte or catholyte is advantageous, but they play a dominant role in the anolyte presumably by improving the V3+/V2+ redox kinetics which probably needs more improvement than its counterpart VO2+/VO2+. The performance comparison of the VRFB with recently reported studies is shown in Table S1† which shows comparable or higher results with Sn2+ ions in the anolyte coupled with the convenience in its application. The VRFB performance data are validated through reproducibility tests shown in Fig. S6† which show highly reproducible performance in all cases.
The SEM images of the cycled CF and the UV-visible spectra of the anolyte, catholyte and anolyte/catholyte mixture are shown in Fig. 6. Tin nanoparticles can be seen deposited on the anode side of the CF cycled with Sn2+ only in the anolyte (Fig. 6a). With 0.01 M Sn2+ ions added to both the anolyte and the catholyte, the cathode side also shows the presence of tin particles (Fig. 6b). Bright nanoparticles (characteristic white Sn particles from electrodeposition) deposited from the electrolyte containing Sn2+ ions can be seen on the surface of the anode side of the CF (Fig. 6(c–e)). As highlighted in Fig. 6d and S7d,† the sizes of the tin particles are very small, in the range of 50–250 nm. The surface of the CF fibers, however, remains unchanged, even after 70 cycles (more than 150 hours of VRFB operation), thus stability of the CF does not seem to be compromised while tin ions affect the redox reactions of vanadium ions. Fig. 6f shows the EDS of the cycled anode which confirms the elemental nature of the particles on the CF. The tin nanoparticles may get deposited during charging and dissolute during discharging while operating the flow battery. But as a result of continuous cycling, tin particles may get deposited on the CF (more SEM images and EDS results are given in Fig. S7†). As the SEM images were taken after extensively washing the cycled CF electrodes with DI water (evident from the absence of distinct peaks due to the vanadium species and sulfur in the SEM-EDS spectra), it can be inferred that tin nanoparticles are stable at the CF electrode surface. Stability in the performance for more than 150 hours of VRFB operation also predicts the stable electrocatalytic activity of tin. The conductivity of the electrolyte with or without tin ions was also measured and the values are given in Table S2.† There is a little or no change in conductivity upon the addition of tin ions in the electrolytes. Thus, it can be inferred that changes in the electrolyte resistance do not play any role in the improvement of electrochemical performance. The UV-Vis spectra of the electrolyte samples are shown in Fig. 6(g–i). There is no noticeable change in the spectra upon the addition of tin ions in the solutions. Hence, it may be presumed that there are no electronic interactions between the vanadium and tin ions in the electrolytes in the absence of potentiostatic/galvanostatic conditions. The interaction may take place at the electrodes only under the applied potentiostatic/galvanostatic conditions, as proved in the electrochemical and VRFB tests. Therefore, the improvement in VRFB performance may be attributed to the increased reaction kinetics of vanadium redox couples at the electrodes in the presence of tin ions.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the cycled CF samples was also performed. Fig. 7 shows the XPS spectra of the anode side of the cycled CF with the Sn2+ ions added to both the anolyte and the catholyte. The corresponding XPS spectra of the cathode side CF are shown in Fig. S8.†Fig. 7a shows the survey spectra of pristine CF and the anode side of the cycled CF. It can be seen that peaks due to tin appear in the spectrum when the CF was cycled with Sn2+ ions, thus confirming the deposition of tin nanoparticles. Such deposition is also evidenced in the cathode side CF as shown in Fig. S8a.† This is in accordance with the results of EDS and confirms the deposition of tin nanoparticles at both the cathode and anode. Fig. 7b shows the Sn 3d XPS core level spectra of the cycled anode, with Sn2+ ions in both the anolyte and the catholyte. The corresponding spectrum of the cycled cathode is shown in Fig. S8b.† The peaks of Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 appear at the binding energies of 495.6 eV and 487.2 eV, respectively, for both the anode and the cathode. This confirms that tin is deposited at both the anode and cathode, owing to the reversal of potential conditions in the battery during charge/discharge. The deconvoluted O 1s spectrum in Fig. 7c shows a peak corresponding to the metal–oxygen bond at a binding energy of 531.0 eV which indicates that tin particles probably bind with the oxygen sites on the CF electrode. Thus, XPS gives another confirmation of the deposition of tin particles from the electrolyte containing tin ions through in situ electrodeposition.

The above results give a clear picture of the effectiveness of tin ions as an electrolyte additive for VRFBs. In order to further investigate the effect of stannous ions (Sn2+) on the reaction kinetics of vanadium redox couples, EIS was carried out. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots of the VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ couples at potentials of 1.0 and −0.6 V in the solutions of the catholyte and anolyte, respectively. The Nyquist plots of both redox couples consist of a semicircle part in the high-frequency region and linear part in the low-frequency region. The semicircle part corresponds to the charge transfer resistance and linear part corresponds to the mass transfer resistance. This means that redox reactions of both vanadium couples are mix-controlled by charge transfer and diffusion steps.43 Sn2+ ions do not accelerate the charge transfer process in the case of the cathode redox couple (as shown in Fig. 8a). However, the charge transfer resistance of the anode redox couple is remarkably reduced in the presence of Sn2+ ions, as shown in Fig. 8b. The EIS spectra were fitted with equivalent circuit models through simulation. The corresponding equivalent circuits with parameter values are shown in Fig. S9.† In the equivalent circuit model, the intercept on the real axis is ohmic resistance, due to the electrolyte solution, electrode and contact resistance. The semicircle can be assigned to the charge transfer resistance and Q1 is the corresponding electric double layer capacitance while Q2 can be assigned to the Nernst diffusion impedance of the redox couple, where Y and n are the prefactors and exponents of Q. The charge transfer resistance of the V3+/V2+ couple is 218 Ω which is reduced to 14.6 Ω in the presence of Sn2+ in the solution. Therefore, the electron transfer process is increased by almost 15 times in the presence of Sn2+. From this, it can be inferred that stannous ions improve the reaction kinetics of the anode redox couple, mainly by accelerating the charge transfer process.

The tin ions, more precisely Sn2+, cause an electrocatalytic effect through in situ electrodeposition, by improving the reaction kinetics of vanadium redox couples at the CF electrode, as also shown in Fig. 1. The potential of tin electrodeposition from Sn2+ is close to the potential of V3+ reduction, therefore electrodeposition of tin takes place just before the reduction of V3+ and facilitates the electron transfer process for the anode half reaction. As the surface of CF contains oxygen functional groups (for example hydroxyl, carboxyl, and carbonyl), metal ions are likely to get deposited on the CF surface by replacing the H+ of oxygen functional groups as a result of cation exchange. During the electrochemical process, these metal ions get electrodeposited as particles at the corresponding potentials.44 In the same way, Sn2+ ions may be electrodeposited on the surface of the CF utilizing the favorable potential conditions during the VRFB operation and possibly bind with the oxygen sites on the CF surface. The Sn2+/Sn electrodeposition/dissolution is a reversible or quasi-reversible reaction with two electron transfer.45 Thus, during the VRFB operation, tin may deposit on the CF during charging and dissolute during discharging. Moreover, it has been recently reported that the anode reduction reaction is the slowest of the four redox reactions of vanadium and during VRFB cycling, the charge transfer resistance at the anode increases considerably.42 Sn2+ ions are found to lower both the overpotential and charge transfer resistance of the V3+/V2+ reduction reaction in particular. Therefore, the electrolytes containing small quantities of tin ions, especially Sn2+ in the anolyte, remarkably enhance the VRFB performance by improving the reaction kinetics and accelerating the electron transfer process of the anode redox couple in particular, through in situ electrodeposition and dissolution. As a result, electrolyte utilization is increased at higher current densities, thus enabling charge/discharge processes at faster rates. This faster kinetics at high current densities is inevitable for the promotion of VRFB technology. Therefore, tin can be an efficient and cost-effective catalyst not only for VRFB technology but also for other redox systems (Fe/V and V/Ce)46,47 having V2+/V3+ as one of the redox couple.
4 Conclusions
Electrolytes with small quantities of tin ions are employed for VRFBs. Varying concentrations of Sn2+ show the highest performance with an optimal concentration of 0.01 M. The presence of Sn2+ ions in either the catholyte or anolyte helps improve the VRFB performance, playing a more appreciable role in the anolyte by improving the redox kinetics of anode half reactions. Speciation tests also suggest usefulness of Sn2+ ions rather than Sn4+ ions as an electrolyte additive in terms of improvement in performance. Electrochemical evaluation of tin-containing electrolytes proves the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Sn2+ as an electrolyte additive which plays a catalytic role through in situ electrodeposition and dissolution during the charge/discharge process of the VRFB, particularly in the anolyte. Not only the energy efficiency, voltage efficiency, discharge capacity, discharge energy density and fuel utilization are increased significantly, but also the capacity retention is improved. The EE attained at a current density of 50 mA cm−2, in the presence of Sn2+ ions, is 89.3%. More remarkable improvement is obtained at higher current densities: for example, at a current density of 150 mA cm−2, the energy efficiency, specific discharge capacity and discharge energy density are improved by 3.7, 26.2 and 32.0%, respectively, as compared to the pristine electrolyte. More pronounced effects at higher current densities along with the convenience in the application of tin ions will help boost the commercialization of VRFBs in fulfilling energy requirements by enabling charge/discharge processes at faster rates. Therefore, electrodeposited tin from Sn2+ ions as the electrolyte additive can be a promising and cost-effective electrocatalyst for VRFB technology. Tin as the catalyst can also be a promising candidate for other redox flow systems in which V2+/V3+ is one of the redox couple. In addition to this, this in situ electrodeposition of tin can also be utilized for other electrocatalytic applications where the potential conditions favor the in situ deposition during operation.
