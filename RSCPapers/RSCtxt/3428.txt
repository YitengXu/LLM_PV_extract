    , Accepted 22nd September 2022First published on 23rd September 2022AbstractRecently, CuS has attracted intensive attention as an anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of decent theoretical capacity based on the conversion reaction mechanism. Nevertheless, rapid capacity degradation and inferior rate performance significantly deteriorate its further application. Herein, an in situ growth strategy has been proposed to integrate CuS with highly conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene (Tx = –O and –Cl) through Lewis acidic molten salt etching followed by the vulcanization treatment. By virtue of the boosted Na+ diffusion and electronic transport kinetics, superior mechanical strain relief channel and robust interfacial covalent bonding, the as-prepared Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode exhibits improved cyclic performance (347.0 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles at 3 A g−1) and excellent rate capability (346.3 mA h g−1 at 8 A g−1). Furthermore, the assembled full cell by pairing the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates excellent cyclability up to 800 cycles. More importantly, the density functional theory calculations further reveal the origin of the promoted electrochemical performance of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS composites. The presented strategy realizes the rational application of the Lewis acidic etching products and opens up a new door for the preparation of MXene/transition metal compounds hybrids as advanced SIB anodes.
1. Introduction
Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power play a vital role in achieving carbon neutrality and building a low-carbon society.1–3 However, the efficient utilization of renewable energy has been greatly hindered by its intermittency and instability.4,5 Therefore, large-scale electrochemical energy storage devices have aroused intensive interests in the past few years.6,7 Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) stand out among various rechargeable battery systems due to the abundant sodium resources, suitable redox potential (−2.71 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), and appealing cost-effectiveness.8–10 Unfortunately, graphite, a common anode for lithium-ion batteries, is unable to serve as the SIB anode because of the lack of thermodynamically stable intercalation compounds.11 Generally, the large Na+ ionic radius (1.02 Å) results in sluggish reaction and diffusion kinetics as well as large mechanical strain during the repeated Na+ uptake process.4,12,13 Therefore, the exploitation of satisfactory anode materials for SIBs is challenging and crucial. Recently, metal sulfides, especially CuS, has drawn considerable attention as an SIB anode because of its high theoretical capacity, low cost, safe sodiation/desodiation potential, and excellent thermal stability.14,15 However, the CuS anode suffers from electrode pulverization and inadequate charge/mass transfer kinetics during the long-term cycling process,16,17 leading to the deterioration of cyclic stability and high-rate capability. Undoubtedly, considerable efforts are still required to enhance the sodium storage performance of the CuS anode.
Currently, various effective methods have been adopted to tackle the intrinsic drawbacks of the CuS anode. On the one hand, the unique CuS nanostructure with diverse morphologies has been successfully prepared, including nanowires, nanotubes, and nanospheres.18–20 The attractive nanostructures can guarantee accessibility for the electrolyte, expose abundant storage sites, and shorten the Na+ diffusion distance, contributing to the boosted Na+ storage capacity.21 On the other hand, coupling CuS with conductive carbon substrates appears to be a more feasible approach, which can endow the hybrid architecture with a conductive highway and improved electrode stability.22 However, the nonpolar characteristic of the traditional carbon matrix generally fails to form interfacial covalent bonding with CuS,23 possibly leading to weak anchoring on CuS and sluggish interfacial charge transfer during the repetitive sodiation/desodiation process,24 which are responsible for inferior long-term sodium storage performance.
Fortunately, a new and large family of two-dimensional materials, namely MXenes, were first synthesized by the HF etching of the MAX precursor in 2011 and have been a rising star in the field of energy storage, as favored by their large interlayer spacing, abundant chemical composition, wonderful electrical conductivity, superb strain buffer capability, and ultralow diffusion barrier for alkali ions.25–28 In particular, MXene are usually terminated by –O, –OH, –F, –Cl, and –S surface groups and various terminations would endow MXene with new and outstanding properties such as polar surface and superconductivity.29–32 Therefore, based on the merits of MXene, it can be inferred that integrating CuS with MXene is beneficial for rapid charge transfer, Na+ ion migration, and structural robustness. Regrettably, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report concentrating on the design of MXene/CuS hybrids as the anode for SIBs. Moreover, it is worth noting that the traditional synthesis of MXene/metal sulfides composites requires complicated steps, usually containing the synthesis of MXene, following the introduction of the metal source to the MXene suspension, and subsequent post-processing.12,33–36 In addition, the harsh preparation route including hydrothermal environment and the use of hydrofluoric acid etchant account for the notorious oxidation of MXene and increased experimental hazards.37,38 Consequently, a simple, facile, and safe synthetic strategy for MXene/CuS hybrids is highly desirable. Coincidentally and luckily, metal particles can be in situ grown among the MXene matrix in one step through Lewis acidic molten salts (e.g., CuCl2 and CuBr2) etching method proposed by Prof. Huang's group,39,40 which at least demands two steps to complete using conventional methods. Nevertheless, the rational application of metal-modified MXene obtained by Lewis acidic etching approach has rarely been investigated until now.
Herein, in light of the above considerations, we present a simple and facile strategy to prepare the Ti3C2Tx MXene/CuS architecture (Tx = –O and –Cl) as the SIBs anode via the direct sulfurization of Ti3C2Tx/Cu hybrids, which were obtained by the CuCl2·2H2O etching of the Ti3AlC2 precursor. Among the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids, CuS nanoparticles were in situ grown and tightly anchored among the Ti3C2Tx substrate through Ti–O–Cu interfacial covalent bonding. Compared with traditional preparation methods, this strategy shortens the fabrication steps of the MXene/CuS hybrids and remarkably enhances the safety of the experimental process. Owing to the firm anchoring effect of Ti3C2Tx MXene on CuS and the improved charge/mass transfer kinetics, the obtained Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode manifests promoted long-term cyclic stability (347.0 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles at 3 A g−1) and outstanding rate performance (346.3 mA h g−1 at 8 A g−1). The constructed full-cell device based on the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode and the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode also shows a long cycle life. Moreover, theoretical calculations further indicate the improved electronic conductivity and sodium adsorption capability of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids. This work provides a new insight into the development of the Lewis acidic molten salt etching approach and may give inspiration to more researchers.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of Ti3C2Tx/CuS and Nb2CTx/CuS hybrids
The Ti3C2Tx/CuS and Nb2CTx/CuS composites were prepared by the same procedure. We take Ti3C2Tx/CuS as an example. Firstly, 1 g Ti3AlC2 (Forsman
Scientific (Beijing) Co., Ltd.), 2.66 g CuCl2·2H2O, 0.6 g NaCl, and 0.76 g KCl in a molar ratio of 1:3:2:2 were ground and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was then transferred to a crucible boat and heated to 750 °C for 20 h at a rate of 5 °C min−1 under argon atmosphere in a tube furnace. The resultants were rinsed with distilled water to eliminate the residual CuCl2·2H2O, NaCl, and KCl. The Ti3C2Tx/Cu composites can be readily acquired by vacuum-drying at 75 °C overnight. Finally, thiourea (CH4N2S) and Ti3C2Tx/Cu powders were placed in two crucibles and thiourea powder was located upstream of the quartz tube. The mass ratio of thiourea and Ti3C2Tx/Cu was set to 10:1. They were heated to 350 °C for 3 h at a rate of 2 °C min−1 under argon atmosphere to obtain the Ti3C2Tx/CuS composites. The Nb2CTx/CuS was prepared by the same route, except that Ti3AlC2 was replaced by Nb2AlC.
2.2 Synthesis of the Ti3C2Tx MXene
The ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) solution was used to eliminate Cu from the Ti3C2Tx/Cu hybrids to prepare Ti3C2Tx MXene. The resulting solution was further rinsed six times with distilled water. Finally, the Ti3C2Tx powders were obtained after drying under vacuum at 75 °C for 12 h.
2.3 Materials characterization
The crystal structures of the products were characterized by a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, SU-8010) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Ltd, Tecnai F20). The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the samples were captured by an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer to study the chemical states. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were investigated by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Plus HD88.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
For half cells, the working electrodes were fabricated by mixing the above active materials, Super P, and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in deionized water in a weight ratio of 80:10:10, which was then coated on Cu foil and vacuum-dried at 70 °C for 15 h. The average mass loading of the active material in the electrode was about 0.98 mg cm−2. Sodium foil served as the counter and reference electrode and the Whatman glass fiber (GF/D) was used as the separator. The electrolyte was 1 M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) dissolved in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME). The electrolyte/electrode ratio is approximately 3.9 μL mg−1. The galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) profiles of the assembled cells were carried out on a Land battery testing system in a potential range of 0.01–3 V versus Na+/Na. The GITT curves were conducted at 50 mA g−1 for 20 min followed, by 120 min of relaxation time. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves were collected using the Solartron 1470E electrochemical workstation. Specifically, CV measurements were conducted in a voltage range from 0.01 to 3 V (vs. Na+/Na) and EIS was performed in the frequency range from 106 to 10−2 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. For full cells, the Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode slurry was prepared by homogeneously mixing NVP powders, Super P, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 80:10:10 in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and cast onto Al foil. The mass ratio of the cathode and anode was controlled at about 4:1 and the full cell was measured between 0.3 and 3.3 V.
2.5 Calculation methods
First-principles calculations were carried out by density functional theory (DFT) calculations implemented in the Quantum Espresso, with the plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 500 eV, projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials, and the generalized gradient approximation parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) for exchange-correlation functional as well as Grimme's semiempirical DFT-D3 scheme for the dispersion correction. The supercell of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids consists of  unit cells for CuS (001) and  unit cells for the Ti3C2Tx MXene, with lattice mismatch below 0.1%. The surface of the Ti3C2 MXene is terminated by O and Cl atoms. A vacuum region of 16 Å was applied in the vertical direction. With a fixed lattice constant, the model structures were fully optimized for the ionic and electronic degrees of freedom using the convergence criteria of 10−4 eV for electronic energy and 10−2 eV Å−1 for the forces on each atom. The Brillouin zones of the supercells were sampled by the 3 × 3 × 1 uniform k point.
3. Results and discussion
As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the Ti3AlC2 MAX precursor is fully mixed with CuCl2·2H2O at 750 °C in Ar atmosphere. Then, Al atoms in Ti3AlC2 precursor were readily transformed into Al3+ cations by the oxidant Cu2+. The Al3+ cations can combine with Cl− anions to form AlCl3 that can volatilize at 178 °C (eqn (1)). Meanwhile, the Cu2+ cations can be reduced to Cu metal, contributing to the in situ growth of the Cu cluster among the Ti3C2Tx MXene substrate. The Ti3C2 MXene is prone to be decorated with –Cl and –O terminations during the above process (eqn (2)–(4)).40 Subsequently, the Ti3C2Tx/CuS architecture is obtained via the direct sulfurization of the Ti3C2Tx/Cu hybrids with the assistance of thiourea (CH4N2S) at 350 °C under argon atmosphere.12 Accordingly, the in situ generated CuS can be homogeneously anchored among the Ti3C2Tx MXene matrix. 2 Ti3AlC2 + 3 CuCl2 → 2 Ti3C2 + 2 AlCl3 ↑ + 3 Cu(1) Ti3C2 + CuCl2 → Ti3C2Cl2 + Cu(2) Ti3C2 + 2H2O → Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2(3) Ti3C2(OH)2 → Ti3C2O2 + H2(4)

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the related products are exhibited in Fig. 2a and b. It can be observed that the (002) and (004) peaks of Ti3AlC2 still exist after CuCl2·2H2O molten salt etching, while the (104) diffraction peak at 39.0°·vanishes. Simultaneously, the (002) peak moves from 9.58° to 7.90°, revealing an increased interlayer distance from 0.92 to 1.12 nm. Moreover, the three sharp peaks situated at 43.3°, 50.6°, and 74.5° belong to Cu metal (Fig. 2a). The above results effectively demonstrate the successful etching of the Ti3AlC2 precursor by CuCl2·2H2O molten salt.41,42 After the vulcanization process of Ti3C2Tx/Cu, the characteristic (002) and (004) peaks of Ti3C2Tx MXene can be clearly distinguished, and other peaks located at 10.9°, 27.8°, 29.4°, 31.9°, 33.0°, 47.9°, 52.8°, and 59.5° are well indexed to CuS (PDF no. 06-0464) (Fig. 2b), proving the successful synthesis of Ti3C2Tx/CuS and the feasibility of the proposed strategy. In addition, the metallic Cu clusters in Ti3C2Tx/Cu can be removed by ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) solution to prepare pure Ti3C2Tx MXene, which can be confirmed by the disappearance of high-intensity peaks of the Cu metal (Fig. 2a). N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were employed to investigate the specific surface area and pore size distribution. As shown in Fig. 2c, the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids deliver a specific surface area of 39.2 m2 g−1 and the pore sizes are mainly centered at 5.56 nm. The relatively high surface area and mesoporous architecture of Ti3C2Tx/CuS are beneficial for electrolyte permeation and rapid Na+ migration, which contribute to boosted sodium storage performance.42–44 Furthermore, the content of CuS in the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids is calculated to be 70.4% (Table S1 and S2†).

The elemental composition and valence state of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ti 2p spectra in Fig. 2d demonstrates four doublets with Ti 2p1/2 situated at about 461.1, 462.0, 464.1, and 465.2 eV, corresponding to the Ti–C(I), Ti–C(II), Ti–Cl, and Ti–O bond, respectively.40 The existence of the Ti–Cl bond can also be confirmed by the 2p1/2 peak situated at 200.9 eV in the high-resolution Cl 2p spectra (Fig. 2e).45 The C 1s spectra can be deconvoluted into four peaks centered at 282.3, 284.8, 285.9, and 288.5 eV, which can be assigned to the Ti–C, C–C, C–O, and O–CO bond, respectively (Fig. 2f).46Fig. 2g exhibits the high-resolution Cu 2p spectra; the two strong peaks located at 932.3 and 952.2 eV belongs to the Cu–S bond, while the other two peaks at 933.7 and 953.6 eV are assigned to the Cu–O bond.47 As depicted in Fig. 2h, the two peaks in the S 2p spectra centered at 162.2 and 163.3 eV are indexed to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of S2−.48 Finally, the O 1s spectra can be fitted with four main peaks at 530.3, 531.4, 532.4, and 533.4 eV, which are related to Ti–O, C–Ti–Ox, Ti–O–Cu, and H2O, respectively (Fig. 2i).40 Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that Ti3C2Tx/CuS is successfully prepared and the Ti3C2 MXene is terminated with –Cl and –O surface groups. It is noteworthy that the emergence of the Ti–O–Cu chemical bond is derived from the in situ growth of CuS among the Ti3C2Tx MXene substrate. The interfacial electronic interaction between Ti3C2Tx and CuS enabled by Ti–O–Cu covalent bonding can firmly anchor CuS on the Ti3C2Tx MXene, accommodate the volume expansion of CuS upon cycling, and promote the interfacial charge transfer, accordingly leading to the greatly improved electrochemical performance.24,33,35,43
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Ti3AlC2 MAX in Fig. 3a and S1† demonstrate an obvious densely-packed architecture. After etching by CuCl2·2H2O molten salt, abundant Cu metal clusters were in situ grown among the Ti3C2Tx MXene matrix (Fig. 3b and S2†). Subsequently, the Cu cluster can be transformed into CuS nanoparticles via the sulfurization process to generate Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids (Fig. 3c and S3†). In addition, Cu clusters can be eliminated by immersing Ti3C2Tx/Cu in ammonium persulfate solution to prepare Ti3C2Tx MXene, which displays a classical multi-layered structure (Fig. 3d). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of Ti3C2Tx MXene further manifests its layered conformation (Fig. 3e). The homogeneous distribution of CuS nanoparticles on the Ti3C2Tx matrix can be verified by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Ti3C2Tx/CuS exhibited in Fig. 3f. Moreover, the formed heterointerface between the Ti3C2Tx MXene (002) crystal plane and the CuS (103) plane in Fig. 3g confirm the successful fabrication of Ti3C2Tx/CuS, which is beneficial for electron transfer and Na+ migration near the interface.33 Similarly, the HRTEM image in Fig. S4† also reveals the integration between Ti3C2Tx MXene and CuS. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 3h again suggests the crystalline state of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids. Finally, the uniform dispersion of Ti, O, Cl, Cu, and S elements throughout the entire Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids can be clearly observed in the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. 3i).

Coin-type half cells were first constructed to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared Ti3C2Tx/CuS composites. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode at 0.1 mV s−1 are exhibited in Fig. 4a. In the initial cathodic scan, three reduction peaks at 1.17, 0.83, and 0.36 V reflect the generation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and multistep sodiation process of CuS to form Cu and Na2S. During the anodic scan, three major peaks located at about 1.60, 1.93 m and 2.13 V correspond to the Na+ extraction process from Na2S.14,49 There are several main peaks at about 1.58, 1.14, 0.82, and 0.40 V in the second cathodic scan as well as three major peaks at 1.68, 1.85, and 2.11 V in the subsequent anodic scan. The shift in the redox peak is mainly due to electrode activation.14 In addition, a pair of weak peaks at 0.03/0.08 V can be assigned to the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process among the Ti3C2Tx MXene. It is noteworthy that a typical capacitive-shaped CV curves can be observed for the Ti3C2Tx MXene (Fig. S5a†), thus leading to extremely improved Na+ diffusion kinetics of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids.50 The corresponding galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS electrode at 50 mA g−1 are displayed in Fig. 4b. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode are 533.7 and 456.4 mA h g−1, respectively, manifesting a high initial coulombic efficiency of 85.5%. The plateaus in the GCD profiles are in good agreement with the main redox peaks in the CV curves. Meanwhile, the Ti3C2Tx MXene displays oblique GCD curves and suggests a capacitive reaction (Fig. S5b†), which is also consistent with its CV curves.

The cyclic performance of the Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx/CuS electrode was first investigated at 500 mA g−1 (Fig. 4c). It can be observed that the Ti3C2Tx MXene delivers a specific capacity of 99.2 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. In contrast, the Ti3C2Tx/CuS electrode exhibits a discharge capacity of 397.5 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles and the coulombic efficiency almost reaches 100%. Furthermore, the rate performance of the above two electrodes at various current densities is revealed in Fig. 4d and e. The Ti3C2Tx MXene and Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode possess a discharge capacity of 345.6, 173.8, 149.7, 128.0, 105.3, 88.0, 69.3, 57.6 mA h g−1 and 530.1, 440.3, 425.1, 413.2, 394.8, 373.4, 346.5, 346.3 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 8 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, the specific capacity of theTi3C2Tx/CuS electrode can return to 420.5 mA h g−1 when the current rate recovers to 0.5 A g−1, manifesting outstanding structural integrity under a large current density. The excellent rate capability of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS electrode is superior to that of the reported copper sulfide-based SIBs anodes (Fig. 4f).17,48,51–57 To investigate the origin of the superb rate performance of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed from 106 to 10−2 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV (Fig. 4g and S6†). It can be observed that the Nyquist plot of Ti3C2Tx/CuS is composed of a semicircle and a sloped line, which corresponds to charge transfer resistance (Rct) and Warburg resistance, respectively.50,58 In addition, the real axis intercept is the electrolyte resistance (Re).44 It is worth mentioning that the SEI film generally leads to the formation of a semicircle in the high-frequency region of the Nyquist plot, but it fails to emerge for the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode after cycling. This phenomenon can be attributed to the formation of a thin and compact SEI film in ether electrolyte with high reductive stability, which is conducive to the rapid diffusion of Na+ ions in the SEI film.5 The Ti3C2Tx anode shows a Rct value of 5.88 Ω before cycling owing to its superior electronic conductivity (Fig. S6a†). Furthermore, the Ti3C2Tx/CuS electrode possesses a low Re value of 3.46 Ω and Rct value of 1.23 Ω after 10 cycles according to the fitting results (Fig. 4g and Table S3†). Moreover, the Re and Rct value gradually decreases upon cycling. The ultralow Rct value of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode can be mainly attributed to the rapid interfacial electron transfer enabled by the formation of Ti–O–Cu covalent bonding between CuS and highly conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene.24
Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was applied to investigate the Na+ diffusion kinetics of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS electrode (Fig. 4h and S7†). It can be seen that the Na+ diffusion coefficient (DNa) of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode can be improved to the order of 10−11–10−13 cm2 s−1 owing to the introduction of Ti3C2Tx MXene, which manifests a high DNa of about 10−8–10−10 cm2 s−1 based on previous works.59,60 Furthermore, the electrochemical charge storage mechanism can be analyzed by the CV curves at various scan rates (Fig. S8a†). The relationship between the peak current (i) and scan rate (v) can be determined by eqn (5). log(i) = blog(v) + log(a)(5)
Generally, b = 0.5 suggests a diffusion-controlled process, while b = 1 stands for a capacitive-controlled process.7 For the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode, the b values of peak 1, peak 2, and peak 3 are 0.88, 0.73, and 0.78 (Fig. S8b†), respectively, which represents that the Na+ storage mechanism is composed of diffusion-controlled and capacitive-controlled process. The capacity contribution of the capacitive-controlled process can be calculated by eqn (6). i(v) = k1v + k2v1/2(6)k1v indicates capacitive contribution and k2v1/2 stands for diffusion-controlled contribution.12 As exhibited in Fig. S8c and d,† the capacitive contribution continuously increases with the rise of the sweep rate and can reach 92.4% at 0.5 mV s−1. Such a high capacitive contribution is conducive to fast Na+ adsorption/desorption kinetics. In summary, the Ti3C2Tx/CuS electrode possesses extremely low Rct values and enhanced Na+ migration kinetics, accordingly contributing to the superior rate performance.
Finally, the long-term cycling performance of the Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx/CuS electrode was measured at 3 A g−1 (Fig. 4j). The Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode delivers a discharge capacity of 347.0 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles, which is much higher than that of Ti3C2Tx MXene. Meanwhile, the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode also demonstrates high and stable coulombic efficiency of about 100% except for the initial cycles. In comparison with reported copper sulfide-based anodes for SIBs, the obtained Ti3C2Tx/CuS electrode exhibits boosted long-term cyclic performance (Fig. 4i),17,48,51–55 which is mainly due to the anchoring effect of the Ti3C2Tx MXene on CuS enabled by the formation of Ti–O–Cu covalent bonding, thus effectively confirming the feasibility of the proposed strategy.24
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to further gain insight into the mechanism of superior Na+ storage performance of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode. The total density of states (TDOS) in Fig. 5a reveals that the electron states of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS composites near the Fermi level greatly increase compared with that of CuS, suggesting remarkably improved electronic conductivity. Furthermore, the adsorption behaviors of Na on CuS and Ti3C2Tx/CuS were investigated (Fig. 5b and c and S9†). The results indicate that the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids possess a lower adsorption energy relative to CuS. The strong sodium adsorption ability of Ti3C2Tx/CuS is beneficial for the promoted Na+ storage capacity. Based on the results of a series of characterizations and DFT calculations, the excellent Na-ion storage performance of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids can be ascribed to the following aspects (Fig. 5d). (1) Among the composites, the presence of the Ti3C2Tx MXene can provide a conductive highway for electron transfer and Na+ migration during the repeated sodiation/desodiation process, leading to boosted electrochemical reaction kinetics. (2) The Ti3C2Tx MXene with superior mechanical flexibility can considerably accommodate the volume variation of CuS nanoparticles upon cycling, accordingly preventing electrode pulverization and leading to the superior cyclic stability. (3) CuS nanoparticles are in situ grown and anchored among the Ti3C2Tx MXene substrate via Ti–O–Cu covalent bonding, which can greatly promote interfacial electron transfer from Ti3C2Tx MXene to CuS, further accelerating the charge/mass transfer kinetics of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids. Moreover, interfacial electronic interaction between Ti3C2Tx MXene and CuS can firmly immobilize CuS among the Ti3C2Tx matrix, further enhancing the long-term cyclic stability. (4) The fabrication of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids is conducive to the adsorption of Na+ ions, thus contributing to the increased sodium storage capacity.

To further analyze the possible application of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode, we constructed the SIBs full-cell device using Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as the cathode (Fig. 6a). The morphology and phase composition of the NVP powders are shown in Fig. S10.† We first measure the GCD profiles and cyclic performance of the NVP cathode, which exhibits a discharge plateau of 3.35 V and a specific capacity of 92.2 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles (Fig. S11†). As demonstrated in Fig. 6b, the full cell releases a specific capacity of 257.9 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, the tightly overlapping GCD curves of the full cell demonstrate high electrochemical reversibility. Fig. 6c suggests that a light-emitting diode (LED) panel can be successfully powered by the assembled full-cell system. Subsequently, the long-term cyclic performance of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS//NVP full cell at a large current rate of 2 A g−1 is presented in Fig. 6d. It can be observed that the full cell possesses an initial coulombic efficiency of 69.3% and retains a capacity of 189.6 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles, displaying excellent cyclic stability. The above results further prove the potential application prospect of the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Finally, in order to confirm the universality of the presented strategy, Nb2CTx MXene/CuS hybrids were prepared using Nb2AlC MAX as the precursor. As exhibited in Fig. S12a,† the diffraction peaks of the Cu metal occur, and the peak for Nb2AlC at 38.9° disappears after CuCl2·2H2O molten salt etching process. In addition, the (002) peak shifts from 12.9° to 10.2°, revealing an increased interlayer spacing from 0.69 to 0.87 nm. The results suggest the successful etching of Nb2AlC MAX and the preparation of Nb2CTx/Cu hybrids. After vulcanization treatment, the emerging peaks can be attributed to CuS (PDF No. 06-0464), proving the construction of Nb2CTx/CuS (Fig. S12b†). The SEM images of the Nb2CTx/Cu and Nb2CTx/CuS composites indicate that Cu and CuS nanoparticles are immobilized among the Nb2CTx MXene substrate, respectively (Fig. S12c and d†). When tested as the SIB anode, the Nb2CTx/CuS hybrids exhibit improved cyclic stability and rate performance (Fig. S13†), which can be attributed to the excellent electronic/Na+ transfer/diffusion kinetics and rapid mechanical strain relief capability. The above discussions strongly demonstrate the generality of the proposed strategy.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a simple and facile strategy for the in situ fabrication of Ti3C2Tx/CuS architecture for high-performance SIBs. It is noteworthy that the proposed strategy achieves the rational application of Lewis acidic etching products, prevents MXenes from being oxidized, shortens the preparation steps, and greatly reduces the risk of the experimental process. The CuS nanoparticles are in situ grown and tightly anchored among the Ti3C2Tx MXene substrate via the Ti–O–Cu covalent bond. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between highly conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene and CuS, the intelligently designed Ti3C2Tx/CuS hybrids can be endowed with greatly improved charge/mass transfer kinetics and superior structural integrity, consequently leading to boosted sodium storage performance. Specifically, the Ti3C2Tx/CuS anode exhibits excellent long-term cyclic stability (347.0 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles at 3 A g−1) and exceptional rate capability (346.3 mA h g−1 at 8 A g−1). In addition, an ultralow Rct value of above 1.23 Ω can be confirmed by the EIS test, and the DFT calculations further reveal the improved electronic conductivity and strong Na adsorption ability for the Ti3C2Tx/CuS composites. As expected, the assembled full cell also demonstrates extraordinary cyclic performance. Overall, we hope that this work could offer a new perspective for the fabrication of MXene/transition metal compound composites via Lewis acidic molten salts etching route for advanced rechargeable batteries.
