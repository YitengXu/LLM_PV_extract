    , Accepted 7th July 2019First published on 13th August 2019AbstractSolution methods have been widely explored in chalcogenide photovoltaics because of their simple processes and low cost. Currently, the solvents used in many solution processes are toxic and have low solubility for metal chalcogenides, such as hydrazine and diamine–dithiol solvents; this limits their development and large-scale applications. Butyldithiocarbamate acid (BDCA), a relatively environmentally friendly solvent compared with commonly used hydrazine and diamine–dithiol solvents, can dissolve various metal oxides and metal hydroxides; this, it is promising for the deposition of metal chalcogenide films. In this review, we introduce the fundamental chemical properties of BDCA in detail and summarize the application of the BDCA solution method in high-efficient and low-cost photovoltaics, including Sb2S3, Sb2S3−xSex, CuSbS2, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 thin film solar cells. We hope this review will stimulate more researchers to explore more metal chalcogenides and use them in different fields, such as photocatalysis and photodetectors.

1. Introduction
Compound thin film solar cells have been an active topic in solar cells in the past decades due to their advantages of high material utilization rate, low fabrication cost and flexible devices. Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) and CdTe solar cells are the most successful thin film solar cells, with record power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 23.35%1 and 22.1%,2 respectively. At present, highly efficient CdTe and CIGSSe solar cells are commonly fabricated by vacuum-based methods, such as thermal evaporation (TE, CdTe 15.2%; CIGSSe 22.6),3,4 magnetron sputtering (MS, CdTe 14%; CIGSSe 23.35%),1,5 and vapor transport deposition (VTD, CdTe 22.1%).2 However, the controllability of film deposition (e.g. thickness, uniformity, composition) relies on high-precision and high-cost equipment as well as high vacuum conditions; this may impede the commercialized development of these solar cells. Therefore, it is significant to find a simple and low-cost non-vacuum method for highly efficient thin film solar cell fabrication.
Solution methods are a potential alternative because of their advantages of low cost and industrial production. Common solution methods mainly include electrodeposition (ETD),6–12 spray pyrolysis (SPL),13–16 chemical bath deposition (CBD)17–22 and spin-coating. Spin-coating, one of the least expensive film deposition techniques, is widely used in solution-processed thin film photovoltaics, such as metal-halide perovskite (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3 and CsPbI3),23–26 CIGSSe27–29 and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe).30–32 The spin-coating method mainly consists of two steps: firstly, the elemental metal or its compounds are dissolved in a specific solvent to form a stable precursor solution;33 secondly, the thin film is deposited by spin-coating and thermal annealing processes.33 In view of this, the elemental constituents and phases of the films are easily tuned for the spin-coating method. As a successful representative, the hydrazine (N2H4) solution spin-coating method exhibits great ability to deposit high quality metal chalcogenide (MC) semiconductor thin films, such as SnS,34 Sb2S3,35 Sb2Se3,35 Sb2S3−xSex,35 CIGSSe36 and CZTSSe.37,38 Particularly, a CZTSSe thin film solar cell fabricated by the hydrazine solution spin-coating process has achieved the highest certified efficiency of 12.6% to date.38 In addition to hydrazine solution, a novel binary solvent, amine–thiol, has active chemical properties.39 Brutchey et al. demonstrated that a series of V2VI3 chalcogenides and metal oxides could be easily dissolved in diamine–dithiol solvent,39–41 enabling the deposition chalcogenide films by a spin-coating process. A low temperature CIGSSe deposition method based on a 1:10 vol/vol mixture of chelating 1,2-ethylenediamine (EN) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) solution was developed utilizing Cu2Se, In(OAc)3, Ga(acac)3 and Se precursors, which resulted in a thin-film solar cell PCE of 12.2%.42 Similarly, CZTSSe thin film deposition based on a hexylamine (HA)–propanethiol (PT) solution process was developed utilizing copper, zinc, and tin chloride precursors, which resulted in 7.86% efficiency of cells. Therefore, the hydrazine and amine–thiol solution methods are suitable for fabricating various MC thin film solar cells. However, hydrazine is highly toxic and explosive, and mercaptan solvent is extremely volatile and has a strong, pungent odor; this limits the experimental location to a glovebox, which is unsuitable for mass production. Therefore, it is valuable to develop a spin-coating process using environmentally friendly solvents for highly efficient thin film solar cell fabrication.
Butyldithiocarbamic acid (BDCA) solution has the characteristics of relatively low toxicity and low cost; it has emerged in recent years as a precursor solvent for the spin-coating process.43,44 BDCA is a mercapto acid fabricated by the chemical reaction between carbon disulfide (CS2) and n-butylamine (CH3(CH2)3NH2).43–47 BDCA solution can rapidly dissolve a series of metal oxides (MyOx) and metal hydroxides (M(OH)x), enabling the formation of a sulfur-based organometallic complex precursor solution.43–47 After the spin-coating and thermal annealing processes, a polycrystalline MC thin film is obtained. Based on this technique, CIGSSe and CZTSSe achieved device efficiencies of 8.8% and 6.03%, respectively;46,47 this indicates that the BDCA solution method has enormous potential in thin film solar cell fabrication.
In this review, we summarize the application of the BDCA solution method in MC thin film solar cells, including Sb2S3, Sb2S3−xSex, CuSbS2, CIGSSe, and CZTSSe thin film solar cells. Firstly, we introduce the preparation and the fundamental chemical properties of BDCA solution in detail. Then, we mainly focus on the phase control, elemental composition and crystallinity of MC thin films obtained based on the BDCA solution method. Furthermore, we also analyze the performance of BDCA-based devices and compare them with devices fabricated by other techniques.
2. Formation and chemical properties of BDCA solution
BDCA is the product of the chemical reaction between CS2 and CH3(CH2)3NH2 (Fig. 1a–c).43 During this chemical reaction, one of the CS double bonds in the CS2 molecule breaks (Fig. 1a), leaving a SC–S– free radical. Subsequently, the unsaturated C- and S-bond with the N- and H- of CH3(CH2)3NH2, respectively (Fig. 1b), forming the BDCA molecule (C5H11NS2, Fig. 1c). The BDCA molecule contains one thionothiolic acid group (–CSSH), which can easily ionize to H+ and C5H10NS2− ions after adding a buffer solvent (Fig. 1d) such as ethanol43,45–47 or dimethylformamide (DMF).44 The ionized H+ enables the dissolution of MyOx or M(OH)x, and the products are M(C5H10NS2)x organometallic complex and xH2O (Fig. 1e and f). Therefore, BDCA solvent is a good choice to prepare metal sulfide precursor solutions.43–47 Based on this mechanism, BDCA is also beneficial for the preparation of multi-metal sulfide precursor solutions. In brief, by mixing several single-metal sulfide precursor solutions with different metal mole ratios, we can obtain multi-metal sulfide precursor solutions.45–47 Then, the prepared precursor solution can be transformed into an MC film through spin-coating and thermal annealing processes.

Next, we illuminate the dissolving capacity of MxOy or M(OH)x in BDCA. Several literature studies have reported that many common MxOy or M(OH)x species, such as Cu2O, ZnO, SnO, In(OH)3, Sb2O3, Cd(OH)2, MnO and PbO, can effectively dissolve in BDCA solution (Fig. 2a).46 Notably, elemental selenium (Se) has higher solubility in DMF–diluted BDCA solution than in ethanol–diluted BDCA solution;46 this enables the fabrication of S/Se alloy films via the BDCA method using DMF buffer solvent.44 Herein, we take the dissolution of Sb2O3 in BDCA as an example to further reveal the dissolving process of MyOx or M(OH)x in BDCA solution. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of the product Sb(S2CNHC4H9)3 is shown in Fig. 2b. Compared to the FT-IR spectrum of BDCA, it did not show any new vibration modes, indicating that no new groups formed during the dissolving process. This phenomenon demonstrates that the dissolution of MyOx or M(OH)x in BDCA is a simple metathesis process.43 The MC films are obtained by spin-coating and thermal annealing processes. During the thermal annealing process, H2O and additional S are evaporated from the prefabricated film, and M(S2CNHC4H9)x decomposes to form MC films at the same time. The decomposition mechanism is summarized in reaction eqn (1): M(S2CNHC4H9)x → MSx + x(S2CNHC4H9)(1)

Notably, unlike the hydrazine solution process, the carbon-contained organic solution may result in residue carbon (undecomposed organic molecules) in the prepared MC films.47 The residual carbon can hinder crystal growth during the annealing process and can readily introduce interface defects.47 Therefore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to determine the appropriate temperatures for solvent evaporation and decomposition and film crystallization. Fig. 2c shows the TGA curves of four precursor solutions of Sb2S3,43 CuSbS2,45 Cu(In,Ga)S246 and Cu2ZnSnS4.47 The weight losses of CuSbS2, Cu2(In,Ga)S2 and the Cu2ZnSnS4 precursor were ∼80%, and that of Sb2S3 was ∼20%. The thermal decomposition mechanism of metal butyldithiocarbamates has been extensively investigated in the literature.48,49 For CuSbS2 and CZTS precursor solutions, the TGA curves have almost the same shape and weight loss behavior. The precursor solutions start to decompose near 150 °C, and relatively fast weight loss occurs from about 150 °C to 250 °C. When the temperature is higher than 250 °C, the weight losses become imperceptible, indicating that the decomposition is almost complete. Although 250 °C is a high enough temperature to remove the organic content in CuSbS2 and CZTS precursor solutions, a higher temperature is needed to enhance the grain growth. Notably, the TGA curves still have a slight weight loss beyond 250 °C, which is caused by the sublimation of the as-obtained MC samples.48,49 Therefore, the optimum deposition temperature should be between 250 °C and the melting point. In the deposition process of Sb2S3 and CIGS films, this method was also selected to determine the optimum deposition temperature. For Sb2S3 film, the optimum deposition temperature is between 220 °C and the melting point; for CIGS film, the optimum deposition temperature is between 260 °C and the melting point.
3. Photovoltaic devices fabricated by the BDCA process
Because BDCA can effectively dissolve various MyOx and M(OH)x species, the BDCA solution process can be directly used to deposit compact MC films with high crystallinity. The spin-coating process distributes the precursor solution evenly over the surface of the substrate, and the thermal annealing process converts the precursor solution into the desired MC films. Experimental parameters such as concentration, viscosity and spin speed of the precursor solution can affect the quality and thickness of the MC films. The thermal annealing process can not only decompose the precursor solution, but can also promote crystal growth, improve the crystallinity, and decrease the defect density of the film.
3.1 A Sb2S3 film and device
Firstly, we discuss the fabrication of a binary chalcogenide antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) thin film solar cell using the BDCA solution method. Sb2S3 has a suitable band gap of 1.70 eV, low element toxicity and a high light absorption coefficient in the visible range (∼1.8 × 105 cm−1 at 450 nm).43,50–53 The Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) theory efficiency of a single-junction Sb2S3 solar cell is 28.38%.54 Therefore, Sb2S3 is a promising absorber material for highly efficient thin film solar cells. The preparation process of the Sb2S3–BDCA precursor solution is as follows (Fig. 3): Sb2O3 (1 mmol) is mixed with ethanol (buffer solvent)–diluted CS2 (ethanol:CS2 = 2 mL:1.5 mL); subsequently, CH3(CH2)3NH2 (2 mL) is slowly added dropwise with continuous stirring. Then, after stirring for 2 hours at room temperature, a clear and transparent Sb2S3 precursor solution is obtained.43 Then, the as-obtained Sb2S3 precursor solution is spin-coated on the TiO2-coated FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) substrate at 8000 rpm for 30 s, followed by a thermal annealing process at 300 °C for 2 min to obtain a pure-phase and crystallized Sb2S3 film. Finally, a Sb2S3 thin film solar cell with the configuration of FTO/TiO2/Sb2S3/HTM/Au was obtained after hole transporting material (HTM) and gold (Au) electrode deposition.

The thermal annealing process directly affects the grain growth, crystallinity and film surface roughness of films; it can potentially introduce defects or surface recombination in the films and affect the carrier collection efficiency and device performance of solar cells. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the dependence of annealing temperature and time on the quality of Sb2S3 polycrystalline films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to investigate the crystallization of Sb2S3 films annealed at 200 °C, 220 °C, 250 °C, 280 °C and 300 °C (Fig. 4). The XRD pattern of Sb2S3 annealed at 200 °C only showed the background signal, indicating that the film was amorphous. Diffraction peaks appeared when the annealing temperature was raised to 220 °C, and the peak intensity increased with the annealing temperature; this implies that a high annealing temperature is beneficial for the crystallinity of Sb2S3 films. The diffraction peaks of the films matched well with the standard card of Sb2S3 (JCPDS 42-1393), demonstrating that the Sb2S3 films were pure phase.

Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to characterize the surface morphologies, grain sizes and thicknesses of the Sb2S3 films (Fig. 5). The Sb2S3 films gradually changed from discontinuous particles to a continuous film as the annealing temperature increased from 200 °C to 300 °C (Fig. 5a–c). Especially, the film annealed at 300 °C exhibited ∼12 μm large grains with obvious grain boundaries, in line with the XRD results. The Sb2S3 film annealed at 300 °C was assembled into a Sb2S3 thin film solar cell with the structure of FTO/TiO2/Sb2S3/HTM/Au. The tri-layer structure of TiO2/Sb2S3/HTM was observed in the cross-section SEM image (Fig. 5d). The thickness of the Sb2S3 film layer was about 137 nm.

Finally, the device performance was characterized under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 6). The device exhibited an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 630 mV, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 12.93 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 52.43%, corresponding to a PCE of 4.3%. To evaluate the level of the Sb2S3 device fabricated by BDCA, we summarize the photovoltaic parameters of the Sb2S3 thin film solar cells fabricated by CBD,43,55,56 rapid thermal evaporation (RTE),57 TE58 and atomic layer deposition (ALD)59 in Table 1. It is obvious that the Sb2S3 thin film solar cell fabricated by the BDCA solution method has a medium device efficiency. However, it has a high JSC of 12.93 mA cm−2, which is close to the JSC of the most efficient Sb2S3 thin film solar cell fabricated by the ALD method (14.9 mA cm−2).59 Compared with the conventional CBD method, the higher JSC is attributed to larger crystal grains or fewer grain boundaries.43,59 However, the current Sb2S3 device fabricated by the BDCA solution process has a modest VOC. Therefore, in subsequent work, the VOC can be further improved by optimizing the film deposition process.

3.2 Sb2S3−xSex films and devices
By introducing Se into the abovementioned Sb2S3 BDCA precursor, Sb2S3−xSex alloy films can be obtained using the same solution spin-coating process. Sb2S3−xSex has a continuously tunable band gap from 1.1 to 1.7 eV while x changes from 3 to 0;35,44 thus, it is promising for photovoltaics applications. In this section, we mainly focus on the fabrication and characterization of BDCA-based Sb2S3−xSex films as well as their application in thin film solar cells. As shown in Fig. 7a, the Sb2S3−xSex BDCA precursor solution was obtained in three steps: (i) the BDCA solution was obtained by the reaction between CS2 (1.5 mL) and CH3(CH2)3NH2 (2 mL). (ii) (C5H10NS2Se)− was formed by the displacement reaction between Se and C5H11NS2, while Se powder (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0 mmol) was added to C5H11NS2.44 (iii) Sb2O3 (1 mmol) was added to the solution obtained in step (ii), forming the Sb(C5H10NS2Se)3 precursor after the metathesis reaction process.44 The ratio of Se/Sb in the precursor solution was tuned by changing the molar ratio of the added Se and Sb2O3 (Fig. 7b).

In Section 3.1, we mentioned that BDCA solution, diluted with ethanol, is capable of dissolving a series of MyOx and M(OH)x species (Fig. 7a, reaction (i)). However, this solution system cannot dissolve Se;44 thus, it is impossible to synthesize metal selenides using this solution system. In this section, instead of ethanol, DMF was used as the buffer solvent, and Se was dissolved in the solution system under a new dissolution mechanism.44 To study the new dissolution mechanism, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed. As a control sample, DMF–diluted BDCA solution showed a featureless signal (Fig. 7c, curve c1). After adding Se to the above solution, three peaks with similar heights appeared, and the middle value (g) was calculated as 2.0410 (Fig. 7c, curve c2). The shape of the ESR spectrum was the same as that of (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl (TEMPO), in which O–N radicals are present (Fig. 7c). Only the g value shifted to 2.0048. The g shift was attributed to the smaller electronegativity of Se atom than of O atom, resulting in a larger electron density of N atom in O–N than of that in Se–N. Therefore, the Se–N radical was most likely present (Fig. 7a, reaction (ii)). After adding Sb2O3 to the above solution, the shapes and positions of the peaks in the ESR spectrum (Fig. 7c, c3) remained unchanged compared to Se-containing BDCA solution (Fig. 7c, curve c2), suggesting that the molecular skeleton was retained (Fig. 7a, reaction (iii)). The prepared precursor solutions containing both S and Se were used to fabricate Sb2(S3−xSex) films (Fig. 7a, reaction (iv) and d).
The appropriate annealing temperature was extracted from TGA of the Sb2S3−xSex precursor (Fig. 8a). The TGA curves of the selenium-containing and selenium-free precursor solutions have similar shapes. The first significant weight loss appeared at about 100 °C, corresponding to the evaporation of the remaining solvent in the precursor. The second-stage weight loss occurred at 200 °C, which can be assigned to the decomposition of Sb(C5H10NS2Se)3. Then, the weight tended to remain unchanged from 200 °C to 550 °C, indicating the formation of Sb2S3−xSex phase. In addition, a slight weight loss in the temperature range of 550 °C to 600 °C was attributed to the sublimation of Sb2S3 and Sb2S3−xSex.44 Meanwhile, the weight loss of the selenium-free precursor solution was more pronounced because of the different melting points of Sb2S3 (500 °C)43 and Sb2Se3 (608 °C).35 Therefore, taking the film deposition and grain growth into account, the optimal annealing temperature was in the range of 200 °C to 500 °C.

(b) XRD patterns of the Sb2S3−xSex films fabricated at different temperatures: 220 °C with the mole ratio of Se/Sb = 1:2 in the precursor solution (bottom line), and the Sb2S3−xSex films pre-annealed at 220 °C for 2 min and 320 °C for 5 min with Se/Sb ratios of 0 (no. 1), 1:8 (no. 2), 1:4 (no. 3), 1:2 (no. 4), and 1:1 (no. 5) in the precursor solutions.

The Sb2S3−xSex precursor solution was spin-coated on the FTO/TiO2 substrate and pre-annealed at a temperature range of 200 °C to 220 °C for 1 to 2 min.44 Subsequently, the as-prepared Sb2S3−xSex film was annealed at 320 °C for 5 min to promote film crystallization. Fig. 8b shows the XRD patterns of Sb2S3−xSex films deposited with mole ratios of Se to Sb of 0, 1:8, 1:4, 1:2 and 1:1 in the precursor solutions. No secondary phases were observed in the films, and the XRD peaks significantly shifted toward lower angles compared to Sb2S3, reflecting that Se atoms entered the lattice. The S/Se mole ratios in the Sb2S3−xSex films were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The chemical formulas of the films deposited with Se/Sb mole ratios of 0, 1:8, 1:4, 1:2 and 1:1 in the precursor solutions were Sb2S3, Sb2S2.7Se0.25, Sb2S2.5Se0.5, Sb1.9S2.2Se0.9 and Sb1.95S1.8Se1.25, respectively, demonstrating that the S/Se mole ratio in Sb2S3−xSex films can been efficiently tuned by adjusting the Se/Sb mole ratio in the precursor solution (Table 2).

The band gaps of the Sb2S3−xSex films with x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.90 and 1.25 were characterized by UV-vis spectra. By linearly fitting the (αhν)2 ∼ hν curves (where α is the absorption coefficient, h is the Planck constant, and ν is the photon frequency) at the absorption edges (Fig. 9a), the band gap values of Sb2S3, Sb2S2.7Se0.25, Sb2S2.5Se0.5, Sb1.9S2.2Se0.9 and Sb1.95S1.8Se1.25 were found to be 1.69 eV, 1.63 eV, 1.57 eV, 1.52 eV and 1.48 eV, respectively. The band gap decreases with increasing Se content in the films. The energy level positions of the Sb2S3−xSex films with different S/Se mole ratios were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As shown in Fig. 9b, with increasing x value, the valence band maximum (VBM) of the films gradually moves upward while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is almost unchanged. Thus, a suitable V-type energy band can be obtained by controlling the gradient distribution of the Se content in the direction perpendicular to the substrate. This is beneficial to decrease surface recombination, increase the built-in potential difference (Vbi) and improve the carrier separation efficiency without affecting the light absorption at the same time. Consequently, this leads to simultaneous improvement of the VOC and JSC values of the devices.

The J–V curves of Sb2S3−xSex thin film solar cells with different S/Se mole ratios under AM 1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 10a and Table 3. The PCE of Sb2S3 (x = 0) was 3.4%, and the corresponding VOC, JSC and FF were 613.3 mV, 13.1 mA cm−2 and 42.1%, respectively (Fig. 10a, green curve). The JSC of the Sb2S2.7Se.25 (x = 0.25) device increased to 17.0 mA cm−2 because the band gap of the film became smaller and the absorption edge red shifted as the Se content increased, leading to light absorption enhancement; this is consistent with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) results (Fig. 10b). At the same time, the decrease of the band gap gave rise to a decrease of VOC. The detailed parameters of these five devices are listed in Table 3. The series resistance (RS) values of the Sb2S3, Sb2S2.7Se0.25, Sb2S2.5Se0.5, Sb1.9S2.2Se0.9 and Sb1.95S1.8Se1.25 devices were 19.4, 10.9, 9.5, 6.9, and 7.3 Ω cm2, respectively, indicating that increasing the Se mole ratio improved the electrical conductivity of the Sb2S3−xSex films. After optimization, Sb1.9S2.2Se0.9 (x = 0.9) demonstrated the highest efficiency of 5.8%. Table 4 summarizes the device performance of the Sb2S3−xSex thin film solar cells fabricated by selenium graded spin-coating (SGS),60 RTE61 and vapor transfer deposition (VTD)62 methods. Compared with higher-efficiency Sb2S3−xSex devices (6.3%),62 the Sb1.9S2.2Se0.9 device fabricated by the BDCA solution method suffered from low VOC and FF. Therefore, in subsequent work, the PCE of the device can be further improved by continuously optimizing the S/Se mole ratio or seeking a more suitable buffer layer film.

3.3 CuSbS2 film
The above sections mainly summarize the fabrication of binary MC thin film photovoltaic devices. Multi-metal chalcogenide films can also be deposited by the BDCA solution method. In this section, we pay attention to the fabrication of a ternary chalcogenide copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) thin film solar cell by the BDCA solution method. Several theoretical and experimental reports have shown that CuSbS2 is very suitable for use as an absorber layer in thin film solar cells because of its outstanding material and physical properties, such as earth-abundant and low-toxicity constituents, a higher light absorption coefficient (104 cm−1),45,63–66 and a moderate band gap (1.4 to 1.6 eV) with an S–Q theory efficiency of 32.23%.54,63 In addition, CuSbS2 film can be fabricated at a low annealing temperature because of its low melting point (551 °C),45,63 enabling flexible device fabrication. The CuSbS2–BDCA precursor solution preparation and CuSbS2 film deposition process are shown in Fig. 11. Cu2O (0.5 mmol) and Sb2O3 (0.5 mmol) were simultaneously dissolved in BDCA (0.75 mL CS2 and 1 mL CH3(CH2)3NH2), which was diluted with 1 mL ethanol. After magnetic stirring for 2 h, a clear and transparent CuSbS2 precursor solution was obtained. Subsequently, the precursor solution was spin-coated on a FTO/CdS substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then subjected to high temperature annealing to obtain a brown CuSbS2 film.
 Fig. 11  Schematic of the process for fabricating CuSbS2 film by the BDCA solution method. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 45, Copyright 2018, Springer). 
Based on the TGA curve of CuSbS2 (Fig. 2c), the annealing temperatures were set as 240 °C, 290 °C and 340 °C. The crystallinities of the CuSbS2 films fabricated at different annealing temperatures were investigated by XRD (Fig. 12a). The diffraction peaks were perfectly consistent with the standard card (JCPDS 44-1417),45 revealing that the deposited films did not contain secondary phase. When the annealing temperature was raised to 290 °C and 340 °C, the intensity of the diffraction peak at ∼28.4°, corresponding to the (111) crystal plane of CuSbS2,45 significantly increased, suggesting improved crystallinity. Meanwhile, the texture coefficient (TC) of the (111) plane increased from 1.04 to 1.76 and 1.96, respectively, indicating that the deposited CuSbS2 films exhibited (111) preferred orientation at high temperature. Fig. 12b–d shows the surface morphologies of the CuSbS2 films fabricated at different temperatures. The films deposited at 240 °C and 290 °C had small grains, low crystallinity, and apparent pinholes (Fig. 12b and c). When the temperature was raised to 340 °C, the obtained CuSbS2 film was compact and highly crystalline, with a grain size of ∼500 nm (Fig. 12d).

The CuSbS2 film deposited at 340 °C was then assembled into a solar cell with a configuration of FTO/CdS/CuSbS2/Au. The CdS buffer layer and Au electrode were deposited by CBD and TE methods, respectively.45,67 The CBM and VBM of the CuSbS2 film fabricated by the BDCA solution process are located at −3.65 eV and −5.25 eV, respectively, corresponding to a band gap of 1.6 eV.45 Therefore, CdS and CuSbS2 form a type-II heterojunction (Fig. 13a).45,63 The device exhibited a VOC of 380 mV, a JSC of 4.02 mA cm−2, a FF of 44.76% and an efficiency of 0.68% under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 13b). As a comparison, the CuSbS2 thin film solar cells fabricated by other methods are listed in Table 5, including electrochemical deposition (ED),9 hybrid ink (HI),64 CBD,21,68 physical vapor deposition (PVD),66 rapid thermal processing (RTP)69 and hydrazine solution methods.63 The low JSC of the CuSbS2 device fabricated by the BDCA solution method is responsible for the inferior PCE. The key reasons can be summarized as follows: (i) CuSbS2 has a high hole concentration (∼1018 cm−3); thus, the CuSbS2 acceptor concentration is high,45,63 and the space charge region on the side of CuSbS2 is narrow. This can significantly decrease photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and decrease carrier collection efficiency, resulting in a low JSC. (ii) Cd diffusion occurs during film deposition, which produces a high defect density at the interface.45,67 (iii) The conduction band offset between the CdS buffer layer and the CuSbS2 absorber layer causes recombination of photogenerated carriers at the interface of the PN junction.45 Therefore, the device efficiency of the CuSbS2 solar cell fabricated by the BDCA solution method should be further improved by decreasing the hole concentration and finding a more stable buffer layer (such as TiO2, SnO2 or ZnO).

3.4 Quaternary CSM films

3.4.1 CIGSSe film and device. 
CIGSSe photovoltaic thin film is considered to be the most successful thin film solar cell; it achieved a record efficiency of 22.9% by a sputtering method in 2018.70 Solution methods for the fabrication of highly efficient CIGSSe thin film solar cells were also widely explored at the same time.20,46,70,71 In 2012, Wang et al. reported the fabrication of a CIGSSe thin film solar cell by the BDCA solution method for the first time; they achieved a PCE of 8.8%.46 The fabrication process of CIGSSe film can be roughly divided into two steps: firstly, CIGS film is prepared by the BDCA solution method; then, CIGSSe film is obtained by selenizing the CIGS film.46 In detail, Cu2O (1.5 mmol), In(OH)3 (3 mmol) and Ga(acac)3 (acac = acetylacetonate, 1.5 mmol) were respectively dissolved in BDCA (1.8 mL CS2, 3 mL CH3(CH2)3NH2 and 10 mL ethanol) and mixed with each other in a specific ratio (Ga/(Ga + In) = 0.3, Cu/(Ga + In) = 0.9). The as-obtained solution was used as the precursor of CIGS. The CIGS precursor solution was spin-coated on molybdenum (Mo) glass at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 350 °C for 3 min. The annealing temperature was selected based on TGA results, as shown in Fig. 2c. The spin-coating and annealing processes were repeated 7 times to obtain a sufficiently thick CIGS film. The as-prepared CIGS film was transformed into CIGSSe film through annealing at 540 °C for 60 min in a Se vapor atmosphere. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared CIGS film and the CIGSSe films are shown in Fig. 14. The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the CIGS diffraction peaks was wide and the peak intensity was weak; therefore, the crystallinity of the CIGS film was low. However, after the selenization process, the FWHM dramatically narrowed and the peak intensity significantly increased; this indicates that the CIGSSe film was highly crystallized, which is extremely important for highly efficient thin film solar cells.
 Fig. 14  XRD patterns for the CIGS thin film (red line) and CIGSSe absorber layer (black line). (Reprinted with permission from ref. 46, Copyright 2012, ACS). 
Top-view and cross-section views of the CIGSSe film are shown in Fig. 15. The CIGSSe film had a uniform and dense surface topography with high crystallinity (Fig. 15a). The average grain size was approximately 2 μm, and no pinholes or cracks were observed at the surface. From the cross-section SEM image (Fig. 15b), the thickness of the CIGSSe film was about 1.2 μm.
 Fig. 15  (a) Top view and (b) cross-sectional SEM images of the CIGSSe absorber layer. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 46, Copyright 2012, ACS). 
Finally, the CIGSSe film deposited on the Mo glass substrate was applied as the absorber in a thin film solar cell with the structure of glass/Mo/CIGSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Al, in which CdS, i-ZnO, ITO and Al electrodes were deposited by CBD, RF (radio frequency) MS, DC (direct current) MS and TE.46Fig. 16a shows the J–V curves of the device in the dark and under AM 1.5G illumination. The device showed a PCE of 8.75% (VOC = 609 mV, JSC = 20.86 mA cm−2 and FF = 68.9%) and an average PCE of 8.8%. Compared with the most efficient CIGSSe solar cells fabricated by other methods (Table 6), including MS,72 TE,27 amine–thiol,42 hydrazine process,73 SPL74 and ETD,75 the lower PCE of the CIGSSe solar cell fabricated by the BDCA solution method was mainly limited by its low JSC. The EQE spectrum of the CIGSSe device (Fig. 16b) demonstrated that the quantum efficiency was significantly decreased in the long wavelength range, implying that the CIGSSe absorption layer was too thin to fully absorb long wavelength light, resulting in a low JSC and poor device efficiency. Furthermore, the band gap of the CIGSSe film deposited by the BDCA solution method was 1.36 eV (Fig. 16b inset), which is smaller than that in highly efficient devices fabricated by vacuum-based methods (∼1.15 eV).11 Thus, the device efficiency of CIGSSe devices fabricated by the BDCA method can be improved from two aspects: (i) increasing the CIGSSe film thickness. The CIGSSe has an absorption coefficient of 104 to 105 cm−1 and a carrier diffusion length of 2.3 μm,71 indicating that CIGSSe with a thickness of ∼1.9 μm can absorb incident light effectively and avoid the loss of carriers during transport at the same time;12 (ii) tuning the band gap of the CIGSSe absorber layer to ∼1.15 eV, which can be easily tuned by introducing more Se in the CIGSSe film.

3.4.2 CZTSSe film and device. 
CZTSSe thin film solar cells have attracted great attention in recent decades because CZTSSe contains earth-abundant and non-toxic elements and has a high absorption coefficient and suitable band gap.47,76–78 The structure of CZTSSe is derived from CIGSSe, in which In3+ and Ga3+ ions are replaced by the same number of Zn2+ and Sn4+ ions.47,76 Similar to the CIGSSe film deposition mentioned in Section 3.4.1, the deposition process of CZTSSe film can be roughly divided into three steps: (i) three metal oxides, namely Cu2O (1.5 mmol), ZnO (2.3 mmol) and SnO (2 mmol), are respectively dissolved in BDCA (1.05 mL CS2, 1.75 mL CH3(CH2)3NH2 and 1.5 mL ethanol). Then, the three precursor solutions are mixed with molar ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.7 and Zn/Sn = 1.15. After magnetic stirring, a transparent CZTS precursor solution is obtained (Fig. 17). (ii) The CZTS precursor solution is spin-coated on Mo glass at 3000 rpm for 20 s and then thermally annealed at 320 °C for 1 min according to the TGA curve (Fig. 2c). In order to obtain a sufficiently thick CZTSSe film, the process is repeated 8 times. (iii) The as-prepared CZTS film is selenized at 540 °C for 45 min to finally obtain the CZTSSe film.
 Fig. 17  Schematic and photograph of the preparation of the CZTS precursor solution. The mole ratios in the precursor solution are Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.70, Zn/Sn = 1.15. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 47, Copyright 2013, ACS). 

Fig. 18a shows the XRD patterns of the CZTS and CZTSSe films deposited by the BDCA solution method. Similar to the CIGS and CIGSSe films mentioned in Section 3.4.1, the CZTS film showed weak and broad diffraction peaks (Fig. 18a, red curve), indicating that the crystallinity of the CZTS film was low. After the selenization process, the XRD peak intensity of the CZTSSe film significantly increased and the FWHM became narrower. Binary or ternary chalcogenides, such as ZnS, Cu2SnS3, ZnSe, and Cu2SnSe3, have similar XRD diffraction characteristic peaks to CZTS and CZTSSe.8,47,79–81 Therefore, XRD characterization is not sufficient to demonstrate the phase purity of CZTS and CZTSSe films. Raman spectroscopy can further distinguish secondary phases such as ZnS, Cu2SnS3, ZnSe, and Cu2SnSe3.79 As shown in Fig. 18b, the main peak of the CZTS film was located at 338 cm−1 (red curve), which is consistent with other reported CZTS values;80 this indicates that the CZTS film deposited by the BDCA solution method did not contain binary or ternary chalcogenide phases (such as ZnS, Cu2SnS3, ZnSe, and Cu2SnSe3). For the CZTSSe film, the main peaks were located at 210 and 329 cm−1, which is in good agreement with the literature results for CZTSSe with S/(S + Se) = 0.30.82 Therefore, phase-pure CZTSSe films were deposited by the BDCA solution method.

SEM was carried out to characterize the surface morphologies and thicknesses of the CZTS and CZTSSe films. The thickness of the pre-fabricated CZTS film was about 1.4 μm, and the cross-section SEM showed no obvious grains or grain boundaries (Fig. 19a); therefore, the crystallinity was relatively low. After the selenization process, the obtained CZTSSe film showed obvious grains and grain boundaries, and the grain size was close to 2 μm (Fig. 19b). Compared with the pre-fabricated CZTS film, the CZTSSe film had a distinct tri-layer structure: a carbon-rich small particle layer with a thickness of ∼400 nm at the bottom; a medium-sized grain layer with a thickness of ∼200 nm; and a dense large grain layer with a thickness of ∼1 μm on the top.

Finally, the performance of the device with a configuration of glass/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Al was characterized under AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. 20a). The deposition methods of CdS, i-ZnO, ITO and Al electrodes were the same as those of the CIGSSe devices described in Section 3.4.1.46 The device exhibited a PCE of 6.03% (VOC = 428 mV, JSC = 23.27 mA cm−2 and FF = 60.6%). Its JSC was significantly lower than those of the most efficient CZTSSe devices fabricated by hydrazine processes,38 MS,83 TE,84 SPL,85 amine–thiol processes86 and ETD87 (Table 7). The JSC loss, evaluated by EQE and the reflection spectrum (Fig. 20b), was attributed to the following reasons: (i) the band gap of the BDCA-based CZTSSe film was fitted as 1.2 eV from the EQE spectrum, which is slightly larger than that of the most efficient CZTSSe fabricated by a hydrazine process (1.13 eV).38 (ii) The CZTS absorber layer was too thin to efficiently absorb long-wavelength light. In the visible range, the highest quantum efficiency was only ∼80%, caused by the high reflectance (∼11.4%) in the range of 400 to 1200 nm. (iii) In contrast to the hydrazine solution process, a carbon-rich small-grained layer with undesirable impurity phases was located at the interface between the large-grained layer and the Mo substrate,82,88 leading to a high RS and a substantial decrease in JSC. Meanwhile, the tri-layer morphology restricted the transport of photo-generated carriers, limiting the PCE of the solar cells.

The delamination of CZTSSe films, caused by the carbon-rich small-grained layer between the large-grained layer and the substrate, seriously affects device performance. Therefore, Guo et al. proposed that insetting BDCA-based Sb-containing (such as Sb2S3, CuSbS2 and NaSb5S8) films between CZTSSe and the Mo substrate could promote grain growth during the selenization process and would not produce additional impurity phases.76 The corresponding top-view SEM images are shown in Fig. 21. The CZTSSe film deposited directly on Mo had a uniform and dense surface morphology, with a grain size ranging from 0.5 to 2.3 μm (Fig. 21a). For the CZTSSe/Sb2S3, CZTSSe/CuSbS2 and CZTSSe/NaSb5S8 films, the crystallinity of CZTSSe was significantly improved, and the grain size was close to 4 μm (Fig. 21b–d).

The delamination issue of the CZTSSe films was also partially overcome after insetting Sb2S3, CuSbS2 and NaSb5S8 buffer layers, which was confirmed by the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 22). The CZTSSe film without buffer layers on Mo substrate had a distinct bi-layer structure (∼1.2 μm bottom layer with small grains; ∼600 nm top layer with large grains, Fig. 22a). After insetting the Sb2S3, CuSbS2 and NaSb5S8 buffer layers, the grain size of the bottom layer was significantly enlarged (Fig. 22b–d), which is beneficial to device performance. Therefore, insetting an appropriate buffer layer is an effective strategy to improve grain growth and device performance. However, due to the lack of further optimization, the PCE of CZTSSe with an Sb-containing buffer layer was less than 6%.

4. Discussion and outlook
At present, Si and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have achieved impressive development, with efficiencies higher than 24%.89,90 However, highly efficient crystalline Si solar cells have difficulties for portability, flexibility and building integration applications, and perovskite solar cells suffer from low stability.91–98 Chalcogenide thin film solar cells (such as CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2) can take both high efficiency and stability into consideration. The main optimizing directions are component control, defect passivation and novel fabrication processes.
Although a variety of MC thin film solar cells have been successfully fabricated by the BDCA solution method, this method is still in an early stage of development. Compared with other mature processes, the MC thin film solar cells fabricated by the BDCA solution method still have much space for PCE improvement. Two potential research directions are proposed below:
(1) Decrease the carbon residue. Carbon residue in BDCA-based films is mainly responsible for the low device performance because it can introduce detrimental defect recombination centers in the absorber.47 Both of the reactants (CS2 and CH3(CH2)3NH2) used in the BDCA method contain carbon; especially, CH3(CH2)3NH2 contains four carbon atoms. Therefore, replacing CH3(CH2)3NH2 with another organic amine with a shorter carbon chain, such as propylamine (C3H7NH2) or ethylamine (C2H5NH2), is a promising method to decrease the carbon residues in the films.
(2) Improve the crystallinity of the BDCA-based MC film. As shown in this review, the crystallinity of BDCA-based MC films tends to be low. In the process of depositing CZTSSe films by the BDCA solution method, the incorporation of Sb-based buffer layer thin films between the substrate and the CZTSSe film can induce grain growth of CZTSSe in the selenization process and does not introduce impurity phases. This method provides a new research direction for improving the crystallinity of other MC films deposited by the BDCA solution method. In addition, suitably increasing the annealing temperature or time would be worthwhile to attempt.
In addition, the decomposition of BDCA solution during the deposition of MC films can generate toxic H2S gas.48 Therefore, the BDCA solution method must be performed in a glove box, and appropriate exhaust gas treatment and protection equipment is required. Further effort should be exerted to solve this problem in future research.
5. Conclusion
The BDCA solution method described in this review has successfully been used to produce a series of metal chalcogenide thin film solar cells, including Sb2S3, Sb2S3−xSex, CuSbS2, CIGSSe and CZTSSe thin film solar cells. In this method, highly active butyldithiocarbamic acid severs as a solvent to dissolve a series of metal oxides or metal hydroxides, and the obtained precursor is spin-coated on a substrate to deposit high-quality MC films under relatively low temperature conditions. The deposited films have uniform and pinhole-free surface morphologies with acceptable crystallinity. Based on the BDCA solution method, the highest efficiencies of Sb2S3, Sb2S3−xSex, CuSbS2, CIGSSe and CZTSSe solar cells are 4.3%, 5.8%, 0.68%, 8.75%, and 6.03%, respectively. In the end, we discussed the issue of a carbon-rich layer located at the interface of the absorber layer and substrate. Although this review mainly focuses on the fabrication of thin film solar cells using the BDCA solution process, this method is also suitable for fabricating other metal chalcogenides with different applications, such as photocatalysts and photodetector.
