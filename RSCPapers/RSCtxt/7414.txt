E-mail: cesjln@mail.sysu.edu.cnReceived 10th July 2007, Accepted 10th October 2007First published on 26th October 2007AbstractA combined computational and experimental study on DNA-photocleavage by Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+1–3 (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine; L: pip = 2-phenylimidazo[4,5-f]1,10-phenanthroline, o-mopip = 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)imidazo[4,5-f]1,10-phenanthroline and p-mopip = 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)imidazo[4,5-f]1,10-phenanthroline) has been carried out. The DNA-photocleavage behavior of these complexes was comparably measured by the gel electrophoresis experiments. The experimental results show that they can induce considerable DNA-photocleavage, and have different DNA-photocleavage efficiencies (φ) following the order φ (1) < φ (2) < φ (3). In order to understand their DNA-photocleavage mechanism and trend, the theoretical studies on the geometric and electronic structures of these complexes in the ground state (S0), the first singlet excited state (S1) and triplet excited states (T1), have been carried out using the density functional theory (DFT/TD-DFT), Hartree–Fock (HF) and configuration interaction singles (CIS) methods. In particular, the reduction potentials (E*red) of the excited complexes in aqueous solution, which seem to be closely responsible for the DNA-photocleavage behavior, were calculated to be 0.966 V (vs. SCE) for complex 1, 1.024 V (vs. SCE) for complex 2 and 1.030 V (vs. SCE) for complex 3, respectively. Such computational results show that the reduction potentials of the excited complexes reach the theoretical range for oxidizing some DNA-bases, and follow the order E*red (1) < E*red (2) < E*red (3). Therefore, here, in addition to the general theoretical explanation of their DNA-photocleavage mechanism according to our recent report, a further explanation on the trend of their DNA-photocleavage efficiencies, i.e., φ (1) < φ (2) < φ (3), was reasonably carried out, on the basis of the calculated electrochemical properties in the excited states as well as general photochemical insights.1. IntroductionSince tris(2,2′-bipyridine)ruhenium(II) chloride was first reported as a photosensitizer in the early 1970’s,1,2 more and more novel Ru(II) polypridyl complexes have been synthesized and characterized. Moreover, their interesting photophysical and photochemical properties have been considerably investigated3–6 due to their potential application as DNA photo-probes,7 DNA photocleavage reagents,3,4,8 molecular light switches9–11 and dye-sensitized solar cells etc.12–14 In particular, the most attractive feature is that some of them are able to bind to DNA-base-pairs in an intercalative mode and effectively cleave the DNA under UV or visible light irradiation. Since the DNA-photocleavege behavior of the complexes closely relates to their promising utilities as antimetastatic agents in photochemical treatments, it is very significant to reveal their DNA-photocleavage mechanism as well as the related regularity and trend.In the past two decades, many experimental studies and reviews regarding the DNA-photocleavage behavior of Ru(II) polypridyl complexes have been reported.3,4,8,15 Moreover, it is well-accepted that Ru(II) polypridyl complexes can be classified into two types from the point of view of their oxidizing power in the excited state. One is the non-oxidizing-type (e.g., [Ru(phen)3]2+ and [Ru(bpy)3]2+), of which the excited complexes have a low oxidizing power, and the DNA-photocleavage has a low efficiency and mainly perform a singlet oxygen photosensitization mechanism.15,16 Another one is the oxidizing-type (e.g. [Ru(tap)2(dppz)]2+) (tap = 1,4,5,8-tetraazaphenanthrene, dppz = dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine), of which the excited complexes have a high oxidizing power, and the DNA-photocleavage has a high efficiency and mainly perform a photo-inducing oxidation–reduction mechanism in addition to the singlet oxygen photosensitization.15–19 Though a great number of experimental studies on DNA photocleavage by Ru(II) polypridyl complexes have been reported, so far the definite DNA photocleavage mechanism remains unclear for most Ru(II) complexes,3,4,11 moreover, the theoretical insights into this field are still very limited.20 Therefore, theoretical studies on DNA photocleavage behaviors are of great significance for understanding the interaction mechanism and trend, and directing the functional molecular design of this type of Ru(II) complex.Recently, theoretical studies on transition metal complexes have been improved greatly due to the progress of computer technology and computational chemistry. The properties of the transition metal complexes including geometric and electronic structures, electronic absorption spectra as well as chemical reaction processes etc, have been widely investigated by DFT/TD-DFT calculations. Moreover, the theoretical results are in considerable agreement with the experimental ones, and provide good explanations and predictions for the experimental findings.21–26The redox potentials of a compound (or complex), which are usually measured by cyclic voltammetry methods,27–29 are very important thermodynamic variables as well as a very useful tool for investigating the charge transfer between different chemical species. Recently, as a great development of computational chemistry, the redox potentials of a compound in the ground state are able to be obtained via theoretical calculations.30–33 This is advantageous to the prediction of the charge-transfer reaction between different chemical species. At present, some empirical approaches on evaluating the redox potentials (E*ox and E*red) of some excited complexes have been reported. One common method was firstly employed by Rhem and Weller,34 and the redox potentials of excited complexes were obtained from the excited-state energy E0,0 and the ground-state redox potentials. For example, the redox potentials (E*ox and E*red) of some excited Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have been obtained on the basis of their corresponding experimental data in the ground states and the maximum emission energies.15,17,35,36 Another empirical method obtains the redox potentials of excited complexes from the quenching rate of their excited state. For example, Bock et al. have obtained the oxidization potential of excited [Ru(bpy)3]2+ from the quenching rate of its excited state by some organic compounds,37 and Forster et al. have applied ultrafast voltammetry to elucidate the dynamics and energetics of electron transfer from an excited state to the electrode and obtained the oxidation potential of the excited Ru(II) polypridyl complex.38 In addition to these two methods, the redox potentials of the excited complexes were able to be directly measured using phase-modulated voltammetry.39 Though these empirical methods can be used to obtain the redox potentials of excited complexes, the theoretical calculations on the redox potentials of excited compounds (or complexes) have not yet been obtained. Therefore, the theoretical data obtained by computation-chemical methods will be very useful for predicting the behavior of excited compounds, in particular, for elucidating the DNA-photocleavage mechanism of this type of Ru(II) complex and their DNA-photocleavage trend.Recently, we have made a preliminary report on a theoretical study of the DNA-photocleavage as well as the spectral properties of [Ru(phen)2(6-OH-dppz)]2+ (6-OH-dppz = 6-hydoxy-dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine).20 A theoretical explanation of the DNA-photocleavage mechanism based on the electronic and geometric structures of this Ru(II) complex in the excited state was presented. In this paper, we selected a series of Ru(II) complexes [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip = 2-phenylimidazo[4,5-f]1,10-phenanthroline, o-mopip = 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)imidazo[4,5-f]1,10-phenanthroline and p-mopip = 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)imidazo[4,5-f]1,10-phenanthroline) to further investigate their photocleavage mechanism and their photocleavage trend with combined computational and experimental methods. The DNA-photocleavage behavior of these complexes was comparably measured by experiments, the electronic and geometric structures were computed with DFT/TD-DFT, HF (Hartree–Fock) and configuration interaction singles (CIS) methods, moreover, their standard redox potentials of the ground state and the excited state (T1, 3MLCT) were theoretically calculated. The most novel point of this paper is to present a theoretical explanation on the trend in DNA photocleavage of this series of Ru(II) complexes, based on the insights into the electrochemistry and photochemistry in addition to the electronic and geometric structures.2. Experimental2.1. Experimental methodsThe synthesis and characterization as well as the photocleavage behavior of [Ru(bpy)2(o-mopip)]2+ and [Ru(bpy)2(p-mopip)]2+ have been reported in our previous article.40 Here, in order to obtain comparable DNA-photocleavage efficiencies, the DNA-photocleavage experiments of [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip, p-mopip) under the same conditions were carefully carried out.For the gel electrophotolysis experiments, supercoiled pBR322 DNA (10 µM) was treated with the Ru(II) complex in 50 mM Tris-HCl (Tris = tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine) buffer (pH 8.3), 18 mM NaCl, and then the solution was irradiated at room temperature with a UV lamp (365 nm, 10 W) for 60 min. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis for about 3–4 h at 30 V on a 1% agarose gel in Tris–boracic acid–EDTA (EDTA = ethylenediamine tetraacetate) buffer. The gel was stained with 0.5 µg ml–1 ethidium bromide (3,8-diamino-5-ethyl-6-phenylphenanthridinium bromide) and photographed under UV light. The extent of DNA cleavage was determined by using the volume quantification method in Image Tools 3.00. More information about this software can be obtained by http://ddsdx.uthscsa.edu/dig/itdesc.html. In all cases, the background fluorescence was determined by a DNA-free lane as reference. A correction factor of 1.42 was utilized to account for the decreased ability of ethidium bromide to intercalate into supercoiled DNA (form I) versus nicked DNA (form II).41 The relative amounts of the different forms of DNA were determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity of each band by the sum of fluorescence intensities for all bands in that lane. All results obtained from the experiments were performed at least in triplicate.2.2. Computational methodsStructural schematic diagrams of the complexes (1–3) are shown in Fig. 1. Every one of them is formed from one Ru(II) ion, one main ligand (or intercalative ligand) and two co-ligands (bpy) and has no symmetry. Full geometry optimization of the ground state (S0) was carried out using the restricted DFT-B3LYP method42–47 and HF methods. For the obtained structures, the frequency calculations adopting the same method were also performed in order to verify the optimized structure to be an energy minimum. Ten singlet excitation energies and ten triplet excitation energies based on the optimized ground state geometry were calculated with the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/LanL2DZ level, the polarizable conductor calculation model (CPCM)48–49 and the default parameters were used for those excitation energies in aqueous solution. The geometries of the lowest singlet excited state (S1) and triplet excited state (T1) of the three complexes were fully optimized using the configuration interaction singles (CIS) method.50 The natural population analysis (NPA) of various states was further carried out for the ground state with the HF method and for the excited states (S1 and T1) with the CIS method based on their optimized geometries. Fig. 1  Structural schematic diagrams and atomic labels of [Ru(bpy)2pip]2+ (1), [Ru(bpy)2(o-mopip)]2+ (2), and [Ru(bpy)2(p-mopip)]2+ (3). The complexes [Ru(bpy)2(L)]n+ (L = pip, o-mopip, p-mopip; n = 1–3) were also completely optimized with the unrestricted B3LYP method to obtain the corrected Gibbs free energies of the ground states in the gas phase, and then the Gibbs free energies in aqueous solution were obtained from their single point calculations in aqueous solution with the CPCM model at the UB3LYP/LanL2DZ level and the corresponding zero point corrections in the gas phase. For excited Ru(II) complexes, based on their optimized geometries in the lowest triplet excited state, the Gibbs free energies were obtained via single point computations in the gas phase and in aqueous solution at the UB3LYP/LanL2DZ level together with the corresponding zero point corrections for the Ru(II) complexes.All computations were performed with the Gaussian 03 program-package (Revison D.01)51 and the LanL2DZ basis set52,53 was adopted for all the calculations. In addition, in order to vividly understand the related properties of the complexes (1–3), the stereo-contour graphs of some related frontier molecular orbitals of the Ru(II) complexes for S0 in aqueous solution were drawn with the Molden v4.2 program54 based on the computational results.In addition, the approach used for the theoretical calculations of the redox potentials for some metal ion couples, metal complexes and organic compounds have been reported.30–33 Here, we adopted Scheme 1 to calculate the standard redox potentials of the Ru(II) complexes in the ground state (S0) and the lowest triplet excited states (T1). The principle of this method is briefly presented as follows:In order to compare with experimental data, the standard redox potentials of the complexes [Ru(bpy)2L]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip and p-mopip) in the ground state relative to the standard calomel electrode (SCE) can be calculated using eqn (1) on the basis of the thermodynamic cycle as shown in Scheme 1.30–31 The Gibbs free energy change of the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) (ΔG°SCE = –4.43 eV) is from the experimental value derived from ref. 55, which is equal to the Gibbs free energy change of eqn (8). The Gibbs free energy change of SCE (ΔG°SCE = –4.1888 eV) was obtained via adding 0.2412 eV (the standard potential of SCE relative to SHE is –0.2412 V) to that of SHE (–4.43 eV),30,33 which is equal to the Gibbs free energy change of eqn (9). (1)where (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)All of the related free energies were calculated under standard conditions, i.e., at 298.15 K and 1 atm, with the concentration of complex in aqueous solution at 1 mol L–1 and in the gas at 1 mol L–1.

Photocleavage of pBR322 DNA by Ru(II) complexes in experimentsThe photocleavage of pBR322 DNA in the absence and presence of Ru(II) complex was carried out in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 8.3), 18 mM NaCl under UV-irradiation, as seen in Fig. 2. No obvious DNA cleavage was observed for controls in the absence of the complexes. With increasing concentration of the complexes, form I (supercoiled, original form) of pBR322 DNA diminishes gradually, whereas the amount of form II (nicked, cleaved form) increases. From Table 1, it can be seen that under identical concentration and irradiation times, [Ru(bpy)2(p-mopip)]2+ (3) exhibits the highest DNA-cleaving efficiency in all the complexes and the DNA-cleaving efficiencies (φ) of the complexes follow the order φ (3) >φ (2) >φ (1). It is regretful that the experiments under anaerobic conditions can not be effectively carried out at present in our laboratory due to the restriction of experimental conditions. However, some studies have shown that the efficiency of DNA photo-cleavage via singlet oxygen photosensitization by Ru(II) complexes is very low.56–58 On the other hand, some studies have found that O2 plays an important role during photo-induced electron transfer and can act as an assistant reagent during the reaction.17,19 Therefore, based on the experimental data of the highly effective DNA photocleavage and our calculated electrochemical results, DNA photocleavage by these three Ru(II) complexes in intercalative mode should be mainly attributed to photo-induced electron transfer, whereas O2 is likely to act as an assistant reagent during the DNA-photocleavage by these complexes.

From Table 2, it is easy to see the following: First, for the parent complex [Ru(bpy)2pip]2+1, compared with those in the ground state, the mean coordination bond length of the main ligand (Ru–Nm) in the S1 and T1 states are increased by 0.0068 nm and by 0.0124 nm, and the mean bond length of the co-ligand (Ru–Nco) in the S1 and T1 states are also increased by 0.0152 nm and 0.0143 nm, respectively; for the complex [Ru(bpy)2(o-mopip)]2+2, the mean coordination bond length of the main ligand (Ru–Nm) in the S1 and T1 states are increased by 0.0227 nm and by 0.0021 nm respectively, and the mean bond length of the co-ligand (Ru–Nco) in the S1 and T1 states are also increased by 0.007 nm and 0.0188 nm, respectively; and for the complex [Ru(bpy)2(p-mopip)]2+3, the mean bond length of the main ligand (Ru–Nm) in S1 and T1 are increased by 0.0068 nm and 0.012 nm, respectively, and the mean bond length of the co-ligand (Ru–Nco) in S1 and T1 are increased by 0.0152 nm and 0.0136 nm repectively. Second, the coordination bond-angles (Am) between Ru and two N atoms of the main ligand, and those (Aco) between Ru and two N atoms of the co-ligand in the excited states are also obviously decreased, for example, the Am of 77.5° in the ground state S0 is reduced to 75.5° in excited state S1 and 73.8° in T1 for complex 1, and so forth. Third, the dihedral angles of the complexes do not substantially change in the excited states compared to their corresponding ground states.3.3 Natural charge populations of [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip and p-mopip) in the ground and excited statesThe natural charge populations of the ground state (S0) and the low-lying excited states (S1 and T1) for the complexes [Ru(bpy)2(L)]3+ (L = pip, o-mopip and p-mopip) are selectively listed in Table 3, obtained from the natural population analysis (NPA) in vacuo on the basis of their corresponding optimized geometry (the atom labels shown in Fig. 1). The total net charges on the ligands in various states are also listed in Table 3.

The positive net charges on the Ru atom of the complexes in S1 and T1 are greatly increased. The positive net charges on the Ru atom of the parent complex 1 increase from 0.9750 (|e|) in S0 to 1.1757 (|e|) in S1 and 1.1823 (|e|) in T1; and those of complex 2 increase from 0.9743 (|e|) in S0 to 1.1699 (|e|) in S1 and 1.1852 (|e|) in T1 state; and those of complex 3 increase from 0.9729 (|e|) to 1.1738 (|e|) in S1 and 1.1743 (|e|) in T1 state.We can also see that the positive net charge populations of ligands for the excited states are correspondingly reduced relative to the ground states from Table 3. For complex 1, the calculated net positive charges on the main ligand (as a whole) and the two co-ligands (as a whole) are reduced by 0.0452 (|e|) and 0.1554 (|e|) for the S1 state, respectively; and decreased by 0.0646 (|e|) and 0.1426 (|e|) for the T1 state, respectively. For complex 2, the calculated net positive charges are reduced by 0.1048 (|e|) and 0.0907 (|e|) for the S1 state, respectively; and decreased by 0.029 (|e|) and 0.182 (|e|) for the T1 state, respectively. For complex 3, the net charges on the main ligand and co-ligands for the S1 state are decreased by 0.0452 (|e|) and 0.1557 (|e|), respectively; and those for the T1 state are decreased by 0.0609 (|e|) and 0.1405 (|e|), respectively. Comparing these three complexes, we can find that the increases in the net positive charges on the central Ru atom in the varied excited states are very similar.For comparison, the natural charge populations of the complexes [Ru(bpy)2(L)]3+ (L = pip, o-mopip and p-mopip) in the ground state with UHF/LanL2DZ are also summarized in Table S1.† From Table S1,† we can see that the positive charges on the Ru atom in the three Ru(III) complexes are very similar and all equal to 1.453 (|e|), which are larger by ∼0.36 (|e|) than that on the Ru atom of the excited Ru (II) complexes; such facts suggest that the oxidizing ability of the excited Ru(II) complexes is stronger than that of the ground-state Ru(II) complexes, but are weaker than that of genuine Ru(III) complexes in the ground state. Therefore, it may be much easier to control the damage of the DNA by the excited Ru(II) complexes than by the Ru(III) complexes in the ground state.3.4 The computed electrochemical data of the complexes [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip, p-mopip)For the ground state complexes, the related data including the free energy and the correction contribution to the free energy in the gas phase and in aqueous solution were calculated at a temperature of 298.15 K and 1 atm on the basis of the optimized geometry in the gas (see Table S2†). For the excited complexes, it is necessary to explain that the free energies of the excited complexes were corrected with the corresponding zero point correction of the ground state complexes, and the obtained standard redox potentials of the excited complexes are still reliable because the correction contributions to the standard redox potentials are small (0.03–0.14 V). Table 4 displays the calculated standard redox potentials in the ground states and the lowest triplet excited states (T1) as well as the experimental data of complex 1.

Such errors may come from the solvation energies which are calculated using an approximate model (CPCM) with water as the solvent because the main ligands of complexes (1–3) all have certain potentials as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, but these points are not considered in theoretical calculations at present. Therefore, some errors still exist when the present computational methods are used to predict the standard redox potentials of this kind of complex. Applying the same method to the other members (complex 2 and complex 3), their standard redox potentials were obtained and listed in Table 4.The calculated reduction potential (E*red) of the excited complexes (1–3) are positive values, and display a trend in the increase from complex 1 to 3, in which E*red were calculated to be 0.966 V for complex 1, 1.024 V for complex 2 and 1.030 V for complex 3, respectively. The value of E*red expresses the oxidizing ability of the excited complexes, therefore, their oxidation abilities should increase in such an order: E*red (1, 0.966 V) < E*red (2, 1.024 V) < E*red (3, 1.030 V). The calculated results are mainly consistent with the ones from the empirical approach based on the experimental reduction potential and the maximum emission energy, in which the positive reduction potentials of those excited Ru(II) complexes were evaluated.15,17,35,363.5 Some frontier molecular orbitals of the ground state (S0) of [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip and p-mopip)The frontier molecular orbitals of the ground state (S0), i.e., the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the occupied MO (HOMO – x) near to the HOMO, as well as the lowest unoccupied MO (LUMO) and the unoccupied MO (LUMO + x) near to the LUMO are very important because they are closely related to the DNA-binding properties as well as DNA-photocleavage behavior of the complexes. Some frontier molecular orbital energies and their main characters in aqueous solution are listed in Table 5, and some frontier molecular orbital diagrams in aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 3.

Theoretical studies have shown that the base pairs of DNA are excellent electron donators, because the energies of their occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and HOMO – x) are quite high, and the components of these molecular orbitals are predominantly distributed on the base pairs of DNA, whereas the complexes as intercalators are generally excellent electron acceptors, because the energies of their unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO and LUMO + x) are usually quite low and even much lower than those of the occupied MO (HOMO and HOMO – x) of the base pairs of DNA.59,60 Kurita and Kobayashi have reported the DFT results in vacuo for the stacking base pairs (CG/GC), the energies of HOMO to HOMO – 3 are quite high (–1.27 eV to –1.79 eV) and the components of HOMO and HOMO – 1 were mainly distributed on the base-pairs,59 however, for our studied [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip and p-mopip), the LUMO and LUMO + x (x = 0–3) energies for the three title complexes with the DFT method were quite low (–2.65 to ca. –2.22 eV) in spite of considering the solvent effect, and the components of LUMO + 2 and LUMO + 3 were mainly distributed on the main ligands. Such facts indicate that these studied complexes are excellent electron acceptors and the interaction between them and the base-pairs of DNA should be strong in π–π stacking. These are in good agreement with experimental findings, which have shown that these complexes interact with DNA in an intercalative mode and the bonding constants are rather large (1–5 × 105).28,40From Table 5 and Fig. 3, we can see that the induction of the –OCH3 group and its different substituted positions considerably changes the character of the frontier MOs of the title complexes, in particular, the characters of some occupied orbitals. For example, for complex 1, HOMO – 1 and HOMO – 3 mainly come from d orbitals of Ru mixed with the π orbital of the main ligand; and for complex 2, HOMO – 1 and HOMO – 3 mainly come from d orbitals of Ru mixed with the π orbital and some n(O) orbitals of the main ligand; while for complex 3, the HOMO – 1 mainly comes from d orbitals of Ru, and HOMO – 3 mainly comes from d orbitals of Ru mixed with some n(O) orbitals. It is notable that the HOMO of complex 3 comes from d orbitals of Ru atoms and π orbitals of the main ligand mixed with large n(O) orbitals, which is very different from the pure d orbital component for the HOMOs of complexes 1 and 2. However, there are not substantial differences for the unoccupied MOs of the three complexes. For example, their LUMOs come mainly from the co-ligands whereas their LUMO + 2 and LUMO + 3 mainly come from π-orbitals of the main (intercalative) ligands.The above-mentioned characteristics of the electronic structures of the complexes in S0 state can be used to discuss the trend in DNA-photocleavage by the title complexes.3.6 Theoretical explanation on the mechanism of DNA-photocleavage by [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip, p-mopip)The mechanism of DNA-photocleavage by Ru(II) complexes is a very interesting frontier subject at present. It has been reported that the excited Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have high oxidization ability relative to their ground state, and they can easily abstract an electron from poor electron donors or produce a charge-separated state via an intra-molecule photo-induced electron transfer.17,19,61–66 For example, Kirsh-De Mesmaeker et al. have reported that these excited Ru (II) complexes with tap or hat (1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene) as ligands can abstract an electron from DNA and result in DNA photocleavage,17,19 and Turro et al. have also reported that the long-lived excited state of a supramolecular Ru(II)–viologen complex with a Ru(III) center has high oxidization ability and can induce DNA cleavage.64 On the other hand, the ground state Ru(III) polypyridyl complexes have also high oxidization ability and are able to induce DNA cleavage.65 For example, Barton et al. have reported that [Ru(phen)2dppz]3+ produced by a flash–quench method can oxidize DNA nucleobases and result in DNA cleavage.66 It is reasonable to suppose that UV or visible light irradiation results in the metal center changing from Ru(II) in the ground state to Ru(III) in the excited state, and simultaneously results in the ligands having relatively more negative charge compared with those in the ground-state complexes. Such speculation is also consistent with the results of the NPA charge analysis. Therefore, the photo-induced Ru(III) center can be considered to oxidize guanine bases within the DNA duplex, finally resulting in DNA-cleavage. The experimental results have shown that these three complexes can cleave DNA under UV irradiation and have different photo-cleavage efficiencies, while their mechanism remains unclear. Since these complexes interact with DNA in an intercalative mode, they may be regarded as oxidizing-type Ru(II) complexes, and thus the mechanism of DNA photocleavage by these complexes may be considered to be a photo-inducing oxidation–reduction mechanism. Here, based on our computational results, such a mechanism can be reasonably explained in detail.Firstly, under UV or visible light irradiation, these complexes [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip and p-mopip) 1–3 can change from the ground state (S0) to the first singlet state (S1) or further to the first triplet state (T1). From the net charge populations on the Ru(II) atom in S0 and S1 (or T1) shown in Table 3, we can see that these complexes from S0 state to the S1 and T1 states undergo an intra-molecular electron transfer, and the positive charges on the central Ru atoms in the excited states are greatly increased relative to those in the ground states, as if the central Ru atom changes from Ru(II) to Ru(III). The NPA calculation results show that a Ru(III) center is formed in the excited states, and it is this Ru(III) center with the high oxidation ability that plays a key role in DNA photocleavage, and thus this may be the main reason why the DNA can be cleaved by this kind of excited Ru(II) complex.Secondly, the positive charges on the main ligand of S1 and T1 are concomitantly reduced relative to those on the main ligand of the ground state S0 due to the transfer of some “electron cloud” from the central Ru(II) atom to the main-ligand and co-ligand (see Table 3). On the other hand, when electrons transfer from the occupied orbitals (HOMO or HOMO – x) to the vacant orbitals (LUMO or LUMO + x) during light irradiation, some “electron cloud” will distribute over the vacant orbitals of the excited complex. Therefore, these two aspects must considerably weaken the interaction between the intercalative ligand and DNA-base-pairs, and thus strengthen the reduction power of the DNA pairs, because DNA-base-pairs are electron-donators and the intercalative ligand is an electron-acceptor, as mentioned above.Thirdly, as soon as the excited states of the title complexes are formed under light irradiation, their geometric distortions are also brought in the lifetime of the excited states with only several hundred ns for T1 and much shorter lifetimes for the S1. The bond lengths (Ru–N)m and (Ru–N)co of the title complexes in the excited state are obviously increased (see Table 1) relative to those of the ground state, therefore the interaction between the central Ru atom and the ligands will become weak. Moreover, the coordination bond-angle (N–Ru–N)m is obviously decreased. Therefore, such a geometric distortion must make the Ru(II) complexes easily form a quasi-free Ru(III) center, and a strong electrostatic interaction between the Ru(III) center and the base pairs may be instantaneously produced along the intercalative direction of the complexes toward DNA. As a result, Ru(III) can further approach the DNA-base-pairs, and thus oxidize them.In summary, the theoretical calculations can offer a concrete and vivid picture based on the photo-induced oxidation-mechanism of DNA-photocleavage by this kind of complex. That is to say, under UV or visible light irradiation, the complexes change from the ground state (S0) to the excited states (S1 or T1), the positive charges on the central Ru atom are greatly increased, as if there is a change of oxidation state of Ru from Ru(II) to Ru(III); meanwhile, the positive net charges on the main ligand in the excited states are considerably reduced due to the transfer of some “electron cloud” from central atom Ru(II) to the main-ligand and co-ligands, and thus the interaction between the intercalative ligand and the DNA-base-pairs is considerably weakened. Furthermore, the geometric distortions in the excited states make the higher oxidation state Ru(III) easily form from the complex and thus the quasi-free Ru(III) can further approach the DNA-base-pairs, and oxidize them. Therefore, a theoretical foundation of the photo-induced oxidation-mechanism of DNA-photocleavage by this kind of complex can be offered. The calculated electrochemical data also support such a proposition that the excited complexes possess high oxidization ability.It should be mentioned that the above theoretical explanation is based on the calculations of separate complexes and DNA-base-pairs. In fact, the interaction between DNA-bases and the main ligand of the excited complex is likely to influence the rate of electron transfer between them to a certain extent. However, these systems formed from DNA and Ru(II) complexes are too large to be calculated using the quantum-chemical method at present, therefore, further experimental and theoretical efforts are required to further explore this interesting topic.3.7 Theoretical explanation on the trend in DNA-photocleavage by [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip, p-mopip)It is interesting that the experiments show that the DNA-photocleavage efficiencies (φ) of the three complexes are quite different and follow the order of φ (3) > φ (2) >φ (1). That is to say, the induction of some O-contained substituent (e.g., –OCH3) on the intercalative ligand (pip) will lead the DNA-photocleavage potential to increase, and the improvement of the substituent on the para-site of pip (p-mopip) will be obviously greater than that on the ortho-site (o-mopip). The trend in the different DNA cleavage efficiencies of these complexes can be reasonably explained from the two views of calculated electrochemistry and photochemistry.Firstly, from the view of electrochemistry, the DNA cleavage efficiencies are in good agreement with the calculated electrochemical result. The reduction potentials (E*red) of the excited complexes (2 and 3) are more positive than that of the excited complex 1, and this indicates that their oxidation abilities are increased because of the introduction of –OCH3. It is interesting to find that the trend in the calculated E*red is in line with that in their photocleavage efficiencies (φ). So we can suppose that the oxidation abilities of the excited complexes correlate well with their DNA-photocleavage efficiencies (φ). It has been reported that the reliable oxidation potential of guanine (G) (EG+/G) is 1.29 V (NHE) (1.05 V vs. SCE).67 Our calculated reduction potentials of the excited complexes (1–3) are 0.96–1.03 V (SCE) which are slightly lower than the oxidation potential of the isolated GMP, however, there are some studies which have shown that the calculated oxidation potentials of the stacking G and the G derivatives are much lower than that of the isolated G,68–69 and the site of oxidative damage among the DNA strand has been observed to happen selectively at the 5′-G of the 5′-GG-3′ sequence while a lower frequency appears at the isolated G of the 5′-GA-3′ sequence.70,71 From the calculated electrochemical results, we can predict that the isolated guanine among DNA is not able to be oxidized directly by the excited complexes (1–3), and that the sites of oxidative damage among the DNA strand may appear at those sites having two or more than two G stacks. It should be reasonable to conclude that the excited complexes (1–3) are of selective DNA-photocleavage behavior due to their reduction potential in the excited states which are larger than the oxidation potential of the stacking G, and the DNA-photcleavage efficiencies (φ) follow the order of the reduction potentials of the excited complexes, i.e., E*red (1, 0.966 V) < E*red (2, 1.024 V) < E*red (3, 1.030 V).Secondly, from the view of general photochemistry, according to the Kasha's rule, most photochemical or photo-physical processes usually occur in the lowest singlet excited state or the lowest triplet excited state, due to the faster conversion rates of Sx → S1 and Tx → T1. It is well-established that the lowest triplet excited state mainly originates from the intersystem crossing process (S1 → T1 or S1 → Tx → T1) and this process follows the selection rule of forbidden crossing of (π, π*) → (π, π*) and allowed crossing of (n, π*) → (π, π*) or (π, π*) → (n, π*)72–74 due to spin–orbital interaction. El-Sayed has reported that the presence of (n, π*) states is able to increase the rate of the intersystem crossing process as well as that of the internal conversion processes (Sx → S1 and Tx → T1),73 moreover, the conversion rate of S1(n, π*) → Tx(π, π*) is larger than of that S1(π, π*) → Tx(π, π*) by 103 times and the intersystem crossing process rate sharing the same configuration origin is very slow.72–74Some studies on the ultrafast dynamics of the excited states of the prototype complex [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and its derivatives have shown that the lifetime of the singlet excited state 1MLCT of Ru(II) complexes are ultrashort75–77 and even less than 100 fs; for example, the lifetime of the lowest singlet excited state for [Ru(II)(bpy)3]2+ is in the range of 40 ± 15 fs,75–76 and for complexes [Ru(dmb)3]2+ and [Ru(dpb)3]2+ is ∼120 fs (dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine, dpb = 4,4′-diphenyl-2,2′-bipyridine),77 while the lifetime of the lowest triplet excited state is long-lived and can be several hundreds of nanoseconds17 and even several microseconds.78 It is obvious that the lifetime of the triplet state is much longer than that of the singlet state; moreover, the DNA photocleavage usually happens selectively at the guanine (G) of DNA. So we can consider that, since the major excited complexes do not directly contact with the guanine of DNA, resulting in a decrease in the rate of photo-induced electron transfer, only a minority of the photo-induced electron transfer can effectively occur for the singlet states. Moreover, experimental studies have further found that there are two steps in the formation process of T1, that is, an ultrafast step to form an intermediate state within the lifetime of 1MLCT, and a slow process from the intermediate state to the long-lived T1 state. These two steps occurring in the range of several picoseconds have been differently explained by researchers.75–77 Therefore, it should be accepted that T1 plays a key role in photo-induced oxidation, and thus it should be reasonable to analyze the trend in efficiencies of DNA photocleavage by the three complexes based on the different quantum yields of T1. The excitation energies and the configurations of the lowest singlet excited state and the lowest three triplet excited states are summarized and listed in Table 6 for complexes (1–3), and according to our recent studies on the electronic absorption spectra using the TD-DFT method and the solvent effect considered by the CPCM model,20 these calculated excitation energies in Table 6 are reliable. From Table 6, we can see that, for complex 1, the S1, T1, and T2 mainly come from the transition of d → π*, and T3 comes from the transition of d → π* and π → π*. For complex 2, S1 and T1 mainly come from the transition of d → π*, T2 and T3 come from the transitions of d → π* and π → π* mixed minor n → π*. And for complex 3, S1 and T2 mainly come from the transition of d → π*, while T1 and T3 come from the transitions of d → π* and π → π* mixed with n → π*. From Table 6 and Fig. 3, we can see that the related orbitals of electron transitions in T1 and T3 of complex 3 involve more n(O) component than those in T2 and T3 of complex 2, while the related orbitals of electron transitions for complex 1 have no n-orbital component. As a result, we can draw a conclusion as follows: The major radiationless transition process in the three complexes in the excited state may happen along the path of S1 → T3 → T1 due to their similar component character to the S1 and T1 states, such a path is consistent with the experimental facts that there is an intermediate state during the conversion process from S1 to T1.75–77 However, the rates of intersystem crossing process {S1(π, π*) → Tx(n, π*)} and those of the internal conversion (Tx → T1) are quite different because of the different content of the n(O) orbital in the related triplet excited state (Tx). The higher the n(O) orbital content in Tx, the faster the intersystem crossing process and the internal conversion process (S1 → Tx and Tx → T1) are, the higher the quantum yields of T1 are. Since the n(O) orbital contents (Cn) in Tx for these three complexes are obviously Cn (3) > Cn (2) > Cn (1), the rates (r) of intersystem crossing and internal conversion processes (S1 → Tx → T1) follow the order of r (3) > r (2) > r (1). That is to say, the formation rates (r) of T1 for these three complexes under the same irradiation conditions are r (3) > r (2) > r (1). Though there is a competition between the conversion process ((S1 → Tx → T1) and the relaxation to the lowest singlet state (S1 → S0) due to the high excited-state energy, the quantum yield of T1 also follows the same order: φ′ (3) > φ′ (2) > φ′ (1).

ConclusionsThe experimental results show that the Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes [Ru(bpy)2(L)]2+ (L = pip, o-mopip and p-mopip) can induce considerable DNA-photocleavage, moreover, it is very interesting to find that they have different DNA-photocleavage efficiencies (φ) following the order of φ (1) < φ (2) < φ (3). The theoretical studies on the geometric and electronic structures of the complexes in the ground state (S0), the first singlet excited state (S1) and triplet excited states (T1), as well as the standard redox potentials in solution for their ground state and lowest triplet excited states were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT/TD-DFT), Hartree–Fock and configuration interaction singles (CIS) methods. In addition to the general theoretical explanation of their DNA-photocleavage mechanism from the changes in the charge populations as well as their geometric distortions in the excited states, a further explanation of the trend in their DNA-photocleavage has been carried out, from the views of the calculated electrochemical and photochemical properties. The reduction potential of these excited complexes in aqueous solution were calculated to be 0.966 V for complex 1, 1.024 V for complex 2 and 1.030 V for complex 3, respectively, showing that their reduction potentials in the excited states reach the theoretical range oxidizing some DNA-bases, and obey the order of E*red (1) < E*red (2) < E*red (3). On the other hand, the calculated results show that the quantum yield (φ′) of their lowest triplet states (T1) can be predicted as φ′ (1) < φ′ (2) < φ′ (3), Therefore, the trend in their DNA photocleavage efficiencies (φ), i.e., φ (1) < φ (2) < φ (3), can be reasonably explained.
