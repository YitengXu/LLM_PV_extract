    , Accepted 16th April 2021First published on 4th May 2021AbstractWe use classical non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to investigate the phonon thermal conductivity (PTC) of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) supported stanene. At first, we examine the length dependent PTCs of bare stanene and hBN, and the stanene/hBN heterostructure and realize the dominance of the hBN layer to dictate the PTC in the heterostructure system. Afterward, we assess the length-independent bulk PTCs of these materials. The bulk PTCs at room temperature are found as ∼15.20 W m−1 K−1, ∼550 W m−1 K−1, and ∼232 W m−1 K−1 for bare stanene and hBN, and stanene/hBN, respectively. Moreover, our simulations reveal that bare stanene exhibits a substantially lower PTC compared to bare hBN, and the predicted PTC of stanene/hBN lies between those of stand-alone stanene and hBN. We also found that the PTC obtained for the stanene/hBN system from NEMD simulations nicely agrees with the theoretical formula developed to predict the PTC of heterostructures of two distinct materials. Temperature studies suggest that the PTC of the stanene/hBN heterostructure system follows a decreasing trend with increasing temperature. Additionally, corresponding phonon density of states (PDOS) and phonon dispersion data are provided to comprehensively understand the phonon properties of bare stanene and hBN, and stanene/hBN. Overall, this NEMD study would offer a deep understating towards the PTC of the stanene/hBN heterostructure and would widen the scope of its successful operations in future nanoelectronic, spintronic, and thermoelectric devices.
1. Introduction
The exploration of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has now become an attractive subject of research in the field of nanoelectronics and energy storage systems owing to their specific electrical, magnetic, and optoelectronic properties. In general, van der Waals heterostructures are assembled from layers of two-dimensional (2D) atomically thin materials and the structural properties are closely dependent on the corresponding 2D materials as well as the electrostatic attraction between layers. The weak interactions between the layers make it possible to exfoliate and also offer a lot of versatility to stack a wide range of 2D materials in order to create an artificial heterojunction. In fact, van der Waals heterostructures have emerged as a new paradigm to integrate properties of different materials and hold great promise for novel multifunctional devices with an unprecedented degree of fine-tuning.1,2 The successful isolation of the first honeycomb graphene paved the pathway towards the exploration of the vast unknown realm of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Graphene preserves an extensive spectrum of extraordinary properties, namely extreme charge carrier mobility (≥200000 cm2 V−1 s−1),3 excellent optical transparency,4 useful noise immunity,4 and the highest phonon thermal conductivity among all materials,5 rendering it an unequivocal champion in the kingdom of nanomaterials, and has remained as the hottest topic in condensed matter physics since its discovery. What's more, graphene is the most robust material to date with an incredibly high Young's modulus (YM) of ∼1 TPa6 and recorded fracture strength in the range of ∼120–140 GPa.6 Graphene's semi-metallic behavior, however, makes it unsuitable for semiconductor applications such as field-effect transistors (FETs).7,8 The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in particular seems to be too small to generate a bandgap within the electronic structure, resulting in a low Seebeck coefficient as well as a weak ION/IOFF ratio as contrasted to the circuit operating mode.9,10 Concomitantly, such an inconceivably high room-temperature thermal conductivity of ∼5300 W m−1 K−15 yields an extremely low energy conversion efficiency, and thereby has an inhibitory impact on its thermoelectric applications.10 The ineligibility of graphene into digital electronics and thermoelectrics greased the wheel to pursue the development of convenient alternative honeycombs and their application in mainstream nanotechnology.11–14
In this regard, 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a very promising contender for future nanoelectronics with superior performance and stability that has attracted considerable attention of the research community in recent years by virtue of its abundant exotic properties. 2D-h-BN is a group III–V isomorph of graphene, where each layer portrays a honeycomb crystalline lattice with alternating lattice sites being occupied by nitrogen and boron atoms.15 The highly asymmetric configuration gives rise to a substantially large bandgap of ∼500–600 meV, rendering it an important candidate for electronics and spintronics, like FETs and tunneling devices.15,16 Monolayer hBN inherits a number of fascinating properties including remarkable mechanical robustness (YM ∼ 0.8 TPa),15 excellent thermal conductivity (∼550 W m−1 K−1),17 superior thermal stability (up to ∼1300 K in the air)18 and expansion coefficient (∼3.41 × 10−2 cm−1 K−1), high optical transparency (99% for wavelengths ranging between ∼250 and 900 nm), excellent chemical inertness, a high breakdown field (Vbreakdown ∼ 0.7 V nm−1), dielectric characteristics (ε ∼ 3–4), a low friction coefficient, and so on.15 Especially, it is regarded as one of the most promising substrates to be combined with other functional low dimensional materials in the form of vertical heterostructures. Given most of these special aspects, 2D-hBN is considered to be an outstanding condensed material for next-generation DUV (deep ultraviolet) photonic devices, ultraviolet lasing, piezoelectric actuators and sensors, biomedicine, fuel cells, electronic packaging, dielectric tunneling, nanofillers, photoelectric devices, and many more.15
Recently, stanene, a 2D buckled honeycomb crystalline lattice of tin, has already established itself as a viable competitor to graphene in the world of quantum condensed matter. Exhibiting a puckered topology (∼0.89 Å) and a comparatively heavier atomic mass,19 stanene presents robust spin–orbit-coupling (SOC) sufficient for opening a nontrivial bandgap of ∼300 meV,20 substantially higher than that of graphene (<0.05 meV).21 Such a large bandgap enables stanene and its derivatives to host a wide range of exceptional quantum phenomena including good magnetoresistance,22 excellent spin filter properties,23 quantum thermal transport,24 spectral absorption within the visible and infrared ranges that seems to be exceptional,25 and substantially high hole and electron carrier mobilities such as up to ∼4200 and ∼1590 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.26 Moreover, stanene offers an ideal platform to study the room temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect,27 topological superconductivity, and topological insulating behavior in the same material.28 Further to that, the recent molecular beam epitaxial growth of stanene on the Bi2Te3(111) substrate has been reported to demonstrate metallic features including the large-gap quantum spin Hall (QSH) state near room temperature, which allows dissipation-less superior electrical conductivity that guarantees low-power spintronic devices.29 Importantly, stanene has a significantly lower lattice thermal conductivity of ∼11.9 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K30 owing to its higher atomic mass than other group IV compounds, allowing it to promote excellent thermoelectricity.31 Given such intriguing attributes, stanene has been deemed to be a suitable contender for next-generation high-performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics,32 quantum computing as well as spintronic systems at ambient temperature,26 topological FETs,32 topological insulators, and superconductors,28 and topology-based magnetic, optical, and electronic devices.26 In addition, heterobilayers such as stanene/graphene (stanene/Gr)33 and stanene/MoS234 are documented to display high carrier mobility with a finite bandgap that would further facilitate the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices based on stanene. Moreover, through careful optimization via tuning of the sample size and chemical functionalization, further regulation of the QSH state and thermoelectric performance of stanene could be accomplished, which could increase the contribution of gapless edge states, ultimately improving the transportation of electrons.35,36,38
Importantly, the high thermoelectric efficiency of a device requires not only good electronic conductivity but also limited transportation of phonons. Therefore, the prospect of stanene in thermoelectric applications urges the engineering of the thermal transport features of stanene and its nanostructured materials, viz., nanoribbons. However, the thermal transport properties of stanene have been considerably less investigated compared to the major research concentration on its electrical/semiconductor characteristics. Peng et al.39 measured the lattice thermal conductivity of stanene by integrating both first-principles measurements and the Boltzmann phonon transport equation and achieved a substantially lower thermal conductivity (∼11.6 W m−1 K−1) in the stanene lattice compared to other 2D materials.39 The findings of Peng et al. estimate that stanene is a good candidate with high thermoelectric performance for next-generation thermoelectric/energy conversion devices.39 Cherukara et al.20 recently recommended a bond order potential for stanene and reported the thermal conductivity of monolayer free-standing stanene to be significantly lower than graphene, indicating the effectiveness of stanene as a competitive thermoelectric element.20 In addition to that, some recent literature36,38,40 also provided an in-depth perception of the lattice thermal conductivity of stanene and its nanostructure leveraging classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
On the other side, due to the remarkable electrical, mechanical, thermal, and optical properties, van der Waals heterostructures consisting of two distinct 2D materials have recently attracted great scientific and research interest.35,41 In particular, from van der Waals heterostructures of distinct 2D materials, bandgap engineering, modulation of tensile mechanical properties, and extraordinary transport of charge carriers, new photocatalytic efficiency, and semiconductor band synchronization have been deeply understood.37,41–45 In addition, a variety of ways could be used to change the electrical, tensile and optical properties of such van der Waals heterostructures, which comprise the selection of the stacking material, interlayer size, application of external electrical and magnetic fields and so on.35,42,43,45 In addition, the application of these van der Waals heterostructures has been realized in versatile field-effect transistors, CMOS transistors, photovoltaics (PV solar cells), DNA biosensors, highly sensitive photodetectors, tunneling transistors, various solid-state devices, light-emitting diodes, reaction catalysis, multilevel inverters, and magnetic information storage devices, due to their wide range of specific properties and their tunability.41–43,45 Chen et al.33 thoroughly studied the electronic and optical properties of a graphene-supported stanene heterostructure. It is very interesting to find that the stanene/Gr heterostructure would improve the performance of stanene-based spintronic devices, and have potential applications in photoelectronic devices.33 Besides that, Xiong et al. analyzed bandgap engineering of a MoS2 supported by stanene-based van der Waals heterostructure and found that stanene/MoS2 could be an ideal candidate for high-speed optoelectronic gadgets.34 Recently, Khan et al.35 studied the electronic properties of a stanene/hBN van der Waals heterostructure utilizing first principles calculations and reported that the SOC induced extracted bandgap for free-standing stanene is about ∼69 meV while without SOC stanene is a zero bandgap material.35 Further to that, they demonstrated that these electronic band properties of stanene could be effectively tuned by the stanene/hBN van der Waals heterostructure; in fact, this bandgap of free-standing stanene could be modulated to ∼30 meV without SOC and ∼74 meV, ∼109 meV and ∼90 meV for different stacking patterns of stanene/hBN with SOC.35 They also showed that the electronic carriers of stanene/hBN are expected to transport only through stanene layers, which renders hBN a suitable substrate material for stanene.35
Despite the efforts put forth to investigate the phonon thermal conductivity (PTC) of free-standing stanene and hBN, and the stanene/Gr and stanene/SiC van der Waals heterostructures, to the best of the authors’ knowledge the PTC of stanene/hBN has not been reported so far, thus leaving a research opportunity. In this paper, we have performed NEMD, i.e., non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, to estimate the phonon thermal conductivity of stanene, hBN, and the stanene/hBN heterostructure. The effect of length and temperature on the PTC of stanene/hBN has been comprehensively analyzed with the corresponding phonon density of states (PDOS) and phonon dispersion data.
2. Computational procedure
At first, samples with different lengths of stanene, hBN, and stanene/hBN such as 30 nm, 60 nm, 90 nm, 150 nm, 200 nm, 300 nm, and 400 nm were prepared while the width of these samples was considered as 10 nm throughout the simulations. The lattice mismatch between stanene and hBN is ∼50% (the lattice constant of hBN is ∼2.5 Å, and the lattice constant of stanene is ∼4.95 Å),35 and, in order to minimize this lattice mismatch, we constructed a primary unit cell of stanene/hBN wherein stanene was replicated 2 × 2 times while the unit cell of hBN was replicated 4 × 4 times.35 Then, this primary unit cell of stanene/hBN was used to prepare different samples with varying lengths while keeping the width as 10 nm ensuring that all the supercells experience minimum lattice mismatch, i.e., not more than ∼0.5%.
All the classical NEMD simulations were performed within the LAMMPS46 package and OVITO47 was used for visualization purposes. The Tersoff potential48 was used to define the atomic interactions between boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms in the hBN layer, and the stanene layer was modeled with the Tersoff potential developed by Cherukara et al.20 This potential developed by Cherukara et al. has been utilized for predicting the PTC of a stanene/Gr heterobilayer,37 stanene nanoribbon,38 Si (silicon) and C (carbon) doped stanene nanoribbon,36 and stanene/SiC van der Waals heterostructure.41 The 12-6 Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential was employed to define the interatomic interaction between Sn–B and Sn–N atoms considering a cut-off distance of 10 Å.37,41 Energy parameters and distance units were taken from the Universal Force Field (UFF)49 for MD simulations such as εSn–B = 0.0138 eV, σSn–B = 4.23 Å, εSn–N = 0.00857 eV, and σSn–N = 4.026 Å, where ε and σ portray energy and distance parameters, respectively. The van der Waals thickness of bare hBN and stanene, and the stanene/hBN system was considered as ∼0.34 nm,50 ∼0.45 nm,38 and ∼0.79 nm, respectively, where the van der Waals thickness of the stanene/hBN system was chosen as the sum of the thickness of two individual monolayers, i.e., Sn and hBN layers.51
All the simulations were conducted by applying periodic boundary conditions along the in-plane X and Y directions and a 5 nm vacuum spacing was ensured along the Z-axis in order to suppress the atomic interactions across the periodic boundary. The entire simulation cell was divided into 20 segments which include one heat source and two heat sinks with the same width to ensure heat flow from the source to the sink. After energy minimization using the conjugate gradient (CG) minimization scheme, thermal equilibration simulations were performed under the NVT (constant volume and temperature), NPT (constant pressure and temperature), and NVE (constant volume and energy) ensembles for 200 ps, 500 ps, and 1000 ps, respectively, which ensures minimum residual stress of the system and stabilizes the pressure and temperature as well.1,14,52–54 In order to get a perception of the dynamic stability of the stanene/hBN heterostructure, readers are referred to the movie provided in the ESI† of this article. An MD time step of 1 fs had been used to conduct all the simulations. Three samples with different initial velocity seeds were chosen for each data point to address the errors stemming from thermal fluctuation during the NEMD simulations, and corresponding errors were added to the plots.
After ensuring the steady-state conditions of the system from the energy, temperature and pressure data with varying time domain, we provided a specific amount of heat/thermal energy to the heat source under the NVE ensemble simulation procedure and removed the same amount of thermal energy from the heat sink by continuing the simulation for 500 ps. We implemented the Nose–Hoover thermal bath technique utilizing the NVE integration technique to swap heat energy between the heat source and the heat sinks, in order to obtain an equilibrium condition. We carried out the simulation for another 1000 ps to obtain temperature gradients from the time-averaged temperature profiles of the nanosheet.
The PTC had been anticipated from Fourier's law of conduction, (1)Herein, j represents the heat flux and can be expressed as , where  refers to the resulting heat current towards a specific direction; A is the area of the cross-section of the nanosheet, and k represents the PTC. Moreover, in the presented work, we used the method of heat flux control to simulate the NEMD, and more perceptions about the NEMD can be found in ref. 55.
With a view to determining the reliability of the force field and computational strategy, our derived bulk PTC is evaluated against existing literature, which is summarized in the table below (Table 1).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 PTC of free-standing stanene and hBN, and the stanene/hBN heterostructure
The PTC is one of the most important parameters to determine the energy conversion efficiency, viz., the thermoelectric performance of 2D materials. Numerous studies have been carried out on the thermal properties of stanene monolayers40,57 and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)48,58 as mentioned earlier. From these studies, the PTC of a free-standing hBN monolayer has been found to be substantially higher than a bare stanene monolayer. Recently, the heterostructure of stanene/hBN has drawn considerable attention of the scientific community.35 Herein, we provided a thorough understanding of the PTC of a free-standing stanene monolayer, a free-standing hBN monolayer, and the hetero-bilayer structure of stanene/hBN. Fig. 2 portrays the steady-state temperature profile of the stanene/hBN heterostructure considering a length of 400 nm. We treated only the linear segments of the temperature profile to compute the temperature gradients because of the presence of non-linear regions in the vicinity of the hot and cold bins resulting from the high inelastic scattering in the respective bins; such an approach is frequently used in NEMD simulations.59–61 Note that in order to compute the temperature gradient, i.e., the slope of the temperature profile, both sides of the temperature profile were considered and finally an average value was taken. The reason for the asymmetric temperature profile is due to the fact of periodic boundary conditions. As mentioned earlier, the entire simulation cell has been divided into 20 segments/bins with the same width including one heat source at the 11th bin, and one heat sink at the 1st bin (Fig. 1); due to periodic boundary conditions a second heat sink of the same width has been established at the outer edge of the simulation domain (21st bin), and the temperature of that bin is not present in the temperature profile.

It is known that in a confined width the phonon behavior is greatly affected by the system's length. To understand the length dependency of the in-plane PTC, we varied the length from 30 nm to 400 nm by fixing the width of the system as 10 nm to minimize the size effect.41 From Fig. 3, we confirm that the PTC of the hBN monolayer is much higher than the stanene monolayer. These results convey the message that higher energy is needed for the hBN monolayer than is needed for the stanene monolayer to maintain the desired temperature of the reservoirs.41 The substantially lower PTC of monolayer stanene compared to hBN could be further attributed to the high atomic mass of tin (∼118 a.m.u) atoms compared to boron (10 a.m.u) and nitrogen (14 a.m.u) atoms, and also owing to the larger interatomic bond length of stanene (∼0.286 nm) contrasted to hBN (∼0.145 nm), elevated buckling height of stanene (∼0.086 nm) compared to hBN (planar), lower in-plane Young's modulus of stanene (∼23 GPa) than hBN (∼750 GPa), high group velocity of hBN compared to stanene, and lower Debye temperature of stanene compared to hBN.
 Fig. 3  Variations of the PTC of free-standing stanene and hBN, and the stanene/hBN heterostructure with varying length at 300 K. 
When the system's length was varied from 30 nm to 400 nm, the PTC of monolayer stanene and hBN and the stanene/hBN heterostructure was enhanced from ∼2.7 W m−1 K−1 to ∼11.2 W m−1 K−1, ∼83 W m−1 K−1 to ∼445 W m−1 K−1, and ∼40 W m−1 K−1 to ∼202 W m−1 K−1, respectively. From Fig. 3, it is also evident that the PTC increases monotonically with increasing length and later becomes about flat in slope. This observation can be attributed to the interplay between the reduction of phonon-boundary scattering and the augmentation of the Umklapp scattering process. When the system's length is smaller than the MFP of the phonons, the thermal transport process is ballistic in nature.41,48,62 In this case, the PTC increases rapidly with increasing system length as more excited phonons take part in the thermal transport process and the relative contribution of the boundary scattering process decreases. However, when the system length exceeds the MFP of the phonons, thermal transport becomes diffusive, and the presence of a large number of excited phonons results in considerable phonon–phonon anharmonic interactions (i.e., the Umklapp process).41,62 Consequently, the rate of increment of the PTC with increasing length reduces. Similar phenomena were also reported for monolayer graphene,62 monolayer stanene,41 monolayer 2D-SiC,41,48 the stanene/2D-SiC heterostructure,41 bilayer germanene,63 the stanene/silicene heterostructure,64 and a stanene bilayer.64 The results for monolayer stanene and monolayer hBN are compared with previous reports of Ahammed et al.41 and Tabarraei et al.,48 respectively, as manifested in Fig. 3. The minor deviations could stem from the computational technique and the uncertainty of the MD trajectories.65
Next, we predicted the PTC of the stanene/hBN heterostructure. Since the heat flux of the heterostructure is equal to the summation of the heat flux of the stanene monolayer and hBN monolayer, it is quite straightforward to find the PTC of the heterostructure. The prediction method is formulated by Liu et al.66 wherein the heat flux generated by a stable temperature can be written as, JAJB = JSnASn + JhBNAhBN(2)where J = −k·∇T, J stands for the heat flux density, k stands for the PTC and ∇T represnts the temperature gradient. Subscript B indicates the stanene/hBN heterostructure system, and A represents the cross-sectional area of the nanosheet = t × d. Here, t is the thickness, and d specifies the width of the system. It is worth mentioning that eqn (2) is only applicable when the two monolayers have strong distinct PTC values. This equation is not valid for a system when the bilayers consist of the same material.
From eqn (2) we can write, kB∇TBtBdB = kSn∇TSntSndSn + khBN∇ThBNthBNdhBN(3)
The temperature gradient is almost the same for the stanene monolayer, the hBN monolayer, and the hetero-bilayer. Additionally, all the systems have the same width (d). Therefore, eqn (3) can be reduced as, (4)
The calculated ratio of  when the length of the system is 30 nm and 400 nm is ∼0.044 and ∼0.033, respectively. This indicates that the bilayer PTC follows mostly the trend of the hBN monolayer with a variation of the length compared to the stanene monolayer. We also found that the predicted PTC of the heterostructure nicely conforms to the results achieved by NEMD calculations (Fig. 3).
We further calculate the length-independent bulk PTC using Matthiessen's rule represented by,40 (5)where k and L indicate the PTC and the length of the system, respectively. Additionally, k∞ represents the thermal conductivity of the system with infinite length and l is the length of the effective MFP of phonons. We fitted the inverse PTC of all aforementioned materials with the inverse length as demonstrated in Fig. 4. The calculated k∞ values for the stanene monolayer, hBN monolayer, and stanene/hBN composite from NEMD simulations are ∼15.20 W m−1 K−1, ∼550 W m−1 K−1, and ∼232 W m−1 K−1, respectively. The predicted bulk PTC of the heterostructure is ∼215 W m−1 K−1, which is in excellent agreement with the NEMD result. The marginal deviations could be attributed to the inelastic phonon scattering in the proximity of the sink and the source and the stochastic nature of classical MD simulations.41 A similar kind of insignificant deviation has also been reported for the stanene/SiC41 heterostructure. Note that our MD simulation results suggest that the PTC of the stanene/hBN system is ∼16 times higher than monolayer stanene and ∼2.4 times lower than monolayer hBN, indicating the dominance of hBN in the heterostructure system, which is in accordance with previously reported literature for the stanene/SiC41 and stanene/Gr37 heterostructure systems.

The phonon properties of the stanene/hBN heterostructure have been modified due to the van der Waals interaction between the stanene and hBN monolayers, and thus the interface coupling factor appears in this framework. Hence, a new scattering path is generated, and its thermal transportation is restricted. Importantly, more phase-space becomes active to generate rough scattering.63 Therefore, the PTC of the stanene/hBN system is lower than the hBN monolayer, which is in good agreement with previous studies.41 For instance, Ahammed et al. reported the length independent PTC of stanene, SiC, and stanene/SiC to be ∼13.79 W m−1 K−1, ∼151 W m−1 K−1, and ∼66 W m−1 K−1, respectively, at room temperature.41 Further to that, leveraging a combination of the second-generation REBO potential (for Gr), Tersoff (for stanene), and Lennard-Jones potential (for the interlayer interaction), for infinite length, Hong et al. predicted the PTC of stanene, Gr, and stanene/Gr as ∼13.4 W m−1 K−1, ∼685 W m−1 K−1, and ∼311 W m−1 K−1, respectively, at room temperature.67 Note that the reported PTC of Gr is found to be in a wide range of values, which could be due to the difference in the computational technique, i.e., EMD or NEMD, the difference in interatomic potentials, and so on. These results corresponding to the PTC of the stanene/SiC and stanene/Gr heterostructure systems are in excellent agreement with our projected PTC of the stanene/hBN heterostructure, indicating the dominance of Gr, hBN, and SiC, and subjugation of stanene in the composite.41,67 Based on these results, it could be commented that low dimensional materials with a planer honeycomb structure and comparably lower interatomic bond length, such as Gr (bond length, ∼0.142 nm), hBN (bond length, ∼0.145 nm), and SiC (bond length, ∼0.180 nm), demonstrate a substantially high PTC compared to buckled structures such as stanene. It is reported that the interface interaction strength scaling factor, χ, affects the PTC of the heterostructure,66 and the effect of the scaling factor on the PTC of stanene/hBN has been added to the ESI† of this article.
Phonons are the main heat energy carriers for 2D materials.41 Therefore, it is very important to investigate the phonon spectra to understand the thermal transportation capability of materials clearly. We calculated the phonon density of states (PDOS) from the fast Fourier transformation of the atomic velocity auto-correlation function (VACF). The PDOS equation can be expressed in terms of the VACF41 (6)where the phonon density of states G(ω) is a function of frequency ω. Here, v〈0〉 represents the initial velocity of an atom, and v〈t〉 indicates the velocity of the particular atom after a particular time interval t.41
The phonon power spectrum reveals a way to understand how much energy is carried by phonons in a system. In PDOS analysis, both the frequency range and amplitude of the peaks could be taken into consideration. A higher value of the PDOS shows that a phonon occupies a higher state at a particular ‘ω’, whereas zero value means no existence of a phonon at that particular frequency of the system. From Fig. 5, we could perceive that in the hBN monolayer, phonon states are activated in a 0–50 THz frequency range and the highest peaks are observed at ∼17 THz and ∼47 THz, which shows nice agreement with previously reported literature.48 Note that the frequency range and peak frequency for hBN anticipated from our studies are marginally lower than graphene, which displays a frequency range of 0–60 THz and a peak at ∼50 THz.37 On the contrary, in the stanene monolayer, the frequency range is 0–10 THz and two noticeable peak frequencies are observed at around ∼1.5 THz and ∼6 THz having lower amplitude than the hBN monolayer, which is in good agreement with previously reported literature for stanene.36,37 Therefore, the free-standing hBN monolayer shows a much higher PTC than the free-standing stanene monolayer and it is obvious from the PDOS profile that the heterostructure system of stanene/hBN would reduce the PTC of the free-standing hBN monolayer. However, in the stanene/hBN heterostructure, the phonon states are a combination of the states of both the free-standing stanene monolayer and the free-standing hBN monolayer. From the characteristic PDOS profile of the stanene/hBN heterostructure, it could be inferred that, when stanene is supported by hBN, the peak in the PDOS profile of hBN is damped out, which eventually reduces the mean free path and phonon group velocity of the composite, and thus a lower PTC of the stanene/hBN system has been realized. Note that the characteristic PDOS profile of stanene/hBN is identical to that of monolayer stanene and hBN, which alludes to the fact that PTC of stanene/hBN would lie between the PTC of the individual monolayers. Moreover, to utilize these aforementioned materials as thermoelectric materials, the size of the system should be kept as small as possible, i.e., nanostructuring, since the thermoelectric efficiency of a device is inversely proportional to the PTC of the assembled materials, viz., .

Next, we have computed the phonon dispersion relation of hBN, stanene, and stanene/hBN at 300 K utilizing the dynamic matrix calculated from the fix phonon code developed by Kong et al.,68–70 where complete anharmonic phonon calculations are performed. Then MD trajectories are used to compute the coefficient of the Green function, and then, utilizing the Green function, the dynamic matrix and the dispersion relations are obtained. To get more perception of the computational technique of phonon dispersion relations, readers are referred to the previous study in ref. 14. The hBN monolayer contains two different atoms (B and N) in a primitive cell, whereas, in the stanene monolayer, there are two identical atoms per unit cell. Fig. 6 depicts no existence of imaginary modes in the entire Brillouin zone both for hBN and stanene, and stanene/hBN, suggesting dynamic stability for all the samples,64 and, in addition, three acoustic (LA, TA, and ZA) and three optical phonon branches (LO, TO and ZO) are generated in the phonon dispersion curves. Therefore, our used potential is capable of accurately calculating the interactions among these atoms.

The hBN monolayer has a relatively smaller atomic mass difference between the boron atom (10 a.m.u) and the nitrogen atom (14 a.m.u) while stanene is monoatomic. This guides a small bandgap between the acoustic and optical phonon modes in both the hBN and stanene monolayers. Therefore, the degeneracy of the ZA and ZO phonon modes is lifted at high symmetry line K in the Brillouin zone. The phonon dispersion curve presented in Fig. 6 has good agreement with experimental and theoretical studies of hBN and stanene monolayers.39,57,71–73 Additionally, Levinshtein et al.74 suggest that the ZA phonon mode has the least contribution among all acoustic phonon modes in the total thermal conductivity of the material. Fig. 6 clearly illustrates that all phonon modes, i.e., longitudinal acoustic (LA), transverse acoustic (TA), and also flexural acoustic (ZA), are much higher in the hBN than the stanene monolayer. For the hBN monolayer, the LA phonon mode at high symmetry line K is ∼26 THz, whereas in the stanene monolayer it is computed as ∼3 THz. This suggests a higher thermal conductivity for the hBN monolayer than the stanene monolayer. Furthermore, the phonon group velocity at each point of wave vector ‘q’ in specific branch ‘s’ can be calculated by  where ‘Vg’ represents the phonon group velocity and ωs is the phonon frequency at a specific branch. Fig. 6 suggests that the phonon group velocity of hBN is much higher compared to that of stanene. The smaller group velocity of stanene is attributed to its lower Debye temperature (∼72 K)57 stemming from the higher atomic mass and weaker bonding. Therefore, due to the lower group velocity of phonons, stanene shows much lower thermal conductivity than hBN. For the Sn/hBN heterostructure, the frequencies at a high symmetry line lie between those of the bare hBN and stanene monolayers. The LA phonon mode at high symmetry line K is computed as ∼11 THz for the stanene/hBN heterostructure. It is noteworthy that the dominance of hBN in the phonon dispersion relation is quite evident; also, the dispersion relation of the heterostructure is almost identical to that of hBN. The dispersion relation of stanene/hBN further clarifies our aforementioned findings, i.e., the PTC of stanene/hBN should lie between the PTC of bare stanene and hBN and the dominance of hBN in the heterostructure system. Such a drop in the phonon mode of hBN due to the addition of stanene at the high symmetry point can be attributed to the weak van der Waals interaction between the two monolayers as reported earlier.75
3.2 Temperature-dependent PTC of the stanene/hBN heterostructure
2D materials are considered as the most promising building blocks for advanced electronic devices.76–78 Interestingly, the phonon transportation behavior is highly affected by temperature. For this purpose, the effect of temperature on the PTC of stanene/hBN has been analyzed in a wide range of temperature, where the temperature has been varied from 100 K to 700 K, and the size of the system has been considered as 400 nm × 10 nm. The PTC of the system is decreased from ∼332 W m−1 K−1 to ∼67 W m−1 K−1 when the temperature is increased from 100 K to 700 K and corresponding results are provided in Fig. 7(a). This type of inverse pattern with temperature has been seen in many previous studies of heterostructures.37,41 Ahammed et al. reported that the PTC of the stanene/SiC heterostructure decreases from ∼70 W m−1 K−1 to ∼24.81 W m−1 K−1 when the temperature increases from 100 K to 700 K.41 Also, the PTC decays from ∼365 W m−1 K−1 to ∼50 W m−1 K−1 for the stanene/Gr heterostructure system67 and ∼9 W m−1 K−1 to ∼2 W m−1 K−1 for a stanene/silicene bilayer64 with increasing temperature from 100 K to 600 K, which is in good agreement with our results regarding the temperature dependency of the PTC. Low-frequency phonons make a significant contribution in transporting thermal energy within 2D nanomaterials, but at elevated temperatures low frequency phonons are reduced.41 At high temperatures, high-frequency phonons mainly dominate and therefore phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering occurs.41 This creates a restriction on phonon thermal transportation. The inverse relation of the PTC with increasing temperature could be further attributed to the lower phonon group velocity at high temperature. The PTC can be calculated by the following kinetic formula,41 k = Cvl(7)where k represents the PTC of materials, C is the specific heat, v portrays the average phonon velocity, and l is the mean free path (MFP).41 Above the Debye temperature the specific heat becomes constant. In this situation, a three phonon anharmonic process gives l ∝ 1/T;79,80 in other words, the MFP is decreasing with increasing temperature due to phonon–phonon scattering. We observe this inverse trend for the stanene/hBN heterostructure presented in Fig. 7(a). To obtain a better perception of the effect of temperature on the PTC, the characteristic PDOS profile of stanene/hBN has been provided at 300 K and 600 K in Fig. 7(b). Though the PDOS profile is identical at 300 K and 600 K, nevertheless, the amplitude of the vibration has been seen to be damped out, which further confirms the decay relation of the PTC with temperature. A similar trend in the PDOS profile with temperature has been reported for other low dimensional materials such as SiC and stanene/SiC heterostructure systems.41,81

4. Conclusions
In summary, the present study offers a comprehensive characterization of the PTC of the stanene/hBN vertical heterostructure from molecular dynamics simulation. The Tersoff potential is utilized to model the hBN and stanene monolayers, while the interlayer van der Waals interaction is defined according to the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. First, to study the length-dependent PTC, the lengths of each of the monolayers along with their heterostructure are varied from 30 nm to 400 nm, keeping their widths fixed at 10 nm. For all the lengths, the hBN nanosheet exhibited a substantially higher PTC than the stanene nanosheet, whereas the PTC of the heterostructure lies between them. Also, the PTC of the hBN, stanene, and stanene/hBN nanosheets is found to be a strong function of the nanosheet length. To analyze the effect of temperature on the PTC of the stanene/hBN system, the temperatures are varied from 100 K to 700 K, and a negative correlation between temperature and PTC has been discerned. With a view to understanding the phonon thermal transport mechanism profoundly, PDOS profiles are also calculated for hBN, stanene, and the stanene/hBN heterostructure. When stanene is aided by hBN, the peak in the PDOS profile of hBN is dampened out, ultimately reducing the mean free path as well as the phonon group velocity of hBN, and thereby a lower PTC of stanene/hBN has been realized. To validate the thermodynamic stability of the structures, phonon dispersion curves are plotted along the high symmetry directions of the first Brillouin zone, which manifests excellent conformity with our aforementioned results. We envisage that the comprehensive characterization of the PTC of the stanene/hBN heterostructure offered in this study will shed light on the successful implementation and efficient operation of the heterostructure in functional devices, which can be an excellent contender for next-generation energy-efficient nanodevices.
