    , Accepted 5th February 2020First published on 13th February 2020AbstractA novel graphene-Ba2Cu8Ni2Se12 catalyst with CoS nanospheres (GBC) was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method for use as a counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In this work, Ba2Cu8Ni2Se12 (BCNS) and CoS nanospheres were directly grown on graphene sheets showing strong interactions. The morphology and electrochemical and photovoltaic performances of GBC were studied. The GBC CE in bifacial DSSCs showed higher power conversion efficiency (12.37%), which is comparable to that of a traditional Pt electrode (4.07%). This result shown that the synergistic effects of the GBC structure provides a large catalytic active area and an excellent electron transfer pathway. The GBC CE exhibits good device performance and can serve as a low-cost CE as compared to Pt in the DSSCs.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are devices that directly convert sunlight into electricity via the photoelectric effect.1 These photovoltaic devices are attracting attention from researchers as well as industries due to their low fabrication cost, ease of assembly, optical properties, and high power conversion efficiency. A typical DSSC device is structurally composed of a photoactive mesoporous semiconductor such as TiO2 and ZnO (photoanode); a counter electrode (CE) made of either a metal or semiconductor (photocathode); and an electrolyte.2 When the dye is sensitized by sunlight, the high energy causes excitation of the free electrons, leading to the oxidation of the dye. Next, the excited electrons are injected into the conduction band of the photoanode. These electrons in the semiconductor then follow an external path to the counter electrode. Finally, the electrons are collected by the electrolyte at the CE to regenerate the oxidized dye molecules.3,4
The CE plays a crucial role in a DSSC as it collects electrons from the external circuit and catalyzes the redox electrolyte. The basic requirements for an efficient CE include good electrocatalytic activity, stability, and charge transport properties. Traditionally, Pt has been the first choice as CE in a DSSC due to its catalytic activity toward the iodide/tri-iodide redox couple, but its high-cost and inefficient activity toward other redox couples have necessitated the search for a Pt-free CE.5 Therefore, this study aims to identify a new CE that can meet certain energy goals in order to achieve the highest efficiency of energy conversion.
Graphene is the basic structural unit found in all sorts of conductive carbon materials. It has been extensively used as a component in photovoltaic devices due to its low cost along with the fact that it provides high catalytic activity with good chemical stability in iodine-based redox couples.6 However, it has a limited number of active sites towards the reduction of I3− in redox species. Therefore, the hybrids of graphene with transition metal materials including metal oxides have been designed as CEs for DSSCs.7 For example, quaternary-based selenide materials are excellent candidates as CEs for further improving efficiency and adaptability due to their useful physicochemical properties, high electrochemical stability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. The synergistic effects generated by different components of the hybrid materials can also be utilized.8,9 Therefore, they have been widely applied in numerous devices such as supercapacitors, fuel cells, and lithium-ion batteries. However, to date, no applications have been reported on the quaternary Ba2Cu8Ni2Se12 functional materials as counter electrodes for DSSCs.
In order to improve the efficiency of a cell, one could enhance the optical absorption of the CE structures in the visible light range by modifying of counter electrode by hybridizing of metal sulfides. Cobalt sulfide (CoS) spherical nanoparticles have attracted substantial attention as CEs because of their excellent catalytic activity, high absorption coefficients, numerous active sites, and relatively lower price.10 Lin et al. investigated the use of a treated CoS CE as a Pt-free DSSC, which showed excellent catalytic activity towards the triiodide redox reaction with a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 7.16%.11 Hence, in this study, a facile hydrothermal reaction method was used to synthesize graphene-Ba2Cu8Ni2Se12 with CoS nanospheres (GBC) as a CE for DSSCs. In terms of electrocatalytic performance, CoS provided numeorus active sites, leading to a greater photoelectrical conversion efficiency of about 12.37%. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and solar simulation results indicate that the GBC possessed excellent electrocatalytic activity for I3−/I− to shuttle the reduction reaction. This shows that the novel GBC is promising due to its improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to traditional Pt CEs.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Preparation and characterization of GBC
The simple preparation of the GBC film CE for DSSCs has been schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. First, the GBC nanomaterial was prepared via a previously established hydrothermal process. It was then coated by a doctor blade method. Finally, the GBC thin film was used as a CE in the assembly of a standard DSSC. In order to characterize the morphology and crystalline structure of the GBC thin film, a thicker film was prepared for XRD, EDX, SEM, and TEM measurements, results of which are shown in Fig. 2((a)–(d)), respectively.

 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of GBC nanoparticles, (b) EDX pattern of GBC nanoparticles, (c) SEM image and (d) TEM image of GBC nanoparticles. 
The XRD diffraction peaks at 22.3°, 27.4°, 32.6°, 42.2°, and 51.7° indexed to the (101), (111), (006), (101), and (012) planes, respectively, were confirmed to be the peaks of BCNS. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2(a), typical powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) identified the obtained material as CoS nanospheres. The diffraction peaks can be observed at 33.5°, 35.2°, 47.5°, and 55.1°, and these are assigned to the (100), (002), (102), and (112) planes, respectively, of CoS (JCPDS No. 65-8977).13,14 This data indicated the existence of only CoS in the as-prepared sample. The EDX pattern exhibited the presence of Ba, Cu, Ni, Se, Co, S, C, and O elements of GBC nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The deposited GBC exhibited a nanosphere morphology of CoS with a thickness of ∼20 nm and coarse BCNS attached to graphene sheets, as shown in Fig. 2(c). Fig. 2(d) shows a homogeneous dispersion of dark dots, indicating that the CoS nanospheres were highly confined and uniformly dispersed on the graphene sheets. Moreover, BCNS shows ruggedness on the graphene surface.
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the GBC nanocomposite were measured to evaluate the surface area, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The adsorption and desorption isotherms exhibit hysteresis loops and15 the shapes of the hysteresis loops reveal type IV isotherm of the mesoporous structure of the GBC composite. The BET specific surface area (SBET) of the GBC composite was calculated to be 110 m2 g−1. A larger specific surface area of the GBC composite provided more number of adsorption–reaction active sites for the tri-iodide redox reaction. Moreover, Fig. 3(a) (inset) presents the BJH pore-size distributions of the GBC. It shows a narrow pore-size distribution and exhibits a peak at approximately 2–5 nm, which confirms the presence of mesopores in the obtained sample.

To confirm the bandgap energy of BNCS, GB, and GBC CE, the differential reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was used. As seen in Fig. 3(b), the absorbances of BNCS, GB, and GBC in the UV range between 200 and 800 nm have been significantly improved and the absorption edges have been shifted to the UV-visible region. According to the Kubelka–Munk equation,16 the band gaps of BNCS, GB, and GBC were determined to be 3.25 eV, 2.90 eV, and 2.45 eV, respectively. The GBC exhibit a lower bandgap energy, which serves as an excellent electron transfer pathway in the cell.
The Raman spectra of BNCS, GB, and GBC are shown in (Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S.3, ESI†). From Fig. 3(c), two peaks can be observed at around 1350 cm−1 and 1537 cm−1 in the GBC spectrum, which confirm that these are D peaks for metal transitions, and respectively correspond to the D peak associated with edge defects and the G peak associated with hexagonal graphite.17 For BNCS, the identification of these dominant peaks between 50 and 500 cm−1 provides a characteristic spectral fingerprint for the detection of these crystalline phases. Moreover, Fig. 3(d) shows the magnetization loops of the nanocomposite powder at room temperature. The saturation magnetization value (Ms) for the nanocomposite powder was found to be 50.23 emu g−1, indicating that the GBC is of superparamagnetic type. The GBC nanocomposites allow the spin direction. The GBC nanocomposites allow the spin direction property, the reversal of the current takes place in the device itself when the electrons created by light interact with the magnetic contacts whose spins have been ordered. Therefore, the use of magnetic electrodes increases the efficiency of the photovoltaic cells.
Further information regarding the composition and electronic states of the elements present in the GBC nanocomposite was obtained by the XPS analysis (Fig. 4(a)–(d)). The existence of Ba, Cu, Ni, Se, Co, S, C, and O in the GBC composite was confirmed by the survey spectra, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The high-resolution spectra of Ba 3d, Cu 2p, and Se 3d were obtained by fitting with peak sum and background to obtain the specific peak positions and oxidation states of the elements. In the high-resolution spectrum of Ba 3d (Fig. 4(b)), the peak at 775.1 eV was attributed to the binding energies of the Ba 3d5/2 in Ba–Cu.18 The Cu 2p3/2 spectrum (Fig. 4(c)) has several wavy peaks in which the signal at 933.7 eV can be attributed to the presence of Cu2+. The XPS spectrum of Se 3d presented in Fig. 3d shows the characteristic peaks of the Se 3d binding energy at 62.56, indicating the formation of selenide species by binding with the Ni atoms.19,20

In addition, the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks at binding energies of 795 and 780 eV, respectively, are attributed to the deposited CoS shell, and the result is completely consistent with that of the previous reports, as shown in Fig. 4(e and f). These results indicate the successful synthesis of the BCNS composite for GBS.
2.2 Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The photovoltaic performances of the CoS, GB, and GBC CE-assembled devices were examined using a solar simulator (AM 1.5). The obtained photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5(a), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Notably, all three CEs exhibit excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In particular, the GBC CE showed remarkable photovoltaic performance with irradiation (Jsc = 26.20 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.70 V, FF = 67.47, and PCE = 12.37%). The GBC CE exhibits better performance than Pt CE due to the synergistic catalytic effects between BCNS or CoS with graphene sheets, which can enhance the electrocatalytic ability of the cell.21,22 Moreover, the hybrid CoS acts as a bridge catalytic active center, supplying abundant active sites towards the reduction of tri-iodide; however, BNCS is acting as a fast conductivity platform, facilitating charge-transfer. In addition, the graphene sheets introduced into the structure also play a role in catalyzing I3− reduction.23,24

2.3 Electrochemical characterization
As one of the most important components in DSSC, the role of the counter electrode is to reduce the redox species used as mediators in regenerating the sensitizer after the electron injection. Fig. 5(b) shows the Nyquist plots for CoS, GB, and GBC CEs. The equivalent circuit, shown in the inset, is used to fit the experimental EIS data. The results show that the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) values are 10.50, 9.40, and 12.50 Ω for CoS, GB, and GBC, respectively, which indicated that the GBC CE showed faster interfacial charge transfer than CoS and GB. As shown in Table 2, the series resistance (Rs) values for the DSSCs with CoS, GB, and GBC are 7.01, 6.10, and 3.60 Ω, respectively, indicating that all the materials showed better catalytic activity than traditional Pt.25

The relatively low Rct and Rs for the CoS, GB, and GBC nanocomposite nanosphere electrodes could result in reduction in total resistance, indicating enhanced catalytic performance for the triiodide reduction.26 These improvements in catalytic activity and conductivity could be attributed to the increased number of active sites on CoS nanosphere, as this would effectively accelerate the transfer of electrons collected from the external circuit as well as promote the reduction of triiodide, thus contributing to the improved photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
3 Experimental
3.1 Materials
Natural graphite powder, hydrochloric acid (ACS reagent, 37%), ethanol (ACS reagent purity ≥99.5%), sulfuric acid (ACS reagent, 95–98%), and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O) and thiourea (CH4N2S) were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All reagents were used directly without further purification. TiO2 powder (P 25, Degussa) and Ru complex dye (N719) were used for the fabrication of DSSCs.
3.2 Synthesis of graphene sheets (GO) and cobalt sulfides (CoS) nanosphere
Graphene oxide was synthesized following a modified Hummers' method12 starting with natural graphite powder. First, 5 g of graphite was loaded into 100 mL of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) concentrate under continuous stirring at freeze temperature. Then, 30 g of KMnO4 was slowly added into the mixture solution, and the temperature was increased to 100 °C for 30 min. Finally, ∼10 mL of H2O2 was added to the mixture, and the mixing continued for 60 min. After cooling it to room temperature, the solution was washed several times with 100 mL of ethanol before being dried at 80 °C for 8 h.
The CoS nanospheres were synthesized via a hydrothermal process. First, CoCl2·6H2O (1 g) powder and thiourea (0.65 g) were dissolved in 50 mL of DI water under vigorous stirring at room temperature for 1 h. Next, the mixture solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 8 h. After the autoclave cooled down, the black precipitate was collected and washed five times with DI water and ethanol. Further, the CoS samples were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h.
3.3 Synthesis of quaternary Ba2Cu8Ni2Se12 nanoparticles (BCNS)
In the hydrothermal process, the precursors taken in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1:1:4 (Ba:Cu:Ni:Se) were first added to 100 ml of ethylene glycol (EG) in a beaker and stirred for 30 min to homogenize the solution.10 Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon liner and kept at 200 °C for 15 h. After cooling it down, the precipitate was washed with ethanol, and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to remove any impurities from the process. Finally, the precipitate was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h to obtain Ba2Cu8Ni2Se12 nanoparticles.
3.4 Synthesis of graphene-Ba2Cu8Ni2Se12 with CoS (GBC)
The GBC nanoparticles were synthesized via the same method. First, 2 g of GO and 0.5 g of CoS were dissolved in 50 ml ethanol under ultrasonication for 1 h. Then, 0.5 g of BCNS was added to the solution to form a homogeneous solution. Following 3 h of ultrasonication, the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. Through this process, a black precipitate of GBC was obtained. Finally, the mixture solution was washed with ethanol three times, and then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 10 h.
3.5 Fabrication of the GBC and assembly of DSSCs
The GBC paste was prepared by mixing 0.5 g of GBC powder and 5 ml of ethanol. Next, the paste was coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (5 mm × 5 mm) using the doctor blade technique. The films were then dried at 80 °C for 30 min. In order to prepare the TiO2 photoanode, 3.6 g TiO2 powder (P 25, Degussa) was added to 10 ml of ethanol. Next, TiO2 slurry was coated on the FTO substrate via the same technique. These films were then sintered at 450 °C for 60 min, and the sintered mesoporous films were subsequently soaked in a solution having 0.3 mM of N719 dye for 24 h. This dye-adsorbed mesoporous TiO2 film was used as the photoanode. Finally, DSSCs were assembled by sandwiching the photoanode and GBC-based CE. A Surlyn spacer (gasket) of size ∼60 mm was placed between the electrodes. A drop of an iodide-based liquid electrolyte was then introduced into the spacer area until the space was homogeneously filled with the liquid.
3.6 Characterization
The phases and crystalline structures were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE, Germany; CuKα, λ = 0.15418 nm). The magnetic properties were measured using a magnetometer (VSM, HH-2, Nanjing Nanda Instrument Co., Ltd, China). The BET surface area was calculated from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measured using a PMI BET sorptometer (BET-201AEL-2OSEL, USA). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the samples were obtained using a solar cell measurement system (FYTRONIX OPTOSENSE).
4 Conclusions
In summary, a novel graphene-Ba2Cu8Ni2Se12 with CoS nanospheres (GBC) was successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method for use as a counter electrode in DSSCs. The hybrid material of GBC exhibited superior catalytic activity due to the synergistic effects of the structure. The power conversion efficiency using GBC was 12.37%, which was substantially higher than that of the traditional Pt electrode. The high efficiency of GBC composites can be attributed to the synergistic effects of hybrid BCNS/CoS and graphene, which can provide more number of active reaction sites and reduce the charge transfer resistance to prevent carrier interfacial recombination. Moreover, a series of electrochemical property analyses demonstrated that the GBC composites exhibited a better catalytic ability than Pt. Therefore, the GBC CE shows promise as an alternative CE material for DSSCs and other applications.
