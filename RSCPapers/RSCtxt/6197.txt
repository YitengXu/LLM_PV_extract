    , Accepted 21st January 2011First published on 10th February 2011AbstractThrough the esterification of an acyl chloride functionalized fullerene precursor with dendritic alcohol, a fullerene-rich dendron containing a norbornene unit at the focal point is prepared for ring-opening metathesis polymerization to obtain its linear polymer with a unimodal and narrow molar mass distribution (PDI = 1.08) by a progressive addition of catalysts.
The remarkable electronic properties of [60]fullerenes have attracted great attention from scientists with different backgrounds to develop a wide variety of chemically modified fullerene derivatives.1–5 The recent progress in the chemistry of fullerenes has allowed advanced functional materials that have extensive potential applications, such as semiconductivity, superconductivity, photovoltaic activity, magnetism, and bioactivity properties.6–9 Dendritic macromolecules,10–12 comprised of several dendritic wedges coupled to a multi-valency core, are charismatic molecular constructs for the development of nanotechnology because of their well-defined globular nanometric structure.13–15 It is noteworthy that the molecular composition, like functionalities in cores, branches, dendrons and periphery surface, may be tuned precisely by stepwise state-of-the-art chemistry. In particular, dendronized linear polymers, as analogues of dendrimers but with a long linear polymer chain used as the core,16–21 have gained increased importance in recent years because, when several dendrons with higher generations are attached to a linear polymer, they are capable of forcing the random-coiled polymer to afford rigid and rodlike nanocylinders. Recently, thanks to benefits from a combination of both dendritic frameworks and fullerenes, dendrimer and fullerene chemistry intersected to create a new interdisciplinary area in supramolecular chemistry and materials science.22–31 However, dendritic structures with fullerene units at their surface or with C60 spheres in the dendritic branches, namely fullerene-rich dendritic molecules,22,32 have rarely been considered. This is mainly due to the difficulties associated with the synthesis of fullerene-rich molecules such as the poor solubility of C60, the limitation on potential chemistries in the presence of reactive fullerene groups, and their chemical reactivity.30,33 Therefore, over the past years, such tedious synthetic methodologies have restricted the realization of fullerene-rich dendritic linear polymers. This prompted us to explore the synthesis of the defect-free fullerene-rich dendronized linear polymers by using a macromonomer approach that uses a pure dendrimer with a polymerizable end group to ensure complete dendritic coverage of the polymer backbone. We herein describe the preparation of a fullerene-rich dendron containing a norbornene unit as focal point for the polymerization and report on the construction of its linear polymer in a controlled fashion from sterically demanding monomer viaring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). The synthesis of the precursor dendritic alcohol containing the norbornene moiety at the focal point was achieved by repetitive esterification and deprotection procedures that utilized the anhydride of isopropylidene-2,2-bis(oxymethyl)-propionic acid (Scheme 1).34 Initially, the synthetic strategy envisaged for the preparation of fullerene-rich dendron was performed via a DMAP-catalyzed [4-(dimethylamino)-pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (DPTS)]35 esterification of dendritic alcohol with a 4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBA)3 possessing a carboxylic acid group. Unfortunately, the attempt to couple dendritic alcohol and PCBA was unsuccessful, presumably due to steric hindrance between the acid functionality on the bulky fullerene cage and the peripheral alcohol groups in the dendron. Therefore, we explored an alternative approach involving the esterification of dendritic alcohol with the key intermediate of the acyl chloride 1 obtained by the treatment of PCBA with oxalyl chloride for the preparation of the target molecule. Indeed, this approach led to the desirable fullerene-rich dendron (Scheme 1). Polymerization of the exonorbornene monomer (fullerene-rich dendron) was attempted with the fast initiating third generation Grubbs’ catalyst.36,37 Analysis of the reaction mixture by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) revealed that the polymerization produced a low molecular weight (Mn = 4.3 kDa) with a bimodal weight distribution (see SI) even under various conditions such as extended reaction times, different Grubbs' catalysts and different solvents. Despite the relatively higher activity of the exo isomer of the norbornene toward polymerization,34 the experimentally low molecular mass and the incomplete consumption of the macromonomeric dendron observed from the GPC trace are most likely related to the alkene being sterically shielded from the catalyst in the norbornenyl macromonomer due to the bulky size of the dendron based on C60.38,39
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to fullerene-rich dendron and its linear polymer. 
We assumed that increased reaction times would be necessary toward the polymerization of dendritic monomers containing the sterically demanding dendron, but decomposition of the catalyst can take place over an extended period of time, leading to low molecular weight of the resulting polymers. Therefore, we hypothesized that carrying out the reaction by adding additional catalysts in portions might be beneficial for the catalyst activity and afford a polymer with improved molecular weight and narrow PDI value. Indeed, when a key control experiment by means of gradually adding additional catalysts to the reaction solution was performed (see the experimental section for details), a fullerene-rich linear polymer that is easily distinguished from the fullerene-rich dendron by TLC was obtained (Scheme 1). As shown in Fig. 1, the GPC analysis of the linear polymer shows not only a unimodal and narrow molar mass distribution (Mn = 6.5 kDa, PDI = 1.08) but also reveals the absence of the residual dendron monomer (Mn = 1.8 kDa, PDI = 1.03). It is known in the literature that the measured values for the molecular weights underestimate the true molecular weights of comb polymers by up to a factor of ten.40 This is confirmed by the marked difference between calculated molecular mass (mass = 4507 Da) and experimental value determined by GPC (Mn = 1810 Da) of the dendron monomer, which is probably a result of the difference in hydrodynamic volumes of those dendrolized molecules based on fullerene compared to linear polystyrene standards. In addition, we cannot rule out that analytical GPC using the calibration curve of linear polystyrene as standard reveals lower than expected molecular weights for fullerene-containing polymers. This phenomenon has been ascribed to π–π interactions between the fullerene subunits and the phenyl moieties of the polystyrene stationary phase, leading to an increase of the elution volume with a corresponding decrease in the molecular weights.41,42 The resulting linear dendritic polymer is readily soluble in common organic solvents (chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene, etc).

Fig. 2 details the 1H NMR spectra for fullerene-rich dendron (left) and the final fullerene-rich linear polymer (right). Inspection of the 1H NMR for the fullerene-rich linear polymer clearly indicates that the dendron monomer olefin signal at δ 6.24 ppm is replaced by a new signal at 5.61 ppm corresponding to the cis/trans double bonds of the polymer backbone, confirming the successful polymerization. To demonstrate potential applications of these dendritic-type fullerenes in organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs), the active layers in bulk heterojunction OPVs were fabricated with regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The weight ratio of P3HT to fullerene-rich dendron was 1:1, whereas in the case of fullerene-rich linear polymer the ratio was slightly modified to 1:0.5. The preliminary photovoltaic performance based on fullerene-rich dendron shows a Jsc of 5.23 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.50 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.52, leading to a decent PCE of 1.36%. On the other hand, the device using fullerene-rich linear polymer as the n-type material delivers inferior performance with a Jsc of 3.61 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.44 V, a FF of 0.33, decreasing the PCE to 0.52%. The low power conversion efficiencies are entirely due to the decrease of the Jsc, which can be attributed to the unsuitable morphology in the bicontinuous interpenetrating networks of the BHJ composite. This is supported by the absence of clearly detectable crystalline features in the AFM (Fig. 3c). Moreover, in the case of fullerene-rich linear polymer, AFM imaging of the active layer film reveals the isolated phase segregation between two components, resulting in the unique spherical-like feature in the AFM that is generally seen in most hyper-branched polymers.43–47 The isolated spherical clusters show an average diameter of 230 nm and a height of less than 15 nm (Fig. 3d). The external quantum efficiencies, shown in the inset to Fig. 3b, exhibit only ∼35% for P3HT/fullerene-rich dendron and only ∼15% for P3HT/fullerene-rich linear polymer at a broad peak centered at 530 nm, which implies that charge separation, transportation, and collection of the device are inefficient and photons absorbed by the active layers are inefficiently converted into electricity.

In summary, we have successfully prepared a fullerene-rich dendron based on norbornene-type monomer at the focal point by the esterification of dendritic alcohol with an acyl chloride functionalized C60. Upon applying a combination of ROMP strategy and a controlled methodology of a progressive addition of catalyst, we have established a platform for the synthesis of a fullerene-rich linear polymer. Despite some remarkable recent achievements based on the dendritic frameworks, it is clear that the example discussed herein represents only the first steps towards the design of fullerene-rich linear polymer.
