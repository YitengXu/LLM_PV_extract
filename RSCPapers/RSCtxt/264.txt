    , Accepted 11th January 2020First published on 3rd February 2020AbstractIn order to investigate the effects of the substitution position on the photovoltaic performance of donor polymers, two benzothiophene ring substituted benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene (BDT)-based conjugated polymers (PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD) are designed and synthesized. The variation in the substitution position has small influences on the photophysical properties but has a great effect on the intramolecular π–π stack structure, charge transport and photovoltaic properties. PBDTBTs-BDD (with the 6-position of the benzothiophene substituent) exhibited a smaller π–π stacking distance of 3.67 Å compared to 4.11 Å seen for PBDTTBs-BDD (with the 2-position of the benzothiophene substituent). And the charge mobilities of PBDTBTs-BDD-based devices are higher and more balanced than those of PBDTTBs-BDD-based devices, which are highly beneficial for reducing recombination of free carriers and then lead to a higher short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of devices. With ITIC or Y6 as non-fullerene acceptors, PBDTBTs-BDD-based devices exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 7.76% and 12.07%, respectively, which are higher than those of PBDTTBs-BDD-based devices (5.04% and 5.81%). This work demonstrates that the photovoltaic properties of donor polymers can be highly tunable through slight modifications of their side chain structures.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much interest because of the advantages of being light-weight, having low cost and easy fabrication of flexible devices.1–5 Benefiting from the development of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs), power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 16% have been obtained in single-junction NF-PSCs.6–9 It is commonly known that the PCEs of NF-PSCs are determined by three parameters, which are short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF).10 Generally, polymer donors with the complementary adsorption spectrum of NF-SMAs are strongly needed in order to make the absorption of PSCs match better with the solar spectrum and achieve a large JSC for PSC devices.10–18 In addition, the matched energy levels between the polymer donors and NF-SMAs could ensure the high VOC and low energy losses (Eloss) of PSC devices.19–21 Therefore, rational design of polymer donors to match well with NF-SMAs plays a vital role in realizing high-performance PSCs.
Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), as a typical electron donor unit to construct polymer donors, has received considerable attention because of its large planar structure and excellent photovoltaic performance in PSCs.22–28 Its two dimensional (2D) side chains were regarded as a valuable strategy to tune the energy levels and absorption spectra of polymers. For example, in 2011, Huo et al. synthesized a thienyl-substituted BDT-based polymer PBDTTT-C-T. Compared with PBDTTT-C based on alkoxy-substituted BDT, PBDTTT-C-T exhibits red-shifted absorption spectra and lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels. And PBDTTT-C-T-based PSCs exhibit a PCE of 7.59%, which is 18% higher than that of PBDTTT-C-based PSCs.29 In 2014, Wang et al. designed and synthesized a benzothienyl-substituted BDT-based polymer PBDTBzT-DTffBT. Compared with the polymer (PBDTT-DTffBT) based on thienyl-substituted BDT, PBDTBzT-DTffBT exhibits red-shifted absorption spectra and stronger intermolecular interactions. And PBDTBzT-DTffBT-based PSCs exhibit a PCE of 7.30% with a VOC of 0.90 V. The PCE is 36% higher than that of PBDTT-DTffBT-based PSCs.30 In 2017, Lin et al. designed and synthesized a polymer (PMOT16) containing 4-methoxylthiophene substituted BDT. PMOT16 exhibits lower energy levels and enhanced interactions compared to PBDTT-6ttTPD based on thienyl-substituted BDT. PMOT16-based PSCs exhibit a PCE of 10.04% with a VOC of 0.93 V. The PCE is slightly higher than those of PBDTT-6ttTPD-based PSCs.31 In 2019, Li et al. designed a phenyl substituted BDT derivative containing both fluorine and sulfur atoms and synthesized a wide bandgap polymer PBTA-PSF based on the derivative. By introducing a fluorine atom on the benzene ring, PBTA-PSF shows a lower HOMO energy level and a complementary absorption spectrum with ITIC. As a result, a PCE of 13.91% is achieved with a VOC of 1.01 V, and a large JSC of 18.51 mA cm−2.32 These results reveal that the varieties of BDT side chains played an important role in tuning the material's energy level, absorption spectra and photovoltaic efficiencies. However, the main research now focuses on the different substituents on BDT, and the substitution position effect of side chains on the photovoltaic performance of polymer donors is seldom reported.
As we know, thiophene is a six-π-electron five-membered heteroaromatic compound while benzene is a six-π-electron six-membered aromatic compound. Benzo[b]thiophene consists of a thiophene ring flanked by a benzene ring ortho-fused across the 2,3-positions. Therefore, studies on the substitution position effect of benzo[b]thiophene units on the photovoltaic performance of BDT-based donor polymers will be interesting.
In this paper, we designed and synthesized two benzo[b]thiophene ring substituted BDT-based conjugated polymers PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD with 1,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]-dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) as acceptor units. It is found that the variation in the substitution position has small influences on the photophysical properties but has a great effect on the intramolecular π–π stack structure, charge transport and photovoltaic properties. PBDTBTs-BDD (with the 6-position of the benzothiophene substituent) exhibited a smaller π–π stacking distance of 3.67 Å compared to 4.11 Å seen for the PBDTTBs-BDD (with the 2-position of the benzothiophene substituent). And the charge mobilities of PBDTBTs-BDD-based devices are higher and more balanced than those of PBDTTBs-BDD-based devices, which are highly beneficial for reducing the recombination of free carriers and then lead to a higher JSC and FF of devices. With ITIC or Y6 as non-fullerene acceptors, PBDTBTs-BDD-based devices exhibit a PCE of 7.76% and 12.07%, respectively, which are higher than those of PBDTTBs-BDD-based devices (5.04% and 5.81%).
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic route to PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD is shown in Scheme 1 and the detailed synthesis could be found in the experimental section of the ESI.†PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD were prepared by the Stille coupling reaction with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst according to previous reports. PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD displayed good solubility in general solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was utilized to measure the molecular weight of PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD were 25.3 and 10.4, respectively, with corresponding polydispersity indices (PDI) of 2.98 and 3.65. The decomposition temperatures (Td, 5 wt% loss) of PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD were 320 °C and 374 °C, respectively, indicating their excellent thermal stability for photovoltaic applications (Fig. S1, ESI†).

2.2 Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD both in CF solutions and in neat films are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 1, and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. Because of the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between BDT and BDD units, PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD show broad absorption bands ranging from 400 to 700 nm in solution. The PBDTBTs-BDD film exhibited a maximum absorption at 580 nm with an aggregation shoulder of 617 nm, while the PBDTTBs-BDD film exhibited a maximum absorption at 583 nm with an aggregation peak at 625 nm. The intense shoulder peak in the long wavelength implied that there should be strong intra-/intermolecular aggregation.33–35 According to the empirical formula, the optical bandgap (Eoptg) values of PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD were respectively calculated to be 1.80 eV and 1.77 eV, respectively. Notably, PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD exhibit complementary absorption compared with low band gap NF-SMAs ITIC-Th and Y6 (Fig. 1), which is beneficial for light harvesting and achieving a high JSC.

Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of PBDTTBs-BDD and PBDTBTs-BDD, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1. Their energy-level diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. The HOMO energy levels of PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD were estimated to be −5.59 and −5.49 eV, respectively. And the LUMO energy levels of PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD were estimated to be −3.51 and −3.52 eV, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, the gap of the HOMO and LUMO levels (ΔHOMO and ΔLUMO) between the polymer donors and NF-SMAs are both larger than 0.2 eV, which is essential to yield a sufficient driving force for exciton separation in BHJ solar cells.36–38

2.3 Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the substitution position effect of benzothiophene units on the molecular conformations of these polymers. As shown in Fig. 3, the side chain dihedral angles are almost the same in PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD. However, the backbone dihedral angles in PBDTBTs-BDD are 14.36° and 10.00°, respectively. However the backbone dihedral angles in PBDTBTs-BDD are 19.00° and 11.04°, respectively. This means that PBDTBTs-BDD exhibited better backbone planarity than PBDTTBs-BDD, which is considered to be available for enhancing intermolecular interaction and improving the charge transfer ability.39–42

2.4 Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD, we fabricated PSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. Upon the optimization of film preparation (Fig. S4–S16, ESI†), the PBDTBTs-BDD:ITIC devices showed a PCE of 7.76% with a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 12.55 mA cm−2 and an FF of 63.28%, and PBDTTBs-BDD:ITIC devices showed a PCE of 5.04% with a VOC of 0.94 V, a JSC of 11.18 mA cm−2 and an FF of 48.13%. The higher FF of PBDTBTs-BDD-based devices is due to their better backbone planarity than PBDTTBs-BDD. Recently NF-SMAs Y6 has attracted great attention and a break-through in photovoltaic properties has been obtained. As we all know, Y6 shows a strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared region, which could contribute to the higher JSC of the devices. As expected, with Y6 as the acceptor, PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6 devices showed a PCE of 12.07% with a VOC of 0.79 V, a JSC of 23.00 mA cm−2 and an FF of 66.43%. The PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6 devices showed a PCE of 5.81% with a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 16.97 mA cm−2 and an FF of 45.19%. It is worth noting that PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6 devices show a low energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVOC) of 0.55 eV, which is lower than that of PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6 devices (0.58 eV).
Both PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD-based devices exhibited a broader photo-to-current response range of 300–1000 nm (Fig. 4b). However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PBDTBTs-BDD-based devices was higher than that of PBDTTBs-BDD-based devices, and the maximum EQE values of PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD based devices reached 77.24% and 59.00%, respectively. The photocurrent density (Jph) and the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) were tested for exploring the exciton dissociation efficiencies (Pdiss) via Jph/Jsat (Fig. 4c). Assuming that all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by electrodes, the Jsat is only limited by the total amount of absorbed incident photons, and thus the value of JSC/Jsat characterizes the charge extraction under short-circuit conditions. The Jsat was calculated to be 23.61 mA cm−2 and 19.96 mA cm−2 for PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6 and PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6-based devices, respectively. The Pdiss values were calculated to be 97.46% and 85.02%, respectively. The higher Pdiss value indicates that the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes are quite efficient in PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6-based devices. Dark current densities (J0) of 1.0 × 10−6 mA cm−2 and 1.0 × 10−5 mA cm−2 were obtained for PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6 and PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6-based devices at dark saturation (Fig. 4d). The better overall diode characteristics suggest that PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6-based devices have lower recombination of free carriers and better efficiency of carrier extraction than PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6-based devices.43–46

2.5 Charge mobility and film morphology
Hole-only and electron-only devices were investigated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method under the optimized conditions,47,48 and the related data are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 5, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6 blend films were 4.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6 blend films were 2.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Compared with PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6 blends films (μh/μe = 0.702), PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6 blend films showed more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 0.807). As is known to all, the higher and balanced charge mobilities could increase the charge carrier transportation and reduce the charge recombination of devices, thus contributing to a higher JSC and FF as well as the superior photovoltaic performance.49–51

The morphology of the blend films under the optimized conditions was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 6, the surface of the PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6 blend film was relatively smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.42 nm, whereas the PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6 blend film exhibited a slightly higher RMS roughness of 1.74 nm. As we all know, good surface morphology would lead to higher exciton dissociation efficiency and thus improve device performance. Moreover, the microstructures of blend films were further investigated using X-ray diffraction. PBDTBTs-BDD exhibited a smaller π–π stacking distance of 3.67 Å compared to 4.11 Å seen for PBDTTBs-BDD, which suggests stronger intermolecular interactions in the PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6 blend film and therefore an improved charge transport and a higher FF of PBDTBTs-BDD-based devices.52–56

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, in order to investigate the effects of the substitution position on the photovoltaic performance of donor polymers, two benzothiophene ring substituted BDT-based conjugated polymers PBDTBTs-BDD and PBDTTBs-BDD are designed and synthesized. PBDTBTs-BDD exhibited a smaller π–π stacking distance of 3.67 Å compared to 4.11 Å seen for PBDTTBs-BDD. The μh and μe of the PBDTBTs-BDD:Y6 blend films were 4.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh and μe of PBDTTBs-BDD:Y6 blend films were 2.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher and more balanced charge mobilities of PBDTBTs-BDD-based devices are beneficial for reducing the recombination of free carriers and then lead to a higher JSC and FF of devices. With ITIC or Y6 as NF-SMAs, PBDTBTs-BDD-based devices exhibit PCEs of 7.76% and 12.07%, respectively, which are higher than those of PBDTTBs-BDD-based devices (5.04% and 5.81%). This work demonstrates that the photovoltaic properties of donor polymers can be highly tunable through slight modifications of their side chain structures.
