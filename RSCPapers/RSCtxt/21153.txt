    , Accepted 22nd November 2019First published on 25th November 2019AbstractRechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for potentially low-cost and high-energy-density storage have been intensively researched to meet ever-growing demands. Achieving higher storages and understanding the transporting and storing diffusion process of Li ions are still great challenges. Herein, a porous crystalline polyoxometalate-based metal–organic framework (POM@MOF), H2[CuII4(Htrz)5(H2O)2][MoVI4CuII4O26]0.5·3H2O, with defect sites as a LIB electrode material is reported. The Li-ion diffusion process in the material was investigated using ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and off-line powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), indicating that O atoms of POM nano-clusters can be regarded as Li-ion acceptors (storage sites); meanwhile the defect sites (uncoordinated N atoms or –N–H groups) in the crystalline material also participate in the Li-ion storage. The reported porous crystalline POM@MOF material with defects delivers a remarkable Li-ion storage capacity of ca. 700 mA h g−1 in 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1.
Introduction
Open framework materials as lithium (Li)-ion battery (LIB) electrode materials have been proven to be effective in constructing kinetically favorable Li-ion channels,1–5 while the sluggish Li-ion transport caused by the severe volume expansion limits the rate performance and stability. This is also true for many typical anode materials, such as metallic oxides, sulfides, stannides, phosphides and silicides.6–10 Polyoxometalates (POMs), well-defined nano-size metal–oxygen clusters (ca. 1 nm) with abundant surface negative electrons and active oxygen atoms sites, can be considered to be very promising anode material candidates for LIBs.11–14 Compared with the accepting and donating of only single electrons of anode materials, the high capabilities of collecting/distributing electron transfer and reversible redox properties of POM nano-clusters in particular can allow quick multi-electron insertion and extraction at the anode,15,16 giving rise to increased storage capacity. But, due to the large free energy generated by their larger specific surface area, the aggregation of POM nano-clusters limits their commercial application. A judicious design is to graft POM nano-clusters into homogeneous nanoporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),17–20 and the resulting porous nano-array frameworks can exhibit a high-dimensional Li-ion/electron transfer channel, which may effectively prevent the aggregation of POM nano-clusters and volume expansion of electrode materials during Li-ion and electron diffusion21–25 (Table S1, ESI†).
Although the Li diffusion process (insertion, conversion and alloying) has been roughly investigated in conventional Li-ion storage battery materials,26–28 structural uncertainty of those materials caused by defects, dopants, dislocations and disorders is likely to distort the results. In contrast, crystalline POM@MOF materials with a defined structure29–32 have the inherent advantage of allowing the exploration of “structure–activity” relationships to understand the Li-ion diffusion process and further design battery materials with high storage capacity. However, the correlative work has not been implemented for POM nano-cluster-based crystalline materials, to the best of our knowledge. Herein, a new porous crystalline POM@MOF as a LIB anode material, H2[CuII4(Trz)5(H2O)2][MoVI4CuII4O26]0.5·3H2O, is designed and fabricated using a POM nano-cluster precursor with (CH3COOH)2Cu and 1,2,3-triazole via a one-pot hydrothermal reaction (Scheme 1). In particular, the crystalline POM@MOF material produced by grafting POM nano-clusters into porous MOFs is beneficial for improving Li-ion storage capacity (the Li-ion storage is ca. 700 mA h g−1 in 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1). Meanwhile, the migration process and position of the Li ions were demonstrated in ex situ XPS spectra and off-line PXRD patterns. Namely, O atoms of POM nano-clusters were found to be the Li-ion acceptors in the diffusion process through analysing the XPS spectra of the Li and O atoms and the formation of a new component (Li2MoO4). Moreover, the inherent defect sites (–N–H groups or uncoordinated N atoms) of the crystalline POM@MOF material also contribute to the Li-ion storage capacity, as determined from the XPS spectra of the Li and N atoms.

Experimental
Materials and characterization
All chemical reagents were obtained commercially and used without further purification. Elemental analyses of C, H and N were measured with a PerkinElmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured using an Alpha Centauri FT/IR spectrometer (KBr pellets). XRD patterns were scanned using a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V XRD diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were recorded using a PerkinElmer TGA7 instrument under a N2 flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles were carried out using a LAND 2001A battery tester between 0.01 and 3.00 V at various current densities. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI750D) in the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li+/Li at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. XPS (VG ESCALAB MK II, UK) was performed using a system with a monochromatized Mg-Kα line source (1253.6 eV). All binding energies were calibrated by referencing to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a Phenom Prox microscope at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.
Synthesis of porous crystalline H2[CuII4(Trz)5(H2O)2][MoVI4CuII4O26]0.5·3H2O
A mixture of (NH4)6Mo7O24 (230 mg, 0.18 mmol), (CH3COOH)2Cu (150 mg, 0.75 mmol), 1,2,3-triazole (Trz, 3 drops, 1.16 mmol) and NH4VO3 (37 mg, 0.31 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water and stirred for ca. 30 min at room temperature, and 1 M HCl was used to adjust the pH value of the mixed solution (ca. 3.3). The resulting solution was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor and heated at 180 °C for 5 days. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature at 10 °C h−1, a sky-blue block crystalline material was obtained, which was then washed with distilled water and air-dried (yield: 48% based on Cu). Elemental analysis: calcd for C10H27Cu6Mo2N15O18 (1218.5): C 9.84, H 2.10 and N 17.23%; found: C 9.77, H 2.12 and N 17.18%.
X-ray crystallographic study
Crystallographic data of the crystalline POM@MOF material were collected using a Bruker SMART-CCD diffractometer with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature. The structure of the material was resolved and refined through direct methods and refined full-matrix least squares on F2 using the SHELXTL and WINGX software packages.33 The commands “ISOR”, “DELU” and “SIMU” were used to refine some ADP and NDP error atoms in the crystalline material and all non-hydrogen atoms were also anisotropically refined. The crystal data and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Tables 1 and S2 (ESI†). The CCDC reference number of the crystalline material is 1545838.†

Electrochemical measurements
Sample pre-treatment: the sample was first heated to 180 °C under vacuum to completely remove the water molecules (including the free and lattice water) of the porous crystalline POM@MOF material, and was then cooled to room temperature in a vacuum oven. The mixture of the post-treatment material, Super-P carbon and polyvinylidene fluoride at a weight ratio 7:2:1 was put on pure Cu foil, and dried in a vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h. The loading mass of electro-active materials in each Cu foil was ca. 2 mg. The testing coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with the as fabricated working electrode, metallic lithium foil as a counter electrode, and 1.0 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (1:1 v/v) as the electrolyte.
Results and discussion
Structural description of the porous crystalline POM@MOF material
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction with the aid of coordination models analysis shows that all of the Mo and Cu atoms have full oxidation states in the crystalline POM@MOF material. A proton was also added to balance the charge, and the molecular formula was found to be H2[CuII4(Trz)5(H2O)2][MoVI4CuII4O26]0.5·3H2O. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the crystalline POM@MOF material crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/m, consisting of half a [MoVI4CuII4O26]20− cluster (abbr. Mo8), six Cu2+, five Trz molecules, two coordinated water molecules and three water molecules of crystallization (Fig. S1a†). And, there are four crystallographically independent Cu2+ ions in the fragment composed of Cu atoms and Trz organic molecules, the coordination information of which is shown in Fig. S1b.† All the bond lengths around the Cu ions are of normal distances, and the bond lengths of Cu–O and Cu–N are in the range of 1.520–2.300 Å and 1.947–2.367 Å.
In the crystalline material, five Trz molecules coordinating with three Cu (Cu2, Cu3 and Cu4) construct one “saddle-like” trinuclear [Cu3(Trz)5]+ unit (named subunit A) (Fig. 1a). Then adjacent subunits A are serially assembled together via the sharing of Cu1 to generate a one-dimensional (1D) organic–inorganic hybrid chain (–A–A–A–A–) (Fig. 1b). Meanwhile, Mo8 clusters are also connected together to form a 1D purely inorganic chain (–Mo8–Cu3–Mo8–Cu3–) via the sharing of two Cu3 of subunit A (Fig. 1c). The 1D Mo8-Cu3 chain was further extended into a 2D purely inorganic sheet via a –Cu4–O9W– fragment (Fig. 1d and S2†). Finally, the 2D pure inorganic sheet was pillared by 1D hybrid chains via a copper–oxygen interaction resulting in the formation of the 3D POM-based hybrid framework (Fig. 2 and S3a†). Interestingly, there is an opening cavity with dimensions of 4.28 × 9.56 Å2, as calculated by PLATON (ca. 19% of the unit volume) along the crystallographic b-axis (Fig. S3b†). To clearly understand the complicated 3D structure, the topology was also analyzed. If the Mo8 cluster and subunit A are considered as six- and five-connected nodes, respectively, and Trz molecule, copper–nitrogen interactions and copper–oxygen interactions are used as connectors, the 3D opening hybrid framework can be described as a {5, 6}-connected net with {4·6.6·4}2{4·8.6·6.8} topology (Fig. S3c†).

PXRD, SEM, FT-IR and BET characterization
The PXRD pattern of the resulting crystalline POM@MOF material is shown in Fig. 3a. A comparison of the PXRD pattern of the obtained material and the simulated pattern indicates the purity of the crystalline POM@MOF material. The microscopic morphology of the crystalline material was also characterized via SEM, showing the crystal material has comparatively uniform size (ca. 0.1 mm) and absolutely smooth surfaces (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 3c) was also recorded to provide complementary information. The characteristic peaks at ca. 973, 927, 862 and 720 cm−1 are attributed to ν(Mo–O) of POM nano-clusters,34 and the peaks in the range of ca. 1580–1100 cm−1 and ca. 3100 cm−1 show the presence of triazole. It is worth noting that the strong stretching vibration peaks at ca. 3400 and 1600 cm−1 should be attributed to the –N–H group of 1,2,3-triazole, indicating the presence of uncoordinated N-atom sites in the triazole molecule, which can be expected to be potential migration sites for Li ions. The porous texture of the crystalline POM@MOF material was also characterized by recording N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K (Fig. 3d), which reveal a tiny pore volume (ca. 0.5 nm) and the existence of micro-pores, as indicated by the pore size distributions.

Li-ion storage performance
Detailed electrochemical testing was conducted to investigate the Li-ion storage performance of a half-cell coin battery based on the porous crystalline POM@MOF material as an anode electrode and Li foil as a counter electrode. Fig. 4a shows the typical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the range of 0.01 to 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). A well-defined and irreversible reduction peak (ca. 0.7 V) could be observed for the first cycle, which then disappears, associated with the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) film.35,36 And, the enhanced current density in subsequent CV curves indicates that the electrode material is being activated and can be expected to improve the battery capacity. Combining with previously reported work and subsequent experimental results,8,37 the electrochemical reaction in the crystalline POM@MOF electrode during the Li-ion transport process can be expressed according to eqn (1):  [Mo8O26]x + n Li+ + n e− ↔ (Mo8O26)Lix−m + m L2MoO4(1)

(d) Nyquist plot and fitting plot after the first discharge–charge process and the simulated equivalent circuit of the electrode/electrolyte interface. 
Just as shown from the enhanced peak current in the CV curves, the capacity enhancement can be confirmed from the discharge/charge curves in Fig. 4b. In a voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li/Li+, the porous crystalline POM@MOF material delivers ca. 1893 and 1005 mA h g−1 capacity at a current density of 100 mA g−1 in the first discharge and charge process, respectively. The irreversible capacity loss can be mainly ascribed to the formation of the SEI film and the decomposition of the electrolyte.38–43 Note that the capacity is higher than the value of that of commercial graphite (Fig. S4a, ESI†) and most of the crystalline POM nano-cluster materials reported so far (Table S1, ESI†). The good capacity can be attributed to the porous frameworks and uncoordinated –N–H functional group in the triazole molecule of the POM@MOF material contributing to the storage capacity, where the channel plays the role of transporting and storing Li ions and electrons, and the –N–H functional group provides additional anchoring sites for Li ions.
The rate capability is a crucial indicator for the large-scale application of batteries as fast recharging electronic devices. The drawback of low power becomes particularly evident in a high-capacity material.44 As shown in Fig. 4c, on increasing the current density by 10-fold from 100 to 1000 mA g−1, the storage capacity of the crystalline material can be maintained at ca. 300 mA h g−1, indicating that the porous crystalline POM@MOF material has a better rate capability. When the current density is re-set back to the initial rate of 100 mA g−1, the charge capacity is switched instantaneously to ca. 400 mA h g−1 as well as a high efficiency of 100% over 100 cycles. In contrast, a commercial graphite anode failed after 100 cycles (ca. 330 mA h g−1, Fig. S4b, ESI†). Actually, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results also reveal improved charge transfer kinetics in the porous crystalline POM@MOF material electrode system (Fig. 4d). The battery material shows a semicircle in the high to middle frequency regions and a steep straight line in the low frequency region, corresponding to electrochemical reaction impedance (charge transfer) and ion diffusion impedance, respectively. Moreover, the charge transfer resistance of the porous crystalline POM@MOF material electrode is ca. 68 Ω, much lower than that of a commercial graphite electrode of 73 Ω (Fig. S5, ESI†). In the low frequency region, the straight line part of the plot for the crystalline electrode also indirectly reflects the faster Li-ion diffusion process in the interior of the porous crystalline material.
In order to thoroughly evaluate whether the porous crystalline POM@MOF material really has commercial application potential in practical LIB storage, the discharge/charge stabilities of the material electrode were also measured under a current density of 100 mA g−1 up to 200 cycles. As shown in Fig. 5, the porous crystalline POM@MOF material exhibits extremely high cycling stability. Moreover, the capacity of the crystalline material increases with increasing number of cycles. A capacity of ca. 700 mA h g−1 is still retained after 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1, and this is obviously higher than the theoretical value of 354 mA h g−1 for the porous crystalline POM@MOF material (Fig. S6, ESI†). The increasing capacity can be reasonably explained as follows. The abundant defect sites (uncoordinated N atoms) were exposed owing to the pulverization of the electrode material caused by repeated Li-ion insertion/extraction processes,45,46 where these N atoms can be used as Li-ion acceptors to increase capacity. The weakened and broadened XRD peaks of the post-discharge material confirm the smaller crystalline size of the electrode material (namely, pulverization) and the changed content of the Li–N group proves that the uncoordinated N atoms can combine with Li ions in the Li-ion migration and diffusion processes, as shown in Fig. 7d and 8a. Otherwise, the inner lower-oxidation-state Mo atoms of the POM nano-clusters were also further oxidized to improve the performance in the process, as for other anode materials.47,48

Structural stability of the crystalline POM@MOF
Reasonable evaluation of a good Li-ion storage material is that the material requires remarkable storage performance as well as robust structural integrity in the process of Li-ion transport and storage. As shown in Fig. 6a, the original morphology of the porous crystalline POM@MOF material is not obviously changed after immersing in solvents dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), and electrolyte after 12 h at room temperature. Besides this, the –N–H functional group on the surface of the crystalline material is also completely preserved and not etched by these chemical solvents, as shown in Fig. 6b, and the results indicate that the –N–H group of the triazole molecule does not adsorb to the surface of the crystalline material, but is induced by the material defects themselves in the material edge (namely, these defects are caused by some N atoms uncoordinated with Cu). In addition, the corresponding PXRD patterns were also used to confirm the robust resistance to organic solutions of the porous crystalline POM@MOF material (Fig. 6c). The TGA shows a main weight loss from 260 to 300 °C corresponding to the pyrolysis of organic components in the crystalline POM@MOF material (Fig. S7, ESI†), except for earlier water molecule loss under inert atmosphere of N2, indicating the good thermal stability of the crystalline POM@MOF material.
Discussion of Li-ion diffusion in crystalline POM@MOF
To analyze the Li-ion transport and storage process, the surface atoms of the porous crystalline POM@MOF battery material were characterized in detail by ex situ XPS of the fresh and discharged/charged materials. The XPS spectra of selected atoms (Mo, Cu and N) in the fresh crystalline POM@MOF material are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The XPS spectrum of Mo exhibits two peaks at ca. 235.3 and 232.3 eV attributed to Mo6+3d3/2 and Mo6+3d5/2 in POM nano-clusters.49 Moreover, two main peaks of Cu2+ atom can also be identified at ca. 955.2 and 935.3 eV,50 in addition to the weak peaks (ca. 954.5 and 932.2 eV) of Cu+,51 indicating that a tiny amount of surface Cu is converted from high to low oxidation state, which may be caused by the inner electron migration in the material. In addition, the XPS spectrum of the surface N atom was also thoroughly examined to analyze the surrounding chemical information. This spectrum can easily be de-convoluted into three main N types of pyrrolic-N (triazole molecule, ca. 400.2 eV),52 Cu–N (coordinated N, ca. 397.3 eV),53 and N–H group (uncoordinated N or defect sites, ca. 398.2 eV).54 It is worth mentioning that there are quite a lot of N–H groups for the total N content on the surface of the crystalline material, namely abundant defect sites in the fresh material, which is consistent with the FT-IR spectroscopy results. And, these uncoordinated N atoms can be carriers of candidate Li ions to assist in the improvement of the Li-ion storage, giving remarkable battery performance.
The surface chemistry of the porous crystalline POM@MOF material was also investigated after discharge and charge (at 1st discharge, 1st charge and 2nd discharge). Nearly all of the Mo atoms of POM nano-clusters are reduced from high to low oxidation state (Mo6+ → Mo4+) after undergoing the first discharge, but the Mo atoms of POM nano-clusters are again oxidized and reduced to Mo6+ and Mo4+, respectively, at the subsequent Li-ion transfer as shown in Fig. 7a. A confirmed fact is that the migration of Li ions between anode and cathode is accompanied by the transformation oxidation of the electrode, which can be perceived through analysing the change of binding energy. Also, an analogous phenomenon also happens on the surface Cu atoms in the crystalline POM@MOF. Fig. 7b shows that only half of Cu2+ (ca. 935.1 eV) are converted to Cu+ (ca. 932.6 eV) after initial discharge. But some of the Cu is still not involved in the Li-ion diffusion after the battery voltage is charged to ca. 3.0 V. Different chemical environment of Cu atoms (Cu–N (triazole) and Cu–O (POM)) leads to the oxidation discrepancy. Namely, those Cu atoms bound to O atoms of POM nano-clusters are more susceptible to the effect of electrons than Cu atoms bound to N atoms of the triazole molecules; that is to say, Cu–O (POM) possesses higher activity than Cu–N in Li-ion diffusion.
The N species in the XPS spectrum were also characterized to obtain more chemical information of defect sites (–N–H group, uncoordinated N atom). Fig. 7c reveals the presence of three types of N species, namely pyrrolic-N (triazole molecule), Cu–N (coordinated N) and Li–N (defect sites), in the discharged and charged POM@MOF material. The relative N content of Li–N (defect sites, ca. 398.4 eV) increases gradually with the Li-ion diffusion time.55 Conversely, when the crystalline POM@MOF electrode material is charging, the Li ions anchored on uncoordinated N atoms at the initial discharge are still not dissociated from the defect sites, indicating that a robust interaction force is formed between Li ion and uncoordinated N atom. As a result, the discrepancy in the storage capacities between discharge and charge may be caused by the incomplete diffusion of Li ions at the battery charge process can be reasonably guessed. On the other hand, the increasing Li–N content also shows abundant potential defect sites (–N–H group) are being activated, which provides energy accumulation for subsequent capacity improvements after ca. 40 Li-ion diffusion cycles. Additionally, the XPS spectrum of the Li ions diffused into the crystalline POM@MOF material was also analyzed to accurately confirm the N content attributed to the Li–N groups rather than N–H groups at discharge/charge. As shown in Fig. 7d, the Li XPS spectrum presents three important forms of Li–O (ca. 55.6 eV), Li–N (ca. 55.2 eV) and Li–Li (ca. 54.6 eV),55 respectively. Herein, the Li–O species shows the Li ions are migrated to the surface O atoms of POM nano-clusters, and Li–Li species indicates the formation of lithium dendrite in the Li-ion diffusion process. Moreover, the increasing or decreasing contents of Li–O and Li–Li are consistent with the migration direction of Li ions during discharge and charge reactions, which indicates that the POM nano-clusters contribute to the Li-ion storage capacities. On the contrary, the content of Li–N species does not decrease during the process, showing the crystalline POM@MOF electrode material cannot be truly charged fully and further causing the decreasing storage performance, as well demonstrating the true Li–N spectrum in the N XPS measurements.
Finally, the off-line PXRD patterns were also measured after undergoing the initial three migrations of Li ions in the porous crystalline POM@MOF battery material. As shown in Fig. 8a, the discharged and charged PXRD patterns coincide with the original and simulated PXRD patterns, except for slightly different diffraction intensity. The weakened and broadened XRD peaks after discharge show the pulverization of the electrode material during the migration and diffusion of Li ions. Moreover, the different shifts of some diffraction peaks indicate the slight change of crystal lattice of the crystalline material caused by the Li-ion intercalation during the discharging process. When the Li ions migrate out of the crystalline POM@MOF material (during the charging process), these shifting diffraction peaks are returned to their original positions, showing a self-healing ability. And the SEM micro-morphology of the crystalline POM@MOF material after Li-ion diffusion was also characterized as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The inherent morphology of the porous crystalline POM@MOF material can be still maintained, except for the decreasing size caused by grinding and the slightly rough surface resulting from the etching of Li ions. Also, a new component (Li2MoO4, PDF#53-0670), found from the discharged and charged PXRD patterns, shows the diffused Li ions are anchored on the POM nano-clusters. That is to say, the O atoms of POM nano-clusters are the acceptors of Li ions combining with the result of the O XPS spectrum.
Based on the above discussion, the Li-ion transporting and storing behavior in the porous crystalline POM@MOF material as LIB electrode can be reasonably speculated as shown in Fig. 8b. (1) Li ion leaving the metal Li sheet diffuses to the surface of the porous crystalline material under the driving force of the potential during the discharge process, and then is trapped by the O atoms of POM nano-clusters leading to the formation of new component (Li2MoO4). Meanwhile, POM nano-clusters with Li ions give rise to the oxidation state change of Mo atoms (Mo6+ → Mo4+) due to the internal electron transfer. Moreover, some Li ions are also captured by the surface N atom (–N–H group, uncoordinated N atom) in this process owing to the inherent surface defects of the material. Both of them together give rise to the excellent Li-ion storage performance of the porous crystalline POM@MOF battery material. (2) The Li ions are released from the POM nano-clusters and/or Li2MoO4, and the oxidation state of Mo atoms is also recovered to the original state (Mo4+ → Mo6+) during the charge process. But these Li ions with surface N atoms are not completely delivered from the defect sites referring to the Li–N relative content of Li and N XPS spectrum, which might be a pivotal factor causing Li-ion storage capacity loss.
Conclusions
In short, a porous crystalline POM@MOF material by grafting POM nano-clusters into MOFs was successfully designed and fabricated, and then explored as LIB anode material. The synthetic electrode material shows a remarkable reversible capacity of ca. 700 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Moreover, the ex situ XPS spectra and off-line PXRD patterns also demonstrate that the Li-ion acceptors are the O atoms of nano-clusters during the Li-diffusion reaction, and the defect sites (–N–H groups, or uncoordinated N atoms) also provide additional storage sites for Li ions, contributing to extra storage capacity. We believe that this work will lead to a better and deeper understanding of the POM nano-cluster effect with Li ions and even shed light on novel designs for greater capacity LIB storage materials based on the discovered interactions (or new component, Li2MoO4) between the Li ions and O atoms of nano-clusters.
