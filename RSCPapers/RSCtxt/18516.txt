    , Accepted 7th April 2021First published on 8th April 2021AbstractIn order to modulate the optoelectronic properties of dithiarubicene (DTR) by end-functionalization and reveal the structure–property relationship in detail, we have carried out a set of metal-catalyzed coupling reactions. Electron-withdrawing cyano (CN-DTR) and pyridyl (Py-DTR) groups, electron-donating methoxy (MeO-DTR) and thienyl (Th-DTR) groups, and relatively electron-neutral trimethylsilylethynyl (Ethynyl-DTR) group were introduced on the DTR core by using halogenated DTR derivatives as precursors. Particularly, we could successfully introduce the methoxy group by CuO-catalyzed reactions in high yield. As a result of the combination of the electron-accepting DTR core and the electron-donating methoxy group, the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum of MeO-DTR showed a large red-shift of the peak maximum by approximately 90 nm. In addition, the introduction of substituents made it possible to finely tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DTR thereby enabling its application in OFET devices. Thanks to the elevated HOMO energy level, the OFET device based on MeO-DTR exhibited a hole mobility (μh) of up to 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. On the other hand, the device based on CN-DTR had an ambipolar characteristic, which exhibited a moderate electron mobility (μe = 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to its low-lying LUMO energy level. From the XRD measurements, MeO-DTR and CN-DTR were found to adopt an edge-on molecular orientation on the HMDS-treated SiO2 substrate.
Introduction
The development of organic semiconducting materials can lead to the production of large-area and flexible optoelectronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and so on through the cost-effective and scalable fabrication process of thin films. π-Conjugated polymers have potential issues regarding the polydispersity and terminal group inhomogeneity, which often have significant negative effects on the device performance. Because structural defects in the polymer backbone are difficult to be detected and removed, π-conjugated polymers suffer from the batch-to-batch variation that decreases the device reliability. Accordingly, π-conjugated small molecules and oligomers with a uniform molecular structure have been recently attracting more attention than ever.1,2 Diverse synthetic chemistries for designing organic molecules enable the systematic tuning of frontier molecular orbital energies and the fine control of band-gap energies as well as the adjustment of intermolecular packing structures in the solid state. These important factors affecting the device performance definitely originate not only from the chemical structure of the π-conjugated core but also from the stereoelectronic character of flanking groups. Dinaphtho[2,3-b:2',3'-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DNTT) is one of the most attractive hole-transporting OFET materials, and the effect of molecular modification of DNTT has been intensively studied by Takimiya and co-workers. The introduction of methyl groups3 and linear4 branched5 alkyl groups helps in maintaining the electronic structure of DNTT in solutions, while the crystal packing in the thin-film state is markedly different to have a direct effect on the semiconducting properties. They have recently reported the one-step functionalization of DNTT by using 2-brominated DNTT as a common precursor.6 As their molecular design mainly utilizes the attachment of simple aliphatic chains and the high hole mobility in OFET devices are gratifyingly demonstrated, the functionalization of an aromatic core with π-conjugated systems is expected to modulate the optoelectronic properties remarkably. With the electron-deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) core in hand, Chen and Fréchet et al. have introduced an electron-rich pyrene end group to manifest that OPV devices comprising blend films with phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) record high fill factors as a result of the self-assembling π–π stacking between molecules.7 Wang and co-workers have revealed that the rhodanine substituent provides a DPP oligomer with appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels to achieve the ambipolar OFET characteristics.8 Ajayaghosh and co-workers succeeded in altering the charge carrier polarity, from a hole-transporting p-type molecule to an electron-transporting n-type one, in DPP-based low band gap semiconductors by choosing different terminal groups.9 Similar electronic-tuning strategies by end-functionalization for rylenediimide derivatives have been also investigated. Würthner and co-workers carried out nucleophilic substitution of alkyl- and arylamino groups on the naphthalene diimide (NDI) core to decrease the band gap energy,10 while Mukhopadyay and co-workers incorporated diphenylamine and its higher dendritic units to observe the pronounced red-shift of absorption spectra resulting in panchromatic near-infrared absorbing NDI dyes.11 In addition to the well-known cyano group with electron-withdrawing properties,12 the same research group has integrated triarylphosphonium13 and polypyridinium14 substituents with the NDI core giving rise to highly electron-deficient and stable ion pair compounds. Tetrathiafulvalene- and dithiafulvalene-fused π-extended acceptors were also synthesized to study their interesting multi-state redox properties.15,16
We have previously reported the synthesis of π-extended dithiarubicene (DTR) derivatives17 with multiple cyano-substituted ethenyl groups at the molecular termini for their application in n-type OFET devices (Fig. 1a).18 LUMO energy levels were nicely lowered to exhibit an electron mobility of up to 5.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the device could be operated under ambient conditions without a detrimental drop of performance. This is the first instance to demonstrate that end-functionalized DTR derivatives are beneficial to n-type OFET devices,19 although a donor–acceptor copolymer bearing the DPP segment as a coupling partner exhibits ambipolar characteristics20 and an alkyl/alkanoyl doubly substituted DTR shows relatively low hole-transporting properties.21 We have also indicated that anti-aromaticity is one possible factor that lowers the LUMO energy level of DTR as confirmed by the nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Although relatively high electron mobilities were achieved in our previous report, only unipolar n-type charge transfer characteristics were observed. We have much room for investigating the structure–property relationship and developing ambipolar OFET devices. In this paper, we describe the (1) palladium and copper-catalyzed coupling reactions by using brominated or iodinated DTR as a precursor (Fig. 1b), (2) optical and electrochemical characterization of compounds, and (3) application in OFET devices in order to expand the potential utility of DTR. In addition, we have also fabricated OPV devices using OD-CN-DTR to evaluate the primary performance.

Results and discussion
Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were initially implemented using the Gaussian 09 suite of program22 to obtain insight into the electronic structure of target compounds. For saving the computational cost, long and branched alkyl chains were replaced by a methyl group. The ground state structures were optimized using the B3LYP density functional and a 6-31G(d,p) basis set to obtain a stable minimum with no imaginary frequency part. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the HOMO surfaces of selected dithiarubicene derivatives having a fused five-membered ring along with virtual reference compounds having a six-membered ring. A completely planar skeleton was elucidated for CN-DTR and MeO-DTR, while reference compounds had a bent structure owing to the presence of inserted methylene units at the β-position of thiophene. As for the two DTR derivatives, the bonding orbital interactions between thiophene and anthracene were observed at the β-position of thiophene, and the substantial stabilization of HOMO energy levels was confirmed. The LUMO energy levels were lowered as well. Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of five DTR derivatives, which indicates that the frontier molecular orbital energies can be controlled by choosing the flanking group with desired characteristics. Namely, the introduction of the electron-withdrawing cyano group (CN-DTR) and the electron-donating methoxy group (MeO-DTR) resulted in the lowest and highest energy levels among the five compounds, respectively. On the other hand, Mutara's research group has synthesized the dithieno-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a pyracylene moiety and revealed that the introduction of the thiophene ring enhances the anti-aromatic contribution as compared to the dibenzo-fused analogue.23 In addition to the NICS calculations previously investigated, we have also calculated the anisotropy of the current-induced density (ACID),24,25 which shows a weak anti-aromatic contribution of DTR as evidenced by the modest counterclockwise current density (Fig. 2) and is coincident with a relatively small NICS(0) value.18 Although DTR has two pentagonal rings, they do not form a pyracylene structure in contrast to the dithieno-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon reported by Murata and co-workers resulting in the less noticeable anti-aromatic characteristic.

Synthesis
Although oxidative cyclization is a potential method to construct thiophene-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the introduction of an alkyl group at the α-position is required to suppress the undesired polymerization.25 Because the β-position of thiophene has a solubilizing alkyl chain and functional groups will be introduced at the α-position of thiophene in the DTR core, we have selected palladium-catalyzed intramolecular direct arylation for synthesizing parent DTR and the reaction conditions (ligand, additive, and solvent) were optimized by reference to the protocol of Wudl and co-workers (see ref. 16 for details). Herein, 2-ethylhexyl and 2-octyldodecyl chains were attached to impart enough solubility for compound characterization and device fabrication. Subsequent bromination and iodination of DTR using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and N-iodosuccinimide (NIS), respectively, resulted in the successful introduction of halogen substituents at the α-position of thiophene in high yields. With these halogenated precursors (Br-DTR and I-DTR) in our hand, the Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction using trimethylsilylacetylene for obtaining Ethynyl-DTR was carried out under conventional palladium-catalyzed reaction conditions. While the application of I-DTR having a 2-ethylhexyl chain resulted in the dehalogenation side reaction, the reaction using Br-DTR cleanly proceeded to afford Ethynyl-DTR in 96% yield after purification by SiO2 column chromatography. Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions for synthesizing Th-DTR and Py-DTR were then carried out using Br-DTR and the corresponding boronic acid derivatives, and the target compounds were obtained in high yields (>90%). The introduction of a 2-ethylhexyl chain was enough for ensuring the solubility in organic solvents. For the substitution of the cyano group, we initially carried out the reaction using the palladium-catalyzed reaction system26,27 with Pd(dba)2 as a palladium source, 1,1′-bis-(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) as a ligand, and CuCN as a cyanation reagent. However, the starting material substantially remained after 42 h and a low NMR yield (29%) of the target compound was observed. Therefore, we employed the copper-catalyzed reaction system. It has been reported that the CuI-catalyzed cyanation of aryl bromide and iodide combined with N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine (DMEDA) as a ligand proceeds efficiently.28 We have checked these conditions and conducted the reaction for I-DTR using a similar catalytic system with KCN as a cyanation reagent. Unfortunately, a low conversion (<35%) was confirmed after 42 h and undesired dehalogenation occurred. On the other hand, the application of CuCN29 as the catalyst and cyanation reagent (Rosenmund–von Braun reaction30–32) for Br-DTR demonstrated an extremely high NMR yield (>95%) after 24 h. Because the obtained product having a 2-ethylhexyl chain had a low solubility, a 2-octhyldodecyl chain (OD-CN-DTR) was introduced for the subsequent spectroscopic characterization and device fabrication. Lastly, we have introduced the methoxy group to the DTR core. Although there have been a few papers describing the functionalization of the DTR core,18,21 the introduction of an electron-donating group has been unprecedented until now. The C–O coupling reactions with sodium methoxide was carried out using Br-DTR under copper-catalyzed reaction conditions (Scheme 1 and Table 1). While palladium-catalyzed reactions using aryl halides and sodium alkoxides involve dehalogenation through β-hydride abstraction rather than reductive elimination,33 copper-catalyzed Ullmann-type C–O coupling reactions would be expected to suppress the dehalogenation.34,35 Amide solvents, such as N-methylpyrroridone (NMP), which are often used for the methoxylation of the β-position of thiophene, are unsuitable for the methoxylation at the α-position of thiophene because of the competitive dehalogenation.36 Thus, we have used 1,4-dioxane as the reaction solvent, which can dissolve Br-DTR in an acceptable concentration. Our first trial using the CuI catalyst and N,N-diphenethyloxalamide (DPEO) ligand37 did not meet with success and the NMR yield of the target compound was very low (entry 1). The application of microwave heating at an increased temperature somewhat improved the reaction efficiency (entry 2). Two equivalents of CuBr increased the conversion of the starting material (entry 3) and the addition of methyl formate and lithium chloride coupled with a catalytic amount of CuBr37 further promoted the reaction but the dehalogenation could not be completely suppressed (entry 4). The increase of methanol concentration decreased the NMR yield, however, the dehalogenation could be almost suppressed (entry 5). The prolonged reaction time gave comparable results (entry 6), during which the deactivation of the CuBr catalyst33 might occur within 1.5 h. When CuO and NaI were used as a catalyst and an additive, respectively,38,39 catalyst decomposition was not observed and the extension of the reaction time finally resulted in a high NMR yield (entry 7). Furthermore, this catalyst system demonstrated a good NMR yield with conventional oil bath heating (entry 8).

Optoelectronic properties
The absorption spectra of five compounds along with unsubstituted DTR were collected in chloroform solution and the data are summarized in Table 2. While the spectrum of CN-DTR showed a blue-shift compared to that of DTR, the other spectra showed red-shifts; especially the absorption peak maximum of MeO-DTR exhibited a large bathochromic shift by approximately 90 nm (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2, ESI†) and the cut-off wavelength was observed in the NIR region. This remarkable red-shift by introducing the methoxy group is comparable to or surpasses the red-shift in the 1,7-dialkoxylation of perylene diimide (57 nm)40 and 2,6-dialkoxlation of naphthalene diimide (90 nm).41

(B) Cyclic voltammograms of 3 mM CH2Cl2 solutions of DTR (green line), CN-DTR (blue line), Py-DTR (purple line), Ethynyl-DTR (light green line), Th-DTR (orange line), and MeO-DTR (red line) containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a platinum disk working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. 
The present spectral shifts can be attributed to the electron-accepting nature of the DTR core and imply that substituents on thiophene have a significant effect on energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO as supported by the theoretical calculations (vide supra, Table S2, ESI†). The absorption spectra of these compounds in the thin-film state showed red-shifts as compared to those in the solution state (Fig. S3, ESI†) indicating the intermolecular interaction between the molecules. The chloroform solution of DTR, CN-DTR, and Py-DTR exhibited weak fluorescence (Fig. S4 and Table S3, ESI†). To evaluate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of each compound, cyclic voltammograms were recorded in a CH2Cl2 solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) at room temperature (Fig. 3B). While reversible two reduction waves were observed in all cases reflecting the stable reduction state, anodic scan was dependent on the compound structure. DTR and Ethynyl-DTR showed irreversible oxidation profiles, but the other compounds showed reversible or quasi-reversible oxidation profiles. It is to be noted that MeO-DTR exhibited reversible two oxidation waves and the electron-donating methoxy group can stabilize the oxidation state. The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO were calculated from the oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, and are listed in Table 2. The relatively low LUMO energy levels and two reduction waves in the narrow potential region (Table S4, ESI†) suggest that each compound maintains a high electron acceptability of DTR after the end-functionalization. The electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gaps (Eelectg) were in good accordance with the optical gaps (Eoptg) calculated from the absorption onset wavelengths in the UV-Vis absorption spectra. While these HOMO energy levels were consistent with DFT calculations (Table S5, ESI†), the LUMO energy levels were considerably different from the result of the DFT calculations. In order to predict the accurate LUMO energy levels of dithiarubicene derivatives, a higher calculation technique might be required.
Device application
The charge carrier transfer properties of OD-CN-DTR, OD-MeO-DTR, and EH-MeO-DTR were investigated with bottom-gate bottom-contact OFET devices using gold (Au) electrodes. As for the cyano-substituted DTR derivative, 2-octyldodecyl chains were introduced to ensure enough solubility for device fabrication (vide supra).
Because methoxylation did not decrease the solubility of the material, both 2-octyldodecyl and 2-ethylhexyl chains were substituted to evaluate the influence of alkyl chains on the OFET device performance. Active layers were formed on the hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)-treated silicone substrate by spin-coating using CHCl3 solutions at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Thin films were deposited from 1.0 wt% (OD-CN-DTR) and 0.5 wt% (OD-MeO-DTR and EH-MeO-DTR) CHCl3 solutions. The hole/electron mobilities, on/off current ratios, and threshold gate voltages are summarized in Table 3. Initially, the device performance was evaluated for as-cast samples in vacuo. All devices exhibited p-channel (hole-transporting) transistor characteristics. The hole mobility (μh = 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and on/off current ratio (Ion/Ioff = 104) of the OD-MeO-DTR-based device (Fig. S5A, ESI†) were superior compared to those of the OD-CN-DTR-based device (Fig. S5B (ESI†), μh = 8.2 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and Ion/Ioff = 102). These results definitely stem from the higher HOMO energy level of MeO-DTR as confirmed by the theoretical calculations (Table S1, ESI†) and electrochemical characterization (Fig. 3B and Table 2). On the other hand, EH-MeO-DTR having shorter alkyl chains exhibited a better hole mobility (μh = 5.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and thermal annealing at 100 °C for 1 h under vacuum further improved the device performance (Fig. 4A, μh = 8.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The different device characteristics between OD-MeO-DTR and EH-MeO-DTR will be discussed from the viewpoint of film morphology (vide infra). The device fabricated from OD-CN-DTR also showed n-channel (electron-transporting) transistor characteristics most likely due to the low-lying LUMO energy level (see, Table S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 3B, Table 2). Because the as-cast film exhibited a low electron mobility (μe = 2.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), we carried out thermal annealing at 100 and 150 °C for 1 h under vacuum for promoting the rearrangement of molecules on the substrate. After the thermal annealing at 100 °C, the electron mobility was substantially increased (Fig. 4B, μe = 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). On the other hand, the electron mobility was decreased after annealing at 150 °C. The output characteristics of devices based on these compounds showed a large contact resistance showing an S-shape of the IDSversus VDS curve (Fig. S6, ESI†).42 This is due to the interfacial injection barrier and caused by the energy mismatch between the FMO energy levels of the semiconducting materials and the work function of the Au source and drain electrodes as well as the insufficient metal–semiconductor interactions. We have introduced a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) to the metal electrode surface in order to reduce the contact resistance. Namely, Au electrodes were treated with 1-hexadecanethiol through the Au–S covalent bond and OFET performances were evaluated for OD-CN-DTR (n-type) and EH-MeO-DTR (p-type). Alkanethiols are known to decrease the work function to be adjusted as ca. 4.5 eV.43 From the energy levels of HOMO of EH-MeO-DTR (−4.77 eV) and LUMO of OD-CN-DTR (−3.56 eV), it can be observed that the manipulation of work function of Au electrodes by SAM modification was more effective for the EH-MeO-DTR-based device. As a result, a small decrease of contact resistance was observed and the hole mobility of EH-MeO-DTR was improved from 8.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the as-cast film (Fig. S8, ESI†).

 Fig. 4  Transfer plots of (A) EH-MeO-DTR and (B) OD-CN-DTR-based OFET devices fabricated on the HMDS-treated SiO2 insulation surface after thermal annealing at 100 °C. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the active layer were performed to obtain information on the molecular orientation in the thin film state as it is closely related to the OFET characteristics. The out-of-plane (2θ) profiles of thin films on the HMDS-treated SiO2 insulation surface after thermal annealing (OD-CN-DTR) and as-cast (OD-MeO-DTR) are shown in Fig. 5A and B, respectively. The small angle diffraction peaks attributed to the molecular organization were observed at 2θ = 2.74° (32.2 Å), 2.94° (30.1 Å), 5.44° (16.2 Å), 5.64° (15.7 Å), 8.16° (10.8 Å), and 8.32° (10.6 Å) for OD-CN-DTR and 2θ = 2.74° (32.2 Å), 5.52° (16.0 Å), and 8.04 (11.0 Å) for OD-MeO-DTR. While both films have a peak corresponding to the d spacing of 32.2 Å, closely spaced neighboring peaks (corresponding to 2θ = 2.74° and 2.94°) were observed for OD-CN-DTR implying the coexistence of two phase structures. Although these structures have not been clearly associated with their device characteristics, Qiao and Li et al. have also reported a similar diffraction pattern.44 The diffraction peaks in the wider angle region (2θ > 5°) could be assigned to the secondary and tertiary diffractions originating from the lamellar structure, and these diffraction patterns suggest that DTR molecules adopt an edge-on orientation on the substrate. The out-of-plane profile for the thin film of EH-MeO-DTR after thermal annealing is shown in Fig. 5C. The diffraction peak attributed to the edge-on molecular orientation was observed at 2θ = 4.72° (18.7 Å). Compared with that of the thin film of OD-MeO-DTR, the calculated d spacing is smaller in agreement with the shorter alkyl chains. Unfortunately, for all thin films, no diffraction peak in the in-plane direction was detected.

In order to investigate the relationship between the thin-film morphologies and device performances, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed. While the films fabricated from OD-CN-DTR and OD-MeO-DTR with 2-octyldodecyl chains possessed a similar morphology accompanying large domains, the film of EH-MeO-DTR showed a crystal-like nanostructure with a small domain (Fig. 6 and Fig. S7, ESI†). It is considered that the domain size depends on each alkyl chain of compounds and increased with the elongation of the alkyl chain length. The root-mean-square roughness (RRMS) of OD-CN-DTR, OD-MeO-DTR, and EH-MeO-DTR was 18.57, 14.85, and 9.73 nm, respectively. The difference of smoothness between OD-MeO-DTR and EH-MeO-DTR might result in low and high hole mobilities, respectively. Though soluble materials were obtained by attaching long branched alkyl chains and the FMO energy levels could be adjusted by the flanking group, the carrier trap at grain boundaries may be responsible for the low charge carrier mobilities.

Lastly, we have fabricated inverted OPV devices with the architecture ITO/ZnO/P3HT:OD-CN-DTR/MoO3/Ag using OD-CN-DTR as a non-fullerene acceptor material to evaluate the primary performance. The J–V curve is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and the OPV characteristics are summarized in Table S6 (ESI†). The devices fabricated from a chlorobenzene solution showed a better power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.21% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 0.84 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.56 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.44. The OD-CN-DTR film has an absorption band over 650 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†), which was observed in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the OPV device as a shoulder peak (Fig. S10, ESI†). Because OD-CN-DTR has a low crystallinity due to the small π-conjugated system and long branched alkyl chains, the continuous electron transport pathway might be broken down in the active layer comprised of donor/acceptor materials.
Conclusions
The fine tuning of the electronic structure of π-conjugated compounds is of much importance not only from the fundamental aspect but also from the application viewpoint in many electronic devices. For this purpose, end-functionalization of π-conjugated systems with flanking groups is a reliable methodology. In this paper, we have investigated the chemical functionalization of weakly anti-aromatic dithiarubicene (DTR) by metal-catalyzed coupling reactions on the basis of theoretical calculations. Introduction of substituents with different electronic properties was succeeded by the Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction, Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction, Rosenmund–von Braun reaction, and C–O coupling reaction. It can be observed from the absorption spectra and cyclic voltammograms that the optical and electrochemical properties of end-functionalized DTR derivatives are influenced by the electron-accepting nature of the DTR core and the electronic characteristics of flanking groups. OFET devices of CN-DTR and MeO-DTR exhibited p-channel transistor characteristics. Thanks to the higher HOMO energy level, the hole transporting performance of the MeO-DTR-based device was superior to that of the CN-DTR-based device. On the other hand, the device fabricated from CN-DTR also showed n-channel transistor characteristics due to the low-lying LUMO energy level. XRD measurements and AFM images of thin-films revealed that (1) these molecules adopt an edge-on orientation on the substrate, which is suitable for the facile charge carrier transport and (2) surface morphologies (domain size and smoothness) depend on the alkyl chain length of the materials. This work clearly shows that thiophene-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as DTR should be key players for optoelectronic applications in future.

All materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without purification unless otherwise noted. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dichloromethane (DCM) were purchased from Kanto Chemical Co. Other solvents were dried and distilled following the standard methods, and stored under a nitrogen atmosphere. Br-DTR and I-DTR as precursors were synthesized according to our previous study.181H- and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies were carried out on Bruker Avance III HD NanoBay 400 FT-NMR spectrometers using tetramethylsilane (1H-NMR) and solvent residual peaks (13C-NMR) as the internal standards. Melting points (MPs) were determined on a Yanaco micro melting point apparatus MP-500D. Elemental analyses (EA) were performed on an Elementar vario EL cube in the CHN mode. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1650 spectrophotometer using a 10 mm quartz cell or 10 mm × 50 mm quartz plate. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a BAS model 2323 bipotentiostat using a platinum disk working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode in a standard three-electrode cell. The voltammograms were collected in 0.1 M dichloromethane solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6), and the voltage–current characteristics were obtained at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Redox potentials were calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple to be 4.8 eV below the vacuum. Theoretical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 (Revision E.01) package of programs. Computational experiments were performed at the Research Center for Computational Science, Okazaki, Japan. OFET measurements were performed under vacuum conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using Bragg–Brentano geometry with CuKα radiation as an X-ray source with an acceleration voltage of 45 kV and a beam current of 200 mA. The scanning mode was set to 2θ–θ scans between 2° and 30° with a scanning step of 0.02°. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging was performed in tapping mode under ambient conditions with a Shimadzu instrument SPM9600.

Device fabrication and evaluation

OFET: Interdigital source and drain electrodes were constructed with gold (30 nm) that was formed on the thermally grown SiO2 layer (300 nm) on the gate substrate. The active layers were formed on hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)-treated SiO2 substrates by spin-coating using CHCl3 solutions at 1000 rpm for 60 s. The channel width (W), the channel length (L), and capacitance of the SiO2 dielectric layers (Ci) are 38 mm, 5 μm, and 10 nF cm−2, respectively. The hole and electron mobilities (μ) were determined from the equationIDS = W/(2L)Ciμ(VG/Vth),where IDS, VG, and Vth are the source–drain current, gate voltage, and threshold gate voltage, respectively.


OPV
          . 
Inverted OPV devices were fabricated with the architecture ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The active layer was spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution (20 mg mL−1) or chloroform solution (10 mg mL−1) using the mixture of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and OD-CN-DTR (1:1 weight ratio). The spin rate was 1000 rpm and the as-cast film was thermally annealed at 130 °C for 10 min. The photovoltaic characteristics were measured in air under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) (SAN-EI ELECTRIC, XES-301S). The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic devices were measured by using a KEITHLEY 2400 source meter. The EQE spectra were recorded by using a Soma Optics Ltd S-9240.
