    , Accepted 13th January 2020First published on 15th January 2020AbstractIn the present study, we investigated the role of constructed wetlands (CWs) integrated with a bioelectrochemical system (BES), which can concurrently treat wastewater effectively with energy recovery. This CW integrated system utilizes NH4+–N (96.66%), NO3−–N (83.09%), PO43−–P (91.04%) and SO42− (83.98%) to enable effective pollutant removal from sewage wastewater. Nitrite accumulation was not observed in the systems with applied voltage >15 mV and MFCs–ME. The ME-30-CWs system favours the removals of all pollutants, except ammonia. The average power density and current density of 1.723 mW m−2 and 5.423 mA m−2 were recorded in MFC–CWs during wastewater treatment. Bacteria causing waterborne diseases such as Shigella sp. and Salmonella sp. were significantly eliminated in the CW integrated system. The promising potential of CWs and bioelectrochemical technology can be an effective alternative to the water–energy nexus for waste stream applications.

Water impact
The main objective of this paper is to study the feasibility of the integrated constructed wetland–microelectrolysis system for wastewater treatment. Though studies of MFC–CW integration have been reported by researchers, in the present study we tried to integrate CWs into ME to make it self-sustained. The data presented in the manuscript are very useful in further designing ME–CWs ME treatment systems powered by the solar panel/intrinsic energy generated from the MFCs, an alternative solution to the water–energy nexus for wastewater treatment.

1. Introduction
Nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients are significantly present in municipal wastewater, and have traditionally been removed using tertiary biological, complex and energy-intensive nutrient removal processes.1–3 Although denitrification with exogenous carbon addition and chemical precipitation to remove phosphate (P) are well-established methods to meet nutrient discharge limits, facilities are seeking more efficient and cost-effective methods to meet their permits.4 Recently, various types of hybrid systems have also been developed by integrating constructed wetlands (CWs) with other treatment systems.5 The use of bioelectrochemical systems (BES) in hydrogen and electricity generation is a novel and useful wastewater treatment technology.6,7 The constructed wetland–microbial fuel cell (CW–MFC) has been an emerging technology in recent years, allowing simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity generation.8,9
However, many CWs exhibit limited and fluctuating reductions in nitrogen levels, with removal efficiencies less than 50%.10 An electrolysis system11 and MFC system7 have been demonstrated to intensify nitrogen removal from wastewater. Nowadays, a very promising variety of MFCs are being studied, consisting of integrating MFC technology into natural ecosystems or into an inexpensive environmental remediation technology. Integrating MFC technology with CWs is of interest to scientists because of improved wastewater treatment performance and some other advantages.12,13 It has been documented that the incorporation of MFC technology in CWs can improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment by 27–49% compared to normal CWs.14 The same principle is observed in the MEC, but a small amount of power from an external power source is applied to the device to produce H2 in the cathode by reducing protons.15,16 In the denitrification process, H2 can be used instead of the organic carbon source that could transform NO3− into N gas by the following equation: 2NO3− + 5H2 → N2 + 4H2O + 2OH−(1)
The integration of electron transfer using a conductive material (artificial electron acceptor) into a horizontal subsurface constructed wetland (HSSF-CW–MFC) improved the COD removal by 33.7% in comparison to the hindered electron transfer (system run in an open circuit).17
Iron scraps (ISs) and granular activated carbon (GAC) particles in interaction with wastewater form many tiny galvanic cells between the IS particles and activated carbon (AC).18 Having a high surface area (500–3000 m2 g−1) and electrical conductivity, low-cost characteristics, and high performance, AC is a cheaper alternative anode material for MFCs.19 An anode fabricated by rolling Fe3O4 into AC on stainless steel mesh (SSM) increased the maximum power density by 22% more than AC on an SSM only.20 The electroactive microbes as firm biofilms on the anode serve as biocatalysts in a typical bioelectrochemical system.21–23
In this context, in the present study, the following specific objectives were pursued. The long-term treatment performance of CW integration with MFCs and MECs was evaluated for removal of N–NH4+, N–NO3−, N–NO2−, TN, TP, SO42− and COD along with electricity production. Further, the scope of this work was extended to monitor the microbial communities and microbial density present in the integrated CW systems. Here we utilized the low cost and high surface area commercial grade graphite electrodes instead of costly electrode catalysts.
2. Materials and methods
The experimental methods reported for the collection of the wastewater and further feeding into the CWs have adapted from an earlier study.24 The municipal sewage wastewater was collected in 2 × 25 L plastic containers from the Sewage Treatment Plant, Saragasan, 3rd Capital Project Division, Gandhinagar, Gujarat (India) just before feeding to the CWs. Untreated municipal sewage wastewater, a typical representation of high strength wastewater, was used as the influent source. The collected untreated municipal wastewater was kept for settling the suspended solids for about half an hour before feeding to the CWs. The influent was introduced from the bottom through the 1.5 cm diameter base perforated centrally fixed pipes, while the effluent was drained from the middle outlet at 15 cm depth.
2.1. MFC and MEC system integration and operation
The configuration descriptions of the microbial fuel cell (MFC) and microbial electrolysis system (MES) integrated with CWs for sewage wastewater treatment are presented in Fig. 1. The laboratory-scale CWs consist of a transparent acrylic column (H × D: 30 × 19 cm), gravel (5 to 15 mm), GAC (2–4 mm), iron scraps (ISs), graphite rods (6 mm dia and 12 inch length) and a perforated PVC pipe (L × D: 35× 2 cm) purchased from the local market, Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad, Gujrat (India). The gravel was washed with tap water before use. The graphite rods were further cut to 6 inches in length (area 0.002828 m2) for installation into CWs as electrodes. Out of 8.5 L total volume, the packing materials occupy 2.83 L and the remaining 4.53 L was available as the working volume. The acrylic column (H × D: 30 × 19 cm) in duplicate was constructed as the CW within the premises of the Central University of Gujarat, 30 Sector, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India (latitude and longitude 23.237901° N, 72.669107° E). The base perforated PVC pipe (L × D: 35 × 2 cm) was centrally fixed up to the bottom in each CW to facilitate inlet.24 Two sampling ports at a height of 5 cm and 15 cm were provided for sample collection. Stoppers were used to close or open the sampling ports. The plants were accommodated in the top vacant space (3.0 cm) kept in the CWs.
 Fig. 1  Schematic configuration of MFC–CWs and MEC–CWs integrated with constructed wetlands. 
The designs of MFC–CWs and, ME–CWs are described in the following section. The first bottom layer was filled with 1 cm GAC (300 g, size 2–4 mm). The two graphite electrodes were placed horizontally at 6 cm apart from each other in the bottom layer. The anodes were placed at the bottom considering comparatively more anaerobic conditions, suitable for anodic reactions. The second layer, 4 cm in thickness, was composed of 15 mm gravel (2 kg). The third layer of 3 cm thickness was composed of ISs (250 g). The fourth 4 cm thick layer was composed of 10 mm gravel (2 kg), followed by a similar in thickness fifth layer composed of 5 mm gravel (2 kg). Further, the sixth 1 cm thick layer was constructed with 2–4 mm GAC (300 g).
Similarly, two graphite rods as cathodes were horizontally placed 6 cm apart from each other on the top GAC layer. The cathodes were located near the plant's rhizospheric regions, with the idea of having an aerobic zone due to diffusion of air from the immediate outer atmosphere and the plant's rhizospheric regions. Thus, the cathodes were located just below the root system of Eichhornia crassipes. The vertical distance between the anodes and cathodes was 17 cm. Therefore, the anodes were positioned at 1 cm above the bottom to fulfill the suitability of anodic reactions. The periphery of the CWs was covered with aluminum foil to prevent the growth of periphyton (periphytic algae).

Voltage measurement. 
The voltage (mV) and current (I) output were recorded using a Multimeter (Fluke 106 Palm-Sized Digital Multimeter). An AC to DC power supplier (1 mV to 1 V) adaptor (INVOTECH, DC 9 V) was purchased from the local market, Gandhinagar, Gujarat (India). The power density was calculated by dividing the power and current by the anode surface area (m2). The electrodes were connected using insulated copper wires and copper clamps across a 10 Ohm resistor.


Operation. 
The MFC–CWs were started with the filling of untreated sewage wastewater on 24th April 2017. All the MFC–CWs were filled and decanted with sewage wastewater from 26th April 2017 to 06th July 2017 at a two day interval for the acclimation of indigenous microbes. Electricity generation was measured four times in day time at 3 h intervals throughout the study period. The microbial community and microbial density (cfu) count were analyzed at a ten day interval during the stabilization period. The filling of untreated sewage wastewater was started on 06th July 2017 with the addition of plants, whereas actual sample analysis was started on 13th July 2017 and continued up to 13th October 2017. The CW integrated systems were operated for nearly 414 days.


Treatment phases. 
The sewage wastewater treatment phases operated in CW–MFCs are as follows:
Phase-I: this phase was started after the completion of the stabilization period of 90 days. In this phase, CW–MFCs and CW–ME, applied with 1.5 mV, were operated at 48 h HRT for 90 days.
Phase-II: a new set of CW–MEs with similar configurations was also operated at an applied voltage of 30 mV. The CW–MEs operated in phase-I were further applied with 15 mV. Further, the CW systems were filled and decanted with treated sewage wastewater for 40 days at 48 h HRT. The filling of untreated sewage wastewater was carried out for 73 days with the addition of fresh plants, whereas actual sample analysis was carried out for 61 days. The CW–MFCs were also operated in a parallel manner and monitored for electricity generation.
Phase-III: based on the significant observations at 48 h HRT, the respective CW–MEs operated during phase II were further operated at 12 h HRT. Filling and decanting of the treated sewage wastewater were conducted for 18 days at an interval of 2 days before the start of phase-III. The actual sample analysis was carried out until the completion of 16 cycles at 12 h HRT, one week after filling of untreated sewage wastewater in the CWs. Similarly, the CW–MFCs were again operated in a parallel manner and monitored for electricity generation.
Phase-IV: the CW–MEs operated at 30 mV were integrated with a MFC–CW system operated in a parallel manner for external voltage supply at 12 h HRT. Similarly, the integrated system was filled and decanted with treated sewage water for 40 days at an interval of 2 days. The treatment performance was measured by completing the 30 cycles at 12 h HRT with the filling of the untreated sewage wastewater one week before starting the analysis of the samples.

2.2. Plant collection and adaptation

Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth), 4–5 saplings of plants of uniform length (4–6 cm root hair rhizome) and weight (25–30 g), were adapted before being transferred in the CWs.24 After a week of adaptation, the plants having a similar size were planted in the CWs. Any plant that died during the treatment processes was quickly replaced with new young ones.
2.3. Microbial analysis
The microbial community and microbial density in the MFC–CWs and ME–CWs effluents were analyzed at a 10 day interval during the stabilization period as well as at the end of each treatment phase. The community's analyses include the cfu count, microbial morphological test, strike plate, Gram staining, and biochemical tests. The morphological and physiological characteristics were measured using biochemical analysis25 followed by the identification of strains.26 The pure culture was obtained by further sub-culturing of the colonies in a range of media including nutrient agar (NA), incubated at 37 °C for 24–36 h.
2.4. Analytical methods
Physicochemical parameters including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analyzed using standard methods.27 The NH4+–N, NO3−–N, NO2−–N, SO42− and total PO43−–P were analyzed27 using a Dynamica HOLO DB-20 UV-VIS double beam spectrophotometer. All the results are expressed as mean ± S.D.
2.5. Statistical analysis and calculations
Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of various CW configurations on pollutant removal. The actual pollutants loaded in the CWs were calculated by considering the residual and influent concentrations in the respective CWs.24 Statistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel 2016 version. Data analysis included all parameters, calculations, means and standard deviations in the influent and effluent pollutant levels. Nitrification and denitrification rates were calculated as reported in a previous study.28

Eqn (2) was used to determine the current (I) as per Ohm's law. (2)where V is the cell voltage and R (Ω) is the external resistance.29

Eqn (3) was used to determine the power output (W). P = I × V(3)where I is the current (A) and V is the cell voltage. Moreover, the power density was also calculated using the anode surface area (m2).29
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Sewage wastewater characteristics
Though the concentrations of pollutants in sewage wastewater are relatively low, the quantum discharge of sewage is huge; therefore it can be an important source of pollution. The average effluent bulk pH recorded increased to 7.66 ± 0.18 from 7.53 ± 0.22 to between 7.49 and 8.15, whereas in the influent, the bulk pH ranged from 7.17 to 7.86. The increase in the pH might be due to the influence of the electrolysis in the CW–ME system. Similarly, Yuan et al., (2013), recorded an increase in pH to 10 in the cathode vicinity for the system having bulk pH at 7.30 The decrease in EC to 1.71 ± 0.07 mS cm−1 from 1.92 ± 0.05 mS cm−1 might be due to the reduction in the dissolved solids, indicating the salt precipitation/removal in the MFC–CWs. The precipitation of the coexisting cations (Ca2+) and anions (phosphate) on the cathode surface removes the TDS without adding any chemicals to the bioelectrochemical system during domestic wastewater treatment.31 The TDS varies between 811.0 mg L−1 and 889.0 mg L−1 in the MFC–CWs effluent with an average level of 843.93 mg L−1. The average DO increased to 0.85 ± 0.26 mg L−1 in the discharge, whereas it was 0.43 ± 0.06 mg L−1 in the influent.
3.2. Overall pollutant removal efficiency in MFC–CWs and ME–CWs

3.2.1. Nitrogenous component removal. 
Ammonia. 

Table 1 summarizes the NH4+–N concentrations in the influent and effluent wastewater from the MFC–CWs and ME–CWs. NH4+ was highly fluctuating in sewage wastewater during the assessment period (Fig. 2). The highest concentration of NH4+ with the median line at 64.05 mg L−1 was recorded during phase-IV, followed by phase-II. However, the NH4+ discharge pattern was almost similar with almost equal removal of 96.54% and 95.48% in the MFC–CWs and ME-1.5-CWs, respectively, during phase-I. This might be due to the lower applied potential to ME-1.5-CWs. These findings confirm that the application of 1.5 mV did not significantly impact the NH4+ removal process, indicating the requirement of high bio-electrochemical energy consumption by NH4+ species. The highest average NH4+–N concentration of 64.05 ± 10.0 mg L−1 was observed in phase-IV, whereas it was lowest (7.11 ± 2.66 mg L−1) in phase-I. The average ammonia removal was more than 90% in the CWs during phase-I and II. Increasing the applied voltage could maintain the ammonia removal at 91.57% and 96.66% in the ME-15-CWs and ME-30-CWs, respectively, even at elevated loading of NH4+ (approx. four times higher) during phase-II. Similarly, the feasible removal and recovery of NH4+ and P nutrients have been demonstrated under different applied voltages using capacitive deionization (CDI).32 The removal efficiency was maintained to 77.27% and 88.39% in the ME-15-CWs and ME-30-CWs, respectively when operated at 12 h HRT during phase-III. Moreover, the self-sustained system (MFC–ME) during phase-IV, was also well-performing at 12 h HRT with significant ammonia removal. The integration of ME–MFCs (p = 0.113) as a self-sustained system reduced the ammonia removal rate compared to the independent MFCs (p = 0.759). However, the ammonia removal rate was sustained at the level of ME-15-CWs and ME-30-CWs, in the integrated ME–MFCs system even at a higher loading of 18.11 ± 0.707 gm m−2 h−1 (Table 1). An almost linear relationship for the nitrification (R2 = 0.8479) and denitrification (R2 = 0.7808) processes was observed with increasing applied voltage. So a higher applied voltage enhanced the NH4+–N removal in the integrated CWs. The NH4+–N removal could be boosted under anaerobic conditions on the anode with a higher current generation in the MFC.33 Similarly, the removal efficiency of NH4+–N was further promoted to 97.3% in a closed circuit MFC under 4RAC working conditions.34

 Fig. 2  Influent concentrations and impacts of different treatment processes on ammonia and nitrite concentrations. 
Nitrate removal. 
The concentrations of nitrate in the influent and effluent are presented in Table 1. The average nitrate removal efficiency in the MFC–CWs was 56.39%. The enhanced nitrate removal and its distribution pattern were observed as a result of improvement in the denitrification process by the integration of the MFC–CWs system (Fig. 3). ME-30-CWs removed a higher concentration of nitrate (83.09%) in phase-II, which may be due to the lowest loading of 0.02 ± 0.003 gm m−2 h−1 of nitrate. Bio-electrolysis probably plays an important role in maintaining the nitrate removal at 77.88% and 72.17%, even at a quite high loading of 0.09 ± 0.007 gm m−2 h−1 and 0.10 ± 0.003 gm m−2 h−1 in ME-30-CWs and MFC–CWs, respectively, despite being operated at lower HRT (12 h). The NH4+–N to NO3−–N conversion in ME–MFC integrated system mainly depends on the presence of limited oxygen diffusion in the system. Together, nitrate and nitrite can be utilized for autotrophic N reduction on the cathode;35 under sufficient availability of electrons, the electrons transferred from the anode to the cathode resulting in a better affinity for NO3− reduction compared to NO2– reduction.36
 Fig. 3  Influent concentrations and impacts of different treatment processes on nitrate and total nitrogen concentrations. 
Nitrite removal. 
The NO2− concentrations in the influent and effluent of CWs are presented in Table 1. Its discharge patterns over the time course and the concentration gradient between the influent and effluent showed its significant transformation rather than removal (Fig. 2). The broader and elevated NO2− distribution shows the accumulation of more nitrite in MFC–CWs (p = 0.742) in comparison to ME-1.5-CWs (p = 0.108) in phase-1. The higher oxidation rate (NH4+ > NO2−) results in elevated nitrite accumulation in MFC–CWs and ME-1.5-CWs, which possibly might be due to the limited DO levels in MFC–CWs and ME-1.5-CWs, resulting in inhibition of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. This finding is not in accordance with that reported in the literature wherein nitrite-N could be used as an electron donor in the anode of the MFC which promoted nitrite-N removal.37 Meanwhile other integrated systems were able to successfully maintain a lower level of nitrite-N. The highest nitrite conversion of 77.57–80.15% was achieved in ME-30-CWs, despite having a lower HRT than 12 h, which might be due to the maintenance of the system at 30 mV voltage supply. An almost equal rate of nitrification (MFC, 0.126 and ME, 0.118) and denitrification (MFC, 0.103 and ME, 0.096) was observed in phase-I in the MFCs and ME–CWs. So, the applied voltage over 15 mV promoted the needed denitrification reactions. Due to the partial nitrification process, the higher rate of ammonification than nitrification was reported in the simultaneous partial nitrification, anammox and denitrification (SNAD).38
The applied voltages of 15 mV and 30 mV increased the average rates of both nitrification to 53.77 ± 7.32 gN m−2 d and 56.83 ± 8.04 gN m−2 d and denitrification to 22.724 ± 3.08 gN m−2 d and 24.067 ± 3.37 gN m−2 d, respectively, in phase-II. The MFC–CWs recorded NO2−–N accumulation in phases I and IV, despite having more than double the rates of nitrification and denitrification in the later phase than the earlier phase. Almost equally situated median lines are observed in the effluents of ME–CWs and MFC–CWs, indicating the much lower impact in accumulation of NO2− (Fig. 2). Perhaps this may due to the much lower average rate of denitrification of 10.604 gN m−2 d and 12.07 gN m−2 d in the ME–CWs and MFCs, respectively, which in turn was higher than phase-I and phase-III, although lower than phase-II. Interestingly, the system having the higher rate of denitrification showed the lower rate of nitrification and vice versa. The ME–CWs system achieves only 5.61% of nitrite removal, which indicates the lower voltage was supplied from the MFCs to the ME–CWs system, however, the supplied voltage was enough to prevent the nitrite accumulation. This finding confirmed that the electrochemical motive force was a dominant driving force for its removal.
Total nitrogen removal. 

Table 1 and Fig. 3 show the TN removal efficiency and the distribution pattern in various CWs. ME-30-CWs achieved the highest denitrification (p = 0.48623) with an average of 95.93% removal in phase-II. Interestingly, the increase in applied voltage enhanced the rate of denitrification from 22.72 ± 3.08 gN m−2 d to 24.07 ± 3.38 gN m−2 d. The highest TN removal was observed in the MFC system (phase-I, p = 0.774) as well as that integrated with the ME system (phase-IV, p = 0.109). The lowest TN removal of 64.03% and 78.72% in the ME–CWs (p = 0.005) and MFC–CWs (p = 0.109), respectively, might be due to the resistance of the system or the higher loading of 18.23 ± 0.706 gm m−2 h−1 of the TN. The increasing applied voltages of 1.5 mV to 30 mV increase the TN removal in the ME systems (R2 = 0.9827), and even the pollutant loading was increased from 0.53 ± 0.194 to 2.09 ± 0.289 gm m−2 h−1. However, the elevated pollutant loading decreases the TN removal potential in the CWs (R2 = 0.4785), even after increasing the voltage from 1.5 to 30 mV and the self-integration of the MFCs with ME. The availability of the carbon source determines the TN removal during nitrification and denitrification.38 Electrochemical reduction or autotrophic denitrification removes the nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors in the MFCs.35,39,40


3.2.2. Sulfate, phosphate and COD removal. 
Sulfate removal. 
The sulfate concentrations in the influent and effluent wastewater from the CWs are shown in Table 1. The narrow discharge distribution pattern of sulfate was observed in the CWs applied with 30 mV (Fig. 4). The MFC–CWs achieved 88.37% sulfate removal, despite being loaded with the highest level of 18.22 ± 0.489 gm m−2 h−1 in phase-IV. Though sulfate-rich wastewaters are thermodynamically not favorable, the increasing applied voltage improves the sulfate removal to 20% at 400 mV.41 In the present study, the linear relationship between sulfate removal and increasing voltage was also observed (p = 0.044; R2 = 0.995) during phase-I. Sulfate removal may take place through different reasons viz due to the activity of the SRB,42 wetland matrix immobilization, metal sulfide precipitates, elemental sulfur and plant uptake in the wetlands.43 The lower DO level (∼0.85 ± 0.26 mg L−1) might promote the SRB activities, which in turn synergistically with the electrochemical system resulted in sulfate reduction of 57.55% to 85.41% in ME-1.5-CWs and ME-30-CWs, respectively. However, the MFC–CWs showed 88.37% sulfate removal, even a little higher than ME-30-CWs.
 Fig. 4  Influent concentrations and impacts of different treatment processes on total phosphate and sulfate concentrations. 
Phosphate removal. 
The phosphate removal in the CWs might be influenced by the substrate, wetland vegetation, microbial immobilization, and precipitation.44–46 The average P in the influent and the discharge pattern in the effluent throughout the experiment are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 4. The highest P removal of 91.04% during phase-II might be due to the higher HRT (48 h) and its lower level to 1.65 ± 0.20 mg L−1 in the influent. The regression analysis of the P removal versus applied voltage indicated a linear relationship (R2 = 0.997). This might be due to higher OH− formation in the electrode's vicinity with increasing applied voltage, as inferred from the increase in average bulk pH (7.66 ± 0.18 from 7.53 ± 0.22). Likewise, the self-sustained integrated system sufficiently maintained the P removal at 56.24% and 72.95% in ME–CWs and MFC–CWs, respectively, in phase-IV, which was almost equal to the CWs in phase-I, despite having a six times higher loading of the pollutant. The ligand exchange reaction mechanism mainly removes the P by displacing water or hydroxyls on the surface of Fe hydrous oxides.47 So improved TP removal efficiency was observed with increasing Fe as ISs in the substrate. Similar results with increasing average local pH around the electrodes with a net increase in the bulk pH have been reported,30 which result in solid species formation from the soluble calcium phosphate on the cathode surface, as in abiotic electrochemical systems.48,49
COD removal. 
Much lower variations in the discharge pattern and removal efficiencies were observed in average COD (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Interestingly, despite having different HRTs, the COD removal efficiencies in ME-15-CWs (phase-II), ME-15-CWs (phase-III) and ME–CWs (phase-IV) were almost similar and vary between 72.3% and 75.3%. Moreover, COD removal efficiencies in MFC–CWs, ME-1.5-CWs, and ME-30-CWs were almost similar, ranging from 83–85% in all the phases. These results reflect the influence of variable external voltage supply on the microbial diversity which in turn affects COD removal. All the integrated CWs were able to maintain the narrower distribution pattern of COD in the discharge (Fig. 5). Similar results for enhancing the metabolic decomposition rate of microbes by improving the biodegradability of an SPE-WTP were observed with the addition of iron–carbon.41 The higher organic matter oxidation by increasing the metabolic rate of anaerobic bacteria by accepting the terminal electrons from the anode has been reported for MFCs.50

3.2.3. Bioelectricity generation and microbial community analysis. 
Bioelectricity generation. 
The MFC–CWs were operated for more than three months to obtain stable performance before the start of the treatment phases (Fig. 5). The MFC produces positive current without the addition of an external substrate, suggesting that the bio-anode can oxidize the organics matter present in the sewage wastewater. During the initial stabilization phase (26th April 2017 to 5th July 2017), an overall increasing trend was observed with an average output of 373.01 mV (2.375 mW m−2 and 6.368 mA m−2), which was highly fluctuating, ranging from 63 mV (0.068 mW m−2 and 1.075 mA m−2) to 537 mV (4.923 mW m−2 and 9.167 mA m−2). The high average output during the stabilization phase might be due to the availability of the easily biodegradable COD present in the treated sewage wastewater consumed by the microbes. The anodes with enough active biofilms exhibit enhanced electron transferability.51 In terms of output, an overall constant trend was observed during the treatment phase (13th July 2017 to 13 Sep 2017). After addition of plants, the average output was 277.85 mV (1.318 mW m−2 and 4.743 mA m−2) having a minimum of 141.0 mV (0.339 mW m−2 and 2.407 mA m−2) and a maximum of 508.0 mV (4.405 mW m−2 and 8.672 mA m−2). The power output gradually decreased but not completely vanished, maybe due to certain adaptive microbial populations, which were able to survive under the pollutant loading. The fluctuation might be due to multiple factors in terms of the presence of electron acceptors due to the variation in the composition of the influent. The average and maximum voltage output achieved were 113 mV and 126 mV during the MFC and ME integration (phase-IV) having a current density of 2.151 mA m−2.
As expected, the decreasing voltage in MFC–CWs indicates fouling on the electrodes. The accumulated OH− on the air cathode surface lowers the cathode capacity and inhibits power generation due to heterotrophic biofilm overgrowth in the MFCs.52,53 A 32.3% decrease in power production was observed due to the fouling of the membrane.54 After replacing the new healthy plants, there was an increase in voltage (curly brackets −4), which may be due to more oxygen diffusion from healthy plants. The high concentrations of the root exudates (mostly electrons donors),55 the substances extremely degradable to microorganisms may increase the output voltages. The output voltage was stable between 139 and 172 days of the operation of the CWs (curly brackets −5).
Microbial community analysis. 
The microbial phyla found in the MFC–CWs and ME–CWs include the dominant Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and numerous unclassified microbial communities. Most of the adapted microbial communities found were Alcaligenes faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroide and Bacillus subtilus. Interestingly, new phyla of Actinobacteria species such as Micrococcus luteus and Corynebacterium xerosis were found to be adapted in MFC–CWs. The statistical analysis shows the strongest positive correlating pairing in Shigella dysenteriae and Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Salmonella sp. The strongly negatively correlated (p = −0.612) Shigella sp. and Salmonella sp., causing waterborne diseases, were observed during the stabilization period. However, at the end of the cycle, Shigella sp. was absent in the MFC–CWs, whereas Salmonella sp. was present in the ME–CWs. The cfu count of 8.5 × 103 to 1.34 × 104 was observed in the treated effluent collected from the STP. However, the increasing microbial cfu counts of 8.8 × 103 and 1.34 × 104 in the MFC–CWs and 5.3 × 103 and 3.35 × 104 in the ME–CWs observed at 101 dilution factors indicate the microbial establishment in the CWs. Previous researchers have confirmed Proteobacteria as the electrochemically active bacteria in microbial fuel cell reactors.56,57Pseudomonas sp. is recorded as an electrochemically active organism contributing to the transfer of electrons.58

Conclusion
These outcomes display that the MFC–CWs (bioelectricity generation), the ME–CWs in phase-II, and the MFC–ME–CWs in phase-IV, self-sustained system could provide significant concurrent prospects for nutrient removal and energy recovery from sewage wastewater. Most of the integrated systems sufficiently enhanced the pollutant removal with increasing applied voltage. The average power density and the current density of 1.723 mW m−2 and 5.423 mA m−2 were achieved in MFC–CWs. The proposed integrated CW–BES system could be constructed by integrating CWs with a renewable energy source (photovoltaic cell) for efficient pollutant removal. This bioelectrochemical CW integrated system can be a new alternative for nutrient and energy recovery.

Water impact
The main objective of this paper is to study the feasibility of the integrated constructed wetland–microelectrolysis system for wastewater treatment. Though studies of MFC–CW integration have been reported by researchers, in the present study we tried to integrate CWs into ME to make it self-sustained. The data presented in the manuscript are very useful in further designing ME–CWs ME treatment systems powered by the solar panel/intrinsic energy generated from the MFCs, an alternative solution to the water–energy nexus for wastewater treatment.
