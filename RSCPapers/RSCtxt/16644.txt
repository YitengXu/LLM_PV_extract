Finding suitable materials to modify the TiO2 semiconductor layer can effectively reduce electron recombination. Ferroelectric compounds are important materials with excellent ferroelectric and dielectric properties. One of the characteristics of this kind of material is that their positive and negative charges do not coincide in the lattice structure, thus it will form a spontaneous polarization field. The inherent electric field can effectively separate photogenerated electrons and holes, therefore, the introduction of ferroelectric materials into DSSCs may effectively improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the cells. We used a sandwich-type ferroelectric polyoxometalate KNa3[HPro]7[Sm(α-PW11O39)2]·Pro·18H2O (Sm) (Pro = D-proline) to modify the photoanode of DSSCs for the first time. The results show that photogenerated electrons can transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to the LUMO energy level of Sm and then to the external circuit. Electrochemical tests show that when Sm is combined with TiO2 to modify the photoanode of DSSCs, the Jsc and PCE reached 15.13 mA cm−2 and 6.82%, respectively. The PCE is 21.8% higher than that of pure TiO2. As a result, ferroelectric polyoxometalate Sm is a good electron transfer medium that can reduce electron–hole recombination and increase the electron lifetime. The incorporation of functional ferroelectric materials into solar cells is a promising strategy to improve photovoltaic devices.
Introduction
The use of fossil energy has caused serious environmental problems, making the search for alternative green energy urgent. Solar is an important renewable and clean energy source. One of the most common ways to harness solar energy is through solar cells.1 DSSCs are an attractive technology in the scope of solar cell devices because of their low price, simple manufacturing process and high energy conversion efficiency. DSSCs consist of dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanodes, electrolyte and photocathodes. When the dye is excited by light, the excited dye molecules inject electrons into the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor. However, the transport of electrons in DSSCs depends on the gradient diffusion of electrons. Since there is no internal driving process, electrons are easily captured by holes during the long-term diffusion process and recombine with the dye and electrolyte, which results in the loss of charge in the cells.2 The key to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs is to improve the transfer rates of electrons and reduce electron recombination.3
A series of studies have shown that using functional materials to modify the semiconductor photoanodes is an effective way to promote electron transport and reduce electron–hole recombination. Ferroelectric materials have ferroelectric, pyroelectric, piezoelectric and special photovoltaic properties. In recent years, research in ferroelectric photovoltaic materials has gained unprecedented attention.4,5 The crystal structure of ferroelectric materials is non-centrosymmetric and the electric dipoles spontaneously arrange along the crystal axis under the Curie temperature to complete the phase transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric phase, which is called spontaneous polarization. In spontaneous polarization, bound charges appear around the surface near both ends of the ferroelectric polarization vector and form a permanent electric field. Because the electrostatic shielding effect on the dipole surface of ferroelectric materials in the charge non-equilibrium system is very small, an effective dipole electric field can be generated to separate photogenerated electrons and holes and facilitate electron transfer.2 Yuan proved that the built-in electric field generated by a ferroelectric polymer led to an increased open circuit voltage (Voc).6 Nalwa confirmed that the existence of the local electric field enhanced the dissociation of photogenerated electrons, thus enhancing the photocurrent density (Jsc) and the filling factor (FF).7 Lan et al.8 observed an increased PCE of inverted PSCs by adopting a dual phase SrTiO3/ZnO nanocomposite film as a cathodic buffer layer and verified that the spontaneous polarization of SrTiO3 induced a self-induced electric field to prevent electron recombination at the interface of the active layer and the buffer layer. Kim et al.9 found that the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials can promote electron–hole separation and promote electron transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to TiO2, which led to improved photovoltaic performance. The above studies shows that ferroelectric materials are excellent candidates to improve the performance of cells.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are ionic metal oxygen clusters. Due to their excellent electron storage and transmission capacity, they are widely used in molecular catalysis, magnetic materials, electronics, optics, medicine and other fields.10–15 The empty d orbitals in the structure of polyoxoanions can accept electrons without changing the structure and promote electron transfer. We have shown in several studies that polyoxometalates are promising candidates to modify DSSC photoanodes.16–22 At present, the synthesis and performance research of ferroelectric polyoxometalates have attracted extensive attention. Zheng et al. reported the first kind of ferroelectric polyoxometalate 3D MOF, [Cu3(4,4′-bpy)5]2[H2SiW11O39]·5H2O.23 Based on the above considerations and the advantages of ferroelectric materials and polyoxometalates, the introduction of ferroelectric polyoxometalates into the photoanode of DSSCs is an important way to improve the performance of the device. It is noteworthy that there have been no reports on the use of ferroelectric polyoxometalates in DSSCs. Because of the following reasons, this paper may provide reference value for the scholars who study ferroelectric materials. First of all, compared with most ordinary polyoxometalates, the ferroelectric polyoxometalate used in this study has an appropriate HOMO energy level, which can speed up electron transfer and avoid electron recombination. Secondly, ferroelectric polyoxometalates can form a spontaneous electric field, which can effectively reduce electron–hole recombination and significantly improve the efficiency of the device. Finally, ferroelectric polyoxometalates have many promising properties, such as piezoelectricity, dielectricity, pyroelectricity and so on. The application prospects of ferroelectric polyoxometalates are more diverse compared with ordinary polyoxometalates.
In this paper, the ferroelectric polyoxometalate Sm is used to modify the photoanode of DSSCs for the first time. The calculation results of the Kubelka–Munk function show that the LUMO energy level of Sm is slightly lower than that of the CB of the semiconductor TiO2. As a result, Sm can be used as an electron acceptor to accelerate electron transfer and reduce electron–hole recombination. At the same time, the addition of Sm to TiO2 can enhance the absorption of ultraviolet light. Compared with pure P25, the PCE increased by 21.8% and the photovoltaic performance improved obviously. It is further proved that ferroelectric materials have unique surface/interface charge characteristics. The built-in electric field generated by spontaneous polarization can effectively separate electron–hole pairs and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency.
Results and discussion
The infrared (IR) spectrum of Sm (Fig. S1†), the vibration absorption bands of the Keggin-type phosphotungstate skeleton appear at 1093, 1042; 943; 886 and 819, 757, 711 cm−1. They are attributed to V(P–Oa), V(W–Ot), V(W–Ob) and V(W–Oc), separately. The V(W–Oc) band of the [α-PW11O39]7− fragment of Sm splits into three peaks due to its low symmetry. The resonance responses at 3145 and 2968 cm−1 correspond to V(N–H) and V(C–H) stretching vibrations. The peaks at 1615 and 1451 cm−1 are attributed to V(N–H) and V(C–H) bending vibrations.24 The strong absorption of the V(O–H) stretching vibration at 3494 cm−1 is attributed to crystal water and the bending vibration of V(O–H) in crystal water is at 1618 cm−1.25 The V(N–H) and V(O–H) bending vibration bands overlap in the IR spectrum of Sm.26 The vibration bands at 1367 and 1244 cm−1 are attributed to V(C–N). The strong absorption peak at 1724 cm−1 indicates that a –COOH group is present.27 The existence of the characteristic peaks confirm the presence of Pro in Sm. The results further prove that the synthesized ferroelectric compound matches the reference.26 The purity of Sm is determined by power X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Fig. S2†). It can be seen from Fig. S2† that the peak positions of the PXRD spectrum are consistent with that of the reference,26 indicating that Sm has good phase purity. The differences in the intensity may be due to the variation in the preferred orientation of the powder sample. The solid UV spectrum of Sm shows a strong absorption band centered at 252 nm (Fig. S3†). The high energy absorption band can be attributed to the pπ–dπ charge transition of the Ot → W bond.28 It can also be observed that Sm has a wide light absorption range. It should be noted that Sm has strong absorption in the ultraviolet region, which is conducive for the capture of light.
Solid diffuse reflection is used to estimate the bandwidth of Sm. We use the Kubelka–Munk function F to plot the energy E of Sm (Fig. 1a).29 The energy axis and the extrapolation line of the linear region of the absorption edge intersect at a certain point whose quantitative value is the Eg of Sm, so the Eg of Sm is estimated to be 3.523 eV. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is widely used to study the electrochemical characteristics of materials. The first reduction peak of the CV curve is used to estimate the LUMO energy level of Sm.30 In Fig. 1b, the intersection of two tangents forms a vertical line. The LUMO level of Sm is −0.577 V vs. AgCl, corresponding to −0.387 V vs. NHE and −3.923 eV vs. vacuum. It is worth noting that the LUMO energy level of Sm is slightly lower than the CB energy level of TiO2, so it can easily form a potential barrier to facilitate electron transfer from TiO2 to Sm, then to the external circuit. So, Sm can be used as an electron transport medium to reduce electron–hole recombination effectively.

The SEM images of P25 and Sm@TiO2/P25 are shown in Fig. 2. The particle size of P25 nanoparticles is slightly smaller than that of 5% Sm@TiO2/P25. It is found that the addition of Sm can make the surface more flat and promote light absorption.31 The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) maps of P25 and Sm@TiO2/P25, as shown in Fig. 3, indicate that C, N, Sm, P, W, K and Na are present. The above results show that Sm is loaded on the photoanode and evenly distributed on the photoanode. The EDS spectrum of Sm@TiO2/P25 is shown in Fig. S4.†

XPS is used to evaluate the surface compositions and chemical environments of P, W, Ti and Sm in the 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 composite. The binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 in P25 are 458.06 eV and 461.20 eV, respectively (Fig. 4a), while the binding energies of the 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 composite Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 are 457.92 eV and 463.62 eV, respectively (Fig. 4b). The corresponding peaks of W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of Sm are 35.14 eV and 37.22 eV, (Fig. 4c), while the W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 of 5%Sm@TiO2 /P25 are 36.57 eV and 38.07 eV (Fig. 4d). The binding energy of the P–W bond in Sm is 129.78 eV (Fig. 5a), while that of 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 is 134.06 eV (Fig. 5b). The SmIII 3d5/2 and SmIII 3d3/2 peaks of Sm are 1067.35 eV and 1105.07 eV (Fig. 5c), respectively. The SmIII 3d5/2 and SmIII 3d3/2 peaks of 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 are 1082 eV and 1108 eV (Fig. 5d). In conclusion, the binding energies of P, W, Ti and Sm in the 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 composite changed compared with TiO2, which indicates that Sm interacts with TiO2. The XPS results show that Sm is successfully loaded on TiO2 and the electron transfer present between Sm and TiO2 accelerates the receiving speed of electrons and inhibits electron–hole recombination.32,33

We further use X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to examine changes in the phase structure and content of the TiO2 once combined with Sm. In Fig. 6a, after calcination, the peaks of pure TiO2 and 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 observed at 25.3°, 37.89°, 48.0°, 54.39° and 62.7° nearly overlap. The positions of these characteristic peaks are consistent with those of anatase TiO2.34 From Fig. 6a, we can see that the peak position of TiO2 does not change after doping with Sm, indicating that the crystal structure and active phase do not transform and the addition of Sm can ensure the stability of anatase TiO2. The decrease in peak intensity may be due to the increase of grain size and the reduction of TiO2 content.

The UV–visible absorption spectra of P25, Sm and 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 are shown in Fig. 6b. P25 has strong absorption in the ultraviolet region. The compound Sm has weak absorption in the visible light region. The UV absorption of 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 is significantly stronger than that of P25, indicating that the absorbance of the P25 has been improved in the original range after the addition of Sm.35 PL spectroscopy is used to study the trap states.36 Compared with pure P25, the fluorescence intensity of 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 is significantly enhanced (Fig. 6c). The increase of fluorescence intensity indicates that the incorporation of Sm reduces the defect states and promotes the scattering and absorption of light. The schematic diagram of electron transfer between TiO2 and Sm is shown in Fig. 6d. The LUMO energy level of Sm is slightly lower than the CB energy level of TiO2, so a potential barrier can form between them, which promotes the electron transfer from the CB of TiO2 to the LUMO of Sm. The existence of Sm accelerates the movement of electrons in the photoanode, avoids the possibility of electron recombination, and prolongs the electron lifetime.37–39
During charge transfer, there are several processes.40–43 First, the dye is excited by light and transfers an electron from the ground state to the excited state. The excited state dye molecules inject electrons into the CB of the semiconductor TiO2. Electrons transfer from the CB of TiO2 to the LUMO level of Sm, then pass through the nanocrystals and transfer to the external circuit. Finally, the electrons of the counter electrode (CE) combine with the I3− ions in the electrolyte and generate I− ions, the electrons enter into the electrolyte, then the reduced dye combines with the I− ions in the electrolyte to regenerate the dye. Because the transmission of electrons in the film is impacted by the electron concentration gradient and the transmission of electrons in the nanoparticles is disordered and non-directional, the electrons can easily recombine with the I3− ions in the electrolyte solution at the interface of TiO2, which results in a large loss of current. There are mainly two kinds of electron recombination. In one instance, the electrons on the nanocrystalline surface recombine with the I3− ions in the electrolyte; the other is that the electrons in the CB of the semiconductor recombine with the oxidized state dye.44 The working principle diagram of DSSCs is shown in Fig. 7.

A local electric field can be formed by spontaneous polarization of the ferroelectric materials with non-centrosymmetric crystal structures near the Curie temperature. Moreover, the electrostatic shielding effect on the surface of the dipoles in the electric field is negligible, so the application of Sm in the photoanode can effectively separate the photogenerated electrons and holes, reduce the contact opportunities of the electrons with dyes and electrolytes, inhibit the recombination of the electron–hole pairs and extend the electron lifetime. At the same time, the energy level of Sm is matches well with the semiconductor TiO2, so Sm can be used as the electron acceptor to accelerate electron transfer.
We further investigate the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with different contents of Sm in the electrodes (Table 1). The performance of DSSCs with different contents of Sm@TiO2/P25 is shown in Fig. S5–S10.† The best efficiency can be obtained with 5% Sm doping. The performance of the Sm-doped photoanode increases as the content of Sm increases; however, when the mass concentration of Sm exceeds 5%, the performance of the cells begins to decrease. It is possible that when the concentration of the ferroelectric material is too high, the electric field generated by the dipoles is non-directional, resulting in the weakening of the electron–hole separation effect. Electrons are lost during transport, which leads to the reduction of photovoltaic efficiency. At the same time, the increase in the concentration of polyoxo-metalates may cause aggregation, which is also the reason for the decrease of efficiency. When the content of ferroelectric Sm is 5%, the highest efficiency of the DSSC is 6.82%. The PCE increased by 21.8% compared with the DSSC composed of pure P25 (5.62%). The increase of Jsc can be attributed to the spontaneous polarization effect of ferroelectric Sm. In this case, the recombination of electron–hole pairs at the electrolyte/dye/titanium dioxide interface is inhibited, resulting in a large photocurrent density. Fig. 8a shows the current density voltage curve of DSSCs based on P25 and 5%Sm@TiO2/P25.45–47

The effect of the polarized electric field and the charge transport characteristics of DSSCs are studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).48–51 Fig. S11† shows the equivalent circuit used to fit the impedance measurements on the DSSCs. Nyquist plots have three semicircles. The first semicircle represents the charge-transfer resistance at the interface of the electrode/electrolyte (R1); the second semicircle represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface at about 101 Hz and the charge-transfer resistance (Rt) in the TiO2 film at 103–102 Hz. The semicircle of the third low frequency band represents the diffusion impedance (R3) of ions in electrolyte solution. Rt represents the effectiveness of electron movement in the TiO2 conduction band. In the open circuit state, the carrier density is high, so the diffusion resistance is often too low to detect. Therefore, the second semicircle mainly represents the charge transfer resistance Rct.52,53
The large Rct indicates that the electron–hole pairs at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface will not easily recombine.54–57Fig. 8b shows that the Rct of 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 is larger than that of pure TiO2, indicating that the electron–hole recombination of the electrode doped with Sm has been inhibited and the electrons also have a longer lifetime. In the Bode phase diagram, the frequencies located at 11.9 Hz and 18.5 Hz correspond to 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 and pure P25-based DSSCs, respectively (Fig. 8c). The electron lifetime can be calculated by the formula τe = (2πfmax)−1 from the spectrum curve (fmax is the frequency corresponding to the top of the arc).58,59 It is calculated that the electron lifetime of 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 is 13.4 ms, while that of TiO2 is 8.6 ms. The electron lifetime increased by 42.9% after doping with Sm. Obviously, the increases of Rct and τ indicate that the addition of Sm can promote effective electron transfer and inhibit electron recombination.
Open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) technology can not only monitor the decay rate of Voc after the light is suddenly turned off, but also indicate the recombination of electron–hole pairs under dark conditions.60 As shown in Fig. 8d, the Voc of 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 decays more slowly than that of TiO2, indicating that the presence of Sm slows down or reduces the electron recombination and extends the electron lifetime. The inhibition of electron recombination may be due to the existence of a polarized electric field and the electron acceptability of Sm. We further tested the photovoltaic stability of the 5%Sm@TiO2/P25-based DSSC on different days of one week. The test results show that the 5%Sm@TiO2/P25-based DSSC maintains good battery performance after one week (Fig. S12†).

Fig. 9a shows the photocurrent responses under AM1.5 illumination. It can be seen that the photocurrent of the DSSC is almost unchanged over a certain period of time, which proves that the DSSC has good stability. The photocurrent response of incident light is measured using the monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE).61,62 The photoelectric conversion efficiency of the 5%Sm@TiO2/P25-based DSSC is about 53%, while that of the pure TiO2-based DSSC is only 32% (Fig. 9b). This shows that Sm can promote electron transfer and improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency. In order to explore the influence of dye-loading on the improvement of cell performance, we carried out a dye-loading test (Fig. S13 and Table S1†). The results show that the dye adsorption amount of different concentrations of Sm@TiO2/P25 films are slightly reduced compared with the pure TiO2 film, which is probably because the introduction of Sm increases the grain size of TiO2, resulting in a reduction in the specific surface area of the photoanode film. This further suggests that the reason for the improved performance of Sm@TiO2/P25-based DSSCs is that Sm can promote the electron transfer and inhibit electron–hole recombination.

Conclusions
In summary, ferroelectric polyoxometalate Sm is successfully used in a DSSC photoanode for the first time. XRD, SEM and other methods were used to characterize the composition and morphology of the film, proving that Sm was successfully loaded on the semiconductor TiO2. The photovoltaic device performance of the DSSC was studied by current voltage output characteristics (J–V), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and other electrochemical tests. The experimental results show that the highest energy conversion efficiency of the DSSC reached 6.82% when the Sm concentration is 5 wt%. Furthermore, we confirmed that ferroelectric polyoxometalate Sm can promote electron transfer in the photoanode film. The introduction of Sm can inhibit electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and extend the electron lifetime due to its spontaneous polarization effect. This report provides a new way to further develop ferroelectric polyoxometalates and establishes a new approach to improving the performance of DSSCs. The method is also applicable to other photovoltaic devices.
Experimental
Preparation of the 5%Sm@TiO2/P25 photoelectrode
Compound Sm was synthesized according to the literature.26
3 g ethyl cellulose was dissolved in 20 mL ethanol and then stirred until it was dissolved completely. 30 mg Sm and 0.57 g P25 were transferred into a mortar with 0.1 mL acetic acid and ground for 5 min. Then, 0.1 mL deionized water was added, ground, and repeated 5 times, then 15 times with 0.1 mL ethanol and six times for 0.25 mL ethanol, for one minute each time. The Sm@TiO2/P25 paste was transferred to a beaker using ethanol to remove the paste in the mortar. The beaker was placed on a magnetic stirrer and stirred for 1 min, then ultrasonicated for 1 min. Under the stirring condition, 2.24 mL terpineol was slowly added drop-wise into the beaker and the above stirring and ultrasonic treatments were repeated. The prepared ethyl cellulose solution was added to the beaker, and the stirring and ultrasonic treatment was repeated once. Next, the mixed liquid was heated and stirred at 80 °C to evaporate the ethanol. When the suspension in the beaker was about 5 mL and gelatinous, the beaker was removed from heat and quickly sealed with a plastic film. Screen printing was used to make the Sm@TiO2/P25 gel coat on the processed FTO glass, which was cleaned in the ultrasonic cleaner with cleaning agent, isopropanol and ethanol in turn, then the FTO glass was placed on a 120 °C heating plate for 5 min to dry the film and repeated four times. It was calcined in a muffle furnace at the set temperature (325 °C for 5 min at a rate of 5 °C· min−1, then 375 °C for 5 min at a heating rate of 5 °C· min−1, and 450 °C for 30 min at a heating rate of 7.5 °C min−1). The FTO was immersed in the TiCl4 solution (1.147 mL TiCl4 was dissolved with 250 mL deionized water in an ice bath) and heated at 70 °C for 30 minutes. The FTO was calcined in a muffle furnace with the same temperature gradient as before.63
The fabrication of DSSCs
When the temperature of the muffle furnace dropped to 80 °C, the prepared photoelectrode was removed and put into 20 mL N719 ethanol solution (5 mg N719 dissolved in 20 mL ethanol solution for 12 h at room temperature), soaked for 24 h, then washed with pure ethanol solution to remove excess dye, and dried under nitrogen air flow. The photoelectric electrode and platinum electrode were assembled and injected with electrolyte solution (a mixture of lithium iodide 0.1 M, iodine 0.05 M, 1,2-dimethyl-3-propyl-imidazole iodide 0.6 M and 4-tert-butylpyridine 0.5 M in 5 mL 3-methoxypropionitrile).
