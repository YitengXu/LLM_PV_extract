    , Accepted 23rd September 2016First published on 27th September 2016AbstractNovel Er3+-doped transparent NaYb2F7 glass-ceramics (GCs) were successfully fabricated for the first time by a conventional melt-quenching technique with subsequent heat treatment. The formation of NaYb2F7 nanocrystals (NCs) was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), and photoluminescence emission spectra. Moreover, the appearance of Stark level splitting of Er3+ emission bands and the variation of the decay curves demonstrate the accumulation of active centers into the NaYb2F7 NCs lattice. Hence, the photoluminescence emission intensities of Er3+ doped GC680 are greatly enhanced relative to those in precursor glass. Furthermore, the temperature dependent fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of thermally coupled emitting states (4S3/2, 2H11/2) in Er3+ doped GCs was studied under 980 nm laser excitation with a very low power density of 13 mW mm−2 to avoid the possible laser induced heating. A high temperature sensitivity of FIR of 1.36% K−1 is obtained at 300 K and the corresponding effective energy difference (ΔE) is 852 cm−1. Besides, laser induced heating at several excitation power densities was measured to evaluate the laser induced heating effect and the accuracy of temperature sensing for our sample. The GCs with relatively high sensitivity under low excitation power density are promising for temperature sensing. Moreover, the study on down-conversion (DC) spectra of the GC samples shows their ability to convert a high energy photon into two low energy photons, implying that they may also have important application as DC materials.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, optical materials doped with lanthanide ions have been drawing tremendous attention due to their potential application in all-solid compact lasers, thermal imaging, photovoltaic solar cells, color displays, cancer treatment, temperature sensors as well as optical heaters.1–13 One of the especially interesting applications is as non-contact temperature sensors which are regarded as a promising tool for temperature detection because of their noninvasive operation mode, excellent accuracy, high spatial resolution, and fast response.14,15 Of the various optical temperature sensors, those using the FIR technique exploiting the temperature-dependent emission intensities of two thermally coupled energy levels (TCELs) of rare-earth (RE) ions have immediate advantage of immunity to spectral loss and excitation source fluctuation, leading to high accuracy and resolution. Additionally, to avoid strong overlapping of two fluorescence wavelengths and allow the upper level of optically active ions to have a sufficient population for the temperature range of interest, the separation between the TCELs should usually be larger than 200 cm−1 and less than 2000 cm−1.16,17 Some trivalent RE ions own a couple of adjacent levels with a small energy gap (ΔE) in the range of 200–2000 cm−1, such as Er3+ (2H11/2 and 4S3/2), Tm3+ (3F2,3 and 3H4, 1G4(a) and 1G4(b)), Ho3+ (5F1/5G6, 3F2,3/3K8), Nd3+ (4F5/2, 4F3/2 and 4F7/2), Dy3+ (4I15/2 and 4F9/2), Eu3+ (5D1 and 5D0), and so on.15,18–24 Among the different RE ions capable of temperature sensing, Er3+ is the most desirable one, due to its two very intense green emission bands originating from the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 TCELs and applicable energy differences (ΔE, ∼700 cm−1).25
In order to find materials with excellent temperature sensing properties, RE ion doped diverse luminescence materials were characterized as optical temperature sensors, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), fluoride nanocrystals, ceramics and glass.18,26–28 Among these different material systems, the temperature sensing ability varies notably. MOFs might have some advantages such as the possibility of tuning their sensitivity more systematically and compatibility with biological systems, but their insufficient stability at relatively high temperature restricts their operating temperature to the physiological temperature range. Fluorides with low phonon energy provide efficient UC luminescence, which favors the accuracy of spectrum measurement and sensitivity. However, their poor stability at high temperature probably leads to phase transformation, which will affect the repeatability in heating–cooling cycles. Transparent ceramics still have lots of challenges including complicated synthesis procedures and high cost of preparation. For glass, it is difficult to produce the desired luminescence intensity in silica or in the alumino-silicate glass matrix due to their high phonon energy and abundant defects acting as quenching centers, hindering their performance for temperature sensing. Hence, to improve the properties of optical thermometers, the search for novel Er3+ ion doped UC materials with good stability, efficient luminescence and improved sensitivity is still on the way.
Fortunately, RE ion doped oxyfluoride GCs (OXFGCs) make highly efficient UC luminescence possible, owing to the low phonon energy of fluoride, available valence state and ionic radius suitable for RE ion doping.29,30 Combining the low phonon energy of fluoride NCs and high chemical durability and thermal stability of oxide glasses, OXFGCs exhibit promising potential for application in the field of optical fiber temperature sensing.31–33 OXFGCs are prepared with specially designed compositions through controlled crystallization of the embedded fluorides in the oxide glass at suitable temperature. In order to achieve highly efficient UC luminescence in OXFGCs, homogeneous precipitation of the desired fluoride NCs and partition of the optical activators into the fluoride lattice are necessary. Moreover, the transparency of GCs also needs consideration, which can be achieved when the size of dispersed NCs in GCs is smaller than the light wavelength so as to avoid scattering.34–37
Yb3+ ions often act as sensitizers in the UC process due to their wide absorption cross section of around 980 nm and efficient ET to other RE ions.38–40 Therefore, increasing attention has been paid to the UC properties of Yb-based fluoride NCs such as KYb2F7, LiYbF4, NaYbF4 and BaYbF5, and all the results show that these materials are excellent hosts for UC.41–45 Above all, Xiaogang Liu et al. reported that the RE ions are distributed in arrays of tetrad clusters in KYb2F7 nanocrystals of orthorhombic crystallographic structure, which enables the preservation of excitation energy within the sublattice domain and so effectively minimizes the migration of excitation energy to defects, even in stoichiometric compounds with high Yb3+ content. There is another substance, namely monoclinic NaYb2F7, which is chemically similar to, but differs in crystal structure from, KYb2F7, which has been scarcely studied as the luminescent host. Here, we managed to fabricate successfully Er3+-doped OXFGCs containing NaYb2F7 and studied in detail their upconversion properties, and examined them for optical thermometry at low-power laser excitation to reduce the heating effect of Yb3+ under the 980 nm excitation. We also studied the heating effect at elevated excitation laser power and analysed the increase in temperature via optical thermometry. This has great potential in photothermal therapy in which cancerous cells could be ablated by the heat transferred from incident energy.8,46–48 Furthermore, the quantum yield for DC luminescence has been found to be strong for the fluoride hosts due the low phonon energy of fluoride, which can reduce nonradiative relaxation at high Yb3+ concentration. Thus, we also investigated the DC processes of Na2Yb2F7-based GCs.
2. Experiments
2.1 Sample preparation
The samples were prepared by a melt-quenching method with the following nominal composition: 50SiO2–10Na2CO3–15A12O3–3CaCO3–15NaF–7YbF3–0.2ErF3 (in mol%). The raw materials of SiO2, Na2CO3, Al2O3, CaCO3, NaF (A. R., all from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) and high purity YbF3, ErF3 (99.99%, from AnSheng Inorganic Materials Co., Ltd, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China) were completely mixed and crushed in an agate mortar. Then the well-ground stoichiometric chemicals were put into an alumina crucible and melted at 1500 °C for 1 h in air. After that, the melt was poured onto a 300 °C preheated stainless-steel plate and then pressed by another plate to get solid samples. After annealing at 450 °C for 10 h to release internal stresses, precursor glasses (labeled as PG) were formed. Subsequently, PG were heat-treated for 2 h at 650 °C and 680 °C to form transparent GCs, which were labeled as GC650 and GC680, respectively. All samples were polished optically for further characterization.
2.2 Characterization
The phase and the mean crystalline size of the samples were identified via XRD measurements (MAC Science co. Ltd Mxp18.AHF, Tokyo, Japan), with nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation in the range of 2θ = 10°–70°. The microstructure of the GCs was analyzed by HRTEM (Model JEM-2010; JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The absorption spectra were measured using a SOLID 3700 spectrometer (Shimadzu Ltd, Kyoto, Japan). The decay curve measurements were performed using a Tektronix TDS2024 digital storage oscilloscope (US Patents, Shanghai, China). The emission spectra of NaYb2F7:Er3+ were obtained using a Jobin-Yvon HRD-1 double monochromator equipped with a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier. The spot size of the 980 nm laser was about 2 mm × 5 mm. And the pump power was adjusted through neutral density filters. The temperature of the sample fixed on a copper post was controlled over the range of 300–773 K using a temperature controller (FOTEK MT48-V-E, Taibei) with a type-K thermocouple and a heating tube.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology
To investigate the structure and the purity of PG, GC650 and GC680, these samples were characterized by XRD measurements and the results are presented in Fig. 1(a). There are two broad diffuse humps without any sharp peaks in the curve of PG, indicating its amorphous structure. However, after heat treatment, some intense diffraction peaks are found to superimpose on the two broad diffuse humps. These intense diffraction peaks can be perfectly indexed to monoclinic NaYb2F7 phase (JCPDS No. 43-1126) and no other diffraction peaks from any impurity were found, indicating that pure NaYb2F7 GCs have been successfully fabricated. The mean crystalline size D of GC680 is estimated to be 25 nm according to the Scherrer formula:49 (1)where k = 0.89, λ (0.154056 nm) represents the wavelength of Cu Kα radiation, θ is the Bragg angle of the XRD peak, and β is the full-width at half-maximum of the diffraction peak.

Transmittance, an important property for GCs used as optical fiber sensors, was recorded between 240 and 1200 nm at room temperature. As depicted in Fig. 1(b), the GC680 remains highly transparent with a transmittance of approximately 72% to 79% in the wavelength range of 500 to 580 nm, indicating that the size of the NaYb2F7 NCs is much smaller than the wavelength of visible light and that the NaYb2F7 NCs are distributed uniformly in the glass matrix. A series of obvious absorption peaks located at 377 nm, 487 nm, 520 nm, and 651 nm were observed, corresponding to the transitions of Er3+ from the ground state 4I15/2 to 4G11/2, 4F7/2, 2H11/2 and 4F9/2, respectively. The broad absorption band at around 973 nm can be mainly ascribed to the transition from 2F7/2 to the 2F5/2 multiplet state of Yb3+ ions with a wide absorption cross section around 980 nm, apart from weak contributions from the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 transition of Er3+.50 It is noticeable that the transmittance of all the samples tends to decrease at short wavelengths. This effect is more prominent as the degree of crystallization increases. This phenomenon could be explained by Henry theory, in which the intensity of scattered light in GCs follows a λ−8R7 relationship, where λ is the wavelength of light and R is the average radius of NCs in GCs.51 So it can be deduced that the transmittance of GCs with larger crystal size decreases more promptly with wavelength. Interestingly, the cut-off wavelength of the GCs shows red shift compared to PG. This could be ascribed to the following two aspects: (1) the band gap of the residual glassy phase reduces when NaYb2F7 NCs precipitate, (2) after the precipitation of NaYb2F7 NCs in GCs, the optical scattering effect becomes prominent due to refractive index mismatch between NaYb2F7 NCs and the glass matrix.52

Fig. 1(c) and (d) shows the TEM and HRTEM images of GC680 to provide further details of the microstructure of the samples. The TEM bright-field image demonstrates that the well-formed NaYb2F7 NCs are homogeneously dispersed in the glass matrix and the diameters of the NCs are in the range of 10 to 35 nm, which are close to that estimated by the Scherrer formula. The HRTEM micrograph displays well-demarcated lattice fringes of GC680, and the value of the related interplanar spacing d is about 0.225nm, corresponding to the (109) lattice plane of the monoclinic phase (d109 = 0.2249 nm) of the NaYb2F7 lattice. The SAED patterns [Fig. 1(e)] of GC680 demonstrate the polycrystalline diffraction feature of the precipitated NCs. Furthermore, HAADF-STEM element mappings of GC680 are presented in Fig. 2(f). Na, Yb, and Er are found in the NCs of GC680; however, F presents equally in the NCs and the glass matrix. This is evidence for the participation of NaYb2F7 NCs and the successful incorporation of Er3+ into NaYb2F7 NCs. To summarize, the HRTEM, TEM, SAED, and HAADF-STEM element mapping images further confirm the formation of monoclinic NaYb2F7 GCs.

3.2 UC study under 980 nm excitation

3.2.1 UC luminescence property at RT. 

Fig. 2 plots the UC spectra in the range from 350 to 750 nm of PG, GC650 and GC680 samples at room temperature upon excitation of a 980 nm diode laser. It is clearly observed that the obtained UC luminescence spectrum of Er3+-doped NaYb2F7 GCs is composed of intense red and green emissions as well as relatively weak violet emission in the visible region. The peaks located at 655 nm, 538 nm, 522 nm and 407 nm are ascribed to 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. Notably, compared to the PG, the emissions of Er3+-doped NaYb2F7 GCs exhibit two sets of distinct Stark splittings: the 538 nm, 544 nm and 551 nm peaks evolved from the 550 nm band in PG spectra corresponding to the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition, and the 651 nm, 655 nm and 669 nm peaks emerged from the 655.3 nm band in PG spectra for the 4F9/2 to 4I15/2 transition. These clear Stark splittings give further evidence of the successful incorporation of Er3+ ions into the NaYb2F7 NCs after heat treatment. The inset is the UC spectra magnified 10 times in the range from 350 to 450 nm. In the ultraviolet range, there is another peak around 378 nm which is assigned to the 4G11/2 → 4I15/2 transition and rarely observed in the UC spectra. The integrated luminescence intensities of GC650 and GC680 are increased by 7 and 33 times, respectively, compared to those of PG. This dramatic enhancement can be attributed to the favorable environment of Er3+ ions in NCs for luminescence.


3.2.2 UC mechanism. 
In order to figure out the number n of absorbed photons required to produce an emission photon in the UC process, the double logarithmic curves of UC emission intensity (I) at 407 nm, 538 nm and 655 nm as a function of pump power (P) are plotted in Fig. 3(a). The UC emission intensity and the pump power comply with the relation I ∝ Pn.8 From Fig. 3, the fitted slopes (n) for log(I) − log(P) curves of 655 nm (red), 538 nm (green) and 407 nm (blue) are 1.57, 1.85 and 2.26, respectively, indicating that both two-photon and three-photon processes occur in the UC emission process. According to the above results, the possible UC processes are systematically sketched in Fig. 3(b) with the energy level diagrams of Er3+ and Yb3+; the relevant transitions are also displayed. Among the involved UC processes labeled in Fig. 3(b), ET, ground state absorption (GSA), excited state absorption (ESA) and cross-relaxation (CR), the primary process is the ET from 2F5/2 of Yb3+ to 4I11/2, 4F9/2, 4F7/2, 2H9/2 and 4G9/2 of Er3+ ions as a result of the much larger absorption cross section of Yb3+ than that of Er3+ around 980 nm. The short wavelength bands centered at 378 and 407 nm originate from 4G11/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively, via a three-photon UC process. 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states are populated through non-radiative relaxation from the 4F7/2 state of Er3+ ions, and then produce the two green emission bands centered at 522 and 538 nm by radiative transition to the ground multiplet state. Finally, the radiative relaxation from the 4F9/2 state leads to the 655 nm emission.

3.2.3 Lifetime measurements. 
The decay curves of luminescence in PG, GC650 and GC680 at 538 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and 655 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) are plotted in Fig. 4(a) and (b). The environment of glass is actually very complex due to the different raw materials used as ingredients. Here, for simplicity, we approximate the decay of the luminescence of Er3+ ions in PG with a single component. Hence, the decay of Er3+ in GC650 and GC680 can be described with two components, with the fast one being related to PG and the slow one to NaYb2F7 NCs. Higher temperature crystallization treatment is advantageous for improving the crystallinity and reducing the surface-to-volume of NaYb2F7 NCs where Er3+ ions reside, which leads to a large proportion of Er3+ being incorporated into NaYb2F7 NCs and avoids the influence of high energy vibrations of the alumino-silicate glass matrix. Therefore, the averaged lifetime of Er3+ in GC680 is much longer than that in GC650. The average decay lifetime () of luminescence is obtained by (2)where I(t) represents the emission intensity at time t.8 As displayed in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the average lifetimes of 4S3/2 are about 12, 13 and 73 μs for PG, GC650 and GC680, respectively and and those of 4F9/2 are about 71, 120 and 182 μs for PG, GC650 and GC680, respectively. The longer lifetimes of GC650 and GC680 samples than those of PG can be attributed to the reduced non-radiative relaxation rate of Er3+ in NaYb2F7 NCs with lower phonon energy. In summary, the distinct Stark splitting, dramatic enhancement of UC emission, and the increased lifetime all support the incorporation of Er3+ into NaYb2F7 NCs after crystallization.

3.2.4 UC luminescence for temperature sensing. 
In terms of the FIR based optical thermometry technique, it is important to select two appropriate thermal coupling levels (TCL) from RE ions and investigate how their UC luminescence intensity ratio varies with temperature. Since the energy gap between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels is relatively small (∼700 cm−1), the 2H11/2 level can be populated from the 4S3/2 level by thermal excitation to achieve thermal equilibrium, and the relative population follows the Boltzmann distribution, leading to variation in the FIR value of UC emission from 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions with the increase of temperature. To evaluate the possibility of thermometry application, the normalized green UC spectra of Er3+ doped GCs measured in the temperature range from 300 to 773 K excited by a 980 nm laser with a power density of 13 mW mm−2 are depicted in Fig. 5(a). It is obvious that the green UC emission intensity of the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transition increases remarkably with respect to that of the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition as the temperature increases. Meanwhile, it is noted that the center wavelengths of the green UC emission bands have not changed with temperature.

(b) FIR data as a function of absolute temperature for the GC680 sample. (c) Relative sensitivity SR and absolute sensitivity SA of GC680 in the temperature range of 300–773 K. 
The FIR of the emissions from 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, denoted as R, could be mathematically written as (3)where IH and IS are the intensities (the integrated areas below the emission curves) for the emissions from the upper (2H11/2) and lower (4S3/2) thermally coupled levels, respectively, kB is the Boltzmann constant, ΔE is the effective energy gap between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels, T is the absolute temperature and C is a temperature-independent constant.8

Fig. 5(b) illustrates the temperature dependence of R in the range of 300–773 K for GC680, and the experimental data can be well fitted with the following equation: R = 7.2 × exp(−1226.4/T)(4)The effective energy gap ΔE between 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels of Er3+ ions obtained from eqn (4) is 852 cm−1, which is slightly larger than that in other Er3+-doped systems.
The absolute temperature sensitivity SA and the relative temperature sensitivity SR are two important parameters, which are defined as the absolute and relative change of the R value with respect to temperature variation: (5) (6)The temperature dependence of the relative sensitivity SR and the absolute sensitivity SA of the GC680 sample deduced from eqn (4)–(6) is depicted in Fig. 5(c).8 The SR value derived from eqn (6) is 1226.4/T2, which is slightly larger than most of the values for Er3+ ions doped in other glasses and GCs as listed in Table 1.

Moreover, the SR value derived from eqn (6) is 1.36% K−1 at 300 K, which recommends Er3+ doped NaYb2F7 GCs for potential application as an optical temperature sensor in comparison with glass optical-fiber thermometers. Impressively, the data reproducibility of the potential temperature sensor is quite good after several repeating experiments, which is attributed to the protective role of the alumino-silicate glass matrix. In summary, it is expected that these transparent GCs containing NaYb2F7 NCs could be used in optical temperature sensing.
Further investigation was conducted to reveal the laser induced heating effect in NaYb2F7:Er GCs by the 980 nm excitation laser at different low power density: 13, 16.4, 21.35, and 25 mW mm−2. Fig. 6 displays the temperature difference (ΔT) of NaYb2F7:Er3+ GCs caused by the heating effect as a function of power density difference (ΔP) between different low power density (13, 16.4, 21.35, and 25 mW mm−2) and 13 mW mm−2 of the 980 nm laser at three different temperatures (330 K, 510 K, and 690 K). Moreover, the circumstance at the three different temperatures is stable.

The ΔT was calculated by the following equation (eqn (7)) which is deduced from eqn (6): (7)where ΔR is the difference between the R at the excitation power density of 13, 16.4, 21.35, 25 mW mm−2 and that at 13 mW mm−2, and SR is the relative temperature sensitivity.
Considering the error limits, the ΔT have been to some extent marked with an error bar in Fig. 6. The relationship between ΔT and ΔP can be fitted by a linear function. From the fitting slope, the laser induced temperature increment under an excitation power density of 13 mW mm−2 can be deduced to be about 2.6 K at 330 K and 510 K, but only about 0.1 K at 690 K, respectively. In order to reduce the impact of this heating effect for application in temperature sensing, there are two possible methods: (1) reducing the doping concentration of Yb3+, (2) reducing the power of the excitation laser but using a more sensitive detector. The fitting slope is barely changed in the temperature range of 330 K to 510 K, considering the scale of the error limits. However, it decreases a lot when the temperature reaches 690 K. This is probably due to the much larger specific heat capacity of the sample at 690 K. With some careful further verification, this phenomenon might be explored to monitor the local phase transition of samples.
The green UC emission spectra of Er3+-doped NaYb2F7 GC680 have been recorded in the 510–580 nm range upon 980 nm diode laser excitation with different pump power, as shown in Fig. 7. It is seen that the variation trend of the intensity of the two emission bands is not the same with increasing excitation power. This dissimilar behavior of emission intensities of the two bands suggests variation of their R with excitation power. The plots of the calculated R as a function of laser excitation power for Er3+-doped NaYb2F7 GC680 are displayed in Fig. 7 (inset). It is seen that the value of R increases from 0.16 to 0.45 upon increasing the pump power from 156 mW to 906 mW. As we discussed earlier, the variation in R of two thermal coupling energy levels of RE ions is due to the change in their populations. And the energy difference between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states is ∼800 cm−1, and the populations follow Boltzmann's distribution. Using the R gained at different excitation power, we can interpolate the temperature of the sample at different pump power. The calculated temperature is also depicted as a function of pump power in the inset of Fig. 7, in which the lattice temperature varies from 322 K to 446 K with the increase of pump power from 156 mW to 906 mW.

3.3 Spectral conversion as DC material
In order to gain more information on this novel GC for possible application as a DC material, we study the DC properties of Er3+-doped NaYb2F7 GCs. Fig. 8(a) and (b) present the excitation spectra of Er3+ by monitoring 538 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and 655 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) emissions in GC680. In Fig. 8(a), there are seven excitation bands located at 355 nm, 364 nm, 377 nm, 405 nm, 440 nm, 448 nm and 487 nm, suggesting direct optical excitation of 4f energy levels of Er3+. Tentatively, we attribute these peaks to the following intra-4f Er3+ transitions: 4I15/2 → (2G7/2, 2K15/2), 4I15/2 → 4G9/2, 4I15/2 → 4G11/2, 4I15/2 → 2H9/2, 4I15/2 → 4F3/2, 4I15/2 → 4F5/2 and 4I15/2 → 4F7/2, respectively. The strongest excitation peak is determined to be 487 nm in Fig. 8(a). There are four excitation peaks in Fig. 8(b) situated at 355 nm, 364 nm, 377 nm and 405 nm which are attributed to 4I15/2 → (2G7/2, 2K15/2), 4I15/2 → 2G9/2, 4I15/2 → 4G11/2, and 4I15/2 → 2H9/2 of Er3+, respectively. Interestingly, the excitation bands between 350 nm and 425 nm in Fig. 8(b) are in accordance with that in Fig. 8(a); however, the excitation bands in the range of 425–500 nm observed in Fig. 8(a) disappear in Fig. 8(b).
 Fig. 8  Excitation spectra by monitoring the 4S3/2 emission of Er3+ at 538 nm (a) and the 4F7/2 emission of Er3+ at 655 nm (b) in the GC680 sample. 
The emission spectra of the GC680 sample measured under 487 nm and 355 nm excitation are given in Fig. 9(a) and (b). Under the excitation of 487 nm, the strongest emission peak is located at 538 nm (green), and the emission intensities are greatly enhanced after crystallization. On the other hand, the emission at 655 nm (red) is the strongest under the excitation of 355 nm. From Fig. 9(a) and (b), the integrated intensity ratio (Igreen/Ired) in the emission spectra of Er3+ decreases from 20 for 487 nm excitation to 0.1 for 355 nm excitation, indicating different relaxation mechanisms under the excitation of 487 nm and 355 nm.
 Fig. 9  Emission spectra under 487 nm (a) and 355 nm (b) excitation for the GC680 sample, respectively. (c) Decay curves for 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (655 nm) emissions of Er3+ with the excitation of 355 nm and 487 nm in GC680. (d) Energy-level diagram of Er3+ with 355 nm and 487 nm excitation and the possible transition mechanism. 
To illustrate this phenomenon, apart from the emission spectra, the decay curves are very helpful in distinguishing different relaxation processes. Thus, the decay curves of Er3+-doped NaYb2F7 GC680 were measured at 655 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) under 487 nm and 355 nm excitation, as shown in Fig. 9(c). The figure clearly shows that 4F9/2 luminescence reaches maximum intensity immediately under the excitation of 355 nm but increases before reaching maximum intensity under the excitation of 487 nm. This result indicates that the initial state of the transition 4F9/2 is populated by the depopulation of other levels with higher energy. Moreover, the decay lifetimes of the 4F9/2 emission of Er3+ under 487 nm and 355 nm excitation are 0.18 ms and 0.17 ms, respectively.
The above results on photoluminescence spectra and decay curves show that there exist different transition mechanisms under 487 nm and 355 nm excitation. Under the excitation of the 487 nm laser, the ground state 4I15/2 was excited to the higher excited state 4F7/2 by a ground state absorption (GSA) process: Er3+ (4I15/2) + hν → Er3+ (4F7/2); then multi-phonon non-radiative relaxation from 4F7/2 to the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 level takes place as depicted in Fig. 9(d). On the other hand, under the excitation of higher energy photons with the wavelength of 355, 364, 377 and 405 nm, Er3+ ions will be excited to a higher excited state above 2H9/2, whose subsequent multi-phonon non-radiative relaxation to the energy state below 2H9/2 is inefficient due to the large energy gap below 2H9/2 and the low phonon energy of this host matrix, and so the population of 4F9/2 and 4S3/2 will be very small. Another way to populate 4F9/2 is via the two cross-relaxation processes: Er3+ (4G11/2) + Yb3+ (2F7/2) → Er3+ (4F9/2) + Yb3+ (2F5/2) and Er3+ (2H9/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Er3+ (4F9/2) + Yb3+ (2F5/2), which greatly enhance the population of 4F9/2 resulting in a remarkable decrease of the integrated intensity ratio (Igreen/Ired).53 According to the excitation spectra shown in Fig. 8(b), the excitation band centered at 405 nm is much weaker than that located at 355, 364 and 377 nm. It can be deduced that the former process is more efficient, because the energy difference between 4G11/2 and 4F9/2 of Er3+ matches better with that between 2F7/2 and 2F5/2 of Yb3+. Thus, the dominant wavelength in the emission spectrum is 655 nm for GC680 when the energy of excitation wavelength exceeds the energy of 2H9/2 (∼24505 cm−1), and vice versa. These two cross-relaxation processes we reported in our samples may have important application in DC materials due to their ability to convert a high energy photon to two low energy photons. For example, the cross-relaxation process Er3+ (4G11/2) + Yb3+ (2F7/2) → Er3+ (4F9/2) + Yb3+ (2F5/2) could convert a 377 nm photon absorbed by Er3+ into a 655 nm photon emitted by Er3+ and a 980 nm photon emitted by Yb3+, which may have potential application in improving the energy conversion efficiency of Si solar cells.54–56
4. Conclusions
Novel transparent GCs containing NaYb2F7 NCs were successfully synthesized for the first time. The formation of NaYb2F7 NCs and their homogeneous dispersion were confirmed by XRD, TEM, HRTEM, SAED, and photoluminescence measurements. The average size of the homogeneous NaYb2F7 NCs was estimated to be 25 nm from XRD and HRTEM results. The GC samples showed intense luminescence under ultraviolet and near-infrared irradiation, and the emissions centered at 655 nm (4F9/2 → 4I15/2), 538 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2), 522 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 407 nm (2H9/2 → 4I15/2) in GCs are highly enhanced, compared to those in PG. The UC mechanisms and possible UC processes were proposed, in which ET plays a dominant role. The FIR of the two green UC emission bands centered at 522 and 538 nm, originating from the transitions from two thermal coupling energy levels 2H11/2/4S3/2 to 4I15/2, was recorded for optical thermometry in the temperature range of 300 to 773 K. The sensitivity for Er3+ doped NaYb2F7 GCs reaches 1.36% K−1 at 300 K, corresponding to an effective ΔE of 852 cm−1. Moreover, a laser induced thermal effect was also investigated and the sample temperature varied from 322 to 446 K with increasing pump power from 156 mW to 906 mW. The enhanced emissions, good temperature sensitivity and the advantage of low phonon energy of fluoride NCs all suggest that Er3+ doped NaYb2F7 GCs are ideal candidates for optical temperature sensing.
