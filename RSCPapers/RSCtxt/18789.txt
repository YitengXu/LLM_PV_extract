    , Accepted 17th September 2018First published on 18th September 2018AbstractSemi-transparent perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) are realized by tuning the band gap of the perovskite to resolve the trade-off between the transparency and efficiency of the photo-absorber. We synthesized wide-bandgap MAPbI3−xBrx perovskite, and the transparency and efficiency of the corresponding semi-transparent Pero-SCs were investigated systematically by varying the I:Br ratio and thickness of the perovskite film. Increasing Br content widened the bandgap of perovskite (i.e., blue shift of the absorption edge), and led to an increase in the average visible transmittance (AVT). This strategy allowed for high AVTs, and concomitantly achieved high power conversion efficiencies. Meanwhile, increasing the Br content could facilitate formation of perovskite films with large grains that were highly crystallized. Compared with the narrow-bandgap perovskite, the wide-bandgap perovskite showed advantages for obtaining semi-transparent Pero-SCs with thick perovskite films (>200 nm) and high (20%) transparency.
Introduction
Modern buildings, automobiles, and wearable electronics need glass walls to possess dual functions, acquiring visible transparency and harnessing solar energy. These functions make transparent or semi-transparent solar cells important research directions.1 Obtaining high transparency and efficiency at the same time has been proven to be challenging because of the trade-off between transparency and efficiency for absorbing the sunlight to generate electricity. Perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) are rising stars in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE), manufacturing cost and flexibility.2–6 As a consequence, recent studies with regard to semi-transparent solar cells have focused on perovskite materials that have excellent semi-conducting properties and lead to highly efficient Pero-SCs.
To date, many studies have been devoted to exploring transparent electrode materials for Pero-SCs, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate,7,8 thin Au/Ag top electrodes,9–11 silver nanowires,12–15 transparent conducting oxide-based top electrodes (indium tin oxide,16–18 hydrogen-doped indium oxide,19,20 indium zinc oxide,21 aluminum-doped zinc oxide22), carbon nanotubes23,24 and graphene single layers.25 However, one feasible method to increase transparency is through deliberately reducing the thickness of the perovskite film (∼100 nm).26,27 This approach brings two drawbacks: (1) decrease of device performance in terms of reduced open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc) due to the extremely thin perovskite film; (2) difficulties in thin-film fabrication during industrial production.25,28 Another strategy for achieving high transparency relies on uniform microstructure within the perovskite film, such as fabricating the island-shaped perovskite,29–31 or inserting a passivating materials to confine the growth of perovskite grains.32–36 Eperon et al. reported on semi-transparent island-shaped MAPbI3−xClx Pero-SCs with neutral color.29 Through introduction of a polystyrene passivation interlayer, Heo et al.32 constructed sandwich-type MAPbI3 to obtain semi-transparent Pero-SCs with high efficiency. Modification of morphology and structure can, to some extent, increase transparency, but thickness is kept relatively low to realize high transparency.
Manipulation of a component is a feasible way to adjust the bandgap, as well as light absorption. Wide bandgap MAPbI3−xBrx (0 < x ≤ 3) perovskite materials have been demonstrated to be good candidates for semi-transparent solar cells16,37,38 due to their continuously tunable bandgap from 1.6 to 2.3 eV.39 In addition, dual halide perovskites have shown improved stability against heat and moisture.39,40 The variation in absorption definitely affects the PCE. In the present study, the composition and thickness of MAPbI3−xBrx films were varied systematically, and the performance of the Pero-SCs, with a configuration of ITO/C60/Perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Au/MoO3, was studied systematically. Results indicated that increasing the Br content in MAPbI3−xBrx resulted in a widened bandgap of perovskite and increased the average visible transmittance (AVT), along with grain size and crystallinity. By regulating the Br content and thickness of the MAPbI3−xBrx film systematically, we maintained acceptable AVTs, and concomitantly achieved relatively high PCEs, even with perovskite films >200 nm.
Results and discussion
1. Optical properties of MAPbI3−xBrx films (x = 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5)
Thin films of MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5) perovskite were synthesized by fast crystallization deposition (FCD)41 using diethyl ether to fast-extract DMF in perovskite film after a delay time of 5 s. The absorption edge of the MAPbI3 thin film was located at ∼780 nm (Fig. 1a). Increasing the Br content led to two effects: blue shift of the absorption edge and decrease of the absorption coefficient over the entire visible wavelength range. At x = 1.5, the absorption edge was shifted to ∼650 nm, in agreement with previous reports.39 The observed blue shift indicated that the perovskite film possessed a wider bandgap and had greater transparency, thereby allowing more light to penetrate the film. To define the transparency quantitatively, the AVT was defined as integration of the area under the transmittance curve between 370 nm and 740 nm.29,42 The AVTs of perovskite films were investigated systematically by varying the Br content and thickness. Transmittance spectra are presented in Fig. S1 in ESI,† and the corresponding AVT values are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, a polygonal line separated the data into two groups, of which one group possessed AVTs > 20%. For perovskite films of identical thickness, high Br content led to high AVT. For example, if the film thickness was 300 nm, the AVT increased in sequence of 10%, 13%, 16% and 24% as x was 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5, respectively. These results indicated that perovskite films with high Br content were more suitable for fabricating semi-transparent Pero-SCs with relatively thick perovskite films.

In addition to transparency, the color of perovskite films was also a key factor for fabrication of semi-transparent Pero-SCs. To quantify the characteristics of light after penetrating different-thickness MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5) perovskite films, we calculated color-perception indices on the CIE 1931 xy color space.43 The transmitted light was represented by the product of the simulated Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) solar spectrum. Average values were analysed at four positions on different perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 1b, the color coordinate of transmitted light was close to the AM 1.5 G spectrum in the white-light region of the chromaticity diagram. For perovskite films with an identical composition of Br and I, increasing the thickness led to a right-shift of CIE coordinates relative to the AM 1.5 G spectrum.
2. Opaque Pero-SCs based on MAPbI3−xBrx films
Pero-SCs with a configuration of ITO/C60 (∼15 nm)/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD (∼120 nm)/Ag (∼100 nm) were fabricated. A thin layer of C60 was inserted between ITO and perovskite as an electron-transfer layer to facilitate charge separation and transport.44,45 In a series of solar cells, the composition and thickness of MAPbI3−xBrx were varied to investigate the performance of Pero-SCs. Typical J–V and EQE curves are shown in Fig. S2 in ESI,† and all the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S1 in ESI.† Notably, increasing the Br content in MAPbI3−xBrx led to improved Voc of the devices, which is consistent with the widened bandgap of the perovskite. The selected parameters of AVT and PCE are presented in Table 1. For Pero-SCs of identical thickness of MAPbI3−xBrx, the PCE decreased with increasing Br content. For the same component of perovskite, the PCE increased with increasing thickness of perovskite films. The highest PCE (17.53%) was obtained when the thickness of the MAPbI3 film was 300 nm. The highest AVT (41%) was achieved when the thickness of MAPbI1.5Br1.5 was 150 nm. Apart for these two extreme conditions, the AVT and PCE were compromised mutually upon varying the thickness and composition of MAPbI3−xBrx. Notably, among the group of AVTs > 20%, above the polygonal line, the highest PCE achieved was 14.23% as the thickness of MAPbI2.5Br0.5 was 200 nm. This allowed fabrication of relatively thicker perovskite films with comparable AVTs owing to the widened bandgap and decreased absorption coefficient of the perovskite film with Br content. Interestingly, the smallest hysteresis also appeared at x = 0.5, where the performance was the best. The corresponding J–V curves obtained from forward and reverse scans are shown in Fig. S3 in ESI.†
Another advantage is that increasing the Br content improved the quality of the perovskite films, and hence influenced the photovoltaic performance. As shown in Fig. 2a–d, the lateral size of crystal grains increased with increasing Br content in fabricated MAPbI3−xBrx films. When x was varied as 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5, the average grain size was 100, 120, 180, and 240 nm, respectively. Size distribution analyses are presented in Fig. S4 in ESI.† The enlarged grain size could be explained by the different diffusivity of Br− and I−.46,47 These results indicated that the growth of perovskite crystals was driven mainly by the diffusion of ions to as-formed nuclei. According to the Stokes–Einstein equation,48 the diffusion coefficient is determined by eqn (1): (1)where κB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, η is the dynamic viscosity of the solution, and r is ionic radius. Smaller atoms correspond to high diffusivity. The ionic radius of Br− and I− is 1.96 and 2.20 Å, respectively. Therefore, the relatively smaller ionic radius of Br− facilitated the growth of perovskite crystals.47 Consequently, a larger grain size brings about a lower density of grain boundaries, which may improve charge transport and collection in the photoactive layer.49

The effect of Br content on crystallinity was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). To make a parallel comparison, the thickness of MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5) films as well as the preparation conditions were kept the same. As shown in Fig. 2e and f, upon varying the Br content in the perovskite, the intensity increased significantly, and the peak assigned to the (110) diffraction shifted to large angles. The peak shift could be ascribed to the transformation of the crystal structure from tetragonal to cubic phases.39,50 In addition, the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peak was plotted in Fig. S5 in ESI.† The FWHM of the (110) peak was reduced with increasing Br content. A smaller FWHM means larger grains as estimated by Scherrer's equation.51 These results were consistent with those shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which further confirmed that the grain size and crystallinity of perovskite films increased gradually with increasing Br content in MAPbI3−xBrx.
3. Semi-transparent Pero-SCs based on MAPbI3−xBrx films
With regard to semi-transparent Pero-SCs with MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5) as the photoactive layer, the composition and thickness of MAPbI3−xBrx were varied, and ultra-thin Au (10 nm) was used as the top electrode to replace the Ag opaque electrode (∼100 nm). Because 10 nm of Au has discrete surface morphology and poor conductivity, two layers of MoO3 were deposited under and above the Au electrode, which has been shown to elicit a smooth and continuous film in the literature.12,52 The higher transmittance and conductivity properties make it a good candidate for the transparent top electrode. Thus, the configuration of semi-transparent Pero-SCs was ITO/C60 (∼15 nm)/Perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD (∼120 nm)/MoO3 (∼5 nm)/Au (∼10 nm)/MoO3 (∼5 nm). The corresponding cross-sectional SEM image of semi-transparent Pero-SC is shown in Fig. 3a. As shown in Fig. 3b, ITO/C60 and MoO3/Au/MoO3 had good transparency in the visible-light region, which ensured a good AVT for the resultant semi-transparent Pero-SCs. The transmittance spectra of semi-transparent Pero-SCs are shown in Fig. S6 in ESI,† and the corresponding AVTs were calculated and listed in Table 2. Upon varying the composition of perovskite and the thickness, the AVT was tuned between 9% and 33%. For semi-transparent Pero-SCs with the same thickness as the photoactive layer, the transparency of the entire cell was improved greatly upon increasing the Br content in MAPbI3−xBrx films. A polygonal line also separated the data into two groups, where one group possessed AVTs > 20%. When the thickness of the perovskite layer reached 250 nm, the semi-transparent Pero-SCs with MAPbI1.5Br1.5 film showed an AVT of 21%. A photograph of semi-transparent Pero-SCs with different thicknesses of MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5) is shown in Fig. 3c. Pero-SCs with different thicknesses of MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5) are shown in Fig. 3c. The characters under the cells could be identified by the naked eye, indicating that the transparency was very good.

Typical J–V and EQE curves of semi-transparent Pero-SCs with different thicknesses of MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5) photoactive layers are shown in Fig. 4. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of semi-transparent Pero-SCs with different thicknesses of MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5) films are listed in Table S2 in ESI,† with PCEs listed in Table 2. The highest PCE of 14.15% was obtained when the thickness of the MAPbI3 film was 300 nm with an AVT of only 9%. The highest AVT (33%) was obtained when the thickness of MAPbI1.5Br1.5 was 150 nm with a PCE of 6.84%. As marked in Table 2, above the red line, the transparency of Pero-SCs was >20%, and PCEs were ∼10%. In particular, when the thickness of the MAPbI1.5Br1.5 film reached 250 nm, the AVT of semi-transparent Pero-SCs was >20%, indicating that wide-bandgap perovskite materials were more suitable for fabrication of superior semi-transparent Pero-SCs with a thick photoactive layer. Comparing the AVT of perovskite films fabricated under identical conditions revealed that all AVTs of semi-transparent Pero-SCs were decreased, which could be attributed to absorption at the C60/spiro-OMeTAD transfer layer and Au electrode. The integrated current density from EQE curves was in good accordance with Jsc obtained from J–V curves, indicating the reliability of the parameters obtained from J–V measurements. Photo-electron characterizations of semi-transparent Pero-SCs from Au to the ITO side were also measured under AM 1.5 G illumination. As shown in Table S3 in ESI,† the PCE was decreased, mainly because of a much lower Jsc.

Compared with the detailed parameters of opaque Pero-SCs, the Voc and FF of semi-transparent Pero-SCs showed little change. The corresponding PCEs of semi-transparent Pero-SCs were relatively smaller, which was mainly due to the decrease of the Jsc. As shown in Fig. 5a, EQE values of semi-transparent Pero-SCs in the wavelength range 500–750 nm were much lower than those of opaque Pero-SCs, due to the reduced absorption of reflected light from the ultra-thin top Au electrode.10 This explained the low Jsc of semi-transparent Pero-SCs.

To compare our results with data reported in the literature, we plotted the PCEs of semi-transparent Pero-SCs as a function of the corresponding AVTs (Fig. 5b). Only semi-transparent Pero-SCs with AVT calculated in the range 370–740 nm and the photoactive layers are summarized here. The PCEs achieved in the present study were higher than those with comparable transparency reported in the literature. Pero-SCs that realized semi-transparency with other strategies are also summarized in Table S4 in ESI,† including perovskite island films and thin films. The present study demonstrated that tuning bandgaps has advantages in realizing semi-transparency with thicker perovskite films and less critical fabrication conditions.
Conclusions
To adjust the transparency of Pero-SCs, dual halide perovskite MAPbI3−xBrx was fabricated, and used as a photo-absorber in solar cell devices. The performance of Pero-SCs was investigated systematically by varying the composition and thickness of MAPbI3−xBrx films. Br incorporation into perovskite led to a blue shift of the absorption edge and co-efficiency, thus decreasing absorption in the visible range, which allowed for a thicker photo-absorber layer in Pero-SCs with comparable transparency. Moreover, incorporation of the relatively small Br atom into perovskite improved the grain size and film quality. To realize semi-transparent Pero-SCs, a thin layer of C60 and Au were employed as an electron-transfer layer and top electrode, respectively. Although the transparency and efficiency were balanced, we realized >20% AVT and ∼10% PCE, even when the film thickness of wide-bandgap perovskite was >200 nm.
Outlook
Semi-transparent Pero-SCs are unique photovoltaic devices and have attracted a great deal of attention. Development of this area relies mainly on exploration of highly transparent and effective light-absorbing materials. Reducing the thickness of photoactive layers cannot completely solve the trade-off between transparency and efficiency. We believe that regulating the absorption range (or the energy cut-off) could be feasible. Our study should at least imply the correct research direction for achieving highly efficient semi-transparent SCs. One should focus on two points: (i) the large bandgap caused by Br doping may result in a big Voc loss, which restricts further improvement in the efficiency of semi-transparent Pero-SCs; (ii) the stability of I/Br mixed Pero-SCs under illumination due to element segregation.
Experimental section
Materials
MAI and MABr were synthesized according to the literature.53 PbI2 (anhydrous, 99.999%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. PbBr2 (anhydrous, 99.999%), Spiro-OMeTAD (99.5%), lithium bistrifluoromethane-sulfonimidate (LiTFSI, 99.95%) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology. Pristine C60 was obtained from Suzhou Dade Carbon Nanotechnology. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; anhydrous, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; anhydrous, 99.8%), chlorobenzene (CB; anhydrous, 99.8%) and acetonitrile (anhydrous, 99.9%) were acquired from J&K Technology. All other chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) films
To obtain different-thickness films, MAI, PbI2, MABr, and PbBr2 were mixed and dissolved in different volumes of DMF with DMSO as an additive (DMSO/Pb2+ = 1:1, n/n). The final perovskite precursor solutions were controlled with concentrations of 25, 30, 35 and 40 wt%, respectively. Precursor solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter after stirring for 6 h at room temperature. CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5) films were prepared according to the protocol of the FCD method for 25 s in a N2 glove box. Also, 700 μL of diethyl ether was dropped onto a spinning film after a delay of 5 s. The substrate with a perovskite film was annealed at 60 °C for 2 min, and then placed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 5 min to make the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5) thin films. All the above-ascribed operations were carried out in a glove box filled with N2.
Fabrication of devices
ITO glass substrates (CSG Holding) were cleaned sequentially by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol, twice for each liquid and 15 min each time, followed by ultraviolet-ozone treatment for 20 min. Pristine C60 was deposited on ITO glass by vacuum evaporation (pressure < 1 × 10−5 Pa) a deposition rate of 0.3 Å s−1. Thickness was controlled to ∼10 nm. Perovskite films of different thickness (150, 200, 250, and 300 nm) were deposited on the C60 layer. Thickness was controlled by the spin speed and concentration of the precursor. Also, 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 1 mL of CB, and mixed with 28.8 mL of tBP and 17.5 mL of Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1). Spiro-OMeTAD films were deposited by spin-coating at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Ag or MoO3/Au/MoO3 electrodes were eventually deposited by vacuum evaporation (pressure < 1 × 10−5 Pa) for opaque or semi-transparent Pero-SCs, respectively. The active area was defined by the area of a shadow mask clinging to substrates.
Characterization
The absorption spectrum of perovskite films was measured on a Cary 5000 (Agilent) spectrophotometer. SEM images were taken on an S-4700 (Hitachi) electron microscope. XRD was measured on a D2 PHASER (Bruker) diffractometer. Color coordinates were recorded on a Spectra Scan PR-670 (Photo Research) spectroradiometer. J–V curves were tested using a 2400 (Keithley) system under simulated AM 1.5 G solar light with power of 100 mW cm−2. The effective active area (7.57 mm2) was defined by a mask during the test. The corresponding EQE spectra were measured by a solar cell spectral response measurement system (QE-R3011; Enli Technology) in air. The illumination intensities of the light sources used in J–V curves and EQE measurements were calibrated by standard single-crystal silicon solar cells.

A recommended approach to evaluate the AVT is generally accepted by window industry is to weight the integration of the transmission spectrum against the photonic response of human eyes,54–56 where λ is the wavelength, T is the transmission, P is the photopic response, and S is the solar photon flux (AM 1.5 G) for window applications, or 1 for other applications. To the best of our knowledge, all the AVTs of semi-transparent Pero-SCs in the literature were calculated by the integration of the transmission spectrum. To make a parallel comparison, the calculation of the AVTs in this study are also adopted the same approach.
