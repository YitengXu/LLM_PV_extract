    , Accepted 30th March 2016First published on 1st April 2016AbstractThe effects of UV-ozone (UVO) irradiation on copper-doped nickel acetate and its applicability to perovskite solar cells were investigated. UVO irradiation of copper-doped nickel acetate significantly increased the electrical conductivity (from 4.28 × 10−4 S cm−1 to 5.66 × 10−2 S cm−1), which is due to the increased carrier concentration (from 3.53 × 1013 cm−3 to 2.41 × 1016 cm−3), and the charge extraction efficiency was enhanced, leading to better compatibility with the hole transport layer. By UVO irradiation, the work function was increased from 4.95 eV to 5.33 eV by the surface dipole formation, which effectively reduced the interface barrier between the hole transport layer and the MAPbI3 light absorbing layer. UVO Irradiation of the underlying layer also allows the MAPbI3 precursors to form better morphology with highly arranged crystallinity. Compared to the cells using non-irradiated copper doped nickel acetate, UVO-irradiated copper-doped nickel acetate devices showed an enhanced open-circuit voltage (3% increase), short circuit current (16% increase), fill factor (5% increase), showing an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 12.2% (21% increase).
1. Introduction
Perovskite-based solar cells have attracted considerable attention because of their rapidly increased power conversion efficiency (PCE). Since methyl ammonium lead iodide(MAPbI3) based photovoltaic showing a PCE of 9.7% was first reported,1 many groups have reported various ways of controlling the crystallization of MAPbI3 such as solvent engineering,2–5 additive6–8 and annealing techniques.9 As a reproducible way of MAPbI3 crystallization has been known to the academic world, researchers are now focusing on implementing new interfacial layers.10–14 Among the various interfacial layers, polyethylene dioxythiophene:polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is normally used because of its ease of spin-casting, efficient hole transport property and high conductivity in polymeric compounds. However, the widely-used PEDOT:PSS has some drawbacks such as an inefficient ability to block electrons,15 low performance and acidic and hygroscopic properties, which makes the device unstable. Recently, as metal oxide semiconductors have been shown as a potential replacement of PEDOT:PSS, many groups reported various structures such as PEDOT:PSS:metal oxide mixtures, PEODT:PSS/metal oxide bilayer and metal oxide single layer. For example, PEDOT:PSS:metal oxide mixtures using WOx,16 NiOx,17 and MoOx18 are recently demonstrated. In addition, a PEDOT:PSS/metal oxide bilayer with MoOx19 was fabricated, and a metal oxide single layer device based on NiOx20–22 has been reported. Among the various inorganic semiconductors, nickel oxide (NiOx) has attracted attention because of its large bandgap and considerably deep valence band maximum (VBM).22 Investigations of nickel oxide semiconductors are now proceeding from two ways, doping of the nickel complex and further treatment. Pristine nickel oxide-based cells are not satisfactory compared to the performance of devices based on PEDOT:PSS because of their relatively low fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc). However, doping of the nickel complex can compensate for the lack of FF and Jsc by increasing the electrical conductivity and by its variety of chemical compositions. To date, copper-doped NiOx based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated by solution-processing and the combustion method, showing a PCE of 15.4%22 and 17.7%.23 In addition, lithium- and magnesium-doped nickel compound hole transporting layer-based solar cells have shown a PCE of 16.2%.24
In the viewpoint of further treatment, UVO irradiation has been discovered as an effective approach to enhance the work function (WF) of electrodes and modifies the chemical composition of the surface, which performs new property. For example, indium–tin oxide (ITO) is used as an anode for PSCs; the UVO treatment is an essential process to improve the Jsc by reducing the loss between the layers. In a similar manner, UVO treatment is also performed on various electrodes such as PEDOT:PSS25 and ZnO.26 This results in the formation of a surface dipole, which leads to an enhancement of the WF, charge transport and PCE. Herein, we conducted two state-of-the-art experiments (doping, UVO irradiation) on the nickel acetate hole transport layer and studied the effect of UV-ozone irradiation. Copper doping and further UVO treatment on the nickel containing acetate layer increased the conductivity by 30 folds, which effectively reduces the serial resistance. In addition, the device shows a highly increased Jsc, which is mainly due to the better crystallization of the UVO-treated copper-doped nickel acetate. We denoted copper-doped nickel acetate without UVO irradiation as “Cu:Ni(ac)” and copper-doped nickel acetate with UVO irradiation as “UVO-Cu:Ni(ac)”.
2. Experimental section
Preparation of nickel acetate solution and copper doped nickel acetate solution
To prepare the nickel acetate solution, nickel acetate tetra hydrate [Ni (OCOCH3)2·4H20) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.998%)] is dissolved into 2-methoxyethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%) and monoethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich), which functions as a stabilizer. Monoethanolamine concentration is maintained with the same mole concentration of nickel acetate tetrahydrate. For doping copper into a nickel acetate solution, copper acetate monohydrate (Cu (CO2CH3)2·H2O) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%, trace metals basis) is mixed with nickel acetate tetra hydrate powder with the ratio of our choice. The solution is stirred for 4 h at 60 °C in an oil filled petri-dish and stored at room temperature for 12 h with vigorous stirring and used for thin film formation after PTFE filtering (pore size: 0.45μm).
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
The planar heterojunction perovskite (MAPbI3) solar cells were fabricated using the procedure described below. The ITO substrates (∼10 Ω sq−1) were cleaned sequentially in acetone, methanol, and isopropanol for 15 min, and rinsed by deionized water. The as-prepared ITO was dried on the hotplate for 15 min at 80 °C and further cleaned by a UVO treatment for 15 min. The hole transporting layer [PEDOT:PSS (HC Stark PVP AI4083), nickel acetate or copper doped nickel acetate] was spin coated on the substrate and annealed at 130 °C (PEDOT:PSS) ad 245 °C (acetate) for 20 min (PEDOT:PSS) or 90 min (acetate). The prepared substrates were treated with UVO irradiation for the nickel acetate hole transporting layers. Perovskite absorber layer, 40 wt% of methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO):gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) (3:7 v/v) was then spin coated with 4000 rpm for 1 min and 0.8 ml of anhydrous toluene was dropped quickly in 15 seconds27 after spin started and annealed at 100 °C for 90 min in ambient air. PC61BM (2 wt% in chlorobenzene) was spin coated on the perovskite layer with 1500 rpm. The Al layer (∼120 nm) was thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber of 1 × 10−7 torr at an evaporation rate of 2.5 Å s−1. The thickness of the cathode layer was controlled using a SQC-310 (INIFICON) deposition controller with TS06IG (6 MHz Gold, ITASCO) quartz crystals. Finally, the cell was encapsulated by UV curing. The device was covered with glass encapsulation in a N2 condition glove box.
Characterization
The ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy data at ambient temperature were recorded using a UVS-2100 SCINCO spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence (PL) was measured using a FP6500 with a fixed excitation wavelength (600 nm) at room temperature. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was conducted using a Hitachi S-4700. The film thickness was measured using a Dektak Alpha Step Profiler. The sheet resistance was measured by the 4 point probe technique using a KEYTHELY 2635a source meter. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using an X-ray diffractometer X'pert PRO with Cu Kα targets (λ = 0.154 nm) at a scanning rate of 1.5° min−1 and a generating voltage at 45 kV with time per step fixed at 0.5 ms. Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) was performed in the non-contact mode using the XE-100 Park Systems. Each sample was measured with X,Y scan size of 3 μm, 3 μm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were monitored using a PHI 5000 Versa Probe (Ulvac-PHI) with a Al Kα (1486.6 eV) anode (24.5 W, 15 kV) under a background pressure of 6.7 × 10−8 Pa with a fixed spot size of 100 μm × 100 μm and a calibrated C1s peak (284.6 eV). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a KEYTHELY 2410 source unit.
3. Results and discussion
Conductivity and optical transmittance
To characterize the influence of UVO irradiation on the electrical properties of Cu:Ni(ac), we carried out C-AFM measurements. As described in Fig. 1(a), one can see significantly increased vertical current of UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) film compared to that of Cu:Ni(ac). When we biased 0.1 V, the average vertical current of Cu:Ni(ac) was 150 pA but after UVO irradiation, an approximately 400 pA current was measured, suggesting increased electrical conductivity upon UVO irradiation. In addition, the average vertical current of Ni(ac) was 14 pA, which is illustrated in Fig. S1.† It is worth noting that the conductivity is increased around 30 times by the doping process and additional UVO irradiation. Possible explanations are that copper has a slightly higher ionic radius than nickel ions.28 Thus, copper possibly occupies the metal sites of nickel oxide and then it forms a substituent defect, which derives the formation of Ni3+. This is the main reason for the p type conductivity of nickel oxide semiconductor.29 Thermal oxidation process forms Ni3+ in the lattice, which derives the p-type property of a nickel-based semiconductor. On the other hand, the UVO process forms additional Ni3+ in the lattice, as described in Fig. S2,† which contributes to the increase in p-type electrical conductivity of Cu:Ni(ac) layer. As already known, the increased amount of hydroxyl groups by the UVO treatment on the surface may be helpful for non-transformed underlying layer to be connected electrically to the upper active layer in the ohmic region, effectively reducing the contact resistance, where an increased vertical current can be obtained.30 However, the non-uniform current of the Cu:Ni(ac) surface is presented, which is due mainly to the non-uniform surface features induced by the unstable solution derived oxidization process.31Fig. 1(b) shows the optical transmittance spectrum of an 8 nm thick solution-derived Cu:Ni(ac), UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) along with the spectrum for a 35 nm thick PEDOT:PSS film, which is used as a reference. Cu:Ni(ac) and PEDOT:PSS thin films are more than 90% transparent in the entire visible region. However, UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) thin film shows around 83% transparency in the starting point of the visible region and increases with increasing wavelength.

(b) Observed transmittance of thin films of PEDOT:PSS, Cu:Ni(ac) and UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) at a thickness of 8 nm (Cu:Ni(ac)) and 31 nm (PEDO T:PSS).

This is mainly because more hydroxyl groups are introduced on the surface of the thin film, reflecting the decreasing transmittance.32 The increased presence of hydroxyl groups was confirmed by XPS measurement, which is described in Fig. S2.† In Fig. S2(c),† the ratio of the peak intensity at 855 nm (NiOOH) to the intensity at 852 nm (NiO) is increased greatly after the UVO treatment, which indicates that nickel oxide on the surface has been transformed to a hydroxyl group by a UVO treatment. Although compositional ratio of copper atom is smaller than that of nickel atom in this experiment (copper:nickel = 5:95), another possible reason for decreased transmittance after UVO irradiation can be the additional formation of copper hydroxyl groups on the surface and Cu2O and CuO in the lattice, which has a lower energy bandgap (2.1 eV and 1.3 eV)33 compared to that of NiO (3.1 eV).34 To further investigate the effect of the copper doping ratio on the optical property, additional UV-Vis measurements based on very thick films (d = 120 nm) were performed, as shown in Fig. S3.† After UVO irradiation, the transmittance gap between the variant ratios of copper doped films was quite distinguishable, which indicates that a higher copper presence in the Ni(ac) results in decreased optical transmittance (Table 1). The decrease in transmittance is mainly due to the decreased energy band gap with increasing copper doping ratio.35 These results indicate that the UVO irradiation of Cu:Ni(ac) causes trade-off between the electrical conductivity and the optical transmittance. The increased conductivity of the underlying layer decreases the serial resistance, leading to an increase in the FF in the device. On the other hand, the decreased transmittance hinders the solar flux to reach to the MAPbI3 layer, which leads to a low Jsc. To determine the optimal time of UVO irradiation, we plotted the sheet resistance and, transmittance versus UVO treatment time, which is described in Fig. 1(c). As expected, the sheet resistance and transmittance decreased with increasing UVO treatment time. The optimized irradiation time was 12 min, where optical transmittance was 86% and the sheet resistance was 24 × 104 Ω sq−1.

Sheet resistance
A detailed study of the sheet resistance versus various experimental parameters is discussed in Fig. 2. All the thin films were spin coated and annealed on the ITO substrate and a mean value of more than 10 thin films are collected. The reproducibility of the optimized condition-derived film is described in Fig. S4.†Fig. 2(a) shows the sheet resistance versus annealing temperature of the non-irradiated Cu:Ni(ac) films.
 Fig. 2  Measured Rs (sheet resistance) using a four-point probe as a function of (a and b) annealing temperature [°C], (c) UVO treatment time [min], (d and e) thickness [nm], (f) storing time after the UVO treatment [nm], (g and h) copper doping ratio [%], (i) annealing time [min]. *Average values of the sheet resistances were averaged over 20 thin films. 
The sheet resistance starts decreasing as the annealing temperature increases to 325 °C. At a processing temperature below 325 °C, the thin films still contained a mixture of residual non-conductive precursor.34 When annealed at 325 °C, the film fully converted to Cu:NiO.22 However, after 325 °C, the underlying ITO substrate was damaged, decomposed oxygen diffused to the Cu:Ni(ac) layer, which possibly induces a decrease in sheet resistance.36 On the other hand, UVO irradiated film showed the best sheet resistance at a processing temperature of 250 °C (Fig. 2(b)), which is more desirable for implementing in a future plastic substrate. A 250 °C process temperature was not enough to fully convert the precursor to the oxide semiconductor, but the solution-processed Cu:Ni(ac) precursor could be converted to Cu:(Ni2O3, NiO and NiOOH) by the application of the UVO treatment at a relatively low temperature.37 Even in the high temperature oxidation process, there is the possibility of acetate precursors not being fully converted to oxide semiconductors, which induces low electrical conductivity. On the other hand, after the UVO treatment, residual non-oxidized precursors can be fully oxidized, which was confirmed by XPS. (Fig. S2(b)†). In particular, in this article, we used mixed precursors. Improved doping efficiency can also be explained by the dual oxidization process, wherein the thermal process is boosted by UVO irradiation, which oxidizes the residual component. Fig. 2(c) describes the sheet resistance versus UVO treatment time, suggesting the lowest sheet resistance (21 × 104 Ω sq−1) at 15 min of irradiation. However, there is trade-off between the sheet resistance and optical transmittance; 12 min of irradiation was the optimized time, as discussed above. Fig. 2(d) and (e) illustrate the sheet resistance versus film thickness. The solution-derived Cu:Ni(ac) films did not follow a linear relationship with the thickness, which suggests the presence of a spatial distribution of conductivity between the bulk and surface. This is due to the distribution of the carrier concentration of bulk and surface of solution-derived Cu:NiO films.38,39Fig. 2(f) illustrates the sheet resistance versus storing time in ambient air. The Cu:Ni(ac) films are irradiated and measured as a function of the storing time. It shows the lowest sheet resistance after irradiation, and it starts increasing from 32 × 104 Ω sq−1 to more than 200 × 106 Ω sq−1. 200 × 106 Ω sq−1 was the maximum measurable value. This is because UVO-derived nickel hydroxyl ion incorporation during contact with oxygen leads to water formation, which facilitates the degradation.40Fig. 2(g) and (h) describe the sheet resistance versus copper doping ratio. An increased copper concentration leads to high conductivity, which is due to the increased carrier concentration,25,33 as can be seen in Fig. S5.† The non-copper doped sample also shows a similar result, which indicates that the UVO treatment is effective in increasing the electrical conductivity for both Ni(ac) and Cu:Ni(ac). Fig. 2(i) shows the sheet resistance versus annealing time. At least 30 min is required to fully oxidize and additional heat energy possibly changes the direct transition band gap. This modifies the carrier concentration,41 which leads to a slightly lower sheet resistance.
UVO treatment effect on surface and perovskite crystallization
It is well known that the film quality and surface morphology of the MAPbI3 light absorbing layer are the most important factors in determining the ultimate solar cell performance. To understand the influence of UVO irradiation to the Cu:Ni(ac) interface on perovskite crystallization, we carried out AFM, XRD, SEM and contact angle measurements, as shown in Fig. 3. Surface roughness of the controlled hole transport layer and upper MAPbI3 layer is first characterized by the non-contact mode of AFM. As shown in Fig. 3(a), root-mean-square (rms) value of Cu:Ni(ac)/ITO (2.217 nm) was higher than PEDOT:PSS/ITO (1.482 nm). However, rms value of UVO-Cu:Ni(ac)/ITO (2.029 nm) is slightly decreased after UVO irradiation, which confirms that UVO treatment makes the surface smoother.42 In a polymer solar cell, it is widely known that smoother underlying layer facilitated to form better morphology of upper polymeric light absorbing layer.43–45 However, in this case, the best coverage and highest crystallinity of the MAPbI3 were obtained on the uneven UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) substrate. This was confirmed by XRD, which is shown in Fig. 3(b). The peaks of MAPbI3 on UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) was higher than the MAPbI3 film on the PEDOT:PSS and Cu:Ni(ac).

Reference XRD peaks of MAPbI3 (star mark) and PbI2 (red dash line) are displayed inside. (c) SEM images of the thin films, as written inside [calculated average grain size is displayed inside]. (d) FWHM collected from the XRD data (2θ = 14.1°) and average grain size calculated from SEM versus different hole transport layers. (e) Contact angle of DMSO and GBL mixture solvent dropped on the surface of Cu:Ni(ac) and UVO-Cu:Ni(ac), respectively. 
The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the first peak (2θ = 14.42°) of MAPbI3 on PEDOT:PSS was 0.63, on Cu:Ni(ac) was 0.50, and on UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) was 0.47. This suggests that a MAPbI3 grain on the UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) has the highest crystallinity. We conducted additional SEM measurements. The mean grain size of MAPbI3 was calculated and is written inside the SEM image. The MAPbI3 grain on the Cu:Ni(ac) has an average size of 238 nm, but one can see that it has a relatively low coverage compared to MAPbI3 on PEDOT:PSS. The low coverage possibly causes a shunt path that induces a decrease in Voc. However, MAPbI3 on the UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) shows better coverage than that on the Cu:Ni(ac) and larger grain than that on the PEDOT:PSS. The relationship between the FWHM and grain size is described in Fig. 3(d). The enhanced crystal quality is strongly related to the wettability. After the UVO treatment, as shown in Fig. 3(e), the contact angle of the mixture solvent (DMSO:GBL) of perovskite precursor decreases (from 13.3° to 4.9°), which means that it has better wettability. The better wettability facilitates the precursor to spread to the entire substrate region. Although it has better wettability, the roughness of the underlying layer is an important parameter to estimate the quality of the spin-coated upper layer. Our result indicates that a better wettability and higher roughness (surface of UVO-Cu:Ni(ac)) are beneficial for securing empty space to form a single larger grain, which is schematically shown in Fig. S6.†
Hole extraction efficiency
We conducted a further investigation using PL to evaluate the efficiency of extracting the photo generated carriers from the MAPbI3 light absorbing layer. Fig. 4(a) describes the steady state PL results of the MAPbI3 film on the glass, glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS, glass/ITO/Cu:Ni(ac), and glass/ITO/UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) substrates.

A greater reduction of the PL intensity was noticed on the UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) compared to that of the non-irradiated Cu:Ni(ac) substrate. The UVO irradiation effect on the hole extraction efficiency was investigated further by the time-resolved PL, as described in Fig. 4(b). It is obvious that UVO-Cu:Ni(ac)/MAPbI3 thin films show significantly decreased exciton lifetimes in the MAPbI3 light absorbing layer compared to the non-irradiated Cu:Ni(ac), indicating that UVO irradiation improves hole collection and transport efficiency, which follows naturally from the increased electrical conductivity (Fig. 1 and 2) and carrier concentration(Fig. S5†).
Structure and energy level diagram

Fig. 5(a) shows the schematic device structure of the device. The copper-doped nickel hydroxide dipole layer was formed by the UVO treatment, which increases the WF of the hole transport layer.45,46 The increased WF was confirmed by the UPS result shown in Fig. 5(c). The vacuum level was shifted and the valence band edge is also close to the Fermi level of the semiconductor, which leads to better p-type conductivity. The enhanced p-type property was confirmed further by the Hall Effect measurement (Fig. S5†).

In the case of 5% copper doped Ni(ac), the carrier concentration of Cu:Ni(ac) was 3.53 × 1013 cm−3, but it increased to the 2.41 × 1016 cm−3 after UVO irradiation. The energy gap between the VBM and fermi energy decreased from 0.3 eV to 0.15 eV after treatment with UVO. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the VBM of copper doped nickel acetate was increased to 5.48 eV, which has better energy level alignment with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of MAPbI3, thereby reducing the carrier loss between the MAPBI3 interface and hole transport layer.
Performance
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) cells presented better performance than the Cu:Ni(ac) cells, which might be due to the higher crystallinity and better morphology of the MAPbI3 layer on UVO-Cu:Ni(ac) as well as the enhanced hole extraction efficiency. UVO Irradiation to Cu:Ni(ac) significantly increased the conductivity, which leads to an increased average FF compared to the non-irradiated devices, as shown in Table 2. The increase in Voc is mainly due to the better energy level alignment with the MAPbI3 layer after UVO irradiation. Fig. 6(b) shows the device performance as a function of the UVO treatment time. The Voc of all devices are similar but Jsc of the device changes according to the UVO treatment time. 5 min of UVO treatment time was not effective in modifying the surface of the Cu:Ni(ac) thin film. UVO irradiation of 12 min on non-copper doped Ni(ac) device also showed a similar effect on the device performance, which is described in Fig. S7.†

The optimized condition devices (12 min of irradiation) show best Jsc (18.02 mA cm−2). However, 20 min of irradiation decreased Jsc even though it has high conductivity (Fig. 2).
This is possibly due to the decreased transmittance of Cu:Ni(ac) (Fig. 1(c)) and the relatively high rate defect formation, which results in loss of carriers and a decrease in absorbed solar flux in the MAPbI3 layer. Fig. 6(c) and Fig. S8† show the reproducibility of the solar cell parameters. Fig. 6(d) shows the J–V curves under forward and reverse bias scans of our devices. The UVO treated Cu:Ni(ac) devices show relatively high hysteresis. It is known that the trap states on the surface of the underlying layers could cause the discrepancy.46 However, the UVO process forms additional Ni2+ vacancies, which induce Ni3+ or nickel hydroxides. This additional Ni2+ vacancy increases the p-type electrical conductivity, but could confine the charge carriers, similar to the trap state, and possibly induce hysteresis.
4. Conclusion
This study investigated the effects of the UVO irradiation on copper doped nickel acetate and its applicability to perovskite solar cells. By UVO irradiation to the hole transporting layer, the conductivity is increased significantly and the hole extraction efficiency is also enhanced, leading to the increase of Jsc and FF. Irradiation alters the surface composition of the underlying layer so that a better morphology of MAPbI3 and better performance could be achieved. UVO Irradiation forms additional Ni2+ vacancies, which is beneficial for increasing p-type electrical conductivity but may perform like a trap state.
