    , Accepted 28th January 2023First published on 30th January 2023AbstractWith the increase in the greenhouse effect and reduction of fossil fuel resources, it is urgent to find a feasible solution to directly convert power to chemicals using renewable energy and achieving zero carbon emissions targets. It is necessary to convert renewable energy (i.e., solar, wind, water, etc.) into electrical power replacing fossil-fuel-fired power. Therefore, the power-to-chemicals approach is gaining more and more attention. In the past two decades, non-thermal plasma, electro-catalysis, photo-catalysis, and their hybrid approaches have shown great potential for the power-to-chemicals solution. This paper introduces the application of plasma technology in energy conversion, focusing on three main routes for plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis, and analyses the state-of-the-art. Research results of ammonia synthesis based on plasma technology are discussed. The application of advanced in situ diagnostics evidences the importance of specific intermediate species and reaction pathways. Electrons, vibrationally-excited species, free radicals, and surface-adsorbed species play important roles in plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. Combined with experiments and simulations, the mechanisms of plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis are examined. Vibrationally-excited species can effectively reduce the catalytic surface energy barrier. The techno-economics of the plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis technology is discussed in view of its competitive advantages. It is emphasized that the power-to-chemicals approach can be adapted for most chemical manufacturers, and these methods would play crucial roles in reducing carbon emissions and environmental pollution. Finally, suggestions are provided for the sustainable development of the power-to-chemicals industry in the future.
1. Direct conversion of power to chemicals using renewable energy
There is a major conflict between the increasing demand for chemicals and the necessity to control greenhouse gas emissions1 in the development of today’s world. As we know, traditional chemical manufacturing is accompanied by a large amount of energy consumption, pollution, and greenhouse gases, arising from widespread fossil fuel use. For example, the Haber–Bosch process is one of the most energy-intense processes, which consumes 1–2% of the world’s energy and is responsible for 1.44% of carbon dioxide emissions annually.2 At present, fossil fuels are depleting, so it is increasingly important to replace traditional fossil energy with renewable energy. However, the well-developed, centralized, and large-scale facilities are facing a compatibility challenge with renewable and sustainable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, etc. Therefore, exploring methods of utilizing renewable energy sources for clean and potentially zero-carbon-emissions chemicals manufacturing is crucial.
There are two pathways to accomplish this goal as shown in Fig. 1. One is developing and using renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels gradually. Fossil fuels play important roles in traditional industries. They can be used for heating in chemical plants to maintain the internal temperature of the reactor at a necessary level and for generating electricity. Smith et al.3 proposed electrification of the chemical industry by increasing reliance for chemical production on the use of electricity from renewable energy sources. For example, steam methane reforming consumes about 76% of the energy which is from methane in the Haber–Bosch process. The remaining methane is used as a fuel to maintain the reaction at optimum conditions. If the Haber Bosch process can be fully powered by the electricity from renewable energy sources, the emission of CO2 can be reduced from 1.673 t CO2/t NH3 to only 0.38 t CO2/t NH3. Therefore, it is a better choice to use uniformly clean energy such as electricity in the production process.

Another way is achieving a power-to-chemicals approach in practice, which means the use of electricity generated by renewable energy sources to produce chemicals.4 Along with replacing the energy used by the reactor with electricity, the mechanisms of the intermediate reactions also change. Chen et al.5 reported that N2 fixation can be realized through enzymes, electrolysis, non-thermal plasma (NTP), and photo-catalysis. These methods avoid the high cost and environmental impact of methane steam reforming (which accounts for the bulk of the cost of the Haber–Bosch process) and could provide a decentralized approach to ammonia production. NTP is a promising and effective technology for activating the molecules with strong chemical bonds at milder conditions.6 The generation of high-energy electrons, vibrationally-excited species and radicals can reduce the energy barrier of the reaction, which can be coupled with catalysts to further improve the efficiency of reactions. The plasma-based processes may potentially achieve higher energy efficiency than traditional methods.
However, plasma-enabled reactions also face some critical problems that need to be solved, such as the complexity of plasma-catalysis mechanisms, diagnostics of the plasma-catalytic reaction, viable pathways for industry adoption, and methods for coupling with renewable energy. Researchers focus on the understanding the mechanisms related to interactions of plasmas and catalysts. With the application of more advanced diagnostic techniques, deeper insights can be obtained into the reaction mechanisms. How to realize the large-scale industrial application of plasma-enabled technology and the practical coupling with renewable energy are also issues that need urgent discussion. Using plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis as an example, this article discusses the current knowledge, research progress, challenges, and potential research directions for the direct production of chemicals utilizing renewable electric power.
2. Plasma-enabled energy conversion
To develop the power-to-chemicals approach, NTP technology, electro-catalysis, photo-catalysis, and their hybrids are currently being developed for applications in the chemicals industry. Among them, the NTP technology has broad prospects in the use of electricity to produce raw chemical materials and synergize with catalysts for many chemical reactions directly, such as ammonia synthesis, dry reforming of methane (DRM), and production of C2 hydrocarbons from methane. The NTP generates abundant energetic electrons and highly reactive species (such as excited atoms and molecules, and free radicals). Hence, the NTP has the advantages of high activity and broad efficacy. Upon coupling the NTP with suitable catalysts, the excited and charged species in the NTP may reduce the reaction energy barriers of thermocatalytic reactions; meanwhile, the electric field in NTP may also affect the catalytic path while the ultraviolet photons in the NTP also enhance the photocatalytic effect.7
The generation of the NTP depends on the excitation sources, electrode structures, operating gases, and pressure under different electromagnetic properties, as shown in Fig. 2.8 Different excitation sources have different voltage levels, frequencies, and waveforms. Therefore, for various discharge systems, the selected excitation sources are not the same. Common excitation sources are direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), nanosecond repetitive pulse (NRP), radio frequency (RF), and microwave (MW) sources. The structures of the electrode mainly include the barrier electrode, bare electrode, and passive electrode. To achieve plasma discharges under different sources of electromagnetic excitation ranging from low to high frequency, the operating gases can be divided into non-rare gases, such as air, oxygen, nitrogen, etc., and noble gases such as helium, argon, xenon, etc. Under atmospheric pressure conditions, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ), corona, spark, gliding arc discharge (GAD), and arc plasma discharges can be generated.
 Fig. 2  The diversity, properties, and operating conditions of NTP technology. 
In the past two decades, many kinds of NTPs have been developed, and the performances for many chemical reactions have been tested in NTP reactors with or without catalysts, as shown in Fig. 3. The conversion rates of raw materials, yields of target products, and the energy efficiency should be systematically investigated. In particular, the NRP discharges are suitable for many reactions, such as methane conversion, DRM, nitrogen fixation, etc., owing to their highly reduced electric field (E/N, E is the electric field strength, N is the gas density), high electron energy and high reactivity. The experimental results can be divided into three cases: NTP, plasmas coupled with catalysts, as well as plasma processes hybridized with electro-catalysis or photo-catalysis.
 Fig. 3  The scope of plasma-catalysis technology applications in power-to-chemicals technologies. 
2.1 NTP (plasma only) technology
The applications of NTP technology where plasmas are used without catalysts are diverse and show a reasonable energy efficiency in several processes. Pulsed dielectric barrier discharge is a common plasma reactor used in plasma-enabled energy conversion. Zhang et al.9 achieved a CH4 conversion of 27.9% by applying microsecond-pulsed DBD plasma on DRM and optimizing the reactor structures at a CH4:CO2 ratio of 1:1 and a total flow rate of 50 ml min−1. Zhang et al.10 and Chen et al.11 reported that NRP DBD plasma can implement non-oxidative methane conversion. Zhang et al. showed that the negative streamer discharges had a higher CH4 conversion rate than positive stream discharges. This is because the negative stream has a larger breakdown voltage and discharge current than the positive stream, which enables the generation of more active species and thus improves the transformation of CH4. Chen et al. investigated the effects of different rise times, pulse widths, and pulse repetition frequencies on non-oxidative methane conversion at a flow rate of 25 ml min−1 and achieved a maximum methane conversion rate of 31.9% at a specific energy input (SEI) of 104.8 kJ L−1. Gao et al.12 presented that the maximum conversion rate of methane and energy efficiency of pulsed spark plasma that can be achieved is 91.2% and 44.3% at a gas flow rate of 50 ml min−1, respectively. Furthermore, Liu et al.13 studied the conditions in the needle-plate discharge and found an appropriate electron energy distribution and H radical density to ensure an acceptable product selectivity and conversion rate without consuming too much energy. Wang et al.14 reported that the maximum conversions of methane and carbon dioxide can reach 39.6% and 22.9% at a molar ratio CO2/CH4 of 1:1 and a gas flow rate of 50 ml min−1, respectively, by an NRP DBD plasma. Scapinello et al.15 obtained an energy efficiency of 40% for syngas in a nanosecond repetitive spark plasma. Man et al.16 applied a microbubble-enabled reactor driven by a nanosecond-pulsed power supply to generate plasma-activated water (PAW), which was used for the corresponding antimicrobial effects against Escherichia coli cells.
2.2 Plasma-catalytic technology
Researchers have studied the role of plasma-catalytic reactions in reducing the energy barrier and breaking thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. Gao et al.17 reported that electron-induced vibrationally-excited CO(ν) and a small size Ni–Fe active phase (<10 nm) are important factors to overcome the catalytic energy barrier in plasma involving heterogeneous catalysis. Loenders et al.18 used a microkinetic model to investigate a new approach to plasma-catalytic partial oxidation of methane. By comparing with thermal catalysis, vibrationally-excited CH4 and O2, radicals, and stable intermediates induced by the plasma increase the turnover frequency (TOF) of CH4 dissociation, COx, and oxygenates. Xu et al.19 used metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with NTP to achieve the water–gas shift reaction (WGSR), which had a 2-fold enhancement in WGSR. Kim et al.20 reported that NTP combined with an alloy catalyst promoted CO2 conversion more than 2-fold under thermal conditions in the process of CO2 hydrogenation and broke the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation. Dou et al.21 reported that metallic Co was critical to improving the CH3COOH generation. Neyts et al.22 suggested that there is a synergistic effect between the plasma and catalyst effects. The plasma-catalytic process involves the gas phase and surface reactions. In other words, the yield is determined by gas phase reactions and surface reactions together. The E/N in the gas gap is increased effectively when the catalyst is added to the discharge area, which increases the generation of active species. The microstructure of the catalyst greatly affects the plasma-enabled surface reactions. It is closely related to the morphology, structure, and composition of the catalyst, the catalyst support, and the matching of the plasma parameters. The active species in the plasma reach the surface of the catalyst and reduce the energy required for the chemical reaction. Therefore, the mechanisms of the plasma-catalysis combine the effects of the electromagnetic field, active species, and the surface-supported catalyst.
2.3 Hybrid plasma technology
Furthermore, the performances of NTP and plasma-catalysis can be assisted by photo-catalysis and electro-catalysis to achieve power-to-chemicals. Abiev et al.23 reported that DRM with photo-catalysis combined with NTP has a good potential to convert natural gas into fuels and chemicals under mild conditions. Mei et al.24 reported that combination of the plasma with photo-catalysts contributes to 2.5 times higher CO2 conversion and energy efficiency of the DRM reaction. Meng et al.25 reported that the conversion of methane and propane reached 15% and 48.6% for gasoline with NTP-assisted photo-catalysis. Ren et al.26 reported a method of plasma-enabled N2 oxidation and electro-catalytic NOx− reduction for ammonia synthesis. Although the NTP technology has promising prospects for applications in power-to-chemicals technologies, there is still more work to be done on the way to industrialization. Firstly, high-quality power supplies are needed to generate plasma. It takes a lot of resources and time to produce a durable, stable, high-power, and reliable power source which is suitable for manufacture. Secondly, low energy efficiency is also vital for the application of plasma technology in the chemical industry. A universal plasma reactor needs to be created, which is compatible with diverse hybrid process conditions, such as electro-catalysis, photo-catalysis, electric field, etc. For industrial translation, faradaic efficiency and NH3 production yield need to reach more than 90% and 10−4 mol cm−2 h−1, respectively.27 Thirdly, effective methods for controlling the process selectivity should be found. Reducing the cost of power supplies, designing appropriate plasma reactors, and optimizing catalysts are crucial for developing stable and high-performance power-to-chemical systems and processes.
3. Towards industrial ammonia synthesis based on NTPs
Considering the high-energy consumption and environmental issues caused by the industrial Haber–Bosch process, energy-efficient and environmentally benign alternatives for NH3 synthesis are urgently needed, especially green-chemistry, light, or electricity-driven processes (i.e., photo-catalysis, electro-catalysis, and NTPs) using renewable energy, to approach the ultimate goal of zero carbon emissions. As a prominently electrified ‘power-to-chemicals’ approach, the NTPs have been extensively investigated for NH3 synthesis through the three routes operated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Fig. 4). In the past decade, researchers have paid great attention to the plasma-catalytic NH3 synthesis via the nitrogen reduction by H2 (route I: N2 → NH3) and suggested that the vibrational state N2(ν1) in the plasma can reduce the activation energy barrier of N2 molecules to overcome the scaling relationship. However, the energy efficiency of route I remains at several g NH3 kW−1 h−1. The specific reaction paths and rate-limiting steps in the reaction process are still unclear, while the synergistic mechanisms of the plasma-catalysis require further studies. Recently, researchers have also proposed the plasma-enabled nitrogen conversion by H2O (route II: N2 → NOx + NH3).5,6 To improve the energy efficiency, the process can be divided into two steps (route III: N2 → NOx → NH3): firstly using plasma-assisted nitrogen oxidation and coupling electro-catalytic reduction to NH3. However, the products and reaction processes of route II are more complex, and the energy efficiency of route III needs further improvement to meet the requirements of practical applications.
 Fig. 4  Plausible sustainable routes for plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis. 
3.1 Route I (N2 → NH3)
The direct route to ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2 by NTP technology dates back to the beginning of the century.28 The concentration of NH3 can reach 12500 ppm using a microscopic gap dielectric barrier discharge at ambient pressure, but the energy efficiency of NH3 is in the range of 1.53–1.83 g NH3 kW−1 h−1 and needs to be further increased. For viability in industrial applications, the energy efficiency of ammonia synthesis needs to reach 150–200 g NH3 kW−1 h−1.29 The improvement of the energy efficiency by changing the plasma parameters is limited. This is why plasma-catalytic processes have recently attracted major attention. Researchers coupled packed-bed plasma reactors with different catalysts (tubular membrane-like catalyst,30 Ru-based multifunctional mesoporous catalyst,31 supported microporous catalyst,32 Ru–Mg/γ-Al2O3 catalyst,33 Ni/Al2O3 catalyst,34 Zeolite 5A,35 mesoporous silica SBA-15,36 mesoporous MCM-41 catalyst,6etc.) to increase the yield of NH3 and energy efficiency. Different catalysts have different mechanisms for the energy efficiency of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. The porous structure of the catalyst can help reduce the decomposition rate of ammonia in the plasma phase, which increases the yield and the energy efficiency of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. The reaction pathways on the catalyst surface in plasma-catalysis are different from thermal catalysis because the excited species in the plasma interact with the catalyst surface. Mehta et al.37 proposed that the vibrationally excited N2 in an NTP may participate in the catalyst surface reaction and the activity trend of metal-based catalysts in the plasma-catalytic system is different compared to thermal catalysis. This finding shows that the plasma and thermal catalytic processes follow different mechanisms. The matching of parameters between the plasma and the catalyst is also essential. By adjusting the matching of the plasma discharge parameters, the energy efficiency of catalytic reaction can be improved by tens of times. Representatively, Kim et al.33 achieved the record-breaking energy efficiency of 35.7 g NH3 kW−1 h−1 using a nanosecond pulsed packed-bed reactor with Ru(2) Mg(5)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst at N2:H2 = 4:1 under 300 °C and atmospheric pressure.
3.2 Route II N2 → NH3 + NOx
Haruyama et al.38 showed a non-catalyzed one-step ammonia synthesis from atmospheric air/nitrogen and water at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and they used the current reaction system to produce 3.7 mg W−1 h−1 m−2 of ammonia. It was suggested that the rate-limiting step of the plasma/liquid interfacial reaction is hydrogen extraction from the surface of the aqueous phase. The authors39 also reported that the plasma/liquid interfacial reaction for ammonia production can be increased by irradiating the water phase with UV radiation. Gorbanev et al.40 investigated water vapor as a hydrogen source for nitrogen fixation into NH3 by the NTP in contact with liquid H2O and obtained an energy consumption of 15 MJ mol−1 for total N2 fixation with the additional advantage of using H2O vapor in the absence of a catalyst. Further isotope tracing experiments showed that H in water vapor was the only hydrogen source in the ammonia synthesis. Hawtof et al.41 presented a hybrid electrolytic system for the study of ammonia formation and reported the record-high faradaic efficiency (up to 100%) at 2 mA for ammonia from nitrogen and water at atmospheric pressure and temperature. Zhang et al.42 demonstrated the plasma-catalytic production of NH3 using nitrogen and water with the highest production rate of 2.67 nmol gcat−1 h−1 and found that the plasma-induced vibrational excitation decreased the N2 and H2O dissociation barriers.
3.3 Route III N2 → NOx → NH3
Nitrogen-containing compounds also can be produced by using the carbon-free NTP technology via NOx production, as the research by Pei et al.,13,59 usually applying a spark discharge or GAD reactor. Vervloessem et al.43 presented a pulsed plasma jet for direct NOx production from air with a record-low energy consumption of 0.42 MJ (mol N)−1, which is very close to the industrial Haber–Bosch process. The hybrid plasma technology can combine the advantages of high activity of the NTP and the high selectivity of electrocatalysis, which holds great promise for the renewable ammonia synthesis. Sun et al.44 reported an innovative hybrid plasma electro-catalytic process for scalable green ammonia at ambient conditions by coupling plasma-driven NOx generation with electro-catalytic NOx reduction. They used an NTP bubble column reactor to generate NOx intermediaries at a low specific energy consumption of 3.8 kW h mol−1 and converted the NOx intermediaries to ammonia using a scalable electrolyzer at a rate of 23.2 mg h−1. Li et al.45 coupled the facile activation of N2 to NOx− by the NTP technique and highly selective conversion of NOx− to NH3 by electrocatalytic reduction using air and water as low-cost raw materials for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions, with significant ammonia production of 198.3 mμ mol cm−2 h−1 and nearly 100% faradaic efficiency. Ren et al.26 systematically investigated the plasma-enabled N2 activation process in a nanosecond-pulsed air spark discharge and decoupled the electrocatalytic NOx− reduction mechanism using copper nanoparticles as a representative electrocatalyst, achieving a high NH3 yield rate of ∼40 nmol s−1 cm−2 and faradaic efficiency of nearly 90%. Sharma et al.18,60 reported an all-electric method for the sustainable production of ammonia from nitrogen and water using plasma-activated proton-conducting solid oxide electrolyzers. The hydrogen species produced by the oxidation of water on the anode are transported to the cathode through the proton-conducting membrane, where it reacts with the plasma-activated nitrogen toward ammonia. The NH3 productivity and Faraday efficiency reached 26.8 nmol of NH3 s−1 cm−2 and 88%, respectively. Wu et al.27 also proposed a tandem “plasma-electrocatalysis” strategy for air-to-NH3 coupling an atmospheric rotating gliding arc plasma jet system with a customized three-electrode H-type cell system, and achieved an ammonia yield rate of 1.43 mg cm−2 h−1 with almost 100% faradaic efficiency. Large quantities of NOx are produced by the spark and GAD, and then NOx is reduced to NH3 by an established electrochemical process, which can contribute to the development of large-scale production of synthetic ammonia. This is undoubtedly the closest technological route to industrial translation among the above-discussed three routes. The plasma NOx production is well established, and current research is focused on finding efficient catalysts and reactor structures for the effective conversion of NOx to NH3.
4. Challenges and opportunities
4.1 Current status and key challenges
There are still many challenges and unknowns in plasma-enabled NH3 synthesis, which require combining plasma reactor design, catalyst design, density functional theory, kinetic modeling, in situ diagnostic techniques, machine learning, and so on to accelerate the development of innovative plasma-enabled NH3 synthesis technology. It is critically important to know what we presently do not know. Experimental research focusing on the process optimization requires deeper insights into the mechanisms of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. The type of the plasma discharge, the electrical parameters of the excitation sources, and the design of the catalysts affect the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis reactions. Based on the current status of these experiments, we have highlighted the three plasma-enabled pathways as described in Section 3. Advanced in situ diagnostic techniques coupled with the plasma-catalysis reactions are needed to study the plasma-specific reactions on the catalyst surface, thus laying a solid foundation for analysing the plasma-catalysis mechanisms. Researchers have analysed the mechanisms of plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis by establishing microkinetic models combined with DFT and other numerical results and verified the models by experiments. The results show that vibrationally excited species and radicals play important roles in reducing the reaction energy barrier on the catalyst surface. These findings suggest quite different reaction mechanisms from common thermal catalysis. To realize industrial applications, researchers have carried out techno-economic analysis of the technology.46 Plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis potentially has a higher energy efficiency, and with the continuously rising fossil-derived energy prices, the development of renewable energy, and the advancement of the technology itself, the technology will become more competitive in the near future.
4.2 Technological maturity
We have split the above-discussed three plasma-enabled routes according to the technological maturity as shown in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5 we can see that the maturity of the technology follows the order: route III (N2 → NOx → NH3) > route I (N2 → NH3) > route II (N2 → NOx + NH3). Plasma oxidation to generate NOx combined with electrocatalytic reaction is relatively more mature. Consider either the plasma oxidation to nitrogen fixation or electrocatalytic reduction to ammonia synthesis, these are more mature technologies than the other two routes. Route I (N2 → NH3) has a relatively mature experimental system in both reactor design and catalyst optimization, and DBD reactors and transition metal catalysts are commonly used. With the application of in situ diagnostic technologies, the reaction mechanisms and pathways can be more clearly understood. However, the biggest problem is that energy efficiency and yield cannot be balanced, and there is still a long way to go toward large-scale industrial applications. The research following route II (N2 → NOx + NH3) is not as advanced as the other two routes, and the reaction products are diverse. For industrial translation, viable application scenarios are required.
 Fig. 5  Technological maturity of the plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis approaches. 
4.3 Process control and diagnostics
Diagnostic methods are necessary to verify the pathways and mechanisms of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. In the NTP, diagnostic techniques can provide parameters such as the electron density, electron temperature, vibrational temperature, and rotational temperature. The studies of mechanisms are focused on the surface catalytic reactions in the presence of the plasma while using advanced in situ diagnostics can reveal the intermediate products of the reactions. The in situ coupling of the plasma with catalysts is a popular approach in the hydrogenation reactions, such as nitrogen reduction and carbon dioxide reduction. Zhao et al.47 used a coaxial DBD plasma reactor and identified gas-phase NNH and N2H2 species using molecular-beam mass spectrometry in the plasma-assisted catalysis for NH3 synthesis at 533 K and atmospheric pressure. Winter et al.48 identified the reaction intermediates adsorbed on γ-Al2O3-supported Ni and Fe catalysts during plasma-activated ammonia synthesis using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) under various temperatures and reactor configurations. Zhang et al.49 revealed the free-radical chain reactions (i.e., O + N2(ν) → NO + N and N + O2(ν) → NO + O) in the nanosecond pulsed air spark discharge using time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy and provided new insights into the opportunities for sustainable and decentralized NOx production. Wang et al.6 used in situ FTIR and XPS for investigation of the hydrogenation of the adsorbed N2. The results showed that *NHx species on the catalyst are the major intermediates in the reaction. The in situ diagnostics provide evidence for the existence and evolution of intermediate species on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase of the plasma discharge. This approach aids better understanding of the surface reaction mechanisms of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis.
4.4 Mechanisms of plasma-catalysis
The mechanisms of plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis are still unclear, but many researchers have explored them and significant progress has been made. A combination of experiments, simulations, and theoretical calculations is the way of revealing the mechanisms. This approach enables a complete argument for a specific problem but lacks a unified framework. Mehta et al.37 elaborated that vibrational excitations in N2 decrease the dissociation barriers of the ammonia synthesis reaction by coupling catalysts with NTP. With a DFT-based microkinetic model, the rate of ammonia synthesis, enhancements, and the most suitable catalyst can be predicted. Their result showed that the optimal catalyst is the one that binds nitrogen more weakly, which has a different trend from thermal catalysis. The adsorbed species on the surface of the catalyst in the plasma-catalysis follow a different process from that in the common thermal catalysis. Hong et al.50 established a plasma kinetics model including excited N2(X, ν) and H2(X, ν) species and surface species. The influence of radicals and vibrationally-excited molecules are more important than ions. And different from traditional reactions, surface-adsorbed atomic N (s) and H (s) are generated from the dissociative adsorption of molecules. H (s) takes a leading role in the formation of NH3. Furthermore, the voltage, temperature, and the ratio of N2:H2 influence the ammonia synthesis. Hong et al.51 summarized the mechanisms of ammonia synthesis by plasma-catalysis. Vibrationally excited N2, ions, atomic hydrogen, and high-energy electrons play important roles in the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. Based on the ozone generator, a possible configuration for large-scale ammonia production was designed. Vibrationally-excited species exist in large numbers in the gas phase and have a long relaxation time; these species can effectively cross the plasma sheath to act on the catalyst surface. Vibrationally-excited species and free radicals can be regulated by adjusting the plasma parameters. The composition of the catalyst and its supporting material also affect the intermediates and the reaction paths. Engelmann et al.52 reported the ammonia synthesis process under the different plasma and transition metal catalysts conditions. The influence of radicals and vibrationally-excited N2 generated by DBD plasma on the NH3 turnover frequencies (TOFs) was explored. Through analysing different transition metals, such as Rh, Ni, Pt, and Pd, it is found that NH3 formation depends on vibrationally-excited N2. The reason why the high concentration of the radicals can reduce the dependency on the catalyst material is that the Eley–Rideal and radical adsorption mechanisms modulate the interactions between the catalysts and the species involved in the reaction. Therefore, the vibrationally-excited-state species and the evolution of free radicals on the catalyst surface are among the most important factors affecting the plasma-catalytic mechanisms. Effective control of the generation of vibrationally-excited-state species and radicals by the plasma parameters and the optimum design of the catalyst is crucial for the success of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. Furthermore, machine learning will facilitate the studies of the plasma ammonia synthesis mechanisms and reaction conditions. Pan et al.53 introduced the plasma/plasma-catalysis modeling into deep neural networks. Zeng et al.54 used machine learning methods combined with experimental data to obtain experimental conditions with the highest yield and energy efficiency and confirmed the importance of vibrationally-excited species for ammonia synthesis by using spectral diagnostic methods and reaction kinetics models. The machine learning methods combined with the in situ optical diagnosis and the kinetic models can effectively predict and verify the experimental process conditions, especially where intermediate reaction steps play an important role. Therefore, a combination of experiments, simulation, and machine learning can more comprehensively explain the mechanisms of the plasma ammonia synthesis from macro- and microscopic perspectives.
4.5 Techno-economics
Techno-economic analysis is very important to consider during the translation to industry-scale and energy-efficient processes. The choice of application scenarios determines the economics of the plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis. It is known that the Haber–Bosch method is a mature solution for centralized large-scale ammonia production. If the NTP technology needs to be more economical, there are two ways it can achieve this: one is to find suitable application scenarios, and the other is to change the economics of the plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis technology. Valera-Medina et al.55 reported that ammonia synthesis can be improved economically by using innovative all-electric systems driven by renewable energy. They consider the use of ammonia as a fuel and chemical precursor and evaluate the economic variables affecting green NH3 production. One of the variables is the possibility of offshore NH3 production, and this approach leads to an estimated cost of 1556–1670 $ per ton. Osorio-Tejada et al.56 reported that 2.2 mol% NH3 yield and 1.1 g NH3 kW−1 h−1 can be obtained at 302 °C, which is far from the present-day industry expectations. It was also mentioned that the plasma-catalytic method can be competitive if the cost of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis falls below 452 $ per ton NH3. Winter and Chen46 compared the energy efficiency, CO2 emission, and economic competitiveness of the plasma-activated technology with the Haber–Bosch process. Compared with the traditional ammonia synthesis method, the plasma method coupled with the electrocatalytic or dry methane reforming hydrogen production has a lower theoretical energy consumption. They concluded that when the energy efficiency is improved by a factor of six, the plasma-assisted technology may become competitive with traditional methods. Although the energy efficiency of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis is still less than the 100 g NH3 kW−1 h−1 required by industry, its potential will be increased with the decrease of the price of renewable energy and the improvement of the plasma and catalyst matching. In addition, plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis is competitively energy efficient and can be used to develop a renewable, decentralized, and electrified ammonia synthesis processes.
5. Summary and outlook
Power-to-chemicals has a broad vision to produce chemicals directly with green electricity, using emerging technologies (i.e., plasma-catalysis, electro-catalysis, photo-catalysis, and their hybrids). A large number of experimental results show impressive advances in the plasma-enabled technology in energy conversion.57 However, the plasma-enabled processes rely on complex physical and chemical reactions (electron collisions, vibrationally-excited states, free radical reactions, heterogeneous catalysis, etc.), involve multiple physical and chemical processes (electric field, light, thermal, fluid, etc.), and span ultra-broad spatial and temporal scales (fs → s and Å → mm, respectively), which make multidisciplinary research of the plasma-catalytic systems challenging.58 Here we have examined three promising routes towards commercial applications of plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis and ranked them according to their technological maturity: route III (N2 → NOx → NH3) > route I (N2 → NH3) > route II (N2 → NOx + NH3).
From the aspect of advanced in situ diagnostics, reaction mechanisms, and techno-economics, plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis technology has recently made major progress. Advanced in situ diagnostics confirmed the presence of free radicals and surface-adsorbed species in the reaction, providing valuable data for revealing the plasma-catalytic mechanisms. The mechanisms of the vibrationally-excited state reducing the reaction energy barrier on the catalyst surface and the effects of free radicals on the catalyst surface provide an important theoretical basis for control of the plasma and catalyst parameters. From the techno-economic perspective, plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis technology may achieve competitive energy consumption with common processes. With the rising price of fossil fuels and the development of renewable energy, the development of plasma-enabled ammonia synthesis technology is thus highly promising. Fortunately, more and more researchers from diverse fields including chemistry, physics, electrical and chemical engineering, agriculture, biology, etc. have engaged in the development and industrial translation of plasma-catalytic technology. Research combining plasma physics, atomistic theory, fluid mechanics, and heterogeneous catalysis with the gas discharge and process engineering will accelerate the practical utilization of the plasma-catalytic technology in the future.
