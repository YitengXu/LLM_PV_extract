    , Accepted 6th September 2021First published on 7th September 2021AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown advantages of high efficiency, solution production, and flexibility, and have become a potential candidate for next-generation photovoltaic technologies. For PSCs in p–i–n configuration, inorganic p-type semiconductors are competitive as hole transport layers (HTLs) due to their low-cost, chemical stability, high transparency, and solution processability. Herein, solution-processed, ternary metal oxide NiCrO3 films were reported as HTLs in PSCs. Compared with the most prevalent NiOx HTLs, the uniform and pin-hole free NiCrO3 HTLs delivered higher electrical conductivity and a deeper valence band, enabling improved hole transport and interfacial band alignment. The NiCrO3 HTLs also present accelerated charge extraction and slow charge recombination as observed by transient spectroscopy studies. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.93% was achieved, which is much higher than that of a NiOx based device (18.35%). This work demonstrated the potential of NiCrO3 as an effective HTL in PSCs, and may promote the development of ternary metal oxides as new building blocks for high performance PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising technology for next-generation photovoltaics with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25%.1–6 Excellent performance can be realized in both n–i–p and p–i–n device configurations, while the p–i–n structure, i.e., the inverted one, is normally free of dopants in transport layers and rarely suffers from controversial hysteresis issues.7–9 Charge transport layers (CTLs) can be divided into two types: hole transport layers (HTLs) and electron transport layers (ETLs). Efficient charge collection and transport of these two layers can promote ideal electrical behavior of PSCs with high performance.10–13 For HTLs, various organic materials have been applied, including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS),14,15 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD),16 poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT),17 and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA).18,19 However, they are either costly or chemically unstable for further commercialization.
Inorganic metal oxides can serve as promising alternative materials due to their low cost, chemical stability, high transparency, and solution processability. Binary metal oxides (BMOs) such as NiOx,20,21 CuOx,22,23 MoOx,24,25 V2O5,26 WOx,27 and CoOx (ref. 28) have been developed with different features as efficient HTLs. Among them, NiOx is particularly employed since it has a deep-lying valence band (VB) with a wide band gap to match well with that of perovskite materials. Combined with structural modulation via doping (by Li,29,30 Cu,31,32 Mg,33 Co,34 Cs,35etc.) and interface engineering (by diethanolamine,36 alkali chlorides,37 organic molecules,38etc.), high PCEs over 20% have been reported. However, the intrinsic low conductivities and deep conduction bands limit the performance of BMOs.39 Recently, ternary metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted lots of attention because of their unique features such as high conductivity, and tunable optical and electrical properties. Ternary inorganic CuGaO2 nanoplates have been prepared by using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, and PSCs based on such HTLs have achieved a PCE of 18.51%.40 In another work, CuCrO2 nanocrystals were synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction, which could enhance not only the photostability (UV-blocking underlayer) but also PCE of inverted PSCs up to 19.0% as HTLs.41 Furthermore, several strategies such as employing coordination compounds,42 hypocrystalline intermediates,43 and tartaric acid fuel44 have been developed to assistant the preparation of well-dispersed, ultrasmall NiCo2O4 nanoparticles. These TMOs generally show wide tunability of composition and electrical properties. However, TMO based HTLs have still met with limited success because of the shortage of available materials.
In this work, we report a solution-processed nickel–chromium ternary oxide as an efficient HTL in p–i–n planar PSCs. It was found that the relatively high Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio in the NiCrO3 HTL promises its good conductivity, while an appropriate low-lying valence band of 5.38 eV matches the valence band of the perovskite well. The improved hole extraction as well as reduced carrier recombination of the NiCrO3 HTL guaranteed that PSCs will reach a maximum PCE of 19.93% with an average PCE over 19%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of NiCrO3 as an excellent HTL for perovskite photovoltaics.
Experimental section
Materials
Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%), methylamine (MA, 33 wt% in absolute ethanol), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in aqueous solution), nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 99.9%), chromium(III) chloride hexahydrate (CrCl3·6H2O, 96%), citric acid monohydrate (HOC(COOH)(CH2COOH)2·H2O, ≥ 99.0%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, ≥99.9%), isopropanol (IPA, anhydrous, 99.5%)and chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, 99.5%) and bathocuproine (BCP, 99%) were purchased from Nichem chemicals. Ethanol (anhydrous, 99.7%) was purchased from Shanghai LingFeng chemical reagent Co. Ltd. All materials and solvents were used as received without further purification.
Preparation of NiCrO3, NiOx, and CrOx precursor solution
237.71 mg NiCl2·6H2O and 266.44 mg CrCl3·6H2O were dissolved in 5 mL DMF solution containing 420.28 mg HOC(COOH) (CH2COOH)2·H2O. After stirring overnight at room temperature, a clear, dark green NiCrO3 solution was obtained. NiOx and CrOx solutions were prepared by dissolving NiCl2·6H2O and CrCl3·6H2O in DMF with the same metal cation concentration, respectively.
Synthesis of methylammonium iodide (MAI)
MAI was synthesized by the reaction between methylamine and hydriodic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio. The reaction was performed in an ice bath under stirring for 2 h, and the solvent was then evaporated by using rotary evaporation at 55 °C for 1 h. The collected yellowish-white precipitate was washed with diethyl ether three times, followed by recrystallization with ethanol and diethyl ether to obtain a white powder. The resulting pure MAI power was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.
Device fabrication
The device has inverted planar architecture with a p–i–n structure. The FTO-coated glass substrate was first sequentially washed with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and ethanol under ultrasonication, and then treated by UV-ozone for 25 min just before the HTL deposition. The as-prepared NiCrO3, NiOx, or CrOx precursor was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 5 min, and 500 °C for 60 min. The substrate was then transferred into a glovebox for a two-step perovskite film deposition; The 1.3 M PbI2 solution in DMF:DMSO (7:3) was first spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The MAI solution (60 mg mL−1 in IPA) was then spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Afterward, the as-coated perovskite film was placed on the hotplate with a temperature of 115 °C for 10 min. After cooling down to room temperature, PC61BM (20 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) and BCP (0.5 mg mL−1 in ethanol) were spin-coated at 2000 rpm and 4000 rpm for 45 s, respectively, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 15 min. Finally, the Ag electrode was deposited through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation for ∼100 nm while the effective illumination area of the device was determined to be 0.0625 cm2.
Characterization and measurements
The surface morphologies of the HTL and perovskite films were determined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S4800). The crystallographic information was obtained by using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker Advance D8) with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV. The elemental composition data were obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI5300) with a monochromated Mg anode at 14 kV, 250 W. The absorption and transmittance spectra were recorded using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis, Cary 500UV-vis-NIR). The work functions of the NiCrO3 thin film were probed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements were performed at room temperature using a Fluorolog-3-p spectrophotometer. The solar cells were illuminated by a solar light simulator (Solar IV-150 A, Zolix) under AM 1.5 irradiation (at 100 mW cm−2) and the light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a standard Newport calibrated KG5-filtered Si reference cell. All electrical characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 with 0.15 V s−1 scan rate. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined on a Newport-74125 system. The steady-state PCE was measured by monitoring the current with the largest power output bias voltage and recording the value of the photocurrent. The steady-state photocurrent output of the best-performing devices was measured by biasing the device at a maximum power point for 400 s. The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Parstat 2273, Princeton) between 100 Hz and 105 Hz under 0.8 V under dark conditions. Transient photovoltage decay measurements were carried under 1 sun illumination. An attenuated UV laser pulse (SRS NL 100 Nitrogen Laser) was used as a small perturbation to the background illumination on the device. The laser-pulse-induced photovoltage variation and VOC were produced by the background illumination. The wavelength of the N2 laser was 337 nm, the repeating frequency was about 10 Hz, and the pulse width was less than 3.5 ns. Time-resolved X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were performed at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF).
Results and discussion
Structural characterization of the NiCrO3 film
The crystalline structure of NiCrO3 shown in Fig. 1a exhibits hexagonal lattice constants a = 4.93 Å and c = 13.50 Å with the space group Rc (No. 167).45 This material has been theoretically predicted as a semiconductor at atmospheric pressure.46 In this work, the NiCrO3 film was prepared by spin-coating NiCl2·6H2O and CrCl3·6H2O solution with citric acid monohydrate as an additive, followed by a post-annealing procedure (see details in the Experimental section). To explore the structure of the NiCrO3 film, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was operated and the results are presented in Fig. 1b. All the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the crystal structure of the trigonally distorted NiCrO3 (JCPDS no. 22-0748). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the NiCrO3 film shown in Fig. 1c reveals a uniform and smooth surface morphology without pinholes and cracks, suggesting its good film quality comparable to the reference NiOx film (Fig. S1†). High optical transparency in the UV-visible range from 300 to 850 nm was observed for both NiCrO3 and NiOx films (Fig. S2†). Such high transmittance maximizes the light absorption for the latter coated perovskite layer for photocurrent generation. Furthermore, dark current–voltage (J–V) curves with a structure of FTO/HTL/Au in Fig. 1d describe the higher current under electrical bias and thus better conductivity of the NiCrO3 film than the NiOx film.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was then conducted to further probe the chemical composition and electronic states of the NiCrO3 film. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, three peaks can be observed in Ni 2p3/2 spectra, in which two centered at 853.2 eV and 855.1 eV correspond to be divalent and trivalent Ni species, respectively.47,48 A much higher Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio was identified in the NiCrO3 film (6.79) than in the reference one (0.94). It has been known that the Ni3+ sites may introduce shallow acceptor levels in NiOx. The oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ may lead to the occurrence of specific sites that can introduce more charge carries.49 The higher valence state of metal elements would enhance the stoichiometric ratio of oxygen, and may form nickel vacancy (VNi) sites. It could increase the conductivities of NiOx samples since VNi may introduce shallow acceptor levels in NiOx for extra hole conduction. Therefore, we infer that a relatively high Ni3+ ratio in the NiCrO3 film may be beneficial for p-type conductivity and be responsible for the high electrical conductivity in the J–V measurements (Fig. 1d).35,48 The Cr 2p1/2 spectra reveal two electronic states for both NiCrO3 and CrOx films at binding energies of 587.3 eV (Cr3+) and 585.5 eV (Cr4+) with the Cr4+/Cr3+ fitted ratios of 0.55 and 1.14, respectively.50Fig. 2c shows the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of NiOx, NiCrO3, and Ni reference foil. Both the Ni absorption edge positions of the NiCrO3 sample are consistent with those of the NiOx sample but slightly shifted toward a higher absorption energy, suggesting a higher valence state than Ni2+ same as the XPS result. Moreover, the edge steps of both samples are much higher than that of Ni reference foil. The corresponding Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis in Fig. 2d further confirmed the presence of Ni–Ni and Ni–O bonds, and the absence of metallic Ni–Ni bonds in the NiCrO3 sample, in agreement with the XRD and XPS results.

Performance of the NiCrO3 HTL based solar cell
Solar cells were fabricated with the p–i–n configuration of FTO/HTL/MAPbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag as depicted in Fig. 3a. Fig. S3† exhibits the top-view SEM image of the MAPbI3 films deposited on these two HTLs. Similar morphologies of compact, uniform, fully covered perovskite films can be observed onto both HTLs without pin-holes and cracks. Both perovskite films can harvest a wide range of UV and visible light up to 780 nm (Fig. S4†). Fig. 3b presents the performance of the two HTL based PSCs in terms of the J–V characteristics, while their photovoltaic parameters including the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE in both scan directions are summarized in Table 1. Compared to the reference PSC coated on the NiOx HTL, the PCE of the NiCrO3 HTL based PSC increases from 18.35% to 19.93% with negligible hysteresis, which mainly can be attributed to the higher JSC (from 22.19 to 23.07 mA cm−2) and FF (from 76.90% to 78.30%). Furthermore, an improvement in the device reproducibility can be seen in Fig. 3c; the average PCEs are ∼19.16% and ∼17.32% for NiCrO3 HTL and NiOx HTL based devices, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the CrOx based PSC has a PCE of only 9.57% (Fig. S5†).

External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements in Fig. 3d demonstrate that the NiCrO3 HTL based device has higher photoresponse capability over a broad wavelength from 280 to 830 nm than reference ones. The integrated JSC values calculated from the EQE spectra are 22.31 and 21.34 mA cm−2 for NiCrO3 and NiOx HTL-based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the J–V results. Moreover, the steady-state power output (i.e., stabilized PCE) and JSC were measured at the maximum power point (MPP) voltage for 400 s (Fig. 3e and f). The stabilized PCE and JSC are 19.69% and 21.40 mA cm−2 for the NiCrO3 HTL based device, higher than 18.04% and 20.74 mA cm−2 for the NiOx HTL based device. Furthermore, devices based on the NiCrO3 HTL present slightly improvement in stability (Fig. S6†). PSCs with the NiCrO3 HTL without encapsulation maintain 99.4%, 82.4%, and 79.6% of their initial PCEs after 150 h exposure to an ambient environment, 85 °C heating, and AM 1.5G light illumination, respectively. However the PCEs of NiOx HTL based devices decreased to 98.3%, 79.5%, and 76.2% of their initial values under the same conditions. All the above measurements verify the improved device performances that result from the NiCrO3 HTL.
Charge carrier kinetics
To disclose the origin of the performance enhancement by the NiCrO3 HTL, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out to detect the HTL's energy levels. UPS spectra in Fig. 4 determined the valence band position of NiCrO3 to be at 5.38 eV, which is a downward shift of ∼0.17 eV compared to NiOx (5.21 eV).21 As illustrated in the energy band diagram of PSC (Fig. 4a), the deeper VB of the NiCrO3 HTL minimizes the energy barrier between the HTL and MAPbI3 to ∼0.2 eV. Theoretical calculations by Minemoto et al. have suggested that such an appropriate band offset can ensure complete depletion of MAPbI3 as well as controlled interface recombination.51
 Fig. 4  (a) Energy level diagram of inverted PSCs based on NiCrO3 and NiOx HTLs. (b) UPS (He I) spectra in the onset (Ei) and cut-off (Ecut-off) energy of NiCrO3. The valence band maximum (VBM) is calculated using the equation: VBM = 21.21 eV − (Ecut-off − Ei). 
Transient photocurrent (TPC) decay measurements can characterize the charge extraction and transfer process of PSCs under short-circuit conditions. As shown by TPC decay curves in Fig. 5a, the photocurrent decay lifetimes of devices are fitted to be 0.06 μs and 0.56 μs for NiCrO3 and NiOx HTL based PSCs, respectively. The shorter TPC lifetime is the sign of improved charge extraction and transfer in the device with the NiCrO3 HTL, leading to higher JSC and FF values.33 The devices' carrier lifetime under operation conditions was further assessed by transient photovoltage (TPV) decay measured at the open circuit voltage (Fig. 5b). The charge-recombination lifetimes (τr), which could be extracted from TPV decay curves, are 0.42 μs and 0.09 μs for PSCs based on NiCrO3 and NiOx HTLs, respectively.52 The longer τr indicates a lower charge carrier recombination velocity in the NiCrO3 device, suggestive of reduced trap density at the HTL/perovskite interface.
 Fig. 5  (a) TPC and (b) TPV decay curves of PSCs based on NiOx and NiCrO3 HTLs. (c) TRPL spectra for perovskite films with different HTLs deposited on glass substrates. The TRPL profiles show that the NiCrO3 HTL coated perovskite has the highest PL decay rate. (d) Nyquist plots of PSCs with different HTLs recorded at 0.8 V under dark conditions. The inset shows the equivalent circuit model for EIS spectra. 
In addition, VOC as a function of different light intensities is shown in Fig. S7.† The deviation between the slope and the value of kBT/q (where kB, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, room temperature, and elementary charge, respectively) can reflect the trap-assisted recombination and is referred to as ideality factor n. The values of n are 1.22 and 1.50 for devices with NiCrO3 and NiOx HTLs. The lower slope implies the suppressed Shockley–Read–Hall trap-assisted recombination and reduced trap states density in the NiCrO3 HTL based PSC.53 The charge extraction and transport kinetics of the perovskite layer were acquired by fitting time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves with a bi-exponential decay equation:ITRPL(t) = A1exp(−t1/τ1) + A2exp(−t2/τ2)where τ1 and τ2 are the fast decay and slow decay component, and A1 and A2 are the time-independent coefficients of the amplitude fraction for each decay component (Fig. 5c). The decays originated from either the quenching of charge carriers, i.e., charge extraction, or recombination losses. According to timescales, fast decay τ1 herein should be attributed to the charge extraction by HTLs, while slow decay τ2 is mainly associated with recombination losses.54 Compared to the reference perovskite film on the glass substrate (τ1 = 19.6 ns), the fast decay component reduced when the perovskite film was deposited onto the NiOx HTL (τ1 = 13.6 ns), and then further dropped when the HTL was replaced by NiCrO3 (τ1 = 11.2 ns). This result signifies an efficient hole extraction of NiCrO3 HTL based PSCs, which may contribute to the higher FF. Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to identify the recombination behavior in PSCs. Compared to the reference device, the NiCrO3 HTL based PSC possesses larger resistance for interfacial charge recombination, referring to lower carrier recombination (Fig. 5d).55 The recombination resistance (Rrec) values can be obtained by fitting the EIS spectra with the equivalent circuit model, which are 5530.4 and 2154.2 Ω for the NiCrO3 HTL based and reference PSCs, respectively.5 The ∼2.5-fold higher Rrec further indicates the longer carrier lifetime of the NiCrO3 HTL based device. All these above results verify the advantages of using NiCrO3 as the HTL to improve the charge carrier behavior for yielding a PCE as high as 19.93%. As summarized in Table S1,† the performance of NiCrO3 based devices is quite impressive when compared with those of devices based on other ternary inorganic HTLs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple, solution-processed NiCrO3 ternary inorganic film and employed it as a HTL for p–i–n inverted planar PSCs. The compact, uniform HTL film enables the growth of high quality perovskite on it. Owing to its well-matched energy level as well as enhanced conductivity resulting from a higher Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio, high PCEs over 19% with a maximum of 19.93% were achieved, surpassing the PCE (∼17%) of NiOx HTL based devices. Experimental characterization studies have corroborated the reduced recombination rate, enhanced hole extraction, and optimized band alignment of NiCrO3 HTLs. This finding underscores the significance of searching for novel inorganic charge transport materials, especially ternary metal oxide systems, and offers low-cost and efficient alternative interface materials for perovskite opto-electronic devices.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Crystal structure of ternary inorganic NiCrO3. (b) XRD pattern and (c) top-view SEM image of the NiCrO3 film. (d) J–V characteristics of MIM devices based on NiOx and NiCrO3 films. The conductivities were measured under the structure of Au/HTL/FTO as shown in the inset.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) High-resolution XPS spectra of the (a) Ni 2p and (b) Cr 2p core level of the NiCrO3 sample with reference samples of NiOx and CrOx, respectively. The Ni3+/Ni2+ ratios are 6.79 and 0.94 for NiCrO3 and NiOx films. (c) Ni K-edge EXAFS of Ni reference foil, NiOx, and NiCrO3 samples, and (b) their corresponding Fourier transforms. Ni–O and Ni–Ni bonds are highlighted by dotted lines.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Schematic of device architecture for inverted planar PSCs. (b) J–V characteristics of champion PSCs with NiOx and NiCrO3 HTLs, respectively. Devices were measured under AM 1.5G one sun illumination with a scan rate of 0.15 V s−1 in both directions. (c) Statistical PCEs obtained from 10 devices fabricated in different batches. (d) EQE spectra and integrated JSC curves of champion PSCs. The corresponding stabilized JSC and PCE of (e) NiCrO3 and (f) NiOx HTL based PSCs measured at the maximum power point voltage for 400 s.	 

NiOx	Reverse	1.075	22.19	76.90	18.35
Forward	1.071	22.10	76.00	17.99
NiCrO3	Reverse	1.104	23.07	78.30	19.93
