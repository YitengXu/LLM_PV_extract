, Accepted 18th August 2016First published on 22nd August 2016AbstractA nickel oxide (NiO) thin film with better reversibility, high optical modulation, and enhanced coloration efficiency with fast switching time was prepared using radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering technique. A cubic phase and spherical shaped crystal grain morphology of the NiO film have been determined from structural and surface morphological studies. A micro-Raman study showed two bands around 570 cm−1 and 1100 cm−1 corresponding to the vibrations of Ni–O. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study confirmed the compositional purity and the presence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions in the film. In addition, the observed transmission threshold at about 368 nm revealed the presence of Ni vacancies or the presence of Ni3+ ions along with Ni2+ ions in the deposited film. The photoluminescence peak located at 368 nm in the UV region is attributed to band-edge emission, which may be due to the transition of Ni2+ ions from the top of the 3d8 valence band to the bottom of the 3d8 conduction band. The electrochromic studies reveal an excellent performance with a highest coloration efficiency of 235 cm2 C−1, reversibility of 64%, optical modulation of 58%, coloration time of 1.2 s and bleaching time of 1.1 s. An electrochemical impedance measurement indicates fast lithium ion transfer with fast switching time, which facilitates the improved electrochromic behavior.
1. Introduction
Electrochromic (EC) materials have a persistent reversible color change upon an electron-transfer (redox) process or by a sufficient electrochemical potential.1 Organic polymers like viologens and inorganic metal oxides like tungsten oxide (WO3) and nickel oxide (NiO) are the two types of dominant electrochromic active materials used in electrochromic devices (ECDs).2 Among the EC materials, metal oxides have received tremendous attention, due to their higher coloration efficiency (CE), better cyclic and environmental stability, stability against sunlight exposure and ease of fabrication using conventional sputtering techniques.3–6 Electrochromic metal oxides encompass wide range of applications in energy efficient smart windows,7 electronic paper, automobile rear-view mirrors, and non-emissive display devices, etc.3 Development was more successful in the case of automatically dimming electrochromic rear-view mirrors, which are now generally available for cars and trucks.8 Among these applications, smart window, which provide indoor comfort by regulating the solar heat by reversible color change, has become more and more significant for this era due to global warming and energy crisis. The energy saving implied in a smart window is same as the electrical energy generated by a solar cell module of the same size placed in the same position.9
In a practical electrochromic device, WO3 is being used as an active electrochromic layer which changes color upon charge intercalation (cathodic material), and this WO3 film has to be complemented with anodic coloring materials like NiO, iridium oxide, etc. Among the other anodic metal oxides, NiO has been studied as a complementary electrode since 1980s, owing to its high EC efficiency, large dynamic range, good cyclic reversibility, and low material cost, which provides good compatibility for large scale applications.10,11 NiO is a p-type semiconductor (hole-type conductivity) with cation vacancies, electrically compensated by electronic holes, as the primary defects which leads to the formation of Ni3+ states, having a wide band gap of 3.6–3.8 eV.12
It may be stated that the electrochromic device changes color upon charge (ion) intercalation/de-intercalation. The normally preferred ions for the intercalation process are proton (H+) and lithium (Li+) owing to their smaller size and higher mobility/easy intercalation. Proton based electrolytes have higher ionic conductivity while, lithium-based electrolytes provide higher stability in a larger electrochemical active window and limited film dissolution partially linked to the absence of water or H2 and/or O2 formation.13 Poor stability in potassium hydroxide (KOH) (aqueous) electrolyte has been reported owing to the spontaneous conversion between different Ni oxide phases, together with a self-discharge phenomenon.14,15 In addition, NiO-based materials have poor cycling stability in acidic electrolytes too.14,16 Lots of reports are available in the electrochromic properties of NiO films studied by using aqueous electrolyte (mainly KOH) solution. However, reports on Li based electrolytes are scarce. Also the insertion/extraction kinetics of Li+ ions in NiO thin films are faster than that of OH− (KOH electrolyte) ions due to its smaller size.17 Green et al.18 and Dalavi et al.19 have reported that the CE of NiO thin films was found to be twice in lithium perchlorate in propylene carbonate (LiClO4–PC) electrolyte when compared to KOH electrolyte. For large-area commercial window applications, a Li-based system appears to be more promising for near term application. It was reported that the lithium ion is much easier to keep contained within the device when compared to proton.20 Hence in order to avoid the impending risk of degradation of NiO film in aqueous solutions, LiClO4–PC electrolyte was used in the present work to study the electrochromic behavior of NiO film. Chiang et al.21 reported a CE of 25.6 cm2 C−1 for NiO film prepared by fuel-assisted solution method upon OH− ion intercalation. Cai et al.22 obtained a CE value of 33.9 cm2 C−1 upon the intercalation of OH− ion in chemical bath deposited NiO thin film. Sialvi et al.23 reported the studies on aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposited NiO thin films with CE of 45 cm2 C−1 using KOH electrolyte. The CE of 107 cm2 C−1 was obtained for electrodeposited NiO thin film using KOH electrolyte.24 On the other hand, Wen et al.25 reported a CE of 44 cm2 C−1 for sputtered NiO film cycled in LiClO4–PC electrolyte. In addition, a CE of 78 cm2 C−1 was obtained for Li+ ion intercalated NiO film prepared by sputtering technique.26 Further, Dalavi et al.19 reported a CE of 95 cm2 C−1 for chemical bath deposited NiO film in LiClO4–PC electrolyte. It may be mentioned that the electrochromic performance of NiO film mainly depends on the structure, porosity, morphology, density and the possible content of oxygen in the films, influenced by the preparation conditions, and the availability of Li+ ion for migration to the film matrix. Hence by tuning the film properties under appropriate conditions, the electrochromic NiO film with high CE can be obtained.
Till now, many techniques have been adopted to deposit electrochromic NiO thin film, such as sputtering,25,26 chemical precipitation,27 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),28 sol–gel,29 chemical bath deposition30 and vacuum evaporation.31 Among these techniques, rf magnetron sputtering is the major industrial process due to its high deposition rate, high volume, and large area uniformity.
Herein, we report mainly on the electrochromic performance of NiO thin film prepared by rf magnetron sputtering technique using three electrode electrochemical setup. The possible mechanism for the change in coloration and bleaching process of NiO film has been discussed in detail. The results revealed that the prepared NiO film has larger transmittance modulation, higher CE, fast response time with acceptable reliability. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the charge transfer and transport properties of NiO film. Prior to the electrochemical measurements, the NiO film has been subjected to various characterization techniques to identify their structural, morphological, compositional and optical properties. A possible correlation among these studies was also discussed.
2. Experimental details
NiO thin films were prepared onto fluorine doped tin oxide coated (FTO or SnO2:F) glass substrate by rf magnetron sputtering (HINDHIVAC; Planar Magnetron RF/DC Sputtering Unit Model-12′′ MSPT) using NiO target (99.99% purity) of 5 cm diameter. The schematic representation of rf magnetron sputtering process is shown in Fig. 1. The sputtering process was carried out in the vacuum chamber. Initially, the chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 5 × 10−6 mbar. Then pure argon gas was introduced into the chamber to reduce the chamber pressure to 5 × 10−3 mbar. Since pure NiO is an insulator, the target material is biased with rf power to avoid charging over the target. On the application of rf power of 150 W, the injected argons atoms get ionized (Ar+) and hit the NiO target (cathode supplied with negative potential). These energetic primary Ar+ ions lose energy in a series of elastic and inelastic collisions with NiO target atoms. The recoiling target atoms give rise to secondary collisions in cascade. The energy of primary ions may eventually be transferred to the surface atoms which will be ejected if the surface binding energy is overcome. During this process, the secondary electrons are also emitted along with NiO atoms. These secondary electrons again recombine with the Ar+ ions by releasing photons. Here comes the vicinity of plasma. Some of these secondary electrons reach the substrate which may cause in-homogeneity in the NiO film along with substrate heating. In order to avoid film in-homogeneity and substrate heating and also to sustain the plasma density with increased ionization rate, magnetic field (B) parallel to the substrate and electric field perpendicular to B has been applied (magnetron sputtering). The secondary electrons in its field are trapped in cycloids and circulate over the NiO target surface, as shown in Fig. 1. The ejected NiO atoms cross the target – substrate distance of 6 cm and gets deposited over the substrate maintained at room temperature (RT) (anode supplied with positive potential).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of rf magnetron sputtering process. 
The thickness of the film was measured by stylus profilometer (Mitytoyo, SJ-301). The structural property of NiO thin film was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu-Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation source (X′ pert Pro PANalytical) over a 2θ scan range of 10–80°. The optical property of NiO film was studied using UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO; V-670) in the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm. The deuterium (25 W) and tungsten halogen (20 W) lamps were used as the light source and the spot size of measurement was 5 mm. The surface morphological property of the film was studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) (FEI QUANTA 250, Czech Republic) and atomic force microscopy (AFM; Nanoscope-E). The vibrational property of deposited film was studied by micro-Raman spectrometer (LABRAM HR-800) using 488 nm line of Ar+-ion laser with a power of 5 mW. Photoluminescence (PL) study was performed using varian cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The elemental composition of the deposited film was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS:JEOL PS-9010 TR). The electrochromic properties of films were studied using electrochemical workstation scanning potentistat/galvanostat (CH Instruments Inc., USA; Model: CHI604D). The XPS and AFM measurements were carried out on NiO film deposited on glass substrate and the rest of measurements were done on the film deposited on FTO substrate.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and surface morphological studies
The thickness of NiO thin film deposited on FTO substrate was found to be 0.9 μm. Prior to the electrochromic studies, the NiO film was subjected to XRD, FESEM, AFM, Raman, XPS, EDX, and PL measurements to identify its physical properties and to look for a possible correlation. Fig. 2a represents the XRD pattern of rf magnetron sputter deposited NiO thin film, which confirms the crystalline nature of NiO film. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 43.03°, 62.32° can be attributed to the respective (200) and (220) reflections of standard face-centered cubic NiO (JCPDS Card no. 89-7130). The signature of SnO2 was also observed in the XRD pattern. Various structural parameters like crystallite size, strain, dislocation density, and number of crystallites of NiO film were calculated from the XRD result. The average crystalline size (7 nm) was determined using the Scherrer's formula.32 The measured dislocation density, strain, and number of crystallites per unit area values in the present work are found to be 1.9 × 1016 lines m−2, 5.1 × 10−3 per lines2 per m4, and 24 × 1017 m−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with our previous report.33

The surface morphology of NiO thin film examined by FESEM is shown in Fig. 2b. The micrograph shows the agglomeration of spherically shaped particles with almost uniform size (60 nm). The identical morphological behavior was also observed in AFM image [Fig. 2c]. The root mean square surface roughness (Rrms) of the film was found to be 0.93 nm, which is less than the reported value indicating smooth surface of the film.34
The Raman spectrum of NiO thin film prepared on FTO substrate using 150 W – RT is shown in Fig. 2d. The Raman spectrum shows two peaks at 570 cm−1 and 1100 cm−1, which correspond to one-phonon longitudinal optic (LO) mode and two-phonon LO mode, respectively, due to the vibrations of Ni–O bonds. Duan et al.35 reported that the vibrational modes at 550–580 cm−1 and 1080–1140 cm−1 are correspond to one-phonon LO mode and two phonon LO mode of NiO, respectively. In addition, it was suggested that the first-order LO phonon scattering in NiO may be due to the nickel vacancy defects or due to the presence of Ni3+ ions.36,37 Further, the sharp and high intense Raman peak at 570 cm−1 indicating the presence of Ni3+ ion concentration along with Ni2+ ions, which is consistent with our observation in XPS measurement.
3.2. Compositional analysis
In order to determine the elemental composition of NiO film, we have performed the XPS and EDX measurements on the deposited film. In principle, the oxidation states of nickel in the surface region can be determined from the binding energies (BE) and their chemical shifts in XPS spectra. For nickel oxides the Ni-2p state contain multiple peaks at binding energies between about 852 and 870 eV, including the main peak and satellites.38–40 This may be due to the final state effects caused by the charge transfer from oxygen to nickel. The Ni-2p spectra are often complex and contain multiple peaks, and it is difficult to assign specific binding energies to the Ni2+ and Ni3+ states. Previous research has supported the assignment of BEs of 852.6, 854.6 and 856.1 eV to Ni-2p3/2 XPS spectra for Ni0, Ni2+and Ni3+, respectively.41–43 In addition, Liang et al.44 and Varghese et al.45 reported that Ni-2p3/2 states in NiO exhibit a double peak at BEs between 852 and 860 eV and Ni-2p1/2 states exhibit peaks located at 872.4 and 879.3 eV. Their interpretation differs in the literature, but stoichiometric crystalline NiO is characterized by a distinct Ni-2p3/2 double peak whose dominant feature lies at the lower binding energy.39 The reported binding energies for the dominant peaks were at 854.0 and 854.4 eV (ref. 39 and 46) and the secondary peak was at 856.1 eV.46 Non-stoichiometric NiO contain excess oxygen which creates Ni3+ states, and it is difficult to assign a single BE to the oxidation states, Ni2+ and Ni3+. The dominant Ni-2p3/2 peak for Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH phases has been found to lie between the two peaks of stoichiometric NiO. Grosvenor et al. assigned the centers of the Ni-2p3/2 peaks for NiOOH and Ni(OH)2 to 855.5 and 855.0 eV, respectively.39 For a perfect NiO crystal, the ratio between the lower BE peak (centered at 854.8 eV) and the higher BE peak (centered at 856.1 eV) is 4/3. Ni atoms in the 3+ valency (Ni3+) state give an XPS peak centered at 855.7 eV, i.e. between the two peaks of the NiO. The O-1s binding energy of NiOOH is 531.7 eV,47 while the corresponding energies are 529.6, 531.3 and 531.8 eV for NiO, Ni(OH)2 and Ni2O3, respectively.46 Fig. 3a shows the XPS survey scan spectrum of NiO thin film deposited on glass substrate at the 150 W – RT. The observed characteristic peaks corresponding to nickel (Ni) and oxygen (O) confirmed the compositional purity and quality of deposited NiO film in the present work. In addition, the core level spectrum of nickel (Ni) and oxygen (O) for the NiO thin film prepared at the similar condition are shown in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. In order to have better insight on the XPS data, the core level spectrum of Ni and O were deconvoluted using Gaussian fit. The observed strong peaks at 853.7 and 859.8 eV are corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 levels of NiO thin films. In addition, two peaks located at 871.8 and 878.2 eV are belonging to Ni 2p1/2 levels of NiO thin films. Further, the energy separation between Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 are found to be about 18.9 eV, which is consistent with earlier reports.44,45 A small peak at 855.7 eV appears overlapped with Ni2+ (peak at 853.7 eV), which revealed the presence of small amount of Ni3+ along with Ni2+. The characteristic core level peak of O-1s was found at about 529.51 eV as observed from the oxygen core level spectrum [Fig. 3c]. A small peak at about 531.13 eV related to Ni3+ was observed from the fitted core level spectrum of O-1s.3 The quantitative analysis of XPS result shows that the film contain 44.89% of Ni and 55.11% of O, which revealed the deposited NiO film in the present work are close to its stoichiometric formation within an estimation error. The compositional purity of deposited film was further confirmed by the EDX study as observed from the primary elements of Ni and O in the spectrum shown in Fig. 3d. The presence of Sn signal is due to the SnO2:F substrate.

3.3. Optical studies
Fig. 4a shows the optical transmittance spectrum of NiO film with an absorption edge at 368 nm. Pure cubic NiO is an insulator with high transparency. The average transmittance of 67% was observed for the film. Mendoza-Galvan et al.47 reported that the absorption in the wavelength longer than 400 nm was due to the presence of excess oxygen in the lattice, owing to the creation of Ni vacancies or the presence of Ni3+ ions along with Ni2+ ions in NiO films. This inference is consistent with our XPS measurement where we observe the excess oxygen in the film. In addition, the color of deposited film is brown which implied the presence of Ni vacancies or the presence of Ni3+ ions along with Ni2+ ions in the deposited film. One can also observe from the spectrum that film shows ripple patterns which might be due to the characteristic of interference between light and deposited materials. This interference nature of transmittance spectrum revealed the homogeneous nature of film on the substrate.
 Fig. 4  (a) Optical transmittance spectrum of NiO thin film, (b) optical energy band gap plot of NiO thin film, and (c) photoluminescence spectrum of NiO film. 
The optical band gap of NiO film was determined by applying the Tauc model,48 
αhν = A(hν − Eg)n
(1)where A is energy independent constant, Eg is the band gap corresponding to a particular transition occurring in the film, ν is transition frequency and the exponent n characterizes the nature of the band transition. For a crystalline semiconductor, n = 1/2, 2, 3/2, 3 values corresponding to the allowed direct, allowed indirect, forbidden direct, and forbidden indirect transitions, respectively. Since NiO is a direct band gap system, the relationship between (αhν)2 and hν is expected to show the linear behavior as shown in Fig. 4b. The Eg value was obtained by extrapolating the linear portion to the photon energy axis and is found to be 3.08 eV. This Eg value is in agreement with Hakim et al., who obtained the allowed direct band gap of 3.11 eV for the electron beam evaporated NiO thin films.49
Fig. 4c shows the room temperature PL spectrum recorded with an excitation wavelength of 270 nm. The spectrum consists of four dominant peaks at 368, 418, 459 and 485 nm. The peak located at 368 nm in the UV region is attributed to the band-edge emission due to the transition of Ni2+ ions from top of 3d8 valence band (VB) to the bottom of 3d8 conduction band.50 The emission peaks in the visible region having lower energies than UV emission peak. This may be due to the excitonic PL process in which the non-radiative transition of excited electrons from the bottom of conduction band to different sub-bands occur first and then the subsequent radiative transition from sub-band to the top of VB can take place.51 This excitonic PL emission is due to the vacancies, interstitial and defects present in the material. The violet emission peak at 418 nm is attributed to the band-edge free excitons.52 The blue emission peak at 459 nm may be due to the defects induced by nickel vacancies or excess oxygen. The green emission peak at 485 nm is ascribed to the bound excitons. It can be seen from Fig. 4c that the intensity of visible emission (defect level emission) peak is much higher than the UV emission peak which revealed the presence of nickel vacancies or excess oxygen present in the NiO thin film. This is in conformity with the presence of Ni3+ ions as observed from Raman and XPS studies.
3.4. Electrochemical analysis
In order to determine the electrochemical properties of NiO thin film deposited on FTO substrate, the cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronocoulometry (CC), chronoamperometry (CA), and impedance measurements were performed by constructing three electrode electrochemical cell consisting of working electrode (NiO film on FTO substrate), counter electrode (Pt mesh, area = 2 × 2 cm2), and reference electrode (Ag/AgCl). The measurements were done by intercalating/deintercalating Li+ ion using LiClO4–PC electrolyte solution. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of NiO thin film recorded at the scan rates of 25, 50, 100, 150 mV s−1 in 1 M LiClO4–PC electrolyte are shown in Fig. 5. CV has been done with a linear potential sweep between −1.4 to 2 V versus Ag/AgCl. The cathodic and anodic peaks observed at −0.99 V and +0.25 V are attributed to the redox reaction involving Ni2+/Ni3+ transformation. The oxidation and reduction peaks of their respective anodic and cathodic scans are not symmetric. This is due to the kinetic irreversibility of the redox process.53 The coloration and bleaching of the film is associated with the deintercalation and intercalation of Li+ ions. A simplified reduction scheme implying the gradual change in the optical density upon intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ ions in electrochromic NiO film is represented by the following equations as suggested by Passerini et al.,54 
NiOx + yLi+ + ye− → LiyNiOx

 Fig. 5  Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry curves of NiO thin film. 
In order to have better insight on the change in color of the film during intercalation/deintercalation process, herein we discuss about the coloration/bleaching mechanism with the help of band structure variation as shown schematically in Fig. 6a–d. During the cathodic potential scan from 2 to −1.4 V, the reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+ takes place. By the application of external electric field, both ions and electrons are move towards the electrochromic NiO layer (as shown in Fig. 6a) through LiClO4–PC electrolyte. Since the electrolyte is not electron conducting it forces the charge-balancing electrons to take an outer circuit and then move through the material to recombine with the ions. The electrons move faster through the electrochromic NiO and meet the ion at the surface and diffuse into the material, and therefore the electrochemical reaction perhaps takes place close to the surface. Intercalation of Li+ ions leads to the introduction of new localized energy states near the valence band (as shown in Fig. 6b). The donated electrons however occupy empty energy sites in the NiO material. If more and more electrons are intercalated it fills up the states one after another and moves the Fermi level upto higher energy level. Intercalation/deintercalation of charge modulates the position of the Fermi level and this transforms the material between transparent and colored. This change in Fermi level results the modulation of electrical conductivity and optical properties, which in turn causes bleaching of NiO film. During the anodic potential scan from −1.4 to 2 V, deintercalation/extraction of ions and electrons takes place (as shown in Fig. 6c) (accordingly the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ occurs). The Fermi level now moves down to the lower energy level causing the film colored (as shown in Fig. 6d).

It may be mentioned that the peak current is increased with the increase in scan rate (from 25 to 150 mV s−1) and the peak potential is slightly shifted towards the anodic side for anodic peak and cathodic potential side for cathodic peak as observed from Fig. 5. The linear increase in both anodic and cathodic peak potentials (Fig. 7a) with respect to scan rate indicates that the associated mechanism is diffusion controlled.55 In addition, the plot of anodic (ipa) and cathodic (ipc) peak current against the square root of scan rate (Fig. 7b) gives a straight line, which revealed the process is diffusion controlled redox process.56 The plots of logipa and logipc versus log scan rate (Fig. 7c and d) gave the slope values of 0.45 (for anodic) and 0.37 (for cathodic) which further confirmed the associated mechanism for the cyclic process is diffusion controlled. Hence, the diffusion coefficient of Li+ ion was calculated from the slope of the line shown in Fig. 7b using the Randles–Sevcik equation explained as follows:57,58 
ip = 2.69 × 105n3/2AD1/2Cν1/2
(4)where, ip = peak current which includes both ipc and ipa; n = number of electrons participating in the redox process which is normally 1; A = area of electrode; D = diffusion coefficient of Li+ ions; C = concentration of active ions in the electrolyte solution; ν = scan rate.

The calculated D values are summarized in Table 1. The anodic and cathodic diffusion coefficient values are 1.17 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 and 9.1 × 10−12 cm2 s−1, respectively. It may be mentioned that the D depends on the conductivity of diffusion ionic species, the nature of film (crystallinity, porosity, hydration etc.) and the electrolyte. The obtained D values are in agreement with the reported one.59 For instance, Purushothaman et al.59 have reported that the D values of nanostructured NiO film varied between 11 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 and 6.44 × 10−12 cm2 s−1.

CC gives quantitative information about the number of protons/ions intercalated or deintercalated by the application of a potential double step during a known amount of time.60 One of the main advantages of recording charge (Q) rather than current is that Q increases with time following a potential step, reaching a maximum at the end of the step, where the most meaningful data can be observed. In order to study the Li+ ion intercalation/deintercalation process with respect to time, chronocoulometry was carried out from −1.4 to 2 V versus Ag/AgCl in colored and bleached states for 5 s. Fig. 8a shows the CC spectrum of NiO film cycled in LiClO4–PC electrolyte solution, from which the amount of charge intercalated (Qi), amount of charge deintercalated (Qdi) and the residual charge (Qi − Qdi) have been calculated. The electrochromic reversibility of NiO thin film can be calculated using the following relation 
(5)
 Fig. 8  (a) Chronocoulometry curve of NiO film and (b) chronocoulometry curve of NiO film taken for 10 cycles. Inset shows the plot of Q versus t1/2. 
The amount of Qi is 4.32 mC cm−2, Qdi is 2.76 mC cm−2 and Qi − Qdi is 1.56 mC cm−2. For a better electrochromic device, CE should be high with better optical contrast upon small intercalated charge density.22 The observed Qi value in the present work is lower than the reported value.61 The amount of deintercalated ion differs from the intercalated one because some of the Li+ ions are trapped inside the sample even after reversing the cycle. The reversibility of the film is found to be 64%, which is higher than the reported value (57.9%) of NiO film cycled in LiClO4–PC electrolyte solution.62 In order to identify the stability of the film; the CC study was taken for 10 steps as shown in Fig. 8b. The negligible difference in charge intercalated and deintercalated process revealed the stability of NiO film. The D value can be calculated from the slope of Q vs. t1/2 plot (inset of Fig. 8b) using the following Cottrell equation,63 
Q = 2nFACD1/2π−1/2t1/2
(6)where n = number of electrons transferred per ion or molecule (eq. mol−1), F = Faraday's constant (96485 C equiv.−1), A = electrode surface area (cm2), C = concentration of LiClO4 (mol cm−3), D = diffusion coefficient of NiO (cm2 s−1), and t = time (s). The D value was found to be 4.19 × 10−12 cm2 s−1, which is in the order of D value evaluated from CV study.
It may be mentioned that the response time for the coloration (tc) and the bleaching (tb) is the time required for the anodic/cathodic current to achieve a steady state level after the application of voltages or the time required for a system to reach 90% of its full modulation. Shorter switching responses represent better performance in the electrochromic devices.23 During the CA experiment, the potential was stepped from its rest potential of 0 V to −1.4 V for 5 s and then reversed to +2 V for next 5 s as shown in Fig. 9a. The extracted tc (1.2 s) and tb (1.1 s) are lower than the reported values.19,21–23 These low values of tc and tb confirmed the easy insertion and de-insertion of Li+ ions into the electrochromic NiO layer. The slope of the current density is directly related to the speed of electrochromic reaction.64,65 The slope of the cathodic current density is little higher than that of the anodic current density, indicating that the bleaching process is faster than the coloring process. The higher insertion process rate results from the higher electronic conductivity of the oxide film in the charged state.66 As a result, the intercalation of Li+ ions during the bleaching process is easier than the deintercalation of Li+ ions during the coloring process. Fig. 9b shows the CA curve taken for 10 steps. There is no much change in the anodic and cathodic current density and slope value, which indicates the stability of NiO film.

The relationship between current and time is expressed by the following Cottrell equation by which the diffusion coefficient of NiO film can be evaluated from the slope of current vs. t−1/2 (as shown in inset of Fig. 9b)63 
i = nFACD1/2π−1/2t−1/2
(7)where i = current (A), F = Faraday's constant (C mol−1), A = area of the electrode (cm2), D = diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), C = concentration of analyte in the bulk solution (mol cm−3), t = time (s). The D value is calculated as 1.36 × 10−12 cm2 s−1, which is consistent with the diffusion coefficient values calculated from CV and CC studies.
The transmittance spectra of the sample (NiO film) in the colored and bleached states were recorded in the wavelength range of 300 nm to 1000 nm and are shown in Fig. 10. The change in optical density (ΔOD) of NiO thin film at 630 nm was calculated using the following relation,67 
(8)where Tb and Tc is the transmittance of the NiO film in its bleached and colored states, respectively. The optical modulation of NiO thin film was found to be 58% which is higher than the reported value.68 In addition, the photopic contrast ratio (PCR) is 2.6 (Tb/Tc). Further, the CE is a most important key parameter of an electrochromic material, which is defined as the change in optical density (ΔOD) per unit of injected charge density (Q) per unit area:67,69 
(9)where ΔQi is the amount of intercalated charge. Fig. 11 shows the plot of ΔOD versus charge density and the value of CE was evaluated from the slope of this curve. The calculated CE of NiO film is 235 cm2 C−1, which is much higher than the reported values19,21–26 as discussed in the introduction section.

EIS was used as a tool to investigate the charge transfer/transport properties of the electrochromic NiO thin film. Fig. 12 shows the Nyquist plot of NiO thin film. The corresponding equivalent circuit for impedance analysis is displayed in the inset of Fig. 12. In the fitting circuit Rs, Rct, Cdl, W and Cp is solution resistance, charge transfer resistance, double layer capacitance, Warburg impedance and pseudo capacitance, respectively. The corresponding Rs and Rct values are 2.04 and 0.48 Ω, respectively. The plot clearly shows that there are three processes involved during the intercalation of Li+ ion into NiO film. (i) The semi-circular arc found at the high frequency region corresponds to the migration of the Li+ ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, (ii) the middle frequency range of the semicircle corresponds to the charge-transfer process, (iii) the inclined straight line at the low frequency region corresponds to the lithium ion diffusion into the bulk of the electrode material or so-called Warburg diffusion. The linear impedance spectrum clearly determine the diffusion process; i.e., the free diffusion of the lithium ions from an electrolyte as well as the electrons from the working electrode into the electrochromic layer. The steeper and lower slope of low-frequency tail indicates higher lithium ion conductivity in the electrode materials.68,70 This is in accordance with fast switching time.

4. Conclusions
In summary, NiO thin film with better reversibility, high optical modulation, and enhanced coloration efficiency with fast switching time was prepared using rf magnetron sputtering technique. X-ray diffraction study confirmed the presence of cubic phase NiO in the deposited film. XPS study confirmed the compositional purity and the presence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions in the film. The average transmittance of 67% and the energy bang gap of 3.08 eV were obtained. The smooth morphology of the deposited film facilitates the easy intercalation of lithium ion. Vibrational property through micro-Raman study showed two Raman bands around 570 cm−1 and 1100 cm−1 corresponding to Ni–O bond. Photoluminescence study showed band-edge emission at 368 nm which correlates with our optical measurement. Electrochemical properties of NiO film showed high optical modulation of 58% with charge intercalation of 4.2 mC cm−2. The fast switching time of the film was realized from the chronoamperometric measurement. The results show the excellent electrochromic performance of rf magnetron sputtered NiO film with the highest CE of 235 cm2 C−1. Electrochemical impedance measurement indicates the faster lithium ion transfer with fast switching time, which facilitates the improved electrochromic behavior.
