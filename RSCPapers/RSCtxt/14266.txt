    , Accepted 22nd March 2018First published on 23rd March 2018AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) show great advantages as new kinds of active materials for energy storage. In this study, bimetallic metal–organic frameworks (Ni/Co-MOFs) with nanosheet-assembled flower-like structures were synthesized by etching Ni-MOF microspheres in a cobalt nitrate solution. It can be clearly observed that the amount of Co(NO3)2 and etching time play crucial roles in the formation of Ni/Co-MOF nanosheets. The Ni/Co-MOFs were used as electrode materials for supercapacitors and the optimized Ni/Co-MOF-5 exhibited the highest capacitances of 1220.2 F g−1 and 986.7 F g−1 at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Ni/Co-MOF-5 was further sulfurized, and the derived Ni–Co–S electrode showed a higher specific capacitance of 1377.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a retention of 89.4% when the current density was increased to 10 A g−1, indicating superior rate capability. Furthermore, Ni/Co-MOF-5 and Ni–Co–S showed excellent cycling stability, i.e. about 87.8% and 93.7% of initial capacitance can be still maintained after 3000 cycles of charge–discharge. More interestingly, the Ni/Co-MOF-5//AC ASC shows an energy density of 30.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1132.8 W kg−1, and the Ni–Co–S//AC ASC displays a high energy density of 36.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1066.42 W kg−1. These results demonstrate that the as-synthesized bimetallic Ni/Co-MOF nanosheets and their derived nickel–cobalt sulfides have promising applications in electrochemical supercapacitors.
Introduction
Energy shortage and environmental deterioration have attracted widespread attention towards searching for clean and renewable sources of energy.1,2 As a new kind of electrochemical energy storage device, supercapacitors with high power density, long cycle life, and no pollution3–5 have received intense interest. They have partially replaced conventional rechargeable batteries for practical applications,6 such as mobile electronic devices and electric vehicles.7 However, supercapacitors still suffer from a relatively poor energy output in comparison with batteries. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the electrochemical performance of electrode materials.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted a lot of research interest due to their fascinating features, such as structural diversity, tunable pore size, and particularly large specific surface area.8–10 Thus, MOFs have been widely used in gas separation and storage, catalysis, sensing and drug delivery.11–15 Recently, the applications of MOFs have expanded to energy conversion and storage, such as fuel cells,16 lithium-ion batteries,17,18 supercapacitors,19,20 solar cells,21 and Li–S batteries,22 where MOFs act as electrode materials.23 However, previous reports have revealed that MOFs generally have poor electronic conductivity and large steric hindrance, which hamper their direct utilization as electrode materials.23–27 Hence, it is essential to explore a new strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of MOFs.28–30
Bimetallic MOFs with two different kinds of metal ions could provide improved electrochemical performance. For example, Zn-doped Ni-MOF shows excellent electrochemical performances, when adopted as an electrode material for a supercapacitor.31 The capacitance of a Zn-doped Ni-MOF can reach up to 1620 and 854 F g−1 at discharge current densities of 0.25 and 10 A g−1, respectively. And the capacitance retention was kept at 91% after 3000 cycles. These results indicate that the doping of a hetero-metal can enhance the electrochemical performance of MOFs.
As a type of promising electrode material, transition metal sulfides have been intensively investigated due to their high capacitance and excellent conductivity.32 Superior to monometallic sulfides, bimetallic metal sulfides can offer richer redox reactions owing to the hetero-metal ion enhanced charge transfer between different ions.33 In this regard, various bimetallic sulfides, such as NiCo2S4 nanoboxes,34 ball-in-ball hollow spheres,35 and nanotubes,36 have been synthesized and used as supercapacitor electrode materials.
In this work, Ni-MOF microspheres were used as templates and etched in a cobalt nitrate solution to prepare various Ni/Co-MOF nanosheets (Scheme 1). By tuning the amount of Co(NO3)2 and etching time, the obtained Ni/Co-MOF-5 displays the best electrochemical performance (1220.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, 87.8% retention over 3000 cycles), when used as an electrochemical active material for supercapacitors. Ni/Co-MOF-5 was further sulfurized to form Ni–Co–S nanoparticles, which delivered excellent electrochemical performance with higher specific capacitance and superior cycling stability (1377.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, 93.7% retention over 3000 cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitor devices were also assembled to evaluate the practical application of Ni/Co-MOF-5 and Ni–Co–S electrodes.

Materials preparation

Synthesis of Ni-MOF. 
All chemicals of reagent grade in the experiment were commercially available and used without further purification. In a typical procedure, 20 mL of 0.02 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution, 25 mg of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and 6 mL of ethylene glycol were mixed at room temperature under vigorous stirring for 30 min.37 Then, the solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and the autoclave was maintained at 120 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature gradually, a light green precipitate was obtained by centrifugation, washing with DMF and anhydrous ethanol several times, and then drying at 60 °C for 12 h.


Synthesis of Ni/Co-MOF nanosheet-composed flower-like structures. 
The as-prepared Ni-MOF template (20 mg) was dispersed in 15 mL of ethanol under magnetic stirring for 10 min at room temperature. Different amounts of cobalt nitrate were dissolved in 5 mL of ethanol under sonication for 5 min, and then the cobalt nitrate solution was poured into the above Ni-MOF solution with vigorous stirring for 20 min. After that, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and then maintained at 80 °C for 6 h, before cooling down to room temperature. The products were collected by centrifugation, washing three times with ethanol and drying. The obtained products were denoted as Ni/Co-MOF-x (x = 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 7), where x indicated the mass ratio of Co(NO3)2·6H2O to Ni-MOF.


Synthesis of Ni–Co–S nanoparticles. 
20 mg of Ni/Co-MOF-5 were dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol, followed by the addition of 40 mg of thioacetamide (TAA). After stirring for 10 min, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 6 h. The products were obtained after centrifugation, washing with ethanol for several times and drying.

Characterization
The crystalline structure of the sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), performed on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer using a Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation operating at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The morphology and composition of the sample were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected on a NICOLET-5700 FTIR spectrophotometer using KBr as pellets.
Electrochemical measurements
The working electrodes were prepared by mixing 75 wt% active materials, 20 wt% acetylene black, and 5 wt% polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) with a little ethanol to form a slurry, drying at 70 °C for 12 h. Then, the slurry was coated onto a nickel foam current collector (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm), and the resulting electrode was pressed at 10.0 MPa and dried at 60 °C overnight. The electrochemical measurements were carried out in 3.0 M KOH aqueous solution using a three-electrode system.
The specific capacitance was calculated by the following equation: (1)in which I (A) was the discharge current, and Δt (s), ΔV (V), and m (g) represented the total discharge time, the potential range of discharge and the mass of active materials, respectively.
The asymmetric supercapacitor devices were assembled with Ni/Co-MOF-5 or Ni–Co–S as a positive electrode and AC as a negative electrode. The optimal mass ratio of the positive electrode and negative electrode was calculated by the following equation: (2)where m, C and ΔV are the mass, specific capacitance and potential of the electrode, respectively.
The energy density (E) and power density (P) of the ASC device were calculated based on the following equations: (3) (4)where E (W h kg−1), P (W kg−1), C (F g−1), ΔV (V) and Δt (s) represent the energy density, power density, specific capacitance, voltage range and discharge time, respectively.
Results and discussion
The syntheses of Ni/Co-MOF nanosheets and derived Ni–Co–S materials are schematically demonstrated in Scheme 1. The surface morphology of the Ni-MOF template was analyzed by SEM. As shown in Fig. S1a,† Ni-MOF displays uniform spherical morphology. The high-magnification SEM image (Fig. S1b†) reveals that the surfaces of these Ni-MOF spheres are smooth and the average particle size is about 600 nm. The detailed characterization studies and electrochemical performances of this Ni-MOF nanosphere have been reported recently by our group.37 After reacting with Co(NO3)2·6H2O, the Ni-MOF sphere was transformed into bimetallic Ni/Co-MOF nanosheets. To investigate the possible formation process of Ni/Co-MOF nanosheets, a series of parallel experiments by varying the mass ratio of Co(NO3)2 to Ni-MOF and reaction time were carried out. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared Ni/Co-MOF nanosheets were examined by SEM as depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2.† The SEM images clearly suggest that a small number of spheres can still be observed for Ni/Co-MOF-x (x = 0.5, 1, 3) (Fig. 1a–i) with relatively low Co(NO3)2/Ni-MOF ratios, indicating that the etching reaction is insufficient. The reaction is complete when the mass ratio is increased to 5 and reaction time is prolonged to 6 h, as no Ni-MOF nanospheres could be found (Fig. 1j–l and Fig. S2a–d†). Ni/Co-MOF-5 shows flower-like morphologies that are apparently composed of many petal nanosheets with uniform size and smooth surface. As the dosage of Co(NO3)2·6H2O was further increased, the nanoflower structure was damaged, which is depicted in Fig. 1m–o (Ni/Co-MOF-7). The possible mechanism regarding the morphology evolution of Ni-MOF may be attributed to two aspects: (i) similar sizes of Ni and Co ion radii make it possible that the Co2+ ion partially substitutes the Ni2+ ion in the Ni-MOF;38 and (ii) the Ni-MOF spheres were etched by Co2+ with the outside-in approach, then transformed into bimetallic Ni/Co-MOF nanosheet-composed flower-like structures.

The crystalline phases of the samples were studied by XRD. As shown in Fig. 2a, the XRD pattern of the as-prepared Ni-MOF template matches well with the simulated pattern, suggesting that pure phase Ni-MOF has been successfully synthesized. Besides, all Ni/Co-MOFs present the same XRD patterns as Ni-MOF, indicating that the crystalline structure of Ni-MOF could be retained after the incorporation of Co, although the morphology has changed. The FTIR spectra of Ni/Co-MOF-5 and Ni-MOF are nearly the same, further confirming the similar structure of two samples (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was further conducted to examine the element composition of Ni/Co-MOF-5. It can be seen from Fig. S3,† that C, O, Co, and Ni co-exist in the sample, revealing that Co has been successfully incorporated.

To further improve the electrochemical performance, Ni/Co-MOF was further sulfurized, since metal sulfides show higher conductivity and good electrochemical capacitive performance. The thermal stability of Ni/Co-MOF-5 was investigated by TG, as shown in Fig. S4.† Significant weight loss starts at 400 °C, indicating good thermal stability, which makes Ni/Co-MOF-5 a suitable precursor and a self-sacrificial template for preparing bimetallic sulfide. The structure of the as-obtained Ni–Co–S samples was analysed by XRD. Fig. S5† reveals the amorphous nature of the as-derived sample after the sulfurization treatment. The morphological and structural features of the Ni–Co–S samples were investigated by SEM and EDS, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. Ni–Co–S is composed of nanoparticles and the nanoparticles appear to be fairly uniform in size. EDS (Fig. 3c) confirms the presence of Ni, Co and S in the sample. Elementary mapping images shown in Fig. 3d further indicate that Ni, Co and S elements are uniformly distributed in the material.

N2 physisorption measurements were performed to study the porosity of the samples, and the adsorption/desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions of the samples are presented in Fig. 2c and d. The measured BET surface areas of Ni/Co-MOF-5 and Ni–Co–S are 36.97 and 19.50 m2 g−1, respectively. In addition, the mean pore sizes of Ni/Co-MOF-5 and Ni–Co–S are around 87 and 86 nm, respectively. It is known that the porosity is always closely related to the electrochemical performance, which can facilitate the transfer of ions and electrons at the electrode/electrolyte interface and alleviate the volume change during the charge–discharge process.38,39
The electrochemical performances of Ni-MOF, a series of Ni/Co-MOF-x, and Ni–Co–S have been evaluated systematically by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements in 3.0 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. The CV curves were studied at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 4a, S6a and S7a.† It is obvious that the Ni/Co-MOF-5 CV curves have stronger redox peaks, indicating a much higher capacitance. In addition, GCD tests were carried out in a potential of 0–0.43 V (vs. Hg/HgO reference electrode) at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 4b, S6b and S7b†). It shows that the discharge time of Ni/Co-MOF-5 is the longest. As a result, Ni/Co-MOF-5 displays superior electrochemical property.

The CV curves of Ni/Co-MOF-5 at different scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 4c. The separation of the redox peaks increases so that the oxidation peaks move toward higher potential while the reduction peaks move toward lower potential with the increase of scan rates, which may be explained by the polarization effect.40,41 The GCD curves (Fig. 4d) of the Ni/Co-MOF-5 electrode show typical pseudo-capacitive behavior at various current densities ranging from 1 to 10 A g−1. The specific capacitances of Ni-MOF and a series of Ni/Co-MOF-x samples at different current densities are summarized in Fig. 4e, S6c and S7c.† The Ni/Co-MOF-5 electrode exhibits the highest specific capacity at all current densities. From the discharge curves, it can be seen that Ni/Co-MOF-5 shows excellent specific capacitances of 1220.2 F g−1 and 986.7 F g−1 at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Furthermore, by comparison, the specific capacitance of the Ni/Co-MOF-5 electrode is higher than that of many reported MOF-based electrode materials (Table S1†).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has also been performed in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz and the corresponding Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4f, S6d and S7d.† These Nyquist plots mainly consisted of a semicircle at the high-frequency region and followed by a straight line at the low-frequency region. The inset in Fig. 4f shows an equivalent circuit, where Rs the reflected solution resistance, Rct the reflected charge-transfer resistance, Cp the faradaic pseudocapacitor, and CPE represents the constant phase element accounting for a double-layer capacitance. Rs is 1.7 Ω and Rct is 0.4 Ω. The results indicate that the bimetallic Ni/Co-MOF-5 exhibits superior electrochemical performance. Moreover, the electrochemical stability over cycling of the Ni/Co-MOF-5 electrode was tested for 3000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 5a, the specific capacity retention of the Ni/Co-MOF-5 electrode is 87.8% after 3000 cycles. The capacitance had a certain degree of recession that may be due to electrode loss after long-term stability tests. The superior cycling stability could be attributed to the unique porous structure composed of ultrathin nanosheets which can maintain the morphology, and prevent aggregation and deactivation during the iterative redox reaction.42

The electrochemical performance of Ni/Co-MOF-5 derived Ni–Co–S was also studied. The CV curves of the Ni–Co–S electrode at various scan rates ranging from 5 to 50 mV S−1 in a potential window of 0 to 0.5 V are presented in Fig. 6a. The GCD curves (Fig. 6b) of the Ni–Co–S electrode also show typical pseudo-capacitive behavior. The Ni–Co–S electrode shows a high capacity of 1377.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a capacity of 1232.0 F g−1 can be delivered even at a current density of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 6c) indicating a favorable rate capability. The EIS of the Ni–Co–S modified electrode exhibited a small semicircle (Fig. 6d), and the inset shows an equivalent circuit in which the Rs is 6.37 Ω and Rct is 1.52 × 10−5 Ω. These results further suggested that the electrode has good capacitive behavior. The cycling stability is tested at a current density of 10 A g−1, as displayed in Fig. 5a. After 3000 cycles test, the specific capacitance of the Ni–Co–S electrode still remains 93.7% of the initial. All the above tests indicate that Ni–Co–S is a promising active electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.

The asymmetric supercapacitor devices (ASC) of Ni/Co-MOF-5//AC ASC and Ni–Co–S//AC ASC were assembled to further evaluate the practical application of Ni/Co-MOF-5 and Ni–Co–S materials. The electrochemical properties of the AC electrode were also measured in 3.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte using a three electrode system, as shown in Fig. S8.† The specific capacitance of the AC electrode is 135.6 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. A series of CV curves with different voltage windows at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 demonstrate that the maximum operation potential window of the Ni–Co–S//AC ASC could reach 1.6 V (Fig. 7a and b). Fig. 7c shows the CV curves of the Ni–Co–S//AC ASC device at various scan rates ranging from 5 to 50 mV s−1. The GCD curves of this ASC device at various current densities between 1 and 10 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 7d. A result analysis of the Ni/Co-MOF-5 was also presented to the optimized potential window, as CV curves and GCD curves in Fig. S9.†

The Ni/Co-MOF-5//AC ASC achieves specific capacitances of 76.67 F g−1 and 45.87 F g−1 at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The Ni–Co–S//AC specific capacitance of 103.9 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and a capacity of 72.0 F g−1 is still maintained even at a current density of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 7e). The Ni/Co-MOF-5//AC ASC shows an energy density of 30.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1132.8 W kg−1, and 18.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 11234.5 W kg−1. The Ni–Co–S//AC ASC displays a high energy density of 36.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1066.42 W kg−1, and 24.8 W h kg−1 even at a high power density of 10490.8 W kg−1 (Fig. 7f). In addition, the Ni/Co-MOF-5//AC and Ni–Co–S//AC ASC have achieved good cycling stabilities of 80.1% and 83.0% initial capacity at 6 A g−1 after 3000 cycles, respectively (Fig. 5b). The energy and power densities of the Ni–Co–S//AC ASC are comparable to or even higher than those of many bimetallic sulfide based ASC devices, such as AC//NiCo2S4 (28 W h kg−1 at 150 W kg−1 and 28.3 W h kg−1 at 245 W kg−1),34,43 and sandwich-type NiCo2S4@rGO (21.9 W h kg−1 at 417.1 W kg−1).44 Therefore, these results indicate that the Ni–Co–S sample is a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
Conclusions
In summary, bimetallic Ni/Co-MOFs have been synthesized by etching Ni-MOF microspheres with Co(NO3)2. Nanosheet-assembled flower-like structures could be obtained by adjusting the mass ratio of Co(NO3)2 to Ni-MOF and the reaction time. The optimized Ni/Co-MOF-5 showed superior electrochemical performance with high specific capacitances of 1220.2 F g−1 and 986.7 F g−1 at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Furthermore, it also exhibited a high capacitance retention of 87.8% after 3000 cycles. Compared with pristine MOF electrode, the Ni/Co-MOF-5 derived Ni–Co–S showed a higher capacitance of 1377.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a capacity of 1232.0 F g−1 can be delivered even at a current density of 10 A g−1, showing good rate capability. The retention was up to 93.7% even after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled by Ni–Co–S exhibits a high energy density of 36.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1066.42 W kg−1 and a good cycling stability of 83.01% initial capacity at 6 A g−1 after 3000 cycles. Therefore, this study provides an opportunity to explore the electrochemical properties of mixed-metallic MOFs and their derivations.
