        TiO2/SWCNT (single-wall carbon nanotube) composites were prepared by a low temperature nano-cluster deposition (NCD) of TiO2 onto SWCNTs. The TiO2 films grown onto SWCNTs at a low temperature by NCD consisted of a mixture of rutile and anatase, which was chosen for its favorable photo-response and photoelectrochemical effects. The strong adhesion between the TiO2/SWCNT and the ITO (indium tin oxide)/glass for the working electrode was effectively achieved by applying a few droplets of ethanol onto the TiO2/SWCNT/ITO/glass. The current–voltage curve of the TiO2/SWCNT indicated a rectifying behavior, and the photo response was approximately 60 times higher than that of TiO2 thick films. Regarding the photoelectrochemical activity of the TiO2/SWCNT, composites with an ultra-thin thickness of about 1 μm under UV illumination of a low power of 0.3 mW cm−2, showed a photoconversion efficiency of about 18.0%, which was a high efficiency at a low power density. The mixed rutile and anatase TiO2 deposited onto SWCNTs using NCD at a low temperature effectively enhanced the photoresponse and the photoelectrochemical abilities of the TiO2/SWCNTs.
1. Introduction

        Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been studied extensively due to its attractive physical and chemical properties such as high chemical stability, mechanical resistance, and high optical transmittance in the IR-visible spectrum. TiO2 thin films are used for anti-reflection coatings, optical interference filters, and optical waveguides.1–3 Moreover, they also exhibit interesting photocatalytic properties4–7 in dye-sensitized solar cells8,9 and sensor arrays.10,11 When an oxide is deposited onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs), it produces a photodiode effect. This also produces a short-circuit photocurrent due to the reduced kinetic recombination of excitons when a charge is transferred across the interface.12–14
The enhancement of the photoelectrochemical activity observed in the TiO2/CNT composite can be attributed to several possible merits contributed by CNTs. Taking advantage of the large surface area, extraordinary electrical conductivity, robust mechanical strength and thermal stability of CNTs, CNT/TiO2 composites have been employed in a wide range of applications for solar cells and environmental remediation.15–17
Two TiO2 polymorphs are typically used. Anatase exhibits a significantly higher photocatalytic activity than rutile.18 However, in some cases, the activity of the rutile has been found to be superior.19 Commercial TiO2 powders consisting of mixed rutile and anatase, such as Degussa P25, have a higher level of photocatalytic activity than single-phase materials. The enhanced photocatalytic activity supposedly is due to the spatial charge separation across the anatase/rutile interfaces as a result of a staggered band alignment.20

        TiO2 thin films have been obtained by deposition methods such as sol–gel, physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), and reactive pulsed laser deposition. Metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of TiO2 onto CNTs is of considerable interest for technological applications.21,22 However, as far as can be ascertained, only few papers have been published on the fabrication of mixtures of anatase and rutile onto CNTs at low temperatures below 400 °C. NCD technology, which was originated by our group for room temperature CVD, allows the deposition of the crystallized oxide films near room temperature and produces an excellent conformal deposition.23 Therefore, low-temperature NCD of mixtures of anatase and rutile onto CNTs was introduced in the present study because it produced nanosized crystalline nuclei at the showerhead when it was maintained at a high temperature above 200 °C.23,24
In the present study, a mixture of anatase and rutile was grown onto SWCNTs at low temperatures using NCD for enhancement of the UV-response and the photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2/SWCNT composites. Structural, ultraviolet-responsive, and photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2/SWCNT nanocomposite films were addressed in detail.
2. Experimental section
2.1 
          TiO2 deposition onto SWCNTs by NCD
SWCNTs were deposited onto a SiO2/Si substrate for photo-responsive properties and onto an ITO/glass substrate for photocatalytic properties by arc discharge25 at a thickness of approximately 4 μm. TiO2 thin films were deposited onto SWCNTs by NCD. The NCD technique has been well described in our previous work.23,24 The schematic diagram of NCD for the deposition of TiO2 is shown in Fig. S1† (the ESI). In the case of conventional CVD, the showerhead temperature was maintained at a low level, at which the vapors of precursors were not condensed. Conversely, for film deposition at ≤400 °C, nano-sized crystalline nuclei from the evaporated precursor should be produced at the showerhead when it is maintained above the decomposition temperature of the precursors. The key factor in thin oxide film growth using NCD is maintaining the showerhead at a high temperature in order to sequentially decompose the precursors, react with O2, and form the desired TiO2 nano-cluster sizes at the showerhead. The showerhead design incorporates a long pathway to provide a sufficient drift time to keep the precursors in contact with it long enough to decompose the evaporated precursors completely (see the detailed structure of the showerhead at the right of ESI Fig. S1†). Nano-sized nuclei produced at the showerhead result in film growth on the substrates, which are maintained at a low temperature. For crystallized film growth by NCD, both showerhead temperature and deposition pressure should be controlled to prevent gas-phase reactions, which induce the porous morphologies of the films attributed to a decrease of mean-free path of the crystallized nano-clusters in gas phase. For deposition of TiO2 using NCD, Ti(O-iPr)2(dibm)2(Ti(O-i-C3H7)2(C9H15O2)2) precursors were used for the first time in the study, because they have an advantage such as a high vapor pressure at 112 °C and a thermal decomposition temperature of about 220 °C. The precursors for liquid delivery were dissolved in hexane and used as the sources of titanium at concentrations of 0.075 mol L−1. O2 and Ar were used as the reaction and carrier gas, respectively. When the chemical sources entered the vaporizer, they were immediately vaporized and carried to the showerhead within the reactive chamber by the argon carrier gas at a flow rate of 100 sccm (standard cm3 min−1). O2 was supplied to the showerhead as an oxidant at a fixed flow rate of 100 sccm. The source vapors were reacted at the showerhead, which was maintained at 200–230 °C to form rutile and at 240–300 °C to form anatase, while the substrate temperature was maintained at 400 °C. The deposition time for the TiO2 films was varied from 30 to 120 min. The precise measurements of substrate and showerhead temperatures were made in situ using thermocouples embedded in the surfaces of the showerhead and the substrate.
2.2 Structural properties of TiO2/SWCNT composite films
The crystalline structure and the preferred orientation of the TiO2/SWCNT composite films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-RC) using Cu Kα radiation and a nickel filter. The roughness of TiO2 films deposited onto the Si (001) substrates was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, AutoProbe CP). The microstructure and the thickness of the thin films were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, TOPCON DS-130C) and SEM cross-sectional images, respectively. The elemental distribution of the TiO2 coated onto SWCNT was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to determine the depth-profile. The crystallinity and the identification of the mixture phases were analyzed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM: JEM-2100 F, HR).
2.3 Photoelectrochemical response and properties of the TiO2/SWCNT composites
The UV response of TiO2/SWCNT thin films was measured using a Keithley 2400 I–V SourceMeter under a 4 W, 365 nm UV light source (UV-Handlampe VL-4. LC, France). The device diagram for the measurement of the UV response is shown in Fig. S2†(a) (the ESI). A Pt (100 nm)/Ti (30 nm) electrode 1 mm wide and 10 mm long was deposited onto a SiO2/Si substrate by DC sputtering using a shadow mask. The space between the 2 Pt/Ti electrodes was maintained at 0.35–0.40 cm. The TiO2/SWCNT films were deposited onto the Pt electrodes. A schematic diagram for the measurement of the photoelectrochemical response of the TiO2/SWCNT films is shown in Fig. S2†(b) (the ESI). The measurement system (glass tank) included various electrodes such as a reference electrode (saturated calomel electrode by Hg2Cl2/Hg, Cl−), a counter electrode (Pt), and a working electrode (TiO2/SWCNT/ITO/glass). These electrodes were established in a solution of 10 mg L−1MB + 0.1 M NaCl (pH = 3.0) for the measurement of the photoelectrochemical properties by exposure to UV light.
3. Results and discussion
The structures of the TiO2 films grown at different temperatures on Si (001) substrates were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns of the TiO2 thin films grown at showerhead temperatures of 220 and 280 °C are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. From the XRD patterns shown in the range of 2θ = 24–29°, peak intensities of anatase and rutile were dependent upon the showerhead temperature of the NCD. With a showerhead temperature of 220 °C (Fig. 1(a)), TiO2 films deposited at 350 and 400 °C showed a higher intensity of rutile than anatase. However, films deposited at 300 °C showed no peaks indicating the crystalline phases because a low deposition temperature is not enough for the crystallization of the films. Conversely, films grown at 300–400 °C with a showerhead temperature of 280 °C exhibited a higher intensity of anatase than rutile (see Fig. 1(b)). Using NCD, crystalline TiO2 nano-sized nuclei were induced to form at the showerhead, which was maintained at a high temperature so that the precursors could be decomposed and reacted with O2. The deposition of nuclei formed at a low showerhead temperature, as in conventional MOCVD, showed a higher dependency on the substrate temperature than did deposition of nuclei formed at a high showerhead temperature. The mixture of anatase and rutile was reproducibly observed at a showerhead temperature of 280 °C. This result suggests that the mixture of anatase and rutile definitely depends on the showerhead temperature in NCD. The nuclei formed by a high-temperature showerhead increased the roughness of the final deposited films. The result was clearly shown in the AFM images of the TiO2/SWCNT (see Fig. 1(d)). Mixed rutile (∼20%) and anatase (∼80%) reportedly enhance the photoelectrochemical activity.6,25 Three-dimensional AFM images of the TiO2/Si grown at showerhead temperatures of 220 and 280 °C are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), respectively. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the TiO2 films grown on Si (001) substrates at showerhead temperatures of 220 and 280 °C was approximately 8 and 13 nm, respectively. The morphologies of the TiO2 were dependent on the showerhead temperature, and the TiO2 grown at a showerhead temperature of 280 °C exhibited the morphology of an equiaxed particle, indicating a larger surface area than that of TiO2 grown at a showerhead temperature of 220 °C. Fig. 2 shows SEM surface images of (a) SWCNTs and (b) TiO2/SWCNTs (at a 280 °C showerhead temperature). Compared with the pure SWCNTs, TiO2 films grown onto SWCNTs at a showerhead temperature of 280 °C exhibited a rough morphology like bamboo, indicating a large surface area. This result suggests that a large surface area enhances the photo-response and the photoelectrochemical properties of a TiO2/SWCNT composite nanostructure.

Fig. 3(a) shows the TEM image of the TiO2-coated composite nanostructure formed at 400 °C for 60 min under a 280 °C showerhead temperature. The TEM images show that the large surface area TiO2 completely covered the surface of SWCNTs with an overall thickness of approximately 100 nm. To further investigate the crystal structure and the interfacial regions between TiO2 and SWCNT, the 20 nm-thick TiO2/SWCNT composite nanostructures were chosen as shown in Fig. 3(b). The HRTEM from the box area of Fig. 3(b) was used to see the details of these nanocomposite structures, and the results are shown in Fig. 3(c). The interface between the SWCNT core and the coated TiO2 shell was clearly observed. The thickness of the SWCNT was about 3 nm and the TiO2 shell included different polycrystalline structures. Lattice fringes with interplanar spacing d110 = 0.32 nm are consistent with the tetragonal rutile phase (JCPDS card no. 21-1276). Conversely, lattice fringes of d101 = 0.35 nm are consistent with the anatase phase (JCPDS card no. 21-1272). The HRTEM indicated that the TiO2 shell contained nanocrystals with both rutile and anatase, which is consistent with the results from the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1(b). The results were also consistent with ZnO/TiO2 core-shell nanostructures prepared by a hydrothermal and magnetron sputter technique.26 The elemental distribution of the TiO2 coated onto the SWCNTs was observed using the XPS depth-profile (see Fig. S3†(a) of the ESI). The Ti and O elements were uniformly distributed in the TiO2 films. The carbon observed at an etching time of 250 s was attributed to a contamination by handling the sample and the carbon was completely removed after etching the surface for 1400 s, at which point, the XPS spectrum, as shown in Fig. S3†(b) (the ESI), indicated a pure TiO2 phase. Park et al.27 reported that the carbon-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays showed much higher photocurrent densities than pure TiO2 nanotube arrays. The physical properties of the TiO2/SWCNT composites were summarized in detail in Table 1. The weight fraction of rutile, WR, can be calculated directly from the peak area values by the following equation:28WR = AR/(AA × 0.884 + AR), where AR and AA are the (110) rutile and the (101) anatase peak, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the current–voltage (I–V) and the photo-response properties of the anatase thick film and the TiO2/SWCNT nanocomposites. The photo-response of the TiO2/SWCNT composites was compared to that of the anatase thick films. The anatase paste for the thick films was applied to the patterned Pt electrode by the doctor-blade process at a thickness of approximately 10 μm. After coating, the films were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h in ambient air to burn out the binders. As shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), both the anatase thick films and the TiO2/SWCNT showed I–V characteristics exhibiting a Schottky contact with and without UV light (300 μW cm−2 at a wavelength of 365 nm). The anatase thick films showed similar current values with and without UV light exposure. Conversely, compared with the anatase thick films, TiO2/SWCNT composites under UV light showed a typical Schottky contact and a higher current flow than that of the samples not under UV light. The insets in Fig. 4(a) and (b) show SEM surface images of the anatase thick films and the TiO2/SWCNT composites, respectively. The photo-responses of the anatase thick films and the TiO2/SWCNT composites are shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d), respectively. In the case of anatase thick films, the photo-response ((A − Ao)/Ao) in the case of light-off (Ao: current at light off) and light-on (A: current at light on) was approximately 27%, and the response took 50 s under 2 V. Conversely, the photo-response of the TiO2/SWCNT composites was approximately 1400%, and the composite readily responded to the UV light, indicating a response time of about 50 s under 2 V. The efficiency of the photo-response in the TiO2/SWCNT composites was 60-fold higher than that of the anatase thick films.

Here, the thickness of the anatase thick films and the TiO2/SWCNT composites was about 10 and 1–2 μm, respectively. 

Fig. 5(a)–(c) show the SEM images of TiO2 films grown at 400 °C for 30, 90, and 120 min, respectively, onto the SWCNTs/ITO/glass. As shown in Fig. 5, TiO2 thickness increased with the increasing deposition time, and the surface area also increased with the increasing thickness. From the surface images of the TiO2/SWCNT, NCD proved to be an effective method to increase the surface area of the mixed anatase and rutile on SWCNTs for the enhancement of the photoelectrochemical properties. Fig. 5(d) shows the XRD patterns of TiO2 films grown with different deposition times on SWCNT/Si (001). In the case of XRD measurement, because the glass substrate shows an amorphous structure, the broad peak from the glass substrate below 2θ = 30° hides the peaks that would indicate rutile and anatase. Therefore, TiO2/SWCNT was grown onto a silicon substrate instead of ITO/glass. The peak intensity of anatase (101) and rutile (110) increased with the increasing deposition time. The intensity ratios of anatase and rutile grown for 120 min were approximately 65 and 35%, respectively.

When the working electrode was inserted into the electrolyte solution of 10 mg L−1MB + 0.1 M NaCl, the TiO2/SWCNT was peeled off from the ITO/glass substrate. The working electrode was treated with a few droplets of ethanol on the TiO2/SWCNT/ITO/glass and dried for 10 min in air at 80 °C to improve the adhesion between the TiO2/SWCNT and the ITO/glass. Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows SEM cross-sectional images of the TiO2/SWCNT composites before and after the ethanol treatment, respectively. As-grown ITO/SWCNT composites showed a porous structure of about 4 μm thickness (see Fig. 6(a)), while the ethanol-treated composites showed a dense structure of about 1 μm thickness. The ITO/SWCNT composites of about 1 μm were used for the photo-response and the photoelectrochemical properties. The variations in density observed in the enlarged images of the interfaces before (Fig. 6(c)) and after (Fig. 6(d)) ethanol treatment were remarkable. Hoa et al.29 observed that the methanol treatment makes the floating tubes collapse and stick on the substrate. They also showed that the collapse of porous SWCNTs originates from the hydrophobic nature of the tubes in methanol.30

The potentiodynamic scans of the TiO2/SWCNT composite electrode were performed from −0.5 to +0.85 V vs.SCE with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under UV illumination to investigate the influence of the applied potential on the magnitude of the photocurrent. Fig. 7(a) shows the linear sweep voltammograms of the TiO2/SWCNT composite electrodes with a TiO2 deposition time of 120 min. Under UV illumination, the anodic photocurrent increased with increasing potential bias, and the saturated photocurrent density at 0.85 V (vs.SCE) was approximately 85 μA cm−2. When the experiment is carried out without UV illumination, a small anodic photocurrent of about 3 μA cm−2 was observed at a high potential bias. This result was attributed to the ambient room light. Fig. S4† (the ESI) shows the relationship between the photocurrent and the exposure time using visible light in a structure, which is also shown in Fig. S1†(a) (the ESI). In Fig. S4†, the photo-current increased with increasing power of the visible light. Here, the power of the visible light was about 400 lux. Ambient room light of 400 lux produced a photo-current of about 0.6 μA. This result suggests that the room light influenced the photocurrent of the TiO2/SWCNT composite electrode without UV illumination. However, because the intensity of the room light was relatively weak, it did not significantly influence the photocurrent under UV illumination.

The potentiodynamic scans of the TiO2/SWCNT composite electrode were performed from −0.5 to + 0.85 V vs.SCE with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under UV light illumination. (b) Photoconversion efficiency (%) as a function of applied potential under UV light illumination. 
The photoconversion efficiency of the TiO2/SWCNT composite electrodes with a TiO2 deposition time of 120 min was calculated using the following equation:31 εff (photo) = [jp(E°rev − Eapp) × 100/(Io)](1) Eapp = (Emeas − Eaoc)(2)where jp is the photocurrent density (μA cm−2); Io is the intensity of the incident light (here, 300 μW cm−2); E°rev is the standard-state reversible potential (which is 1.23 V for the water-splitting reaction); Eapp is the absolute value of the applied potential; Emeas is the electrode potential (vs.SCE) of the working electrode that measured (+0.6 V); and Eaoc is the electrode potential at the open-circuit in the same electrolyte solution with illumination by UV light (−0.114 V). Using each value in parentheses, photoconversion efficiency (%) as a function of applied potential under UV illumination is shown in Fig. 7(b). A maximum efficiency of about 18.0% was observed at an applied potential of 0.2 V vs.SCE for the TiO2/SWCNT composite electrodes. This result is comparable to the efficiencies of ∼16.16% and 16% observed at the TiO2 nanotube array32 (light intensity (Io) = 2.6 mW cm−2) and TiO2/SWCNT composites33 (Io = 50 mW cm−2), respectively. However, compared with the light intensities used by researchers, the photo conversion efficiency observed under the light intensity (Io = 0.3 mW cm−2) used in the present study is more predominant than the results reported previously.
4. Conclusions
The TiO2/SWCNT composites were prepared by a TiO2 deposition at low temperature using NCD onto SWCNTs fabricated by an arc-discharge method. The TiO2 films grown on SWCNTs at a substrate temperature of 400 °C and a showerhead temperature of 280 °C consisted of a mixture of rutile and anatase phase, which presented a favorable property for photo-response and the photoelectrochemical effects. The current–voltage curve of the TiO2/SWCNT reveals a rectifying behavior and the photo-response of the composites is about 60 times as high as that of the TiO2 thick films. For photoelectrochemical activity of the TiO2/SWCNT, an increase of the TiO2 deposition time shows an increase of the photo-current density and the composites with a total thickness of about 1 μm showed a photo conversion efficiency of about 18.0% under a low UV light illumination of 0.3 mW cm−2. The mixed (rutile and anatase) TiO2 particles deposited using NCD at a low temperature onto SWCNTs effectively enhanced the photo-response and the photoelectrochemical abilities of TiO2/SWCNT.
