    , Accepted 5th January 2017First published on 6th January 2017AbstractA comprehensive investigation of the photophysics of a cofacially oriented bis-coumarin based on naphthalene, i.e., Cou-Nap, designed and synthesized to examine the influence of π-electronic communication between the two fluorophores, reveals exceptional excited-state properties. While the anticipated [2 + 2] photocycloaddition is not observed despite the fact that the two reactive coumarin units are at a distance of 3.8 Å, the fluorescence quantum yields and singlet lifetimes in different solvents are found to be remarkably higher when compared to those of the parent coumarin and a mono-coumarin model system, i.e., Cou-Dur. In addition to large solvent-induced Stokes shifts, Cou-Nap displays intriguing temperature-dependent emission in a nonpolar solvent such as cyclohexane. The observed photophysical properties are reconciled based on the so-called ‘phane effect’ that is operative in cyclophanes. In the latter, an effective π−π interaction between the aromatic rings modifies the attributes of the chromophore in such a manner that the observed properties cannot be associated with the individual aromatic rings. The temperature-dependent emission is proposed to arise as a consequence of thermally activated ISC from the singlet-excited state to one of the higher energy triplet states. The results constitute, for the first time, the demonstration of modification of the excited-state properties of a fluorophore in a non-cyclophane system by ‘phane effect’.
1. Introduction
Through-space electronic communication between cofacially oriented aromatic chromophores plays a crucial role in biological systems, e.g., in the context of molecular recognition in DNA and excitonic coupling in photosynthesis.1 It also prevails in face-to-face heterobimetallic complexes,2 molecular clips,3 conjugated polymers,4 light harvesting arrays,5 and molecular switches.6 Molecular systems with covalently linked and cofacially oriented aromatics are employed as model systems to gain mechanistic insights concerning biomimetic oxygen reduction,7 modulation of phenol oxidation,8 energy flow dynamics,9 singlet fission,10etc. A comprehensive understanding of through-space π–π interactions relies on the construction of systems in which rigid arenes are cofacially oriented at a distance of ca. 3.5 Å.1c [2,2]-Paracyclophanes in which the cofacial aromatic rings are constrained as an integral part are exquisite systems to probe through-space π–π interactions.11 Indeed, they have been exploited in diverse functional materials, e.g., optoelectronic materials,12 polymers,13 dye-sensitized solar cells,14etc. Extensive investigations on paracyclophane-based bis-chromophoric systems have shown that π–π interactions between the aromatic rings manifest in complete delocalization (phane effect) leading to absorption and emission properties that are not readily associated with individual aromatic chromophores.11 In one of our previous investigations, we unraveled the remarkable influence of ‘phane effect’ on the stabilization of o-quinonoid colored intermediates, which are generated by photolysis of 2,2-diphenylbenzopyrans.15 As in cyclophanes, through-space Coulombic interactions (polar/π) have been shown to operate in naphthalenes substituted at 1,8 positions with electronically differentiated aryl rings that are oriented cofacially.16 Such systems have indeed been applied in the development of fluorescent sensors,17 foldamers,18 DNA repair enzyme structural mimics,19 organic mixed valence compounds,20etc. Recently, we also demonstrated a remarkable through-space control of the spectrokinetic properties of o-quinonoid colored intermediates in naphthalenes functionalized cofacially at 1,8 positions with an aryl ring and 2,2-diphenylbenzopyran.21
Herein, we have inquired into how through-space π–π interactions of the kind responsible for ‘phane effect’ manifest in the excited-state properties of a bis-coumarin system constructed by functionalization of naphthalenes at 1,8 positions with coumarins (Cou-Nap, Fig. 1); the latter are excellent fluorophores, and are widely used as dyes, optical brighteners, sensors, DNA intercalators, biologically active ingredients, etc.22 We demonstrate that the cofacially oriented bis-coumarin system, i.e., Cou-Nap, behaves as a distinct entity with its excited-state properties differing drastically from those of the parent coumarin23 as well as the monomeric coumarin model system, i.e., Cou-Dur.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis of Cou-Nap and Cou-Dur
Syntheses of mono- and bis-coumarins were accomplished according to the routes shown in Fig. 2. To begin with, 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin, upon reaction with triflic anhydride, was converted to its triflyl derivative, i.e., 7-trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy-4-methylcoumarin (1).24 The latter was subjected to Pd(II)-catalyzed borylation using bis(pinacolato)diboron to afford 7-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-4-methylcoumarin (2). Suzuki cross-coupling of the resultant boronate ester (2) with diiodonaphthalene21 and 3-bromodurene,25 under Pd(0)-catalyzed conditions, furnished Cou-Nap and Cou-Dur, respectively, in good isolated yields. It should be mentioned that the synthesis of the bis-coumarin system may, in principle, lead to two isomers, namely, ‘syn’ and ‘anti’ depending on whether the two coumarin moieties are oriented in a head-to-head or head-to-tail fashion, respectively; the rotational equilibration of the coumarin rings about the naphthalene core cannot be possible in this system.17 Intriguingly, the synthesis, in at least 3 experiments, invariably led to a single product exclusively, characterized by X-ray crystallography as the ‘syn’ isomer, vide infra. The 1H NMR analysis of the product mixture revealed no evidence for the formation of the ‘anti’ isomer. We have not attempted to probe the origin of this selectivity.

2.2. Single crystal X-ray structure determination
To gain insights concerning precise relative dispositions of the coumarin rings in Cou-Nap, X-ray crystal structure determination was carried out, as was that of Cou-Dur, for comparison (ESI†). The single crystals of suitable quality were successfully grown for both Cou-Nap and Cou-Dur by slow evaporation of their solutions in CHCl3/hexane at room temperature. Fig. 3 shows perspective drawings of the molecular structures of both Cou-Nap and Cou-Dur. As can be seen, one observes that the two coumarin moieties in Cou-Nap are oriented with an angle of inclination (θ1) of 6.1° between the planes of two coumarin moieties. The distances between the centers of the two pyran-2-one rings (d1) and those of the two benzene rings (d2) of the coumarin units of Cou-Nap are 3.68 Å and 3.37 Å, respectively. Further, the centre-to-centre distance (d3) between the double bonds (CC) of the coumarin units is 3.83 Å. It is also noteworthy that the coumarin rings are disposed almost orthogonally to the naphthalene core in Cou-Nap; the dihedral angle (θ2) between them is 68.6°. Similarly, the coumarin ring in Cou-Dur is also oriented orthogonally with respect to the durene ring with a dihedral angle (θ3) of 84.6°.

2.3. Absorption and fluorescence properties
The UV-vis absorption and steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded for the two systems in a variety of nonpolar, polar aprotic and polar protic solvents; the typical concentration was ca. 10 μM (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The absorption bands of Cou-Nap and Cou-Dur taper off below 380 and 360 nm, respectively. While Cou-Dur exhibits a two-band feature in all the solvents, the absorptions of Cou-Nap in different solvents are characterized by bathochromically shifted broad bands in the region between 260 and 370 nm with substantially higher molar extinction coefficients. Interestingly, the absorption maxima for both mono- and bis-coumarin undergo a marginal red shift on going from nonpolar to polar solvents.

Insofar as the fluorescence is concerned, Cou-Nap exhibits broad emission bands in the range between 350 and 650 nm in different solvents with considerably red-shifted maxima when compared to those observed for Cou-Dur. Notably, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is significantly larger for emission from Cou-Nap (ca. 92 nm) than that for Cou-Dur (ca. 70 nm) in methanol. Further, the former exhibits a remarkable solvent-dependent shift in the fluorescence maximum, while the latter displays no such dependence. As can be seen from the data in Table 1, the fluorescence maximum for Cou-Dur shifts only marginally by ca. 11 nm on going from cyclohexane (383 nm) to methanol (394 nm). In contrast, one observes a progressively large bathochromic shift and a broad emission peak for Cou-Nap on going from cyclohexane (392 nm) to acetonitrile (420 nm) to methanol (452 nm). Notably, a comparison of the Stokes shifts in cyclohexane, acetonitrile and methanol reveals that the differences are unremarkable (ca. 71–79 nm) for Cou-Dur, while they vary significantly for Cou-Nap, from 68 to 124 nm for a change of the solvent from cyclohexane to methanol.
To gauge the fluorescence efficiency of bis-coumarin relative to that of the mono-coumarin, the quantum yields of fluorescence (λexc = 330 nm) were determined in cyclohexane, acetonitrile and methanol (Table 1). A perusal of the data in Table 1 shows that the fluorescence efficiencies of Cou-Dur are negligibly small (0.59% in cyclohexane to 1.14% in methanol) in all the three solvents. It is noteworthy that the parent coumarin is also known to fluoresce very weakly with quantum yields of ca. 0.03% in cyclohexane and 0.2% in dioxane/H2O (1:4, v/v).23 In stark contrast, bis-coumarin Cou-Nap displays a remarkably higher fluorescence quantum yield, which varies from 6.7% in cyclohexane to 38% in acetonitrile and to as high as 50% in methanol. Clearly, the cofacial arrangement of the two coumarin fluorophores in Cou-Nap manifests in significantly modified excited-state properties when compared to those of both Cou-Dur and the parent coumarin.
2.4. Singlet lifetimes from time-resolved fluorescence studies
Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out by time-correlated single photon counting in three different solvents, namely, cyclohexane, acetonitrile and methanol, to examine the singlet lifetimes of both Cou-Nap and Cou-Dur. The fluorescence decay traces in different solvents are shown in Fig. 5. The lifetimes are collected in Table 1, which shows that the singlet lifetimes of Cou-Dur range between 0.84 and 1.43 ns in different solvents. Notably, the parent coumarin is also characterized by a very short fluorescence lifetime of ca. 0.1 ns.23 In contrast, Cou-Nap exhibits considerably longer fluorescence lifetimes with a gradual enhancement with increasing solvent polarity. The lifetime varies from 0.85 ns in cyclohexane to 2.72 ns in acetonitrile and to as high as 5.38 ns in methanol. This signifies progressive stabilization of the excited state of Cou-Nap with the increasing polarity of the solvent.
 Fig. 5  Fluorescence lifetime decay traces of Cou-Nap (left) and Cou-Dur (right) in various solvents. 
To assess competing relaxation pathways that depopulate the singlet-excited states, radiative (kr) and nonradiative (knr) decay constants were determined in various solvents, cf.Table 1. Accordingly, a gradual diminution is observed in the nonradiative decay constant with the increasing solvent polarity. Interestingly, the knr decay constants are significantly lower for Cou-Nap when compared to those for Cou-Dur and the parent coumarin (knr ≥ 10.0 ns−1).23 The effect, indeed, is more pronounced in polar solvents in which the nonradiative decay rate constants are ca. 4–7 fold slower for Cou-Nap than for Cou-Dur.
2.5. Solvatochromism and determination of ground and excited state dipole moments
In general, a difference in the ground (μg) and excited-state (μe) dipole moments is observed for any system when changes occur in the electron densities in the two states.26,27 Accordingly, polarity, dielectric constant and polarizability of the solvents stabilize the ground and excited states differently leading to spectral shifts. As mentioned earlier, bis-coumarin Cou-Nap exhibits pronounced solvatochromic shifts, i.e., solvent-induced changes in Stokes shifts. For more insights into the excited-state behavior of Cou-Nap, the ground (μg) and excited state (μe) dipole moments were determined using the ‘solvatochromic method’.26,27 The latter involves linear correlations of the spectral shifts with the solvent polarity functions, namely, f1, f2 and Reichardt's parameter (ENT)28 using the Bakshiev formulation, Chamma and Viallet equations and the empirical relation developed by Radhakrishnan et al.,26,27cf. ESI.† A perusal of the spectral shift data in Table 2 shows that the absorption maximum of Cou-Nap remains almost the same in different solvents, while the fluorescence maximum undergoes a progressive bathochromic shift with increasing solvent polarity. Accordingly, the slopes (S1, S2 and m, Fig. 6) of the linear regression fits of solvatochromic shifts with various polarity functions (f1, f2 and ENT, respectively) and the Onsager radius (calculated from the van der Waals volume)29 of the molecule were employed to determine the ground (μg = 0.72 D) and excited state (μe = 4.04 D) dipole moments, cf. ESI.† These values attest to the fact that the singlet-excited state of Cou-Nap is highly polar (ca. 5.6-fold) when compared to the ground state. Thus, the observed red shift in the fluorescence maximum in a more polar solvent is completely in agreement with the polar nature of the excited state. In contrast, the emission maximum is least affected by different solvents in the case of Cou-Dur, which signifies a rather less polar excited state.

2.6. Temperature-dependent fluorescence properties of Cou-Nap
To further probe the nonradiative pathways that depopulate the singlet-excited state, the influence of temperature on the steady-state fluorescence properties of Cou-Nap was investigated in different solvents, namely, cyclohexane (nonpolar), acetonitrile (polar aprotic) and methanol (polar protic). Indeed, the fluorescence intensity was found to be strongly temperature dependent in a nonpolar solvent such as cyclohexane. As shown in Fig. 7, one observes a drastic diminution in the fluorescence intensity of Cou-Nap in cyclohexane (λmax = 392 nm) with increasing temperature. Spurred by this observation, quantum yields of fluorescence (Φf) were determined in cyclohexane at different temperatures in the range of 283–333 K. Thus, the quantum yield was found to decrease from ca. 14% at 283 K to 6.7% at 298 K and to 1.8% at 333 K. In fact, the diminution in the quantum yield with absolute temperature (T in K) could be fitted to a monoexponential function with an excellent goodness-of-fit (R2 = 0.99), cf.Fig. 8.

 Fig. 8  Variation of the fluorescence quantum yield of Cou-Nap in cyclohexane as a function of temperature (left) and Arrhenius-type plot for determination of the activation energy for nonradiative decay from the singlet-excited state in cyclohexane (right). 
Based on the definition of Φf and the assumption that the radiative decay constant (kr) is in general temperature independent,30 we may reason that the temperature effect on Φf values in cyclohexane must arise from some competitive activation-controlled radiationless pathways (knr). The temperature dependence of Φf in cyclohexane can indeed be expressed in the form of an Arrhenius-type equation (eqn (1) and (2)) as shown below:30b (1) (2)where k0nr is the pre-exponential factor and ΔE is the activation energy.
The plot of ln{(1/Φf) − 1} versus 1/T is linear with an excellent correlation of R2 = 0.99, cf.Fig. 8. Accordingly, the activation energy (ΔE) – determined from the slope – turns out to be 8.3 kcal K−1 mol−1 for the radiationless deactivation of the singlet in cyclohexane. The pre-exponential factor was calculated from the intercept to be 13.63 × 1014 s−1. In contrast, the fluorescence of Cou-Nap was found to be virtually unaffected in polar solvents such as acetonitrile and methanol in the temperature range of 283–333 K, cf. ESI.† This clearly suggests that the activation-controlled relaxation mechanism operative in cyclohexane does not prevail for Cou-Nap in acetonitrile and methanol.
2.7. Mechanistic considerations of solvent- and temperature-dependent excited-state properties
In general, the type of substituent as well as the pattern of substitution and nature of the solvent are known to influence the photophysical properties of coumarins remarkably.22,23 For instance, an unsubstituted coumarin exhibits very weak fluorescence with a negligibly small quantum yield (ca. 10−4) as mentioned earlier, whereas 7-diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin shows a highly enhanced fluorescence emission with a quantum yield of ca. 0.79 in ethanol.31 This has been attributed to the fact that electron-donating groups facilitate charge transfer in the excited states leading to intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) states, which decay by strong fluorescence emission.32 A similar effect is also observed for electron-rich aromatic rings, e.g., anthryl rings, as has been shown recently by Fukuzumi and coworkers.32 A remarkable enhancement in the fluorescence quantum yield of coumarin has been demonstrated when the 9-anthryl group is substituted at the C7 position of the coumarin. It is believed that “the fluorescence transition probability may be enhanced, as the ICT transition state involves an allowed π–π* transition in the aromatic component”.32
Comprehensive investigations on the photophysics of coumarins have led to the following two generalizations.23 One, the S1 state is of n,π* character for the parent coumarin, which permits significant nonradiative relaxation leading to poor fluorescence quantum yield. Second, substitution of the coumarin nucleus and/or an increase in solvent polarity reduce(s) the S2(π,π*)–S1(n,π*) energy gap, which causes mixing of these two states, leading ultimately to state-switching, whereby S1 becomes π,π* in character.
Based on the above considerations, we may now rationalize the low quantum yield of fluorescence and the temperature-dependent activation-controlled emission behavior of Cou-Nap in the nonpolar cyclohexane solvent. It is apparent from the fluorescence emission maxima that the energy of the singlet-excited state (S1) is significantly high (72.94 kcal mol−1). Thus, the nonradiative relaxation pathways that directly depopulate the molecules from singlet-excited state to the ground state should be expected to be inefficient with fluorescence as the major channel. It is intriguing that the fluorescence quantum yield is rather lower in cyclohexane than in a polar protic solvent such as methanol. Given that the radiative decay in cyclohexane is temperature independent, some other process competes to depopulate the singlet-excited states in cyclohexane. Intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet state can be a viable process in view of the fact that spin–orbit coupling (SOC) promotes the former for singlet states with n,π* character. Indeed, a well-known mechanism for temperature-dependent emission behavior is thermally activated ISC from S1 → Tn (n ≠ 1).33 Thus, we sought to establish the energetic proximity of the triple state with the singlet-excited state. The phosphorescence emission spectrum of Cou-Nap (λmax = 525 nm in cyclohexane at 77 K) reveals that the triplet energy (for 0–0 transition) is 54.46 kcal mol−1, cf. ESI.† This attests to the fact that T1 is indeed energetically too displaced from S1. To account for poor fluorescence emission in cyclohexane when compared to that in methanol, let us consider the energetic ordering of singlet and triplet states as shown in Fig. 9. We believe that higher vibrational energy levels of S1 are proximal to one of the Tn states (n ≠ 1), but that ISC is endothermic from the lowest vibrational energy level of S1. In such a scenario, thermally populated molecules in the S1 state may undergo ISC to the triplet state, whereby this process may become a chief pathway for singlet relaxation to account for poor fluorescence quantum yield. Further, as the temperature should increase the population of molecules in the higher vibrational energy levels of S1, ISC should be expected to become more efficient to account for the observed decrease in fluorescence efficiency with increasing temperature.
 Fig. 9  The proposed energetic ordering of the electronic states of Cou-Nap in nonpolar and polar solvents to account for the observed excited-state behavior. 
The fact that the fluorescence quantum yield in a solvent such as methanol is very high, despite a comparatively lower singlet excitation energy (63.25 kcal mol−1) than in cyclohexane, should be understood from the fact that the excited-state character of S1 is π,π*, for which the ISC is forbidden and the fluorescence becomes a major pathway of relaxation. Given this scenario, the emission behavior of S1 in polar solvents should be expected to be temperature independent, as is found.
2.8. Influence of ‘phane effect’ on the photophysical properties of Cou-Nap
As evident from the foregoing discussion, Cou-Nap exhibits highly enhanced fluorescence quantum yield, longer singlet lifetime, substantially lower nonradiative decay rates and superior solvatochromic Stokes shifts when compared to the parent coumarin as well as Cou-Dur. The origin of these exceptional excited-state properties should be traceable to the structural attributes. As mentioned earlier, in view of the fact that the coumarin units are almost orthogonal to the aryl rings (i.e., naphthalene and durene) in Cou-Nap and Cou-Dur, meaningful electronic communication between them via resonance should not be expected.34 Thus, the cofacial arrangement of the two coumarin units must be responsible for the observed photophysical properties of Cou-Nap when compared to those of Cou-Dur. As revealed from the X-ray determined molecular structure, the distance between the two cofacially-oriented coumarin moieties is within 3.8 Å. Photoexcitation of Cou-Nap with two proximate coumarins should, in principle, lead to intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition. However, our persistent efforts to isolate the cycloadduct were in vain even after several hours of photoirradiation, cf. ESI.† This is in stark contrast to a number of [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions in the solid state, which occur when the proximity of two reacting double bonds is within a maximum distance of ca. 4.2 Å, as demonstrated by Gerhard Schmidt.35 We may postulate that the [2+2] cycloaddition does presumably occur, but that the product is unstable due to the two coumarin rings being constrained by covalent bonds at 1,8 positions of the naphthalene. In other words, anchoring of two coumarin units to the naphthalene scaffold presumably destabilizes the cyclobutane adduct produced upon photolysis, leading to regeneration of the two free coumarins instantaneously; it should be noted that the conversion of sp2 carbons to sp3 centres in the cycloadduct will necessitate considerable structural reorganization. If the cycloaddition and subsequent rapid reversion were to occur, the fluorescence quantum yield should be expected to decrease significantly. The observed quantum yield in methanol is contrary to the expectation based on this pathway. What then promotes remarkably efficient fluorescence decay?
As revealed by the X-ray crystal structure, we believe that through-space π-interaction of the kind prevalent in cyclophanes and termed specially ‘phane effect’ should be operative between the two coumarin moieties in Cou-Nap. Effective overlap of π-orbitals in the cofacially oriented systems should be expected to manifest in the absorption as well as emission phenomena. A comparison of the absorption spectra of Cou-Dur, a reference compound, and Cou-Nap shows that the absorption of the latter is marginally red shifted with a substantially higher molar extinction coefficient and modification of the structural features. Likewise, the emission is significantly red shifted and broad with a FWHM of ca. 92 nm for Cou-Nap as compared to 70 nm for the emission of Cou-Dur. Thus, the two coumarin units in Cou-Nap seemingly behave as a single chromophoric system with the loss of the properties of individual coumarin moieties and with its own characteristic singlet-excited state properties. This is further corroborated by the fact that the fluorescence spectra of Cou-Nap in different solvents do not feature any excimer emission, despite a close proximity (ca. 3.4–3.8 Å) between the two cofacial coumarin units. These results clearly substantiate how ‘phane effect’ in the form of through-space π-interaction modifies the photophysical properties of a coumarin fluorophore; as discussed earlier, although intramolecular charge transfer from the naphthalene core to the singlet-excited coumarin leading to the ICT state, which promotes radiative decay, could be a possibility, we consider the contribution from such a process to be only marginal, for a similar effect should manifest in the case of Cou-Dur, a model system, which is not observed. Thus, operation of ‘phane effect’, which is truly limited to cyclophanes, is demonstrated herein, for the first time, for a non-cyclophane system.
3. Experimental section

All the solvents were distilled prior to use. All the reactions were monitored by analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) using commercial aluminum sheets pre-coated with silica gel. Column chromatography was conducted on silica gel (60–120 mesh). NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent. IR spectra were recorded on an FT-IR spectrophotometer. The ESI mass spectra were recorded on an ESI-QTOF machine.

The required starting materials, namely, 1,8-diiodonaphthalene21 and 3-bromodurene,25 were prepared according to the reported procedures. The details of synthesis of other compounds are described below.

7-Trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy-4-methylcoumarin (1)24. 
A two-necked round-bottom flask was charged with a mixture of 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin24 (3.00 g, 17.01 mmol), triethylamine (10 mL) and dry DCM (60 mL). Subsequently, trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (5.76 g, 20.40 mmol) was added dropwise over 5 min at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 10 °C for 3 h under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. After this period, the reaction mixture was quenched with ice and the organic matter was extracted with DCM 2–3 times. The combined extract was subsequently dried over anhyd Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a crude mixture. Silica gel column chromatography of the latter using 10% ethyl acetate in hexane furnished the pure product as a colorless solid in 90% yield (4.71 g). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ 2.45 (d, J = 0.9 Hz, 3H), 6.33 (d, J = 1.3 Hz, 1H), 7.21–7.27 (m, 2H), 7.69 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 1H).


7-(4,4,5,5-Tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-4-methylcoumarin (2). 
To a two-necked round-bottom flask charged with a mixture of 7-trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy-4-methylcoumarin (3.0 g, 9.73 mmol), bis(pinacolato)diboron (3.21 g, 12.66 mmol) and KOAc (1.43 g, 14.59 mmol) in dioxane (40 mL) was added to Pd(dppf)Cl2·CH2Cl2 (0.39 g, 0.48 mmol) under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 85 °C for 10 h. After completion of the reaction, it was cooled down to room temperature, the contents were stripped off the solvent and the organic matter was extracted with chloroform. The combined extract was washed with brine, dried over anhyd Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a crude mixture. Silica gel column chromatography of the latter using 10% ethyl acetate in hexane furnished the pure product as a colorless solid in 80% yield (2.23 g). Mp. 138–140 °C; IR (KBr) cm−1 2980, 2929, 1737, 1626, 1441, 1340, 1144; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ 1.33 (s, 12H), 2.41 (d, J = 0.9 Hz, 3H), 6.28 (d, J = 1.4 Hz, 1H), 7.54 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1H), 7.65 (dd, J1 = 7.8 Hz, J2 = 0.9 Hz, 1H), 7.69 (s, 1H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ 18.4, 24.7, 84.2, 115.8, 121.7, 122.7, 123.6, 129.8, 151.9, 152.6, 160.5; ESI-MS+m/z calcd for C16H20BO4 287.1455 [M + H]+, found 287.1459.

The reaction mixture was then stirred at 100 °C for 24 h. After completion of the reaction, it was cooled down to room temperature and the contents were extracted with chloroform. Subsequently, the organic extract was washed thoroughly with distilled water, dried over anhyd Na2SO4, filtered and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude mixture was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 25% ethyl acetate in hexane to furnish pure Cou-Nap as a colorless crystalline solid in 78% yield (0.36 g).

3.3. Single crystal X-ray structure determination
The X-ray diffraction intensity data collection for the single crystals of both the coumarins was carried out using an APEX-II CCD detector system equipped with a Mo-sealed Siemens ceramic diffraction tube (λ = 0.7107 Å) and a highly oriented graphite monochromator operating at 50 kV and 30 mA. The data were collected in a hemisphere mode and processed using Bruker's SAINT program. The structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXL package and refined by the full matrix least-squares method based on F2 using the SHELXL-2014 program (Sheldrick, 2014). The hydrogens were fixed geometrically, treated as riding on their nonhydrogens, and refined isotropically, while all nonhydrogens were subjected to anisotropic refinement. CCDC 1509578 (Cou-Nap) and 1509579 (Cou-Dur) contain the supplementary X-ray crystallographic data for this paper.
3.4. UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy
All the spectroscopic measurements were carried out in spectroscopic grade solvents under air at 298 K. UV-vis absorption and steady-state fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a double-beam spectrophotometer and a spectrofluorometer, respectively, both with an accuracy of ±1 nm. The spectroscopic investigations were performed with dilute solutions (ca. 10 μM) to avoid complications arising from possible self-aggregation. The purity of the two compounds was confirmed by recording the excitation spectra with respect to three different emission wavelengths. Quantum yields of fluorescence were determined using an integrating sphere connected to the spectrofluorometer (λexc = 330 nm). The temperature-dependent fluorescence studies were carried out with the help of a temperature-control bath built within the spectrofluorometer. Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy was conducted by time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) under air using picosecond pulsed diode lasers (λexc = 375 for Cou-Nap and 300 nm for Cou-Dur) for excitation. The instrument response function (IRF) was measured by using a scatterer and the decays were fitted by using reconvolution software supplied with the instrument. All the photophysical parameters reported are based on at least three independent measurements.
4. Conclusions
We have inquired into the effect of though-space π–π interaction between cofacially oriented aryl rings on the excited-state properties of a bis-coumarin system, i.e., Cou-Nap, which is created by functionalization of naphthalenes at 1,8 positions with the well-known coumarin fluorophores. It is shown that Cou-Nap does not undergo the anticipated [2 + 2] photocycloaddition despite the fact that the distance between the double bonds is ca. 3.8 Å. However, it exhibits exceptional excited-state properties in that the observed fluorescence quantum yields and singlet lifetimes are remarkably higher (Φfca. 50% and τfca. 5.4 ns) when compared to those of the parent coumarin (Φfca. 10−4 and τfca. 0.1 ns) and Cou-Dur (Φfca. 1.1% and τfca. 1.4 ns), a mono-coumarin model system. Further, Cou-Nap exhibits intriguing temperature-dependent emission in a nonpolar solvent such as cyclohexane. The observed photophysical properties are reconciled based on the ‘phane effect’ that is operative in cyclophanes, wherein effective π–π interaction essentially modifies the chromophoric attributes that cannot be associated with the interacting individual aromatic rings. The temperature-dependent emission is rationalized based on thermally activated ISC from the singlet-excited state to one of the higher energy triplet states. The results constitute, for the first time, the demonstration of modification of the excited-state properties of a fluorophore in a non-cyclophane system via the ‘phane effect’.
