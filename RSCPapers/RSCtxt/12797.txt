    , Accepted 17th February 2012First published on 6th March 2012AbstractThe major light-harvesting chlorophyll (Chl) a/b-binding protein of photosystem II (LHCIIb) in plants is the most abundant membrane protein on earth. During the evolution of photosynthesis over more than 3.4 billion years, this light harvesting system has developed the most effective membrane protein for harnessing solar energy. Because of its high efficiency in absorbing and transferring solar energy, LHCIIb is becoming more and more attractive for mankind's effort to utilize solar energy. Here, we demonstrate the integration of LHCIIb with a P3HT/PCBM bulk heterojunction, in which a P3HT/PCBM active layer, instead of the “reaction centers” in photosystem II (PSII), absorbs the energy transfer from LHCIIb, consequently enhancing the solar energy utilization effectively in solid-state photovoltaic devices. The electronic integration into devices, achieved by inserting a layer of LHCIIb and then coating with a P3HT/PCBM active layer, can remain stable for several weeks. The energy transfer from LHCIIb to P3HT plays an important role in the increase in photocurrent density and broadens the solar absorption spectrum of the control device. The fabricated photovoltaic cells with an LHCIIb interfacial layer achieved an approximately 30% enhancement in the photocurrent and internal quantum efficiencies. Although the heat inactivation effect of the device limits the optimization of the normal structure, the pre-annealing treatment of the inverted organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is used to realize an improvement in the photoconversion performance.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), comprising a phase separated mixture with interpenetrating networks of conjugated polymers (donor) and fullerene derivatives (acceptor), are a focus of research directed towards the low cost conversion of sunlight to electricity.1 Several methods for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ solar cells are known to be effective, including the design and synthesis of new low band gap materials, thermal annealing and solvent annealing, to improve the nanoscale morphology, and the implementation of innovative interfacial materials.2
In higher plants and green algae, the major light-harvesting chlorophyll (Chl) a/b-binding protein of photosystem II (LHCIIb) is the most abundant membrane protein and binds about half of the Chls in the thylakoid. The structure of LHCIIb has been resolved at near atomic resolution,3 which shows that the LHCIIb trimer (functional form in vivo) is composed of three homo- or heteromonomers. Each monomer binds 14 Chls (8 Chl a, 6 Chl b), 4 carotenoid molecules and 2 lipids. LHCIIb is a kind of multifunctional complex, which, besides absorbing sunlight and delivering excitation energy to the PSII core complex “reaction centers”, also functions in the adaptation process under excess light conditions. LHCIIb very elegantly sustains the pigment configuration for efficient energy transfer, which makes LHCIIb very effective for absorbing and transferring solar energy, in spite of the high pigment density in the complexes.4 Energy transfer within trimeric LHCIIb is rapid and leaves most of the excitation energy delocalized over a few Chl a molecules with a lower energy in the periphery of the complex.5 Thus, if the complexes can be integrated with solid state electronics, LHCII might offer an attractive architecture for future generations of circuitry where the molecular components are organized by a macromolecular scaffold. For utilization in practical technological devices, they must be stabilized and integrated with solid-state electronics. Like other protein molecular complexes, LHCII is a soft material, optimized for operation in a lipid bilayer interface between aqueous solutions. Under overirradiation conditions, LHCIIb is protected from the harmful singlet oxygen which would be scavenged with the help of carotenoids.
In the pioneering work of Paulsen and co-workers, an artificial 2D arrangement of LHCIIb complexes by attaching them to a solid surface was established and the intercomplex energy transfer has been demonstrated.6 This is a prerequisite for using these or similar protein complexes in devices such as photovoltaic applications as efficient light harvesters for conducting excitation energy. Moreover, most of the energy transfer processes between neighboring pigment–protein complexes are lateral, within the 2D arrangement of complexes within the membrane, rather than transversal between the membrane layers in the stacked thylakoid domains.7 All of these properties make LHCIIb highly interesting as a potential light-harvesting component in optoelectronic devices such as organic photovoltaic cells. Although solid evidence for this proposal is still lacking, we expect that a thin LHCIIb layer inserted between the anode and cathode in a BHJ can function as a layer to harvest the solar spectrum more efficiently.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1A shows the optical absorption and emission spectra features for the LHCIIb in a dilution buffered to 10 μg ml−1 Chl and 1 μg ml−1 Chl for the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra, respectively. The Chl a/b ratio of the LHCIIb complex is about 1.3 and the absorption spectra of LHCIIb are measured at room temperature with an absorption maxima at about 675 nm (Qy region) and the peak 436 nm (Soret region) is mainly due to Chl a. The peaks near 650 nm and 471 nm are due to Chl b, while LHCIIb exhibits one emission peak at 680 nm with no visible fluorescence emission from Chl b at the shorter wavelength, 660 nm, in the low temperature fluorescence emission spectra, indicating the complete energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a.8 All of the data show the characteristics of a native LHCIIb preparation. It should be noted that a wide absorption range in the visible region is generally required to achieve a highly efficient solar light-to-current conversion. When the LHCIIb layer is inserted over P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w), the absorption spectrum of the bilayer film is efficiently covered over the entire visible region from 300 nm to 700 nm, which would result in the enhanced light harvesting of solar energy. It is highly desirable that the optical absorption of the LHCIIb film matches P3HT and supplements the absorption range mainly from 400–480 nm and 600–700 nm. The pure cast thin films of LHCIIb and active layer (P3HT/PCBM), and the LHCIIb/active layer bilayer films are overviewed in Fig. 1B.

The bulk heterojunction PSCs are fabricated with a device structure (Fig. 2A) according to the method similar to previous reports (details in supporting information†).9 As an efficient buffer layer, the water-soluble fabrication of LHCII b can guarantee that the electrode withstands the organic solvent exposure, with the functioning of PEDOT:PSS. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) studies have shown that the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface is not stable and previous studies revealed PEDOT:PSS to be an inefficient electron-blocking layer due to electron leakage at the anode.10 Therefore, the large bandgap of LHCII b could provide a sufficient energy barrier for electron-blocking. To accurately evaluate the PCEs of the photovoltaic devices, it is essential to determine the energy levels of the materials correctly. Fig. 2B displays the electronic energy level diagram of the device components, as well as the device structure of the P3HT/PCBM-based solar cell in which the blend film of P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w) is the photoactive layer of the device.11 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of LHCIIb is determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry. The relative LHCIIb energy levels and Soret energy level are taken from the literature, which is associated with the UV-vis absorption onset.12

(d) The current–voltage characteristics of photovoltaic cells based on devices including a total thylakoid pigment layer (B: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Pigments/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al) without protein under standard AM 1.5 irradiation. 

Fig. 2C presents the J–V characteristics of the P3HT/PCBM-based solar cells with or without a LHCIIb thin layer under AM1.5G illumination at an incident intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The device (Control I: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al) exhibited an open-circuit voltage Voc of 0.58 V, a short-circuit current density Jsc of 3.27 mA cm−2, a fill factor FF of 42.9%, and a power conversion efficiency PCE of 0.81%. We found that the insertion of a thin LHCIIb layer between the PEDOT:PSS and the BHJ layer (device A: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/LHCIIb/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al) improves the cell performance. As expected, the presence of an extra LHCIIb (40 nm) layer had a small negative effect on the FF, but, interestingly, greatly increased the photocurrent of the device by approximately 36% to 4.44 mA cm−2 and slightly improved the Voc to 0.64 V, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 1.17%. Over ten devices were tested of the cells using LHCIIb as the underlayer and they had an average PCE of 1.12 ± 0.10%. There is one reasonable explanation for this enhancement: the LHCIIb absorbs sunlight and delivers excitation energy to those P3HT molecules that are distributed near the bottom of the P3HT:PCBM film, thus increasing the rate of generation of free carriers and the photocurrent density.13 The photovoltaic parameters calculated from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. As the film thickness of the LHCIIb increases to the 60 nm, the existence of protein has a negative effect on the short-circuit current, which may be caused by the fact that the LHCIIb does not function as a charge selective and transport layer for hole collection. Besides, the aggregation of LHCIIb leads to the increasing of the series resistance (Rs) in the device, and thus causes both the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor FF to decrease.

Moreover, when the LHCIIb is replaced by total thylakoid pigment (free Chl a/b and carotenoids extracted from LHCIIb by organic solvent), we fabricated the device B with a similar structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Pigments/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al. However, few photoinduced carriers are observed in both 30 nm and 60 nm thickness interface layers (Fig. 2D). Most of the energy transfer processes between neighboring LHCIIb-P3HT complexes are lateral, within the 2D arrangement of complexes in the device, rather than transversal between the membrane layers in the stacked thylakoid domains. This difference provides a basis for the understanding and interpretation of the energy transfer process within the free pigment and the pigment–protein complex interactions. Interestingly, it should be noted that a low number of photoinduced carriers between P3HT and the free pigment was observed with an unstable oscillation in the J–V behavior, which is consistent with the observations of Yun et al.14 It appears that the changing of the internal electric field after inserting the pigment layer leads to the difference in the open-circuit voltage.
In this system, LHCIIb may play the function of the dye molecules, which are blended with the component in BHJ solar cells to absorb the solar light at wavelengths that the original donor and acceptor materials cannot harvest.15 In fact, in plant photosynthesis, LHCIIb is involved in light harvesting and the transportation of excitation energy towards the so-called reaction centers of PSI and PSII (acceptor parts), only where the charge separation takes place. In the LHCIIb system (a part of plant photosynthesis), very strong interactions between Chl molecules correspond to extremely fast equilibration times (femtosecond level). Therefore, it is assumed that within LHCII, ultrafast events occur, and it is difficult to get electron transfer from LHCIIb to P3HT or PCBM. In view of this, different layer structures with a combination of LHCIIb, P3HT and PCBM layers are prepared to measure the fluorescence intensity change. As shown in Fig. 3, the LHCIIb emission intensity is sensitive to the acceptor part and there is almost no emission quenching in the presence of the PCBM acceptor. Furthermore, the device based on the LHCIIb/PCBM blends showed no photovoltaic response. However, for P3HT, intermolecular energy transfer occurs and increases with the area of the layer contact. Consequently, we have studied the photoluminescence (PL) and performed theoretical studies of the LHCIIb/P3HT thin films. PL spectra of the pristine LHCIIb and P3HT films and their bilayer film are shown in Fig. 4A. The energy transfer between the donor LHCIIb and the acceptor P3HT can be demonstrated from the emission spectrum. Upon the addition of P3HT, the emission maximum of the donor fluorescence at 680 nm drops by about 47%. Therefore, the apparent efficiency of the energy transfer between LHCIIb and the acceptor P3HT, calculated as E = 1 − (donor fluorescence intensity in the presence of the acceptor/donor fluorescence intensity in the absence of the acceptor), is about 47%.16 To confirm the PL quenching of LHCIIb and avoid the excitation in P3HT, shorter excitation wavelengths (300 nm, 330 nm and 360 nm) are set for emission. The enhancement of the 648 nm emission (P3HT emission peak) with increasing excitation wavelength indicates the increase in the energy transfer at the interface (Fig. 4B), because a longer excitation wavelength leads to more excitons for energy transfer from LHCIIb to the acceptor. Another source of demonstration (Fig. 5) is provided by confocal laser scanning microscope images (CLSM). The polarizing optical microscopic images demonstrate the optical property changes of LHCIIb when the P3HT film is further spin coated on it. The introduction of the P3HT thin film plays an important role by adjusting the fluorescence characteristics in the LHCIIb complex, demonstrating that the intracomplex energy transfer from LHCIIb to P3HT takes place according to the proposed mechanism in Fig. 6A. Similar to the photosystems II process, this pigment–protein complex absorbs light in much of the visible spectral range and is able to transfer the excitation energy rapidly (in the picosecond range) and at a high quantum efficiency to neighboring light-harvesting complexes and then towards the LHCIIb/P3HT area. The “reaction center” is the P3HT/PCBM active layer, which is involved in charge separation, and the extra energy transferred from LHCIIb results in the photocurrent increasing, while energy transfer in complex biological and organic chemical systems can involve quantum coherence.17

The intensity is normalized against the peak emission intensity of pure LHCIIb film and all the various films are prepared with the same conditions to maintain a similar film thickness.

The insets show corresponding polarizing optical microscopic images of the LHCIIb and LHCIIb/P3HT films on quartz plates.

(b) Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices without a LHCIIb layer (Control I) and with a LHCIIb layer (A) at various thicknesses. The inset shows the normalized spectra of the device A (LHCIIb: 40 nm) and Control I. 
To further confirm the accuracy of the measurements, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices based on device A were performed (Fig. 6B). The enhancement of the energy conversion efficiencies, which are about 30% higher than those of the control cell, parallels the IPCE curves’ behavior. This finding further supports the result that the presence of the interfacial LHCIIb layer transfers the energy to the “reaction center”, the P3HT/PCBM layer, as represented in the schematic (Fig. 6A). The IPCE spectra reflect the changes observed in the absorption spectra, with a significant increase at about 440 nm being observed after the insertion of the LHCIIb layer. Associated with the broader optical absorption, the inset normalized spectra of the IPCE spectra demonstrated the same functioning of the LHCIIb layer.
During device fabrication, self-assembled layers of the LHCIIb complexes must survive both a washing step, to remove surplus nonspecifically bound materials, and a drying step, to prepare the substrate for deposition of the semiconducting coating. The complexity and size of LHCIIb makes it especially sensitive to degradation and dissociation. The stability of LHCIIb and the corresponding device A is assessed in Fig. 7 using its fluorescent spectrum and normalized power conversion efficiency, respectively. Even at low temperatures, in the absence of stabilizing peptides, the dried films of Chl exhibit a new fluorescence emission at 650 nm. In contrast, incubating the LHCIIb film is found to almost entirely preserve the low-temperature fluorescence spectrum of LHCIIb (Fig. 7a). The λ = 680 nm fluorescence peak of the stabilized films stored in an ambient environment exhibited a gradual blue shift over several weeks, indicative of gradual structural changes in the light harvesting complex. To test the device stability (Fig. 7b), the PCEs of the solar cells A (with 40 nm LHCIIb) are periodically measured for 500 h to monitor their long term stability. Under dark conditions, device A retains over 50% of the magnitude of its original PCE value after being exposed to ambient conditions for 20 days. In sharp contrast, the performance of the device with the LHCIIb layer decays very rapidly under illuminated conditions. Most notably, when the entire device was annealed above 50 °C, the PV signals of all the devices with the LHCIIb layer disappeared because of the inactivation of LHCIIb. This observation casts a clear contrast between the devices with and without a protein layer. Nevertheless, the overall cell performance is relatively poor due to the lack of annealing of the active layer.18

(b) Normalized PCEs as a function of time for device A stored for 500 h in ambient conditions under illumination (100 mW cm−2) and dark conditions. 
The poor results for the original devices without treatment may be attributed to the fact that the rapid quenching of the solvent disrupts the planar conformation and ordering of the P3HT chains. However, if the growth rate of the active layer from solution to solid state is controlled, the intrinsic driving force for self-organization of P3HT can lead to the recovery of the ordered structure. The optimum morphology for the active layer of the PSCs can also be promoted successfully at room temperature, through the control of the drying time of the active layer, that is, by “solvent annealing”.19 Therefore, the performance of the devices can be improved without inactivating the protein. To control the film growth rate or, in other words, by controlling the time it takes for the wet films to solidify, a high boiling point solvent (DCB) and a low spin-coating speed are chosen to leave the films wet and then they were dried in covered glass Petri dishes. The solvent evaporation time increases from 5 s (fast growth, CB and high spin-coating speed) to 30 min (slow growth), details in supporting information.† Satisfactorily, the J–V performance and PCE of the Control I devices is up to 3.52%, which is similar to reported results.20 We compare the characteristics of devices incorporating the LHCIIb layer in Fig. 8. The Jsc increases from 9.77 to 12.25 mA cm−2, and the Voc also has a slight increase from 0.592 to 0.631 V, while the FF remains at a high level, above 60% for the 30 nm thickness LHCIIb. Therefore, the devices A after solvent annealing give the highest average PCE of 4.74%, and also about a 30% enhancement when compared with the Control I devices. Based on 10 devices of the same kind (the same film growth time), the efficiency variation is 4.5 ± 0.2%. To our knowledge, these values are the highest reported for P3HT photovoltaic devices without thermal annealing. Although better performances of the solvent annealed devices can be achieved after an additional thermal annealing process,21 the protein cannot endure the high temperatures and this may be a small barrier for the application of such natural light-harvesting materials. However, it provides a molecular-level understanding and advanced design of more suitable materials and the structure of OPVs with photosynthetic organisms.

Nevertheless, another way to overcome this drawback is to use the inverted structure where the “preannealed” treatment is introduced before the deposition of LHCIIb. In the inverted PSC devices, air-stable high-work-function Ag metals are used as the anode to collect holes, while ZnO thin films have been used as electron selective layers to improve the electron transport and collect electrons of the ITO cathode.22 The thermal treatment is referred to as the active layer of the ZnO annealed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 120 °C for 10 min before a 60 nm thick Ag (cathode) layer is evaporated on top of the active layer. For the inverted device C with the structure ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/LHCIIb/Ag (cross-section SEM image in Fig. 9a), an increase in Voc of 0.1 V compared to the device (Control II: ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT/Ag) was observed in the J–V characteristics (Fig. 9c), suggesting that the built-in-potential is increased when the LHCIIb layer is inserted. Besides, the improvement of the photocurrent from 9.42 mA cm−2 to 11.98 mA cm−2 after preannealing of device C implies that the insertion of a LHCIIb layer (30 nm) absorbs more photons at the interfacial area between P3HT and LHCIIb from the incident light and the light reflected from the metal electrode.23 This result is consistent with the more significant increase of the LHCIIb absorbance between 400 nm and 480 nm in the IPCE spectra (Fig. 9d) of the inverted device after preannealing treatment. Combined with the solvent annealing, the photovoltaic performance is further enhanced, with the Jsc and FF up to 12.76 mA cm−2 and 56.7%, respectively. To determine the optimum thickness of the LHCIIb layer in the inverted type, we evaluate the differences using IPCE spectra (Fig. S3 in supporting information†). Device current density/voltage (J–V) characteristics and the parameters are listed in Table 2.

Moreover, interface engineering is an alternative approach to improved the performance. An interface with a barrier height of a few tens of mV may result in significant charge accumulation, and thus significant recombination loss and inferior photovoltaic (PV) performance. This suggests that the low FF, which is one of the limiting factors of polymer PV cells, might be solved by properly designing the device structure. Besides, the optimum device can be realized by immobilizing LHCIIb on a self-assembled oriented monolayer in solid-state devices to address the aggregation effect.
Conclusions
Our strategy, evolved within a thin membrane interface, opens up exciting opportunities for increasing the photocurrent by tuning the optical absorptivity and the interfacial area of P3HT/PCBM-based organic photovoltaic solar cells. Both PL spectra and CLSM images have shown that energy transfer occurs at the LHCIIb/P3HT interface. Therefore, the extra energy arising at the LHCIIb/P3HT interface leads to a broader optical absorption in the cell device with an enhanced photocurrent. Additionally, when introduced as an interface layer, the protein substantially increases the built-in-potential of the device, leading to an obvious increasing in the Voc of the cell. As a result of the “thermal-free”, solvent annealing to enhance the crystallinity of P3HT, the PCE values have been improved to about 4.74%, with the Jsc up to 12.25 mA cm−2. Besides, combined with the preannealing method, the inverted structure device is found to improve the PCE from 1.74% to 4.12% after inserting the LHCIIb layer. Although more research is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism regulating the different functions of LHCIIb, these findings are expected to contribute to a molecular-level understanding and the advanced design of more suitable materials and structures for OPVs with photosynthetic organisms.
