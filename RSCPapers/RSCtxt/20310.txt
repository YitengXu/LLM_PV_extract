    AbstractA novel ligand, 5,5′-(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-diyl)-bis(thiophene-2-carboxylic acid) (BTC), and its RuII complex (BTC-1) in which the anchoring group is attached to the thiophene units were developed. Using a low-volatility electrolyte and 3.3 μm mesoporous TiO2 films BTC-1 achieved a solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 6.1%, compared to 4.8% for N719 under the same experimental conditions.
During the past two decades, mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have emerged as promising candidates for practical photovoltaic applications by virtue of their low manufacturing costs and good conversion efficiencies.1 DSSCs with power conversion efficiencies over 10% were initially demonstrated using cis-di(thiocyanato)-bis[2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid] ruthenium(II) (N3) or its bis-tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt counterpart N719 as sensitizers in combination with a thicker titania film (>12–15 μm) and a volatile electrolyte.2 In DSSCs, the sensitizer is one of the critical components as it absorbs sunlight and induces the charge separation process. In order to enhance power conversion efficiencies of DSSCs, it is imperative to design novel sensitizers that exhibit an enhanced molar absorptivity in combination with a red-shifted absorption band compared to standard N719. Extension of the π-conjugation of the ancillary ligand and/or the anchoring ligand can improve the spectral response of corresponding ruthenium sensitizers.3 Therefore, efforts were recently made to increase the molar extinction coefficient of the ruthenium dyes in order to improve their light-harvesting ability. These dyes often contained thiophene derivatives in the ancillary bipyridine ligand.4
With highly absorbing sensitizers it is possible to use thinner TiO2 films in order to generate optimal photocurrents and hence reduce recombination losses. In this communication, we present a novel anchoring ligand with an extended π-conjugated system. Thiophene units were inserted between bipyridine and carboxylate groups in order to red-shift the MLCT transitions and to increase the light-harvesting ability of the ruthenium complex. This is the first time a novel anchoring ligand incorporating thiophene unit for ruthenium dyes is presented.
The new BTC-1 sensitizer, in which the anchoring carboxylic acid group is attached to the thiophene moiety, was prepared according to Scheme 1. Stille-type Pd0-catalyzed coupling of 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine and stannylated thiophene gave bipyridine 1 in 98% yield. Lithiation of 1 using lithium diisopropylamide and subsequent treatment with carbon dioxide gave the corresponding carboxylic acid 2 after acidic workup. The acid 2 was purified by recrystallization from hot DMSO in 90% yield. Homoleptic complex BTC-1 was prepared in a typical one-pot procedure starting from ligand 2 and di-μ-chloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer in DMF followed by addition of ammonium thiocyanate. The crude complex was purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column with methanol as eluent. The structures were verified by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and elemental analysis (see ESI†).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of novel sensitizer BTC-1. 
The electronic absorption spectrum of BTC-1 in DMF is displayed in Fig. 1 and the data are summarized in Table 1. Complex BTC-1 showed broad absorption bands in the 300 to 750 nm region. The two high-energy bands at 287 and 331 nm are due to intra-ligand π–π* transitions. The absorption spectrum of BTC-1 is dominated by metal to ligand charge transfer transitions (MLCT). The lowest energy MLCT band at 563 nm is 28 nm red-shifted compared to the standard N719 sensitizer because of the extension of π-conjugation in the anchoring ligand and increased HOMO energy level.

Importantly, an increase of 72% of the molar extinction coefficient was observed for the longest wavelength MLCT band as a consequence of the insertion of thiophene units to the ligand compared to N719 sensitizer. The emission data of the dyes were obtained in an air-equilibrated DMF solution at 298 K by exciting at the respective low energy MLCT absorption bands, showing a weak emission maximum at 800 nm for BTC-1 and at 794 nm for N719.
HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BTC-1 and N719 were determined from the onset of first oxidation and reduction potentials using cyclic voltammetry (Table 1). The complex showed an oxidation wave at 0.29 V (vs. Fc+/Fc), which is assigned to the oxidation of the RuII center. Compared to the standard N719 dye, the metal center oxidation is cathodically shifted by 100 mV indicating the electron-rich character of the new ligand as a result of the thiophene insertion. Two reversible reduction waves at −1.86 and −2.08 V (vs. Fc+/Fc) can be assigned to successive one electron reductions of the bipyridine ligands. The first cathodic potential of BTC-1 is by 310 mV more positive than that of N719.
The excited state oxidation potential of a sensitizer plays an important role in electron transfer processes. The quasi-Fermi level of the TiO2 photoanode and the redox level of the I3−/I−-based electrolyte are situated at around −4.0 eV and −4.83 eV vs. vacuum, respectively. The HOMO level of BTC-1 is located at −5.29 eV, the LUMO level at −3.34 eV. Overall, the HOMO–LUMO band gap of BTC-1 (Eg = 1.95 eV) is approximately 370 meV smaller compared to N719 (Eg = 2.32 eV), which is also reflected in the red-shift of the absorption spectrum. The position of the LUMO level of BTC-1 is sufficiently more negative than the TiO2 conduction band to facilitate efficient electron transfer from the excited dye to TiO2. On the other hand, the HOMO level of BTC-1 is sufficiently below the energy level of the redox mediator allowing dye regeneration.
Absorption spectra of BTC-1 and N719 adsorbed on a 3.3 μm transparent TiO2 thin film showed features similar to those of corresponding spectra in solution, but exhibited a slight red-shift due to interaction of the anchoring groups and the TiO2 surface (Fig. 2). These transparent thin films were used to investigate differences in photovoltaic performance of N719 and BTC-1 dyes.

The monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is defined as the number of electrons generated by light in the external circuit divided by the number of incident photons as a function of excitation wavelength. Fig. 3 shows the IPCE spectra obtained with DSSC devices of BTC-1 and N719 dye with 3.3 μm transparent photoanodes and a 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) containing a low-volatility electrolyte. N719 and BTC-1 exhibited at 550 nm IPCE values of 67 and 74%, respectively, with an extended red response for BTC-1. Under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions, BTC-1-sensitized cells gave a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 12.2 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.68 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.74, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 6.1% (Fig. 4). Such a high performance is very intriguing for a RuII-dye on a 3.3 μm thin TiO2 film in combination with a low-volatility electrolyte. Under similar conditions N719 dye-sensitized cells gave an overall conversion efficiency of only 4.8%. The photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 1. The Jsc value of the BTC-1 sensitizer is 34% higher compared to N719. This observation is in accordance with the red-shifted absorption in the visible region and the increased molar extinction coefficient.

The influence of nanocrystalline TiO2 film thickness on the photovoltaic performance with BTC-1 sensitizer was studied using film thicknesses of 3.3 and 5.5 μm. Additionally, a thick TiO2 film composed of 7 μm transparent layer and 5 μm scattering layer was tested. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of corresponding devices with BTC-1 and N719 are given in Table 1. Increasing the film thickness from 3.3 over 5.5 to 7 + 5 μm for BTC-1 resulted in an increase of the current densities from 12.2 over 14.1 to 15.8 mA cm−2. As a consequence, the overall cell performance was increased from 6.1 to 7.6% under full sunlight. It is interesting to note that with thinner films the photovoltaic performance of BTC-1 devices outperformed N719 devices, whereas, with double layer films the performance was nearly identical. With a double layer film the advantage of higher cross section of dye is compensated by the reflecting particle layer containing the red photons in the film and as a result both sensitizers gave almost identical values.
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized a new anchoring ligand, 5,5′-(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-diyl)-bis(thiophene-2-carboxylic acid), and its ruthenium complex BTC-1. Extending the π-conjugation of the anchoring ligand increased the device performance in thin films as a result of the increased molar extinction coefficient and enhanced spectral response in the red wavelength region. This class of sensitizers containing thiophene in the anchoring site has not been previously reported. This approach allows the design of efficient panchromatic sensitizers with increased photovoltaic conversion efficiencies.
