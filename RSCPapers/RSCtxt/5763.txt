    , Accepted 19th May 2017First published on 20th May 2017AbstractThis work introduces six novel naphthalene diimide (NDI) molecular acceptors for evaluation in organic solar cells based on two different chemical architectures: a star-shaped structure with a triarylamine core flanked by three NDI moieties and a linear molecule composed of a bithiophene bridge between two NDI moieties. For each molecular structure, three different side chains are examined, with alkyl chains linked to the NDI core either through oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen substituents. Both the chemical structure and the side-chain heteroatom substitution were found to influence the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of these molecular acceptors. Organic solar cells were fabricated with each acceptor, utilizing PBDTTT-EFT (also known as PTB7-Th) as the donor material in inverted bulk-heterojunction devices. Nitrogen was observed to lower the solar cell performance for these acceptors by significantly decreasing the short circuit current density (JSC), while sulfur increased the JSC and, in the star configuration, led to the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.8% – which is amongst the highest for any molecular NDI-based acceptor to date. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements of the star-shaped materials showed the side-chain substitutional atom significantly alters the material's packing configuration in neat films, with films blended with PBDTTT-EFT showing features characteristic of the neat donor and acceptor materials, indicating that the small molecules do not disrupt the packing of PBDTTT-EFT (and vice versa). Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) measurements indicate the PBDTTT-EFT:star-shaped acceptor blends are not subject to coarse phase-separation, with the average domain size for all three star-shaped acceptor blends typically being less than 100 nm. This is confirmed by similar topography for blended films in AFM images amongst the three acceptors. Photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements, however, found large differences in PL quenching efficiency which were attributed to differences in the driving force for charge transfer, with the nitrogen substituted compound showing the lowest PL quenching and the sulfur replacement showing the highest.
Introduction
In recent years, the potential for low-cost, large-scale manufacturing of thin, flexible solar cells has been the driving force behind research in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPV).1–3 While the technology and benefits of producing solar cells through roll-to-roll printing are promising, there is still much work to be done before large-scale manufacturing of these devices is possible. Amongst the biggest obstacles to the commercialization of OPV is the lower power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells compared with other, more mature solar technologies.4 This has led to a significant research effort in improving the performance of organic photovoltaics through device engineering and material design, resulting in significant improvement in OPV performance over the past ten years.5–9 Today, novel materials that exhibit PCEs near 10% or even higher are not uncommon,10–12 demonstrating the competitive viability of OPV with existing solar conversion technologies.
Conventionally, organic solar cells employ a polymeric donor material and a fullerene-derivative acceptor within the light-absorbing active layer of the device.13,14 Until recently, a vast majority of the effort in improving device efficiencies has focused on designing novel donor materials, with a fullerene derivative such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) typically used as the acceptor. While there are several advantages in using PCBM as the acceptor – in particular its excellent electron mobility – fullerene derivatives are costly, difficult to synthesize, have poor light-harvesting abilities, and low stability in air,15,16 calling for an investigation into alternative acceptor materials.
There are several alternatives to fullerene acceptors which employ either a polymeric or molecular structure around common electron-withdrawing building blocks including diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),17–19 benzothiadiazole,20,21 and rylene diimides, among others.22 Of these alternative materials, rylene diimide-based acceptors such as perylene diimide (PDI)23–25 and naphthalene diimide (NDI)26–28 have shown great success in fullerene-free devices, among both polymeric and small molecular acceptors.29–31 Despite initially lower performance compared with polymeric acceptors, several OPV devices comprised of a PDI-based molecular acceptor have recently exhibited device efficiencies surpassing 8% PCE in academic research,32,33 while some of the highest performing molecular acceptors are comprised of a indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene core and have exhibited efficiencies approaching 12% PCE.34 Compared to their polymeric counterparts, small molecule-based acceptors have the following benefits: a defined molecular structure with lower batch-to-batch variation, increased electron mobilities, and the potential for structural variation, warranting further investigation into novel small molecule materials as acceptors in organic solar cells.35
Amongst the members of the rylene family, NDI is the smallest but a versatile aromatic compound that displays tremendous chemical, thermal and photochemical stability.36–38 The NDI building block has been demonstrated to produce efficient solar cells in polymeric acceptors,39 however molecular NDI-based acceptors have not been as successful, exhibiting lower performance primarily due to the naphthalene diimide's large optical band gap, weak visible absorption and strong tendency to aggregate.40 These shortcomings have hindered the investigation into potential NDI-based molecular acceptors, resulting in slow progress in increasing device efficiencies. However, incorporating additional donor moieties onto the naphthalene core of the NDI allows tunable optical properties, i.e. lowering their optical band gap, while simultaneously disrupting strong aggregation of the NDI core. Additionally, substitutional heteroatoms have been shown to strongly influence the solid-state properties of molecular conjugated materials, providing an additional handle for tuning molecular properties which has not been explored much to date in OPV research.41 In this work, we report novel NDI-based acceptors based on two different molecular architectures, and additionally explore the effect of different substitutional heteroatoms on the physical and photovoltaic properties of the molecular acceptor materials.
This paper introduces six novel NDI-based molecular acceptors (Fig. 1) that have been specifically designed to reduce strong aggregation when blended with a polymeric donor. They are: 9,9′,9′′-(nitrilotris(benzene-4,1-diyl))tris(4-butoxy-2,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (Star NDI-O), 9,9′,9′′-(nitrilotris(benzene-4,1-diyl))tris(4-(butylthio)-2,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (Star NDI-S), 9,9′,9′′-(nitrilotris(benzene-4,1-diyl))tris(4-(butylamino)-2,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (Star NDI-N), 9,9′-([2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)bis(4-butoxy-2,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (2Th–O), 9,9′-([2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)bis(4-(butylthio)-2,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (2Th–S) and 9,9′-([2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)bis(4-(butylamino)-2,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (2Th–N). The chemical structures for each material are depicted in Fig. 1. The increasingly popular donor–acceptor architecture42–45 has been used for all six materials. The first set of acceptors utilizes a donor triarylamine core to extend the conjugation length of the molecules while simultaneously adding rotational degrees of freedom, hindering strong aggregation of the molecule. This core is flanked by three acceptor NDI moieties. A bithiophene bridge is used to link two NDI units in the second set of molecular acceptors, mimicking the popular P(NDI2OD-T2) acceptor polymer, which has demonstrated the highest performance for NDI-based acceptors with over 8% PCE.46
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the six investigated materials. Materials in the top row utilize a triarylamine core to disrupt the crystalline packing tendency of the naphthalene diimides. The bottom row depicts the acceptor molecules based on the efficient P(NDI2OD-T2) polymeric acceptor. 
Sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen heteroatoms have also been substituted in the alkyl side chains. These heteroatom derivatives on the NDI core facilitate good synthetic yields and give access to compounds with widely tunable optical and electrochemical properties. Additionally, the lone pairs of electrons on these heteroatoms can undergo cross-conjugation with the electron-poor carbonyl groups, giving rise to absorption and fluorescence properties over a broad spectral range. As the nitrogen is readily oxidized, it is predicted that this substitution will raise the LUMO energy level for the molecule, reducing the driving force for exciton dissociation in bulk heterojunction devices. Alternatively, the sulfur atom has a higher electronegativity than oxygen and nitrogen.

Solvent was then evaporated and the crude product was diluted with dichloromethane (30 mL) and washed with water (3 × 30 mL). The organic phase was collected, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and the solvent removed under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using dichloromethane and the product obtained was recrystallised from acetone and dichloromethane to give title compound as deep purple solid (40 mg, yield 80%).

Device fabrication
Devices were fabricated using an inverted structure as follows: ITO/ZnO/PEIE/active layer/MoOx/Ag. ITO-patterned glass substrates were first sonicated in acetone (ten minutes) followed by 2-propanol (ten minutes). The substrates were then dried under nitrogen before a 10 minute UV-ozone treatment. Immediately thereafter, the substrates were spin-coated with a zinc acetate solution prepared as follows: zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol to form a 0.1 M solution. A small amount (60 μL/10 mL of solution) of ethanolamine was added as a stabilizer and the solution was stirred at 60 °C overnight in ambient conditions. This ZnO interlayer was spin cast to be approximately 30 nm thick. After spin coating, the substrates were transferred to a hot plate and cured at 200 °C for 30 minutes. Subsequently, a 0.4% PEIE (polyethylenimine ethoxylated) in 2-methoxyethanol solution was spin coated onto the substrates to form a 10 nm-thick film and annealed at 120 °C for 20 minutes. All materials and solvents were acquired from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box where active layers were spin cast to form films that were approximately 70 nm thick. The ideal active layer solution consisted of a 1:1 weight ratio of donor to acceptor in chlorobenzene. The optimum concentration was 30 g L−1 and all solutions were heated at 70 °C for at least 24 hours prior to being spin cast. Devices were carefully optimized with respect to active layer thickness, weight ratio, and solvent, with optimization data provided in the ESI.† Trials of solvent additives (e.g. 1,8-diiodooctane), annealing and solvent annealing were found to worsen device performance. The donor polymer PBDTTT-EFT (also known as PTB7-Th) was purchased from 1-Material (commercial name PCE-10) and used as received. After the active layer was deposited, the substrates were immediately transferred to an Angstrom Engineering Covap evaporator where 12 nm of molybdenum oxide (0.3 Å s−1) was evaporated followed by 100 nm of silver (1 Å s−1) under at most 9 × 10−7 Torr. A mask was used to ensure the devices each had eight identical pixels with 4.5 mm2 active area each. Following the contact deposition, the devices were fitted with edge clips and encapsulated by epoxy and glass.
Device characterization
Simulated AM1.5 G radiation with 100 mW cm−2 irradiance was provided by a Photo Emission Tech model SS50AAA solar simulator with a silicon reference cell with a KG3 glass filter used to calibrate the intensity. A Keithley 2635 source meter was used to characterize the J–V characteristics of devices. External quantum efficiency spectra were subsequently measured using a spot size less than the active area of the pixel in the device. This ensures that the EQE measurement is independent of the device active area, enabling a cross-check with the measured JSC under the solar simulator. An Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator was used to disperse light from a tungsten filament (Newport 250 W QTH). Prior to measurement, this system was calibrated using a Thorlabs FDS-100CAL photodiode placed at the exact location devices occupy during measurements.
Thin-film morphology characterization

Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering. 
GIWAXS measurements were performed at the SAXS/WAXS beamline at the Australian Synchrotron.51 A Dectris Pilatus 1M detector was used to record scattering patterns from 11 keV electrons. Background signal from substrate scatter was minimized by keeping the incident angle of the X-ray beam close to the critical angle of the polymer film but below the critical angle of the substrate. Damage to the film was avoided by limiting the X-ray exposure time to 3 seconds. The sample-to-detector distance was calibrated using a silver behenate sample. The results were analysed by an altered version of the NIKA 2D data reduction package52 implemented in IgorPro.


Resonant soft X-ray scattering. 
R-SoXS measurements were performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source.53 Films were floated in deionized water, followed by transferring onto 100 nm SiN2 windows. The X-ray energy of 284.0 eV was chosen by calculating the scattering materials contrast between PBDTTT-EFT and the various acceptors. Scattered photons were collected by a Princeton PI-MTE in-vacuum CCD detector with 27.6 μm × 27.6 μm pixels. Two scattering patterns were collected, one at a 30 mm sample to detector distance and another at a 150 mm sample to detector distance, and combined in software. Two dimensional scattering patterns were reduced to one dimensional profiles by using a customized version of NIKA.


Photoluminescence quenching. 
PL spectroscopy and PL quenching measurements were acquired using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog spectrofluorometer.


Atomic force microscopy. 
AFM images were obtained from the Melbourne Centre for Nanofabrication using a Bruker Dimension Icon in ScanAsyst mode.

Results and discussion
HOMO and LUMO values for each material were estimated with cyclic voltammetry and are displayed in Fig. 2. A detailed description of the measurement as well as cyclic voltammograms (ES20) for each material are given in the ESI.† The acceptors incorporating either an oxygen or sulfur in their side chains exhibited similar HOMO and LUMO values for both star and 2Th materials. The bithiophene bridge lowered both HOMO and LUMO values in these materials compared with the triarylamine core by approximately 0.1 eV. As predicted, both acceptors with nitrogen substitutional atoms exhibited high-lying HOMO and LUMO values compared with the other molecules. While the molecular structure did not greatly affect the LUMO energy level for Star NDI-N or 2Th–N, there is a noticeable lowering of the HOMO energy in the 2Th–N material, following the trend seen in the other 2Th materials. Due to the generally low-lying LUMO values, the popular low band-gap polymeric donor poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PBDTTT-EFT) was chosen as the donor material for bulk heterojunction devices, which is known to perform well in conjunction with the NDI-based acceptor polymer P(NDI2OD-T2).54 The optoelectronic properties of the materials are given in Table 1.

Each material exhibits a red-shift in its UV-visible absorption profile from the solution to the solid-state, indicative of stronger intermolecular interaction in the solid state (see Fig. ES21 in the ESI†).55 The solid-state absorption profiles of neat and blend film are shown in Fig. 3. All six materials exhibited absorption coefficients (α) from 1.7–2.0 × 104 cm−1 (Fig. ES22†). Due to the donor–acceptor character of these materials, the spectra show an extension of the absorption profile into the visible region beyond the absorption edge of NDI, which is found at ∼380 nm.36 For the star-shaped materials, the absorption profile includes a broad absorption feature from ∼550–775 nm, as well as a narrower and more structured feature between 400–550 nm. Below 400 nm, absorption characteristic of π–π* absorption in the NDI subunit is seen. For the 2Th materials, only a single, broad absorption feature in the visible is seen. The broad absorption peak at larger wavelengths is attributed to the induced charge transfer (ICT) state of the bithiophene bridge, flanked by two NDI acceptor moieties. The broad absorption peaks exhibited by all six acceptors can be attributed to delocalized electronic transitions throughout the entire molecule.56 Extending the acceptor's absorption spectrum into the visible wavelength range will, in theory, enable greater photon absorption by photovoltaic devices, increasing the photocurrent. The absorption profile of 1:1 blends of the acceptor molecules with the donor polymer PBDTTT-EFT strongly reflect the absorption profile of neat PBDTTT-EFT at higher wavelengths, while the absorption profiles of the acceptors are visible at wavelengths below 550 nm. The lower optical bandgap for the star-shaped materials is indicative of a longer conjugation length along the molecule compared to 2Th materials.

Following initial material investigations, inverted solar cells employing each molecular acceptor were fabricated with the following architecture: ITO/ZnO/PEIE/active layer/MoOx/Ag. Sandwiching a thin (∼10 nm) layer of the insulating polymer PEIE between the electron transporting and active layers – which elsewhere has been shown to increase the performance of polymer solar cells57 – was found to enhance the performance of our NDI-based solar cells (Fig. ES23†). Active layers were spin cast at 6000 RPM from chlorobenzene solutions with a 1:1 PBDTTT-EFT:acceptor ratio by weight to form films approximately 70 nm thick. These were determined to be the optimum processing conditions for all six molecular acceptors. A detailed description of the device fabrication is outlined in the Experimental section and additional optimization can be found in the ESI.† Although 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was trialed as a solvent additive, even very low concentrations (0.2 vol%) were determined to hinder the device performance. This is in agreement with similar systems that also show the addition of DIO to NDI-based acceptor devices reduces the device performance.58 The J–V characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for all six acceptors are given in Fig. 4 with a summary of the performance parameters given in Table 2.

The devices were all optimized to the following processing conditions: a 1:1 donor:acceptor ratio with PBDTTT-EFT in a 30 g L−1 chlorobenzene solution, spin cast at 6000 RPM. EQE spectra for star-shaped (c) and 2Th-based (d) devices are also shown. The EQE spectra compliment the J–V characteristics, as materials with a sulfur substitution exhibit higher EQE while the nitrogen substitution leads to a decrease in EQE.

For both star-shaped and linear molecules, there are systematic variations in performance for the different heteroatoms. For both star-shaped and linear acceptors, the sulfur substituted molecule was found to perform best, followed by the oxygen substituted molecule, with the nitrogen substituted molecule performing the worst. For the star-shaped materials, devices based on Star-S exhibited enhanced JSC and fill factors (FF) compared to Star-O based devices, with JSC increasing from 5.0 to 6.7 mA cm−2 and FF from 34 to 43%. Alternatively, compared to both Star-O and Star-S based devices, the Star-N devices exhibit significantly reduced JSC and FF, down to 1.6 mA cm−2 and 32% respectively. Similar trends are seen for the bithiophene materials. JSC was also estimated by integrating the external quantum efficiency spectra which agree well in general with the measured JSC, with the slightly larger JSC values measured under the solar simulator likely to be due to edge effects given the small active area of the cells.
Based on the spectral features of the EQE and the absorption profiles of the donor and acceptor materials, it can be seen that acceptor materials are contributing to current, but only contributing at most 25% due to the lower absorption coefficient of these materials compared to PBDTTT-EFT (refer to the donor:acceptor ratio EQE and UV-Vis spectra analysis in the ESI†). This observation indicates that these materials do not significantly contribute to the photocurrent generated by the devices, despite the absorption edge being extended into the visible wavelength region by elongating the conjugation length of the material. Future work will include optimizing the molecular structure of acceptors in order to increase their contribution to the observed photocurrent in bulk heterojunction devices.
As noted above, a strong dependence on the substitutional atom is reflected in the JSC measured for these materials, particularly in acceptors utilizing a nitrogen substitutional atom. For the star-shaped materials, this dependence is significant, with an observed JSC of just 1.6 mA cm−2 for Star NDI-N, compared with 5.0 mA cm−2 for Star NDI-O and 6.8 mA cm−2 for Star NDI-S. This change in JSC could be due to the reduced LUMO/LUMO offset between PBDTTT-EFT and Star NDI-N. This offset determines the driving force for charge transfer and charge separation, and is therefore extremely important. The same reasoning can be used to explain the reduced JSC observed in PBDTTT-EFT:2Th–N devices.
It is important to note that the FF for all six acceptors blended with PBDTTT-EFT are lower than those reported for other NDI-based molecular acceptors that exhibit similar efficiencies. Reported FF for similar OPV systems are typically around 50% (ref. 27 and 28) while the systems reported here range from 32–42%. These low FF indicate that photogenerated charge carriers are not able to be efficiently extracted from the devices, which may be due to a number of reasons including large active-layer domain sizes that prohibit excitons from dissociating efficiently, a lack of clear charge pathways to the respective electrodes of the charge carriers, or an imbalance in electron and hole mobility within the active layer.59 Indeed, preliminary space-charged limited current measurements on PBDTTT-EFT:Star NDI-O blends (see Fig. ES28†) determined the hole and electron mobilities to be 4.6 × 10−4 and 1.7 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. The significantly lower electron mobility compared to hole mobility indicates unbalanced charge movement through the device, and may help to explain the relatively low FF observed in solar cells made from these materials.
Within the six materials discussed here, the nitrogen heteroatom lowers the FF for both the star-shaped and linear molecules, while the oxygen or sulfur heteroatoms result in higher FF. For the star-shaped materials, the sulfur heteroatom clearly demonstrates the higher FF of 42% over 34% for Star NDI-O. However, the oxygen heteroatom within the linear molecules results in a FF of 40%, which is higher than the 38% FF realized with the sulfur heteroatom. Despite these subtle differences, the FF reported here remain notably lower than those reported for similar systems, and further investigation into the morphology of the active layers will be discussed below, in an effort to explain these deficiencies.
Another interesting variation between the materials is the value of the VOC, which is influenced by both the substitutional atoms and the molecular structure. Theoretically the maximum VOC obtainable will be limited by the difference between the HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor materials.6 The trends that can be observed in the measured VOC agree well with those predicted by comparing LUMO values between the various acceptors. Between the star and bithiophene bridge structures, the linear configuration of the 2Th materials decreases both the HOMO and LUMO values for these materials compared with the star-shaped materials. This results in higher VOC values for the star-shaped materials. For the 2Th materials, the VOC for both oxygen and sulfur substitutional atoms are very similar, which reflects the very similar LUMO values for these materials. The LUMO of the 2Th–N material, however, is significantly higher, which results in an increase in the VOC of 0.06 V from 0.88 V for 2Th–O and 2Th–S to 0.94 V. Interestingly, this notable increase in VOC is not observed in the Star-N material over the VOC values of Star-O and Star-S, despite these having lower LUMO values. With influence by kinetic factors as well as energetic factors, the lower than expected VOC of the Star-N molecule could be due to higher bimolecular recombination in Star-N based devices. Additionally, the VOC values observed for all three linear molecules, which were designed based on the P(NDI2OD-T2) polymer, are higher than the VOC observed when P(NDI2OD-T2) is blended with PBDTTT-EFT.60 The all-polymer devices resulted in a VOC of 0.80 V, which is significantly lower than the 0.88–0.94 V observed for the molecular materials. This is a reflection of the increased LUMO value for the molecular materials, from −3.8 eV for P(NDI2OD-T2),40 to −3.59 eV for 2Th–N. Despite an increase in VOC for the 2Th materials, a significant reduction in both JSC and FF are observed when the molecular acceptors are blended with PBDTTT-EFT compared to P(NDI2OD-T2). These differences result in a typical PCE of 5.5% for PBDTTT-EFT:P(NDI2OD-T2) devices,60 compared to 1.6, 1.7 and 0.84% PCE for 2Th–O, 2Th–S and 2Th–N devices respectively.
Apart from the molecules with sulfur substitutions, incorporating the triarylamine core unit resulted in better device efficiency compared with the more planar bithiophene configuration. This result is most likely due to the star-shaped molecules affording a greater opportunity for charge delocalisation compared to the linear molecules.61
Ultimately, thionating the alkyl chain of the star-shaped NDI-based acceptor resulted in an average PCE of 2.8%, which is amongst the highest efficiencies for NDI-based molecular acceptors to-date.22,62 (Using the lower JSC from integrating the EQE spectrum yields an efficiency of 2.6%, which is still among the highest efficiencies.) As a result of the improved performance of the star-shaped materials over the bithiophone acceptors, further investigations into the morphology of these materials focused on the triarylamine-based acceptors.
Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to characterize the crystallinity63,64 of the neat and blend films of the three star acceptors (Fig. 5). In contrast to the scattering patterns observed in soluble NDI derivatives,65 the scattering patterns of neat films of the three star acceptors, in general, show few well-defined scattering features, indicating a lack of extended three-dimensional order, demonstrating that the star architecture is effective in suppressing the crystallization of these molecules. There are, however, subtle differences in the scattering patterns of the three star acceptors indicating that the substitutional atom does have an effect on the materials' intermolecular packing. For the Star NDI-O material, only two weak isotropic rings at ∼4.5 nm−1 and 14 nm−1 are seen which are likely associated with correlated ordering (weak aggregation) on the length scale of the molecule and disordered π–π packing, respectively. For the Star NDI-S material, only a very weak π–π stacking feature can be seen in the QZ direction. Finally, the Star NDI-N material appears to show some peaks at low Q, suggesting some degree of order on the length scale of the molecule, with both isotropic and anisotropic scattering features. The scattering features in the neat acceptor films are carried over into the GIWAXS patterns of 1:1 blends with the donor polymer. Indeed, the scattering patterns of the blends resemble a linear combination of the scattering patterns of the neat materials, indicating that both donor and acceptor materials pack in a similar fashion in the blend and, in particular, that these three acceptor materials do not appear to disrupt the packing of PBDTTT-EFT crystallites (and vice versa). 1D GIWAXS line cut profiles for neat donor and acceptor as well as blend films can be found in the electronic ESI (Fig. ES26†). Interestingly while there are variations in the degree of order exhibited by the three star NDI molecules, solar cell performance appears to be inversely correlated with acceptor order, with the Star NDI-S giving the best solar cell performance despite showing the least crystalline order. The Star NDI-O gives the next highest solar cell performance with some improved crystalline order, while the Star NDI-N molecule gives the worst solar cell performance despite showing the highest level of crystallinity. Of course, crystallinity in itself may not be causing poor solar cell performance with differences in the LUMO levels of the materials likely to be more strongly influencing device behavior, as discussed above. However, the GIWAXS observations show that crystallinity does not appear to be necessary to enable device action in this class of material.
 Fig. 5  2D GIWAXS spectra of neat Star NDI-O (a), Star NDI-S (b), Star NDI-N (c) and PBDTTT-EFT (d). The corresponding blended films of PBDTTT-EFT with Star NDI-O (e), Star NDI-S (f) and Star NDI-N (g) are also given. 
The size of domains on the 10 nm to 1 μm length scale has been probed with resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) with the results displayed in Fig. 6. The R-SoXS patterns show a lack of prominent scattering features for values of Q < 0.05 nm−1, indicating a lack of coarse phase separation. All three blends show similar scattering profiles suggesting a lack of a well-defined domain spacing with domains typically less than 100 nm in size. While the R-SoXS results show that the domains are not overly coarse, there is likely to be a distribution of domain sizes with some as large as 100 nm. AFM (Fig. 7) was used to confirm the homogeneity of the domain sizes for 1:1 blended films of all three molecular acceptors. The images show a lack of coarse phase separation and relatively smooth film topography, indicating the substitutional heteroatom does not strongly influence the morphology of blended films, which is in agreement with the R-SoXS spectra.

 Fig. 7  AFM images for 1:1 blends of PDBTTT-EFT:Star NDI-O (a), Star NDI-S (b) and Star NDI-N (c). 
Finally, PL quenching experiments were performed to assess the efficiency of charge generation in the Star NDI-based blends. Fig. ES27† presents the PL spectra used to calculate PL quenching with Table 2 summarizing the PL quenching efficiency results. The PL quenching data indicate a strong dependence of charge transfer efficiency on the substitutional heteroatom, with the sulfur substitution resulting in the largest PL quenching efficiency of 82.3% followed by the oxygen heteroatom of 71.8% and finally, the nitrogen substitutional atom resulted in the lowest PL quenching efficiency of 43.2%. These PL quenching efficiency trends nicely follow the device trends indicating that differences in exciton dissociation efficiency can largely account for the variations in JSC observed. While differences in PL quenching efficiency are often associated with variations in domain size, the R-SoXS and AFM results indicate that all three blends have similar morphologies. Thus the differences in PL quenching efficiency are attributed to differences in the driving force for charge transfer, with the raised LUMO of the Star NDI-N molecule in particular resulting in an insufficient LUMO/LUMO offset. The PL quenching efficiency of the Star NDI-O and Star NDI-S molecules indicate there is still some room for improvement, however it is not clear what contribution morphology may be playing here.
This work has demonstrated that NDI-based small molecule acceptors have the potential to act as efficient electron acceptors in organic solar cells. While this manuscript has focused on using PBDTTT-EFT as the donor material, other donor polymers may be better suited, which will be the subject of future work. Very recently, it has been shown that poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) can successfully act as the donor polymer for NDI-based molecular acceptors, with devices reaching efficiencies greater than 4%.62 The use of a heteroatom-linked side-chain attached to the NDI core also affords greater flexibility for tuning optoelectronic properties, and future work tuning the nature of these side chains will also be of interest.
Conclusions
In conclusion, six novel NDI-based molecular acceptors have been synthesized. These acceptors utilize two different molecular architectures and have three different substitutional atoms in their side chains. It was found that a triarylamine core flanked by three NDI units was a favorable molecular structure compared to two NDI units connected via a bithiophene bridge. This is most likely due to the more extended electron delocalization afforded by the star-shaped material, as is shown by the UV-visible absorption profile. Additionally, it was found that the substitutional heteroatom plays an important role in the performance of these acceptors. The electron donating nitrogen atom significantly decreased the performance of these materials by raising the LUMO level, having an unfavorable effect on exciton dissociation and resulting in significant reductions in JSC. Alternatively, substituting a readily reduced sulfur atom in place of an oxygen resulted in significantly improved JSC in solar cells, leading to a PCE of 2.8%, which is amongst the highest to date for molecule NDI acceptors.

 	Fig. 3  Normalized neat absorbance for the star-shaped acceptors and PBDTTT-EFT (a) and 2Th molecules (b). The absorbance profiles for optimized device blends are shown in the bottom row for both the star-shaped materials (c) and 2Th materials (d).	 

 	Fig. 4  Solar cell characteristics for star-shaped (a) and 2Th-based devices (b). The devices were all optimized to the following processing conditions: a 1:1 donor:acceptor ratio with PBDTTT-EFT in a 30 g L−1 chlorobenzene solution, spin cast at 6000 RPM. EQE spectra for star-shaped (c) and 2Th-based (d) devices are also shown. The EQE spectra compliment the J–V characteristics, as materials with a sulfur substitution exhibit higher EQE while the nitrogen substitution leads to a decrease in EQE.
