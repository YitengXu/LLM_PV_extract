    , Accepted 27th February 2020First published on 28th February 2020AbstractSolar energy conversion using molecular photoswitches holds great potential to store energy from sunlight in the form of chemical energy in a process that can be easily implemented in a direct solar energy storage device. In this context, we investigated the electrochemically triggered energy release of a solar thermal fuel based on the norbornadiene (NBD)/quadricyclane (QC) couple by photoelectrochemical IR reflection absorption spectroscopy (PEC-IRRAS). We studied the photo-induced conversion of the energy-lean 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-norbornadiene (NBD′) to the energy-rich 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-quadricyclane (QC′) and the electrochemically triggered reconversion using highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) as an electrode material. We compared our results with the results obtained previously using Pt(111) electrodes and we characterized the photochemical and electrochemical properties of the storage system. NBD′ can be photochemically converted and electrochemically reconverted with very high selectivity. HOPG largely suppresses the unwanted catalytic reconversion which was observed on Pt(111). We performed repetitive cycling experiments for 1000 cycles to determine the reversibility of the system. Our results show that it is possible to reach reversibility above 99.8% using HOPG as an electrode material.
Introduction
Efficient energy conversion and storage is among the greatest challenges in the transition to a sustainable energy system based on renewable sources.1–3 Besides conventional photovoltaic technologies, it is also feasible to convert sunlight directly into chemical energy using molecular photoswitches.3–8 This technology combines energy conversion, storage, and release in a single system. Promising examples for such photoswitches include the valence isomers norbornadiene (NBD) and quadricyclane (QC)9,10 and their derivatives.11–17 In these storage couples, the energy-lean NBD is converted photochemically to its energy-rich counterpart QC through an intramolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition.18–22 The photochemical reaction is as follows: NBD is excited via radiation to the singlet excited state 1NBD, which converts via intersystem crossing to the triplet excited state 3NBD. In its diradicaloid state 3NBD undergoes an adiabatic isomarization to the triplet excited 3QC. Finally, 3QC relaxes to the ground state, forming metastable QC.9,23 The energy stored in QC is released later in the form of heat (Molecular Solar Thermal Storage, MOST). Noteworthily, the energy density of the solar fuel QC is up to 0.97 MJ kg−1, which is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art batteries.24–27
One way to release the stored energy is by using mild oxidizing agents, which trigger the release through an autocatalytic reaction that proceeds through QC+˙ radical intermediates.25,28,29 This release reaction is, however, difficult to control. Another approach for triggering the release makes use of heterogeneous catalysts.30–33 For example, carbon-supported cobalt phthalocyanine was recently shown to catalyze the heat release in a NBD/QC-based system.32 A particularly intriguing approach is to trigger the energy release electrochemically.34–36 In electrochemically controlled release systems, it is possible to control the cycloreversion from QC to NBD via an electrode potential in a quantitative manner and even stop it once started.35 In addition to the well-controlled energy release in the form of heat, electrochemically controlled systems might, in principle, also allow for the release of part of the stored energy in the form of electricity, functioning in a similar way to a dye-sensitized solar cell.35,37,38
In our previous work, we demonstrated the electrochemically triggered energy release from QC in highly selective photochemical and electrochemical conversion systems.35 Both, energy storage and release, processes employing this photothermal couple were studied using a newly developed photoelectrochemical infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PEC-IRRAS) setup.39 We showed that cyclability can be further increased by molecular design using the NBD derivative NBD′ (2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-norbornadiene) and its counterpart QC′ (see Scheme 1).40 At Pt(111) electrodes, we achieved a reversibility of >99%. Most importantly, we identified electrode fouling as the step, which limits the reversibility of Pt electrodes,40 one of the most common electrode materials in electrochemistry. The popularity of Pt as an electrode material results from its specific properties as a noble metal, e.g. a wide electrochemical stability window41 and a high electrocatalytic activity for many reactions.42,43 On the other hand, Pt is also frequently used in heterogeneous catalysis,44 accelerating also unselective side reactions. In this work we demonstrate how this limitation can be overcome by using appropriate electrode materials. One appropriate class of electrode materials is carbon-based. These materials are chemically and electrochemically inert, and can be used over a wide potential window.45 Here, we use HOPG as a catalytically inactive electrode material,45–48 which does not trigger undesired channels at the electrode interface. This improves the level of control and gives rise to a drastic increase of reversibility. We believe that this finding will be essential for the development of electrochemically controlled MOST energy storage devices.

Results and discussion
In order to study the photo- and electrocatalytic conversion between NBD′ and QC′ on HOPG, we used the new PEC-IRRAS setup described previously.39 In Fig. 1a, the experimental setup and the measuring procedure are shown schematically. During the measurements, the working electrode (WE) was pressed against a CaF2 hemisphere, resulting in the formation of a thin electrolyte layer with a thickness of a few micrometers.39 Note that under these conditions mass transport in the thin layer is decoupled from the bulk solution.49 The CaF2 hemisphere serves as an UV and IR transparent window. As a photon source, we used a high power UV LED (λmax = 340 nm, 55 mW), which was placed underneath the CaF2 window. The wavelength chosen fits to the absorption maximum of NBD′.13 This NBD′ derivative features specific molecular functionalities which are essential for the experiment: the push–pull substituents shift the absorption into the near visible region, while preserving a long storage half-life time.13 Simultaneously, the CN group acts as a spectroscopic marker, which enables us to monitor the interconversion by PEC-IRRAS.

The reference spectrum was taken at −0.88 Vfc. 
In the first step, we investigated the photochemical conversion of NBD′ to QC′ and the electrochemically triggered reconversion in a combined experiment using HOPG as the WE. In a preliminary work, we demonstrated that NBD′ can be converted to QC′ at a Pt(111) electrode without any detectable side reactions at a potential of −0.88 Vfc.37 After recording a background spectrum at −0.88 Vfc, the thin layer was irradiated for 3 s. Subsequently, the potential was increased in steps of 0.1 V up to 1.72 Vfc. The IR spectra were recorded before and after the irradiation and at each potential step, as displayed in Fig. 1a. The corresponding spectra of the photo- and electro-conversion are shown in Fig. 1b. After irradiation, we observed characteristic features for both NBD′ and QC′. In our previous study, we assigned the IR bands to the specific vibrational modes based on the calculated spectra by DFT.40 For NBD′, positive bands appear at 2949 (ν(CH3)), 2875 (ν(CH2)NBD), 2195 (ν(CN)), 1601 (ν(CC)ring, ν(CC)NBD), 1513 (ν(CC)ring, ν(CO), ν(CC)NBD), 1343 (ν(CC)ring), 1217 (ν(COC), ν(CC)NBD), and 1151 cm−1 (ν(CC)NBD/ring). Negative bands appear at 2936 (ν(CH3)), 2863 (ν(CH3)), 2220 (ν(CN)), 1587 (ν(CC)ring), 1521 (ν(CC)ring), 1172 (ν(CC)QC, ν(COC), ν(CH3)), and 1138 cm−1 (ν(CC)ring), which are all ascribed to QC′. All the IR spectra shown are difference spectra. Therefore, negative bands (downward oriented) indicate species that are formed, while positive bands (upward oriented) correspond to species that are consumed. The results indicate that NBD′ is converted photochemically to QC′. Additional features around 1260 and 1422 cm−1 are related to the solvent dichloromethane (DCM).50 Further details of the observed bands and the assignment to the vibrational modes are given in the ESI.† When increasing the potential from −0.88 to 0.32 Vfc, the bands of NBD′ and QC′ disappear, indicating a complete reconversion. Above 0.82 Vfc, positive bands of NBD′ show the oxidation and decomposition of the reconverted NBD′. The onset potential for the decomposition in the PEC-IRRAS experiment agrees well with differential pulse voltammograms of NBD′ (see the ESI†). Note that the reconversion is driven mainly auto-catalytically and only a small amount of electrochemically formed QC+˙ is necessary to drive the reaction. As a result, no peaks resulting from the oxidation of QC are observable. This is in full agreement with our previous study.40
The band positions of the CN stretching modes of NBD′ and QC′ feature a spectral shift of 25 cm−1. This shift is sufficiently large to be used as a spectroscopic marker to follow the photo- and electrochemical conversion, as depicted in Fig. 1c. Based on the CN-band intensities, the concentration of the reactants could be determined quantitatively during the reaction (see the ESI for details†). Fig. 1d shows the relative NBD′ and QC′ concentrations as a function of the electrode potential applied. The data reveal that NBD′ is converted with high selectivity to QC′ (95 ± 5%). Note that for the HOPG electrode we observed a broad potential region from −0.88 to 0.02 Vfc, where no reconversion to NBD′ is observed. This observation is in sharp contrast to the case of Pt(111) as WE, where we observed slow reconversion above −0.88 Vfc. We attribute the slow reconversion at potentials below 0.02 Vfc to a catalytically triggered reaction channel. This competing catalytically triggered channel limits the level of control in the photoelectrochemical cell.30,40 At the HOPG electrode, the catalytic channel is suppressed completely and the reconversion occurs only via an electrochemically triggered channel. As a result, the reconversion on HOPG occurs in a small potential window only between 0.02 and 0.32 Vfc. Furthermore, we conclude that both the photochemical and the electrochemical conversion reactions are fully selective within the accuracy of the single conversion experiment (±5%).
In the next step, we performed time-resolved in situ measurements to follow both the conversion and the reconversion. The experimental procedures are schematically depicted in Fig. 2a. In both experiments the background spectrum was measured at −0.88 Vfc, followed by an additional IR spectrum to ensure that the system is stable before starting the kinetic measurements.
 Fig. 2  (a) Experimental procedure applied for the time-resolved in situ IR measurements on HOPG; (b) spectra acquired after photochemical conversion at −0.88 Vfc and (c) the corresponding concentrations as calculated from the band intensities; (d) spectra acquired after electrochemically triggered reconversion at 0.42 Vfc and (e) the corresponding concentrations as calculated from the band intensities. For all spectra, the background spectra were measured before irradiation at −0.88 Vfc. 
For the photochemical conversion, the time-resolved spectra were recorded continuously during the irradiation at −0.88 Vfc with an acquisition time of approximately 300 ms per spectrum. The CN-region of the corresponding IR spectra is presented in Fig. 2b. Upon irradiation, positive and negative bands appear at 2195 and 2220 cm−1, respectively, indicting the conversion of NBD′ to QC′. Quantitative analysis of the CN band intensities (Fig. 2c) shows that NBD′ is selectively (>99 ± 5%) converted to QC′ within 2 s in the experiment. This is in good agreement with previous findings.40 Furthermore, no side reactions are observed, even after an extended UV exposure of 30 s (see the ESI for details†).
In the kinetic studies of the electrochemically triggered cycloreversion, we applied a UV pulse of 10 s at −0.88 Vfc. After switching the potential to +0.42 Vfc, the time-resolved measurement was started (297 ms per spectrum). The spectra in Fig. 2d show that both a positive NBD′ band and a negative QC′ band appear immediately after irradiation. Both bands decrease with increasing reaction time at 0.42 Vfc and disappear finally. Quantitative analysis yields the concentration values given in Fig. 2e. Our data show that QC′ is reconverted completely within ∼12 s with a selectivity of >99 ± 5%. In agreement with previous findings, no additional peaks are observed after the electrochemical reconversion, indicating that no byproducts are formed within the detection level of the experiment. Interestingly, the concentration curves show an s-shaped appearance. The kinetic behavior observed may be due to two distinct effects. First, the electrode potential in the thin film requires some time to equilibrate after the change in potential. As the currents are very small, we expect the corresponding time constants to be in the order of 100 ms or less.51 Therefore, the most plausible explanation involves the radical mechanism of the reconversion. We attribute the delayed reconversion to the initial formation of reactive intermediates which then diffuse into the bulk solution and trigger the reconversion in a chain reaction. We performed additional experiments with thicker thin layers to exclude that the observations result from the Ohmic (iR) drop in the measurement (see the ESI for details†).
The time-resolved measurements define the conditions and the time scale required for a single photoelectrochemical storage and release cycle. Based on these data, we perform an experiment in which we cycle the energy storage system repeatedly, similar to that in our previous study of Pt(111).40 Specifically, we applied 1000 storage and release cycles in an automated experiment. This procedure allows us to extract quantitative data on the reversibility with high accuracy. Furthermore, it is possible to compare the data directly to that obtained in our previous study on Pt(111) because both experiments were performed under identical conditions. Details of the experimental procedure are shown in Fig. 3a. In each cycle, we recorded the spectra at −0.88 Vfc after the photochemical conversion (3 s irradiation at −0.88 Vfc) and after the electrochemically triggered reconversion (30 s at 0.42 Vfc). The reference spectrum (SR) for all the spectra were taken before the first irradiation.

Both types of spectra are referred to the background SR measured prior to the experiment; (b and c) IR spectra recorded after photochemical conversion and after the electrochemical reconversion; (d) concentration curves of QC′ and NBD′ after photo- (filled squares) and electrochemical (unfilled squares) reconversion as calculated from the band intensities; (e) storage capacity versus the number of storage cycle. All spectra were taken at −0.88 Vfc. 
The experimental data are summarized in Fig. 3b. In the IR spectra recorded after the photochemical conversion, a positive band at 2195 cm−1 indicates consumption of NBD′ and a negative band at 2220 cm−1 shows the formation of QC′. With an increasing number of cycles, a small additional band appears at 2237 cm−1, showing the formation of minor traces of a side product. In a reference experiment, we switched the potential between the same values without irradiation (see ESI Chapter 7†). In this experiment, the additional band is not observed, indicating that decomposition takes place either during photochemical conversion or electrochemical conversion with QC′ as a reactant. The IR spectra recorded after switching the potential to 0.42 Vfc are depicted in Fig. 3c. Clearly we observe the reconversion of QC′ to NBD′. The corresponding concentrations of NBD′ and QC′ were quantified based on the CN band intensities (see Fig. 3d). During the 1000 storage cycles the concentration of QC′ formed decreases from 10 mM to 4 mM per cycle, while the nominal concentration of NBD′ before photoconversion decreases from 10 mM to 7.5 mM and the concentration of unconverted species after irradiation increases from 0 mM to 3.5 mM. Note that the diffusion into the thin layer and out of it requires several hours.40,49 Therefore, we can consider the thin film as being largely decoupled from the bulk solution in the experiments. These observations show that the conversion is complete only during the first cycles, while the conversion efficiency decreases slowly with time. The effect is also visible in the single channel spectra (see the ESI, Fig. S6†). We attribute the degradation to a small fraction of the photoswitch decomposing in each storage and release cycle. It is possible, for example, that a functional part of the photoswitch is attacked by a photochemically activated species in solution, leading to a loss of the functional groups. In addition, the NBD/QC frame can decompose. Previous studies indicate that the NBD–QC system is robust in diluted solutions8 or in the solid state matrix,52 but that the increased rate of degradation is seen in concentrated or neat systems.14,53 The degradation of the NBD–QC system over time is thus likely occurring via a radical-induced intermolecular polymerization reaction.14
Finally, we calculated the energy storage capacity as a function of storage cycles. As we used the same experimental conditions as those used in our previous study Pt(111),40 it is possible to directly compare the values for these two systems. The resulting data are shown in Fig. 3e. For HOPG, we observed an initial storage capacity of 97% and the storage capacity decreased to 50% after ∼400 cycles. From these values, we calculated a reversibility of >99.8% (see ESI Chapter 3 for details†). In our previous study on Pt(111), we observed a reversibility of >99%.40 This comparison shows that the reversibility of the NBD′–QC′ energy storage system can be dramatically improved using a carbon-based electrode material, which does not interfere with the reconversion through other processes. We associate the difference in selectivity with the intrinsic catalytic activity of Pt to trigger the energy release from QC′.30 The strong interaction with the Pt electrode does not only accelerate the release reaction but also triggers undesired side reactions which eventually lead to degradation and electrode fouling. The catalytic channel and associated side reaction can be largely suppressed by using an inert electrode material.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we investigated the electrochemically triggered energy release from a molecular solar energy storage system based on the norbornadiene–quadricyclane couple. The photoinduced conversion of 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-norbornadiene (NBD′) to 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-quadricyclane (QC′) and its electrochemically triggered reconversion were studied using HOPG as an electrode material. Using in situ PEC-IRRAS, we characterized the photochemical and electrochemical behavior of the storage system and performed stability tests over 1000 energy storage cycles.
We observed that NBD′ is converted selectively to QC′, while the QC′ formed is stable in the presence of the HOPG electrode over a broad potential region from −0.88 to 0.02 Vfc. This is in sharp contrast to the Pt(111) electrode, where a competing catalytic reconversion channel leads to slow energy release in the same potential region. At the HOPG electrode, QC′ is reconverted to NBD′ selectively at potentials above 0.02 Vfc. At potentials exceeding 0.82 Vfc, NBD′ oxidizes and decomposes. Our stability tests show that the energy storage capacity of NBD′–QC′ at the HOPG electrode decreased to 50% after ∼400 repetitive energy storage and release cycles. This value corresponds to a reversibility of ∼99.8% per energy storage and release cycle. In our previous studies the reversibility was substantially lower (∼99%) at Pt(111) electrodes. We attribute the increased selectivity on HOPG to the suppression of the catalytic release mechanism on Pt(111), which not only accelerates the energy release but also accelerates decomposition and electrode fouling. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to design electrochemically triggered energy storage systems based on the norbornadiene–quadricyclane couple, which operates with very high selectivity.
Experimental section
Cleaning
All glass and Teflon ware and all noble metal wires were stored in a solution of NOCHROMIX® (Sigma Aldrich) in concentrated sulfuric acid (Merck, Emsure, 98%) overnight. Prior to each use, the equipment was rinsed 5 times with ultra-pure water (MilliQ Synergy UV, 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C, TOC < 5 ppm), boiled 3 times in Milli-Q water for at least 15 min and finally dried under vacuum.
PEC-IRRAS
All PEC-IRRAS experiments were performed with a vacuum-based FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker, Vertex 80v) with evacuated optics and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. For the photochemical conversion, a UV LED (Seoul Viosys, CUD4AF1B, 340 nm, 55 mW) was placed underneath a CaF2 (Korth, d = 25 mm) window serving as an IR and UV transparent window. We used a KRS-5 filter to protect the IR detector from UV light exposure. All measurements were performed in reflection mode in a thin layer configuration. For further details of the setup we refer to previous work.39,54 The IR spectra were recorded with a resolution of 2 cm−1 and 128 scans per spectrum (acquisition time 57 s). For the time-resolved measurements, the scanner velocity was increased from 40 to 80 kHz lowering the acquisition time to 297 ms per spectrum, using a resolution of 8 cm−1. All IR spectra were recorded using non-polarized light.
The electrochemical PEC-IRRAS experiments were performed using a HOPG crystal (MikroMasch, ZYA, 0.4° mosaic spread) which was prepared by cleavage using scotch tape prior to each experiment. All experiments were performed with a solution of 10 mM NBD′ in DCM (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.8%). 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumperchlorate (Sigma Aldrich 99.0%) was used as a supporting electrolyte. Potential control was applied using a commercial potentiostat (Gamry, Reference 600+) and a three-electrode configuration with a graphite rod as the counter electrode. A saturated Ag/Ag+ electrode (AgNO3 with 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumperchlorate in DCM) was used as the reference electrode (RE). The calibration of the RE was performed in an external cell versus the cyclic voltammogram of ferrocene (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%). Note that in this work all potentials are referred to the redox potential of the ferrocene couple (Vfc).
Synthesis of 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)norbornadiene (NBD′)
Cyclopentadiene (7 mL, 83 mmol), 3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)propiolonitrile (6.31 g, 33.7 mmol), butylated hydroxytoluene (20 mg), and chlorobenzene (7 mL) were heated in a sealed vial to 130 °C for 20 h using a microwave reactor. The mixture was purified using flash column chromatography (CH2Cl2) and subsequent recrystallization (Et2O/n-heptane −18 °C) to give NBD′ as a white crystalline powder (yield: 6.83 g, 80%). For further details on the synthesis we refer to the literature.13

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  Energy storage and release in a functionalized norbornadiene (NBD)–quadricyclane (QC) valence couple; 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-norbornadiene (NBD′) and 2-cyano-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-quadricyclane (QC′).	 

 	Fig. 1  Photochemical conversion and electrochemical reconversion in the NBD′–QC′ system on HOPG; (a) schematic representation of the PEC-IRRAS setup and experimental procedure; (b) IR spectra and (c) the ν(CN) region as a function of the electrode potential; (d) the corresponding change in concentrations for NBD′ and QC′ during the experiment as derived from the band intensities in the ν(CN) region. The reference spectrum was taken at −0.88 Vfc.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Experimental procedure applied for the time-resolved in situ IR measurements on HOPG; (b) spectra acquired after photochemical conversion at −0.88 Vfc and (c) the corresponding concentrations as calculated from the band intensities; (d) spectra acquired after electrochemically triggered reconversion at 0.42 Vfc and (e) the corresponding concentrations as calculated from the band intensities. For all spectra, the background spectra were measured before irradiation at −0.88 Vfc.	 

 	Fig. 3  Reversibility test for the electrochemically triggered NBD′–QC′ energy storage system using a HOPG electrode; (a) experimental procedure covering 1000 conversion cycles monitored in situ by PEC-IRRAS; SM-P indicates the acquisition of a spectrum after photochemical conversion; SM-E indicates the acquisition of a spectrum after electrochemical reconversion. Both types of spectra are referred to the background SR measured prior to the experiment; (b and c) IR spectra recorded after photochemical conversion and after the electrochemical reconversion; (d) concentration curves of QC′ and NBD′ after photo- (filled squares) and electrochemical (unfilled squares) reconversion as calculated from the band intensities; (e) storage capacity versus the number of storage cycle. All spectra were taken at −0.88 Vfc.
