In particular, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) are potentially the most economical and environmentally friendly ones. Squaraine (SQ) has intense absorption at 600–850 nm, exactly where sun flux is the most abundant. Furthermore, various substituents on SQ cores provide great possibilities for different molecular-design strategies. These characters make SQs ideal candidates for new DSSCs and OPVs.

1. Introduction
Squaraines (SQs) are nucleophilic substitution products of squaric acid, forming π–acceptor–π systems within molecules. They have sharp and intense red-IR absorbance/fluorescence, which is a distinctive feature that stands out from other dyes. Moreover, the extremely high molar extinction coefficients of SQ absorptions and their wide solid-state absorption window (covering the visible/near-IR region) are all ideal characters for solar energy harvesting.1
SQs were intensely studied for their good photoconductivity back in the 20th century,2,3 as they were promising in applications such as electrophotographic devices and optical recording; however, they gradually faded out of sight due to the increased use of phthalocyanine materials.4,5 In recent years, SQs have re-emerged as one of the few promising materials of solar cells. The number of the publications on SQs for photovoltaics has increased rapidly in the past several years (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  The reports on SQs are directly collected from the Web of Science, from 1986 to 2012. SQ photovoltaics include SQ-composited dye-sensitized solar cells and organic photovoltaics. Other less intensely studied solar cells are not presented. 
However, the reactivity of the electrophilic cyclobutyl core is so high that most SQs are vulnerable to nucleophiles, as well as bases; thus, their applications are significantly limited; however, these problems are not irrevocable. Due to the versatility of core substituents and developments in rotaxane synthesis, these drawbacks have been alleviated. Recent structures optimizations have made SQs more stable, thus suitable for many applications, like bio-labeling, imaging, photodynamic therapy, and ion detection.6–12
Hereinafter, we introduce the synthetic routes for SQs and their various applications in different kinds of solar cells, summarizing recent works as well as providing suggestions for future studies. Our introduction is mainly focused on the molecular modifications of SQ molecules with the purpose of improving their performances in various solar cells.
2. Synthetic routes of SQs
2.1. Condensation of squaric acid with nucleophiles
The most common method to synthesize SQs is the condensation of squaric acid with nucleophiles, which results in symmetrical SQs (Fig. 2). During the reaction, water obtained by the condensation is usually removed with a Dean–Stark condenser, leaving a solution of SQ behind.13,14

2.2. Condensation of squaric acid derivatives with nucleophiles
For the synthesis of unsymmetrical SQs, squaric acid derivatives, such as squaric acid esters and squarylium dichloride, are usually used as the starting materials (Fig. 3), which are considerably less reactive than squaric acid. As a consequence, the condensations usually result in semisquaric acid esters/squarylium chlorides. Both of the products can be converted into semisquaric acids after treatment with bases and/or acids. The condensation of semisquaric acid with another nucleophile produces unsymmetrical SQs.15

2.3. Synthesis of semisquaraine in situ
Most of the semisquaraines were synthesized by the condensation of squaric acid derivatives with electron-rich derivatives. The four-member ring of semisquaraines also could be constructed directly.16,17 Thus, chloride A was reacted with freshly prepared tetraethoxyethylene in the presence of triethylamine, and the reaction mixture was then treated with alumina in hexane to form compound B, which was smoothly hydrolyzed to semisquaraine C by 18% hydrochloric acid (Fig. 4).16 Using this route, Law and Bailey successfully synthesized a series of aromatic unsymmetrical SQs in 1992.17

2.4. Synthesis of 1,2-squaraines
The condensations of squaric acid yield mainly 1,3-SQs, but with minor impurities of 1,2-SQs.18 Thus, most studies of SQs are focused on 1,3-isomers, and the selective synthesis of 1,2-SQs is not fully developed. Ronchi et al. discovered that exclusive production of 1,2-SQs can only be acquired from condensation of squaric acid esters with highly reactive electron-rich precursors (Fig. 3). The reaction time, temperature and solvent also play important roles in reducing the 1,3-SQs yields.19
The abovementioned strategies are the four most common ones to synthesize squaraine compounds. The essence of the prevailing synthetic routes is nucleophilic substitution on the squaric acid core. The SQ molecules subsequently mentioned were all synthesized by one of the four methods; therefore, their synthetic details are not described. We will focus mainly on their structure–property relation, and their performances in solar cells.
3. SQs sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with the best performances are usually prepared by sensitizing titanium oxide nanocrystals with a ruthenium complex. To date, the best DSSC has a solar-to-electric power-conversion efficiency as high as 13% under standard air mass (AM) 1.5G simulated sunlight (1000 Wm−2) using an organo-metal sensitizer.20 Although inefficient at present, metal-free organic sensitizers are still under intensive investigation for their high molar absorption and potentially low cost. Moreover, large amounts of solar energy are in the red/IR region, in which Ru(II) complexes are not able to efficiently absorb, whereas many organic dyes such as SQs have intrinsic strong absorptions at this region.21 Thus, SQs have been constantly under research as one of the few metal-free sensitizers for metal oxide semiconductors (Fig. 5).22,23

Initial attempts towards effective sensitization seem to be unsuccessful.22,24 Although the photosensitization process was well understood as the injection of electrons from the excited dye molecules into the conduction band of the large band gap semiconductor, the molecules were not well optimized for such a charge-injection process. The photo-generated hole and electron were quickly recombined, leading to a poor incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) that is no higher than 0.1%.
Further studies have taken several approaches to modify the molecular structure in order to improve their efficiency.
3.1. Anchoring groups
Zhao et al. introduced anchoring groups into SQs, making great advances in cell efficiency. They used the (CH2)3SO3−Py+ group to attach SQ onto the TiO2 surface, reaching a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 2.17% (1).25 The adsorption of SQs has dramatic influences on the photovoltaic behaviors. The anchoring group on the heterocyclic nitrogen atom of SQ strongly binds to the active hydroxyl group at the TiO2 surface, building up electrical coupling between the excited state of SQ and the conduction band of TiO2.
Paterson et al. investigated the electron-injection process between SQ molecules and the TiO2 surface, providing a further understanding of anchoring group's function.26 They suggested that the excited complex will be formed more frequently by anchoring SQs on the TiO2 surface, which will give rise to the electron-transfer rate between SQs and TiO2.
After the first few trials, great developments have been made to improve the anchoring groups. Carboxyl and cyanoacrylic acids have become the most frequently used in molecular design.27,28 Firstly, these groups form strong bonds between SQs and TiO2; secondly, they can be easily introduced to the SQ molecules via synthesis; and thirdly, they are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which will help electron transfer towards TiO2. In this sense, the increasing polarity of the anchoring groups also helps to improve cell performances.29 To achieve better performance, two anchoring groups were sometimes used in one molecule (2).30 Anchoring groups intensify the interaction between dye molecules and metal oxides; therefore, dyes with two anchors significantly increase the dye-loading density. Consequently, higher dye-loading density indicates less metal oxide is exposed to electrolytes, leading to a suppression of dark current.
3.2. Unsymmetrical SQs
In 2004, Alex and co-workers suggested that asymmetry of the SQ molecules has great influence upon sensitization efficiency.31 They carried out molecular orbital calculations and found that upon excitation, the electrons of symmetric SQs tend to concentrate on the center of the molecules, whereas the unidirectional flow of electrons towards the anchoring moiety is favored in unsymmetrical SQs (Fig. 6). This directional flow results in improved charge transfer from the sensitizer to the TiO2 crystals. Compared to its symmetrical counterpart (molecule 10), asymmetrical molecule 11 showed improved the power-conversion efficiency due to its higher dipole moment.
 Fig. 6  Frontier molecular orbits of symmetric SQs and unsymmetrical SQs.31 
After the first success in the theory-assisted design of SQ sensitizers, many SQ molecules have been constructed in this way.31 Molecular orbital calculations are now routinely performed to obtain energy level information related to the excitation process.32–34 In an ideal situation, although the electron cloud is mainly located at the squaraine core or other electron-withdrawing groups conjugated to squaraine, which is supposed to be the electronegativity center, the electrons should flow to the anchoring group upon excitation, leading to a more efficient charge transfer to TiO2.35 This requires electrons to concentrate at one end of the molecule at ground states and to amass around the anchoring group at excited states. The asymmetry of electron flow is usually synergized by unsymmetrical molecular structures; thus, unsymmetrical SQs are naturally more competent than those of symmetrical. As shown in Fig. 7, this principle has been confirmed by both simulations and experiments. As a result, the introduction of asymmetry has become one of the most important design principles for efficient SQ sensitizers.

3.3. Energy level control of SQs
The major breakthrough of SQ-sensitized DSSCs power-conversion efficiency took place in 2007. Yum et al. set three basic rules guiding the construction of an efficient sensitizer: a perfect match between the excited-state redox potential and the energy of the conduction band of the oxide. Therefore, electron injection into the TiO2 crystals is possible; light excitation-induced electron flow from the sensitizer toward the TiO2 surface (vide supra) is possible; and a strong conjugation between the chromophores and the anchoring groups is observed.32 Following these guidelines, they designed an SQ molecule (3) with overall conversion efficiency (η) of 4.5%, which was the best at that time.
For the most commonly used DSSCs, in which the TiO2 crystal acts as an electron-accepting semiconductor and the I3−/I− pair is used to regenerate ground-state dye molecules, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) should be higher than the conduction band of the TiO2, and the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the sensitizer should also match the redox potential of I3−/I−.33,36
3.4. Panchromatic absorption
As mentioned above, the SQs' molecular structure can be easily manipulated using different reactants in the condensation reactions. In this sense, the SQs' absorption is also possible to be tuned.21 A wider window of absorbance usually leads to an improved IPCE, resulting in better short-circuit current (Jsc). As co-adsorption (see Section 3.6) requires the screening of different adsorption times of two or more kinds of sensitizers, device construction from a panchromatic absorbing SQ dye is much easier.
Shi and co-workers reported an SQ sensitizer with panchromatic absorption, covering much of the visible region with an IPCE of more than 50% (4).37 Similar attempts have been made by Li et al. (5, 6) using electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene or bithiophene-linked hexyloxyphenyl amino groups and SQ cores, and they achieved an absorption band across the entire visual spectra, extending to IR absorption as far as 800 nm.33 Dyes being able to absorb red-IR light have intrinsically low LUMO levels; therefore, the electron injected into the metal oxides has relatively low energy, resulting in a low open circuit voltage (Voc) value. This effect was also reflected in the low IPCE maximum of 5 and 6, and resulted in a relatively low η of 2.61%.
The antenna effect is also used to achieve panchromatic absorption. Instead of co-sensitizing TiO2 with various dyes, Warnan et al. covalently linked boradiazaindacene (BODIPY), zinc porphyrin (ZnP), and SQ units.38 Different chromophores maintained their own absorption nature; however, upon excitation, energy transfers from BODIPY, through ZnP, into SQ, resulting in an enhancement of the SQ sensitizer performance.
Most of the panchromatic absorbing SQs have an extended π conjugation. Although it indeed broadens the absorption window, this strategy also aggravates the π aggregation of the SQ sensitizers.27 Some simple strategies, such as attaching alkyl groups to the chromophores or coadsorption with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), may alleviate this problem. A better solution is perhaps twisting the conjugated system; thereby, no strong π aggregation could be formed between the molecules. Delcamp and co-workers designed a series of molecules using various structures as π bridges.39 Among them, sensitizer 7, which uses di-n-hexyl-substituted cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as the π bridge, is the most successful one. Due to the out-of-plane substitution groups on CPDT, the aggregation between SQ molecules was successfully hindered, leading to an efficient charge separation and a high-energy absorption band at the same time. The device fabricated with 7 reached an unprecedented high-power conversion efficiency of 7.3%, better than any other reported SQ-sensitized DSSCs.
3.5. Effects of alkyl groups
The aggregation of SQ on the TiO2 electrode often results in a decrease of sensitization efficiency, whereas the monomers of dye molecules can inject electrons into TiO2 more efficiently.40 The π aggregates of SQ usually lead to charge recombination; thus, energy captured upon excitation by the sensitizer cannot be sufficiently transferred to the oxide surface.
One of the solutions is the lengthening of the alkyl groups attached to the SQ molecules. Longer alkyl chains suppress the electron recombination, improving the Voc of the devices. Moreover, SQs with longer alkyl chains have higher dye-loading density, leading to an enhanced TiO2 surface-trap passivation.41,42 Therefore, the fabricated DSSCs have broader and more intense IPCE absorption, (e.g. molecule 8 has a broader absorption spectra than 9), leading to a higher Jsc value.42
3.6. Coadsorption with other molecules
Another solution to dye aggregation is the coadsorption with other molecules, typically using CDCA.36,43 CDCA competes with SQ for adsorption on TiO2 surface, limiting the growth of SQ aggregates and diminishing the recombination rate.39 Although slightly reducing the load of adsorbed SQs, DSSCs cosensitized with CDCA usually have much better performance (Fig. 7).44
The co-adsorption of SQs with other dyes is also used as a convenient method to achieve panchromatic absorption of the solar spectrum.45 Common SQs have high molar extinction coefficients around the red/IR region, whereas absorption ability at shorter wavelengths is relatively low. Synergetic sensitization with other short wavelength-absorbing dyes provides a rational way to resolve this problem.46 Because more photons can be converted into electricity, there is a significant increase in Jsc, which is responsible for the increase in the total power-conversion efficiency. In some cases, co-adsorbents act as both hole conductor and blue light absorbent in solid-state DSSCs, as shown in Fig. 8.47 Cosensitizing is a good choice when using two dyes; however, it becomes much more complicated to optimize the blending ratio when using three or more dyes.48

4. SQs in organic photovoltaic cells
Planar-heterojunction solar cells and bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells are two kinds of widely studied organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Both kinds of solar cells typically consist of two or more organic materials. They are commonly fabricated by solution processes; therefore, they have the potential to be produced inexpensively on a large scale and on flexible substrates. Their main differences lie in the fabrication processes, whereas the energy conversion mechanisms are same. Moreover, in recent literatures, BHJ solar cells are more commonly fabricated due to their advantages of having larger interfaces over planar-heterojunction cells; thus, BHJ cells are mostly discussed hereinafter.
The vital materials of OPVs are the donor and acceptor organic semiconductors. At present, the most commonly used acceptor materials are fullerene derivatives, such as (6,6)-phenyl C61 butyric acid methylester (PC61BM) and (6,6)-phenyl C71 butyric acid methylester (PC71BM). Although semiconducting polymers are the most commonly used donor materials, small molecule donors also have intrinsic advantages over the polymers such as good reproducibility and ease of purification. The major drawback of small molecular π-conjugated systems is perhaps the low absorbance in the red/IR region of the solar spectrum.49 SQ, a new kind of donor material, has the advantage of high red/IR absorbance, which can be used to resolve this problem (Fig. 9).50 The most urgent problem of SQ donors is that the molecules are planar and strongly interactive with each other; therefore, the aggregation within the donor phase is almost inevitable. Up to now, the highest power-conversion efficiency reached about 6.5%.51
4.1. Controlling the SQ layer morphology
In a BHJ solar-cell device, exciton formation takes place in both donor and acceptor domains, as well as at the donor/acceptor interface. All the excitons need to diffuse to the donor/acceptor interface for the charge separation and dissociation to occur. The separated holes and electrons then travel through the semiconducting materials to reach the electrodes. Because both the exciton formation and diffusion processes prefer a large donor/acceptor interface, a rough morphology of semiconductor layers that maximizes the interface is thought to be beneficial for higher BHJ cell efficiency.52,53 Therefore, charge transportation through the semiconducting layer should be less resisted; accordingly, charge transfer between the semiconducting molecules is expected to be improved by highly ordered microstructure of both donor/acceptor semiconductors.
In terms of charge transportation, the morphology of semiconductor layers can be a crucial influencing factor. Thus, controlled aggregation of SQ molecules should be studied to tackle this problem. Because SQs are highly polarized planar molecules, they are easy to form crystals in solid state. After deposition, the SQ–acceptor blending layer is usually amorphous. The most commonly used way to form ordered aggregates is to simply thermally anneal the coating. The SQ molecules will form small crystals due to π–π stacking, enhancing the charge-transfer ability of SQ layer. A more detailed study of annealing process was performed by Zimmerman et al. According to their experiments, annealing should be performed after the deposition of C60, thereby maintaining the roughness of the SQ–C60 interface, as well as improving order of the SQ bulk.54 The disorder of the interfacial molecules will minimize the polaron-pair recombination.55
 Fig. 9  Squaraines used in OPV devices as electron donors. 
Because SQ molecules can form both H-aggregates and J-aggregates, there should be a difference in the solar cell performance between these aggregation states. As illustrated in Fig. 10, in J-aggregates, holes can be transferred freely through the SQ domain, and the relatively large contact area between SQ and PCBM is also achieved, leading to a significant increase of Jsc, and higher power-conversion efficiency; therefore, J-aggregates are generally preferred in BHJ cells.56
 Fig. 10  Both the H-aggregates and J-aggregates provide sufficient conductance for charge transfer within SQ phases. H-aggregates of the SQ increase the Voc slightly; however, inefficient contact between SQ molecules and PCBM dramatically lowers the Jsc, resulting in poor PCE. On the other hand, J-aggregates of the SQ secures a large contact interface between the SQ and PCBM, making significant improvements in cell performance. Reproduced from ref. 56 with permission from the PCCP Owner Societies. 
Apart from thermal annealing, molecular design can also improve the aggregation of the SQs. Employing arylamine groups on the SQ molecules enhances the π–π stacking between the molecules, thereby improving the hole mobility within the SQ domain.57,58 Moreover, compared to the SQs with alkyl groups, alkenyl group-substituted SQs form extra interaction between alkenyl and phenyl groups (12, 13), enhancing the hole transfer efficiency of the devices.59
4.2. Lowering the HOMO of SQs
To achieve a higher Voc value in an SQ-based BHJ solar cell, there are two common methods: one is to reduce the charge recombination at the donor/acceptor interface, and the other is to lower the HOMO level of SQ donors, thereby increasing the band gap between the HOMO of the SQ and the LUMO of the PCBM. A typical practice is to employ various electron-withdrawing groups. Although many substituent groups such as pantafluorophenyl (14) and dicyanomethylene (15) have been tried, the most successful, by far, are the arylamine groups.60,61 Arylamine lowers the HOMO of 16 to −5.3 eV compared with −5.1 eV of 18 and enhances the π–π stacking of the SQ molecules at the same time.53,57 Other groups like pantafluorophenyl greatly disrupted the ordered morphology of the SQs, resulting in even poorer performance than the parent SQs. The further modification of arylamine groups is perhaps joining the aryl moieties with conjugations. For example, use the carbazole group instead of the N,N-diphenyl groups of molecule 12. The carbazole group has been used in OLEDs as a hole transporter, suggesting its potential to improve the electronic performances of the SQ donors.62,63 Moreover, it was found to deepen the HOMO of the SQs greatly, thus elevating the Voc of the solar cells.64
4.3. Panchromatic absorption of SQ donors
A panchromatic absorption is also desired for the improvement of external quantum efficiency, which in turn increases the Jsc of the device. Similar to the DSSCs, SQ blends, dye ensembles and asymmetry are used as valid strategies.
As shown in Fig. 11, the simplest solution to broaden absorption is blending red-IR harvesting SQs with molecules of higher absorption wavelengths. The Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the different donor materials will enable efficient panchromatic energy harvests, increasing the Jsc of the device.65 However, an efficient FRET between the different dye molecules requires the overlap of one dye's emission spectrum and another's absorption spectrum. Moreover, both blended molecules, which should be similar in structure with the SQ main body, and blending ratio should be carefully controlled, otherwise there will not be any efficient pathway for hole transportation.66,67
 Fig. 11  Blending of the SQs to broaden the absorption window of donor materials.66 
Another feasible method is to assemble SQ with molecules of different absorption bands. Silvestri and co-workers have constructed an ensemble of the SQ and phthalocyanine (Pc). Although this ensemble (19) has both characteristic absorption of the SQ and Pc, the high dark current leads to poor power-conversion efficiency.68
The most promising solution perhaps lies in the SQ molecule itself. To enhance the absorption of high-energy solar radiation, there should be an electron-withdrawing group directly connected to the squaraine core.66 Asymmetry formed by an electron-withdrawing group (20) can both introduce new short-wavelength absorption to the SQ absorption spectrum and broaden the long wavelength absorption.69
The performances of some representative SQ-based solar cells are listed in Table 1. SQ-based OPV solar cells are indeed less efficient than DSSCs, and the design strategies of the OPVs are vague and uncertain compared to DSSCs. It is conceivable that OPVs have room for improvements in the near future, as OPVs are attracting increasing attention for new solar-cell research.

5. Summary
SQs have been widely used in DSSCs and OPV solar cells for their intense absorption at the red-IR region of the solar spectrum. However, the conventional SQ's absorption band is too narrow for the cells to reach high Jsc value, provoking various molecular design and diverse synthetic routes to acquire these molecules in recent years. Much attention was focused on the molecular modification of the SQs to optimize SQ-based DSSC and OPV devices. Several design strategies of SQ molecules are presented for both kinds of solar cells as guidelines for further study. However, there is no established theory to guide further development of commercially available organic solar cells, thus further attempts should be made to acquire more fundamental insights. Moreover, the importance of device fabrication techniques should not be neglected.
SQs are red-IR absorbing materials; however, they themselves are still unable to cover the entire solar spectrum. In this sense, cooperation with other blue-absorbing dyes is an efficient way to improve the performance of SQ-based solar cells. FRET has proven itself an effective way to make this cooperation possible for both kinds of solar cells, but it requires spectra overlap between the different dyes. π-bridging is a molecule design strategy to enhance energy transfer, which provides more opportunities for the dye combinations and enables the dye cooperation without the restriction of spectral overlap. Furthermore, due to the versatility of the SQ's core substitution, the formation of π bridges is becoming a feasible way to further exploit the application of the SQ molecules in photovoltaic cells.

 	Fig. 1  The reports on SQs are directly collected from the Web of Science, from 1986 to 2012. SQ photovoltaics include SQ-composited dye-sensitized solar cells and organic photovoltaics. Other less intensely studied solar cells are not presented.	 

 	Fig. 2  Synthetic route starting from squaric acid.	 

 	Fig. 3  Synthetic route starting from squaric acid esters and squarylium chloride.	 

 	Fig. 4  [2 + 2] cycloaddition of 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)acetyl chloride and 1,1,2,2-tetraethoxyethene.	 

 	Fig. 5  Squaraines used in DSSC device.	 

 	Fig. 6  Frontier molecular orbits of symmetric SQs and unsymmetrical SQs.31	 

 	Fig. 7  Effect of CDCA addition on the photovoltaic performance of SQ-4. Thin solid line (action spectra), whereas lines with symbol represents the I–V curve.36	 

 	Fig. 8  SQ-sensitized titanium oxide undergoes a photoelectric process: with incident light or the energy transferred from other dyes, the excited molecules inject electrons into TiO2, creating the driving force of the DSSCs. Reproduced from ref. 47 with permission from the PCCP Owner Societies.	 

 	Fig. 9  Squaraines used in OPV devices as electron donors.	 

 	Fig. 10  Both the H-aggregates and J-aggregates provide sufficient conductance for charge transfer within SQ phases. H-aggregates of the SQ increase the Voc slightly; however, inefficient contact between SQ molecules and PCBM dramatically lowers the Jsc, resulting in poor PCE. On the other hand, J-aggregates of the SQ secures a large contact interface between the SQ and PCBM, making significant improvements in cell performance. Reproduced from ref. 56 with permission from the PCCP Owner Societies.	 

 	Fig. 11  Blending of the SQs to broaden the absorption window of donor materials.66
