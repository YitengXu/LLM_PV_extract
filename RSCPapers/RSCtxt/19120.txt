    , Accepted 5th September 2014First published on 5th September 2014AbstractConversion electrodes, the materials of choice for the next generation lithium-ion battery (LIB), are mainly limited to metal oxides. In this work, we have investigated the electrochemical performance of chemically synthesized Cu(OH)2 nanoflower arrays. A 50:50 composite of Cu(OH)2 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) showed a reversible capacity of 522 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 with 95% retention of capacity after 50 cycles. The results demonstrate that it can be a competitive choice over the corresponding oxides as an anode for LIB.
Introduction
The development of a high energy density lithium-ion battery with the capability of high charge–discharge rates is the key for the success of electric vehicles (EV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and backup power for wind or solar energy.1–3 In order to meet both energy density and power density demands, it has become necessary to find suitable anode materials with a high rate capability and safety in order to replace the conventional carbonaceous anodes, which suffer from low specific capacity (372 mA h g−1 theoretically), poor Li+ intercalation kinetics and safety concerns.4 Since the first report by Tarascon et al.,5 in recent years, the research focus in the search for a new anode material is gradually shifting from the traditional intercalation chemistry to conversion based mechanisms. Studies in this vein are mainly concentrated on different metal oxides because of their high capacities, though the electrochemistry driven conversion reaction is a general phenomenon and known to occur in phosphides, nitrides and sulphides as well.6,7 Extensive work has been performed on various metal oxides such as Mn2O3,8,9 Mn3O4,10–12 CoO,13–16 Co3O4,17–19 Fe2O3,20–22 Fe3O4,23–25 SnO2,26–28 V2O5,29–31 CuO,32–34 and NiO35–37etc. Some excellent reviews are also available in the literature.38–40 In general, although high specific capacity can be realized, the conversion reactions in metal oxides are associated with large volume expansion, which leads to potential hysteresis and results into substantial capacity fade upon cycling. Nonetheless, through the development of hierarchical porous nanostructures or core–shell nanomaterials, some excellent performances have been achieved with metal oxides.41–43
Interestingly, studies on corresponding metal hydroxides as a LIB anode are scant, possibly in apprehension of the presence of the OH group, although Ni(OH)2 has long been used in secondary alkaline batteries. So far, only a few studies are available in which Ni(OH)2 or Ni, Co mixed hydroxide have been used as an anode.44–46 With a composite of the β-form of hexagonal Ni(OH)2 nanoflowers with a brucite like structure and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), specific capacity as high as 1416 mA h g−1 is reported but with sharp fading upon cycling, retaining only 30% of capacity after 50 cycles.44 Good lithium storage properties (927 mA h g−1) of β-Ni(OH)2@reduced graphene oxide composite are also reported by Li et al.,45 but again with a poor capacity retention (54.7% after 30 cycles). By growing Ni(OH)2 directly on Ni foam by a hydrothermal method, Ni et al.46 have achieved good cycle ability; however, the material still exhibited a poor cycle life when tested in the powder form. A few studies were also directed to investigate the supercapacitive properties of metal hydroxides47–52 and high specific capacitance values were reported for layered mixed, Co–Ni hydroxide nanocones (1580 Fg−1)47 and amorphous Ni(OH)2 electrodes (2188 Fg−1).52 These results indicate that metal hydroxides do possess interesting electrochemical properties that could be utilised for lithium battery anodes as well.
Cu(OH)2 has a layered structure with interlayered H-bonds in a cage-like framework.53-56 Such structural features can provide large interlayer spacing for rapid transfer/exchange of Li+ ions and increase the effective active material–electrolyte interface area, favouring good intercalation properties. Gao et al.54 reported good hydrogen storage properties of Cu(OH)2 nanoribbons. It is also a candidate material for sensor applications owing to its exceptional magnetic sensitivity toward intercalation of molecular anions.57 However, until now, there has been no report on the electrochemical properties of Cu(OH)2 as an anode in LIB. Although Cu(OH)2 can be conveniently synthesized from solutions of Cu(II)56 or from surface oxidation of Cu foil,53 preparation of nanowire/nanotube arrays with tailored morphology through a solution chemistry approach is still a challenge. Motivated by this challenge, in this work, we report a simple wet-chemical method to synthesize Cu(OH)2 nanoflowers (NF) and demonstrate the performance of a synergic composite of a Cu(OH)2 nanoflower array and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) as an advanced anode material for LIB in which hierarchical porous association of nanoparticles offers a large surface area and high surface to volume ratio, reducing the Li+ ion diffusion length. Moreover, the presence of MWCNTs provides a conduction network for enhancing electron transport.
Experimental section
Synthesis of Cu(OH)2 nanoflowers
The chemicals used were in the as-received form, without further purification. In all experiments, ultrapure water obtained from a three-stage Millipore Mill-Q (Merck, Germany) purification system was used. In a typical synthesis, first a 0.05 M aqueous solution (250 ml) of copper nitrate nonahydrate [Cu(NO3)2·9H2O] was prepared at room temperature (28 °C) under strong magnetic stirring. Then 5 ml of 25% ammonia (RANKEM) solution was added slowly, and after that, 0.01 M NaOH solution (5 ml) was added under stirring. The solution was heated at 60 °C for 1 h and thereafter cooled to room temperature. The resulting bluish precipitate was centrifuged, copiously washed to neutral pH with water, and finally, washed with acetone. The product, Cu(OH)2, was then dried at 80 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven.
Preparation of Cu(OH)2–MWCNT nanocomposites
MWCNTs (purity 95%, ash content < 1.5%) were purchased from CheapTubes, USA. The outer diameter, length and surface area of the MWCNTs were <8 nm, 10–30 μm and 500 m2 g−1 respectively. Various compositions of Cu(OH)2–MWCNT composites were prepared by simple hand grinding for about 1 h using a mortar and a pestle. The samples were dried at 80 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven to remove any adsorbed moisture and thereafter kept in a sealed glass bottle until further characterization. Four composites were prepared with weight ratios of 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50 of Cu(OH)2 and MWCNTs, respectively.
Material characterization
Powder XRD was recorded in the 2θ range, 10°–80°, at a scanning rate of 2° min−1 by an X-ray diffractometer (Philips X'Pert, The Netherlands) with a Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Phase analysis and Rietveld refinement were performed using PANalytical X'pert Highscore Plus software. A BOMEN infrared spectrophotometer was used to record FTIR spectra in transmission mode in the wave number range 4000–400 cm−1. Microstructural and morphology of the synthesized powder were investigated using a ZEISS Supra 35 (Germany) field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). A transmission electron microscope (TEM), Tecnai G2 30ST (FEI), operating at 300 kV was used to obtain the high resolution TEM images (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The prepared composites have been further characterized by Raman spectroscopy in the wavenumber range of 1000–3000 cm−1 with a Renishaw In Via Reflex micro Raman spectrometer using the 514 nm line of an Ar+ ion laser for excitation. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the powder samples were performed under argon flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a Simultaneous Thermal Analyser (STA449F, Netzsch, Germany). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements were carried out by nitrogen gas adsorption at 77.3 K using a Quantachrome (USA) Autosorb surface analyser. The samples were degassed under vacuum at 150 °C for 3 h before measurement. Pore size distribution was calculated from the desorption isotherm by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical properties of the prepared composites were evaluated by fabricating 2032 type coin cells vs. Li/Li+. The working electrode was constructed by making a slurry of active material [Cu(OH)2–MWCNT nanocomposites], Super-P conducting agent and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, in a weight ratio of 80:10:10 in n-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent. The slurry was coated on a copper foil (thickness 15 μm) and dried at 110 °C for 5 h in a vacuum oven. After pressing the coated foil at 4.0 ton per inch, the electrode was cut into a circular disk with an area 1.76 cm2. The active mass of the electrodes were ∼2.5 mg. Coin cells were assembled with these working electrodes using lithium metal as the counter electrode as well as the reference electrode, Celgard 2300 as the separator and 1.0 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC (1:2 vol%) as the electrolyte within an argon-filled glove box (M'BRAUN, Germany) in which the moisture and oxygen levels were kept at <0.5 ppm. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted in the potential window of 0.01–3.0 V at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 by using a galvanostat-potentiostat (PGSTAT30, Autolab, The Netherlands). Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out in the same potential window using an automatic battery tester (BT2000, Arbin, USA) with a constant current density of 0.05 mA cm−2 for the initial formation cycle and different current densities ranging from 0.1–0.4 mA cm−2 for subsequent cycles. The same current density was used for both discharge and charge in each case. Electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded on a galvanostat-potentiostat (PGSTAT302N, Autolab, The Netherlands) in the frequency range of 10 MHz to 1 MHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV.
For ex situ XRD measurements, coin cells were fabricated using pellets of the prepared composite powder as the working electrode. After the cells were discharged or charged to the desired potential, the cells were dismantled, the pellets were washed with NMP and acetone, and the samples were ground to obtain powders for XRD measurements.
For calculation of the specific capacity of the composites, the masses of both Cu(OH)2 and MWCNTs were taken into account; the values reported here are based on considering the total mass of the composites as active mass.
Results and discussion
To determine the phase purity and crystallinity, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted and the diffractogram for the as-prepared Cu(OH)2 nanoflowers is shown in Fig. 1a. All of the observed peaks can be indexed to the orthorhombic phase of Cu(OH)2 (space group Cmc21). As shown in Fig. 1a, Rietveld refinement of the phase provided a good fit with Rprofile (Rp), Rweighted profile (Rwp) and goodness of fit (χ2) values of 4.1256%, 5.1070%, and 1.3136%, respectively. The obtained lattice parameters, a = 2.9528(1) Å, b = 10.5938(7) Å, and c = 5.2770(4) Å, are in good agreement with JCPDS data (file number 01-080-0656) for spertiniite and also, with the literature values,54 indicating high purity of the sample. A schematic representation of the coordination assembly of Cu(OH)2 is shown in Fig. 1b. Within the non-centrosymmetric space group (Cmc21), the Cu–O coordination is square pyramidal and the calculated Cu–O distances within the equatorial plane of square pyramid are found to be 1.951(3) and 1.954(3) Å with an apical distance of 2.365(4) Å. By sharing the equilateral edges along [100], chains of the octahedral are formed, building up corrugated layers perpendicular to the b-axis. Interconnection of these layers is made through hydrogen bonds. In the hydrogen bonds, the O–H distance is 1.926(3) Å and the O–O distance is 2.913(5) Å. These values are in excellent agreement with the refinement results of Oswald et al.56 FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†) also confirms the formation of Cu(OH)2. The presence of a peak at 3560 cm−1 reflects intermolecular hydrogen bonding in Cu(OH)2.57,58 Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the synthesized Cu(OH)2 is thermally stable up to ∼192 °C, above which it is oxidised to CuO (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples were examined by FE-SEM and TEM. The low magnification FESEM image (Fig. 2a) reveals uniformly distributed bundles of nanorods, formed in a flower-like shape. The high magnification FESEM image (inset of Fig. 2a) clearly shows that these nanorod bundles are of size (length 2–5 μm and diameter 60–120 nm) with smooth surface walls. From the side view in the low resolution TEM image (Fig. 2b), it is found that long nanorod bundles are actually twisted at the centre and protruded widely in a outward fashion, giving rise to a flower-like shape in the normal view as observed by FESEM. The average cross-sectional diameter of a nanorod, as observed by TEM (Fig. 2c), is around 30 nm. The absence of contrast between the tip and the surface in the TEM image indicates these are nanorods rather than nanotubes. The high-resolution TEM image (HRTEM), shown in Fig. 2d demonstrates the polycrystalline nature of these bundled Cu(OH)2 nanowires. The observed lattice fringes of 2.52, 2.35, 2.05 and 1.70 Å correspond to the (111), (022), (131) and (150) crystallographic planes of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2. The selected area diffraction pattern (SAED), shown in Fig. 2e, further confirms that the nanorods are well crystallized and polycrystalline in nature. All the observed rings could be assigned to the characteristic lattice planes of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2. The preference of Cu2+ for square planar coordination with OH− leads to extended chains, which in turn, can be interlinked to form a two-dimensional (2D) structure through coordination of OH to dz2 of Cu2+.59 Through hydrogen bonding, these 2D layers are stacked upon one another. However, a difference in relative growth rates of different crystal faces is the most influential factor on the final morphology of the nanomaterials. In case of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2, the growth rate is proportional to 1/dhkl, and therefore, growth along [100] far outpaces the growth along other directions.53 Moreover, in the alkaline conditions used for the synthesis, the interlayer H-bonding is weakened. Thus, nanorods are formed with a high aspect ratio and due to the interfacial tension are bundled in a self-assembled flower-like shape. Inner textural architecture, such as surface area, pore size and their distribution, strongly influences the performance of the LIB electrode. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution plots for synthesized Cu(OH)2 nanoflowers and the Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 composite are shown in Fig. 3a and b respectively. For both cases, the isotherms are convex in nature up to P/P0 = 1.0, which is typical for type III isotherms; a discrete hysteresis loop starting from P/P0 = 0.4 reveals a mixed H3 and H1 type, indicating the presence of inter-particles as well as structural pores. The corresponding pore size distributions, calculated from the adsorption part of the isotherms, show the mesoporous nature. Both the distribution plots are characterized by two somewhat narrow pore-size distributions centred respectively at ∼4 and ∼6 nm, indicating structural pores and a broad pore-size distribution in the range of 10–20 nm, indicating inter-particle pores. The BET surface areas of Cu(OH)2 nanoflowers and the Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 composite are calculated to be 13.3 m2 g−1 and 131.3 m2 g−1 with respective pore volumes of 0.013 and 0.227 cm3 g−1 nm−1. A significant increase in pore volume is noticed for Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50, probably originating from the increase in inter-particle pore volume.

The electrochemical properties of Cu(OH)2–MWCNT nanoflowers were studied by fabricating 2032 type coin cells vs. Li/Li+. At first, the Li intercalation/de-intercalation potentials and the associated redox reactions were examined by cyclic voltammetry in the potential window of 0.01–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The first three successive CV scans for an as-assembled cell with Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 as the electrode are shown in Fig. 4a. In the first cathodic scan, a broad peak appears at 2.7–1.7 V centred at ∼1.92 V, suggesting gradual multistep reduction of Cu(OH)2 to Cu2O through formation of LiOH and intermediate CuxO (2 > x > 1). This reduction process is irreversible and not observed in subsequent cycles. The other two reduction peaks observed at ∼1.39 and 0.60 V correspond to further decomposition of Cu2O into metallic Cu and Li2O, and reductive decomposition of the carbonate electrolytes to form a SEI layer.60,61 The anodic peaks at ∼1.5, ∼2.5 and ∼2.79 V are due to subsequent oxidation of Cu to Cu2O and partial oxidation to CuO, respectively.33,62 It is noticed that from the second cycle onwards, cathodic scans in the CV are different to that observed in the first scan. The presence of a peak at ∼2.37 V can be ascribed to reduction of CuO into Cu2O.4,61,62 The other two reduction peaks, at 1.35 and 0.78 V, are found to be shifted to a higher voltage compared to those observed in the first scan, and represent further decomposition of Cu2O into metallic Cu and Li2O. To obtain further insight into the electrochemical reaction mechanism, ex situ X-ray diffraction studies were conducted. Four as-assembled cells, with pellets of Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 as the working electrode, were discharged or charged up to different potentials of 0.05, 1.38, 2.03 and 3.00 V, and X-ray diffractograms were taken from the respective powders after dismantling the cells. Fig. 4b shows the obtained diffractograms at different states of charge (SOC) of the Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 electrode during the initial cycle. It is found that when Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 is discharged to 0.05 V, the X-ray diffractogram is completely changed compared to that of the parent compound, and several new peaks appear. The presence of Cu0 is indicated by the peaks observed at 2θ = 43.41° (111), 50.32° (200) and 74.14° (220), which correspond to the reflections from the (111), (200) and (220) planes of cubic Cu [JCPDS 01-085-1326]. However, the peaks at 2θ = 42.30° and 61.30° indicate the presence of some Cu2O [(200), (220), JCPDS 00-005-0667], probably due to incomplete reduction in the initial cycle. It is also observed that a significant amount Li2CO3 is formed during the first discharge by the irreversible reactions, which is a commonly observed phenomenon for carbonate-based electrolytes.65 When the cell is charged, the intensities of the peaks for Cu at 2θ = 43.41° and 50.32° are gradually diminished and are absent for the cell charged to 3.00 V, due to oxidation of Cu to CuxO. The presence of cubic CuO is confirmed by the peaks observed at 36° (111), 42° (200), 61° (220), and 74° (311) (JCPDS 01-78-0428), but probable existence of some residual Cu2O cannot be ruled out.

Therefore, the electrochemical conversion reactions occurring in Cu(OH)2 can be described as: Cu(OH)2 + 2Li+ +2e− → CuO + 2LiOH(1) CuO + Li+ + e− ↔ 1/2Cu2O + 1/2Li2O(2) 1/2Cu2O + Li+ + e− ↔ Cu + 1/2Li2O(3)

Fig. 5 shows galvanostatic discharge–charge profiles for Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 in the potential window of 0.01–3.0 V at a current density of 0.05 mA cm−2 for the first cycle and at 0.1 mA cm−2 for selected subsequent cycles (2nd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th and 50th). The observed plateaus in the voltage profiles are consistent with the corresponding redox peaks as found in CV (Fig. 4a). The sloping nature of the plateaus is the characteristic signature of gradual multistep redox processes associated with conversion reactions. Excellent reproducibility of voltage profiles from the 2nd to 50th cycle indicates a high degree of reversibility of the electrochemical processes in Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50. A comparison of the first cycle voltage profiles for all compositions (Fig. S3, ESI†) shows that the initial charge capacity (421 mA h g−1) of pristine Cu(OH)2 increases to 681 mA h g−1 for Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-80:20. This suggests an increase in electron transport by utilising the conductive network in MWCNTs. On further addition of MWCNTs, a decrease in capacity is observed due to a decrease in Cu(OH)2 content and a value of 572 mA h g−1 is obtained for Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50. The TEM image of Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 (Fig. S4, ESI†) reveals clusters of short nanorod bundles of Cu(OH)2 (derived from partial destruction of the flower-like grains by hand grinding) with an intimate attachment of MWCNTs over them, which would enhance intra-grain and inter-grain electron transport. At the same time, MWCNTs would also act as a buffer matrix to absorb the volume changes associated with the conversion reactions. However, the presence of carbon would also lead to increased side reactions with the electrolyte at low potentials during the initial discharge, as commonly associated with conversion reactions,5,63 as well as consumption of Li in the SEI layer and thereby, all composites except Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 show a low Columbic efficiency of 50–57%. Interestingly, a very high Columbic efficiency of 84% is observed for Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50, which may be attributed to synergic interaction with MWCNTs. The presence of structural disorder and defect sites within the nanocluster surfaces may act as nucleating sites, promoting side reactions at low potentials. In order to estimate the degree of structural disorder and defects, Raman spectroscopy was carried out in the wavenumber range 1000–3000 cm−1 (Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†). From analysis of the observed D, G and G′ bands and respective ID/IG and IG′/IG ratios, it was found that the Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 composite contains the lowest degree structural disorder/number of defects. This may partly explain the observed high first cycle columbic efficiency observed in this composite. Moreover, the formation of the SEI layer by decomposition of carbonate electrolytes on the surface of electrode materials at low potentials and subsequent reversible storage of extra Li may contribute to the observed high capacity of Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50, exceeding the calculated theoretical capacity (550 mA h g−1); such phenomena are widely reported in the literature for conversion electrodes.33,60,64 However, possible electrochemical participation of LiOH cannot be completely ruled out. Hu et al.65 have shown that additional capacity in RuO2/Li cells can be related to conversion of LiOH into Li2O and LiH (eqn (4)), which is partially reversible. LiOH + 2Li+ + 2e− ↔ Li2O + LiH(4)

The cycling behaviour of all four Cu(OH)2–MWCNT composites was tested for 50 cycles at a constant current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 and is shown in Fig. 5b along with that of pristine Cu(OH)2 and MWCNTs. A reversible capacity of 220–250 mA h g−1 is observed for MWCNTs. Pristine Cu(OH)2 shows a capacity of 224 mA h g−1, which reduces to 36 mA h g−1 by the 50th cycle, retaining only 16% of the capacity. As expected, for the Cu(OH)2–MWCNT composites with a MWCNT content of 20–40 wt%, both capacities (536–637 mA h g−1) and their retention (60–65%) were vastly improved (Fig. 5b and S6, ESI†), due to the favourable effects of MWCNTs as discussed before. Significantly, for Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50, a specific capacity of 522 mA h g−1 is observed with 95% retention up to 50 cycles. These values are even superior to those reported for CuO,32–34 thus demonstrating that Cu(OH)2 might be a better electrode material than CuO. Here, in addition to Li2O as an inactive matrix buffering the volume change, the presence of LiOH might also be responsible for the observed steady cycling behaviour. The rate performance and capacity restoration capability of Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 were studied at different current densities ranging from 0.05–0.4 mA cm−2 for 20 cycles each, and the results are shown in Fig. 5c. At a slow rate of 0.05 cm−2, in the first few cycles, fluctuations in the capacity are observed due to activation of the electrode and gradual growth of the polymer layer on the surface.10,17–19 Thereafter, a somewhat steady capacity of ∼550 mA h g−1 is observed. The capacity is marginally lowered to ∼520 mA h g−1 when the current density is doubled to 0.1 mA cm−2 (cycles 21–40). Even at a high current density of 0.4 mA cm−2, a reversible capacity of 410 mA h g−1 is observed (cycles 61–80). To check the capacity restoration capability, the cell was then cycled for an additional 20 cycles (80th to 100th) at 0.05 mA cm−2. A capacity value of ∼510 mA h g−1 is observed, which means that ∼93% of the capacity is restored with respect to the steady capacity obtained at 0.05 mA cm−2 in first 20 cycles. These results further highlight the potential applicability of Cu(OH)2 as an anode in LIB.

Fig. 5d shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 at various cycling intervals. All the spectra show a depressed semicircle followed by a sharp Warburg peak. The impedance data were fitted with an equivalent circuit as shown in the inset of Fig. 5d, and the fitted parameters are given in Table S2, ESI.† It is observed that the solution resistance (Rs) increases only slightly from 1.2 Ω in the as-assembled state to 4.9 Ω after 100 cycles, indicating good stability of the electrode. Initially after the first cycle, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) increases from 70.5 Ω in the as-assembled state to 101 Ω due to the conversion reactions. However, Rct decreases to about 48 Ω after 20 cycles, and thereafter, no significant change occurs with cycling, indicating excellent reversibility of the electrochemical reactions. Interestingly, a capacitive nature has been observed in all the spectra with capacitance values of 12–22 mF. The high surface area of the material may lead to electrical double layer capacitive (EDLC) behaviour. Being mesoporous, ion-buffering reservoirs can be formed in the macropores to minimize the diffusion distances to the interior surfaces. Additionally, mesoporous walls act as low-resistant pathways for ion movement through the porous particles, and the micropores strengthen the electrical double layer capacitance.66
In order to examine possible morphological changes upon cycling, FESEM studies were conducted with Cu(OH)2–MWCNT-50:50 powder before cycling and after 50 cycles. As shown in Fig. 6, no significant difference in morphology is observed except that the distribution of the particles seems to be more uniform in the cycled powder. This is probably due to the activation of the electrodes, which commonly occurs in conversion electrodes.

Conclusions
In conclusion, it is demonstrated that Cu(OH)2 can be an effective high performance lithium-ion battery anode. A reversible capacity in excess of 500 mA h g−1 could be achieved for a 50:50 composite of Cu(OH)2 and MWCNTs. Good rate performance and capacity restoration properties together with excellent reversibility make Cu(OH)2 a competitive choice compared to its oxide counterpart. The present results will stimulate renewed interest in other metal hydroxides as lithium-ion battery anode.
