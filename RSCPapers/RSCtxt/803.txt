1. Introduction
The future of mankind relies on our ability to produce, store, and utilize fuels for energy production.1 The ever-increasing energy consumption, in conjunction with problems associated with global warming and rapid depletion of fossil fuels, demands highly efficient energy conversion and storage devices, which, in turn, calls for the efficient development of advanced electrode materials and catalysts.2 Electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, including water electrolyzers, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors, are widely recognized as being among the most interesting and efficient ways to overcome the above problems. The prospects of electrochemical energy technologies depend on the efficiency, stability, production costs, and environmental effects of the electrode materials involved. While noble metals such as Pt, Ru, Ir, and their composites remain the most efficient electrocatalysts, their high cost and limited availability severely hamper their practical application.3–12 In order to solve these problems, various noble metal-free catalysts with high activity towards electrochemical energy conversion and storage have been actively pursued.13–19 However, the performances of these systems are generally inferior to those of noble metal-based catalysts. Therefore, we still need to identify new low-cost, highly active, and stable electrode materials with excellent charge transfer efficiency and abundant catalytically active sites. Furthermore, there is growing demand for the development of renewable and highly efficient methods to produce energy conversion and storage materials.
Following the advent of graphene and graphene oxide, numerous two-dimensional (2D) materials based on transition metal (TM) dichalcogenides, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), metal coordination polymers, and other systems have recently received considerable attention.20–24 Layered materials composed of two or more elements offer huge opportunities for a myriad of applications, arising from their compositional diversity and structural flexibility. A new family of 2D early transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, usually referred to as MXenes, has recently been discovered.25–27 In general, MXenes are prepared from MAX phases consisting of layered ternary carbides with the formula Mn+1AXn, where M is an early transition metal (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, or Ta), A is an element from groups 12–16 (Cd, Al, Si, P, S, Ga, Ge, As, In, Sn, Tl, Pb, or S), and X is carbon and/or nitrogen.28–32 MXenes, with surface-exposed transition metal sheets, are synthesized by selective etching of A elements from the MAX phase using strong acids and exfoliation.28–30,33 The relatively strong metallic bonds between M and A in the corresponding Mn+1AXn phases are replaced by weaker hydrogen bonds with OH, O, or F, upon replacement of the A elements by using aqueous HF as the etching agent at room temperature as shown in Fig. 1.27,28,34 Therefore, the process of etching and exfoliation typically functionalizes the MXene sample with hydroxyl, oxygen, and fluorine groups. First-principles calculations show that the electronic structure of the resulting MXenes is significantly different from that of their parent MAX phases. For instance, the functionalization with OH, O, and F leads to a transition from metallic to semiconducting behaviour.38 Several reviews on the synthesis and properties of MXenes have recently been published.27,35–38

Among various areas of application, MXenes have recently received considerable attention for energy conversion and storage technologies, including water splitting, supercapacitors, and batteries,23,28,29,31–57 due to their outstanding physicochemical properties such as hardness, high melting point, excellent oxidation resistance, high electrical and thermal conductivity, hydrophilic nature, high surface area, and capability to host a broad range of intercalants.35,42,45,58–62 A timely and focused review of MXene materials is expected to further accelerate the development of these emerging materials and promote their application to solve energy conversion and storage issues. Herein, the latest trends in the synthesis, characterization, and application of MXenes in the electrochemical field are presented. In the first section, we discuss current synthetic approaches for these exciting 2D materials. The following section then describes the application of MXenes as electrode materials for energy conversion and storage, including electrocatalysts for water splitting reactions, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. Finally, we present an outlook on future research directions focused on the development of 2D MXene materials for various electrochemical applications.
2. Synthetic approaches for 2D MXenes
In general, MXenes are produced by selective etching of certain atomic layers from their layered MAX precursors, which belong to a very large family of ternary carbides and nitrides, with more than 70 members. Before the discovery of MXenes, several techniques had been applied to etch the MAX phase, including reactions with gaseous halides, high-temperature (up to 800 °C) reactions using molten salts, and etching of the A elements in vacuum.63–66 However, these routes often produced cubic (instead of 2D) carbides and carbon, due to the removal of both M and A elements from the MAX phase. MAX compounds have hexagonal structures composed of alternately stacked MX (transition metal carbides or nitrides) and planar A (group 12–16 elements) layers; the MX layers are held together by interleaved atomic layers of A species via partial ionic bonds, as shown in Fig. 2A.67 Anasori et al. have published an overview of all known MAX phases, along with their structures and the detailed synthetic approaches used to prepare MXenes.37 Removal of the A atomic layer and exfoliation are the essential steps to obtain the 2D MXene from the corresponding MAX phase. However, the extraction of the Mn+1Xn layers from the MAX phase by physical methods is difficult, due to the rigid metallic M–A bonds in the MAX precursor. Therefore, selective removal of the A elements from the MAX phase represents the key step for the synthesis of MXene materials. A simple but very effective approach to extract the A layers from the MAX phase, involving HF treatment followed by ultrasonication to facilitate the exfoliation into 2D MXenes, was first reported by Gogotsi's group.25 M–A bonds can be broken because they are relatively weaker than the M–X bonds. The most commonly adopted selective etching and surface functionalization process using HF can be described by the following equations: Mn+1AXn + 3HF → AF3 + 3/2H2 + Mn+1Xn(1) Mn+1Xn + 2H2O → Mn+1Xn(OH)2 + H2(2) Mn+1Xn + 2HF → Mn+1XnF2 + H2(3)

Eqn (1) represents the step used to extract the A elements from the MAX phase, yielding the Mn+1Xn phase. Eqn (2) and (3) describe the functionalization steps of the Mn+1Xn phase with OH and F elements, respectively, forming Mn+1XnTx (T = OH or F). The electrophilic nature of the metal in the Mn+1Xn phase leads to its facile surface functionalization with electron-donating species (T), which is an important feature because T can influence the physical and chemical properties of the MXene product. However, in some cases, no additional delamination step is required, due to the simultaneous exfoliation during the etching process. Furthermore, instead of using aqueous HF directly, the in situ formation of HF has also been successfully employed for obtaining MXenes from MAX phases; for example, HF can be formed from the reaction of hydrochloric acid–lithium fluoride solution, ammonium fluoride, and ammonium hydrogen bifluoride.31,68–70 The etching of A elements from MAX phases is affected by several factors such as structure, atomic bonding, and particle size.37 For example, a higher atomic number of M requires a stronger etchant, due to the strength of the M–A bonds. Additionally, when etchants other than HF are used (e.g., NH4HF2), a longer time is required for complete exfoliation;68 the in situ intercalation of NH3 and NH4+ species between Ti3C2Tx layers leads to the detachment of Ti3C2Tx bundled into few-layer sheets. No additional delamination step is required in this case because etching and exfoliation occur simultaneously. Furthermore, fluoride salts such as LiF, NaF, and KF have also been used (together with HCl) as etchants instead of HF for the synthesis of various MXenes.31,60,62,71 The method typically involves mixing MAX powders and fluoride salt with an HCl solution at moderate temperatures over several hours, to obtain a precipitate that produces a clay-like product upon washing. The as-obtained clay-like MXene can then be transformed into a variety of morphologies by a post-forming process. However, fluoride salts react with HCl to produce HF, suggesting that the formation of fluoride ions is essential for the synthesis of MXenes. In the course of the reaction, the metal cations (e.g., Li+, Na+, and K+) are intercalated, which increases the spacing between the MXene layers. Such intercalation of metal cations is not possible when pure HF is used for the synthesis of MXenes. Exfoliation and delamination are generally required to obtain mono-/multi-layered MXene sheets, because delamination is indispensable for the formation of two-dimensional layered sheets. However, synthetic approaches and the accompanying etching and delamination conditions greatly affect the quality, crystallinity, defects, surface functionalization, and thickness of MXene flakes.37,72 Usually, lower concentration of LiF and delamination with sonication give smaller/multi-layered MXene flakes, whereas higher concentration of LiF without sonication gives larger mono-layered MXene flakes (Fig. 3).72 Higher LiF concentration facilitated both etching of aluminum and intercalation of lithium. As a result, multilayer MXene flakes can be delaminated into monolayer flakes without sonication, which usually breaks down larger flakes into smaller pieces. Currently, the most efficient delamination method for the synthesis of MXenes involves sonication with polar intercalating organic molecules such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and isopropyl alcohol.62,73 This process produces a colloidal solution of layered MXene materials, which are converted into free-standing paper-like MXenes upon filtration.60,62,73

3. Energy conversion and storage applications
3.1. Electrocatalysts for water splitting
Electrochemical water splitting is one of the most promising ways for generating a clean energy carrier, hydrogen, in a sustainable and carbon-neutral manner, and is therefore expected to mitigate the problems posed by current hydrogen production technologies such as hydrocarbon reforming and coal gasification. Water electrolysis proceeds through two electrode reactions at the cathode and anode, namely, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which produce hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. Presently, Pt-group metals and Ru- or Ir-based compounds are the most effective and common catalysts for the HER and OER processes, respectively.74 However, the high cost and low availability of noble metals limit their widespread application in economical hydrogen production by water splitting and the large-scale commercialization of this technology. Hence, considerable efforts have been directed towards the development of efficient, earth-abundant, and inexpensive non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts.13–19 However, most of the earth-abundant electrocatalysts show inferior performance to noble metal-based ones, and are unstable in acid or alkaline electrolytes. Therefore, catalytic materials based on earth-abundant elements, with excellent catalytic activity and stability for the HER and OER, continue to be in great demand.
2D non-noble metal-based catalysts such as molybdenum disulfide and carbon nitride have shown high catalytic activity, especially towards the HER; however, the major drawback of these materials is that they are semiconductors with limited charge transfer capabilities.75–78 Additionally, the majority of the catalytically active sites of these 2D materials are confined to the edges, while the in-plane atoms are catalytically inert.33 As a result, 2D MXene materials have attracted huge interest as potential alternative electrocatalysts for water splitting, owing to their charge transfer kinetics and adequate catalytic sites, namely, active non-edge atoms. In fact, theoretical studies have suggested that MXenes could be excellent candidates for water splitting, even though very limited experimental evidence is available.25,26,28,29,33,39,67 Ma et al. first reported the development of a hybrid film with overlapping graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and Ti3C2 nanosheets as an electrode material for the OER, as shown in Fig. 4.29 Ti3C2 MXenes were synthesized by selective acid etching of Al species from the parent Ti3AlC2 MAX phase and then mixed with g-C3N4 by a sonication-assisted exfoliation process to obtain a flexible film with numerous interlayer pores in the nanometer range. The hybrid Ti3C2/C3N4 film showed a significantly improved OER performance in alkaline media compared with Ti3C2 and C3N4, with an onset potential of 1.65 V at 10 mA cm−2, which is comparable to the performance of noble metal-based electrocatalysts. The Tafel slope value of 74.6 mV dec−1 was also lower than the values measured for Ti3C2 and C3N4. The superior OER performance was explained in terms of the interaction between Ti and graphitic carbon nitride, which reduces the electron density of Ti atoms and thus facilitates the adsorption of OH− in alkaline media, leading to a facile electron transfer for O2 evolution.

Ling et al. proposed a strategy to improve the HER performance of vanadium carbide (V2CO2) MXenes by the introduction of transition metals such as Fe, Co, and Ni.39 Their study, based on first-principles calculations, found that pure V2CO2 is not a suitable catalyst for the HER due to the strong bonding between H and the surface O species, which hinders the evolution of H2 gas. Therefore, to weaken the interaction between H and O, TMs such as Fe, Co, and Ni were adsorbed on V2CO2 (Fig. 5). The TMs adsorbed on the V2CO2 surface formed TM–O and TM–V bonds with neighbouring O and V atoms, respectively, and thus weakened the H–O binding strength, improving the HER performance. The introduction of the transition metals not only weakened the H–O bonding, but also significantly increased the stability of V2CO2 and enhanced the electron transfer process. A detailed investigation, based on molecular orbital theory, revealed that the HER performance of these materials depends on the type and amount of transition metals introduced, as the difference in electronegativity between the TMs will lead to a different charge transfer behaviour. For example, as the electronegativity of Fe (1.83) is smaller than that of Co (1.88) and Ni (1.92), Fe induces a larger charge transfer to the O atom compared with Co and Ni. As a result, the H–O bond in Fe–V2CO2 was found to be the weakest among all TM–V2CO2 materials, and the best HER performance was achieved by Fe–V2CO2. The study of Ling et al. could thus open new possibilities for the design of cost-effective 2D MXenes as alternatives to Pt-based catalysts for the HER.39

(a) The combination of the H 1s orbital and O 2pz orbital forms a fully filled bonding orbital and a partially filled anti-bonding orbital, in which the occupancy of the anti-bonding orbital will determine the strength of the H O bond. (b) Charge transfer from H to O will occur when H adsorbs on O; by introducing a TM atom onto the surface, O will gain extra electrons from the TM, leading to a lower charge transfer from H to O and a higher occupancy of the anti-bonding orbital when forming the H O bond.

Afterward, Seh et al. performed a computational screening study, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the active sites of 2D MXene materials.28 One of the significant drawbacks of 2D electrocatalysts is that the majority of the catalytically active sites are confined to the edge or defective atoms, whereas the in-plane atoms are catalytically inert.79,80 Therefore, detailed investigations of the specific active sites of 2D MXene catalysts with excellent charge transfer kinetics are of high importance. DFT calculations allow investigating the electronic structure of nanomaterials and thus predict their intrinsic properties, assist their characterization, and rationalize the experimental results.67 DFT investigations of the catalytically active sites of MXenes could support the design of highly active and efficient electrocatalysts based on these materials. The study by Seh et al. (Fig. 6) involved the computational screening of several potential MXene electrocatalysts to determine the hydrogen adsorption free energy and the expected overpotential of M2XTx materials (M = Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W; X = C and N; and Tx = H, O, OH, and H2O).28 Among all investigated materials, Mo2CTx exhibited the most promising catalytic activity for the HER in acidic media, delivering 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 283 mV. The superior electrocatalytic performance of Mo2CTx compared to other MXenes is due to the presence of catalytically active sites in its basal planes, at variance with the widely studied MoS2 materials, in which only the edge sites are active.81

Recently, using DFT calculations and experimental measurements, Gao et al. demonstrated that the terminal oxygen atoms of 2D MXenes are also catalytically active sites for the HER.33 Their study explored the stability and HER activity of 2D MXenes with oxygen or hydroxyl terminal groups. The HER activity of these systems was evaluated by calculating the Gibbs free energy of adsorption of atomic hydrogen . Theoretically, the Gibbs free energies for hydrogen adsorption on ideal HER catalysts should be around zero.33 As shown in Fig. 7, the HER performances of MXenes with and without oxygen termination were compared using a volcano curve, and it was confirmed that oxygen-terminated MXenes should promote hydrogen desorption. V2CO2 and Ti3C2O2 show negative Gibbs free energies, denoting excessively strong interactions between hydrogen and the oxygen atoms of V2CO2 and Ti3C2O2, which would hinder the desorption of hydrogen from the catalyst surface. On the other hand, in the case of Nb2CO2 and Nb4C3O2, which exhibit positive and high Gibbs free energies, the interaction between hydrogen and oxygen atoms of Nb2CO2 and Nb4C3O2 is too weak for hydrogen to bind to the catalyst. Finally, as Ti2CO2 is located at the peak of the curve, this catalyst is expected to display the best HER performance among the examined MXene materials.

3.2. Electrocatalysts for energy storage: batteries and supercapacitors
The energy obtained from nature, such as that originating from solar and wind sources, needs to be converted and stored in the form of electrochemical energy. Batteries and supercapacitors represent the most widely investigated electrochemical energy storage devices. Enormous research efforts are being devoted to the development of new-generation electrochemical energy storage technologies to meet the increasing demand for both consumer electronics and electric transport systems.35 As the prospects of these storage technologies mainly depend on the development of new electrode materials, there is a major drive to develop cost-effective, highly efficient, and stable energy storage materials.
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) represent the major power source in small portable electronics, electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles, and graphite is the most commonly used anode material for LIBs due to its low cost, high stability, and good electronic conductivity. However, the intercalation mechanism of lithium ions limits the specific capacity of the graphite anode to 372 mA h g−1.34 Furthermore, the large-scale energy storage application of LIBs is greatly hampered by the limited lithium natural deposits, production cost, and safety.82,83 Therefore, the development of non-lithium-ion battery (NLB) systems is urgently needed for the next generation of renewable energy technologies, which include Na-ion, K-ion, Mg-ion, Ca-ion, and Al-ion batteries.56,84–87 The great attention paid to these batteries is due to the feasible use of more abundant elements, high theoretical capacities, suitable negative redox potentials, operational safety, and environmentally benign nature. On the other hand, supercapacitors exhibit high power densities, deliver the stored energy in a short period of time, and can operate for a long time. However, the lack of inexpensive, highly efficient, and stable electrode materials with good electronic conductivity represents a major issue to be overcome in supercapacitor research. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of batteries and supercapacitor electrodes, numerous nanostructures and composites, based on carbon materials, transition metal oxides/hydroxides, and conducting polymers, have been investigated, focusing on three major parameters: surface area, conductivity, and pore structure. However, low specific capacitance, poor electrical conductivity, structural degradation, sluggish redox reactions, and limited ion/electron transport remain major shortcomings of these materials. The major drawbacks of most of the electrode materials include volume expansion, insufficient interlayer space, hydrophobic nature and poor conductivity due to surface oxidation or defects, which limit their application as electrode materials for energy storage and conversion.47,62,88,89 MXenes are unique among the 2D materials in that they exhibit large interlayer spacing, good electrical conductivity, rapid diffusion of ions and molecules, easily tunable structure, hydrophilic nature, excellent thermal stability, controllable morphology and thickness, and high surface area.40,45 MXenes, complex 2D layered materials composed of more than one element, offer great opportunities in terms of variable structural compositions that can be tuned for specific electrochemical applications. Restacking of MXene sheets can also be easily prevented by adding spacers between the MXene flakes due to their large interlayer spacing which improves their electrochemical performance. Furthermore, 2D MXene materials are metal-like conductors with a hydrophilic nature and show quite high elastic properties, and therefore show superior capacity for adsorption and reversible intercalation of many metal cations including Li+ ions at the edges and interlayer spaces of MXenes. Moreover, the exceptional properties of MXenes, including good electrical conductivity, fast ion and molecule diffusion, low operating voltage, and high theoretical storage capacity, make them promising candidates for energy storage and conversion applications.
The possibility of using MXenes as anode materials for LIBs was first explored by Naguib et al., who investigated exfoliated 2D-layered Ti2C formed by etching Al from Ti2AlC.44 The newly formed material exhibited a considerable (∼10-fold) increase in surface area relative to the untreated Ti2AlC, along with a specific capacity of 225 mA h g−1, which was five times higher than that of the Ti2AlC precursor. The increase in specific capacity was attributed to the higher surface area, open structure, and weaker bonds between MX layers in the Ti2C structure. Furthermore, the interlayer spaces between the exfoliated Ti2C sheets can accommodate the Li+ ions. Although the electrochemical performance of the corresponding LIBs was not promising compared with the current state-of-the-art anode materials, the above results opened a new avenue to develop new electrode materials based on MXenes. Subsequently, Tang et al. performed computational (DFT) studies to investigate the capabilities of Ti3C2 MXene and its Ti3C2X2 derivatives (X = F or OH, e.g., Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2(OH)2) as anode materials for LIBs.45 Their work investigated the electronic properties and Li storage capabilities of bare (Ti3C2), fluorinated (Ti3C2F2), and hydroxylated (Ti3C2(OH)2) surfaces. It was found that the electronic properties of Ti3C2 can be modified by the surface functional groups (F or OH) because Ti3C2 has a metallic character, whereas its fluorinated and hydroxylated derivatives in their stable forms are narrow band-gap semiconductors. The Li adsorption and diffusion behaviour of Ti3C2 and its functionalized derivatives were then investigated. By comparing the predicted diffusion barriers and the related path lengths, it was concluded that the migration of Li ions is easier on the Ti3C2 surface due to a lower energy barrier and shorter path length, whereas a higher diffusion barrier was observed for the Ti3C2X2 derivatives due to the steric hindrance of the surface F and OH groups. The bulky OH group prevents a smooth Li migration in the case of Ti3C2 derivatives. Therefore, it was suggested that the Ti3C2 material could be a promising candidate as an anode for LIBs, due to its good electrical conductivity, low diffusion barrier, and high theoretical capacity (320 mA h g−1).
Afterward, Mashtalir et al. reported an increase in the c lattice parameter of surface-functionalized Ti3C2 after intercalation and delamination (Fig. 8), and the intercalated material showed excellent rate capability in Li-ion batteries.62 Most previous studies of LIBs used stacked multilayer MXenes. However, Mashtalir et al.'s work was based on fully exfoliated individual MXene layers of 20–50 nm thickness.44,90 Furthermore, after sonication in DMSO, these MXenes were dispersed in deionized (DI) water to form an aqueous colloidal solution, which was then filtered to produce MXene “paper”. The as-obtained binder-free MXene paper showed specific capacities of 410 mA h g−1 at 1C cycling rate and 110 mA h g−1 at rates as high as 36C. Even though the MXene sample contained OH and F functionalities on its surface, the measured specific capacity was much higher than the theoretical capacity of Ti3C2 MXene (320 mA h g−1) predicted earlier.45 One possible explanation for the high specific capacity of the exfoliated MXene could involve the formation of a reversible solid electrolyte interface (SEI) that stores the additional capacity, as observed for metal oxides.91 However, additional work is necessary to understand the lithiation and delithiation mechanisms of MXenes, in order to further optimize their electrochemical performance.

The intercalation of ions into layered compounds has been exploited for a long time in energy storage devices such as batteries, in which intercalated lithium is used to store and transport charge because it offers the best energy density. However, it is difficult to store larger cations without disrupting the crystal structure of the material. For this reason, Lukatskaya et al. developed MX compounds, based on the 2D layered structure of Ti3C2, capable of electrochemically accommodating a wide range of cations (Na+, K+, NH4+, Mg2+, and Al3+) from aqueous salt solutions (Fig. 9).42 While it is well known that materials with large specific surface areas are needed to achieve high capacitances in electrochemical double-layer capacitors, the surface area of multilayer exfoliated MXenes is very low (∼23 m2 g−1).44 Therefore, cation intercalation and the corresponding increase in interplanar spacing could be beneficial to obtaining higher capacitances. In fact, Mashtalir et al. demonstrated that an MXene binder- and additive-free paper electrode produced by filtering delaminated Ti3C2Tx exhibited a capacitance of 340 F cm−3 in KOH.62 This excellent performance can be attributed to the surface area (98 m2 g−1, much higher than that of Ti2C reported by Naguib et al.), hydrophilic nature, and good conductivity of the synthesized material.44 Furthermore, the flexibility of the as-prepared MXene paper could open a new avenue for the use of MXenes in flexible and wearable energy storage devices. Finally, the possibility to accommodate a variety of ions between the MXene layers may also enable the application of these exciting materials in battery–supercapacitor hybrid systems.

The promising electrochemical performance shown by titanium carbide-based MXenes prompted further explorations of other similar 2D materials. Naguib et al. developed niobium and vanadium carbides by selectively etching Al from Nb2AlC and V2AlC; these compounds exhibited promising performances as LIB electrode materials, with reversible capacities of 170 and 260 mA h g−1 at 1C for Nb2CTx and V2CTx, respectively.92 The new carbides exhibited a layered morphology similar to that of exfoliated graphite (Fig. 10), formed by replacing the strong metallic bonds between the M and A layers by weaker hydrogen bonds. In addition, both electrode materials showed excellent ability to withstand high cycling rates (10C), which implies a fast Li diffusion within the layered structure of the material. However, it is important to note that MXenes also suffer from the formation of the solid electrolyte interface, and therefore their capacity decreases considerably after the first cycle, as in the case of Ti3C2.62

The successful delamination of MXenes to produce single-layer nanosheets with a thickness of a few nanometers motivated further research to develop flexible MXenes and their corresponding nanocomposite films for energy storage devices.42,62,90,92 Ling et al. reported the synthesis of flexible and highly conductive nanocomposite films by mixing MXene and polymers, as shown in Fig. 11.48 Adding a polymer as a binder or spacer between thin MXene layers resulted in composite films with good flexibility, tensile strength, and electrical conductivity. Ti3AlC2 was selected as the MAX precursor due to its previously reported successful delamination.25,42,53,62 The main polymers used for the intercalation between the MXene layers were polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), due to its cationic nature, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), because of its high solubility in water and the presence of OH groups in its backbone. When used as an electrode material for supercapacitors, volumetric capacitances of 528, 296, and 300 F cm−3 were obtained for MXene/PVA, MXene/PDDA, and bare MXene, respectively, at 2 mV s−1 in KOH. No changes in capacitance were observed upon addition of the PDDA polymer in the Ti3C2Tx MXene films; this finding was ascribed to the lower density of the composite compared with MXene. On the other hand, a significant increase in capacitance was observed when PVA was added to the MXene film. The better performance observed in this case was attributed to the improved ionic transport and access to MXene, as well as the prevention of the restacking of MXene flakes by the PVA polymer. Although the composite films and the Ti3C2Tx sample displayed almost identical electrical conductivities, other factors could determine their different electrochemical performances, such as prevention of layer restacking, ionic access and transport, degree of cationic interaction, and flexibility of the composite film.

Carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes display a volumetric capacitance of around 300 F cm−3, much lower than that of ruthenium oxide-based electrode materials.93–95 The promising performance of MXene as a supercapacitor electrode material, with a capacitance of over 300 F cm−3, triggered new studies aimed at further improving the capacitance of MXene-based materials.25,42 Ghidiu et al. developed a new method to synthesize clay-like MXene materials (Ti3C2Tx), using a solution of lithium fluoride and hydrochloric acid instead of the hazardous hydrofluoric acid.31 These MXenes could also be shaped into thin sheets for supercapacitor applications by rolling, as shown in Fig. 12. The resulting additive-free Ti3C2Tx films showed a volumetric capacitance of 900 F cm−3 (or 245 F g−2) when used as supercapacitor electrodes in an acidic electrolyte. The capacitance, stability, and rate capability of this material were considerably higher than those of previously reported MXenes.25,42

Among various energy storage devices, lithium-ion capacitors might bridge the gap between batteries and supercapacitors.96–99 However, due to the limited availability of lithium and the ever-increasing use of energy storage devices, new investigations have focused on sodium-ion batteries, where lithium is replaced by the cheaper and more abundant sodium, as an alternative to LIBs. Even though Na-ion batteries involve the intercalation of Na ions, their energy and power densities are severely limited, due to the excessive volume change induced by the larger Na ions. Therefore, new electrode materials are needed for advanced sodium-ion batteries. Remarkably, MXene materials have high electrical conductivity and a large surface area, and are capable of accommodating a wide range of cations including Na+.42 For this reason, Wang et al. reported the possible use of Ti2CTx MXene as a negative electrode material for Na-ion hybrid capacitors.97 As shown in Fig. 13, multi-layered Ti2CTx MXene was synthesized from the Ti2AlC MAX phase by etching Al with HF, which resulted in an increase in the interlayer distance due to the successful removal of Al. Afterward, the Na ions were electrochemically intercalated/adsorbed into/onto the MXene sheets, resulting in the expansion of the Ti2CTx interlayer distance from 7.1 to 10.1 Å (Fig. 13). It had previously been reported that Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx MXenes suffer from a large shrinkage or expansion of the interlayer distance during the cycling process in a Li+ electrolyte. However, in the study of Wang et al., the activated Ti2CTx enabled the intercalation/deintercalation as well as adsorption/desorption of Na+ onto the surface of MXene sheets without significant changes in the interlayer distance.44,77,96,97 Although the performance of this material is much lower than that of the MXene clay reported by Ghidiu et al., it certainly demonstrated an innovative approach to the fabrication of electrodes for high-performance Na-ion hybrid capacitors.31

MXenes belong to a large family of more than 70 members; however, only very few have been successfully synthesized, and only Ti2C, Ti3C2, Nb2C, and V2C have attracted considerable interest for electrochemical applications, due to the possibility of intercalating various cations between their layers.31,44,48,92,96 Dall'Agnese et al. found that the electrochemical behavior of V2C MXene as a lithium-ion capacitor is quite similar to that of Ti2C.96,97 Although more emphasis was laid on the development of the negative electrode, Dall'Agnese et al. presented that the representative of the large family of MXenes, V2CTx, could be used as a cathode material for sodium ion capacitors.96 In this study, an asymmetric full cell was assembled using hard carbon as an anode material, and the cell achieved a capacity of 50 mA h g−1 with a maximum cell voltage of 3.5 V. The results demonstrated that this MXene material stores energy through intercalation of Na-ions between the V2CTx layers as with Li-ions,90 suggesting that V2CTx could be used as an attractive cathode material with a wide operating potential window. The development of NLBs was mainly stalled due to the inadequate choice of electrode materials. However, based on theoretical experiments and predictions, Xie et al. suggested that MXene is a promising electrode for NLBs.100 Systematic investigation supported by first principles simulations suggested that Na, K, Mg, Ca, and Al can be stored on MXene nanosheets. Recently, Zhou et al. synthesized a flexible and conductive Hf3C2Tz MXene by selective etching of the Si alloyed Al–C sublayer from the Hf3[Al(Si)]4C6 compound.56 The resultant 2D Hf-containing MXene material displayed reversible volumetric capacities of 1567 and 504 mA h cm−3 for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries, respectively, at a current density of 200 mA g−1, proving to be a good material for larger sized metal-ion intercalation. However, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of this material has not been fully understood and research interest is still on whether the electrode exhibits ion intercalation between the MXene nanosheets or ion adsorption on the MXene surface.
Besides LIBs and NLBs, lithium sulphur batteries (LSBs) have been regarded as one of the most promising technologies for next-generation energy storage systems due to the high theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g−1), natural abundance, and high specific energy density (2600 W h kg−1) of sulphur.101–103 However, loss of sulphur, poor cycling life, and dissolution in the electrolyte are the major obstacles of this technology, which deteriorate the overall performance of LSBs. To overcome these obstacles, tremendous efforts have been devoted to finding suitable materials to host sulphur. The discovery of MXenes has prompted researchers to consider them as a new class of sulphur host materials that can capitalize on a combination of inherently high conductivity and highly active 2D surfaces to host intermediate polysulfides by metal–sulphur interactions.104–107 For example, Zhao et al. studied the usage of titanium carbide-based MXenes (Ti2CO2) as the anchoring material of Li2Sn species in Li–S batteries by means of DFT computations. The study revealed that MXene monolayers provide a strong binding with soluble Li2Sn species, thus avoiding the dissolution of these species into the electrolyte, suggesting that MXenes can be a promising anchoring material for Li–S batteries.107 Similarly, Rao et al. by DFT calculations showed that Ti-based MXene (Ti2C) can significantly improve the performance of LSBs.104 The investigation revealed that the interaction of lithium sulfides (Li2Sm) on the surface of functionalized MXenes makes the Ti–S bonds stronger, which helps the electrode materials to prevent the dissolution of sulphur. Furthermore, Nazar and co-workers reported that due to the strong interaction of the polysulfide species with the surface Ti-based carbide and due to their inherently high metallic conductivity and self-functionalized surfaces, MXenes perform as excellent sulphur battery hosts.105 The 70 wt% S/Ti2C composites exhibited stable long-term cycling performance with over 80% capacity retention after 400 cycles at 2C with a specific capacity of around 1200 mA h g−1 at 5C.
On the other hand, the high surface area, number of pores, and porosity of the electrode materials typically led to enhanced electrochemical activity, due to the improved accessibility of the electrolyte ions/molecules to the electrode.108,109 In this context, Ren et al. developed a novel chemical etching strategy to produce porous Ti3C2Tx at room temperature.43 The process involved the catalytic oxidation of MXene flakes using a transition metal salt (CuSO4, CoSO4, or FeSO4), followed by the removal of the metal oxide (TiO2), which is produced as a result of the oxygen-rich environment during the oxidation process (Fig. 14). Notably, numerous pores with sizes of tens of nanometers were observed and the pore volume showed a 10-fold increase, whereas the specific surface area was increased from 19.6 to 93.6 m2 g−1, indicating the formation of porous MXene. When tested in a LIB electrode, the porous Ti3C2Tx films exhibited improved Li-ion storage capabilities compared with non-porous MXene films. A high capacity of up to 1250 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and better capacity retention at high current densities were obtained. Furthermore, no significant effect of acid etching on the surface termination (F, O, and OH) groups was observed during the removal of the metal oxide, suggesting that the method can be applied to other MXenes to produce the corresponding porous structures.

After identifying MXenes as promising electrode materials for energy storage, due to their excellent chemical and physical properties, additional studies focused on further improving the performance of these materials by surface modification and by increasing the number of active sites and the interlayer spacing. The significant improvements made in the electrochemical performance were attributed to the formation of large interlayer voids in the MXene structure and the removal of specific surface groups. Previous theoretical studies showed that the storage capacities of MXenes are strongly dependent on the surface terminal groups. For example, –F and –OH groups hamper the transport of electrolyte ions and thus reduce the energy storage capacity.45,110 Boota et al. showed that an increase in the interlayer spacing of MXene materials is beneficial for the charge transport, and lower amounts of terminal groups on the surface enable a higher number of Ti atoms (of MXenes) to participate in redox reactions.111
Li et al. developed a method for improving the capacitance of Ti3C2Tx MXenes by cation intercalation and surface modification, which, as anticipated, resulted in a significant enhancement in the gravimetric capacitance (up to 200%).49 After removal of Al from Ti3AlC2, the resulting MXene (Ti3C2Tx) material, surface-terminated by –OH and –F groups, was treated with bases of different cationic radii (e.g., KOH). As a result, the Ti–F bonds became unstable and the –F terminal groups were replaced by hydroxyl groups, simultaneously intercalating K+ ions between the MXene layers. After removal of specific terminal groups (–OH and –F), the electrochemical performance of the KOH-treated MXene as a supercapacitor showed a considerable improvement. The specific capacitance value of 517 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 of the KOH-treated Ti3C2 was attributed to the lower F concentration on the MXene layer surface and to the larger interlayer distance due to the intercalation of K+ ions. These results confirm that the combination of cation intercalation and surface group modification could be an effective strategy for enhancing the capacitance of MXene-based electrode materials.
Due to the importance of the incorporation of interlayer cations and the increase in the interlayer spacing for improving the electrochemical performance, further efforts were focused on introducing various larger ions between the MXene layers, which drastically changes the internal structure of the host.112–117 For example, Ghidiu et al. confirmed the possibility of intercalating large polyatomic cations such as alkylammonium (AA) into MXene materials.40 The introduction of large cations into the interlayer space can thus lead to better electrolyte access in energy storage devices. As a result, theoretical as well as experimental studies were carried out to identify the ideal conditions for the intercalation of various large cations, by thoroughly characterizing the structural effects of the intercalation. First, Ti3AlC2 was etched with a HF–LiCl mixture to obtain Li–Ti3C2Tx, which was then ion-exchanged with trimethylalkylammonium chlorides or bromides with different alkyl chains to form the intercalated Ti3C2Tx. The intercalation and expansion of the interlayer spacing of the MXene materials was found to depend on the selected alkyl chains, which are arranged vertically between the layers. However, when used as electrochemical capacitor electrodes, the presence of large pillared interlayer AA cations did not affect the charge storage capacity. In fact, the capacitance initially increased for smaller AA chains, due to the presence of sufficient interlayer space for electrolyte access. However, the capacitance significantly decreased in the case of longer AA chains, due to higher resistivity limiting the charge transfer and to the larger C–C chains hindering the diffusion of the electrolyte. Furthermore, because cations are electrochemically inert, the presence of larger cations would create a “dead volume” in the electrode, thus reducing the specific capacitance. Therefore, it is clear that excessive interlayer spacing between the MXene layers is not favourable for the performance of energy storage devices, even though a larger interlayer spacing could be useful for other applications.
4. Conclusion and outlook
Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of advanced electrode materials, in the pursuit of high-performance electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. During the past decade, numerous studies focused on graphene have generated great interest in the exploration of 2D materials. As a result, the discovery of a similar material, MXene, exfoliated from layered MAX phases, has attracted considerable interest in recent years. Owing to their outstanding properties, including hardness, high melting point, excellent oxidation resistance, high electrical and thermal conductivity, hydrophilic nature, compositional variability, high surface area, and ability to host a broad range of intercalants, MXene materials have been developed as electrode materials and are now considered as valid alternatives to graphene. In this review article, we have illustrated recent progress in the development of 2-D MXene materials for future energy conversion and energy storage applications. Three main applications, namely, water splitting, batteries, and supercapacitors, have been systematically analyzed and discussed. Here, we present a comprehensive overview in Table 1, which summarizes all the synthetic approaches, material compositions, and applications of MXenes as active materials for energy conversion and storage applications reported in recent years.

In general, the majority of MXene materials can be synthesized by selectively etching Al from the MAX phase using HF, followed by sonication to separate the stacked MXene layers into individual layers. Apart from HF, other less toxic etchant mixtures, such as LiF–HCl, have also been successfully used to extract the A elements. Both synthetic processes yield multilayered MXenes (i.e., early transition metal carbides and nitrides) with different morphologies and surface-terminated with functional groups such as hydroxyl, oxygen, and fluorine, which lead to hydrophilic surfaces. However, more work is needed to develop fluoride-free synthetic approaches for MXenes, which may offer new opportunities to further exploit the unique properties of these materials.
Even though MXenes possess the outstanding properties required for an electrode material used in electrochemical water splitting, most recent studies consist of theoretical investigations, with limited experimental support.25,26,28,29,33,39,67 Compared with other 2D electrode materials, the investigations of MXene materials are still at an early stage. Therefore, the prospects of highly efficient MXene-based electrode materials, particularly towards the OER and HER processes, are largely unknown. On the other hand, various cations intercalated into the MXene surface allowed the careful control and expansion of the interlayer spacing, thus permitting their use in energy storage applications such as LIBs, sodium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and hybrid capacitors. Furthermore, the effects of functional groups, electrical conductivity, and creation of porous structures have also been explored for many MXene materials.
Superior capacitance performances have been achieved in neutral, aqueous, and sulphuric acid electrolytes, suggesting that MXenes could represent a very attractive option as supercapacitor electrodes. In addition, high capacity and stability during the charge/discharge processes of lithium-ion batteries have been achieved using these materials. Apart from lithium, sodium and other larger ions were intercalated into the MXene interlayers, showing the promising potential of MXenes also for battery–capacitor hybrid devices. However, despite these favorable properties, some drawbacks still need to be addressed to enable the practical application of MXenes. One of the major challenges is to develop synthetic routes to fabricate MXenes with specific functional groups, because the present synthetic approaches result in arbitrarily functionalized MXenes, with more than one kind of functional group. Moreover, since most MXene syntheses involve the use of toxic HF, the fabrication of MXenes by fluoride-free strategies is another key challenge. As MXene samples without surface functional groups have never been synthesized to date, it will be interesting to assess the performance of non-functionalized MXenes as electrode materials. Furthermore, the volume expansion and increase in interlayer spacing upon intercalation with larger cations still needs to be fully understood, because the presence of larger interlayer cations results in high resistivity and thus hinders charge transfer and prevents easy diffusion of the electrolyte. It is clear that excessive spacing between the MXene layers is an unfavorable feature for energy storage devices. On the other hand, in addition to the DMSO-intercalated and HF-etched MXenes, other possible polymer composites remain unexplored. Systematic investigations of the interfacial interactions of various MXene materials with other polymeric composites and the characterization of the electrochemical properties of these systems can provide valuable insights and thus contribute to the development of future electrochemical applications of MXenes. Furthermore, the incorporation of conductive interlayer spacers can provide additional electron-conductive pathways by maintaining adequate interlayer separations, which could promote easy access and transport of electrolyte ions, thus enhancing the electrochemical performances of the MXene materials. The fabrication of hierarchical MXene nanostructures with highly exposed active metal components is another possible interesting development, and represents a new challenge to be tackled in future studies.
These novel and exciting 2D materials undoubtedly show great potential as future electrode materials for energy applications, motivating further explorations. MXene-based composites could open a new avenue towards new energy storage applications, due to the synergistic effect of prevention of agglomeration, improved electronic conductivity and electrochemical stability, good contact with the electrolyte, and easy ion/electron transfer in these materials. Further development of 2D MXenes as electrocatalysts for water splitting and electrode materials in Li-ion batteries or supercapacitors requires additional theoretical studies for understanding the mechanisms of the underlying electrochemical processes and for optimizing the corresponding performances. We believe that the present review of recent advances in the preparation and application of MXene materials would serve as a useful platform to support further developments of these systems for future energy applications.

 	Fig. 5  Schematic model showing the HER performance upon introduction of a transition metal onto the V2CO2 surface. (a) The combination of the H 1s orbital and O 2pz orbital forms a fully filled bonding orbital and a partially filled anti-bonding orbital, in which the occupancy of the anti-bonding orbital will determine the strength of the H O bond. (b) Charge transfer from H to O will occur when H adsorbs on O; by introducing a TM atom onto the surface, O will gain extra electrons from the TM, leading to a lower charge transfer from H to O and a higher occupancy of the anti-bonding orbital when forming the H O bond.
