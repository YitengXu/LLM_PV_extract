    , Accepted 26th August 2016First published on 26th August 2016AbstractThis article demonstrates comprehensive studies on different visible-light driven photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic aspects of a hydrothermally synthesized n-type H2Ti3O7 (HTO) nanowire mesh and its carbon and nitrogen functionalized counterparts, namely C-HTO and N-HTO. It was found that the presence of various defect states within the band gap of HTO, C-HTO and N-HTO nanowires, make them photoactive under visible-light. The photo-conversion efficiencies of HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO nanowire electrodes are about 0.066, 0.129, and 0.076%, respectively, at around 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Carbon functionalization of HTO nanowires has been found to be most beneficial in increasing the charge carrier density, resulting in the highest current density, high photo conversion efficiency, remarkable photoelectrochemical water splitting performance and enhanced photocatalytic activity. The photocurrent density of the C-HTO NWs was found to be 0.0562 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is almost two times that of the pristine HTO NWs (0.029 mA cm−2). Although nitrogen functionalization increases the charge carrier density of the HTO nanowires, nitrogen incorporation produces lots of recombination centres in the nanowires, which are found to play a detrimental role in the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic performance of N-HTO nanowires, limiting the expected performance. Therefore, the present study demonstrates a suitable surface engineering technique for nanostructures to maximize the utilization of green solar light.
Introduction
In the modern era, standing on the verge of the depletion of fossil fuels, the fabrication of novel nanomaterials which can harvest solar energy through chemical reactions, like hydrogen-fuel generation through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, CO2 fixation, and degradation of organic pollutants, has been one of the most challenging tasks in utilizing the unlimited solar energy reaching the earth crust in a green and economical way.1,2 Different titanium dioxide-based semiconductor nanostructures and thin films have been widely studied as photoactive materials for PEC water splitting,2,3 photocatalysis,4,5 dye-sensitized solar cells,6,7 sensors,8 and battery electrodes9 because of its abundance, environmental compatibility, high photo-stability, and high efficiency.10,11 Still, the application of pure titanium dioxide in the visible-light region is limited because of its wide band gap; titanium dioxide can only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light, a small percentage (∼4%) of the total solar spectrum reaching earth. Therefore, different strategies have been adopted to improve the performance of the visible-light driven photoelectrochemical properties of titanium dioxide. The most common approaches are metal doping, which can reduce the band gap energy helping in the adsorption of visible-light,12,13 surface modification,14,15 and the fabrication of core–shell type nano-heterostructures.16,17 Along with metal ion doping, the incorporation of various non-metal elements like C, N, and B has also been demonstrated to improve the visible-light PEC properties of titanium dioxide.18–21 Recently, apart from TiO2 nanostructures, other titanium oxide-based nanostructures have drawn intense attention for their visible-light PEC properties.22–24 Among them, H2Ti3O7 (HTO) seems to be promising for its interesting electronic and energy properties.25–27 Nanostructured HTO has also drawn researchers' keen attention as a potential photocatalyst for its large-scale and economical productivity, and the coexistence of interlayer spaces with nanochannels, etc.28 There are some reports on the photocatalytic activities of pristine HTO nanowires28,29 and HTO based nano-heterostructures.30 However, the PEC properties of H2Ti3O7 are yet to be demonstrated in detail. Here, we have studied the PEC properties of H2Ti3O7 NWs as well as the effect of surface functionalization (C and N incorporation on the NW surfaces) on the PEC properties, like photo-switching and water splitting, for the first time. In addition, we have also performed a concise investigation into how the C and N surface functionalization of the H2Ti3O7 NWs influences their photocatalytic activity. The unique morphology of H2Ti3O7 in the form of one-dimensional (1D) NWs having a high aspect ratio and large surface area is ideal to ameliorate the PEC activity of the material compared to any other form of nanostructure. Furthermore, the incorporation/doping of carbon and nitrogen on the surface of the NWs most expectedly would introduce defects like various oxygen vacancies during the synthesis, which would boost the visible-light PEC properties of the pristine HTO NWs.
Here, meshes of HTO and C and N surface functionalized HTO NWs have been fabricated on Ti foil through a hydrothermal route. All of the NWs have been found to be enriched with a large concentration of surface defects, which is because of the large surface areas of the materials. The studies indicate that N-functionalization of the HTO NW (N-HTO) surface cannot effectively improve the PEC performance of the NWs, which is most probably because of fast recombination of photo-generated electrons. Interestingly, C-functionalized HTO (C-HTO) NWs have been found to exhibit enhanced visible-light PEC properties with superior water splitting and photocatalytic activity because of large photo-generation and moderate recombination of electrons.
Experimental methods
Materials and chemicals
Titanium foil (Ti, 99.99% pure and 0.25 mm thick, Alfa Aesar), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Merck), dextrose (C6H12O6, LobaChemie), ammonia solution (NH3, 28–30%, Merck) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%, Merck). All of the chemicals used throughout the experiments are of reagent grade and were used without further purification.
Synthesis of H2Ti3O7 (HTO) NWs
Here, the HTO NWs were grown on Ti foil through a hydrothermal synthesis.25 Firstly, a thoroughly cleaned, high purity Ti foil was annealed in air for 5 hours at 800 °C. Afterwards, the yellowish white coloured, annealed Ti foil was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave, which was filled with 35 ml of aqueous 10 M NaOH solution and autoclaved at 200 °C for 8 hours. After normal cooling, the Ti foil was taken out and washed thoroughly with DI water. After that, it was transferred into a hot mixture of 25 ml DI water and 10 ml HCl and was kept for 20 minutes under constant careful stirring. Finally, HTO NWs were obtained by thoroughly washing the foil in DI water until the pH of the sample containing water became 6.5. The reactions involved in the synthesis are given below.  Na2Ti3O7 + 2HCl → H2Ti3O7 + 2NaCl
Synthesis of C-HTO and N-HTO NWs
C-HTO NWs were prepared by dipping the as prepared sample of HTO NWs into an aqueous solution of 1 M dextrose for 24 hours and then annealing at 450 °C for 2 hours under a flow of Ar gas. During the annealing treatment, dextrose decomposed and carbon was incorporated on the surface of the HTO NWs. Similarly, the as prepared sample of HTO NWs was dipped into an NH3 solution for 24 hours and was annealed in an Ar atmosphere for 2 hours at 450 °C to fabricate N-HTO NWs.
Material characterization
The morphology of the as prepared samples was characterized using field emission electron microscopes (FESEM, JEOL JSM 7600-F and FEI Quanta-200 Mark-2). The crystal structure and morphology of the samples were investigated using high resolution transmission electron microscopes (HRTEM, JEOL JEM 2100 and FEI TECNAI G2 TF20ST). The crystallographic information of the samples was obtained using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD, Panalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer) using a Cu Kα line (λ = 1.54 Å) and with a step size of 0.15°. To probe the elemental composition of the samples, energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) was employed by keeping the NW samples on holey carbon copper grids. Moreover, the chemical composition of the samples was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Microtech VGX 900-W, Mg Kα, resolution 0.9 eV and vacuum level 2.2 × 10−10 mbar). The samples were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, JASCO-6300), in the range of 400–4000 cm−1, to acquire information regarding the chemical bonds. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda 1050 UV/Vis spectrometer) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL, Horiba, FluoroLog-3) were also employed to explore the band edges and different defect transition related information of the samples.
Photo-electrochemical studies
The visible-light driven photo-electrochemical behaviours of the NW samples were studied in a three-electrode software controlled potentiostat (CHI660E, CH Instruments), using the samples as the working electrodes, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. A 0.5 M aqueous solution of Na2SO4 was used as the electrolyte and a 200 W incandescent lamp (Philips) (λ > 420 nm, intensity 10 mW cm−2) was used as the light source.
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for the samples was executed under intermittent light illumination, in the range of 2 to 0 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The photo-switching activity of each of the samples was studied at zero bias voltage vs. Ag/AgCl with 20 s intervals between light ‘on’ and ‘off’. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for all of the samples was performed with 0 V initial voltage vs. Ag/AgCl with an amplitude of 0.005 V in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. To obtain the Mott–Schottky plot, AC impedance vs. potential was executed in the voltage range of −2 to 2 V at a frequency of 1 kHz.
Photocatalysis study
The photocatalytic activity of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs was examined through a systematic study of the degradation of an aqueous solution of rhodamine B (RhB, Merck) dye in the presence of the sample under the same visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) at 5 °C, to avoid the chance of water evaporation.
Results and discussion
Structure and morphology

Fig. 1(a) shows the FESEM micrograph of the as prepared HTO NW mesh, grown on metallic Ti foil. Fig. 1(b) and (c) are the FESEM images of the C-HTO and N-HTO NWs, respectively. The diameters of the NWs have been found to vary between 15–20 nm. It is also evident that the NWs are uniformly distributed on the surface and there is no change in the morphology of the HTO NWs after surface functionalization. The GIXRD patterns of the NWs are shown in Fig. 1(d), which indicates the polycrystalline nature (JCPDS File # 47-0561) of the materials with two preferential orientations along the (40) and (60) crystallographic planes. Interestingly, the intensity of the (400) peak, present in the HTO NWs reduces considerably after surface functionalization. The distinct peaks at 42.72° and 42.87° in the N-HTO and C-HTO NWs may be assigned to the (200) crystallographic planes of TiN (JCPDS File # 87-0633) and TiC (JCPDS File # 89-3828), respectively.

The HRTEM micrographs of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs are shown in Fig. 2(a), (b), and (c), respectively, which indicate that the average diameter of the NWs is 15–20 nm. The EFTEM micrographs of the NWs as shown in Fig. 2(d), (e), (f), and (g) indicate the presence of Ti, O, C (obtained from the C-HTO NWs) and N (obtained from the N-HTO NWs), respectively, in the NWs. The red circled area in Fig. 2(f), which encircles a hole in the holey carbon copper grid containing a suspended part of a C-HTO NW, indicates the presence of C in the C-HTO NWs. Fig. 2(g) shows that the nitrogen incorporation has only taken place on the surfaces of the N-HTO NWs.

XPS analysis
The high resolution curve fitted XPS spectra of the Ti 2p states of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs are shown in Fig. 3(a), (b) and (c), respectively. The Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks positioned at 458.51 and 464.30 eV, respectively, in HTO correspond to the +4 oxidation state of titanium (Ti4+ state).31 While for C-HTO and N-HTO, the Ti4+ state related Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks are respectively located at 458.47 and 464.30 eV, and 458.13 and 463.80 eV. Moreover, in HTO, the peaks present at 454.94 and 459.84 eV, can respectively be assigned to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 states corresponding to the +3 oxidation state of titanium (Ti3+),32 which generally indicates the presence of oxygen vacancy related defects in the NWs. For C-HTO and N-HTO, the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 doublets, corresponding to the +3 oxidation state of titanium are positioned at 455.94 and 460.08 eV, and 454.90 and 459.78 eV, respectively. The shifts in the peak positions of the surface engineered NWs might be because of the surface modification owing to the incorporation of C and N as well as different defect states.

Fig. 3(d), (e), and (f) represent the XPS spectra of O 1s for the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs, respectively. Each O 1s peak can be deconvoluted into two main peaks. The peak at 529.8 eV for HTO (529.9 eV for C-HTO and 529.0 eV for N-HTO) can be assigned to the −2 oxidation state of oxygen, related to Ti–O.33,34 The higher binding energy shoulder peak, located at 531.75 eV for HTO (531.26 eV for C-HTO and 531.0 eV for N-HTO) can be attributed to the Ti–OH bond.33 It is also attributed to the presence of OH− species, due to moisture adsorption at the surfaces of the material and the oxygen vacancies.35

The deconvoluted XPS spectrum of C 1s for the C-HTO NWs is presented in Fig. 3(g). The peak at around 284.8 eV is the signature of adventitious carbon and sp3-hybridized carbon (C–C), as a result of carbon functionalization.36,37 The peak positioned at 283.61 eV may be ascribed to the C–Ti bond38 and sp2-hybridized carbon (CC).39 The peaks positioned at 286.34, 287.3, and 288.3 eV are assigned to the C–O–C, CO, and O–CO bonds, respectively.36,37,40 The peak arising at 290.83 eV is generally attributed to the π–π* satellite in C.37,41 The multi-Gaussian fitting of the N 1s XPS spectrum of the N-HTO NWs is depicted in Fig. 3(h). There are five peaks positioned at 397.6 eV, 398.85 eV, 400.05 eV, 401.3 eV, and 402.15 eV. The peak at 397.6 eV has been assigned to the binding energy of N 1s electrons in Ti–N by most researchers.42–44 The peak ca. 399 eV may be assigned to molecular or chemisorbed nitrogen.44 The peak at around 400 eV is typically associated with interstitial nitrogen dopants.45 The peak circa 401.3 eV has been assigned to the binding energy of N 1s electrons in the O–Ti–N environment.43 Because of the presence of O atoms in the O–Ti–O structure, when an N atom replaces one O atom to form O–Ti–N, the local electron density around the N atom is reduced compared to that in Ti–N; this in turn increases the binding energy. The 402.15 eV peak may be assigned to the N–N bonds.46
FTIR analysis

Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectra of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs. The absorption peak in the range of 3470–3240 cm−1 appears due to the stretching vibration of the O–H bond,47 which indicates the presence of –OH groups in the NW samples as expected. The shift in the O–H bond position in the C-HTO and N-HTO NWs with respect to that of the HTO NWs is most likely due to the incorporation/doping of C and N in the HTO NWs. The absorption peaks at around 1630 cm−1 occur due the bending vibration of H–O–H,48 which is most probably because of the structural H–O–H bonds in the NWs or physical adsorption of moisture at the sample surfaces. However, most importantly the absorption peak at 494.65 cm−1 for the HTO NWs represents the O–Ti–O vibration mode.32 The O–Ti–O bending vibration mode positioned at 531.29 cm−1 for the C-HTO NWs and at 525.51 cm−1 for the N-HTO NWs, clearly indicates a blue shift with peak broadening. This is because of the formation of the O–Ti–C bond in the C-HTO NWs and the O–Ti–N bond in the N-HTO NWs. As Oxygen has a higher atomic weight than both carbon and nitrogen, the replacement of oxygen with carbon and nitrogen decreases the reduced mass of the bond, which in turn increases the wave number (see ESI†). It should also be noted that the O–Ti–N vibration mode wave number is lower than that of the O–Ti–C vibration mode; because nitrogen is heavier than carbon. The broadening of the O–Ti–O peak can be attributed to the strain generated due to the formation of the O–Ti–C and O–Ti–N bonds. Again, the vibration mode around 922.53 cm−1 for the HTO NWs is related to the stretching vibration mode of Ti–O32 and this vibration mode is also shifted to higher wave number for the C-HTO and N-HTO NWs.

Absorption and emission spectra analysis

Fig. 5 shows the optical absorption profile of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs. Unlike the C-HTO and N-HTO NWs, the HTO NWs do not show any distinct absorption band edge and possess a long tail in the visible-light range, which arises mainly because of the presence of plenty of visible-light active mid band gap defect states. It is clear from Fig. 5 that, though the HTO NWs have slightly greater absorption than the C-HTO and N-HTO NWs in the visible range, the C-HTO and N-HTO NWs both have considerably greater absorbance in the near UV and blue light regions, compared to the HTO NWs. It is also seen, that in N-HTO the absorption edge is slightly blue shifted compared to the C-HTO NWs. The band gap energies estimated from Tauc's plot for the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO are ∼2.96, 3.06, and 3.26 eV, respectively. Most importantly, the samples are found to exhibit quasi-direct band gap character, like other titanium oxides,49–51 as n = 2 gives an acceptable and positive band gap for each sample in the well-known Tauc's equation: (αhν)n = A(hν − Eg).
 Fig. 5  The room temperature UV-Vis absorption spectra of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs with their corresponding Tauc's plots in the inset. 
In order to visualize the defect profiles of the samples, a room temperature photoluminescence (PL) study was performed under identical experimental parameters. Fig. 6(a) shows the room temperature PL emission spectra of the samples. Albeit the PL line shapes are almost similar for all three samples, the main difference lies in the intensity profile with the N-HTO NWs having the maximum PL intensity, followed by the C-HTO and HTO NWs. Fig. 6(b), (c), and (d) represent the curve fitted and deconvoluted PL spectra of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs, respectively (the particulars of the deconvoluted PL peaks have been summarized in Table 1). In each PL spectrum, a reasonably distinct peak (peak 1) occurs around 415.64 nm (2.983 eV) for HTO, 414.08 nm (2.994 eV) for C-HTO, and 412.92 nm (3.002 eV) for N-HTO and could be treated as the signature of near band edge (NBE) emission, and this finding again suggests that the materials under consideration appear as direct band gap materials.49–51 The peak 2, positioned at around 440 nm (2.82 eV) has generally been attributed to different surface defect states.52,53 The peak 3, centred around 470 nm (2.64 eV) is attributed to the Ti3+ state related shallow trap centres.32,54,55 The peak 4, located ca. 500 nm (2.48 eV) can be attributed to the deep level trap states evolved from oxygen vacancies associated with F+ centres32 or the band edge bound excitonic emission.56 The peak 5, (2.31 eV) which is only present in the HTO NWs may be associated with surface oxygen vacancies.55 The sole presence of this state in HTO also indicates towards the surface modifications in C-HTO and N-HTO through the functionalization process. A schematic diagram based on the PL spectrum of HTO, depicting the different defect state related emissions in HTO has been shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI.†

However, the formation of O–Ti–C/O–Ti–N bonds due to carbon/nitrogen functionalization in the HTO NWs has already been confirmed using XPS, FTIR, and XRD studies. When a C or N atom replaces one oxygen atom in O–Ti–O, there will be an excess of electronic charge (2 for C, 1 for N). Owing to the total charge neutrality, these electrons will be rejected and they can easily be trapped at different defect states, as shown below.O–Ti–O → O–Ti–C + 2e−O–Ti–O → O–Ti–N + e−V0 + 2e− → FV0 + e− → F+Ti4+ + F → F+ + Ti3+Ti4+ + e− → Ti3+From the above schemes, it may be inferred that carbon functionalization enhances the electron concentration in the material compared to nitrogen functionalization. Many of the excess electrons, produced by the formation of O–Ti–N may be expended to produce Ti3+ states which act as hole traps.57,58 However, in the C-HTO NWs, excess electrons should remain even after formation of Ti3+.
It is well known that when C or N doping is performed under oxygen deficient synthesis conditions (like ours, in an Ar atmosphere), the formation energy for oxygen vacancy (V0) defects get reduced compared to the pristine material (HTO NWs), and between C and N, C costs the least vacancy formation energy.59,60 Hence, a large number of V0 defects must have been produced in the surface functionalized HTO NWs. The formation of a high concentration of V0 defects in the N-HTO and C-HTO NWs, compared to the pristine HTO NWs is also experimentally verified from the PL spectra, where PL emission intensities for the N-HTO and C-HTO NWs are higher than that of the HTO NWs. The maximum PL intensity of the N-HTO NWs may be attributed to a short carrier lifetime or a high recombination rate.
Photo-electrochemical studies

Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the photocurrent density vs. voltage (J–V) plots of the HTO, N-HTO, and C-HTO NWs obtained by performing LSV in the range of 2 to 0 V, under intermittent visible-light illumination. It is found that the value of the photocurrent varies largely depending on the surface functionalization of the HTO NWs, which suggests that the photogeneration of carriers, carrier collection, and change in dark carrier concentration are caused by the incorporation of C and N in the HTO NWs. The photocurrent of the electrodes increases with positive scanning of the applied bias, which indicates the standard n-type nature of the electrode materials. The pristine HTO NWs show the minimum current density, while C-HTO shows the maximum. The dark and photocurrent densities are found to be 0.0023 and 0.029 mA cm−2 for the HTO NWs, 0.0553 and 0.0562 mA cm−2 for the C-HTO NWs, and 0.0123 and 0.0334 mA cm−2 for the N-HTO NWs, respectively, at around 1 V of applied voltage. Large dark current density in the C-HTO NWs signifies large carrier density of the sample.
 Fig. 7  The current density vs. voltage (J–V) plots of the (a) HTO and N-HTO NWs and (b) C-HTO NWs (inset: scaled in picture of the J–V plot in the range of 1–2 V) in intermittent visible light illumination. The current density vs. time (J–t) plots at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NW electrodes (c) in aqueous Na2SO4 solution and (d) in aqueous RhB solution. 
Here, a sharp change in the current density occurs on light ‘on’ and light ‘off’ for both the HTO and N-HTO NWs. But, such sharp change is not observed in the case of the C-HTO NWs. However, the photo-conversion efficiency (η%) for each of the electrodes has been calculated at 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, using the following equation,61 (1)where Jph is the photocurrent density, V is the applied voltage and Pin is the input optical power density. The calculated efficiencies at 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl have been tabulated in Table 2. It is found that the C-HTO NW electrode exhibits maximum photo-conversion efficiency.

Fig. 7(c) shows the photo switching performance of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NW electrodes in 0.5 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, with periodic light ‘on’ and ‘off’ at room temperature. The HTO and N-HTO NWs exhibit identical photo-switching profiles with HTO having a slightly better photo response. Interestingly, for the C-HTO NWs, the dark current density is significantly negative and the magnitude of current decreases with visible-light illumination.21 Generally, when the n-type semiconductor is kept in contact with the electrolyte, where the n-type semiconductor has a higher Fermi level (work function qϕ), compared to the Fermi level (redox potential qE0redox, measured with respect to the vacuum) of the electrolyte, the electrons move towards the liquid from the semiconductor to match the Fermi levels of the two materials.62 This electron transport ultimately results in the creation of a depletion layer at the semiconductor side, containing immobile positively charged ions, and a built-in electric field which causes the up bending of the conduction and valence band edges. Whenever the semiconductor–liquid interface is illuminated with visible-light, electron–hole (e–h) pairs are generated due to the absorption of photons, mostly by different defect states (in this experiment). The holes move towards the electrolyte and the electrons move towards the rear contact, increasing the net current density.
Herein, the photo-switching study of the n-type HTO and N-HTO NWs was conducted at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the positions of the flat band potentials were found to be −0.438 and −0.160 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, from the Mott–Schottky plot (discussed later). The position of the flat band potentials are lower than the applied bias (0 V vs. Ag/AgCl), and here both the HTO and N-HTO NWs are in the depletion region, exhibiting up band bending as shown in Fig. 8(a). However, the scenario is different in the C-HTO NWs, where the position of the flat band potential, 0.433 V vs. Ag/AgCl, is above the applied bias (0 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Therefore, an accumulation region is formed at the C-HTO NW, which causes downward band bending. The electron transfer from C-HTO (working electrode) to the electrolyte may be the cause of the cathodic dark current at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Upon visible-light illumination, mostly, the defect state associated e–h pairs are produced in the C-HTO NWs and the unidirectional movements of electrons and holes towards the electrolyte result in a net decrease in the photocurrent density (see Fig. 8(b)).

Fig. 7(d) shows the photo switching activity of the electrodes in an aqueous RhB solution at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which was later used to study the photocatalytic properties of the electrodes. It is evident from Fig. 7(d) that there is a clear change in the photo switching activity of the electrodes in the RhB solution compared to the aqueous Na2SO4 solution at 0 V. This is quite expected as with the change in electrolyte, the redox potential changes along with the band bending of the semiconductor at the interface leading to changes in the photoswitching activity of the electrodes.
The Mott–Schottky plot for each NW electrode shows a positive slope which indicates that the materials are all n-type semiconductors. The Mott–Schottky relation for an n-type semiconducting material is given as,63,64 (2)where, Cs is the depletion layer capacitance (Cs−2 = (−ωZ′′)2 has been used for calculation from raw data, where ω is the cyclic frequency and Z′′ is the imaginary part of the impedance Z), e is the charge of an electron, εr is the relative permittivity of the medium, ε0 is the free space permittivity, A is the area of the electrode, Nd is the volume carrier density, E is the applied potential, Efb is the flat band potential, k is the Boltzman constant and T is the temperature in absolute scale. The value of the flat band potential is estimated by calculating the potential value, where 1/Cs2 = 0 (extrapolation of Mott–Schottky to the x-axis to find the intercept). Here, each Mott–Schottky plot has been divided into two regions, the accumulation region and the depletion region.65 In the accumulation region, the value of 1/Cs2 is almost constant and close to zero. The accumulation region, enriched with a majority carriers, occurs for E < Efb for n-type materials, and in this region, a semiconductor electrode behaves like a metallic electrode.66 In another region, a linear increment of 1/Cs2 is observed with an increment of applied bias, which corresponds to the depletion region and this region occurs when E > Efb for n-type materials. The electrodes can be operated as photoanodes in the depletion region.66
From Table 3 it is found that the C-HTO NW electrode shows the lowest slope in the Mott–Schottky plot, followed by the HTO and N-HTO NWs, which undoubtedly indicates that the functionalization with carbon has increased the electron carrier density. It is known that the charge carrier density is inversely proportional to the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot . Here, both of the C-HTO and N-HTO NWs electrodes show positive shifts of Efb, compared to the HTO NWs. The positive shift of Efb demonstrates a decrease in the bending of band edges, facilitating better charge transfer.67

The Nyquist plots (Re(Z) vs. −Im(Z)) of the samples are shown in Fig. 8(d). The inset of Fig. 8(d) represents the equivalent electrical circuitry, mainly based on which the value of the active series electrolyte resistance (Rs) has been estimated. The estimated values of Rs for HTO, C-HTO and N-HTO are 11.90, 3.89 and 6.04 Ohm cm2, respectively, which again confirms a comparatively low resistivity of the electrodes upon C and N functionalization.
Photoelectrochemical water splitting
The HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs electrodes were also investigated as photoanodes in the photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction under illumination with visible-light. The amperometric curves (J–t curve) recorded for these three electrodes under visible-light at an applied bias of 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl are shown in Fig. 9. The net photocurrent of the electrodes includes the current due to the photo-generated carriers, formation of double layers and space charges. Therefore, before the visible-light was switched ‘on’, the dark currents for all these electrodes were recorded for 20 seconds to get an idea about the true value of the photocurrent because of the photo-generated carriers from the overall current. It is evident from Fig. 9 that for all of these photoanodes the current increases instantly when the light is switched ‘on’. Afterwards, the photocurrent is found to decrease quite sharply for the N-HTO and HTO NW electrodes, whereas for the C-HTO NW photoanode the photocurrent decreases gradually with time. This type of behaviour of the photoanodes could be attributed the carrier recombination at different surface trap states.64,68,69 The sharp decrease in photocurrent for the N-HTO and HTO NW electrodes indicates a large recombination of the photo-generated carriers because of the presence of defects, acting as recombination centres. However, the estimated magnitudes of the oxygen evolution photocurrents are 0.016, 0.008 and 0.011 mA cm−2 for the C-HTO, N-HTO, and HTO NW electrodes, respectively, which clearly indicates the better photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiency of the C-HTO NW photoanode.

Photocatalytic activity
Being inspired by the visible-light driven photochemical activity of the HTO and surface functionalized HTO NW electrodes, the photocatalytic properties of the electrodes has also been studied in the visible-light region. The visible-light photocatalytic degradation of RhB in the presence of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NW samples are shown in Fig. 10(a) (See Fig. S5 in ESI† for absorption spectra of RhB in presence of the samples.) The photo catalysis reaction with a low concentration of RhB can be described by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model, assuming a pseudo-first order type reaction,70,71 (3)

(c) Percentage degradation of RhB under visible-light for the different electrodes. (d) Schematic representation of the photocatalytic mechanism. 
On solving we find, (4)where, Ct is the instantaneous RhB concentration, C0 is the initial RhB concentration, kp is the pseudo-first order rate constant. The values of kp for the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs estimated from the ln(C0/Ct) vs. time plot (Fig. 10(b)) are 0.911 × 10−3, 0.182 × 10−2, and 0.822 × 10−3 min−1, respectively.
From Fig. 10(c), it is found that the RhB dye degrades by about 3.47, 8.69 and 6.05%, in the presence of the HTO, C-HTO, and N-HTO NWs, respectively, after 60 minutes of illumination and after 120 minutes of illumination, these degradation percentages respectively become 10.77, 18.30 and 10.38%. After 195 minutes of visible-light illumination, the RhB degrades by nearly 32.32% in the presence of the C-HTO NW sample and this result is consistent with other reports on C@TiO2 based nanostructures.21 It is evident that the C-HTO NWs exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity among all of the samples.
All of the HTO NW samples have band gaps in the near UV or blue regions, hence visible-light (λ > 420 nm) cannot make band to band electronic transitions. Therefore, the visible-light driven photocatalytic activity of these NWs is a result of the defect states present within the band gap. When the material is illuminated with visible-light, optically active charge transfer takes place, where the electrons are transferred from the defect state to the conduction band, and from the valence band to the defect states, creating e–h pairs and leaving holes in the valence band and in the defect states of the NWs. Now, the holes can subsequently convert a surface bound water molecule into a hydroxyl (OH˙) radical which causes the degradation of RhB as shown in Fig. 10(d).72,73 Furthermore, the dissolved oxygen molecules react with the photo-generated electrons to produce super oxide anions (O2˙−). These super oxide anions, in turn, produce highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals (OH˙), which play the most crucial role in the degradation of organic dyes.72 Moreover, the superior photocatalytic activity of the C-HTO NWs compared with the other HTO NWs is most expectedly because of the visible-light driven electron transition to the charge transfer states located at carbon, which generates holes in the valence bands of the C-HTO NWs leading to the formation of OH˙.21
The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the C-HTO NWs could be correlated with the high electron carrier density and the PL characteristics of the NWs. It is found that the N-HTO NWs have a slightly better charge carrier density than the HTO NWs, although the N-NTO NWs exhibit the strongest PL emission intensity indicating the large recombination of photo-generated electrons, and hence with the number of holes present in the N-HTO NWs being lower the N-HTO NWs exhibit weak photocatalytic activity, quite similar to that of the HTO NWs. On the other hand, with the C-HTO NWs, which contain a large concentration of electrons, the photo-generated e–h pairs remain separated for a long time (evident from the moderate PL emission intensity) leading to convincingly improved photocatalytic activity.
Conclusions
In summary, a thick network of high aspect ratio n-type H2Ti3O7 nanowires have been successfully prepared through a hydrothermal route. Subsequently, carbon and nitrogen surface functionalized H2Ti3O7 nanowires were also fabricated, through the simple wet chemical method. The diameter of the as prepared NWs is found to be uniform in nature. For the C and N surface engineered H2Ti3O7 NWs, it is evident from the XRD and other spectroscopy techniques that the non-metallic ions get incorporated/doped on the surface of the NWs by replacing oxygen atoms from the H2Ti3O7 lattice. UV absorption studies indicate that the band gap energy of the H2Ti3O7 NWs is blue shifted after doping with C and N atoms. The photoluminescence study confirms that all of these NWs contain various defect states in the blue, blue-green and green wavelength regions, which are found to be responsible for the visible-light photoactive properties of the NWs. Carbon functionalization on the H2Ti3O7 NWs is found to enhance the free electron density, remarkably increasing the net dark current of the material. However, nitrogen functionalization cannot much improve the free carrier density of the NWs compared to that of the pristine H2Ti3O7 NWs. The NW electrodes exhibit a switched photocurrent response under visible-light. Interestingly, for the C-functionalized HTO NWs the net photocurrent density decreases with the incidence of visible-light, which is because of band bending at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface leading to the movement of both electrons and holes in the same direction. The photo-conversion efficiency of the C-HTO NW electrodes is found to increase by 95%, whereas N-functionalization cannot help to increase such performance. The Mott–Schottky study also confirms the presence of a large concentration of free charge carriers in the C-HTO NWs compared to the HTO and N-HTO NWs. The C-HTO NWs also exhibit steady and high photocurrent density leading to an enhancement in the visible-light water splitting characteristics among the electrodes. The visible-light photocatalytic activity of the HTO NWs also enhances remarkably after C-functionalization. Both the efficient visible-light water splitting and photocatalysis of the C-HTO NW electrodes are demonstrated based on the low photo carrier recombination as evident from the photoluminescence study. It is evident that N-functionalization has a negative effect on the PEC properties of the HTO NWs, whereas C-functionalization is an efficient approach to improve the visible-light PEC properties of the HTO NWs. Therefore, the present study demonstrates the efficient utilization of green solar energy through the surface engineering of HTO NWs.
