    , Accepted 26th June 2017First published on 26th June 2017AbstractLi-ion capacitors have been considered as next-generation advanced energy storage systems to meet the requirements of both high energy and high power due to the combination of rapid and long-term charge storage of supercapacitors and the high energy storage capacity of lithium ion batteries. Herein, we demonstrate the design of 2D nanostructured electrodes from low-cost biomass-kapok fiber for Li-ion capacitors: 2D carbon nanosheets with a high surface area and hierarchical porosity for the positive electrode, and 2D MnO/C nanocomposites with a large surface area and nanosized particles for the negative electrode. With the benefit of the structure of the Li-ion capacitor, the hybrid device can be operated at a high operating voltage of 4 V, exhibiting a high energy density of 100 W h kg−1 at 83 W kg−1, a high power density of 20 kW kg−1 at 30 W h kg−1 based on the active materials, and a capacity retention ratio of 70% after 5000 cycles. These results clearly demonstrate that biomass-derived electrodes are potential candidates for low-cost, fast and efficient energy storage systems in the future.
Introduction
Due to the limited availability of fossil fuels and the related environmental pollution, modern society requires sustainable and renewable energy to meet future energy demand.1 However, intermittent renewable resources (such as solar and wind) need efficient energy storage systems. Lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors are currently the most promising energy storage systems.2–5 Supercapacitors have a high power density (∼10 kW kg−1), good cycle stability and fast charge and discharge speed, but their energy density is very low (∼5 W h kg−1).6–10 Lithium-ion batteries have a high energy density (∼150–210 W h kg−1), but their power density and cycle stability are relatively poor.6,11,12 These features are related to their different energy storage mechanisms: supercapacitors can store energy through the adsorption and desorption of ions on the surface of electrodes,13,14 while the energy storage in lithium-ion batteries is through the intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions within the bulk of electrodes.11 However, modern applications need a larger amount of energy to be stored with both high energy and power densities.9 To meet this requirement, fabricating Li-ion hybrid capacitors by combining the advantages of high energy lithium ion batteries and high power supercapacitors is a promising solution.9,15
Li-ion capacitors are commonly constructed by using a lithium-ion battery-type negative electrode and a capacitor-type positive electrode, wherein the lithium-ion battery-type electrode guarantees a large capacity, and the capacitor-type electrode ensures rapid charge storage.9,15 Li-ion capacitors can make full use of the different voltage windows of the two electrodes, and thus the operation voltage of the hybrid capacitors is greatly increased. The energy density of Li-ion capacitors is proportional to the square of the voltage, and then high energy density can be achieved without significantly sacrificing high power. Therefore, Li-ion capacitors can bridge the gap between lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.15 Currently, the most commonly used capacitor-type electrode is activated carbons due to their high surface area and relatively low cost.15 However, activated carbons mainly consist of micropores with tortuous pore connectivity, which restricts their high-power performance.16–19 Compared with activated carbons, nanocarbons (including graphene, porous carbon, and carbon nanotubes) exhibit a smoother pore structure,20 which is more suitable for Li-ion capacitors. On the other hand, the battery-type electrode is commonly insertion-type materials, including graphite, metal oxides/hydroxides, intercalation compounds, and their hybrids.7 Among these, metal oxides have attracted much attention due to their high capacity and natural abundance characteristics.21,22 However, the low conductivity and large structural change make metal oxides suffer from poor rate capability.23,24 Therefore, it is a major challenge to design both negative and positive electrodes to overcome the kinetic limitations for satisfying fast charge–discharge requirements.
In this paper, we design a Li-ion capacitor with 2D hierarchical nanostructured electrodes to satisfy the kinetic demand. Both the positive and negative electrodes were designed based on the kapok fiber precursor. Kapok fiber is a natural plant fiber extracted from kapok trees, which has a cylindrical lumen with thin cell walls (Scheme 1). Kapok fiber is mainly composed of cellulose (64%), lignin (13%), and polysaccharide (23%), which makes it a good candidate for preparing carbon materials.25 Due to the thermal/reaction-induced stress during pyrolysis, the carbonized kapok fiber is split into fragments, creating a 2D sheet-like morphology. By applying KOH activation, a carbon nanosheet material with a high surface area and hierarchical porosity was prepared for the positive electrode, which can provide sufficient ion diffusion channels and active sites for the rapid storage of ions. Besides, nanosized MnO was successfully incorporated into the sheet-like carbon support for the negative electrode. Due to the effect of carbon scaffolds, it is possible to prevent the aggregation of the manganese monoxide particles and accommodate the change of the volume during the charge–discharge process.26,27 As a consequence, a high-performance Li-ion capacitor was constructed by using the above-mentioned two electrodes, which achieves a high energy density of 100 W h kg−1 at a power of 83 W kg−1, and maintains as high as 30 W h kg−1 at a ultrahigh power of 20 kW kg−1. It is worth emphasizing that the used biomass material is inexpensive and environmentally friendly, and manganese is naturally abundant,28,29 so these two electrodes can be produced on a large scale and at low cost, making the hybrid Li-ion capacitor promising for next-generation energy storage devices.

Experimental section
Synthesis of carbon nanosheets
The carbon nanosheets were prepared by a two-step carbonization and activation process using kapok fiber as the precursor. Typically, kapok fiber was first pre-carbonized at 600 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 for 4 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. Second, the pre-carbonized precursor was mixed with KOH at a KOH/precursor weight ratio of 5. Then, the mixture was heated to 900 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 and maintained at the target temperature for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the carbon nanosheets (abbreviated as CNSs) are collected by washing with 2 M HCl and deionized water, filtering, and drying at 100 °C.
Synthesis of the MnO/C nanocomposites
First, the kapok fiber was calcined at 1500 °C (2 °C min−1) in a nitrogen atmosphere for 6 h, and the obtained carbon was labeled C-1500. Then, C-1500 was treated with 50 wt% nitric acid. After stirring at room temperature for 6 h, the carbon was collected after washing with deionized water and drying at 100 °C. Next, 40 mg of nitric acid treated C-1500 was dispersed in an aqueous solution of KMnO4/K2SO4 (200 mL, 10 mM or 100 mM) under stirring for 2 h at room temperature. After this reaction, the mixture was filtered, washed with plenty of deionized water to remove the excess of KMnO4 and K2SO4, and dried at 80 °C. Finally, the dried sample was annealed at 500 °C for 5 h under a flow of argon containing 5.0 vol% hydrogen. The resultant samples were denoted as MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2, which indicates that the used concentration of KMnO4/K2SO4 is 10 and 100 mM.
Materials characterization
The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010), and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance, Cu Kα radiation). The surface chemical composition of the samples was identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation. The specific surface areas and pore size distributions of the samples were evaluated from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms using a Micromeritics 3 Flex™ surface characterization analyzer. The mass loading of MnO in the composite was calculated based on the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Mettler, TG/DSC 2 HT/1600).
Electrochemical measurements
The electrodes were prepared by mixing 75 wt% active material, 15 wt% carbon black and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. The slurry was covered on stainless steel spacers and dried at 120 °C for 12 h under vacuum. For half-cells, 2032 coin cells were assembled inside an Ar-filled glovebox, using 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with a 1:1 volume ratio as the electrolyte, lithium metal foil as the counter electrode and polyethene as the separator. Li-ion capacitors were assembled with CNS cathodes and pre-activated MnO/C anodes. During the pre-activation process, a half-cell was first assembled using MnO/C as the working electrode and Li metal foil as the counter electrode, which was then charged-discharged for several cycles at the current density of 0.1 A g−1. After that, the half-cell was disassembled inside the glovebox, and a Li-ion capacitor was assembled using this pre-activation anode and a pristine cathode. The anode to cathode mass ratio ranged from 1:1 to 1:4. In half cells, the mass loading of the active material is about 1 mg cm−2. In Li-ion capacitors, the mass loading of the active material ranged from 1 mg cm−2 to 4 mg cm−2; meanwhile the areas of the cathode and anode are the same.
All measurements were carried out at room temperature. For half-cells, galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were carried out on a Land Battery Measurement System (CT2001A) at various current densities of 0.1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1. The operating voltage windows for the half-cell anode and half-cell cathode are 3–0.01 V (vs. Li/Li+) and 3.0–4.5 V (vs. Li/Li+). Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Gamry Interface 5000) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. For Li-ion capacitors, the operating voltage window for galvanostatic charge–discharge and CV curves was from 1.0 to 4.0 V. The current densities of Li-ion capacitors were calculated based on the mass of their anodes. The energy and power densities of Li-ion capacitors were calculated as follows:30P = ΔV × I/mE = P × t/3600ΔV = (Vmax + Vmin)/2where I indicates the discharge current (A), m represents the total mass of active materials on both electrodes (kg), t is the discharge time (s), and Vmax and Vmin are the maximum and minimum working voltages during the charge–discharge process (V).
Results and discussion
Material design and structural characterization
The details of the material synthesis procedures for the porous carbon nanosheets and MnO/C nanocomposites are illustrated in Scheme 1. The preparation of carbon nanosheets was based on the pre-carbonization of tube-like kapok fiber and the subsequent KOH activation. It is widely recognized that carbon activation with KOH proceeds according to the equation of 6KOH + 2C ↔ 2K + 3H2 + 2K2CO3, followed by the decomposition of K2CO3 into K2O and CO2, and the possible reaction of K/K2O/CO2 with carbon.31–34 KOH treatment of pre-carbonized kapok fiber results in the formation carbon nanosheets with developed porosity. For the synthesis of MnO/C nanocomposites, the carbon matrix was first obtained under high-temperature thermal pyrolysis, and the tube-like kapok fiber is split into sheet-like carbon fragments. Next, a KMnO4/K2SO4 solution was utilized to deposit manganese oxide on the surface of the carbon matrix, which was transformed into MnO nanocrystallites under a reducing atmosphere. Based on the TGA result, the mass loading of MnO in MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 nanocomposites is 24.9 and 30.6 wt%, respectively (Fig. S1†). It is noteworthy that the reagents employed in the material synthesis process are cost-effective and environmentally benign, which is feasible for the scale-up production of these nanomaterials.
The crystalline behavior of the MnO nanocrystallites in the MnO/C nanocomposites can be evaluated by XRD analysis. As shown in Fig. 1a, all the diffraction patterns from the powder XRD patterns of MnO/C nanocomposites can be well indexed to cubic phase MnO (JCPDs no. 07-0230) except for a broad peak centered at ∼24°, which can be assigned to the (002) peak of graphite. Interestingly, the concentration of KMnO4/K2SO4 solution employed to synthesise the specimens can affect the crystallinity of MnO. With increasing the concentration of KMnO4/K2SO4 solution, the characteristic peaks of MnO become stronger and sharper, indicating the increased degree of crystallinity in MnO.35 From the SEM images (Fig. 2a and b), it can be clearly observed that the spherical MnO particles are densely and uniformly attached to the surface of carbon nanosheets (the thickness of the carbon sheet is ∼350 nm). The TEM images further verified the uniformly distributed MnO nanocrystals (Fig. 2c and d), and an average size of ∼19 and 26 nm can be observed for MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 nanocomposites. The high-resolution TEM images reveal lattice fringes with an inter-planar spacing of 0.25 ± 0.01 nm, corresponding to the (111) planes of MnO. Furthermore, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (insets of Fig. 2e and f) of MnO/C nanocomposites give a set of diffraction rings, which can be assigned to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the cubic structure of MnO. This result is in agreement with the XRD analysis. Therefore, it is clear that the MnO nanoparticles are distributed uniformly on the carbon matrix, and the carbon present in the nanocomposite can be favorable for improving the conductivity.

The chemical compositions of MnO/C nanocomposites can be further investigated by XPS analysis. Fig. 1b displays the Mn 2p XPS spectra of MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 samples. The binding energy of Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 is centered at about 652.8 and 641.1 eV with an energy separation of 11.7 eV, revealing the existence of Mn2+.36,37 The Mn 2p3/2 peak can be divided into three individual peaks centered at about 640.3/640.3 eV, 641.6/641.6 eV and 644.1/644.2 eV for MnO/C-1/MnO/C-2. The peak at 644.1/644.2 eV represents the presence of Mn3+, while the other two peaks refer to Mn2+.38 The existence of Mn3+ may be due to the incomplete reduction of Mn7+/Mn4+.35,39 Moreover, the fitting of a C 1s core level can be resolved into three different carbon functional groups (Fig. S2a†), which shows the presence of C–C/CC (284.6 eV), C–O/C–N (285.4 eV) and CO (289.0 eV).40 In Fig. S2b,† three centered components are resolved from the O 1s peak at 529.7, 531.3 and 532.6 eV representing Mn–O, CO and C–O bonds, respectively.22,28 This result indicates that they still contain oxygen residues, and the oxygen species can firmly bridge the carbon matrix and MnO nanocrystals. Peaks at 399.6 and 403.4 eV represent pyrrolic and graphitic types of N atoms, respectively (Fig. S2c†).40–42 Because of N-doping, the carbon matrix will exhibit good electrical conductivity and high rate capability.43,44 The porosity of MnO/C nanocomposites is analyzed by using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 1c). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area is calculated to be 198 and 157 m2 g−1 for MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 (Table S1†), while the total pore volume is 0.20 and 0.14 cm3 g−1 for MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 samples. Such a high surface area of MnO/C nanocomposites is beneficial for improving the energy and power characteristics of lithium ion batteries. The pore size distributions exhibit that the majority of the pores for MnO/C nanocomposites are in the mesopore range (Fig. 1d), and the proportion of pores larger than 2 nm for MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 is 72.8 and 63.5%, respectively. The abundant pores in the composites can be helpful for accommodating the volumetric change during the insertion/extraction of Li ions, which is beneficial for obtaining excellent electrochemical performance.
The XRD pattern of the CNSs shows two broad peaks centered at 22.3° and 43.8°, which correspond to (002) and (100) planes of graphite (Fig. 1a).45 Based on the (002) peak, the interlayer distance of graphitic layers is calculated to be 0.35 nm. Fig. 3a highlights the morphology of CNSs, and CNSs show a sheet-like structure with a thickness of ∼350 nm. From the TEM image (Fig. 3b), we can see that the CNSs display a nanosheet structure, and there are lots of pores in the CNSs. The TEM image also highlights the partially graphitic structure, and the distance of the graphitic layer is about 0.35 nm, consistent with the XRD analysis. The XPS analysis elucidates that CNSs contain carbon (79.92 at%), oxygen (19.50 at%) and nitrogen (0.58 at%) (Fig. S3†). The C 1s core level XPS spectra can be fitted into four peaks, corresponding to C–C/CC (∼284.6 eV), C–O/C–N (∼285.4 eV), CO (∼288.0 eV), and OC–O (∼290.0 eV), respectively.18 The high resolution O 1s XPS spectrum can be divided into three peaks, positioned at ∼531.5, 533.0 and 535.1 eV, representing CO, C–OH/C–O–C, and COOH groups, respectively.46 The N 1s peak can be deconvoluted into two components centered at 399.9 and 403.4 eV, representing pyrrolic and graphitic types of atoms.40–42 These nitrogen and oxygen functional groups can provide additional active sites and defects for ion storage. The nitrogen sorption isotherm of CNSs shows typical type I/IV curves (Fig. 1c), suggesting that there exist macropores, mesopores and micropores. The hierarchical porous structure of CNSs can be further confirmed by the pore size distribution in Fig. 1d. The surface area of CNSs is calculated to be 2056 m2 g−1, and the total pore volume is 1.83 cm3 g−1 for CNSs (Table S1†). Such a large specific surface area and pore volume are helpful for ion transportation and ion accumulation.

Electrochemical performance of half-cells
We first tested the electrochemical performance in half-cell configurations. Fig. 4a and S4a† exhibit the CV curves of MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 samples in the range of 0.01–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. In the cathodic scan, two peaks appear at <0.1 V and ∼0.65 V in the first cycle, which are related to the conversion reaction (MnO + 2Li+ + 2e− → Mn + Li2O) and the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.47 In the anodic scan, there is a strong peak that appears at around 1.25 V, which is ascribed to the MnO reformation and Li2O decomposition (Mn + Li2O → MnO + 2Li+ + 2e−).48 Moreover, a weak peak at about 2.10 V was also observed, which is due to the oxidation of Mn(II) to a higher valence state.49 From the subsequent cycles, the cathodic peak at ∼0.65 V disappeared and the cathodic peak at <0.1 V shifted to 0.25 V, probably due to the change of the microstructure after the first cycle. The CV curves are basically overlapped from the second to the fifth cycle, indicating excellent electrochemical reversibility.48 The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at various current densities are displayed in Fig. S4b and c.† In accordance with the CV observation, we can clearly see one plateau (∼0.45 V) during the discharge process, corresponding to the reduction of MnO into metallic Mn, and two plateaus (∼1.25 and 2.0 V) during the charge process, corresponding to the oxidation of Mn species. The sloping curves go down from ∼0.35 V to the cutoff voltage of 0.01 V, which can be attributed to the insertion/extraction of lithium ions into the graphitic layers.

(b) Rate capability of MnO/C samples at various current densities, in the voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V vs. Li/Li+. (c) Cycle performance and coulombic efficiency of MnO/C samples at a current density of 1 A g−1. (d) Electrochemical impedance spectra of MnO/C before cycling. (e) Charge and discharge curves of CNSs in every fifth cycle at various current densities. (f) Rate capability of CNSs at various current densities, in the voltage range of 3.0–4.5 V vs. Li/Li+. 
The rate capability of MnO/C nanocomposites is shown in Fig. 4b. The fabricated half-cells were cycled for ten cycles each at increasing current density from 0.1 to 10 A g−1. As illustrated, the carbon matrix C-1500 shows a specific capacity of 371 mA h g−1 after the 10th cycle at 0.1 A g−1, and then 213 mA h g−1 after the 40th cycle at 1 A g−1, and about 111 mA h g−1 after the 70th cycle at 10 A g−1. After the incorporation of MnO, the rate capability of MnO/C nanocomposites is significantly enhanced. For MnO/C-1, the reversible capacity is 506, 390 and 156 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 1.0 and 10 A g−1. Compared to MnO/C-1, MnO/C-2 has a higher specific capacity of 654 and 477 mA h g−1 at 0.1 and 1 A g−1, but a lower capacity of 65 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. The lower capacity of MnO/C-2 at 10 A g−1 can be ascribed to the higher crystallinity and larger size of the nanocrystals, which can hinder the reactivity of the conversion reaction at high currents, resulting in larger capacity fading. Moreover, when the current returns to 0.1 A g−1, the MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 electrodes exhibit a little higher capacity of 536 and 673 mA h g−1 after the 80th cycle than the initial one. The initial coulombic efficiency of MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 is about 65 and 64% at 0.1 A g−1; the large irreversible capacity loss during the initial cycle is associated with the formation of the SEI layer, the decomposition of the electrolyte, and/or the electronic and structural changes.50–52 And most importantly, the electrochemical performance of MnO/C nanocomposites is superior or comparable to those of previously reported MnO/C-100, nMCs, MnO/C and MnO/C–N.29,48,53,54 Besides the rate capability, the cycling performance is also important for practical applications (Fig. 4c). During cycling, the coulombic efficiency gradually increased to 99% in the 10th cycle, and then remained at 99–100% in the following cycles. We can notice that a capacity of 390 mA h g−1 and 460 mA h g−1 can be retained at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles, which is ∼97% of their initial capacities, exhibiting the superior cycling stability of MnO/C nanocomposites.
It should be noted that the specific capacity usually fades with cycles, which is normally caused by the deactivation of the oxides and the pulverization of the electrodes.49 According to the above-mentioned results, the superior rate capability and cycling stability of MnO/C nanocomposites can be ascribed to the following reasons: first, the strong synergistic effect between MnO and the carbon matrix. If we assume that the total reversible capacity of the electrode is the sum of the utilized capacity of each component, the utilization of MnO in the composite can be calculated by dividing its capacity contribution by its weight ratio. It can be found that the utilized capacity of MnO is 913 and 1296 mA h g−1 in MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2, which are much higher than its theoretical capacity (755 mA h g−1),24 indicating the strong interaction between MnO and the carbon matrix. Second, the cycling-induced activation is beneficial for providing additional capacity. During the charge–discharge process, the crystallized metal oxide is gradually changed to an amorphous state,55 which can provide more active sites or defects for lithium storage. Moreover, the reversible growth of the pseudocapacitive polymeric film can lead to extra lithium storage on the SEI, nanocavities, and defective sites. Another possible reason is correlated with the oxidation of Mn(II) into a higher valence state, which is observed from the CV curves. Third, the carbon matrix in the composite can serve as the conductive channel for rapid electron transport, while the nanosized MnO particles can ensure shorter ion transport pathways. Therefore, the well-dispersed MnO nanoparticles and the synergistic effect between MnO and the carbon matrix guarantee the excellent electrochemical performance.
To further emphasize the importance of the synergistic effect, EIS analysis was conducted (Fig. 4d and S4d†), in which Re represents the internal resistance of the cell, and Rct is associated with charge-transfer resistance.48 Remarkably, the charge transfer resistance in the MnO/C-1 electrode is much smaller than that of the MnO/C-2 electrode (80.6 Ω for MnO/C-1 and 156.1 Ω for MnO/C-2) before testing, suggesting lower contact and charge transfer resistances for the MnO/C-1 electrode/electrolyte interface,56 possibly due to the relatively smaller particle size. Meanwhile, the values of Re for MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 electrodes are about 12.8 and 13.5 Ω. The higher slope of the linear part of the MnO/C-1 electrode indicates the less diffusion resistance of lithium ions into electrodes. Therefore, the charge/ion transfer in the MnO/C-1 electrode suffers from less resistance, which would help the MnO/C-1 electrode to achieve higher rate performance.57 After 500 cycles, the values of Re/Rct are decreased to 3.2/25.4 Ω and 4.1/118 Ω for MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2, suggesting the cycling-induced activation, which is beneficial for achieving excellent cycling stability.
To better understand the excellent cycling stability, the structure of the MnO/C-1 electrode after 500 cycles was detected by SEM and TEM analysis (Fig. S5†). From the SEM image, it can be seen that the two-dimensional MnO/C structure is still maintained, and the MnO nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed on the carbon matrix. As shown in TEM images, the MnO nanoparticles in the carbon matrix display lattice fringe spacing values matching the (111) plane of MnO. This result indicates that the carbon support can prevent the MnO nanoparticles from losing electrical contact, which consequently enhances the cycling stability. Encouraged by the excellent electrochemical performance described above, the cycling performance at a higher current density of 5 A g−1 is further evaluated (Fig. S6†). The capacity retention ratio can reach up to 82.8% and 77.0% for MnO/C-1 and MnO/C-2 samples after 5000 cycles. This is among the longest cycle life of MnO and other metal oxide-based electrodes ever reported.24,58–60
The electrochemical performance of the CNS electrode was also evaluated by galvanostatic charge–discharge analysis in the voltage range of 3.0–4.5 V vs. Li/Li+ (Fig. 4e and f). The CNS electrode has a capacity of 51.3 mA h g−1 after the 10th cycle at the current density of 0.1 A g−1, and then 47.2 mA h g−1 after the 40th cycle at 1 A g−1, and 38.1 mA h g−1 after the 70th cycle at 10 A g−1. From 0.1 to 10 A g−1, the CNS electrode exhibits a high capacity retention ratio of 74.3%, indicating its excellent electrochemical performance with high rate capability. When the rate is switched again to 0.1 A g−1, a high capacity of 49.7 mA h g−1 is retained after the 80th cycle. Generally, the hierarchical porosity with combined macro/meso/micropores for CNSs can facilitate ion transport and ion accumulation. Moreover, heteroatom doping (such as oxygen and nitrogen) along with a high surface area (>2000 m2 g−1) is beneficial for providing extra pseudocapacitance, leading to large reversible capacity. The reported reversible capacity is higher than or comparable to those of previously reported activated carbons, trigol-reduced graphene oxide nanosheets, and hierarchical porous N-doped carbon (∼30–70 mA h g−1).61–63
Electrochemical performance of Li-ion capacitors
Lithium-ion hybrid capacitors, also known as Li-ion capacitors, are fabricated by using an electrochemical capacitor-type electrode and a Li-ion battery-type electrode with a Li-ion containing electrolyte. Due to the different potential windows of the two electrodes, the hybrid device can be operated at high voltage (∼4 V), providing an opportunity to achieve high energy without significantly sacrificing high power. In the present work, we design a Li-ion capacitor with the LiPF6− containing electrolyte by using CNSs as the positive electrode and MnO/C-1 as the negative electrode. During the charge storage process, PF6− ions are mainly absorbed in the pores of the CNS electrode, while Li ions are mainly intercalated into the structure of the MnO/C electrode. In order to optimize the electrochemical properties of Li-ion capacitors, the hybrid devices were assembled with different negative to positive mass ratios. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves of the constructed Li-ion capacitors. The CV curves of all devices display a near-rectangular shape at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1, demonstrating a typical capacitive behavior. A pair of weak peaks suggests the pseudocapacitance behavior due to the insertion/extraction of Li ions. With the increase of the positive to negative mass ratio, the CV curves gradually deviate from the ideal shape at the high voltage side, which is correlated with deepening discharge voltage on the negative side. Fig. 5b exhibits the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles at 2 A g−1. It is worth noting that the slopes of the charge and discharge curves are not strictly linear, indicating the combined charge storage mechanisms, in accordance with the CV observation.

(d) Energy–power performance comparison of MnO/C‖CNS versus reported values for hybrid systems based on active mass. 
The Ragone plots of the MnO/C‖CNS Li-ion capacitors are shown in Fig. 5c. It can be found that the Li-ion capacitor with the negative to positive mass ratio of 1:2 exhibits the optimized performance. As expected, a maximum energy density of 100 W h kg−1 can be achieved at the power density of ∼83 W kg−1. Even at a discharge time of 5 s, the energy and power densities of Li-ion capacitors are 30 W h kg−1 and 20 kW kg−1, which are beyond the recommended PNGV power target.64 It is instructive to compare the MnO/C‖CNS hybrid device with previously reported Li-ion capacitors, such as Li4Ti5O12‖TRGO, HC‖AC, LTO‖AC, C-LTO‖AC, CPIMS900‖AC, etc. (Fig. 5d and Table S2†).51,52,61–63,65–76 It can be concluded that our hybrid devices exhibit the most promising energy–power combinations. Considering the fact that both the positive and negative electrodes are designed based on the widely available biomass, the MnO/C‖CNS Li-ion capacitor is applicable for large-scale utilization. As the mass of electrode materials usually accounts for 30–40% of the mass of the total packaged device, a factor of 3 was used to extrapolate the energy and power densities of the packaged hybrid device. For instance, the packaged MnO/C‖CNS Li-ion capacitor can exhibit a high energy density of 20 W h kg−1 at a packaged power density of 100 W kg−1, which can bridge the gap between Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors (Fig. 6).15 The energy and power combinations of our fabricated devices can actually be competitive with those of commercial Ni/MH batteries.77

For practical application, the cycling stability is important. Fig. S7a and b† exhibit the cycling stability and Coulomb efficiency of the Li-ion capacitors tested at a current density of 5 A g−1. It can be observed that the capacity retention ratio decreases with the decrease of the negative to positive mass ratio. After 3000 cycles, the capacity retention ratio is 96%, 73%, 69% and 51% for Li-ion capacitors with the negative to positive mass ratio of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4, respectively. This explanation can be found in the charge/discharge voltage depth in each electrode. For the Li-ion capacitor assembled with a lower negative to positive mass ratio, a lower voltage can be reached in the negative side, and a higher capacity fading can be observed due to the severe volume changes. For further evaluating the cycling stability, the cycling performance of the Li-ion capacitor with a mass ratio of 1:2 is extended up to 5000 cycles (Fig. S7c†), which exhibits good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 70% after 5000 cycles. It is noteworthy that the capacity retention ratio of the MnO/C‖CNS hybrid device is comparable to or better than those of the other literature reported Li-ion capacitors (Fig. S7d†). Moreover, the coulombic efficiency of our fabricated hybrid devices is in the range of 99–100%, revealing their excellent reversibility. We also observe the morphology evolution of the MnO/C-1 electrode of the Li-ion capacitor with a mass ratio of 1:2 after 5000 cycles (Fig. S8†). The MnO nanoparticles are pulverized into nanoclusters over 5000 cycles.58 In this case, the carbon support is beneficial for accommodating the volume change of the active materials and plays an important role in trapping the nanoclusters during cycling, which can prevent the detachment of active materials. TEM observation also demonstrates that MnO nanoparticles are dispersed on the carbon matrix. All the above results further exhibit that the carbon matrix can ensure the MnO/C electrode with steady repetitive capability. Therefore, the Li-ion capacitors can show excellent electrochemical performance.
EIS analysis was applied to further elucidate the capacity fading during cycling (Fig. S9†). With decreasing of the negative to positive mass ratio, the Li-ion capacitor shows higher values of Rct (28.2, 43.2, 46.4 and 70.0 Ω), which can be ascribed to the high voltage depth in the anode. Therefore, its capacity retention ratio is reduced with the decrease of the negative to positive mass ratio. For the Li-ion capacitor with the negative to positive mass ratio of 1:2, the Rct after cycling (7.2 Ω for 3000 cycles and 5.6 Ω for 5000 cycles) is smaller than that before cycling (43.2 Ω); the reduced charge-transfer resistance is beneficial for improving the reaction kinetics and enhancing its electrochemical performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated 2D carbon nanosheets and MnO/C nanocomposites as positive and negative electrodes for Li-ion capacitors by using a biomass precursor (kapok fiber). The MnO/C composite has a large specific surface area and a nanoscale ion diffusion pathway, thereby facilitating the insertion and extraction of lithium ions. In addition, the CNS electrode with a high specific surface area and a hierarchical porous structure can improve the supercapacitive performance. Benefitting from the designed electrodes with improved electrochemical kinetics, the Li-ion capacitors assembled with MnO/C and CNSs offer excellent electrochemical properties, exhibiting a superior energy output and power delivery, which can bridge the gap between batteries and supercapacitors. The strategy in the present work can not only provide a potential approach for developing advanced carbon-based electrode materials, but also provide a universal model for fabricating high energy Li-ion capacitors with high power and low cost.
