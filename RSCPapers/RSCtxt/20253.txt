    , Accepted 30th December 2015First published on 4th January 2016AbstractThe synergistic effect of coupling a photooxidation catalyst, tantalum oxynitride, and manganese oxide (MnOx) as electrooxidation catalyst in multi-component photoanodes for water oxidation is explored in near-neutral solutions under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The anodes have been formed by using different electrochemical methods to deposit MnOx on screen-printed TaON films, pre-modified with TiO2 coatings (TiO2–TaON). By using SEM/EDX, ICP-MS analysis of the amount of Mn deposited and, electrochemical techniques, we demonstrate that selective deposition of fine-structured nm-sized MnOx flakes on the photocatalytically active TiO2–TaON surface is achieved when the electrodeposition is carried out under visible light irradiation, but not in the dark. The MnOx/TiO2–TaON anodes produced using the photo-assisted method exhibit improved activity and better long-term stability during water photooxidation under visible light irradiation when compared to the TiO2–TaON films modified with MnOx in dark. A 7-fold enhancement in the oxidative photocurrent densities under voltammetric and chronoamperometric conditions in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6) is observed for the films prepared by the photo-assisted method. The Mn-loading in the best performing films is ca. 0.8 wt% and higher loadings were found to lower the photocatalytic activity. Continuous water photooxidation over MnOx/TiO2–TaON anodes in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6) at potentials more positive than ca. 1.0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode coarsens the fine structure of the MnOx material, and this structural degradation is mirrored in a slow deterioration of the photocatalyst performance.
Introduction
Hydrogen derived from non-carbonaceous feedstock using sunlight, an essentially perpetual energy resource, is nowadays acclaimed as a next-generation sustainable energy carrier. This can be achieved by photochemical decomposition of water into H2 and O2 (by-product) through a complex multi-electron process powered by electrons and holes generated in a semiconducting catalyst under irradiation.1–5 Thus, discovery of efficient and robust semiconducting materials that use sunlight to produce H2 and O2via water splitting offers the possibility of a renewable route capable of breaking the global dependence on energy from fossil fuels.
Theoretically, a potential of 1.23 V is sufficient to sustain electrochemical water splitting, which can be represented by two half-cell reactions as in Scheme 1. This corresponds to a free energy change for the overall reaction of 237 kJ mol (H2O or H2)−1 under standard conditions. However, effective water splitting requires additional energy to compensate for overpotentials needed to maintain high rates of electron-transfer processes at electrode|electrolyte interfaces and to account for electrical resistance of electrodes, cell interconnections and electrolyte solution.6–10 Taken together, these losses increase the potential needed for efficient decomposition of water into H2 and O2 in an electrochemical cell to at least 1.6 V.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram showing possible electron transfer processes during oxygen evolution (O2/H2O) at the TiO2–TaON photoanode modified with MnOx and hydrogen evolution (H+/H2) reactions at a metal cathode. 
An advantage of a photochemical approach is that the excess energy requirements can be satisfied by using electrons and holes photogenerated by a semiconductor material with a sufficiently wide band gap (EG > 1.6 eV) (Scheme 1).6,7,10 At the same time, an ideal semiconductor photocatalyst should have a sufficiently narrow band-gap energy (EG < 3 eV) to allow efficient visible light (λ > 400 nm) absorption.11 Furthermore, valence and conduction band-edge levels must enclose the reversible potentials of the oxygen evolution (O2/H2O) and hydrogen evolution (H+/H2) reactions, as shown in Scheme 1.10,12 In a perfect scenario, hydrogen can be produced from water by making optimal use of sunlight with no additional energy needed.
One of the semiconductors meeting the above requirements is tantalum oxynitride (TaON), which has attracted much attention as a promising material for designing photoanodes for water splitting over the last decade.13–21 Indeed, TaON has a narrow band gap of 2.5 eV, which allows absorption of visible light (with λ ≤ 500 nm), and the valence and conduction band-edge levels are appropriately positioned to drive the overall water splitting reaction with theoretically no externally applied potential (Scheme 1).22–24 On the down side, as with most oxynitrides, TaON undergoes oxidative self-deactivation upon irradiation due to interaction of the photo-generated holes with N3− anions leading to the formation of N2 gas and the essentially inactive and insulating Ta2O5, which is poor visible light absorber as defined by EG = 3.9 eV.23 Thus, the transfer of photo-generated holes from the bulk of TaON to the surface where water oxidation occurs becomes thermodynamically difficult due to the presence of Ta2O5 layers and mismatch in the valence band-edge levels.
In order to improve the stability and, thereby, enhance the performance of TaON photoanodes, the so-called post-necking treatment has been applied.13,25–27 In this process, a crystalline TaON film is modified with thin coatings of TiO2, or Ta2O5, or TaON itself. Such a treatment improves the interconnection of the TaON particles and facilitates charge transfer within the mesoporous electrode and at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This treatment results in significant, by at least an order of magnitude, enhancement in water photooxidation activity. Even more impressive improvements can be achieved by coupling the TaON-based photoanodes with efficient water oxidation electrocatalysts, viz. IrO2 or cobalt oxide (CoOx), which scavenge photo-generated holes on the tantalum oxynitride surface and thus suppress self-deactivation of the photoanode.13,25,28 However, despite the impressive performance of the fresh IrO2-modified TaON electrodes with incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of ca. 76% (at 400 nm at 0.6 V vs. Ag|AgCl at pH = 6), they still suffer degradation during long-term stability measurements. This was rationalised in terms of a non-uniform distribution and agglomeration of the IrO2 particles on the TaON surface. Indeed, photo-generated holes have short diffusion lengths in n-type semiconducting materials and uniform distribution of the hole-scavenging material is critical for efficient withdrawal of these holes from TaON. In confirmation of this hypothesis, introduction of highly dispersed CoOx nanoparticles onto the TaON films resulted in the most stable TaON-based photoanodes reported to date.28 Although their performance was inferior to that of IrO2–TaON, the CoOx-modified TaON films exhibit remarkable stability under water oxidation turnover conditions and are also free of precious noble metal components.
In this study, we extend this approach13,28 by introducing a manganese oxide (MnOx) cocatalyst onto the screen-printed TaON photoanodes. Manganese oxides are well-known efficient, robust and earth abundant water oxidation catalysts,29–34 and we hypothesised that fine MnOx nanostructures can scavenge the photo-generated holes utilising them to oxidize water. This might be possible since the valence band position of MnOx is slightly more positive on the energy scale than that of TaON (as schematically shown in Scheme 1) although there is some variation in the literature data.23,35,36 Manganese oxide deposits are also expected to suppress the self-deactivation of TaON particles in a similar fashion to CoOx. Uniform and selective deposition of MnOx on the TaON surface, which should promote efficient hole scavenging,36–38 was achieved by photo-assisted electrooxidation of Mn2+ on the illuminated TaON photoanodes but not when deposition was performed in the dark. Following our previous study,26 the TaON films were post-necked with thin TiO2 coatings prior to MnOx deposition to improve performance and stability. The MnOx deposition conditions were optimised to maximise the photo-electrocatalytic water oxidation activity of the electrodes. Comprehensive characterisation of the MnOx deposits on the TiO2-modified TaON films (hereinafter TiO2–TaON) was undertaken using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and electrochemical techniques (voltammetry, chronoamperometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)).
Experimental section
Materials
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass sheets with the resistance of 10 Ω cm−2 were sourced from Dyesol (NSW, Australia) and used as a substrate for screen-printing of the TaON films. The TaON powder was prepared from Ta2O5 powder under NH3 flow at 850 °C for 15 h as reported earlier.22 All chemicals were sourced from either Sigma Aldrich or Merck and used as received. Reverse osmosis purified water was used for preparation of solutions and all experimental procedures. The preparation and titania post-necking treatment of the screen-printed TaON films (1.5 μm thickness; 0.2 cm2 geometric area; ca. 1 mgTaON cm−2 loading) on a FTO substrate was undertaken as described elsewhere.26 For post-necking, the previously optimised amount of TiO2 (ca. 15 wt%), achieved by using 20 μL of 20 mM ethanolic TiCl4 precursor solution,26 was maintained for all electrodes studied herein.
Photo-electrochemical methods
All experiments were carried out at ambient temperature (25 ± 1 °C) in a three-electrode Zahner-Elektrik PECC-1 photo-electrochemical cell using Bio-Logic VSP Modular potentiostat and a 150 W xenon arc lamp (as a light source with a horizontal light beam) fitted to an Oriel solar simulator and equipped with an AM 1.5G filter to match the solar spectrum. Neutral density filters were used to adjust the light intensity to 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), as measured using a Hamamatsu S1133 photoactive diode connected to a multimeter. A long pass filter was used to provide visible light irradiation. Throughout the text, visible light refers to irradiation with λ > 400 nm and intensity of 1 sun unless otherwise stated. Band pass filters with an average band-width of 10 nm and mean wavelengths of 390, 410, 430, 450, 470, 490, 510 and 530 were applied for the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements and the corresponding power output was measured.
Freshly prepared TiO2–TaON films on FTO were used as working electrodes for the deposition of MnOx and subsequent characterisation. An inert polyimide tape (Kapton) was used as a mask around the screen-printed film to avoid electrodeposition of MnOx on the surrounding FTO area. In some experiments, unmodified FTO glass with an electrochemically active area of 0.2 cm2 (framed by a Kapton tape mask) was used as a working electrode. As auxiliary and reference electrodes, a high surface area Pt wire and Ag|AgCl|KCl(sat.) (BAS) (hereinafter Ag|AgCl) were employed and all potentials are reported versus this reference system unless otherwise stated. Throughout the paper, the currents are normalised to the geometric area of the screen-printed films.
MnOx deposition was performed using aqueous solutions containing Mn(CH3COO)2 (concentration varied from 0.001 to 0.5 M) and 0.1 M Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte (pH = 5). It was carried out at either a constant current density (Jdep = 250 μA cm−2) or a constant potential (Edep = −0.2, 0.0, 0.7 or 0.9 V vs. Ag|AgCl) under visible light illumination or in the dark. Following deposition, the MnOx-modified TiO2–TaON electrodes (MnOx/TiO2–TaON) were carefully washed with copious amounts of water prior to characterisation by SEM/EDX and/or electrochemically. The latter included cyclic voltammetric (typically, scan rate, v = 0.025 V s−1), chronoamperometric and EIS (frequency range 1 Hz to 100 KHz, amplitude 0.01 V) measurements in the dark and under continuous or chopped visible light irradiation. Aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6) was used as a supporting electrolyte solution for most experiments. However, 0.1 M Na2SO4 + NaOH solution (pH = 12), 0.1 M borate buffer (pH = 9.2) and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7) solutions were additionally used for chronoamperometric experiments.
Characterisation
The morphology of the MnOx deposits on TiO2–TaON was examined before and after electrochemical studies using field-emission SEM (FEI Nova NanoSEM 450), and EDX was used to analyse the elemental composition. Samples for the SEM/EDX analysis were prepared by mounting the films on the FTO substrates over the SEM specimen stubs using a carbon tape. For selected samples, the amount of Mn deposited was quantified using ICP-TOF-MS analysis (GBC Optimass 9500). Solutions were prepared by digesting the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films in concentrated HNO3 (ca. 70%) for 5 hours at 60 °C and further diluted to obtain a Mn concentration below 2 μM (ca. 100 ppm) in 2% HNO3. Raw count rates from the analysis were externally standardised by means of a calibration curve constructed using a commercially available manganese stock solution (ICP-MS reference standard by AccuStandard). Drift corrections were applied by the use of solution of indium as internal standard (ICP-MS reference standard by AccuStandard). The measurement precision was 3–5% in terms of relative standard deviation.
Results and discussion
Optimisation of the MnOx electrodeposition conditions
Manganese oxide was electrodeposited over TiO2–TaON photoanodes (i.e., TaON films modified with thin titania coatings to improve the water photooxidation capacity of TaON26) using aqueous Mn2+ solutions with 0.1 M Na2SO4 added as a supporting electrolyte (pH = 5). Preliminary optimisation studies defined the electrodeposition conditions resulting in a synergistic effect from the MnOx cocatalyst and the TiO2–TaON photoanode. Photoactivity screening was conducted for the samples prepared by applying a constant current density (Jdep = 250 μA cm−2) to the TiO2/TaON electrodes immersed in Mn(CH3COO)2 aqueous solutions of different concentrations (cMn) for varied deposition times (tdep). Photooxidation activity was assessed by measuring voltammograms (current–potential dependence) and chronoamperograms (current–time dependence at a constant potential) under chopped irradiation conditions, which allow convenient discrimination between ‘dark’ and photoinduced redox processes. The results obtained for films prepared either under visible light (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) or in the dark are summarised in Fig. S1–S4 of ESI.† The oxidative photocurrent density measured voltammetrically at 0.65 V under visible light illumination increased gradually with increasing tdep and cMn. It reached maximum (ca. 300 μA cm−2) when electrodeposition of MnOx was carried out under either dark or illumination for tdep = 1–1.5 min and cMn = 0.01–0.02 M (Fig. S1 and S3†). On further increasing the electrodeposition time (tdep > 1.5 min), the photocurrent densities for the resulting films deteriorated rapidly. Using Mn2+ concentrations above 0.02 M did not change the photooxidation activity significantly. Similar results were obtained from chronoamperometric experiments undertaken at 1.0 V (Fig. S2 and S4†). Overall, the optimisation study suggests that an increase in MnOx loading on TiO2–TaON enhances the oxidative photocurrents generated under visible light illumination, but a point is reached where the MnOx most probably inhibits light absorption by TaON and this reduces the activity of the photoanode. From these screening studies, optimised MnOx deposition conditions were established as cMn = 0.01 M and tdep = 1 min for both ‘dark’ and photo-assisted methods, and were used for fabrication of most samples discussed below. The following sections focus on the influence of the deposition mode, viz. photo-assisted vs. ‘dark’ and constant potential (potentiostatic) vs. constant current (galvanostatic), on the morphology and photocatalytic properties of the MnOx/TiO2–TaON photoanodes.
Efficiency of MnOx electrodeposition: effect of light
Typical transients obtained during deposition of MnOx over TiO2–TaON in constant current and constant potential regimes in the dark and under continuous visible light illumination are shown in Fig. 1. Comparison of these data confirms unambiguously that TaON acts as an efficient photocatalyst for oxidation of Mn2+ even at very negative deposition potentials (e.g. Edep = −0.2 V). We also anticipated and eventually established (vide infra) that photo-assisted oxidation of Mn2+ should allow MnOx to be selectively deposited on the photocatalytically active TaON surface.
 Fig. 1  Transients for (A) constant current (Jdep = 250 μA cm−2) and (B) constant potential (Edep = −0.2 (green), 0.0 (magenta) and 0.7 V (red)) deposition of MnOx on TiO2–TaON in dark (dashed curves) and under continuous visible light irradiation (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) (solid curves). Deposition solution: aqueous 0.01 M Mn(CH3COO)2 with 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 5). 
Cyclic voltammetric characterisation of the MnOx-modified TiO2–TaON films also confirms that illumination of the electrode during deposition facilitates Mn2+ oxidation and allows more manganese oxide to be deposited (Fig. 2). At the most negative Edep of −0.2 V examined, a very small amount of MnOx is produced on the TiO2–TaON surface in the dark. This is reflected in the emergence of stable oxidation and reduction voltammetric processes in the 0.4–0.8 V potential range not found with the parent TiO2–TaON (Fig. 2A). Under the same conditions, but with the electrode under continuous visible light illumination, the amount of the MnOx deposited is enhanced significantly. Indeed, substantially higher currents (and consequently, charge) for MnOx deposition (Fig. 1B) and for redox transformations of MnOx immobilised on TiO2–TaON (Fig. 2A) are achieved when using the photo-assisted deposition method. The same behaviour was found for other deposition potentials examined (Fig. 2 and 1B).
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammograms (scan rate, v = 0.025 V s−1) in the dark for TaON–TiO2 (black), MnOx/TiO2–TaON (green, magenta, blue, red), and MnOx/FTO (purple) in contact with aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6). MnOx was electrodeposited from aqueous 0.01 M Mn(CH3COO)2 with 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 5) for 1 min in dark (dashed curves) or under illumination (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) (solid curves) at a constant Jdep = 250 μA cm−2 (B: blue and purple) or constant Edep = −0.2 (A: green), 0.0 (A: magenta) or 0.7 V (B: red) vs. Ag|AgCl. 
At positive Edep (0.7 and 0.9 V), the voltammetric response from the MnOx/TiO2–TaON electrodes qualitatively resembles that obtained for MnOx deposited at a constant current density Jdep = 250 μA cm−2 on a TaON-free FTO support. Multiple unresolved processes are observed within the whole potential range relevant to Fig. 2. These signals reflect a variety of transitions between different Mn oxidation states originating from the rich redox chemistry of manganese.39–42 Thus, analysis of electrochemical data confirms that photo-generated holes on the TiO2–TaON surface oxidise dissolved Mn2+ species thereby promoting the electrodeposition of MnOx on the photoanode surface.
The presence of manganese on the TiO2–TaON films was confirmed by ICP-MS analysis (Table 1). At Edep = 0.0 V, irradiation of the TaON-based electrodes with visible light enhances the amount of manganese oxides produced by almost an order of magnitude, while at more negative (−0.2 V) and more positive deposition potentials (0.7 V) a two-fold enhancement is achieved (Table 1). In principle, the amount of manganese oxides produced on the TiO2–TaON surface can be also estimated from the charge measured during electrodeposition of MnOx (Q/C; can be calculated e.g. by integrating the data in Fig. 1B) and the use of Faraday's law:  where NMn/mol is the amount of Mn2+ oxidised (and presumably, MnOx produced), F = 96485 C mol−1 is the Faraday constant, n is the number of electrons transferred, which is assumed to be 1.7 on the basis of the XANES studies on electrodeposited MnOx.43–45

We attempted probing the electronic state of Mn in the selected MnOx/TiO2–TaON samples using XPS, but very low loadings of MnOx in comparatively thick mesoporous TiO2–TaON layers precluded us from obtaining data of sufficient quality from these multicomponent anodes to permit careful analysis of peak positions (Fig. S5†). In particular, the Mn 3s core level spectrum needed to estimate an average oxidation state of manganese was at the noise level and, therefore, not amendable to analysis. Nevertheless, semiquantitative comparisons of the Mn 2p core level spectra for MnOx/TiO2–TaON and MnOx electrodeposited on plain FTO glass suggests that the resulting materials are similar. In turn, the characteristics of the XP spectrum obtained for the MnOx/FTO control sample (Table S1†) were very similar to the data reported in a recent study on electrodeposited manganese oxide catalysts.45 This observation suggests that the electronic state of Mn and Mn:O stoichiometry of electrodeposits obtained under our conditions are not strongly different from those in previous literature,45 and justify our assumption that an average oxidation state of manganese is 3.6–3.8 (see above and Table 1). However, caution must be taken in interpretation of these results since conventional XPS is an ex situ method and cannot be used to probe the electronic state of manganese under conditions relevant to a photo-electrochemical experiment.
The voltammetric data (Fig. 2B) indicate that the amount of MnOx produced on TiO2–TaON was not notably influenced by visible light irradiation for deposition under constant current conditions. This is not unexpected since the charge passed is identical irrespective of the nature of the deposition process (electrochemical vs. photoelectrochemical). However, as shown in Table 1, the amount of Mn deposited was still enhanced upon irradiating the TiO2–TaON electrode during galvanostatic deposition. This can be explained in terms of a lower contribution of side oxidation processes to the overall charge passed. Indeed, when MnOx deposition was undertaken in dark at Jdep = 250 μA cm−2, the potential of the electrode was maintained close to 0.7 V (Fig. 1A), but was substantially more negative under continuous illumination. It should also be noted that clear differences in the redox behaviour of the MnOx coatings formed at Jdep = 250 μA cm−2 on TiO2–TaON anodes in dark and under illumination were detected voltammetrically (Fig. 2B).
Microstructure of MnOx deposits on TiO2–TaON
The microstructure of MnOx deposited on the TiO2–TaON films under different conditions was explored by SEM. Images taken on representative sets of samples are shown in Fig. 3 and S6.† Comparison of the SEM micrographs for the parent TiO2–TaON electrode (Fig. 3A) and for those modified with MnOx at negative potentials (Edep = −0.2 and 0.0 V) in dark confirms negligible deposition of manganese oxide (Fig. 3C and S6B†). Indeed, these potentials are not positive enough to sustain electrodeposition of MnOx from Mn2+ aqueous solution.32,46 However, electrodeposition was facilitated under illumination by the photo-generated holes on the TaON surface. These holes oxidise Mn2+ ions to produce MnOx in the form of flaky nanostructures readily identifiable in the SEM images (Fig. 3D and E). This observation is in agreement with the Mn content in the photoanodes (Table 1) as well as with chronoamperometric and voltammetric data (Fig. 1 and 2). Larger amounts of interconnected MnOx flakes were found in the films when more positive potentials, viz. at Edep = 0.7 or 0.9 V and at Jdep = 250 μA cm−2, were used under both dark and illuminated conditions (see Fig. 3F–I, S6C and S7†).
 Fig. 3  SEM images obtained for (a) TiO2–TaON, (b) MnOx/FTO and (c–i) MnOx/TiO2–TaON. Electrodeposition of MnOx was carried out under conditions defined in figure and in the caption to Fig. 1. 
EDX analysis performed on ca. 2 μm × 2.5 μm areas was used to further confirm the increase in the amount of MnOx deposited under visible light irradiation as compared to dark conditions (Fig. S7†). The EDX spectra for all MnOx-modified TiO2–TaON films show characteristic Kα X-ray peak for Mn at 5.89 keV, which is not observed for the TiO2–TaON electrodes. In agreement with our previous report,26 the Kα X-ray signal for Ti at 4.51 keV was found for the titania post-necked samples, but not for the unmodified TaON films. For the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films, the Mn peak intensity was higher when deposition was performed under illumination than in dark, and also increased when using more positive Edep (Fig. S7†).
Importantly, MnOx nanostructures were selectively deposited over the TiO2–TaON particles when electrodeposition was carried out under illumination (see Fig. 3D, E, G and I, and Fig. S6B and C†). In contrast, deposition occurred randomly in the dark and manganese oxide was found on the underlying FTO and/or TiO2-coated FTO surface, which was left uncovered during the screen-printing of TaON (see Fig. 3C, F and H, and Fig. S6B and C†). These results are in accord with our expectation that photo-assisted electrodeposition should allow preferential formation of MnOx on photoactive sites on the TaON-based particles. This is desired in order to prevent self-deactivation of TaON by scavenging photo-generated holes and to promote water oxidation catalysis.
Collectively, electrochemical data as well as the SEM, EDX and ICP-MS analyses indicate that illumination of the TiO2–TaON films promotes electrodeposition of MnOxvia the oxidation of Mn2+ ions by the photo-generated holes at the TaON surface. Thus, higher amounts of MnOx are deposited preferentially on the photo-catalytically active TiO2–TaON surface, either by applying a constant potential or current under visible light illumination, while lower amounts of MnOx and poor coverage of TiO2–TaON are produced in the dark.
Effect of MnOx on the photo-electrocatalytic activity of TaON
The photo-oxidation activities of the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films were first compared to that of the parent TiO2–TaON anode in a voltammetric regime (Fig. 4). In the dark, all samples studied showed negligible oxidative currents in the potential range from −0.3 to 0.7 V. This is not unexpected, as the standard electrode potential for the water oxidation (or oxygen evolution) reaction at pH = 6 used in the majority of our experiments is ca. 0.68 V. However, significant oxidative photocurrents were generated once the MnOx/TiO2–TaON and TiO2–TaON electrodes were irradiated with visible light (1 sun, λ > 400 nm). As shown in Fig. 4, the photocurrent densities achieved with the TiO2–TaON films were enhanced by about 2-fold even when small amounts of MnOx were electrodeposited under illumination at negative deposition potentials (Edep = −0.2 or 0.0 V). There was either little change (Edep = −0.2 V) or an increase by less than 50% (Edep = 0.0 V) for the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films produced in dark. The enhancement in the photooxidation capacity of TiO2–TaON by the MnOx cocatalyst suggests the feasibility of the concept depicted in Scheme 1. It further confirms the applicability of previously elaborated approaches for creating better water oxidation photocatalysts by combining catalytically active transition metal oxides with photoactive TaON. Note that MnOx itself is a poor photocatalyst under the conditions examined (Fig. 4C).
 Fig. 4  Voltammograms (v = 0.025 V s−1) obtained under chopped visible light irradiation (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) for MnOx/TiO2–TaON (i and ii), TiO2–TaON (iii), TaON (iv) and MnOx/TiO2 (v) in contact with aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6). MnOx was electrodeposited at Edep = −0.2 (A), 0.0 (B) or 0.7 V vs. Ag|AgCl (C), or at Jdep = 250 μA cm−2 (D) for 1 min under illumination (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) (i, v) or in dark (ii). Other conditions were as indicated in Fig. 2. Each voltammogram has been corrected for the corresponding dark current at 0.1 V to facilitate comparisons of the photocurrents. 
The enhancement in the photooxidation activity of the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films produced at Edep = −0.2 and 0.0 V is not very high (Fig. 4A and B). Therefore, we further explored the possibility to improve the photoanode performance by depositing more MnOx, whilst keeping in mind that excessive amounts of manganese oxide decrease the oxidation photocurrents (vide supra and Fig. S1–S4†). As described above, photoanodes with higher MnOx loadings are readily obtained by using more positive deposition potentials as provided by Edep = 0.7 and 0.9 V or Jdep = 250 μA cm−2. Indeed, further enhancement in the photooxidative currents was achieved by increasing the MnOx loading, but the effect was greater at potentials more negative than ca. 0.4 V (Fig. 4). Under voltammetric conditions and at 0.65 V (which corresponds to ca. −0.03 V overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction under the employed conditions), photocurrent densities of up to 350 μA cm−2 were measured for the best performing MnOx/TiO2–TaON photoanode (Edep = 0.7 V, photo-assisted deposition), whereas ca. 130 μA cm−2 was achieved with TiO2–TaON.
The enhancement in the photooxidation activity is more impressive at less positive potentials (<0.4 V), where the performance of the manganese-free TiO2–TaON sample (ca. 30 μA cm−2) was improved by a factor of ca. 5–7 (up to 250 μA cm−2) upon modification with comparatively high loadings of MnOx provided by using Edep = 0.7 V. Electrodeposition of MnOx was also carried out at the even more positive potential of 0.9 V. However, this decreased the oxidative photocurrent densities possibly due to blockage of the catalytically active sites on the TaON surface and quenching of visible light absorption by ‘thick’ MnOx layers. Moreover, use of positive potentials during electrodeposition can promote oxidative degradation of TaON26 and eventually result in poorer performance of the MnOx-modified photoanode. This finding is consistent with the outcomes of preliminary optimisation of the electrodeposition procedure (vide supra).
Closer inspection of the voltammograms in Fig. 4 recorded for the MnOx-rich photoanodes, especially for those prepared in dark, suggests that a certain portion of the relevant photooxidative currents is not due to water oxidation. This is best seen for the sample obtained by electrodepositing MnOx in the dark at Edep = 0.7 V (Fig. 4C), where short-range photooxidation current ‘spikes’ are mirrored by dark reduction processes that are comparable in intensity and shape (Fig. 4C, blue trace). Apparently, those are not due to water oxidation and reduction of O2 back to water, but are much more likely associated with oxidation by photoexcited TaON and subsequent voltammetric reduction of Mn species (cf., Fig. 4C and Fig. 2B). The reason why a notable part of oxidised manganese does not further interact with water to oxidise it but remains in a higher oxidation state until the light is off is not understood at the moment. Presumably, this effect might have a structural origin and reflect poor connectivity between MnOx electrodeposited in dark and the TiO2–TaON particles. It is also possible that the coupled photooxidation – dark reduction voltammetric ‘spikes’ are due to dissolved Mn species (vide infra), which do not contribute notably to water oxidation catalysis.
Generally, this effect was inherent to the samples produced by electrodepositing MnOx on TiO2–TaON in dark. All MnOx/TiO2–TaON anodes obtained by MnOx deposition in light generated photooxidative currents followed by negligible reduction processes under chopped light irradiation conditions at potentials more positive than ca. 0 V (Fig. 4). This observation suggests that these photocurrents registered with the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films produced via the photo-assisted approach are dominated by water oxidation.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Selected samples were also analysed by EIS to examine the effect of MnOx cocatalyst on the charge-transfer properties of the semiconducting TiO2–TaON anodes. Representative Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 5 and S8.† Previously,26 we have undertaken a detailed quantitative EIS analysis to demonstrate that TiO2 coatings facilitate charge transfer within and at the surface of the TaON films. Herein, we limit the discussion of the EIS data to qualitative comparisons due to significant ambiguities in the nature of interfaces created by deposition of heterogeneous semiconducting MnOx structures on top of the TiO2-modified TaON particles and in parameterisation of relevant equivalent circuits.
 Fig. 5  Nyquist plots at 0.05 V vs. Ag|AgCl for TiO2–TaON (black) and MnOx/TiO2–TaON. MnOx was electrodeposited for 1 min at Edep = 0.0 (green, magenta) or 0.7 V (blue, red) in dark (magenta, blue) or under illumination (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) (green, red). Other deposition conditions were as indicated in Fig. 2. EIS data were obtained (A) in dark or (B) under illumination (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) in aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6). Symbols show the experimental data, lines are guides to the eye. 
Upon dark and photo-assisted modification of TiO2–TaON with low MnOx loadings (e.g. at Edep = 0.0 V), slight and very similar decreases in the impedance of the non-irradiated films were found (Fig. 5A). However, very significant differences in EI spectra are revealed when the same electrodes are probed under visible light irradiation (Fig. 5B). In particular, the Nyquist plot for the MnOx/TiO2–TaON (Edep = 0.0 V) synthesised in the dark resembles qualitatively that for the unmodified TiO2–TaON. This is in contrast to the substantially lower intensity EI spectra featuring a typical response from the MnOx material present in the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films prepared under visible light irradiation (Edep = 0.0 V) (inset in Fig. 5B). A fingerprint of the EI spectrum for MnOx is a diffusional Warburg component manifesting as a near straight line at low frequencies (i.e. in the higher real impedance regions of the Nyquist plots). This is believed to be due to the diffusion of cations within the oxide.39,47 At high MnOx loadings, achieved at e.g. Edep = 0.7 V, this feature is clearly identifiable when EI spectra are obtained under both dark and visible light irradiation conditions (Fig. 5).
On a qualitative level, these observations can be interpreted in terms of the substantial facilitation of charge transfer at the electrode|electrolyte interface, which makes a dominant contribution to the impedance of the MnOx-free TiO2–TaON photoanodes.26 Modification of the electrode surface with MnOx allows significantly higher rates of electron transfer within this interface as follows from inspection of the data in Fig. 5. When the EI spectra are obtained under visible light illumination at 0.05 V, this effect is interpreted in terms of faster water oxidation over MnOx/TiO2–TaON as compared to TiO2–TaON, consistent with the voltammetric studies (Fig. 4). At 0.65 and 1.05 V, differences in charge-transfer resistances probed by EIS for MnOx/TiO2–TaON and TiO2–TaON are reduced (Fig. S8†). This may be because, at these more positive potentials, the photocatalytic activity of TaON is less affected by the manganese oxide, at least under conditions examined.
Stability of the MnOx-modified TiO2–TaON photoanodes
Chronoamperometric experiments at a range of potentials were undertaken to examine stability of the TiO2–TaON anodes modified with MnOx during continuous water photooxidation. Photocurrents generated under 1 sun visible light irradiation at applied potentials of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.67 V by MnOx/TiO2–TaON films prepared under different conditions were considerably higher than those measured with TiO2–TaON (Fig. 6). These experiments confirmed reasonable stability of the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films produced using the photo-assisted method. The long-term performance of the samples obtained by electrodeposition under illumination was always better (low MnOx loadings, Edep = −0.2 and 0 V) or comparable (higher MnOx loadings, Edep = 0.7 V and Jdep = 250 μA cm−2) to that of the MnOx/TiO2–TaON catalysts produced under the same conditions but in the dark. On this basis, further discussion in this section focuses on the TiO2–TaON anodes modified with MnOxvia the photo-assisted approach.
 Fig. 6  Chronoamperograms obtained for MnOx/TiO2–TaON (i–iii) and TiO2–TaON (iv) at (A) 0.2, (B) 0.4, (C) 0.67 and (D) 1 V vs. Ag|AgCl under continuous visible light irradiation (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) in contact with aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6). MnOx was electrodeposited under illumination (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) for 1 min at Jdep = 250 μA cm−2 (i) or at Edep = 0.7 (ii) or −0.2 V (iii). Other conditions were as indicated in Fig. 2. 
The water oxidation photocurrent densities generated at 0.2 and 0.4 V by the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films prepared at constant Edep = −0.2 and 0.7 V degraded to some extent during initial periods of tests (5–10 min), but eventually attained a quasi-steady-state value, which was maintained for at least an hour (Fig. 6A and B). At 0.67 V, which corresponds to ca. −0.01 V overpotential for water oxidation at pH = 6, a quasi-stable performance was achieved for the MnOx/TiO2–TaON film obtained using Edep = 0.7 V but not for Edep = 0.2 V. The improved stability of the photoanodes modified with higher MnOx loadings may arise from more efficient scavenging of holes, whose generation is facilitated at more positive potentials. At the same time, continuous degradation was observed for the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films obtained using constant current deposition mode (Jdep = 250 μA cm−2) at all potentials examined in Fig. 6. The origin of this instability as opposed to the steady performance of MnOx/TiO2–TaON produced under constant potential deposition conditions is unclear, but it can be speculated that the MnOx deposits formed at variable deposition potential (see Fig. 1A) might be less robust than those produced at controlled Edep. The photocatalytic performance at 1 V for all MnOx/TiO2–TaON samples examined was very similar to that of the parent TiO2–TaON film (Fig. 6D and S9†) suggesting instability of the MnOx deposits at very positive potentials and comparatively low pH.
The SEM images of the films after chronoamperometric measurements (Fig. 7 and S10†) reveal that the MnOx fine structure is degraded and the material is transformed into coarser flakes when water photooxidation is undertaken at potentials more positive than ca. 0.4 V. Expectedly, structural degradation is most pronounced after measurements at 1 V (Fig. S10†). Undisputable SEM evidence for MnOx dissolution/redeposition after conditioning the electrodes at 1.0 V and pH = 6 was obtained for the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films prepared using dark electrodeposition. More MnOx was found on the TiO2–TaON surface after chronoamperometric tests at 1.0 V as compared to the initial films (cf. micrographs in Fig. 3(C, F and H) and Fig. S10†). These observations explain instability of the photocurrent generated by MnOx/TiO2–TaON anodes revealed by the voltammetric (Fig. 4) and chronoamperometric studies (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 7  SEM images of MnOx/TiO2–TaON after 60 min of chronoamperometric experiments at (i) 0.4, (ii) 0.67 and (iii) 1.0 V (vs. Ag|AgCl) under continuous visible light irradiation (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) in contact with aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6). MnOx was electrodeposited under illumination (1 sun, λ > 400 nm) for 1 min at Edep = −0.2 (A) or 0.7 V (B). Other conditions were as described in Fig. 2. 
Studies from many research groups confirm that the efficiency of manganese oxide catalysts for water electrooxidation is significantly enhanced on increasing the pH of the electrolyte solution.48,49 On this basis, we attempted to improve the stability and activity of the MnOx/TiO2–TaON photoanodes by undertaking chronoamperometric experiments using more alkaline buffered solutions (0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH = 7.0 and 0.1 M borate buffer, pH = 9.2) as well as 0.1 M Na2SO4 + NaOH solution with pH = 12. Indeed, there was some improvement in the photocatalytic performance of the films at potentials more positive than ca. 0.70 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) (corresponds to 0.15 V vs. Ag|AgCl at pH = 6) (Fig. S10†), but the effect was not as significant as would be expected for an ‘ordinary’ MnOx electrocatalyst.49
Under potentiostatic conditions at 1.55 V vs. RHE (1.0 V vs. Ag|AgCl at pH = 6), the highest enhancement achieved at pH = 12 was only 50% with respect to the photocurrent obtained in 0.1 M Na2SO4 at pH = 6 (Fig. S12†). Thus surprisingly, increasing the pH of the electrolyte solution above 9 (which is advocated as the lowest pH value needed for efficient water oxidation catalysis by MnOx)48 did not improve the performance of the MnOx/TiO2–TaON significantly. As a matter of fact, the slight improvement in the MnOx/TiO2–TaON performance provided by using buffered and more alkaline solutions shown in Fig. S11 and S12† is very similar to that reported previously for the MnOx-free TiO2–TaON photoanodes.26 Therefore, this effect can be again rationalised in terms of improved transfer of protons, which are known to block the catalytically active sites on the photoanode surface and might contribute to degradation of TaON.10,13,18,25,28,50–53 These findings suggest that the efficiency of MnOx/TiO2–TaON is still limited by the hole-electron pair generation and charge carrier transfer within TaON as well as through relevant interfaces (e.g. TaON|TiO2, TaON|MnOx or TiO2|MnOx), rather than by catalytic activity of MnOx for water oxidation.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
A parameter often employed to quantitatively describe performance of a photo-electrocatalyst is the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measured as a function of the monochromatic light wavelength and calculated as11,54  where 1239.8 (V nm) represents a multiplication of the Planck's constant and the speed of light, J (A cm−2) is the photocurrent density, Pmono (W cm−2) is the light divided by the electron charge intensity of monochromatic light, and λ (nm) is the wavelength of the monochromatic light.
To construct the IPCE plots for the MnOx/TiO2–TaON and unmodified TiO2–TaON films shown in Fig. 8, we used the oxidative photocurrent densities derived from comparatively slow voltammetric measurements (v = 0.005 V s−1) under chopped monochromatic light irradiation with λ varied in the range 410–530 nm (exemplified for λ = 410 nm in Fig. S13†). As expected, the sum of the photocurrent densities measured under monochromatic light irradiation within this range is consistent with the data obtained under non-filtered visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) within ca. 10–15% error.
 Fig. 8  (A) IPCE spectra obtained at defined potentials for MnOx/TiO2–TaON (Edep = 0.0 V) in contact with aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6). (B) IPCE values derived from voltammograms (v = 0.005 V s−1; Fig. S14†) obtained under chopped monochromatic light irradiation (λ = 410 nm) for (i) TiO2–TaON and (ii–v) MnOx/TiO2–TaON in contact with aqueous 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6). MnOx was electrodeposited for 1 min under illumination (1 sun; λ > 400 nm) at Edep = −0.2 (ii), 0 (iii) or 0.7 V (iv), or at Jdep = 250 μA cm−2 (v). Other conditions were as indicated in Fig. 2. 
Qualitatively, the IPCE profiles did not change noticeably upon introduction of MnOx on the photoanodes (Fig. 8A and S14†), confirming that TaON remains the light absorbing material. The highest IPCE values for all samples examined were obtained with the lowest monochromatic light irradiation wavelength of 410 nm, and are summarised as a function of applied potential for the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films prepared using the photo-assisted MnOx deposition in Fig. 8B. The most significant enhancement in IPCE is observed for the MnOx/TiO2–TaON photoanodes at potentials more negative than ca. 0.50 V, where up to an order of magnitude improvement in efficiency is achieved. At more positive potentials the effect of MnOx is less pronounced and IPCE values of 8–10% were measured at 1.05 V for all MnOx/TiO2–TaON samples examined, which can be compared to 4% found for the TiO2–TaON film.
Overall, IPCEs for the MnOx/TiO2–TaON films fabricated and studied in this work are notably lower than the efficiencies reported earlier for the TaON-based photoanodes modified with cobalt or iridium oxides.13,28 Presumably, this might be due to imperfect alignment of the valence band levels of the MnOx electrodeposits and TaON, since the valence bands of the two semiconductors seem to be positioned very closely.23,35,36 Therefore, the hole transport at the TaON–MnOx interface might be one of the factors limiting the performance of the photocatalysts under study.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that finely structured MnOx can be efficiently deposited on the TaON films (pre-modified with TiO2 for better stability) by using a photo-assisted electrodeposition method. Holes photogenerated in TaON under visible light irradiation readily oxidise dissolved Mn2+(aq) species to allow selective deposition of MnOx solids in the vicinity of the photocatalytically active sites, which is not possible when MnOx is electrodeposited in dark. This advantage of the photo-assisted deposition method is reflected in improved stability and activity of the resulting MnOx/TiO2–TaON anodes during water photooxidation under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) as compared to the films modified with manganese oxide in dark. A 7-fold enhancement in photocatalytic activity was achieved for the best performing MnOx/TiO2–TaON photoanode (Mn-loading ca. 0.8 wt%) when compared to the parent TiO2–TaON film in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6). The MnOx deposits on the TiO2–TaON surface, however, suffered structural degradation during long-term photocatalytic testing at potentials more positive than ca. 0.4 V vs. Ag|AgCl. Use of buffered and more alkaline electrolyte solutions affords slight improvements in the performance and stability of MnOx/TiO2–TaON, but not as significant as might be expected for a MnOx-based water eleoctroxidation catalyst. Overall, the improvement in the TaON water photooxidation activity was inferior to that achieved previously for the CoOx cocatalyst introduced by a different method.28
Nevertheless, an important outcome of this study is the further demonstration of the universality of the approach to enhance the water-oxidation activity of the TaON-based photoanodes via the introduction of transition metal oxide catalysts. Moreover, we anticipate that the photo-assisted catalyst electrodeposition method described in this work can offer more homogeneous coverage of the TaON surface with the oxide cocatalyst than possible with conventional chemical and electrochemical deposition methods. As demonstrated here and elsewhere,13,28 intimate contact between tantalum oxynitride and metal oxide particles is critical to sustain efficient transport of photogenerated holes, and ultimately determines the activity and stability of the photoanode.
