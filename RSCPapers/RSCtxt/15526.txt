In the present study, the basic concepts and principles of photocatalytic water splitting have been discussed, and a guide for the selection of appropriate photocatalysts, focusing on the g-C3N4 nanomaterials, has been proposed. Our approach is mainly concentrated on evaluating two factors, namely the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion and apparent quantum yield (AQY) for different photocatalysts, to provide an in-depth analysis and a framework for solar H2 production for future research directions. We compared hydrogen production from an economic viewpoint and performance of g-C3N4 nanomaterials through photochemical (PC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) methods. Various approaches for efficient solar H2 generation over a modified g-C3N4 surface with the possibility for commercialization have been introduced. The promising approaches for the effective utilization of g-C3N4 are categorized into three proposed methods: electronic structure tuning, hybrid and nanocomposite fabrication, and finally geometric structure manipulation. Finally, we compared the recent findings and key achievements for g-C3N4-based photocatalysts modified based on the abovementioned three approaches to propose two possible scenarios for their use in the future development of efficient solar H2 generation.Amene NaseriAmene Naseri is currently a Ph.D. candidate of nanochemistry at Institute for Nanoscience & Nanotechnology (INST) of Sharif University of Technology (SUT), Iran.

1. Introduction
Energy crisis due to both population growth and industrial development has been a big challenge in recent decades. The availability of the fossil fuel resources is limited day by day, and, in addition, CO2 emissions and the greenhouse effect as a result of the combustion are becoming a global concern.1 Based on a recent report, oil is still the global primary fuel, accounting for 32.9% of the world's energy consumption, followed by coal (29.2%) and natural gas (23.8%) in 2015.2 To address these issues, renewable energy sources have been successfully applied as an effective alternative. Explosive and policy-driven growth in wind and solar energy has resulted in the global emission slowdown.3 According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy in 2016, renewable energies supplied about 6.7% of the global power generation.2 Among several energy sources, including hydroelectricity, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy, natural sunlight is the most available and environmentally friendly energy resource. Therefore, the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy can be a worthwhile approach to solve or mitigate the future energy crisis and environmental pollutions. Furthermore, when hydrogen gas is applied as a fuel, water or water vapour is produced as the only exhaust through burning with oxygen; therefore, it does not result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other air pollution issues caused by fossil fuel combustion. Consequently, the generation of H2 gas as an energy carrier by solar light irradiation can help meet the future energy challenges and address the environmental problems, effectively.
Hydrogen has a higher energy content (120–142 MJ kg−1) in comparison with hydrocarbon fuels and it is predicted that it will be the major source of energy generation (90%) up to 2080.4 Currently, more than 44.5 million tons of hydrogen are produced annually worldwide.5 Therefore, technological developments should open up effective approaches for the hydrogen production process, delivery, storage, conversion and applications.4 Currently, inexpensive and environmentally benign techniques for H2 generation are an interesting and attractive field of research.6,7Table 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the most common different current methods for H2 gas production, including steam methane reforming, coal and other hydrocarbons gasification, water electrolysis, wind-powered hydrogen production, biological conversion and photocatalytic water splitting. Although, steam methane reforming is currently applied to produce 95% of global hydrogen,7 photocatalytic water splitting is the most promising and renewable approach among all the hydrogen production technologies.8–10 Furthermore, technological mapping analysis predicts that the hydrogen production cost would be approximately US$1.60–10.40 kg−1 using photocatalytic water splitting, which demonstrates the potential to meet the target hydrogen price of $2.00–4.00 kg−1 set by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) by 2020.10 Therefore, according to the published technology development timelines, this method is suitable for semi-central and central hydrogen production and offers a long-term strategy towards the commercialization stage.11–13 In addition, this process occurred under ambient conditions and only water is required as a renewable and carbon-free resource.6 Consequently, photocatalytic water splitting based on both semiconductors and sunlight irradiation is considered a clean technology for solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion.8–10,14 STH is a useful parameter to evaluate the material efficiency and performance in water splitting and can be described as follows:15 (1)

The other parameter that can be applied to compare the photocatalyst performance is the apparent quantum efficiency (AQY), which is defined as:15 (2)where n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction (n = 2 for photocatalytic hydrogen production), R is the production rate of H2 and I is the rate of incident photons.
Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanomaterials have been considered as a metal-free photocatalyst, containing the earth-abundant elements of C, N and H.20 The other advantages result in the potential for commercialization.21 In this review, we mainly focus on the barriers and obstacles for the efficient development and commercial utilization of g-C3N4 nanomaterials for hydrogen production through the direct splitting of water, which is not well covered in recent works. Overall, to analyse the capability of the catalyst development for possible future commercialization, two key aspects, namely the catalyst and process design, should be investigated.22 Since, reactor engineering and modelling in the field of process design are beyond the scope of the present review, the interested reader is referred to the other complete articles in the literature23,24 while we review different aspects of photocatalyst design, here. In the photocatalyst design section, the stability, cost, availability, activity, selectivity, deactivation and regeneration of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are studied and evaluated. Furthermore, photocatalytic water splitting using the photochemical (PC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) methods are compared from a technical and economic viewpoint. In this context, the preparation methods for the PC and PEC g-C3N4 samples were analyzed and the challenges highlighted for the first time. Moreover, some directions for future research and development to obtain effective g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, including electronic and geometric structural manipulation or nanocomposites fabrication were considered. In this context, we divided these approaches into the categories of doping (electronic structure tuning), nanocompositing and morphology design (geometric structuring) to consolidate and discuss the recent developments. Doping with non-metals and metals, compositing with various ranges of materials and morphology design are comprehensively reviewed and the relevant data tabulated for a more convenient comparison. Therefore, we hope that this review will provide a comprehensive and state-of-the-art review on g-C3N4-based photocatalyst from a broad perspective and further we propose useful guidelines for future research directions in this field.
2. Photocatalytic water splitting
For photocatalytic water splitting, photochemical (PC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells are applied to produce H2 and O2 (Fig. 1a and b).15,25–29 H2 generation from water splitting is a thermodynamically uphill reaction, with a standard Gibbs free energy of +237.2 kJ mol−1 (eqn (3)). For photocatalytic H2 generation, there are three steps (Fig. 1c): (1) electron–hole pairs are generated through light absorption with energy equal to or higher than the bandgap energy of the semiconductor; (2) charge carriers migrate to the surface of the semiconductor or recombine in the bulk; (3) photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor can produce H2 (eqn (4)), while the remaining holes in the valence band (VB) can oxidize water to O2 (eqn (5)).30 2H2O + 4hv → 2H2 + O2, ΔG0 = +237.2 kJ mol−1(3) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2, E0 = 0 V vs. NHE(4) H2O + 2h+ → O2 + 2H+ + 4e−, E0 = 1.23 V vs. NHE(5)

The prerequisite for the initiation of photocatalytic reactions (eqn (1) and (2)) is that the potential of the highest level of the photocatalyst VB should be more positive than 1.23 V vs. NHE; while the potential of the lowest level of the photocatalyst CB should be more negative than 0 V vs. NHE. Fig. 2 shows the bandgaps and the VB and CB positions of the selected oxides, nitrides and chalcogenides semiconductor photocatalysts, which are appropriate for hydrogen or/and oxygen generation.32 TiO2 and ZnO nanomaterials are the most employed photocatalysts,33–41 but their wide bandgaps lead to them being inefficient in sunlight, because only 9.3% of solar irradiation contains ultraviolet radiation, which is capable of producing charge carriers in these materials. As the major portion of the solar energy spectrum (54.1%) is in the visible region, therefore applying a visible-light-active photocatalyst would promote the STH efficiency and increase the hydrogen production rate.42 Although, different strategies, including surface modification and bandgap engineering, have been employed towards the preparation of visible-light-active TiO2 and ZnO and many achievements have been obtained, more efforts should be made to further improving the efficiency.43,44 Currently, numerous research studies have been undertaken employing semiconductors with bandgap energies suitable for visible light absorption of the solar spectrum for photocatalytic water splitting. Recently, graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, with a bandgap energy of 2.7 eV and visible-light photocatalytic activity has been considered to be a promising candidate for photocatalytic water splitting.45–47

3. g-C3N4-based photocatalysts
Carbon nitride exists in several allotropes, namely, α-C3N4, β-C3N4, graphitic-C3N4, cubic-C3N4 and pseudo-cubic-C3N4, with various properties, but the graphitic phase (g-C3N4) is the most stable under ambient conditions.48 g-C3N4 is a conjugated polymeric system, which is constructed from s-triazine or tri-s-triazine units interconnected via tertiary amines (Fig. 3a).48 The atoms in the layers are arranged in honeycomb configurations with strong covalent bonds, and the force between the two-dimensional (2D) sheets is the weak van der Waals force. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the VB edge of g-C3N4 was mainly composed of the N 2p state, while the CB edge consisted of the hybridization of the N 2p and C 2p states (Fig. 3b).49 Therefore, photogenerated holes appear at the N sites. Due to the hybridization of the N 2p and C 2p states in CB, the photogenerated electrons suffer from the high recombination of electron–hole pairs, which deteriorates the photocatalytic performance.

Different carbon- and nitrogen-rich precursors (such as melamine, cyanamide, dicyandiamide) have been used for the synthesis of g-C3N4,50,51 through a process of integration of thermal polyaddition and polycondensation (Fig. 3c). As shown in the thermal condensation pathway of the precursors in Fig. 3a, the heating of cyanamide leads to formation of dicyandiamide. Then, the cyclization of either cyanamide or dicyandiamide produces melamine through condensation (which can also be obtained from urea). Melamine dimerizes to form melam, and both can rearrange to melem. With further heating, the condensation of melem occurs, resulting in forming one-dimensional (1D) chains of amine-linked heptazine units called Liebig's melon.52 Melem condenses to form polymers, networks and the final polymeric C3N4 at about 520 °C.53 Melamine-based products are usually formed above 350 °C, while the tri-s-triazine products are produced from rearrangements of melamine at about 390 °C.53 In contract to ordinary organic precursors, Yang et al. used a mixture of nucleobases and urea to prepare the layered carbon nitrides for HER.54 Different nucleobases, including adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), thymine (T) and uracil (U), have been used to synthesize the carbon nitrides. Over theses samples, the HER rate was enhanced by a factor of 6–8 times in comparison with urea-derived g-CN. The optimized sample of carbon nitride material condensed from urea and cytosine showed a rate of 282 μmol h−1 with an AQY of 7.1%.
It should be noted that over a fully condensed g-C3N4 with improved crystallinity and conjugated subunits, the photocatalytic activity would be enhanced due to the minimum number of defects as recombination centres.55 Bulk g-C3N4 prepared from the thermal treatment of nitrogen-containing precursors suffers from low crystallinity and a moderate photocatalytic activity. This can arise as a result of kinetic problems that may occur during thermal polycondensation of the precursors, which cause their incomplete deamination and the formation of the tri-s-triazine-based melon structure. As shown in Fig. 3a, melon ([C6N7(NH2)(NH)]n) consists of sheets of in-plane infinite 1D chains of NH-bridged melem (C6N7(NH2)3) monomers connected via hydrogen bonds.56 These hydrogen bonds could cause low conductivity owing to the blocking electron conductivity of the plane.
For the synthesis of crystalline g-C3N4, Lin et al. annealed a mixture of preheated melamine and salts (KCl and LiCl) under a N2 atmosphere, in a method they called the ionothermal or salt melt method.55 Under this method the prepared sample was tri-s-triazine-based crystalline g-C3N4 (as shown in Fig. 3a) with high stability and also high photocatalytic activity for H2 and O2 generation under sunlight irradiation. This method has been used to prepare crystalline and condensed g-C3N4, made up of layers of s-heptazine (C6N7) units, from dicyandiamide.57
Due to the incomplete thermal polymerization, g-CN nanosheets suffer from low crystallinity, which results in the formation of plentiful intralayer hydrogen bonds. Owing to these bonds, the photogenerated charge carriers are highly localized additionally within each melon strand and their intralayer transport is poor.58 For solving this problem, 2D crystalline carbon nitride was prepared through sonication of the bulk tri-s-triazine-based crystalline carbon nitride in IPA.58 Remarkably, these tri-s-triazine-based carbon nitride nanosheets crystals revealed a H2 generation rate of 53 μmol h−1 (50 mg catalyst) in the presence of methanol, with an AQY of 8.57% at 420 nm. Over this photocatalyst, hydrogen evolution under visible light was enhanced in comparison with the rate over g-C3N4, PTI/Li+Cl− and also bulk tri-s-tri-azine-based crystalline carbon nitrides.58
The first report for photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light was in 2009 by Wang et al.48 The metal-free chemical nature, high thermal stability (up to 600 °C in air) and chemical stability (in acid, base and organic solvents), tunable electronic structure, abundance and cheapness as well as the appropriate position of the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band for photocatalytic water splitting have made g-C3N4 become more considered for the development of “green photocatalysis” than other visible-light-active semiconductors, such as CdS, Fe2O3, WO3 and BiVO4.10,59,60 Consequently, there are a number of high-quality reviews in the literature on the g-C3N4 preparation methods,47,61–64 the optical properties and electronic structure65–68 and modification strategies, such as nanocompositing and doping,46,64,67,69–75 as well as photocatalytic applications,45,65,76 including the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to renewable hydrocarbon fuel nanomaterials,46,77,78 the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, bacteria disinfection46,79–81 and photocatalytic water splitting.64,82–85
Despite the significant advantages of g-C3N4, the obstacles to commercialization and its wider usage as an efficient photocatalyst are limited by the fast recombination of charge carriers, its limited absorbance of the sunlight spectrum, low surface area (10–15 m2 g−1) and also the existence of grain boundaries.86 There are some review publications addressing different aspects of g-C3N4 for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. In 2014, Cao and Yu offered a perspective article to summarize the experimental progress, such as nanostructure design, bandgap engineering, dye sensitization and heterojunction construction for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.82 Zhang et al. reviewed the effects of the surface engineering of g-C3N4 using noble and transition metals, as well as carbon-based materials as co-catalysts.85 In another insightful review, Wang's group categorized the strategies for efficient solar water splitting into interfacial engineering, nanostructural control, doping and defect engineering.84 They mainly discussed the recent progress and improvements made in the interfacial engineering and nanostructural control of g-C3N4 to promote photogenerated charge carriers separation and transfer for higher efficiency. Another tutorial review by Xu et al. presented an accurate overview of metal-free carbonaceous electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for water splitting, including, g-C3N4 hybrids, graphene and CNTs composites, as well as microporous polymers and boron carbide.83 In addition, Parida's group provided a detailed discussion on the synthesis of different g-C3N4 nanomaterials, morphological characterizations and optical and electronic properties, as well as that of neat, doped and decorated g-C3N4 photocatalytic hydrogen production.64 However, herein, we present a discussion comparing H2 production via using PEC and PC approaches. Moreover, the possible commercialization of the g-C3N4 photocatalyst is discussed from an economic viewpoint for the first time.
4. Commercialization potential of g-C3N4 photocatalyst for solar H2 production
Technical and economic feasibility studies have been carried out comparing hydrogen production using PC and PEC water splitting methods.8 Investigations predicted that the cost of hydrogen generated would be approximately US$4.10–10.40 and $1.60–3.20 per kg H2 using the PEC and PC methods, respectively. Therefore, the PC method and particulate photocatalytic systems might be more promising for future hydrogen generation, since this method has shown it can meet the target hydrogen price of $2.00–4.00 kg−1 as targeted by the DOE until 2020.8,10 Apart from the economical point of view, for PEC water splitting, the fabrication of a photoanode and/or photocathode is required.15,27 As most of the synthesis methods of g-C3N4 produce the powder form, an additional step is needed for the deposition on an electrode to fabricate the photoanode and/or photocathode. Our review of the literature indicates that different approaches for the deposition of a g-C3N4 suspension have been applied, such as the electrophoretic process,87,88 dipping process,89 drop-casting method,90 doctors' blade technique,91,92 impregnation and post annealing.93,94 In addition, to fabricate a g-C3N4 thin film directly on a substrate, thermal vapour liquid-polymerization95–98 and immersion of the substrate in g-C3N4 precursors such as urea, cyanamide, dicyandiamide or melamine and post annealing99–101 have been applied. Although these methods have been used for electrode fabrication, there are some drawbacks and problems, such as low repeatability and accuracy. In addition, the control of the amount of different weight ratios in the composite fabrication is poor and the loading amount has to be calculated for each sample. To combat these problems, Hou et al. fabricated a free-standing electrode using 3D graphene aerogels, which demonstrated high performance characteristics.102 However, maintaining the long-term mechanical properties as an electrode still need to be evaluated. Accordingly, the fabrication of an electrode based on g-C3N4 is not a straightforward or simple task. Consequently, based on the economic analysis and fabrication challenges, it seems that the PC method would be more promising for the future development of g-C3N4 nanomaterials for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Therefore, our main focus herein is on the PC method as a facile and inexpensive method.
Generally, to develop a catalyst for commercial usage, the stability, cost, availability, activity, selectivity, deactivation and regeneration should be analyzed and evaluated.22 To derive these parameters for the g-C3N4 photocatalyst, in the following, we deliberate its performance based on the different specifications needed for possible future work (Fig. 4). Up to date, the high thermal and chemical stability of g-C3N4 have been proven. Certainly, the long-term stability should be evaluated and monitored over the consecutive use in photocatalytic hydrogen generation. In addition, the preparation methods of g-C3N4 are categorized into top-down and bottom-up approaches.46,63,67 In the more popular top-down method usually urea, thiourea and cyanamide are applied, which are abundant and cheap precursor chemicals. Also, the thermal condensation method is employed to convert these precursors into pure g-C3N4, which is a convenient and scalable approach. Furthermore, there are three main approaches for the composite preparation. One method is the mechanical mixing of g-C3N4 with the other components, which represents a simple method. The other versatile and effective approaches involve an in situ synthesis strategy, including the growth of g-C3N4 precursors in the presence of the other components103 or the growth of other component precursors in the presence of g-C3N4.104,105 Accordingly, it is predicted that the stability, cost and availability are no longer a barrier to commercialization. Although, different studies have confirmed the long-lasting photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4,48,106,107 more investigations should be carried out to elucidate the deactivation behaviour over several years. Hence, the main challenge now is to evaluate the activity and selectivity.

Strategic roadmap planning deliberates how photocatalytic water splitting can be a key strategy for hydrogen production between 2030 and 2040.4,108 However, this estimation is based on an STH conversion efficiency of 10% in the photocatalytic system, which is far from the recent values. Fig. 5 shows the relation between the calculated STH efficiency as a function of wavelength for photocatalysts with different quantum efficiencies.10,109 This figure shows that a photocatalyst with an absorption edge around 500 nm and lower amounts has no capability to achieve a STH value of 10%. Also, photocatalysts with an absorption edge longer than 600 nm can provide the STH value of 10% with a 60% apparent quantum yield (AQY).

According to the published reports, the absorption edge of pure g-C3N4 is around 460 nm;107,110,111 therefore, it cannot meet the target value to be considered promising for future photocatalytic hydrogen production. Therefore, bandgap engineering through a doping approach can be encouraging to meet the STH value of 10%. Furthermore, the decoration of g-C3N4 nanomaterials with metallic nanoparticles and plasmonic properties could hopefully modify the absorption edge to be higher than the 460 nm target value. Also, coupling g-C3N4 with the other semiconductors possessing an appropriate bandgap, such as MoS2, WS2, and quantum dots (QDs), is another possible approach to reduce the bandgap value. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, AQY is the other important parameter to consider to determine the hydrogen efficiency of nanomaterials. In this context, g-C3N4 demonstrated a low AQY, due to the high recombination rate of the photogenerated electrons. Therefore, coupling the g-C3N4 with highly efficient semiconductors, such as TiO2 and ZnO, can be a practical tool. In addition, the morphology tuning of g-C3N4 nanomaterials can provide more accessible sites for chemical reactions in photocatalytic hydrogen production, which can enhance the AQY. In the following section, all these three approaches will be discussed separately.
4.1. Doping with non-metals and metals
There are several parameters that affect the activity of a semiconductor photocatalyst, including the range of wavelength absorbance, electron and hole mobility, and the redox potential.112 g-C3N4 has some drawbacks, such as insufficient sunlight absorption, high exciton binding energy and low carrier mobility.113,114 Doping with non-metals, such as sulfur (S), can modify the texture, and optical and electronic properties as well as improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4.114 It is well established that the doping of metals and non-metals into the semiconductor structure can tune the spectral range of light absorption as a result of the: (1) generation of localized energy levels; (2) elevation of the VB maximum and (3) lowering of the CB minimum.44Fig. 6 shows the carbon atom in the tri-s-triazine ring and nitrogen atoms in the ring and bridge of the g-C3N4 structure as possible substitution sites for non-metal doping. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, the VB edge of g-C3N4 is mainly composed of the N 2p state, while the CB edge consists of the hybridization of the N 2p and C 2p states; therefore, depending on the substitution position, the characteristics of the CB and/or VB can be manipulated. Hence, bandgap engineering through doping facilitates STH and AQY tuning towards the desire amounts.

Non-metal doping extends the absorption edge to longer wavelengths due to the generation of localized energy levels and via elevation of the VB maximum, which enhances the solar light harvesting capabilities. Also, the hole mobility depends on the VB width directly, and a higher VB width results in hole mobility enhancement and a photo-oxidation ability.112 Furthermore, the electronegativity of non-metal dopants must be lower than that of the substituted atom so that the dopant states can contribute to the formation of a wider VB by locating at its top.115 In this context, Ma et al. observed that the bandgap energy of g-C3N4 was reduced with non-metals (sulfur and phosphor) doping.116 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the bandgap energy of g-C3N4 was reduced as a result of its doping with non-metal impurities like S and P.116 They concluded that non-metal doping could enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 by: (1) facilitating the visible light absorption, which in the case of S and P dopants altered the connectivity pattern and topology of the resultant g-C3N4 polymer due to their big atomic size; (2) modifying the carrier mobility as a result of increased dispersion of the counter distribution of the HOMO and LUMO and (3) separating electron–hole pairs due to non-coplanar HOMO and LUMO.116
In another report, S-doped g-C3N4 (C3N4−xSx) was prepared by Liu et al., where the N atoms were replaced with S2− in the g-C3N4 structure (Fig. 7a).112 The energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in C3N4 and C3N4−xSx are shown in Fig. 7b. In addition, the presence of sulfur in the C3N4−xSx sample was clearly evidenced, which was confirmed by XANES spectroscopy. The photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate was measured and C3N4−xSx demonstrated an enhancement in comparison to the pure g-C3N4 samples. The projected density of states (DOSs) of nitrogen and carbon in Fig. 7c show that the S-doping narrows the bandgap and increases the VB width of g-C3N4 due to the interaction of the S 3p and N 2p states. In contrast, their experimental results demonstrate the bandgap widening in the C3N4−xSx samples. They attributed this observation to the quantum confinement effect (QCE), which causes the bandgap to increase due to an opposite shifting of the VB maximum and CB minimum (Fig. 7d).112,117 This shift can provide photogenerated electrons with more photoreduction ability.

Using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional method, Liu et al. showed that P-doping enhanced the optical absorption intensity of g-C3N4, greatly.118 Also, Ding et al. demonstrated that F or B-monodoping and B/F-co-doping could improve the ability of the visible light absorption and enhance the migration rate of photogenerated charge carriers in g-C3N4.119 In their systems, the band edge positions indicated that B-doping enhanced the reductive ability, while F-doping and B/F-co-doping increased the oxidation ability. By doping halide ions, the band structure of g-C3N4 could also be optimized. In this context, Zhang et al. showed that g-C3N4 doped with these anions absorbed light with a wavelength under 420 nm and also had an enhanced hydrogen generation rate.120 Among the halide ions, only the I dopant showed a significant red-shift in light absorption due to the effective extension of the aromatic carbon nitride heterocycle by doping.120 Furthermore, the I anion generated impurity states above the VB maximum and narrowed the bandgap. As a result, the I dopant has the most effective role on the photocatalytic activity of polymeric carbon nitride. In other work, Br-doping was also used to improve the activity of g-C3N4 in hydrogen generation.113
For metal doping in g-C3N4, the porous structure of heptazine and electron-rich sp2 nitrogen can provide a metal coordination site, whereby the doped metals bond with the three adjacent N atoms.121,122 Recently, Fe-,121 Na-123 and Li-doping122 of g-C3N4 have been reported. The DFT calculations demonstrated that the metal cannot generate an impurity state in the bandgap of g-C3N4, but, they could enhance the CB and VB hybridization.122 The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity through metal doping was attributed to the fact that the metal can act as an electron- and hole-trapping site, which causes an increase in the interfacial charge migration rate and efficient electron–hole separation for photocatalytic activity.121,123 Therefore, the role of metal doping is different from non-metal doping, in which the metals can play the role of electron sinks for the retardation of electron–hole recombination. While, in S- and P-doping, as with most non-metal dopants, due to the hybridization of the S 3p and P 3p orbitals of the dopants with the C 2p, N 2p of g-C3N4 CB, downshifts of the CB edge occur and the bandgap decreases for increased light absorption.116
Metal components could bind to the matrix of graphitic carbon nitride via weak ligation, forming organic–metal hybrid materials. 3d-block transition metal embedded g-C3N4 showed an efficient photoabsorption capacity due to the prominent absorption at low energy, which made such a material a good candidate for photocatalytic activity.124 Fe3+ ions embedding in the g-C3N4 framework could modify its electronic properties.125 Gao et al. synthesized Fe-doped g-C3N4, and the proposed growth mechanism of Fe-g-CN is shown here in Fig. 8a.126 As depicted in the figure, the polymer-like structures were expected to pre-organize and then experienced polycondensation to produce Fe-g-CN. The TEM image and corresponding EDX-elemental mapping images for C, N, O and Fe are shown in Fig. 8b, which confirms the uniform dispersion of C, N, O and Fe throughout the sample. The XPS core level peak in Fig. 8c, shows the Fe 2p3/2 at 710.5 and 715.3 eV and Fe 2p1/2 at 723.9 eV, which are three characteristic peaks of Fe 2p in the Fe-g-CN sample. The sample demonstrated a hydrogen generation rate of about ∼16.2 mmol g−1 h−1 (Fig. 8f) and a quantum efficiency of 0.8%. The efficient visible light-driven hydrogen generation was attributed to facilitated electron transfer in this photocatalytic system due to the strong electron coupling between the metal dopant and the planar delocalized electrons of g-C3N4 and also due to the unique electronic structure of the 2D nanomaterial.126

4.2. g-C3N4 hybrids and nanocomposites

4.2.1. Metal decoration. 
The decoration of metal nanoparticles on 2D g-C3N4 can implement a dual role for the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen production: one is the role as a co-catalyst to promote the rate of the water half-splitting reactions (water reduction and oxidation) in the presence of sacrificial reagents, like methanol and triethanolamine (TEA), while the other is to allow utilization of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect for broad-spectrum photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and efficient solar light harvesting.127,128 The region of visible light absorption by the SPR effect depends on the size, shape and surroundings of the nanoparticles.129 Therefore, metal decoration can tune the STH and AQY, concurrently. Different metals, including Pt,130 Au,131 Ag,132 Ni133 and Rh,134 have been used as a co-catalyst for enhanced hydrogen evolution over g-C3N4 through water splitting.
Despite the advantage of metal decoration on the g-C3N4 nanomaterials, old-style chemical reduction of the metal salt to produce the nanoparticles cannot fully amplify their activity, because, during this process, the agglomeration and stacking of the g-C3N4 nanomaterials occur, which reduce the surface area and photocatalytic activity efficiency. To solve this drawback, Zhang et al. examined different precursors for the synthesis of g-C3N4, and among these, urea-derived g-C3N4, prepared at 550 °C, showed a silk-like thin nanosheets structure.135 This structure with 3 wt% photodeposited Pt showed an improved rate of hydrogen production in comparison with other samples containing more or less Pt. Also, due to the presence of PtOx, there was no need to apply a sacrificial reagent for water oxidation. The reason for this observation was the nanosheet structure of g-C3N4 and also, the presence of uniformly dispersed Pt nanoparticles. Furthermore, the formation of an efficient metal/g-C3N4 junction enhanced the interfacial redox reaction, which was confirmed by a significant decrease in the PL intensity.135
A Ag QDs/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was prepared in a one-step process, which involved annealing of the urea and AgNO3 as g-C3N4 and the Ag QDs precursors, respectively.132 When 0.5 wt% Ag QDs was added to g-C3N4, the hydrogen generation rate under visible light was increased 4.6 times. The Schottky barrier formed at the interface of Ag and g-C3N4 could play the role of a diode for charge rectification. As a result, the electrons trapped by Ag QDs could reduce H+ to H2. This enhanced charge separation resulted in the observed enhanced hydrogen evolution rate. In another report, 1 wt% Au was loaded on g-C3N4 and a photocatalyst with the SPR effect was generated, which showed a hydrogen generation rate 23 times higher than neat g-C3N4.136 The absorption spectra of the pure g-C3N4 and Au/g-C3N4 samples are shown in Fig. 9a. The deposition of Au nanoparticles showed enhanced visible light absorption and a characteristic peak at 550 nm belonging to the plasmonic effect of Au nanoparticles. Also, there was a red-shift in the absorbance edge of Au/g-C3N4 in comparison with g-C3N4. The bandgap energy of 1 wt% Au/g-C3N4 was 2.37 eV, which was lower than the pure g-C3N4 (2.71 eV). Higher visible-light absorption by Au nanoparticles due to the SPR effect and improved charge carrier separation resulted in an improved photocatalytic activity of the Au/g-C3N4 plasmonic photocatalyst.136 Apart from the SPR effect of Au nanoparticles, the heterojunction between the gold nanoparticles and g-C3N4 can act as an electron collector, and retard photogenerated electron and hole recombination as well as efficiently promote photocatalytic hydrogen generation under visible light.137 Surface modification with a bimetallic co-catalyst is an effective approach to enhance the photocatalytic activity. For example, Fig. 9b compares the H2 evolution rate over g-C3N4 decorated with different bimetallic samples.137 In these samples, one metal can towards efficient electron transfer, while the other enhances the chemical reactivity, therefore, the synergistic effect can enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Nickle is a non-expensive and earth-abundant non-noble metal, so it can be a most promising co-catalyst. Bi et al. prepared Ni-decorated porous C3N4 nanocomposites, in which C3N4 was polymerized from the complexes of cyanuric acid and melamine.133 An optimized sample of 10% Ni produced H2 with a rate of 313.2 μmol h−1 g−1, which was much higher than that of pure porous C3N4. The trapping of photogenerated electrons by Ni led to an improved charge separation and photocatalytic activity.


4.2.2. TiO2. 
The g-C3N4/TiO2 composite can form a type-II heterostructure in which the photogenerated electrons–holes are effectively separated (Fig. 10a). In this composite under irradiation, holes have a tendency to transfer from the VB of TiO2 to the VB of g-C3N4, while the electrons transfer from the CB of g-C3N4 to that of TiO2. This results in a prolonged charge carrier lifetime and improved photocatalytic activity.92 For example, Fig. 10a shows the schematic of the charge transfer between the ternary heterostructure of the g-C3N4/amorphous TiO2/crystalline TiO2 (g-C3N4/a-TiO2/c-TiO2), which shows an effective interfacial electron transfer in junction, which results in the improved photoactivity.92 The photogenerated electrons of g-C3N4 can pass easily to the CB of TiO2, because the CB maximum of g-C3N4 is more negative (−1.23 eV) than that of both c-TiO2 (−0.30 eV) and a-TiO2 (−0.5 eV). The direct migration of CB electrons of g-C3N4 to c-TiO2 through a-TiO2 occurs due to the close interfacial connections between a-TiO2/c-TiO2 and g-C3N4, which results in an efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers.92

Apart from the formation of a type-II heterostructure in g-C3N4/TiO2 composites, the direct Z-scheme-type mechanism can occur between g-C3N4 and TiO2 to enhance the photocatalytic activity.138,140–143 Liu et al. used a hybrid DFT method to investigate the electronic structure, interfacial interaction and photogenerated carrier separation in a monolayer g-C3N4/TiO2 heterojunction.138 The results indicated a weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction between g-C3N4 and TiO2 with a staggered band alignment structure. As indicated in Fig. 10b, the results showed that the photoexcited electrons and holes were gathered in the CB of g-C3N4 and VB of TiO2, respectively, which represents the Z-scheme mechanism. This mechanism enhances the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and increases the AQY. Some different composites based on combining g-C3N4 and TiO2 for hydrogen generation via water splitting are summarized in Table 2.

Zhang et al. prepared a 3D g-C3N4/TiO2 nanotube array (TNAs) nanocomposite by an electro-deposition process.144 They used g-C3N4 QDs due to their shorter migration distance of photogenerated charge carriers and strong quantum confinement effect. Their UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra showed that this composite could be a visible-light-active photocatalyst. The hydrogen generation rate over this composite was 243 μmol h−1 g−1, which was 4.7 times higher than that of g-C3N4 alone. This was as a result of the synergistic effect of g-C3N4 QDs and TNAs. In another report, Su et al. combined g-C3N4 QDs with TiO2 TNAs and the results showed that the photogenerated electron–hole pairs could be separated and transferred effectively for improved photoelectrochemical activity and conversion efficiency under simulated solar light irradiation.147
A TiO2–In2O3@g-C3N4 hybrid material was used for enhanced hydrogen evolution and RhB degradation.149 The g-C3N4 was applied as a support material for immobilizing TiO2 and In2O3 nanoparticles. In this ternary composite, photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 and CB of In2O3 transferred to the CB of TiO2. Then, the remaining holes in the VB of TiO2 and VB of In2O3 transferred to the VB of g-C3N4 and, as a result, efficient charge carrier separation occurred. Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectroscopy showed that TiO2@g-C3N4 and TiO2–In2O3@g-C3N4 had slower decay kinetics for photogenerated charge carriers as compared to pure g-C3N4. An increased PL lifetime due to the improved electron transport and/or changes in the electronic band structure induced by QCE represented the slower recombination rate of the photoinduced charge carriers and consequently the improved photocatalytic activity.149
Doping of the TiO2 nanomaterials to enhance the light absorption ability in combination with visible-light-active g-C3N4 could be more promising for solar light harvesting and for increasing the STH. In this context, g-C3N4/N-doped TiO2 hybrid nanofibres were prepared by electrospinning in combination with a modified heat-etching method.139 The TEM image of nanofibres in the inset of Fig. 10c show the presence of g-C3N4 nanoflakes in the TiO2 nanofibres. The prepared hybrid nanofibres had a large specific surface area. In addition, due to the synergistic effect of the presence of N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and g-C3N4 nanosheets, the nanofibres exhibited an improved photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen generation and dye degradation under sunlight irradiation, as shown in Fig. 10c. N- and S-doped TiO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were prepared through a thermal-induced polymerization method by means of thiourea and TiOSO4·xH2O with a high wt% of thiourea (10 wt%) relative to the Ti precursor.150 In this system, the synergistic effect of the junction between g-C3N4 and N,S-TiO2, bandgap narrowing of TiO2 by doping, the small crystallite size, low charge carrier recombination rate, and co-catalyst features of incorporated sulfate made the material suitable for hydrogen generation. C,N-TiO2 NPs/porous g-C3N4 composites showed a better hydrogen generation rate in comparison with single C,N-TiO2 NPs and pure g-C3N4 nanosheets.151 The optimized sample with 3 wt% C,N co-doped TiO2 NPs showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 39.18 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation.
In the other report, Jiang et al. prepared C/N co-doped TiO2 modified with Ag and a g-C3N4 (Ag/CN-TiO2@g-C3N4) photocatalyst and investigated the hydrogen generation and found the degradation of RhB under visible light was enhanced.153 The results showed an enhancement in the photocatalytic activity due to the: (1) high specific surface area of the prepared sample and also its high ability for light harvesting, (2) efficient separation of electron–hole pairs through the heterojunction, and (3) amplified visible light absorption as a result of the SPR effect of Ag nanoparticles.


4.2.3. Other metal oxides. 
Apart from TiO2, ZnO nanomaterials are promising for photocatalytic applications. Different studies have been conducted to prepare the g-C3N4/ZnO hybrids with enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production.154,155 According to the published reports, the modification of ZnO with g-C3N4 nanomaterials would be more effective for photocatalysis. For example, a coating of g-C3N4 nanosheets on the oxygen-defective ZnO nanorods with a core–shell structure (g-C3N4/OD–ZnO),155 the decoration of g-C3N4 on the surface of ZnO nanowire (g-C3N4/Pt/ZnO)154 and N-doped ZnO/g-C3N4156 have been reported. The prepared g-C3N4/Pt/ZnO photoanode generated a photocurrent density of 120 μA cm−2 at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 0.5 M solution of Na2SO4, which was 9 times higher than that of the ZnO. The mechanism of photocatalytic hydrogen production under simulated solar radiation (AM 1.5) and visible light (λ > 420 nm) are shown in the Fig. 11a and b. A type-II heterojunction was formed at the interface of ZnO and g-C3N4 under sunlight irradiation, whereby photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 transfer to the CB of ZnO, through Pt nanoclusters, and photoinduced holes in the VB of ZnO migrate to the VB of g-C3N4 (Fig. 11b). As a result, electron–hole separation occurs and the photocatalytic activity is enhanced. The mechanism of the g-C3N4/OD-ZnO is illustrated in Fig. 11c, which shows a Z-scheme mechanism for the charge separation in the heterojunction.155 The composite had a 5 times higher H2 evolution rate than that of pure g-C3N4.

Coupling g-C3N4 with other metal oxides can result in a type-II heterojunction or a Z-scheme system. In this context, WO3,157,158 V2O5,159,160 BiVO4161 and Ag3PO4162 with the Z-scheme system and Cu2O163,164 and CdS165 with type-II heterojunction were reported in junction with g-C3N4. Due to the ability of WO3 to take part in photocatalytic O2-evolution from water, its narrow bandgap, high electron mobility, abundance and inexpensiveness, g-C3N4/WO3 composites have been widely investigated. In such hybrids, O2 could be generated on the WO3 surface and H2 produced on the g-C3N4 surface.159 It was reported that under visible light irradiation over WO3/g-C3N4/Pt, the CB electrons of WO3 could combine with the VB holes of g-C3N4 at the interface because of their intimate contact.159 As a result, water oxidation occurs on WO3 by means of its holes in the VB and water reduced via Pt trapped C3N4 CB electrons. In this binary Z-scheme heterostructure (in companion with 1 wt% Pt), H2 and O2 were generated as much as 30.3 and 14.8 μmol after 20 h light irradiation, while trace amounts of H2 and O2 were detected over pure g-C3N4. Furthermore, in WO3/rGO/g-C3N4 samples, the rGO could act as a positive electron mediator in the junction of WO3/g-C3N4 due to its good electron conductivity.159 Therefore, in the ternary solid-state Z-scheme WO3/rGO/g-C3N4, electrons in the CB of WO3 combine with holes in the VB of g-C3N4 through rGO. Over this composite, H2 and O2 evolution rates of 2.84 and 1.46 μmol h−1 were measured.159 Type-II and Z-scheme systems of WO3 and g-C3N4 as photoanodes for water oxidation have shown improved charge separation.166 When exfoliated g-C3N4 was deposited on WO3 NRs, electrophoretically, a type-II mechanism for charge separation and transfer was proposed, in which the cascading band alignment of the two materials results in photogenerated charge separation. In comparison with pure WO3 NRs, the type-II heterojunction of WO3/g-C3N4, prepared from 10 s deposition of g-C3N4 on WO3 NRs, revealed an enhanced photocurrent of 0.82 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and IPCE of 33%.
The photoanode prepared from the spin-coating of WO3 on g-C3N4 could show the mechanism of a nonmediator Z-scheme for photoexcited charge separation and transfer. In this mechanism, the recombination of VB holes of g-C3N4 with the CB electrons of WO3 at the interface occurs and the remaining charge carriers on both materials can reduce and oxidize water. A 3-circle deposition of WO3 on g-C3N4 resulted in preparation of a photoanode with a photocurrent of 0.22 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and IPCE of 20%.166


4.2.4. Metal sulfides. 
MoS2 nanoparticles and related metal sulfides, like WS2 and MoSe2, are well-known catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).180 Recently, MoS2 nanomaterials have received great attention due to their tremendous activity as catalysts for HER to replace Pt. The active edge sites can mimic the active sites of hydrogenase and nitrogenase for lowering the HER overpotential. Unsaturated active S atoms located on the exposed edges of MoS2 layers possess a strong affinity to H+ in solution.181,182 These active sites on the MoS2 edges can also facilitate electron transfer, which could enhance the HER.183 It is well established that the charge transfer within the interface of MoS2 and g-C3N4 forms a polarized field, which enhances the separation of photoinduced charge carriers.184 Different metal sulfides have been used for photocatalytic hydrogen generation and some are listed in Table 3.

In Fig. 12a and b, the top and side views of the bilayer g-C3N4/MoS2 hybrid nanocomposite are shown, respectively. A significant geometric distortion occurred in g-C3N4 as a result of the presence of a MoS2 sheet.184 As is shown in Fig. 12c the heterojunction of bilayer g-C3N4/MoS2 forms a type-II heterostructure. There was a 1.98 eV bandgap between the VB edge of bilayer g-C3N4 and the CB edge of the MoS2 sheet. The obtained band structure shows that the direct transfer of electrons from bilayer g-C3N4 to the MoS2 sheet can occur and the photoexcited electrons have enough chemical potential to reduce H+ at the MoS2 active sites. The covered bilayer g-C3N4 has a much better optical absorption below 3.0 eV in comparison with bilayer g-C3N4 (Fig. 12d). Based on the calculation analysis, the bilayer g-C3N4/MoS2 nanocomposite showed expanded optical absorption from UV into visible light, and consequently, it can harvest a broad range of light, including visible light (Fig. 12d).184 The proposed electron–hole generation and transfer in the g-C3N4/MoS2 nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 12e.

A layered MoS2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was prepared by an impregnation method. Over 0.5 wt% MoS2/g-C3N4, hydrogen was generated at a rate of 23.10 μmol h−1, which was 11.3 times higher than the rate observed over pure g-C3N4.185 The CB and VB potentials of g-C3N4 were more negative than those of MoS2, which therefore, resulted in the transfer of photoexcited CB electrons of g-C3N4 to the CB of MoS2. As a result, electron–hole separation occurred effectively, which was confirmed by a decrease in the PL intensity. Also, the deposited Pt on the surface of g-C3N4 collected electrons and then transferred them to the MoS2 nanosheets to reduce water or H+ for hydrogen generation.
Gu et al. coated MoS2 on the surface of self-sensitized g-C3N4 (SSCN) microspheres.186 Over the pure SSCN, no hydrogen was detected, while the optimized sample of SSCN@ (4 wt%) MoS2 showed a rate of 0.91 μmol h−1 under visible light irradiation. The presence of triazine-based oligomer (TBO) dye as a sensitizer enhanced the light harvesting and increased the photoinduced charge carrier population. In this sample, MoS2 acted as active sites for H+ reduction. Nanoflower-structured MoS2 grown on pyridine-modified g-C3N4 (CN-Py) showed a rate of 25 μmol h−1 (on 50 mg photocatalyst) for hydrogen generation, without the addition of any noble metal.187 The interface of MoS2 with CN-Py formed a type-I heterostructure, in which the VB and CB of MoS2 were located between those of CN-Py. After visible light irradiation and electron–hole generation in both CN-Py and MoS2, the photoexcited electrons of CN-Py transferred to the MoS2 CB as a result of the contact electric field. Therefore, the interface and MoS2 enriched with electrons and holes remained in CN-Py. The separation of photogenerated charge carriers resulted in an improved photocatalytic activity of this heterostructure and prevented MoS2 photocorrosion. In another report, MoS2 was decorated on g-C3N4 nanosheets by an in situ light-assisted method.188 The loading of 2.8 wt% of MoS2 on g-C3N4 nanosheets resulted in H2 generation at a rate of 252 μmol g−1 h−1 without using Pt. Based on the PL and PEC results, it was shown that by the deposition of MoS2 on g-C3N4 nanosheets, the charge recombination rate was decreased, followed by an increase in the photocatalytic activity rate. This was due to the transfer of photogenerated CB electrons of g-C3N4 to MoS2 to reduce the adsorbed H+ on the edges of the MoS2 layers to H2.


4.2.5. Carbon nanotubes. 
The ability of CNTs for providing superior electron transport can improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production in g-C3N4/CNT nanocomposites.189 Furthermore, their nanocomposites have a higher surface area, improved optical absorption and effective morphology and structure in comparison to the pure g-C3N4.190 Pawar et al. investigated the photocatalytic activity over the g-C3N4/CNTs/Au hybrids for dye degradation and hydrogen generation.189 The results showed an improvement in the photocatalytic activity rate by a factor of 40. They proposed two possible mechanisms for electron–hole separation and improved photocatalytic activity. In one mechanism, under visible light irradiation, electron–hole pairs are generated over g-C3N4 and since, the CB of g-C3N4 is less negative than the work function of the CNTs, the CB electrons of g-C3N4 could be captured by CNTs and then transferred to Au (eqn (6)). These electrons produce superoxide anion radicals (eqn (7)) for dye degradation. Au/CNT/g-C3N4 + hv → Au (e−)/CNT(e−)/g-C3N4(hVB+)(6) Au (e−) + O2 → Au + O2˙−(7)
In another possible mechanism, a Schottky junction was generated between the Au and g-C3N4. Under visible light illumination, hot electrons were generated as a result of the SPR of the Au nanoparticles. These electrons were injected into the CB of the g-C3N4 (eqn (8)). Afterwards, the electrons were captured by the CNTs (eqn (8)), and then the superoxide anion radical could be generated (eqn (9)). Au/CNT/g-C3N4 + hv → Au (hSPR+)/CNT(e−)/g-C3N4(e−CB)(8) CNT (e−) + O2 → CNT + O2˙−(9)
Based on the both mechanisms, effective electron–hole separation occurred and the photocatalytic activity was improved. In another report, Chen et al. prepared a hybrid of CNT/g-C3N4 by the addition of functionalized CNTs to a cyanamide solution, followed by heat-treatment.190 The TEM image of the prepared sample in Fig. 13a shows a large-scale and uniform dispersion of CNTs and that there is an intimate interaction between the CNTs and g-C3N4. In the HRTEM image in Fig. 13b, it can be seen that the orifices of CNTs are filled with g-C3N4. It was mentioned in this work that the reason for the enhanced charge separation on the excited g-C3N4 was the presence of CNTs, which increased the charge carrier lifetime and enhanced the population distribution of the short-lived and long-lived photogenerated charge carriers.190 Based on the photoluminescence decay spectra in Fig. 13c, it was concluded that, on the optimized CNT/g-C3N4 sample, the radiative lifetimes of the charge carriers were slightly prolonged, due to the presence of CNTs, which are beneficial for surface charge carrier trapping and also interfacial electron transfer.

Suryawanshi et al. showed that the addition of an optimal amount of MWCNTs to g-C3N4 could provide a 100% improvement in its photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen generation.191 In their study, the effective charge transfer and also morphological effects of the MWCNTs were the key factors behind this improvement. As shown in Fig. 13d, when the MWCNT concentration was as low as 0.5 wt%, it reinforced the specific surface area of g-C3N4. At higher MWCNT concentrations, it was catalytically ineffective and had a delirious effect on light absorption. Also, the absorbance at 425 nm was higher for the physical mixture of 0.5% MWCNT in comparison with the corresponding composite, but the photocatalytic performance of the composite was 7 times better than the physical mixture in terms of hydrogen generation. This showed the importance of charge transfer in the photocatalytic process, which cannot take place in the physical mixture. This was due to the light absorption by MWCNTs in the mixture.


4.2.6. Graphene. 
According to the published studies, graphene can have different roles in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/graphene nanocomposites. Pure graphene as a zero bandgap semimetal can improve the charge transport for effective charge carrier separation. Therefore, it can be utilized as a mediator in a Z-scheme system or can be used as an inexpensive co-catalyst for electron transfer in the hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with a range of bandgaps can act as semiconductors for the fabrication of hybrid g-C3N4 nanomaterials. Theoretically it was shown that the bandgap energy of GQDs/g-C3N4 could be engineered by changing the lateral size of the GQDs, including by decreasing the thickness of the graphene quantum dots and/or tuning their lateral dimension.192 This bandgap energy could reach up to 1.92 eV to absorb a large part of solar light. Also, the interface of the GQDs and g-C3N4 formed a type-II heterojunction, which was a favourable heterostructure for enhanced photocatalytic activity, because of an enhanced electron–hole separation. The sufficiently negative CB potential of the GQDs/g-C3N4 composites provided a strong reduction potential for water splitting and hydrogen production. It was shown that charge redistribution at the interface resulted in strong electron depletion above the GQDs sheet and electron accumulation below the g-C3N4 monolayer. This led to the formation of a built-in electric field, which drives the photogenerated electrons and holes to transfer to the opposite directions and thus enhanced separation occurs.
It is well established that the nitrogen-doped GQDs (N-GQDs) have excitation-independent upconversion PL properties and visible light and long-wavelength light absorption much better than that of GQDs.193 A g-C3N4/N-GQDs hybrid was prepared by Zou et al.193 The optimized sample containing 15 at% of N-GQDs, showed a rate of 10.31 μmol g−1 h−1 for hydrogen generation under long wavelength irradiation (λ > 590 nm). There was no hydrogen detected over GQDs or g-C3N4 in that work. The observed result could be due to the prolonged charge carrier's life time and enhanced separation of electrons due to the multiple roles of N-GQDs. In their proposed mechanism under visible light irradiation, g-C3N4 could absorb light in the range of 420–470 nm to generate electrons and holes. Also, the N-GQDs could absorb visible light (600–800 nm) and then emitted shorter wavelength light (λ < 470 nm), which was absorbed by g-C3N4. The excited electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 then transferred to the surface of N-GQDs, while the holes remaining in its VB reacted with the sacrificial regents.193 Due to this aforementioned property of N-GQDs, when an optimized amount of N-GQDs was added to the ZnNb2O6/g-C3N4, the activity of the photocatalyst for H2 evolution was enhanced.194 The electronic band structure of the sulfur-doped g-C3N4/S-Se-graphene (CNS:S–Se–Gr) composite in comparison with g-C3N4 and sulfur-doped g-C3N4 was determined by means of electrochemical Mott–Schottky plots.195 The top of the VB of g-C3N4 was at +1.34 V, so its oxidative potential was not sufficient for producing hydroxyl radicals. In the prepared CNS:S–Se–Gr hybrid photocatalyst, the VB was lowered by 0.34 V, which provided an improvement in its photo-oxidation ability. Tonda et al. utilized g-C3N4 (2D)/CdS (1D)/rGO (2D) as a stable photocatalyst for hydrogen production.196 Over the optimized sample of this dual interface structure, hydrogen was produced at the rate of 4801.5 μmol g−1 h−1. They attributed the ability of the ternary composite for enhanced hydrogen generation to the efficient electron transport through rGO and the visible-light photocatalytic activity of CdS and also, due to the effective band alignment of CdS in the junction with g-C3N4.


4.2.7. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). 
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of porous crystalline materials, are made of metal-containing clusters and organic linkers. These materials have received great attention due to their potential applications in fields like adsorption, catalysis, gas storage and molecular sensing,197,198 MOFs have high hydrogen-storage capacities 199 and also can be used for solar hydrogen generation.200,201 The CB of MOFs is mainly contributed by the vacant outer orbitals of the metal centres, while the valence band is constructed by the outer orbitals of the organic ligands.198 The hydrogen photocatalytic conversion efficiency of MOFs is low due to their poor stabilities, high charge recombination rate and restricted light harvesting. The fabrication of hybrid materials with MOFs for photocatalytic applications can compensate their weaknesses and leads to the ability to utilize their advantages. For example, Wang et al. showed that the UiO-66/g-C3N4 heterojunction (UiO is a Zr-containing MOF) can produce hydrogen from water reduction, under visible light irradiation.198 Over the sample containing 50 wt% g-C3N4 on the UiO-66 surfaces, a hydrogen generation rate of 14.11 × 10−6 M h−1 was reported, which was higher than that of isolated UiO-66 and g-C3N4 samples. This was due to the effective charge separation at the interface of these materials. This hybrid sample also showed good stability owing to the high chemical stability of UiO-66 and g-C3N4.


4.2.8. Other carbonaceous materials. 
Carbon dots are carbon nanomaterials with sizes up to 10 nm, containing different kinds of functional groups, such as –OH, –COOH and –CHO. These materials show some unique properties, including high stability, unique upconverted photoluminescence and photoinduced electron transfer properties. As a result, the g-C3N4/carbon dots can be a good candidate for enhanced photocatalytic activity. The functional groups of carbon dots are important for determining the charge-transfer mechanism, the active sites for water oxidation and for reduction.203 For the junction of the C–CHO/g-C3N4 composite, two mechanisms for charge transfer (CT) were proposed based on the first-principles many-body Green's function theory (Fig. 14a).203 In route I, the illuminated light may excite a CT state, resulting in photogenerated charge separation directly. Also, the light may be resonant with high-energy transitions (n → π*, π → π*) of the g-C3N4. Then, the system may decay into the low-energy CT states nonadiabatically (route II), resulting in electron–hole separation. In this way, g-C3N4 and Cdots could be the site of water oxidation and reduction, respectively.

Liu et al. prepared a carbon nanodot–carbon nitride (C3N4) nanocomposite as g-C3N4/carbon dots and determined the VB energy of the composite using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and calculated the CB energy from Ev − Eg.202 As shown in Fig. 14b, the oxidation and reduction potentials of water lay between the CB and VB potentials of the g-C3N4/carbon dots; therefore, the composite had a potential for photocatalytic water splitting. Hydrogen generation measurements revealed that the composite had an efficiency of 16% for solar water splitting at a wavelength λ = 420 ± 20 nm and an overall solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.0% (Fig. 14c). In another research, Li et al. prepared g-C3N4 nanosheets/carbon QDs composites by the deposition of carbon QDs on g-C3N4 nanosheets.204 Over their optimized sample, hydrogen was generated at a rate of 116.1 μmol h−1, which was 3 times higher than that of g-C3N4 nanosheets. By means of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements, they concluded that the carbon QDs acted as an electron reservoir for photoexcited electrons of the carbon QDs to enhance charge carrier separation.
1D carbon fibres (CFs) and carbon nanotubes have the same electrochemical properties, but the fabrication of CFs is easier and cheaper than fabricating carbon nanotubes.206 In a recent work, carbon fibres were fabricated by the electrospinning technique from poly acrylonitrile (PAN) solution and then, the CFs were mixed with thiourea, followed by calcination, which resulted in the formation of g-C3N4 on CF.205 In Fig. 15a and b, the SEM and HRTEM images of nanofibres can be observed. Also, the elemental mapping of the composite confirmed the existence of g-C3N4 on the surface of the carbon fibres. The intimate interaction between g-C3N4 and CF can enhance charge transfer between them to promote photocatalytic activity. Based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results shown in Fig. 15c, it was found that the composite of g-C3N4 and CF (CF10) have faster interfacial charge transfer and more effective charge separation in comparison with g-C3N4 (CF0). A rate of 1080 μmol h−1 g−1 for hydrogen generation was achieved over this composite under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the effective charge separation, improved light harvesting and increased specific surface area.

4.3. Morphology tuning
It is well known that the photocatalytic hydrogen generation depends on the size, morphology and also the surface structure of the photocatalyst.207,208 Therefore, here, we review different architectures of g-C3N4, including porous structures (3D),209,210 nanosheets (2D),211 nanofibres (1D)212 and QDs (0D)60 for hydrogen generation. In the following section, we discuss these categories of materials based on the dimensionalities and structures.

4.3.1. Porous g-C3N4 (3D structures). 
Recovery of the powder form of g-C3N4 is a complicated step during the photocatalytic process. Also, random aggregation of the g-C3N4 nanosheets decreases their accessible surface for photocatalytic applications. Therefore, an ordered and macron-sized assembly of g-C3N4 nanomaterials with highly accessible catalytic active sites is very important for the industrial and practical applications of g-C3N4.213 Liang et al. reported the synthesis of a macroscopic 3D porous g-C3N4 monolith by the thermal polymerization of urea inside the framework of a melamine sponge (MS).213 The specific surface area (SSA) of the 3D sample was calculated and the amount was 78 m2 g−1, which was significantly higher than that of g-C3N4 (40 m2 g−1). The high SSA in the 3D structure was attributed to the prohibition of stacking of g-C3N4 nanosheets by the MS framework during the polymerization of urea. The 3D porous g-C3N4 monolith could harvest light with wavelength above 450 nm, significantly. The light harvesting was improved in comparison with the powdered g-C3N4, which was due to the multiple reflections of incident light inside the interconnected network of porous g-C3N4 nanosheets and the presence of an N-enriched carbon/g-C3N4 heterojunction. 3D porous g-C3N4 showed a narrower bandgap than that of g-C3N4 and also demonstrated an enhanced charge separation. The rate of hydrogen generation over this 3D sample was 2.84 times higher than that of powder g-C3N4. Furthermore, this free-standing sample showed good mechanical strength and acceptable elasticity.213 A 3D g-C3N4 belt network was prepared by a hydrothermal treatment of bulk graphitic carbon nitride in a saturated oxalic acid solution.209 This sample showed a surface area of 62.7 m2 g−1, which was much higher than the bulk g-C3N4 due to the formation of the 3D networking nanobelts. A blue-shift in the absorption edge for the g-C3N4 belt network was observed, which was attributed to the quantum confinement and to the introduction of oxygen-containing groups into the g-C3N4, which decreased the conjugation length. According to the time-resolved fluorescence study, it was shown that the lifetime of charge carriers in the 3D g-C3N4 belt network was higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. This prolonged lifetime of charge carriers could be related to an improvement in the electron transport and also to modulation of the energy-band configuration caused by the quantum confinement effects or/and the electron-withdrawing effect of introduced oxygen-containing functional groups. Over this sample, the hydrogen was generated at the rate of 1.36 mmol g−1 h−1, which was higher than the bulk g-C3N4 with the rate of 0.11 mmol g−1 h−1.209


4.3.2. g-C3N4 nanosheets (2D structures). 
By increasing the dimension of conjugated polymers from 1D to 2D, a high mobility of 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 has been reported.214 Also the binding energies of the Frenkel-type excitons (bounded electron–hole pairs, in which the hole is localized at a point in the crystal structure) are reduced, and the robust stability of the 2D extended π-conjugated units has been reported.215 It has been predicted in theoretical investigations that in the electronic band structure of an infinite g-C3N4 sheet, the band edges straddle the water redox and since the reduction potential of H+/H2 is positioned in the middle of the bandgap, the g-C3N4 sheet can be a good photocatalyst for hydrogen generation from water.48 Highly anisotropic 2D-nanosheets of g-C3N4 have some advantages in comparison with the bulk g-C3N4, including a high specific surface area of 306 m2 g−1, a wider bandgap (by 0.2 eV), good electron transport along the in-plane direction (because of the presence of channels for electron transport) and a prolonged lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers due to the quantum confinement effect. Hence, these nanosheets are good photocatalysts for hydrogen reduction and hydroxyl radical formation.216,217
g-C3N4 nanosheets can be prepared via several methods, which are generally classified as thermal218 and liquid86 and also other methods, including Hummers219 and mechanical exfoliation.220 Yang et al. prepared g-C3N4 nanosheets through liquid exfoliation in different solvents, including isopropyl alcohol (IPA), N-methyl pyrrole (NMP), water, ethanol and acetone.211 IPA and NMP were the best solvents for g-C3N4 exfoliation. IPA was selected as a solvent for large-scale exfoliation due to its low boiling point. The prepared nanosheets had the same morphology as graphene or graphene oxide with the thickness of ≈2 nm. The derived flat-band potential for g-C3N4 nanosheets was about −1.40 V versus Ag/AgCl, which was more positive than that of bulk g-C3N4 (−1.49 V) due to its high electrical conductivity and corresponding low overpotential during electrochemical tests. Furthermore, the high surface area (384 m2 g−1) and plentiful active sites with nitrogen atoms on the g-C3N4 nanosheets were significant factors for its high activity as a photocatalyst. The photocatalytic activity showed that hydrogen was generated over this material at a rate of 93 μmol h−1 under visible light irradiation, which was significantly higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 (10 μmol h−1). This rate was also higher than that of highly ordered mesoporous g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 nanosheets prepared by thermal exfoliation under similar conditions.211 The reported specific surface area of few-layer g-C3N4 prepared by chemical exfoliation was 179.5 m2 g−1, which was about 10.3 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4.221 Over these nanosheets, H2 was produced at a rate of 110.68 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 1.22-fold greater than that of their bulk counterparts, due to the improved charge transfer and high specific surface area of the nanosheets.
Ultrathin g-C3N4 nanoplatelets were prepared by ball milling with the mechanical exfoliation method.220 The TEM and AFM results are shown in Fig. 16a and b. The nanoplatelets had the size of 2–6 nm and a thickness of 0.35–0.7 nm. Hydrogen production was carried out over this sample at a rate of 1.365 μmol h−1 g−1, which was 13.7 times higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 16c, the VBM of the ultrathin g-C3N4 was increased by 0.22 eV (from 1.36 to 1.14 eV vs. Ag/AgCl). The band positions of bulk and ultrathin g-C3N4 are compared in Fig. 16d. In ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets, the bandgap widening of as much as 0.09 eV and rising VBM (0.22 eV) led to a CBM upshifted by 0.31 eV. The large upshifting in the edge of CB caused a larger thermodynamic driving force for hydrogen production. This shift was associated with the large specific surface area of the sample, leading to an improved photocatalytic activity of the ultrathin g-C3N4 nanoplatelets.220 By extending the time of g-C3N4 thermal treatment at 550 °C, Zhang et al. prepared g-C3N4 flat nanosheets, which obviously demonstrated a different morphology from the bulk one.218 Through this process, the SSA of g-C3N4 was increased and its pore size decreased which also led to in-plane holes formation. When the annealing time was extended for 12 h, the size of in-plane holes reached to 100 nm. The SSA of that sample was measured to be as much as 117.27 m2 g−1. The optimum time of annealing for the ideal C/N ratio in g-C3N4 was between 6 and 9 h. The sample underwent thermal treatment for 9 h to show enhanced optical and photoelectrical properties. The TEM image is shown in Fig. 17a. It demonstrated a lower PL intensity, higher photocurrent and also higher photocatalytic activity for H2 generation under visible light irradiation in comparison with the bulk g-C3N4 sample.218

Lin et al. prepared fish-scale g-C3N4 nanosheets,222 for which the rate of hydrogen generation was 2.93 times higher than that of exfoliated g-C3N4 nanosheets. This was due to the crystallinity improvement in the fish-scale g-C3N4 nanosheets, which was effective for charge transfer and separation. Also, the improved ability of fish-scale g-C3N4 nanosheets for light harvesting was beneficial for their photocatalytic activity. Xia et al. prepared a heterostructure of integrated g-C3N4 nanosheets (CNNSs) with carbon quantum dots (CQDs).223 This heterostructure showed photocatalytic activity from the UV to NIR wavelengths, which was due to overlapping of the CNNS absorption and the upconversion emission spectrum of the CQDs. Also, facilitated charge transfer through the electronic coupling at the interface of CNNS and CQDs with closed contact was an important key to enhancing the photocatalytic H2 generation without applying a co-catalyst. Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) prepared from urea was exfoliated to PCN few-layered nanosheets by a steam reforming delamination method.224 Nanosheets have more active sites, prolonged charge carriers lifetime and can promote separation efficiency as compared to the bulky PCN. So H2 could be generated over the PCN nanosheets with an apparent quantum yield of 11.3% at 405 nm. Steam reforming has been used for the exfoliation of bulk PCN prepared from melamine, dicyandiamide and thiourea precursors.224


4.3.3. g-C3N4 nanofibres (ID structures). 
1D nanofibres, including nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes, have unique properties owing to their low dimensions and quantum confinement effect.225 For example, photocatalyst nanomaterials with a tubular structure like TiO2 nanotubes with open mesoporous morphology can efficiently transfer the photoinduced charge carriers along their 1D path, whereas, their exposed inner and outer surface can provide a high surface area for photocatalytic reactions.226 Therefore, the synthesis and usage of C3N4 with a 1D structure can be promising for future photocatalytic applications and hydrogen generation.
Zeng et al. prepared g-C3N4 nanotubes through a nanosheets roll-up mechanism.226 In this process, bulk g-C3N4 were exfoliated to nanosheets via liquid exfoliation in water and then the g-C3N4 nanotubes were formed after a sudden hot-cool process by crimping the C3N4 nanosheets (Fig. 17b). The nanotubes surface area was higher than the bulk and nanosheet samples. Due to the multiple reflections of incident light and efficient charge transport, and sufficient active sites, the nanotubes showed an enhanced hydrogen generation rate in comparison with the bulk sample.
g-C3N4 nanorods were prepared through a template-confined thermal condensation of cyanamide.227 The nanorods were composed of highly condensed and oriented g-C3N4 and also showed some properties such as good light harvesting and directional charge transport. The thermal condensation of cyanamide into the template channels resulted in an improved crystallinity, extended domain size and lowered VB edge position of g-C3N4. With the presence of 3 wt% Pt as the co-catalyst and triethanolamine as a sacrificial agent, the H2 generation over g-C3N4 nanorods was 3 times faster than that of the bulk one, which was due to their high-aspect-ratio structures.227


4.3.4. g-C3N4 quantum dots (0D structures). 
In GQDs sized less than 10 nm, both the strong quantum confinement and edge effects lead to them having significant optical properties. As a result, GQDs-based photocatalysts, such as GQDs@ZnO nanowires, have been designed for photoelectrochemical water splitting.229 As an analogue, g-C3N4 QDs (CNQDs), with the diameter in the range of 5–9 nm, have been prepared through thermal-chemical exfoliation.60 In that process, at first, thermal exfoliation of the bulk g-C3N4 was done to prepare the nanosheets; then, through acid etching, nanoribbons were synthesized and at last, hydrothermal cutting of the nanoribbons resulted in CNQDs (Fig. 17c). The chemical structure contained triazine groups with surface amino-and carbonyl-functional groups. Due to the emission of bright blue luminescence under UV excitation, CNQDs have been used in bioimaging and biolabelling.230 The CNQDs showed upconversion property under long-wavelength light and their excitation by 705–862 nm light resulted in emissions in the range of 350–600 nm, which covers a wide range of visible light. These results show that CNQDs can convert the near IR light to visible. Therefore, a metal-free isotype heterostructure of CNQDs with bulk g-C3N4 was prepared by the addition of CNQDs to the bulk material.60 The CNQDs suspension with bulk g-C3N4 showed a 2.87 times faster H2 generation than the bulk g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation, owing to the energy-transfer property of CNQDs and also fast charge transfer across the interface of this heterostructure.60 The proposed mechanism of charge carrier generation is shown schematically in Fig. 18a. Incident short wavelength visible light can generate electrons and holes in bulk g-C3N4 material. Subsequently, the illuminated light with λ > 600 nm, which is upconverted to λ < 600 nm through the upconversion property of CNQDs, can corporate in the excitation of bulk g-C3N4. As a result, their composites have the ability of long wavelength absorption. Some of the compositions of CNQDs with TiO2 were already discussed in Subsection 4.2.2.

4.3.5. g-C3N4 special architectures. 
Some special architectures of g-C3N4, like a “seaweeds” network,231 twisted hexagonal rod-like architecture232 and hollow g-C3N4 nanospheres,228 have shown better photocatalytic activity than the bulk sample. This was due to the enhanced SSA and improved optical properties of these special structures.
Han et al. prepared a g-C3N4 “seaweeds” network structure consisting of assembled g-C3N4 porous 1D nanofibres.231 This structure was rich in pores with a size of less than 20 nm. H2 was generated at a high rate of 9900 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation, with a turnover number of 385 after 6 h and with a significant quantum efficiency of 7.8% at 420 nm. This structure, as a photocatalyst, had some advantages in comparison with the bulk structure. The higher SSA in this sample resulted in a higher exposed interfacial contact with the reactant molecules. The new surface states as charge traps quenched PL and suppressed electron–hole recombination for enhanced photocatalytic activity.
Zheng et al. imprinted a twisted hexagonal rod-like architecture of g-C3N4.232 These helical rod-like structures had both an increased SSA and improved light absorption in the whole optical spectrum due to the multiple reflections of the incident light. The enhancement in visible light absorption was owing to the chiral synthesis and copolymerization strategy, which led to fusing the aromatic motifs in the g-C3N4 network. Due to the quantum effects in this material, the Eg was increased as much as 0.09 eV. As a result of these properties, the helical rod-like g-C3N4 could be a better photocatalyst than bulk g-C3N4 for hydrogen generation.
A hollow g-C3N4 structure with a Janus surface was synthesized using the template method.228 The Pt and Co3O4 nanoparticles as a co-catalyst were deposited in the inner and outer shells of the g-C3N4 hollow spheres (Fig. 18b). As shown in Fig. 18c the spatially separated water oxidation and reduction sites led to a retardation in electron–hole recombination and enhanced photocatalytic water splitting. In the other report, Jun et al. prepared mesoporous hollow spheres consisting of tri-s-triazine-based g-C3N4 nanosheets.233 This photocatalyst was better than bulk g-C3N4 owing to the dual modification from the copolymerization and special nanostructure. Using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, they showed that photogenerated charge carrier recombination in g-C3N4 mesoporous hollow spheres was suppressed in comparison with the bulk sample and also the light absorption and bandgap energy were increased, while the chemical structure remained unchanged.

5. Current research status
In Table 4 we summarize most of the outstanding studies reporting the AQY and STH efficiencies. Although, the STH efficiency is an important parameter to estimate and evaluate the economic potential and prospective of g-C3N4 for photocatalytic hydrogen generation (see Fig. 5), most of the research studies seem to have ignored this parameter and we found that only a few articles had reported this factor. The reported AQY for g-C3N4 nanomaterials have passed the amount of 20%, which shows their promise and bright future for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Furthermore, Table 4 shows that the fabrication of g-C3N4 hybrids and nanocomposites with the ability of bandgap tuning is more efficient than the doping and morphology design methods.

6. Conclusion and outlook
Although g-C3N4 is a semiconductor with unique properties, there are some drawbacks in its function as a photocatalyst for hydrogen generation from water splitting. The fast recombination of charge carriers, limited absorbance of the sunlight spectrum and low surface area are the main deficiencies, which have motivated the scientific community to publish numerous studies aiming for enhancement of g-C3N4 photocatalytic activity. Despite this, the challenges for realizing the future potential and further development have not been solved. To pursue the long-term development of g-C3N4 nanomaterials to produce hydrogen through a photocatalytic process as a method with low environmental impact and to compete with the industrial process of methane steam reforming, it is essential to address two important issues: AQY and STH. To achieve the final goal of industrializing solar hydrogen production using a photocatalytic method, the STH conversion should meet the minimum 10% target amount. Since the AQY has an effect on achieving the final goal of STH, we review the approaches to tune the AQY and STH. In Fig. 19, these scenarios are categorized and different possibilities are summarized, which were comprehensively reviewed herein in the morphology design, g-C3N4 hybrids and nanocomposites and doping with non-metals and metals sections.
 Fig. 19  Different scenarios for future development of g-C3N4 nanomaterials for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. 
Doped g-C3N4 (with different metal and non-metal ions) can show modified textural, optical and electronical properties and improved photocatalytic activity. Noble metal co-catalysts, including Au, Ag and Pt nanoparticles, could improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 by enhancing visible light absorption through the SPR effect. These metals and other ones like Ni and Pd can also act as electron traps to improve electron–hole separation, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity.
Heterostructuring of g-C3N4 with other semiconductors, especially TiO2, is an attractive way to prepare composites with prolonged charge carrier lifetime. MoS2 is a suitable material for replacing with a Pt co-catalyst. Enhanced charge separation on excited g-C3N4 in the presence of CNT can increase the charge carrier lifetime and improve the population distribution of the short-lived and long-lived photogenerated charge carriers. The interface of graphene quantum dots and g-C3N4 forms a type-II heterojunction, which is a favourable heterostructure for enhanced photocatalytic activity, because of the enhanced electron–hole separation. As a last point, optimization of the morphology of g-C3N4 and the preparation of g-C3N4 materials with 3D, 2D and 1D structures can overcome some problems. Porous 3D g-C3N4 has a greater surface area than the bulk one. Nanosheets of g-C3N4 are favoured due to their high specific surface area, wider bandgap, good electron transport along the in-plane direction and prolonged lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers due to the quantum confinement effect. 1D g-C3N4 has multiple reflections of incident light, efficient charge transport and sufficient active sites, hence shows an enhanced hydrogen generation rate in comparison with the bulk sample.
To conclude our discussion and to provide a perspective for the future research direction in developing g-C3N4 nanomaterials for photocatalytic hydrogen production, we propose some open avenues to produce a more efficient STH efficiency. Sensitizing the g-C3N4 nanomaterials with bimetallic nanoparticles can provide a broad absorption wavelength due to the SPR effect and can be more effective than applying a single metal. Utilizing the bimetallic nanoparticles fabricates the full-spectrum solar energy absorption and fabrication of wide spectral coverage photocatalyst, which improve both the STH and AQY values. Although Table 4 demonstrated that the fabrication of hybrid or composite photocatalysts is promising for the future development of g-C3N4 nanomaterials, designing appropriate junctions and interfaces between the compartments are a crucial factor. Due to the presence of the functional group on the surface of g-C3N4 nanomaterials, engineering the interface between them and other semiconductors with Z-scheme system can aid in the design of a highly efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen production. It is worth noting that the Z-scheme structure without using any noble metal can be promising for future photocatalytic applications. Furthermore, the design and fabrication of ternary nanocomposites with g-C3N4 nanomaterials with the cascade charge transfer capability and based on the detailed knowledge about the surface and interface physics of the semiconductors can provide efficient hydrogen production with a high AQY value. Coupling the g-C3N4 nanomaterials with transition metal chalcogenides as a co-catalyst to transfer the photogenerated electrons for water reduction and effective charge separation is encouraging for further research. Moreover, combining morphology design and nanocomposite fabrication can be another efficient approach to produce a photocatalyst with the desired hydrogen production rate.
