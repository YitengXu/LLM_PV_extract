, Accepted 22nd June 2015First published on 29th June 2015AbstractN-doped TiO2 nanofibres were observed to possess lower aerobic oxidation activity than undoped TiO2 nanofibres in the selective photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol. This was attributed to the reduction free energy of O2 adsorption in the vicinity of nitrogen dopant sites, as indicated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations when three-coordinated oxygen atoms are substituted by nitrogen atoms. It was found that the activity recovered following a controlled calcination of the N-doped NFs in air. The dependence of the conversion of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol on the intensity of light irradiation confirmed that these reactions were driven by light. Action spectra showed that the two oxidation reactions are responsive to light from the UV region through to the visible light irradiation range. The extended light absorption wavelength range in these systems compared to pure TiO2 materials was found to result from the formation of surface complex species following adsorption of reactants onto the catalysts' surface, evidenced by the in situ IR experiment. Both catalytic and in situ IR results reveal that benzaldehyde is the intermediate in the aerobic oxidation of benzylamine to N-benzylidenebenzylamine process.
1. Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most promising photocatalysts for the removal of organic contaminants from waste water and polluted air and for green synthesis of fine chemicals due to its high efficiency, stability and non-toxicity.1–5 Among the four common TiO2 phases, anatase (tetragonal, space group I41/amd) is considered to be more active than the other three TiO2 polymorphs, including, rutile (tetragonal, space group P42/mnm), brookite (orthorhombic, space group Pbca) and TiO2(B) (monoclinic, space group C2/m) in spite of the fact that they possess close band gap values at 3.0–3.2 eV.6–9 In order to use TiO2 practically in environmental treatment and organic synthesis, there are still some difficulties to overcome. Firstly, the active phase of anatase TiO2 absorbs light only in the UV range of the electromagnetic spectrum (TiO2 band gap 3.2 eV, ∼4% adsorption of the total solar energy).10–12 In contrast to the UV, the visible region of the solar spectrum accounts for nearly 43% of solar energy incident on the earth's surface. To utilise solar energy efficiently, methods such as doping non-metal elements N, C, S, P, F, B into the lattice of TiO2 can shift the light absorption to the visible region.13–19 Most of such research has focused on the doping-induced band structure change20–28 and its effect on light absorption. Few studies have addressed potential changes in surface properties, such as composition and structures and on the impact of these changes on catalytic performance. The performance of a photocatalyst does not entirely depend on the light absorption. As we found in the present study, although N-doped TiO2 exhibit better visible light absorption than the undoped counterpart, the performance of the doped sample is poorer even under visible light. Since the reaction takes place on catalyst surface, the surface properties can significantly affect the catalytic activity. For example, the ability of the surface to adsorb O2, the oxidant for many oxidation reactions, may determine the performance of catalysts for the oxidation.29 On the other hand, doping with other elements certainly results in the changes in the surface property, which should affect the catalytic performance. It is also known some organics strongly adsorb on the TiO2 surface (forming a surface complex), and act as a sensitiser that allows the system to absorb visible light. The formation of the surface complexes capable of absorbing visible light have been utilised to develop photocatalysts for selective oxidation of toluene under room temperature.30 Generally, TiO2 exhibits poor selectivity in photocatalytic oxidation reactions due to its high oxidation power in aqueous environments.31–33 This is a useful trait when TiO2 is used for an environmental remediation purpose since all organic contaminants can be decomposed to CO2 and H2O. But in photocatalytic synthesis, poor selectivity is a serious disadvantage. Recently, significant efforts have been made to improve selectivity of TiO2 photocatalysts in organic solvents for synthesis of fine organic chemicals.34–37 To this end, the interaction of surface –OH groups with photo-generated holes should be hindered. For organic synthesis, the selectivity to desired product is a criterion of equal importance to the conversion rate of the reactant, determining the efficiency of the synthesis. Therefore, to achieve green processes of photocatalytic organic synthesis, such as selective aerobic oxidation of organic compounds, it is important to understand the impact of the surface properties of photocatalysts on their performance. Insights gained by such studies should enable researchers to tune surface structures to optimise photocatalysts for organic synthesis, driven by light irradiation.
In the present study, we report on the synthesis of anatase nanoplate-covered TiO2(B) core–shell nanofibres by the calcination of protonated-titanate (H-titanate) in air or gaseous NH3 flow (samples were designated as BF and N–BF, respectively) at elevated temperatures. The calcination in NH3 introduces N to the anatase shell surface, and reduces the surface –OH groups. The N–BF NFs was calcined in air for varying periods (20 and 180 min, designated as N–BF-A20 and N–BF-A180) to tune the amount of the surface N sites. The oxygen adsorption ability on the surface of N-doped and undoped TiO2 NFs was studied by density functional theory (DFT) method. Two aerobic oxidation reactions, the aerobic oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, were chosen to examine the influence of the surface on the photocatalytic activity.
2. Experimental
2.1 Nitrogen doping and surface post-treatment
The H-titanate (H2Ti3O7) nanofibres were prepared by the hydrothermal reaction between anatase TiO2 and concentrated NaOH solution, followed by an acid wash process. The anatase nanoplate-covered TiO2(B) core–shell nanofibres were prepared by direct calcination of the H-titanate nanofibres at 550 °C in air (denoted as BF). To prepare the N-doped TiO2, a quartz boat, loaded with H-titanate nanofibres, was placed in a quartz tube (30 mm in diameter) at a constant temperature zone of a tube furnace. The system was heated to 550 °C in gaseous NH3 flow (50 standard cubic centimetres per minute (SCCM), controlled with a flow meter). After reaction, the furnace was cooled to room temperature naturally with continuous NH3 gas flow (product denoted as N–BF). The N-doped sample was calcined in air at 550 °C for different periods from 20 min and 3 h to remove adsorbed NH3 and obtain partial oxidization of the N-doped surface. These materials were labelled N–BF-A20 and N–BF-A180, respectively.
2.2 Characterisation
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies on the samples were carried out on a FEI Tecnai F20 instrument operating at 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Philips PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with a fixed slit. Infrared spectra of the samples were obtained using a Nicolet Nexus 870 FTIR spectrometer with a smart endurance single bounce diamond ATR cell. Spectra over the 4000 to 525 cm−1 range were obtained by the co-addition of 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured by the volumetric method on an automatic adsorption instrument (Micromeritics, Tristar 3000) at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). Specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method from the data in a P/P0 range between 0.05 and 0.2. To investigate the light absorption and emission behaviour of the samples, the diffuse reflectance UV-Visible (Dir-UV-Vis) spectra of the samples were measured on a Varian Cary 5000 spectrometer. In situ FT-IR spectra of the samples before and after light irradiation were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 IR spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector. Prior to the measurement, the sample was palletised into self-supporting wafer, introduced into an in situ IR cell equipped with CaF2 windows, and pre-treated at 10−2 Pa and 400 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to benzylamine or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol vapour (25 Pa) at room temperature. The residual reactants were removed under evacuation and dry air (50 KPa) was introduced into the in situ IR cell. The time course IR spectra were recorded after Xe light irradiation. The spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement was performed with an EPR X-band spectrometer (Bruker Emxplus-10/12) at room temperature. Typical EPR sample was prepared by mixing catalyst (200 mg) and benzylamine (3 ml) with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) (220 mg) at 40 °C under Xe light irradiation for 1.5 h. The liquid was filtered and measured immediately.
2.3 Selective photocatalytic oxidation
The light source was a 100 W COB LED lamp (white light, the spectrum is shown in Fig. S1†) or a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF 300, Beijing CEL Tech. Co., Ltd, the spectrum is shown in Fig. S2†). The long pass filters and optical band pass filters were used to block light of other wavelengths to study the wavelength irradiation contribution. All the oxidation reactions were conducted under oxygen atmosphere (1 atm) and O2 was bubbled through the vessel for 1 min prior to the catalytic reaction. After reaction, the liquid products were analyzed using a Shimadzu 2014C GC with a WondaCap 5 column.
Photocatalytic oxidation of benzylamine: typically, benzylamine (0.2 mmol) was dissolved in CH3CN (5 ml) and the photocatalyst (50 mg) was added. Then the reaction mixture was kept at 40 °C and illuminated with LED light for 5 h.
Photocatalytic oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol: in a typical reaction, catalyst (50 mg) was added into 5 ml mixed solution of CH3CN (50 ml) and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (2 mmol). The system was kept at 40 °C and illuminated under Xe light for 4 h.
2.4 Theoretical calculation
The relationship between the TiO2 surface structure and its ability to adsorb O2 was explored using density functional theory (DFT) calculations which were performed by CP2K package [http://www.cp2k.org/](see the ESI Table S1† for detailed calculation parameters). In the DFT calculations, the electron exchange-correlation was described by the revised GGA-PBE functional,38 and DFT-D3 van der Waals correction39 was considered. Spin polarization was included whenever necessary. Based on the experimental data, the 100 surface of anatase TiO2 was simulated. The calculations were carried out on periodic slabs in a (5 × 2 × 4) supercell that comprised 160 TiO2 units and separated by a vacuum of more than 1.30 nm (see Fig. S3 for the cell structure in the ESI†). To mimic bulk constraints, the bottom layer of the TiO2 slab was fixed and the a and b lattice parameters were fixed to the experimental lattice constants.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Surface and structure properties of TiO2 and N-doped TiO2 nanofibres (NFs)
All TiO2 nanofibre samples (BF, N–BF, N–BF-A20 and N–BF-A180) inherited the fibril morphology from the titanate NFs according to TEM observation and the BET surface area for these fibres were almost the same at ca. 30 m2 g−1 due to their same calcination temperature of 550 °C. Fig. S4† shows the XRD patterns of these nanofibres. The main diffraction peaks were indexed to the TiO2(B) phase (monoclinic, space group C2/m, identical to ICDD PDF no. 74-1940). It is noted that the calcination at 550 °C caused phase transformation from the TiO2(B) to anatase phase (tetragonal, space group I41/amd, ICDD PDF no. 21-1272) in a small fraction (ca. 3%, calculated according to the equation in ref. 7) of the fibres. This conversion took place only at the surface of the N-doped nanofibres, yielding anatase nanoplates covering the fibres (Fig. 1A). The electron diffraction pattern of BF still shows a typical TiO2(B) feature (Fig. 1B). It can be deduced, through the FFT and IFFT treatment of the HRTEM image of BF NFs (Fig. 1C–E), that the direction [10]B is parallel to [111]A, where “A” and “B” represent anatase and TiO2(B), respectively. This is a typical orientation relationship between TiO2(B) and anatase phases correlated by diffusional phase transformation of monoclinic structure to body-centred tetragonal structure.40 There is a good planar match between anatase nanoplates and TiO2(B) nanofibre, with (011)A parallel to (200)B (both of the sharing a similar planar spacing of 0.35 nm). Therefore, the exposed surfaces of the nanofibres are mainly anatase (100) facets. The anatase nanoplates are bonded solidly to the TiO2(B) fibre substrate by chemical bonds (sharing the oxygen atoms at the interface between the two phases).

(E) The IFFT image derived from FFT image showed the lattice fringes of two phases which are coincident well with anatase and TiO2(B). 
As can been seen clearly from the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. S5A†), after nitrogen doping, the light absorption extends to the visible range for N–BF NFs. This is caused by partial substitution of O atoms for N atoms on the surface and in the bulk of TiO2 structure resulting in reduction of the band gap of the material and a red shift of light absorption by the solid.13,22 Similar increase in baseline after nitrogen doping was observed in the previous literature.22,41 This could be explained by the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ by H2 released from NH3 during calcination.22 The background was reduced rapidly after the N-doped sample was calcination in air. With the increment of the N content, the intensity of the absorption in the visible light region becomes stronger. Except for the surface N content, both –NHx groups and –OH groups exist on the surface of the N-doped sample, confirmed by IR spectra (Fig. S5B†). The calcination of N–BF in air caused the loss of N content from the bulk and surface structure, leading to decreased absorption in the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. S5A†).41
3.2 Photocatalytic performance on different surfaces
To investigate the influence of the surface property on the reaction activity, two oxidation reactions, the aerobic oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, were chosen and the activity of TiO2 fibres with different surfaces were examined under light irradiation. In this study, no conversion was observed in the absence of TiO2 nanofibres under light irradiation which confirms that the reactions are catalysed by TiO2 nanofibres.
The photocatalytic performances of TiO2 (BF) and N-doped TiO2 (N–BF, N–BF-A20, and N–BF-A180) NFs for the aerobic oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol are illustrated in Fig. 2. The N–BF NFs exhibited much lower activity (conversion at 60%) for the selective oxidation of benzylamine to N-benzylbenzaldimine, compared to the nanofibres calcined in air (91% conversion for BF). After N–BF was calcined in air for 20 and 180 min, the conversion rate gradually increased to 89% and 97%. A similar situation is also observed for the selective oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde under Xe light illumination using these nanofibres: the conversions on BF, N–BF, N–BF-A20 and N–BF-A180 are 96%, 60%, 96% and 99% respectively. Following the calcination in air at 550 °C (N–BF-A20 and N–BF-A180), the doped N sites on the external surface of the nanofibres were replaced by O and thus the O2 adsorption and catalytic activity was regenerated. It is deduced that the oxidised surface is advanced for the aerobic oxidation reactions and therefore BF and N–BF NFs with different surfaces were compared in the following study. Various amine derivatives were examined in the selective photocatalytic oxidation and the imine products were the main product. The results were summarised in Table S2.† The derivative compounds with electron donation groups (–CH3 and CH3O–) and with electron withdrawing group (–Cl) all show high selectivity of their corresponding imines but the conversion rates were slight affected by the substituents on the benzylic amines. Phenethylamine exhibits low conversion and poor selectivity which can be attributed to the unselective autoxidation caused by the activation of multiple reactive sites.36

Reaction conditions: 0.2 mmol reactant, 50 mg catalyst, 5 ml acetonitrile, 1 atm O2, 40 °C, reaction time at 5 h and light intensity at 0.45 W cm−2 (LED white light) for the oxidation of benzylamine, 4 h and 1 W cm−2 (Xe light) for the oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol. 
The dependence of the conversion of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol on the intensity of light irradiation catalysed by BF and N–BF NFs shows that the conversion increases almost linearly as the irradiance is raised (Fig. 3A and 4A). Comparative experiments in the dark were also carried out and no conversions were observed. It is clearly demonstrated that the oxidation of benzylamine/4-methoxybenzyl alcohol is driven by light.

As shown in Fig. S5A,† the N doped nanofibres exhibit much stronger light absorption than the undoped counterpart in the visible range. This increased adsorption can be attributed to the new hybridization states formed at the top of the valence band that originate from nitrogen 2p states and oxygen 2p states or the mid-gap level created by the introduction of N.13,17,41 However, this absorption does not appear to be the sole factor determining the photocatalytic activity under visible light. It can be seen from Fig. 3B that the oxidation activity of benzylamine on BF is superior to that on N–BF in the visible light irradiation range which cannot be explained by the ability of light absorption. Consequently, this implies that the activity under visible light may not only depend on the band structure of TiO2 in the present study. It is interesting to find that the adsorption of benzylamine or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol on BF or N–BF NFs causes a wavelength absorption extension into the visible range in the UV-Vis spectra (Fig. S6†). Pure benzylamine only absorbs light below 300 nm and bare anatase TiO2 absorbs light below 387.5 nm.42 Hence, the enhanced light absorption might reasonably be attributed to a complex formed by the interaction of benzylamine with the TiO2 surface.36,42–44 A surface complex can potentially adsorb light and inject an electron from the N localised on the amide nitrogen into the conduction band of TiO2 under light illumination using longer wavelengths, which is a so called ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) mechanism.45,46 It is therefore likely that activities in the visible range are related to surface complexes formed on the BF and N–BF surfaces.47 Then the action spectra of these two reactions on BF and N–BF NFs were studied (Fig. 3B and 4B). The light source was a Xe lamp fitted with optical band pass filters and irradiance intensity reaching the reaction system was maintained at 0.035 W cm−2. The results clearly show that the activity gradually decreased with the increasing irradiation wavelength. The conversion of the reactants as a function of the wavelength of the incident light (action spectra) does not match with the UV-Vis spectra of bare BF and N–BF NFs (Fig. S6†). And the two reactions are responsive to light up to 520 nm, which is much smaller than the band gap absorption of TiO2 (band gap at 3.2 eV, corresponding to absorption at 387.5 nm). The differential spectra between before and after reactant adsorption are also plotted in the action spectra (Fig. 3B and 4B). New absorption bands appeared at about 350 nm with long tail up to 450 nm which could be reasonably ascribed to the surface complexes. When the reaction temperature was increased from 40 to 60 °C (Fig. S7†), the aerobic oxidation activities were enhanced greatly in the UV region (wavelength shorter than 400 nm) but only a little in the visible range. In Fig. 4B, N–BF NFs show a better catalytic activity than BF NFs in the oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in the visible light irradiation range while BF NFs show higher activity than N–BF NFs both in the UV and visible light irradiation range in the oxidation of benzylamine as shown in Fig. 3B. In the present study, the O2 adsorption and light absorption would both combine to determine the reaction activity for a given, fixed reaction temperature, the light intensity and wavelength. As suggested by the DFT results (stated latter) and UV-Vis spectra (Fig. S5A†), BF exhibits higher O2 adsorption ability but weaker visible light absorption. The same trend was observed in the UV and visible range when BF and N–BF were applied to the selective oxidation of benzylamine. It is deduced that O2 adsorption plays the dominant role in this oxidation. On the other hand, the strong light absorption of N–BF in the visible range is supposed to be the crucial factor that affects the 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol oxidation reaction in the visible range.
The reaction kinetic data obtained at various temperatures (25, 40 and 60 °C) for the oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol using BF and N–BF NFs under UV and visible light irradiation are summarised in Fig. 3C and D and 4C and D. Both reactions exhibit a typical zero-order kinetic reaction character. The reaction rate increased gradually when the reaction temperature was increased from 25 to 60 °C. Generally, the recombination rate in a semiconductor photocatalyst increases with temperate leading to a decrease in the reaction rate.48 The result observed here further confirms that the complex-route works by a different mechanism. The reaction rate constants of the oxidation of benzylamine on BF at 25, 40 and 60 °C under UV light irradiation (from 320 to 415 nm) are 2.17 × 10−6 mol L−1 s−1, 3.14 × 10−6 mol L−1 s−1 and 3.64 × 10−6 mol L−1 s−1, calculated from the slope by plotting the conversion against the reaction time. While visible light irradiation (>420 nm) can also drive the aerobic oxidation of benzylamine but in a much lower rate (3.33 × 10−7 mol L−1 s−1 at 25 °C, 5.28 × 10−7 mol L−1 s−1 at 40 °C and 8.89 × 10−7 mol L−1 s−1 at 60 °C, respectively). Benzylamine was converted to N-benzylbenzaldimine with a very high selectivity (>95%) regardless of the reaction temperature. Benzaldehyde was also detected in the product during the reaction which may indicate that benzaldehyde is the intermediate product and converts to imine through condensation reaction with another benzylamine molecule.44 The conversions of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol over BF were also carried out (Fig. 4C and D). The trend of this reaction was observed as that of oxidation of benzylamine. The higher the reaction temperature, the faster the oxidation reaction proceeded. The estimated apparent activation energy (Ea) for the oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol under UV light and visible light irradiation was displayed in Table S3.† It is observed that when the aerobic reactions were carried out under different light irradiation range, the activation energy of the corresponding reaction under UV light and visible light irradiation on N–BF were very close to each other (17 kJ mol−1 vs. 15 kJ mol−1 for oxidation of benzylamine, 14 kJ mol−1 vs. 14 kJ mol−1 for oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in the UV range and visible range). The light wavelength has an obvious influence on Ea for the aerobic oxidation reactions on BF. The estimated apparent activation energy is 12 kJ mol−1 for benzylamine under UV-light irradiation, while it is 23 kJ mol−1 under visible light irradiation. It was reported that the apparent activation energy for the selective oxidation of benzylamine to N-benzylbenzaldimine on Au–Pd@ZrO2 catalyst in the dark and under visible light irradiation was 131.5 and 118.4 kJ mol−1, respectively.49 Therefore, the photocatalytic reaction for the oxidation of benzylamine on TiO2 nanofibres has smaller activation energy and can proceed readily.
From the above analysis, the activity does not originate from charge separation in the TiO2 with subsequent interaction with the reactants. This indicates that the TiO2 nanofibres' surface chemistry could play an important and alternative role in the catalytic process, so investigation of the interaction between the reactant molecules with the nanofibres was undertaken. Both of the benzylamine oxidation reaction and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol oxidation involve the adsorption of the molecule and O2. Recently we have found that the anatase surface has a strong ability to generate surface hydroxyl groups.29 Liu et al.50 found that the –OH groups at the (110) surface of anatase TiO2 can facilitate O2 adsorption on TiO2, and such absorbed O2 may diffuse to the active site for reactions. Therefore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to explore O2 adsorption properties on N-doped and undoped TiO2 surfaces in order to determine the importance of surface –OH groups in the photocatalysis process with these materials.
3.3 Investigation of surface O2 adsorption by density functional theory (DFT) calculation
The perfect (100) surface of anatase TiO2 was considered as the first case in this work. The results showed that O2 is hardly adsorbed on the (100) surface with an optimised adsorption energy of only 0.03 eV. With one –OH bound on the surface as shown in Fig. 5a, the adsorption energy increases slightly to 0.16 eV. Both experimental and theoretical investigations51–55 showed that a H2O molecule can be adsorbed by an oxygen vacancy on the TiO2 surface, and then dissociate to two adjacent –OH groups. Based on this dissociate to two adjacent –OH groups. Based on this knowledge, the adsorption of O2 on the TiO2 surface with two adjacent –OH groups were considered as shown in Fig. 5b and c. In Fig. 5b, the O2 molecule was adsorbed on Ti atoms nearby the –OH groups. The calculated adsorption energy was 0.90 eV and the bond length of O2 increased to 1.42 Å, significantly longer than the free O2 molecule (1.23 Å) and the O2 (1.33 Å) in Fig. 5a. The O–Ti distance is in a range of 1.90 to 1.93 Å, which is shorter than that in Fig. 5a. Both the O2 bond length and O–Ti distance indicate that the O2 in Fig. 5b is adsorbed more strongly by the TiO2 surface than that in Fig. 5a. These results show that pairs of –OH groups can facilitate O2 adsorption on the TiO2 (100) surface. This result extends on the study by Liu et al.50 who found that the –OH groups at the (110) surface of rutile TiO2 can facilitate O2 adsorption on TiO2. Another interesting question to be answered is whether the –OH effects on O2 adsorption a long-ranged interaction. For demonstration purposes, one situation was considered in Fig. 5c with O2 is located further from the –OH site than the model in Fig. 5b. The calculated adsorption energy was 0.78 eV, only slightly lower than that of Fig. 5b. Liu et al. had also performed a detailed investigation showing that –OH group on TiO2(110) possesses a long-range effect on O2 adsorption.
 Fig. 5  The optimized structures of anatase TiO2(100) surface (top view). (a–c) O2 adsorption on TiO2(100) surface with one –OH group; (d–f) O2 adsorption on TiO2(100) surface with –OH and –NH2 groups; (g and h) O2 adsorption on TiO2(100) surface with two –OH groups and N replaced O on the surface. O, N, H and Ti atoms are marked in red, blue, green and grey. 
In our experiment, both O–H and N–H vibrations were observed in IR spectrum (Fig. S5†). We hypothesise that when a NH3 molecule is captured by an oxygen vacancy on the TiO2 surface, as occurred for H2O, it dissociates to one –NH2 group and an adjacent –OH group. Three O2 adsorption styles were considered as formed on N-doped TiO2(100) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 5d–f. In Fig. 5d, O2 is adsorbed on two Ti atoms in a bridged form with an adsorption energy of 0.84 eV. The O2 bond length is 1.41 Å and Ti–O distance is about 1.91–1.92 Å, which are both similar to the situation in Fig. 5e and f. This result indicates that replacement of one –OH by –NH2 does not significantly impact O2 adsorption on the TiO2(100) surface. In Fig. 5e and f, O2 is adsorbed at different Ti atoms sites. The calculated adsorption energies are 0.91 and 1.11 eV, respectively. The adsorption energies in all these three situations are on the same order as that on the TiO2 surface with a pair of –OH groups as shown in Fig. 5b and c. Hence, the lower activity of the N-doped TiO2, observed in our experiment is unlikely to be caused by this type of surface structures of the doped nitrogen atom as we reported in the previous study.41
It is reasonable to assume that when the titanate is reacted with NH3 to give a N-doped TiO2 nano-structure, the nitrogen atoms may replace some three-coordinated oxygen atoms on the TiO2 surface as shown in Fig. 5g and h. In Fig. 5g, a nitrogen atom replaces an oxygen atom nearby the –OH groups, and in Fig. 5h, it replaces an oxygen atom a short distance from the –OH groups. Interesting calculation results were obtained for the both of the surface structures and O2 adsorption energies markedly decreased in each case. The calculated adsorption energies associated with Fig. 5g and h were 0.15 and 0.05 eV, respectively. In Fig. 5g the Ti–O distances were 2.17 Å and 2.23 Å, while the O2 bond length was 1.33 Å. In Fig. 5h, the shortest Ti–O distance was 3.83 Å and the O2 bond length was 1.23 Å. These calculations show that when three-coordinated oxygen atoms are substituted by nitrogen atoms, the O2 adsorption energy around the nitrogen site will be reduced considerably. The work of Liu et al.50 indicates that O2 adsorption and supply play an important role in the reaction on the TiO2 surface. The small adsorption energy indicates that O2 will desorb readily from the surface in the vicinity of such doped nitrogen sites. The lower activity of the N-doped TiO2 surface in the oxidation reaction involving O2 is highly likely due to the weak O2 adsorption ability of such doped-in nitrogen atoms.
3.4 FT-IR observation of surface adsorbed species and the change during photoirradiation
For the benzylamine oxidation reaction, the surface adsorption of the reactant was studied by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. 6). After exposing to benzylamine vapour at 25 Pa, the intensity of band at 1585 cm−1 increased with time on both BF and N–BF (Fig. 6A and C). And this band was attributed to the NH2 bending vibration (δsNH2).56 Furthermore, the bands at 1142 and 1069 cm−1 for BF and 1157 and 1065 cm−1 for N–BF assigned to C–N stretching vibration (νC–N) increased with time. The same tendency was observed for the bands at 1381 and 1454 cm−1 for BF and 1374 and 1454 cm−1 for N–BF corresponding to CH2 bending vibrations, and the ones at 1499 and 1543 cm−1 for both BF and N–BF attributed to C–C stretching vibrations of an aromatic ring.56 The observations obtained from the in situ IR spectra revealed that benzylamine adsorbed on the surface of BF and N–BF in the form of molecules.
 Fig. 6  Time course in situ FT-IR spectra of BF (A and B) and N–BF (C and D) NFs after expose to benzylamine vapour at 25 Pa and after irradiation under a dry air atmosphere. FT-IR spectra of benzaldehyde adsorbed on BF and N–BF are compared (red curve in B and D). The green curves in the upper part of (B) and (D) stand for evacuation for 30 min after irradiation for 90 min. 
After benzylamine was adsorbed in situ on BF and N–BF, dry air was introduced into the in situ IR cell and followed by irradiation with Xe lamp for various period of time. The changes in FT-IR spectra during the irradiation process were recorded as shown in Fig. 6B and D. The spectra given in Fig. 6B and D are difference spectra, where positive peaks indicate newly-formed products and negative peaks indicate consumed reactants. The black arrows shows the bands related to νC–N (1061 cm−1), ωCH2 (1350 cm−1), δsCH2 (1457 cm−1), νC–C (1499 cm−1), and δsNH2 (1615 and 1578 cm−1), which belong to benzylamine,45 decreased in intensity with increasing irradiation time. In order to confirm the newly-formed bands, benzaldehyde was adsorbed on BF and N–BF in situ (Fig. 6B and D). The bands at 1651, 1530 and 1414 cm−1 are attributed to νCO, νC–C(aromatic), and δsCHO,56 which clearly show that benzaldehyde was formed during the benzylamine conversion (Fig. 6B and D). After irradiation, the system was evacuated for another 30 min and the FT-IR spectra do not change much, which means benzaldehyde were still adsorbed on catalysts after the evacuation.
The similar in situ IR experimental procedure was carried out for the reaction of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol. After exposing to 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol at 25 Pa, the bands growing in at 1612, 1512, 1456, 1302, 1252, 1229, 1177 (or 1179) and 1042 cm−1 on BF and N–BF (Fig. 7A and D) are similar to the previous literature.57 The bands at 1612, 1512 and 1456 cm−1 are ascribed to skeletal vibrations of the aromatic and the band at 1229 cm−1 can be assigned to the C–C stretching vibration.58 The two bands centred at 1252 and 1042 cm−1 correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric C–O–C stretching vibration of the methoxy group attached to benzene ring.56 Another band appears at 1137 cm−1 for BF and 1164 cm−1 for N–BF, which was not observed in the previous ATR-FTIR study of the adsorption of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol.57 It is likely to assign this band to the alcoholate species formed by the interaction between the surface Ti and the adsorbed 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol.30,58 Thus, according to the observed changes of IR bands, it is suggested that 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol adsorbed on the surface of BF and N–BF and the –CH2–OH group would interact with Ti to form alcoholate species –CH2–O(H)–Ti.
 Fig. 7  Time course in situ FT-IR spectra of BF (A and B) and N–BF (C and D) NFs after expose to 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol vapour at 25 Pa and after irradiation under a dry air atmosphere. FT-IR spectra of 4-methoxybenzaldehyde adsorbed on BF and N–BF are compared (red curve in B and D). The green curves in the upper part of (B) and (D) stand for evacuation for 30 min after irradiation for 90 min. 
After introducing dry air, the sample after 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol adsorption was illuminated with Xe light (Fig. 7B and D). As irradiation continues, the bands related to reactant 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol,57 such as 1612, 1512, 1456 (skeletal vibrations of the aromatic) and 1252 cm−1 (asymmetric C–O–C stretching vibration) decreased in intensity. In the meantime, some newly-formed bands were also observed during the irradiation as marked by the red arrows in Fig. 7. The positions of the newly-formed bands are in good agreement with those of the 4-methoxybenzaldehyde adsorbed on BF and N–BF. Specifically, the typical bands of 4-methoxybenzaldehyde related to the νCO (1655 cm−1), νC–C(aromatic) (1603, 1576 and 1512 cm−1), and δsCHO (1400 cm−1) are observed.56
3.5 Proposed mechanism
BF and N–BF exhibit a better activity for the oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol under UV irradiation which correlates well with the light absorption ability. The N–BF NFs exhibited a stronger absorption in the visible range compared to BF, but N–BF exhibited a weak activity compared to BF for the oxidation of benzylamine. This indicates that the activity in the visible range is not directly related to the light absorption. In addition, the O2 adsorption ability is different: BF has a stronger ability for the adsorption of O2. In order to further clarify the importance of O2 in the selective oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, similar oxidation experiments were carried out in the absence of O2. Only negligible conversions of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (reactant conversion less than 3%) at 25 °C for BF and N–BF were observed and the poor catalytic activities showed no improvement even after raising the temperature to 60 °C. However, when the reactor was re-exposed to O2 after eliminating gas from the reaction system, the reactivity recovered. Additionally, the colour of the catalyst changed to dusty blue which confirms the formation of Ti3+ centers.59 This indicates without O2 involving in the reaction system, Ti4+ acted as the electron acceptor instead of O2 and itself was reduced to Ti3+. The intact catalytic cycle could not be completed without the further oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+. Thus, taking these results into consideration, O2 is indispensable in the photo-oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in this study. Therefore, O2 adsorption and activation on the surface is the key step of oxidation reactions which determining the reaction rate. To investigate the intermediates formed during reaction, the EPR technique was introduced with DMPO as the spin trapper. Fig. S8† clearly shows the EPR signal of DMPO-OO(H) (partially decomposed to DMPO-OH),60 which indicates the presence of O2˙− radicals.
Based on the above analysis and previous reported results, we tentatively propose a mechanism depicted in Fig. 8. For the aerobic oxidation of benzylamine, firstly, the reactant benzylamine is adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 nanofibres to form surface charge transfer complex. Secondly, hole and electron would be generated on the surface charge transfer complex under light illumination. The photo-generated hole induces the H+ subtraction form N of benzylamine and photo-generated electron transfers to the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in the formation of an amide radical and the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. The nitrogen-centred radical would rearrange via intramolecular H-abstraction to form a more stable carbon-centred radical.61,62 The following steps are analogous as previous investigations reported by Zhao, et al.35,36,44,63 Thirdly, O2 is adsorbed on the surface of catalysts and is converted to O2˙− by the electron in the conduction band of TiO2 (Ti3+ site), which forms an intermediate possessed five-member-ring structure with carbon radical and Ti4+. Fourthly, the cleavage of the C–N bond of benzylamine and the O–O bond of oxygen occurs to form benzaldehyde and a Ti-bonded three-member-ring structure. The produced benzaldehyde then further follows a condensation reaction with unreacted benzylamine to yield imine. Finally, the photocatalytic cycle are completed by the regeneration of Ti4+ sites on the surface of BF and N–BF NFs through desorption of NH2–OH molecule. The selective photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol on BF and N–BF NFs is supposed to follow the similar pathway (Fig. 8B).

4. Conclusions
We have demonstrated that the nitrogen doping induced surface structure change on TiO2 NFs can result in a poor ability to adsorb O2 molecules compared to undoped TiO2 NFs according to the DFT calculation. The surface structures have profound effect on the photocatalytic oxidation performance: the N-doped TiO2 NFs exhibited a lower activity for the oxidation of benzylamine and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol compared to undoped TiO2 under full spectrum Xe light irradiation and a controlled calcination of the N-doped NFs in air is necessary to restore the anatase surface for activation of oxygen molecules, which indicates that the O2 activation process is the rate determining process. The influence of light intensity, irradiation wavelength and reaction temperature on the activity of the aerobic oxidation reactions were investigated and it is found that the activity showed gradual increase as the irradiance intensity increased, the wavelength shortened and the temperature increased. All the samples exhibited higher activity under UV light irradiation. Furthermore, we found that although the N-doped NFs exhibits better light absorption in the visible light range, the activity of N-doped TiO2 is lower for the selective oxidation of benzylamine compared to undoped samples under visible light irradiation. This demonstrates that the light absorption ability may not be the key factor towards a high photoactivity. These results of this study not only demonstrate the great impact of surface properties of the TiO2 NFs on their photocatalytic performance, but also reveal that tuning the surface structure of photocatalysts could be an effective method to optimise the photocatalytic activities for synthesis of fine organic chemicals.
