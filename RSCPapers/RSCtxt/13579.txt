    , Accepted 29th October 2015First published on 29th October 2015AbstractPhoto-excitation intensity dependent electron and hole injections from CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite to nanocrystalline TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD are presented with the electron injection yield decrease from 95% to 10% and the hole injection yield decrease from 99% to 50% by increasing the excitation intensity from 10 nJ cm−2 to 50 μJ cm−2.
Lead halide perovskite solar cells have been recognized as newly emerging solar cells with the potential of achieving high efficiency with low cost fabrication processes. In particular, facile solution processed cell fabrication facilitated rapid development of the optimum cell structure and composition. Over the last few years, the cell efficiency has sharply increased, and now exceeds 20%.1
Based on previous intensive studies, high efficiency has been achieved by two different film structures: planar heterojunction2 and mesoporous structures.3,4 The latter typically consists of a nanocrystalline TiO2 film, lead halide perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD. Several studies were conducted to understand the dynamics of electron and hole injections from the perovskite.5–11 However, the reported electron injection rate varies from ∼1 ps to 9 ns,5,6,8–12 and the hole injection occurs at time constants from ∼1 ps to 16 ns.6,7,9,11 These charge separated states have not been quantitatively analysed with charge recombination dynamics. Recent reports have revealed that the perovskite excited state lifetime decreases with an increase in excitation intensity,5,13–15 which may influence charge separation processes. Furthermore, the role of the TiO2 film has not explicitly been clarified. Snaith et al. reported that employing an insulator nanostructure, Al2O3, results in higher conversion efficiency compared to the TiO2 film.3 Clarifying these points is extremely important to understand the charge transfer mechanisms of such films to further improve solar cell performance. Here, we employ a series of transient absorption and emission spectroscopies to quantitatively assess electron injection from the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite to TiO2, hole injection to a spiro-OMeTAD layer, and their recombination, and to clarify the role of the TiO2 film.
In this study, we employ 4 different samples, (1) CH3NH3PbI3 deposited on a TiO2 nanoporous film on a glass substrate (TiO2-MAPbI3), (2) a spiro-OMeTAD layer deposited on top of TiO2-MAPbI3 (TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD), (3) CH3NH3PbI3 deposited on an Al2O3 nanoporous film on a glass substrate (Al2O3-MAPbI3), and (4) an OMeTAD layer deposited on top of Al2O3-MAPbI3 (Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD). The structure of TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD is shown in Fig. 1a,16 and the photo of the film is shown in the inset of Fig. 1b. The film preparation details are provided in the ESI.† Note that using the identical film preparation procedure, we have achieved a solar energy conversion efficiency of 14.5% under the AM1.5G one sun condition (100 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). However, for this study, to homogeneously excite CH3NH3PbI3 inside the metal oxide nanopore, we employed a 2.8 μm thick TiO2 film and a 3.0 μm thick Al2O3 film. To obtain low light absorbance, lower precursor concentration (PbI2: 0.2 M) was employed to deposit CH3NH3PbI3. Fig. 1b compares absorption spectra; the absorbance difference may originate from the difference in the surface area between TiO2 and Al2O3 films. SEM images and X-ray diffraction patterns for Al2O3-MAPbI3 and TiO2-MAPbI3 are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). These observations suggest that the morphology and crystal structure of MAPbI3 are not influenced by the type of metal oxide nanostructure. Dependence of charge separation/recombination dynamics on the thickness of the metal oxide film and perovskite layer will be reported elsewhere.

Excitation intensity dependent transient emission decays (0.01–50 μJ cm−2) were observed by nanosecond transient emission spectroscopy. Fig. 2a shows emission decays for Al2O3-MAPbI3. The excitation wavelength of 625 nm was selected, not to excite PbI2 (∼550 nm),8 if PbI2 remains in the perovskite layer. Since Al2O3 is an insulator, the data indicate that the perovskite excited state decays. Clearly, the excited state lifetime decreased with the increase of the excitation intensity, in agreement with the previous reports.5,11,13–15
 Fig. 2  (a) Excitation intensity dependence of transient emission decays obtained for Al2O3-MAPbI3 with 625 nm excitation. The solid line indicates a result of fitting with a rate equation (eqn (1)). The number indicates excitation intensity (unit: μJ cm−2). (b) Comparison of transient emission decays obtained for Al2O3-MAPbI3 and TiO2-MAPbI3 with an excitation intensity of 50 nJ cm−2 (625 nm excitation). The solid line indicates a result of fitting with eqn (1) and eqn (S3) (ESI†), respectively. (c) Comparison of effective lifetimes obtained for Al2O3-MAPbI3 and TiO2-MAPbI3. (d) Excitation intensity dependence on electron injection yield. 
The data were analysed by a rate equation,13,15 (1)where n is the photo-excited charge carrier density, k1 is the rate constant of trap state mediated recombination, k2 is the rate constant of electron–hole recombination, and t is the time. Using eqn (1), the fitted results are shown as a solid line in Fig. 2a, indicating that this kinetic model agrees with the data. Similar to the previous report,15 the second order component dominates to fit the decay data obtained with an excitation intensity of >0.2 μJ cm−2, implying that non-geminate electron–hole recombination occurs within a perovskite layer.5,13,15 We have conducted global analysis for all decays using eqn (1). The resulting first order (k1) and second order (k2) rate constants are 5.6 × 106 s−1 and 4.2 × 10−10 s−1 cm3, respectively. This second order rate constant is similar to those reported for flat perovskite films,13,15 suggesting that a nanoporous structure of the Al2O3 film does not influence the excited state dynamics.
Excitation intensity dependent photoluminescence decays were also observed for TiO2-MAPbI3 (Fig. S4a, ESI†). Fig. 2b shows comparison of transient emission decays obtained with 50 nJ cm−2. The decay has clearly been accelerated for TiO2-MAPbI3 owing to the faster electron injection rate. However this acceleration is diminished when the intensity is increased. Fig. S4b (ESI†) compares transient decays obtained with 2.3 μJ cm−2.
Since the excited state decay has first and second order components, it is not simple to evaluate the lifetime. Here, we define an effective lifetime, τ1/e,13 as IPL(τ1/e) = IPL(0)/e, where IPL(τ1/e) is the photoluminescence intensity at time τ after the excitation. The intensity dependent effective lifetimes are shown in Fig. 2c. An intensity increase from 0.01 to 50 μJ cm−2 has accelerated excited state decay from 180 to 5 ns for Al2O3-MAPbI3. With low excitation intensity (<0.1 μJ cm−2), the difference in lifetimes between the TiO2 and Al2O3 films is nearly one order of magnitude, while the lifetimes are similar with >1 μJ cm−2. Following these data, the electron injection rate has been estimated to be 11 ± 1 ns, using eqn (S6) and (S7) and fitted with eqn (S3) (ESI†). This injection rate is significantly slower than those reported using femtosecond transient absorption and terahertz spectroscopies (from 200 fs to several tens of picoseconds).5,6,11 In contrast, a slow (∼700 ps) or no injection component was also observed.7,8,10,12 This difference may originate from the difference in excitation energy (wavelength) or multi-phasic electron injection processes, i.e. more than 3 components over fs–ns time scales, similar to dye sensitised TiO2 films.17 Recently, Douhal et al. reported an ultrafast electron injection component (200 fs) with 460 and 580 nm excitation, however no injection was observed by exciting close to the band edge at 750 nm,11 suggesting that low excitation energy (longer wavelength) may significantly lower an electron injection rate. We have also conducted excitation intensity dependent transient absorption measurements (4–120 μJ cm−2) to directly observe the injected electrons in TiO2 over 1000–2500 nm. However, as discussed later, no clear amplitude was observed, in agreement with the recent report.6
Intensity dependent electron injection yields were calculated using eqn (S8) (ESI†), and are shown in Fig. 2d. With an intensity of <0.1 μJ cm−2, the yield exceeds 90%, in agreement with the quenching efficiency of the photoluminescence data (Fig. S3a, ESI†). In contrast, a gradual decrease was observed with the increase of the excitation intensity. The yield decreased up to 10% (with 50 μJ cm−2). Under the AM1.5G one sun condition, visible light of approximately 50 nJ cm−2 is irradiated to a solar cell every 1 μs, suggesting that more than 90% of electron injection occurs in the solar cell based on TiO2-MAPbI3.
The hole injection process from the perovskite valence band to the OMeTAD is next assessed by comparing photoluminescence data between Al2O3-MAPbI3 and Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD. Fig. S3b (ESI†) shows comparison of steady state photoluminescence data, indicating significant quenching by coating an OMeTAD layer. The calculated quenching efficiency, i.e. a hole injection yield, is 96%, suggesting that a hole injection is extremely fast compared to the perovskite excited state lifetime. Excitation intensity dependent hole injection dynamics were observed by comparing photoluminescence decays, shown in Fig. 3a. For both excitation intensities of 20 nJ cm−2 and 2.3 μJ cm−2, clear decay acceleration was observed for Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD, confirming the swift hole injection.
 Fig. 3  (a) Comparison of transient photoluminescence decays obtained for Al2O3-MAPbI3 and Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD (625 nm excitation). The solid line indicates a result of fitting with eqn (1) and eqn (S4) (ESI†), respectively. The number indicates excitation intensity (unit: μJ cm−2). (b) Excitation intensity dependence on hole injection yield. 
The intensity dependent hole injection yield was calculated using eqn (S10), and is shown in Fig. 3b. With relatively low intensity (<100 nJ cm−2), the yield reaches nearly 100%. The intensity increase decreases a yield up to 50% (with 50 μJ cm−2). Following these data, the hole injection rate is estimated to be 1.8 ± 0.2 ns. This value almost agrees with the reported values.14 Note that this hole injection rate probably indicates the slowest time, since the time resolution of our spectroscopy is limited to 1.2 ns (FWHM). Similar to the electron injection, a wide range of rate constants (200 fs–700 ps) for the hole injection were reported.6,7,11,14 The variation may originate from the multi-phasic dynamics or difference in sample preparation influencing energy levels of OMeTAD to the MAPbI3 valence band edge.
We now turn to the assessment of the charge separated state and recombination dynamics observed by Vis-NIR transient absorption (TA) spectroscopies. TA spectra at 2 μs after 625 nm excitation for TiO2-MAPbI3 and Al2O3-MAPbI3 are shown in Fig. 4a. The residual emission from the excited state was observed at 700–900 nm. If the electron injection occurs for TiO2-MAPbI3, we could expect to observe a positive amplitude at 1000–2500 nm, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The TA spectrum of the N3 sensitised TiO2 film (Fig. S5b, ESI†) indicates a positive amplitude of 0.1 mΔOD at 2500 nm (excitation intensity: 120 μJ cm−2), assigned to TA by electrons in TiO2.18 Using this value and the intensity dependent electron injection yield (Fig. 2d), the estimated amplitude of absorption by electron for TiO2-MAPbI3 is approximately 0.5–5 μΔOD at 2500 nm over 4–120 μJ cm−2 excitation. Such a small amplitude can be buried in noise in our spectrometer.
 Fig. 4  Vis-NIR TA spectra obtained at 2 μs after 625 nm (excitation: 120 μJ cm−2) excitation for TiO2-MAPbI3 and Al2O3-MAPbI3 (a) and for TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD and Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD (b). The dotted line in (b) indicates addition of the spectrum of the OMeTAD oxidized state and that of absorption by the accumulated electrons in TiO2 created spectroelectrochemically (see Fig. S5, ESI†). (c) TA decays obtained for TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD and Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD, monitored at 1600 nm (excitation intensity: 120 μJ cm−2). The solid line indicates a result of stretched exponential fitting. 
TA spectra were also observed for TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD and Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD (Fig. 4b). The amplitudes with a peak at around 1600 nm were observed, and are similar to the OMeTAD oxidized state shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Therefore, these spectra must indicate charge separated state with a hole at the OMeTAD. The larger amplitude was observed for TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD. Since the data were normalized with the film absorbance at 625 nm, i.e. the number of absorbed photons is identical for TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD and Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD, the difference of the amplitudes must originate from the electron injection from the perovskite into TiO2 (11 ns), following the hole transfer from the perovskite to the OMeTAD (1.8 ns). The charge separated state spectrum with an electron in TiO2 and a hole at the OMeTAD was created spectroelectrochemically (Fig. S6 and Fig. 4b, ESI†), and is similar to the TA spectrum obtained for TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD. Using this spectrum and the charge separated state spectrum of a N3 sensitised TiO2 film (Fig. S5b, ESI†), the estimated electron injection yield is approximately 25%. Comparison of this yield with the intensity dependent electron injection yield shown in Fig. 2d (less than 10% with 120 μJ cm−2) suggests that the increase of the electron injection yield must be assisted by the faster hole injection from the perovskite to the OMeTAD.
Charge recombination dynamics were measured for TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD and Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD. The OMeTAD oxidized state decays monitored at 1600 nm are shown in Fig. 4c. In both cases, the reactions clearly occur over a wide range of time scales from <1 μs to 500 ms. Compared to the charge recombination dynamics observed for the N3 sensitised TiO2 film, shown in Fig. S5c (ESI†), the charge recombination between an electron in the TiO2 conduction band and a hole at the OMeTAD is approximately 20 times slower with an effective lifetime of 5.7 ms (stretched parameter α: 0.42). This is probably owing to the longer distance between the electron and the hole to recombine over the perovskite layer thickness.
The recombination of the hole at the OMeTAD with the electron in the perovskite conduction band appears to occur in even faster time scale (<150 ns, the instrument response). If the hole injection yields are identical for TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD and Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD, about half of holes at the OMeTAD recombine within 150 ns, significantly faster than the recombination between an electron in the TiO2 conduction band and a hole at the OMeTAD. This fast charge recombination supports relatively small TA amplitudes obtained for Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD, shown in Fig. 4b.

Scheme 1 shows an energy level diagram of TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD. Following excitation, first the hole injection from the perovskite to the OMeTAD occurs, and subsequently the electron injection occurs from the perovskite to the TiO2 conduction band. This charge separation mechanism suggests that under the AM1.5G one sun condition, both electron and hole injections occur with almost 100% efficiency, verifying high solar energy conversion efficiency achieved (Fig. S1, ESI†).4
 Scheme 1  Energy level diagram of a TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD film. The energy level of each material was obtained from the previous reports.7,14,20 The perovskite excited state lifetime (5–180 ns) depends upon the excitation intensity. 
As the excitation intensity increases (>10 μJ cm−2), the accelerated excited state decay lowers the electron injection yield. Such a case may suggest that the current film structure (TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD) is not suitable for high power concentrator photovoltaics (>100 sun), although in the presence of OMeTAD, the electron injection yield increases, as the hole injection occurs faster than the excited state decay.
In conclusion, we have identified that accelerated excited state lifetime with increased excitation intensity lowers electron and hole injection yield in TiO2-MAPbI3-OMeTAD. However, under the AM1.5G one sun condition (100 mW cm−2), both electron and hole injections occur with almost 100% efficiency. The charge separated state lifetime was prolonged with the presence of a TiO2 electron acceptor and an OMeTAD hole acceptor, suggesting that their presence indeed supports maximizing solar cell performance. Nevertheless, the efficiency can be improved for solar cells based on Al2O3-MAPbI3-OMeTAD, if the electron transport inside the perovskite and the electron collection are sufficiently faster than the charge recombination process.5,19 This study suggests that the time scale to monitor perovskite excited state dynamics is required to assess electron injection dynamics. A similar electron injection rate (10 ns) was recently observed for the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite deposited TiO2 film.21 Therefore, the similar electron and hole injection mechanisms can be expected for other organometal halide deposited TiO2 films with OMeTAD.
