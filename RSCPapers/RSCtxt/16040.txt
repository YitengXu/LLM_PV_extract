    , Accepted 22nd November 2017First published on 22nd November 2017AbstractIn this work, we study the influence of the distance between electrodes on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells based on TiO2 using the organic dye LEG4 and a Cu(dmp)2 redox couple (dmp = dimethyl phenantroline). The solar cells are characterized by a large open circuit voltage of up to 1.03 V, and an efficiency of 8.2% has been achieved for a 5.3 μm thick TiO2 film using an epoxy resin-based sealed cell configuration with a minimal separation between electrodes. Transient short-circuit photocurrent measurements up to an intensity of 3 Suns show a significant decay in photocurrent after an initial peak current upon switching on the light for larger distance, resulting in a lower steady state photocurrent. For the smaller distance cells, the steady state photocurrent is linear with light intensity up to 2 Suns. Charge extraction measurements under short-circuit conditions show that reducing the distance between electrodes increases the electron collection efficiency and thus, the attainable photocurrent. Recombination losses increase with larger electrode separation distance and higher light intensity due to mass transport limitation of the redox mediator. Electrochemical impedance measurements confirm the effect of electrode distance on the redox couple transport, showing an additional loop with increasing distance. For the configuration where the TiO2 film is in very close proximity to the PEDOT-covered counter electrode, inductive behavior is observed at low frequencies. The inductive behavior disappears with the incorporation of an insulating porous ZrO2 layer. The equivalent circuit for the solar cell has been expanded to include this effect.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) belong to the third generation of solar cells and present interesting advantages for photovoltaic applications such as low cost and simplicity of fabrication, unique design opportunities and excellent performance under low light intensity conditions.1–10 A breakthrough in efficiency reporting 7.1% in 199111 led to a rapidly increasing interest in the development of DSCs. Since then, extensive research has been performed to optimize each individual component of the DSC1,3–6,12–47 and to obtain a deeper understanding in the fundamental mechanisms of the DSCs.1,5,7,25,37,45,46,48–67 All these efforts have led to an increase in efficiency and stability of DSCs, and currently the highest certified efficiency for these cells reaches 11.9 ± 0.4% for a single cell (1 cm2), 10.7 ± 0.4% for a mini-module (7 serial cells, 26.6 cm2) and 8.8 ± 0.3% for a sub-module (26 serial cells, 398.8 cm2).68 In a DSC, a mesoporous, nanostructured layer of a semiconductor, usually TiO2, is sensitized with an organic or inorganic dye. The light is absorbed by the dye, generating electrons that are transferred to the semiconductor layer and collected at the working electrode. The oxidized dye molecule is reduced by the electron-donating species of the redox couple, thus regenerating the dye, and the oxidized component of the redox couple is reduced at the counter electrode. Hence, ideally, this type of solar cell is fully auto-regenerative. A detailed analysis of each of the components of the DSC and recent advances in the development of this technology are provided elsewhere.1–3,10,45 Traditionally, the I−/I3− redox couple is employed,1,5,6,37,69–71 however, the work of Feldt et al.16 showed that implementing an organic dye with high extinction coefficient and bulky ligands could reduce recombination between one-electron outer sphere redox couples and electrons in the mesoporous layer. These results opened the gate for the implementation of alternative redox couples such as cobalt or copper complexes.4,14–27,72 These redox couples exhibit a more positive reduction potential, increasing the attainable photovoltage in the DSC. Yella et al.17 reported an efficiency of 12.3% for a DSC with Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl)-based redox electrolyte, platinum counter electrode and co-sensitization between a porphyrin and organic dye. However, due to the bulky nature of some of these redox couples, mass transport problems mainly in the mesoporous layer, may limit the solar cell performance.16,53,54 It has been suggested that mass transport limitation may also become noticeable when the distance between electrodes is increased.73 Additionally, alternative counter electrodes such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) or graphene-based counter electrodes have proven to be a good fit for DSCs with alternative redox couples due to their stability and low cost.72,74,75 Mathew et al.4 increase the highest reported efficiency of DSCs to 13% by employing a molecularly engineered porphyrin dye, a cobalt-based redox couple and a counter electrode that consisted of graphene nanoplatelets. Working with a PEDOT counter electrode and employing a cobalt-based redox couple, Tsao et al.75 reported efficiencies as high as 10.3%. Employing a copper-based redox couple and PEDOT counter electrode, Freitag et al.9 presented a DSC with a very high power conversion efficiency (28.9% at 1000 lux) under indoor lighting conditions. Extensive work has been done on the development of counter electrodes for DSCs.1,47,74,76–78 An analysis of the stability of counter electrodes in DSCs is beyond the scope of this paper, but the reader is referred to the work of Yun et al.77,79–81 for a detailed description. Recently, the highest efficiency for DSCs has been reported to be 14.3% at 1 Sun illumination, employing a cobalt-based redox couple and a platinum counter electrode.12 In this work, Kakiage et al. presented a DSC where the distance between the electrodes was held to a minimum, thus increasing the fill factor and the overall performance of the solar cells. However, in their configuration the cells are not sealed, and the application of a broad spectrum of characterization methods is complicated.
In this work we study a new configuration for sealed DSCs with the minimum attainable distance between electrodes, based on TiO2 sensitized with the organic dye LEG4, bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenantroline)-copper(I/II) (Cu(dmp)2) as a redox couple and PEDOT as counter electrode. The main focus is to determine the influence of configuration on cell performance through steady-state and time-dependent techniques. The solar cells were characterized via current–voltage (J–V) curves, photocurrent transient measurements, charge extraction measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results are compared for three configurations: Surlyn-sealed cells; (ii) epoxy resin-sealed cells; and (iii) epoxy resin-sealed cells with a ZrO2 separator layer.
Experimental methods
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. DSL 18 NR-T TiO2 paste was purchased from Dyesol (Queanbeyan, Australia). Bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenantroline)-copper(I/II)bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide/chloride (Cu(dmp)2TFSI and Cu(dmp)2TFSI Cl) and the LEG4 sensitizer were purchased from Dyenamo AB (Stockholm, Sweden). Amosil 4R [bisphenol-A-(epichlorhydrin)epoxy resin] and 4H (2,2′-iminodiethylamine) were purchased from Solaronix (Aubonne, Switzerland).
Three different DSCs configurations were prepared in this study, and at least 5 cells were characterized for each configuration:
• Surlyn cells: Standard DSCs with a (5.3 ± 0.3) μm transparent TiO2 mesoporous layer sealed with the thermoplastic polymer Surlyn with a thickness of 30 μm.
• Epoxy–TiO2 cells: DSCs with a (5.3 ± 0.3) μm transparent TiO2 mesoporous layer sealed with epoxy resin.
• Epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 cells: DSCs with a (5.3 ± 0.3) μm transparent TiO2 mesoporous layer, and an additional 0.4 μm ZrO2 insulating porous interlayer sealed with epoxy resin.
Preparation of the working electrodes for DSSCs
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO; TEC 15) was used to prepare the DSC working electrodes. The FTO glass was cleaned in a detergent solution (RBS25, 99%, Fluka) in an ultrasonic bath for 60 minutes, and then rinsed with water. The FTO glass was then submerged sequentially in deionized water and ethanol for 60 minutes in an ultrasonic bath, rinsed with water and dried in air. Once dry, they were submerged in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution and heated to 70 °C for 90 min and then rinsed with water and ethanol. After drying in air, the substrates were screen printed with a dilute Dyesol DSL 18 NR-T TiO2 paste with terpineol and added ethyl cellulose in a 6.0:3.6:0.40 proportion in weight. The screen-printed area was 0.25 cm2. After every deposition step, the electrodes were heated to 120 °C for 6 min and then allowed to cool down to room temperature before they were screen printed again. After screen printing, the electrodes were heat treated in an oven (Nabertherm Controller P320) according to the temperature ramp presented in Fig. S1 in ESI.† After the heat treatment, the electrodes were submerged in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution and heated to 70 °C for 30 min, rinsed with water and ethanol, dried to air and stored. For the epoxy ZrO2 cells, an additional ZrO2 screen printed layer (Sigma-Aldrich nanoparticles dispersion <100 nm particle size, 10 wt% in H2O) was applied after the second TiCl4 treatment. After the deposition of the ZrO2 layer, the electrodes were heat treated again according to the temperature ramp presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). No scattering layer was used in the preparation of any of the DSCs since the scattering layer was not able to withstand the pressure applied to the electrodes. Before sensitization, the working electrodes were heated to 500 °C for 30 min, cooled to 120 °C for 2 h, and then submerged in a dye bath with a concentration of 0.2 mM LEG4 dye in tert-butanol/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). The electrodes remained in the dye bath overnight to allow complete dye uptake. After sensitization, the electrodes were rinsed with acetonitrile and dried in air.
Preparation of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) counter electrodes
PEDOT counter electrodes (≈200 nm) were prepared according to the procedure published by Ellis et al.47 A solution containing 0.1 M of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 0.01 M of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in water was used as the electropolymerization solution. Both compounds were sonicated for 1 hour in order to achieve completely dissolution. Electropolymerization of EDOT was performed with an IviumStar. XR (Ivium Technologies) electrochemical instrument in the galvanostatic mode; a two-electrode cell with a (9 × 6) cm2 conducting glass as counter electrode and a predrilled (5 × 5) cm2 TEC8 FTO on glass as working electrode was used for this purpose, and a constant current of 13 mA was applied for 25 s. After deposition, the electrodes were rinsed with water and ethanol and dried in air.
Sealing of DSSCs
Two different sealing methods were compared in this study. In the first method, the sensitized electrodes and PEDOT counter electrodes were sealed together using a 30 μm thick thermoplastic polymer Surlyn frame. The electrolyte solution was introduced in the cell by vacuum back-filling using the hole predrilled in the PEDOT counter electrode, and the hole was sealed with 60 μm thermoplastic polymer Surlyn and glass coverslips. The second sealing method is depicted in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† A 1:1 (v/v) mixture of Solaronix Amosil 4R [bisphenol-A-(epichlorhydrin)epoxy resin] and 4H (2,2′-iminodiethylamine) was prepared separately (Fig. S2(a), ESI†). The working and counter electrodes were pressed against each other (Fig. S2(b), ESI†) using paper clamps, and the epoxy resin was applied on the edges where the two electrodes meet (Fig. S2(c), ESI†). Once the epoxy resin was applied, the cells were kept under constant pressure (Fig. S2(d), ESI†) and placed inside a desiccator under dark conditions, where the resin cured overnight (Fig. S2(e), ESI†). Once the resin was cured, the cells were filled with the electrolyte solution and the filling holes were sealed with 60 μm thick thermoplastic polymer Surlyn and glass coverslips (Fig. S2(f), ESI†). The composition of the electrolyte solution was 0.2 M Cu(dmp)2TFSI, 0.05 M Cu(dmp)2TFSI/Cl, 0.1 M LiTFSI and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile (TFSI: bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide).
Solar cell characterization
Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were obtained with a Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91160). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) to an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. For the J–V measurements, a black mask of (0.5 × 0.5) cm2 was employed to avoid additional contributions of scattered light in the glass. The cells were kept in the dark under ambient conditions between measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed using a computer controlled electrochemical instrument (AutoLab PGSTAT100) incorporating a frequency response analyzer. EIS measurements were performed under illumination conditions using an AC amplitude of 10 mV in the 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz frequency range. The light intensity was calibrated to match the open circuit potential of the solar cells obtained under 1 Sun illumination. The electrochemical impedance spectrum was analyzed using Z-view software and two different equivalent circuits, one of them proposed by Fabregat-Santiago et al.51,60 and a second one with an additional component proposed in this work. The equivalent circuits are presented in Fig. S3(a) and (b) in the ESI.† Cyclic voltammetry was measured using a GAMRY Reference 3000 potentiostat/galvanostat/ZRA. A three-electrode system was employed to determine the redox potential of the copper-based redox couple, using a solution of 5 mM of Cu(dmp)2TFSI in a 0.1 M TBAPF6 (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate) solution in acetonitrile, with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with a 2 mV step potential, using gold, platinum and Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M) as working, counter and reference electrode, respectively. The redox potential was calibrated versus a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) by the addition of ferrocene as an internal standard, taking E0(Fc/Fc+) = 0.63 V vs. NHE.14,26 Rotating disc electrode (RDE) measurements were employed to determine the diffusion coefficient, using the relationship between angular velocity and limiting current (Levich equation),82 (Fig. S4(a) and (b) in the ESI†). The angular velocities employed in the RDE measurements were 200, 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2200 and 2800 rpm. The revolutions per minute of the gold working electrode were controlled with a Radiometer Analytical CTV101 speed control. Dye loading was estimated from dye desorption measurements. The electrodes were immersed in dye baths with a concentration of 0.2 mM LEG4 in tert-butanol/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). After sensitization, the samples were placed in an alkaline solution consisting of 0.05 M tetra-butyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) in ethanol to desorb the dye. The dye coverage was estimated using the Lambert–Beer law (Fig. S5 and Table S1 in ESI†). The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the desorbed dye solutions were recorded with an Ocean Optics HR2000 spectrometer and a Micropack DH-2000-BAL light source. The thickness of the TiO2 nanoparticulate film was measured using a Dektak3 surface profilometer (Sloan technology). The separation between the electrodes was determined using a micrometer with a ratchet knob, and the average and standard deviation was obtained for each configuration (see ESI† for more details).
Turn-on photocurrent transients were measured under white LED illumination, short circuit conditions and at room temperature. The illumination intensity was calibrated using a certified reference silicon photodiode (Fraunhofer ISE), to produce the same photocurrent as under equivalent 1 Sun AM 1.5 illumination; various intensities were tested, ranging from 0.1 Sun to 3 Suns. Stepped illumination (1 s off, 5 s on and 0.5 s off) was synchronized with data acquisition using a programmable power supply, fast solid state switches and an in-house built data acquisition setup. Additionally, J–V curves were measured at various light intensities (0.1 Sun to 3 Suns), using white LED illumination. The scan rate was 0.1 V s−1 and the voltage step was 10 mV. J–V curves were scanned cyclically from 0 V to 1.2 V forward bias to −0.1 V and back.
Charge extraction transients (Qsc) were obtained by first illuminating the cell under short-circuit conditions, and then switching to dark, monitoring the current collected over time. The resulting current response was then integrated to estimate the excess charge density stored inside the cell.
Results and discussion
Steady-state solar cell performance
Three different cell configurations have been employed in this study. At least five cells for each configuration were prepared. From Fig. 1 the main differences between the different DSC configurations can be appreciated. In Fig. 1(a) a typical DSC configuration, sealed with Surlyn polymer, is presented. In Fig. 1(b) the same DSC structure is used, but the distance between the working and counter electrode has been reduced due to the sealing method. In this configuration, the electrolyte solution is only present in the pores of the mesoporous layer and the redox species travel only through this intricate network. However, there may be direct contact between the mesoporous layer and the counter electrode, which could lead to a shunt. In order to avoid possible shunting of the cell, the third configuration, presented in Fig. 1(c), is employed. In this configuration, an additional insulating layer of mesoporous ZrO2 is applied over the mesoporous TiO2. ZrO2 layers have been applied as an insulating porous spacer layer in DSCs83 and in solid-state DSCs to avoid direct recombination pathways between the TiO2 and the hole transport material.65 The determination of the separation distance between electrodes is described in the ESI.† The J–V curves for the best cells of each configuration are presented in Fig. 2, while the influence of the separation between electrodes is summarized in Fig. 3 and Table 1.

From Fig. S4 in the ESI,† the redox potential of the copper-based redox couple was determined to be 0.928 V vs. NHE in acetonitrile, which is a very similar value to the one reported by Hattori et al. for a similar copper-complex based redox couple.22 The redox potential for the classical iodide/iodine redox couple is 0.290 V vs. NHE,84 hence, the Cu(dmp)2 redox couple allows for an increase in open circuit voltage of 0.638 V, however, only in the case that there is no shift of the band edges and electron transfer to the redox couple is very slow.

Fig. 2 and 3(a) show that, in particular for the Surlyn and epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 cells, open circuit voltage values larger than 1 V are obtained for the Cu(dmp)2 redox couple. However, the cells sealed with epoxy resin without the ZrO2 layer have a lower Voc. This may be attributed to direct contact between the mesoporous TiO2 layer and the PEDOT counter electrode, providing a recombination pathway. In the presence of the insulating ZrO2 interlayer, there is no loss in the open circuit photovoltage. In spite of losing almost 100 mV in the epoxy–TiO2 cells in comparison with the other two configurations, the current density attainable for this cell is the highest, as is also observed in Fig. 2 and 3(b).
The value of the diffusion coefficient for the [Cu(dmp)2]+ ion in the bulk of the electrolyte solution, obtained with the Levich relationship (Fig. S4 in the ESI†) is D0 = 1.1 × 10−5 cm2 s−1, and reported value for the [Cu(dmp)2]2+ ion is D0 = 1.4 × 10−5 cm2 s−1.85 This value is higher than the values usually reported for cobalt redox couples and comparable to those of iodine in acetonitrile,16,20,25,53,86 and similar to the value previously reported by Freitag et al.72 The results obtained for the diffusion coefficient of the reduced copper complex ion imply that diffusion in the bulk may not limit the DSC performance at sufficiently low light intensity, although the concentration of the reducing agent is relatively low at 0.2 M. The reduction of the separation of electrodes decreases the distance the redox couple has to diffuse to regenerate the dye and regenerate itself, and it also may increase the concentration gradient of electrons and redox couple inside the cell. Both differences may result in an increase in the current density attainable for this configuration.
When the two cell configurations sealed with epoxy resin are compared, it is observed that the cells with the additional ZrO2 layer present a lower photocurrent. Dye desorption measurements presented in the ESI† (Fig. S5 and Table S1) show that the cells with the ZrO2 layer adsorbed more dye than the bare TiO2 cells, suggesting that the ZrO2 layer may adsorb dye molecules. However, there is no additional photogeneration of electrons due to the high energy position of the conduction band of the insulating ZrO2 layer.43,44,65 One reason for the lower value of photocurrent could be the increase of total thickness of the mesoporous layer, which increases the redox couple diffusion distance. In order to determine the effect of mesoporous TiO2 film thickness on redox couple transport, cells with different film thickness were prepared and polarized in reverse bias to measure the oxidation current at the FTO surface of the working electrode: the current decreases with increasing film thickness illustrating transport limitation. On the other hand, similar reverse bias experiments on the three cell configurations with the same TiO2 films thickness also show that the current decreases with increasing separation between the two electrodes (see ESI,† Fig. S6). One of the most noticeable improvements when the distance between electrodes is reduced is in the fill factor values, which are displayed in Fig. 3(c) and in Table 1. Here, an increase of 0.10 (corresponding to 15%) in the fill factor occurs when changing the configuration of the cell from Surlyn polymer to epoxy resin; the average fill factor value obtained for the epoxy cells is just below 0.75. It should be emphasized that the cells were stored in the dark between the measurements shown in Fig. 3, hence, these results do not represent true performance stability.77–81 The increase in fill factor can be attributed to a decrease in series resistance associated to the electrolyte solution inside the cell. Finally, the average efficiency values are presented in Fig. 3(d). Both configurations of epoxy cells gave the same overall performance, reaching values as high as 8.2% (Fig. 2), even though they have different Voc and Jsc values. However, due to direct contact between the mesoporous TiO2 layer and the counter electrode some of the epoxy–TiO2 cells fail (approximately one out of five), as illustrated in Fig. S7 in the ESI,† making the epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 cells the more reliable option.
Time dependent solar cell characteristics
In order to study mass transport limitation in the different cell configurations, transient photocurrent measurements, conducted under short circuit conditions, were employed and are displayed in Fig. 4. When a DSC is under equilibrium conditions in the dark, the oxidized and reduced species in the electrolyte solution are equally distributed inside the cell. When the light is switched on, charge is generated from the dye and the regeneration process from the electrolyte solution takes place. As the illumination intensity increases, the concentration of oxidized dye also increases, requiring a sufficiently high reducing agent concentration at the interface. If the supply of reducing agent becomes mass transport limited, the regeneration efficiency and hence the photocurrent may decrease due to competing oxidized dye reduction by electrons from the TiO2, in particular at higher light intensity. In addition, there may also be a mass transport limitation of the oxidized redox mediator to the counter electrode. Hence, a difference between the peak current and the steady-state current or a deviation from linear behavior of steady-state current vs. light intensity, are both an indication of mass transport limitations within DSCs.25,53–55
 Fig. 4  (a) Transient photocurrent measurements. The values of current density were normalized to the same peak current value at different light intensities. (b) Representation of peak and steady-state currents against light intensity obtained from transient photocurrent measurements. The dashed lines represent the peak current density; the dots represent the steady-state current density. 
From Fig. 4(a) and (b) it is observed that at 0.5 Sun all transients overlay, and none of the cells present mass transport limitation. At 1 Sun, Surlyn and epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 cells start to display some mass transport limitation, while the epoxy–TiO2 cells maintain optimal performance. At 3 Suns, the peak current is still linear with light intensity for the Surlyn cells, but the decay is significant and the steady-state photocurrent is lower than for the epoxy-sealed cells: at short times, there is better supply of reducing agent because of the presence of bulk solution, however, at longer times, the larger distance to the counter electrode results in mass transport limitation, and increased recombination losses. The larger distance to the counter electrode can also limit the supply of [Cu(dmp)2]2+ at the counter electrode, which may also limit the steady-state photocurrent. For the epoxy-sealed cells, the peak current is somewhat smaller, however, the steady-state current is much larger: the current is largest for the epoxy–TiO2 cells related to the shortest distance to the counter electrode. These results show that the photocurrent under full sunlight illumination may be limited by the mass transport of copper-based cations in the bulk, which has also been reported by Bai et al.,19 and reducing distance between electrodes improves the attainable steady-state photocurrent.
In order to qualitatively assess the charge collection efficiency, we have performed charge extraction measurements (Fig. 5). Typically, in charge extraction measurements it is assumed that recombination under short circuit conditions is minimal and that all internal charge is collected.59 However, devices that use redox couples with one-electron transfer reactions, typically exhibit faster recombination kinetics. Under short-circuit conditions at 1 Sun, the quasi-Fermi level in the nanostructured, mesoporous TiO2 film of a classic TiO2/N-719/iodide DSC is about 0.5 eV higher than the Fermi level in the FTO contacts,87 which is essentially equal to the redox potential (except for a small overpotential at the CE to maintain the photocurrent density), and this ΔEQF increases with higher light intensity and is expected to be larger for the high voltage cells presented in this work. Hence, upon switching off the light, the system relaxes to the equilibrium situation in the dark and electrons can either flow towards the FTO contact or be transferred to either the oxidized dye or the acceptor species of the redox couple in the solution, leading to either a positive or negative current, respectively. The dominating process depends on the electron density in the film (i.e. light intensity and quasi-Fermi level) and the balance of electron transport and transfer rates, which may depend differently on electron density. At low light intensity, the regeneration efficiency is high, as there is no limitation in the supply of reducing agent to the sensitized TiO2 film. Hence, the charge extraction corresponds to extraction of trapped electrons from the TiO2 at the FTO contact, resulting in a positive current, and a total charge that saturates at longer times. At high light intensity, the electron density in the film is higher, but also the steady-state density of oxidized dye molecules and the concentration of oxidizing redox agent in the solution; the reducing agent concentration is expected to be lower, especially within the TiO2 film, as mass transport between the counter electrode and the working electrode is limiting the photocurrent (see Fig. 4). These effects influence the local redox potential, which is expected to be at more positive potential in the TiO2 film, thus accelerating the electron transfer kinetics to the solution. This can be observed in Fig. 5: at 3 Suns, initially, the trapped charge close to the FTO contact is extracted efficiently resulting in a positive charge, but at a certain time, electron transfer to the solution becomes important, leading to a maximum in the total positive charge, and may even lead to a negative current, as is the case for the Surlyn cell. For the epoxy-sealed cells this effect is less pronounced, especially for the epoxy–TiO2 cells: this is related to the observation from Fig. 4 that there is almost no mass transport limitation in this case, thus the results for high and low light intensity are qualitatively very similar.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was employed in all cell configurations in order to investigate the effect of electrode separation. Fig. 6(a) shows very different Nyquist plots for the three cell configurations. Often, a semicircle associated with charge transfer processes at the counter electrode appears at high frequencies. However, this semicircle does not appear for any of the samples, suggesting that charge transfer is very fast at the PEDOT-coated counter electrode, illustrating that PEDOT is an excellent alternative to Pt for the Cu(dmp)2 redox couple, in agreement with previous work from Tsao and co-workers75 and Yun and co-workers for a host of systems.74,76,78 In the plot for the Surlyn-sealed cell, two main semicircles can be observed. The first semicircle is associated with electron transport and recombination in the mesoporous layer and the second loop is usually related with diffusion of the redox couple.5,51,52,60,88–91 In this plot, it is clear that the impedance corresponding to diffusion of the redox couple is large. Analyzing the Nyquist plot for the epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 cell configuration it is clear that the behavior is different from that of the Surlyn cell. The Nyquist plot for this configuration seems to be composed of two merged semicircles, where the second loop, related to the diffusion of the redox couple, is much smaller than for the Surlyn cells. This may be related with the decrease of the distance between electrodes, which alters the mass transport limitation inside the cell and reduces the total impedance at low frequencies. However, the additional ZrO2 layer seems to contribute to mass transport limitation since the second semicircle still has an important contribution to the total impedance. In the plot for the epoxy–TiO2 cell the second semicircle does not appear but instead a negative capacitance is present at low frequencies. This type of negative capacitance has been reported previously for other types of solar cells,62–64 including solid-state DSCs,62,65,66 and has been associated with conductivity modulation due to injection of minority carriers,66,67 loss of interface charge at occupied states below the Fermi level,63 an additional recombination pathway at forward bias,62 and also to a charge transfer process between two electronic reservoirs governed by the occupation of an intermediate state, which becomes saturated and limits the kinetics of the process.62,65 Li et al.65 found experimental evidence that the spatial origin of the negative capacitance at low frequencies of nanostructured solar cells is at the metal oxide/hole conductor interface in solid-state DSCs. In our work, this inductive behavior only appears for the epoxy–TiO2 cells and disappears once a layer of ZrO2 is applied into the DSC, in a similar way as Li et al. reported for ssDSCs.65 This is a clear indication that this negative capacitance is due to the direct interaction between electrons in the TiO2 mesoporous layer and the PEDOT counter electrode. Separating the two electrodes with a ZrO2 insulating layer suppresses this negative capacitance behavior completely. We propose that due to contact between these two layers there is an additional recombination pathway that decreases the charge accumulation ability of the solar cell, implying a negative capacitance, as Mora-Seró et al. proposed for solid state solar devices.62
 Fig. 6  (a) Experimental Nyquist plots for the Surlyn, epoxy–TiO2 and epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 cells. The measurements were performed at open circuit; the light intensity was calibrated to match the open circuit potential of the solar cells obtained under 1 Sun illumination. The fit curves using the classical equivalent circuit for the Surlyn-sealed cells and the epoxy TiO2/ZrO2 cells (ESI,† Fig. S3a), and the new equivalent circuit proposed in this work for the epoxy TiO2 cell, are also displayed. (b) Equivalent circuit proposed to fit the data for the epoxy–TiO2 cells. 
This negative capacitance is simulated in the proposed equivalent circuit (Fig. 6(b)) using an inductive element and the fitting results are displayed in Fig. 6(a) where it can be observed that the fit of the equivalent circuit reproduces the experimental results very well. The results obtained from the impedance analysis are presented in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7(a) the chemical capacitance indicates that the three configurations accumulate very similar amount of charge at the same potential, indicating there is no shift in the position of the band edges. Fig. 7(b) shows the charge transfer resistance as a function of the applied potential. It can be observed that the epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 cells present the highest resistance to recombination at the same potential, which agrees with the overall performance and high open circuit potential of the cells. Although the Surlyn cells also present high open circuit potential values, the charge transfer resistance for these cells is smaller at the same potential than for the epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 cells. This suggests increased recombination in this configuration, related to electron transfer to oxidized dye molecules and the oxidized redox species.
 Fig. 7  (a) Chemical capacitance and (b) charge transfer resistance and (c) electronic lifetime as a function of potential for the three different configurations. 
For the epoxy–TiO2 DSCs, the charge transfer resistance at low light intensity is similar as for the epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 cells, however, at higher light intensity, recombination becomes faster due to the direct interaction between the counter electrode and the mesoporous TiO2 layer. The same reasoning explains the results of the electron lifetime shown in Fig. 7(c). It can be concluded that the differences in regeneration efficiency and recombination pathways as a result of mass transport effects are directly reflected in the charge transfer resistance and the electron lifetime, and the interpretation is in accordance with the results from steady-state and transient measurements. These results suggest that the epoxy–TiO2/ZrO2 is an interesting configuration to optimize cell performance and reproducibility.
Conclusions
Dye-sensitized solar cells with a copper-complex redox couple present a high open circuit potential of 1.034 V, which can be ascribed to the more positive Nernst potential of the redox couple compared to that of the traditional iodide/tri-iodide couple. The fill factor and power conversion efficiency of the DSCs are improved by reducing the electrode separation distance using an epoxy resin sealing method. The reduced distance between working and counter electrodes greatly improves the diffusion of the copper-based redox couple, which can become a limiting factor at larger electrode separation and higher light intensities and result in increased recombination losses. Impedance analysis shows an inductive behavior at low frequencies for epoxy–TiO2 cells, which is associated with direct interaction between electrons in the TiO2 mesoporous layer and the PEDOT counter electrode. This inductive behavior disappears when an insulating ZrO2 interlayer is applied on the mesoporous TiO2 layer. The cell configuration using the TiO2/ZrO2 films and the epoxy sealing method to minimize the distance between electrodes result in reproducible solar cells with an efficiency of close to 8%. Improvements in the performance of this configuration may be achieved by reducing the thickness of the porous ZrO2 insulating layer.
