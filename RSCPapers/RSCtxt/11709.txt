These polymers show ambipolar or unipolar n-channel charge-transporting characteristics with electron mobilities in the range of 0.02–0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1 in organic thin film transistors.
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) have received great attention due to their potential applications in low-cost, solution-processed and flexible organic electronics.1–3 Moreover, OTFTs are efficient devices to study the charge-transporting properties of organic molecules and polymers.4–6 The improvement in OTFT device performance is strongly dependent on the design and synthesis of organic/polymer semiconductors. Most of the reported high-mobility polymer semiconductors are donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymers,7–11 in which electron-rich building blocks (D) and electron-deficient building blocks (A) are alternatively linked by covalent bonds. In comparison with the large variety of electron-rich building blocks, electron-deficient building blocks applicable for D–A type polymer semiconductors are relatively limited.12–19Scheme 1 shows several typical electron-deficient building blocks, such as naphthalene diimide (NDI),12 isoindigo (IID),13 perylene diimide (PDI),14 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),15 bithiophene-imide (BTI)16 and benzodifurandione-based oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (BDOPV).17 It is noteworthy that these electron-deficient building blocks are based on an amide unit. Thus, the development of novel electron-deficient building blocks besides using the amide unit will greatly expand the scope of D–A type polymer semiconductors and will pave the way for the progress of OTFTs.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of (a) several widely used electron-deficient building blocks and (b) our reported BNBP building block. 
We recently reported a new kind of electron-deficient building block based on a boron–nitrogen coordination bond (B←N), double B←N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) (Scheme 1), which can be used to develop polymer electron acceptors for all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs).20–22 The resulting all-PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 6.3% with extremely small photo energy loss. As shown in Scheme 1, BNBP represents a new kind of electron-deficient building block based on a B←N unit.23,24 Moreover, BNBP-based conjugated polymers always exhibit delocalized lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) and low-lying LUMO energy levels, which would facilitate facile electron injection and efficient intrachain electron transport. These properties stimulated us to develop BNBP-based polymer semiconductors for OTFTs.
Herein, we report a series of BNBP-based electron-transporting polymer semiconductors. These polymers show delocalized LUMOs and highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) over conjugated backbones and their LUMO/HOMO energy levels (ELUMO/HOMO) can be effectively tuned by the comonomer units. In OTFTs, they exhibit electron-dominated ambipolar or unipolar n-channel charge-transporting characteristics with electron mobilities (μe) in the range of 0.02–0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Scheme 2 shows the synthetic route to three BNBP-based polymers. P-BNBP-TVT, P-BNBP-BT and P-BNBP-fBT containing (E)-2-(2-(thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)thiophene (TVT),25–27 2,2′-bithiophene (BT) and 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene (fBT) units, respectively, were synthesized under Stille-polymerization conditions with Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3/P(o-tolyl)3 as the catalyst/ligand. Their chemical structures were confirmed using high-temperature 1H NMR and elemental analysis (ESI†). According to gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C, the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity (PDI) are 41.6 kDa and 4.35 for P-BNBP-TVT, 42.0 kDa and 1.66 for P-BNBP-BT and 116.0 kDa and 2.60 for P-BNBP-fBT, respectively (Table 1). In thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements, all the polymers display good thermal stability with thermal decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 412 °C for P-BNBP-TVT, 363 °C for P-BNBP-BT and 370 °C for P-BNBP-fBT, respectively. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans show no melting or glass transitions in the 25–320 °C range.

To elucidate their polymer backbone configurations and electronic structures, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the model compounds at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory (ESI†). In the calculations, the model compounds containing four repeating units were used with the long alkyl chains replaced by methyl groups. Different from the TVT and BT units, the fBT unit exhibits an intramolecular locked planar structure due to the F⋯S interactions (ESI†).28,29 Thus, P-BNBP-fBT shows a more rigid polymer backbone compared with P-BNBP-TVT and P-BNBP-BT, which will have an impact on their molecular packing structures in thin films. As shown in Fig. 1, their LUMOs and HOMOs are all extensively delocalized over the conjugated backbones, suggesting that the ELUMO/HOMO of the polymers can be effectively tuned by the comonomer units.30–32 The calculated ELUMO/HOMO are −3.00 eV/−5.28 eV for P-BNBP-TVT, −3.01 eV/−5.41 eV for P-BNBP-BT and −3.14 eV/−5.50 eV for P-BNBP-fBT, respectively (ESI†). The gradually decreasing trends of the ELUMO/HOMO of P-BNBP-TVT, P-BNBP-BT and P-BNBP-fBT are due to the decreasing electron-donating abilities of the TVT, BT and fBT units. Their delocalized LUMOs/HOMOs and various ELUMO/HOMO would interfere with the charge injection and transport in OTFTs.

In UV/Vis absorption spectra (ESI†), while P-BNBP-BT in hot o-DCB solution shows one main absorption peak at 589 nm, P-BNBP-TVT and P-BNBP-fBT both exhibit one main absorption peak and a red-shifted shoulder peak at 599/650 nm and 594/620 nm, respectively (Table 1). Accordingly, the main absorption peaks are attributed to the absorbance by the isolated polymer chains and the red-shifted shoulder absorption peaks are assigned to the absorbance by the formed aggregated polymer chains in the solutions. In spin-cast thin films, the maximum absorption peak is at 651 nm for P-BNBP-TVT, 638 nm for P-BNBP-BT and 624 nm for P-BNBP-fBT, which is red-shifted by 52 nm, 49 nm and 30 nm compared with those in hot solution, respectively. These spectral changes should be due to their various molecular stacking modes in thin films.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties and estimate the ELUMO/HOMO of the three polymers. As shown in Fig. 2a, the three polymers produce reversible reduction processes and irreversible oxidation processes with the onset potentials (Eredonset/Eoxonset) versus Fc/Fc+ being −1.33 V/+0.89 V for P-BNBP-TVT, −1.28 V/+0.96 V for P-BNBP-BT and −1.18 V/+1.07 V for P-BNBP-fBT, respectively (Table 1). Accordingly, their ELUMO/HOMO are estimated to be −3.47 eV/−5.69 eV for P-BNBP-TVT, −3.52 eV/−5.76 eV for P-BNBP-BT and −3.62 eV/−5.87 eV for P-BNBP-fBT, respectively (Fig. 2b). The ELUMO/HOMO are decreased from P-BNBP-TVT and P-BNBP-BT to P-BNBP-fBT by 0.15 eV/0.18 eV and by 0.10 eV/0.11 eV, respectively, which are fully consistent with the decreasing tendency in the theoretical calculation results. These results confirm that the ELUMO/HOMO of the BNBP-based polymers can be both tuned by the comonomer units due to their delocalized LUMOs/HOMOs. The relatively low-lying ELUMO/HOMO of P-BNBP-fBT will facilitate facile electron injection and electron transport while suppressing hole injection in the OTFT devices.

To investigate the charge-transporting properties of the BNBP-based polymer semiconductors, OTFTs with a top-gate/bottom-contact (TGBC) geometry were fabricated (ESI†). The OTFT devices with the three polymers annealed at 250 °C exhibit a better performance. Typical transfer and output curves of the OTFT devices are shown in Fig. 3, in which the p-channel output curves of P-BNBP-BT were not obtained probably due to its low hole mobility (μh). P-BNBP-TVT and P-BNBP-BT exhibit electron-dominated ambipolar charge-transporting characteristics with a μmaxe/μmaxh of 0.32/0.015 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the P-BNBP-TVT device and 0.05/0.0014 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the P-BNBP-BT device, respectively. In comparison, P-BNBP-fBT displays unipolar n-channel transporting characteristics with a μmaxe of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1. A slow increase and then saturation of current in the range of gate voltage (VG) from −10 to −50 V was found in Fig. 3b. This behaviour may have originated from holes trapped at the P-BNBP-TVT/dielectric interface. In these devices, the transitions from ambipolar to unipolar n-channel characteristics of the BNBP-based polymer semiconductors can be ascribed to their variable energy levels. P-BNBP-fBT with the lowest ELUMO/HOMO exhibits facile electron injection and transport while blocking hole injection from an Au electrode, producing its unipolar n-channel characteristics. These OTFT devices show poor stability for n-channel transport in air. Using P-BNBP-TVT as an example (ESI†), μmaxe decreases from 0.32 to 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1 in 1 day, probably due to its relatively high-lying ELUMO. It is notable that all three polymers show higher electron mobilities than their respective hole mobilities. Moreover, they also exhibit on/off current ratio (Ion/Ioff) values of 105–107 in their n-channel characteristics. In previous reports, boron-containing conjugated polymers have been applied as charge-transporting semiconductors in OTFTs.33–35 To the best of our knowledge, these BNBP-based polymer semiconductors show the best electron-transporting performance among the reported boron-containing polymers. These results strongly suggest that BNBP is a promising electron-deficient building block for polymer semiconductors.

In the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (ESI†), all the three films annealed at 250 °C show continuous and smooth morphologies with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 0.5–1.0 nm (0.77 nm for P-BNBP-TVT, 0.96 nm for P-BNBP-BT and 0.53 nm for P-BNBP-fBT). Ordered and fiber-like microstructures without large domains are observed. These intertwined fibers can form interconnected domain networks, which have minimized grain boundary, and provide an efficient path for charge transport.
The molecular packings in the polymer films were studied by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and in-plane X-ray diffraction (IP-XRD) (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4, the GI-XRD pattern of the P-BNBP-TVT film gives a strong (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.14° along with the (200) and (300) diffraction peaks, and the IP-XRD pattern exhibits a weak (010) diffraction at 2θ = 24.6°. The (100) diffraction indicates a lamellar packing distance of 2.13 nm along the out-of-plane direction and the (010) diffraction corresponds to a π–π stacking distance of 0.36 nm along the in-plane direction. In contrast, the P-BNBP-BT film shows one (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 3.93° along with a weak (200) peak and the P-BNBP-fBT film exhibits only a weak (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.40° in the GI-XRD patterns, which correspond to the lamellar packing distances of 2.25 nm for P-BNBP-BT and 2.01 nm for P-BNBP-fBT along the out-of-plane direction, respectively. No (010) peaks are observed in both P-BNBP-BT and P-BNBP-fBT films along the in-plane direction. These signals suggest that all the three polymers adopt edge-on packing modes in thin films with the packing order in the sequence P-BNBP-TVT > P-BNBP-BT > P-BNBP-fBT. This is probably due to the fact that the planar but flexible backbone of P-BNBP-TVT is beneficial for polymer stacking while the rigid conjugated backbone of P-BNBP-fBT is undesirable for molecular packing. Their molecular packing order is fully consistent with their charge-transporting abilities that P-BNBP-TVT with ordered stacking in the thin film shows better charge mobility.

To understand the potential of BNBP as an electron-deficient building block for polymer semiconductors, we synthesized a series of BNBP-based conjugated polymers with TVT, BT and fBT units. Due to their delocalized LUMOs/HOMOs over the polymer backbones, their LUMO/HOMO energy levels can be both effectively tuned by the comonomer units. In OTFTs, these polymer semiconductors show electron-dominated ambipolar or unipolar n-channel charge-transporting characteristics with electron mobilities in the range of 0.02–0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1. Their charge-transporting properties are correlated with their edge-on packing structures in the thin films. Our results indicate that BNBP is a new promising electron-deficient building block to develop polymer semiconductors for OTFTs and other applications.
