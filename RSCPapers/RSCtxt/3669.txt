    , Accepted 26th May 2020First published on 27th May 2020AbstractThe Zn(O,S) layer which is alternative to the conventional CdS buffer layer is an ideal candidate due to its eco-friendly compositions and tunable bandgap. One of the approaches to further optimize the device performance is to investigate the relationship between the impurities and the conduction band offset (CBO) at the heterojunction. The impurity phases in Zn(O,S) with different oxygen fluxes are therefore analyzed and the corresponding Cd-free CIGS solar cells are investigated. We demonstrate that the value of CBO at the interface dominates the device performance in the case of low oxygen fluxes with a few impurities in the buffer layer. On the contrary, the formation of excessive impurities in the Zn(O,S) thin films prepared with high oxygen fluxes leads to the decline of the conversion efficiency of solar cells, even if the current CBO value is appropriate. Consequently, the optimized Cd-free solar cells show a similar photovoltaic performance to traditional CdS/CIGS solar cells. This result may be beneficial for preparation of high quality buffer layers and deeper understanding of the deposition of high efficiency Cd-free chalcopyrite solar cells.
1. Introduction
The quaternary chalcopyrite compound semiconductor Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) is a promising material for thin-film solar cells due to its high conversion efficiency of 23.35%.1 CdS thin films synthesized by chemical bath deposition (CBD) have been normally employed as the buffer layer of quaternary compound thin film solar cells.2–4 However, the application of CdS can be a critical flaw in the environment considering the mass yields of CIGS solar cells. Furthermore, the low bandgap of CdS thin films (2.4 eV) represents the optical loss on shortwave response.3 Recently, Zn(O,S) thin films have been proposed as an ideal alternative buffer layer with several advantages, such as non-toxic components and excellent transparency with a tunable bandgap in the range of 2.8–3.6 eV.5 The reported highest conversion efficiency of Cd-free CIGS solar cells with double buffer layers Zn(O,S)-CBD and ZnMgO-ALD was 22.3% (ref. 3) and reached 18.3% by sputtering the Zn(O,S) buffer layer.6 When Zn(O,S) thin films are fabricated by CBD, however, mixed impurity phases (Zn(OH)2 and ZnO) are present,7 which lead to unstable device performance. Also, the CBD method is not compatible with the continuous vacuum production process. Zn(O,S) films are fabricated in the vacuum chamber through radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, which is more appropriate for industrial dry in-line preparation processes and has become a reassuring approach to fabricate Zn(O,S)/CIGS solar cells.
The value of CBO at the Zn(O,S)/CIGS interface can be adjusted by controlling the ratio of S/(S + O) in Zn(O,S) films, because both the conduction band energy and the valence band energy of the thin films are affected by S content. Many research institutes have studied the material properties of Zn(O,S) films and the energy band alignment of Zn(O,S)/CIGS,5,8,9 as well as the device performances based on Zn(O,S) films with different S contents.10–12 It is reported that the valence-band (VB) offset increases significantly for low S content, while the conduction-band edge increases gradually.8 However, the issue of micro structures at intermediate compositions with various oxygen fluxes still needs to be further investigated for better understanding and optimizing Zn(O,S)/CIGS devices. And the relationship between the impurity phases of Zn(O,S) and the CBO value is still not clarified.
Therefore, this contribution is divided into three parts. First, the oxygen flux during the fabrication process of the Zn(O,S) buffer layer is investigated to find the relationship between the impurity phases and the band alignment at various S ratios. Second, the effects of impurity phases on Zn(O,S)/CIGS solar cells are simulated and discussed. Finally, the photovoltaic performances of Cd-free CIGS solar cells integrating the Zn(O,S) buffer layer with different oxygen fluxes are exhibited compared to those of traditional devices with the CdS buffer layer.
2. Experimental details
In this work, the industrial sputtering method is carried out to fabricate Zn(O,S) thin films. The Zn(O,S) target is a combination of 40% ZnO and 60% ZnS, and the Ar pressure during the sputtering process is kept at 0.8 Pa. The substrate temperature is maintained at 150 °C and the sputtering power is controlled at 100 W. Various oxygen fluxes are adopted to adjust the S content in the Zn(O,S) layer. In addition, the CIGS solar cell devices are fabricated with the structure of soda-lime glass (SLG)/Mo/Cu(In,Ga)Se2/RF-Zn(O,S)/Al-doped Zn(ZnO:Al)/Ni–Al. The conventional structure of CIGS solar cells is SLG/Mo/CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/ZnO:Al/Ni–Al. It should be noticed that the CdS and i-ZnO layers are both replaced by Zn(O,S) thin films in the present devices, which can simplify the processing. In the present work, Zn(O,S)/CIGS devices with a total area of approximately 0.50 cm2 were deposited via an all-dry process, as shown in Fig. S1a and b.† Fig. S2† shows the cross-sectional SEM image of Zn(O,S)/CIGS heterojunction solar cells showing their configuration. The different layers in the solar cells are shown and different thicknesses are noted. The amplified part in the white circle is the Zn(O,S) buffer layer of approximately 50 nm. A Mo back contact of 1 μm thick is prepared onto an SLG substrate by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering. A CIGS absorber layer of 2 μm thickness is fabricated on the Mo back contact layer via a three-stage co-evaporation process. According to our previous results, a 50 nm thick Zn(O,S) buffer layer and a 500 nm thick ZnO:Al window layer are deposited by the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering process.2 Cells are tested under simulated AM 1.5 illumination without the effect of light soaking. The data presented here have been corrected partially for the spectral mismatch utilizing spectral response measurements. The completed Zn(O,S) buffer layers are deposited in various Ar/O2 atmospheres so as to investigate the effect of oxygen fluxes on the performance of Cd-free CIGS solar cells. Anti-reflective layers are not employed during the fabrication process. For comparison, the devices with the CdS buffer layer are fabricated by the CBD method in the same batch.
To investigate the ratio of S/(S + O), the composition of Zn(O,S) thin films is analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurement. The element distribution of Zn(O,S) thin films and cross-sectional morphology of CIGS solar cells were obtained by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The transmittance/reflectivity spectra are evaluated at room temperature via a UV-vis-NIR Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied on the samples to evaluate the topography with a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 scanning probe microscope. Surface compositions and element valence states were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) utilizing VG 220i XL equipment. In order to investigate the micro structural phases of Zn(O,S) thin films under the conditions of distinct oxygen fluxes, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) is applied to evaluate the crystalline characteristic and the preferred orientation of Zn(O,S) thin films. Raman spectra were measured using a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw InVia+MV4000). TRPL imaging was conducted at room temperature with a Hamamatsu Near Infrared compact fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Hamamatsu C12132), using a Nd:YAG (532 nm) laser with a pulse width of less than 1.3 ns and a repetition rate of 15 kHz. A SAN-EI XES-500 T1 solar simulator was applied to measure the performances of CIGS solar cells under AM 1.5 G illumination utilizing a Keithley 2420 source.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optical and micro structural properties of the sputtered Zn(O,S) thin films
The Zn(O,S) films are prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering from a ceramic single Zn(O,S) target in a mixed Ar and O2 atmosphere, with a stable Ar flux (40.0 sccm) and different O2 fluxes. The ratio of S/(S + O) is calibrated by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) measurement. The content of O is influenced by the glass substrate. Therefore, we use the detected value of S/Zn to react with that of S/(S + O). As shown in Table S1,† when the oxygen flux increases from 0.1 sccm to 0.6 sccm, the S concentration in the Zn(O,S) thin films is 0.58, 0.54, 0.28, 0.27, 0.27, and 0.26, respectively. It indicates that a drop in S concentration is observed with the increase in oxygen flux (the ratio of S/(S + O) changes from 0.58 to 0.26). However, the composition of the films remains nearly stable when the oxygen flux is over 0.3 sccm. Due to the stable S concentration of the films when the oxygen flux is over 0.3 sccm, we chose 0.1–0.4 sccm (as shown in Table 1) to explore the optical properties and micro structural properties of the Zn(O,S) thin films. The S and Zn element distribution information of these four samples is characterized by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in Fig. S3.† It shows the non-uniform distribution of these S and Zn elements in the Zn(O,S) thin films.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to measure the surface morphology of Zn(O,S) thin films fabricated on soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates in detail. Fig. 1a–d show the 2D and 3D AFM morphologies of the Zn(O,S) thin films with a thickness of approximately 50 nm under various oxygen fluxes. A pinhole-free surface morphology is seen in Fig. 1a and b, demonstrating that the Zn(O,S) thin films fabricated under low oxygen fluxes exhibit a better surface morphology. However, as the oxygen flux increases, the surface particles condensed into clusters or slices as observed in Fig. 1c and d. The specific values of average roughness (denoted here as Ra) are listed in Table 1. A slight enhancement (from 1.01 nm to 2.05 nm) in the surface average roughness is observed as the oxygen flux increases, which indicates that the increased roughness of the buffer layer might affect the front contact at the Zn(O,S)/CIGS interface. Therefore, the average roughness of Zn(O,S) should be considered as an important factor that affects the device performance.

(e) Transmittance/reflectivity spectra of the Zn(O,S) thin films with the increase of oxygen flux; (f) fitted optical bandgap of the Zn(O,S) thin films with different oxygen fluxes. The S/(S + O) ratio of Zn(O,S) thin films prepared with 0.1–0.4 sccm oxygen flux is 0.58, 0.54, 0.28, and 0.27, respectively, based on XRF results. 
The transmittance/reflectivity spectra are evaluated at room temperature via an ultraviolet–visible spectrometer with the increase of oxygen flux (as shown in Fig. 1e). The transmittance rate is decreased with the increase of oxygen flux, which might be attributed to the various optical bandgaps related to the changeable S concentration (as shown in Table 1 due to the XRF results). At the same time, the reflective rate is also decreased, indicating that the roughness of Zn(O,S) thin films is increased with the increase in oxygen flux. This phenomenon is consistent with the analyzed AFM results. In order to evaluate the optical bandgap, we fit the data according to an α2 ∝ (hν–Eg) relationship, where α is noted as the absorption coefficient and therefore hν is noted as the photon energy.13,14 The fitted bandgap is the intersection point with the horizontal axis presented in Fig. 1f. The Eg decreases from 3.58 eV to 2.85 eV while the oxygen flux increases from 0.1 sccm to 0.4 sccm, respectively. The large band gap of the Zn(O,S) thin films (S/(S + O) = 0.58) should be attributed to the quantum confinement effects of thinner thin films.13,14 In addition, it reveals that the element compositions are changed and the optical bandgap of the Zn(O,S) thin films can be gradually regulated with the oxygen flux, which might affect the optical absorption loss in the shortwave region and further influence the device efficiency of CIGS solar cells.
In order to explore the micro structural properties of the thin films, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) is applied to evaluate the crystalline characteristic and the preferred orientation of the Zn(O,S) thin films. Diffractograms measured by GIXRD for different oxygen fluxes are shown in Fig. 2a. The phases of the Zn(O,S) thin films vary from ZnS (Eg = 3.68 eV) (cubic or hexagonal) to ZnO (Eg = 3.3 eV) (hexagonal) with a nanocrystalline or amorphous structure for intermediate composition with the increase in oxygen flux. This is consistent with previous reports10,12,15 and can be explained by the lattice mismatch of approximately 20%.9 For the 0.1 sccm oxygen flux, with a S/(S + O) ratio of 0.58, a signal from the ZnS (Eg = 3.68 eV) impurity phase with an angle of 28.68° is detected, resulting in the larger value of CBO at the interface of the buffer/absorber, thus leading to higher interface recombination.16 It also indicates that the larger CBO value is a barrier for the photogenerated electrons in the case of the presented ZnS. Therefore, this fact leads to the lower Jsc and FF in the corresponding solar cell performance.17 At the same time, the quality of the Zn(O,S) thin films is also deteriorated with the oxygen flux of 0.1 sccm due to the presence of ZnS impurity phases. When the oxygen flux is increased to 0.2 sccm, the fabricated Zn(O,S) thin films exhibit the single Zn(O,S) phase. This result will make a great contribution to the mitigation of the internal defects, thereby improving the electrical performance. However, according to our XRF results, the ratio of S/(S + O) in Zn(O,S) thin films with the oxygen flux of 0.2 sccm is 0.54. It has been reported that the CBO value at the Zn(O,S)/CIGS interface with a S concentration of 0.6 is +0.5 eV.18 It indicates that the excessive CBO of 0.5 eV will be a large barrier for carrier transport. Furthermore, as the oxygen flux increases gradually to 0.3 sccm and 0.4 sccm, three diffraction peaks can be observed obviously, namely (100), (002), and (101), respectively.19,20 These peaks of Zn(O,S) thin films shift to larger angles as the oxygen flux increases, which indicates the decrease of the c-axis lattice constant. This is due to the Bragg rule which states that as the radius of the O2− ion is smaller than that of the S2− ion, the substituted S2− ions in the O2− lattice sites could decrease the lattice parameter. Therefore, the Bragg rule is consistent with the XRD results showing that the decrease of the c-axis lattice constant should be attributed to the increase of the amount of substitutional O2− ions in S2− sites as the oxygen flux increases. All the details about peak positions and diffraction angles are shown in Table S2.†

The S/(S + O) ratio of Zn(O,S) thin films prepared with 0.1–0.4 sccm oxygen flux is 0.58, 0.54, 0.28, and 0.27, respectively, based on XRF results. 
For further characterizing the micro structural changes of the Zn(O,S) thin films at intermediate compositions with different oxygen fluxes, a Raman spectrometer is adopted with oxygen fluxes of 0.1 sccm, 0.2 sccm, 0.3 sccm, and 0.4 sccm, respectively. All the films retain the thickness of 50 nm and the activation wavelength of 514 nm as shown in Fig. 2b. In general, the structure of ZnO thin films is wurtzite (WZ) and the structure of ZnS thin films is zinc blende (ZB).9 Meanwhile, as the chemical environment changes, the ZnO and ZnS thin films may become cross-type compounds, namely, the structure of wurtzite can be observed in ZnS films, and the structure of zinc blende can also be observed in ZnO films.21 The structure of Zn(O,S) thin films changes with the composition, so the ZB structure, WZ structure or the mixture of these two structures may appear in the films with different compositions.8 It is noted that the molecular vibration mode in the WZ structure is the A1⊕E1⊕E2 mode, while only the T2 mode is observed during the molecular vibration in the ZB structure. In these vibration modes, only E2 is nonpolar, which means that A1, E1 and E2 all exhibit TO/LO splits.21 For the ZnO thin films with the WZ structure, the main Raman peak position is at 574 cm−1 noted as LOZnO with the black dotted line, which is the frequency shift caused by the A1 (LO) mode. In addition, for the ZnS thin films, the main Raman peaks are not changed with the lattice structure, but they are mainly located at 351 cm−1. Besides, for the ZnS films with the WZ structure, the main peaks are considered to be a combination of the A1 (LO) mode and E1 (LO) mode. In contrast, it is considered to be the frequency shift caused by the T2 (LO) mode vibration for the main peaks with the ZB structure.22 Therefore, the peak position at 351 cm−1 is identified as LOZnS (as shown in Fig. 2b), suggesting the elimination of the ZnS impurity phase. This result is in agreement with the previous XRD analysis. Furthermore, it is interesting to show that all the Raman spectra show a clear peak position on the left side of 574 cm−1 (LOZnO) in the range of 0.1–0.4 sccm oxygen fluxes. The Zn(O,S) thin films are solid solutions composed of ZnS and ZnO, so the Zn(O,S) thin films will appear in the peak position between these two compositions. In addition, the common Raman peak position of these four films is recorded at 1097 cm−1, which is the secondary peak of the Zn(O,S) thin films. The second-order Raman peak of the ZnS thin films is recorded as SOZnS (surface optical mode) related to the LO mode, mainly at 677 cm−1, and the second-order Raman peak of the ZnO films is denoted as SOZnO, mainly at 1158 cm−1.21,23 Therefore, the secondary peak will also appear between these two compositions. But when the oxygen flux increases to 0.3 sccm and 0.4 sccm, a new sharp peak is observed at 1116 cm−1. It is reported that this sharp peak in the Raman spectrum at 1116 cm−1 is the Raman peak position representing SO32−,24 indicating that the ZnSO3 impurity phase exists in the Zn(O,S) thin films with oxygen fluxes of 0.3 sccm and 0.4 sccm. Moreover, it is observed that the intensity of the SO32− peak with the oxygen flux of 0.4 sccm is significantly stronger than that of the SO32− Raman peak with the oxygen flux of 0.3 sccm. Those sulfates will deteriorate the semiconductor properties, leading to poor characteristics of the heterojunction at the Zn(O,S)/CIGS interface. Furthermore, besides the excessive sulfates, the highest average roughness (2.05 nm based on the AFM results shown in Table 1) of Zn(O,S) also makes a contribution to the poor quality of the buffer layer when the oxygen flux is up to 0.4 sccm.
From the analysis above, we discussed how the phases of the Zn(O,S) layer change with the increase of oxygen flux. As shown in Fig. 3, the specific intermediate compositions and element valence states of the Zn(O,S) layers in the CIGS devices are measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to clarify the intermediate altered valence states after the increase in oxygen flux. All the samples were “pre-cleaned” with Ar ions before XPS measurements to eliminate the effect of oxides and organic impurities on the surface of the Zn(O,S) thin films. And all the spectral lines have been calibrated according to the standard C 1s peak (284.68 eV) of C to eliminate the charge effect caused by X-ray excitation of electrons. To measure the element compositions of the deposited Zn(O,S) thin films, the Zn 2p, O 1s and S 2p peaks are fitted by Voigt functions.18 The following relative sensitivity factors (RSFs) have been utilized to qualify the compositions of Zn, O, and S: RSF(Zn 2p) = 5.589, RSF(O 1s) = 0.780, and RSF(S 2p) = 0.668.18 The XPS results of Zn 2p are shown in Fig. S4† and the spectra of O 1s and S 2p are shown in Fig. 3. Table S3† shows the different oxygen fluxes as well as the corresponding S contents determined by the XRF results and XPS spectra to compare the composition results from these two techniques and analyze the element distribution in the Zn(O,S) thin films with the increase of oxygen flux. XRF measurement can test the element ratios in the whole film (micron scale), while the XPS method is applicable to evaluating the element information on the surface (within 10 nm). According to the thicknesses of these deposited Zn(O,S) films (50 nm), XRF should be more adaptable than XPS to reveal the composition in the whole film. Through the comparative analysis of XRF and XPS data in Table S3,† it reveals that the presence of O element has a tendency to enrich on the surface of thin films as the oxygen flux increases. Besides the evaluation of element composition, the most important application of XPS measurement is to investigate the impurity phases due to the binding energies. Therefore, the samples with 0.1–0.4 sccm oxygen fluxes were applied to study the internal impurities by XPS analysis of the peak positions of S 2p and O 1s spectra. As shown in Fig. 3a, the main peaks of the S 2p spectra (located at 160–163 eV) were fitted through two near-Gaussian peaks, S 2P3/2 and S 2P1/2, centered at 161.2 eV and 162.5 eV, respectively. Therefore, the valence state of the current S is −2,25,26 indicating that this S element comes from the Zn(O,S) phase. However, the peaks located at 166–171 eV are composed of S4+ and S6+,27 suggesting that the S of these two valence states corresponds to SO32− and SO42−, respectively. Fig. 3a shows that the peaks of SO32− and SO42− increase gradually in the Zn(O,S) thin films as the oxygen flux increases. The S atoms were oxidized by the excess oxygen into S4+ and S6+, which become defects trapping carriers in the Zn(O,S) thin films and deteriorating the quality of the thin films. Furthermore, an increase in intensity for oxidized ZnSO4 and ZnSO3 is observed when the oxygen flux exceeds 0.4 sccm, which is consistent with our Raman results. In addition, the peak positions of the O 1s spectra were fitted by three parts (as shown in Fig. 3b), O-A, O-B, and O-C, centered at 529.5 eV, 531.0 eV, and 531.8 eV respectively. The peak of O-A is considered to exist in the ZnOX lattice and the O-B peak is O2− mainly adsorbed at the O defect in the thin films,28–31 which is related to the vacancy defect (Vo), interstitial defect (Oi), or antisite defect (OZn). The peak of O-C is ascribed to the existence of SO32− or SO42−. It is notable that the formation of Zn(O,S) can be considered as oxygen doping into the lattice of ZnS.29,32 Table S4† shows the variation of the O 1s peak area with different oxygen fluxes. It shows that the area of the O-B peak becomes larger (increases from 14094.9 to 19820.6) as the oxygen flux increases from 0.1 sccm to 0.4 sccm, indicating the higher O concentration. Moreover, the area of the O-C peak has the same increasing trend (enhanced from 7866.0 to 10789.9), suggesting that the generated SO32− or SO42− increases gradually. This is in agreement with the analysis results of S 2p spectra (as shown in Fig. 3a). Therefore, we can conclude that the quality of the Zn(O,S) thin films deteriorates as the oxygen flux increases in the range of 0.1–0.4 sccm. Besides, the proportion of SO32− or SO42− in the films is extremely enhanced when the oxygen flux is over 0.4 sccm, leading to the increase in impurity defects in the thin films and the decrease of properties of the films. This is consistent with our AFM results and Raman analysis. In addition, these XPS results provide further evidence that the fewer sulfates exist in the Zn(O,S) films with the oxygen flux of 0.3 sccm, while the concentration of SO32− or SO42− is higher with the oxygen flux of 0.4 sccm. It further demonstrates that excessive sulfates are present in the Zn(O,S) thin films with the 0.4 sccm oxygen flux, which deteriorate the properties of the semiconductor and do not contribute to the optimization of the PN junction.

The S/(S + O) ratio of Zn(O,S) thin films prepared with 0.1–0.4 sccm oxygen fluxes is 0.58, 0.54, 0.28, and 0.27, respectively, based on XRF results. The S/(S + O) ratio with the increase of oxygen flux is 0.63, 0.57, 0.28, and 0.23, respectively, based on XPS results. 
To further characterize the carrier lifetime in Zn(O,S) thin films under different oxygen conditions, four samples were tested by time resolution photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL). All the Zn(O,S) thin films were prepared on a glass substrate under oxygen fluxes of 0.1 sccm, 0.2 sccm, 0.3 sccm, and 0.4 sccm, and TRPL was measured at 300 K. The wavelength of the excitation light was 340 nm. The resulting transient spectral lines are shown in Fig. 4. The carrier lifetime is obtained by exponential fitting the spectral line. The fitting formula is as follows: I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(1)A1 and A2 are constant coefficients. τ1 and τ2 represent the carrier lifetimes, which can characterize the concentration of surface defects and bulk defects,33 respectively.
 Fig. 4  The results of TRPL spectroscopy under different oxygen fluxes with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. The S/(S + O) ratio of Zn(O,S) thin films prepared with 0.1–0.4 sccm oxygen flux is 0.58, 0.54, 0.28, and 0.27, respectively, based on XRF results. 
As can be seen in Fig. 4, when the oxygen flux is 0.1 sccm and 0.2 sccm, τ1 is 0.52 ns and 0.53 ns, respectively; the difference is not obvious. However, τ2 decreases from 21 ns to 19.71 ns and 18.41 ns when the oxygen flux rises to 0.3 sccm and 0.4 sccm, respectively, indicating the increase in defects of Zn(O,S) thin films and resulting in the decay of carrier lifetime. Due to the higher oxygen flux, the surface roughness is aggravated, the surface defects rose and the non-radiative recombination of carriers is also enhanced, which leads to the decay of the τ1 lifetime. This will introduce defects at the interface in the subsequent deposition of AZO thin films, and increase the interface recombination between the window layer and the buffer layer. Through XPS analysis, it can be found that when the oxygen flux increases to 0.4 sccm, the proportion of S oxidized to SO32− and SO42− in the films increases sharply. And these two substances will become the defects trapping carriers in the thin films, resulting in the reduction of the carrier lifetime. Furthermore, based on the TEM results of ref. 34, the ZnS impurity is grown nearly coherently to the ZnO phase when the Zn(O,S) buffer layer was prepared with high S concentration. Thus, we speculate that the sulfites and sulfates might be also grown nearly coherently to the ZnO phase for the Zn(O,S) buffer layer prepared with high O concentration.
In summary, according to the analyzed XRD, Raman, and XPS results, it has been identified that the possible present impurity phases are ZnS (with the higher ratio of S/(S + O) around 0.6), SO32− and SO42− (with the lower ratio of S/(S + O) around 0.3) in the Zn(O,S) thin films. And we can observe that the presence of the ZnS impurity phase in the Zn(O,S) thin films with the oxygen flux of 0.1 sccm leads to a larger CBO at the buffer/absorber interface. At the same time, only the single Zn(O,S) phase exists in the buffer layer when the oxygen flux is 0.2 sccm. A few sulfates are observed in the Zn(O,S) buffer layer when the oxygen flux rises to 0.3 sccm. By comparison, excessive impurities are present in the films with the oxygen flux of 0.4 sccm, deteriorating the semiconductor properties and decaying the carrier lifetime.
3.2 The simulation of Zn(O,S)/CIGS heterojunction solar cells
wxAMPS software is employed to further investigate the relationship between the impurity phases in the buffer layer and the conduction band offset in the devices. The CdS/CIGS-based structure is utilized as the baseline and the simulation process was conducted with Zn(O,S) instead of the CdS and i-ZnO layers. All the simulation parameters are listed in Table S5.† The thickness of Zn(O,S) is set to 50 nm and the CIGS absorber layer is simulated to gradient bandgap variation. The electron affinity of the CIGS absorber at the buffer/absorber interface is set to 4.5 eV. The theoretical bandgap and electron affinity at the different S/(S + O) ratios are presented in Table 2. The S concentration in the Zn(O,S) thin films is 0.58, 0.54, 0.28, and 0.27, respectively (XRF results as shown in Table 1). According to our analyzed results of intermediate phases, we set the bandgap of the Zn(O,S) thin films with the oxygen flux of 0.1 sccm to be deliberately larger than that of the films with 0.2 sccm oxygen flux due to the existence of the ZnS impurity phase (Eg = 3.68 eV). Similarly, we set the defect density in the bulk of Zn(O,S) films with the oxygen flux of 0.4 sccm to be higher than that of the thin films with the oxygen flux of 0.3 sccm, which is attributed to the presence of more sulfates (SO32− and SO42− based on our Raman and XPS results) with the excessive oxygen.

The simulation results are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows that the J–V curve is clearly distorted when the oxygen flux is 0.1 sccm, indicating that the larger CBO (as shown in Fig. 5b) of the Zn(O,S) thin films mixed with the ZnS impurity phase extremely affected the carrier transport and consequently resulted in the poor device performance. However, the device with a similar CBO value at the Zn(O,S)/CIGS interface, whose oxygen flux is 0.2 sccm, does not present the highest efficiency though only the single Zn(O,S) phase is observed in the buffer layer. According to the analyzed simulation results, we can assume that the larger CBO value with a higher S concentration of approximately 0.6 is the dominant factor rather than the impurity phases in the case of 0.1 sccm and 0.2 sccm oxygen fluxes, which consequently obstruct the carrier transport. Furthermore, the simulated champion CIGS solar cell is achieved when the ratio of S/(S + O) is about 0.3 as shown in Fig. 5a. This result demonstrates that there is an appropriate CBO value at the buffer/absorber interface when the oxygen flux is 0.3 sccm as shown in Fig. 5b, though there are a few sulfates in the bulk of the Zn(O,S) films. (The position of the VB and CB with 0.3 sccm oxygen flux in Fig. 5b is overlapped with that of 0.4 sccm oxygen flux. There are two reasons to explain this phenomenon: first, the bandgap and electron affinity of 0.3 sccm and 0.4 sccm are set at the same values due to the similar S contents of 0.28 and 0.27 as seen in Table 2. Second, the only difference between these two samples is the amount of defect states based on our Raman, XPS and TRPL results, which affects the recombination rate at the buffer/absorber interface, rather than the position of the bandgap. Therefore, the bandgap position of 0.3 sccm samples is overlapped.) At the same time, the recombination of the depletion region in the samples of 0.3 sccm oxygen flux is the lowest (as shown in Fig. 5c), suggesting that the presence of little SO32− and SO42− maybe have nearly negative effects on the device efficiency. Furthermore, the solar cell performance deteriorates significantly with the excessive oxygen flux of 0.4 sccm due to a great amount of sulfates (ZnSO3 and ZnSO4) in the Zn(O,S) buffer layer observed from the Raman and XPS results. Therefore, for the samples with the oxygen fluxes of 0.3 sccm and 0.4 sccm, we can speculate that there is a certain tolerability for the existence of impurity phases in the Zn(O,S) buffer layer, as long as the concentration of the intermediate phases does not affect the CBO value.

In terms of the relationship between the impurity phases and the conduction band offset of Zn(O,S)/CIGS, we can conclude that the samples with oxygen fluxes of 0.1 sccm and 0.2 sccm with the S concentration of approximately 0.6 exhibit a larger CBO at the buffer/absorber interface. This excessive value of CBO under 0.1 sccm oxygen flux is linked with the ZnS impurity phase which is detrimental to the solar cell performance. The simulated device performance of the cell with 0.2 sccm oxygen flux is still lower than that with 0.3 sccm, though the former presents the more favourable single Zn(O,S) phase based on our XRD pattern in Fig. 2. Therefore, the larger CBO value dominates in the case of 0.2 sccm. For the case of 0.3 sccm, the few sulfate phases do not influence the solar cell performance under the condition of an appropriate CBO at the interface, meaning that a few impurities are still acceptable. However, the appropriate value of CBO does not always play a leading role. The final device performance depends on the dominant factor between the CBO value and the amount of impurity phases with various oxygen fluxes. Finally, the performance decay of the devices is shown as the oxygen flux increases to 0.4 sccm due to the excessive sulfates in the buffer layer, although the films with 0.4 sccm still exhibit a similar appropriate CBO value to those with 0.3 sccm oxygen flux. Therefore, it leads to a poor quality of the buffer layer and provides more defects at the heterojunction interface and then weakens the carrier lifetime. Consequently, the investigation on the materials and the device simulation play a significant role in guiding the following fabrication of solar cells. At the same time, the investigation on Zn(O,S) thin films under different oxygen fluxes and better understanding of the relationship between the impurity phases of the buffer layer and the conduction band offset at the interface are important to optimize the quality of the materials, which further promotes the device performance of CIGS solar cells.
3.3 The preparation of Zn(O,S)/CIGS heterojunction solar cells
For the Cd-free Zn(O,S)-based CIGS solar cells, the Zn(O,S) thin films with a thickness of about 50 nm fabricated under different oxygen fluxes are applied between the AZO and the CIGS absorber layer of the solar cells. Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curve of the CIGS solar cells and the photovoltaic parameters of the devices with different oxygen fluxes. The Zn(O,S)/CIGS solar cell with 0.1 sccm oxygen flux presents a low conversion efficiency of 5.35%, which is mainly due to the low open voltage (Voc) (478 mV) and fill factor (FF) (41.32%).
 Fig. 6  Photo J–V characteristics of the Cd-free Zn(O,S)/CIGS devices with the increase of oxygen flux in the range of 0.1 sccm to 0.4 sccm. The S/(S + O) ratio of Zn(O,S) thin films prepared with 0.1–0.4 sccm oxygen flux is 0.58, 0.54, 0.28, and 0.27, respectively, based on XRF results. 
It can be seen from Table 1 that the S/(S + O) ratio of Zn(O,S) thin films is about 0.58. Therefore, according to our simulation results, the band mismatch with the energy band of the CIGS absorption layer leads to an excessive CBO value at the interface, which blocks the transmission of photogenerated carriers. Consequently, this causes an increase of the recombination rate of current carriers and further decline of the filling factor. Furthermore, in agreement with the analysis of the materials, the generation of the ZnS impurity phase has been observed in the Zn(O,S) films with the oxygen flux of 0.1 sccm (as shown in Fig. 2), leading to a larger bandgap due to the Eg of ZnS (3.68 eV). This result reveals that the ZnS impurity phase definitely affects the CBO value at the Zn(O,S)/CIGS interface, thereby distorting the J–V curve. The conversion efficiency of the cells with the Zn(O,S) buffer layer prepared under the oxygen flux of 0.2 sccm is conspicuously improved to 10.89%. By comparison with the device with 0.1 sccm oxygen flux, in particular, the FF (from 41.32% to 59.43%) is significantly enhanced by 43.82% among all the device parameters, which is attributed to the elimination of the ZnS intermediate phase. Therefore, it reveals that better understanding of the intermediate structure of Zn(O,S) thin films with various oxygen fluxes is an effective guidance to optimize the solar cell performance. However, the conversion efficiency of the solar cell with 0.2 sccm oxygen flux is still lower than that of the device with 0.3 sccm (as shown in Fig. 6 and 7). This is mainly attributed to the large CBO value instead of the impurity phase, which is verified by our simulation results. Therefore, it also indicates that the CBO value at the buffer/absorber interface is the dominant factor compared with the intermediate impurity phases in the Zn(O,S) buffer layer in the case of oxygen fluxes of 0.1 sccm and 0.2 sccm. Further conversion efficiency enhancement is obtained by implementing the Zn(O,S) thin films fabricated under the oxygen flux of 0.3 sccm, in terms of the appropriate CBO at the Zn(O,S)/CIGS interface, though the existence of SO32− and SO42− is observed in the Zn(O,S) films based on the discussed Raman and XPS analysis. The champion device exhibits a comparatively high Voc of 592 mV, a short circuit density (Jsc) of 31.63 mA cm−2 and an increased FF of 71.24%, achieving a conversion efficiency of 13.34%. Similarly, among all the parameters of solar cells, the FF achieves the highest absolute gain of 72.41% (as shown in Table 3) compared with the counterpart with 0.1 sccm.

This result shows that an appropriate CBO value plays an important role in carrier transport in order to further improve the solar cell performance. It also demonstrates that the few impurity phases of ZnSO3 and ZnSO4 can be tolerated in the buffer layer. Furthermore, when the oxygen flux is 0.4 sccm, the roughness of the thin film surface is the largest (as analyzed in Fig. 1d). Besides, the ratios of SO32− and SO42− in the buffer layer increase sharply and the carrier lifetime decreases, which aggravates the device performance. This is consistent with the discussed Raman, XPS and TRPL results (as shown in Fig. 2–4). This analysis is reflected in the decreased Jsc (−7.45%) in comparison with the cell with the oxygen flux of 0.1 sccm. In other words, this result also indicates that the final device performance is a comprehensive result of the impurity phases and the CBO value from the view point of the buffer layer. Compared with the solar cell (with a conversion efficiency of 14.40%) with the traditional CdS buffer layer, the value of Voc decreases sharply (as shown in Fig. 7 and the specific statistical data are listed in Table S6†), which is probably attributed to the sputtering damage at the Zn(O,S)/CIGS interface. Thus, the method to mitigate the sputtering damage during the fabrication process is an important issue for future investigation. Furthermore, the stability of PV parameters was also measured. The statistical information of PV parameters tested before and after half a year is listed respectively in Tables S6 and S7 in the ESI.† It indicates that the performance of these CIGS solar cells is barely changed after half a year, which shows the long-term stability of CIGS solar cells.
4. Conclusions
In this work, the effect of oxygen flux on the S/(S + O) ratio of the Zn(O,S) buffer layer for Cd-free CIGS solar cells has been investigated. At the same time, the micro structures at intermediate compositions with various oxygen fluxes have been analyzed. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationship between the impurity phases in the buffer layer and the CBO value at the buffer/absorber interface. We reveal that the pure ZnS phase is observed with the low oxygen flux of 0.1 sccm, while the Zn(O,S) phase is observed with the high oxygen flux of 0.2 sccm during the sputtering process. A few SO32− and SO42− impurity phases are observed with the oxygen flux of 0.3 sccm, while more sulfates (ZnSO3 and ZnSO4) are observed with the oxygen flux of 0.4 sccm, bringing out the defects trapping carriers in the Zn(O,S) thin films. The TRPL results show that the carrier lifetime is strongly affected by the oxygen flux at the Zn(O,S)/CIGS interface states, leading to a significant influence on the device performance. Besides, we also analyzed the influence of the intermediate phases on the conduction band offset and device performance based on the wxAMPS simulation results. We discuss that both the larger CBO value and ZnS impurity phase exacerbate the device performance under the oxygen flux of 0.1 sccm. Furthermore, the conversion efficiency under 0.2 sccm oxygen flux is still lower than that under 0.3 sccm oxygen flux, meaning that the CBO value plays a leading role in the case of the samples with the oxygen flux of 0.2 sccm. For the samples with the oxygen flux of 0.3 sccm, there is a tolerability for the presence of impurity phases, as long as the impurity phases are not enough to alter the CBO value at the buffer/absorber interface and do not have a significant negative effect on the carrier transport properties. An appropriate conduction band offset at the buffer/absorber interface for the samples is observed with the oxygen flux of 0.4 sccm; however excessive impurity phases are formed, resulting in the deterioration of device performance. Thus, the solar cell performance is guided by the dominant role between the value of CBO at the interface and the amount of impurity phases. The value of CBO dominates the device performance in the case of lower oxygen flux (0.1 sccm, 0.2 sccm and 0.3 sccm) with the fewer impurities. By contrast, the excessive impurities play a leading role in the case of higher oxygen flux of 0.4 sccm, even though the CBO value is appropriate at this time. This work makes a contribution to further understand the relationship between the impurity phases in the buffer layer and the value of conduction band offset at the buffer/absorber interface. Besides, the connection of the impurities and CBO value should also be considered in the preparation of other buffer layers, which is beneficial for a deeper comprehension of the preparation of high efficiency chalcopyrite solar cells.
