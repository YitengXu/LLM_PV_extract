    , Accepted 28th June 2015First published on 1st July 2015AbstractSingle-crystalline GeS nanoribbons were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition for the first time. Structural characterization revealed that the nanoribbons grow along the [01] direction with a thickness of 20–50 nm, a width of several micrometers and a length of hundreds of micrometers. The GeS nanoribbons show a p-type behavior verified from the field effect transport measurement. The nanoribbon photodetectors respond to the entire visible incident light with a response edge at around 750 nm consistent with the band gap absorption of GeS. A strong nonlinear light-intensity-dependent response was observed between the measured illumination intensity from 0.25 to 212 μW cm−2. Under 530 nm light illumination, the maximum responsivity and external quantum efficiency are 139.9 A W−1 and 32730%, respectively. These results indicate that GeS nanoribbon is a promising semiconducting nanomaterial for high performance broadband visible-light sensing applications.
1. Introduction
Van der Waals type layered semiconductors have recently attracted wide attention due to their analogous layered structure to graphene.1 Among them, narrow band gap semiconductors, such as MoS2, WS2, GaS, GaSe, etc. offer promising optoelectronic properties for visible-light-absorbing components integrated in photodetectors, photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical cells.2 For a compound semiconductor, the photo-electron conversion efficiency strongly relies on its crystallinity. Thanks to the tape-assisted micromechanical exfoliation from their layered bulk crystals, microscale single-crystalline flakes with a few or a multi-layer in thickness and a microscale in width can be readily obtained. Their intrinsic photoresponse properties can be subsequently investigated based on the photodetector fabricated using a sophisticated electron beam lithography (EBL) technique. The high-crystallinity generally guarantees an outstanding photoresponse performance. For example, the micromechanical exfoliated few layered GaS showed excellent photoresponse properties with a photo-response value of 64.43 A W−1 and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12621%.3
Although micromechanical exfoliation combined with EBL greatly accelerates the investigation of fundamental electrical and optoelectrical properties of the layered semiconducting nanomaterials, high-yield and reproducible synthesis of those nanomaterials is highly desired from the application point of view. For layered materials, because of their layered crystal structural nature, two-dimensional (2D) planar growth is thermodynamically preferred.4 However, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures of those layered materials can be rationally synthesized in a highly anisotropic growth environment. Note that, in the past ten years, tremendous single-crystalline 1D semiconducting nanomaterials have been synthesized using the self-organized crystal growth method.5,6 Recently, there have also been many reports on the synthesis of a layered semiconductor in the 1D form.7–10 They have been demonstrated as photodetectors with a much improved photo-sensing performance compared with their polycrystalline film and bulk counterparts.11 More importantly, these single-crystalline 1D photo-sensing nanomaterials are of particular interest for flexible photodetectors.8
GeS, as a layered semiconductor with a distorted rock-salt orthorhombic structure14 and a p-type semiconductor with a band gap of 1.65 eV,12 is considered to be a photovoltaic material for a solar cell.13 To date, various kinds of nanostructured GeS have been reported, such as nanosheets,13 nanoflowers,15 nanowire–nanosheet epitaxial structures,16 nanoparticles, etc.17 However, to the best of our knowledge no literature has been reported on the synthesis of single-crystalline 1D GeS nanomaterials. Furthermore, the photoresponse properties of nanostructured single-crystalline GeS have not been explored. Here, we report the synthesis and photoresponse properties of single-crystalline GeS nanoribbons. The photodetectors based on GeS nanoribbons show high sensitivity and stability to visible light, which enable them to function at extremely low illumination intensities.
2. Experimental section
The nanoribbons were synthesized in a horizontal single-zone tube furnace. In a typical synthesis, a quartz boat loaded with 10 mg of the GeS powder (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was placed at the center of a quartz tube. Si substrates coated with a 5 nm thermally evaporated Au film or coated with GeS microparticles were then placed downstream side from the furnace center. The quartz tube was evacuated to 0.1 Pa and subsequently flushed with high-purity (5 N) Ar gas for three times. After that, Ar gas with a flow rate of 50 sccm was introduced into the quartz tube and the pressure in the tube was maintained at 60 Torr. Then the temperature of the furnace was raised to 450 °C in 20 min and kept for 10 min. The corresponding substrate temperature was about 340 °C. After the deposition, the furnace was cooled to room temperature naturally.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source. The morphology and the crystal structure of the products were analyzed using a JEOL-6400 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM), and a JEOL-2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM, operated at 200 kV), respectively. The thickness of the nanoribbons was measured using a Dimension 3000 atomic force miscroscope (AFM).
For device fabrication, the GeS nanoribbons were transferred to a SiO2/Si substrate using a physical dry transfer technique18 which facilitates the nanoribbon alignment and eliminates the possible contamination induced from the solution in the conventional ultrasonic dispersion method. A standard photolithography technique was used to define contact electrodes with a gap width of 5 μm. A Ti (100 nm) film that served as an electrode was deposited by e-beam evaporation. Monochromatic illumination was provided by a Zolix Omni-300 monochrometer with a supercontinuum laser source (SC-Pro, Wuhan Yangtz Soton Laser). The illumination light power intensity was measured using a Newport 1954 power meter. The current–voltage (I–V) and the current–time (I–T) were recorded using an Agilent B2902A source unit in a home-made probe station.
3. Results and discussion
We found that without Au film or GeS microparticle coating, the products are only randomly orientated nanosheets.15 While with Au film or GeS microparticle coating, the nanoribbons can be routinely obtained under the above-mentioned growth conditions. The morphology and the crystal structure of the as-grown nanoribbons are similar except that the yield of nanoribbons grown on the Au thin film substrate is slightly higher than that grown on the microparticle coated substrate (see ESI,† Fig. S1). Therefore, our structural characterization and device fabrication were focused on the nanoribbons grown on Au thin film substrates. To determine the crystal structure of the product, the XRD pattern of the product was recorded and the result is shown in Fig. 1a. All diffraction peaks can be indexed according to the orthorhombic structured GeS with lattice constants of a = 1.047 nm, b = 0.4297 nm, and c = 0.3641 nm (JCPDS No. 71-0306). The morphology of the product was examined by SEM as shown in Fig. 1b and c. The product consists of large quantities of nanoribbons. The width of the nanoribbons is of several micrometers and the length is of hundreds of micrometers. The thickness of the nanoribbons determined by AFM is found to be in the range of about 20–50 nm. A typical AFM image is shown in Fig. 1d. The height profile (inset in Fig. 1d) along the white line indicates that the nanoribbon has a thickness of 41 nm. A typical TEM image of the nanoribbon is shown in Fig. 1e. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) is shown in the inset of Fig. 1e. Clear diffraction spots suggest its good crystallinity. The corresponding high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the nanoribbon is shown in Fig. 1f. A lattice spacing of 0.278 nm can be recognized and corresponds to the {011} family planes of the orthorhombic structured GeS. The typical nanoribbon growth direction was found along [01]. Based on further detailed crystal structure characterization, we believe that the growth of GeS nanoribbons can be rationally attributed to the so-called vapor–solid (VS) rather than the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism (see ESI,† Fig. S2).

The CVD-grown 1D GeS nanoribbons with high crystallinity offer a good material platform for photo-detecting devices. To investigate its photoresponse properties, the performance of the GeS nanoribbon photodetector working in the photoconductive mode was measured. An optical image of the photodetector is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. To measure the photoresponsivity of the device, monochromatic light was used to perpendicularly illuminate onto the device surface and the corresponding current versus voltage (I–V) curves were recorded. The I–V curves of the photodetector exposed to incident light with different wavelengths and under dark conditions are shown in Fig. 2a. The nonlinearity and asymmetry of the curves indicate a non-Ohmic contact between the Ti electrodes and the nanoribbon. Compared with the dark state, currents at the same bias voltage are higher under illumination, indicating that the device is photosensitive. In order to further investigate the wavelength dependent photoresponse, photocurrent as a function of wavelength was measured and the result is shown in Fig. 2b. With the increase in wavelength, the photocurrent gradually decreases. The variation trend of photocurrent with wavelength is consistent with the results in Fig. 2a. As the wavelength approaches the band edge of GeS (1.65 eV,12 corresponding to 750 nm), the photocurrent drops rapidly. Upon further increasing the wavelength, no detectable photocurrent was observed. The illumination-wavelength-dependent photocurrent in a vacuum exhibits the same trend compared with that in air (see ESI,† Fig. S3).

We also found that the GeS nanoribbon photoresponsivity shows strong nonlinear light-intensity-dependent characteristics. The photocurrent as a function of light intensity for wavelengths of 530, 630, and 700 nm is shown in Fig. 3a. All these three curves are nonlinear and the curves can be fitted using the formula Iph = αPβ(1)where Iph is the photocurrent (A), α is a coefficient, β is the exponent, P is the optical power (μW cm−2). Fitting of the curves resulted in Iph = 5.51 × 10−11P0.367, Iph = 3.16 × 10−11P0.385, and Iph = 1.52 × 10−11P0.472 for wavelengths of 530, 630, and 700 nm, respectively. We note that such a nonlinear light-intensity-dependent property, i.e., the non-unity exponent, has also been observed in many nanostructure-based photodetectors, such as ZrS3 nanoribbons,8 CdTe nanoribbons,20 CuO nanowires,21 In2S3 nanowires,22etc., which is a result of the complex processes of electron–hole generation, trapping, and recombination in the semiconductor.23,24

Responsivity (R) is an important parameter determining the detecting capability of a photodetector, which is defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power of incident light on the effective area of a photodetector. R can be expressed as R = Iph/Φ(2)Here Φ is the light power irradiated on the device and can be written as Φ = PS, where S is the exposure area of the nanoribbons. The corresponding responsivity as a function of light intensity is shown in Fig. 3b. As can be seen, lower light intensity gets higher responsivity. As the light intensity increases, the responsivity drastically decreases. The maximum responsivities in our measurement are 139.9, 62.8, and 47.1 A W−1 for wavelengths of 530, 630, and 700 nm, respectively. External quantum efficiency (EQE) is related to the number of electron–hole pairs excited by one absorbed photon, and is defined as EQE = hcR/eλ(3)where h is Plank's constant, c is the velocity of light, e is the electronic charge, and λ is the exciting wavelength. According to the definition of EQE, EQE is proportional to R for a predefined excitation light. The maximum EQEs for the exciting light with wavelengths of 530, 630, and 700 nm are 32730%, 12360%, and 8340%, respectively. These values are much higher compared with other 1D semiconductor detectors, such as HfS3 nanoribbons,9 In2Se3 nanowires.25 These results imply that our GeS nanoribbons are promising candidates for high-selectivity and high sensitivity nanoscale photodetectors.
To elucidate the high responsibility and distinctive nonlinear photoresponse, we measured field effect transport properties of the as-grown GeS nanoribbon. The results indicate that the GeS nanobelt is a p-type semiconductor, which is consistent with bulk GeS [see ESI,† Fig. S4]. The p-type behavior of a GeS nanoribbon is consistent with the bulk GeS reported in the literature, which can be attributed to the presence of Ge vacancies.19 The high responsivity of the GeS nanoribbon photodetector is likely to stem from the combined effects of photocarrier multiplication inside the nanoribbon, carrier injection from the contacts, and surface states.21 Particularly for nanomaterial, surface adsorption effect is pronounced. When the GeS nanoribbon is illuminated with incident light above its absorption band gap, photo-excited electron–hole pairs are generated and separated with external bias voltage. Sufficient amount of O2 adsorbate on the nanoribbon surface can trap the photo-produced electrons. The photo-produced electrons participating in adsorption leave behind a paired hole that can contribute to the conduction process. In addition, the conduction bands increase due to the adsorption of O2, which draws additional holes from the electrodes.26 Therefore, the GeS nanoribbon photodetector exhibits higher responsivity at lower incident light intensity. The decrease in the responsivity at relatively high light intensity is primarily attributed to electron-trap saturation and increase in electron–hole recombination. As the traps are filled with electrons, the quasi-Fermi energy level increases, which leads to the increased number of free electrons in the system. As a result, the probability of electron–hole recombination increases at high illumination intensity.
Repeatability and response speed are also key parameters for a photodetector. We measured the device photoreponse as a function of time under 530 nm light illumination with an intensity of 8.5 μW cm−2. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The switching behavior of the current with light on and off can clearly be observed. The on/off ratio of the current is 4.54. The reproducibility of the photocurrent suggests the high stability of the device. The magnified part of the current vs. time curve is shown in Fig. 4b. The time needed for the current to increase from 10% to 90% of the peak value or vice versa is defined as the rise time and fall time, respectively. Hence, the rise time and the fall time can be determined to be 0.85 and 4.05 s, respectively. The time constant for the rise time is faster than the fall time, which indicates that charge carrier traps and defect states are involved in this process.28

Due to a semiconducting nanomaterial with a high surface-to-volume ratio and above-mentioned adsorbate-involved charge carrier generation, the surface adsorbate variation may influence the photoresponse. The environment sensitive photoresponse of 1D nanomaterials has been observed in many 1D nanostructures, such as HfS3 nanobelts,12 ZnO nanowires,26etc. We measured the current–time curves with chopped 530 nm incident light in air and in a vacuum to explore the working environment sensitive photoresponse of GeS nanoribbons. The measured results are shown in Fig. 5. The dark current of the device in a vacuum and in air is about 1.78 × 10−11 A and 2.72 × 10−11 A, respectively. The photocurrent in air is about 9.87 × 10−11 A, which is higher than that in a vacuum (7.47 × 10−11 A). The reduced photocurrent in a vacuum can be attributed to the effect of removing of surface adsorbed O2 from a p-type semiconductor. In the dark state, the adsorbed O2 can trap electrons so that the conduction band and the valance band at the nanoribbon surface increase.26 The increase in the valance band leads to the increase in hole concentration near the surface. Since the adsorbed O2 is rare in a vacuum, the dark current in a vacuum should be smaller than that in air, which is consistent with our result. As mentioned above, the photo-generated electrons can be trapped by adsorbed O2, leading to the increased photocurrent. Due to the rare adsorbed O2 in a vacuum, the photocurrent in a vacuum gets reduced compared to that in air. Note that a similar behavior has also been observed in other p-type nanostructured semiconductors, such as HfS3 nanoribbons.9 And such a phenomenon is different from that of n-type semiconductors, where the photocurrent gets enhanced in a vacuum compared with that in air.26,27

4. Conclusion
Single-crystalline GeS nanoribbons were synthesized using a chemical vapor deposition method for the first time. The structural characterization indicates that the GeS nanoribbons are single-crystalline and grow along the [01] direction. They have a thickness of 20–50 nm, a width of several micrometers and a length of hundreds of micrometers. Electrical transport measurements verify that they exhibit a p-type semiconducting behavior. The fabricated GeS nanoribbon photodetectors respond to the whole visible incident light with a response edge at around 750 nm. Under the illumination of 530, 630, and 700 nm light, the maximum responsivities are 139.9, 62.8, and 47.1 A W−1, respectively. And the photoresponse shows a strong nonlinear light-intensity-dependence. These results reveal that GeS nanoribbons are promising for potential applications in visible-light selective photo-sensing devices.
