    , Accepted 6th July 2016First published on 6th July 2016AbstractCatechol (1,2-dihydroxy benzene) moieties are being widely used today in new adhesive technologies. Understanding their mechanism of action is therefore of high importance for developing their applications in materials science. This paper describes a single-molecule study of the interactions between catechol-related amino acid residues and a well-defined titanium dioxide (TiO2) surface. It is the first quantified measurement of the adhesion of these residues with a well-defined TiO2 surface. Single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements with AFM determined the role of different substitutions of the catechol moiety on the aromatic ring in the adhesion to the surface. These results shed light on the nature of interactions between these residues and inorganic metal oxide surfaces. This information is important for the design and fabrication of catechol-based materials such as hydrogels, coatings, and composites. Specifically, the interaction with TiO2 is important for the development of solar cells.
Introduction
The ability to anchor peptides and other molecules such as DNA strands, polymers, and alkanes to inorganic surfaces is important for many areas of research. This includes the development of biosensors, coatings, thin films, and other functional materials.1–3
The most commonly used moiety that binds organic entities to inorganic surfaces is thiol. Through this moiety, alkanethiols form a monolayer (a self-assembled monolayer, SAM) on metals such as gold, silver, copper, palladium, platinum, and mercury. The high affinity of thiols towards the surfaces of noble and coinage metals makes it possible to generate well-defined organic surfaces with useful and highly alterable chemical functionalities at the exposed interface. In this context, the amino acid cysteine, which contains a thiol moiety, is very useful for anchoring peptides and other biopolymers to inorganic surfaces.4–7 Recently, the binding of carboxylate groups to metal oxide surfaces such as titania or silica was demonstrated as a preferential peptide binding because of their strong electrostatic interactions with charged surfaces.8
Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) with AFM can measure the interactions between a specific molecule and inorganic materials and therefore can facilitate understanding the interactions at this interface. We previously measured the rupture force of individual amino acid residues using this system.9,53 Recently Kaneko and his co-workers measured the force between different hydroxybenzoic acid monomers on a surface and a Si3N4 cantilever. Importantly, they showed that as the number of hydroxyl groups increased, the number of single-molecule interactions increased, and the rupture force was stronger.10 The advantage of using SMFS over other methods that measure these interactions in bulk (e.g., Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)) lies in the fact that it directly measures a single molecule rather than an assembly of molecules, which may have both static and dynamic heterogeneities among the different molecules within an assembly. In this context, SMFS provides both quantitative and comprehensive measurement of the force required to unbind a single molecule from a desired surface.11,12
In the course of SMFS studies, Messersmith and his co-workers showed that the amino acid 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA) has a large rupture force from a titanium surface.13 DOPA is the main constituent of the adhesive proteins of marine mussels (mussel foot proteins (MPFs)).14,15 The oxidized form of DOPA plays an important role as a cross linker agent that leads to solidification of the secreted liquid protein adhesive.16,17 These proteins allow marine mussels to strongly attach to various surfaces in seawater. The strong adhesion of DOPA to inorganic surfaces led to the development of a new adhesive technology.18–20
A few SMFS experiments revealed the interactions of DOPA with inorganic surfaces.13,21,22 The results suggest that DOPA adheres to different inorganic surfaces. In addition, they showed that a single DOPA residue interacts with titanium by a fully reversible high-strength noncovalent interaction through the catechol moiety.13 To determine how the density of the binding sites influences a single chain adhesion, Butt et al. performed SMFS measurements with their synthesized statistical copolymers, which contained amine-terminated side groups and DOPA. The discrete catechol groups were capable of adsorbing to titanium with a short-range constant attractive force.22 Their study also showed that the attractive forces were similar for all catechol-containing copolymers irrespective of the catechol content. Recently Wang et al. developed a “multiple fishhook” protocol and were able to quantify the binding strength as well as binding modes of DOPA towards various surfaces including Au, Ti, Si, mica and alumina.21
Using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), Akemi and Garrell showed that DOPA-containing peptides can strongly adsorb on a variety of inorganic materials such as Au, Fe(III) compounds, and Ag.23 Later on, Messersmith and his colleagues demonstrated the use of DOPA in anchoring the antifouling polymer poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to surfaces.24 In addition, they demonstrated the use of catechol moieties in various applications.20,25 Recently, our group designed a tripeptide that uses DOPA as an anchoring moiety. This peptide can self-assemble into a functional coating that resists biofouling.26 By using this strategy, we were able to completely prevent protein adsorption and interrupt the process of biofilm formation.26
Since DOPA and its related compounds are very useful for anchoring different molecules to surfaces, understanding their mechanism of interaction is crucial for the design and development of new materials, adhesives, and coatings. Here, we studied how different substitutions of the catechol moiety on the aromatic ring would affect the adhesion of the amino acid residue to the surface. To this end, we chose to study the surface of titanium dioxide (TiO2) because among the several important metal oxides, TiO2 is the most suitable and promising semiconductor catalyst in heterogeneous photocatalysis. This is due to its high physical and chemical stability, low toxicity, high oxidizing power and low price.27 Solar cells based on dye-sensitized mesoporous films of TiO2 are low-cost alternatives to conventional solid-state devices.28 Impressive solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies have been achieved with such films when used in conjunction with liquid electrolytes.29 In addition, catechol moieties form bidentate surface structures with metal oxide surfaces such as TiO2.30,31 Here, we quantitatively measured the interactions between catechol-related moieties and a well-defined TiO2 surface using a single-molecule force measurement technique. Our results revealed the complex characteristics of the binding of DOPA and its substituted derivatives.
Experimental design
We compared between the following amino acid residues: (i) phenylalanine (Phe), which does not contain a hydroxyl (–OH) group substituent on its benzene ring, (ii) tyrosine (Tyr), bearing one –OH substituent, (iii) L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) with two consecutive –OH groups (catechol group), (iv) 6-hydroxy-L-DOPA (6-OH-DOPA) with three hydroxyl groups, and (iv) 6-nitro-L-DOPA (6-NO2-DOPA) with an electron-withdrawing NO2 group as an aromatic substituent (Fig. 1). All amino acids had a tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected N-terminus to avoid electrostatic interactions between the N-termini of the amino acid and the substrate. We measured the force of adhesion of these amino acid residues to TiO2 surfaces using SMFS. To prepare the TiO2 substrate, we coated a clean silicon wafer (100) with TiO2 nanoparticles (average size 20–25 nm) and annealed them at 250 °C for two hours in air (Fig. S1 and S2, see the ESI† for the experimental procedure).
 Fig. 1  The experimental design: (A) a schematic illustration of the SMFS experimental set-up for studying the interactions between the different amino acid moieties and the TiO2 surface. (B) The structure of the studied amino acids; the C-termini of the amino acid residues were coupled through polyethylene glycol (PEG, the flexible linker) to the AFM tip and the N-termini were protected with Boc. 
After chemically modifying the AFM tip, we wetted the TiO2 surface by using Tris buffer (50 mM, pH = 7.2) and measured the rupture force of the amino acid residue from the surface. In a typical experiment the cantilever was moved to the surface with a certain constant speed and held on the surface at a constant force of ∼200 pN. This allowed the amino acid residue to physically absorb on the surface. Then, the cantilever was immediately retracted at the same speed to break the interaction between the amino acid residue and the TiO2 surface. These measurements generated the force versus distance (F–D) curves (Fig. S4†) with a characteristic point of separation of the tip from the surface and a single-molecule adhesion event.32 The first peak in the retract section originates from non-specific interactions between the tip and the TiO2 surface. The second peak indicates specific interactions between the amino acid residue and the TiO2 surface. Several hundred (800–1200) F–D curves were recorded with at least two modified tips for each of the amino acids and accounted for 10–30% of the specific binding events. This low statistical probability of binding events ensures that the measurement is indeed based on the single-molecule surface interaction.13 The F–D curves, which represent successful binding events, were fitted to the worm-like chain (WLC) model. The recorded events (n ≈ 60–140) were used to construct histograms of the unbinding forces. A Gaussian fit applied to these histograms calculated the average adhesion force, known as the most probable force (MPF) (Fig. 2A–C). These results show that all of the examined amino acid residues interacted with the TiO2 surface.

The y and x error bars represent the variance of the Gaussian fit and the standard deviation of the apparent loading rate (r) calculated from at least 20 different F–D curves. 
Results and discussion
We compared the MPFs calculated for Phe, Tyr, and DOPA with the TiO2 surface at about the same apparent loading rate (∼4.5 nN s−1).33 While Phe and Tyr had similar MPF values of 69 ± 19 pN and 89 ± 24 pN, respectively, DOPA exhibited a much stronger rupture force, with an MPF value of 383 ± 21 pN (Table 1). This result is in agreement with previous reports on the strong binding of DOPA to inorganic surfaces.13,19

The rupture distance (xb) for DOPA was 1.15 Å shorter than the distance for Tyr (1.66 Å) and Phe (1.74 Å). Furthermore, the bond dissociation rate at equilibrium (Koff) for DOPA was much lower than that for Tyr and Phe and followed the order 0.002 s−1 (DOPA) < 3.63 s−1 (Tyr) < 8.67 s−1 (Phe). The higher rupture forces are mainly due to a shorter distance to the transition state (xb). Note that the xb values are not related to the bond length. The xb value is the difference between the bonded state and the rupture transition state. Similarly, ΔG is not related to the bond strength. Here ΔG is the rupture of a bond by force. It is considered as kinetic energy, and it depends on the free energy difference in the bond state and the transition state.21 Furthermore, from our analysis the bond dissociation energy (ΔG) for DOPA–TiO2 is 49.47 kJ mol−1. This value is higher than the ΔG values for the other two examined amino acid residues (Tyr = 30.93 kJ mol−1 and Phe = 28.78 kJ mol−1). Based on the values of xb, it is possible to gain information about the types of interactions involved in the adhesion in a specified region of ΔG.21 The values of xb (1.66 Å) and ΔG (30.93 kJ mol−1) obtained for the interactions of Tyr with TiO2 imply that Tyr binds this surface through hydrogen bonds34,35 or weak coordination interactions.36,37 Hydrophobic interactions can account for the binding of Phe.9,38,39 The xb value for coordination bonds is longer (∼1.2 Å) than the xb value of covalent bonds (0.007 Å). However, the free energy barrier is similar (up to ∼50 kJ mol−1).21 The calculated values of xb (1.15 Å) and ΔG suggest the important role of coordination bonds in the strong interaction between DOPA and TiO2. It is well known that catechol derivatives can form stable complexes with the metal atoms of certain metal oxides.40,41 To confirm the suggestion that coordinative interactions through the catechol moieties of DOPA cause the strong adhesion of DOPA to TiO2, we investigated the interactions between oxidized DOPA and a TiO2 surface. Oxidation of the catechol moiety of DOPA occurs in alkaline medium. This leads to the formation of quinones. This oxidation reaction plays a major role in the bulk solidification of mussel glues as the quinones further react with cross-linking adhesive proteins via aryl–aryl coupling (di-DOPA formation).16,42 The highly reactive nature of the semi-quinones and quinones makes the quantitative measurement of the oxidized DOPA with inorganic surfaces complicated. We therefore used a large excess of unreactive methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) during tip functionalization. The excess of MTES abolished the possible intermolecular reactions between the oxidized DOPA species and allowed us to measure the interactions between DOPA and TiO2. Interestingly, during force measurements in basic medium (pH = 9.8), we obtained a bimodal force distribution of signals consisting of large or small forces recorded at similar pull-off distances (Fig. 3B). Statistical analysis of the data produced two different non-overlapping histograms with MPF values of 108 ± 31 pN (frequency = 75%) and 362 ± 21 pN (frequency = 25%) (Table 1). We suggest that this bimodal force distribution is due to the single-molecule variation between two resonating states, DOPA-enol and DOPA-quinone, which exists in equilibrium in basic medium (Fig. 3B). The equilibrium between these two states is shifted toward DOPA-quinone structures at high pH values (pKa = 9.2).43 Considering the force distribution data in Fig. 3B and the data obtained at neutral pH (Fig. 2C), the higher force values are assigned to the interaction of non-oxidized DOPA (DOPA-enol) with TiO2 (strong catechol–TiO2 coordinative binding). We assumed that the low-force signal corresponds to the interaction of DOPA-quinone and its resonance structures with TiO2 because these signals appeared only under oxidizing conditions in alkaline medium. We used the xb value (1.15 Å) obtained for unoxidized DOPA–TiO2 in neutral medium (pH = 7.2) to calculate the ΔG value for the interaction between DOPA-quinone and TiO2 in basic medium (pH = 9.8). The calculated ΔG was only 29.54 kJ mol−1 (see the ESI†). These results indicate that the oxidation of DOPA considerably reduces its adhesion to TiO2 because the complexation of the quinone moiety with the metal oxide surfaces is less probable.

(A) A pictorial representation of the coordinative interaction between a DOPA-functionalized AFM tip and a TiO2 surface. (B) Histograms of the rupture force values of DOPA from the TiO2 surface at a loading rate of 4.5 ± 0.6 nN s−1 in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH = 9.8). The bimodal force distribution was measured with averages in a low-force regime [108 ± 31 pN (105 events)] and in a high-force regime [362 ± 21 pN (35 events)]. The strong interactions are assigned to the non-oxidized DOPA (DOPA-enol) and TiO2, whereas the weak interactions are assigned to DOPA-quinone and TiO2. 
To further study the role of the catechol moiety in the adhesion of DOPA to metal oxides, we measured the interaction between N-Boc-6-hydroxy-L-DOPA and TiO2. The addition of the OH group to DOPA at the sixth position resulted in an MPF value of 422 ± 34 pN (Fig. 4A and Table 1). This MPF value is slightly higher than the MPF value of DOPA (at the comparable apparent loading rate of ∼4.5 nN s−1, Fig. 4A). The rupture distance was equal to 0.78 Å and Koff = 0.0119 s−1 (Fig. 4B). The calculated ΔG is 49.75 kJ mol−1. These values of xb and ΔG suggest that N-Boc-6-hydroxy-DOPA interacts with TiO2 through catechol-based coordinative binding. We assume that the slight increase in the MPF value results from additional hydrogen bonds between the additional –OH group and TiO2. Similarly to DOPA, N-Boc-6-hydroxy-L-DOPA also exhibited a bimodal force distribution in basic medium (pH = 9.8) with MPF values of 122 ± 27 pN (frequency = 69%) and 390 ± 41 pN (frequency = 31%) (Table 1 and Fig. 4C).

(B) The loading-rate dependence for the rupture forces; the kinetic parameters were extrapolated from the linear plot of the force vs. the logarithm of the apparent loading rate for N-Boc-6-hydroxy-L-DOPA.

(C) The histogram of the rupture force values for N-Boc-6-hydroxy-L-DOPA from TiO2 surfaces at a loading rate of 4.58 ± 0.8 nN s−1 in basic Tris buffer (50 mM, pH = 9.8). Bimodal force distributions were measured with averages in a low-force regime [122 ± 27 pN (123 events)] and in a high-force regime [390 ± 41 pN (57 events)]. The strong adhesive interactions are assigned to the DOPA-enol–TiO2 interaction, whereas the weak adhesive interactions are assigned to the DOPA-quinone–TiO2 interaction. 
Nitrocatechols are also naturally occurring molecules. Their cross-linking and complexation chemistry is similar to that of DOPA. Nitrocatechols such as nitrodopamine are biocompatible cross-linkers that can generate stable gels and coatings.44,45 We determined the rupture force of N-Boc-6-nitro-DOPA from the TiO2 substrate using SMFS. Interestingly, we obtained a bimodal distribution of the measured force consisting of large and small values registered at similar tip separation distances for DOPA in basic medium. Statistical analysis of the data generated two individual non-overlapping histograms with MPFs of 114 ± 30 pN (frequency is 57%) and 372 ± 21 pN (frequency is 43%) (Fig. 5B and Table 1). The presence of the electron-withdrawing nitro group, at the p-position, lowers the pKa of the catechol hydroxyl group (pKaOH1 ≈ 6.5 and pKaOH2 ≈ 10).44,46 This reduction enhances their acidity and hydrogen bond donor properties. It is well known that p-nitrophenol exists as two different resonance structures due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the –NO2 group.47 Similarly to p-nitrophenol, p-nitrocatechols are deprotonated at physiological pH.48 Considering the strong electron-withdrawing properties of the –NO2 group, we can assume that N-Boc-6-nitro-L-DOPA exhibits two different resonating structures that are in chemical equilibrium (Fig. 5A). Consequently, we assume that the bimodal force distribution appears because of single-molecule fluctuations between DOPA-enol and DOPA-semiquinone. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of the NO2 group shifts the equilibrium between these two states. The DOPA-semiquinone form accounts for the low-range force signals. The high-range force signals probably result from the strong coordination interaction between the catechol moiety of DOPA-enol and the TiO2 surface. Furthermore, SMFS of N-Boc-6-nitro-L-DOPA with a TiO2 surface at pH = 5.5 resulted in a similar bimodal force distribution (Fig. 5C). Here the probability of a higher force value in the range of 350–700 pN increased to 65% (MPF = 394 ± 39), whereas the possibility of having a lower force value in the range of 30–250 pN decreased to 35% (MPF = 98 ± 34) (Fig. 5C and Table 1). It is well known that at pH = 5.5 DOPA is in its reduced state (enol form) and is capable of a strong adhesion interaction.19 The strong electron-withdrawing properties of the NO2 group results in tautomerization, which leads to single-molecule fluctuations between DOPA enol and DOPA-semiquinone states. These two states are in chemical equilibrium. At pH = 5.5 the equilibrium between DOPA enol and DOPA-semiquinone states is shifted toward the DOPA-enol form, which results in an increase in the frequency of the long-range force value. Finally, we also performed SMFS experiment in which we measured the interaction of DOPA with SiO2 and a bare silicon surface. A statistical analysis of the data shows that the MPF values for DOPA–Si and DOPA–SiO2 are 74 ± 23 pN and 93 ± 34 pN respectively (Fig. S5†). These values are much lower than the MPF values obtained for the interaction of DOPA with TiO2 at a comparable loading rate. These results clearly show the strong coordinative interaction of DOPA with a TiO2 coated surface.

Bimodal force distributions were measured with averages in a low-force regime [114 ± 30 pN (81 events)] and in a high-force regime [372 ± 21 pN (60 events)]. The strong adhesive interactions are assigned to the DOPA-enol–TiO2 interaction, whereas the weak adhesive interactions are assigned to the DOPA-semiquinone–TiO2 interaction.

The strong adhesive interactions are assigned to DOPA-enol–TiO2 interactions, whereas the weak adhesive interactions are assigned to the DOPA-semiquinone–TiO2 interactions. 
Conclusions
The design of new materials and functional surfaces will benefit from obtaining a fundamental understanding of the interaction between organic (specifically proteins and peptides) and inorganic matter. Recently, the amino acid DOPA and its derivative dopamine have attracted much attention as a good binding material. DOPA and dopamine can adhere to a wide variety of materials such as oxides, metals, and polymers. Therefore, they are useful in connecting peptides, polymers, and other molecules to desired surfaces. Here, using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we measured the rupture force of DOPA and related amino acid residues to a chemically well-defined TiO2 surface. Our measurements at different pH values shed light on the nature of interactions between these materials and the equilibrium of resonating structures. The parameters evaluated from a detailed analysis of the force measurements are fundamental for advancing our understanding of the kinetics and thermodynamics of the interactions. Our results indicate that DOPA might bind to TiO2 by strong coordination bonds. This result, obtained from this study, also emphasizes that in basic medium (pH = 9.8) quinone and semiquinone do not adhere as strongly as DOPA does. Furthermore, our study shows that in neutral medium (pH = 7.2) the force of interaction for N-Boc-6-hydroxy-L-DOPA is higher than that of DOPA, and in the case of Boc-6 nitro-L-DOPA, a bimodal distribution of the force consisting of two (large or small) centered values, similar to that of DOPA in basic medium, is obtained. In slightly acidic medium (pH = 5.5) the frequency of the larger force value increases, indicating better adhesion compared with neutral medium. Based on this information, many complex features of the binding nature of DOPA and its substituted derivatives can be revealed. These results are important for the design and fabrication of new catechol-based materials, and also contribute an important step toward advancing our understanding of the mussel adhesion mechanism.

TiO2 dispersion (30%) in the mixture of solvent 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol (DEGME) and ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP) was purchased from Applied Vision Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel).
Tip functionalization
The chemical modification of the AFM tip is based on a process described before.49 The AFM cantilevers were cleaned by dipping them in ethanol for 20 minutes. After drying at room temperature, they were treated with O2 plasma for 5 minutes (Atto, Diener Electronic, Ebhausen, Germany). The tips were then suspended above (3 cm) a solution containing methyltriethoxysilane and 3-(aminopropyl)triethoxysilane in a ratio of 15:1 (v/v) in a desiccator that was connected to a vacuum pump. The desiccator was vacuumed for 2 hours. This allowed the formation of a monolayer of these two types of mixed silane compounds. The tips were then dried on a hot plate for 10 minutes at 70 °C under atmospheric conditions. After cooling at room temperature, the tips were immersed in a solution of Fmoc-PEG-NHS (MW 5000) at a concentration of 5 mM in chloroform containing 0.5% (v/v) triethylamine for 1 hour at room temperature. The tips were then extensively washed with chloroform and DMF. Deprotection of the Fmoc group of the attached PEG molecules, was performed by dipping the tips in 20% piperidine (v/v) in DMF for 30 minutes. This was followed by washing with DMF and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The amine groups of the attached PEG molecule were then coupled with the carboxyl group of the desired N-Boc-protected amino acid. Coupling was done using N-Boc amino acid/diisopropylethylamine/HBTU with a molar ratio of 1:1:1 and at a total concentration of 30 mM in 5 ml NMP for 2 hours (Scheme 1 and Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Finally, the amino acid-functionalized tips were repeatedly washed with NMP, DMF, chloroform, ethanol and water, and then dried in air.
Surface preparation
A silicon wafer (100) was cut into 0.5 cm squares using a diamond pen. The substrates were then cleaned in acetone followed by isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath and then dried by using nitrogen. 0.02 ml of ByK348, a wetting agent (5% prepared in ethanol) was added to 2 ml of 30% TiO2 dispersion. From the resulting solution, 0.2 ml was dropcast on cleaned Si substrates. Then, these drop-cast surfaces were annealed at 250 °C for 2 hours in air.

Force spectroscopy measurements were carried out using Tris buffer (50 mM, pH = 7.2 or pH = 9.8 or pH = 5.5) at 298 K, using a NanoWizards 3 (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany). The AFM cantilevers, with a spring constant ranging from 10 to 30 pN nm−1, were calibrated using the thermal fluctuation method (included in the AFM software) with an absolute uncertainty of about 10%.50 Measurements were obtained by approaching the peptide-functionalized tip to the surface until it was brought into contact with the surface, with a compression force of ∼200 pN and then immediately retracting the tip at various speeds ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 μm s−1, for a distance of ∼200 nm.
Data analysis
Prior to analysis, the deflection values (V) were converted to force by multiplying the photodiode sensitivity (V/m) and by using the experimentally determined spring constant.51 Only single adhesion events were taken into account (from 10 to 30% of the curves) ensuring >95% probability and that the adhesion event was mediated by a single bond.52 To calculate the apparent loading rate, we fitted at least 20 force vs. distance curves with the worm-like chain (WLC) model just prior to ruptures to obtain a set of loading rates, which were then used for preparing histograms of the apparent loading rates. The unbinding forces between the amino acids and TiO2 were derived from the jump in force following the separation of the cantilever from the substrate. This was done using the JPK data processing software (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany).
