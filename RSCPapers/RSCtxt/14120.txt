    , Accepted 7th July 2020First published on 27th July 2020AbstractFive novel asymmetric D–A–A′-type small molecules (SMs) consisting of a triphenylamine (TPA)-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)/5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) conjugated backbone with different terminal groups were designed and synthesized successfully. First, the ethynyl-functionalized thiophene was introduced to BT-based SMs with the terminal electron-withdrawing groups 3-phthalimide and 3-ethylrhodanineto, namely BT-1 and BT-2, respectively. Next, to improve their optical absorption, the DPP unit was used as the central unit to replace the BT unit and the electron-withdrawing groups 3-phthalimide, 3-ethylrhodanine, and 1,3-indandione acted as the terminal moiety, giving DPP-1, DPP-2 and DPP-3, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the absorption of DPP-based compounds extended to the near-infrared region,achieving materials with absorption band edges over 850 nm and a narrow bandgap of up to 1.35 eV. The BT-2-based device showed the highest open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V among the molecules due to a deeper HOMO level. Also, besides being a donor material, the BT-based molecules showed potential as acceptor materials. Although the PCE was still low, the bifunctional properties of these materials, which can be used as both donor and acceptor, should be investigated. Among these synthetic SMs, the DPP-1-based device exhibited the best PCE of 4.21% due to its most appropriate energy level and moderate bandgap.
Introduction
With the rapid development of economy, environmental pollution is becoming increasingly serious. Thus, the development and utilization of clean energy, such as solar energy, has attracted wide attention. Organic solar cells (OSCs) as the latest technology in solar power generation have been investigated in recent years owing to their low cost, light weight, high flexibility and the possibility of having different colours or semitransparency.1,2 The active layer materials are an important component of OSCs, including electron donor materials (polymers and small molecules) and electron acceptor materials (fullerenes and non-fullerenes). Compared with polymer materials, small molecules (SMs) have several advantages such as low molecular weight, well-defined chemical structure and easy purification.3–5 With the significant achievements in new materials and device optimization, PCEs over 15% have been achieved in both single-junction and tandem OSCs.6–9 However, the commercialization of OSCs requires a further improvement in their PCE by designing ideal SM materials and optimizing the device process.
There are several considerations for designing novel SM photovoltaic (PV) materials as follows: (1) narrow optical bandgap to broaden molecular absorption range; (2) appropriate molecular energy levels to increase charge dissociation and transport properties; and (3) sufficient solubility, excellent film formation and appropriate crystallinity to ensure a good interpenetrating structure of the active layer.10,11 The molecular design strategy has generally adopted various electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units in a conjugated backbone. The ‘‘donor–acceptor (D–A)’’ structure can not only easily reduce the energy bandgap (Eg), but also effectively control the PV properties of materials.12 Currently, most of the reported “D–A”-type structures are symmetrical, such as A–D–A and D–A–D, which are also the typical configurations with high efficiency.13–16 Relatively, the research on asymmetric materials and their PV performances lags behind that of symmetric SMs.17 Generally, asymmetric molecules with an obvious dipole moment can change the orientation and molecular stacking, and thus affect the morphology and performance parameters of PV devices.18 In early studies, triarylamine derivatives were widely used in the molecular design of asymmetric structures due to their strong electron-donating properties and high hole mobility. For example, Roncali and Chen et al. reported a series of D–A, D–D′–A, and D–A–A′-type SM PV materials based on triarylamine units, which improved the efficiency of PV devices to 6.96% by modifying their molecular structure.19–22 Recently, Ganesh D. Sharma et al. investigated a series of SMs based on a phenothiazine core and the terminal groups 3-ethylrhodanine, malononitrile and 1,3-indandione. An efficiency of 7.25% was obtained by modifying the molecular terminal groups to adjust the molecular bandgap and absorption.23 Sun et al. reported an A–D–π–A-type asymmetric molecule and found that favourable phase separation toward efficient and more balanced charge transport was obtained by the asymmetric molecules.24 In 2017, Sharma and co-workers proposed and synthesized two asymmetric SMs, DPP7 and DPP8, in which DPP8 exhibited a broader and red-shifted absorption in film compared with its absorption in solution, indicating its effective aggregation in the solid state due to the strong intermolecular π–π interaction derived from its highly conjugated backbone.25 In addition, asymmetric small molecules based on the building blocks diketopyrrolopyrrole, porphyrins, benzothiadiazole, indenothiophene, squaraine, and triphenylamine have been reported and applied in OSCs.26–31
Based on previous studies, we concluded that the regulation of the central group and terminal unit plays an important role in the investigation of molecular structure and photoelectric properties. Thus, to further realize the design of materials with a low band gap and systematically study the relationship between structure and properties, five novel asymmetric D–A–A′-type SMs were designed and synthesized with tuned terminal groups and central core. Scheme 1 shows the molecular design strategy and chemical structures of the target compounds. TPA was chosen as the electron-donating (D) unit because of its electron-rich character and three-dimensional structure.32 The BT unit and DPP unit were selected as the central electron-withdrawing unit (A). The BT unit is widely used in the synthesis of new photovoltaic materials due to its advantages of simple synthesis, strong electron-withdrawing nature and easy purification. Furthermore, BT-based OSCs have provided PCEs of over 16%.33 As an electron-withdrawing group, the fluorine atom can effectively lower the molecular HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and introducing the fluorine atom into the BT unit can further tune its frontier molecular orbitals, crystallinity and solubility.34 Due to the poor optical absorption property of the BT unit, ethynyl functionalized thiophene was introduced into its molecular structure with the electron-withdrawing groups 3-phthalimide or 3-ethylrhodanine as the terminal moiety (A′) to improve its optical absorption, giving BT-1 and BT-2, respectively. In contrast to the BT unit, the DPP unit possesses a larger conjugation structure and strong absorption in the visible region, which is also one of the groups used for synthesizing different photovoltaic materials.35 Thus, to further improve the optical absorption, the DPP unit was used as the central unit to replace the BT unit and the electron-withdrawing groups 3-phthalimide, 3-ethylrhodanine and 1,3-indandione acted as the terminal moiety (A′), giving DPP-1, DPP-2 and DPP-3, respectively. The optoelectronic properties of the above five novel materials were investigated through theoretical calculation, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The DPP-based materials exhibited red-shifted optical absorption and lower bandgaps than the BT-based molecules. Especially, DPP-3 exhibited an absorption edge of over 850 nm in film with a narrow bandgap of 1.35 eV. The results revealed that molecular modification had a profound effect on the optoelectronic properties of the molecules. Furthermore, these small molecules were used as donors together with PC61BM as an acceptor in organic solar cells. Consequently, the DPP-1-based device exhibited the best PCE of 4.21% due to its most appropriate energy level and moderate bandgap.

Experimental and methods
Reagents and materials
Reagents were commercially purchased and used directly in the experiments unless otherwise specified. Toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were dried by distillation over sodium (Na)/benzophenone under nitrogen prior to use. All reactions were carried out under nitrogen protection unless otherwise indicated.
Measurements, calculations and characterization

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE II 400 MHz spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was performed using a MALDI Micro MX spectrometer. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption properties of the target compounds in chloroform solution and in the solid state were recorded using an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a TA Instruments-Q20 differential scanning calorimeter under a N2 atmosphere at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI 610D electrochemical workstation from CH instrument, Inc. All measurements were carried out at room temperature in 0.1 M anhydrous CH2Cl2/Bu4NBF4 solution under an N2 atmosphere, using a conventional three-electrode system employing a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode (Ag in 0.1 M AgNO3 solution of MeCN) as the reference electrode, and platinum wire electrode as the counter electrode. The ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple served as an internal standard. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD-DFT) calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 software with the Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) and polarized 6-31G(d) basis to predict the ground state geometries, energy levels, electron cloud distribution and optical absorption properties of the synthesized materials. The alkyl chains in the DPP unit, 3-phthalimide unit and 3-ethylrhodanine unit were replaced by a methyl group in the structures of the molecules to shorten the computational time.36
Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a conventional architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC61BM/Al via solution processing. The indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were sequentially cleaned in deionized water, methanol, acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min and dried in an infrared oven. Then, a thin film of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 60 s and baked at 140 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the prepared substrate was transferred to a N2 filled glove box and the photoactive layer was formed by spin-coating a blend chloroform solution of SMs:PC61BM (1:2, w/w) on the top of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate at 1500 rpm for 60 s. Finally, the aluminium (Al) electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation at a vacuum of 10−4 Pa through a shadow mask with an area of 5 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the corresponding bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 light. The corresponding incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded with an SM-25 photoelectric conversion analyzer. The hole mobility (μh) values were measured in the dark with the hole-only device ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC61BM (1:2, w:w)/Au using the Keithley 2400 source measure unit system. The corresponding μh data was derived by fitting the J–V curves to a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model on a double logarithmic scale according to the Mott-Gurney law: J = (9/8)ε0εrμh(V2/L3), where μh is the corresponding hole mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity, J is the current density and assumed to be approximately 3.0, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the corresponding active layer.21

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The designed target compounds DPP-3 and DPP-2 were synthesized via the Knoevenagel condensation of compound 7 with 3-ethylrhodanine or 1,3-indandione in yields of 94% and 46%, respectively. DPP-1 was synthesized via the Sonogashira coupling reaction of compound 8 with compound 4, in a yield of 57%. Similarly, compound S11 was reacted with compound S6 or compound S9 under Pd(PPh3)2Cl2-catalysed Sonogashira coupling reactions to afford BT-1 and BT-2 in yields of 29% and 10%, respectively. The HRMS, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the five target compounds are presented in the ESI.† The results of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement are described in Fig. S29 (ESI†), where an endothermic transition appeared in the temperature range of 185 °C to 243 °C, which is consistent with the melting point of the compounds. Additionally, the five synthesized SMs exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents because of the TPA unit and alkyl chains in their structures, which is beneficial for the fabrication of solution-processed photovoltaic devices.
Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD-DFT) calculations were performed to predict the ground-state geometries, energy levels, electron cloud distribution and optical absorption properties of the target compounds. The theoretical calculation method is described in the Experimental section and the calculation results are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1(a), all five target molecules possess a good planar backbone except for the TPA unit, which should favour forming closed π–π stacking, thus contributing to charge transport. As shown in Fig. 1(b), for the BT-based molecules, the electron densities of their HOMO are mainly located on the TPA unit, and that of their LUMO are distributed in the whole molecule backbone, promoting an effective intramolecular charge transition (ICT) from the TPA unit to the terminal units. The electron densities of the HOMO orbital for the DPP-based molecules are mainly distributed in the TPA and DPP units, and that of the LUMO orbital are distributed in the whole molecule, promoting efficient electron delocalization. In contrast, DPP-2 and DPP-3 possess a narrower bandgap than DPP-1 due to the stronger electron withdrawing property of the 3-ethylrhodanine and 1,3-indandione moiety than that of the 3-phthalimide unit, respectively. Similarly, BT-2 exhibits a narrower band gap than BT-1. Additionally, the calculation results for the optical absorption properties of the target compounds are illustrated in Fig. 1(c) and Table S1 in the ESI.† All the molecules exhibit two absorption peaks, and the absorption bands at a long wavelength are caused by the electron transition from the HOMO to LUMO. The short bands for the BT-based molecules and DPP-2 are caused by the electron transition from the HOMO to LUMO+2, while for DPP-1 and DPP-3, they are correlated with the electron transition from HOMO−2 to LUMO, and HOMO to LUMO+3, respectively. The DPP-based molecules possess a redshifted optical absorption compared to that of the BT-based molecules due to their larger conjugated structures. Moreover, DPP-3 and DPP-2 with narrow bandgaps show broader absorption profiles and larger red-shifted absorption peaks than DPP-1, which shows that the design strategy of tuning the molecular bandgap by changing the terminal electron-withdrawing group is reasonable and feasible. Although there are some differences between the theoretical calculation and experimental data, their trend is consistent. Therefore, the theoretical calculation still plays an important role in guiding the design of new materials.

Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the five target compounds in chloroform solution and in thin film are illustrated in Fig. 2 and the corresponding data is summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, BT-1 and BT-2 exhibit two strong absorption peaks in the range of 300 to 600 nm in chloroform solution. The absorption bands of these molecules in the short wavelength range are attributed to the π–π* transition, while their absorption bands in the long wavelength region are ascribed to the ICT effects between the donor unit and acceptor moiety, where the maximum absorption peak (λsolmax) is 490 nm and 500 nm for BT-1 and BT-2, respectively. BT-2 exhibited a stronger and broader optical absorption than BT-1 due to the substitution of the 3-ethylrhodanineto terminal unit. Compared to the BT-based molecules, the absorption range of the DPP-based molecules is obviously broadened, especially in the visible region, and λsolmax is redshifted to 624 nm, 678 nm and 691 nm for DPP-1, DPP-2 and DPP-3, respectively. Because of the stronger electron withdrawing capacity of the 3-ethylrhodanine and 1,3-indandione groups than the 3-phthalimide unit, red-shifted and broadened ICT peaks of DPP-2 and DPP-3 were observed. Thus, the design of narrow band gap molecules was realized successfully.

By contrast, all the molecules showed much broader absorption bands in their thin films, indicating the strong intermolecular π–π interaction in the solid state induced by their extremely outstanding planarity. The optical bandgap (Eoptg) calculated from their absorption edges in the films is 2.08 eV for BT-1, 1.97 eV for BT-2, 1.50 eV for DPP-1, 1.47 eV for DPP-2, and 1.43 eV for DPP-3. In particular, it is worth mentioning that the three types of absorption of DPP-1, DPP-2 and DPP-3 reached the near-infrared region, which really realizes the material design of narrow band gap with absorption edges over 850 nm.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the target compounds. The CV curves are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding energy levels (HOMOCV and LUMOCV) are shown in Table 1. The HOMOCV and LUMOCV energy levels of the five compounds were calculated from the onset of their oxidation (Eox) potentials and reduction (Ered) potentials according to the following empirical formulas:39 LUMOCV/HOMOCV= −[Ered/ox − Eferrocene1/2 + 4.8] eV and ECVg = LUMOCV − HOMOCV, where Eferrocene1/2 = 0.05 eV versus Ag/Ag+. The schematic energy level diagram of the five components, together with that of P3HT and PC61BM is shown in Fig. 4. Accordingly, the HOMOCV/LUMOCV energy levels were estimated to be −5.41/−3.48 eV for BT-1, −5.43/−3.59 eV for BT-2, −5.27/−3.55 eV for DPP-1, −5.25/−3.80 eV for DPP-2 and −5.25/−3.90 eV for DPP-3. The DPP-based molecules show a relatively higher HOMO energy level than the BT-based molecules due to their larger conjugate structures, thus reducing the bandgap, which is consistent with the theoretical calculations. DPP-2 and DPP-3 showed a deeper lying LUMO level than DPP-1 due to the stronger electron withdrawing effect of the 3-ethylrhodanine and 1,3-indandione units, respectively. Similarly, the BT-based molecules showed the same trend. Notably, DPP-3 possessed the lowest ECVg (1.35 eV) among these compounds. As shown in Fig. 4, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the five compounds, which are much higher than that of PC61BM by over 0.3 eV, fit well with that of PC61BM, providing a sufficient driving force for the exciton dissociation of the D–A interface.40,41 Moreover, Gibbs energy of charge separation (ΔGSC)42–44 is presented in Table S2 and Fig. S26 of the ESI† to explain the driving force of exciton separation at the D–A interface, and the results illustrate that the five target compounds exhibit potential as donor materials for the fabrication of solution-processed PV devices.

Photovoltaic properties
To preliminarily investigate the PV performance of the five target compounds, solution-processed BHJ devices were fabricated with a conventional architecture consisting of ITO glass/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC61BM/Al. The PV parameters of the devices based on the small molecule donors with PC61BM as the acceptor are summarized in Table 2 and the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under illumination of AM 1.5G and in the dark for the device based on SM/PC61BM active layers are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S27 (ESI†), respectively. As is known, the Voc is mainly related to the HOMO level of the donor material and the LUMO level of the acceptor material,45 thus the BT-2-based device showed a higher Voc of 1.03 V than the other compounds due to its deeper HOMO level. Among the novel materials, the DPP-1-based device showed the best PCE of 4.21% with the highest short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.31 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.88 V and FF of 0.51. The DPP-2-based device gave a PCE of 1.96% with a Jsc of 5.14 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.80 V and FF of 0.48; and the DPP-3-based device a PCE of 1.59% with a Jsc of 5.28 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.78 V and FF of 0.38. Compared with the BT-based devices, the DPP-based devices exhibited relatively higher Jsc and FF values, which is mainly ascribed to their excellent optical absorption properties. The device based on DPP-1 showed a higher PCE than DPP-2 and DPP-3 due to its relatively high Jsc and Voc. Significantly, the energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − e Voc) of DPP-1:PC61BM is 0.62 eV, which is lower than that of the other SM-based devices (1.16–0.65 eV), which may be ascribed to the better micro phase separation and less charge recombination in the DPP-1:PC61BM blend film.46,47 From the perspective of energy matching, these compounds have potential to be acceptor materials, matching with P3HT. Consequently, the BT-based compounds exhibited D–A bifunctional properties, while the DPP-based compounds as acceptors have no signal response. When blended with P3HT, the devices based on BT-1 and BT-2 showed a PCE of 0.39% and 0.52% respectively, and the photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table S3 and Fig. S28 (ESI†). Although the PCE is still low, the bifunctional properties of these materials, which can be used as both donor and acceptors, should be investigated.

J–V curves of the PV devices based on SM:PC61BM active layers. 
The hole mobility value (μh) is generally considered one of the most important reference data in PV material design. Thus, to investigate the μh of these new materials, the J–V characteristics of the hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC61BM/Au were tested in the dark, and the μh data is summarized in Fig. 6 and Table 2. It has been reported that the hole mobility properties of PV materials is closely related to their molecular structure and their inter-molecular interactions.48–50 As shown in Table 2, the μh values of the DPP-based device are greater than that of the BT-based devices, which contributed to their increased Jsc and PCE. Especially, DPP-1 showed the highest μh value of 7.16 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 among them. This result indicates that DPP-1 with 3-phthalimide as the terminal unit possesses a very beneficial chemical structure and increased inter-molecular interaction, which may help to enhance the charge transfer efficiency, thus generating its best Jsc and PCE. The IPCE curves of the devices based on the SM:PC61BM active layer are shown in Fig. 7. The BT-based devices exhibited a similar photocurrent response in the range of 300–650 nm. The Jsc values from the IPCE curves of BT-1 and BT-2 are 2.86, 2.08 mA cm−2, respectively. The DPP-based devices exhibited a photocurrent response in the broad range of 300–800 nm, which shows a consistent tendency with their Jsc values. Also, DPP-1 exhibited the strongest photocurrent response among the molecules in the range of 300–800 nm, which matches well with its highest Jsc value and PCE value. The Jsc values from the IPCE curves of DPP-1, DPP-2, and DPP-3 are 8.82, 4.88, 4.66 mA cm−2, respectively, and this trend is consistent with J–V test results. Moreover, the performance of the photovoltaic devices was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the relevant results are summarized in Fig. S30 (ESI†). It was found that the DPP-1-based device showed a better networked interpenetration structure than the other molecules, and thus the best PCE was obtained. Based on the above discussion, these new materials are promising PV materials. Therefore, further device optimization research is still needed in the laboratory.

Conclusions
In this work, five novel asymmetric D–A–A′-type SMs consisting of a TPA-DPP/BT conjugated backbone and different terminal groups were designed and synthesized successfully, and the structural modification effect on their optoelectronic properties was investigated in detail. The DPP-based SMs showed lower bandgaps (1.72–1.35 eV) than their BT-based counterparts (1.93–1.84 eV) on account of their large planar conjugated structures, suggesting that the bandgap and the absorption properties of the compounds can be tuned effectively through structural modification. It is worth mentioning that the absorptions of the DPP-based compounds reached the near-infrared region, which really realizes the material design of a narrow band gap with band edges over 850 nm. Accordingly, the BT-2-based device showed the highest Voc of 1.03 V due to its deeper HOMO level. Besides being a donor material, the BT-based molecules also showed potential as acceptor materials. Among the DPP-based compounds, DPP-1 showed the best PCE of 4.21% with the highest Jsc of 9.31 mA cm−2, which indicates DPP-1 with 3-phthalimide as its terminal unit possesses a beneficial chemical structure and increased inter-molecular interaction, thus generating its best JSC and PCE. This work enriches the information on D–A–A′-type PV materials and provides important references for the design of asymmetric photovoltaic materials.
