    , Accepted 30th April 2019First published on 1st May 2019AbstractLead-free, water-resistant photovoltaic absorbers are of significant interest for use in environment-friendly and water-stable thin film solar cells. However, there are no reports on the water-resistance characteristics of such photoactive materials. Here, we demonstrate that silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS2) nanocrystal solids exhibit inherent water resistance and can be employed as effective photovoltaic absorbers in all-solid-state thin film solar cells that show outstanding air and moisture stabilities under ambient conditions. The results of X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses show that there is no change in the chemical composition and crystal structure of the AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids after a water treatment. Based on these results, AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells are fabricated. These devices also do not show any drop in performance after a water treatment, confirming that the AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids are indeed highly water-resistant. In contrast, lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells show significant decrease in performance after a similar water treatment. Using XPS analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we confirm that the iodine removal and the surface hydroxylation of the water-treated PbS CQD solids are the primary reasons for the observed decrease in the device performance of the CQD solar cells.
Introduction
Lead-chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) and lead-halide perovskites are considered promising materials for next-generation thin film solar cells because of their solution-processability, ease of bandgap tunability, and broad absorption in the visible to near-infrared region.1–8 Owing to the significant progress in synthetic routes, surface passivation, morphological controls, and device architectures, the certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of CQD and perovskite solar cells have increased to 12.01% and 23.30%, respectively.9,10 However, there remains the problem of the toxicity of lead-based CQDs and perovskites, given the presence of elemental Pb in them.11,12 Lead-halide perovskites, which are ionic in nature, degrade readily in the presence of moisture under ambient conditions13,14 and, in particular, become fully ionized in polar media such as water, resulting in significant environmental challenges. Therefore, Pb-free and water-stable photoactive materials have attracted much attention recently to overcome the above-mentioned issues.15–19
Lead sulfide (PbS) CQDs, the best performing and hence the most promising colloidal nanomaterials for solar cells, have a rock-salt crystal structure, which is dominated by the crystal growth of PbS clusters via the Pb–S covalent bond.20 Because of their inherent covalent-bonding-based structure, they are expected to prevent the ionization of Pb element in water and provide the enhanced water-resistance compared to lead-halide perovskites. However, the presence of toxic Pb remains a problem, making PbS CQDs unsuited for use as the photoactive absorber in water-stable thin film solar cells, as there exists the possibility of Pb ions remaining after ionization.21 Although other CQDs, including those of tin-doped indium phosphide (Sn:InP) and copper indium sulfide (CuInS2), have been considered as nontoxic alternatives to PbS, these have primarily been exploited for use as photoactive materials in liquid-state and QD-sensitized solar cells, which show poor device stability.22,23
Recently, environment-friendly silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS2) nanocrystals have been synthesized successfully using oleic acid (OA) ligands via a hot-injection method. Further, it has been reported that these nanocrystals are highly dispersible in organic solvents and show high crystallinity.24 Solid-state ligand exchange via a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach was used to replace the original insulating ligands (i.e., OA ligands) of the as-synthesized AgBiS2 nanocrystals with iodide-containing species; this facilitated charge transport in the final AgBiS2 thin films. These films were first used as the photovoltaic absorbers in solid-state solar cells with a depleted heterojunction device architecture; the resulting devices showed high performance, exhibiting a certified PCE of 6.31% as well as high device stability.
In addition, it was reported that AgBiS2 solar cells remain stable for at least 10 days under ambient conditions, with the improvement of photovoltaic performance as a function of the aging time.24 This phenomenon could be attributed to the changes induced in the electrical properties of the AgBiS2 nanocrystals upon oxygen doping and/or the addition of moisture. Considering this fact, we sought to exploit AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids as Pb-free, water-resistant photoactive materials in thin film solar cells.
Herein, we demonstrate that AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids are suitable for use as a water-resistant photovoltaic absorber in all-solid-state thin film solar cells with excellent stability of device performance under ambient conditions. The AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids were fabricated via a solid-state ligand exchange process using tetramethylammonium iodide (TMAI) and remained highly stable without undergoing any changes in their chemical composition and crystallinity after a water treatment. This allowed for the fabrication of the water-resistant thin film solar cells based on the AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids exhibiting a PCE of 5.71% (after the water treatment), which was the same as that of the control device (5.75%) before the water treatment. In addition, PbS CQD solids were prepared using the same ligand exchange process for comparison; however, we confirmed that these simultaneously show the desorption of the iodine and the adsorption of water molecules after the water treatment. As a result, the photovoltaic devices based on water-treated PbS CQD solids showed a decrease of 31.7% in their PCE as compared to that of the control (untreated) device.
Results and discussion
The AgBiS2 colloidal nanocrystals were synthesized using the method reported by Konstantatos et al. (see Experimental section).24 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images indicate that AgBiS2 nanocrystals with an average size of 4.3 nm have a lattice parameter of 0.28 nm, corresponding to the (200) planes of rock-salt structure (Fig. 1a). We also confirmed, through powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, that the as-synthesized AgBiS2 nanocrystals exhibit the diffraction patterns corresponding to the previously reported AgBiS2 rock-salt structure (Fig. 1b).24

Fig. 1c is a schematic illustration showing the process for fabricating AgBiS2 nanocrystal thin films via solid-state ligand exchange based on the layer-by-layer (LbL) method and the water treatment. We prepared the sample with configuration of glass substrate/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/AgBiS2 nanocrystals, which is same structure for device fabrication. AgBiS2 nanocrystals dispersed in an organic solvent such as toluene were spin-coated onto a sol–gel-derived ZnO layer, which was used as the electron-transporting layer (ETL); a treatment with TMAI was performed to enhance charge transport in the AgBiS2 nanocrystal thin films. This process was repeated until the film thickness was of the desired level, that is, approximately 40 nm, as confirmed by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (see ESI Fig. S1†); this thickness resulted in the best device performance. The resulting AgBiS2 thin films were dipped in deionized (DI) water for 2 min; no difference in the film morphology could be observed after the water treatment by the naked eye (Fig. 1b).
In order to investigate the changes in the binding energy and chemical composition of the TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids after the water treatment, we performed the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As has been reported previously on lead chalcogenide CQDs such as PbS,25,26 the surface structure of the AgBiS2 nanocrystals was analyzed through computational studies. It has been found that the nonpolar (100) and polar (111) facets on their surfaces are terminated only by Ag or S atoms.27 Considering that Ag-termination of the AgBiS2 nanocrystal surfaces is energetically much more stable than Bi-termination, we speculate that chemical absorption process that occurred after the TMAI ligand exchange and the subsequent water treatment were predominantly related to the Ag atoms present on the crystal surfaces.

Fig. 2 shows the XPS Ag 3d, Bi 4f, and I 3d spectra of the TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids as measured before and after the water treatment. The binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV, and the peak intensities were normalized with respect to that of the Ag 3d5/2 peak at 367.6 eV. The XPS Ag 3d5/2 (367.6 eV) and Ag 3d3/2 (373.6 eV) peaks of the untreated AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids in Fig. 2a are attributable to the Ag+-including mixed species. These are expected to originate from the Ag–S bonds in the AgBiS2 bulk as well as the Ag–I and Ag–O bonds on the nanocrystal surfaces resulting from the TMAI ligand exchange process, and the remaining original ligands (i.e., OA ligands) as well as owing to ambient aging.24 To analyze the Bi 4f XPS spectra in greater detail, the Bi 4f7/2 (157.6 eV) and Bi 4f5/2 (163.0 eV) peaks of the untreated AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids in Fig. 3.

2b were deconvoluted into two components, which corresponded to Bi3+ species such as Bi–S, Bi–O, and Bi–I bonds. Considering that the Bi–S bonds exhibit lower binding energies than those of the Bi–I and Bi–O bonds,24,28,29 the Bi 4f XPS spectra indicated that the Bi–S bonds (157.6 and 163.0 eV) in the AgBiS2 bulk contribute greatly to the XPS signal of the AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids as compared to the Bi–I and Bi–O bonds (158.5 and 163.8 eV) on the nanocrystal surfaces. The XPS I 3d5/2 (618.7 eV) and I 3d3/2 (630.1 eV) peaks could be assigned to the traces of the I−-containing species of the TMAI-exchanged and untreated AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids, such as the Ag–I and Bi–I bonds. It was hard to distinguish each species because of the overlapping binding energy regions; however, on the basis of the above-mentioned Ag-terminating surface model, the Ag 3d and Bi 4f XPS spectra, we conclude that the I 3d peaks are primarily attributable to the Ag–I bonds.
The TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids were soaked in DI water for 2 min. We then performed XPS measurements to investigate the effect of the water treatment on the films. It was observed that there was no change in their Ag 3d, Bi 4f, and I 3d XPS spectra. In other words, there was no change in the positions and broadness of the peaks as compared to those of the pristine films (Fig. 2a–c). This result indicates that TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids are indeed water-resistant. In addition, we carried out XRD measurements to examine the changes induced in the crystal structure of the TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal thin films after the water treatment. We could confirm that the AgBiS2 nanocrystal thin films showed the same XRD pattern both before and after the water treatment (Fig. 2d) and that the pattern was similar to that of the AgBiS2 nanocrystals (Fig. 1b). These results further confirmed that the water treatment had no effect on the surface binding elements and crystal structure of the TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids.
For device fabrication, PTB7 was employed as the hole-transporting layer (HTL) and was spin-coated on the untreated and water-treated TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal thin films while using ZnO-coated ITO glass as the substrate. Finally, MoOx and Ag top electrodes with thicknesses of 2 and 100 nm, respectively, were deposited sequentially using a thermal evaporator (see Experimental section). Schematic illustrations of the device architecture are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

Fig. 3a presents the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solar cells before and after the water treatment. The untreated AgBiS2 device (i.e., the device before being subjected to the water treatment) exhibited an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.51 V, short-circuit current (JSC) of 17.63 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.64, and PCE of 5.75% (Table 1).

Moreover, the water-treated AgBiS2 device (i.e., the device after being subjected to the water treatment) also showed similar device performance, exhibiting a VOC of 0.51 V, JSC of 18.03 mA cm−2, FF of 0.62, and PCE of 5.71%; all these values are comparable to those of the untreated AgBiS2 device. Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra; it can be seen that the EQE spectra of the untreated and water-treated devices are similar. These agreed well with previously reported EQE spectrum.24 In addition, we confirmed that the measured JSC of each device are well-matched with the estimated JSC (19.24 and 19.48 mA cm−2 for the untreated and the water-treated solar cells, respectively) integrated from EQE spectra (Table 1). We tested 48 devices fabricated using the untreated and water-treated AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids in order to confirm the reproducibility of each device performance. Fig. 3c shows that the overall PCE values of the 48 devices fabricated using the water-treated AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids are comparable to that of the untreated devices, with the VOC, JSC, and FF values also being similar (see ESI Fig. S3†).
In order to further confirm the water resistance is whether an intrinsic property of AgBiS2 or a common phenomenon of metal chalcogenides, we employed PbS CQDs as photoactive materials and fabricated solar cells with the same configuration as that of the AgBiS2 devices for comparison. The J–V curves of the devices based on thin films of the PbS CQD solids, which had a thickness of approximately 40 nm, are shown in Fig. 4a. The solar cell with the water-treated PbS CQDs showed a decrease of 4.3% in VOC (from 0.47 to 0.45 V), 3.7% in JSC (from 17.57 to 16.92 mA cm−2), 27.0% in FF (from 0.63 to 0.46), and 31.7% in PCE (from 5.24 to 3.58%), when compared to the device with the untreated PbS CQDs (Table 2).

We also tested 48 devices and confirmed that the observed decreases in device performance were highly reproducible (Fig. 4b). Thus, it can be concluded that the water-treated PbS CQD devices showed lower device parameters as compared to those of untreated devices (see ESI Fig. S4†).
We performed XPS measurements to elucidate the reason for the observed decrease in the device performance of the TMAI-exchanged PbS CQDs solids after the water treatment. The binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV, and the peak intensities were normalized with respect to that of the Pb 4f5/2 peak at 136.1 eV (see ESI Fig. S5†). The intensities of the I 3d XPS peaks (618.2 and 629.7 eV) of the water-treated PbS CQD solids were significantly lower compared to those of the peaks of the untreated solids, indicating that the adsorbed iodine was removed from the surface of the PbS CQDs by the water treatment (Fig. 4c). The O 1s XPS spectrum could be deconvoluted into three peaks corresponding to different chemical species (Fig. 4d). The O 1s peak at 530.5 eV was assignable to the hydroxyl groups (–OH) originating from the bound Pb–OH species, while the peaks at 529.6 and 531.9 eV were attributable to the CO2 or oxygen-including species related to the Pb–O bonds, such as the remaining oleate ligands and the oxygen chemisorbed from the air or water.26,30–33As a result, the water treatment on PbS CQD solids resulted in the iodine removal and a greater degree of surface hydroxylation, with an overall increase of oxygen-included species compared to non-treated PbS CQD solids,31,34 leading to an increase in the surface trap states. These are closely related to the decrease in device performance. In case of the water-treated AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids, these also showed an overall increase of oxygen-including species, which can be assigned to Ag–O (–OH from H2O, C–O, and Ag2O) and Bi–O (Bi2O3) bonds, confirmed by the deconvolution of the O 1s XPS peaks (see ESI Fig. S6†).35–38 As confirmed in Bi 4f spectra (Fig. 2b), the surface of AgBiS2 nanocrystals is predominantly composed of silver atoms rather than bismuth. Therefore, we only considered oxygen-including species originating from Ag atoms. Although O 1s XPS peak intensity increased after water treatment, there was no observation of water-induced surface hydroxylation in water-treated AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids. However, the I 3d XPS peaks remained unchanged, with there being no decrease in the intensity of the iodine signals after the water treatment, suggesting that the iodine ligands on the AgBiS2 surface remained attached (Fig. 2c).
We also measured the relative elemental compositions with XPS. TMAI-exchanged PbS CQD solids showed that the I/Pb significantly decreased more than 30% after water treatment (see ESI Table S1†). However, the Ag/Bi and I/Bi ratios of TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids decreased less than 5% after water treatment (see ESI Table S2†). This indicates that the desorption of iodide after water treatment is dominantly occurred on the PbS CQD surfaces rather than AgBiS2 nanocrystal surfaces.
We examined the binding energies of iodine on the AgBiS2 and PbS crystal surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) calculations (see technical details in ESI†). The iodine binding energies on the AgBiS2(100), (010), and (001) surfaces of the stable rhombohedral structure at room temperature were calculated to be 0.97, 1.23, and 1.88 eV, respectively, indicating that the binding energy of iodine on all the AgBiS2 surfaces is higher than that on the PbS(001) and (111) surfaces (see Table 3 and ESI†).

The difference in the binding energies is due to the different chemical composition of each surface and difference in the magnitude of initial local distortion of the AgBiS2 surface, which facilitates the adsorption of iodine by decreasing the energy cost for additional lattice distortions (Fig. 5a, ESI Fig. S7 and Table S3†). We also evaluated the energetics of the substitution of iodine by hydroxyl groups as the next step. For the Ag-terminated AgBiS2(010) surface, the energy cost of this process is large (1.59 eV), owing to which the intensity of the iodine signals of the TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids remained unchanged after the water treatment (Fig. 2c). In the case of PbS, however, the direct substitution of iodine with hydroxyl groups is energetically unfavourable. To explain the observed experimental results, we propose the following mechanism: first, the sulphur on the PbS is substituted by oxygen, and this is followed by the substitution of iodine by hydroxyl groups. The calculation results indicated that the substitution of sulphur with oxygen in PbS(001) and (111) (i.e., PbO formation on the PbS surfaces) is energetically favourable, leading to an approximately three times decrease in the energy cost required for the substitution of iodine by hydroxyl groups (1.71 to 0.71 eV) (see Fig. 5b, Table 4, ESI Fig. S8 and Table S4†). Based on these experimental and calculation results, it can thus be concluded that the drop in the performance of the water-treated PbS CQDs was due to both the removal of the iodine ligands and a greater degree of surface hydroxylation.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids remain highly stable even after a water treatment and do not show any change in their binding energy, chemical and crystal compositions, as confirmed by XPS and XRD analyses. In addition, the surface chemistry of the AgBiS2 nanocrystals during the TMAI ligand exchange process was explained by XPS analysis. Solar cells based on the TMAI-exchanged AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids showed no change in their photovoltaic performance and the high device stability under ambient conditions even after the water treatment, further confirming the water-resistant nature of the nanocrystals. In contrast, the devices based on the TMAI-exchanged PbS CQD solids showed a significant decrease in their photovoltaic performance after the water treatment. Based on the XPS analysis, we confirmed that iodine removal and a higher degree of surface hydroxylation occur simultaneously during the water treatment of the TMAI-exchanged PbS CQDs. Considering these facts and given the environmental-friendly nature of AgBiS2, AgBiS2 nanocrystals can be considered highly promising water-resistant photoactive materials for lead-free, air-stable solar cells.
Experimental
Materials
Bismuth(III) acetate, silver acetate, lead(II) oxide, oleic acid, hexamethyldisilathiane (HMS), octadecene, tetramethylammonium iodide (TMAI), zinc acetate dihydrate, ethanolamine, 2-methoxyethanol, 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and Alfa Aesar. PTB7 was purchased from 1-material.
Synthesis of AgBiS2 and PbS colloidal nanocrystals
AgBiS2 nanocrystals were synthesized following a previously reported method.24 Briefly, bismuth(III) acetate (1 mmol), silver acetate (0.8 mmol), oleic acid (17 mmol) were dissolved under high vacuum conditions at 100 °C for overnight in order to prepare the metal-oleate precursors. HMS (1 mmol) in octadecene (5 mL) was quickly injected into the metal-oleate solutions at 100 °C, and then reaction flask was immediately cooled to room temperature. The resultant AgBiS2 nanocrystals were purified by precipitation with acetone and re-dispersed in toluene. This process was repeated 3 times in order to remove the unbound surface ligands. Finally, the precipitated AgBiS2 nanocrystals were dispersed in anhydrous toluene with the concentration of 20 mg mL−1. PbS colloidal nanocrystals (i.e., quantum dots) were synthesized using a previously reported method.39
Characterizations
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were measured using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN TMP. Powder and Film X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected with a Rigaku Model SmartLab. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained using a HITACHI SU8230. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250XiW. The XPS spectra were calibrated based on the C 1s peak at a binding energy of 284.5 eV. Each curve was deconvoluted by Gaussian curve fitting.
Device fabrications
For cleaning the patterned ITO substrates, these were sequentially sonicated in deionized water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol for 15 min. For the preparation of sol–gel ZnO, zinc acetate dihydrate (0.5 g) was dissolved in the mixed solution of ethanolamine (142 μL) and 2-methoxyethanol (5 mL), and stirred at 60 °C for 12 hours in order to obtain a clear precursor solution. The resultant solution was dropped onto the patterned ITO substrates, and spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then thermally-annealed at 200 °C for 30 min under ambient conditions. This process was repeated 2 times for the desired thickness of ZnO thin films. AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids were fabricated via solid-state ligand exchange process using layer-by-layer methods. AgBiS2 nanocrystals in toluene (20 mg mL−1) were spin-coated onto the ZnO-coated ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 10 s, and then treated with TMAI in methanol (1 mg mL−1) for 20 s and rinsed with methanol 2 times. This process was repeated 3 times in order to obtain the optimal thickness, leading to high device performance in solar cells. The resultant AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids were thermally-annealed at 100 °C under ambient conditions for 10 min. For water treatment, as-prepared AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids were soaked into third distilled water in order to avoid adsorbing other ion on the nanocrystals, excepting hydroxyl ions. AgBiS2 nanocrystal solids with and without water treatment were stored under ambient and dark conditions for overnight. These were transferred into N2-filled glove box, and then PTB7 in DCB (5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, MoOx (2 nm) and Ag (120 nm) were sequentially evaporated using a shadow mask.

Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter and an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM1.5G) solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) with an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The measured area of solar cell device is 0.096 cm2. The illumination intensity was calibrated with a silicon reference cell (VLSI standards, Oriel P/N 91150 V). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a power source (Abet Technologies 150 W Xenon lamp, 13014) with a monochromator (DongWoo Optron, MonoRa500i) and a CompactStat (Ivium Technologies; Eindhoven, The Netherlands).
