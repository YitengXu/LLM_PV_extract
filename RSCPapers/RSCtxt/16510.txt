    , Accepted 29th June 2020First published on 30th June 2020AbstractWe present a new, rapid method to photocatalytically reduce the highly toxic Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by a graphene oxide (GO) photocatalyst utilizing renewable sunlight or visible light. We found that GO can photoreduce Cr(VI) (0.32 mM) with 35.8 ± 4.8% conversion in 120 min of solar irradiation and that oxalate significantly accelerates this reaction (85.6 ± 5.4% in 30 min). The photocatalytic reactivity of GO is comparable with or superior to that of P25 TiO2 under sunlight or visible light irradiation and is among the best in existing photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction systems involving carbon-based nanomaterials. In contrast, the photoreduction of Cr(VI) using reduced GO greatly declines with 8.5 ± 1.4% conversion in 30 min. The efficacy of low-molecular-weight (LMW) chemicals follows the order: oxalate > EDTA > formate ≈ acetate ≈ methanol ≈ no addition. The measured molar ratio of oxalate consumed by reduced Cr(VI) is 1.6 ± 0.26, consistent with oxalate as an electron donor. The UV-visible absorbance spectrum indicates the formation of the oxalate–Cr(V) complex that could facilitate Cr(VI) photoreduction. Chromium speciation studies using the HPLC-ICP-MS method quantitatively confirmed that the increase of Cr(III) species was directly attributed to Cr(VI) photoreduction. The photocatalytic reduction by GO shows good stability in real wastewater samples and after three cycles of reaction. Our results indicate that GO is a simple and promising new photocatalyst toward Cr(VI) reduction.

Environmental significance
There exist a plethora of studies on the photocatalytic reduction of toxic Cr(VI) in aqueous solutions. This work presents a new simple method by using graphene oxide (GO) to photocatalytically reduce Cr(VI) driven by renewable sunlight or visible light. The presence of oxalate was found to significantly enhance the photoreduction of Cr(VI) by acting as an electron donor and chelating agent. The performance of GO is comparable with or superior to that of a common photocatalyst, P25 TiO2, and is among the best in existing studies involving carbon-based nanomaterials. GO exhibits good stability in real wastewater samples and after three cycles of use. This work suggests that GO is a simple and promising photocatalyst toward photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI).

Introduction
Chromium exists in the environment in two common oxidation states namely Cr(III) and Cr(VI). In contrast to Cr(III) that has a reduced mobility in the aquatic environment and can be precipitated out of water as Cr(OH)3(s) at environmentally relevant pH (neutral or alkaline),1 Cr(VI) can readily move through aquifers and contaminate groundwater and other sources of drinking water.2,3 Cr(VI) is known to be toxic to most organisms as a carcinogen and mutagen, while Cr(III) is an essential trace nutrient in our body.3 Chromium has been included in the list of priority pollutants by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).4 Cr(VI) commonly occurs in industrial wastewater from electroplating, leather tanning, steelworks, and chemical manufacturing.3 Conventional treatment methods are to chemically reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by dosing ferrous salts or sulfite under acidic conditions, followed by precipitation with an alkali. These methods generally create a great deal of solid waste in the case of using ferrous salts, or pose a threat to the environment and human health as sulfur dioxide forms when sulfite is added to acidic solutions.1
Photocatalysis via renewable solar energy is an attractive method to treat environmental pollutants, as it offers the possibility to reuse the photocatalysts with minimized chemical and energy consumption and waste generation leading to secondary contamination. To this end, a wide range of photocatalysts such as TiO2,1,5 ZnO,6 SnS2,7 metal–organic frameworks,8 and graphitic carbon nitride,9 to name a few, have been evaluated in the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). While some photocatalysts can be driven by visible light,7–9 others have utilized UV light (e.g., bare TiO2).
Graphene, being a 2-D, planar nanomaterial, has been increasingly used in photocatalysis in recent years.10 Carbon-based nanomaterials use earth-abundant carbon atoms as the feedstock in contrast to metal/metal oxide-based photocatalysts, some of which involve the use of rare earth, noble, or toxic metals.8 Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and graphene materials are often used as a co-catalyst in combination with a semiconductor photocatalyst such as TiO2 to promote electron–hole pair separation upon photoexcitation.10,11 Graphene oxide (GO) possesses an apparent bandgap owing to its functionalization with a range of oxygen-containing groups and behaves like a semiconductor.10,12 GO is increasingly explored as a standalone photocatalyst in applications such as H2 and H2O2 generation, CO2 reduction, and organic pollutant oxidation.13–17 A recent study reported that GO doped with Fe(III) can photocatalytically reduce Cr(VI) (0.04 mM) under visible light irradiation in acidic solutions. It was suggested that light drives the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) reaction in the GO–Fe(III) complex in which the resultant Fe(II) reduces Cr(VI),18 although the photocatalytic reactivity of GO alone in Cr(VI) reduction has not been evaluated previously.
A recent report has reviewed the roles of low-molecular-weight (LMW) organic acids in mediating the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) as natural processes or for remediation purposes.19 Oxalic acid is one of the most abundant LMW acids naturally-occurring in plants and the environment, and thus it may be considered as an environmentally-benign chemical.19,20 Prior research related to LMW chemical-mediated photocatalysis has shown that oxalic acid, formic acid, citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), glucose, etc. can form charge-transfer (CT) complexes with TiO2 that switch the system from a UV-driven to a visible light-driven process in Cr(VI) photoreduction.21–24 The mechanism shows that LMW chemicals act as the electron donor in the CT-mediated photoreduction of Cr(VI). This efficacy is dependent on the combination of specific LMW chemicals and TiO2 photocatalysts used and is based on the LMW chemicals' decreasing ionization potentials or their stronger association with the surfaces of specific TiO2.21,22,24 Alternatively, LMW chemicals have also been shown to complex with Cr(V), a transient intermediate of Cr(VI) reduction, and stabilize it from re-oxidation, resulting in enhanced Cr(VI) reduction efficiency.25,26
In this work, the photocatalytic activity of GO in the reduction of Cr(VI) was evaluated for the first time under sunlight and visible light irradiation. The effects of oxalate and other common LMW organic chemicals were examined. The photocatalytic activity of reduced GO (rGO) was also investigated and compared to that of GO. We studied several important reaction parameters such as pH, dissolved O2, GO and oxalate doses, real wastewater matrix effect, and GO reusability. Also, the roles of H2O2 formation and Cr speciation were investigated. The GO material before and after photocatalysis was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Materials and methods
Materials
The graphite flakes used to make GO was obtained from Alfa Aesar (43319, 10 mesh). All other chemicals were used as supplied from Sigma Aldrich or J. T. Baker. Aqueous samples were prepared with water purified by a Millipore Synergy ultrapure water system (≥18.0 MΩ).
GO and rGO synthesis
The GO material was prepared in-house using an improved Hummer's method with a slight modification.27 The procedure involved oxidation of graphite flakes with KMnO4, H2SO4 and H3PO4. The detailed procedure is presented in the ESI.† The oxidized graphite product was lyophilized. To obtain a GO stock suspension, 1.0 g of oxidized graphite sample was added to 1 L of water and exfoliated in a sonicator for 1 h. The rGO was prepared by reducing GO using ascorbic acid. The procedure is presented in the ESI.†
Irradiation studies
Simulated sunlight experiments were performed in an Atlas SunTest CPS+ solar simulator equipped with a 1.5 kW xenon arc lamp. The energy output of the lamp was set at 765 W m−2. The resulting spectrum simulates the typical clear-day, summer noon sunlight in Tainan city, Taiwan (Fig. S1†). A water-jacketed Pyrex glass reactor (7.0 cm O.D. × 9.5 cm) that was thermostated at 25 °C by a circulating water bath was used as the reaction vessel. In typical experiments, 40 mL solutions containing 0.32 mM Cr(VI) with varied amounts of GO and oxalate were used. Cr(VI) stock solutions were made by using K2Cr2O7. Concentrated 1 M NaOH or HCl solution was used to adjust the pH of the reaction solutions. Dark control experiments were carried out by wrapping the reaction vessel up with aluminum foil and irradiating it in the same manner. To investigate the dissolved O2 effect, aqueous solutions were bubbled with argon or O2 gas for 30 min before the photoreaction and the bubbling was continued during the photoreaction. The visible light reaction studies used a 400 nm light cutoff filter (UF-3, Spartech Corp.) that was placed on top of the reactor. Aliquots of samples were taken from the reactor at pre-determined time periods for chemical analyses.
Analysis
Typically, aqueous samples were passed through 0.22 μm PVDF filters to remove GO and the filtrates were collected for analyses. Cr(VI) concentrations were quantified using a spectrophotometric method involving 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (i.e., the DPC method).28 The absorbance was measured on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer with 1 cm cuvettes. H2O2 concentrations were quantified with another spectrophotometric method involving cupric ion and 2,9-dimethyl-l,10-phenanthroline (i.e., the DMP method).29
The oxalate concentration was quantified by using an ion chromatograph (IC) (DIONEX, ICS-1100) equipped with a Dionex IonPac™ AS22 column (4 × 250 mm) and Dionex AERS 500 (4 mm) suppressor. The mobile phase was 4.5 mM Na2CO3 and 1.4 mM NaHCO3 flowing at 1.2 mL min−1.
The transformation of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) upon photoreduction was evaluated by a HPLC-ICP-MS method that directly quantifies the formation of Cr(III).30 The HPLC-ICP-MS system comprised an ion exchange column (Hamilton PRP-X100, 4.1 × 250 mm, 10 μm) mounted on an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC. The mobile phase was 14 mM NH4NO3 and 0.5 mM EDTA at pH = 7.0, flowing at 1.2 mL min−1. The column outlet tubing was connected to the nebulizer of the ICP-MS (NexION 350X, Perkin Elmer) that operated in the reaction mode with methane (0.7 mL min−1) as the cell gas. 52Cr was monitored.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe spectrophotometer with Mg Kα X-ray irradiation (1253.6 eV). The ejected photoelectrons were detected with a precision high energy electron analyzer operating at a constant pass-energy (44.75 eV) and the scan rate was 0.125 eV per step. XPS were processed by CASA XPS software. C–H/C–C, C–O, CO and O–CO in the C1s XPS spectra were assigned with binding energies of 284.6 eV, ∼286.5 eV, ∼287.6 eV and ∼288.6 eV, respectively.13,31 Samples for XPS analysis were made by drop-casting aqueous GO samples on clean silicon wafers and dried at ambient temperature in the dark.
A Zeiss Auriga SEM accessorized with a Bruker XFlash 5010 detector was used to measure the energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) of the GO sample.
To prepare the atomic force microscopy (AFM) samples, GO suspensions were spin-coated (SP-M1-S spin coater, Power Assist Instrument Co., Taiwan) on clean, freshly cleaved mica wafers (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm). A Dimension Icon scanning probe microscope (Bruker Co., Germany) operating in tapping mode was used for imaging GO samples. We used Nanoscope Analysis software (Bruker AXC Inc.) to analyze the AFM images of GO for equivalent diameters and surface areas.
GO materials were also characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) on a Bruker TENSOR 27 spectrophotometer. Samples were prepared by mixing 1 mg of GO materials into KBr powders (0.1 g) and the mixture was pressed to form a pellet.
Results and discussion
Characterization of GO
The AFM images reveal that the mean equivalent diameter of the GO sample was 0.62 μm with a mean areal size of ∼428226 nm2 (Fig. 1). The thickness of the GO sample was measured to be ∼1.7 nm. XPS results (Fig. 1) indicate that the oxygen-to-carbon atom ratio (O:C) of the GO material was 0.51 and the functional groups included 38.7% C–C/C–H, 53.0% C–O, 5.0% CO, and 3.3% O–CO. The EDS results indicate that GO comprises 57% C, 39% O, 0.72% P, 2.05% S, and 0.51% Mn (w/w). The small amounts of P, S, and Mn can be attributed to the residues of the chemicals used in the synthesis of GO. FTIR results (Fig. S2c†) indicate various oxygen-containing functionalities that can be assigned to the vibration and deformation peaks of O–H groups at 3442 cm−1 and 1385 cm−1, the CO stretching vibration peak at 1726 cm−1, the C–O (epoxy) stretching vibration peak at 1215 cm−1, and the C–O (alkoxy) stretching peak at 1054 cm−1.32,33

The data presented in Fig. 2 indicate the broad UV-visible light absorbance band of GO within the solar spectrum (i.e., ∼280–800 nm) with a monotonic decrease in absorbance with increasing wavelength, extending to the visible light range (400–800 nm). The absorbance of visible light suggests that GO is photoactive under visible light irradiation. The band gap energy of GO was evaluated by the Tauc plot (Fig. 2) that was derived from the UV-visible absorption spectrum of GO in Fig. 2.14,15 The apparent bandgap energy of GO is approximated to be 3.5–4.4 eV by a linear extrapolation of the absorption edges. It can be observed that GO does not present a sharp absorption edge corresponding to a specific bandgap energy. This may be attributed to GO's non-crystalline nature that is made of graphene regimes of varying oxidation levels.14

After reduction, rGO becomes very dark in color (Fig. S2a†), which is typical of rGO.32,34 The absorbance over the visible light range considerably increases (Fig. S2b†) relative to that in the UV range and is almost flattened. The absorbance peak shift to 276 nm (230 nm for GO) is also evident. The FTIR results (Fig. S2c†) indicate that oxygen-containing functionalities including O–H (3442 cm−1 and 1385 cm−1), CO (1726 cm−1), and epoxy C–O (1215 cm−1) notably decrease. The Tauc plot (Fig. S2b†) indicates a strong decrease in the bandgap of rGO to 1.2–2.8 eV that is consistent with the increased GO reduction.35,36
Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by GO

Fig. 3 presents the time profile of Cr(VI) reduction photocatalyzed by GO under simulated solar irradiation. GO alone is already photoactive and can photocatalyze the reduction of Cr(VI) by 35.8 ± 4.8% in 120 min of irradiation. Dark control experiments show no loss of Cr(VI). Adding oxalate (20 mM) greatly accelerated the phototransformation rate with 85.6 ± 5.4% reduction of Cr(VI) in 30 min of irradiation. The role of oxalate as an electron donor and chelating agent and the photoreduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) will be discussed later. The corresponding dark control samples (with GO and oxalate) show only a slight loss of Cr(VI) (18.6 ± 0.7%) that may be attributed to the sorption of Cr(VI) onto GO with the presence of oxalate. The dark control experiments for GO only and oxalate only show a negligible loss of Cr(VI). It is hypothesized that oxalate changes the interaction between GO and Cr(VI), for example, by interfacing between them, thereby increasing the Cr(VI) sorption onto GO in the presence of oxalate. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Additional control experiments with oxalate alone under solar irradiation result in a slight decrease of Cr(VI) by 25.4 ± 1.5% in 120 min, indicating that oxalate is capable of photoreducing Cr(VI). Indeed, a previous study by Mytych et al. shows that Cr(VI) can be photoreduced by oxalate under light irradiation (λ > 300 nm).37 It is suggested that the outer sphere photoinduced electron transfer where oxalate acts as the electron donor results in the reduction of Cr(VI).37 Overall, these results indicate that GO can photocatalyze the reduction of Cr(VI) under solar irradiation and that the oxalate addition significantly accelerated the photoreduction kinetics by 8-fold under the conditions presented.
 Fig. 3  Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by GO under solar light irradiation in the presence or absence of oxalate. Conditions: [Cr(VI)]0 = 0.32 mM, [GO] = 200 mg L−1, [oxalate] = 20 mM, pH = 3.0. The errors indicate ± one standard deviation from triplicate experiments. 
Fig. S2d† indicates that rGO exhibits a strong decline in the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI), reducing only 8.5 ± 1.4% of the initial Cr(VI) in 30 min after accounting for the sorption of Cr(VI) in the corresponding dark control samples. The result is similar to those in previous studies where the photocatalytic O2 reduction and the phototransformation rates are strongly decreased upon GO reduction.13,34 The narrower bandgap of rGO (1.2–2.8 eV vs. 3.5–4.4 eV of GO) does not explain the decreased photoreduction of Cr(VI) based on the light absorption, as a narrowed bandgap would have the opposite effect (i.e., increased photoreactions) as a result of the enhanced absorbance of long-wavelength visible light. Given the strong reduction of this rGO sample as revealed by the FTIR spectra and strongly flattened absorbance over the visible range (Fig. S2b and c†), it is possible that the transition in the electronic structure from a semiconductor as GO to a semimetal as graphene due to the strong reduction and restoration of π conjugations for the rGO results in the loss of photocatalytic activity of a semiconductor material.38,39 Other mechanisms such as electron–hole pair recombination and band position shifts could also play a role and warrant further investigations.
Investigations of several reaction parameters including oxalate and GO doses, pH effect, and dissolved O2 levels, and a comparison study with P25 TiO2, a common photocatalyst, are presented. Fig. 4a shows that an increase in the oxalate concentration enhances the photoreduction of Cr(VI) (with [GO] = 50 mg L−1, pH = 3.0) with the pseudo first-order rate constant increasing by 24-fold from 0 mM to 30 mM oxalate. The high R2 values of the reactions fitting to the first-order kinetics range from 0.95 to 0.99. Similarly, the photoreduction rate increases with increased GO concentration (with [oxalate] = 20 mM, pH = 3.0) (Fig. 4b). A continued increase of GO concentration shows a slowed increase of photoreduction rates at higher GO doses, an observation that can be attributed to the inner filtering effect of GO (i.e., increased GO concentrations reduce light penetration) and possibly saturation of active photocatalyst surfaces.13
 Fig. 4  Photoreduction of Cr(VI) by GO under sunlight, showing the effects of (a) oxalate concentration ([GO] = 50 mg L−1, pH = 3.0) and (b) GO concentration ([oxalate] = 20 mM, pH = 3.0), and (c) pH ([GO] = 200 mg L−1, [oxalate] = 20 mM) on the photoreduction of Cr(VI), and (d) the comparison of GO versus P25 TiO2 in the photocatalytic reduction activity under sunlight or visible light (>400 nm) (with [GO] = [TiO2] = 200 mg L−1, [oxalate] = 20 mM, pH = 3.0). The errors indicate ± one standard deviation from triplicate experiments. 

Fig. 4c indicates a strong pH dependence of the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by GO with a much greater Cr(VI) photoreduction at lower pH. This pH-dependent photoreduction of Cr(VI) may be explained as follows. First, given the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups present, GO is more negatively charged at higher pH,40 and Cr(VI) exists as more negatively charged CrO42− at neutral to basic pH (pKa2 = 6.5).41 Greater electrostatic repulsion between Cr(VI) and GO at higher pH is possible. This is supported by the dark control experiments presented in Fig. 4c that show greater sorption of Cr(VI) onto GO at lower pH (18.6 ± 0.7% at pH = 3.0 versus negligible at pH = 7.0 and 11.0). The close proximity of Cr(VI) and GO at pH = 3.0 correlates with the greater photoreduction observed.
Alternatively, the favorable Cr(VI) reduction potential at low pH could play a role. The reduction half-reaction of Cr(VI) under acidic and alkaline conditions can be described in eqn (1) and (2).42,43

Based on the calculation using the Nernst equation, one pH unit increase results in a −0.138 mV change in the standard reduction potential of eqn (1). This indicates a reduction potential of 0.77 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at pH = 3. For the alkaline reaction (i.e., eqn (2)), one pH unit increase leads to a −0.098 V change of the standard reduction potential, indicating a reduction potential of 0.38 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at pH = 7. Taking into account the electropotentials of the GO material presented in Fig. 5, the overall redox potential at pH = 3 is estimated to be 1.40 V, greater than 1.25 V at pH = 7 and 1.13 V at pH = 10 (not shown), consistent with the pH dependent photoreduction trend observed (Fig. 4c).
 Fig. 5  Electropotentials of Cr(VI) photoreduction by GO at pH = 3 and 7. The conduction band (ECB) and valence band (EVB) potentials of GO are derived from our previous work.13 
Considering that O2 is a potential scavenger for photogenerated electrons, we examined the effect of dissolved O2 levels in the Cr(VI) photoreduction in air-equilibrated, argon- or O2-saturated experiments. The result (Fig. S3†) shows similar photoreduction rates of these experiments, indicating that dissolved O2 does not affect Cr(VI) photoreduction. This can be explained by the more favorable reduction of Cr(VI) (ECr(VI)/Cr(III) = 0.77 V) compared with that of O2 (EO2/H2O2 = 0.31 V) at pH = 3.0 (Fig. 5).13,42,44 The result is beneficial for real-world operation, as the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by GO can be operated under usual atmospheric conditions, and does not require the control of ubiquitous O2.

Fig. 4d presents the comparison with a common photocatalyst, P25 TiO2 in Cr(VI) photoreduction under sunlight and visible light irradiation under the same conditions (i.e., [Cr(VI)] = 0.32 mM, [oxalate] = 20 mM and pH = 3.0) as those for GO experiments. While the photoreduction rates were comparable for GO and TiO2 photocatalysts under sunlight conditions, GO exhibited a significantly greater efficiency under visible light, reducing 57.5 ± 5.8% of Cr(VI) in 30 min. TiO2 is a well-known UV photocatalyst,45 which is unreactive under visible light as observed. Given that GO absorbs UV and visible light within the solar spectrum (Fig. 2), the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by GO under sunlight and visible light can be expected. This result agrees with that of a previous study reporting that GO can efficiently photocatalyze the reduction of O2 to H2O2 under visible light.13 Clearly, the efficiency of photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction by GO was comparable with or superior to that of P25 TiO2 under the sunlight or visible light conditions examined here.
Effects of low-molecular-weight (LMW) chemicals

Fig. 6a evaluates the oxalate decay in relation to the photoreduction of Cr(VI). The oxalate concentration decreased as Cr(VI) was photoreduced. Based on the amounts of oxalate decayed and Cr(VI) photoreduced, the measured stoichiometric ratio of change in oxalate/change in Cr(VI) is 1.6 ± 0.26. The error indicates one standard deviation. Oxalate as an electron donor can provide 2 electrons per molecule due to its current-doubling effect, where oxalate is one-electron oxidized by the valence band holes, forming the CO2 product and reactive CO2˙− that subsequently transfers another electron to the conduction band of the semiconducting photocatalyst.46,47 As Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) requires 3 electrons, the theoretical stoichiometry of change in oxalate/change in Cr(VI) is 1.5, which agrees with the measured stoichiometric ratio. This indicates that oxalate is a possible electron donor for photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction by GO.
 Fig. 6  The role of low-molecular-weight (LMW) chemicals in the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI), showing (a) the relationship of oxalate decay and Cr(VI) photoreduction ([GO] = 200 mg L−1, [oxalate] = 1 mM, pH = 3.0) and (b) the comparison of various organic electron donors ([GO] = 200 mg L−1, [donors] = 20 mM, pH = 3.0). The errors indicate ± one standard deviation from triplicate experiments. 
We further evaluated several LMW chemicals commonly used in photocatalytic systems.46,48Fig. 6b indicates that oxalate is the most effective, followed by EDTA. Methanol, formate, and acetate basically have no effect on the photoreduction of Cr(VI). The results are largely consistent with our previous work in the photocatalytic O2 reduction (to H2O2) by GO, where oxalate and formate are the most effective electron donors due to their current-doubling effect.13,46,47 The lack of enhancement in Cr(VI) photoreduction for the other LMW chemicals can be attributed to the lack of the current-doubling mechanism for acetate that forms CO2 and ˙CH3 radical upon reaction,49,50 and the inefficient ˙OH-mediated electron-donating pathway in GO photocatalysis.13 The ˙OH-mediated electron transfer is important for compounds with α-hydrogen atoms such as methanol and acetate.49,51 The only exception is formate that does not accelerate Cr(VI) photoreduction, an observation that is in contrast to our previous study in which formate enhanced photocatalytic O2 reduction by GO.13
Oxalate can act as a chelating agent for many transition metals. It has been shown that oxalate complexes with Cr(V), a transient intermediate species of Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III), and stabilizes it against re-oxidation (back to Cr(VI)), thereby facilitating the sequential reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).25,52 The structure of the chelating agent plays a key role in stabilizing Cr(V) and organic chemicals with α-hydroxycarboxylate and 1,2-diol moieties have been shown to form stable Cr(V) complexes.53,54 The lack of such moieties in formate is consistent with the experiment in which formate does not accelerate Cr(VI) photoreduction (Fig. 6b). The similarity of EDTA as a chelating agent to the moieties mentioned above explains its acceleration of Cr(VI) photoreduction.
The proposed occurrence of the Cr(V)–oxalate complex in our system was examined using UV-visible absorbance spectra. Fig. S4a† shows that the absorbance at 352 nm, indicative of the oxygen-to-metal charge-transfer of chromate,26 decreases, as a new, broad absorbance band at 500–700 nm emerges and increases in intensity in the first 10 min of irradiation (see the inset). With continued photoreaction (>15 min), the absorbance band at 500–700 nm declines. The 500–700 nm absorbance band can be attributed to the intermediate Cr(V)–oxalate complex that forms and disappears as Cr(V) is further reduced. The unique absorbance band at 500–700 nm has been reported in earlier studies, where Cr(V) occurs as an intermediate species upon Cr(VI) reduction in the presence of various chelating agents including oxalate.26,53,55 In contrast, this absorbance band at 500–700 nm is missing in samples containing formate during Cr(VI) photoreduction (Fig. S4b†), an observation that demonstrates formate's inability to complex with Cr(V) and explains its lack of accelerated Cr(VI) photoreduction.
The role of H2O2 formation
Our previous work has shown that GO can efficiently photocatalyze the formation of H2O2 through O2 reduction (eqn (3)).13 H2O2 has been shown to reduce Cr(VI) in acidic aqueous solutions.52,56,57 To evaluate the role of H2O2 in Cr(VI) photoreduction, we measured the formation of H2O2 concurrent with the Cr(VI) reduction. Fig. 7 indicates negligible H2O2 formation, while Cr(VI) was significantly reduced in 30 min. After the depletion of Cr(VI), the increase of H2O2 concentration can be observed. In contrast, in the absence of Cr(VI), H2O2 was rapidly photogenerated, indicating that Cr(VI) inhibited the formation of H2O2. While this inhibition appears to be consistent with the reductive reaction of Cr(VI) by H2O2 (as shown by previous work),52,56,57 thus consuming photogenerated H2O2, a further consideration indicates that this is unlikely. For example, our earlier work indicates that dissolved O2 is a key precursor of H2O2 photogenerated by GO and that the decrease of the O2 level significantly decreases the formation of H2O2.13 Our current study (Fig. S3†) shows that dissolved O2 has a minimal effect on the photoreduction of Cr(VI), inconsistent with dissolved O2 as the key precursor of H2O2 formation that subsequently reduces Cr(VI). The inhibition of H2O2 formation may be alternatively explained by the more favorable reduction of Cr(VI) than O2 by the conduction band electrons (eCB−) as shown in Fig. 5. The reduction of Cr(VI) by the photogenerated eCB− is a possible pathway (eqn (4)). Cr(VI) may be directly reduced by eCB− or indirectly through other intermediate reactive species. O2 + 2eCB− + 2H+ → H2O2(3) HCrO4− + 3eCB− + 7H+ → Cr3+ + 4H2O(4)
 Fig. 7  Photogeneration of H2O2 in the presence or absence of Cr(VI). Conditions: [GO] = 200 mg L−1, [oxalate] = 20 mM, [Cr(VI)] = 0.32 mM, pH = 3.0, under solar irradiation. 
Speciation of Cr during photoreaction
The speciation of Cr during the photoreaction was investigated using the HPLC-ICP-MS method. Fig. S5† indicates that before the start of the photoreaction (0 min), a single peak at a retention time (RT) of 12.5 min that can be attributed to Cr(VI) was observed. After 60 min of photoreaction, two additional peaks at RTs of 2.6 min and 8.7 min occurred and they both can be attributed to Cr(III). The assignments of Cr species in the chromatogram were confirmed by comparing the RTs with those of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) standard samples (data not shown). The Cr(VI) peak decreased with the concurrent increases of the Cr(III) peaks, direct evidence indicating that Cr(VI) is indeed photoreduced to Cr(III) in our system. Calibrating the chromatograms of photoreaction samples using Cr(VI) and Cr(III) standards indicates a good recovery of total Cr mass at 102.2 ± 15.6%.
Comparison with existing studies
There exist a plethora of studies that have investigated the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). We comprehensively collected the existing studies involving carbon-based nanomaterials (e.g., rGO/GO, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)), which are summarized in Table S1.† The performance of the photocatalytic systems depends on the photocatalysts used, catalyst doses, addition of organic electron donors, and pH. Graphene-related materials are commonly used as a co-catalyst in composites with another photocatalyst or are doped with metals. Current studies predominantly used an acidic pH ≤ 3.0 that was found to be most effective in Cr(VI) reduction, consistent with our result. Our work using GO in the presence of organic electron donors is superior to existing studies collected in terms of Cr(VI) reduction rate per g L−1 of photocatalyst (i.e., mM h−1 g−1 L). The performance of GO under organic electron donor-free conditions is among the best in the current literature. The studies superior to ours used sophisticated photocatalysts involving g-C3N4 in composites with conducting polymers, noble metals, and/or metal oxide materials.58,59 This comparison suggests that GO is a simple and promising new material toward the photocatalytic reduction of toxic Cr(VI).
Tests in real wastewater samples and reusability
It is important to evaluate whether the rapid photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by GO observed in the synthetic wastewater prepared using DI water occurs in real wastewater samples. Fig. 8 indicates that the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) in two real wastewater samples largely remained with only some decline (∼25% loss compared to the DI water experiment) in one sample collected from an industrial site (i.e., WW1). This may be attributed to its more complex water matrix such as the greater conductivity (6.08 mS cm−1 compared to 3.49 mS cm−1 of WW2) that possibly resulted in some GO aggregation.
 Fig. 8  Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by GO in different water matrices including a synthetic wastewater sample prepared using DI water, a real industrial wastewater (WW1) and municipal wastewater (WW2) under solar light irradiation. The samples were dosed with [GO] = 200 mg L−1, [oxalate] = 20 mM, and pH adjusted to 3.0. The total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations and conductivity for WW1 and WW2 were 7.82 mg L−1 and 6.08 mS cm−1, and 4.19 mg L−1 and 3.49 mS cm−1, respectively. 

Fig. 9 evaluates the reusability of GO in repeated photocatalytic reactions. The result indicates that after three cycles of reaction, GO remained fairly photoreactive under visible light irradiation (reducing ∼80% of Cr(VI) in 70 min), although some decline in the photoreduction rate (decreasing from 0.0065 mM min−1 in the first cycle to 0.0035 mM min−1 in the third cycle) can be observed. We characterized the GO before and after 3 cycles of use in photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI). Fig. S6† indicates that after 3 cycles of photoreaction, the O:C ratio slightly decreased from 0.51 to 0.44 and that the C–O content decreased also by ∼5%, largely consistent with published work reporting that GO can be slightly photoreduced under light irradiation.17,34,60
 Fig. 9  The reusability of GO in repeated photocatalytic reactions under visible light irradiation. Conditions: [GO] = 200 mg L−1, [oxalate] = 20 mM, pH = 3.0. After each cycle, the GO sample was recovered by dialysis (3 kDa MWCO membrane) against DI water to clean up the residual chemical (Cr, oxalate, etc.) for reuse. 
Conclusion
GO is shown to photocatalytically reduce toxic Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under sunlight or visible light conditions. Its performance is comparable with or superior to that of P25 TiO2 and is among the best among existing studies involving carbon-based nanomaterials. The photocatalytic activity of rGO significantly declines by 10-fold likely due to its strong transition to a semimetal material. Oxalate which acts as an electron donor and chelating agent for intermediate Cr(V) strongly accelerates the photoreduction of Cr(VI). The efficacy of LMW chemicals follows the order: oxalate > EDTA > formate, acetate, and methanol. The photoreduction of Cr(VI) is most rapid at lower pH, while dissolved O2 does not affect the photoreduction. The performance of GO in real wastewater matrices and after three cycles of use in Cr(VI) photoreduction remains relatively stable. The thermodynamic evaluation (Fig. 5) and experimental results (Fig. 4c) indicate that GO is most effective in the photoreduction of Cr(VI) at lower pH, similar to other photocatalytic systems (Table S1†) and existing treatment methods.1 While using this new approach would require pH adjustment in treating pH neutral or near neutral water and wastewater to facilitate the Cr(VI) photoreduction, it is particularly suitable for acidic industrial wastewaters such as those from Cr electroplating where pH is usually acidic (e.g., ≤3.0).61–63 Our results indicate that GO is a simple and promising new photocatalyst toward toxic Cr(VI) reduction.

Environmental significance
There exist a plethora of studies on the photocatalytic reduction of toxic Cr(VI) in aqueous solutions. This work presents a new simple method by using graphene oxide (GO) to photocatalytically reduce Cr(VI) driven by renewable sunlight or visible light. The presence of oxalate was found to significantly enhance the photoreduction of Cr(VI) by acting as an electron donor and chelating agent. The performance of GO is comparable with or superior to that of a common photocatalyst, P25 TiO2, and is among the best in existing studies involving carbon-based nanomaterials. GO exhibits good stability in real wastewater samples and after three cycles of use. This work suggests that GO is a simple and promising photocatalyst toward photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI).

 	Fig. 8  Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by GO in different water matrices including a synthetic wastewater sample prepared using DI water, a real industrial wastewater (WW1) and municipal wastewater (WW2) under solar light irradiation. The samples were dosed with [GO] = 200 mg L−1, [oxalate] = 20 mM, and pH adjusted to 3.0. The total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations and conductivity for WW1 and WW2 were 7.82 mg L−1 and 6.08 mS cm−1, and 4.19 mg L−1 and 3.49 mS cm−1, respectively.
