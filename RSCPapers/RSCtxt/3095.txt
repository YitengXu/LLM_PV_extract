    , Accepted 1st September 2011First published on 5th October 2011AbstractWe fabricated a highly efficient (with a solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 5.51%), plastic-based, flexible dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The photoanode was made of a crystalline mesoporous TiO2 film using a low-temperature electrophoretic deposition (EPD) process and compression treatment. The crystalline mesoporous TiO2 film was composed of secondary mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles (MTNs, ca. 260 nm in size), synthesized by an aggregation of primary TiO2 nanocrystallites. In contrast to commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (i.e., P90, ca. 15.9 nm in size) that are widely used in DSSCs, the synthesized MTN-based film exhibited a higher surface area and porosity that increased dye adsorption, promoted effective electron transport, and enhanced light scattering, as evidenced by analysis of reflectance and absorbance spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We also optimized the compression pressure for MTN- and P90-based DSSCs in order to achieve maximum efficiency. We further systematically investigated the cause for the enhanced conversion efficiency of MTN-based DSSCs by measuring incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). IPCE results explained the increase in the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) for MTN-based DSSCs, and EIS results indicated that MTN-based DSSCs exhibited a larger diffusion coefficient (Deff), longer effective diffusion length (Ln), longer electron lifetime (τe), and lower charge transfer resistance (Rk), resulting in a higher power conversion efficiency. The MTN-based DSSC fabricated in the study showed great potential for application in plastic-based DSSCs using room temperature procedures.
Introduction
Flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are handy and convenient for transportation and can be used in complex environments. In addition, cost-effective production of flexible DSSCs can be achieved using the roll-to-roll printing process for electrode fabrication.1–4 DSSCs that use flexible, thin, and lightweight conducting plastic substrates as photoelectrodes are attracting considerable attention because of their potential use in commercial applications. In the past, fabricating TiO2 photoanodes for flexible DSSCs on indium tin oxide–polyethylene terephthalate (ITO–PET) or ITO–polyethylene naphthalate (ITO–PEN) was limited to low-temperature processes due to the thermal instability of ITO–polymer substrates at high temperatures (e.g., around 500 °C).
Historically, fabrication of TiO2 photoanodes for DSSCs included screen printing,5spray coating,6 doctor blading,7electrospinning,8spin-coating,9 chemical treatment10 and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) processes.11,12 Among these, the EPD has gained the most attention in both academic and industrial sectors because of its advantages, including a short deposition time, simple experimental process, few or no restrictions on the shape of the substrate, controllable film thickness, and no requirement for burn out of the organic binder. Most importantly, EPD can be used at low temperatures, which shows great potential for fabricating TiO2 photoanodes for “flexible” DSSCs.
Using EPD, the Miyasaka group fabricated a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode for flexible DSSCs on plastic substrates with a remarkable solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 4.1% under irradiation at 100 mW cm−2.11 Although there were mesopores from the voids among TiO2 nanoparticles with mixed crystalline phases (anatase + rutile), the lack of a porous structure in the TiO2 nanoparticles with a pure crystalline phase (i.e., only anatase) reduced the merits of the surface area and photoelectronic properties in the fabricated TiO2 photoanode. In addition, chemical treatment was used to enhance the connectivity of TiO2 nanoparticles in their report. Such treatment could cause the blocking of mesopores, resulting in low dye adsorption. Therefore, if one could create a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure in TiO2 nanoparticles with the anatase phase for EPD and could increase 3D connectivity among TiO2 nanoparticles without decreasing the surface area of the TiO2 photoanode, it would be helpful for increasing the photocurrent density and dye adsorption, leading to a new DSSC with enhanced conversion efficiency.
Compression is an effective and widely used post-treatment for increasing 3D connectivity of TiO2 particles. For example, Arakawa et al. made a plastic DSSC by applying compression to TiO2 particles with diameters of 20 and 100 nm. They further optimized conditions (i.e., pressure and time) for compression and studied the effects of the TiO2 layer thickness and surface treatment of the plastic substrate on the final conversion efficiency of the DSSCs.3
It is well known that TiO2 particles with particle sizes in the range of 150–300 nm produce a scattering effect in DSSCs, thereby increasing the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency.13–21 However, the amount of dye adsorbed onto “large” (e.g., 150–300 nm) TiO2 particles without porous structures is always less than that onto smaller TiO2 particles (e.g., 10–25 nm). In addition, the crystalline phase of each of the large TiO2 particles is mainly rutile, which is an unfavorable phase for DSSCs. Therefore, deposition of self-assembled TiO2 secondary aggregates (with particle sizes of ca. 100–500 nm) consisting of primary nanoparticles/nanocrystallites (with particle sizes of ca. 10–25 nm) is highly desired because such materials exhibit suitable particle sizes for enhanced light scattering and high specific surface area for adsorption of large quantities of dye molecules.22,23 However, hierarchical TiO2 architectures are limited to glass-based DSSCs due to the requirement for high-temperature sintering (450–550 °C) that is needed to burn out organic binders and anneal primary nanocrystallites.24
Therefore, if one could replace the high-temperature fabrication and sintering process with a low-temperature EPD and compression process, it would be a breakthrough for “plastic-based DSSCs.” Herein, we report the low-temperature fabrication of plastic-based flexible DSSCs through EPD of self-assembled MTNs followed by compression post-treatment (Scheme 1). For comparison, commercial P90 TiO2 nanoparticles (ca. 15.9 nm in size) were used as a reference. Synthesized MTN and P90 photoanodes were characterized with reflectance and absorbance ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The fabricated MTN-based DSSC exhibited a solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of up to 5.51%, which is higher than that for P90-based DSSCs (4.35%). We systematically investigated the cause of the enhanced efficiency in MTN-based DSSCs using analyses that included the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS).

Experimental
Preparation of MTN and P90 photoanodes
Typically, 2.2 ml of titanium(IV) tetraethoxide (Ti(OC2H5)4, Aldrich) was added drop by drop into 100 ml ethanol (98%, Aldrich) while vigorously stirring the solution at room temperature until a white precipitate appeared (usually around 30 min). The entire suspension was kept in a static condition at room temperature for at least 24 h. The precipitate was then collected by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 min, washed with ethanol several times, and dried in a vacuum. Precipitated MTNs (1 g) were added to 75 ml of water and heated in an autoclave at 180 °C for 12 h. This hydrothermal treatment changed the crystalline phase of MTNs from amorphous to the anatase state. After reacting overnight, the sample was washed with distilled, deionized (DI) water and dried in a vacuum.25
Crystalline MTNs and P90 (ca. 15.9 nm in diameter, Degussa) were dispersed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA, Aldrich) at a concentration of 3 g l−1 without adding any surfactant or additive. These suspensions were stirred for at least 3 h and then ultrasonicated for 20 min. After ultrasonication, the MTN or P90 suspension was put in a container for electrophoretic deposition. An FTO glass (7 Ω sq−1 TEC-7, Solaronix, Aubonne, Switzerland) was used as the anode, and the conducting plastic substrate (13 Ω sq−1, ITO–PEN film, Peccell Technologies) was used as the cathode during EPD. As shown in Scheme 2, EPD was performed in a DC electric field of 450 V cm−1 for MTNs and 200 V cm−1 for commercial P90 to simultaneously achieve similar deposition thicknesses. At a constant DC electric field and particle concentration, longer deposition times (>5 min) were used to increase the film thickness. After the EPD was completed, the residual IPA solvent on the deposited film was evaporated in air at ambient temperature. For compression post-treatment of the EPD-deposited MTN or P90 film, mechanical compression (MTS-810, Material Testing System, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) under different pressures (25–100 MPa) was applied.12

Fabrication of the MTN or P90 based DSSCs
Fabricated MTN and P90 photoanodes were immersed in a solution of 0.3 mM acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (at a volume ratio of 1:1) with N719 dye (bis-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(III), Solaronix). The MTN or P90 electrodes were coupled with platinum counter electrodes (Pt-CEs) made of ITO/PEN with Pt (Pt being sputtered for 120 s). Electrodes were separated by 25 μm thick Surlyn tape (SX1170-25, Solaronix) and sealed by heating. A solution of 0.4 M lithium iodide (LiI), 0.04 M iodine (I2), 0.4 M tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), and 0.3 M N-methylbenzimidazole (NMB) in acetonitrile (ACN) was used as the electrolyte, which was drawn into the gap between the two electrodes by capillary force. The electrolyte injection hole was previously made in the counter electrode with a drill, and the hole was sealed with hot-melt glue after electrolyte injection. The working area of the photoanode was confined by a mask (0.55 cm in diameter). In addition, an anti-reflection (AR) film (ARKTOP, Asahi Glass) supplied from Mihama Co. was attached onto the electrode.
Instrumentation and measurements
Fabricated MTN- or P90-based DSSCs were illuminated by a class A solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM 1.5 G, Peccell Technologies), and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies). Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) data for DSSCs were collected using the same solar simulator mentioned before coupled with a monochromator (Oriel 74100) to selectively filter out all but the desired wavelength. Photocurrent density (J)–photovoltage (V) characteristic curves were obtained, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were carried out with a PGSTAT 30 potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands) equipped with an FRA2 module under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 Hz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC between the ITO–Pt counter electrode and the ITO–TiO2-dye working electrode, and the corresponding AC amplitude was 10 mV. Impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model (see “Results and discussion” below). The dye molecules adsorbed onto the photoanode were desorbed by immersing the photoanode in a 0.1 M NaOH(aq) solution, and the corresponding concentration was determined using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-Vis-NIR, V670, Jasco, Japan). XRD (X'Pert, PANalytical, The Netherlands, Cu Kα radiation) patterns were measured and used to identify the crystalline phase of the fabricated MTN and P90 films. SEM (Nova NanoSEM 230, USA) and TEM (JEOL JEM-1230, Japan, 100 kV, photographed with a Gatan DualVision CCD camera) were used to observe the morphologies of MTNs and P90.
Results and discussion
Fabrication of MTN and P90 films by EPD processes
The kinetic behaviors of MTNs and P90 during EPD were studied by measuring the film thicknesses resulting from different deposition times. A low electric field of 200 V cm−1 was used for P90 while a high electric field of 450 V cm−1 was used for MTN. We chose the high electric field for MTN because of its larger particle size.
At the initial stage of deposition, a linear function for the deposited thickness and time was expected to be:26 h(t) = k′t(1)where k′ is a constant depending on different particles, and the unit is equivalent to velocity. Thus, when the particle concentration and electric field are constant, there is a linear relationship between the film thickness and deposition time during the initial EPD process as shown in Fig. 1. The difference in the slope is because the zeta potential difference at the shear boundary (i.e., double layer) of the MTNs and P90 that is leading to different electrophoretic mobilities. The faster deposition rate is due to the faster terminal velocity (Vt) of the particles in the suspension according to the following equation:27,28 (2)where ε is the dielectric constant of the liquid, ξ is the zeta potential of the particles in the solvent, δ is the viscosity of the solvent, Q is the charge of the particles, r is the radius of the particles, and E is the applied DC electric field.28 In addition, it is known that larger particles of aggregated MTNs (ca. 260 nm) have slower Vt than the small P90 (ca. 15.9 nm), leading to a lower deposition rate.29

We observed that light could be well-scattered for both of the deposited MTN and P90 films, and that the films could be easily damaged by scratching because of their poor intrinsic mechanical strength. However, adhesion of the films to the plastic substrates was so strong that the films could not be peeled off even after bending the electrodes. This great adherence could be attributed to the large packing density and capillary stress of the MTN and P90 particles.
Characterization of EPD-deposited MTN and P90 films
The surface morphologies of EPD-deposited MTN and P90 films were observed under a SEM, with corresponding images shown in Fig. 2. The top surfaces of both films showed a porous morphology (Fig. 2(a) and (b)) at a high magnification; however, it can be clearly seen that there were a lot of cracks in the P90 films (Fig. 2(d)) compared to the smooth surface of the MTN film (Fig. 2(c)) at a low magnification. The formation of cracks in EPD-deposited films is a major issue. Cracks in a ceramic film are generally formed due to rapid evaporation of the solvent, capillary forces in the film during the drying process, weak bonding strengths among TiO2 particles, and mismatches between the substrate and film upon thermal expansion. From the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 2(e) and (f), the MTN film exhibited a porous structure throughout the entire film thickness in contrast to a dense structure for the P90 film. We suggest that the porous structure of the MTN film is useful for evaporating the solvent and reducing the formation of cracks.

After EPD, the MTN and P90 films were subsequently compressed mechanically at 100 MPa, with corresponding SEM images shown in Fig. 3. The spherical morphology of MTNs in Fig. 2(a) was transformed into a plate-like morphology after mechanical compression, as shown in Fig. 3(a). In addition, there were only rare cracks on the top surfaces of the compressed MTN and P90 films (Fig. 3(c) and (d)), which are very important when the films are used as electrodes. In addition, the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 3(e) and (f) show that voids in the aggregated MTNs and P90 vanished after mechanical compression, indicating enhanced connections in MTNs and P90. More importantly, after compression treatment, MTN and P90 films were barely damaged by scratching as a result of their enhanced mechanical strengths.

Adhesion of the compressed MTN and P90 films to the plastic substrates was excellent. For example, we used an HB pencil to write words on the compressed MTN and P90 photoanodes and bent them as shown in Fig. 4(a); yet the films were completely unharmed. The results in Fig. 3 and 4 clearly demonstrate that the prepared MTN and P90 photoanodes exhibited smooth surfaces, strong adhesion to the substrates, and excellent mechanical strengths, which are important for integrating them into DSSCs.

To investigate their light-scattering and dye-adsorption abilities, the UV-Vis reflectance and absorbance spectra of compressed MTN and P90 films were examined and are shown in Fig. 4(b). Compared to the P90 film, the MTN film indeed exhibited higher reflection in the wavelengths of visible light at 450–650 nm, indicating that the MTN film had a higher light-scattering ability than the P90 film. In addition, the adsorption spectra of dye molecules adsorbed into the MTN and P90 films revealed that the former could adsorb more dye molecules. Concentrations of adsorbed dyes were calculated to be 1.38 × 10−7 and 1.03 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for MTN and P90 films, respectively. This result is reasonable because MTNs exhibited a porous structure and a higher surface area (ca. 132.7 m2 g−1) than non-porous P90 with less surface area (ca. 91.3 m2 g−1), as summarized in Table 1 and ESI†.

Photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs
To study the effects of different compression pressures on the performance of DSSCs, we used the P90 film as an example and measured the photovoltaic parameters, i.e., short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of P90-based DSSCs by applying various compression pressures on the P90 film (with the thickness fixed at ca. 11 μm). The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 2. With an increase in compression pressure, the JSC and η also increased while the VOC and FF were not significantly altered. We suggest that the enhanced JSC resulted from a higher coordination number (N) and improved inter-particle connections, which enable longer electron lifetimes and higher electron diffusion coefficients. N was calculated by the following equation:30 (3)where Pp is the porosity of the film. Film porosity would decrease when compression pressure increases, thereby increasing the coordination number (in other words, connectivity among TiO2 nanoparticles). From the viewpoint of electron transport, N = 5 implies that an electron residing on a particular particle has five possible directions to move to an adjacent particle. Using similar EPD and compression processes, Grinis et al.31 have fabricated a DSSC in which the corresponding photoanode was comprised of commercial P90 TiO2 nanoparticles. Because the P90 was deposited on FTO glass substrates, they further utilized thermal treatments to increase the efficiency of the DSSC to as high as 8.5%. We believe that our MTNs are superior to P90 and would also be applicable in DSSCs on the conducting glass substrates with an enhanced efficiency. However, the reaction conditions such as sintering temperature and deposition time in this case would need to be optimized in order to compare our MTNs with P90. The detailed investigation is in progress.

The photocurrent density (J) of solar cells is proportional to the intensity of incident light; therefore, the amount of light transmitted through the substrate is directly related to the performance of the solar cell. By placing an anti-reflecting (AR) film on the outer surface of the DSSC, the reflection of light by the outer surface of the DSSC was decreased, and a greater amount of incident light was transmitted. Therefore, the effect of an AR film on the performance of DSSCs on plastic substrates was investigated. The transmittance spectra of an ITO–PEN film and an AR film-attached ITO–PEN film are shown in Fig. 6. Results show that transmittance increased by approximately 2–3% in the range 400–800 nm for the case of the AR film-coated ITO–PEN film.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs using MTN and P90 films as photoelectrodes (the thickness of the films was ca. 11 μm) were measured under AM 1.5 G full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 7, the MTN-based DSSC exhibited higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) than the P90-based DSSC. Consequently, the MTN-based DSSC exhibited higher efficiency (i.e., 5.29%) than the P90-based DSSC (i.e., 4.35%). In addition, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of MTN- and P90-based DSSCs are shown in the inset of Fig. 7. The broad IPCE curves, covering almost the entire visible spectrum (400–700 nm), exhibited a maximum value of about 38% for the MTN-based cell and a value of 27% for the P90-based cell at 450–525 nm. Moreover, it was expected that JSC could be further increased if an AR-film was used. A conversion efficiency of 5.51% was achieved for the MTN-based DSSC with an AR-film under the same illumination. Table 3 summarizes the structural properties of MTN and P90 photocurrent density–voltage characteristics of the corresponding DSSCs.

EIS was used to study the internal resistances and charge transfer kinetics of MTN and P90 films. Fig. 8(a) shows the equivalent circuit model for our study, where Cμ stands for the chemical capacitance, RW is the electron transport resistance, and Rk represents the TiO2/electrolyte interfacial charge-transfer resistance (or the so-called recombination resistance). The ohmic serial resistance (RS) is associated with series resistance of the electrolyte and electric contacts in the DSSCs, and RITO and CITO stand for the resistance and capacitance of the ITO, respectively. Similarly, RIT and CIT are the resistance and capacitance of the interface between ITO and TiO2 films. In general, an EIS spectrum of a DSSC shows three semicircles in the measured frequency of 10 Hz to 65 kHz. The first semicircle corresponds to charge-transfer resistance (Rpt) and capacitance (Cpt) at the counter electrode. The second semicircle represents the combination of the Rk and RW. The third semicircle corresponds to the Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte. In this study, a very thin spacer was used in our DSSC device, and the electrolyte was a liquid; therefore, the Warburg (ZW) diffusion process was not obvious, leading to only two semicircles.

We used a model proposed by Bisquert32 to scrutinize the transport properties of injected electrons in the MTN and P90 films as well as their back reaction with redox species in the electrolyte. Fig. 8(b) and (c) show Nyquist and Bode plots of the MTN- and P90-based DSSCs. The characteristic parameters of the corresponding MTN and P90 DSSCs obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots with the model are listed in Table 3. Some parameters could be estimated from the following equations:33,34 (4) (5) (6) (7)where L is the film thickness, Ln is the diffusion length of the electrons, τe is the electron lifetimes, fmax is the peak frequency of the second semicircle in the case of Rk ≫ RW, Deff is the effective diffusion coefficient, and the keff is an inverse relation to electron lifetimes. From the Nyquist plot in Fig. 8(b), we observed that the electron transport resistance, RW, was smaller for the MTN film compared to the P90 film. This was because the interconnection (i.e., connectivity) among primary particles was much better in MTNs (i.e., fewer grain boundaries and defects) than that in P90. However, due to the large surface area of the MTN film, the charge transfer resistance at the interface between MTNs and electrolyte (Rk) was slightly smaller than that of the P90 film. The Bode phase plots in Fig. 8(c) show that a larger Deff and longer τe and Ln were found in the MTN-based DSSC than the P90-based DSSC, indicating that electron transfer in the MTN-based DSSC was unblocked for a longer distance than in the P90-based DSSC.
Conclusion
In summary, crystalline MTNs with an average size of ca. 260 nm consisting of primary anatase nanocrystallites (ca. 12.5 nm) were successfully fabricated and further electrophoretic deposited into a film. In addition, the EPD-deposited MTN film was treated with compression and then used as an effective plastic photoelectrode for flexible DSSCs because of its large surface area for dye adsorption, sufficient light-harvesting from prolonged light scattering, and 3D connectivity. Enhanced VOC and JSC values for the MTN-based DSSCs were attributed to fewer grain boundaries and defects, less charge recombination, larger dye-adsorption, and stronger light scattering compared to the commercial TiO2 nanoparticle P90 with a crystalline size of ca. 15.9 nm. The electrochemical properties of MTN- and P90-based DSSCs were further confirmed by EIS, which indicated that the MTN-based DSSC exhibited longer electron lifetimes (τe), diffusion coefficients (Deff) and effective diffusion lengths (Ln), and smaller electron transport resistance (RW). Consequently, the plastic-based flexible DSSC with the MTN photoelectrode in the present study showed an enhanced efficiency of 5.29% and further reached to as high as 5.51% with an attached AR-film, in contrast to the P90-based DSSC exhibiting an efficiency of 4.35%.
