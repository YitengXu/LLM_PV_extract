    , Accepted 6th January 2017First published on 9th January 2017AbstractA visible-light-driven water-splitting system that involves two-step photoexcitation (Z-scheme) was constructed using rutile TiO2 nanorod doped with Ta and N (TiO2:Ta/N) as an O2 evolution photocatalyst. The Ta-doped TiO2 nanorods, prepared by a solvothermal synthesis, underwent nitridation to possess visible-light absorption under mild conditions, even at 623 K under an ammonia flow. The TiO2:Ta/N powders modified with a RuO2 cocatalyst were active under visible light up to 540 nm for water oxidation for producing O2 in the presence of reversible electron acceptors (IO3− or Fe3+), while TiO2:N exhibited negligible activity. The results of time-resolved infrared absorption spectroscopy indicated that co-doping Ta with N into TiO2 prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated free electrons, leading to high photocatalytic activity. Simultaneous H2 and O2 evolution via water splitting was achieved using a combination of RuO2-modified TiO2:Ta/N, Ru-loaded SrTiO3:Rh and an Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) and under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight.
Introduction
Recently, hydrogen gas has received attention as an environmentally friendly energy source. Photocatalytic splitting of water into H2 and O2 using semiconductor powders is a promising approach for solar production of hydrogen.1–3 To effectively utilise sunlight, visible-light photocatalysts are desirable because visible light accounts for about one-half of the energy in sunlight. A two-step photoexcitation system using two different semiconductor powders inspired by the “Z-scheme” used in photosynthesis of green plants has been developed as a rational strategy to split water into H2 and O2 utilising visible light.4,5 In the Z-scheme reaction, each photocatalyst plays a role in H2 and O2 evolution, respectively, while a redox-shuttle reagent mediates electrons between the two photocatalysts.
Mixed anion semiconductors are suitable for tuning band energy.6–8 For example, band gap engineering of metal oxides using nitridation, which makes the valence-band potential of the oxide semiconductor negative through the contribution of the N 2p orbital compared to the corresponding metal oxide, has been widely applied to prepare visible-light-responsive (oxy)nitride photocatalysts.9 Oxynitrides generally possess high activity for photocatalytic water oxidation under visible light.3 Maeda and Domen et al. have developed Ta-based (oxy)nitride compounds, such as TaON,10 Ta3N5,11 and BaTaO2N (solid solution with BaZrO3),12 as O2 evolution photocatalysts for Z-scheme water splitting, although the photocatalytic activity is not suitable for practical applications. Therefore, further development is needed.
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a well-known photocatalyst for many types of reactions.13,14 In particular, the rutile TiO2 powder possesses unique photocatalytic properties for water oxidation in the presence of an electron acceptor, e.g., IO3− or Fe3+, which is often used as the redox mediator in Z-scheme water splitting.15–18 In these cases, the corresponding reduced form of the redox mediators, e.g., I− and Fe2+ produced in the photocatalytic reactions, is a thermodynamically more favourable electron donor compared to water. This causes an undesirable backward electron transfer that decreases forward reaction rates. Despite this limitation, water oxidation activity of rutile TiO2 did not decrease significantly, even in the presence of the electron donor (I− or Fe2+) because rutile TiO2 has superior adsorption characteristics for the oxidised form of the redox mediator (IO3− and Fe3+), while the reduced form (I− and Fe2+) does not adsorb well. However, rutile TiO2 exhibits little response to visible light due to its wide band gap of 3.0 eV.
Producing a visible-light response to the TiO2 powder by doping with nitrogen atoms has been studied extensively since the report by Asahi et al.19 The N-doped TiO2 powder has been synthesised using several different procedures20–22 although its photocatalytic activity for water oxidation and reduction was very low.23,24 Even for photoelectrochemical water oxidation, few reports describing the use of N-doped TiO2 thin films as a photoanode have been published.25–27 One reason is the difficulty of balancing the introduction of nitrogen atoms with the production of defects, which are believed to accelerate recombination of electron–hole pairs. In general, an oxygen vacancy is produced when O2− in a metal oxide is replaced by N3− to maintain the overall charge balance. Additionally, reduced titanium species, e.g., Ti3+, can be generated under NH3 treatment at high temperatures, which is a typical nitridation procedure. The generation of Ti3+ should also accompany the oxygen vacancy.
The present study describes the synthesis of the nanorod-shaped rutile TiO2 powder doped with Ta and N (TiO2:Ta/N). The charge balance was maintained during introduction of the nitrogen atoms by pre-doping with Ta5+, which has a larger valence than Ti4+. The TiO2 nanorods doped with Ta5+ were synthesised using a microwave-assisted solvothermal method, which allowed for the introduction of nitrogen atoms under mild conditions. The Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting was demonstrated under visible-light irradiation as well as under simulated sunlight using TiO2:Ta/N as a water oxidation component. This is the first application of a titanium-based oxynitride for this reaction.
Results and discussion
Microwave-assisted solvothermal synthesis of tantalum-doped rutile TiO2
Mullins and co-workers reported tantalum-incorporated rutile TiO2 nanowire films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass prepared using a solvothermal method.25 According to the method by Mullins et al. with some modifications, the tantalum-doped rutile TiO2 powder was synthesised by mixing titanium(IV) isopropoxide and tantalum(V) ethoxide at various ratios in n-hexane containing HCl at 423 K in a pressure-tight microwave synthesis apparatus. The TiO2:Ta powders were obtained at various Ta/Ti mole ratios from 0 to 0.10, which were analysed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the tantalum-doped samples (TiO2:Ta) exhibited photoelectron signals of Ta 4f at 26.3 and 28.3 eV, attributed to Ta5+ binding to O2− anions in Ta2O5 (Fig. S1†). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powder obtained were assigned to rutile TiO2 (Fig. 1). Increasing the Ta/Ti ratio caused broadening of the diffraction peaks, indicating loss of the rutile TiO2 crystallinity upon introduction of Ta5+. More importantly, the peaks assigned to rutile TiO2 underwent a shift to lower 2θ angles. This is reasonable, considering that Ta5+ was introduced into the crystal lattice of rutile TiO2 because the ionic radius of Ta5+ is larger than that of Ti4+ in the six-coordination environment.28 Note that TiO2:Ta with Ta/Ti values of 0 and 0.01 showed a single rutile phase without any other signals, while a greater concentration of Ta produced anatase phase impurities (Fig. 1). These results led to the use of TiO2:Ta powders with Ta/Ti values of 0 and 0.01 for all experiments.

Synthesis of TiO2:Ta/N by nitridation of rutile TiO2:Ta
The TiO2:Ta and TiO2 samples were annealed under NH3 flow at different temperatures (623–873 K) to introduce nitrogen into the materials. Yellow to green powders were obtained, even at a low temperature of 623 K. Samples are referred to as TiO2:Ta/N(T), where T is the annealing temperature (K). Fig. 2 shows UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the TiO2:Ta and TiO2 samples before and after NH3 treatment at 723 K. Visible-light absorption at 400–550 nm was clearly increased by NH3 treatment due to nitrogen doping.26 The prepared TiO2:Ta/N samples exhibited greater visible-light absorption than TiO2:N (prepared without Ta), despite the similarity of the UV-vis absorption edges of TiO2:Ta and TiO2 at 410 nm before nitridation (Fig. S2†). This is probably due to the ability of Ta5+ to maintain the charge balance when N3− is substituted into the O2− site in the TiO2 crystal, resulting in easier introduction of nitrogen atoms. Notably, a small particle size also was a critical factor for successful nitrogen doping under such mild conditions. As seen in Fig. 3, the solvothermally synthesised TiO2 and TiO2:Ta powder had a nanorod structure with a diameter of several nanometres and a length of several tens of nanometres. The TiO2:Ta had a smaller particle size than TiO2 did, corresponding to the lower crystallinity of TiO2:Ta observed in XRD (Fig. 1). Nitridation of a commercially available rutile TiO2 powder having a particle size of several hundreds of nanometres was also attempted (Fig. S3†). However, no significant visible-light absorption occurred after nitridation at 723 K compared to TiO2:N(723) prepared by the solvothermal method, likely due to less efficient NH3 diffusion into the larger particles of the commercial product, as previously reported for TaON.29 The nitrogen content was approximately 0.1 wt% according to elemental analysis, although an accurate concentration was difficult to determine due to the detection limits. Also, we could not observe any peak derived from nitrogen in the XPS spectra.

The XRD patterns of the TiO2:Ta/N samples clearly indicated that the crystal structure of rutile TiO2 did not change during NH3 treatment (Fig. S4†). In the XPS spectra, the binding energy of Ta 4f peaks also remained unchanged by nitridation and was similar to that of Ta2O5, indicative of an oxide-like coordination environment around Ta5+ rather than that of a nitride, even after NH3 treatment (Fig. S1†). These results were supported by the photon energies in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), in which the Ta L3-edge spectrum of TiO2:Ta/N(723) was very similar to that of Ta2O5 (Fig. S5†).
Determination of band potentials
Estimating conduction and valence band positions is a conventional way to determine the potential of semiconductor photocatalysts for the reduction and oxidation of water. In this work, flat band potentials of TiO2:Ta/N, TiO2:N and TiO2:Ta were determined through impedance measurements. The plots of (capacitance)−2versus the applied potential (Mott–Schottky plots) exhibited a positive slope corresponding to n-type band bending (Fig. S6†). These Mott–Schottky plots showed that flat band potentials had a linear dependence on solution pH with a slope of ca. 60 mV/ΔpH (Fig. 4A). The flat band potentials of TiO2:Ta/N, TiO2:N and TiO2:Ta were similar, ranging from −0.1 to 0 V (vs. RHE), which is similar to the reported value for that of rutile TiO2 at 0 V (vs. RHE).30 The conduction band edge potential of n-type semiconductors has been assumed to be about 0.1–0.4 V negative (depending on their conductivity) relative to the flat band potential.31 In this study, the difference of conduction and flat band potential was standardized at 0.2 V because the conductivity was not clarified, as reported elsewhere.31 Based on this and the band gaps, the conduction band and valence band edge potentials of TiO2:Ta/N, TiO2:N and TiO2:Ta were represented as shown in Fig. 4B. The valence band potential of TiO2:Ta was negatively shifted by ca. 0.8 V, while the conduction band level remained almost unchanged by nitridation, thereby narrowing the band gap. The valence band potentials were suitable for water oxidation, even for nitrogen-doped TiO2 samples. In contrast, only a few driving forces existed from the conduction band potentials to the water reduction potential.

Photocatalytic water oxidation with IO3− and Fe3+ electron acceptors
To construct a Z-scheme water splitting system, the activity of each photocatalyst must be confirmed for individual half reactions (e.g., H2 or O2 evolution). First, the photocatalytic water oxidation activities of TiO2:Ta/N powders were examined with NaIO3 or FeCl3 (1 mM, 100 μmol) as a reversible electron acceptor. The photocatalysts were modified with 0.5 wt% of RuO2 cocatalyst using an impregnation method to produce RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N. The TEM images showed that RuO2 particles with a size of several nanometres were deposited on the surface of TiO2:Ta/N (Fig. S7†). Fig. 5 shows the time course of O2 evolution using RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773) under visible-light irradiation. The O2 was produced continuously, reaching a plateau within 10 h of beginning irradiation using both IO3− or Fe3+ as an electron acceptor. The saturation of O2 production was due to consumption of the electron acceptors according to eqn (1) and (2). 2IO3− → 3O2 + 2I−(1) 2H2O + 4Fe3+ → O2 + 4Fe2+ + 4H+(2)
 Fig. 5  Time-dependent photocatalytic O2 evolution over RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773) dispersed (50 mg) in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing NaIO3 (100 μmol) or FeCl3 (100 μmol) under visible-light irradiation. Dashed lines indicate expected amounts of O2 generated when the electron acceptors are completely consumed. 
This observation is unusual because re-oxidation of I− or Fe2+, which is accumulated during the photocatalytic reaction by reduction of the IO3− or Fe3+, is thermodynamically more favourable than water oxidation (eqn (3) and (4)). I− + 6OH− + 6h+ → IO3− + 3H2O(3) Fe2+ + h+ → Fe3+(4)
Abe et al. reported that rutile TiO2 can adsorb IO3− selectively (instead of I−), resulting in efficient water oxidation from a NaIO3 aqueous solution with consumption of IO3− under UV-light irradiation.16 Ohno et al. also reported a similar observation for Fe3+.15 These results suggest that the TiO2:Ta/N powders could utilise visible light, while retaining the unique water oxidation activity of the parent rutile TiO2 powder.
Photocatalytic water reduction was attempted using TiO2:Ta/N(773) and modification of the Pt cocatalyst (0.5 wt%), which is supposed to accelerate H2 evolution. However, the photocatalytic activity was negligible, even when methanol was employed as a reductant. This result may be reasonable because the driving force for water reduction by the conduction band electron was very low (Fig. 4).
The dependence of irradiation wavelength on O2 evolution from RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773) powders with the NaIO3 electron acceptor was confirmed. The RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773) was active for O2 evolution up to 540 nm, which corresponds to the absorption edge of the material (Fig. S8†). In contrast, the RuO2/TiO2:Ta powder without nitridation did not exhibit O2 generation, even under irradiation with λ > 420 nm, which clearly indicates that the new absorption seen upon nitrogen doping triggered visible-light activation for water oxidation.
In general, physicochemical properties (including light absorption) of photocatalyst materials affect their photocatalytic activities. In addition, the properties of (oxy)nitride materials can be controlled by changing their nitridation temperatures. Therefore, the effects of the nitridation temperature on photocatalytic activity were examined. Table 1 lists O2 evolution rates from an aqueous NaIO3 solution using RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N samples prepared at different nitridation temperatures, along with their specific surface areas determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. All samples prepared by nitridation at 623–873 K exhibited O2 evolution activity. The photocatalytic activity was increased with increasing the nitridation temperature up to 823 K, which was attributed to the enhancement of the visible-light response at high nitridation temperatures, as shown in Fig. 6. Abe et al. reported that rutile TiO2 with a small specific surface area exhibited greater O2 evolution activity from an aqueous NaIO3 solution under UV-light irradiation compared to rutile TiO2 with a larger particle size.16 Similarly, decreasing the specific surface area by nitridation at higher temperatures, in other words; improved crystallinity as indicated by the change in full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peaks of these materials, may also be a factor that enhances the O2 evolution activity (see Table 1). At temperatures above 823 K, the O2 evolution rate decreased significantly, probably due to the production of Ti3+, which was observed at wavelengths longer than 550 nm in the diffuse-reflectance spectra (Fig. 6). This suggests that the concentration of anionic vacancies in the crystal lattice was increased by nitridation at elevated temperatures, as reported previously,32 accelerating electron–hole recombination.

 Fig. 6  DRS of TiO2:Ta/N powders prepared at different nitridation temperatures. 
To summarise, visible light absorbance and the concentration of anion vacancies had opposite effects on the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N. Experimental results indicated that a nitridation temperature of 723–823 K was suitable for obtaining efficient TiO2:Ta/N samples for water oxidation.
Effects of cocatalysts and doped Ta on photocatalytic activity
Suitable cocatalysts and dopants are generally important to drive photocatalytic reactions effectively.1–5,9 To understand the effects of the RuO2 cocatalyst and doped Ta in this system, photocatalytic O2 evolution activity was examined using doped TiO2 samples with respect to RuO2 modification and Ta doping (Table 2). The TiO2:Ta/N(773) and RuO2/TiO2:N(773) powders possessed much lower photocatalytic activity compared to RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773). This result clearly demonstrates that both the RuO2 cocatalyst and Ta dopant are necessary for inducing photocatalytic O2 evolution activity.

Photoelectrochemical measurements also were obtained to investigate possible individual effects of the RuO2 cocatalyst and Ta dopant on reduction/oxidation reactions. Fig. 7 shows current–voltage curves of a series of doped TiO2 electrodes under intermittent visible-light irradiation. An electrode constructed with RuO2-modified TiO2:Ta/N(773), which possessed the greatest photocatalytic activity, generated anodic current attributed to water oxidation upon visible light irradiation because the material is an n-type semiconductor. Importantly, the RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773) electrode exhibited much greater anodic photocurrent than the bare TiO2:Ta/N(773) electrode, indicating that the loaded RuO2 functioned as the active site for water oxidation. The TiO2:N(773) electrode without Ta doping exhibited both n- and p-type responses, acting as a type of intrinsic semiconductor. Similar photocurrent response corresponding to both n- and p-type semiconducting characters has been reported for N-doped Ta2O5.33 However, the photocurrent density was very small despite the existence of RuO2 loading.

We also note that the onset potential of the anodic photocurrent was found to be approximately −0.1 V vs. RHE for the RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773) electrode after necking treatment with TiCl4 (Fig. S9†). The necking treatment has been reported to decrease the resistance between semiconductor particles on a conductive support.34 Notably, the onset potential was consistent with EFB estimated from the Mott–Schottky analysis. The post-necked electrode exhibited much larger photocurrent than the untreated one did. Further optimisation of TiO2:Ta/N as the photoanode, which is another important project for solar water splitting, is currently under way, and will be reported as part of our future studies.
To further understand the role of doped Ta, time-resolved visible to mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy (TR-IR) was conducted. Time-resolved absorption measurements have been employed to gain information about photogenerated carriers in semiconductor materials.35–41 In this experiment, TiO2:Ta/N(773) and TiO2:N(773) were irradiated with 355 nm laser pulses under vacuum, and the transient absorption spectra were recorded (Fig. 8). The transient absorption spectra in the mid-IR region (3000–1000 cm−1) were assigned to free electrons in the conduction band or shallowly-trapped electrons,37 while the absorption in the visible to near-IR region (20000–3000 cm−1) was attributed to the deeply trapped electrons and/or holes in the mid-gap.35,36 The shapes of the transient absorption spectra for these two materials were completely different. Absorption bands attributed to the deeply trapped charges (20000–3000 cm−1) were observed for TiO2:N(773) (Fig. 8A). In contrast, TiO2:Ta/N(773) generated a much lower concentration of deeply trapped charges compared to TiO2:N(773) (Fig. 8B). These results demonstrate that TiO2:N(773) possessed negligibly low photocatalytic activity because most of the photogenerated carriers were deeply trapped carriers, which are generally less reactive.35,36 Oxygen vacancies have been reported as the most probable trap states in TiO2.42 Thus, the result in Fig. 8 clearly indicates that tantalum pre-doping suppressed the production of oxygen vacancies during the nitrogen-doping process, as discussed in the Introduction section.

The decay kinetics of photogenerated free and/or shallowly trapped electrons in these materials also were examined by recording the change in transient absorption intensity at 2000 cm−1. As shown in Fig. 9, the lifetime of the free and shallowly trapped electrons was longer in TiO2:Ta/N(773) than in TiO2:N(773), which strongly suggests that the number of more-reactive electrons was increased by Ta co-doping, resulting in high photocatalytic activity of TiO2:Ta/N(773) compared to TiO2:N(773).

The modification of RuO2 cocatalysts has been reported to enhance the photocatalytic activity of the TaON powder for water oxidation as well as for the reduction of IO3−.10 Thus, the electrochemical properties of the TiO2:Ta/N electrode with and without the RuO2 cocatalyst were examined for reduction of electron acceptors (IO3− and Fe3+) in the dark. As shown in Fig. 10A, a large cathodic current due to reduction of IO3− was observed when a RuO2-modified TiO2:Ta/N(773) electrode was used in aqueous NaIO3 solution. However, a bare TiO2:Ta/N(773) electrode did not exhibit any cathodic current, even at −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 6.7), suggesting that RuO2 on TiO2:Ta/N(773) serves as an active site to reduce IO3−. When using a Fe3+ solution, the RuO2 cocatalyst caused a positive shift (ca. 200 mV) of the onset potential of the reduction reaction (Fig. 10B). These results strongly suggest that the catalytic activity of RuO2 for both water oxidation and reduction of electron acceptors is also critical for effectively driving photocatalytic O2 evolution with electron acceptors.

Application to the Z-scheme water-splitting reaction
Based on the results of the O2-evolution reaction in the presence of reversible electron acceptors (IO3− or Fe3+), RuO2-loaded TiO2:Ta/N(773) was examined as an O2 evolution photocatalyst for overall water splitting in combination with an H2 evolution component and IO3−/I− or Fe3+/Fe2+ redox-shuttle mediator. The Rh-doped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3:Rh), which was originally developed by Kudo et al.,43 was used as the H2 evolution photocatalyst. The SrTiO3:Rh was modified with a Ru cocatalyst (0.7 wt%) according to a previously reported method.44
As shown in Fig. 11A, the combination of RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773) and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh produced both H2 and O2 in an aqueous NaIO3 solution (1 mM). Simultaneous production of H2 and O2 was observed after the early stage in which an excess amount of O2 was generated, probably due to the gradual accumulation of I− by reduction of IO3−, resulting in a ratio of IO3−/I− suitable for simultaneous production of H2 and O2. In contrast, no simultaneous H2 and O2 generation occurred when the photocatalytic systems were employed without any additional component such as RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773), Ru/SrTiO3:Rh, NaIO3, or light. This strongly suggests that the overall water splitting reaction occurred according to the Z-scheme electron-transfer mechanism between two different photocatalysts mediated by the redox mediator.

The Z-scheme water splitting reaction was also performed using a Fe3+/Fe2+ redox mediator. In this case, the solution pH was adjusted at 2.4 to avoid production of a Fe(OH)3 precipitate. The photocatalytic system consisting of RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773), Ru/SrTiO3:Rh, and FeCl3 achieved nearly stoichiometric water splitting into H2 and O2 (H2/O2 = 2), as shown in Fig. 11B. The apparent quantum efficiency of the water splitting was 0.5% at 420 nm. The rate of water splitting with the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox was greater than that with the IO3−/I− redox. This difference in water splitting activity can be explained in terms of photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3:Rh for H2 evolution in the presence of electron donors. The Ru/SrTiO3:Rh photocatalytically generated H2 at 52.1 μmol h−1 in the presence of FeCl2, reaching a plateau within 2 h irradiation due to consumption of Fe2+ added (Fig. S10†). As previously reported, Ru/SrTiO3:Rh possesses suitable reactivity for the Fe2+ electron donor while suppressing the backward reaction (i.e. reduction of Fe3+ produced by oxidation of Fe2+).43,44 On the contrary, much slower H2 evolution (1.2 μmol h−1) was observed using NaI as an electron donor (Fig. S10†). The lower H2-evolution activity of SrTiO3:Rh with the I− electron donor could be a reason for the lower overall water splitting activity of the Z-scheme system in the presence of an IO3−/I− redox couple. Therefore, the Ta and N co-doped rutile TiO2 nanorods developed in this study could be used as an O2 evolution component in the Z-scheme overall water-splitting system under visible light.
Demonstrating successful water splitting under simulated sunlight irradiation is important because the ability to use sunlight energy is a goal of this study. In addition, solar energy conversion efficiency is a very reliable measure of photocatalytic activity. Thus, photocatalytic water splitting was demonstrated using RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N combined with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Under these conditions, H2 and O2 were generated at a nearly stoichiometric ratio, clearly indicating that the photocatalytic system achieved solar energy conversion into hydrogen energy (Fig. 12). The solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) was 0.021%. In contrast, solar water splitting activity was reduced significantly to 0.004% when TiO2:Ta was used instead of TiO2:Ta/N, due primarily to the lack of visible light absorption (see Fig. 2). Thus, visible light activation of the TiO2:Ta powder by mild nitridation in this study successfully enhanced solar water splitting activity. The STH for TiO2:Ta/N (0.021%) was greater than 2 times that for TaON (0.008%), which is an efficient oxynitride photocatalyst for visible-light water oxidation in the presence of a suitable electron acceptor.45

Conclusions
A rutile TiO2 powder doped with tantalum and nitrogen (TiO2:Ta/N) was used as an O2 evolution photocatalyst for the Z-scheme water splitting system. A combination of RuO2-loaded TiO2:Ta/N and Ru-loaded SrTiO3:Rh as a H2 evolution photocatalyst simultaneously produced H2 and O2 in the presence of redox shuttle mediators (IO3−/I− or Fe3+/Fe2+) under visible-light irradiation. A small particle size and pre-introduction of Ta, which were obtained through microwave-assisted solvothermal synthesis, enabled mild nitridation of the TiO2 powder. This enhanced visible-light activity for water oxidation because the mild nitridation procedure suppressed production of Ti3+ (and/or anionic vacancies) that could cause charge recombination. The TR-IR measurements indicated that co-doping of tantalum was also critical to effectively drive the photocatalytic reaction because it prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated free electrons. Among (oxy)nitrides, only Ta-based ones such as TaON have been reported as an O2 evolution photocatalyst for the Z-scheme system. The present finding that TiO2:Ta/N acted as an efficient water oxidation photocatalyst is the first example of a Ti-based oxynitride. Note that the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency was increased by more than 2-fold when using TiO2:Ta/N compared to that using TaON as a water oxidation component, despite the report of TaON as a very efficient photocatalyst for O2 evolution in the presence of an electron acceptor.45 Thus, the present work demonstrates the potential of applying (oxy)nitrides, other than Ta-based materials, with suitable preparation of the parent oxide, for Z-scheme water splitting workable under visible light.
Experimental
General procedure
UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a Jasco V-670 spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 instrument. Transmission electron microscope images were acquired using a JEOL JEM-2010F microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were obtained with a Shimadzu ESCA 3400 instrument using Mg-Kα radiation. Elemental analysis for the metal component was conducted using an Agilent 5100 VDV ICP-OES instrument. The concentration of nitrogen in the prepared materials was determined using a J-SCIENCE JM10 instrument. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was measured with a BEL Japan BELSORP-mini apparatus at the liquid N2 temperature (77 K). The SEM images were obtained using a Keyence VE-8800 instrument. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were performed at the beamline 9A of the Photon Factory (High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation, Tsukuba, Japan) under the approval of the Photon Factory Advisory Committee (Proposal No. 2014S2-006). The X-ray energy was varied using a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator and calibrated by the absorption edge energy of Ta2O5 (9881 eV). At room temperature, the XAFS spectra were collected in fluorescence mode using a 19-element Ge solid-state array detector (Canberra, USA). The data for X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were processed using Athena.
Time-resolved IR absorption measurements
Measurements were obtained using a homemade spectrometer described previously.38,39 Powders of TiO2:Ta/N and TiO2:N were applied to a CaF2 plate at a density of 1.5 mg cm−2 and placed into an IR cell for measurements. The samples were photoexcited using 355 nm UV pulses from an Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Surelite I; duration, 6 ns; power, 0.5 mJ; repetition rate, 5–0.1 Hz), and transient absorptions in the visible to mid-IR region were measured under vacuum. The time resolution of this spectrometer was limited to 1–2 μs by the bandwidth of the amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR560, 1 MHz).
Materials
Ti(OiPr)4 (>97.0%), Sr(OH)2·8H2O (>96.0%), and Rh(NO3)3 (>80.0%) from Kanto Chemicals, Ta(OEt)5 (99.98%) from Sigma-Aldrich, and RuCl3·nH2O (Ru 41.76 wt%) from Furuya Metal were used to synthesise the photocatalysts. Commercial TiO2 was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (99.0%) for nitridation experiments and from the Catalysis Society of Japan (JRC-TIO-10) for synthesis of SrTiO3:Rh. TiCl4 (>99.0%) from Wako Pure Chemical Industries was used for the necking treatment.
The Ta-doped rutile TiO2 powders were synthesised by a microwave-assisted solvothermal method. Ti(OiPr)4 (5 mL) and an appropriate volume of Ta(OEt)5 (50–500 μL) were added into n-hexane (50 mL, >96.0%) containing HCl (5 mL, 35–37%) in a pressure-tight vessel and heated at 423 K for 4 h using microwave radiation (ca. 1.2 MPa). The precipitate obtained was washed with ethanol (>99.5%) and water several times, and then dried at 343 K in an oven. To prepare the rutile TiO2 powder, the same procedure was applied without Ta(OEt)5.
Nitridation of TiO2:Ta and TiO2 powders was performed by annealing at an appropriate temperature under a NH3 flow (>99.9995%, 10 mL min−1) for 1 h in an alumina tube connected to a gas-flow controller.
The RuO2-modified samples were prepared using a previously reported impregnation method.10 The photocatalyst powder was dispersed by stirring in an aqueous RuCl3 solution, followed by evaporation of the solvent and heating at 573 K in air. The samples without RuO2 loading also were annealed at 573 K in air as a reference.
The SrTiO3:Rh was synthesised using a hydrothermal method according to a modified procedure reported previously.46,47 Sr(OH)2·8H2O (22 mmol), TiO2 (19.6 mmol, JRC-TIO-10), and Rh(NO3)3 (0.5 mmol) were mixed in water (50 mL). The mixture (0.95 g) was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 433 K for 42 h. The precipitate obtained was washed with hot water and then with room temperature water, followed by drying at 363 K in an oven. The hydrothermal product was mixed with an additional amount of Sr(OH)2·8H2O (95 mg), followed by heating at 1273 K for 10 h in air. The resulting product was washed with water and dried at 363 K. Finally, the Ru cocatalyst (0.7 wt%) was deposited by photodeposition.44 The SrTiO3:Rh (0.3 g) was dispersed in an aqueous methanol solution (100 mL, 10 vol%) containing an appropriate amount of RuCl3 and then irradiated with λ > 420 nm for 3 h to obtain Ru-loaded SrTiO3:Rh (Ru/SrTiO3:Rh). The production of SrTiO3:Rh was confirmed using XRD and UV-visible DRS (Fig. S11†).
Photocatalytic reaction
Photocatalytic water oxidation was conducted in a Pyrex top-irradiation cell connected to a glass closed gas circulation system.48 A suspension of the photocatalyst (50 mg) in an aqueous solution of NaIO3 (>99.5%) or FeCl3 (>97.0%) (1 mM, 100 mL) was evacuated several times and irradiated at 420 < λ < 800 nm with a Xe lamp (360 mW cm−2, output current: 20 A) combined with a CM-1 cold mirror and L-42 cut-off filter unless otherwise stated. The solution pH was adjusted to 2.4 using H2SO4 when the reaction was conducted in an aqueous FeCl3 solution to avoid precipitation of Fe(OH)3. The evolved gases were analyzed using a GC-TCD instrument (GL Science GC 3200). For experiments using different irradiation wavelengths, Y-48, O-54, or R-60 cut-off filters were added to the equipment and the output power was decreased to 10 A to protect the cut-off filters.
Overall water splitting was conducted in a similar manner. The RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N(773) (50 mg) and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh (25 mg) were dispersed in an aqueous NaIO3 or FeCl3 (1 mM) solution (100 mL). After removing residual air from the reaction system, irradiation (420 < λ < 800 nm) was done in the same manner. For simulated sunlight irradiation, a HAL-320 solar simulator (Asahi Spectra) was employed as the light source.
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of Z-scheme water splitting was measured using the same experimental setup, except for the addition of a band pass filter (λ = 420 nm), and was estimated as: AQE (%) = (A × R/I) × 100(5)where A, R, and I represent coefficients based on the reactions (H2 evolution, 4; O2 evolution, 8), the H2 or O2 evolution rate, and the rate of incident photons, respectively. The total number of incident photons (ca. 60.1 mW) was measured using a calibrated silicon photodiode.
Solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) was calculated according to the following equation: STH (%) = RH × ΔG0/(P × S) × 100(6)where RH, ΔG0, P, and S are the rate of hydrogen evolution (mol s−1) in Z-scheme water splitting, the standard Gibbs energy of water (237 × 103 J mol−1), the intensity of simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2), and the irradiation area (16 cm2), respectively.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
A series of N-doped TiO2 electrodes were prepared by electrophoretic deposition on a conductive glass modified with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) layer.49 During the electrophoretic deposition procedure, a pair of FTO glasses was immersed parallel to each other in dispersions of a series of N-doped TiO2 powder (50 mg) in an acetone solution (50 mL, >99.5%) containing I2 (10 mg, >99.8%) at a distance of 1.8 cm, and connected to a DC power supply (GW Instek PSW 80-13.5). A bias of 30 V was applied between the FTO glasses for 30 s, resulting in a photocatalyst-coated FTO glass. The coated area was fixed at 1.5 cm × 3.6 cm. For the experiment in Fig. S9,† necking treatment was carried out. A methanol (>99.8%) solution of TiCl4 (50 μL, 10 mM) was added dropwise on the RuO2/TiO2:Ta/N electrode five times. After drying, the electrode was heated at 723 K under NH3 flow (10 mL min−1) for 30 min.
Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted in an aqueous Na2SO4 (>99.0%) solution (0.1 M, 100 mL) using a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko HSV-110) connected to the photocatalyst-deposited FTO glass as a working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (in saturated KCl aqueous solution), and Pt wire as a counter electrode. The solution was purged with argon for 30 min. The pH of the solution was adjusted by the addition of H2SO4 (>96.0%) or NaOH (>97.0%) as needed.
Impedance measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (BAS ALS/CHI-760e). Mott–Schottky plots were recorded at a frequency of 200 Hz.
To measure photocurrent responses, intermittent visible light (420 < λ < 800 nm) was applied to the working electrode with a Xe lamp (300 W, output current: 20 A) combined with a CM-1 cold mirror and L-42 cut-off filter during linear sweep voltammetry.
