    AbstractTwo types of indenofluorene-based low bandgap conjugated polymers, poly(6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene-co-4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PIF-DBT) and poly(6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene-co-5,7-dithien-2-yl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine) (PIF-DTP), were synthesized and characterized for use in plastic solar cells. The optical, electrochemical, charge carrier mobility, morphological and photovoltaic characteristics were investigated. The number-average molecular weights of the polymers measured by gel permeation chromatography ranged from 19000 to 27000 g mol−1. The polymers were fairly soluble in common organic solvents and formed optical-quality films by spin casting. Photophysical studies revealed a low bandgap of ∼1.9 eV for PIF-DBT and ∼1.6 eV for PIF-DTP, respectively, which could harvest the broad solar spectrum covering from 300 nm to 650 nm (PIF-DBT), and from 300 nm to 800 nm (PIF-DTP) in film. An electrochemical study confirmed the desirable HOMO/LUMO levels of the copolymers, which enable efficient electron transfer and a high open circuit voltage when blending them with fullerene derivatives. The field effect mobility measurements showed a hole mobility of 10−5∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the copolymers. The film surface morphology was also studied by atomic force microscopy. Among the polyindenofluorene copolymers, PIF-DBT50 (containing 50 mol% DBT) showed the best photovoltaic performance with an open circuit voltage of 0.77 V, a short circuit current of 5.50 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency of 1.70% when the polymers were blended with PC71BM, under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) illumination conditions.
Introduction
As the growing energy crisis is being seriously recognized around the world, polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) together with silicon solar cells have gained increasing attention as a renewable and clean energy source. PSCs have several advantages compared to the silicon-based ones, such as low cost, light weight, easy fabrication by solution processing, mechanical flexibility, etc.1–3 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) composites of conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives have demonstrated promising performance: Cells combining regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) with a fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4∼5%. Extensive studies have been carried out to optimize P3HT-based solar cells, including detailed investigations on charge carrier generation, polymer molecular weights and polydispersity effects, morphology control by heat and solvent treatments, etc.4–9 Poly[2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)]-1,4-phenylenevinylene (MDMO-PPV) and its derivatives have been also studied extensively as an another electron-donor in PSC structures.10,11
However, due to the restricted light absorption from the mismatch of their bandgaps with the photon flux maximum of the solar spectrum, a bottleneck in power conversion efficiency seems to be reached. Therefore researchers have begun developing new low bandgap structures with broad and strong absorption covering a wider range of the solar radiation.12 The most popular strategy for obtaining low bandgap structures is to utilize internal charge transfer (ICT) from an electron-rich unit to an electron-poor moiety in electron rich-poor alternating copolymers. Using the ICT approaches, several interesting structures have been designed and developed, which harvest the better solar spectrum with a bandgap of 1.4∼1.9 eV. Brabec et al. reported an efficient low bandgap polymer, poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), which shows absorption covering the range of 380∼900 nm, high carrier mobility (0.01–0.1 cm2V−1s−1) and a PCE of 3.2% with PC71BM under AM 1.5G conditions.13,14 Polydialkylfluorene derivatives containing electron withdrawing moieties are also well-known photovoltaic materials showing promising features with PCE values of 2∼4.2%.15–19 Leclerc et al. synthesized remarkable alternating polycarbazole-based structures (PCDTBT) with high solubility, air stability, and PCE values of ∼3.6%.20–22 Recently there have been an increasing number of publications on the development of new PSC structures including quaterthiophene, diketo-pyrrolo-pyrrole, thiophene-phenylene-thiophene units, etc.23–25
Although there has been encouraging progress in PSCs with power conversion efficiencies of ∼5%, the limited efficiency still delays their real commercialization. By optimizing the electronic properties of the polymeric materials with improved absorption and charge carrier mobility, the substantial improvement of the PCE values might be realized. To realize the high efficiency of the devices, several parameters should be optimized: i) light-harvesting polymers should have well-matched broad and strong absorption with terrestrial solar radiation, ii) the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the donor and acceptor must be aligned to facilitate photo-induced electron transfer to generate positive and negative charge carriers, iii) high carrier mobility (>10−3 cm2 V−1 s) is necessary to ensure effective charge carrier transport to the electrodes and iv) bicontinuous donor–acceptor interpenetrating film morphology. A modeling study showed that optimized polymer solar cells can have a PCE ≥10% when blended with PCBM.26,27
A number of polyfluorenes (PFs) and their derivatives have been studied as a photoactive structure in polymer light-emitting devices and solar cells on account of their large bandgap, high photoluminescence (PL), electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies, good thermal/chemical stability, and good solubility in common organic solvents.15–19,28,29 As an another attractive alternative, polyindenofluorenes (PIFs) have a more extended coplanar fused structure, which enables enhanced π-conjugation, π–π intermolecular interactions and the improved charge carrier mobility compared to PFs. Moreover, in contrast to the fluorene unit, the indenofluorene moiety has two sites for attaching side alkyl chains. As a result, indenofluorene-based copolymers are expected to show better solubility and processability in organic solvents. Therefore, the indenofluorene moiety can be expected to function as an efficient electron-rich unit in ICT-type low bandgap copolymers for PSCs.30–37
Here we report the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of new ICT alternating polyindenofluorene-based low bandgap copolymers for polymeric solar cells: poly(6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene-co-4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PIF-DBT, mol% = 65:35, 50:50) and poly(6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene-co-5,7-dithien-2-yl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine) (PIF-DTP, mol% = 65:35, 50:50). The new copolymers combine the electron-sufficient indenofluorene (IF) unit and two different electron-deficient moieties, 4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DBT) or 5,7-dithien-2-yl-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (DTP) to lower the electronic bandgap to 1.6∼1.9 eV (Scheme 1). The polymers show broad absorption spectra covering 300∼650 nm (PIF-DBT) and 300∼800 nm (PIF-DTP) in the film. With increasing the DBT (or DTP) content in the copolymers, the long wavelength absorption was enhanced. The electrochemical, morphological and charge carrier mobility data suggest the possibility of the polymers as an efficient donor when blended with PCBM derivatives in polymer solar cells. Among the PIF polymers, PIF-DBT50 showed the best performance as an active material in PSCs. A solar cell combining PIF-DBT50 with PC61BM exhibited photovoltaic properties with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 5.26 mA cm−2 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.48%. When PIF-DBT50 was blended with PC71BM, the photovoltaic performance was improved substantially with Voc = 0.77 V, Jsc = 5.50 mA cm−2 and the resulting PCE = 1.70% under air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) illumination conditions.

Experimental
Materials and characterization
Indeno[1,2-b]fluorene, 6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene, 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 5,7-bis(5′-bromothien-2-yl)-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine were synthesized according to the previously reported procedures.32,38,39 All other chemical reagents were purchased from Aldrich Co., Junsei chemical company or TCI, and used without further purification.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL (JNM-AL300) FT NMR system operating at 300 MHz and 75 MHz, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements were made using TA Q500 and TA Q100 analyzers at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by analytical gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with Agilent GPC 1200 Series using THF as an eluent, relative to a polystyrene standard. Elemental analyses were performed by the Seoul Branch Analytical Laboratory of the Korea Basic Science Institute (Elemental analyzer; CE Instruments Flash EA 1112 series). The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Jasco (V-630) spectrophotometer. The Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured on a Potentiostat/Galvanostat model 273 electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with a nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) in acetonitrile (CH3CN). A platinum electrode (∼0.05 cm2) coated with a thin polymer film was used as a working electrode. A platinum wire and a Ag/AgNO3 electrode were used as a counter- and reference electrode, respectively. All measurements were calibrated against an internal standard of ferrocene (Fc), the ionization potential (IP) value of which is −4.8 eV for the Fc/Fc+ redox system. AFM images were obtained using a Nanoscope 3A-01 Scanning Probe Microscope System with tapping mode.
Field effect mobility measurement
To measure the field effect mobility of charge carriers, organic thin-film transistors (OTFT) were fabricated on a silicon wafer using a top contact geometry (channel length L = 50 μm, width W = 1500 μm) under nitrogen. A heavily n-doped silicon wafer was used as a substrate/gate electrode, with the top SiO2 layer (200 nm thick) serving as a gate dielectric. The SiO2 surface of the wafer substrate was cleaned with a piranha solution and the cleaned wafer was treated with octyltrichlorosilane (OTS) in toluene (0.5 vol.%) at room temperature for 2 h. The semiconductor active layer (70 nm) was spin-coated at 2500 rpm from a 0.5 wt.% polymer solution in chlorobenzene and the remaining solvent was dried at 80 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, the gold source and drain electrode pairs were thermally deposited with a 50 nm thickness by vacuum evaporation (at ∼10−7 torr) through a shadow mask. Post annealing was carried out at 120 °C for 10 min before measuring the device characteristics.
Photovoltaic device fabrication
The PSC devices were fabricated on a pre-patterned indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. The substrate was cleaned ultrasonically and sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol. A UV-ozone treatment was performed for 20 min as a final step of substrate cleaning before film casting. For measurements of the photovoltaic properties, the device configuration was ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/polymer:PCBM (80 nm)/Al (100 nm). A layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) film was spin-coated from its aqueous dispersion (Baytron P, Bayer AG) onto the ITO glass, with the aim of improving the hole transport and avoiding the possibility of current leakage. The PEDOT:PSS film was dried at 140 °C for 10 min in air. Then, the sample was moved to a glove box for spin-casting of the photoactive layer (blended mixture of polymer and PCBM). A solution of the polymer: PCBM in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was spin-cast to form an uniform film on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Finally, the Al electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a vacuum condition of ∼10−7 torr. The active area of the devices in this study was 0.145 cm2, which is defined by the cathode area. For calibration of the solar simulator, the light intensity was calibrated using the calibrated standard silicon solar cells with a protective window containing KG5 filter glass (verified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL). Electrical characterization was carried out under a N2 atmosphere using a high-quality optical fiber to guide the light from the solar simulator. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 237 source measurement unit.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The final copolymers were synthesized by carrying out the Suzuki polymerization between the electron-rich indenofluorene moiety and electron-poor 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DBT) or 5,7-bis(5′-bromothien-2-yl)-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (DTP). The molecular structures and detailed synthetic routes to the polymers are shown in Scheme 1. The indenofluorene core, DBT and DTP derivatives were synthesized by following the previously reported procedures.32,38,39 6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene was synthesized in ∼70% yield by an alkylation reaction of indenofluorene with n-BuLi and 1-bromooctane in anhydrous THF. 2,8-Dibromo-6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene (1) was obtained by bromination of 6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene with CuBr2 adsorbed on neutral alumina. Successive lithiation and boronic esterification with butyllithium and 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane gave compound 2 in ∼92% yield. The Stille coupling reaction between tributyl(2-thienyl)stannane and 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and successive bromination with N-bromosuccinimide yielded the DBT derivative. Another monomer, the DTP derivative, 5,7-bis(5′-bromothien-2-yl)-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine was obtained by bromination of 5,7-bis(thien-2-yl)-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine which was synthesized from a reaction between 2,5-bis(thien-2-yl)-3,4-diaminothiophene and ethanedial.39 The final low bandgap copolymers were synthesized by the Suzuki polymerization of 2,8-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno[1,2-b]fluorene (2) and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole for PIF-DBT50, or 5,7-bis(5′-bromothien-2-yl)-thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine for PIF-DTP50. For the polymerization of PIF-DBT35 and PIF-DTP35, another comonomer, 2,8-dibromo-6,6′,12,12′-tetraoctylindeno-[1,2-b]fluorene, was added to adjust the molar ratio between the bromo- and boronic ester functionalities. Copolymerization was carried out over 24 h under a reflux condition, using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in a mixture of toluene and an aqueous 2 M potassium carbonate solution in the presence of a phase transfer reagent, Aliquat 336. When polymerization was complete, the polymers were end-capped by adding a small amount of phenyl boronic acid and bromobenzene. The polymerization yields ranged from 64% to 80%.
The number average molecular weight (Mn) was determined to be 27300 g mol−1 (PDI = 1.89) for PIF-DBT35, 21000 g mol−1 (PDI = 1.69) for PIF-DBT50, 19100 g mol−1 (PDI = 1.84) for PIF-DTP35, and 25900 g mol−1 (PDI = 1.57) for PIF-DTP50 by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a polystyrene standard in THF. The resulting polymers are fairly soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, toluene, THF, etc. and form optical-quality films by spin-casting. The thermal properties were evaluated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. 1). All polymers exhibited good thermal stability, showing less than 5% weight loss up to ∼390 °C. Interestingly the polymers containing 50 mol% DBT (or DTP) showed slightly better thermal stability as compared to PIF-DBT35 (or PIF-DTP35). This might be due to the regioregular alternating structure of PIF-DBT50 (or PIF-DTP50), which may have better molecular ordering with enhanced intermolecular interactions and resulting thermal properties. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was measured by DSC (2nd scan) to be ∼135 °C for PIF-DTP50, after rapid cooling from 200 °C. An almost identical Tg was reported for a similarly structured polymer, PFDDTTP in previous literature.40 However, no clear phase transition was detected for the other polymers. Table 1 summarizes the physical properties of the synthesized polymers.

Optical properties

Fig. 2 shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform and in the spin-cast film. A thin film was made onto a glass substrate by spin coating with 1 wt.% polymer solution in chloroform. The absorption spectra of all polymers show two main peaks: one around 400 nm originating from the indenofluorene unit and longer wavelength absorption must be due to an internal charge transfer (ICT) interaction between the electron-rich IF moiety and electron-deficient DBT or DTP moieties. The ICT interactions in electron rich-poor alternating structures can reduce the bandgap of polymers.41 The absorption maxima were measured at 406 nm and 535 nm for PIF-DBT35, at 400 nm and 537 nm for PIF-DBT50, at 414 nm and 622 nm for PIF-DTP35 and at 428 nm and 623 nm for PIF-DTP50 in chloroform, respectively. In the film, the spectra were somewhat broad and slightly red-shifted (15∼20 nm) in the longer wavelength region, relative to those in solution. In the solid film, the absorption maxima were measured at 401 nm and 547 nm for PIF-DBT35, at 401 nm and 550 nm for PIF-DBT50, at 415 nm and 638 nm for PIF-DTP35 and at 437 nm and 645 nm for PIF-DTP50, respectively. The ICT interactions between the electron-sufficient IF unit and electron-deficient DBT or DTP units in the polymeric backbone, lower a bandgap and induce broad absorption covering 300 nm to 650∼800 nm. We also measured PL spectra of the polymers in several solvents with different polarity (toluene, THF, chloroform and DMF, ESI†). The emission is red-shifted for all the polymers, as polarity of the solvent is increased, which indicates the strong ICT interaction on the polymeric backbone.

The PIF-DTP structures show the spectra with longer wavelength absorption up to 800 nm as compared to PIF-DBT (up to ∼650 nm). According to the previous paper by Jianhui Hou et al.,42,43 the difference in the absorption wavelength can be explained in terms of the quinoid structures of the two electron-deficient DBT and DTP structures (Scheme 2). The quinoid character induces an enhanced molecular interaction and an intrinsically higher degree of coplanarity due to the rigidification of the conjugated system resulting from the increased double bond character between the neighboring rings.43 Because of the more pronounced quinoid character in the DTP structure, the PIF-DTP polymers are expected to have broader absorption up to ∼800 nm compared to PIF-DBT. In addition, the change in content of the electron-deficient DBT or DTP units in the copolymers induces a clear intensity change in the spectra. The long wavelength absorption (around 550 nm) of PIF-DBT50 is increased relative to PIF-DBT35, which is in proportional to the content of the DBT unit on the polymeric backbone. The same discussions can be applied to PIF-DTP35 and PIF-DTP50. Interestingly PIF-DTP50 shows clearly red-shifted absorption (428 nm in chloroform and 437 nm in film) compared to PIF-DTP35 (414 nm in chloroform and 415 nm in film) in the short wavelength absorption region. This can be understood in terms of the different solubility and aggregation in solution and film. PIF-DTP50 shows relatively poorer solubility (than PIF-DTP35) and partial aggregation is expected with intermolecular packing and the resulting red-shifted absorption. The optical bandgap was estimated to be 1.61∼1.97 eV for the polymers by measuring the absorption edges in the UV-vis spectra in the film (Table 2).

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the indenofluorene-based polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) which is used to determine the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of molecular structures. The electrochemical properties are very important for understanding and optimizing the characteristics of photovoltaic devices. The CV measurements were carried out in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) solution in acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under nitrogen. A platinum (Pt) electrode, coated with the polymer film by dip coating, was used as the working electrode. A Pt wire and Ag/AgNO3 electrode were used as the counter- and reference electrodes, respectively. The HOMO level (EHOMO) of the polymers was calculated from the oxidation potential relative to ferrocene as an internal standard, assuming an ionization potential corresponds to −4.8 eV for the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox system.44,45 In the anodic scan, the onset of the oxidation potential was measured to be 0.86 V for PIF-DBT35, 0.84 V for PIF-DBT50, and 0.70 V for both PIF-DTP35 and PIF-DTP50 relative to ferrocene, which corresponds to EHOMO = −5.64∼−5.66 eV for the DBT-containing polymers and EHOMO = −5.50 eV for the DTP-containing ones. As expected, the change in the DBT (or DTP) content in the polymeric backbone has a negligible effect on the electrochemical behavior. The typical cyclic voltammograms and the determined electronic structures of the polymers are shown in Fig. 3 and 4. Unfortunately, most indenofluorene-based copolymers are intrinsic p-type semiconductors. Therefore, the reduction potential could not be obtained in a cathodic scan of the polymers. The LUMO energy level of the structures was estimated from their EHOMO and optical bandgap derived from the absorption edge in the absorption spectra of the polymers in the film. The optical bandgap (Eg) for PIF-DBT35 (and 50) and PIF-DTP35 (and 50) was estimated to be ∼1.9 eV and ∼1.6 eV, respectively. By combining the EHOMO and Eg, the LUMO energy level (ELUMO) was determined to be −3.7 eV for the DBT-containing polymers and −3.89 eV for the DTP-containing ones. The ELUMO of PIF-DTP is lower than that of PIF-DBT, which means the electron-withdrawing ability of the DTP unit is larger than that of the DBT moiety. We understand that the ICT interaction in PIF-DTP is expected to be more pronounced than that in PIF-DBT, which is closely related to the lower bandgap of PIF-DTP relative to PIF-DBT. Judging from the maximum photon flux of the solar spectrum around 1.6∼1.8 eV, PIF-DBT and PIF-DTP are expected to absorb sunlight effectively and show good photovoltaic properties. The detailed electrochemical data for the four polymers are summarized in Table 2.

Field effect transistor characteristics
To measure the field effect mobility of the charge carriers, organic thin-film transistors (OTFT) were fabricated on a silicon wafer using a top contact geometry (channel length L = 50 μm, width W = 1500 μm) under nitrogen. A heavily n-doped silicon wafer was used as a substrate/gate electrode, with a thermally grown SiO2 dielectric layer (200 nm). The semiconductor active layer was spin-coated with a 0.5 wt.% chlorobenzene solution. Subsequently, the gold source and drain electrode pairs were thermally deposited to a 50 nm thickness by vacuum evaporation (at ∼10−7 torr) through a shadow mask. The TFT devices of the polymers exhibited typical p-channel transistor characteristics. Fig. 5 shows the transfer curves of the polymers and Table 3 summarizes the TFT characteristics (output curves in ESI†). The field-effect mobility was calculated in the saturation regime using the following equation: Ids = (W/2L) μCi (Vgs − Vth)2, where Ids is the drain-source current in the saturated region, W and L are the channel width and length, respectively, μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the insulating layer, and Vgs and Vth are the gate and threshold voltages, respectively.46,47

 Fig. 5  Transfer characteristics of the copolymers at a constant source–drain voltage of −60 V. 
The field-effect mobility for PIF-DBT35, PIF-DBT50, PIF-DTP35 and PIF-DTP50 was determined to be 6.2 × 10−5 cm2V−1s−1, 1.1 × 10−3 cm2V−1s−1, 3.5 × 10−5 cm2V−1s−1 and 5.7 × 10−4 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. The rigid and coplanar indenofluorene fused-ring structure of the polymers must play an important role in increasing the carrier mobility due to efficient intermolecular π–π stacking. As expected, the alternating D–A structures (PIF-DBT50 and PIF-DTP50) show better charge mobility than that of the random copolymeric ones (PIF-DBT35 and PIF-DTP35). The regular alternating incorporation must assist the molecular ordering between polymer backbones. In addition, the DBT-containing structures exhibited ∼2 times higher carrier mobility relative to the ones with the DTP moiety. The drift mobility of each polymer was also measured by the time of flight (TOF) measurement technique (Table 3). Although the drift mobility values are about one half or 1-order less than the field effect mobility, the same trend was measured for both TOF and FET measurements. Higher TOF mobility was measured for the alternating PIF-DBT50 (1.5 × 10−4 cm2V−1s−1) and PIF-DTP50 (7.4 × 10−5 cm2V−1s−1), with compared to the random copolymers, PIF-DBT35 (3.3 × 10−5 cm2V−1s−1) and PIF-DTP35 (2.1 × 10−5 cm2V−1s−1).
The mobility data are in good agreement with photovoltaic properties, and will be discussed in the following section. In addition, the transfer curves of the polymers show the threshold voltages of −15 V for the alternating PIF-DBT50 and PIF-DTP50 and −23 V for PIF-DBT35 and PIF-DTP35, indicating a relatively high density of charge carrier traps for the random structures.22 The higher on/off ratio (∼104) was also measured for the alternating polymers (PIF-DBT50 and PIF-DTP50) than those (∼102) of the random structures (PIF-DBT35 and PIF-DTP35).
Photovoltaic characteristics
The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated by fabricating photovoltaic devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/polymer:PC61BM (80 nm)/Al (100 nm). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonic acid) was deposited as a hole transport layer onto the pre-cleaned ITO glass. On top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, the polymer:PC61BM blend (weight ratio = 1:4) in ortho-dichlorobenzene (1 wt.%) was spin-cast as a photoactive layer. Finally, an aluminium electrode was thermally evaporated through a mask as a cathode under vacuum ≤10−7 Torr, yielding an active area of 0.145 cm2. The photovoltaic spectra and device characteristics were measured under a nitrogen atmosphere. Fig. 6 and 7 show the J-V characteristics of the polymers under the illumination of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) and the measured photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 4. The DBT-containing polymers (PIF-DBT35 and PIF-DBT50) showed better photovoltaic performance than the DTP-containing structures.

The open circuit voltage (Voc) is closely related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the electron acceptor, PC61BM.4,48 As expected from the HOMO energy levels of the polymers (−5.6 eV for PIF-DBT and −5.5 eV for PIF-DTP), the polymers containing DBT show slightly higher Voc than the polymers containing DTP. The Voc for PIF-DBT and PIF-DTP was measured to be ∼0.7 V and 0.5∼0.6 V, respectively. The polymers with the same electron-deficient units (PIF-DBT35 and PIF-DBT50, or PIF-DTP35 and PIF-DTP50) have similar Voc because of almost identical electronic structures. The measured short circuit current (Jsc) for PIF-DBT35, PIF-DBT50, PIF-DTP35 and PIF-DTP50 was 3.91 mA cm−2, 5.26 mA cm−2, 1.53 mA cm−2 and 1.79 mA cm−2, respectively. With increasing content of the electron-deficient moiety (DBT and DTP) from 35% to 50%, the short circuit current density of the polymers also increased in proportional to the feed ratio. As discussed previously, PIF-DBT35 (or PIF-DTP35) were prepared by the Suzuki polymerization of indeonfluorene-diboronic ester (50 mol.%), indenofluorene-dibromide (15 mol.%) and DBT-dibromide (35 mol.%) (or DTP-dibromide, 35 mol.%), yielding a random distribution of the IF, DBT or DTP units in the final structures. In contrast, the PIF-DBT50 and PIF-DTP50 polymers have an alternating D–A configuration. The higher Jsc values for the alternating structures can be understood in terms of the better molecular ordering and π–π stacking, the structural regularity and resulting higher carrier mobility. In addition, PIF-DBT50 has more intense absorption (relative to PIF-DBT35) in the long wavelength region of 450 nm∼650 nm due to higher DBT concentration. This enhanced absorption must contribute to the increased light harvesting effect of the alternating structures. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for all polymer composites with PC61BM were also measured (ESI†). The IPCE spectral shape is similar to that of absorption for each structure, covering 300 nm to 700–800 nm. The IPCE values for the PIF-DBT and PC61BM composites are much higher than those for the PIF-DTP composites, and the alternating copolymers show the higher IPCE values. These data show good agreement with the power conversion efficiency measurements.
The film morphology of the blended film (polymer:PC61BM = 1:4) was also studied by AFM for better understanding of the device characteristics. Fig. 8 shows AFM images of the blended film casted from the polymer solution in ortho-dichlorobenzene. The PIF-DBT polymers show homogeneously well-distributed small-sized domains, but PIF-DTP polymers exhibit relatively larger polymer-PC61BM domains and phase separation. These results indicate that the polymers containing the DBT moiety may form a well-distributed bicontinuous interpenetrating network of polymer-PC61BM domains, showing good agreement with the data of the better J-V characteristics as compared with the DTP-polymers. As shown in Fig. 8, the film morphology of PIF-DBT35 (and PIF-DTP35) shows the rougher surface than the alternating PIF-DBT50 (and PIF-DTP50). The smoother surface (Root Mean Square (RMS) roughness: 2.22 nm for PIF-DBT35, 0.96 nm for PIF-DBT50, 7.24 nm for PIF-DTP35 and 3.66 nm for PIF-DTP50) for the alternating structures is consistent with the measured photovoltaic properties. After annealing the blended films at 100 °C for 10 min, the photovoltaic characteristics were studied and we tried to understand the device properties by correlating the film morphology before and after heat treatment. It is well known that annealing helps the molecular ordering or crystallization of polymers to result in increased film smoothness, polymer/electrode contact, improved Jsc and FF, etc.4 However in our case, the annealing process did not appear to be effective in improving the morphology and device properties for both DBT- and DTP-containing polymers. PIF-DBT35 and PIF-DBT50 showed no improvement in the device performance with negligible heat treatment effect. In the case of the PIF-DTP structures, the Voc is increased by ∼0.1 V but Jsc is similar after annealing. Therefore, the resulting device efficiency was improved slightly. The PIF-DTP polymers showed the noticeably decreased RMS roughness of the film upon heat treatment (7.24 nm for PIF-DTP35 and 3.66 nm for PIF-DTP50 before annealing, 3.43 nm for PIF-DTP35 and 3.07 nm for PIF-DTP50 after annealing). It is believed that the polymer chains interact with PC61BM more strongly and contact with the Al cathode is also influenced by annealing. However, the film roughness was increased slightly in the case of PIF-DBT after the heat treatment process. From the photovoltaic characteristics and morphology data, we guess PIF-DTP may have poor compatibility (or miscibility) with PC61BM, resulting largely in phase-separated domains, even though they show broader absorption compared to PIF-DBT.

Among the PIF-based four copolymers, PIF-DBT50 showed the best photovoltaic performance (Voc = 0.69 V, Jsc = 5.26 mA cm−2, PCE = 1.48%) with PC61BM as an electron acceptor. To optimize the device, we tentatively fabricated a photovoltaic cell by using a combination of PIF-DBT50 as a donor and PC71BM in place of PC61BM as an acceptor. Because of the lifted spherical symmetry of PC71BM (compared to PC61BM), the blended polymer:PC71BM mixture has higher absorption and the resulting photovoltaic properties are possibly improved.49 The similar device having configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PIF-DBT50:PC71BM (80 nm)/Al (100 nm) was fabricated. Substantially improved photovoltaic properties were obtained with Voc = 0.77 V, Jsc = 5.50 mA cm−2, PCE = 1.70% (Fig. 9). This suggests the possibility of further improvements in the device. These data are preliminary and optimization of the device with PC71BM is currently under investigation.

Conclusions
In summary, we studied molecular design, synthesis of the indenofluorene-based low bandgap copolymers and their photovoltaic properties with PCBM derivatives. Polyindenofluorene (PIF) polymers have an extended coplanar fused structure, yielding more enhanced π-conjugation, π–π intermolecular interactions and charge mobility than polyfluorenes. In addition, the indenofluorene moiety has two sites for attaching side chains with the improved solubility and solution-processability. The ICT type PIF polymers showed a low bandgap of ∼1.9 eV and ∼1.6 eV for PIF-DBT and PIF-DTP films, respectively, which could harvest the broad solar spectrum covering 300∼650 nm (PIF-DBT) and 300∼800 nm (PIF-DTP) in film. The optical, electrochemical, charge mobility, film morphology and the resulting photovoltaic properties were studied in detail. Among the polymers, the alternating PIF-DBT50 copolymer showed the best photovoltaic performance with Voc = 0.69 V, Jsc = 5.26 mA cm−2, hole mobility of 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and PCE = 1.48%, when the polymers were blended with PC61BM under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination conditions. The device performance was further improved using PC71BM as an acceptor, showing a power conversion efficiency of 1.70%.
