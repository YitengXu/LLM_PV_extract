The different sources of ionizing radiation can be roughly divided into two categories: natural background ionizing radiation and man-made ionizing radiation. All organisms on earth are constantly bombarded by natural background ionizing radiation caused by cosmic, solar, and terrestrial radiation sources. All the food, water, and air that humans ingest or inhale contain radionuclides from natural background ionizing radiation sources. The man-made ionizing radiation exposures include diagnostic medical procedures (e.g. X-rays, radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine), smoke detectors, fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, releases or discharges from the management of radioactive waste, and releases from nuclear reactor accidents, like the accidents at Chernobyl in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) in 2011.1,2 To protect the environment and to provide a secure radiation environment that mitigates the increased risk of cancer and other diseases and the effects associated with exposure to ionizing radiation, radiation protection requirements are often set based on international recommendations for ionizing radiation, that is, ICRP (International Commission on Radiological Protection) recommendations. ICRP has published more than one hundred reports on all aspects of radiological protection to develop the international system of radiological protection based on the current understanding of the science of radiation exposures and effects and value judgments.3The FDNPP accident has renewed public interest in the dangers posed by radioactive contamination in the environment and the related internal exposure from the contaminating radionuclides. Thus, this review focuses on two research areas in the framework of radiation protection: (1) protection of the environment from radioactive contamination by man-made ionizing radiation sources, such as the fallout of atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, the release and discharges of radionuclides from radioactive waste management, and the accidental release of radionuclides; and (2) protection of humans from internal exposure by artificial radionuclides with new consideration for improving the existing dose estimation, such as the construction of information about inhomogeneous distribution at sub-cellular level and chemical toxicity of internal radionuclides.Although many factors control the amount, or dose, of radiation received from a source, there are three principles to reduce the amount of radiation possibly received: reducing the time of an exposure reduces the effective dose proportionally; increasing the distance between the source and the exposed object reduces the radiation dose due to the inverse square law; and effectively adapting suitable shielding. These are, however, possible only for external radiation protection. For many cases in which the atomic spectrometric techniques have found important applications relate to long-lived radionuclides, mostly alpha and beta-ray emitters. Although the contribution of these radionuclides to external dose is usually quite low, their excess intake into the human body severely affects internal dose, for example, the radiation weighting factor for alpha rays is 20 times higher than that of gamma rays. To effectively determine the presence of these artificial long-lived radionuclides, sensitive and accurate analysis of the radiation source, including the amount and area of the radioactive contamination, is essential. In this review, a summary and analysis is made of studies on the determination of artificial radionuclides in the environment and studies on internal radiation exposure using atomic spectrometric techniques, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF). No attempt is made to make an exhaustive review of all related literature, but rather focus is placed on radio-ecological studies of radionuclide contamination in the environment in Japan, radio-ecological studies of soil–plant transfer of radionuclides related to the geological disposal of radioactive waste, and toxicological studies on uranium internal exposure to highlight the important role of atomic spectrometry in radiation protection research.2 Analytical techniques employed in radiation protectionRadionuclides are measured by several conventional radiometric methods (α spectrometry, γ spectrometry, β counting) depending on their radiation characteristics. For the determination of radionuclides with short half-lives especially, these conventional radiometric methods are commonly used. However, for the analysis of long-lived radionuclides, the use of radiometric methods is somehow limited by the long detection time due to the low sensitivity and the low activity of the radionuclides. Sometimes, separation of the target radionuclide is necessary because other radionuclides that interfere with counting are included in environmental samples. In addition, radiometric methods cannot separate some isotopic elements; thus the isotopic ratio cannot be obtained (for example the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio), which is important for tracing the behavior of radionuclides and identifying the contamination source. The development of mass spectrometry has introduced another option to overcome these problems.In the 1990s, Smith et al.4 made a comparison between atomic and radiation detection methods for radionuclides; in particular, Crain et al.5 compared the determination of long-lived radionuclides with ICP-MS and alpha spectrometry. Unlike radiometric methods, mass spectrometry detects the number of radionuclide atomic ions directly and gives the concentration of the radionuclides at a trace or an ultra-trace level with high precision and accuracy. Among commercially available mass spectrometric methods, AMS, thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) and ICP-MS are most widely used. Mass spectrometry uses a smaller amount of sample and needs less time for the determination of radionuclides than radiometric techniques. Nevertheless, it cannot replace radiometric techniques for the analysis of many radionuclides because of its higher cost, less accessibility and the problem of isobaric interference. A comprehensive review comparing radiometric methods (α spectrometry, γ spectrometry, β counting) and mass spectrometric methods, ICP-MS, AMS, TIMS, resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS) for the determination of 15 kinds of radionuclides (14C, 99Te, 129I, 237Np etc.) was published by Hou and Roos.6 In recent years, the application of microbeam elemental analytical techniques (PIXE and SR-XRF) has increased for studies in material science, environmental monitoring and biological and medical analysis.Here, in this review the focus is mainly on the mass spectrometry methods of AMS, TIMS and ICP-MS and the microbeam elemental analytical methods of PIXE and SR-XRF for the determination of radionuclides and elements for radiological protection studies. A comparison of the radiometric methods and the discussed mass spectrometric techniques for radionuclides analysis is presented in Table 1, and the general characteristics of microbeam elemental analytical techniques are summarized in Table 2.

The earliest application of AMS was to measure 14C (t1/2 = 5.7 × 103 years), which has an abundance ratio to stable 12C in living organisms of 10−12. AMS has the highest sensitivity among the radiometric and other mass spectrometry methods. For the determination of 14C by decay counting, 48 h is needed in order to achieve 0.5% statistical precision with a sample weight of 1 g. By using AMS, the same precision can be reached in 10 min with just a 1 mg sample.7 Developments in the past 30 years have expanded AMS use to more than just 14C dating; it is now applied to the determination of such radionuclides, as 3H, 10Be, 99Tc, 129I, 210Pb, 236U, 237Np, 239Pu and 240Pu.In AMS, the radionuclides are firstly subjected to ion sputtering and then the sputtered secondary negative ions are accelerated and mass separated by a magnet. Because some elements which hamper the mass analysis of radionuclides of interest cannot form negative ions, the interferences can be reduced to a very low level when AMS is used. The mass-separated negative ions are accelerated and stripped in a gas target stripper where they lose electrons and gain highly positive charges (e.g. Pu7+). The stripping process dissociates molecular ions and if enough electrons are removed thus further eliminating isobaric interferences. After the second stage acceleration, a magnetic analyzer is used for the final target ion detection.Fifield et al.8 used AMS for the determination of Pu and achieved the detection limit of 106 atoms of Pu. For conventional α spectrometry, the detection limit is about 50 μBq,9 which is at least two orders of magnitude higher than AMS. With the outstanding capability to obtain abundance ratios as low as 10−5 for very small samples, another successful application of AMS is the determination of the 236U/238U ratio. Kraft et al.10 measured a 236U/238U ratio of 6.5 × 10−12 by using calorimetric low-temperature detector in AMS. The AMS sensitivity is significantly higher than that obtained by ICP-MS (10−7)11 and TIMS (10−10).12 A comprehensive review of AMS for the determination of actinides was published by Fifield.13AMS is now capable of determining of many long-lived radionuclides and has been used in the areas of environmental science, biomedicine, nuclear safeguards etc. However, only a few radionuclides are routinely analyzed by AMS. The main limitations to its application are the difficulty in distinguishing isotopes of different elements with the same mass-to-charge ratio, the high instrument cost and complicated machine operation.2.2 Thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS)During the past 30 years TIMS has been frequently used for the determination of radionuclides such as uranium, plutonium, thorium, neptunium and radium.14–20 Thermal ionization can produce ion beams with very high ionization yields ranging to 10% or more with low background due to the selectivity of the surface ionization mechanism. A small volume (down to 1 μL) of aqueous sample solution is deposited on a cleaned filament surface (usually high-purity Re) where the evaporation and ionization process takes place. Normally, single magnetic sector field mass spectrometers are sufficient for the separation of ions due to the low initial energies (0.1–0.2 eV) of the ions formed on the hot thermal surface. A precision of better than 0.01% was achieved for the measurement of isotopic ratios of long-lived radionuclides by TIMS.21 The development of a multi collector system combined with automated thermal ionization mass spectrometers, however, has improved the precision for isotopic analysis to 0.001%.22The main application of TIMS is focused on isotope ratio measurement. Beasley et al.15 and Kelley et al.16 used TIMS to measure the atom ratios of 237Np/239Pu, 240Pu/239Pu, 241Pu/239Pu and 242Pu/239Pu derived from global fallout in soils collected around the world to provide regional baselines for recognizing possible future environmental inputs of non-fallout Pu and Np. Using TIMS, Delanghe et al.19 determined the atom ratio of 238U/234U in water samples collected from the main ocean basins and the Mediterranean Sea. TIMS has also been used for the quantification of radionuclides in biological samples. For example, Kelly and Fassett23 developed a procedure for the determination of U in biological tissues with isotope dilution TIMS.In recent years, TIMS has not been the main tool for isotope ratio measurement; rather TIMS has been gradually replaced by ICP-MS, especially MC-ICP-MS in the fields of nuclear chemistry and geochemistry. Walczyk24 made a comparison of TIMS and MC-ICP-MS applied to the isotope ratio measurement. Briefly, when compared with MC-ICP-MS, TIMS has a few disadvantages, including its complicated sample preparation (the sample has to be separated from the matrix, presented in a solid state for the mass spectrometer measurement and heated carefully to obtain a stable ion beam); lack of multi-element capability and restriction to elements with ionization potential less than 6 eV. However, TIMS will remain as a reference technique for isotope ratio measurement and its application in radiation protection studies can be expected.2.3 Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)ICP-MS was developed by combining an inductively coupled plasma source at normal pressure with mass spectrometry.25 Since its first commercial introduction at the Pittsburgh Conference in 1983, ICP-MS has been frequently used for the accurate and precise determination of radionuclides in nuclear material samples,26,27 radioactive waste samples,28–30 environmental samples,31–33 geological samples,34,35 and biological samples.36-39 ICP-MS has great advantages due to its relatively low cost, easy sample introduction and high sample throughput when compared with other mass spectrometric methods. Isotopic analysis of long-lived radionuclides (99Tc, t1/2 = 2.1 × 105 years; 129I, t1/2 = 1.7 × 107 years; 238U, t1/2 = 4.5 × 109 years; 239Pu, t1/2 = 2.4 × 104 years; 240Pu, t1/2 = 6.5 × 103 years; 237Np, t1/2 = 2.1 × 106 years) has been the main application of ICP-MS40,41 in radiation protection studies.U and Pu isotopes in various samples have been determined by many researchers with ICP-MS due to the low detection limit and short analysis time.40–43 Previously, in general, 129I was determined by AMS or neutron activation analysis (NAA) while ICP-MS was used to measure total I concentration in environmental samples44–52 since 129I determination by ICP-MS was not sensitive enough, e.g., 9 mBq kg−1 (ref. 53) due to interferences from trace amounts of 129Xe in the Ar gas used to generate the plasma. However, the recent development of reaction cell quadruple ICP-MS using O2 as a reaction gas has significantly improved the capability of ICP-MS for 129I analysis.54,55 For the determination of 99Tc using ICP-MS, the isobaric interference of 99Ru is a troublesome problem for low level analysis. Uchida and Tagami56 used TEVA resin to remove 99Ru from samples prior to the determination of 99Tc by ICP-MS. This method was optimized by Song and Probst57 and the isobaric interference of 99Ru on 99Tc was eliminated for up to a 100-fold excess of Ru in samples with matrix contents. Another challenge for low level 99Tc analysis is the lack of a suitable yield tracer when the isotopic dilution ICP-MS method is used. Usually, short half-lived 99mTc and 95mTc have been used for the determination of 99Tc.58,59 However, the preparation and storage of these tracers are troublesome and a quick chemical separation is needed when 99mTc was used due to its short half-life of 6.01 h. Mas et al.60 successfully applied Re instead of 99mTc and 95mTc as a yield tracer to 99Tc analysis in seaweed samples. The determination of 237Np by ICP-MS faced the same problem. The long half-lived 236Np (t1/2 = 1.54 × 105 years) and short half-lived 239Np (t1/2 = 2.36 days) are not available with a suitable purity. 242Pu has proven to be a useful alternative tracer for the determination of 237Np (ref. 61 and 62) and for the simultaneous determination of 237Np and Pu isotopes in environmental samples.33,63Nowadays, the determination of radionuclides with relatively short half-lives, such as 241Am (t1/2 = 432.7 years), 90Sr (t1/2 = 29.1 years) and 137Cs (t1/2 = 30.2 years) has also been carried out by some researchers using ICP-MS with low detection limits.64–67 The typical detection limits for the analysis of important radionuclides using ICP-MS and the conventional radiometric counting techniques are summarized in Table 3.

Becker40 reviewed the capability of different types of ICP-MS for isotope ratio measurement of long-lived radionuclides. More specifically, Kim et al.124 and Ketterer and Szechenyi41 described and discussed the sample preparation procedures for the measurement of ultra-trace level Pu isotopes and other transuranic elements by ICP-MS and the interference problems. Although ICP-MS is intensively used for radionuclides studies nowadays, there are still a variety of analytical issues that hamper the accuracy and precision of the analysis. The details of factors such as spectral and non-spectral interferences and the instrumental limitations for ICP-MS have been reviewed by Lariviere et al.123 Recently, Rodushkin et al.125 discussed the application of ICP-MS for isotope ratio measurement in various clinical samples which are relevant to monitoring occupational or environmental exposure, human provenancing and reconstructing migration pathways as well as metabolic research.ICP-MS has the advantage of being able to measure both radioactive and stable analytes simultaneously, which is important for the yield tracing method. The detection limit of ICP-MS ranges from 10−15 to 10−8 g depending on the sensitivity of the instrument and the mass interferences. Using double-focusing sector field ICP-MS, the sensitivity for determination of long-lived radionuclides was reported to vary from 0.17 to 22.57 GHz ppm−1 with different types of nebulizers.126 The precision for isotope ratio measurements by double-focusing sector field ICP-MS with single ion detection is about 0.1%. While using the multi-ion collector device, one order magnitude higher precision can be achieved, although MC-ICP-MS will typically consume considerably more analyte in achieving this high precision.The main problem for the determination of radionuclides by ICP-MS is the occurrence of interferences, especially the isobaric interferences. To solve this problem, a variety of methods have been used, such as carrying out chemical separation prior to the analysis, choosing the optimum sample introduction system and the instrumental setup and introducing a chemical reaction using a pressurized reaction cell. The determination of Pu in environmental samples by ICP-MS is a successful example for the elimination of interferences. Ion exchange and extraction chromatography methods are widely used for the separation of U and Pu in the determination of Pu by ICP-MS. The decontamination factor of U normally ranges from 103 to 106.31,63,127 Combined with the proper nebulizer and sample introduction system, which can achieve a UH+/U ratio as low as 10−5, the diatomic ion interferences from U for the determination of Pu at an ultra-trace level in environment samples can be constrained to be negligible.84,128,129The precise and fast determination of radionuclides after a nuclear accident is essential for rapid risk assessment and taking emergency action. Prior to the ICP-MS analysis, pre-concentration and separation procedures, which may take several days, were normally needed. Nowadays, on-line separation methods (flow injection/sequential injection) are available for the measurement of radionuclides in combination with ICP-MS. A typical separation system is composed of a multi-port valve, a solvent distributor, a peristaltic pump and chromatographic columns. The system is controlled by a PC and the time for the whole determination procedure is normally less than a few hours. The on-line methods have been successfully used for the determination of 99Tc, 90Sr, and actinides, etc.33,61,62,128,130–133 The advantages of the on-line separation methods include: less time and labor are needed; less cross contamination of samples occurs; there is less contact with toxic chemical reagents for the staff; and there is a direct connection with the ICP-MS detector for the analysis.2.4 Microbeam elemental analysisInformation about inhomogeneous distribution of radionuclides at sub-cellular level has been needed for accurate dose estimation. Microbeam elemental analysis is an expected method for this study. In the 1980s, the second generation facilities for synchrotron radiation were completed and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) analysis grew in use.134 In the 1990s, the beam size was reduced to several micrometers and the analytical technique came to be widely applied for biological samples.135–138 In the mid to late-1990s, the third generation facilities for synchrotron radiation became available in the United States, Europe, and Japan, they utilized a fine beam with high brightness which enables detection of trace elements in tissues at a sub ppm level. Recently, nano-beams (50 × 50 nm2) have also become available for XRF and XAFS.139 The spatial resolution of micro-PIXE is also at the submicron level140 and the analytical method is capable of determining trace elements in tissues at a several ppm level. Both SR-XRF and micro-PIXE cause little damage to tissue specimens. The elemental distribution in tissues obtained by these methods, therefore, can be related to the histopathological information of serial sections.In contrast to SR-XRF and micro-PIXE, which are operated in large shared facilities, microbeam based mass spectrometry techniques, such as laser ablation (LA)-ICP-MS and SIMS, are carried out in laboratories.141–143 The beam size of SIMS has been improved to the submicron level and the technique has been applied for determination of elements in cultured cells.142 The technique may damage biological samples but there is a great potential for determination of elemental profiles in the fine structure of tissues and single cells.3 Radio-ecological studies on radionuclides contamination in the environmentSeveral significant radioactive contamination events have occurred in Japan (Fig. 1), including the Nagasaki and Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations in 1945, close-in fallout contamination in the marine environment from the US nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s in the Pacific, global fallout contamination from atmospheric weapon tests in the 1960s, Chernobyl fallout contamination in 1986, contamination from the JCO criticality accident in 1999, and contamination from the FDNPP accident in 2011. In the radio-ecological studies for these events, mass spectrometric analytical methods, especially ICP-MS and AMS have been used to provide new insights into source identification, environmental behavior of radionuclides in the environment, and radiation dose estimation. Fig. 1  Application of atomic spectrometric techniques in radio-ecological studies carried out in Japan. 3.1 Nagasaki and Hiroshima atomic-bomb detonation in 1945In August, 1945, atomic bombs were exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since then, extensive studies related to radiation dose assessment for survivors of these bombs have been conducted.144,145 Among the sources of radiation that contributed to the radiation doses to survivors, e.g. direct radiation, induced radioactivity, and fallout contamination, less is known about the isotope composition and contamination range of atomic bomb-derived fallout.146 It is known that the “black-rain” area of Hiroshima and the Nishiyama area of Nagasaki had received the heaviest fallout from the atomic bombs.147 Radiation exposure due to this close-in fallout was not included in a recently developed dose system DS02 (Dosimetry System 2002)148 because its contribution was considered to be small for the survivors who were mainly inside the city at the time of the bombings. In relation to the expanded social welfare compensation for atomic bomb survivors, recently, concerns about radiation exposure due to close-in fallout have been raised among people who experienced the black-rain close-in fallout exposure. To address these concerns, atomic spectrometric techniques, such as ICP-MS and AMS, have been used to determine the U and Pu isotope composition in the close-in fallout samples to identify the close-in fallout contamination range, and to study the migration behavior of Pu and 241Am (ingrowth from the radioactive decay of 241Pu) in the environment.In an early study on uranium isotopes in Hiroshima “black rain” soils, Takada et al.149 observed that the 234U/238U activity ratios of U leached from the contaminated soil in the fallout area were significantly higher than those of the control area according to alpha ray spectrometry analysis, and that there was a good correlation of 137Cs contents and 234U/238U activity ratio. Fujikawa et al.146 analyzed the only existing physical remains of the black rain from the Hiroshima atomic bomb (Little Boy), a plastered wall with black streaks, using quadrupole ICP-MS for 235U/238U isotope ratio. The 235U/238U atom ratios in the black surface plaster samples were found to be distinctively higher than the values for natural uranium, and excess 137Cs was also detected in these samples, indicating that the black streaks on the wall originated from Little Boy since it used enriched 235U. Recently, it was considered that the determination of 236U (t1/2 = 2.342 × 107 years, α-decay), which is formed by the nuclear reaction 235U(n,γ), might be a useful indicator for clarifying the close-in fallout level and deposition area. The feasibility of using 236U to reconstruct close-in fallout deposition from the Hiroshima atomic bomb was explored by Sakaguchi et al.144 using AMS.A series of studies on Pu isotopes related to the Nagasaki atomic bomb have been conducted. Kudo et al.150 estimated that the total amount of deposition in the local fallout region of 264 km2 was 37.5 g of 239+240Pu. They also suggested the global transport of Nagasaki Pu to the Arctic. Continuous monitoring of the 239+240Pu activity in Nishiyama soils,151–156 disclosed the fact that high concentration of Pu remained in the uncultivated soils. The contribution of Nagasaki atomic bomb source Pu to the total deposition was estimated from determination of the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio in soils and in sediment core samples using ICP-MS.154,155 An investigation of the geographical distribution of bomb-derived Pu in the eastern area of Nagasaki, carried out by ICP-MS analysis for the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio, revealed that Pu from the atomic bomb fallout was deposited from the hypocenter to points 100 km eastwards.155 Regarding the mobility of Pu in the soil, Mahara and Miyahara157 studied the residual Pu downward migration in soil, and found that only 3% of the total Pu in the soil was dispersed over a 0.3 to 2.25 m depth, ca. 97% Pu was retained to a depth of 0.3 m.In contrast to the comprehensive studies on Pu in Nishiyama area, a great knowledge gap exists on the concentration variation, the mobility and the soil–plant transfer of 241Am. In the past 60 years, almost no effort was made for 241Am study in Nishiyama soil due largely to the difficulty of 241Am analysis. The only reported work on 241Am was made by Yamamoto et al.153 in 1983, who measured 241Am concentrations in several soil samples collected from Nishiyama area. Recently, Zheng and Yamada64 and Zheng et al.158 developed a sensitive SF-ICP-MS based analytical method for 241Am analysis, and applied to the study of ingrowth of 241Am in Nishiyama soils with a focus on the mobility of the oldest Pu–Am in the environment. As shown in Fig. 2, the 241Am/239+240Pu activity ratios and 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios showed similar variation with the increase of 239+240Pu activities in the surface soil (0–5 cm). In addition, it was found that the 241Am/239+240Pu activity ratio (0.036 ± 0.006) detected in a soil core (0–15 cm) from the Nishiyama area in 2008 approached the predicted maximum value, indicating that 241Am and Pu were still together in the soils after six decades and that there were no significant differences regarding their downward migration behavior.158 Fig. 2  Relationships for surface 0–5 cm forest soils: (A) between 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios and 239+240Pu activity concentrations, and (B) between 241Am/239+240Pu activity ratios and 239+240Pu activity concentrations. Pu isotope data are cited from Yoshida et al.154 and 241Am data are cited from Zheng et al.158 3.2 Close-in fallout contamination from the US nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and related marine pollution in the Pacific OceanThe Pacific Proving Ground (PPG), consisting of Bikini (11°35′ N 162°15′ E) and Enewetak (11°30′ N 162°15′ E) Atolls, was used by the United States to conduct a series of nuclear tests. From 1946 to 1958, 66 nuclear tests took place with a combined yield of 107 Mt, which is approximately 20% of the estimated total yield of all atmospheric nuclear testing.159 As a high proportion of these nuclear tests were conducted at or near ground level, a large amount of radioactivity was delivered regionally as close-in fallout. These close-in fallout derived radionuclides caused significant contamination of the North Pacific and its marginal seas.160 Bowen et al.161 suggested that 28% of the known fission yields from the nuclear tests of the PPG gave rise to close-in fallout and that made the inventories of 90Sr, 137Cs and 239+240Pu two times higher than expected from the global fallout. Aarkrog estimated that the total inputs of 90Sr, 137Cs and 239+240Pu from the PPG into the ocean were 113 PBq, 181 PBq and 2 PBq, respectively.162The Bravo large-scale thermonuclear test explosion was conducted at Bikini Atoll on 1 March 1954. A Japanese fishing vessel, the Fifth Fukuryu-Maru, with 23 fishermen aboard was heavily contaminated by the radionuclide debris from this test, the so called “Bikini ash”.163 This exposure incident and the related marine contamination caused by the PPG close-in fallout caused great public concern in Japan. Intensive studies were carried out to investigate the distribution of radionuclides in the Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas to understand their transport and fate. Nagaya and Nakamura164–167 determined Pu concentration in sediments in the East China, Yellow and Seto Inland Seas. They also determined the vertical distribution of 239+240Pu, 137Cs and 90Sr in seawater of the Central North Pacific.164 In addition, Yamada and co-workers investigated 137Cs and 239+240Pu in sediments collected from Sagami and Tokyo Bays and in water collected from the Japan Sea.168–170 These studies found general excess inventories of these radionuclides over the global fallout. However, as these studies were conducted by using radiometric methods, the atom ratios (for example 240Pu/239Pu), which are powerful fingerprints for radionuclide source identification, were not determined. The cause of the additional radionuclides input in the Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas remains uncertain.In recent years, the application of mass spectrometry, especially ICP-MS, provides a perfect tool for distinguishing PPG close-in fallout contamination in the Pacific Ocean from global fallout. Muramatsu et al.171 determined the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio in the soil collected from the Marshall Islands using ICP-MS and they found that the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio (>0.30) for the PPG close-in fallout is significantly higher than that of the global fallout (0.18). The results were consistent with the results observed by Diamond et al.172 and Buesseler,173 and proved that the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio could be used for Pu source identification in the Pacific Ocean. By using SF-ICP-MS, Zheng and Yamada174 investigated the vertical distribution of 239+240Pu and 240Pu/239Pu in sediment cores collected from Sagimi Bay and they observed the 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio (0.24–0.29) was higher than the global fallout in the sediments. This result clearly indicated Pu contamination from the PPG close-in fallout in Japanese near coastal areas due to ocean current transport and the portion of Pu derived from the PPG close-in fallout was estimated to be about 50%. This conclusion was further evidenced by investigations of seawater and sediments in a wide range of sea areas near Japan.175–182 The background data for Pu distribution in the seas near Japan has been established by using mass spectrometry; this is important for further assessing possible discharges from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Aomori, Japan, and the Fukushima DNPP accident.183–185Besides Pu, other radionuclides at trace or ultra-trace level in the ocean have also been studied. A large volume in situ filtration and concentration system was developed for the measurement of low-level radioactivity in seawater.186 This system can collect 4–11 m3 volumes of seawater at a specific water depth and filter the seawater in situ over 3–5 h. Vertical profiles of the size-fractionated particulate and dissolved forms of radionuclides can be obtained. Using this system, seawater samples from the coastal area of Aomori, where the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant began test operations from 2006, were collected. Nakanishi et al.102 determined 99Tc in these samples with SF-ICP-MS and found that the 99Tc/137Cs activity ratio in the water column showed gradual decreases with depth, which indicated the more conservative manner of 99Tc than 137Cs in marine environments. Zheng and Yamada187 and Okubo et al.188 determined 235U/238U and 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios in sediments and marine particles collected with the large volume in situ filtration and concentration system by SF-ICP-MS, respectively, and they observed no extra contamination from the nuclear fuel processing plant at the investigated sites. The Pu contamination originated from the global fallout and the PPG close-in fallout.3.3 Global fallout contaminationAnthropogenic radionuclides have been introduced into the environment as a result of human activities such as atmospheric nuclear weapons tests and spent fuel reprocessing. From the 541 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests189 conducted in the 20th century, large amounts of radionuclides were released, which resulted in global fallout contamination. For example, approximately 6 tons of 239Pu has been released into the environment from these tests. The highest yearly global fallout deposition was observed in 1963 due to a series of large-scale atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted by the former Soviet Union in 1961–1962. During the period from 1964 to 1980, 22 atmospheric tests were conducted by China at Lop Nor, and from 1966 to 1974, 41 atmospheric weapons tests were conducted by France in the South Pacific Ocean.189 Operation of nuclear fuel reprocessing plants has also caused worldwide contamination by 129I and 99Tc.190,191 From the viewpoint of environmental radiation protection, information on the distribution, inventory and isotopic composition of Pu isotopes, U isotopes, 129I, and 99Tc is necessary due to their long half-lives and high toxicity. In addition, studies on global fallout radioactive contamination can provide insights into the environmental behavior of radionuclides, and baseline data of radioactive contamination for a region which is essential important for identifying and assessing any non-global fallout radioactive contamination. Fig. 3 summarized the typical range of isotope ratios and activity ratios of global fallout radionuclides in Japanese soils. Fig. 3  Typical range of isotopic ratios and activity ratios of global fallout radionuclides in Japanese soils (*activity ratio). Technetium-99 is a pure beta emitter and is produced in the fission of 235U or 239Pu with a relatively high fission yield of ca. 6% like 137Cs; thus this radionuclide was also found in global fallout. As shown in Table 3, the conventional radiometric method for 99Tc analysis in environmental samples is liquid scintillation counting (LSC).192,193 Brown et al.194 applied ICP-MS to measure this long-lived radionuclide in seaweeds and obtained the concentration range of 35–350 ng g−1, which is quite high, however, they failed to measure 99Tc in rain water contaminated by the Chernobyl accident collected in the UK because of the limited sensitivity of the ICP-MS at its early stage of development. Lower detection limit of 0.6 fg for 99Tc was achieved by integrating electrothermal vaporization and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ETV-ICP-MS).195 Kim et al.97 found suitable measurement conditions for SF-ICP-MS and could compare the 99Tc concentrations with those of other radionuclides such as 137Cs and Pu. Tagami and Uchida101 applied ICP-QMS to measure global fallout 99Tc in Japanese soils and obtained the concentration range of 4–88 mBq kg−1. By comparing the vertical distribution of the 99Tc/137Cs activity ratio, they found that the migration rate of 99Tc would be just slightly faster than that of 137Cs in the soil.Toyama et al.191 made the first systematic investigation of variations of 129I in atmospheric fallout over Tokyo, Japan from 1963–2003. Using AMS, they measured 129I/127I ratios in archived samples of precipitation and particulate matter that were collected in Tokyo by the Meteorological Research Institute, Japan (MRI) between 1963 and 2003. The 129I/127I ratios in the atmosphere during 1963–1977 ranged from 1 × 10−8 to 2 × 10−8, which is ca. 4 orders of magnitude higher than pre-atomic era levels, possibly due to atmospheric nuclear weapons tests. After 1978, high 129I depositions were observed, and Toyama et al.191 suggested that the atmospheric 129I fallout was influenced primary by the 129I discharge from the Tokai reprocessing plant. This study provided useful information for understanding 129I deposition levels prior to the FDNPP accident for the retrospective assessment of 131I using 129I analysis. The 235U/238U atom ratios in the same atmospheric deposition samples collected by the MRI were analyzed by Kikawada et al.196 using ICP-MS. They found that the 235U/238U ratios between 1964 and 2000 were slightly higher than the natural ratio, suggesting that the fused sands and soils containing enriched uranium originating from the hypocenter of nuclear test sites in Central Asia have been transported continuously to Japan by the prevailing westerly winds since the 1960s.The first results on 236U levels in global fallout were reported by Sakaguchi et al.197 who used AMS analysis of surface soils which are solely influenced by global fallout. Based on the consistent 236U/239Pu ratios of 0.212–0.253 in the soil cores, they estimated the total global fallout of 236U on the earth as ca. 900 kg. 236U has been considered to be a potential tracer for uranium contamination from nuclear fuel or wastes; hence, the value estimated in their study will be very helpful in future applications.For Pu isotopes, 240Pu/239Pu (0.180 ± 0.007) and 241Pu/239Pu (0.00194 ± 0.00014) atom ratios in global fallout have been reported by Krey et al.198 and Kelley et al.16 from TIMS analysis of soil samples collected worldwide. In these studies, only two soil samples were collected in Tokyo and Hokkaido and analyzed. After the cessation of atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, 239+240Pu in atmospheric deposition has decreased according to the stratospheric residence time of radioactive debris. However, a long-term monitoring record of atmospheric deposition of Pu concentration and isotopes in Japan has shown that the decline in the deposition has almost ceased since 1988.199 Hence, it is obvious that the plutonium is supplied from reservoirs other than the stratosphere. A resuspension process, in which radioactive materials deposited on the ground are suspended again in the air along with soil particles by storm activity, is suggested as the major influence controlling the deposition of Pu as well as other anthropogenic radionuclides.200–202 Zhang et al.203 analyzed Pu activity and its isotopic composition in a reference fallout material provided by the MRI, prepared by atmospheric deposits collected at 14 stations throughout Japan in 1963–1979. It was found that both the atom ratios, 240Pu/239Pu (0.1922 ± 0.0044) and 241Pu/239Pu (0.00287 ± 0.00056, 241Pu decay corrected to 1st January 2000), were slightly higher than those of global fallout, which could be attributed to the deposition of fallout radionuclides resulting from the Chinese nuclear weapons tests conducted in the 1970s. Pu isotopes in soil samples were also analyzed using ICP-MS.204,205 The typical global fallout 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio (0.17–0.19) were observed in soils collected in 10 Prefectures in Japan, and the 239+240Pu activity ranged from 0.15–4.31 mBq g−1. These baseline Pu data have played an important role in the identification of Pu contamination in the environment since the FDNPP accident (see Section 3.6).3.4 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) accident in 1986The explosion of Reactor no. 4 at the Chernobyl NPP on 26 April, 1986 profoundly affected the whole world due to the substantial release of radioactive materials into the environment. The Chernobyl-derived Pu isotopes, which are characterized by higher activity ratios of 238Pu/239+240Pu and 241Pu/239+240Pu than those of the nuclear test-derived global fallout Pu, were detected in deposition and airborne dust samples in Japan.206 Radionuclides released from the Chernobyl NPP are summarized in the OECD/NEA report on the Chernobyl accident;207 the radionuclides with a half-life longer than 10 years and their percentages in the total release to the core inventory were estimated as follows: 20–40% for 137Cs; 4–6% for 90Sr; and 3.5% for Pu isotopes (238Pu, 239Pu, 240Pu and 241Pu). The releases of other long-lived radionuclides, like 99Tc and 241Am, are not well known. It was pointed out in IAEA-1239 (ref. 208) that 99Tc was not important for radiological protection in areas affected by Chernobyl fallout, but would add to knowledge about its environmental behavior. Since the accident, scientists in Japan have been continuously investigating the environmental impact of the Chernobyl accident using atomic spectrometric techniques for the analysis of Pu isotopes, 99Tc, and 129I.Muramatsu et al.209 used ICP-MS to determine 239Pu and 240Pu in soil samples collected from three forest sites within the 30 km zone around the Chernobyl reactor. The average 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio in contaminated surface soil samples, values of which are scarce in the literature,210 was 0.408. This ratio was much higher than that of global fallout (ca. 0.18), and it was related to the high burn-up grade of the reactor fuel. It was noted that there were almost no differences in the 240Pu/239Pu ratios between the individual samples analyzed, although the 239+240Pu activity levels varied widely depending on the distance from the reactor and on the soil layers investigated. It was estimated that about half of the Pu had migrated from the organic layers to the underlying mineral layers 9 years after the accident. The published 241Pu/239Pu atom ratios of Chernobyl were summarized by Ketterer et al.,210 and the released amount of 241Pu was 2.6 PBq.211 The total activity of 241Am will increase with time due to the radioactive decay of 241Pu. It was estimated that the maximum total amount of 241Am will be 0.077 PBq in the year 2058; this is more than two times the released amounts of 239+240Pu (0.031 PBq).212ICP-MS determination of 99Tc in soil samples collected within the 30 km zone from the Chernobyl NPP was carried out by Uchida et al.213 and they estimated the percentage of 99Tc inventory released to the environment was about 2–3%; this value was close to that of other refractory elements. Tagami and Uchida214 also measured 99Tc in plant samples collected in the 30 km zone by ICP-MS and clarified that the obtained soil-to-plant transfer of 99Tc was not as high as expected from laboratory studies.129I as an indicator of a nuclear accident was applied after the Chernobyl NPP accident; 129I was used as the witness of short-lived 131I fallout.215 Within the 30 km zone from the Chernobyl NPP, employing the AMS technique, Sahoo et al.216 measured 129I/127I atom ratios in soil that ranged from 1.4 × 10−6 to 13 × 10−6, and Michel et al.49 reported a geometric mean of 2.7 × 10−7 in top soils collected from the Ukraine (outside the 30 km zone), Belarus and Russia in 1991–1992. The experience obtained in studying the Chernobyl accident has been applied to reconstruct the 131I distribution and dose estimation for the Fukushima accident, using ICP-MS and AMS for 129I analysis (see Section 3.6).3.5 The JCO criticality accidentThe JCO criticality accident occurred on 30 September 1999 in Tokai-mura and continued for about 20 hours. JCO, a nuclear fuel recycle company, converted enriched UF6 to UO2 for use in nuclear fuel. To avoid a self-sustaining chain reaction, that is criticality, it is necessary that too large amounts of enriched uranium are not handled. However, an accident occurred due to human error with the following scenario. The enriched uranium in U3O8 powder containing 18.8% of 235U was dissolved in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate solution. With this 235U concentration, the permitted handling amount was set as 2.4 kg to avoid criticality (6 kg was the point at which criticality would occur). It was necessary to dissolve more U3O8 powder to produce uniform products; for the permitted U handling amount, mixing the uranyl nitrate solution several times was required. To shorten the procedure, workers dissolved 16.6 kg of the uranium powder in nitric acid in a reaction vessel. This handling error caused the criticality accident. Details of initial environmental studies have been published in a special issue of the J. Environ. Radioact., 50(1–2). Here the ICP-MS studies for U isotope ratio analysis after the JCO criticality accident are reviewed.At the time of the accident, emissions of neutron and fission products were a concern; however, it was also necessary to estimate the potential U release to the environment from the JCO facility. Since enriched 235U had been used at the site, it was assumed that 235U abundance in the soil surface near the site would not be at the natural ratio (0.72%). If the contamination was extensive, then the total U concentration measurement would also be applicable; however, for the JCO criticality accident, the observed U concentrations near the accident site were within the range of the generally observed level in natural soils, that is, 0.7–2.9 mg per kg dry.217 As a reference, U concentrations in agricultural fields in Japan range from 1.0–4.7 mg per kg dry.218,219 Thus it was difficult to identify the U source by measuring total U. However, analysis of 235U/238U atom ratios in soils near the site would provide information on the environmental impact from the JCO building.Tanaka et al.220 applied a selective extraction with 2 mol L−1 nitric acid for 2 h at 120 °C for soil samples to extract additional U (not total U) from the sample and found the enriched 235U/238U ratio ranged from 0.00896 to 0.01196 while that in the natural ratio is 0.00725. Yoshida et al.221 measured soil core samples collected on the JCO grounds; they applied total dissolution using a microwave digestion system. The highest 235U/238U ratio was 0.0262, and vertical profiles of the ratio were higher than the natural ratio at depths of several cm (depending on the samples). The percentages of 235U in excess U, estimated from the positive correlation between U concentration and the 235U/238U ratio in soil samples, were less than 4% by mass and were much lower than the enrichment of the U used in the uranium conversion building at the time of the criticality accident (18.8%). These findings indicated that enriched U had been released before the criticality accident during the U processing at JCO in connection with the reconversion of light water reactor fuel.Since the range of the U concentrations found was comparable to the range of uncontaminated Japanese surface soils, the amount of U added to the soil was judged negligible from a radiation protection viewpoint. In addition, to characterize airborne U contamination, plant samples were measured. In tree bark samples collected in Tokai-mura, the maximum 235U/238U ratio was 0.0148,222 while that in weeds was 0.018.217 Besides the higher 235U/238U atom ratios, Yamamoto et al.223 also observed an unusually high 234U/238U activity ratio, 5.7, in soil collected in the vicinity of the uranium conversion building.Although ICP-MS is recognized worldwide as a powerful tool to identify the U source by measuring the isotope ratio in a very short time period, and was used after the JCO criticality accident, the Palomares accident in Spain224 and the Chernobyl accident,225 unfortunately, isotope ratio measurements, such as 235U/238U, 129I/127I, and 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios, have not been included in the official radiation measurement method series no. 15, 26, and 28 published by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT),226 only the total U measurement by ICP-MS was recommended.3.6 The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011On 11 March, 2011, a catastrophic earthquake (M 9.0, the world's fifth largest since modern records were began around 1900) followed by gigantic tsunami caused serious damage to the electric systems of the FDNPP. The FDNPP consisted of six boiling water reactor units. The failure of the cooling systems of the nuclear reactors resulted in hydrogen gas generation and buildup, and subsequent explosions in the reactor buildings of Units 1 and 3 on 12 and 14 March, respectively. On 15 March, other explosions happened in the fourth floor of Unit 4 reactor building (where the largest spent fuel pool was located) and in Unit 2, which resulted in the breach of the Unit 2 containment vessel. Among the four damaged reactor units (Units 1 to 4), three reactors (Units 1 to 3) were in operation at the time of the earthquake which triggered the nuclear accident. Unit 4 had been shut down since 30 November, 2010, and all of its nuclear fuel had been removed and was being stored in its spent fuel pool. Due to the hydrogen explosions and venting actions by operators, large amounts of radionuclides were released into the atmosphere.227 For example, for 137Cs, the total emission was estimated to be in the range of 13–35.8 PBq.228,229 In addition to the atmospheric releases, the cooling of the reactors with fresh water and seawater, and the release of highly contaminated water from the damaged reactor buildings resulted in the direct discharges of radionuclides into the sea.230–232 The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency of Japan (NISA) set a level 7 of international nuclear and radiological event scale for the FDNPP accident, the same level rating as the Chernobyl accident in 1986.Since the FDNPP accident, γ ray emission fission products, such as 134Cs, 137Cs, and 131I have been analyzed using γ-ray spectrometry in environmental and food samples to estimate the contamination range and to prevent internal radiation exposure resulting from ingestion of contaminated food. Atomic spectrometric techniques, especially ICP-MS and AMS have played important roles in the study of possible spread of nuclear fuel radionuclides U and Pu in the environment. Takagai et al.233 developed a new method for radiation measurement that uses microwave digestion for isotope ratio analysis of 235U and 238U in soil samples with Elan DRC II ICP-MS. In order to detect the accident-sourced 235U, the dissolution of natural uranium in silicate rocks was reduced by using a nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide mixture. By ICP-MS analysis, the isotope ratio of U of the certified geochemical reference material was obtained to precisely correct the isotope ratio in actual soil samples. In addition, cell-pass voltages were used to make calibrations and to correct the mass bias in the mass spectrometer. This new method makes it possible to measure the isotopic ratio of uranium with an accuracy of 0.37% without using a radioactive U standard source, thus it can be used in laboratories without getting a license to handle and use nuclear fuel uranium standard solutions. In the case of an emergency, like the FDNPP accident, this new method is useful to immediately make faster measurements over a large contaminated area as compared with current practices such as a complicated dissolution process followed by α-ray spectrometry measurements.This new analytical method was used for a survey of possible uranium spreading at 115 soil sampling sites from 7 to 80 km northwest of the FDNPP, where heavy deposition of radioactive Cs isotopes has been observed.233 The values of the uranium isotope ratio for those soils were mostly similar to the naturally occurring levels, indicating no significant uranium contamination in the investigated area. However, since the accident, food safety has been an increasing public concern; the Japanese government has set a provisional regulation value of 100 Bq kg−1 for uranium in vegetables.234 Since large amounts of radionuclides were released in the FDNPP accident, it has been necessary to measure U concentration in fresh foods, e.g., vegetables. However, isotope ratio measurements, such as 235U/238U, and 240Pu/229Pu atom ratios, have not been included in the radiation measurement method series published by MEXT;228 ICP-MS was only recommended for total U measurement. In addition, the MEXT method takes a long time (several days) and needs large amounts of vegetable samples (500 g raw), thus, Zheng et al.235 proposed a simpler and more rapid analysis of U, which is capable of determining the 235U/238U isotope ratio at the several tens pg g−1 concentration level in vegetables using a sector-field ICP-MS, to identify the U source term in them. Nitric acid–hydrogen peroxide digestion is followed by rapid SF-ICP-MS measurement; the concentration of 238U and the 235U/238U isotope ratio in a 10 g fresh vegetable sample can be obtained within 3 h of receipt of the sample. The developed method was applied to the emergency monitoring of U contamination in April and May 2011, and no U contamination was found in vegetables collected from Ibaraki and Chiba prefectures.A more sensitive fingerprint of environmental U contamination,236,237236U, which is mainly induced by the nuclear reaction 235U(n,γ) with thermal neutrons in reactors which use 235U fuel, was also measured using AMS in environmental waters (river water and seawater) from Fukushima Prefecture following the FDNPP accident.238 For river water samples, the 236U/238U atom ratio was in the range 2.57–8.20 × 10−9 and the concentration of 236U was in the range 0.82–4.48 × 105 atoms per kg. No typical global fallout value for the 236U/238U atom ratio and the 236U concentrations in Japanese rivers have been identified so far; however, the observed U isotope ratios and 236U concentrations are much smaller than those of Austrian river water samples which were likely contaminated with global fallout and Chernobyl accident fallout.239 For surface seawater samples collected in the Pacific 30 km from the FDNPP, the estimated concentration of 236U and the 236U/238U atom ratio were about 0.35 × 107 atoms per kg and 0.60 × 10−9, respectively. These values were less than half the values in surface seawater samples from the Japan Sea, which were measured before the FDNPP accident, suggesting a relatively low potential for U contamination as a result of the accident.Although U contamination in the environment was not observed after the FDNPP accident, atmospheric release and deposition of plutonium isotopes on the ground was observed northwest and south of the FDNPP in the 20–30 km zone. Using an established highly sensitive APEX-SF-ICP-MS analytical system,84 Zheng et al.240 analyzed Pu isotopic composition (atom ratios of 240Pu/239Pu and 241Pu/239Pu, and activity ratio of 241Pu/239+240Pu) in surface soil and litter samples collected in Fukushima Prefecture and adjacent prefectures. For the samples collected in Fukushima Prefecture, activities of 239+240Pu ranged from 0.019 to 1.400 mBq g−1, and were within the typical global fallout 239+240Pu activity range of 0.15 to 4.31 mBq g−1 observed in Japanese soils before the Fukushima DNPP accident.204 However, high activities of 241Pu ranging from 4.52 to 34.8 mBq g−1 were detected in surface soil 20 km south of the FDNPP and in litter samples 20–30 km northwest of the FDNPP. 241Pu was released into the environment through atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the last century. Due to its short half-life of 14.4 years, the activity of 241Pu in Japanese soils is quite low (ca. 1.2 for 241Pu/239+240Pu activity ratio, 241Pu decay corrected to 15 March 2011). Therefore, the finding of high 241Pu activities in these samples suggested an additional Pu input. The 240Pu/239Pu and 241Pu/239Pu atom ratios found in these samples ranged from 0.303 to 0.330 and from 0.103 to 0.135, respectively. They were significantly higher than those of global fallout (0.180 ± 0.007, for 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio, and 0.00194 ± 0.00014, for 241Pu/239Pu atom ratio)16 and the atmospheric fallout deposition in Japan from 1963 to 1979 (0.1922 ± 0.0044, for 240Pu/239Pu atom ratio, and 0.00287 ± 0.00056, for 241Pu/239Pu atom ratio),203 providing isotopic evidence for the release of Pu from the Fukushima DNPP accident.The FDNPP accident-sourced Pu isotopic fingerprint obtained in the environmental samples and Pu isotopic composition of other Pu contamination sources in Japanese environment are summarized in Table 4. 241Pu is a beta-emitting isotope, as a result of 241Pu decay the increase of 241Am may significantly enhance the alpha-activity level in the contaminated area for a certain period of time. As a high value of the 241Pu/239+240Pu activity ratio was found for the Fukushima-derived Pu (107.8), a prediction on the ingrowth of 241Am was made. The prediction was that the 241Am/239+240Pu activity ratio would increase quickly to reach a maximum value of 3.12 in the year 2081, followed by a gradual decrease. This expected maximum value is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of the expected global fallout 241Am/239+240Pu in the year 2042. Furthermore, the increased amount of 241Am may remain in the surface soil for decades together with Pu isotopes, as was demonstrated in a study on the migration of 241Am and Pu released from the atomic bomb detonation in Nagasaki.158 After the FDNPP accident, MEXT estimated the 239+240Pu dose from external exposure and inhalation from resuspension as 0.12 mSv for a person living for 50 years in the contaminated area.243 The additional dose contribution from 241Pu has to be estimated since the 241Pu/239+240Pu activity ratio of the Fukushima-derived Pu was found to be higher than 100. Using the method of IAEA-TECDOC-955, the 241Pu dose for a person living for 50 years in the contaminated area site was estimated to be 0.44 mSv, about 4 times the 239+240Pu dose. Therefore, it is highly necessary to investigate the distribution and surface activity of 241Pu inside the 20 km zone, where much higher 241Pu concentration could be expected. This is important for the long-term dose assessment of actinides, and will have important implications in the strategy for decontamination procedures.

Studies on the activity of Pu isotopes and their isotopic composition (atom ratios of 240Pu/239Pu and 241Pu/239Pu) in marine sediments in the Pacific Ocean 30 km off the Fukushima Prefecture coast from July 2011 to July 2012 showed that the Pu activities and the Pu atom ratios were comparable to the baseline data before the FDNPP accident,184,185 suggesting that the accident did not cause detectable Pu contamination in the investigated region. This conclusion was further supported by the analysis of Pu isotopes in surface seawater samples using AMS.238In addition to the determination of radionuclides related to the reactor fuel burn-up in the environment, atomic spectrometric techniques also found an important application in the studies on fission products released into the environment after the FDNPP accident. Large amounts of radioactive Te were released into the environment due to the FDNPP accident.244 Following a study on the 132Te distribution in Fukushima Prefecture for reconstruction of early internal dose,245 it was realized that 127mTe, a beta emitter, may have posed a potential risk for internal radiation exposure via crop ingestion caused by the soil-to-plant transfer of deposited 127mTe because of its relatively long half-life (t1/2 = 109 days). To estimate the internal radiation dose, data of soil-to-plant transfer factor (TF) of Te are requisite. However, data on TF of radioactive Te are quite limited. Yang et al.246 proposed the approach of using stable Te as an analog for radioactive Te, and developed a rapid and sensitive SF-ICP-MS based analytical method for the determination of Te in soil and plant samples. For the first time, data of Te TF in potato, carrot leaf, Japanese radish and lettuce, among the most commonly consumed vegetables in the Japanese diet were obtained for dose estimation.It should be noted that due to the FDNPP accident, a large amount of 131I was released. 131I has a short half-life of 8.02 days; very limited data on 131I analysis are available and it is not possible to measure the concentration now. Based on the experience after the Chernobyl accident, reconstruction of the dose from 131I in March 2011 for the residents living near the power plant site was done using 129I concentration data. It was found that concentrations of 131I and 129I were well correlated and the calculated atom ratio of 129I/131I was 31.6 from the FDNPP accident.247 The determination of 129I in surface soil samples has been carried out now by AMS as well as ICP-MS.54,247 In order to reconstruct the 131I distribution in Fukushima Prefecture using 129I, the 129I/127I atom ratio has to be measured as it is a good indicator to identify the source term of 129I. Measurement of 129I/127I by ICP-MS is limited to ca. 10−6 level;109 however, in the natural environment, 129I/127I atom ratio in the pre-nuclear era was 3 × 10−13 to 3 × 10−12 in the hydrosphere, and that could increase to levels of 10−10 to 10−4 due to the radioactive contamination in the environment.47,48 Typically, quadrupole type ICP-MS with a reaction cell can measure the 129I/127I ratio to the 10−7 level with O2 as a reaction gas to suppress the interference of 129Xe;54 this is not sufficient to measure the background level of the 129I/127I atom ratio in Japanese soils which ranges from 3.9 × 10−11 to 2.2 × 10−8, so that it would be difficult to obtain the excess amount of 129I originating from the FDNPP accident (Fig. 4). Recently developed triple quadrupole ICP-MS (ICP-QQQ) can make measurements to the 1 × 10−8 level,55 which would allow the 129I/127I ratio to be obtained for surface soil samples collected near the FDNPP site; if the FDNPP accident resulted in the 129I/127I ratio being more than 2.2 × 10−8, the FDNPP accident-sourced 129I can be unambiguously differentiated from the background and accurately quantified for the reconstruction of 131I radiation dose. Fig. 4  129I/127I atom ratios in surface soils collected in Fukushima Prefecture plotted against distance. 4 Advanced research on radionuclide behaviors in the environmentPeaceful uses of nuclear technologies, such as radiopharmaceuticals, industrial uses (e.g. nondestructive inspection, crop breeding etc.), and nuclear energy, support modern society. Nuclear reactors are one of the largest electrical energy generation sources, and this technology has been used as a countermeasure to global warming. Several long-lived radionuclides are produced in the fissions of 235U and 239Pu in nuclear fuel, such as 79Se (2.95 × 105 years), 93Zr (1.53 × 105 years), 99Tc (2.1 × 105 years), 129I (1.57 × 107 years), 135Cs (2.3 × 106 years), 230Th (7.54 × 104 years) etc., and also from irradiation of structural and component materials used in the power plant, such as 14C (5.7 × 105 years), consequently, these radionuclides accumulate during the plant operation. After the operation, spent nuclear fuels or high level radioactive wastes after recycle of the fuel, have to be disposed safely. A practical way for radioactive wastes disposal is to keep them in a deep underground facility which is geologically stable. However, because of their long half-lives, it is necessary to consider the fate of these radionuclides in the environment since the disposal facilities will deteriorate in the far future, e.g. 100000 years,249 and then, these long-lived radionuclides will reach the surface environment, that is, the biosphere.Mathematical models have been employed to calculate the dose to humans after radioactive waste disposal. In these models, environmental transfer parameters have been used, e.g., soil-to-plant transfer factors and seawater-to-seafood transfer factors; however, it is difficult to obtain all the necessary data for the target radionuclides. Instead, the use of a corresponding stable element as an analogue of the long-lived radionuclides is a useful method. Indeed, the recently published handbook of environmental transfer parameter values compiled by IAEA250 pointed out that the use of isotopes of the same element provides identical results. However, the stable isotopes are sometimes present only at trace levels, and this requires highly sensitive atomic spectrometric techniques. For example, 79Se has stable Se isotopes, however, their concentrations in the environmental samples are quite low;25199Tc has no stable isotope but since the chemical behavior of Re is close to that of Tc, Re can be used as an analogue, but Re concentration data in the environment is also scarce.251,252Development of measurement techniques for trace analogous elements has been carried out using ICP-MS; Re in soil, plants and seawater,253–257 iodine in water, soil, plants, marine biota and marine sediments,258–261 Cs and Th in seawater262,263 are examples. In order to understand 14C fate in soil–water systems, stable 13C analysis was also employed.264 It is also useful to obtain the environmental transfer parameter data of other stable elements because related/same group elements to the target radionuclides can be used as surrogates, and the fates of major elements will affect that the fates of trace elements/radionuclides. Thus, potentially measurable elements need to be considered in future research work.Environmental transfer parameters have been obtained by various atomic spectrometric methods and are extensively reported.218,219,261,265–269 These parameter values can add more data about the long-lived radionuclides of interest and can support more precise dose estimation. There are some elements that are difficult to measure or that have no corresponding stable isotopes, e.g., Pu, Am and Np. Further studies are needed which consider these radionuclides.5 Microbeam elemental analysis for radiation protection studiesElemental profiles and distribution in tissues and organs are valuable data for the studies of human radiation protection. The information about the cell- and site-specific distributions of elements (inhomogeneous distributions) and the shift in the balance of essential elements after environmental stimuli is helpful to provide reliable internal dose estimation of from ingested or inhaled radionuclides. Microbeam-based elemental analyses, such as micro-PIXE and SR-XRF, and SIMS are powerful techniques for these studies. Microbeam scanning of tissue specimens provides the two-dimensional distributions of elements in tissues. Elemental profiles of the fine structure of tissues and cells are also obtained by irradiation of a microbeam onto the aimed site (spot analysis).270–272 During micro-PIXE analysis, scanning transmission ion microscopy (STIM) images are obtained simultaneously in addition to the elemental maps. Thus, it is easy to relate the elemental maps to the fine structure of tissues. The cell-specific distributions of elements have been demonstrated in rat kidney, testis and pancreas by micro-PIXE analysis.273–275 It has been also demonstrated that environmental stimuli, such as X-ray radiation and organotin compounds, resulted in site-specific changes in elemental levels in tissues.270,271,276 The microbeam techniques also have been applied to determine precise distributions of internally present radionuclides with chemical toxicity, such as uranium, in tissues and cultured cells and the findings are changing our understanding of radionuclide toxicity. Here, some of these studies are reviewed and new perspectives for radiation protection of internal radionuclides are discussed.5.1 Toxicological studies of uraniumRenal toxicity is the major health effect from U exposure. U-induced renal toxicity is characterized by damage to the S3 segment of the proximal tubules, which are distributed in the inner cortex and the outer stripe of the outer medulla.277,278 But the relationship between U accumulation and toxic effects is not well understood, due to difficulty in determining radioactive U concentration at trace levels in tissues. Further, it has not been clarified whether or not U needs to penetrate the cells to exert its toxic effects. Some authors have proposed that alterations in solute transport via binding of U to certain components of the cell membrane may trigger the induction of cellular toxicity.279,280 In contrast, others have proposed that U does enter cells to cause toxic effects,281 including induction of oxidative stress.282SR-XRF with high energy incident X-rays was used to reveal the precise distribution of U in kidney.283,284 U site-specifically accumulates in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules, where it causes apoptosis and renal lesions (Fig. 5). In the proximal tubules, U was found in the epithelium, but not in the brush border of the proximal tubules, indicating that U could be taken up into the epithelium of the proximal tubules and cause renal toxicity. During recovery after acute renal tubular lesion, areas of high U concentration were still present in the proximal tubules; there were sites with local maximum concentrations of U of more than 280-fold enrichment compared with the mean renal U concentration.284 Microbeam based mass spectrometry is also a powerful technique to detect high mass number elements, such as U, at trace levels in tissues. Highly concentrated U in the epithelium of the proximal tubules was also observed by SIMS in rats after chronic exposure to U.143 An LA-ICP-MS study for human tissues also demonstrated the inhomogeneous distributions of 232Th and 238U, presumably from chronic natural background inhalation, in lung tissues.141 Fig. 5  Uranium distribution and tissue morphology in rat kidneys at 3 days after uranium acetate administration (0.5 mg kg−1). Representative examples of TUNEL staining and uranium imaging are shown in (A) and (C), respectively. (A) Apoptotic cells were detected using TUNEL staining. Allows denote TUNEL-positive tubules. (B) Illustration of renal structure corresponded to the areas of (A) and (C). G, glomeruli; S1, S1 segment; S2, S2 segment; S3, S3 segment of the proximal tubules. (C): uranium imaging by SR-XRF with high-energy incident X-rays (beam size 1 μm × 1 μm, 26 × 51 steps, 40 μm per step). The elemental map is shown as tones ranging from black to white, classified into 256 degrees from 10 μg g−1 (the lower detection limit) up to the maximum concentration in linear proportion to element concentration. The uranium concentration range was calculated using thin-section standards.285–287 The periphery of the renal cortex is shown on the upper side. Uranium was localized to the inner cortex and the outer stripes of the outer medulla, where TUNEL-positive tubules were also observed. Uranium is an α-particle radionuclide. Depending on the amounts of U in the concentrated areas, the toxic effects caused by a local dose of the concentrated U could be considerable for U toxicity. Toxicological implication of the concentrated U in the tissues should be addressed to understand the U toxicity, which is responsible for both chemical and radiological toxicity.The in vitro studies with cultured cells showed that precipitates of U were found within the cytoplasmic compartment as uranyl phosphate needles after exposure to U at a toxic concentration.281,288 Recent study by SIMS revealed not only U concentrated areas in nucleus but also a soluble form of U in cytoplasmic compartment in cultured cells.142 Micro-XAFS is expected to provide information on the chemical form of uranium distributed in the cellular compartment for a better understanding of the mechanism of U toxicity.6 Future research perspectivesAtomic spectrometric techniques have found wide applications in radiation protection studies regarding the source identification of radioactive contamination in the environment, environmental behavior of radionuclides, soil-to-plant transfer of important actinides and long-lived fission products related to radioactive waste geological disposal for long-term safety assessment, and radiation dose estimation. Due to the desirable analytical characteristics, such as high sensitivity, good accuracy, rapidness, and the capability of providing isotope ratio analysis, atomic spectrometric techniques are expected to play an irreplaceable role in radiation protection studies following the FDNPP accident. First, sensitive analysis of naturally occurring radioactive materials U, Th, 210Pb and 226Ra, are needed to obtain the radiation dose contribution from the natural radiation background, which is important for accurate dose estimations for the accident-derived radionuclides. Second, 99Tc, 241Am, 237Np, 135Cs, 90Sr and Cm isotopes etc., have been released into the environment from the FDNPP accident, however, due to the difficulties of analysis, almost no information on their distributions in the environment and their source terms are available. Atomic spectrometric techniques are the most promising choice for the analysis of these Fukushima-sourced radionuclides by which the necessary information can be obtained. Third, there are increasing demands in the scientific community and from the general public to understand the release mechanism of actinides, especially Pu isotopes which is important to understand the accident process. To this end, development of a highly sensitive atomic spectrometric technique for single particle isotope ratio analysis is highly desirable. Finally, atomic spectrometric techniques, especially, ICP-MS are an ideal technique for long-term monitoring of radioactive contamination in the marine environment; such monitoring is needed to strengthen public confidence in seafood safety.For the estimation of internal radiation effects, mass spectrometric analytical techniques are desirable for the determination of actinides and 90Sr in bioassay samples. In addition, microbeam based spectrometry provides site-specific distributions (inhomogeneous distributions) of elements in tissues. The site-specificity differs among congeners.274 It also varies depending on tissue development.275,289 Microbeam analysis is also used for environmental sciences; the site-specific elemental profiles are valuable for environmental monitoring.290–292 The non-destructive analysis with microbeams, such as SR-XRF and micro-PIXE allows the elemental distributions to be related to histopathological information. Radiation effects research which considered the inhomogeneous distributions at the cellular level is desirable for accurate radiation protection for humans.AbbreviationsAMSAccelerator mass spectrometryCC-ICP-MSCollision cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryDRC-ICP-MSDynamic reaction cell inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryETV-ICP-QMSElectrothermal vaporization inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometryGDMSGlow discharge mass spectrometryHR-ICP-MSHigh resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryICP-CC-QMSQuadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with hexapole collision cellICP-ORS-QMSInductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometer with an octopole reaction systemICP-QQQAgilent 8800 triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryID-ICP-MSIsotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryLA-ICP-QMSLaser ablation microprobe inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometryLA-ICP-MSLaser ablation microprobe inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryLSCLiquid scintillation countingMC-ICP-MSMulticollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryPIXEProton induced X-ray emissionQ-ICP-MSQuadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryRIMSResonance ionization mass spectrometryRNAARadiochemical neutron activation analysisSF-ICP-MSSector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometrySIMSSecondary ion mass spectrometrySR-XRFSynchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectrometrySTIMScanning transmission ion microscopyTIMSThermal ionization mass spectrometryXAFSX-ray absorption fine structureAcknowledgementsThe authors thank Dr S.
