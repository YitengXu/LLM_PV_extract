    , Accepted 27th June 2020First published on 29th June 2020AbstractWe report the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion (UC) through triplet energy transfer (TET) from a sensitiser fixed on a solid surface to free emitters dissolved in solution. A carboxylic-acid derivative of Pt–porphyrin was used as the sensitiser fixed on an amino-treated surface of continuous nanoporous glass without aggregation. UC emission was observed under photoexcitation of 532 nm for porphyrin-fixed glass immersed in an emitter solution of 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA), showing that TET occurs through the solid–liquid interface. The dynamics of TET was analysed through both phosphorescence decay of the sensitiser and UC emission rise from the emitter. Two TET components with different rate constants were found, slower than diffusion-controlled reactions in solution by 1–2 orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, the solid surface TET rates were fast enough to obtain a high quantum yield over the solid–liquid interface. By melting DPA and soaking it into sensitiser-fixed porous glass, we fabricated an all-solid system enabling TTA-UC through the bulk interface.
Introduction
Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) is a phenomenon that converts two lower-energy photons into a higher-energy photon at incident light intensity as low as that of sunlight.1–7 TTA-UC has attracted attention for its potential to improve overall conversion efficiency in applications including solar cells8,9 and photocatalysts.10,11 While TTA-UC in a solid medium would be preferable for such applications, typical TTA-UC operates in solutions containing a mixture of sensitiser and emitter molecules.1 Considerable efforts have been devoted to developing solid materials for TTA-UC such as polymers12–14 and gels.15,16 However, the efficiency of triplet–triplet energy transfer (TET) from sensitiser to emitter molecules for these materials have been generally lower than those for solutions because of the limitation of molecular diffusion of component molecules in a viscous medium. This problem can be overcome by using dense-chromophore media such as chromophore liquids17 and deposited films,18,19 where triplet exciton migration plays the role of transferring triplet energy between molecules in place of molecular diffusion. However, the problem of using dense-chromophore media is the aggregation of sensitisers, which hinders TET.
Methods developed to date to prevent aggregation include rapid-drying casting,20 where emitter molecules (matrix) are crystallised before the sensitiser (dopant) aggregates, and self-assembled molecular systems.21 Another novel approach involves the fixing of sensitiser molecules on the solid surface in monomeric fashion. Such a system was demonstrated through porphyrin derivatives fixed on the surfaces of clay nanosheets22 and nanoporous glass.23 The latter is suitable for device applications as nanopores form a continuous 3D-network thus allowing the active layer to be optically thick at around several hundreds of micrometres. Pt–porphyrin derivatives fixed on 3D-nanopores are known to have a phosphorescence quantum yield (QY) higher than that in solution.23 Hence aggregation and nonradiative deactivation is suppressed by fixing molecules on a nanopore surface, and porphyrin-fixed nanoporous glass is a suitable candidate for the sensitiser component of TTA-UC.
Using this approach, we demonstrate TTA-UC by producing a sensitiser-fixed nanoporous glass and immersing it in an emitter solution (Fig. 1). UC emission from the solid–liquid hybrid system was successfully observed and the UC-QY and emission dynamics were studied in detail. In this hybrid system, TET occurs through the solid–liquid interface, from a sensitiser fixed on a solid surface to an emitter moving in solution. At the solid–liquid interface, the dynamics are considered to differ from a conventional solution system since the TET rate constants between the TiO2 particle and DPA molecule fixed to it were reported to be lower than those in the solution system.24 Dynamics of TET via the solid–liquid interface were studied by observing the time profiles of sensitiser phosphorescence and UC emission. The results showed that the TET had two components with different rate constants. This implies that there are two types of sensitiser molecules on the surfaces. The rate constants were found to be one or two orders of magnitudes smaller than that of the solution containing the sensitiser and the emitter molecules. Nevertheless, the TET-QY of the solid–liquid interface (0.97) was comparable to solution, showing that suppressing the nonradiative process plays an important role for efficient TET across the solid–liquid interface. Moreover, an all-solid TTA-UC system was also demonstrated by filling PtCP-fixed nanopores with solid-state DPA.

Experimental
Chemicals and sample preparation
Pt(II) octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP, Sigma-Aldrich), Pt(II) coproporphyrin I (PtCP, Frontier Scientific C40425), a tetracarboxylic-acid derivative of PtOEP, and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA, Tokyo Chemical Industry) were used without further purification (Fig. 1). PtCP was fixed on an amino-terminated surface of glass nanopores (pore diameter of 55.6 nm) by ion exchange.22 The loading concentration of the PtCP-fixed porous glass was calculated from the absorption spectrum. A piece of the glass immersed in toluene solution of DPA or neat toluene filling a 5 mm quartz cell was used as a sample for spectroscopic studies. The samples were deoxygenated by Ar (99.99%+)-bubbling before use. The concentration of DPA solution was set 100 times higher than the loading concentration of PtCP, e.g. the typical concentration was 18 mM for a loading concentration of 180 μM for PtCP. The concentrations of the samples used are indicated thereinafter.
Steady-state spectroscopies
UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV3150 spectrophotometer. Upconversion emission spectra were measured with a custom setup. A continuous wave (cw) diode laser (532 nm, output power 4.5 mW, beam diameter 3.8 mm) was used as the excitation source. The beam was focused by a 270 mm planoconvex lens, resulting in an intensity of 13 W cm−2 at the sample position where the beam diameter was 53 μm and irradiation power was 0.30 mW. The irradiation power was adjusted by a variable neutral density filter. The emission was collected and then detected by a fibre spectrometer (Ocean Optics, USB2000-FLG) through an OD 4 notch filter (Edmund Optics).
Upconversion quantum yield (ΦUC) measurement
An absolute photoluminescence quantum yield spectrometer with a calibrated integrating sphere (Hamamatsu Photonics, Quantaurus-QY Plus C13534) was used as the scattering by porous glass was non-negligible. A cw green laser (Coherent Verdi, 532 nm) was used as the external light source. The beam was focused by a built-in lens and produced a beam diameter of 0.13 mm at the sample position (measured by a CCD camera). The excitation power at the sample position was 20 mW or less, which was varied by a neutral density filter. To obtain correct ΦUC, self-absorption correction (see ESI† for derails) was applied.25 In this paper, we use a definition of ΦUC = 100% for the full conversion where two incident photons are converted to an upconverted photon.
Time-resolved emission measurements
A frequency-doubled nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser (532 nm, pulse width 10 ns, 10–15 Hz) was used as the light source. The incident pulse energy was 2.1 μJ for UC emission measurement (corresponding to the peak power of 1.7 kW cm−2 from a beam diameter of 4 mm at the sample position and the pulse width) or noted otherwise. The emission from the sample was collected in the orthogonal direction by a lens and guided to a monochromator (Jobin-Yvon H-10) through the OD 4 notch filter. The signal was detected by a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R936) and recorded by a digital oscilloscope (500 MHz, 5 Gs s−1). All the optical measurements were performed at 23 °C.
Fabrication of all-solid TTA-UC system
DPA powder was placed on a piece of 250 μM PtCP-fixed glass and heated at 245 °C under vacuum for 0.5 h. At this temperature the DPA melted and infiltrated into the nanopores of the glass. After cooling down to 23 °C, the sample was exposed to THF vapour in a vial for 14 h for vapour annealing. The nanopores of the glass were filled with solid DPA, which was confirmed by fluorescence imaging of a cleft nanoporous glass cross section. The emission spectra were measured using the same method for the steady-state spectroscopies described above.
Theoretical basis
Dynamics of the triple–triplet energy transfer
For deeper understanding of the TET process, we investigated the phosphorescence decay of the sensitiser and corresponding rise of UC emission. Here we briefly summarise the theoretical basis of the analysis.
In TTA-UC, the coupled rate equations for the triplet sensitisers (3S*), triplet emitter (3E*) and singlet emitter (1E*) can be written as, d[3S*]/dt = −(k3S + kTET[1E]0)[3S*](1) d[3E*]/dt = kTET[1E]0[3S*] − k3E[3E*] − 2kTTA[3E*]2(2) d[1E*]/dt = φkTTA[3E*]2 − k1E[1E*](3)where [] indicates molar concentration. k3S, k3E, k1E are the first-order rate constants for unimolecular deexcitation of 3S*, 3E*, 1E* respectively and kTET, kTTA, are the second-order rate constants for TET and TTA. [1E]0 is the initial concentration of the emitter and its change during the excitation is neglected. The singlet generation ratio of TTA process is expressed here by φ. The time profiles of the phosphorescence of the sensitiser and UC emission are, respectively, Iph(t) ∝ [3S*](4)and IUC(t) ∝ [1E*] ∝ [3E*]2.(5)

Eqn (5) is obtained from (6)which is derived from eqn (3) under the quasi-steady state assumption d[1E*]/dt ≈ 0 where the process was governed by the slow generation of 1E* through TTA.
For impulsive excitation eqn (1) and (2) give the single exponential decay (7)and the exponential rise and decay when TTA can be omitted (8)where (9)is the phosphorescence lifetime of the sensitiser with emitter. Thus, from eqn (4) and (7), Iph(t) can be expressed through exponential decay as, (10)while, from eqn (5) and (8), IUC(t) can be expressed as, (11)As discussed below, there are the cases where the decay of phosphorescence and the rise of UC emission cannot be expressed through a single exponential function. Hence, two TET paths (A and B) were phenomenologically introduced. In addition, for the IUC(t) data where TTA of the emitter cannot be omitted, curve fitting with the numerical solution of eqn (1)–(5) was performed using the following coupled differential equations for the i-th iteration with time step Δt: [3SA*](ti) = [3SA*](ti−1) − τ3SA−1[3SA*](ti−1)Δt(12) [3SB*](ti) = [3SB*](ti−1) − τ3SB−1[3SB*](ti−1)Δt(13) [3E*](ti) = [3E*](ti−1) + [τ3SA−1[3SA*](ti−1) + τ3SB−1[3SB*](ti−1) − k3E[3E*](ti−1) − 2kTTA{[3E*](ti−1)}2]Δt(14)where we assume two sensitiser triplets 3SA*, 3SB* with different lifetimes τ3SA, τ3SB, respectively. A deconvolution procedure was also applied for curve-fitting if necessary.
Results and discussion
Steady-state upconversion emission and spectra
Through 532 nm green light excitation, clear blue emission was observed for the PtCP-fixed nanoporous glass placed in the centre of a quartz cell filled with deaerated DPA solution (Fig. 2(a)). The peak wavelength (435 nm) and the spectral shape of the blue emission were almost the same as for DPA fluorescence (Fig. 2(a)). No blue emission was observed for the nanoporous glass without PtCP. From these results, it was shown that UC phenomenon successfully took place via the solid–liquid interface (i.e. from PtCP-fixed on glass to DPA dissolved in solution).

PtCP and DPA concentrations are 180 μM and 18 mM, respectively. Upconverted blue light (ca. 435 nm) derived from DPA molecules was observed. (b) Emission spectra of the PtCP-fixed glass (loading concentration: 66 μM) immersed in neat toluene (red) and in DPA/toluene (9.3 mM) solution (blue) both irradiated at 532 nm. The excitation intensity was 13 W cm−2. 
The emission spectrum also showed monomer and dimer phosphorescence peaks of PtCP centred at 647 and 780 nm, respectively (Fig. 2(b), blue). In contrast, only the monomer phosphorescence peak was observed for the PtCP-fixed nanoporous glass in neat toluene, i.e. without DPA, under the same excitation conditions (Fig. 2(b), red). Detailed comparison of peak intensity showed that the monomer peak was 200 times stronger than the dimer peak (see ESI†), suggesting that most PtCP molecules were fixed in a monomeric manner. With the DPA solution, while the monomer peak was quenched through TET but the dimer peak was not since the triplet level of the dimer is too low to transfer the energy to the DPA triplet. Consequently, the dimer peak remained prominent as seen in blue in Fig. 2(b).
Upconversion quantum yield

Φ
UC is an important factor for characterising TTA-UC systems. In Fig. 3, the values of ΦUC for the PtCP-fixed glass in DPA solution are shown for various excitation intensities. The ΦUC values were near saturated and gave an average value of 14% for the excitation intensity range. This value was comparable to that obtained for the solution sample containing PtOEP and DPA (18%).

The concentrations of PtCP (PtOEP) and DPA were 180 μM (180 μM) and 18 mM, respectively. 

Φ
UC can be factorised into elementary processes as follows: ΦUC = ΦISCΦTETΦTTAΦFL(15)where ΦISC, ΦTET, ΦTTA and ΦFL are the QYs of the intersystem crossing (ISC) of sensitiser, TET, TTA and fluorescence (FL) of the emitter, respectively. When we compare the PtCP-fixed glass in DPA solution and the mixed solution samples, the ΦISC of PtCP is assumed to be almost the same as that of PtOEP (around 90% as previously reported26) because both contain Pt, which plays a dominant role in the heavy atom effect. The values of ΦTTA are the same between the samples because the TTA process in solution phase is common for both. ΦFL (>95%27) values are also the same. Therefore, ΦTET must be comparable for both samples, suggesting that TET from PtCP fixed on solid surface to DPA in solution occurs as efficiently as the solution case.
TET dynamics of solution sample
To understand the details of the TET process of the sensitiser fixed on solid surface, its dynamics were studied for the glass and solution samples. First, we checked the TET dynamics of the solution sample (mixed solution of PtOEP (150 μM) and DPA (15 mM) in toluene). The emission time profile at 640 nm and at 430 nm, corresponding to the phosphorescence and UC emission, respectively, were recorded (Fig. 4). The phosphorescence (Fig. 4, red) shows quick rise and decay of less than 100 ns. The deconvolution analysis made with the instrument response function (IRF, Fig. 4, green) using a single decay component (eqn (10)) gave τ3S = 24 ± 0.1 ns. The analysis successfully reproduced the observed phosphorescence time profile (Fig. 4, black). On the other hand, only a rise was observed for the UC emission at this timescale (Fig. 4 sky blue). The data was similarly analysed using eqn (11), with the omission of  as no decay was observed, with the curve fit giving τ3S = 31 ± 0.1 ns. The obtained values of τ3S from phosphorescence decay and UC emission rise were close to each other and can be considered to represent the same process. Thus, the lifetime of TET was concluded to be in the timescale of 30 ns. This result shows that the TET dynamics for the mixed solution are unique.

Phosphorescence dynamics of PtCP-fixed nanoporous glass immersed in solution
The phosphorescence decay of the PtCP-fixed glass without emitter (647 nm) was measured through immersion in degassed neat solvent (toluene) and exhibited a single exponential decay with a lifetime of 94 ± 1.0 μs (Fig. 5, in sky blue). The lifetime was unchanged by increase in excitation pulse energy from 11 μJ to 88 μJ (data not shown). The lifetime when immersed in neat solvent was the same as that in argon gas (95 μs).22 These results showed that the natural triplet lifetime (= 1/k3S) of PtCP fixed on nanoporous glass was ∼90 μs.
 Fig. 5  Phosphorescence decay curves of PtCP-fixed glass immersed in neat toluene (light blue) and in DPA solution in toluene (red), both deaerated by Ar-bubbling, together with fitting curves (see text). The incident pulse energy was 11 μJ. PtCP and DPA concentrations were 150 μM and 15 mM, respectively. The residuals can be found in Fig. S1 in ESI.† 
Phosphorescence was drastically quenched by immersion in the DPA/toluene solution (Fig. 5, in red). It was found that three exponents (44 ± 0.1 μs (4%), 3.5 ± 0.1 μs (17%) and 0.39 ± 0.1 μs (79%)) were needed to reproduce the observed decay. The longest lifetime (44 μs) was shorter than that in neat toluene but of the same order of magnitude. Thus, this component was considered to originate from PtCP not involved in the TET process, while the two fast components, 0.39 μs and 3.5 μs, were possibly related to TET.
UC emission dynamics of PtCP-fixed nanoporous glass immersed in solution
Either or both of the two fast components of the phosphorescence decay of PtCP fixed on glass were considered to be involved in the TET process. Thus, we expect corresponding rising component(s) in the UC emission time profile following our analysis using eqn (11). The time profile of the UC emission (435 nm) of PtCP-fixed glass in DPA solution was measured under the same conditions as for phosphorescence. The result in Fig. 6 shows a fast rise (less than 1 μs), followed by a slow rise up until 4 μs before decaying.
 Fig. 6  Time profiles of UC emission (blue dots) and phosphorescence (red dots) of PtCP-fixed glass immersed in DPA/toluene solution (the same sample as used in Fig. 5) with the corresponding fitting curves (black line, see text). The sample was deaerated by Ar bubbling. 
The timescales of the rising components of UC emission corresponded to those of the phosphorescence decay. However, fit curves with a single rising component (eqn (11)) could not reproduce the experimental result well (a wavy residual remained for 0–4 μs, Fig. S2 in ESI†), suggesting influence from both decay components. We hypothesised a UC emission model with two rising components (τ3SA and τ3SB for 3SA* and 3SB*) and a common decay process (unimolecular τ3E and TTA) for 3E*.  
The assumption of a common decay process is reasonable because deactivation of 3E* occurs in the bulk solution regardless of its generation processes. The curve fitting with this model was performed by a numerical solution using the coupled differential equations (eqn (12)–(14)) to take into account of the second-order process of TTA. A reasonable fit was obtained by using the values of the phosphorescence lifetimes, 0.39 μs and 3.5 μs for τ3SA and τ3SB, as shown in Fig. 6 (the residuals are shown in Fig. S3 in ESI†). The relative amplitudes for the fast and slow rising components were 85% and 15%, which were close to the ratio 79%:17% = 82%:18% for two of the three components in the phosphorescence decays. These agreements in lifetimes and relative amplitudes suggested that two different TET processes exist for sensitisers fixed on the nanopore surface. The curve fit also gave τ3E = 165 ± 4 μs and kTTA = (1.7 ± 0.1) × 107 M−1 s−1, respectively (long-timescale data is shown in Fig. S4 in ESI†). The obtained value of τ3E is much shorter than that of DPA in solution (∼5 ms).28 The reason for this is not clear but a plausible explanation for this short decay is that the UC emission disappeared for 400 μs due to the fast TTA decay, which creates inaccuracies for long decays.
Quantum yield of TET from the lifetime
From the above results, the TET occurs with two different lifetimes, 0.39 μs (82–85%) and 3.5 μs (15–18%), which implies most of the energy transfer takes place in 3 μs or under. This is the slower than TET in the mixed solution (τ = 31 ns with the same concentration of emitter); however, it is still much faster than the natural triplet lifetimes (τ0 = 89 μs for PtCP fixed on nanoporous glass immersed in neat solvent). Thus, 3S* deactivates primarily through TET rather than natural (i.e., first-order) deactivation processes including phosphorescence. The ratio of the TET rate to the total rate from all deactivation paths from 3S* give the expression for the ΦTET as, (16)and thus, kTET = (τ0 − τ)/{ττ0[1E]0}(17)where τ = (k3S + kTET[1E]0)−1 and τ0 = k3S−1 are the lifetime of 3S* with and without emitter (i.e. [1E]0 = 0). By using τ < 3 μs and τ0 = 94 μs as mentioned above, ΦTET was obtained to be >0.97 for PtCP fixed on nanoporous glass. This value was very close to that of the mixed solution, ΦTET = 0.999, calculated from τ = 31 ns with the same concentration of emitter and τ0 = 50 μs without emitter.29 It is interesting to note that ΦTET is virtually unity, not only for the solution but also for the sensitiser-fixed glass sample.
Rate constants of TET for nanoporous glass
Since TET for the PtCP-fixed glass was found to have two different lifetimes (0.4 and 3.5 μs) as discussed in the previous sections, kTET was calculated to be 1.7 × 108 and 1.8 × 107 M−1 s−1 (Table 1) from eqn (17). On the other hand, kTET of the mixed solution was 2.7 × 109 M−1 s−1 and is close to the diffusion rate constant, 1.1 × 1010 M−1 s−1, in toluene.30 It is interesting to note that the two different TET processes of the PtCP-fixed glass are much slower than molecular diffusion in bulk solution, which has been believed to govern the TET process in solution.

One hypothesis to account for the slow TET from the solid surface is the change in solvent viscosity in glass nanopores. Slow TET rate has been previously reported in solid solutions of PMMA.14 However, this case is unlikely to apply here as viscosity must decrease by 10–100 times in nanopores with an average pore size of 55.6 nm. Low-viscosity organic liquid confined between silica surfaces with distance of 10 nm or wider has been found to not change from its bulk value.31 Dilbeck and co-workers reported that the TET rate from molecules fixed on a solid surface (of TiO2) was slower than that in solution.24 Therefore, it can be considered that the TET processes are not limited by the diffusion of DPA solution in nanopores but by the TET process from the solid surface itself.
For TET from solid surfaces, it is probable that the activation energy Ea is associated with adsorption to the nanopore surface. Increase in activation energy results in slower reaction as shown in the Arrhenius relation, kTET = Aexp(−Ea/RT), where A is the frequency factor. The two different observed kTET values corresponds to ΔEa = 5.6 kJ mol−1 for the same value of A. This ΔEa is close to typical adsorption energies.32 Thus, different types of adsorption of PtCP on the nanopore surface may change ΔEa and lead different rate constants. A possible explanation is that part of the PtCP is fixed edge-on while the rest adsorbed face-on at the nanopore surfaces. Further studies are required to verify the presence of this process during PtCP adsorption.
UC emission of all-solid TTA-UC system
Nanopores in PtCP-fixed porous glass were successfully filled with solid DPA instead of solution, by melting DPA and infiltrating it into the interconnected nanopores under vacuum. The resulting glass showed blue emission peaking at 470 nm (Fig. 7) during irradiation by green cw laser light (532 nm). The blue emission peak increased proportionally to the approximate square of excitation intensity (slope = 1.9, plotted in Fig. S9 in ESI†) while the phosphorescence of PtCP peaking at 650 nm was increased linearly (slope = 1.0). From these results we concluded this blue emission was UC emission from an all-solid hybrid TTA-UC system enabled by DPA-filled nanopores. However, the efficiency of UC was not high as seen in the intense phosphorescence peak in Fig. 7. Comparing the excitation intensities in Fig. S9 (for the all-solid sample in the quadratic region, ESI†) and Fig. 3 (for the immersion sample in the linear region), we see that a higher excitation intensity is required for the all-solid sample. This suggests the solid DPA imperfectly infiltrated the pores compared to solution. However, UC efficiency can be improved in the future by optimising the distance between PtCP and DPA molecules inside the nanopores.

Conclusion
In this study we demonstrated the concept of TTA-UC by TET from sensitiser fixed on a solid surface. By immersing pieces of PtCP-fixed nanoporous glass into a DPA solution of organic solvent, UC emission from DPA was clearly observed. The UC-QY was found to be comparable to that of a solution-based system at the same concentration. It was previously reported that the nonradiative relaxation of the sensitiser is suppressed by fixing it to the solid surface of nanopores. The results of this study show that TET can occur from a stabilised sensitiser on the nanopore surface to the free emitter in the solution phase. Study of emission dynamics clarified that there were two TET processes involved which were slower than the solution system process. In spite of the slow rate, ΦTET (97%) was almost as high as that in solution (99%). Stabilisation of the sensitiser through interaction with the nanopore surface is a possible reason for the slow rates of TET and the difference between them. The two rate constants may originate from the sensitiser associating with the solid surface of the nanopore via different modes. Furthermore, by filling the nanopores with solid DPA, an all-solid TTA-UC system was obtained. Our results show that fixing the sensitiser on the surface of a 3D network of nanoporous glass provides a new strategy for solid-state TTA-UC, presenting an attractive choice for device applications in the future.
