    , Accepted 8th January 2019First published on 8th January 2019AbstractAll-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3) have emerged as one of the most promising photovoltaic materials due to their superior thermal stability. However, the high phase transition temperatures (typically over 250 °C) of CsPbX3 perovskites are incompatible with flexible substrates. Herein, we employ a simple hot-casting method to fabricate low-temperature processed CsPbI2Br films. By casting the perovskite precursor solution onto a hot substrate (maintained at 55 °C), compact, large-grain and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br films can be prepared at a low post-annealing temperature, which outperform the conventional room temperature (RT)-casting and high-temperature (post-annealing at 340 °C) processed CsPbI2Br films containing some voids. As a result, the hot-casting and low-temperature (post-annealing at 120 °C) processed CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.5%, which is much higher than that (2.91%) of the RT-casting processed CsPbI2Br devices. Further optimization of the post-annealing temperature (optimized value: 180 °C) yielded the best performance of 13.8% for hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br devices. This study gives an effective and facile strategy toward low-temperature processed all-inorganic perovskite films and high-performance PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been spotlighted as a promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic technology due to the meteoric rise in their solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over the past few years.1–10 The maximum PCEs have been boosted from 3.8% in 2009 (ref. 1) to a certified 23.3% (ref. 10) recently, approaching those of existing thin film and crystalline silicon. Despite the rapid improvement in the PCE, these hybrid perovskite materials are unstable under heat and ambient conditions owing to the volatile and hydrophilic properties of organic cations, which severely hinders their commercial applications.11–13 To solve this instability issue, one of the most feasible methods is to develop all-inorganic perovskites by replacing the organic cations entirely with inorganic cations, such as cesium (Cs).11,13,14
Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3; X = I, Br, Cl, or mixed halides) thus have gained widespread attention in recent years because of their superb compositional and thermal stability,15 and excellent optoelectronic properties such as charge-carrier mobilities similar to those of well-studied hybrid ones.16,17 However, the PCE of solution-processed CsPbX3 PSCs is still far inferior to that of their hybrid analogues (e.g., MAPbI3), leaving much room for further improvement.18–20 The optical bandgap and air stability of CsPbX3 are varied depending on the halide composition. CsPbBr3 is the most phase-stable inorganic perovskite but its wide bandgap (∼2.3 eV) fundamentally limits its PCE.21 CsPbI3 possesses a relatively narrow bandgap (∼1.7 eV); regrettably, it is unstable in the black perovskite phase under ambient conditions and converts to the yellow non-perovskite phase in a matter of minutes.22,23 Among the iodide–bromide mixed-halide perovskites, CsPbI2Br represents a promising candidate due to its reasonable bandgap (∼1.9 eV) and considerable phase stability.7,15,17,20,24–28 Although outstanding PCEs of over 14% have been achieved in CsPbI2Br-based PSCs,15,25,27 high-temperature (>250 °C) annealing is generally required to form the black cubic perovskite phase, which is energy-consuming and incompatible with monolithic tandem or flexible solar cells on plastic substrates.7,26 Therefore, some efforts have been devoted to reducing the orthorhombic to cubic phase transition temperature of CsPbI2Br.7,26,29
In this work, we demonstrated a low temperature method to fabricate high-quality cubic-phase CsPbI2Br perovskite films via a simple one-step hot-casting process. By casting the perovskite precursor solution onto a hot substrate maintained at 55 °C, the phase transition temperature of CsPbI2Br could decrease to 120 °C, and compact and pinhole-free perovskite films with a large grain size could be formed. In contrast, the perovskite films produced by the conventional room temperature (RT)-casting process, in which the perovskite solution was coated at RT and then post-annealed at 340 °C for 10 min, exhibited numerous micrometer-sized voids on the film surface.7,30,31 As a result, solar cells fabricated with hot-casting and low-temperature (120 °C) processed perovskites yielded a PCE of 12.5%, which is much higher than that of the perovskites fabricated by the conventional process (2.91%). Further increasing the post-annealing temperature of hot-cast perovskites can boost the PCE to up to 13.8% at an optimal temperature of 180 °C. To our knowledge, the PCE achieved is among the best values reported for all-inorganic PSCs. In addition, it should be noted that the substrate temperature is precisely controlled herein by using a specially designed spin-coater with a mounted hot plate. This is different from the hot-casting method described by Nie et al. who heated both the perovskite precursor solution and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/PEDOT substrate on a hot plate and then transferred the hot substrate to the spin-coater chuck which is at RT.30
2. Experimental section
2.1. Fabrication of PSCs
PSCs were fabricated with a regular n-i-p planar structure of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/poly-triarylamine (PTAA)/MoO3/Al. ITO-coated glass substrates (CSG Holding Co., Ltd, 10 ohm sq−1) were cleaned stepwise with detergent, acetone, isopropanol and ethanol by sonication for 15 min each. After drying under a N2 stream, the substrates were treated with ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) for 15 min to generate a hydrophilic surface. The SnO2 colloid precursor (Alfa Aesar, 15 wt% in a H2O colloidal dispersion) was first diluted to 2.5 wt% with deionized (DI) water. Then, the diluted colloidal solution was spin-coated onto ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. To avoid oxygen and moisture, the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O) for the rest of the device fabrication.
The CsPbI2Br precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 208 mg of CsI (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), 184 mg of PbI2 (TCI, 98%) and 148 mg of PbBr2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%) in 1 mL of DMF (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%) and DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.9%) (4:1, volume/volume), with stirring at 90 °C for 2 h. The precursor solution kept at RT, was spin-coated on the ITO/SnO2 substrates heated at a certain temperature on a hot plate mounted on the spin-coater (hot-casting process; a photograph of the spin-coater is presented in Fig. S1, ESI†) or at RT (conventional RT-casting process) at 2500 rpm for 30 s. Right after spin-coating, the as-cast precursor film was annealed at a selected temperature for 10 min. A PTAA (Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp.) solution of 15 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%) was then spin-coated on the perovskite at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 5 nm MoO3 and 100 nm Al were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 9.0 × 10−5 Pa. The deposition rate and film thickness were monitored with a quartz crystal sensor. A shadow mask was put on the sample to define an active area of 4 mm2 before the metal deposition.
2.2. Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter unit under simulated Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was calibrated using a reference silicon solar cell. The measurements were carried out with the PSCs inside the glove box (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a QTEST HIFINITY 5 (Crowntech Inc., USA) at RT in air. The light intensity was calibrated using a single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell as a standard. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku-D/Max-3A X-ray diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed on a Hitachi S-4800 electron microscope. Absorption spectra were acquired using a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation methods of CsPbI2Br films

Fig. 1 shows schematic illustrations of conventional RT-casting and studied hot-casting processes for preparing CsPbI2Br films. In the conventional scheme, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at RT and then post-annealed for 10 min on a hot plate maintained at 340 °C.30 The obtained CsPbI2Br film presented a dark grey color, indicating the formation of cubic phase perovskite. However, we notice many small white spots that possibly nucleated from pinholes on the perovskite film.32,33 The presence of pinholes may cause a high leakage current and thus be detrimental to device performance. To fabricate compact, pinhole-free, large grain size perovskite films, a hot-casting deposition method was employed in this work. As shown in Fig. 1, the perovskite solution was coated onto a substrate maintained at a certain temperature, such as 55 °C. The obtained precursor film is light brown, which is apparently different from the transparent precursor film obtained using the RT-casting process. After post-annealing the hot-cast precursor films at low temperatures such as 120 °C and 180 °C for 10 min, dark brown mirror-like perovskite films are formed without any discernible white spots on the surface. This implies that hot-casting is a highly effective method to achieve smooth, dense, void-free and cubic CsPbI2Br films at low temperatures. For comparison, the RT-cast and low-temperature annealed CsPbI2Br films were also fabricated, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The perovskite films exhibited an orange yellow color at a low post-annealing temperature of 120 °C, and this color turned to partially black upon post-annealing at 180 °C, indicating the incomplete phase transition of CsPbI2Br. As an aside, the thicknesses of the CsPbI2Br films prepared by the two different methods are both about 400 nm, which is sufficient for them to serve as light-absorbing layers.34
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the preparation procedures of the CsPbI2Br films with the conventional RT-casting and hot-casting processes. Images of the precursor and post-annealed CsPbI2Br films prepared using the two different methods are also presented. 
To gain insight into the formation processes of cubic phase CsPbI2Br films prepared by the two different methods, we investigated the as-cast perovskite precursor films before post-annealing treatments by measuring their UV-vis absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the RT-cast precursor film had no absorption in the wavelength range of 450–700 nm, which indicates the formation of a non-perovskite phase (n-CsPbI2Br). This speculation is supported by the similar absorption spectra of the precursor film and n-CsPbI2Br. In contrast, the hot-cast precursor film showed two absorption onsets at 540 nm and 650 nm, corresponding well to the absorption onsets of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI2Br, respectively, which implies the formation of the CsPbBr3 perovskite phase. To verify this, the XRD spectra of CsPbBr3, CsPbI2Br and the hot-cast precursor film were measured, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The diffraction peaks for the precursor film at 2θ = 15.1° and 30.0° confirmed the existence of the CsPbBr3 phase. From Fig. S6a (ESI†), it can be found that after post-annealing the hot-cast precursor film at 120 °C, the absorption feature of CsPbBr3 disappeared, indicating the complete transformation of CsPbBr3 into CsPbI2Br by ion exchange. Based on the above analysis, plausible mechanisms for the formation of RT-casting and hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br films are depicted in Fig. S5 (ESI†). For RT-casting, a non-perovskite structure was formed in the precursor film. After post-annealing the precursor film at 340 °C, the non-perovskite phase was converted to the cubic CsPbI2Br phase via self-assembly. For our method (hot-casting), both CsPbBr3 and CsPbI2Br perovskite phases were formed in the precursor film. The dominant CsPbBr3 phase may act as the crystal nucleus in the crystallization of the CsPbI2Br perovskite during the post-annealing of the precursor film at 120 °C, which leads to the formation of compact and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br perovskite films.
3.2. Optical properties and surface morphologies of CsPbI2Br films prepared by the different methods
UV-vis absorption spectra of CsPbI2Br films prepared by the RT-casting and hot-casting methods are presented in Fig. S6a (ESI†). The absorption of the RT-cast perovskite film is almost completely overlapped with that of the hot-cast perovskite film. The absorption edges of CsPbI2Br films prepared by the two methods are both located at 650 nm, which is consistent with a previous report.22 Steady-state PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) were employed to investigate the charge-carrier dynamics in perovskite films (Fig. S6b and c, ESI†). The CsPbI2Br films were prepared on quartz glass substrates with identical methods to device fabrication. The PL intensity of the hot-cast perovskite film is much higher than that of the RT-cast film, suggesting a dramatically reduced nonradiative recombination rate within the CsPbI2Br film.15 The hot-cast CsPbI2Br film showed an enhanced average carrier lifetime (7.59 ns) compared to (0.23 ns) the RT-cast CsPbI2Br film (Table S1, ESI†). This prolonged carrier lifetime should be attributed to suppressed nonradiative recombination in the perovskite film, which is beneficial for charge transport and PSC performance.35,36
To confirm the above speculation, the surface morphologies of CsPbI2Br films prepared by the two different methods have been characterized by SEM. As seen in Fig. 2a, the conventional RT-casting processed CsPbI2Br film exhibited many micrometer-sized voids on the film surface, which probably arises from the exceedingly slow nucleation rate and crystallization process owing to the high boiling points of DMF (153 °C) and DMSO (189 °C).7,37 In contrast, hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br films displayed continuous and pinhole-free surface coverage due to the fast solvent evaporation and rapid nucleation (Fig. 2b and c). Furthermore, it is found that increasing the post-annealing temperature of the hot-cast precursor film from 120 °C to 180 °C resulted in a decreased number of grains with a much larger size (Fig. 2e and f). The larger grains (with an average grain size up to 1.67 μm) dramatically reduce the total grain boundaries to facilitate the charge transport and lower the recombination losses.37,38 The roughness of the CsPbI2Br films prepared by the two different methods was evaluated using atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). AFM confirms the surface morphology measured by SEM (Fig. 2a and c). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br film was 17.9 nm, which is notably lower than that (174.1 nm) of the RT-casting processed CsPbI2Br film. This verifies that hot-casting is a very effective method to achieve smooth, dense and void-free CsPbI2Br films at low temperature.
 Fig. 2  (a–c) Top-view SEM images and (d–f) grain size distribution histograms of the CsPbI2Br films prepared by the different methods: (a and d) conventional RT-casting process with subsequent post-annealing at 340 °C; hot-casting process with subsequent post-annealing at (b and e) 120 °C and (c and f) 180 °C. The grain size was obtained by measuring the average diameter of the grains in the plane direction from large scale SEM images (Fig. S7, ESI†). 
The crystal structures of conventional RT-casting and hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br films were further characterized by XRD (Fig. 3). For the hot-cast films, two main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.4° and 29.3° were observed corresponding to the (100) and (200) planes of the cubic CsPbI2Br perovskite phase, respectively. Although the peak positions are almost the same, the intensities of (100) and (200) peaks for the 180 °C post-annealed film are notably higher compared to those of the 120 °C post-annealed film, which is consistent with the results obtained from the SEM images (Fig. 2b and c) showing the significantly increased grain size as the post-annealing temperature increases from 120 °C to 180 °C. For the conventional RT-cast film, the XRD peak positions (shifted by ∼0.06° to higher 2θ values) are nearly identical to those of the hot-cast films, but the peak intensities are much weaker suggesting its relatively lower crystallinity.39

3.3. Thermal stability of CsPbI2Br and CH3NH3PbI3 films
One of the most important advantages of all-inorganic CsPbX3 perovskites is their superior thermal stability compared to traditional organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts.7 To verify this, we examined the thermal stability of the hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br film by heating it on a hotplate at 100 °C in air at ∼60% relative humidity. For comparison, the thermal stability of an organic–inorganic hybrid compound, CH3NH3PbI3, was also tested under the same conditions. Fig. 4 shows XRD spectra of CsPbI2Br and CH3NH3PbI3 films before and after aging. As shown in Fig. 4a, the characteristic peaks of the CsPbI2Br film remained almost unchanged after heating for 48 h in air and no new peaks appeared. The CsPbI2Br film looked identical after the thermal aging test for 48 h, showing a dark brown color (inset in Fig. 4a). By contrast, a strong peak at 12.6° assigned to the PbI2, as indicated by the asterisk, was observed for the CH3NH3PbI3 film after heating for 24 h in air, and the new peak completely dominated the XRD pattern after 48 h (Fig. 4b). The CH3NH3PbI3 film decomposed into PbI2 and turned from dark brown to yellow after the thermal aging test for 48 h (inset in Fig. 4b), which indicates its inferior thermal stability compared to the CsPbI2Br film. To exclude the effect of water adsorbed under air conditions on the decomposition of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, we further tested the thermal stability of CH3NH3PbI3 and CsPbI2Br films by heating them at 100 °C in a N2-filled glove box with H2O and O2 levels below 1 ppm. The temporal evolution of absorption spectra with the annealing time for the CH3NH3PbI3 and CsPbI2Br films is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). For the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3, the absorbance decreased with the annealing time. After 96 h, the perovskite was decomposed to PbI2, as is evident from their overlapped absorption. In contrast, the absorption spectrum of the CsPbI2Br film remained almost unchanged upon thermal aging, indicating the excellent thermal stability of the CsPbI2Br perovskite.

The insets show the photographs of the perovskite films taken during the thermal stability tests. Asterisks denote the major reflections from PbI2. 
3.4. Photovoltaic performance of CsPbI2Br-based PSCs
To examine the influence of the hot-casting process on device performance, planar n-i-p PSCs were fabricated by using RT-cast and hot-cast CsPbI2Br perovskites as absorbers with the device architecture of ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/PTAA/MoO3/Al (Fig. 5a). Details on the optimization of the substrate and post-annealing temperatures for maximizing the device performance are presented in Fig. S10–S15, Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). The optimal substrate and post-annealing temperatures are 55 °C and 180 °C, respectively. The J–V characteristics of the CsPbI2Br devices prepared by the different methods are shown in Fig. 5b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As predicted, the conventional RT-casting processed CsPbI2Br PSC exhibited a very low PCE of 2.91% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) of 0.50 V, 12.85 mA cm−2, and 45.3%, respectively. The poor device performance can be attributed to the low-quality perovskite film with incomplete surface coverage, which not only decreases the light harvesting caused by the direct light pass without absorption, but also produces a lot of pinholes as shunt paths for direct contact between the SnO2 electron-transporting layer and PTAA hole-transporting layer. In contrast, the hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br PSCs showed dramatically improved performance with PCEs of 12.5% and 13.8% for 120 °C and 180 °C post-annealed perovskites, respectively, which is ascribed to the compact and void-free perovskite morphologies. The higher PCE of the 180 °C post-annealed perovskite device can be explained by the larger grain size and higher crystallinity of the perovskite film as evidenced by the SEM and XRD data.

To confirm the accuracy of the photon J–V measurements of the devices, their corresponding EQE spectra are presented in Fig. 5c and the Jsc values calculated from the integration of the EQE curves over the AM 1.5 G solar spectrum are listed in Table 1. Compared to the RT-casting processed CsPbI2Br device, the devices fabricated by the hot-casting method exhibited a significantly enhanced EQE over the whole spectral response range from 300 to 650 nm. Considering the almost overlapping absorption spectra of the CsPbI2Br films prepared by the two different methods (Fig. S6a, ESI†), the EQE enhancement of the hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br device is more reasonably attributed to the better perovskite morphology and crystallinity. The Jsc values obtained by integration of the EQE curves are 11.22, 14.17 and 14.54 mA cm−2 for the RT-casting@340 °C post-annealing, hot-casting@120 °C post-annealing and hot-casting@180 °C post-annealing processed CsPbI2Br devices, respectively, in good agreement with the values obtained from the J–V curves (Table 1).

Fig. 5d presents the stabilized current density and power output at the maximum power point of the best performing PSC, measured as a function of light soaking time at a forward bias voltage of 0.95 V. The photocurrent stabilized at ∼13.50 mA cm−2 and the PCE stabilized at ∼12.8% for about 500 s, which may exclude the issue of efficiency variation caused by the light soaking effect.21 Fig. S16 (ESI†) shows the J–V curves obtained for the hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br devices, measured at different scan rates. Encouragingly, the J–V curves exhibited negligible difference with increasing the scan rates from 30 to 105 mV s−1. Fig. S17 (ESI†) presents the J–V curves of the RT-casting and hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br devices measured in the reverse and forward scan directions. It is clear that all these three kinds of devices exhibited J–V hysteresis in different scan directions and the higher PCE was obtained when the reverse scan was applied. The exact reason for this hysteresis is not yet understood but a number of possible causes have been proposed, like ion migration in the perovskite material and interfacial recombination.37,40 Further efforts are ongoing to eliminate the hysteresis by passivating the CsPbI2Br surface and/or modifying the interface between the charge-transport layer and perovskite layer.
The thermal stability of the PSCs based on hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br and the traditional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 was investigated. The devices were placed on a hot plate at 100 °C in a N2-filled glove box with H2O and O2 levels below 1 ppm. As shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†), the hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br solar cells exhibited slow degradation with the annealing time, which is more stable than that of the CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells under the same conditions.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a facile method to fabricate high-quality CsPbI2Br perovskite films at low temperatures. By casting the perovskite precursor solution onto a hot substrate (maintained at 55 °C), the phase transition temperature of CsPbI2Br could decrease from 340 °C to 120 °C, and more importantly, large-grained dense CsPbI2Br perovskite films could be formed, outperforming the conventional RT-casting processed CsPbI2Br films with large voids. An excellent PCE of 12.5% was achieved by the hot-casting processed and 120 °C post-annealed CsPbI2Br devices, which is significantly higher than that of RT-casting processed CsPbI2Br devices. By further optimization of the post-annealing temperature, the hot-casting processed CsPbI2Br devices gave a very competitive performance of 13.8%, which is among the best results yet reported for low-temperature processed all-inorganic PSCs. The presented facile method will help pave the way toward efficient flexible solar cells.
