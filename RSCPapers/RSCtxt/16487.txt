    , Accepted 11th December 2009First published on 13th January 2010AbstractWe report a new class of anthracene-thiophene-based copolymers, PAT4. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of PAT4 was broad and covered the full range of the solar spectrum. The hole mobility of PAT4 was high, up to 0.037 cm2V−1 s−1. PAT4-based organic solar cells showed promising power conversion efficiencies of 1.7%.
The current energy crisis has created an urgent need to develop new renewable energy sources, and organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered to be one of the most promising candidates due to their low cost and ease of fabrication.1,2 The fabrication of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells has seen significant improvements, but the conversion efficiencies must be enhanced before the commercialization process may begin.3,4 The development of novel electron donating polymer materials is essential for increasing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in solar cell devices.
To realize highly efficient BHJ solar cells, electron-donating polymers must exhibit well-matching light absorption that matches well with the solar spectrum as well as good charge-transport properties and processability.5 The fraction of the solar energy spectrum that is useable has been enlarged through the development of low band gap polymers (1.6–1.9 eV) that are designed around an internal electron donor–acceptor (D–A) interaction system.6,7 Indeed, copolymerizing alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient units is an effective method for producing low band gaps that absorb solar energy at longer wavelengths, beyond 600 nm.
In this communication, we report a new class of low band gap polymers that are not based on a D–A system, but that are based on an extended π-conjugation length containing only donating components. The dual goals of extending the length of π-conjugation and improving the charge transport properties were achieved by employing thiophene derivatives. Polythiophenes are the most promising organic electronic material for both OSCs and organic thin film transistors (OTFTs).3,8,9 However, with the exception of rrP3HT, no impressive OSC performances have been reported for polythiophenes (e.g.PQT-12 and PBTTT) due to charge transport imbalances and the lack of percolating pathways as a result of the high crystallinity of films of these polymers.10–12 To overcome these problems, as well as to improve solar energy absorption by a low band gap polymer at short wavelengths, we co-incorporated bulky TIPS group-substituted anthracene derivatives into the copolymer main chain. Anthracene derivatives are useful building blocks with oxidation stability and a planar extended π-conjugation system.13 However, few reports have described the use of anthracene, using the 2,6-positions, as a building block for polymer main chains in OSC applications. We expected that this modified polymer would have a broad absorption spectrum in significant regions of the solar spectrum and a high charge mobility, qualities that are optimal for producing efficient organic BHJ solar cells.
The synthetic routes to the polymersPAT2 and PAT4 are shown in Scheme 1. 2,6-Dibromo-9,10-bis(triisopropylsilyl ethynyl) anthracene (TIPSAnt) was synthesized according to our previously reported procedure.14 As counterpart monomers of TIPSAnt, we prepared two thiophene derivatives, T2 and T4, containing dodecyl thiophenes. T4 contained two more unsubstituted thiophenes than did T2, to achieve a more extended conjugation length and to provide space between the bulky TIPS groups and dodecyl side chains, thereby preventing intramolecular repulsion. The two copolymers were synthesized viaStille coupling reactions in the presence of a catalyst, Pd2(dba)3. PAT2 was obtained as a sticky red liquid that was difficult to purify. In contrast, PAT4 was obtained as a black powder and purified by reprecipitation and Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, and heptane. The chemical structure of PAT4 was verified by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. The weight average molecular weights (Mw) of PAT2 and PAT4 were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a polystyrene standard and were found to be 3000 (Mw/Mn = 1.50) and 10100 (Mw/Mn = 1.30), respectively. The intramolecular repulsion between bulky TIPS groups and dodecyl side chains of thiophenes inhibited the extended growth of PAT2, producing a low molecular weight polymer. Therefore, only the optical properties were measured for PAT2. In contrast, PAT4, with unsubstituted thiophenes as spacers between the bulky side groups, grew as a relatively high molecular weight polymer.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of PAT2 and PAT4. 

PAT4 was found to exhibit very good thermal stability, losing less than 5% of its weight upon heating to 425 °C, whereas PAT2 showed very low stability, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The low thermal stability of PAT2 arose from the polymer’s low molecular weight and difficulties in the purification steps. The thermal transitions of PAT4 were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere. PAT4 exhibited a broad endotherm peak at around 350 °C that was likely due to backbone melting. The introduction of TIPSAnt modified the typical crystalline properties of polythiophenes to yield materials suitable for OSC applications.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers were recorded both in solution (chlorobenzene) and in spin-coated films, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The UV-vis absorption spectra of PAT2 in both solution and films were similar, with an absorption maximum at 380 nm. The difference between the absorption maxima in solution and films (ΔAmax) was only 6 nm. A very small ΔAmax and hypsochromically shifted absorption of PAT2 compared to PAT4 implied that PAT2 had a very short effective conjugation length due to the intramolecular distortion of the bulky side groups. In contrast, the ΔAmax of PAT4 films was 206 nm, because the absorption maxima of PAT4 in solution and films were at 421 nm and 627 nm, respectively. Surprisingly, ΔAmax for the PAT4 film was 200 nm larger than that of PAT2. To the best of our knowledge, this huge ΔAmax is the largest value among reported π-conjugated polymers.5,15,16 The size of this red shift demonstrated the extent of π-conjugation and suggested the presence of substantially more intermolecular order in the two-dimensional (2D) stacking of PAT4 in films. The less effective conjugation length of PAT4 in the solution state is likely due to rotation of unsubstituted thiophenes. In the film state, the molecules align in order to form crystalline films due to very good packing properties of TIPS and dodecyl groups. As a result, PAT4 formed planar structures and showed greatly extended π-conjugation. (The intermolecular ordering of PAT4 films was revealed with XRD measurements. See ESI†.) Moreover, the absorption of PAT4 films covered the spectral range from 300–700 nm. This large range is optimal for absorbing large quantities of solar energy. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the use of PAT4 has the potential to significantly improve the collection of solar photons relative to well-known donating polymers that have a larger full width at half maximum (FWHM) absorption band at 320 nm (e.g. P3HT, 98 nm; MDMO-PPV, 165 nm).17 This FWHM is 180 nm larger than that of PQT-12 as a result of the incorporation of anthracene, which absorbs at shorter wavelengths, near 400 nm.8

To investigate the electrochemical properties of PAT4, we carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on thin films of PAT4. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PAT4 were estimated to be −5.39 and −3.33 eV, respectively, using a previously reported empirical equation.18 The HOMO level was lower than rrP3HT (5.0 eV), and PCPDTBT (5.3 eV).5,19 Relatively low-lying HOMOs can result in better oxidation stability. The LUMO level of PAT4 was a little bit higher for efficient electron transfer to PCBM-60 but both the HOMO and LUMO levels of PAT4 can be further lowered by modifying the molecular structure of the polymer. The optical band gap of PAT4, determined from the absorption onset, was 1.87 eV. The solar energy absorption of PAT4 was expected to be efficient, because the optical band gap of PAT4 was very close to the maximum solar energy flux, around 1.77 eV.20
Top-contact OTFTs based on PAT4 were fabricated by spin-coating onto octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) treated SiO2 substrates to evaluate the charge-transport abilities of PAT4 films. The OTFTs of PAT4 exhibited typical p-channel TFT characteristics and very good saturation behavior, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The device showed promising TFT performances with hole mobility of 0.037 cm2V−1 s−1, on/off ratio of 3 × 104, and threshold voltage of −1.6 V. These high charge carrier mobilities may increase the photocurrent and PCE in solar cells.7 In addition, the hole mobility of TFTs composed of PAT4 were well-matched with the electron mobility of pure PCBM-60 (0.024 cm2V−1 s−1), which may produce balanced charge transport in BHJ solar cells.21

Solar cell performance was investigated to evaluate the device improvements conferred by the optimal absorbance and charge transporting properties of PAT4, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and as summarized in Table 1. BHJ solar cell devices of PAT4 with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PAT4:PCBM-60 (100 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated. The active layers were spin-coated from chlorobenzene solutions containing several blend ratios of PAT4:PCBM-60 (w/w). The active areas of the organic solar cells were 0.06 cm2. Among the OSC devices, the device with a 1:4 ratio showed the most promising performance, with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of −5.3 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.65 V, fill factor (FF) of 50.9%, and PCE of 1.75%. Lower weight ratios of PCBM-60 in blended copolymers led to inefficient charge separation and electron transporting properties.22 The PAT4:PCBM-60 blends (1:4 ratio) formed a desirable bicontinuous inter-penetrating network structure as shown in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices based on PAT4 were measured using an incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system. All the devices show rather good photon to electron conversion efficiency in all the visible spectrum range with EQEs of 20–40%. In the 1:4 blend ratio of PAT4:PCBM-60 device, the highest EQE reaches up to 41% at 420 nm. (IPCE results can be seen in the ESI†.) Work is ongoing to optimize OSC device structures as well as to increase the molecular weight of PAT4.

In conclusion, we have synthesized a new class of anthracene-thiophene-based copolymers, PAT4, characterized the absorption and electrochemical properties of these copolymers, and characterized the TFT and OSC device performances. Very good absorbance and charge transport properties of PAT4 produced promising OSC performances, with a PCE of 1.7%.
