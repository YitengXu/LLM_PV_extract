    , Accepted 9th December 2017First published on 11th December 2017AbstractWith the capability of localizing optical energy via surface plasmon resonance (SPR), plasmonic Au nanostructures hold great promise for enhancing the solar water splitting of semiconductor photocatalysts. While the content of Au plays a critical role in mediating interfacial charge transfer, its quantitative influence on the efficiency of plasmon-assisted water splitting is still not fully understood. This work aimed to explore the correlations among plasmonic metal content, SPR-mediated charge transfer and electromagnetic response, and the resultant photoactivity enhancement toward photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The PEC system was constructed by employing Au particle-decorated ZnO nanocrystals (ZnO–Au) as the plasmonic photoanode. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and finite-difference time-domain simulations were utilized to evaluate the optimal Au content which attained effective charge separation and imposed a significant SPR effect for achieving the largest photoactivity enhancement. The charge transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and its dependence on the Au content were examined with electrochemical impedance analysis, which manifested the effectiveness of the optimal Au content in facilitating the hole transfer kinetics. The present study reports a technical advance in the realization of the quantitative effect of Au for designing sophisticated plasmonic PEC systems that enabled efficient solar-to-fuel energy conversion.
1. Introduction
Since the first report in the early 19th century,1,2 the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metals has found its way into a broad spectrum of practical applications, which include photocatalysis,3 photovoltaics,4 light-emitting diodes,5 photodetectors,6 waveguides,7 lasers,8 and chemical sensors.9 The SPR phenomenon describes the collective oscillations of conduction band electrons at metal particles, the intensity and frequency of which strongly depend on the metal size, shape, composition, interparticle distance as well as the dielectric environment,10 providing the fundamental basis for enhancing the material properties of the surrounding medium. Among the different emerging SPR-induced applications, plasmonic photocatalysis has received particular interest in view of the possibility of harnessing solar energy.11 Recent developments have enabled the extensive use of plasmonic metal nanostructures such as Au in solar energy conversion and environmental purification. By acting as an antenna that localizes the optical energy by SPR, plasmonic Au can sensitize semiconductor photocatalysts to light with energy below the bandgap, which offers an alternative route to improve the solar spectrum harvesting.12–14 On the other hand, Au nanostructures may serve as an effective electron acceptor for semiconductors, promoting overall charge separation to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency.15 Many efforts are currently attempted to design and utilize Au-based plasmonic nanostructures as a versatile photocatalyst paradigm for realizing solar fuel production.16–30
As a promising renewable energy technology, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has attracted immense attention not only because it offers immediate access to solar hydrogen utilization, but also the system represents a viable approach capable of meeting the global energy needs.31 The SPR effect has been prosperously exploited in designing sophisticated PEC cells, aimed particularly at extending the available wavelength for the water splitting reaction to utilize more visible light. Especially for metal oxide photoelectrodes such as ZnO32 and TiO2,33 the introduction of plasmonic Au can render visible photoactivity and simultaneously facilitate charge carrier transfer, proven to be an efficient approach to boost the PEC performance. Different mechanisms have been proposed to address the function of plasmonic Au in enhancing the visible photoactivity of oxide semiconductors, which involve resonant photon scattering, hot electron injection, and electric field amplification.34 Light scattering is a far-field effect that increases the effective optical path length of incident light and therefore enhances the photon absorption of semiconductors. This effect however only holds for plasmonic nanostructures with the size larger than 50 nm.35 Both hot electron injection and electric field amplification are near-field effects, which can be regulated by engineering the interface between Au and semiconductors. For hot electron injection, Au nanostructures serve as a sensitizer that generates high-energy electrons upon SPR excitation. These hot electrons can be further injected into the conduction band of semiconductor electrodes for driving the PEC reactions. Regarding the electric field amplification, the enhancement of photoactivity relies on the spectral overlap of the SPR of Au with the absorption of semiconductors. The interaction of the localized electric field around the plasmonic Au with the neighboring semiconductors then boosts the production of additional charge carriers for enhancing the PEC performance. Despite the extensive developments on the plasmonic PEC systems, the revelations of the two near-field effects have been controversial.36,37 Particularly, there is a lack of quantitative and convincing evidence to designate these two effects as accounting for the observed enhanced photoactivity. A systematic study on this topic is therefore crucial for revolutionizing the design of plasmonic PEC systems as well as boosting their widespread deployment for solar energy conversion.
This work was intended to explore the correlations among plasmonic metal content, SPR-mediated charge transfer and electromagnetic response, and the resultant photoactivity enhancement toward PEC water splitting, which have not been addressed in the literature thus far. Here, the Au particle-decorated ZnO nanocrystals (denoted as ZnO–Au) were employed as the photoanode for constructing a typical plasmonic PEC system. The samples were prepared in a delicate antisolvent process, in which ZnO nanocrystals were grown accompanied by Au particle decoration.38 The content of the decorated Au can be rationally controlled, from 1.7, 3.5, 6.0 to 9.2 wt%. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) analysis was carried out to inspect the interfacial charge dynamics for the ZnO–Au nanocrystals. By introducing a secondary continuous-wave (CW) monochromatic irradiation to excite the surface plasmons, the charge transfer mediated by SPR excitation and its dependence on the Au content can be quantitatively analyzed. On the other hand, the electromagnetic response at the Au/ZnO interface for different ZnO–Au samples was studied using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. The charge transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and their dependence on the Au content were further examined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that introducing plasmonic Au with an optimal content can increase the number of available charge carriers, modify the electronic structure of ZnO as well as improve the hole transfer kinetics, facilitating water oxidation to maximize the overall PEC performance.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Antisolvent process for ZnO–Au synthesis
ZnO–Au nanocrystals were prepared by an antisolvent approach reported in the previous work.38 Briefly, Au particles with an average size of 14.3 nm were first obtained using the citrate-reduction method. The ligand exchange operation was then conducted by incubating the Au colloids in the poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) solution (PVP, Mw = 29000 Da, 0.01 M) for 1 day. The thus-obtained PVP-stabilized Au particles were added in the bad solvent for the antisolvent growth of ZnO, which resulted in the formation of ZnO–Au nanocrystals. The samples were thoroughly washed with water and ethanol, and collected by centrifugation. In this work, various amounts of PVP-stabilized Au particles were employed to obtain ZnO–Au nanocrystals with increasing Au contents, from 1.7, 3.5, 6.0 to 9.2 wt%. The products are respectively denoted as ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2.
2.2 Time-resolved PL measurements
Time-resolved PL spectra were collected in a customized single photon counting system which contains a sub-nanosecond pulsed diode laser (λex = 320 nm, PicoQuant, PLS 320), a grating spectrometer and a high-speed photomultiplier tube with the single photon counting card. The signals collected at the PL emission of ZnO (λem = 375 nm) were analyzed with a biexponential decay model to generate two decay components and an intensity-weighted average emission lifetime. By comparing the reciprocal of emission lifetime between relevant samples, the rate constant of charge transfer across the Au/ZnO interface can be computed.39 To inspect charge transfer mediated by the SPR excitation, an additional CW monochromatic irradiation (λex = 550 nm), which excited the surface plamons of the tested sample, was introduced throughout the time-resolved PL measurement. The thus-recorded PL decay kinetics data were compared with those obtained without SPR excitation to further deduce the charge carrier transfer induced by the plasmonic effect.
2.3 PEC measurements
A three-electrode cell was configured for carrying out PEC measurements, which consisted of a Pt counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (3 M KCl) and the Na2SO4 electrolyte (0.5 M, pH = 6.61). The photoanode was fabricated by depositing the sample suspension (300 μL, 1.0 mg mL−1) on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm, 10–12 ohm per square). The illumination source was provided by an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Newport, LCS-100, 94011A), which gave a one-sun irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 on the electrode surface. A bandpass filter with the band-width of 400–700 nm was added to the light source to produce visible irradiation (75.3 mW cm−2). To produce UV illumination (21.8 mW cm−2), a shortpass filter (λ < 400 nm) was attached. All of the PEC measurements were performed on an Autolab PGSTAT204 electrochemical workstation. The linear-sweep voltammogram (I–V curves) was recorded with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and the amperometric analysis (I–t curves) was conducted at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an illumination on/off interval of 100 s. The IPCE spectra were measured under illumination of monochromatic light from a 150 W xenon lamp coupled with a 0.2 m monochromator (Horiba, Tunable PowerArc, 1200 gr mm−1, dispersion = 4 nm). The EIS measurements were conducted at open-circuit potential under AM 1.5G illumination. A small AC signal of 10 mV was applied to the cell over the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. The Mott–Schottky analysis was performed at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz. To convert the measured potential (vs. Ag/AgCl) to the scale relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), Nernst equation was used as follows: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + E0Ag/AgCl, where ERHE denotes the converted potential vs. RHE, EAg/AgCl stands for the measured potential against the Ag/AgCl reference, and E0Ag/AgCl = 0.210 V at 25 °C.40
2.4 Electric field simulations
The electromagnetic simulations were implemented with the 3-D FDTD method. The TM-polarized light was incident along a specific direction to the simulation geometry, which comprised a single ZnO nanocrystal coated with a given number of Au particles. Four representative samples including pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5 and ZnO–Au-6.0 were chosen for designing the calculation models, in which the geometry, dimensions and the Au particle density were exactly specified to adopt the actual structural features. The simulated ZnO nanocrystal was elliptically shaped having the major- and minor-axis length of 700 and 300 nm, respectively, whereas the modeled Au particles were spherical with 14 nm in size. The Au particle density was set to be 72, 437, and 803 particles per μm2 for ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, and ZnO–Au-6.0, respectively, as determined from the SEM images. Water was used as the background dielectric medium with a constant refractive index of 1.33. The simulation boundaries in the x-, y- and z-directions were defined with perfectly matched layer conditions.
2.5 Characterization
The morphology and dimensions of the products were examined with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, SU-8010) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-3000F) operated at 300 kV. The crystallographic structure of the samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D2 Phaser) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED, an accessory of TEM). The elemental analysis was conducted using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), the accessory of SEM (SU-8010) and TEM (JEM-3000F). The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3900H spectrophotometer containing an integrating sphere attachment. For steady-state PL spectroscopy, a Hitachi F-4500 equipped with a xenon lamp (150 W) as the excitation source (λex = 325 nm) was used.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the SEM images for pristine ZnO and the four ZnO–Au nanocrystals with increasing Au contents. The pristine ZnO was characteristic of elliptically shaped nanostructures with a major-axis length of 700–900 nm and a minor-axis length of 300–500 nm. For the ZnO–Au nanocrystals, the surface-attached Au particles had a size distribution of 14.3 ± 2.5 nm and were homogeneously distributed on the ZnO surface. The density of the decorated Au increased with increasing Au content, which was determined to be 71.8, 437.2, 802.7, and 1055.1 particles per μm2 for ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2, respectively. Details of calculating Au particle density are depicted in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Importantly, single Au particles or Au-free ZnO nanocrystals were rarely observed in the products, ensuring the accuracy of the determined Au content within the structures. It should be noted that the precise control of Au particle content had significant implications because it offered the feasibility of looking into the quantitative effect of Au for plasmonic PEC systems. The corresponding XRD pattern of Fig. 1e revealed the existence of wurtzite ZnO and fcc Au for the ZnO–Au nanocrystals, in agreement with the results of TEM observations of Fig. S2 (ESI†). In Fig. S2d (ESI†), the EDS element-mapping data further confirmed the structural feature of Au particle decoration on the ZnO surface.

The optical properties of the samples were measured by absorption and PL spectroscopy. In Fig. 2a, the diffuse reflectance spectrum of pristine ZnO displayed a prominent absorption onset at 375 nm, which can be assigned to the bandgap absorption of ZnO. The apparent bandgap was determined from the inserted Tauc plot, approximately 3.24 eV. Upon Au particle decoration, an additional visible absorption band at around 550 nm was noticed. This visible absorption was ascribed to the typical SPR absorption resulting from the decorated Au. When compared with the SPR wavelength of Au colloids (typically located at 520 nm), the SPR band of ZnO–Au was slightly red-shifted, which can be understood from the higher refractive index of ZnO (n = 1.9–2.1)41 than that of the solvent (n = 1.33 for water). Fig. 2b compares the steady-state PL spectra for the five ZnO-based samples. A broad emission band across the UV to visible region was recorded, which comprised a band-edge emission peak at 385 nm and two defect-related sub-bands at 460 and 550 nm. The three emissions were significantly quenched upon the decoration of Au, suggesting that pronounced charge separation occurred within the ZnO–Au. Because the Fermi level of Au (+0.60 V vs. NHE)42 is lower than the conduction band edge of ZnO (−0.32 V vs. NHE),43 the decorated Au can function as an effective electron acceptor for ZnO, prohibiting charge recombination to depress the PL intensity.

To reveal the role of plasmonic Au in mediating the charge transfer of ZnO, time-resolved PL measurements were performed. Time-resolved PL spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool, which allows us to inspect the kinetics of excited state deactivation by monitoring the emissive transitions on the component of interest.44–57Fig. 3a first shows the typical PL decay profiles recorded by repetitively exciting the ZnO component with 320 nm laser pulses. These PL decay traces were collected at 375 nm, the peak position of the band-edge emission of ZnO, which reflected the kinetics of excited state deactivation for ZnO. Through comparing the decay profiles between relevant samples, the interfacial charge transfer within ZnO–Au can be quantitatively deduced. As compared to pristine ZnO, the four ZnO–Au samples displayed faster PL decay kinetics characteristic of pronounced charge separation. These decay kinetics were fitted with a biexponential function, in which an intensity-weighted average emission lifetime (〈τ〉) was computed for comparison. As summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), the 〈τ〉 value was calculated to be 3.23, 1.40, 0.98, 0.94, and 0.97 ns for pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2, respectively. Evidently, all the ZnO–Au samples showed a shortened 〈τ〉 relative to pristine ZnO, which was regarded as a result of charge transfer from ZnO to the decorated Au. By using the expression kct(ZnO → Au) = 1/〈τ〉 (ZnO–Au)-1/〈τ〉(ZnO), the rate constant of charge transfer from ZnO to Au (kct) can be calculated. The estimated kct value was 4.05 × 108, 7.11 × 108, 7.54 × 108, and 7.21 × 108 s−1 for ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2, respectively. Notably, 6.0 wt% of Au gave rise to the largest kct for ZnO–Au (kct = 7.54 × 108 s−1 for ZnO–Au-6.0), suggesting that there existed an optimal Au content for achieving the most effective charge separation for ZnO–Au. Similar situations have been addressed in other semiconductor/metal composite systems,45,54 in which the interfacial charge dynamics can be optimized by tuning the amount of the introduced metals. Note that the identification of the optimal Au content was essential for the intelligent design of plasmonic PEC systems because it dictated the interfacial charge dynamics and influenced the overall carrier utilization. To further inspect the charge transfer mediated by SPR excitation, a secondary CW monochromatic irradiation (λex = 550 nm) simultaneously exciting the surface plasmons of the Au component was introduced throughout the time-resolved PL measurement. The thus-recorded emission traces are shown in Fig. 3b and the fitted parameters are also listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Upon the SPR excitation, the ZnO–Au displayed a substantially lengthened 〈τ〉SPR, pointing to the emergence of a plasmon-related charge transfer pathway which prolonged the process of excited state deactivation. In contrast, the pristine ZnO displayed nearly unchanged emission lifetime under the same secondary irradiation condition. The invariant emission trace of pristine ZnO guaranteed the capability of the present spectroscopic configuration for monitoring the SPR-mediated charge transfer. In Fig. 3c, a stochastic model describing the excited state decay for the current ZnO–Au system was constructed in an attempt to understand the kinetics of the possible relaxation processes. In this simplified model, the excited state of ZnO for ZnO–Au can decay by two competing pathways, i.e. the radiative electron–hole recombination and non-radiative interfacial charge transfer. Following the SPR excitation, hot electron injection as well as electric field amplification may induce additional carrier generation for ZnO, subsequently deferring the excited state decay of ZnO. According to the proposed kinetics scheme, two differential equations were developed to formulate the rate of excited state (S*) decay for ZnO–Au without SPR excitation and under SPR excitation, which are respectively expressed by eqn (1) and (2): (1) (2)Here, krec and kct respectively represent the rate constants of carrier relaxation via radiative charge recombination and non-radiative interfacial charge transfer, whereas kSPR stands for the rate constant of carrier generation induced by SPR excitation. It should be noted that following SPR excitation hot electron injection and electric field amplification may concomitantly occur to promote the carrier generation of ZnO, both of which contributed to the observed kSPR. Assuming that the difference of decay kinetics between the cases with and without SPR excitation was merely the plasmon-induced carrier generation pathway, we may estimate the apparent kSPR value of ZnO–Au by using eqn (3): (3)

For ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2, the obtained kSPR value was respectively 4.33 × 108, 7.73 × 108, 7.62 × 108, and 6.05 × 108 s−1. These values were of the same order of magnitude as the plasmon-induced charge transfer rate constant reported for the Au@CdS/SrTiO3 nanostructures.58 The observed highest kSPR value on ZnO–Au-3.5 signified that 3.5 wt% of Au was much effective in imposing the plasmonic effect for expediting carrier generation of ZnO. This observation was distinct from the trend of kct variation, suggesting that the quantitative effect of Au on the interfacial charge dynamics and SPR-mediated charge transfer was essentially different. It should be remarked that the present CW-assisted time-resolved PL spectroscopic configuration was primitive yet practical, which offers an efficient analytical approach to realizing the charge dynamics of plasmonic nanostructures in a delicate manner.
Besides the charge transfer dynamics, the electric field magnification induced by SPR excitation was also relevant to the performance of plasmonic PEC systems. In order to assess the electromagnetic effect, the FDTD simulations were performed to calculate the electric field distribution for ZnO–Au. The models for FDTD calculations are displayed in Fig. 4, which consisted of an elliptically shaped ZnO nanocrystal coated with a fixed amount of Au particles. Fig. 4a displays the spatial distribution of electric field on the different simulation models under incident light of 550 nm. Noticeably, the ZnO–Au nanocrystals were characteristic of strong field enhancement in the vicinity of the decorated Au particles, which have been recognized as hot-spots in plasmonic metal nanostructures. To quantitate the localized electric field around the simulation models, the profiles of total electric field (|E| = (Ex2 + Ey2 + Ez2)1/2) as a function of incident wavelength were further obtained. As shown in Fig. 4c, the electric field intensity of ZnO–Au was greatly augmented in the visible region, complying with the SPR-enhanced electromagnetic field mechanism. Among the three ZnO–Au models, ZnO–Au-3.5 showed the largest electric field enhancement, around 4-fold increase over pristine ZnO at the incident wavelength of 550 nm. This outcome suggested that there also existed an optimal Au content for enhancing the electromagnetic response of ZnO–Au. It has been shown that the localized electric field magnification around the plasmonic metal particles strongly depends upon the distance between the adjacent particles.59–62 For spherical particles, the extent of field enhancement first increases with decreasing interparticle distance, but abruptly reduces as the interparticle distance is down to a critical value. Such a crossover derives from the occurrence of charge transfer between the nearly touching particles, which hinders the electromagnetic interaction to reduce the field enhancement. For the current ZnO–Au system, the approach of the neighboring Au particles with increasing Au content was evident, especially when the Au content reached 6.0 wt%. The inset of Fig. 4c clearly illustrates the spatially overlapped electric field between the neighboring Au particles for ZnO–Au-6.0. Accordingly, we surmised that pronounced charge transfer between the highly adjacent Au particles occurred for ZnO–Au-6.0, which was accountable to the otherwise reduced electric field enhancement as observed. It should be noted that although the SPR wavelength of Au did not overlap with the bandgap absorption of ZnO, the electric field amplification across the SPR absorption range could still increase the visible photoactivity of ZnO by virtue of the existence of structural defects. As revealed in the steady-state PL spectra, the structural defects of ZnO can create additional electronic levels in the energy gap, making possible the electronic transitions in the visible region, which may cooperate with the SPR-enhanced electric field to boost the generation of more charge carriers.33,63,64 As a consequence of this cooperation, the ZnO–Au nanocrystals can be endowed with noticeable visible photoactivity upon the SPR excitation. It is noteworthy that the electric field was enhanced in the vicinity of the decorated Au, the region fairly close to the surface of the nearby ZnO. This feature suggested that the electric field-induced charge carriers were mostly generated in the near-surface region of ZnO, which can be easily separated and transferred to the surface for participation in PEC reactions.65,66 The PEC performance of ZnO–Au can therefore benefit from the SPR-induced, fairly localized electric field amplification.

The inset in (c) highlights the spatially overlapped electric field between the neighboring Au particles for ZnO–Au-6.0. 
To examine the practical use in a PEC cell, the ZnO–Au nanocrystals were employed as photoanodes to perform water oxidation. A solar simulator consisting of a xenon lamp with an AM 1.5G filter was first utilized to study the photoresponse of the samples towards the full solar spectrum. Fig. 5a and b display the typical I–V and I–t curves recorded on pristine ZnO and the four ZnO–Au electrodes. All the ZnO–Au electrodes exhibited larger saturated photocurrent densities than pristine ZnO did, revealing the positive role of Au decoration in enhancing the solar photoactivity of ZnO. The photocurrent enhancement factor (I/I0), which is obtained by dividing the photocurrent of ZnO–Au by that of pristine ZnO at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl,67 was further calculated to make a universal performance comparison. For ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2 electrodes, the I/I0 value under full solar spectrum irradiation can respectively reach 1.5, 2.0, 4.2, and 2.4. Obviously, the Au content affected the photocurrent enhancement of ZnO–Au in a non-monotonic trend. A similar quantitative effect has been reported in other plasmonic PEC systems,19,32,68 while the underlying mechanism remained ambiguous. Here, we noticed that the trend in I/I0 variation for ZnO–Au with increasing Au content corresponded well to that in kct change, with the ZnO–Au-6.0 showing the highest I/I0 and the largest kct. This correspondence suggested that interfacial charge transfer within ZnO–Au was the dominant factor dictating the overall PEC performance. In order to probe the plasmonic effect, the ZnO–Au electrodes were further tested under visible light illumination to highlight the contribution of the decorated Au. Fig. 5c and d compare the resultant PEC efficiency among different electrodes, from which several important features can be noticed. First, the slight visible response on the pristine ZnO electrode was ascribed to the existence of structural defects as revealed from the steady-state PL spectrum. These structural defects may invoke interband transition within the bandgap of ZnO to respond to visible light.69–71 Second, Au particle decoration still increased the photocurrent of water oxidation under visible light illumination. The enhanced photoactivity in response to visible light was caused by the SPR absorption of Au, which sensitized ZnO to render noticeable visible photoactivity. Third, the trend of visible photoactivity enhancement as a function of Au content differed from the trend obtained under full solar spectrum irradiation. Under visible light, the I/I0 of ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2 was respectively 4.2, 7.5, 5.1 and 1.9. The ZnO–Au-3.5 electrode was found to achieve the largest photocurrent enhancement, signifying that 3.5 wt% of Au imposed the most significant plasmonic effect for maximizing the visible photoactivity of ZnO. This contention can be validated from the SPR-mediated charge dynamics data and FDTD calculation results, in which ZnO–Au-3.5 attained the highest kSPR value as well as the largest electric field enhancement. The correlations among Au content, charge carrier dynamics and the resultant photoactivity enhancement are further underscored in Fig. 6 to comprehend the underlying mechanism. As Fig. 6 illustrates, the solar photoactivity enhancement of ZnO–Au electrodes rested upon the improved interfacial charge transfer as a result of pronounced charge separation, whereas the visible photoactivity improvement derived from the SPR absorption of Au which invoked hot electron injection and electric field magnification. By tuning the content of Au, the interfacial charge dynamics as well as the SPR-mediated charge transfer can be manipulated, maximizing the overall PEC performance of ZnO–Au electrodes.

To identify whether or not the SPR excitation can facilitate the intrinsic charge carrier generation for ZnO, we further studied the photoresponse of the samples under UV light illumination with and without additional visible irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7a, additional visible irradiation, which provided instant SPR excitation, led to a significant increase in photocurrent generation for the four UV-illuminated ZnO–Au electrodes, with ZnO–Au-3.5 showing the largest enhancement of around 12.7%. This observation corroborated that the SPR excitation of Au indeed induced the generation of more charge carriers for ZnO when the samples were irradiated with UV. In order to elucidate the photoactive origin of such an incremental charge generation, the photocurrent response under monochromatic illumination toward the additional visible irradiation was also monitored. In Fig. 7b, the photocurrent action spectra clearly revealed that the additional visible irradiation can promote the bandgap excitation of ZnO for the four ZnO–Au electrodes, producing extra charge carriers to generate higher photocurrents. The findings from Fig. 7 provided compelling evidence that the SPR excitation of Au can facilitate the intrinsic charge carrier generation for ZnO. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the trend of SPR-enhanced UV photocurrent generation with the Au content was consistent with the trends of visible photoactivity enhancement, kSPR variation and electric field magnification, connoting that the demonstrated quantitative effect of Au on the SPR-mediated charge transfer was essentially valid. The analytical results pointed out that 3.5 wt% of Au was the most competent to enhance the visible photoactivity of ZnO with the assistance of the plasmonic effect.

Another important factor that affects the water oxidation of photoanodes is the charge carrier transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. To obtain the charge transfer kinetics information at the interface, the EIS measurements were further conducted. Fig. 8a displays the typical Nyquist plots consisting of well-defined semicircles at the middle-frequency region. The equivalent circuit used to fit the EIS data is depicted in the inset. Instead of ordinary capacitance, constant phase elements (CPEs) were used to better analyze the data on account of the non-ideal capacitance behavior of the nanostructure surface.72–74 In this mode, Rs denotes the overall series resistance of the circuit, Rsc derives from the charge transfer resistance in the semiconductor electrode, and Rct corresponds to the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the semiconductor and the electrolyte.75 Here, the Rct component was much relevant since it characterized the hole transfer from the semiconductor surface to the electrolyte, which has been regarded as the rate-determining step in PEC water oxidation.76 As summarized in Table S2 (ESI†), all the ZnO–Au electrodes exhibited Rct much lower than that of pristine ZnO, suggesting substantially improved charge transfer kinetics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface for ZnO–Au. The time constant for hole transfer from the semiconductor surface to the electrolyte can be estimated from the characteristic frequency at the peak of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot, which is defined as the relaxation time by τrel = 1/(2πfmax),77 where fmax is the corresponding peak frequency. The fmax value of pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2 was respectively determined to be 17.58, 37.28, 115.14, 215.44, and 167.68 Hz, giving the τrel value as 9.06, 4.27, 1.38, 0.74, and 0.95 ms. As compared to pristine ZnO, the four ZnO–Au electrodes all exhibited much shortened τrel. This outcome manifested that the introduced Au can improve the hole transfer kinetics for ZnO, facilitating water oxidation to boost the resultant PEC performance.

In (a), the inset shows the equivalent circuit used to fit the data and the solid curves stand for the fitting results. In (b), the straight lines represent the linear fits of the data for the determination of VFB. 
On the other hand, the number of charge carriers available for PEC reactions can be assessed from the Mott–Schottky analysis, which allows the quantitative determination of carrier density at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. In Fig. 8b, a positive slope in the linear region of the Mott–Schottky plots can be observed for all the tested electrodes, indicating n-type behavior for both pristine ZnO and ZnO–Au. The Mott–Schottky plots can be analyzed with eqn (4): (4)In eqn (4), C is the capacitance obtained at each potential with a fixed frequency, e0 the electron charge (e0 = 1.60 × 10−19 C), ε the dielectric constant of ZnO (ε = 10 for ZnO),32ε0 the vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), Nd the carrier density, V the applied potential, VFB the flat-band potential, kB the Boltzmann constant (kB = 1.38 × 10−23 m2 kg s−2 K−1) and T the temperature. From the slope of 1/C2vs. V plot in Fig. 8b, the Nd of the sample can be determined according to the expression , which gave 2.03 × 1019, 2.97 × 1019, 4.95 × 1019, 1.13 × 1020, and 6.40 × 1019 cm−3 for pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2, respectively. The observed enlarged Nd for ZnO–Au indicated that Au particle decoration may re-distribute the carrier concentration of ZnO, improving the charge transfer kinetics at the expense of extra carriers. In addition to the carrier density, the flat-band potential (VFB) and depletion layer thickness (WD) can also be estimated from the Mott–Schottky analysis, which offers further insights into the electronic structure of ZnO–Au and its implications in PEC performance. According to eqn (4), when extrapolating 1/C2 to zero on the Mott–Schottky plot, the intercept at the x-axis leads to the quantity VFB + kBT/e0, from which the VFB can be obtained. Note that VFB also represents the Fermi level because band bending diminishes at the flat-band condition. As Fig. 8b displays, the pristine ZnO yielded a Fermi level of −0.42 V vs. Ag/AgCl (around +0.18 V vs. RHE), in good agreement with the previously reported values.78 The decoration of Au particles gradually shifted the Fermi level to a more positive value, varying from −0.34 V to −0.24 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Because the Fermi level of Au was more positive than that of ZnO,79 the equilibrated Fermi level of ZnO–Au would be located between those of ZnO and Au, shifting toward more positive potential as observed. Since the carrier density of the five ZnO-based samples was substantially higher than the effective density of state in the conduction band (5.87 × 1018 cm−3 for ZnO with an electron effective mass of 0.38 me), the energy difference between the conduction band edge and Fermi level was supposed to be very small.80,81 By further subtracting the optical bandgap value (Eg = 3.24 eV) from the conduction band edge (empirically equal to VFB), the valence band edge of the sample can be obtained. Combining these results, a portrait of the band structure for the five ZnO-based samples is established in Fig. 8c. Also sketched in Fig. 8c is the thickness of the depletion layer, WD, at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, which was obtained from the equation .82 The calculated WD value at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl was 4.81, 3.58, 2.69, 1.75, and 2.05 nm for pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5, ZnO–Au-6.0, and ZnO–Au-9.2, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 8c, the positive shift of the conduction band edge for ZnO–Au effectuated the positive shift of the valence band level, which in turn increased the oxidizing power of photogenerated holes for expediting the PEC reactions. Meanwhile, the reduced WD for ZnO–Au can shorten the hole transfer time from the semiconductor to the electrolyte, which improved the water oxidation kinetics as well.83,84 It is important to note that the trends of τrel, Nd and WD variation with the Au content complied with the results of PEC measurements under full solar spectrum irradiation. More specifically, ZnO–Au-6.0 exhibited the shortest τrel, the largest Nd and the smallest WD, corresponding well to the highest I/I0 observed in the solar PEC measurements. This correspondence indicated that the enhanced solar photoactivity of ZnO–Au was associated with the increment of charge carriers, the modified electronic structure as well as the improved hole transfer kinetics, the utility granted by Au particle decoration.
In the interest of correlating the photoactivity enhancement with the wavelength of incident light, we further collected the incident-photon-to-current-conversion-efficiency (IPCE) data by measuring the photocurrent density at each incident wavelength. The IPCE value at a specific wavelength can be determined from the equation IPCE = (1240I)/(λPlight), where I is the measured photocurrent density, Plight is the power density of incident light and λ is the wavelength of incident light. Fig. 9 displays the IPCE spectra for pristine ZnO and the four ZnO–Au electrodes. For better understanding the underlying mechanism, the IPCE spectra were explored at two wavelength ranges, UV and visible regions. As compared to pristine ZnO, the four ZnO–Au electrodes displayed substantially increased IPCE values across the band-edge absorption range of ZnO, with ZnO–Au-6.0 showing the largest increment. The sequence of IPCE values for the four ZnO–Au electrodes conformed to the trend of I/I0 change under full solar spectrum irradiation, corroborating that the enhanced photoactivity in the UV region arose from the pronounced charge separation rendered by Au particle decoration. In the visible region, the pristine ZnO showed fairly limited photoresponse as expected, whereas the four ZnO–Au electrodes exhibited noticeable photoactivity with the spectral feature matching with the SPR absorption of Au. Importantly, ZnO–Au-3.5 attained the highest IPCE across the SPR absorption range. With this finding, together with the spectral accordance and SPR-mediated charge dynamics data, we came to a conclusion that the visible photoactivity of ZnO–Au emanated from the plasmonic effect associated with hot electron injection and electric field magnification. As a final note, the present ZnO–Au electrodes were fairly stable during the operation in a PEC cell. As evident from Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), upon 2 h of PEC operation no appreciable change in microstructural features and chemical states of ZnO can be observed, reflecting high structural and chemical stability for both pristine ZnO and ZnO–Au. In particular for ZnO–Au, the decorated Au particles were still firmly immobilized on ZnO after the PEC reaction, which was crucial to sufficing the requirement of extended operations for developing durable PEC systems.
 Fig. 9  IPCE spectra of pristine ZnO and the four ZnO–Au electrodes recorded at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the wavelength range of (a) 300–800 nm and (b) 490–620 nm (the marked region in (a)). 
4. Conclusions
In closing, ZnO–Au nanocrystals with controllable Au contents were employed as the plasmonic photoanode to realize the quantitative effect of plasmonic Au on the performance of PEC water splitting. Time-resolved PL data suggested that 6.0 wt% of Au gave rise to the most effective charge separation for ZnO–Au, which was considered as the dominant factor dictating the overall PEC performance. The results of SPR-mediated charge dynamics and FDTD simulations further revealed an optimal Au content of 3.5 wt% for imposing the most significant SPR effect, accountable for the largest visible photoactivity enhancement observed on ZnO–Au-3.5. Furthermore, introduction of Au improved the hole transfer kinetics of ZnO by modifying the electronic structure, which can also be manipulated by tuning the Au content for maximizing the solar photoactivity of ZnO–Au. The established correlations among Au content, SPR-mediated charge transfer and electromagnetic response, and the resultant photoactivity enhancement from the current ZnO–Au system may lay a solid foundation for creating effective yet applicable plasmonic PEC cells capable of realizing solar fuel production.

 	Fig. 3  Time-resolved PL spectra for pristine ZnO and the four ZnO–Au nanocrystals recorded (a) without SPR excitation and (b) under SPR excitation. (c) Simplified kinetics scheme for ZnO–Au following pulsed laser excitation (λex = 320 nm) with a secondary CW monochromatic irradiation (λex = 550 nm) exciting the surface plasmons of Au.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Simulated spatial distribution of electric field on the x–y plane for pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au-1.7, ZnO–Au-3.5 and ZnO–Au-6.0 under incident light of 550 nm. (b) Schematic model of ZnO–Au-1.7 for FDTD simulation. (c) Total electric field around the pristine ZnO and the three ZnO–Au as a function of incident wavelength. The inset in (c) highlights the spatially overlapped electric field between the neighboring Au particles for ZnO–Au-6.0.	 

 	Fig. 5  Linear-sweep voltammetry I–V and amperometric I–t curves collected on pristine ZnO and the four ZnO–Au electrodes: (a), (b) under full solar spectrum irradiation (AM 1.5G filter, 100 mW cm−2) and (c), (d) under visible light illumination (visible bandpass filter, 75.3 mW cm−2).	 

 	Fig. 6  Correlations of I/I0, kct and kSPR with Au content for ZnO–Au electrodes.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Amperometric I–t curves under UV light illumination and (b) photocurrent action spectra under monochromatic illumination collected at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl on pristine ZnO and the four ZnO–Au electrodes with and without additional visible irradiation.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Mott–Schottky plots recorded on pristine ZnO and the four ZnO–Au electrodes. The corresponding band structures are depicted in (c). In (a), the inset shows the equivalent circuit used to fit the data and the solid curves stand for the fitting results. In (b), the straight lines represent the linear fits of the data for the determination of VFB.
