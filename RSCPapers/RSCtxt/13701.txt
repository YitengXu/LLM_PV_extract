The optical and electrical properties of these polymers, in which the pendent groups on the carbazole moiety were modified, were investigated. Aryl substituted P2 shows a narrower band gap (1.61 eV), higher hole mobility (4.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and more planar backbone structure than alkyl substituted P1. The modification of side groups significantly affected their surface morphologies. The device performance of solar cells based on these polymers and a fullerene acceptor was characterized.
1 Introduction
Narrow band gap conjugated polymers (NBGCPs) are an attractive class of polymeric semiconductors under investigation due to their various optoelectronic applications.1,2 NBGCPs have been studied extensively to take advantage of their optical properties, which can be fine-tuned to match the solar spectrum, and their molecular energy levels, which can be tailored to favor photoinduced charge transfer to other semiconductors.3–5 Therefore, NBGCPs have emerged as versatile materials for use in the field of organic electronics such as organic field effect transistors (OFETs),6–8 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),9,10 and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).3,5,11–13 Since one very efficient way to achieve intrinsic NBGCPs is through the use of push–pull structures, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the synthesis and processing of NBGCPs with appropriate choices of donor–acceptor moieties.5,12–14
2,7-Carbazole based conjugated polymers have recently shown great utility in OPV applications due to the electron-rich nature of the unit as a “push” moiety, while also possessing outstanding chemical stability, imparted by the fully aromatic carbazole ring.15,16 Although the deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of these polymers allow less oxidation and large open circuit voltages (VOCs) compared to commonly used polythiophene and polyphenylenevinylene (PPV) based polymers, their wide band gaps (∼3 eV) limit light absorption from solar irradiation, which sets limitations on the photocurrent generation. To compensate for the limited absorption typical of carbazole-based polymers, various electron deficient moieties have been utilized to reduce the band gaps of 2,7-carbazole based copolymers. Among poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives which have been previously reported, poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) has emerged as one of the most efficient electron donating materials in OPVs, yielding power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of >7%.17,18
In parallel, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based conjugated materials have been widely studied as attractive candidates for OFETs and OPVs due to their high optical density, photochemical stability, and facile synthetic modification.19–21 Janssen and coworkers first demonstrated DPP based copolymers as a donor material in OPV devices, showing a narrow optical band gap of 1.4 eV and a PCE of 1.1%.19 Later, considerable efforts to improve device performance have led to PCEs of up to 6.5% via various electron donating units in DPP-based copolymers.22–24
By combining the carbazole and DPP moieties, a new type of copolymer, poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PCBTDPP), has been recently synthesized by Leclerc and coworkers. The copolymer exhibits a narrow band gap of 1.57 eV, a relatively high hole mobility (0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1) and a moderate PCE (1.6%).25 Further improvements have been developed by means of various side chains,26–28 solvents,29 and additives.30
In addition, pendant group modification on polymers can affect many properties such as solubility, molecular ordering, light absorbance, and energy levels. In recent work, N-aryl substituted carbazole units show red-shifted absorption spectra relative to N-alkyl substituted polymers, which induce lowering of HOMO levels in polymers.31 The enhanced electron donating power of the phenyl group and extended conjugation length caused by resonance of the phenyl group can therefore contribute to narrower band gaps in copolymers.32
In this work, we synthesized and characterized two new carbazole-DPP based conjugated copolymers having different pendent groups substituted on the nitrogen atom of the carbazole units. One polymer has normal branched alkyl side chains, while the other has a rigid phenyl ring. These two copolymers showed significant differences in optical and electronic characteristics such as optical absorption, electrochemical oxidation and reduction, charge transport, and photovoltaic device performance.
2 Experimental section
Material synthesis
All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar or TCI America and used directly as purchased. 2,7-Bis(4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethyl-1′,3′,2′-dioxaborolan-2′-yl)-N-9′′-heptadecanylcarbazole, 2,7-bis(4′,4′,5′,5′-tetramethyl-1′,3′,2′-dioxaborolan-2′-yl)-N-9′′-(3,5-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)carbazole, and 3,6-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione were prepared using a similar synthetic procedure reported in the literature.19,32,33

Instrumentation
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on an actively shielded Varian Unity Inova 600 MHz at 25 °C. Chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) relative to internal tetramethylsilane. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed on a Polymer Laboratories PL220 chromatograph at 150 °C in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was obtained by a TA Instruments DSC (Model Q-20) at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow in the temperature range of 0 to 300 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Mettler TGA/sDTA 851e at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-vis absorption measurements were performed on a Beckman Coulter DU 800 spectrophotometer. Solution measurements were performed in chlorobenzene for both polymers. Films were deposited by spin-casting from 0.5% wt chlorobenzene solutions at 2000 rpm for 40 seconds onto glass substrates. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were accomplished using a CHI 730B instrument in a standard three-electrode, one compartment configuration equipped with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt counter electrode and a glassy carbon working electrode (dia. 3 mm). The glassy carbon electrodes were polished with alumina. The experiments were performed in anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The solutions for electrochemistry were purged with dry argon for 10 minutes to deoxygenate the system. Thin films on glassy carbon were obtained by drop-casting of polymer solutions at room temperature. Ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) was added into the solution after collecting CV curves to obtain an internal standard, assuming the HOMO of Fc/Fc+ to be 4.8 eV.
Density function theory (DFT) calculations
DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 package with the nonlocal hybrid Becke three-parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) function and the 6-31G* basis set to obtain the HOMO and LUMO levels after optimizing the geometry of the materials using the same method.
Transistor fabrication and characterization
All FETs were fabricated on heavily n-type doped Si wafers with a 200 nm thick thermally grown SiO2 layer. The n-type doped Si substrate functioned as the gate electrode and the SiO2 layer functioned as the gate dielectric. Bare P1 and P2 films were spin cast at a spin speed of 2000 rpm for 40 s from 0.5% wt chlorobenzene solutions. All deposition was carried out in a N2-glovebox. 50 nm thick Au electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. The channel length (L) and the channel width (W) were 50 μm and 3.45 mm, respectively. Electrical characterization was performed under a N2 atmosphere using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parametric analyzer.
Surface topography measurements
Tapping mode AFM images were collected under a N2-atmosphere using the Nanoscope III controller (Veeco). Silicon probes with spring constants of 5 N m−1 and resonant frequencies of 75 kHz were used.
Solar cell fabrication and characterization
A 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-cast from aqueous solution (5000 rpm for 40 s). The substrates were then dried at 140 °C for 10 min in air and transferred to a N2-glovebox for spin-casting the active layers. Solar cells were fabricated using P1 and P2 as donors and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor. Blend solutions of P1:PC71BM (1:3 w/v) and P2:PC71BM (1:3 w/v) in chlorobenzene were prepared. The final step in device construction involves thermal evaporation of 100 nm thick Al electrodes. Current–voltage curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The device area was 9.84 mm2 defined by an aperture. All data were obtained under AM 1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 under an ambient atmosphere.
3 Results and discussion
Thermal properties

Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of the push–pull type conjugated copolymers studied in this work. Alkyl and aryl side chains were introduced at the nitrogen position in the carbazole moiety to investigate the effect of pendent groups on electrical and optical properties. The thermal properties and stabilities of the two polymers were investigated by DSC and TGA which can be found in the ESI.† DSC thermograms show that P1 exhibits a glass transition at 277 °C and crystallization at 222 °C, but P2 does not show any transition peaks in the scanning range. The TGA plot shows that both polymers exhibit good thermal stabilities in N2, indicating 5% decomposition at 403 °C (P1) and 422 °C (P2). The rigid pendant group may attribute more to the thermal stability of P2 relative to the alkyl side chain of P1.

Optical properties
Solution and solid state absorption spectra of P1 and P2 prepared from chlorobenzene are provided in Fig. 2a. Substitution of side chains at the nitrogen position in the carbazole causes dramatic shifts in the absorption spectrum. The arylated polymer (P2) solution exhibits a maximum absorption peak (λmax) at 705 nm and an onset (λonset) at 749 nm, which are red-shifted relative to those of the P1 solution (λmax = 660 nm and λonset = 701 nm, respectively). In the solid state, P1 shows a red-shifted absorption (ca. 20 nm) compared to its solution, while there is no significant difference in the case of P2. In general, it is known that the absorption peaks at long wavelengths originate from a localized intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor segments in push–pull type conjugated molecules.5,34 Therefore, the shift toward the long wavelengths of P2 compared to the absorption spectrum of P1 in the solid state indicates stronger ICT between carbazole with the aryl chain and DPP segments and intimate chain contacts.

(b) Cyclic voltammogram of P1 and P2 films. 
Theoretical investigation for intramolecular charge transfer
To gain further insight into the ICT of the push–pull chromophore, the excitation energies in the ground state and excited states were investigated by means of the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method and compared to their experimental UV-vis spectra. Structural optimization was carried out with the B3LYP/6-31G* basis and the Gaussian 03 package.35 To simplify the calculations, the octyl side-chains on the carbazole moiety in the molecular backbone and two of the 2-ethylhexyl substituents on the DPP unit were replaced by methyl groups at a repeat unit of n = 1. The excitation energies and oscillator strengths of the wave function of the 10 lowest excited states were calculated with the optimized structures. The TDDFT predicted vertical excitation energies for P1 (black bar) and P2 (red bars) are shown in Fig. 2a. For P1, the main excited transition at 660 nm (1.88 eV) with an oscillator strength of 1.09 represents a CT transition from the HOMO to the LUMO. The second (HOMO1 → LUMO) and third (twofold degenerated states, HOMO-2 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO+1) excited singlet states at 615.8 nm and 593. 1 nm, respectively, feature a less pronounced CT character. The strong CT for P2 originates from the π–π* character of the main feature at 705.9 nm (1.76 eV), which is attributed to an excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO. Therefore, substitution of the side chains in push–pull conjugated copolymers critically affects the optical and electronic properties of the copolymers beyond general side chain effects, and interestingly, the alteration of aryl side chains at the same positions leads to a narrower band gap (Eoptg ∼ 1.6 eV) for P2 than for P1 (Eoptg ∼ 1.7 eV).
Electrochemical properties
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), as shown in Fig. 2b. The results of the CV measurements are summarized in Table 1 and reveal the modified HOMO and LUMO energy levels by the structure of side chains. The HOMO and LUMO levels of P2 (−5.12 and −3.37 eV) exhibit more positive values compared to those of P1 (−5.17 and −3.40 eV, respectively). Although energy band gaps (Eg) obtained from the CV results are slightly wider than Eoptg, one observes a similar trend in Eg within the range of experimental error.

Electronic structure and molecular geometry
Steric hindrance due to side chains is a critical factor, which can alter the coplanarity of conjugated backbones when side chains are modified. The HOMO and LUMO charge densities may become localized by the distortion of conjugated backbones, interfering with charge transport properties.36 The distributions of the main chain conformation for the P1 and P2 were investigated using DFT with the B3LYP/6-31G* basis and the Gaussian 03 package. Fig. 3 shows the charge–density isosurfaces of the HOMO and LUMO levels of P1 and P2 in the energetically favorable geometry. The HOMOs of the donor–acceptor copolymers are well distributed along the conjugated chains, while their LUMOs are localized on the DPP acceptor unit, suggesting effective delocalization of the HOMO band and p-type behavior. Although the HOMO and LUMO isosurface configurations of P1 were quite similar to those of P2, the backbone of P1 was markedly distorted (28°) compared to P2 (19°). Such steric hindrance by the alkyl side chains in P1 twisted the structure of the conjugated backbone, which is attributed to the interrupted ICT and reduced oscillator strength of the low energy optical transition relative to the P2.
 Fig. 3  DFT-optimized geometries and isosurface plots for the HOMO and LUMO levels and side views of (a) P1 and (b) P2. 
Charge-carrier mobility measurements
The effects of side chain substitution on the electrical transport properties were examined using an FET configuration. Fig. 4 displays the transfer characteristics of P1 and P2 FETs, which show an influence of the side chains on the FET behavior of the two polymers. The FET mobility was calculated in the saturation regime using the following equation; IDS = (W/2L)μCi(VGS − VTH),2 where IDS is source–drain current, W and L are the channel width and length, respectively, the Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the insulator layer, VGS is the gate bias, and VTH is the threshold voltage. Un-annealed P1 and P2 FETs exhibit μ values of 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The highest hole mobilities obtained were 1.7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1 when annealed at 120 °C and 4.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P2 when annealed at 200 °C. VTH and Ion/Ioff were −11 V and 6.8 × 105 for P1 and −6 V and 7.5 × 105 for P2, respectively. P2 thus exhibits better p-type FET performance with better output characteristics than P1 (see ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Transfer characteristics of P1 and P2 FETs. 
Surface topography of pristine polymers
Surface topographic studies for thin films of each polymer were carried out by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 5. The surface of P1 is amorphous with sparsely raised bright features and a root-mean-square (rms) roughness of 0.37 nm, while P2 exhibits a uniform film consisting of regular grains with the same roughness of 0.37 nm. The small modification of the molecular structure induced a significant variation in the surface morphology, which can critically affect device performance. The better hole transport in P2 relative to P1 may be attributed to a more extended and interconnected network of ordered domains.

Photovoltaic devices
Previously, a carbazole and a DPP copolymer that is structurally related to P1 exhibited a PCE of 2.45% as an OPV material (without additive).30 With this perspective in mind, we examined the photovoltaic properties of P-CzAl-DTDPP and P2 using a conventional BHJ solar cell architecture. Fig. 6 shows the current density-voltage (J–V) characteristics of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells fabricated using P1:PC71BM (1:3) and P2:PC71BM (1:3). The P1:PC71BM device yields a PCE of 1.89% with a short-circuit current (JSC) of 5.12 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.81 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.46. The P2:PC71BM device exhibits a PCE of 1.50%, a JSC of 4.15 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.69 V, and an FF of 0.52. The difference in the HOMO values of P1 and P2 should correlate with the different VOCs produced by the materials.5,21 Considering that the HOMO value of P1 is 0.05 eV deeper than that of P2, one would expect the VOC to be 0.05 V greater for P1. The observed VOC produced by P1 is 0.12 V greater than that of P2; this slight discrepancy is close to the experimental error in the CV measurement and may also be influenced by differences in film preparation and sample measurement conditions between OPV devices and CV samples. Due to the aggregated nature and the shallower HOMO level of P2, the photovoltaic properties of P2:PC71BM are limited compared to that of the P1:PC71BM mixture.

Morphological investigation of blend surfaces
The surface topographic (top) and phase images (bottom) of P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM mixtures are presented in Fig. 7, which reveal obvious differences in the surface morphologies. The surface of P1:PC71BM is relatively homogeneous, indicating a well intermixed blend of P1 and PC71BM at the film surface, while the P2:PC71BM film exhibits an uneven surface with lots of oblong shaped grains. The roughness of the two films is the same (2.2 nm). Such aggregated domains in P2:PC71BM could decrease the exciton dissociation efficiency and lead to a low JSC and PCE. The use of solvent additives may allow greater control of the morphology and photovoltaic performance of this system and a more detailed investigation to optimize device performance is currently under way.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that substitution of alkyl and aryl side chains on the carbazole moiety of push–pull conjugated polymers can affect the optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties. The absorption spectrum of the aryl-substituted polymer, P1, is red-shifted compared to P2, which indicates significantly altered ICT properties in P2. The CV measurements provide evidence that the aryl side component alters the orbital energy levels. The hole mobility of P2 obtained from FET experiments is slightly higher than that of P1. However, the aggregated nature and a slightly high HOMO level of P2 led to limited photovoltaic performance. Overall, the substituted side chains critically affect the optical, electronic and photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers; we envision that this approach can be extended to other molecular and polymeric semiconductors as well.
