    , Accepted 1st June 2020First published on 17th June 2020AbstractThe low mobility of charge carriers, high rate of electron/hole recombination, and sluggish water oxidation kinetics are the foremost drawbacks that limit the photoelectrochemical activity of hematite. Herein, a facile hydrothermal deposition method was used to incorporate Bi3+ ions into the crystal lattice of hematite to diminish the detrimental effects of those hitches. DFT simulations revealed that the Bi3+-ion incorporation into the crystal lattice of hematite is thermodynamically favorable despite it has a large ionic radius. This induces the creation of energetically shallow defect states in the bulk and thus enhances the donor density and the mobility of charge carriers. It further stabilizes the surface-defect states making them available for water oxidation. The enhancement of the donor density and the creation of surface-defect states (oxygen vacancies) were experimentally proven by electrochemical impedance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, respectively. Upon the modification with Co–Pi co-catalyst, the photocurrent density of Bi-incorporated hematite photoanodes reached an average value of 1.54 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE measured under standard solar irradiation. This value is 3.3- and 2-fold higher than those of bare and Co–Pi modified hematite photoanodes, respectively. The formed surface–defect states reduced the surface recombination and boosted the water oxidation kinetics as supported by the photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photovoltage, and transient photocurrent measurements. These results open a new avenue toward the investigation of post-transition metal elements to improve the efficiency of hematite photoanodes.
Introduction
Solar energy is the most abundant resource of energy coming to the Earth. It is renewable, inexhaustible, and clean. It gives much more energy than that required annually by the whole world. For instance, the solar radiation falling on the Earth in one hour is enough to cover the annual global energy demand in one year.1 Despite all these facts, fossil fuels are still the major sources of energy; however, their extensive consumption causes detrimental effects on the environment and their expected depletion creates an alarming situation.2 Therefore, researchers nowadays are giving more attention to developing efficient methods (e.g., photocatalytic water splitting, photo-assisted water electrolysis, and photoelectrochemical water splitting) for solar energy conversion and storage in the form of carbon-free chemical fuels (e.g., hydrogen gas).3,4 Hydrogen gas production from water using photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) ranks high among the proposed methods.5 However, to enhance the efficiency and reduce the cost of hydrogen gas production via PECs, abundant, stable, and visible-light-active photoelectrodes (either photoanodes or photocathodes) need to be discovered. The hematite photoanode fulfills a significant part of these requirements. It is cheap and abundant (6.3 wt% of the earth's crust, 4th most common element).6 It absorbs a significant portion from the solar spectrum (up to approximately 550 nm, 40% of the solar spectrum). Despite these merits, the current hematite photoanode generates a modest photocurrent under standard simulated solar light (1.0 sun, AM 1.5G), mainly because of its poor majority carrier mobility due to the formation of small polarons.7,8 In addition, it has sluggish water oxidation kinetics and a short diffusion length of the minority carriers (2–4 nm).9
To overcome these disadvantages, many strategies (e.g., doping, surface passivation, and nano-structuring) are being investigated. For instance, several studies are devoted to enhancing the efficiency of hematite photoanodes by doping with either non-metal (e.g., P10,11) or metal (e.g., Ti4+,12,13 Sn4+,14,15 Zr4+,16 Ta5+,17 and Nb4+ (ref. 18)) dopants. The dopants usually donate electrons into the neighboring Fe3+ sites and induce the formation of Fe2+ ions to keep the neutrality of the crystal. The existence of such a condition improves the electron mobility through a polaron-hopping mechanism. The creation of oxygen vacancies either by hydrogen treatment or by annealing the hematite film in an oxygen-deficient environment has also been investigated.19 It was proposed that the oxygen vacancies act as electron donors and increase the density of the generated charge carriers and thus the controlled generation of oxygen vacancies in hematite significantly enhances its photoactivity. A synergistic effect between the oxygen vacancies and the Sn dopants has been reported.20 In addition to the doping, the surface states play a vital role in the photoelectrochemical activity of hematite. Specifically, at low bias potential, the water oxidation on a hematite photoanode proceeds mainly via surface states.21–23 A high density of surface states might, however, act as recombination centers and thus reduce the generated photovoltage and limit the hematite efficiency. Activating24 or passivating the surface states25–27 is thus required to enhance the photoelectrochemical activity of hematite.
In the present work, the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the hematite crystal lattice was investigated for the first time. DFT simulations were used to explore the impact of Bi3+-ions incorporation into the bulk and surface of hematite on its fundamental properties (e.g., crystal lattice stability, electronic band structure, defect formation energies, and surface formation energies). The simulations predicted that the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the crystal lattice of hematite is favorable, although the radius of the Bi3+ ion is approx. 2-fold larger than that of Fe3+ ion.28 Moreover, the Bi3+ incorporation induces the formation of defect sites (oxygen vacancies) and thus increases the charge carrier mobility and donor density, which is in good agreement with the experimental results. The incorporation of Bi3+ stabilizes the surface states and thus makes the surface-trapped holes within these states available for the oxidation of water. As a result, the photocurrent density of bare hematite is increased from 0.46 mA cm−2 to 1.03 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE after the incorporation of Bi3+ ions. The Co–Pi modification further increased the photocurrent to reach a value of 1.54 mA cm−2 at the same applied bias potential.
Result and discussions
Characterization

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated conductive glass, bare hematite (BH), and Bi-incorporated hematite (Bi–H) films. Two characteristic diffraction peaks located at 35.4° and 64.0° (2θ) were observed. These two peaks correspond to the (110) and (300) surfaces of hematite hexagonal structure, respectively, according to the JCPDS card no. 033-0664. The rest of the peaks could be readily assigned to the FTO film coated on the top of the conductive glass (JCPDS card no. 041-1445). No characteristic diffraction peaks were observed for bismuth-based compounds, which indicates that the Bi3+ ions were more likely incorporated into the hematite hexagonal structure and/or the concentration of Bi was below the detection limit of the XRD technique. The weak intensities of the diffraction peaks from the BH and Bi–H films and their overlap with the diffraction peaks from the FTO layer impeded the unambiguous XRD analysis. Thus, the XRD patterns of the BH and Bi–H powders were also measured. The remaining precipitates after the synthesis of akaganeite (β-FeOOH) films (in the absence and presence of Bi3+ ions) were collected and heat-treated under the same conditions as for the fabricated BH and Bi–H films. As shown in Fig. S1,† all the diffraction peaks for the BH and Bi–H powders could be assigned to the hematite hexagonal structure and no peaks were observed for bismuth-based compounds. These results are in agreement with that observed for the BH and Bi–H films, supporting the assumption that Bi3+ ions are incorporated into the hematite hexagonal structure. To prove the existence of Bi and define its oxidation state, the BH and Bi–H films were analyzed by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Fig. 2a shows the high-resolution XPS spectra in the range of the Bi 4f core level. However no peaks were observed for Bi in the case of the BH film, two peaks located at 164.0 and 158.7 eV and separated by 5.3 eV were observed when the Bi–H film was analyzed.29 These two peaks could readily be assigned to the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks of Bi3+ ions, respectively, indicating that the Bi3+ ions were successfully incorporated into the hematite structure. Fig. 2b shows the XPS spectra of Fe 2p core levels in the BH and Bi–H films, depicting that the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 lines have a binding energy of 710.6 and 724.0 eV, respectively, and their spin–orbit splitting energy (ΔE) was around ∼13.4 eV, confirming the 3+ oxidation state of Fe.29Fig. 2c shows the O 1s core levels of the BH and Bi–H films. It is obvious from Fig. 2c that the main peak ascribed to the binding energy of lattice oxygen was shifted toward lower binding energy upon doping with Bi3+ ions. This is consistent with the fact that Bi3+ ion exhibits a lower electronegativity than that of Fe3+ ion and thus its incorporation into the hematite crystal lattice will reduce the electron density around O atom and hence results in a positive shift in the O 1s binding energy. The Bi–H film exhibited also a remarkable shoulder peak in the range of 530.5 to 533 eV, which could be attributed to the creation of defect sites (oxygen vacancies) in the hematite crystal lattice.24,30 The O 1s spectrum could readily be deconvoluted into three peaks located at ∼529.6, ∼531.0, and ∼532.2 eV, which could be assigned to the lattice oxygen, oxygen vacancies (O2− ions in the oxygen-deficient environment), and surface adsorbed oxygen species, respectively30,31 (see Fig. 2d for the Bi–H film and Fig. S2† for the BH film). The areas under the three peaks were calculated and are presented in Table S1.† The results reveal that the percentage of oxygen vacancies (defect sites) was increased after the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the hematite (from 24% to 29%). The treatment of hematite films under a hydrogen atmosphere led to the formation of a shoulder peak in the O 1s core level similar to that observed for the Bi–H film (see Fig. S3†). Hydrogen treatment is known to introduce oxygen vacancies into semiconductors19 and thus this observation further supports the notion that the Bi3+ incorporation into the hematite crystal structure induces the formation of oxygen vacancies. The results from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations further supported the formation of oxygen vacancies.

The β-FeOOH film consisted of nanorods grown roughly perpendicular on the FTO glass substrate and they exhibited an average diameter of approx. 50 nm and length of up to approx. 200 nm (Fig. 3a and d). After annealing, the grown nanorods were converted into rod-like particles with a diameter of up to 100 nm (Fig. 3b and e). No significant change in morphology and particle sizes of the hematite particles were observed after the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the hematite structure (Fig. 3c and f).

Donor density and flat-band potential measurements
The effects of Bi3+ ions incorporation into the hematite crystal structure on the donor density and flat-band potential were investigated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The obtained data were analyzed using the Mott–Schottky (M–S) equation (eqn (1)):32 (1)where CSC is the space charge capacitance (F cm−2), A is the real surface area of the electrode (cm2, see the Experimental section for the details of the real surface area measurements), ε is the relative dielectric constants (80 for hematite), ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 N−1 C2 m−2), q is the elementary charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), Nd is the donor density (cm−3), k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1), T is the absolute temperature (298 K), Efb is the flat-band potential and E is the applied potential in V. Fig. S4† shows the M–S plots measured in the dark for BH and Bi–H electrodes at different frequencies (i.e., 0.1, 1.0, and 10 kHz). A dispersion of the measured capacitances with changing frequencies was observed. This frequency dispersion behavior is commonly encountered due to the non-uniform distribution of donors or irregularities of the electrode surface.33,34 It was thus not possible to obtain a single value for the donor density. By investigating the log–log plot of imaginary impedance against frequency measured at 1.0 V vs. RHE as an example (Fig. S5†), a straight line with a slope of approx. −1 at 0.1 kHz and −0.5 at 1.0 kHz was observed for the BH and Bi–H electrodes. The −1 value at 0.1 kHz evinces that both electrodes presented a purely capacitive behavior and thus the M–S plot analysis at this frequency was adequate. The lower negative slope observed at 1.0 kHz and higher frequencies might be attributed to the surface irregularities, but since the BH and Bi–H electrodes exhibited almost the same slope, comparison of the results of the BH and Bi–H electrodes at 1.0 kHz is still meaningful. Since the latter frequency is commonly used in the literature, the M–S plots measured at 1.0 kHz were also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4, the M–S plots measured at 0.1 kHz for the BH and Bi–H electrodes gave straight lines with positive slopes, revealing that both electrodes exhibited n-type semiconductor characteristics and that electrons were the majority charge carriers. Based on the M–S plots presented in Fig. 4 and S4,† the donor densities for each electrode at 0.1 kHz and 1.0 kHz were calculated from the slopes obtained by linear regression fitting to eqn (1). The obtained data are presented in Table S2.† At both frequencies, the Bi–H electrode exhibited a higher donor density than that of the BH electrode. For instance, the donor density of BH calculated based on the real surface area at 0.1 kHz increased from 6.65 × 1017 cm−3 to 9.90 × 1017 cm−3 after the incorporation of Bi3+ ions. This can be attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies as revealed from the XPS analysis and DFT simulations. The flat-band potential (Efb) of BH was found to be approx. 0.6 ± 0.1 V vs. RHE, in agreement with the reported value.35 No significant shift in the flat-band potential was observed after the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the crystal lattice of hematite. These results indicate that the incorporation of Bi3+ does not alter its band-structure, rather it creates defects within its bandgap, which is in agreement with the DFT calculations presented in the next section.

DFT simulations
DFT simulations were undertaken to elucidate the impact of Bi3+-ions incorporation on the fundamental properties of hematite (i.e., stability of the crystal lattice, electronic properties, defects formation energies, and surface formation energies). Before carrying out the DFT calculations for Bi–H, the accuracy of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA+U) analysis was assessed by calculating the lattice parameters and bandgap of BH. The obtained results are presented in Table S3.† The calculated parameters matched well with the reported values.36–38 Lattice parameters within an error of less than 2% and a bandgap of 2.12 eV were achieved, confirming the validity of the GGA+U approach. The fundamental bandgap was further calculated from the difference between the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM). The energy of the VBM was calculated as the energy difference between a perfect supercell with and without a (band) hole. Similarly, the CBM was calculated as the energy difference between a perfect supercell with and without a (band) electron. A fundamental bandgap of 2.04 eV was obtained, which agrees well with the bandgap determined from the electron density of states (i.e., 2.12 eV). The incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the hematite crystal lattice slightly perturbed the crystal geometries due to its larger size than that of Fe3+; however, the optimized lattice constants remained very close to those of BH (see Table S3†). This can be understood by considering the fact that the coordination number of Bi3+ in the form of M2O3 is 4 while it is 6 for Fe3+. As a result, the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the hematite crystal lattice will not affect the crystal stability despite its large size. To further investigate this assumption, the cohesive energies of BH and Bi–H were calculated (Ecoh) using 2 × 2 × 1 supercells employing eqn (2):39 Ecoh = (Etot − (NOEO + NFeEFe))/N(2)where Etot is the total energy, NO and EO are the number and energy of oxygen atoms, respectively (EO is taken as half of the oxygen molecule energy). NFe and EFe are the number and energy of the iron atoms (taken from the unit cell calculation of Fe lattice), respectively. The calculated cohesive energy of Bi–H was found to be −0.418 eV per atom. Interestingly, this value is more negative than that of BH (i.e., −0.382 eV per atom) by 0.036 eV, revealing that the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the hematite resulted in a crystal lattice with higher stability. Fig. 5 shows the DOS of BH and Bi–H calculated using the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell and 7 × 7 × 1 kpoints. The top of the valence band in BH and Bi–H was characterized by a strong hybridization between O(2p) and Fe(3d) orbitals, while the bottom of the conduction band was mainly Fe(3d) orbitals. Minor states mainly from O(2p) within the bandgap were generated upon the incorporation of Bi3+ ions. These states could more likely be attributed to the distortion generated in the crystal lattice around the Bi3+ sites due to the difference in the coordination spheres between Bi3+ and Fe3+ ions.

Hematite is known to have intrinsic defects, commonly oxygen ion vacancies, leading to the rise of Fe2+ and thus the n-type behavior. Here, the effect of Bi3+-ions incorporation into hematite on the formation energy of the bulk defects induced by oxygen vacancies was investigated. The defect formation energy induced by one oxygen vacancy per 2 × 2 × 1 supercell was calculated as mentioned in the experimental section. The results are presented in Fig. 6a. The transition energy level between a defect in a charge q and another state in a charge q′ is defined by eqn (3):40 (3)where ΔEf(VO,q,εF = 0) is the formation energy of the oxygen vacancy VO in a charge state q, calculated for the Fermi level at the VBM, and εVO(q/q′) is the electron chemical potential at which the defect formation energies of q and q′ states cross (see Fig. 6a). The transition energy levels of (+1\+2) and (0\+1) for BH (Bi–H) were found to be 1.22 (0.001) and 1.27 (0.80) eV, respectively. Therefore, the ionization energy of the defects in Bi–H was much lower than in BH. It was even lower than thermal energy (kBT = 0.025 eV at 300 K). It seems that the Bi3+-ions incorporation into the crystal lattice of hematite resulted in the formation of energetically shallow states that could be readily ionized at room temperature, which consequently increased the mobility of charge carriers. The charge density isosurfaces shown in Fig. 6b indicate also that the generated electron/hole pair in Bi–H was to some extent more delocalized than that in BH. This delocalization supports the probability that the charge carriers in the Bi–H are more mobile than in BH. It is also important to mention that the defect formation in both materials leads to minor states within the bandgap that emerge from both O(2p) and Fe(3d) states, with the majority from Fe(3d) states (see Fig. 6c).

The effect of Bi3+ ions incorporation on the hematite surface stability, which is more relevant to the water oxidation, was estimated by calculating the surface formation energies of hematite (110) and (001) surfaces. The slabs of the above-mentioned surfaces generated from the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of hematite are shown in Fig. S6.† To generate Bi-terminated slabs, the Fe atom was replaced by a Bi atom at the same number of the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell (120 atoms). The surface formation energy (Esurf) was calculated using eqn (4):41 (4)where Eslab is the total energy of the slab, Ebulk is the total energy of the bulk supercell with the same number of atoms as in the slab, and A is the area of the slab. The surface formation energies of BH (001) and (110) surfaces were found to be 1.43 and 3.62 J m−2, respectively. Whereas the formation surface energies of Bi–H (001) and (110) surfaces were −4.08 and −6.25 J m−2, respectively. In the two slabs, the Bi-incorporated surfaces were significantly more stable than that of the pristine slabs, indicating that the incorporation of the Bi3+ ions into the hematite surface was more favorable.
In general, based on the DFT simulations, it seems that the substitution of Bi3+ ions is energetically favorable in the bulk as well as at the surface. This induces the formation of energetically shallow defects in the bulk, which facilitate the mobility of charge carriers. It also stabilizes the surface defects, thus reducing the surface recombination, and hence boosts the rate of water oxidation via surface-trapped holes, in agreement with the photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy results (shown later).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical activities of the BH and Bi–H photoanodes were measured by using the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique. Fig. 7a shows the LSV curves of Bi-incorporated hematite photoanodes prepared in the presence of different concentrations of Bi3+ ions measured in the dark and under simulated solar light (1.0 sun, AM 1.5G) in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (1.0 M). For comparison, the LSV curves for BH in the dark and under light are also included. It was found that the photocurrent density increased with increasing the Bi3+ ions concentration up to 1.0 at%, then it decreased and remained almost constant. It is known that the water oxidation on the hematite surface is very sluggish, and the modification of the surface of hematite with OER co-catalyst is always needed to facilitate the charge-transfer process at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. The optimum Bi-incorporated hematite photoanode (1.0 at% Bi) has thus been modified with the well-known cobalt-based OER co-catalyst (Co–Pi) using the photo-assisted electrochemical deposition method.42Fig. 7b shows the LSV curves of BH, Bi–H, Co–Pi/BH, and Co–Pi/Bi–H measured under standard illumination conditions. As shown in Fig. 7b, the BH photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of ∼0.46 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and the onset potential of the photocurrent (Eonset) was 0.76 VRHE measured at 0.01 mA cm−2. Upon the modification of hematite with Bi3+ ions, the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE increased and reached a value of 1.03 mA cm−2, which was 2.2 times higher than that obtained for the BH photoanode. The Eonset of Bi–H photoanodes was found to be 0.69 VRHE, which was cathodically shifted by approx. 70 mV. This cathodic shift might be attributed to the flat-band potential shift observed in the M–S plot. The modification of the Bi–H photoanode with the Co–Pi co-catalyst further enhanced the photocurrent density and reduced the overpotential of water oxidation. For instance, the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE reached ∼1.54 mA cm−2 upon the deposition of Co–Pi and the Eonset was shifted by 170 mV relative to that of the BH electrode. This photocurrent value was 2.0 times higher than that of the Co–Pi-modified BH photoanode. The applied bias photon-to-current efficiencies (ABPE%) for the employed photoanodes were calculated according to eqn (5) assuming a faradaic efficiency equal to one and the results are presented in Fig. 7c.43 (5)where jphoto is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) measured in a two-electrode cell configuration, V is the applied bias potential measured against a Pt counter electrode, and Plight is the light intensity (100 mW cm−2). The Co–Pi modified Bi–H photoanodes exhibited a maximum ABPE value of 0.67%. This ABPE value was approx. 1.40-fold higher than that of Bi–H (i.e., 0.48%) and 2.8-fold higher than that of BH (i.e., 0.24%). The enhanced ABPE value observed after Co–Pi loading onto the hematite photoanode is usually attributed to the reduction of the surface recombination and the acceleration of water oxidation kinetics.44 The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE%) were also calculated using eqn (6),34 and are presented in Fig. 7d. (6)where jphoto and Plight are the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and light intensity (mW cm−2), respectively, and λ is the wavelength of the incident light (nm). As for the case of ABPE, the Co–Pi/Bi–H photoanodes showed the highest conversion efficiency. It had an IPCE value of 11.60% at 430 nm. To investigate the stability of the Bi–H photoanode, a long-term chronoamperometry test was performed. A stable photocurrent response was observed confirming the stability of the Bi–H photoanode (Fig. S7†).

Illumination conditions: AM 1.5 G 1.0 sun (a–c) and monochromatic light (d); electrolyte: 1.0 M aqueous solution of NaOH. The relative standard deviations of the IPCE values are less than 3.0%. 
The enhancement in the photocurrent observed after the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the hematite photoanode can either be attributed to the passivation effect or to the improved charge-carrier mobility and the creation of active surface states for water oxidation as predicted by DFT simulations. To investigate which assumption is valid, the transient photocurrent (TPC) response for the BH and Bi–H photoanodes were measured and are presented in Fig. 8a. In general, the TPC response has a characteristic decay from a spike to steady-state after illumination, which is further followed by an overshoot and decay back to zero during the dark time interval.45 As both materials showed n-type characteristic properties (see Fig. 4), this spike is generally ascribed to the photogenerated holes that can accumulate and get trapped in the surface states. Subsequently, the steady-state photocurrent is reached due to the rate for holes transfer to the surface becoming equal to the interfacial charge-carrier recombination and transfer. The amount of trapped and accumulated holes and the density of surface states are thus proportional to the area under the spike peak and can be calculated by the integration of the area under the spike. The amounts of the trapped photogenerated holes within the surface states on the BH and Bi–H photoanodes were calculated and found to be 12.9 ± 0.9 and 14.3 ± 1.0 μC cm−2, respectively. The comparable values observed for both photoanodes indicate that bismuth does not form a passivation layer, instead, it enhances the density of surface states. Indeed, the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into the hematite lattice induces the creation of oxygen vacancies, as predicted from the M–S analysis and DFT simulations. These surface states seem to be responsible for boosting the water oxidation on the Bi–H photoanode surface. They accelerate the rate of water oxidation at low overpotential and facilitate the charge-transfer kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. To further confirm this finding, the open circuit potentials of the BH and Bi–H photoanodes were measured and are presented in Fig. 8b. The difference between the OCP measured in the dark and under illumination gives the generated photovoltage (Vphoto). Usually, the passivation of the surface states leads to a significant increase in the Vphoto. However, as shown in Fig. 8b, photovoltage values of 120.0 ± 6.0 and 150.0 ± 8.0 mV were measured for BH and Bi–H photoanodes, respectively. No significant difference was thus observed, indicating that the Bi3+ ions are more likely act as dopants not as a passivation layer and they induce the formation of stable defect states.

Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements
The effect of Bi3+-ions incorporation into the hematite crystal lattice on the kinetics of charge transfer and recombination at the electrode/electrolyte surface was investigated by photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). Fig. 9a and b show the Nyquist plots of the BH and Bi–H photoanodes, respectively, measured at different potentials. Two main observations can readily be drawn from Fig. 9: (i) the charge-transfer resistance is greatly reduced upon the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into hematite. For instance, at 0.9 V vs. RHE, the charge-transfer resistance of BH was found to be approx. 8 kΩ and it decreased to approx. 3.5 kΩ after the modification with Bi3+ ions. This indicates that the incorporation of Bi3+ ions facilitates the water oxidation reaction; (ii) the Nyquist plots of the BH and Bi–H photoanodes consist of two semicircles. One at low frequencies, which represents the charge transfer via the surface states, while the other one at high frequencies is associated with the electron trapping/de-trapping and the ratios between the diameters of the two semicircles are significantly different (see Fig. 9c). According to the Bisquert model,46 the ratio between the recombination resistance (R1) and the charge transfer resistance (R2) shown in the equivalent circuit (EC) presented in Fig. 9d gives the relative ratio between the rate of charge transfer (ks) and recombination (εn) according to eqn (7):46 (7)where γ is a factor determined by the voltage and the trap depth, which takes a value between 0 and 1. At zero bias, it depends mainly on the trap depth in the bandgap. Under applied bias potential, it goes to 1. By fitting the PEIS spectra with the EC presented in Fig. 9d, the solution resistance (Rs), the recombination resistance (R1), the charge transfer resistance (R2), the surface state capacitance (Css), and the total capacitance of the interfacial double layer (Ctotal) were obtained. The latter comprises the contributions from the Helmholtz capacitance and space charge layer capacitance and strongly depends on the morphology and the properties of the electrode surface as well as the electrolyte. The obtained PEIS fitting parameters are presented in Tables S4 and S5† and illustrated in Fig. 9e and f. Fig. 9e shows that the Bi–H photoelectrode exhibits higher values of Css at low bias potential, indicating that the incorporation of Bi3+ ions into hematite induces the formation of surface states. By increasing the applied positive bias, the Css of the Bi–H photoanode becomes comparable to that of the BH photoanode, then it decreases. This indicates that the surface states in the Bi–H electrode can be readily activated at a lower bias potential for water oxidation.23 By calculating the R1/R2 ratio (Fig. 9f), it was found that the Bi–H photoanode exhibited a higher value than that of BH, indicating that the relative ratio between charge transfer and recombination on the Bi–H is higher than that on the BH photoanode. This again confirms that the created surface states after the modification of hematite with Bi3+ ions boost the kinetics of water oxidation on the hematite surface. The higher R1/R2 ratio observed for Bi–H photoanodes at a high positive bias (i.e., 1.1 V vs. RHE) despite it exhibiting a higher charge-transfer resistance than the BH photoanode (see Fig. S8 and Tables S4 and S5†) indicates that the Bi-incorporation into hematite reduces the surface recombination and thus enhances the photocurrent response.

Conclusions
In conclusion, Bi-incorporated hematite photoanodes were readily synthesized. DFT simulations revealed that, while the radius of the Bi3+ ion was approx. 2-fold larger than that of Fe3+ ion, the incorporation of Bi3+ into the hematite crystal lattice was thermodynamically favorable. The lower coordination number of Bi3+ (i.e., 4) than that of Fe3+ (i.e., 6) compensates for the crystal lattice instability due to the difference in the radius. The DFT simulations revealed also that the Bi3+-ion incorporation into the bulk of hematite creates shallow oxygen defect states, which are readily ionizable; and therefore, enhance the donor density and the charge-carrier mobility. The calculation of the surface formation energies of (001) and (110) surfaces for bare and Bi-incorporated hematite indicate that the Bi-incorporated surfaces are significantly more stable than the pristine surfaces. Incorporating Bi3+ ions into the hematite surfaces stabilizes the surface-defect states and thereby activates them for water oxidation. In good agreement with the DFT results, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Mott–Schottky plot analysis proved the creation of oxygen vacancies and the enhancement of the donor density, respectively. The transient photocurrent, photovoltage, and photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements confirmed that the Bi3+-ions incorporation into hematite photoanodes boosts the efficiency of water oxidation via the surface-defect states. This study presents that the incorporation of a large cation like Bi3+ into the crystal lattice of hematite is possible and it enhances the photoelectrochemical efficiency and this approach can be extended for other photoanodes.
Experimental methods
Synthesis of bare and Bi-incorporated hematite photoanodes
A hydrothermal deposition method was employed to synthesize bare hematite (BH) and Bi-incorporated hematite (Bi–H) photoanodes on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass.47 The FTO substrates were first cleaned with detergent and then sonicated in distilled water, acetone, and ethanol for 10 min in each step. After that, the FTO substrates were vertically placed in a 15 mL vial containing 0.15 mol L−1 FeCl3·6H2O and the desired amount of BiNO3 dissolved in 0.1 M HNO3. The total volume of the solution was 5 mL and the concentration of Bi3+ ions was calculated to be 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 at%. The vial was then sealed with an autoclavable cap and placed into an oven pre-adjusted at 95 °C for 6 h. After natural cooling, the grown uniform akaganeite yellow films on the FTO substrates were rinsed with water to remove the extra inorganic salts. The films were then naturally dried in air and calcined at 550 °C for 1 h and 800 °C for 20 min. Bare hematite films were prepared similarly without adding Bi3+ ions into the chemical bath.
The loading of the BH and Bi–H photoanodes with a Co–Pi co-catalyst was carried out by using the photo-assisted electrodeposition technique as previously reported.42 The deposition was carried out at a potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 15 s from an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 (0.5 mM) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7). The effects of the deposition time and potential are presented in Fig. S9 and S10,† respectively.
Characterization
The morphology of the synthesized BH and Bi–H films was characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (TESCAN) operated at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. A Rigaku X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ=0.154 nm) X-ray radiation source was used for the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The XRD patterns were recorded from 2θ = 20° to 70° with a scan rate of 1.0 degree per min. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out by using an ESCALAB™ Xi+ X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a monochromatic micro-focused Al Kα as an X-ray source. The XPS spectra were calibrated by taking the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV as a reference.
Density functional theory simulations
All the density functional theory (DFT) simulations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)48,49 with the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials (PAW)50 and the periodic boundary conditions. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–pack gamma centered mesh,51 and a Gaussian smearing of 0.05 eV was used for the occupations of the electronic levels. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)52 functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to describe the electron interaction energy of exchange-correlation. The electronic energies were converged within the limit of 10−7 eV and the cutoff of 520 eV was used. All the geometries were optimized using the 0.01 eV Å−1 force criteria. All the calculations were spin-polarized. All the DFT simulations were performed using GGA+U formalism to describe the strong on-site Coulomb interactions based on Dudraev et al.'s approach,53 which involved one parameter called the effective U (U–J), where U is the on-site Coulomb repulsion and J is the on-site Hund exchange coupling. The U parameter was set at 5.2 eV in all simulations, which gave a bandgap of 2.12 eV and a magnetic moment of 4.28 μB.54
Defect formation energy calculation
In this calculation, a single vacancy in the BH and Bi–H hematite electrodes was simulated using a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell consisting of 120-atoms with different charge states. Defect formation energies were calculated based on eqn (8): Ef = Etot(defect:q) − Etot(prefect) − nFeμFe − nOμO + q(εF + EVBM)(8)where Etot (defect:q) and Etot (perfect) are the total energies of a supercell with and without a defect in a charge state q, respectively; nFeμFe, and nOμO are the number of iron and oxygen atoms removed from the supercell to introduce the defect multiplied by their atomic chemical potentials, respectively; εF is the Fermi level; and EVBM is the top of the valence band in the un-defected supercell. Only an oxygen vacancy was considered and the variations of q were from 0 to +2.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed by using the Autolab PGSTAT302N potentiostat in a three-electrode configuration. A hematite photoanode with 0.25 cm2 geometrical area was used as a working electrode, and platinum wire and Hg/HgO (1.0 M NaOH) were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. An aqueous solution of 1.0 M NaOH was used as the electrolyte. A photoelectrochemical cell made from Teflon and adapted with a quartz window on one side was employed for the photoelectrochemical measurements. The simulated solar light was obtained by using 1002 SunLite™ Solar Simulators (ABET Technologies). The light intensity of the simulated light was adjusted to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using a calibrated silicon reference cell (ABET Technologies). The potential measured against the Hg/HgO reference electrodes was converted into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using eqn (9): (9)where the standard potential of Hg/HgO (1.0 M NaOH) is 0.118 V and the pH of 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte is 13.6.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements
To calculate the IPCE, the chronopotentiometry responses for the BH, Bi–H, and Co-Pi/Bi–H photoanodes were measured at 1.23 VRHE under collimated monochromatic light with different wavelengths. The light sources were high-power LEDs (Thorlabs) and the light intensity was calculated using a calibrated Si photodiode (FDS100-CAL, Thorlabs).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements
The EIS measurements were performed employing the same electrochemical setup except that a Biologic VS300 potentiostat was used. Nyquist plots were measured at different applied potentials with the frequency range being modulated between 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at an amplitude-frequency of 10 mV under standard illumination conditions. The EIS spectra were fitted to the appropriate electrical circuit using the Z Fit tool embedded in EC-Lab software (Biologic). Mott–Schottky plots were examined at frequencies of 0.1, 1.0, and 10 kHz in a potential window ranging from 0.6 to 1.6 V vs. RHE in the dark. A series combination of a resistor and a capacitance were used for the space charge layer capacitance (Csc) estimation. Assuming that Csc is much smaller than the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), the contribution of the Cdl to the total capacitance will be negligible, and thus, the capacitance calculated using eqn (10) is equivalent to the Csc. (10)where Im(Z) is the imaginary component of the impedance (Ohm), f is the frequency (Hz), and C is the capacitance (F). According to this equation, the plot of log(Im(Z)) against log(f) is expected to give a negative slope equal to 1.0 for pure capacitance.
Real surface area measurements
The real surface area was determined by using cyclic voltammetry measurements.55–57 Cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves were recorded at different scan rates at a potential window close to the open circuit potential of the BH and Bi–H electrodes and are presented in Fig. S11.† Assuming that the double layer charging is the only process, the plot of the capacitive current at the middle of the CV curves against the scan rate will give a straight line with a slope equal to the double-layer capacitance (Cdl, see Fig. S12†). The real (electrochemical) surface area (Areal) was then calculated by dividing the estimated Cdl by the areal double-layer capacitance of a smooth hematite single-crystal in alkaline medium (pH 12.0) reported by Shimizu et al.56 (i.e., ∼0.55 μF cm−2) according to eqn (11). The roughness factor (RF) defined as the real surface area divided by the geometrical surface area was then calculated by eqn (12).58 (11) (12)where Ageometrical is the geometrical surface area (0.25 cm2). The RFs of the BH and Bi–H electrodes were found to be approx. 8.4 and 9.2, respectively. Real surface areas of 2.1 and 2.3 cm2 were used in the calculation of the donor densities for the BH and Bi–H electrodes, respectively.
