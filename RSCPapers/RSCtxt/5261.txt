The structure, crystallinity, morphology, and other properties of the as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

1. Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has attracted intensive research interest during the past decades on account of its wide range of applications in photocatalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), lithium ion batteries, sensors and biomedical treatments.1–6 Particularly, anatase TiO2 with tailored facets has clearly been one of the hottest research topics among various metal oxides in the past few years.7–10 Since anatase TiO2 enclosed by 47% {001} and 53% {101} facets was successfully synthesized by Yang et al.11 in 2008, developing TiO2 with specific facets as well as a higher percentage of exposed {001} facets has become highly desirable and popular. Most studies on photocatalytic hydrogen and decomposition of organic pollutants present the consistent conclusion that the photocatalytic activities of anatase crystals are highly boosted with increased percentages of exposed {001} facets. For example, Han et al.12 showed that the photocatalytic degradation percentage of methylene blue increased from 46% to 59%, 73% and 98% with the increased percentage of the anatase {001} facet from nearly 0% to 5%, 20% and 60%. However, some photocatalytic hydrogen or OH radical generation studies on facet dependent photocatalytic activities showed quite complex trends. One remarkable example by Pan et al.13 reported that micrometer-sized anatase crystals with percentages of 24% {001} and 76% {101} facets exhibit higher photoreactivity in both hydrogen and OH radical generation than those with percentages of 40% {001} and 60% {101} facets. In contrast to the conventional understanding, Gordon et al.14 demonstrated a ca. 8 times higher photocatalytic hydrogen generation reactivity of 1 wt% Pt-loaded anatase nanocrystals with {101} dominant facets than that with {001} dominant facets. Besides, Yu et al.15 proposed a new “surface heterojunction” to explain the difference in the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 with coexposed {001} and {101} facets, finding that the optimal ratio of the exposed {101} and {001} facets was determined to be 45:55.
Moreover, Ti3+ doping is deemed as one of the alternative methods to solve the shortcomings of crystalline anatase TiO2 (i.e., little visible light absorption for photocatalysis and rapid recombination rates of photo-induced charge carriers). Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanomaterials apparently have demonstrated excellent optical, chemical and electronic properties according to literature studies reported elsewhere.16–19 For example, Yang et al.20 showed black Ti3+-doped rutile TiO2 nanoparticles from Al reduction with improved photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance under both UV and visible-light irradiation. Zuo et al.21 synthesized partially Ti3+-doped rutile TiO2 with active facets by a facile solution method. This highly stable photocatalyst exhibited highly improved photocatalytic efficiency of water reduction compared with irregularly shaped nanoparticles.
In the past few years, unprecedented progress in the controllable synthesis of faceted TiO2 crystals has provided new insights and opportunities for constructing higher performance materials by finely tuning their surface and interfacial properties. Besides, Ti3+-doped TiO2 further provides a method which not only boosts light absorption but also provides higher solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, which can be applied as both an excellent photocatalyst and photoelectrochemical electrode. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies on Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 with well-defined exposed facets especially the synergistic effects between Ti3+ doping and facet regulation over the corresponding photocatalytic activity have been reported.
Herein, we have used an aluminum reduction method to prepare Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanosheets with tunable percentages of exposed {001} facets. Variable Ti3+ concentration of the as-prepared Al-reduced TiO2 along with the tunable percentage of exposed {001} facets is observed. Moreover, all the reduced TiO2 nanosheets exhibit enhanced photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties compared with the non-reduced ones. Among the reduced TiO2 nanosheets, Al-TiO2-HF6 shows the most excellent photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photoreactivity is mainly ascribed to the efficient transport and separation of charge carriers resulting from the synergistic effect between Ti3+ doping and facet modification.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 nanosheets
TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets were prepared by a hydrothermal method similar to that reported elsewhere. In a typical experimental procedure, 25 mL of Ti(OC4H9)4 and 6 mL of hydrofluoric acid solution (with a concentration ca. 40 wt%) were mixed in a dried Teflon-lined autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL at ambient temperature, followed by hydrothermal treatment of the mixture at 180 °C for 24 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the white precipitate was separated by high-speed centrifugation, washed with ethanol and distilled water three times, and then dried in an oven at 70 °C for 6 h. The obtained pristine TiO2 samples were further calcined at 450 °C in air for 6 h and denoted as Air-TiO2-HF4.5, Air-TiO2-HF6 and Air-TiO2-HF9 according to the volume of hydrofluoric acid added to the reaction system.
2.2 Preparation of Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanocrystals
Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanosheets were prepared by molten Al reduction reported according to the literature. In detail, the Al powders and pristine TiO2 were separately placed in an evacuated two-zone furnace at 800 °C (molten Al) and 450 °C (TiO2) for 6 h under a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa. The as-prepared Ti3+-doped TiO2 is denoted as Al-TiO2-HF4.5, Al-TiO2-HF6 and Al-TiO2-HF9. For comparison, commercial anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (the average particle size is about 60 nm, Aladdin, denoted as TiO2(A)) were also calcined at 450 °C in air and an Al steam atmosphere for 6 h and denoted as Air-TiO2(A) and Al-TiO2(A), respectively.
2.3 Photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photocatalytic hydrogen production was examined in a Pyrex top-irradiation type reaction vessel connected to a closed gas circulation system. Before irradiation, the reaction system was evacuated to ensure complete air removal and then irradiated from the top side using a 300 W xenon lamp. A flow of cooling water was used to keep the reaction suspension at room temperature. The photocatalyst, 0.1 g, was dispersed in 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 90 mL of deionized water, 10 mL of absolute methanol (as the sacrificial reagent) and 0.5 ml 1 wt% chloroplatinic acid aqueous solution. Before irradiation, the photocatalysts were completely dispersed by sonication treatment for 30 s. Gas chromatography (Agilent; GC-7890A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar carrier) was used to analyse the evolved gases. Similarly, visible light-induced photocatalytic H2 production experiments were conducted using a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 400 nm cutoff filter under the same procedure.
2.4 Photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO)
MO was employed as a representative pollutant to investigate the photocatalytic properties of the prepared TiO2 samples. A 100 mL MO solution with an initial concentration of 20 mg L−1 was mixed in the presence of the catalyst (0.1 g). Before light irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure that adsorption–desorption equilibrium was achieved. Then, the reaction system was irradiated with a 300 W Xe arc lamp providing ultraviolet-visible light. The concentration of MO remaining in the solution was monitored using a UV-vis spectrometer at 464 nm. Similarly, visible light photocatalytic decomposition experiments of MO were conducted using the 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 400 nm cutoff filter under the same procedure.
In the stability test of Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheets in the photodegradation of MO under UV-vis light, five consecutive cycles were tested. After each cycle, the catalyst was isolated by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with water, and then fresh MO solution was added to the catalyst.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical performance
The photoelectric conversion properties of the photocatalyst were investigated using a conventional three-electrode cell with a computer-controlled electrochemical workstation (CHI 650A). First, 50 mg catalyst was suspended in 2 mL of ethyl alcohol and the mixture was ultrasonically treated for 10 min to form a homogeneous suspension. Then, 0.5 mL of the photocatalyst suspension was syringe coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (1 cm × 4.0 cm). After evaporation of the alcohol in air, the catalyst was attached to the FTO glass surface. The FTO glass, a Pt wire, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and KOH (1 mol L−1) were used as the working electrode, counter-electrode, reference electrode, and electrolyte, respectively. Current–time (i–t) curves were collected at 0.3 V vs. SCE. The light source was a 300 W Xe lamp providing UV-visible light irradiation.
2.6 Characterization
The morphology of the samples was observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; JSM-6701F, JEOL) operated at an accelerating voltage of 5.00 kV and equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted with a JEM-1200EX electron microscope using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on an X'Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40 keV and 40 mA. The XRD patterns were recorded from 10° to 70° with a scanning rate of 0.067° s−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB250Xi photoelectron spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray excitation source to analyze the elemental composition of the samples. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer at room temperature. EPR measurements were carried out using a JES-FA200 spectrometer/X-band at room temperature with an X-band frequency of 9219.77 MHz, a sweep width of 500.0 mT, and a center field of 500.0 mT. Nitrogen-adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded on an ASAP 2020 M (Micromeritics Instruments, USA) nitrogen-adsorption apparatus. All of the samples were degassed at 80 °C prior to Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements. The BET specific surface area (SBET) was determined by a multipoint BET method by using the adsorption data within the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.3. Pore-size distribution was derived from a desorption branch by a Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The nitrogen-adsorption volume at P/P0 = 0.97 was used to determine the pore volume and average pore size.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the corresponding high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the as-prepared Al-reduced TiO2 nanosheet samples prepared with different volumes of HF. As shown in Fig. 1A for the Al-TiO2-HF4.5 sample, a large amount of nanosheets with a side length of ca. 40–50 nm and a thickness of ca. 7.2 nm can be clearly observed. Moreover, the HRTEM image (Fig. 1B) directly shows that the lattice spacing parallel to the top and bottom facets is ca. 0.235 nm, corresponding to the (001) planes of anatase TiO2, which indicates that the top and bottom facets of the nanosheets are the (001) planes.22,23 As for Al-TiO2-HF6 (Fig. 1C) and Al-TiO2-HF9 (Fig. 1E), well-defined sheet-shaped structures with average side sizes of about 120–150 nm and 50–60 nm are observed, respectively. Besides, along the direction of the [001] crystal axis, the thickness of the prepared TiO2 becomes much smaller (as shown in Fig. 1D and F, the thickness of Al-TiO2-HF6 and Al-TiO2-HF9 is 5.9 and 5.1 nm, respectively), which indicates that the percentage of the {001} facet becomes bigger with the increase of HF volume.10,15 Here, it should be emphasized that {001} facets and {001} facet exposure are two distinct concepts, although each of them is of great importance in promoting the photocatalytic efficiency. Despite the thickness of Al-TiO2-HF9 nanosheets (5.1 nm) being smaller than that of Al-TiO2-HF6 nanosheets (5.9 nm), their agglomeration phenomenon related to the oriented attachment process along the [001] direction during the calcination process in an Al atmosphere is also obvious. Thus, Al-TiO2-HF9 is likely to possess a lower percentage of exposed {001} facets compared with that of Al-TiO2-HF6. Moreover, the detailed structural information of Al-reduced TiO2 nanosheet samples is summarized, as can be seen in Table S1.† For comparison, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pristine Air-TiO2-HF4.5, 6, and 9 are also provided (shown in Fig. S1A–C†).
 Fig. 1  TEM (A, C and E) and HRTEM (B, D and F) images of Al-TiO2-HF4.5, Al-TiO2-HF6 and Al-TiO2-HF9 samples, respectively. 
As can be seen from the X-ray power diffraction (XRD) patterns illustrated in Fig. 2A, the strong diffraction peaks indicate that both pristine and Al-reduced TiO2 remain highly crystalline. All the TiO2 nanosheet samples before and after Al reduction exhibit pure anatase TiO2 with a tetragonal structure24,25 (space group I41/amd, a = b = 3.782 Å, c = 9.502 Å). The peaks at 25.25, 37.72, 48.03, 53.91 and 54.99° can be ascribed to the (101), (004), (200), (105), and (211) crystal planes of anatase TiO2, respectively. In addition, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was applied to provide the variation of optical absorption properties for the prepared TiO2 nanosheets before and after Al reduction, as shown in Fig. 2B. All the reduced TiO2 samples show enhanced light absorption intensity in the range of both ultraviolet and visible light compared with that of the pristine ones, which implies that the Ti3+ species may be responsible for the enhanced visible-light absorption.26,27 Besides, compared with the TiO2 nanosheet samples calcined in air, the absorption margin of Al-reduced TiO2 becomes steep and moves to longer wavelengths, which means that the optical bandgap decreases as well (see the Kubelka–Munk function plot versus photon energy in Fig. S2A–C†).
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns (A) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (B) of the prepared TiO2 before and after Al reduction. 
To detect the generation of the Ti3+ species during the Al reduction process, electron spin resonance (EPR) measurement of the prepared TiO2 nanosheets is used and the results are shown in Fig. 3A. The observed peak at g = 1.993 for all the Al-reduced TiO2 with different percentages of exposed {001} facets is characteristic of the paramagnetic Ti3+ center.28,29 The EPR data also indicate that there is no Ti3+ present on the surface of the prepared samples since surface Ti3+ would tend to adsorb atmospheric O2, which would be reduced to O2− showing an EPR signal at g ≈ 2.02.30 Moreover, the peak intensity of Ti3+ species for reduced TiO2 is rather different. Specifically, the intensity of the Ti3+ characteristic peak initially increases and then decreases with increasing amount of HF. The Ti3+ concentration is rather different among Al-reduced TiO2 nanosheets resulting from different percentages of exposed {001} facets, which is closely related to their geometrical structure. Among the reduced TiO2 nanosheets, Al-TiO2-HF6 shows the strongest Ti3+ signal, suggesting that this sample has the highest Ti3+ concentration. In contrast, no paramagnetic signals were observed for Air-TiO2-HF6, as shown in Fig. 3B.

The corresponding Ti 2p and O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of prepared TiO2 are shown in Fig. S3.† All the TiO2 samples before Al reduction exhibit typical Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 XPS peaks centered at binding energies of 458.89 and 464.62 eV. However, both the two Ti 2p XPS peaks of Al-reduced TiO2 nanosheets move to lower binding energies of 458.68 and 464.40 eV, further suggesting the partial reduction of TiO2 with the formation of Ti3+ in the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets.31–33 Moreover, all the O 1s peaks centered at 530.05 eV for Ti3+-doped TiO2 move to a lower binding energy of 529.87 eV. In addition, the X-ray photoelectron spectrum of F 1s for the prepared TiO2 nanosheets is presented (Fig. S4†). All the samples exhibit relatively weak F 1s peaks centered at 684.47 eV, which is a typical value for the surface Ti–F species. The existence of Ti–F species is reasonable since fluorinated surfaces of anatase single crystals cannot easily be made clean at such lower temperatures according to literature studies reported elsewhere.11 Also, the XPS spectra show no signals of Al element for the as-prepared Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheets by Al reduction, as can be seen from Fig. S5.†
Moreover, the photocatalytic H2 production performance under UV-vis light irradiation over the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheet samples is systematically investigated (Fig. 4). As is shown in Fig. 4A, all the reduced TiO2 nanosheets show enhanced photocatalytic H2 production compared with the non-reduced ones, highlighting the effect of Ti3+ doping towards the photocatalytic activity of the prepared TiO2 nanosheets. Among them, Al-TiO2-HF6 shows the most excellent photocatalytic performance with a H2 evolution rate of 1354 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 1.38 times higher than that of pristine Air-TiO2-HF6 (Fig. 4B). Moreover, photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) under UV-vis light irradiation was also performed to investigate the effects of the Ti3+ doping as well as facet regulation over the prepared TiO2 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. S6.† For the non-reduced TiO2 nanosheets, by increasing the HF amount from 4.5 to 6 ml, the photocatalytic degradation activity gradually increased, indicating that a relatively higher amount of {001} facets is responsible for the enhancement of the photocatalytic degradation of MO. However, further increasing of the HF amount (9 ml) caused decreased photocatalytic activity due to its lower {001} facet exposure resulting from heavy agglomeration. Besides, all the Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheet samples showed a higher photodegradation rate of MO than the non-reduced TiO2 under ultraviolet-visible light irradiation. Among the samples after Al reduction, the Al-TiO2-HF6 sample showed the highest photocatalytic degradation activity, which was mainly due to the synergistic effects of Ti3+ doping and facet modulation. To make this point of synergistic effects between Ti3+ and the crystal facet clearer, photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants (MO) under UV-vis light irradiation for Air-TiO2(A) and Al-TiO2(A) nanoparticles was also performed, as shown in Fig. S7.† Although Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanoparticles showed a higher photodegradation rate for MO than the pure anatase TiO2 under UV-visible-light irradiation, their photodegradation rate for MO was far lower than that of Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheets (the photocatalytic activity of Al-TiO2-HF6 almost completely degraded MO only in 60 min, while during the same period only 35% of MO was photodegraded by Al-TiO2(A)).
 Fig. 4  Photocatalytic H2 production (A) and its corresponding H2 evolution rates (B) for TiO2 nanosheet samples under UV-vis light irradiation. 
Moreover, photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) is systematically examined, as shown in Fig. S8.† As for the non-reduced TiO2 nanosheets, only a small amount of H2 can be detected after visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) (Fig. S8A†), indicating weak visible light-induced activity of the Air-TiO2 nanosheets. However, Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheets after Al reduction exhibit enhanced photocatalytic H2 production (Fig. S8B and C†) compared with the non-reduced ones, showing that Ti3+ doping is beneficial to the improvement of hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. Although the Ti3+-doped TiO2 samples exhibited enhanced visible light-induced H2 evolution rates, their hydrogen production capacity (as for Al-TiO2-HF6, the amount of H2 produced within 5 hours reaches 95.7 μmol) is far less than their UV-vis light-induced hydrogen production capacity (as for Al-TiO2-HF6, the amount of H2 produced within 5 hours reaches 6800 μmol). It is believed that the introduced localized defect states with energies from 0.75 to 1.18 eV below the conduction band minimum of TiO2 are lower than the redox potential for hydrogen evolution, which, in combination with the low electron mobility in the bulk region due to this localization, makes the photocatalytic activity of the reduced TiO2 negligible.34,35 Similarly, visible-light photocatalytic decomposition experiments of MO were conducted using a 400 nm cutoff filter, and the results are shown in Fig. S9.† Despite enhanced solar absorption, the Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheets display insufficient photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation, similar to black TiO2 reported elsewhere.36 Enhanced wide-spectrum light absorption of the Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheets can produce extra light-excited electrons and holes and cause better UV light photocatalytic activity than pristine TiO2 nanosheets, but their visible-light photocatalysis was still insufficient. Furthermore, the Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheets still retained excellent photocatalytic activities in five cycles as shown in Fig. S10,† indicating relatively excellent stability of the as-prepared Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheets.
Moreover, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheet samples is studied by measuring photocurrent density–potential (J–V) curves using a standard three-electrode configuration under UV-vis light illumination (Fig. S11A†). It can be seen that all the reduced TiO2 nanosheets show enhanced photocurrent density compared with the non-reduced ones, indicating that Ti3+ doping can enhance the photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2. Moreover, as for the non-reduced TiO2 nanosheets, Air-TiO2-HF6 exhibits the most excellent PEC activity compared with Air-TiO2-HF4.5 and 9, indicating that the percentage of exposed {001} facets also plays a vital role in the PEC performance since the optimal ratio of the exposed {101} and {001} facets favors the efficient separation and transport of photo-induced charge carriers. Moreover, the synergistic effects of facet modulation and Ti3+ doping towards the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheet samples have also been evaluated from the chronoamperometric I–t curves under UV-visible light illumination at a constant potential of 0.3 V versus SCE (Fig. S11B†). Specifically, Al-TiO2-6 showed the highest photocurrent density, up to 48 mA cm2 at 0.3 V vs. SCE, as compared to Al (Air)-TiO2-HF4.5, and Al (Air)-TiO2-HF9 samples. In addition, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution plot calculated from the adsorption branch of the N2 isotherms were investigated (shown in Fig. S12†). All the curves can be classified as type IV isotherms which are characteristic of mesoporous materials with the presence of a hysteresis loop in the relative-pressure range of 0.6–1.0. The specific surface areas and average pore diameters of the synthesized TiO2 are also summarized and shown in Table S2.† Particularly, the BET specific surface areas of Al-TiO2-HF4.5 (49.86 m2 g−1), Al-TiO2-HF6 (26.45 m2 g−1) and Al-TiO2-HF9 (39.61 m2 g−1) are different. Among the reduced TiO2 nanosheets, Al-TiO2-HF4.5 has the maximum surface area but not the most excellent photocatalytic H2 production, therefore the photocatalytic difference of the samples should not come from the surface area variation.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can provide information on charge transfer and recombination processes at semiconductor–electrolyte interfaces. As shown in Fig. 5 for the Nyquist plots of the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheet samples, all the arc radii of the reduced TiO2 nanosheets are smaller than those of the non-reduced ones, indicating that Ti3+ doping is favorable for efficient transport of charge carriers in TiO2 nanosheets. Moreover, Al-TiO2-HF6 exhibits a minimal arc radius, which further indicates the synergistic effects of facet modulation and Ti3+ doping on the transport of photo-induced charge carriers. Besides, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was used to further study the effect of facet regulation and Ti3+ doping on the charge separation for the prepared TiO2 samples. Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra of TiO2 nanosheet samples before and after Al reduction with an excitation wavelength of 253 nm. All the TiO2 nanosheets exhibit a strong PL signal peak centered at 392 nm, which is attributed to band–band PL. According to the PL attributes, the band–band PL spectrum can directly reflect the separation situation of photo-induced charge carriers, viz., the stronger the band–band PL signal, the higher the recombination rate of photo-induced charge carriers.37,38 Among the TiO2 samples, Al-TiO2-HF6 shows the weakest intensity, suggesting the robust separation of photo-induced charge carriers. The intensity order of the as-prepared TiO2 samples is as follows: Air-TiO2-HF9 > Al-TiO2-HF9 > Air-TiO2-HF4.5 > Al-TiO2-HF4.5 > Air-TiO2-HF6 > Al-TiO2-HF6, which is in good accordance with their photocatalytic activity.

4. Conclusions
Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanosheet samples with tunable exposed {001} facets were synthesized by an Al reduction method. All the resulting Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanosheets exhibit efficient transport and separation of photo-induced charge carriers and therefore enhanced photocatalytic H2 production, degradation of MO and PEC performance compared with pristine TiO2 nanosheets under UV-vis light irradiation. Only the Al-TiO2-HF6 sample with the highest Ti3+ concentration and the optimal percentage of exposed {001} facets exhibits the most excellent photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance resulting from the robust separation and transport of photo-induced charge carriers. Hopefully, this study is expected to highlight the synergistic effects between Ti3+ doping and facet regulation towards the photocatalytic activity of Ti3+-doped TiO2 nanosheets, providing new insights into rational design of more efficient TiO2-based photocatalysts.
