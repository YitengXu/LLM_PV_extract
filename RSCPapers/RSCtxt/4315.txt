    , Accepted 13th April 2018First published on 16th April 2018AbstractWe report on a set of two analogous, F-substituted oligothiophene derivatives (D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M), in which systematic fluorination at the thienyl moieties is shown to induce a sufficient increase in electron affinity (EA; i.e. suppressed LUMO level) and in ionization potential (IP; i.e. deeper HOMO) to (i) impart the molecules with electron-accepting and -transporting characteristics, and (ii) yield high open-circuit voltages >1 V in BHJ solar cells when combined with a low-bandgap polymer donor (PCE10) commonly used with fullerenes. The nonfullerene BHJ devices with the SM acceptor D5T6F-M achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to ca. 4.5% (vs. ca. 2% for D7T8F-M-based devices). Our study shows that –F substitutions in SM systems – otherwise used as donors – is an effective approach in the design of nonfullerene acceptors for efficient BHJ solar cells with polymer donors.
Small-molecule (SM) acceptors that can replace fullerenes (e.g. phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PC61BM; or its C71 analogue, PC71BM) in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells with polymer donors are attracting significant attention in light of the notable device efficiencies achievable with a few recently reported systems,1 including ITIC.2 Meanwhile, several studies are pointing to the high stability of nonfullerene BHJ solar cells compared with their PCBM-based counterparts,2,3 raising further interest in the development of SM acceptors and their examination in combination with various donors, ranging from low-4 to wide-bandgap1,3,5 material systems. In short, the tunable visible absorption and electronics (i.e. HOMO and LUMO levels) of SM acceptors, and their relative ease of synthetic access in scalable proportions, are undisputable benefits when compared with fullerenes. All together, these perspectives justify a systematic examination of the key design principles capable of imparting SM systems with efficient electron-accepting and -transporting characteristics, while allowing for a wider range of nonfullerenes with complementary optical bandgaps (i.e. spectral absorption) as required in higher-efficiency ternary6 and tandem device configurations.7
Of all important design principles described in prior studies directed to efficient polymer–fullerene BHJ solar cells,8 polymer main-chain substitutions with fluorine (F) have proven particularly effective (ref. 9) – often times leading to backbone planarization effects and improved carrier transport properties when present at specific sites along the polymer main chain.10 F-Substitutions have also been described as (i) assisting in the development of inter/intra-molecular interactions that influence thin-film morphologies and (ii) increasing charge carrier lifetimes by mitigating coulombic interactions.11 This design principle translates well to the development of efficient polymer acceptors that can serve as fullerene alternatives in BHJ solar cells with polymer donors, with the added benefit of inducing concurrent increases in electron affinity (EA; i.e. suppressed LUMO level) and in ionization potential (IP; i.e. deeper HOMO) susceptible of promoting both the electron-accepting and -transporting characteristics of the polymer backbone.12 Likewise, examining how systematic –F substitutions can benefit SM systems and be used in nonfullerene acceptor design strategies may prove relevant. In general, the strong electronegativity of substituents directly appended to the conjugated segment is an effective leverage in tuning the electronics of π-extended systems.13
In this contribution, we report on a set of two analogous, F-substituted oligothiophene derivatives – D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M (Fig. 1) – in which systematic fluorination at the thienyl moieties induces a concurrent raise in EA and IP, and effectively promotes the electron-accepting character of the SM systems. When used as nonfullerene acceptor candidates in BHJ solar cells with the low-bandgap polymer PCE10 (Fig. 1; model system), the low-lying HOMO analogues yield devices with high open-circuit voltages >1 V and adequate electron mobilities in the BHJ active layers (on the order of 10−5 cm2 (V s)−1). In turn, nonfullerene BHJ devices made with the SM acceptor D5T6F-M achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to ca. 4.5% (vs. ca. 2% for D7T8F-M-based devices), and our systematic device examinations provide insights into the morphological and efficiency differences that prevail in comparing D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M-based BHJ solar cells. Our study shows that adequately substituted all-thiophene SM segments can also be conducive to efficient nonfullerene BHJ solar cells with polymer donors – a strategy that paves the way to the development of a wider range of systems with tunable electronics and optical spectra.

Scheme 1 describes the synthetic routes followed to obtain the SM acceptor analogues D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M. In brief, the key unsymmetrical intermediate 2,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)-3-fluoro-4-octylthiophene (2) is accessed by halogen-exchange reaction from the TMS-protected precursor 2,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)-3-bromo-4-octylthiophene (1), using the electrophilic fluorine source NFSI (N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide). In the next step, intermediate 2 can either be symmetrically brominated by concurrent deprotection–halogenation reaction to yield the 2,5-dibromo-3-fluoro-4-octylthiophene intermediate (3), or simply deprotected (desilylation reaction with the nucleophilic reagent TBAF: tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride) to afford the 3-fluoro-4-octylthiophene intermediate (4). Next, intermediates 3 and 4 are regioselectively functionalized with iPrMgCl·LiCl11 and LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), respectively, to yield the 5-bromo-3-fluoro-4-octylthiophene-2-carbaldehyde synthon (5) and the 2-(trimethylstannyl)-3-fluoro-4-octylthiophene coupling partner (6). Following Pd-mediated Stille-coupling between 5 and 6, the bromination of intermediate 7 affords the unsymmetrical synthon 8 intended to serve in the subsequent Stille-coupling reactions. Once obtained, the symmetrical segments 10 and 13 are subjected to Knoevenagel condensation conditions with methylene malononitrile to yield the SM systems D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M, isolated as purple-blue dyes. Both D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M showed adequate solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene, although the more π-extended SM derivative D7T8F-M shows a lower propensity to dissolve in solution than its shorter counterpart. Both dyes were further purified by preparative-scale recycling size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (cf. details in the ESI†) prior to being examined as SM acceptors in BHJ solar cells (discussed in later sections).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M. 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S6†) shows that both two SM acceptors exhibit good thermal stability and starts to decompose (5% loss) at 396 °C (D5T6F-M) and 409 °C (D7T8F-M) respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results indicate that the SM acceptors exhibit a melting temperature (Tm) upon heating at 176 °C and 188 °C respectively (Fig. S7†), and the cooling scans indicate the obvious propensity of crystallization for both two SM acceptors. Moreover, the structural order of pristine SM acceptor and D–A blends were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. S14†). The molecules show a diffraction peak (100) at 2θ = 5.6° and 5.2°, respectively. In optimized blends, the peaks intensities are significantly reduced which can be attributed to the introduction of the polymer donor that suppress the crystallization of SM acceptor.

Fig. 2 shows the normalized solution (3.0 × 10−5 M in chlorobenzene) and thin-film UV-vis absorption spectra of the two analogous SM derivatives D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M; the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra are provided in Fig. S3.† D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M have comparable thin-film absorption profiles, with only a slight bathochromic shift of ca. 18 nm on extending the π-conjugation from D5T6F-M to D7T8F-M. The corresponding optical bandgap (Eopt) values inferred from the onset of thin-film absorption are 1.93 eV and 1.81 eV (Table S5†), respectively. Importantly, the significant red-shift observed on going from solutions to films for both SM systems (Fig. 2a), and the occurrence of π-aggregation shoulders at longer wavelengths, suggest that the SM derivatives are prone to form correlated aggregates; the visible reduction in peak intensity at higher temperatures in the UV-vis spectra (Fig. S3†) is another indication that some extent of aggregation occurs, even at the low concentration used for this experiment (3.0 × 10−5 M). The extended thin-film absorption of D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M across the range 450–650 nm makes them especially relevant as complementary absorbers with the polymer donor PCE10 which has its main band of absorption in the range 600–800 nm. The ionization potentials (IPs) for the SMs were determined via photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA, cf. Experimental details in the ESI†): 6.09 eV for D5T6F-M, and 5.74 eV for D7T8F-M. As required, the large IP values are comparable to those of commonly used fullerene derivatives (ca. 5.9 eV for PC71BM). These figures are summarized in Table S4,† along with extrapolated electron affinity (EA) values inferred by subtracting IP and Eopt values: 4.16 eV for D5T6F-M, and 3.93 eV for D7T8F-M. These EA estimates are 0.1–0.2 eV lower than those of common fullerene acceptors, such as PC61BM and PC71BM (4.1–4.3 eV), and also lower than PDI/NDI-based polymer acceptors.14 In comparison, the polymer donor PCE10 yields IP and EA estimates of 4.95 eV and 3.39 eV, respectively (Table S4†). From these estimates, we note that the lower EA values for D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M, compared with fullerenes, should be conducive to relatively high open-circuit voltages (VOC) in nonfullerene BHJ solar cells with the polymer donor PCE10 (discussed in later sections).

(b) PESA-estimated ionization potentials (IP, triangles), optical bandgaps (Eopt, stars) estimated from the onset of the UV-vis absorption spectra (films) for the two SM derivatives and PCE10. 
In the design of efficient nonfullerene acceptors for BHJ solar cells, π-electron delocalization, backbone planarity and spectral absorption (tied to Eopt) are of particular importance.15 Density functional theory (DFT) models allow probing those effects, while anticipating the steric hindrance that may arise in the successive coupling of substituted thiophene motifs (here, noting that backbone planarity can promote intrinsic carrier mobility).16 As represented in Fig. S1,† DFT modeling using the gap-tuned, long-range-corrected (LRC) hybrid functional ωB97XD/631G(d,p) (cf. further details and potential energy surface (PES) analysis in ESI†) shows that π-delocalization extends across the SM acceptors, with only minimal dihedral angles (<1°) between consecutive motifs – a pattern conducive to π-aggregation in thin films (consistent with temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption data in Fig. S3† and discussed earlier).
Nonfullerene BHJ solar cells with the two F-substituted oligothiophenes D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M, and the polymer donor PCE10 were fabricated with the inverted device structure ITO/a-ZnO/PCE10:SM/MoO3/Ag (active area: 0.1 cm2), and tested under simulated AM1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2); detailed experimental protocols are provided in the ESI.† Upon systematic device optimizations, the most adequate donor–acceptor blend ratios were found to be 4:6 (wt/wt) for PCE10:D5T6F-M devices and 3:7 (wt/wt) for PCE10:D7T8F-M devices (cf. further details in the ESI, along with device statistics in Tables S6–S8†). As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1, optimized BHJ devices made with the SM acceptor candidates D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M showed markedly distinct current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and figures of merit, but both showed convincing diode behavior. Optimized BHJ solar cells made with D7T8F-M yielded short-circuit current (JSC) values of ca. 4.4 mA cm−2, a high VOC of 1.1 V, but only modest fill-factor (FF) values of ca. 35%. In turn, D7T8F-M-based devices achieved PCEs of up to 1.8% (avg. 1.7%). In contrast, optimized BHJ solar cells made with D5T6F-M achieved significantly higher JSC values of ca. 8.7 mA cm−2, a comparably high VOC of 1.05 V, and notably increased FF values of ca. 47%. The high VOC values >1 V are consistent with the reduced estimated EA values for D5T6F-M and for D7T8F-M, compared to that of fullerenes (see prior comments in earlier section). In parallel, it can be noted that the photon energy loss (Eloss) of ∼0.50 eV inferred from Eloss = Eminopt − VOC (Eminopt representing the smallest bandgap of either donor or acceptor in the BHJ solar cell) for both D5T6F-M- and D7T8F-M-based optimized BHJ devices is notably lower than reported values for polymer–fullerene BHJ solar cells.15–17

The significant differences in JSC observed when comparing D5T6F-M- and D7T8F-M-based devices are consistent with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) data provided in Fig. 3b. Importantly, both the polymer donor (PCE10) and the nonfullerene SM acceptors contribute substantially to the photocurrent: with the local EQE maxima at ca. 720 nm stemming from PCE10, while the broad and prominent contributions from ca. 500 nm to 600 nm pertain to D5T6F-M or D7T8F-M. It is also worth noting that the EQE response of optimized D5T6F-M-based BHJ solar cells reaches over 50% in the range 500–600 nm, whereas EQE values remain below 30% across the visible region for D7T6F-M-based devices. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra overlaid in Fig. 3b – removing the dependence on the effective optical absorption of the active layer – points to the existence of intrinsic photon-to-current conversion efficiency limitations.
Of all possible efficiency-limiting aspects, modest FF values can sometimes be overcome via further improvements of the BHJ morphology,18 to which also correlates the efficiency of carrier transport across the active layers.19 We examined the carrier transport characteristics of the blend films with D5T6F-M, D7T8F-M and PCE10 by the “metal–insulator–semiconductor carrier extraction” method using linearly increasing voltage transients (MIS-CELIV; cf. data shown in Fig. S11† and results provided in Table 2). Table 2 shows that the nonfullerene BHJ active layers can reach electron mobilities (μe) in the order of 10−5 cm2 (V s)−1, and fairly balanced electron and hole mobilities (μh) (cf. further details in the ESI, Fig. S11†). Theses carrier mobility estimates remain more modest than values established for PCE10:PC71BM active layers (typically in range of 10−4–10−3 cm2 (V s)−1,20 and can thus contribute to the FF limitation in BHJ solar cells made with D5T6F-M, D7T8F-M and PCE10.21 Nevertheless, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analyses shown in Fig. S12† indicate that donor and acceptor counterparts are forming appropriate networks. The energy loss spectra pertaining to D5T6F-M, D7T8F-M and to PCE10 (range: 2–8 eV) are shown in Fig. S12,† allowing a net differentiation between polymer donor and nonfullerene acceptor across the BHJ active layers. In the scanning TEM mode (STEM), our EELS analyses (Fig. S12c and S12f†), provide an evident map of the phase-separated networks effectively occurring both in PCE10:D5T6F-M and in PCE10:D7T8F-M active layers; red: D5T6F-M/D7T8F-M-rich domains, green: PCE10-rich domains (scale bars: 500 nm). These results suggest that (i) further optimizations of the blend morphologies and (ii) concurrent examinations of other polymer donors (with various molecular weights) may help achieve improved carrier transport characteristics and, in turn, higher BHJ device efficiencies with the SM acceptors D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M. In parallel, we note that the systematic F-substitution of various other SM systems will broaden the range of nonfullerene acceptor candidates to be examined for high-efficiency BHJ solar cells.

Additionally, we performed a light intensity dependence measurement of JSC and the fit to the equation JSC ∝ Iα give α values of 0.96 and 0.94 (Fig. S8 and S9†). Transient photocurrent (TPC) analysis were also performed and depicted in Fig. S15.† Altogether these measurements indicate that bimolecular recombination, traps and/or space charge effects are not the limiting losses in devices. Photoluminescence quenching (PLQ, Fig. 4), however indicates a poor electron transfer from the PCE10 to the D7T8F-M. The low PLQ of 23% could explain the much lower PV. Since comparable morphologies are observed for both systems, the poor electron transfer form PCE10 to D7T8F-M could indicates a limitation of the fluorination approach. However other morphology characteristics such as high purity of the D7T8F-M domains could account for the low PLQ without compromising the acceptor nature of this molecule.

(c, d) PCE10:D7T8F-M, excitation at 540 nm and 680 nm. 
In summary, we showed that –F substitutions represent an efficient strategy in the design of SM acceptors for nonfullerene BHJ solar cells. In D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M, the systematic fluorination at the thienyl moieties induces a sufficient increase in EA (i.e. suppressed LUMO level) and in IP (i.e. deeper HOMO) to concurrently promote electron-accepting/transporting characteristics and impart high open-circuit voltages >1 V in BHJ devices. Nonfullerene BHJ solar cells with the SM acceptor D5T6F-M achieve PCEs as high as ca. 4.5%, and mixed donor–acceptor networks of appropriate lengthscales as evidenced by EELS analyses in STEM mode. Our study shows that adequately substituted all-thiophene SM analogues can also be conducive to efficient nonfullerene BHJ solar cells with polymer donors – a strategy that paves the way to the development of a wider range of systems with tunable electronics and optical spectra.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the set of two analogous SM derivatives D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M, and that of the polymer donor PCE10 (model system).	 

 	Scheme 1  Synthesis of D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Superimposed, normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the SM derivatives D5T6F-M, D7T8F-M, and the polymer donor PCE10 (model system) (solution: dotted curves; neat films: solid curves). (b) PESA-estimated ionization potentials (IP, triangles), optical bandgaps (Eopt, stars) estimated from the onset of the UV-vis absorption spectra (films) for the two SM derivatives and PCE10.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Characteristic J–V curves and (b) EQE spectra of optimized BHJ solar cells fabricated with the polymer donor PCE10 (model system), and the SM derivatives D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M serving as nonfullerene acceptors; AM1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2); integrated EQEs are in agreement with the JSC reported in Table 1: 9.5 and 5.1 (±1 mA cm−2) respectively for D5T6F-M and D7T8F-M.
