The excellent mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics contributed to the outstanding advantage of GNs as the reinforcing phase.

1. Introduction
A variety of research studies have been carried out to investigate the dielectric properties, microwave absorption and electro-magnetic interference (EMI) shielding.1–9 Graphene (GP) and graphene nanosheets (GNs) with many unique properties, such as the quantum Hall effect, large specific surface area, high Young's modulus, excellent thermal transport, and electrical and mechanical properties, have received significant attention in both the scientific and engineering communities.10–13 These GP or GN filled materials are intensively explored in applications like electronics, optics, electrochemical energy conversion and storage, solar energy harvesting, batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, charge-storage devices, microwave absorbers and so on.10–18 To date, huge effort has been made to synthesize GP filled polymer composites, and these results have demonstrated that GP can significantly improve the electronic, optical, mechanical and thermal properties of polymers with relatively low GP loading.19–27 High permittivity and low loss materials have potential applications for the miniaturization of electronic components in the radio and low-frequency microwave ranges, while suitable permittivity and high loss materials in the GHz range have potential applications for electromagnetic interference (EMI) or absorbing materials.12 The traditional approach to enhance the dielectric constant is to disperse high dielectric constant fillers into the polymer matrix randomly. Previous reports have demonstrated that the unique properties of GP make it a perfect choice as a conductive filler to fabricate composites with low percolation threshold, high dielectric properties and good mechanical properties.19–27
The combination of the unique characteristics of GP with the intrinsic advantages of ceramic materials such as high temperature stability, high corrosion resistance, and electrical insulation makes GP filled ceramics very attractive structural materials.28–30 In addition to mechanical effects, the impressive properties such as electrical conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient, and thermal shock resistance of such GP/ceramics also suggest opportunities for multifunctional applications.31 Researchers have particularly focused on GP as a toughening element to overcome the intrinsic brittleness or increase the electrical conductivity of the ceramic material.26–34 A very low GP loading (0.22 wt%) led to a 50% improvement in the mechanical properties of the alumina and an increase of the electrical conductivity up to eight orders of magnitude.29 Silicon nitride (Si3N4) processed with up to 25 vol% of GP gives conductive composites with the highest electrical conductivity (40 S cm−1).30 A percolation threshold as low as 0.38 vol% is achieved and the electrical conductivity surpasses 103 S m−1 when few-layer GP (FG) content is only 2.35 vol% in the FG/Al2O3 composite, revealing the homogeneous dispersion and high quality of as-prepared FG.31 The GN fillers confer electrical conductivity to the Si3N4 composites and result in an electrically connected GP network for concentrations of 4.3 vol%. In addition, a toughening effect produced by GP bridging of the cracks was observed.28 The fracture toughness of ceramics increases by up to ∼235% (from ∼2.8 to ∼6.6 MPa m1/2) at ∼1.5% GP volume fraction.32
Although numerous studies on the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of the GP/ceramics have been reported, very few studies have been carried out to further investigate the dielectric properties of such ceramics in the GHz frequency range, which are very promising for high technology applications such as dielectric films in high energy density capacitors and lightweight absorbers for designing EMI shielding materials. On the other hand, the results of GP filled polymer composites show that the unique dielectric properties of GP and GNs depend on the preparation process and the intrinsic properties of the resulting GP, the characteristics of the matrix, the fabrication methods of the GP filled composite, the interface between the GP and the matrix, the dispersion and content of the GP and the frequency of the EM wave.28–34 However, the investigation concerning the dielectric properties and applications of GP filled ceramic composites is still scarce in the literature. Recently, excellent permittivity and EMI shielding of graphitized reduced graphene oxides (r-GO)/SiO2 composites can be achieved at temperatures ranging from 323 to 473 K. The r-GO composites show different temperature dependent permittivity and EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) with changing mass ratio. The EMI SE of the graphitized r-GO/SiO2 composites with 20 wt% r-GOs reaches a maximum at 35 dB at ∼1.5 mm thickness.34 In our previous work, GNs–BaTiO3 ceramics with excellent EMI SE were prepared by a pressureless sintering method. The values of complex permittivity of such ceramics were enhanced with increasing GN content in the frequency range of 8.2–12.4 GHz (X-band). The total EMI SE of 4 wt% GN filled BaTiO3 ceramics exceeded 40 dB in the whole X-band with a thickness of 1.5 mm, indicating that such ceramics have excellent EM attenuation properties and can be used as commercial and effective shielding materials for EM applications.35
The focus of this paper is to investigate the effect of GN content on the mechanical properties and EM properties of GN/Al2O3 ceramics. Homogeneous dispersion of GNs among the Al2O3 matrix after densified by hot press can be obtained. The complex permittivity of such ceramics, under different content of GNs and at temperatures ranging from 25 to 400 °C, was thoroughly investigated in the X-band. The objective of the present study is to correlate the effect of the GN content, temperature and frequency on the EM properties of such GN/Al2O3 ceramics. The resultant GN/Al2O3 ceramics with low GN content and considerable improvement in functional properties are very promising for applications in various fields such as modern electronics and electric power systems, microwave absorbing and EMI shielding materials.
2. Materials and methods
The GNs were obtained by the exfoliation of graphite with typical thickness and lateral dimensions of about 2–10 nm and 5–15 μm, respectively. The raw materials of α-Al2O3 powders were purchased from Huatai Ceramic Company Ltd, Tangshan, China. The diameter of the α-Al2O3 powders is about d50 = 0.6 μm and the purity is above 99.99%. The already prepared GNs were diluted to the desired concentration of 1 mg ml−1 using ethyl alcohol as the solvent, and then sonicated for 2 h in an ultra-sonic bath. After sonication, α-Al2O3 powder was added to the prepared suspension, and the slurry was ball milled at 350 rpm using a planetary ball mill (Nanjing University Instrument Plant) and ZrO2 balls (diameter ∼5 mm) for 1 h with a powder-to-ball weight ratio of 1:20. After milling the prepared slurry was dried on a hot plate at 80 °C for 5 h. The dried mixture was ground and sieved using 400 mesh followed by drying in an oven at 100 °C. The content of GNs was 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 vol% in the Al2O3 matrix and the corresponding samples were designated as GN0, GN1, GN2, GN3, and GN4 for simplicity. GN/Al2O3 ceramics with different GN loadings were sintered by a hot press sintering process as follows. The fine powders were compressed with a pressure of 200 MPa with the dimension of ∅50 mm × 4 mm. Then, the green body was sintered at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an applied pressure of 30 MPa in a vacuum (about 10 Pa). The final sintering temperature was 1500 °C and the holding time was 2 h.
The bulk density of the prepared ceramics was measured using the Archimedes method and their theoretical density was estimated assuming a rule of mixtures and taking the densities of Al2O3 and GNs to be 3.98 and 2.1 g cm−3, respectively. The sintered samples were cut into rectangle specimens with the size of 4 mm × 3 mm × 35 mm and polished using a grinding machine. Three-point-bending testing was employed to measure the flexural strength over a 30 mm span at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm min−1. The fracture toughness was measured by the single-edge notched beam method under ambient conditions, in which the size of test specimens was 2 mm (width) × 2.5 mm (thickness) × 13 mm (length). A notch with a depth and width of 0.5 and 0.2 mm was cut in the centre part of the test specimen. A span length of 10 mm and a crosshead speed of 0.05 mm min−1 were applied for the toughness test. The Vickers hardness (Hv) test was done with an applied load of 5 N for 10 s following the standard specification for ASTME92-72. For the measurement of mechanical properties, each value was averaged at least 5 times to ensure the reliability of the results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was performed using a JEM-2100 microscope (JEOL, Limited, Tokyo, Japan) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The phases of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics were identified by X-ray diffraction (D/MAX2500 diffractometer) with Cu-Kα radiation. Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw RM 1000 confocal system spectrometer equipped with an integral microscope and HeeNe laser (633 nm) as the excitation source. The morphology of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Model JSM-6360, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The electrical conductivity was measured by a two-wire method using a current source Keithley 6220 DC. The testing specimens for the measurement of EM properties were cut into rectangular blocks with dimensions of 22.86 mm (length) × 10.16 mm (width) × 1.5 mm (thickness). The transmission and reflection scattering parameters (S11(S22) and S21(S12)) and the complex permittivity (ε = ε′ − jε′′) between 25 and 400 °C of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics were measured by the wave-guide method in the frequency range of 8.2–12.4 GHz using a network analyzer (Agilent technologies E8362B: 10 MHz–20 GHz), which was based on the measurements of the reflection and transmission module and on the fundamental wave-guide mode TE10.
3. Results and discussion
It is clear that GNs exhibited unique two dimensional plates with a smooth and mat-like structure, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. Fig. 1(c and d) also shows the typical fracture surface of FE-SEM images of GN/Al2O3 ceramics (GN4). It clearly shows that GNs were located between the grain boundaries of the Al2O3 matrix and protrude from the fracture surface of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics. From the fracture surfaces of GN/Al2O3 ceramics, which present a mainly inter-granular fracture mode, debonded GNs were pulled out from the ceramic matrix, indicating that the mechanism of crack propagation is visible, trans-granular and resulted in a refinement of the microstructure.31 The XRD patterns of the GNs and GN/Al2O3 ceramics (GN4) after sintering are shown in Fig. 1e. A new peak at 2θ angles of about 26.3°, corresponding to crystalline carbon (JCPDS (75-2078)), is observed as the GNs added into the Al2O3 (JCPDS (88-0826)) ceramics. There is no detectable second phase indicating that there has not been any significant reaction between the crystalline GNs and Al2O3 particles. Fig. 1f shows the Raman spectra of the GN powders and GN/Al2O3 ceramics in the 1000–3000 cm−1 range. The Raman pattern of GNs show a strong peak at around 1580 cm−1 (G), a disorder-induced band around 1350 cm−1 (D), and a 2D peak around 2700 cm−1. After sintering, the intensity of the D band, characteristic of disorder, decreased while the G band, assigned to a graphitic structure, increased. The ID/IG ratio is about 0.301 for GNs, and it decreases to 0.262 for GN/Al2O3 ceramics. Therefore, the honeycomb hexagonal lattice is recovered to some extent leading to a more ordered material, which is reflected in the Raman spectra, indicating the removal of amorphous carbon on the surface of GNs after sintering.35 It is also shown that G band shifts to a higher frequency (∼10 cm−1) for GN filled Al2O3 ceramics compared with the raw GNs, which is usually due to the elongation of carbon–carbon bonds through an interfacial stress transfer effect.27

In order to obtain the full reinforcement potential of the GNs, there are three key points for fabricating these ceramics: production of good quality GNs, homogeneous dispersion of GNs in a ceramic matrix and retention of the graphitic structure during high temperature processing. Commonly, GP and GO were prepared by the Hummers method, which results in thinner flakes with an improved degree of dispersion. However, the oxidation process produces structural defects, which shifts the physical properties away from pure GP. The electrically insulated GO, owing to the disrupted sp2 bonding network, requires a necessary reduction process (i.e. heat treatment or chemical reduction) to convert it back to GP, such as the reduction of GO to GP, also has been reported by spark plasma sintering.30–33 Raman spectroscopy was found to be a very useful technique in order to evaluate the thermal reduction of the GO, and the ratio ID/IG can be used to quantify defects (disorder). Higher ID/IG ratios commonly larger than 1 were obtained for the GO after spark plasma sintering,30 which are larger than that of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with a value of about 0.262, indicating the presence of a higher amount of defects of the reduced GP from GO.
The limited controls over the quality of the resulting reduced GP usually contain undesired graphitic crystallites or higher amount of defects which can negatively affect the properties of the composites. Although a fast heating rate and low atmosphere pressure occur during high temperature sintering, the mass loss caused by high temperature sintering has been observed due to the weak thermal stability of GO, and the real remained mass of GO after sintering was about 35%,31 while the GNs showed almost no mass change after sintering. Good dispersion of the GP in the matrix is also one of the key points and challenges for achieving the desired conductivity and mechanical properties of the GP filled ceramic. An improved degree of dispersion of GP or GO can be obtained through the modification of surface charges of the fillers combined with the colloidal processing routes. For the dispersion of GNs in the ceramic matrix, powder processing routes were employed since it is an easy route to produce powder mixtures and can be scaled up. Well dispersed GN filled Al2O3 ceramics were produced using simple sonication and ball-milling, followed by hot press sintering for the consolidation process to preserve the integrity of GNs from structural defects. Therefore, with minimal damage after high temperature exposure as well as the lower cost of the GNs, GN filled Al2O3 ceramics represent a cost-effective and considerable simple option, when compared with the GP or GO, and then maintain the prominent performance of GNs after high temperature exposure.
The mechanical properties and relative density of the monolith Al2O3 and GN/Al2O3 ceramics are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that all the samples are fully densified during the hot press sintering process. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of all the GN filled ceramics have been significantly improved and such an improvement is attributed to the addition of GNs. In particular, the flexural strength and fracture toughness of sample GN4 have increased by 63.2% and 48.4% over the monolithic Al2O3, reaching their maximum values of 483 ± 25 MPa and 4.6 ± 0.5 MPa m1/2, respectively. The relative density and hardness of the GN filled Al2O3 ceramics possessed almost the same values compared with the monolithic Al2O3 ceramics, and does not vary very much with the addition of GNs, as shown in Table 1. Such results are comparable and similar to the reported GP or GN reinforced ceramics.28–33

The toughening mechanisms, mainly determined by the intrinsic mechanical properties of the filler, the efficiency of load transfer at the interface of the matrix and the filler, and the dispersion level of the fillers are observed on the fracture surfaces of the GN reinforced Al2O3 ceramics, such as pull-out and crack deflection, as shown in Fig. 1c and d32 The flexure strength of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics closely depended on the microstructure and interfacial bonding strength between the GNs and the ceramic matrix. GNs with high Young's modulus and large specific area are well dispersed in the Al2O3 matrix, reinforcing and helping the transfer of the load from the ceramic matrix, which significantly improves the flexural strength of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics.28–33 Furthermore, due to the mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficient of the GNs and Al2O3 ceramics, very firm contact between Al2O3 and GNs can be obtained during sintering and cooling.31 Such close contact between the Al2O3 matrix and GNs enables the platelets to anchor at and bind with the ceramic matrix, which results in the increase of contact area. Fig. 1 also shows that GNs run along the grain boundary and form a large area of interface and a very thin layer of GNs is securely anchored within the grain boundaries of the ceramic matrix. Considering the increased contact area and GN draping over the fracture surface, GNs provide a lengthy deflection path and can be contributed to a greater toughness enhancement. The interfacial bonding is strong between the GNs and the Al2O3 matrix, and the energy to pull out GNs is expected to be much greater, which also ensures that the GNs can effectively bear the load applied to the ceramics.31 In addition, when a crack propagates and meets with GNs, as shown in Fig. 1c and d, cracks were arrested and deflected in-plane and such deflect cracks would create a more tortuous path to release stress and helps increase the fracture toughness.33 Therefore, fracture toughness of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics is believed to be greatly improved due to the interfacial friction in the interface between the GNs and the Al2O3 matrix, the greater energy to pull out GNs and the crack deflection mechanism.
The electrical conductivity of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics as a function of GN content is also shown in Table 1. Obviously, the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with higher GN content exhibited higher conductivity, and the electrical conductivity sharply increased with increasing GN content, especially when the GN content is up to 1.5 vol%. The enhancement of electrical conductivity is mainly attributed to the higher intrinsic conductivity of GNs as well as the increasing GN conductive network. The calculated value of the percolation threshold of GN/Al2O3 ceramics, based on the measured electrical conductivity, is about 0.67 vol%, which can be ascribed to the high quality and dispersion of the GNs, and multidimensional electron transport pathways. The electrical conductivity of GN/Al2O3 ceramics is more than 0.4 S m−1 with only 0.5 vol% and reaches 4.7 S m−1 with 1.0 vol% GNs, respectively. By increasing the GN content to 2.0 vol%, a conductivity of 123.3 S m−1 is achieved, which is larger than that of the other carbon material filled ceramics with the same content, such as GO, reduced GP and carbon nanotubes (CNTs).36–39 The pure GP, GO or reduced GP is reported to have poor electrical conductivity due to the defects, induced by functionalization, and the oxidation and degradation of GP during the high temperature reduction process, which can affect the electrical properties.38 The excellent mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics are attributed to the outstanding advantage of GNs as the reinforcing phase, good dispersion and quality of GNs with control over size and thickness, less prone to damage after high temperature exposure, which indicated that such ceramics can be used as modern electronics and electric power systems, microwave absorption properties and EMI shielding materials.

Fig. 2 shows the real (ε′) and imaginary (ε′′) parts of complex permittivity of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics versus GN content. By increasing the GN content, both the values of ε′ and ε′′ of such ceramics increased in the whole X-band. For example, the highest values of ε′ and ε′′ of the 2 vol% GN filled Al2O3 ceramic can be up to 105.3–59.1 and 72.2–49.1 in the X-band, respectively.
 Fig. 2  The (a) real and (b) imaginary parts of complex permittivity of GN/Al2O3 ceramics with different GN content. 
As known, the values of ε′ represent the storage capability of EM energy and mainly depend on the polarization process of the ceramic using GNs as absorbing fillers in a GHz frequency range.40 Due to the high conductivity of GNs and the insulating nature of Al2O3, interfacial polarization exists between the interface of GNs and Al2O3 when such ceramics suffer from an applied field. Obviously, the GNs are included in an insulating Al2O3 matrix to constitute heterogeneous composites. More interfacial polarization is introduced as the GN content increased. From this point of view, the higher value of ε′ can be obtained with the higher GN content.41
The values of ε′′, representing the loss capability of EM energy, mainly depend on two different factors in the microwave frequency range: relaxation phenomenon and electrical conductivity, it can be expressed by the equation ε = εrelax′′ + σ/ωε0, where εrelax′′ is the electron relaxation process in this case, σ is the electrical conductivity, ε0 is the dielectric constant in a vacuum, and ω is the angular frequency.42 Based on the above analysis, it is reasonable that both the εrelax′′ and σ will be enhanced when the GN content increased, resulting in an increase in the value of ε′′. Furthermore, both ε′ and ε′′ decrease with increasing frequency, and the phenomenon implies that polarization has enough time to realize at low frequency but at high frequency the polarization could not catch up the variation of the EM field. Therefore, higher values and frequency dependence of ε′ and ε′′ can be obtained with higher GN content of such ceramics, as shown in Fig. 2.
Compared with other carbon nano-material filled ceramics with the same or higher filler content in the same frequency range,42–46 GN/Al2O3 ceramics exhibited higher values of ε′ and ε′′, caused by low conductive percolation thresholds and unique microstructure of the GNs with lightweight and high conductivity. The microstructure of flaky GNs in such ceramics affects the formation of microcapacitor networks, the evolution of conductive paths, and the influences of both the values and the frequency dependence of ε′ and ε′′. Meanwhile, the improved dispersion of GNs also leads to the enhancement of both the values of ε′ and ε′′ in such ceramics by increasing the number of interfaces and conductive paths. Therefore, the enhanced values of ε′ and ε′′ for such ceramics are reasonable due to the flaky GNs and the improved dispersion of GNs. Furthermore, the high complex permittivity of such ceramics in the X-band is also larger than that of the 20 wt% graphitized r-GO/SiO2 ceramics and the 4 wt% GN filled BaTiO3 ceramics.34,35 This phenomenon can be explained so that it is easier to form a continuous electron transmission path of the densification ceramics with high conductivity GNs and GN conductive networks by hot pressed sintering, which is beneficial to enhance the electron hopping between the contact GNs and resulted in further polarization of such ceramics.47
The temperature dependence of the complex permittivity of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics is measured from 25 to 400 °C at 8.2–12.4 GHz, as shown in Fig. 3. The complex permittivity of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics is significantly affected by temperature. The value of ε′ of GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 0.5 vol% GNs increased from 15.5 to 35.5 at 8.2 GHz as the temperature increased to 400 °C, and such a higher value of ε′ is about five times larger than that of pure Al2O3 ceramics at the same frequency and 400 °C. The free electrons are localized at the GN and Al2O3 interface during the polarization process, which gives a good explanation of the typical dielectric behaviour and the higher dielectric constant. The value of ε′′ of Al2O3 ceramics with 0.5 vol% GNs changed slightly and still lowered at 400 °C, although the increasing rate is larger, when compared with the ε′ of such GN/Al2O3 ceramics. The combination of high values of ε′ and low values of ε′′ in this work is one of the interesting results among the reported GN filled ceramics.34,35 Generally, the GNs that had the highest electric conductivity, according to the free electron theory, will lead to higher ε′ and ε′ values. The GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 0.5 vol% GNs showed low ε′′ and higher ε′ values, which may be attributed to the fact that low GN content in the Al2O3 matrix cannot connect with each other under such low filler loading (0.5 vol%), and therefore, such ceramics showed a low ε′′ behavior. The temperature dependences of ε′′ also indicated that the conductivity of such ceramics also slightly increases with the increase in temperature. Commonly, weak dielectric frequency dependence of composites is due to their insulator nature, while the strong one should arise from their conductor nature.47 The ε′ values of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 0.5 vol% GNs are high and exhibit strong dielectric frequency dependence under low electric conductivity, indicating the strong dielectric relaxation characteristics of such ceramics in the measured frequency and temperature range, and which mainly resulted from the unique microstructure of the flaky GNs and the larger number of capacitor networks.
 Fig. 3  Temperature dependences of the complex permittivity of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with (a) 0.5 vol%, (b) 1.0 vol%, (c) 1.5 vol% and (d) 2.0 vol% GN content in the frequency range of 8.2–12.4 GHz. 
When the GN content increased to 1.5 vol%, higher values of ε′ and ε′′ tend to appear in the region of low frequencies and high temperatures. The values of ε′ and ε′′ of the ceramics with 1.5 vol% GNs are about 2.2 and 7.2 times more than those of the ceramics with 0.5 vol% GNs at 8.2 GHz and 400 °C, respectively. A very good monotonic relationship between the complex permittivity and temperature, ε′ and ε′′ increased with increase in temperature, is exhibited over the measured temperature range when the GN content is less than 1.5 vol%. These results indicated that both of the values of ε′ and ε′′ enhanced with increase in temperature while decreased with increase in in frequency at each individual temperature. According to the report of temperature dependences of complex permittivity, the increase of ε′ is attributed to the shortened relaxation time caused by the electron polarization occurring at elevated temperature while the increase of ε′′ is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity with increasing temperature.48–50
It can be noticed that the ε′ values of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 2.0 vol% GNs firstly increased as temperature increased to 100 °C, and then decreased as temperature further increased to 200 °C. More importantly, negative permittivity appears when the frequency is below 11.3 GHz for such ceramics at 300 °C, and it is interesting that the negative permittivity appears throughout the whole X-band as the temperature increased to 400 °C. Compared with the values of ε′, the value of ε′′ of such ceramics showed the typical ε′′-temperature dependence in the whole measured freauency and temperature range. The increased ε′ values of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 2.0 vol% GNs at 100 °C is mainly attributed to the fact that more free electrons can be activated by increasing the temperature and then aggregated at the GN–Al2O3 interface during the polarization process, which gives enhanced values of ε′ and strong ε′-frequency dependence behaviour.
As the temperature increased to 200 °C, the free electrons gathered at the interface may change to hopping electrons, which resulted in the reduction of the polarization process, so that the values of ε′ decreased. The electrical conductivity of the ceramic was further increased and can reach up to 758.3 S m−1 at 300 °C. Due to the transport of more electrons to form conductive network, a larger number of capacitor networks were then changed to conductive paths which can be considered as an inductor. Therefore, the negative permittivity appears in the low-frequency range (below 11.3 GHz), and it changes to positive when the frequency is higher than 11.3 GHz at 300 °C. A continuous conductive path is formed and the electrons can move freely across the ceramic at 400 °C, and therefore, such ceramics show typical conductor behaviour with high conductivity. The negative permittivity behaviors of such ceramics, with a highly conductive GN acting as a metallic medium, show totally different EM responses.51 Negative permittivity was observed in samples with highly conductive GN content and temperature, and appears throughout the whole X-band as the temperature increased to 400 °C. The origin of the negative values of ε′ in the X-band is yet to be established; however, the tunable negative permittivity behaviors have been observed in the conductive filler (such as metal particles, conductive ceramic particles and CNTs) filled composites after insulator–conductor transition when the filler content is above the percolation threshold.52–55 It should be noted that different from the negative permittivity obtained in the kHz, MHz and ultraviolet range,52–55 the negative permittivity shows remarkable filler content dependence for the GN/Al2O3 ceramics in the GHz range. The GNs have distinctive electric and dielectric properties, the conductivity and complex permittivity of the GNs are also different from, and unlike the reported metallic particles, conductive ceramic particles and even CNTs, and resulted in the negative permittivity in the GHz range. The GN conductivity network in the GN/Al2O3 ceramics is the determinant and the essential structure to the efficient realization of negative permittivity, which is equivalent to the thin metallic wires in Pendry's studies.55 Therefore, negative permittivity was realized and the GN content exhibits a significant influence on the negative permittivity values, making the effective plasma frequency tunable in the GHz range. This meaningful result suggests that negative permittivity can be directly obtained from conventionally fabricated material, and also reveals that those costly and precisely designed structures of metallic elements can be replaced by the conductive fillers for the design of single negative-permittivity materials.
The ε′′ mainly characterizes the capacity of dielectric loss, which is determined by the electrical conductivity and dielectic relaxation of GN/Al2O3 ceramics, because the motion of the free charges in the GNs and the dielectic relaxation under the EM field could lead to energy loss. The dielectic relaxation and conductivity of the composites are related to the characteristics of the matrix, the property and volume fraction of the GNs, geometric characteristics and the extent of cross linking of the GNs in the Al2O3 matrix and the frequency of the EM wave. The experimental results clearly show that the GN content crucially influences the polarization process, the relaxation process and the conductivity of such ceramics, and then in turn affects the frequency and temperature dependence of the complex permittivity. Monotonically increased dependence can be obtained between the GN content and the conductivity. This relationship suggests that the conductivity of the ceramics would increase by increasing the content of the fillers and temperature. For the ceramic with 0.5 vol% GNs, both the dielectric relaxation and conductivity contribute considerably to ε′′ values, due to the fact that the GN network has not been well built. As the GN content increased, it is found that the conductivity loss plays a dominant role and increases with the enhanced temperature, and the dielectric relaxation process is hidden by the high carrier mobility of the GNs. Therefore, the conductivity and the relaxation phenomenon of the ceramics are evidently considered as the two most significant factors that affect the EM properties and the corresponding microwave performances.
For the design of a broad absorption bandwidth and thin thickness microwave absorber with only dielectric loss, the values and frequency dependencies of the complex permittivity should be carefully adjusted and controlled. Both the values of ε′ and ε′′ were inevitably increased with increase in the GN content, as shown in Fig. 2. According to the quarter-wave principle, the relationship between the EM properties and absorber thicknesses, larger optima absorber thickness is needed to obtain some higher values of RL under lower absorber content and complex permittivity.56–58 The RL of GN/Al2O3 ceramics is calculated based on the complex permittivity in the X-band with optimum thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 4a. The RL of the ceramic with 0.5 vol% GNs cannot reach −10 dB when the thickness is 2.0 mm, and such results were mainly ascribed to the low values of ε′′ due to the low absorber content, which presents lower microwave attenuation characteristics. As the GN content increased to 1.0 vol%, the RL values of the ceramic show a minimum of −24 dB (larger than 99% absorption) at 9.8 GHz and RL ≤ −10 dB bandwidth (90% absorption) in the frequency range of 9.1–10.7 GHz with a thin thickness of 1.5 mm. The GN filled Al2O3 ceramics met the requirement of impedance matching and made a strong EM absorption with broadening absorption bandwidth, benefiting from the appropriate values of ε′ and ε′′ (namely, high complex permittivity, considerable dielectric loss and suitable frequency dispersion characteristics of ε′ and ε′′ values).

For a single layer of absorber backed by a perfect electrical conductor, the microwave absorption performance shows a non-monotonic increase with the attenuation constant (α). The frequency dependence of α of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics was also calculated.59,60 The α monotonically increases with increase in the GN content in the whole frequency range. These results indicate that the EM wave attenuation capacity of GN/Al2O3 ceramics get enhanced by the addition of more GNs in the Al2O3 matrix. However, as the GN content increased to 2.0 vol%, lower RL values of such ceramic were obtained in the whole X-band, which can be ascribed to the high values of ε′′ resulting in poor impedance matching between the air and absorbers, although such ceramics with a high attenuation constant resulted from the larger values of ε′′ and thinner optimum thickness (about 1 mm) which resulted from the larger values of ε′.
The temperature dependences of the RL of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 0.5 and 1.0 vol% GN content in the X-band and temperature range of 25–400 °C are shown in Fig. 4b and c. It is evidently observed that the maximum absorbing peak shifts to lower frequency with increasing measured temperature. For the microwave absorber with only dielectric loss, the relation between the matching frequency (f) and complex permittivity (ε) is expressed by the function f = c/4d(ε)1/2, where d is the thickness of the absorber and c is the velocity of light in free space.55 Hence, it is reasonable that the maximum absorbing peak shifted to the lower frequency with increasing temperature, and the increased values of ε′ and ε′′ with increasing temperature lead to the change in RL values. For the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 0.5 vol% GN content with a thickness of 1.5 mm, the RL of such a ceramic cannot reach −6.5 dB at 25 °C; the values of RL increased as the temperature increases up to 200 °C and less than −5 dB (larger than 68.4% absorption) at 300 °C in the whole X-band. Such results indicated that the ceramic with low absorber content and high absorption can be obtained under the enhanced temperature. For the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 1.0 vol% GN content with a thickness of 1.3 mm, the RL–temperature curves also imply that the microwave absorption increased at lower frequencies while decreased at higher frequencies, as the measured temperature increased. The RL values less than −6 dB (larger than 74.9% absorption) can be obtained in the frequency range of 9.2–12.4 GHz with a maximal RL value of 48.6 dB at 10.6 GHz for such ceramics at 200 °C. According to the transmitted line theory, the RL that varied with temperature mainly resulted from the change in ε′ and ε′′ values, which makes the impedance between air and the absorber deviate from the initial impedance matching conditions.42 The increased values of ε′ and ε′′ with increasing temperature lead to the change in RL values; meanwhile, the RL is still high in the investigated frequency and temperature range. These results suggest that the GN/Al2O3 ceramics can be used as elevated temperature microwave absorbing materials with both good mechanical properties and microwave absorption. On the other hand, the complex permittivity of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with high GN content is much larger, which can result from the bad impedance matching conditions and lower RL values in the whole frequency range, although the high ε′′ can cause high EM wave attenuation. Therefore, GN/Al2O3 ceramics with high GN content are not suitable to design microwave absorbing materials, but the high conductivity as well as high complex permittivity suggests that such ceramics could be good candidates as EMI shielding materials in the measured frequency and temperature range.
The EMI SE is a combined result of the reflection relative to the surface of the absorber, the absorption of the EM energy, and the multiple internal scattering of EM radiation.61Fig. 5a shows the EMI SE of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with a thickness of 1.5 mm and different GN content in the X-band. The values of EMI SE increased obviously in the whole X-band as the GN content increased. It is also evident that the main contribution to the EMI shielding comes from the addition of GNs, and suggested that the enhanced electrical conductivity induced by the establishment of conductive networks in the GN filled ceramics has a positive effect on the EMI SE.
 Fig. 5  (a) The EMI SE of GN/Al2O3 ceramics with different GN content in the X-band at 1.5 mm. (b) The EMI SE of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 2 vol% GN as a function of temperature in the X-band at 1.5 mm. 
An EMI SE value of at least 20 dB is typically required for commercial application in EMI shielding devices.61 The highest EMI SE was observed for the ceramics filled with 2.0 vol% GNs, and the values of EMI SE greater than 22 dB can be obtained in the whole X-band, indicating that such ceramics have excellent EMI shielding properties in the measured frequency range. It is also well known that the EMI SE of the filler filled composite depends critically on the content, dispersion, intrinsic conductivity and dielectric constant of the filler, the intrinsic electrical conductivity and dielectric constant of the composites.43–46 The enhancement mechanism of EMI SE of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics could be attributed to the high conductivity GNs and GN conductive networks with excellent dispersion of the GNs in the Al2O3 ceramic. An excellent dispersion of GNs in the Al2O3 matrix ensures enhanced conductivity and EM absorbing ability throughout the whole ceramics, which is also important for effective EMI shielding action. The structure and high conductivity properties of GNs were maintained after sintering which ensured the high EMI SE of such ceramics. Furthermore, high EMI SE of GN/Al2O3 ceramics with low GN content and thin thickness can be obtained in the X-band, and they also exhibit promising prospects for high temperature applications based on the complex permittivity measurement. Fig. 5b shows the EMI SE of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics with 2 vol% GN and 1.5 mm at different temperatures and frequencies. The values of EMI SE of such ceramics increased as the temperature increased in the whole X-band. The value of EMI SE increased from 22.8 to 37.4 dB at 8.2 GHz when the temperature increased from 25 to 400 °C. For a monolithic material, theoretical predictions suggest that EMI shielding by absorption should be a function of the conductivity under certain thickness.59 Thus, it is reasonable that the value of EMI SE increased as the temperature increased, which resulted from the increase in ε′′ values. These results suggest that GN/Al2O3 ceramics can be a promising choice for the EM shielding applications at enhanced temperature.
The frequency and temperature dependence of EM properties (including the complex permittivity, microwave absorption and attenuation) are associated with the microwave response of the conductivity and relaxation phenomenon in the X-band. The GN/Al2O3 ceramics with low GN content can be used as elevated temperature microwave absorbing materials with both good mechanical properties and microwave absorption. Besides, conductive networks with high conduction loss were formed as the GN content increased, which resulted in a decrease in the microwave absorption of the ceramics while the EMI SE enhanced. Therefore, the fundamental principles for achieving high-performance EMI and microwave absorption materials are different, high microwave absorption can be achieved by suitable values and frequency dependencies of the complex permittivity while high EMI SE commonly needs high conductivity and conductive network. The GN/Al2O3 ceramics show high mechanical properties, good microwave absorption and EMI shielding performance demonstrating their great potential to be applied in microwave applications.
4. Conclusions
GN/Al2O3 ceramics with high mechanical properties, good microwave absorption and EMI shielding performance were prepared by hot press sintering. A very low GN loading (2.0 vol%) led to a 63.2% and 48.4% improvement in the flexural strength and fracture toughness over the monolithic Al2O3 ceramic, respectively. The excellent mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of the GN/Al2O3 ceramics contributed to the outstanding advantage of GNs (by enabling good dispersion and quality of GNs, less prone to damage after high temperature exposure) as a reinforcing phase. Both the values of ε′ and ε′′ increased with increasing GN content. The negative values of ε′ of the GNs/Al2O3 ceramic with 2.0 vol% GNs are observed at 300 °C and throughout the whole X-band at 400 °C. The frequency and temperature dependence of EM properties (including the complex permittivity, microwave absorption and attenuation) are associated with the microwave response of the conductivity and the relaxation phenomenon in the X-band. The mechanical properties, microwave absorption and EMI SE results suggest that the GN/Al2O3 ceramics could be good candidates for highly efficient microwave absorbers or EMI shielding materials in the whole X-band.
