    , Accepted 25th October 2013First published on 30th October 2013AbstractThe few-layer graphene, produced by exfoliation of graphite in 4-methylanisole, was noncovalently functionalized with the Ni(II) complex of 5,7,12,14-tetramethyldibenzo-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-3,5,7,10,12,14-hexaene (Ni(II)-tetramethyldibenzotetraaza[14]annulene, or NiTMTAA), which is a simple model of more complex porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The resulting hybrid materials with different content of NiTMTAA were characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy, as well as fluorescence and conductivity measurements. Additional information on the mechanisms of NiTMTAA interaction with graphene was obtained from density functional theory (DFT) and molecular mechanics (MM) calculations. Both experimental and theoretical results suggest that NiTMTAA forms a full double-sided adsorption layer on the graphene surface. The presence of NiTMTAA molecules in the hybrid materials obtained manifests itself in the appearance of characteristic bands in all types of electromagnetic spectra recorded; in FTIR, they are relatively weak as compared to graphene absorption bands, but dominate in Raman spectra. The morphology of the nanohybrids observed by SEM, TEM and AFM, as well as their electrical conductivity, depends on the NiTMTAA content. According to the results of DFT calculations of NiTMTAA adsorption on different graphene models, flat orientation of the complex with respect to graphene is energetically preferable, with a little difference depending on whether benzo or methyl groups contact the sheet.
Introduction
Graphene, one of the allotropes of the elemental carbon, with its unique atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) lattice structure, is among the most exciting nanomaterials discovered in the last few years.1 It has attracted considerable attention due to its outstanding electronic, mechanical and thermal properties, which are distinct from those of other carbon forms.1–12 As a result, graphene is now considered as one of the most promising materials with enormous potential for high-performance applications such as supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, solar cells, field-effect transistors, sensors, nanocomposites, drug delivery, etc.13–35 many of which require scalable production of single to few-layer graphene.
Among the current methods of graphene preparation, solution-processed routes offer the greatest ease for the large-scale preparation of graphene by exfoliation. For successful exfoliation and achieving individual or few-layer graphene, overcoming the interlayer van der Waals forces is necessary. One strategy is to decrease these forces by expanding the distance between the adjacent layers via oxidation of graphite with posterior chemical reduction of graphene oxide,32,36–39 and another one is direct liquid exfoliation.40,41 Although the chemical reduction methods provide a high-throughput processing route for preparing graphene, numerous defects in the sp2 carbon lattice that were induced during the oxidation process cannot be fully reversed by reduction, thus resulting in an undesirable degradation of the unique electronic properties of graphene.37,42 Alternatively, the liquid phase exfoliation of graphite to form colloidal suspensions of graphene of single- or few-layered sheets has definite advantages due to its scalability and versatility and because the as-prepared graphene can keep the basic structural features of graphite. The exfoliation is achieved by introducing forces to overcome the inter-layer van der Waals interactions through the combined action of an appropriate solvent and sonication. The first successful sonication-based exfoliation of graphite using a low power sonic bath was achieved in the organic solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP).43 Unfortunately, the resulting graphene concentration and its total yield were low, 0.01 mg mL−1 and about 1 wt%, respectively. Some improvements were achieved due to the use of other solvents, with concentrations as high as 0.03 mg mL−1 obtained with o-dichlorobenzene,44 0.1 mg mL−1 with pentafluorobenzonitrile,45 or 0.5 mg mL−1 by using benzylamine and extending the sonication time to 4–6 h.46 Substantially longer sonication times in, for example, cyclohexanone for 48 h, dimethylformamide for 150 h and NMP for up to 460 h, yielded graphene suspensions with concentrations of 1.0–1.2 mg mL−1.47–49 Particularly high graphene concentrations of 2–63 mg mL−1 were afforded by redispersing dry exfoliated few-layer graphene with the assistance of a sonic tip for 6–192 h.50
Manipulation of highly exfoliated graphene is complicated at any moment due its persistent tendency to aggregate and restack as a result of the strong inter-sheet van der Waals forces. Therefore, the design and introduction of functionalizing chemical units to efficiently disperse graphene and, at the same time, to bring in new or enhanced functions are deemed highly desirable and technologically important. A number of covalent and noncovalent methods for the functionalization of graphene have been developed.51–57 In particular, graphene-based novel hybrid nanomaterials have been prepared, in which the unique properties of graphene are combined with those of photoactive components such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines, which are targeted at potential energy conversion and storage applications.58–67 In the majority of these reports, covalent and noncovalent strategies were employed to functionalize graphene oxide.60–67 Contrary to covalent functionalization, noncovalent techniques explore van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions and/or π–π stacking of aromatic molecules at the graphene plane, and consequently have the advantage of preserving the extended π conjugation and the unique electronic properties of graphene intact.53,54,57–59 As regards graphene vs. graphene oxide, the oxygen-containing groups in the latter alter the intrinsic properties of the quasi-infinite π-conjugated system, and correspondingly, the electronic properties of the final functionalized nanohybrids.
Thus, the need to develop alternative routes for the preparation of donor–acceptor nanohybrids through noncovalent functionalization of pristine graphene is obvious. In addition to the usually employed porphyrins and phthalocyanines, also well known but less studied (in the context of carbon nanohybrid materials) are macrocyclic compounds exhibiting similar optical and electronic properties, which belong to the class of tetraaza[14]annulenes, including their transition metal complexes.68 Tetraaza[14]annulenes taken per se exhibit a wide spectrum of interesting and potentially useful properties,68a–c being able to act as DNA/RNA binding agents,68d–f catalase mimics,68g conducting materials,68h–m chiral receptors,68n gas sensors,68o–q and electrocatalysts.68r–t Furthermore, the catalytic characteristics of tetraazaannulenes can be enhanced by fabricating their composites with inorganic materials,69a–d which can be exemplified by Ni(II) and Mn(III) tetraaza[14]annulenes encapsulation in porous Vycor glass for the reductive dehalogenation of alkyl halides,69a supporting Cu(II) and Pd(II) complexes on glassy carbon electrodes for the oxidation of p-X styrene (X = OCH3, CH3, H, F, Cl)69b and sulfur(IV) species,69c encapsulating Cu(II) tetraaza[14]annulene within the nanocavity pores of zeolite-Y for liquid phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol,69d among others.
While some tetraaza[14]annulenes were shown to form host–guest compounds with fullerenes,69e until now the possibility of their use for the preparation of donor–acceptor nanocarbon hybrid materials has been studied to a limited extent, and only in the context of carbon nanotube functionalization.70–72 In the latter studies, the noncovalent functionalization of carbon nanotubes with tetraaza[14]annulenes and their transition metal complexes was treated with both experimental70,71 and theoretical techniques, including molecular mechanics71 and density functional theory.70,72
In the present study, the few-layer graphene, produced by exfoliation of graphite in 4-methylanisole, was noncovalently functionalized with nickel(II) complex of 5,7,12,14-tetramethyldibenzo-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-3,5,7,10,12,14-hexaene (Ni(II)-tetramethyldibenzotetraaza[14]annulene or NiTMTAA for simplicity; Fig. 1). This complex is the simplest in preparation representative of metal tetraaza[14]annulenes, and thus can be considered as a convenient model for the design of new graphene–tetraazamacrocycle hybrids, as well as for detailed studies of their microscopic and spectroscopic characteristics. As additional attractive properties of NiTMTAA one should consider its catalytic activity69a and the capability to form host–guest compounds with fullerenes.69e The latter affinity to highly conjugated carbon surfaces was expected to enhance graphene exfoliation and the stability of its donor–acceptor hybrids with tetraazaannulene molecules. The resulting hybrid materials with different contents of NiTMTAA were characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy, as well as fluorescence measurements. Additional information on the mechanisms of NiTMTAA interaction with graphene was obtained from density functional theory (DFT) and molecular mechanics (MM) calculations. Conductivity measurements on the new graphene-based nanohybrid samples with different content of NiTMTAA were performed as well.

Experimental
Synthesis of materials
NiTMTAA was synthesized according to the procedure described elsewhere.73
Few-layer graphene was prepared by liquid phase exfoliation of graphite in 4-methyl anisole. Graphite powder (99.999% purity) and 4-methylanisole (99% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as supplied. For the preparation of graphene, approximately 300 mg of graphite powder was added to 100 mL of 4-methylanisole and sonicated in a Branson 2210 low-power ultrasonic bath for 1 h. Preliminary tests showed that the concentration of graphene dispersion tends to decrease after 1 h, probably because of oxidative degradation of 4-methylanisole (changes from colorless to yellowish). The concentration of exfoliated graphene as a function of sonication time was checked by measuring the UV-vis absorbance at 660 nm. The entire dispersion was then filtered through a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane without centrifugation. The filter cake was collected and added to 100 mL of 4-methylanisole and sonicated for 1 h again. The resulting dispersion was then centrifuged at 500 rpm for 45 min to remove unexfoliated graphite crystals, whereas the supernatant was collected by a pipette. Since dispersing graphene in 4-methylanisole makes its further manipulation and characterization complicated due to a high boiling point (173 °C) of the solvent, the latter was changed to isopropanol following the procedure reported by another research group.74 Briefly, the supernatant of graphene in 4-methylanisole was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane, the filter cake obtained was washed with 25 mL of isopropanol, sonicated for 10 min, and the resulting dispersion was filtered again. This washing–sonication–filtration cycle was repeated five times. Finally, homogeneous graphene dispersion in isopropanol was obtained after the filter cake was again redispersed in isopropanol and sonicated for 15 min. The resulting concentration of graphene using this methodology was 0.23 mg mL−1, which was determined by evaporating a known volume of the dispersion and weighing the solid residue. The total yield of dispersed graphene was calculated to be ca. 7.7% based on the starting graphite. The concentration of 0.23 mg mL−1 afforded in 2 h implies a higher rate of graphene production than in the case of graphite exfoliation with NMP in a low power ultrasonic bath, which needed 10–25 h to achieve the same concentration of graphene dispersions.49,50 Another advantage of using 4-methylanisole to produce graphene is a lower boiling point and lower toxicity as compared to those of NMP.
For noncovalent functionalization of graphene with NiTMTAA, 20 mg of graphene dispersed in 15 mL of isopropanol were added to 60 mg of NiTMTAA dissolved in 50 ml of isopropanol (weight ratio graphene:NiTMTAA of 1:3). The resulting dispersion was stirred overnight at room temperature, then centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 rpm, and the supernatant was decanted. The precipitate was subjected to cycles of washing with isopropanol and centrifugation, until the typical green color of NiTMTAA was no longer observed in the solvent. This sample of graphene–NiTMTAA nanohybrid, obtained after only one-day interaction of the components and further referred to as NiTMTAA+G(1), was redispersed in isopropanol, and sealed in a vial to prevent the evaporation of isopropanol.
On the other hand, we expected that the degree of functionalization could be increased by increasing the interaction time, and in the second series of experiments we extended it considerably. The isopropanol dispersion containing graphene and NiTMTAA was prepared identically to the one described in the previous paragraph, but it was stirred at 75 °C for 5 days. The resulting dispersion was centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was removed by a pipette, and the precipitate was subjected to three cycles of isopropanol washing and centrifugation, keeping the supernatant in each cycle. Finally, the precipitate was transferred to a vial and redispersed in isopropanol (this sample is further referred to as NiTMTAA+G(P)), whereas the supernatants collected from all washing–separation cycles were joined and concentrated by evaporation (sample referred to as NiTMTAA+G(S)). Both samples were sealed to prevent solvent evaporation.
Characterization
TGA curves were acquired by using a SDT-Q600 analyzer from TA Instruments. The system was calibrated for mass with standard mass traceable to NIST, certified as 315.1620 ± 0.0048 mg. The temperature scale was calibrated with reference materials, analyzing high-purity metals for their melting temperatures, with certified values of melting temperature traceable to NIST of 156.5985 °C, 419.5270 °C and 961.7800 °C for indium, zinc and silver, respectively. Likewise, the system was calibrated for heat flow by measuring the heat capacity of sapphire and determining the fusion heat for indium with a certified value of ΔfusH = 28.51 ± 0.19 J g−1. All the samples were run in heat and hold mode at 10 °C min−1 under an air flow of 100 mL min−1.
FTIR spectra were recorded in air at room temperature on a Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrophotometer, equipped with an Olympus BX52 microscope, in KBr pellets. An Almega XR Dispersive Raman spectrophotometer, equipped with a BX52 microscope and a Nd:YVO4 (532 nm) laser as an excitation source focused over the sample with an Olympus ×10 lens was used for Raman spectroscopic studies. UV-visible spectra were recorded in a range of 200–800 nm using a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer from Agilent; the samples were prepared by dispersing/dissolving in acetonitrile. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using a Shimadzu RF-5301PC Spectrofluorophotometer, with UV excitation at 390 nm (Soret band of NiTMTAA), with a spectral band width of 1.5 nm and wavelength accuracy of 1.5 nm.
SEM characterization was carried out using a JEOL JSM-5900LV instrument operating at 20 kV, coupled to an Oxford EDS spectrometer. TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2010 microscope operating at 200 kV. AFM images were acquired using a JEOL JSPM-5200 microscope in tapping mode.
The conductivity measurements were performed as a bulk response. Approximately 0.5 mg of graphene, NiTMTAA or graphene–NiTMTAA complex solution/dispersion were deposited onto the interdigital gold electrodes (2 μm thickness and 5 μm separation) by drop-casting, followed by air-drying for 5 min. Current–voltage measurements were performed at room temperature with a Keithley 6487 picoammeter with a programmable voltage source.
Theoretical calculations
The DFT results were obtained by using the DMol3 numerical-based density-functional module implemented in the Materials Studio 6.0 software package from Accelrys Inc.75–78 The computational technique of choice was a general gradient approximation (GGA) functional PBE (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof correlation79) with a Grimme dispersion correction80 in conjunction with the double numerical basis set DNP,78 which has a polarization d-function added on all non-hydrogen atoms as well as a polarization p-function added on all H atoms. This choice was made based on the results of our previous report, where we looked for the best calculation technique in the frame of the DMol3 module for the description of noncovalent interactions between tetraazamacrocyclic compounds with carbon nanoclusters (exemplified by the complex between meso-tetraphenylporphine and fullerene C60).81 All-electron core treatment, a global orbital cut-off of 4.5 Å and Fermi orbital occupancy (no thermal smearing) were used. Full geometry optimization and calculation of electronic parameters were performed by using the quality and convergence criteria set to ‘fine’.
Since an exact oxidation state of real graphene systems, that is, the structure and distribution of oxidized functionalities, cannot be known, we tested two very different models of a graphene sheet in order to determine the general trends. Both are based on 96 carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagon of 37 aromatic rings. Such a system has 24 dangling bonds, and the difference between the two models was in the way they were filled. In the model referred to as Gh, they were filled with 24 hydrogen atoms. In the oxygen-containing model Go, the dangling bonds were terminated with 12 carboxylic (COOH), 6 hydroxyl (OH) and 6 carbonyl ((C)O) groups, alternating in the order of COOH, OH, COOH, (C)O, and so on.
The formation energies ΔEnNiTMTAA+G for NiTMTAA+G complexes were calculated according to the following formula:ΔENiTMTAA+G = ENiTMTAA+G − (ENiTMTAA + EG)where Ei is the corresponding absolute energy; G is the Gh or the Go model.
The simultaneous adsorption of many NiTMTAA molecules onto a large graphene sheet was modeled by means of molecular mechanics using the HyperChem version 7.01 software (from Hypercube, Inc.). We employed the MM+ force field with Polak–Ribiere gradient algorithm and a root mean square (RMS) gradient of 0.005 kcal Å−1 mol−1. The graphene model used contained 1400 carbon atoms and 100 hydrogen atoms to fill dangling bonds at the edges, and had dimensions of about 96 × 43 Å after geometry optimization.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the TGA curves of pristine graphene, NiTMTAA along with those for the hybrid samples NiTMTAA+G(1), NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S). According to these data, pristine graphene obtained from exfoliation of graphite with 4-methylanisol is thermally stable under an air atmosphere up to about 600 °C and completely decomposes at about 750° C. Crystalline NiTMTAA decomposes in two steps. The first weight loss of ca. 17% is observed in the temperature range of 240–340 °C, and the second one of 66% between 340 °C and 480 °C, which can be attributed to the decomposition of substituents and the tetraazaannulene system, respectively. At the same time, these two steps cannot be clearly distinguished in the TGA curves for graphene–NiTMTAA nanohybrid. To begin with, even though the same component ratio of 1:3 was employed in both one-day and five-day preparation procedures, the NiTMTAA+G(1) sample exhibits a very low NiTMTAA content of roughly 10% found from the first weight loss until almost 400 °C. This implies that one day is definitely insufficient to reach the adsorption equilibrium between graphene and NiTMTAA, and this is the reason why we will pay less attention to this sample in further discussion. On the other hand, the TGA curves for NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S) samples reveal a much higher contribution of the functionalizing tetraazaannulene molecules than of graphene, as could have been logically expected. In particular, for the precipitated hybrid NiTMTAA+G(P), the first weight loss is of about 53%, and the second, of 32% (that is, a ratio of about 1.7:1); for NiTMTAA+G(S), the corresponding values are 65% and 27% (a weight ratio of about 2.4:1). An additional important observation is that the higher the NiTMTAA content, the lower the decomposition temperatures found for both NiTMTAA and graphene fractions. While the decomposition of crystalline NiTMTAA ends at about 480 °C, this temperature decreases to about 390 °C for NiTMTAA+G(1) and NiTMTAA+G(P), and further to 250 °C for NiTMTAA+G(S). As regards the carbon component, while pristine graphene completely decomposes at ca. 750 °C, the corresponding temperature is about 720 °C for NiTMTAA+G(1), 650 °C for NiTMTAA+G(P), and as low as 400 °C for NiTMTAA+G(S). The lower burning temperatures of both NiTMTAA and graphene in the hybrids indicate that the thermal stability of both components decrease apparently due to two factors: (i) the strong interaction between them results in the local distortion of the stable aromatic structure; (ii) both components in the hybrids are found more exposed to air oxidation than in NiTMTAA crystals and in stacked sheets of pristine graphene.
 Fig. 2  TGA curves for graphene–NiTMTAA nanohybrids in comparison with the curves for nonfunctionalized graphene (G) and neat crystalline NiTMTAA. NiTMTAA+G(1) was obtained after one-day interaction of the components, whereas NiTMTAA+G(P) (precipitate) and NiTMTAA+G(S) (supernatant) resulted from their five-day interaction. 
We employed molecular mechanics modeling to visualize the possible molecular composition of NiTMTAA+G(P) hybrid. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the corresponding TGA curve (Fig. 2) exhibits weight losses of about 53% due to NiTMTAA and of 32% due to graphene, thus suggesting their approximate weight ratio of 1.7:1. The molecular model was based on a graphene sheet composed of 1400 C atoms and 100 H atoms to fill dangling bonds at the edges (Fig. 3). To meet the weight ratio of 1.7:1, one had to add 36 NiTMTAA molecules (72 in total) on each side of the graphene sheet. After geometry optimization using an MM+ force field, we found that the resulting distribution of NiTMTAA molecules over the graphene model is relatively uniform, providing a nearly full surface coverage of the latter (Fig. 3a). In the above model, we adopted an orientation of NiTMTAA macrocycles in which CH3 groups contact the graphene sheet. Changing it to the one with benzo substituents interacting with graphene would unlikely change the surface arrangement, whereas accommodating NiTMTAA molecules with their plane perpendicular to the graphene sheet would significantly increase their surface density. Such a possibility could exist in the case of NiTMTAA+G(S) with a higher content of tetraazaannulene, according to TGA (Fig. 2): for this sample, the weight loss of about 65% was due to NiTMTAA and of 27%, due to graphene. The resulting weight ratio of about 2.4:1 is met when 101 NiTMTAA molecules are accommodated on the graphene sheet, for example, by placing 50 and 51 tetraazaannulene molecules on different sides of the sheet. In turn, this can be done in two extreme ways, when all the adsorbed macrocycles are either flat or approximately perpendicular with respect to graphene plane: the surface coverage in the former model roughly approaches 1.5 layers, whereas the latter case would correspond to incomplete monolayer, as illustrated in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. The geometry of both models was optimized by using MM+ force field; the calculated formation energy for the “flat adsorption” model (Fig. 3b) was 12449.8 kcal mol−1, and for the “perpendicular adsorption” model (Fig. 3c), 12607.5 kcal mol−1, that is, by 157.7 kcal mol−1 higher. In other words, the flat orientation pattern of tetraazaannulene adsorption turned to be more thermodynamically favorable than the perpendicular one, which is quite logical for a highly-conjugated cyclic molecule interacting with the planar, aromatic graphene surface.
 Fig. 3  Molecular models (top and side views) matching the composition of NiTMTAA+G(P) (a) and NiTMTAA+G(S) (b, c) hybrids, whose geometries were optimized using MM+ force field. The composition was simulated based on TGA curves (Fig. 2): NiTMTAA+G(P) exhibited weight losses of about 53% due to NiTMTAA and of 32% due to graphene (a weight ratio of about 1.7:1); in the case of NiTMTAA+G(S), the weight loss of about 65% was due to NiTMTAA and of 27%, due to graphene (a weight ratio of about 2.4:1). The graphene sheet model was composed of 1400 C atoms and 100 H atoms to fill dangling bonds at the edges; in all complexes with NiTMTAA, its geometry optimized previously was frozen to accelerate convergence. The model (a) was obtained by accommodating 36 NiTMTAA molecules (72 in total) on each side of the graphene sheet; the models (b, c), by accommodating 50 and 51 NiTMTAA molecules on different sides of the sheet to have 101 molecules in total. The models (a, c) correspond to the formation of monomolecular layers of NiTMTAA on both sides of graphene, whereas the surface coverage in model (b) roughly approaches 1.5 layers. The orientation of NiTMTAA molecules with respect to graphene is flat in (a, b), and approximately perpendicular in (c). The calculated formation energy for model (b) is 12449.8 kcal mol−1, and for model (c) is 12607.5 kcal mol−1; that is, the flat orientation pattern of tetraazaannulene adsorption is more thermodynamically favorable than the perpendicular one by 157.7 kcal mol−1. 
The contribution of NiTMTAA and graphene components into electromagnetic spectra of their hybrids depends on the type of spectroscopy. For example, FTIR spectra of pristine graphene as well as of NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S) samples (Fig. 4) all show the presence of prominent peaks due to adsorbed water at 3436 (νOH) and 1630 cm−1 (δOH), strong absorption of epoxide groups (νC–O) at 1083 cm−1 and hydroxyl groups (νC–OH) at 1384 cm−1. Even though the content of tetraazaannulene in the hybrids is very high, of more than 50% by weight, the contribution of infrared absorption due to NiTMTAA molecules is barely detectable. In particular, the absorption at 1390–1530 cm−1 due to νCC vibrations in the aromatic system slightly contributes to the already existing hydroxyl absorption of graphene in the same spectral region. The contribution of CH3 groups of NiTMTAA manifests itself as the bands due to symmetric and asymmetric νCC vibrations at 2852 and 2922 cm−1, respectively. Naturally, all the contributions due to the macrocyclic molecules are more evident in the FTIR spectrum for supernatant sample NiTMTAA+G(S).
 Fig. 4  FTIR spectra of NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S) samples, in comparison with the spectra for nonfunctionalized graphene (G) and neat crystalline NiTMTAA. 
The general picture in the case of Raman spectra presents a complete contrast (Fig. 5). The Raman spectrum of nonfunctionalized graphene exhibits three sharp characteristic peaks: a D (disorder) peak at 1339 cm−1, a G (graphene) peak at 1572 cm−1, and a 2D peak at 2696 cm−1. The presence of an intense D peak indicates that the graphene material employed is not defect-free.82 Furthermore, the shape, width and position of the 2D peak allows for an estimation of the number of layers in the samples studied as from one to five. The Raman spectra for graphene–NiTMTAA nanohybrids conserve the dominating G peak around 1570 cm−1, besides showing a number of bands corresponding to NiTMTAA molecules at 1377, 1513, 2700, 2935 cm−1. All the latter bands exhibit shifted frequencies with respect to those for crystalline NiTMTAA, which is indicative of strong interactions between macrocyclic molecules and graphene layers in the hybrids. Contrary to the FTIR spectra (Fig. 4), Raman spectra for both NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S) turn out to be more similar to that for the neat NiTMTAA than for pristine graphene, with the bands better resolved for the supernatant sample. The fact that Raman spectra of the hybrids are dominated by the bands due to tetraazaannulene is apparently associated with the manifestation of the graphene-enhanced Raman scattering (GERS)83 phenomenon, recently discovered for phthalocyanines, porphyrins and other pigments adsorbed on graphene. On the other hand, broadening of the observed absorption bands due to NiTMTAA can be explained by a high degree of disorder in the adsorbed tetraazaannulene layers.

UV-vis absorption spectra of graphene–NiTMTAA hybrids have a more additive character (Fig. 6). Graphene exhibits strong short-wavelength bands with maxima at 223 and 279 nm. Similar absorption can be found for the neat NiTMTAA, due to its highly conjugated structure, along with a strong Soret band at about 390 nm due to π–π* transitions in the tetraazaannulene ligand, and with a weaker band around 583 nm associated with ligand-to-metal charge transfer.69a The UV-vis spectra for NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S) combine the above absorption features, without notable shifts for any of them. These results can be interpreted as keeping the electronic structure of the interacting components generally unperturbed, which is a known advantage of noncovalent functionalization techniques.

Based on the Beer–Lambert law, we estimated the band gap width from the UV-visible spectra. For this purpose, the first absorption band was fitted by a first order and third degree curve. The band gap value is given by the intersection with the energy axis of the tangent to the inflection point of the first absorption band. The approximation was performed using curves with a correlation factor greater than 0.99. The first derivative of the spectrum was plotted, and it was determined by inspection of the curve and the data table of the point where the derivative marks an increase (defined by the rise of the absorption in the original spectrum); the resulting value of the energy was considered as the band gap width. The values obtained for pristine graphene, NiTMTAA, NiTMTAA+G(S) and NiTMTAA+G(P) are 0.18, 1.96, 1.76 and 1.81 eV, respectively. One can see that the difference between the two hybrid samples is not significant, of ca. 0.05 eV, and the corresponding values are much closer to that of neat NiTMTAA than to the band gap of the nonfunctionalized graphene.
Fluorescence spectral measurements found clear manifestations of graphene–NiTMTAA interactions. Three samples were tested: pristine graphene at 0.029 mg mL−1, neat NiTMTAA at 0.029 mg mL−1, and a mixture of graphene and NiTMTAA at 0.029 mg mL−1 each. The spectra were recorded immediately after mixing graphene and NiTMTAA, then after one, two and five days; the changes observed with time were insignificant. As an example, Fig. 7 shows the spectra in the range of 400–700 nm acquired after five days. One can see that both the pristine graphene and the NiTMTAA exhibit weak fluorescence with prominent bands around 438 and 443 nm, respectively. Mixing graphene and NiTMTAA in an equal weight proportion gives rise to quenching of the fluorescence intensity for both components, and the resulting emission level becomes roughly one order of magnitude lower than that of pristine graphene.

For the microscopic characterization, we employed SEM, TEM and AFM techniques, which all revealed dramatic morphological changes as a result of noncovalent functionalization of graphene with NiTMTAA. According to SEM images shown in Fig. 8a, b, pristine graphene is composed of sheets of variable sizes, mainly of the order of 102–103 nm. The functionalization with NiTMTAA causes the disappearance of sharp edges of the sheets and their aggregates due to a dense and thick amorphous layer of tetraazaannulene molecules (Fig. 8d, e, g, h). In turn, this effect is more evident in the case of NiTMTAA+G(S) (Fig. 8g, h), where the content of NiTMTAA is considerably higher. The average size of functionalized graphene sheets is clearly larger in NiTMTAA+G(P) than in NiTMTAA+G(S): this fractionation is quite natural, since the former is a precipitated fraction and the latter is a supernatant. Another manifestation of the higher tetraazaanulene concentration in NiTMTAA+G(S) as compared to the NiTMTAA+G(P) sample is a higher intensity of Ni Lα and Ni Kα peaks at 0.851 and 7.471 keV, respectively, relative to the intensity of carbon Kα peak at 0.277 keV in the EDS spectra (Fig. 8f, i).
 Fig. 8  Representative SEM images at two different magnifications and EDS spectra of nonfunctionalized graphene (a, b and c, respectively), NiTMTAA+G(P) (d, e and f, respectively) and NiTMTAA+G(S) (g, h and i, respectively). 
The differences in sheet size between samples are even more obvious at higher magnifications provided by TEM and AFM techniques. In particular, single sheets of the typical morphology and their stacks dominate in the TEM image of pristine material in Fig. 9a. Their variable size of 102–103 nm matches the one estimated by SEM, and in addition, one can distinguish by TEM some smaller fragments, of the order of 10 nm. The thick amorphous layer of NiTMTAA suggested by SEM observations completely masks the typical morphology of pristine graphene sheets in both NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S) (Fig. 9b,c). Furthermore, the fractionation into precipitate and supernatant during the sample preparation makes the sheet size of about 200–300 nm dominate in the case of NiTMTAA+G(S) (Fig. 9c), whereas larger fragments remain almost exclusively in NiTMTAA+G(P).

The results of AFM imaging are consistent with SEM and TEM observations in terms of both graphene morphology and particle size, with some additional details. As illustrated in Fig. 10a, the maximum size of graphene sheets in pristine material can reach several micrometers. After NiTMTAA functionalization, objects of this size become very difficult to observe due to their considerable height, complicating good-quality scanning. On the other hand, smaller functionalized sheets of 102–103 nm size are very common and readily observable (Fig. 10c–f). AFM reveals globular formations on their surfaces due to heterogeneities in the structure of the adsorbed tetraazaanulene layer and/or the presence of graphene particles smaller than 100 nm. And again, the average size of functionalized graphene sheets is smaller for NiTMTAA+G(S) than for the NiTMTAA+G(P) sample.

Detailed information on the mechanisms of graphene–NiTMTAA interactions at a molecular level is highly desirable, but virtually impossible to obtain by any experimental technique, which is a common situation in the chemistry of functionalized nanomaterials. On the other hand, atomistic computer simulations can provide an important insight into the materials structure and properties. A very approximate idea of the mechanisms of tetraazaannulene interaction with graphene sheets was already obtained from MM+ geometry optimization calculations mentioned above: they suggested a preferable flat orientation of NiTMTAA molecules on the graphene surface (Fig. 3). Molecular mechanics, however, is incapable of accounting for electronic factors, and therefore we applied a DFT computational technique. Based on our previous test calculations on similar fullerene–porphyrin systems,81 here we employed the PBE GGA functional with Grimme's long-range dispersion correction, which is essential for noncovalently bonded molecular systems, in conjunction with the DNP basis set.
An adequate selection of a graphene sheet model was somewhat problematic, since an exact oxidation state of real graphene systems in terms of the structure and distribution of oxidized functionalities cannot be known. Our solution was to test two very different, extreme in a sense, models of a graphene sheet in order to determine general common trends. Both (Fig. 11) are regular hexagons composed of 37 aromatic rings (96 carbon atoms in total), with the edges terminating with 24 dangling bonds. The difference between the two models consists in the method of filling these free valencies. The ‘reduced’ model in which they were filled with 24 hydrogen atoms is referred to as Gh. In the second, ‘oxidized’ model Go, the dangling bonds were terminated with 12 carboxylic (COOH), 6 hydroxyl (OH) and 6 carbonyl ((C)O) groups, alternating in the order of COOH, OH, COOH, (C)O, and so on, as shown in Fig. 11.
 Fig. 11  Two models of graphene sheets employed for DFT calculations of NiTMTAA interaction with nonoxidized and oxidized graphene (Gh and Go, respectively), along with the corresponding noncovalent complexes in which NiTMTAA adopts three possible orientations with respect to the graphene surface: NiTMTAA-b+Gi (where i = h,o), flat with benzo rings contacting Gi; NiTMTAA-m+Gi, flat with CH3 substituents contacting Gi; and NiTMTAA-e+Gi, perpendicular orientation with only two CH3 substituents contacting Gi. The geometries were optimized by using PBE GGA functional with Grimme dispersion correction in conjunction with the DNP basis set. Atom colors: C, grey; H, white; O, red; N, deep blue; Ni, light blue. 
On both graphene models, the NiTMTAA molecule was found to adopt three stable orientations, whose optimized geometries are shown in Fig. 11. The input geometries subjected to optimization contemplated two flat orientations, in which either benzo rings (NiTMTAA-b+Gh and NiTMTAA-b+Go complexes) or four CH3 groups (NiTMTAA-m+Gh and NiTMTAA-m+Go) contacted the graphene surface, and one perpendicular, ‘edge’ orientation with only two CH3 substituents contacted the sheet (NiTMTAA-e+Gh and NiTMTAA-e+Go). During geometry optimization, in five cases the NiTMTAA molecules kept their characteristic saddle shape. But in the calculated structure of NiTMTAA-b+Go, tetraazaannulene turned out to be strongly distorted (shown in detail in Fig. 12): in the input orientation of NiTMTAA, both benzo rings contacted Go graphene with four CH3 groups directed to the opposite side, whereas in the optimized structure, two CH3 groups were attracted to Go and forced the closest side of o-C6H4 groups to turn away.
 Fig. 12  A strong distortion of the typical saddle-shaped conformation of TMTAA ligand found after geometry optimization of NiTMTAA-b+Go complex. In the starting orientation of NiTMTAA (ball-and-stick model), both benzo rings contacted Go graphene (wire model), with four CH3 groups directed to the opposite side. In the optimized structure, two CH3 groups were attracted to Go (grey arrow) and forced the closest side of the o-C6H4 groups to turn away (black arrow). 

Table 1 summarizes the calculated total energies, HOMO/LUMO orbital energies and HOMO–LUMO gap energies for NiTMTAA, graphene models and the above six noncovalent complexes, formation energies for the complexes and the corresponding shortest HNiTMTAA⋯CG, NNiTMTAA⋯CG and NiNiTMTAA⋯CG distances between NiTMTAA and graphene models, as well as the values of Mulliken and Hirshfeld charge at Ni atom in isolated NiTMTAA and in its complexes with Gh and Go. As could be expected, a larger area of contact between the NiTMTAA molecule and the graphene sheet results in stronger interaction. In particular, for NiTMTAA-b+Gh, NiTMTAA-m+Gh and NiTMTAA-e+Gh complexes, the calculated formation energies are −31.9, −30.5 and −9.3 kcal mol−1; for NiTMTAA-b+Go, NiTMTAA-m+Go and NiTMTAA-e+Go, the corresponding values are −37.9, −39.5 and −14.2 kcal mol−1. One can see that NiTMTAA binding is by 5–9 kcal mol−1 stronger with the oxidized graphene model as compared to that with Gh.

We expected that NiTMTAA-b+Gh and NiTMTAA-b+Go will exhibit considerably lower negative energies (i.e., higher absolute values) as compared to NiTMTAA-m+Gh and NiTMTAA-m+Go, respectively, due to the contribution of π–π stacking effects between the two aromatic components. Nevertheless, it was the case only for Gh models, where the binding in NiTMTAA-b+Gh complex turned out to be by 1.4 kcal mol−1 stronger than in NiTMTAA-m+Gh (which actually is not a big difference). For Go models, the formation energy for NiTMTAA-m+Go complex is by 1.6 kcal mol−1 lower than that for NiTMTAA-b+Go; besides that, if the contact of benzo rings with graphene was not partially changed to the interaction through CH3 groups, the binding between NiTMTAA and Go would most likely be even weaker.
We analyzed how the calculated formation energies for NiTMTAA+Gi complexes correlate with the corresponding shortest HNiTMTAA⋯CG, NNiTMTAA⋯CG and NiNiTMTAA⋯CG distances between NiTMTAA and graphene models, presented in Table 1. No correlation was found for HNiTMTAA⋯CG short contacts, whereas formation energies generally increase (that is, binding decreases) for longer NNiTMTAA⋯CG and NiNiTMTAA⋯CG distances, as illustrated by the plot in Fig. 13. This observation can be interpreted as the interaction of the Ni–N4 coordination sphere with the graphene surface to be the main factor determining complex stability.
 Fig. 13  Graphic interrelation between the calculated formation energies for NiTMTAA+Gi complexes and the corresponding shortest NNiTMTAA⋯CG and NiNiTMTAA⋯CG distances between NiTMTAA and graphene models. 
Calculated electronic properties strongly depend on the graphene model considered. In particular, this refers to electrostatic potential (ESP) plots shown in Fig. 14. The ESP isosurface for the isolated NiTMTAA molecule has negative lobes associated with the Ni–N4 coordination sphere and benzo substituents. The ‘reduced’ model Gh has no visible negative lobes at 0.02 a.u. isosurface, whereas they are very extended for Go due to electronegative oxygen-containing functional groups. Complexation between NiTMTAA and Gh not only brings the negative lobes of tetraazaannulene into the resulting isosurface, but considerably expands them, including to the side of graphene opposite to the flatly adsorbed NiTMTAA molecule: this is especially clearly seen for NiTMTAA-b+Gh. In contrast, in the complexes with the ‘oxidized’ Go model, the negative lobes from NiTMTAA almost totally disappear.
 Fig. 14  Plots of electrostatic potential (isosurfaces at 0.02 a.u.) for NiTMTAA, graphene models, and their noncovalent complexes in which NiTMTAA adopts three possible orientations with respect to the graphene surface, as explained in Fig. 11. Both side and front views are shown for the complexes. Blue and yellow lobes correspond to positive and negative potential, respectively. 
Differences in the behavior of frontier orbital plots depending on the graphene model were also found. The usual trend observed in DFT calculations on the complexes of tetraazaannulenes (including porphyrins) with carbon nanoclusters (fullerene C60 and carbon nanotube models)70,81,84–89 is that HOMO is found on the macrocycle, and LUMO, on the carbon nanocluster. As is illustrated in Fig. 15, this rule is fully met for NiTMTAA complexes with Gh. However, in the case of their counterparts with the Go model, a fraction of LUMO can be found on the tetraazaannulene component, which is especially evident in NiTMTAA-e+Go. A minor presence of HOMO on the Go component in the complexes can be noticed as well, on some CO groups.

Table 1 also lists the computed HOMO–LUMO gap energies. One should remember that the small cluster models employed for cost efficiency considerations cannot be compared with the experimentally measured electronic characteristics of real graphene systems, such as, the band gap values derived from UV-visible spectra, discussed above. According to DFT results, the complexation reduces the HOMO–LUMO gap for both NiTMTAA and graphene models. Curiously, this effect is stronger for the weakly-bound complexes NiTMTAA-e+Gh and especially NiTMTAA-e+Go, for which the gap values are 0.557 and 0.006 eV, respectively, compared to 1.349 eV for Gh, 0.806 eV for Go, and 2.332 eV for NiTMTAA; we cannot offer a reasonable explanation for this result.
The analysis of the Mulliken and Hirshfeld positive charge on the Ni atom of NiTMTAA (Table 1) showed that, generally, it increases insignificantly due to the interaction with graphene models. The larger Mulliken charge is always associated with stronger binding, and also, its value is higher for the complexes with Go vs. Gh. In particular, it increases from 0.526 in isolated NiTMTAA to 0.546 in NiTMTAA-b+Gh and 0.554 in NiTMTAA-m+Go. In most cases, this trend is met for the Hirshfeld charge, with the only exception being the least stable NiTMTAA-e+Go, exhibiting the highest value of 0.101, compared to the charge of 0.079 of the Ni atom in isolated NiTMTAA.
Finally, as a representative electronic parameter, we experimentally measured the electrical conductivity of a series of samples including pristine graphene, NiTMTAA, NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S): the values obtained are 4.5 × 10−2, 1.3 × 10−9, 3.6 × 10−2, and 7.9 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively. The corresponding current–voltage characteristics are presented in Fig. 16. From both data sets, one can see that even though graphene sheets in the NiTMTAA+G(P) sample are fully covered with tetraazaannulene (according to TGA, Fig. 2, and molecular modeling, Fig. 3), the conductivity of this hybrid is very close to that of pristine graphene. This finding favors a flat orientation of NiTMTAA molecules on the graphene surface, as in the model complexes NiTMTAA-b+Gh, NiTMTAA-m+Gh, NiTMTAA-b+Go and NiTMTAA-m+Go (Fig. 11), besides suggesting a preferable conductivity mechanism through the Ni–N4 coordination sphere of the adsorbed tetraazaannulene. Furthermore, while the NiTMTAA content in the NiTMTAA+G(S) sample is roughly 10% higher than in NiTMTAA+G(P), this relatively small increase in the tetraazaannulene content causes a dramatic loss in conductivity of almost three orders of magnitude. Our interpretation for this phenomenon is that the increase of NiTMTAA content gives rise to a structural rearrangement of adsorbed tetraazaannulene molecules from their flat orientation to the perpendicular form (as illustrated by NiTMTAA-e+Gh and NiTMTAA-e+Go models in Fig. 11), in which the electron mobility through the Ni–N4 coordination sphere is hindered and the distance between graphene sheets increases. Another possible factor affecting the conductivity of the NiTMTAA+G(S) sample can be the smaller size of graphene sheets found by SEM, TEM and AFM (Fig. 8–10).

Conclusions
The physical adsorption of NiTMTAA can be used for the noncovalent functionalization of graphene, similarly to the functionalization with more complex porphyrins and phthalocyanines. Tetraazaannulene molecules cover graphene sheets with a dense layer (mainly monolayer, according to molecular mechanics modeling), which manifests itself in morphological changes observable by SEM, TEM and AFM microscopic techniques. FTIR, Raman and UV-visible spectra are generally additive where the features of both components can be simultaneously observed.
According to the results of DFT calculations of NiTMTAA adsorption on two different graphene models, flat orientation of tetraazaannulene with respect to graphene is energetically preferable, with little difference being seen whether benzo or methyl groups contact the sheet.
Fluorescence spectral measurements found clear manifestations of graphene–NiTMTAA interactions. NiTMTAA and graphene behave as mutual quenchers: in particular, mixing the two components in an equal weight proportion gives rise to quenching of the fluorescence intensity for both components, and the resulting emission level becomes roughly one order of magnitude lower than that of pristine graphene.
Electrical conductivity of graphene–NiTMTAA hybrids decreases with increasing the tetraazaannulene content.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  The structure of the nickel(II) complex of 5,7,12,14-tetramethyldibenzo-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-3,5,7,10,12,14-hexaene, also called Ni(II)-tetramethyldibenzotetraaza[14]annulene, or simply NiTMTAA.	 
ΔENiTMTAA+G = ENiTMTAA+G − (ENiTMTAA + EG)

 	Fig. 2  TGA curves for graphene–NiTMTAA nanohybrids in comparison with the curves for nonfunctionalized graphene (G) and neat crystalline NiTMTAA. NiTMTAA+G(1) was obtained after one-day interaction of the components, whereas NiTMTAA+G(P) (precipitate) and NiTMTAA+G(S) (supernatant) resulted from their five-day interaction.	 

 	Fig. 3  Molecular models (top and side views) matching the composition of NiTMTAA+G(P) (a) and NiTMTAA+G(S) (b, c) hybrids, whose geometries were optimized using MM+ force field. The composition was simulated based on TGA curves (Fig. 2): NiTMTAA+G(P) exhibited weight losses of about 53% due to NiTMTAA and of 32% due to graphene (a weight ratio of about 1.7:1); in the case of NiTMTAA+G(S), the weight loss of about 65% was due to NiTMTAA and of 27%, due to graphene (a weight ratio of about 2.4:1). The graphene sheet model was composed of 1400 C atoms and 100 H atoms to fill dangling bonds at the edges; in all complexes with NiTMTAA, its geometry optimized previously was frozen to accelerate convergence. The model (a) was obtained by accommodating 36 NiTMTAA molecules (72 in total) on each side of the graphene sheet; the models (b, c), by accommodating 50 and 51 NiTMTAA molecules on different sides of the sheet to have 101 molecules in total. The models (a, c) correspond to the formation of monomolecular layers of NiTMTAA on both sides of graphene, whereas the surface coverage in model (b) roughly approaches 1.5 layers. The orientation of NiTMTAA molecules with respect to graphene is flat in (a, b), and approximately perpendicular in (c). The calculated formation energy for model (b) is 12449.8 kcal mol−1, and for model (c) is 12607.5 kcal mol−1; that is, the flat orientation pattern of tetraazaannulene adsorption is more thermodynamically favorable than the perpendicular one by 157.7 kcal mol−1.	 

 	Fig. 4  FTIR spectra of NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S) samples, in comparison with the spectra for nonfunctionalized graphene (G) and neat crystalline NiTMTAA.	 

 	Fig. 5  Raman spectra of NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S) samples, in comparison with the spectra for nonfunctionalized graphene (G) and neat crystalline NiTMTAA.	 

 	Fig. 6  UV-visible spectra in solution/suspension of NiTMTAA+G(P) and NiTMTAA+G(S) samples, in comparison with the spectra for nonfunctionalized graphene (G) and neat crystalline NiTMTAA.	 

 	Fig. 7  Comparison of fluorescence spectra for the solution/dispersion of pristine graphene, NiTMTAA and their mixture of equal concentration by weight, five days after mixing. Concentrations: G, 0.029 mg mL−1; NiTMTAA, 0.029 mg mL−1; NiTMTAA+G, 0.029 mg mL−1 graphene and 0.029 mg mL−1 NiTMTAA.	 

 	Fig. 8  Representative SEM images at two different magnifications and EDS spectra of nonfunctionalized graphene (a, b and c, respectively), NiTMTAA+G(P) (d, e and f, respectively) and NiTMTAA+G(S) (g, h and i, respectively).	 

 	Fig. 9  Representative TEM images of nonfunctionalized graphene (a), NiTMTAA+G(P) (b) and NiTMTAA+G(S) hybrid (c).	 

 	Fig. 10  Representative AFM images at two different magnifications of nonfunctionalized graphene (a, b), NiTMTAA+G(P) (c, d) and NiTMTAA+G(S) hybrid (e, f).	 

 	Fig. 11  Two models of graphene sheets employed for DFT calculations of NiTMTAA interaction with nonoxidized and oxidized graphene (Gh and Go, respectively), along with the corresponding noncovalent complexes in which NiTMTAA adopts three possible orientations with respect to the graphene surface: NiTMTAA-b+Gi (where i = h,o), flat with benzo rings contacting Gi; NiTMTAA-m+Gi, flat with CH3 substituents contacting Gi; and NiTMTAA-e+Gi, perpendicular orientation with only two CH3 substituents contacting Gi. The geometries were optimized by using PBE GGA functional with Grimme dispersion correction in conjunction with the DNP basis set. Atom colors: C, grey; H, white; O, red; N, deep blue; Ni, light blue.	 

 	Fig. 12  A strong distortion of the typical saddle-shaped conformation of TMTAA ligand found after geometry optimization of NiTMTAA-b+Go complex. In the starting orientation of NiTMTAA (ball-and-stick model), both benzo rings contacted Go graphene (wire model), with four CH3 groups directed to the opposite side. In the optimized structure, two CH3 groups were attracted to Go (grey arrow) and forced the closest side of the o-C6H4 groups to turn away (black arrow).
