    , Accepted 18th June 2012First published on 19th June 2012AbstractA simple selective etching process easily removed a 2nd anodized TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) layer from a physically stable 1st anodized TNTs layer to produce noncurling, freestanding, large-area aligned doubly open-ended TNTs. These TNTs were easily transferred to a conducting glass for use in fabricating front-illuminated dye sensitized solar cells.
Ever since three-dimensional networks of TiO2 nanoparticles (TNP) were first reported by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991 as useful in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs),1 they have been used most frequently in DSC photoanodes.2 The nanoporous TiO2 networks of TNPs offer a high internal surface area for anchoring large quantities of dyes and maximizing light harvesting, thereby affording abundant photoinduced electrons. Photoinduced electrons undergo trap-limited diffusion through the interconnected TiO2 layer. Interfacial recombination between the injected electrons in TiO2 and oxidized species, such as I3− and dye cations (dye+), constitutes a major loss mechanism that competes with productive transport processes.3 Highly-ordered TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) may provide an alternative electron transport material that reduces charge recombination and increases electron collection relative to conventional disordered nanoparticle channels, as demonstrated by Frank et al.4 Several reports have described the preparation of films comprising doubly open-ended TNTs.8,9 This type of TNT film overcomes a critical limitation of DSCs prepared using films comprising singly open-ended TNTs on Ti foil, which require back-side illumination to overcome the opacity of the Ti substrate. At the back-side illumination, the power conversion efficiencies of these devices were low. The Pt-coated counter electrode partially reflected light, and the iodine/iodide electrolyte absorbed photons in the near-UV region, which decreased light harvesting.5–7
Two-step anodization and chemical etching are, in general, used to fabricate films of freestanding doubly open-ended TNTs. For example, Wang and Liu10 reported an in situ anodization method for the fabrication of doubly open-ended TNT films that involved rapidly increasing the voltage applied toward the end of the 2nd anodization step. This method occasionally damaged the TNT surfaces under the potential shock. Chen et al. further developed a two-step anodization method using a 1 h 200 °C annealing process prior to the 2nd anodization step.11 The bottom layer of TNTs remained amorphous, and further etching proceeded over the closed bottom layers. In this method, a target TNT film was separated from the Ti foil by increasing the anodizing temperature under an extended 2nd anodization step; however, this introduced a risk that the surface of the target TNT could be etched during the high-temperature 2nd anodization step. Here, we describe a simple selective etching method that produces noncurling, freestanding, large-area, aligned TNTs with both ends open, even in the amorphous state, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The films prepared by this method could be easily detached from a Ti foil without curling, then transferred to a substrate for the fabrication of front-illuminated DSCs (see Fig. 2(a)). This process mainly involved 4 steps: (i) a 1st anodization step, (ii) thermal annealing, (iii) a 2nd anodization step, and (iv) detachment and selective etching.

(c) SEM image of the top surface. (d) SEM image of the bottom surface. 
After the 1st anodization step, the sample was thermally annealed at 250 °C for 2 h to achieve a physically and chemically stable amorphous phase that allowed the 1st TNT layer to be connected to the 2nd TNT layer formed during the 2nd anodization step. This process yielded a 1st membrane comprising doubly open-ended TNTs. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†) revealed that the amorphous phase was stable up to a temperature of 250 °C. Anatase peaks12 appeared after thermal treatment at 260 °C, indicating that the highest physical and chemical stability in an amorphous phase could be reached prior to the 2nd anodization step at a temperature of 250 °C. Therefore, thermal treatment of the 1st anodized layer at temperatures beyond 260 °C provided a high resistance to chemical etching, and the bottom of the 1st layer remained closed (Fig. S3, ESI†), despite further anodization steps, consistent with previous reports.5–7
A 2nd 60 V anodization period of 10 min was identified as optimal for easily removing the film from the Ti foil, yielding a 1.0 μm thick 2nd layer (Fig. 2(b)). The double-layered NT membrane could be easily detached from the Ti foil by immersion of the TNT film into a 33 wt% H2O2 solution over 5 min. No curling occurred during the detachment process due to the physical stability. The TNT debris and the thin 2nd bottom layer were selectively removed by further etching in an identical solution. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show SEM images of the top and bottom surfaces of the thick 1st layer, respectively, prepared from the simple selective etching. The formation of aligned doubly open-ended TiO2 nanotubes was clearly visible. We easily prepared TNT films with a range of thicknesses (6–27 μm), as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b). These results demonstrated the high reproducibility of the method.
Although the detached TNTs did not curl upon annealing at 250 °C, due to their high physical stability, the morphology of the TNT membrane top surface may have been affected by the extended etching time.8b,c A detached TNT membrane was immersed in a 33 wt% H2O2 solution, and the effects of the immersion time on the morphological changes of the top surface were investigated, along with the removal of the 2nd layer (Fig. 3). The detached films comprised two TNT layers. Both layers were amorphous; however the upper 1st layer was more chemically stable than the 2nd thin layer. The 1st layer had previously been annealed at 250 °C, and the 2nd thin layer could be easily and selectively removed by prolonged etching at 60 min to yield doubly open-ended TNTs. Etching times greater than 60 min yielded disorderly clustered TNTs in the top 1st layer, and the entire film dissolved into the etching solution after 180 min. It should be noted that a damaged top surface was observed when a 2nd anodization was performed over 1 h.

The large-sized amorphous freestanding doubly open-ended TNTs were easily transferred to the FTO substrate to fabricate TNT-based DSCs. A 2 μm thick TNP was prepared on top of the FTO. The TNP easily entered the inner tube walls to fill the interfacial gap and provide good electrical connections between the TNTs (14 μm) and the TNPs (2 μm).

Fig. 4 shows the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) properties of the TNT-based DSCs. The photovoltaic parameters as a function of the quantity of dye adsorbed onto the TNPs or TNTs are summarized in Table 1. The TNP layer (2 μm) contributed 2.3% to the power conversion efficiency (η), with a JSC = 4.3 mA cm−2, VOC = 759 mV, and a FF = 0.69. The front-illuminated DSC (TNT) exhibited JSC = 17.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 723 mV, and a FF = 0.70, providing η of 8.6% at a tube length of 14 μm. Conventional DSCs with TNPs displayed JSC = 17.0 mA cm−2, VOC = 687 mV, a FF = 0.63, and provided η = 7.3%. Considering that the dye loading value was 20% lower in the TNT-based DSC than in the TNP-based DSC, the JSC of the TNP-based DSC appeared to exceed that of the TNP-based DSC. However, the JSC for the TNP-based DSC was similar to that for the TNP-based DSC, indicating the presence of a dominant photoinduced electron loss mechanism, which decreased VOC and JSC in the TNP-based DSCs. Indeed, the VOC of the TNP-based DSC was 36 mV lower than that of the TNT-based DSC. In turn, the charge collection efficiency of the TNT-based DSC was superior to that of the TNP-based DSC.

The charge collection efficiency (ηcc) was calculated based on the electron transport time (τtrans) to the photoanode through the TiO2 network and electron lifetime (τe) of the photo-injected electrons in TiO2 according to the following equation:4ηcc = 1 − (τtrans/τe). Intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS, short-circuit) and photovoltage (IMVS, open-circuit) spectroscopy were used to determine τtrans and τe, respectively. Fig. 5(a) shows τtrans and τe as a function of the applied light intensity obtained from the IMPS/IMVS measurements. The τtrans values for the TNP- and TNT-based DSCs were comparable, considering that the film thicknesses in the devices were similar.4 This indicated that the photoinduced electron transport time was governed by the thickness of the TiO2 layer; however, τe for the TNT-based DSCs was almost 10 times longer than that of the TNP-based DSCs, which corresponded to a lower chance of charge recombination in the TNT than in the TNP network. This result agreed well with the VOC trends observed among the devices. The VOC of the TNT-based device was 36 mV greater than that of the TNP-based device. The VOC was largely affected by recombination, and a lower recombination resulted in a higher VOC.13 The calculated ηcc, indeed, was higher in the TNT-based DSC than in the TNP-based DSC, over 95% at all incident photon fluxes. The high ηcc contributed significantly to the enhanced JSC of the TNT-based devices (Fig. 5(b)).

In conclusion, we demonstrated a selective etching method for fabricating aligned doubly open-ended TiO2 nanotubes. The thin 2nd bottom layer (1 μm) was selectively removed by a 33% H2O2 solution from a physically stable, thick, amorphous 1st top layer, resulting in large-area noncurling, freestanding TNT arrays that did not crack, even in the amorphous state. The amorphous doubly open-ended TNTs were easily transferred to an FTO substrate for fabricating front-illuminated DSCs. The TNT-based DSCs exhibited a photoinduced electron lifetime 10 times longer than was observed in the TNP-based device, resulting in a 35 mV greater VOC. In addition, the TNT-based DSC yielded an ηcc exceeding 95%, 15% greater than that observed for TNP-based DSCs, resulting in η = 8.6% for a 14 μm thick TNT layer. The simple method for fabricating TNTs may be useful in a wide range of application, including photocatalysis and chemical sensors.14
