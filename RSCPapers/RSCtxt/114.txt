    AbstractWe have investigated the role of electrolyte composition, in terms of solvent and additive, on the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been performed in order to describe the geometries and adsorption energies of various adsorbed solvents (nitromethane, acetonitrile and dimethylformamide) and p-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (modeled by methylpyridine) on the ZnO (100) surface using a periodic approach. The densities of states (DOS) have been calculated and the energy position of the conduction band edge (CBE) has been evaluated for the different molecules adsorbed. The effect of the electrolyte composition on the standard redox potential of the iodide/triiodide redox couple has been experimentally determined. These two data values (CBE and standard redox potential) allowed us to determine the dependence of Voc on the electrolyte composition. The variations determined using this method were in good agreement with the measured Voc for cells made of electrodeposited ZnO films sensitized using D149 (indoline) dye. As in the case of TiO2-based cells, a correlation of Voc with the donor number of the adsorbed species was found. The present study clearly points out that both the CBE energy and the redox potential variation are important for explaining the experimentally observed changes in the Voc of DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a large amount of attention due to their potentially low-cost fabrication, easy production and flexibility compared to conventional photovoltaic cells.1 The working principle of a DSSC is presented schematically in Fig. 1. Standard DSSCs are composed of a dye, grafted onto the surface of a wide-bandgap semiconductor, in contact with an electrolyte (typically I3−/I− in an organic solvent) and closed by a counter electrode, usually made of Pt. Upon absorption of light in the visible–near IR wavelength range, dye molecules, promoted to an electronically excited state, can inject electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor, typically an oxide. The oxidized dyes are regenerated by a reducing agent present in the electrolyte (usually I−), which is converted to the corresponding oxidized species (I3−) and subsequently reduced at the counter electrode.
 Fig. 1  (a) Working principles of a DSSC. The open-circuit voltage of the cell is denoted Voc. 
Up to now, the best performances reported in the literature have been obtained with cells composed of a titania nanoparticulate thin film sensitized by a ruthenium polypyridine complex dye (N3 and other derivatives).2,3 In order to improve the cell performance, additives must be added to the electrolyte. Most often, efficient additives are organic molecules such as pyridine derivatives4–7 and guanidinium thiocyanate3,8 which act as coadsorbates for the dye.4,9,10 Their main role is to prevent the back-reaction of injected electrons (into the oxide conduction band) with the scavenger (I3−) present in the electrolyte by passivating, upon adsorption, the semiconductor surface that is uncovered by the dye.
A key parameter to evaluate the performance of DSSCs is the so-called “open-circuit voltage” (Voc, Fig. 1) since the external maximum power output for the cell is directly related to this value. This parameter is defined as the difference between the quasi-Fermi energy level, εF,n, of the semiconductor and the potential of the redox system (eqn (1)): qVoc=εF,n − μ(I3−/I−)(1)where q is the electron charge and μ is the electrochemical potential of the electrolyte. μ is related to the Nernst potential (EN): (2)where E°(I3−/I−) is the standard redox potential of I3−/I−, R is the perfect gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday constant and aX are the activities of the redox species involved.
The electrolyte composition (that is the solvent, the redox couple and the additives) affects both the activity of each species (aX) and the standard electrochemical potential (E°), and thus the overall electrochemical potential. Analogously, the quasi-Fermi energy level (εF,n) also depends on the electrolyte composition. In particular, for an n-type semiconductor (such as ZnO or TiO2) the following relation holds: (3)where EC is the energy of the conduction band edge, kB the Boltzmann constant, nC the electron density in the conduction band (a function of the illumination intensity) and NC the density of states at the bottom of the CB.
Since both solvent and additive molecules can physi- and chemisorb onto the surface, depending on their Lewis basicity and their electron-donor character, their presence in the electrolyte will alter the energy of the CBE (EC) and thus influence the Voc experimentally measured. As a consequence, an in-depth understanding of the variation of Voc requires an accurate description of the variation of both EC and E°(I3−/I−).
The dependency of the open-circuit voltage on the solvent11–13 and some additives6,7,14 has been reported in the literature for TiO2-based solar cells. Indeed up to now, the observed Voc variations have always been interpreted and correlated with the change in CB energy with the electrolyte, whereas the influence of the various electrolytes on E°(I3−/I−) has always been neglected. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic study of these effects has been considered for DSSCs based on oxides other than TiO2.
Since ZnO-based DSSCs appear to be good candidates to overcome some of the technological drawbacks of TiO2-ruthenium-dye-based cells (such as the high temperatures needed to prepare the titania nanoparticulate films3 and the cost of the ruthenium-based dyes) gaining insights into the role played by solvents and additives on their open-circuit voltage is of great interest for optimizing their design. To better understand the physical origin of the relevance of ZnO-based cells, it is worth mentioning the wide bandgap of ZnO (3.37 eV at room temperature), its good electron conductivity15,16 and the possibility of obtaining crystalline ZnO (Fig. S2 of the ESI†) and many various nanostructured forms of ZnO.16–19 Furthermore, ZnO-based photoanodes with high roughness, essential for an optimal dye adsorption, can be prepared by conventional sol–gel methods,15 by solution growth techniques20,21 and by electrodeposition.16,22–25 The latter technique gives rise to well-crystallized layers at low temperatures (below 100 °C) and is suitable for a large variety of fragile substrates.26–29
Two different ZnO morphologies, obtained by electrodeposition, have recently been tested for DSSC applications: ZnO nanowire arrays22 and ZnO mesoporous films.23,24,30 In both cases, due to the growth mechanism of ZnO and the interaction with the solution during the growth, the dominant surface of the resulting ZnO crystal is usually the {100} crystallographic family of planes (see Fig. S2 of the ESI†). Consequently, the subsequent sensitization due to dye grafting occurs mainly on this plane. Up to now, the sensitization of a mesoporous ZnO film presenting this preferential orientation by an indoline metal-free dye called D14931 has yielded a maximum overall photoconversion efficiency of 5.6%.23,30
In this context, the present paper is a joint theoretical and experimental investigation of the influence of solvent and additives on the Voc of ZnO-based DSSCs. Three different organic solvents (nitromethane, NM; acetonitrile, MeCN; and dimethylformamide, DMF, Fig. S1 of the ESI†) were chosen in order to cover a large Lewis basicity range (hereafter quantified by their donor numbers, DN).32 In addition, p-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Fig. S1 of the ESI†) has been used to understand the effect of additives, since it has been demonstrated that this molecule can significantly boost the efficiency of ZnO/N3 solar cells.33 The TBP additive has been modeled using the methylpyridine molecule (MP) in order to decrease the computational burden assuming that MP and TBP have similar donor effects on ZnO surfaces.
The paper is organized as follows. After a brief description of the computational models (section 2) and experimental aspects (section 3), the overall variation of the Voc, characterized by measuring the I–V curves for different D149/ZnO cells prepared using various solvents, with and without the TBP additive, is discussed (section 4.1). Next, the results in terms of structural and energetic features obtained by performing periodic calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) for a slab of Zn(100) in the presence of adsorbed solvent molecules or additives are discussed in order to evaluate the CB energy for the various systems (section 4.2). Then, the standard electrochemical potentials for the redox couple (E°(I3−/I−)) measured for different electrolytes on a platinum electrode vs. a reference electrode and corrected using the junction potentials, are reported (section 4.3). Based on the results obtained for the dependence on the electrolyte composition of both the computed energy of the CBE and the experimentally measured electrochemical potentials, their separate and combined effects on the Voc are discussed and rationalized in section 5.
2. Computational details
All calculations were carried out using the ab initio CRYSTAL06 code,34 making use of localized (Gaussian) basis sets and solving self-consistently the Hartree–Fock (HF) and Kohn–Sham equations thus allowing the efficient use of hybrid functionals for band structure calculations.
The most stable crystallographic surface of the wurzite phase of ZnO (that is the (100)) was considered for the adsorption of the solvent and additive molecules since this surface is the predominant one for solution-grown ZnO nanostructures. Two-dimensional periodic slab models35 were taken into account in order to model adsorption, the unit cell being defined by two lattice parameters a and b along the [120] and [001] directions, respectively (Fig. S2 of the ESI†).36
Adsorption of solvents and additives was investigated by making use of a rectangular (2×2) supercell for MeCN and MP and a (3×2) supercell for NM and DMF. Sampling of the irreducible Brillouin zone was done with 9 k-points for the (1×1) cell, 4 k-points for the (2×2) supercells and 1 k-point (Γ-point) for the (3×2) supercells. A detailed investigation of the k-point sampling dependence of various computed properties of ZnO supercells can be found in ref. 37.
Organic adsorbates were described using all-electron basis sets with (7311/311/1), (8411/411/1), (621/21/1) and (511/1) contractions for N, O, C and H atoms, respectively, corresponding to a valence triple zeta (7-311G* and 8-411G* for N and O) and a valence double zeta (6-21G* and 5-11G* for C and H).37,43 Durand and Barthelat large-core pseudopotentials38–40 with (31/31) contractions were used for the O atoms of the ZnO substrate, while large-core Hay and Wadt pseudopotentials41 with (111/111/41) contraction were considered for the Zn atoms.
All calculations were performed at the DFT level applying the hybrid exchange correlation functional PBE0.42 The latter was obtained by casting the PBE correlation and exchange functional in a hybrid DFT/HF scheme, where the HF/DFT exchange ratio is fixed a priori at 1∶3.
This level of theory has already proven to provide reliable geometrical and electronic properties of molecules and periodic systems.37,43
During structural optimization both the adsorbed molecules and the outermost layer of ZnO were allowed to fully relax since it is known that, for such substrates, surface relaxation involves mainly only this layer.44 Surface cell parameters (i.e.a and b) were also left free to relax.
Finally, adsorption energies (Eads) were computed as the difference between the total energies for the combined adsorbate/surface system and the sum of the relaxed energies for a bare ZnO surface (Esurface) and an adsorbate molecule in the gas phase (Evacadsorbate) as: Eads = Eadsorbate/surface − (Evacadsorbate + Esurface)(4)Using this notation a negative value of Eads corresponds to a thermodynamically favored adsorption process. Adsorption energies were all corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE) using standard procedures.
3. Experimental details
ZnO nanoporous substrates were grown by an electrochemical method, according to a procedure described elsewhere.24 The deposition bath was an aqueous solution (MilliQ quality water) containing 0.1 M of KCl (Fluka 98%) as the supporting electrolyte, 5 mM ZnCl2 (Merck, 99%) and saturated with molecular oxygen.29 A xanthene dye, eosin Y (EY), was added at 50 μM to act as a structure-directing agent. A hybrid ZnO–EY film was grown on a glass sheet covered with a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) film by applying a potential of −1 V vs. SCE (saturated calomel electrode) with an Autolab PGSTAT20 potentiostat/galvanostat. The conducting glass substrate was fixed to a rotating disk electrode (with a constant speed of ω = 300 rotations min−1 (rpm)). A platinum wire was used as a counter electrode. The three-electrode electrochemical cell was mounted in a thermoregulated bath and the temperature was fixed at 70 °C with an uncertainty of ±0.2 °C. The electrolyte was saturated with pure oxygen by bubbling for 45 min prior to starting the deposition and a slight bubbling was maintained during the film growth. The growing process was stopped after 1750 s when the total passed/exchanged electrical charge reached 2.7 C cm−2. After its removal from the electrochemical bath, the sample was rinsed with MilliQ water. The layer then slowly became red-colored because of the oxidation of the reduced eosin in contact with air and light. After deposition, the ZnO–EY film was immersed in a KOH solution at a pH of 10.5 for 3 h in order to remove the eosin Y and release a pure ZnO mesoporous matrix of about 7.0 μm in thickness. The sample was subsequently dried at 150 °C for 1 h and then immersed for 2 h in a 0.5 mM solution of D149 dye (Chemicrea Inc, Japan) in a 1∶1 mixture of acetonitrile and isopropanol at room temperature.
The cells were built by assembling the photoanode (i.e. the zinc oxide sensitized using D149), a spacer (60 μm of surlyn) and a counter electrode (a platinized FTO–glass substrate). The illuminated area was fixed at 0.20 cm2. The electrolyte consisted of 0.5 M tetrabutylamonium iodide and 0.05 M iodine in various solvents. Where indicated, TBP was added at a concentration of 0.5 M.45,46 The photovoltaic performances of the devices were recorded immediately after cell assembly, using 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5 solar light illumination.
The standard potential of the I3−/I− redox couple was obtained by measuring the rest potential at 298 K of a freshly polished Pt electrode immersed in the organic electrolyte vs. a SCE. The measuring cell was: SCE(w) || I3−(c), I−(c), S | Pt(5)where c is the concentration of iodine and tri-iodine, S is the organic solvent and w means water.
The electrolytes investigated were mixtures of 2.10−3 M tetrabutylammonium iodide and 10−3 M I2 prepared in three different organic solvents (NM, MeCN and DMF). The effect of the additive was tested by adding 0.5 M TBP to the MeCN electrolyte. In the following, the measured cell potential is denoted Em.
4. Results
4.1 Cell performances
The I–V curves measured under 1 sun irradiance for a series of D149/ZnO cells prepared with various solvents are presented in Fig. 2a, while the corresponding short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF)47 and Voc parameters are presented in Table 1. Jsc was measured at zero applied potential and Voc at zero photocurrent. On the basis of the measured values, the overall conversion efficiency (η) was computed as: η = Jsc × Voc × FF/Pi.(6)where Pi is the incident power (here 100 mW cm−2, AM1.5).

Eqn (6) clearly shows that the cell conversion efficiency is directly related to Voc, as mentioned in the Introduction.
An increase in η is observed when going from NM to DMF and MeCN. The best performances for MeCN-based cells are consistent with data obtained for TiO2-based DSSCs.11,13 The measured Voc and Jsc values for our cells are also in good agreement with standard values published for D149/ZnO cells.23,48
In order to correlate the experimentally measured Voc with an intrinsic parameter of the solvent, Voc values are reported as a function of the solvent donor number in Fig. 2b. In the same figure, the values obtained for TiO2-based solar cells11–14 are also included for comparison purposes. The same overall trend is observed regardless of the oxide semiconductor considered, with Voc increasing as a function of DN. On the other hand, the TBP additive has a different effect on the I–V curves (Fig. 2b). This additive increases Voc while FF and Jsc stay constant (see Table 1).
Indeed, we confirm that cells with TBP additive have improved photoconversion efficiencies (Table 1). The increase in Voc upon addition of TBP is de facto not surprising if one considers the fact that TBP is a strong electron donor and thus it possesses a high donor number (Fig. 2b). TBP not only increases the photoconversion efficiency but substantially decreases the dark current (Fig. 2a) and blocks the back-electron-transfer reaction.14,49 Interestingly, DMF seems to show the same ability in decreasing the back-reaction as indicated by the relatively low dark current measured for this solvent (Fig. 2a).
Indeed, since the measured dark current is small in terms of absolute value, we will neglect its effect on Voc in the following and consider that this parameter is mainly related to the energy difference between the conduction band edge of the semiconductor and the redox standard potential of I3−/I− in the medium investigated, as in eqn (1).
4.2 Insights from DFT calculations: structural and electronic features
In order to assess the impact of adsorption of solvent and additive molecules onto the ZnO surface, the adsorption of NM, MeCN, DMF and MP (MP was considered as a model for the TBP additive) was studied. The main geometrical parameters for the optimized structures obtained are collected in Fig. 3 while more complete structural information can be found in Table S1 of the ESI†.

While the adsorption modes of MeCN, DMF and MP are fixed by the presence of a single donor atom, in the case of NM only a bidentate binding mode was taken into account in analogy with the findings reported in literature for molecules containing carboxylic groups.36,37,50,51 Overall, the ZnO cell parameters are not greatly affected by the presence of the adsorbate, the largest change for a being obtained upon MeCN adsorption [a decrease of 0.01 Å (0.3%) compared to a free surface] while a slightly larger variation is observed for the b parameter [0.03 Å (0.5%)] in the case of the adsorption of DMF (Table 2). These results somehow justify the choice of fixing the ZnO lattice parameters during the adsorption as previously reported in literature.36,37,50,51

In the same way, weak changes in the internal structural parameters are observed for the adsorbates with respect to the gas-phase optimized structures (Table S1 of the ESI†). Only a slight increase in the bond distances involving the atoms linked to the surface and of the C–H bonds involving H atoms close to the surface can be noted. This latter is a consequence of a hydrogen bond created between the H atoms and surface oxygens. Indeed the formation of such bonds is not surprising since ZnO surfaces are well known to be very basic (point of zero charge values between 8.7 and 10.352). Upon adsorption, a reduction in the O1–N–O2 angle in the case of NM is also observed (Table S1 of the ESI†)—contrary to carboxylate adsorption—in order to maximize the bidentate interaction.
In all cases, the X–Zn distances (X being the heteroatom of the anchoring group of the adsorbate) are always in the range observed for Zn–X (N or O) coordination, suggesting chemisorption on the surface.53
Remarkably, hydrogen bonds play an important role in defining the overall orientation of the molecules on the ZnO surface. In the case of NM and MeCN for instance, the solvent molecules are nearly parallel to the surface due to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the hydrogen atoms of their methyl groups and the oxygen atoms on the ZnO surface (pKa = 10.2 and 25 for NM and MeCN, respectively). This finding is in agreement with previous calculations for MeCN on TiO2.54 Also in this case the MeCN molecules are computed nearly parallel to the surface. Even for DMF and MP, which are found to be almost perpendicular to the surface, hydrogen bonds can still be defined, with O–H distances smaller than 2.5 Å.
In summary, the adsorption of solvent and additive molecules onto the surface is related both to the formation of donor–acceptor bonds between the acid (Lewis) Zn atoms and the heteroatom of the molecule, and to the hydrogen bonds between the hydrogen atoms of the molecule and the basic (Brönsted) oxygen atoms of the surface.
The computed adsorption energies, reported in Table 2, are sufficiently large to allow the assumption that all these molecules are chemisorbed on the surface, with the largest value (24 kJ mol−1) being computed for the best donor, that is MP. Furthermore, the adsorption energy obtained for MeCN is in agreement with the one reported by Schiffmann et al. for the same molecule on TiO2.54 Clearly, the adsorption energies computed for these solvent and additive molecules are significantly smaller than those reported for dyes possessing a negatively charged carboxylic anchoring group, for which the covalent X–Zn bond is stronger.36 From a more technical point of view, we can mention that the computed lateral interaction energies (EL55) are always smaller than 3.5 kJ mol−1, thus confirming that the size of the supercells is sufficiently large to avoid lateral interaction of adsorbates.
The computed densities of states are presented in Fig. 4 while the energies of the CBEs, centred on ZnO, are reported in Table 3. Overall, the near Fermi level region appears barely affected by the presence of the adsorbate: only in the case of NM, a localized orbital centred on the electron acceptor nitro group is found between the valence band and the conduction band. Otherwise, no contributions from the other adsorbates to the conduction band are noted. The computed CBE for each system increases with the donor number of the adsorbed molecule, as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5. Assuming that the redox standard potential (E°) is a constant, that is independent of the electrolyte used, from eqn (1) an increase of the CBE would directly improve the Voc.

The calculations confirmed that the additive (here TBP modeled as MP) is also able to increase the CBE energy as previously experimentally supposed,6,14 thus an improvement in the measured Voc is expected. This finding correlates with the high DN of TBP (Fig. 5).
However, full understanding of the change in the measured Voc with the electrolyte composition also requires reliable data on E° (I3−/I−) for the different systems. To this end, the standard redox potential of the I3−/I− redox couple was measured in the different electrolytes considered in this work.
4.3 Experimental determination of the standard redox potential in different electrolytes
The measured Nernst potentials of electrochemical cells (eqn (5)) fabricated with different electrolytes are reported in Table 3. In order to derive the standard potential of each system vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) reference, the values were corrected for the junction potential, denoted ΔEj, that appears between the saturated calomel electrode and the organic electrolytic solution: Em = EN − ΔEj(7)The ΔEj values used were taken from the literature57–59 and are summarized in Table 3. Supposing a very large equilibrium constant for the formation of I3−,60 the final concentrations of I3− and I− under our experimental conditions were estimated to be 10−3 M. Thus, eqn (2) can be simplified as follows: (8)Combining eqn (7) and (8), the standard potential E°(I3−/I−) is given by the relationship: (9)In the case of the NM and MeCN + TBP (0.5 M) electrolytes, ΔEj of MeCN was used due to the lack of literature data for both of them (Table 3).
In MeCN, the standard electrochemical potential was measured as 0.307 V (vs. NHE) and is in good agreement with the values previously reported in the literature (0.29 V61 and 0.354 V (vs. NHE)58). For DMF, this potential is 0.558 V (vs. NHE) and agrees with the result by Datta et al.,58 0.532 V (vs. NHE). The presence of TBP in MeCN does not significantly change the standard potential of the redox system compared to that of MeCN alone. The measured Em increased in the order MeCN, MeCN + TBP (0.5 M), NM and DMF. The standard redox potential increased by 0.25 V on going from MeCN to DMF, solvents for which ΔEj is known. Since this latter variation is of the same order of magnitude as the measured Voc, the present study clearly shows that the redox potential of the electrolyte cannot be considered constant as a function of the electrolyte composition and must then be taken into account.
The experimental findings also support the lack of a linear relationship between the computed CBE energies (Table 2) and the measured Voc (Table 1) that should hold in the case of a constant standard redox potential of the redox couple from eqn (1).
5. Discussion
By joint experimental and theoretical work, we have shown that the Voc of a D149/ZnO cell depends both on the variation of the CB energy and of the redox potential of the I3−/I− couple upon the electrolyte composition.
A mixed experimental and theoretical estimate of the open-circuit voltage (Voc(est)) can be given as the difference between the standard potential of the redox couple obtained from the measured Em and the computed CB potential level (Table 3). The values are presented in Table 3. Clearly, the absolute values of Voc(est) are largely overestimated, all lying in the 3 V range. Indeed, there are several reasons for such a result. First, the discussion was based on the standard redox potentials for the electrolytes without taking account of the species activity. Second, the ZnO electrode was modeled as an ideal (100) surface totally covered by the adsorbed solvent or additive molecules while the real surface is far from being a crystallographic plane and it is predominantly covered by dye molecules. This approximation is particularly severe for the MeCN + TBP electrolyte, for which the change of the experimental CBE should be less pronounced than the computed one since in this case the model chosen (MP/ZnO) does not reflect the concomitant presence of the solvent (MeCN, in higher concentration but with smaller adsorption energy) and of the additive (TBP, in lower concentration but preferentially adsorbed). Moreover, from a computational point of view the CBE was estimated by the energy of the conduction band at DFT level, which clearly introduces large errors in the absolute value.62
Nevertheless, although not quantitative, this approach can give a good qualitative estimate of the evolution of the Voc as a function of the electrolyte composition.
In particular, with respect to a ZnO cell made using MeCN as solvent, the relative voltages are −0.04 V using NM and +0.44 V using DMF or MP as electrolytes. Consequently, we predict an increase of Voc in DMF and MeCN + TBP and a decrease in NM compared to MeCN. This is in agreement with the experimental findings detailed in section 4.1. By changing the electrolyte from MeCN to NM, the present study shows that both the CBE energy and E° positions evolve in the same way (decrease), but the former more markedly than the latter. The same phenomenon is found when MeCN is replaced by MeCN + TBP as the electrolyte. For these three electrolytes indeed the redox potential can be considered as roughly constant. This is clearly not the case for a DMF electrolyte, the observed increase in Voc being due both to an increase in the CB energy and to a decrease of the redox potential.
Although DMF and TBP increase the Voc of the DSSCs, we have observed that the D149 dye is desorbed when the sensitized photoanode is in contact with a MeCN + TBP or DMF solution for several hours. The transmission curves and insets presented in Fig. 6 clearly illustrate this bleaching effect. In the case of MeCN, the photoanodes are stable (Fig. 6a). On the other hand, the measured transmittance spectra show an increase in the transmittance at 524 nm from 0.1% (t = 0) to 23.7% (t = 16 h) in presence of a MeCN + TBP electrolyte, due to dye desorption (Fig. 6b). In DMF, the dye desorption is even more rapid with the transmission of the sample increasing to 47.7% after 16 h in contact with the solvent. The desorption seems to be in part due to the dye used since this effect is not observed with N719 and this explains why the use of TBP is commonly reported for obtaining ZnO/ruthenium complex DSSCs with a rather high efficiency.33

The black continuous line is the initial transmission, the red one is after 1 h and the green line is after 16 h. Insets show the photoanodes at corresponding times. 
Therefore, two conditions must be fulfilled for the design of efficient new additives for DSSCs: a large DN combined with an adsorption energy small compared to that of the dye. This parameter is clearly dependent on the oxide used and could be efficiently evaluated by ab initio calculations.
6. Conclusions
We have validated a combined experimental and theoretical approach to fully understand the role of electrolyte composition in terms of solvent and additive on the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells. A similar approach would also be fruitful in the case of other oxides and molecules. Calculations based on density functional theory were performed in order to describe the geometry and adsorption energy of various adsorbed solvents (nitromethane, acetonitrile and dimethylformamide) and p-tert-butylpyridine (modeled by methylpyridine) on the ZnO(100) surface. The densities of states were calculated and the energy positions of the conduction band were evaluated for the different systems. On the other hand, the effect of the same molecules on the standard redox potential of the iodide/triiodide redox couple was experimentally determined. These two data values have permitted us to evaluate Voc changes in the systems in good agreement with the measured Voc using D149/ZnO cells with ZnO layers prepared by electrodeposition. As in the case of TiO2-based cells, a correlation of Voc with the donor number of the adsorbed species was found. The present paper illustrates that both the CBE energy and the redox potential variation are important to explain the experimentally observed changes in the Voc of DSSCs.
