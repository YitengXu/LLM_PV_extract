    AbstractWe investigate the lithium cation effects in high-performance dye-sensitized solar cells, which exhibit ∼10% efficiency and excellent thermal and light-soaking stability during 1000-h accelerated aging tests.

Broader context
Low-cost excitonic solar cells based upon exotic organic materials are receiving an ever-increasing amount of academic and industrial attention as potential alternatives to traditional inorganic photovoltaic devices. In this rapidly developing field, the dye-sensitized solar cell technology has achieved so far the highest validated efficiency of 11.1%. However the these ‘champion’ cells employ volatile and toxic solvents such as acetonitrile in their electrolytes, which may be prohibitive for outdoor solar panels in view of the need for robust encapsulation. In this work, we formulated a new low-volatility electrolyte and demonstrated a 10% cell exhibiting a good stability under long-term thermal and light-soaking dual stress. Gelation of this high-efficiency practical electrolyte with silica nanoparticles could be applied to fabricate a quasi-solid-state cell, which also displays excellent performance.

Both scientific and industrial endeavors are continuously devoted to the research and development of the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) technology in view of its great potential to meet the demand for sustainable energy in the future low-carbon economy.1 The distinguishable feature of this photoelectrochemical cell mainly lies in an interpenetrating nanoscale network of electron-transporting inorganic nanocrystals and hole-transporting soft matter. Following light absorption by dye molecules grafted on a wide-bandgap titania film, exciton dissociation at the energy-offset dye/titania interface generates electron–hole pairs possessing a sub-millisecond lifetime. The electron-hole lifetime is further prolonged to the millisecond domain by hole transfer to a redox electrolyte or a hole-transporter, allowing a high charge collection yield despite the low electron mobility in the nanocrystalline film.
Presently, a state-of-the-art DSC has already been validated with an impressive solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of 11.1%,2 albeit with a highly volatile acetonitrile-based electrolyte. To pursue a large-scale outdoor application of DSC, however, reducing electrolyte volatility is one of the critical issues concerning long-term device operation. To surmount this dilemma, over the past years innovative materials design and device engineering have powerfully impelled upward the efficiencies of cells with room-temperature ionic liquids and solid hole-transporting materials. In this context, an 8.5%-efficiency DSC exhibiting a fairly good thermal and light-soaking stability has been demonstrated by using a solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte.3 While the power conversion efficiency has reached a certified 5% under AM1.5G full sunlight irradiation for solid-state DSCs with the organic hole transporter spiro-OMeTAD,4 the realization of long-term stable cells still remains a challenge so far.
3-Methoxypropinitrile (MPN) serves as a preferable compromise with regard to solvent volatility and materials cost as well as the cell efficiency. In combination with MPN-based electrolytes, dye-sensitized solar cells featuring moderate efficiencies have been disclosed with excellent thermal and light-soaking stability.3,5,6 In this work, we employ the high-absorptivity sensitizer C106 (Fig. S1 of the ESI†) to construct stable DSCs exhibiting ∼10% efficiencies. Preliminary evaluation of C106 based on a traditional electrolyte formula3,5,6 without the lithium additive presents a limited cell efficiency with a relatively low photocurrent. Lithium iodide is purposefully introduced into the electrolyte, which results in an enhanced efficiency. Transient absorption and electrical impedance techniques are employed to scrutinize the physical origin of the variations in photovoltaic performance.

Fig. 1 presents the photocurrent action spectra of cells in conjunction with two MPN-based electrolytes E1 and E2. E1: 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 150 mM iodine (I2), 1.0 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) in MPN; E2: 1.0 M DMII, 150 mM I2, 1.0 M TBP, 0.1 M GNCS and 50 mM LiI in MPN. The only difference of these two electrolytes lies in the lithium additive. Notice that almost no change of the electronic absorption (Fig. S2†) was perceived for the C106-coated film immersed in electrolyte E1 compared to that in E2. Thereby, measurements on the incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) can effectively evaluate charge generation and charge collection efficiencies in a testing cell. As shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI,† while normalization of the IPCE subtracts any possible difference in the net charge separation efficiencies, the indistinguishable spectra indicate that the lithium cations in E2 do not noticeably influence the charge collection. Thereby, the notably higher IPCE maximum of cell with E2 (∼87%) than that with E1 (∼74%) could be attributed to the lithium-induced difference in net charge separation at the energy-offset dye/titania interface.

We resorted to the laser flash photolysis technique to examine the interfacial kinetic competition between dye regeneration and charge recombination of dye cations with electrons in the titania film,7,8 which is considered to make a remarkable contribution to the IPCE.9,10 On the basis of transient absorption measurements (Fig. S4†), we selected a monochromatic light at 780 nm to probe the multichannel charge-transfer kinetics of dye cations. Excitation fluence was carefully controlled in our kinetic measurements to ensure that ∼3.70 × 1014 photons cm−2 were irradiated onto the dye-coated titania film during every laser pulse. The absorption signal decays could be well fitted to a stretched exponential decay function (ΔOD ∝ exp[−(t/τ)α]) to afford a half-reaction time t1/2. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the presence of inert electrolytes a and b with TFSI (bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) anions, the absorption signal decays could be ascribed to the recombination of the dye cations with electrons in the titania film. The t1/2 with electrolyte a is 267 μs, which decreases to 216 μs upon the employment of electrolyte b with lithium cations. Active iodide anions in electrolytes c and d evidently speed up the absorption decays owing to the interception of dye cations by the electron-donating iodide anions (dye regeneration), giving the corresponding t1/2 of 2.9 and 1.7 μs. Despite the fact that both interfacial charge recombination and dye regeneration are kinetically accelerated by lithium cations, their branching ratios are both over 92, indicating that almost 100% of the dye cations are intercepted with iodide. It thus can be soundly stated that the discrepancy in IPCE maxima is not attributable to the kinetic differences of dye regeneration and dye recombination with titania electrons.

Smooth lines are fittings with a stretched exponential decay function. (B) Microsecond absorption traces of C106-coated titania films in contact with electrolytes a and b. Absorbance changes were measured at a probe wavelength of 780 nm upon 594 nm laser excitation (7 ns full width half-maximum pulse duration, 2 Hz repetition rate, 125 μJ cm−2 pulse fluence). Smooth lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 1600 laser shots. The red and blue dots in panel B represent the initial amplitudes obtained from fittings. 
We further investigated the initial amplitudes11,12 of dye cation absorption signals in inert electrolytes a and b, which are suitable for a comparative study of the electron injection yields. As shown in Fig. 2B, the initial amplitude of oxidized dye cation absorption with electrolyte b is apparently higher than that with electrolyte a, indicating that lithium cations in electrolyte b tend to improve the electron injection from excited-state dye molecules to the conduction band of titania, thus echoing well the observed IPCE height difference. We speculate that the difference in electron injection is probably related to the energy-offset variation at the dye/titania interface. Note that the invariable onset-wavelengths of IPCEs (Fig. 1) also indicate that the lithium cations exert no noticeable impact on the light absorption of C106 grafted on titania. Therefore, the titania conduction band edge (Ec) plays a major role in tuning the interfacial energy alignment.13,14 Furthermore, the Ec can be numerically determined by the electron transport resistance (Rt) of the titania film, which is derived through modeling the experimental electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data with an appropriate equivalent circuit based on the transmission line model.15,16Rt is expressed as17 (1)wherein R0 is the transport resistance on the transport level, which is considered to be constant provided that the film geometry stays the same. EF,n is the titania quasi-Fermi level and EF,redox is the electrolyte Fermi level. kB is Boltzmann's constant and T the absolute temperature. Noting that (EF,redox − EF,n) = −eV, logarithmic treatment of eqn (1) gives (2)wherein V represents the applied potential bias and e the elementary charge. Calculation with the intercepts of the linear fittings in Fig. 3 shows that the Ec of titania in contact with E2 is downwards moved by 25 meV compared to that with E1. Evidently, the energy alignment at the dye/titania interface in contact with electrolyte containing lithium cations is thermodynamically more advantageous for electron injection, thus explaining the difference in the IPCE peaks.

J–V characteristics of cells with electrolytes E1 and E2 measured under an irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G sunlight are presented in Fig. 4, and photovoltaic parameters at different light intensities are collected in Table S1 of the ESI.† The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and overall power conversion efficiency (η) of cell with E1 are 14.97 mA cm−2, 782 mV, 0.75 and 8.8%, respectively. In contrast, the device with E2 exhibits an incremented Jsc of 17.57 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with the photocurrent action spectra shown in Fig. 1. The Voc slightly decreases by 29 mV compared to that with E1, yielding an enhanced overall power conversion efficiency of 10.0%. Considering the fluidity of E2 which may cause inconvenience in the practical fabrication of flexible, compact and laminated DSC devices, silica nanoparticles were employed to construct a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte18 (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), which can be turned into liquid after 5 min sonication and remain liquid within 1 h for electrolyte injection. We note that the quasi-solid-state counterpart of E2 does not result in a noticeable variation in Jsc, while there is a small Voc diminishment of 12 mV compared to that with E2 and an almost invariable fill factor, contributing to an efficiency of 9.8%, as shown in Fig. S5.f†

Considering the recombination rate Un:19 Un = k0ncγ(3)wherein γ is the recombination reaction order, k0 represents the recombination rate constant with a unit of cm−3(1−γ) s−1 and nc refers to the electron density in the conduction band which is determined by (4)wherein Nc is the volume density of accessible states in the conduction band. Noting that (EF.n − EF,redox) = eVoc, by integrating eqn (4) with eqn (3), we have (5)
Under open-circuit conditions, the electron injection rate compensates the charge recombination rate (Un), which is linearly proportional to the short-circuit current density (Jsc). Therefore, eqn (5) exactly indicates the dependence of Voc on the electron injection rate, charge recombination (k0, γ) and conduction band edge (Ec). As shown in Fig. 5, the Jsc increase of cell with E2 in comparison with E1 tends to introduce a Voc enhancement of 4.9 mV. Moreover, at a given Jsc of 14.97 mA cm−2 (E1), the Voc of cell with E2 decreases by 32.8 mV, which is a collective contribution of the charge recombination rate variation and conduction band edge movement effect on the photovoltage. Taking into account the above-determined downward Ec shift of 25 meV by employing E2 compared to E1, the charge recombination thereby imposes a negative effect on the Voc by 7.8 mV. We suspect that lithium cations probably do not exhibit comparable capability to retard interfacial charge recombination in comparison to TBP and/or GNCS, thus leading to faster recombination kinetics.

The blue and red dashed lines represent the Jsc values of cells with E1 (14.97 mA cm−2) and E2 (17.57 mA cm−2), respectively. 
We submitted our high-efficiency cells covered with a UV absorbing polymer film to the 1000 h accelerated aging test at 60 °C, under a solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Note that the total contribution of UV photons to the standard AM1.5G solar emission is relatively small. UV light leads to direct band-edge excitation of titania nanocrystals, generating valence-band holes, which in turn may attack some organic materials in the device. This reaction can be partially suppressed by the hole capture with iodide. In our light-soaking experiments, UV light is removed with an antireflection coating. As presented in Fig. S6A,† the cell with E1 has a relatively poor stability mainly due to the decrease of photocurrent. However, the device employing electrolyte E2 exhibits a fairly good stability (Fig. S6B†) after 1000 h accelerated aging, keeping 92% of its initial efficiency. We also carried out stability tests of cells with the gel counterpart of E2 under thermal and light-soaking dual stress. As shown in Fig. 6, the quasi-solid-state cell presents an even better stability compared to that with the corresponding liquid electrolyte, retaining 95% of the initial efficiency after 1000 h accelerated aging.

In conclusion, by means of electrical impedance and transient absorption measurements, we scrutinize the origins of impacts of the additive lithium iodide in a low-volatility 3-methoxypropinitrile electrolyte upon the photovoltaic characteristics of dye-sensitized solar cells with a high-absorptivity ruthenium dye C106. Lithium cations significantly elevate the IPCE plateau by prompting a downward shift of the titania conduction band edge, which in turn brings on a more thermodynamically advantageous energy offset at the titania/dye interface for charge separation. This band edge movement is also found to play a prominent role in the adverse Voc shrinkage. The 3-methoxypropinitrile electrolyte with lithium cations and its quasi-solid-state counterpart have both been used to fabricate stable dye-sensitized solar cells exhibiting ∼10% power conversion efficiencies at the 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G conditions. This work should foster future DSC applications.
