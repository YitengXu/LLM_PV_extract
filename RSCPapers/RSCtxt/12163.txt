    , Accepted 10th March 2018First published on 12th March 2018AbstractFe2TiO5 is recognized as a novel photoanode material for solar water splitting. However, it has been seldom studied as a photoelectrode by itself, and its practical performance still needs to be improved. Herein, nanostructured Fe2TiO5 photoanode is prepared by the electrospray technique. The effects of the synthesis parameters on the photoelectrochemical water splitting activity are studied including the substrate temperature and film thickness. In addition, surface F-modification is applied on pure Fe2TiO5 to further improve its photoelectrochemical performance. Also, the water splitting photocurrent of F-treated Fe2TiO5 increases to 0.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is higher than that of pristine Fe2TiO5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the formation of surface Ti–F bonds after surface F-treatment, which facilitates the transfer of holes and the breakage of O–H bond under illumination. The enhanced performance can be attributed to a synergetic effect of nanoarchitecture and surface F-modification. Therefore, the nanoarchitecture assisted by surface F-modification offers an effective strategy to prepare high-efficiency nanostructured complex metal oxides for solar water splitting.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has attracted intensive attention due to its ability to produce clean energy and hydrogen. TiO2 was first applied as a photoanode in PEC device in 1972;1 TiO2 is component abundant, non-toxic and stable in strongly acidic and basic environment, but it is not effective for sunlight harvesting due to its wide band gap.2–4 In contrast, α-Fe2O3 and BiVO4 exhibit a relatively narrow band gap, resulting in a broader absorption than that by TiO2;5–8 however, both of them exhibit poor water oxidation kinetics and fast recombination due to the short diffusion distance. Therefore, it is necessary to search for novel photoanode materials that are efficient, stable and abundant.
Pseudobrookite iron titanate, Fe2TiO5, as a novel photoanode has been gradually studied owing to its stability and abundance as well as narrow bandgap and proper band potentials.9–11 In particular, it possesses almost the same conduction band energy level as TiO2, which results in a quick onset of photocurrent under visible light irradiation.9 However, a novel photoanode material usually presents relatively poor activity in solar water splitting. Therefore, many efforts have been made to enhance the photocurrent by precise morphology control and surface treatments. Given a specific semiconductor material, the nanostructured photoanodes can exhibit effective carrier collection and better light harvesting.12 The electrospray technique has been widely used in preparing nanostructured materials.13–16 In our previous study, we have also successfully prepared NaCl nanocrystals, Au and Ag nanoparticles, and nanostructured ZnFe2O4 thin films using this technique.15,17–19 Moreover, surface modifications are important not only to activate the semiconductor for water splitting but also to facilitate charge separation.20,21 Chen and co-workers have found that the water in titanium dioxide photocatalysis can be activated by the formation of surface hydrogen bonds after surface F-treatment.22 Moreover, Zhong and co-workers obtained enhanced catalytic performance of nanostructured Fe2TiO5/Fe2O3 photoanode through F- and Rh-based surface treatment. However, the F-treatment mainly lowers the onset potential, and decreases the water splitting photocurrent.20
In this paper, surface F-modification is applied on nanostructured Fe2TiO5 photoanode, which is prepared by the electrospray technique, to enhance the PEC activity of the Fe2TiO5 photoanode. The surface F-modification can activate the water adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles to facilitate the cleavage of O–H bonds by forming an H-bond network when immersed in NaOH working solution. Due to the surface F-modification, the nanostructured Fe2TiO5 photoanode exhibits not only a lower onset potential, but also an enhanced catalytic performance when compared with Fe2TiO5/Fe2O3 photoanode. As a result, the photocurrent of the nanostructured Fe2TiO5 photoanode increases by 100% after the surface F-treatment. Also, the incident photocurrent conversion efficiency (IPCE) increases from 8% to 21%, indicating the enhanced charge separation efficiency and photoactivity. Moreover, the enhanced performance is owing to the fast charge transfer and high charge separation efficiency confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results. Therefore, the nanoarchitecture assisted by surface F-modification offers an effective strategy to prepare high-efficiency nanostructured complex metal oxides for solar water splitting.
Experimental section
Synthesis of Fe2TiO5 films
The spray solution was prepared by dissolving 0.3 M iron acetylacetonate and 0.15 M tetrabutyl titanate in ethanol, and the solution was sonicated to make it homogeneous. The Fe2TiO5 thin films were deposited using a homemade equipment including an injection pump (Kent Scientific Corporation, USA), high voltage source (Boher High Voltage Power Supplies Co., Ltd, China), and a heater. The schematic diagram of the experimental equipment is shown in Fig. S1.†
The precursor solution was pumped by a spray nozzle under high voltage to produce charged microdroplets. A pre-cleaned FTO substrate was placed against the nozzle to accept the charged microdroplets. The substrate was connected to a heater, and the temperature of the heater was adjusted by a temperature controller. The distance between the tip of the needle and the substrate was fixed at 8.5 cm. The flow rate was maintained at 15 μL min−1. After deposition, the films were annealed at 550 °C for 2 h to obtain crystalline Fe2TiO5.
F-Treatment of Fe2TiO5 films
The as-prepared Fe2TiO5 films were immersed in 0.2 M NH4F solution containing 5 mL H2O2 and 5 mL H2O at 60 °C in an oven for 10 min. Then, the samples were annealed at 200 °C in air for 20 min.
Characterization
The morphological, structural and optical properties of the Fe2TiO5 thin films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Helios Nanolab 600i from FEI Company), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin F20), X-ray photoelectron studies (XPS), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Cu Kα, 50 kV and 200 mA). Photoelectrochemical measurements were obtained with the CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (CH instruments Inc., shanghai) using a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The Fe2TiO5 photoanodes were used as the working electrodes, Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode, and platinum mesh was used as the counter electrode. The surface area exposed to the electrolyte was fixed at 0.502 cm2, and 1 M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (pH = 13.6) was utilized as the electrolyte. The measured potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the relationship ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + E0Ag/AgCl, where EAg/AgCl is the measured potential against the reference electrode and E0Ag/AgCl = 0.1976 V at 25 °C. The scan rate was 10 mV s−1 for the current–potential (J–E) curves, and the scans were performed from negative to positive potentials. The light source was simulated sunlight with an intensity of 100 m W cm−2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to compare the electrical conductivities of Fe2TiO5 films at 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–1 MHz. IPCE spectra were measured using a simulated sunlight and cut filters ranging from 350 nm to 550 nm.
Results and discussion
The Fe2TiO5 thin films prepared at different substrate temperatures were characterized by XRD as shown in Fig. 1. The results demonstrated that the as-prepared samples were pure Fe2TiO5 with no other phase, and the XRD patterns were consistent with PDF card #JCPDS 76-1158. To obtain chemical and structural information, further experiments were performed on a representative Fe2TiO5 film prepared at different substrate temperatures. Fig. 1(b)–(d) depict the HRTEM images of Fe2TiO5 film prepared at different substrate temperatures. The lattice fringes in the HRTEM images indicated the crystalline nature of the films. The lattice spacing of 0.27 nm determined from the HRTEM image corresponded to the (023) crystallographic plane of Fe2TiO5 as shown in Fig. 1(b), and the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm determined from the HRTEM image corresponded to the (110) crystallographic plane of Fe2TiO5 as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d).

To further confirm the composition of the Fe2TiO5 thin film, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted as shown in Fig. S2.† The survey scan spectrum indicated the existence of Fe, Ti, and O elements in the as-prepared Fe2TiO5 thin film. In Fig. S1(b),† the two peaks centered at 724.4 eV and 710.9 eV are observed, which were assigned to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p2/3, respectively. This result confirmed that Fe in Fe2TiO5 existed in the +3 oxidation state. For the Ti 2p spectrum, the two peaks with binding energies of around 463.8 eV and 458.2 eV were assigned to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2, respectively, indicating a normal state of Ti4+ in the product. In addition, the peaks at binding energies of 529.7 eV and 531.4, eV as shown in Fig. S2(d),† were ascribed to the typical surface lattice oxygen Fe–O–Ti and surface absorbed oxygen species, respectively.9
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also conducted to investigate the morphology of the thin films prepared at different substrate temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2, there was an obvious variation in morphology. The film with the highly porous structure could be obtained with an increase in temperature. This was because the higher temperature of the plate heater helped the desolvation process of electrospray, resulting in smaller droplets and smaller nanocrystals depositing on the substrate. However, a further increment in the substrate temperature led to the aggregation of nanoparticles. The growth mechanism of the film may be layer-by-layer, because of the higher substrate temperature, and the molecules move rapidly to aggregate together to form a solid film.16 As a result, it can be concluded that the substrate temperature has a great impact on the morphology of the films.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of Fe2TiO5 thin films prepared at different substrate temperatures of (a) 300 °C, (b) 350 °C, and (c) 400 °C and I–V curves of Fe2TiO5 thin films prepared at different substrate temperatures (d). 
The effect of substrate temperature on PEC performance of the films was also investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 2(d). The photocurrent of the film prepared at 300 °C was only 19.6 μA cm−2 at 1.23 (V vs. RHE), and when deposited at 350 °C, it increased to 156.7 μA cm−2, which was improved by about 8 times. The enhanced photocurrent can be attributed to the nanostructure of the film, which possesses a larger surface area and exposes more active sites. Moreover, nanostructured photoanode has better light harvesting properties due to light trapping within nanostructures.12 When the substrate temperature further increased, the photocurrent exhibited a small decrease because of the poor nanostructure and larger nanoparticles. The difference of the photoactivity may also result from the different surface states and crystallinity formed through the preparation process.23
The film thickness plays an important role on the performance of photoanode. The photoanodes with different thicknesses were prepared by adjusting the amount of the precursor solution (Fig. 3(a)). The photoanodes with different thicknesses are defined as sample A, B, C and D. Sample A is the thinnest sample, and sample D is the thickest one. It was obvious that there was a “volcano” relationship between the photocurrent and film thickness, and sample B showed the best photocatalyst activity. Usually, the photocatalyst activity corresponds to the charge transport and separation efficiency, which are related to the space charge layer.24,25 The photocurrent increases with an increase in the thickness of the film, and the photocurrent increases until the thickness of the film is equal to the space charge thickness. When the film thickness further increases, the photocurrent decreases, showing a relatively poor photocatalyst activity. This is because a thicker film results in a longer diffusion distance, which supports the recombination of the photogenerated carriers and results in larger resistance in bulk. As a result, the photoanode with a thickness equal to the width of the space charge layer exhibited the best photocatalyst activity.

To understand the transport properties and separation efficiencies of the charge carriers, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. EIS can interpret the charge carrier migration activities and interfacial charge transfer resistance.25 The EIS Nyquist plots and the simulated results of the samples with different film thicknesses are presented in Fig. 3(b). The inset image in Fig. 3(b) is the equivalent electric circuit model. Parameters R series, RSC, RCT, CSC and CH were obtained by fitting the electrical circuit analogue to the experimental EIS data as shown in Table S1.†R series represents the series resistance including the substrate resistance, the electrolyte resistance and the external contact resistance, which affects the charge transport and separation to a small extent. However, the transport properties of charge carriers can be estimated by the element RSC. From the simulated results, it was found that the photoanode with the highest photocurrent possessed the smallest RSC, which indicated that the better performance is owing to the fast charge transfer. Moreover, the result for element RCT, which represents the charge transfer resistance in the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, also explained the better photoactive performance of the films. Furthermore, the smaller RCT contributed to the cathodic shift of the onset potential. Similarly, the data for CSC and CH indicated that the better photocatalyst performance was due to the high charge separation efficiency.
Moreover, to further enhance the PEC activity of Fe2TiO5 photoanode, the material was subjected to a surface F-modification. Surface modification can activate the water adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles to facilitate the cleavage of O–H bonds by forming H-bond network when immersed in NaOH working solution.20,22 Therefore, the F-treated Fe2TiO5 thin films were synthesized to examine the effect of H-bond network on their PEC performance. F was introduced into the surface of the films by immersing the films in the solution of NH4F followed by sintering. Thus, the F-treated Fe2TiO5 film termed as F-Fe2TiO5 was obtained. To confirm the existence of F in the F-Fe2TiO5 thin films, XPS measurement was conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. From the high-resolution F 1s XPS spectra, a strong F signal was observed in F-Fe2TiO5, and no F signal was observed before F-treatment. Moreover, the two peaks centered at around 684.8 eV and 687.1 eV were attributed to the F adsorbed onto the terminal Ti and at a bridge position between Ti and Fe, respectively. The diagram of the surface structures before and after F-treatment is shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, Fig. S3† shows the TEM image and elemental mappings of F-Fe2TiO5, which further confirmed the existence of F in the surface of F-Fe2TiO5. The element mapping image indicated that the distribution of F atom was uniform. An obvious energy shift at Ti 2p edge shown in Fig. 4(c) was also observed after F-treatment, suggesting the effect of Ti–F–Ti bonds. Fig. 4(d) also shows the O 1s XPS spectra; the difference in the results before and after F-treatment was attributed to the existence of F.

The photocurrents of Fe2TiO5 and F-Fe2TiO5 thin films were compared to investigate the effect of F-treatment on the catalytic activity. We found that the photocurrent showed an obvious enhancement after F-treatment (Fig. 6(a)). Fig. 6(b) indicates that the photocurrent of F-Fe2TiO5 improved to 0.4 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. RHE), which was more than two-fold higher than 0.18 mA cm−2 of the pristine Fe2TiO5. The photocurrent improved from 0.5 to 0.9 mA cm−2 (at 1.7 V vs. RHE) after F-treatment (Fig. S4†).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under light illumination was conducted to confirm the working mechanism of Fe2TiO5 photoanodes before and after F-treatment. There are two arcs in the EIS data which are shown in Fig. 6(c), and the equivalent circuit to simulate the Nyquist plot is the same as that given in the inset of Fig. 3(b). The right arc at lower frequencies (under illumination) could be attributed to the charge transfer of surface states, and the left arc at higher frequencies could be attributed to the charge transfer in the bulk. The equivalent diameters of the left arcs indicated that the F-treatment only influenced the surface state of Fe2TiO5 photoanode. Moreover, the smaller diameter of the right arc of F-Fe2TiO5 photoanode when compared with that of Fe2TiO5 photoanode exhibited faster transfer kinetics at the electrode interface. Parameters R series, RSC, RCT, CSC and CH are shown in Table S2.† The much smaller value of RSC of F-Fe2TiO5 photoanode when compared with that of Fe2TiO5 photoanode suggested that the F-treatment has a strong effect in promoting hole transfer.
The incident photon-to-current efficiencies of Fe2TiO5 and F-Fe2TiO5 film were also measured to confirm the effect of F-treatment on the photoactivity, and the samples were scanned from 350 to 550 nm at a potential of 1.23 V, and the IPCE was calculated according to the following equation: IPCE (λ) = (j × 1240)/(Plight(λ) × λ)(1)
Here, j is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Plight is the calibrated and monochromated illumination power (mW cm−2) and λ is the wavelength (nm) of the incident light at which the photocurrent and illumination power are measured. The results are shown in Fig. 6(d). Clearly, the IPCE of the F-Fe2TiO5 photoanode was much higher than that of the Fe2TiO5 photoanode, confirming enhanced photoactivity. Also, a maximum IPCE of 21% was observed for F-Fe2TiO5 photoanode at 380 nm, and a maximum IPCE of 8% was obtained for Fe2TiO5 photoanode at 350 nm.
Conclusions
In summary, surface F-modification is applied on nanostructured Fe2TiO5 photoanode, which is prepared by the electrospray technique. The nanostructured photoanode can be obtained when the substrate temperature is maintained at 350 °C. The PEC performance can be improved by changing the nanostructured morphology. Also, there is a “volcano” relationship between the photocurrent and film thickness. The optimized photoanode has not only a higher water splitting photocurrent, but also a lower onset potential. EIS data indicates that the better photocatalyst activity is owing to the fast charge transport and efficient charge separation. Moreover, the photocatalyst activity can be further improved through surface F-modification. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the formation of surface Ti–F bonds after surface F-treatment, which facilitates the transfer of holes and the breakage of O–H bond under illumination. As a result, the photocurrent increases from 0.2 to 0.4 mA cm−2. Also, a maximum IPCE of 21% is observed for F-Fe2TiO5 photoanode at 380 nm. It can be concluded that the high-efficiency photoanode is attributed to the synergistic effect of nanoarchitecture and surface F-modification, and this provides an effective strategy to prepare efficient photoanodes.
