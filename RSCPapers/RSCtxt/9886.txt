    , Accepted 17th December 2020First published on 17th December 2020AbstractDefect passivation has developed as an attractive approach to promote the performance of perovskite solar cells. However, robust control of the interplay between the defects and adsorbates is challenging and critical for applications. Here, hydrophobic 3-(trifluoromethyl) phenethylamine hydroiodide (CF3PEAI) is introduced on the surface of perovskite films. By controlling the post-treatment of the passivation layers, the amphipathic passivation agent CF3PEAI can form 2D perovskite and go deeply into the films (>30 nm), which can further passivate the internal defects and improve the long-term stability of perovskite films. Furthermore, the CF3PEAI 2D passivated perovskite films exhibit better energy level alignment, lower surface roughness, longer carrier lifetimes, lower trap state density, and higher stability than the control and the ones without annealing. Our first-principles simulation reveals that CF3PEAI effectively renormalizes the defective states of the vacancies with benign characteristics. The defect–adsorbate complex facilitates the manipulation of versatile electronic states for a prolonged lifetime of photoexcited carriers with improved structural integrity. Perovskite solar cells' performance is enhanced from 18.87% to 21.05% along with improved stability, which can retain 98% of initial performance after 528 h in ambient air with a humidity of 70–80%.
Introduction
As the most promising photoelectric materials, organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention in the photovoltaic field due to their superior ambipolar carrier transportability,1 long charge carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes,2 tuneable bandgaps,3 impressive visible light absorption coefficients,4 and low-temperature solution processability.5 In a short span of a decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased rapidly from 3.8%6 to 25.2%,7 which is close to the efficiency of monocrystalline silicon solar cells.8 Moreover, stability that restricts their industrial development has been dramatically improved.9–11
However, solution-processed films inevitably have some defects in the crystal structure, including (1) intrinsic point defects, (2) impurities defects, and (3) two-dimensional surface defects or grain boundary defects.12 These defects would increase carrier nonradiative recombination,13 and reduce the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells,14 thus affecting the PCE of PSCs. Furthermore, the interaction between defects and mobile ions significantly induces hysteresis15 and decomposition of devices.16 As polycrystalline materials, these defects in perovskite films are inevitable.17 Hence, defect passivation has become a crucial optimization strategy for stable and efficient PSCs.8,9,18–20 To passivate defects and optimize interfacial parameters, researchers have designed various passivation technologies based on different mechanisms, including excess lead iodide (PbI2),21 Lewis acid/base,22 two-dimensional (2D) perovskite with different functional groups23–25 and so on.26 Among them, 2D perovskite passivation has attracted substantial research interest due to its superior passivation effect, outstanding hydrophobicity, and tuneable photoelectrical properties, which can reduce the trap density and enhance the stability of perovskite films.27 According to recent reports, aromatic organic ammonia molecules exhibit an excellent passivation effect.28–30 Although these surface passivation technologies have significantly improved PSCs, the passivation mechanism employing different functional groups and reaction depths is still unclear, which needs to be systematically studied.31
Here, we employed amphipathic 3-(trifluoromethyl) phenethylamine hydroiodide (CF3PEAI) as the hydrophobic passivation molecule to study the passivation mechanism and the interplay between the defect and adsorbate for robust manipulation. We reveal that annealing can help the CF3PEAI in-depth reaction with perovskite films, and the formed 2D passivation layer would facilitate energy level alignment with the carrier transport layer. Besides the interaction of iodine and benzene rings,25 CF3PEAI can effectively passivate uncoordinated Pb2+via Lewis acid–base interactions by the halogen functional group (trifluoromethyl), which suppresses the formation of Pb0 defects. Both first-principles and experimental results verify that the amphipathic CF3PEAI molecules still keep desirable passivation ability due to the para-trifluoromethyl group while forming 2D perovskite. As expected, the passivated films exhibit lower surface roughness, longer carrier lifetimes, lower trap state density, and higher stability than the control. As a result, the champion device shows a 21.05% PCE with negligible hysteresis. What is more, the devices retain 98% of the initial PCE after 528 h in ambient air with a humidity of 70–80%.
Results and discussion
Fig. S1† shows the structure of devices and the proposed passivation mechanism in this study. Mixed (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3−yCly)x perovskite films (FA: formamidine; MA: methylammonium) are prepared by a two-step spin-coating method, with the mixed organic salts FAI, MABr, and MACl reacting into the predeposited PbI2 bottom layer (control). The ammonium salt (CF3PEAI and PEAI) solution is spin-coated on the perovskite surface without any additional treatment to passivate the perovskite surface defects (CF3PEAI passivated). In comparison, the 2D passivated films are fabricated after annealing at 100 °C (CF3PEAI 2D passivated and PEAI 2D passivated).
The thickness of perovskite films with or without passivation layers characterized by the atomic-profiler is around 800 nm, indicating that the passivation layer on the surface is relatively thin. With the negligible thickness of the passivation layer covered on the surface, the light absorption of all films remains almost the same (Fig. 1a), which ensures sufficient light absorption for high-efficiency PSCs. To confirm the state of the passivation layers on the surface, we carried out X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements for all samples. Compared with the pristine sample, there are distinct extra diffraction peaks in the annealed samples. The positions of these new peaks are consistent with the reported 2D perovskite (Fig. 1b), which indicates that the annealing process can help the formation of the 2D perovskite on the surface.32 From Fig. 1c, the photoluminescence (PL) peak of CF3PEAI 2D passivated films (∼781 nm) shows an apparent blue shift compared to that of the pristine sample (∼794 nm). Meanwhile, the PL intensity is about three times larger than that of the pristine sample. Due to the same thicknesses of all perovskite films, the enhanced PL intensity is attributed to the suppressed surface nonradiative recombination.25 Notably, CF3PEAI is a desirable passivation molecule on the perovskite films.33 Furthermore, CF3PEAI 2D passivation layer formation can further enhance the passivation effect with annealing treatment.

To further evaluate the passivation effect, we carried out the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) test. In this study, the TCSPC spectrum consists of fast- (τ1) and slow-decay (τ2) parts.34,35 The fast-decay component τ1 is attributed to trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, while the slow decay τ2 is assigned to the radiative recombination of free carriers.34,36 As listed in Table S1,†τ1 of both CF3PEAI 2D passivated films and control perovskite films is ∼100 ns. However, the proportion (A1) of passivated films is significantly less than that of the pristine ones, indicating that the nonradiative recombination has been significantly suppressed after the passivation treatment. Besides, the radiative carrier recombination lifetime τ2 is significantly increased from ∼0.5 μs to ∼1.6 μs after CF3PEAI 2D treatment (Fig. 1d). Noteworthily, the carrier lifetime of the CF3PEAI 2D passivated film is much longer than that of the CF3PEAI directly passivated film, which is consistent with the PL results.
As described by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the passivation molecules have a tremendous impact on the films' surface morphologies. In Fig. 2a, the bright part of the image represents the residual PbI2 on the control perovskite surface,37 one of the main reasons for accelerated device degradation.38 After the CF3PEAI treatment (Fig. 2c and e), there is less residual PbI2 on the films' surface with homogeneous and uniform morphologies.39 Note that the grain boundaries on the CF3PEAI 2D passivated surface are vaguer than those of the pristine and directly passivated ones, indicating that the annealing process could also help modify the grain boundaries of perovskite. A similar result could be obtained from AFM images, as shown in Fig. 2b, d and f. The surface roughness of the pristine films (Ra = 41 nm) is much higher than that of the treated ones (CF3PEAI, Ra = 27.5 nm; CF3PEAI 2D, Ra = 23.8 nm).

Moreover, we evaluated the trap density of the perovskite films by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method.35,36 SCLC measurements were carried out in the dark with an electron-only device structure glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM)/Ag (Fig. S2a–c†) and glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (Fig. S2d–f†) for hole-only devices. The electron trap density of perovskite/CF3PEAI 2D is estimated to be 2.25 × 1015 cm−3, which is only half of that of the control sample (4.5 × 1015 cm−3). Meanwhile, the hole trap density is also reduced from 3.75 × 1015 cm−3 to 2.68 × 1015 cm−3, indicating the improved perovskite crystal quality after passivation.
To further confirm the passivation effects, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted. The C 1s core-level spectra shown in Fig. 3a show a prominent feature peak of CO at 288.7 eV for the pristine film, which is attributed to the surface's degradation invaded by the adsorbed oxygen/moisture.40,41 In contrast, the passivated films present negligible peaks at this position, which indicates that CF3PEAI can significantly block the films from the chemical reaction with the active components in air and thus enhance the stability of the films. In the high-resolution N 1s spectra (Fig. 3b), the feature peaks associated with the FA+ cation (∼400.7 eV) can be observed in all the films. After passivation, a new feature peak at 402.1 eV emerged distinctly, which is assigned to phenethylamine (PEA).32 Due to the different chemical environments, there is a little shift from 402.1 eV (PEAI passivated sample) to 401.8 eV (CF3PEAI passivated sample) for the new feature peaks. Notably, the FA+ peak is much weaker in the CF3PEAI 2D passivated films than in other films, which is contributed to the shielding effect of the 2D capping layers.29 We deduce that CF3PEAI has a deepened reaction with the perovskite after annealing. Also, we observe the F 1s peak at 688.2 eV in Fig. 3c, which further indicates the presence of CF3PEAI on the surface.42 In the Pb 4f spectra (Fig. 3d), the small feature peaks of Pb0 at 141.7 eV and 136.8 eV reveal the presence of undercoordinated Pb ions on the perovskite surface.43 Interestingly, the Pb0 species disappear after passivation, which represents the reduction of nonradiative recombination centers. Furthermore, the Pbδ+ peak of the CF3PEAI passivated perovskite is observed to shift toward a lower binding energy due to the electron-donating nature of the Lewis base, which is attributed to the interaction between uncoordinated Pb2+ and F ions.35 It is noted that whether annealed or not, the CF3PEAI molecules demonstrate a similar passivation reaction with the defects. Relatively, passivation could be more effective after annealing, which implies that the trifluoromethyl groups still keep a desirable passivation effect when forming 2D perovskite.

Our first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) on the most common ionic defects FA+ vacancy (VFA) and I vacancy (VI) in FAPbI3 further prove the mechanism and effect of passivation.44Fig. 4a and b show the differential charge density distributions when the CF3PEAI molecule fills into VFA and VI on the FAPbI3 surface, respectively. We found that the CF3PEAI interacts with the surrounding I ions of VFA, mimicking the role that the phenethylamine group could play. Electrons are transferred from the CF3PEAI to VFA, accumulating mainly in one of the periphery iodine atoms. The same result could also be concluded from the electron localization function (ELF) results. After passivation, the profile of ELF around VFA is similar to that of the defect-free FAPbI3 (Fig. S3a†).45 As shown in Fig. S3b,† CF3PEAI could reduce the delocalization of the wave function around I ions caused by VFA (Fig. S3c†). The density of states (DOS) provides an intuitive demonstration for the passivation effect. For bare VFA, the Fermi level locates in the top of the valence band (Fig. 4c), indicative of p-type conduction, which would suppress the separation of charge carriers.46 Upon introducing CF3PEAI above VFA, the DOS partially recovers to the original one of defect-free FAPbI3 with the Fermi level moving back to the bandgap, implying that passivation with CF3PEAI could effectively modulate the defective structure.47

The Fermi level (represented by a dashed line) has been set to zero. (d) The LDOS of relative Pb in FAPbI3 with VI, passivated, and a perfect crystal. For a better comparison, the CBM for the three cases is aligned together. 
For the VI defect, the differential charge density plot (Fig. 4b) shows that CF3PEAI donates electrons to the uncoordinated Pb ion, consistent with the XPS results. As shown in the ELF (Fig. S3f†), the presence of VI reduces electron localization around lead atoms, which leads to nonradiative events.48 In contrast, when the trifluoromethyl molecule adsorbs above the Pb ion (Fig. S3e†), the passivation of the dangling states of the exposed Pb atoms induces almost the same ELF as defect-free ones (Fig. S3d†). The LDOS of the Pb atom at the top surface for the perfect surface, with VI, and the VI-CF3PEAI complex further confirms the passivation effect. As shown in Fig. 4d, the density of the trap state associated with VI, appearing at the bottom of the conduction band, reduces remarkably after CF3PEAI passivation. Furthermore, these defective states have an apparent blue shift of around 0.3 eV upon CF3PEAI adsorption, accounting for the prolonged lifetime of excited electrons.49 Hence, the simulation confirmed that CF3PEAI could renormalize the electronic structure associated with defects through passivating VFA and VI with amine and para-trifluoromethyl groups. All evidence reveals that CF3PEAI is a promising passivation candidate for promoting the performance of PSCs, and can passivate defects in the perovskite.
In order to verify the passivation depth, we carried out depth profiling with the CF3PEAI passivated samples. In the film without annealing, the peak at 688.2 eV decreases significantly at only 2 nm and completely disappeared after 8 nm (Fig. 5a). In contrast, the signal of F in the films could be detected even as deep as 32 nm after annealing (Fig. 5b). This elaborated observation indicates that the annealing process can help the passivation molecules react more deeply with the perovskite films. With much deeper protective layers, CF3PEAI 2D passivated films should have better stability than pristine and directly passivated films.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to investigate the electronic properties of the passivated perovskite films. Fig. S4† shows the details about the work function (WF) and valence band maximum (VBM). The bandgap of perovskite is found to 1.55 eV from the absorption band edge.50 By using the reported energy levels of the hole transport layer (HTL) Spiro-OMeTAD,51 the corresponding electronic alignment of all films is shown in Fig. 5c. From the secondary electron cutoff spectrum, we find that CF3PEAI passivation has enhanced the work function from 4.28 eV to 4.52 eV. The VBM with respect to the Fermi level (Ef) in the passivated film also shifts relative to the pristine film, which indicates a more p-type nature after passivation. As reported, the perovskite film of the p-type nature at the contact interface with the HTL can promote VOC for PSCs.39,52 It is not difficult to find that the passivated films have a higher VOC than the pristine ones, especially in 2D perovskite passivated films. However, the VBM of PEAI 2D passivated films (−5.02 eV) is much higher than the one of the HTL (−5.22 eV), which blocks the transfer of holes and thus forms a barrier.39 Concerning CF3PEAI, the VBM of CF3PEAI 2D passivated films (−5.24 eV) is much closer to that of the HTL, which can help carrier extraction at the interface. In contrast, the VBM of directly passivated CF3PEAI films (−5.36 eV) is much lower than that of the pristine ones, leading to a higher barrier. As a result, the CF3PEAI 2D passivated films have the most appropriate energy alignment with the HTL, which is beneficial to the performance of PSCs.
To verify the desirable performance of CF3PEAI 2D passivated perovskite in photovoltaics, PSCs with n–i–p planar heterojunction architecture (glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) were fabricated. The champion PCE of the CF3PEAI 2D passivated device is 21.05%, which is higher than those of the CF3PEAI directly treated device (20.28%) and the pristine one (18.87%) (Fig. 6a). The relevant performance parameters in reverse scanning directions are listed in Table S2.† With effective passivation, VOC of the CF3PEAI 2D based device increased by ∼70 mV compared to that of the control, and the fill factor (FF) is promoted to above 78%. Fig. S5† presents the statistical results (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) of the concentration dependent CF3PEAI 2D passivated devices, based on 20 cells per condition. VOC, the FF, and PCE are all greatly improved after CF3PEAI 2D passivation, and the device has the best performance when the concentration of CF3PEAI in isopropanol is 5 mg mL−1. Notably, the hysteresis effect (Fig. 6b) is significantly suppressed to <3% after CF3PEAI 2D post-treatment (Table S3†), which is attributed to the suppression of charge accumulation due to the reduction of ion migration, the decrease of surface defects, and the promotion of energy level alignment.

To confirm the hydrophobicity of the passivated films, we measured the contact angles with water of all perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S6,† the water contact angle of a pristine perovskite film is about 60°, which is lower than those of passivated perovskite films while the CF3PEAI 2D passivated surface has the largest contact angle (78°). With improved hydrophobicity, the CF3PEAI 2D passivated perovskite films will promote the stability of the devices.
What is more, a series of aging tests were performed to confirm the enhancement of the stability after CF3PEAI 2D post-treatment. By monitoring the light absorption of the unencapsulated perovskite films at 70–80% humidity and 85 °C, we evaluate the thermal and moisture stability of perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S7a,† the band edge of the films has a redshift after 85 °C aging in a nitrogen glove box, which is attributed to the escape of MA decreasing the bandgap. Due to the protection of passivation layers, the thermostability of the perovskite films is obviously promoted. As expected, the humidity stability of the films is also remarkably enhanced. The absorption intensity of passivated films remains almost the same, while that of the pristine one has a dramatic drop after 13 days (Fig. S7a†). Furthermore, Fig. 6c shows the time dependent PCE variation of unencapsulated devices stored under ambient conditions (RH, 70–80%). It is observed that the PCE of CF3PEAI 2D passivated devices is sustained with almost no decrease (98%) for 528 h of storage, while the pristine devices retain less than 85% of their initial PCE, which is consistent with the results of the absorption test.
Conclusion
In summary, through a combined study with first-principles calculations, we have demonstrated CF3PEAI as a competent candidate for surface passivation whose functional group could passivate various defects and prevent the surface from reacting with adsorbed moisture. Also, we conclude that with annealing, the passivation molecules could react more deeply with the perovskite surface. The formed CF3PEAI 2D passivation layer can remarkably increase VOC by up to 70 mV, attributed to the promoted energy level arrangement and suppressed trap states. With the CF3PEAI 2D passivated films, the PCE of the devices is increased from 18.87% to 21.05%. Beyond the significant improvement of the devices, the PCE remains at about 98% of the initial value after more than 500 h of aging in ambient air (RH, 70–80%).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Absorption spectra; (b) XRD patterns of perovskite films before and after passivation treatment (# represents the two-dimensional phase; & represents PbI2); (c) steady-state PL of the perovskite films with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm; (d) TCSPC spectra of the passivated and the pristine films.	 

 	Fig. 2  Top-surface SEM images of the perovskite films (a) the pristine; (c) treated with CF3PEAI; (e) treated with CF3PEAI 2D; and the AFM images of the films (b) the pristine; (d) treated with CF3PEAI; (f) treated with CF3PEAI 2D.	 

 	Fig. 3  XPS spectra and comparison of binding energies corresponding to the (a) C 1s core-level; (b) N 1s core-level; (c) F 1s core-level; (d) Pb 4f core-level of the pristine and modified perovskites.	 

 	Fig. 4  DFT simulation on the passivation of surface defects in cubic-phase FAPbI3 with the CF3PEAI molecule. Differential charge density when CF3PEAI fills into VFA (a) and VI (b). The blue (yellow) isosurfaces represent the loss (accumulation) of electron density; (c) the total DOS of FAPbI3 with VFA, passivated, and a perfect crystal. The Fermi level (represented by a dashed line) has been set to zero. (d) The LDOS of relative Pb in FAPbI3 with VI, passivated, and a perfect crystal. For a better comparison, the CBM for the three cases is aligned together.	 

 	Fig. 5  Depth profile XPS spectra at 0 nm, 1 nm, 2 nm, 4 nm, 8 nm, 16 nm, and 32 nm of (a) CF3PEAI directly passivated films and (b) CF3PEAI 2D passivated films; (c) energy alignment of the hybrid layers. The horizontal dashed lines indicate the Fermi level.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) The J–V curves of the devices; (b) J–V curves of the champion devices with and without CF3PEAI 2D passivated films under reverse and forward scans; (c) stability tests of the devices in ambient air (RH, 70–80%).
