However, their high production cost and relatively low energy efficiency still limit their feasibility. One of the critical components of VRFBs that can significantly influence the effectiveness and final cost is the electrode. Therefore, the development of an ideal electrocatalyst with low cost, high electrical conductivity, large active surface area, good chemical stability, and excellent electrochemical reaction activity toward the VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ redox reactions is essential for the design of VRFBs. Extensive research has been carried out on electrode modification routes for VRFBs to improve the energy density and overall performance for large-scale applications. This review article focuses on numerous state-of-the-art modification methods for VRFB electrodes, including those based on carbon materials, metal and metal oxide-based materials, and metal oxide/carbon composite materials. The challenges in the development of electrode materials and future research directions are also proposed.Anteneh Wodaje BayehDr Anteneh Wodaje Bayeh is currently an assistant professor at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology (AAIT), School of Chemical and Bioengineering, where he has been a faculty member since 2012.

1. Introduction
Recently, the rapid growth of social development and the global economy has considerably increased the electrical energy demand.1 The expansion of renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind can contribute to the future energy mix.2 However, these renewable sources are variable and intermittent. They can create fluctuations in electric power generation, which can make them non-dispatchable.3,4 To remedy these limitations, large scale energy storage systems (ESSs) that can respond rapidly are essential to match the fluctuations in power generation and improve grid reliability.5 Over the last 30 years, several ESSs have been introduced and successfully demonstrated, including mechanical methods (e.g., pumped-storage hydroelectricity and compressed-air energy storage), electrochemical and chemical methods (e.g., rechargeable lead-acid batteries, lithium-ion batteries, and fuel cells), and thermal methods (e.g., sensible heat storage and latent heat storage). Among various ESSs, pumped-storage hydroelectricity and compressed-air energy storage are economically feasible, but both require special geological and geographical conditions, significant capital investment, and maintenance cost.6,7 Apart from the mentioned ESSs, redox flow batteries (RFBs) can offer a great potential to overcome these drawbacks and act as a buffer between intermittent electricity production and customer requirements for the immediate distribution of electric power.7
RFBs are electrochemical energy storage devices that convert and store electrical energy into chemical energy and release it in a controlled manner upon demand, providing an alternative solution to balancing power generation, consumption, and load leveling.8 A typical RFB consists of two external reservoirs for storing energy, a cell unit for energy conversion, and the circulation system between the electrolyte tanks and the cell units. Owing to the liquid electrolyte and electroactive materials stored externally, RFBs have many advantages over solid-state secondary battery systems, such as flexible design, fast response, high safety, easy thermal management, and low operation and maintenance cost.9–11 Modern RFBs were first developed in the 1970s when the Fe/Cr RFB was invented at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, USA).12,13 Since then, several RFBs have been investigated, including V/Fe,8 V/Ce,14 and V/V.13 Furthermore, it is also possible to operate RFBs in a hybrid configuration system. RFBs, such as Zn/halide,15 Fe/Fe,8 Fe/Cu,16 and Cu/Cu,14 involve the plating/stripping of metal deposited at the electrode, resulting in the limitation of the amount of energy that can be stored and the cycle life of the battery system.17,18 Because of the use of the same vanadium metal ions at both positive (catholyte) and negative (anolyte) half-cells in four different oxidation states, the vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) can alleviate the cross-contamination issue through the membrane.11 Moreover, any capacity fading can be reversed by the simple mixing of the two half-cell electrolytes periodically, making VRFBs reliable and durable.13
1.1. Cell reaction and cell potential

Fig. 1 illustrates the working principle and basic structure of a VRFB, where two electrolyte reservoirs and the cell stack, in which an ion-exchange membrane separates each half cell. The two reservoirs comprise VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ sulfate electrolytes in the positive and negative half-cells, respectively.14 While these redox reactions occur, proton ions diffuse across the membrane, and electrons transfer through an external circuit. The electrochemical reactions during the discharging process are listed as follows:19,20
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the VRFB system. 
Positive electrode reaction: VO2+ + 2H+ + e− → VO2+ + H2O, E0 = 1.0 V(1)
Negative electrode reaction: V2+ → V3+ + e−, E0 = 0.26 V(2)
Overall electrochemical reaction of the cell: VO2+ + 2H+ + V2+ → VO2+ + H2O + V3+, E0 = 1.26 V(3)
As shown in the figure, the charging and discharging processes are performed via the oxidation and reduction of different vanadium ions. As a result, the standard open-circuit voltage (OCV) of a VRFB single cell is 1.26 V. At the given temperature, pH value, and concentration of vanadium ions, the cell voltage (E) can be calculated based on the Nernst equation:19,21 (4)where T, F, and R are the absolute temperature, Faraday constant, and the universal gas constant, respectively. Besides different oxidation states of vanadium, the appreciable solubility of the redox couples and the redox potential of the vanadium ions (VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+) in H2SO4 solution are well above the potential in which the H2 evolution reaction occurs, which makes VRFBs fulfill the best requirements of the flow battery concept.14,21 If the charge/discharge operation induces the H2 evolution reaction, it can consume electrolytes and change the concentration of the electrolyte during operation, leading to the loss of capacity.
Skyllas-Kazacos Maria's group proposed VRFBs from the University of New South Wales (UNSW),22,23 showing notable progress among the current RFBs. Onwards, the UNSW group has carried out extensive research on membrane and electrode modification,24 electrolyte production and optimization,25 material selection and evaluation,23 and modeling, cell control and simulations.26,27 In particular, the electrode is the critical component of the VRFB system, which provides the active sites for the electrochemical reaction but does not take part directly in the electrochemical reaction. The reversibility and activity of the electrode towards the vanadium redox couple reaction determine the electrochemical polarization, while the hydrophilicity and pore structure of the electrode have significant influences on the concentration polarization.28,29
Many researchers have recently focused on improving the electrode performance using various methods such as those based on carbon-based materials, metal materials, and metal oxide-based materials as electrocatalysts for VRFBs. However, they emphasized technical trends and how to choose carbon materials, improve the process, and perform surface modification—for instance, Kim et al. discussed the progress in electrodes as critical components of the VRFB and their reaction mechanisms.30 Amini et al. emphasized providing an overview of the developments of metal and metal oxide electrocatalysts and comparing the electrode performances in VRFBs.31 Liu et al. reviewed the effect of electrode modification on different types of polarization, such as electrochemical, ohmic, and concentration polarization of VRFBs.28 Recently, Lv et al. also reported the advancement in metals and metal oxides as the catalysts for VRFBs with regard to their properties and structures.32 They summarized metals and metal oxides by classifying them according to their similar properties of the same group elements. At the same time, different research papers have been published on the synthesis and characterization of different metal oxides and carbon-based materials as the electrodes for VRFBs. Hence, an insightful overview and discussion about the recent progress in developing electrode materials in VRFB are critical.
This review article focuses on numerous state-of-the-art modification methods for VRFB electrodes. We intend to provide a comprehensive review of the latest progress in developing electrocatalysts and electrode materials by categorizing them into three broad classes as carbon materials, noble metal materials, metal oxide-based materials, and metal oxide/carbon composite materials. The redox reaction mechanisms are also briefly discussed. Furthermore, the challenges in the development of electrode materials and future research directions are highlighted. This review article's primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive view of this research area and useful guidance for researchers and provide a merely accessible summary of the available data concentrating on electrode modifications for VRFB application.
2. Operating cell voltage
In a practical system, the theoretical cell potential is always higher than the actual cell potential during the charging–discharging process because of the cell's internal resistance (internal loss). The internal loss affects the cell potential due to activation overpotential, concentration overpotential, and ohmic loss (iR loss). During the operation, the overall cell potential can be described as21,33,34 Vcell = (EC − EA) − ηA − ηC − iRcell(5)where Vcell is the discharge voltage of the cell, and EC and EA denote the cathode and anode potential (V), respectively. ηA is the activation overpotential, which is due to electrochemical kinetics on the electrodes, and it is related to the energy required to initiate charge transfer between reactants and electrodes. ηC is the concentration overpotential which is associated with the mass transport process at the interface, i is the current density (mA cm−2), and Rcell is the ohmic resistance for the given electrode cross-sectional area (Ω cm2). The ohmic resistance loss is related to the resistances of the membrane, electrodes, and current collectors.21,34 Generally, the activation loss and the ohmic loss dominate in the VRFB cell system.

Fig. 2 shows the potential loss of overall voltage and energy efficiency, which provides a breakdown of the cell charge–discharge performance under constant current density. From the diagrammatic representation, Region 1 signifies the stage at the beginning of charge and discharge, dominated by ohmic and activation losses inside the cell. The cell with lower loss has a lower initial charge voltage and a higher discharge voltage.35 Voltage changes smoothly in Region 2. In this stage, the concentration of vanadium ions in the electrolyte dominates the cell's voltage changes. In Region 3, the voltage sharply changes at the end of the charging–discharging process owing to the mass transport limitation.36,37

3. Electrode materials for VRFBs
The redox reaction on the electrode surface requires some multiple steps rather than simple and a single step. For the sake of clarity and understanding, the electrode processes can be summarized into four main steps: electron transfer, mass transport, non-faradaic reaction, and the migration process.38,39 As displayed in Fig. 3, except for the diffusion and migration process of conductive particles at the electrolyte side, the other processes are closely associated with the microstructure, composition, and surface chemistry of the electrode.38 Therefore, the overall reaction rate mostly depends on the physicochemical properties of the electrode.3 To obtain higher energy efficiency, the electrode material should have the following characteristics: excellent conductivity, stable 3D surface structure with a high active surface area, high electrochemical activity, and chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical stability.11,39
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagram of the four necessary steps for a simple electrode process. 
Because of the typical acidic and corrosive environment in a VRFB, the choice of electrode materials is somewhat limited. Carbon-based materials are considered to be the most feasible electrode materials in the VRFB because of their excellent potential in terms of operation range, good permeability, large surface area, and reasonable cost.1,40 Several carbon-based materials such as carbon felt, carbon paper, and graphite felt are widely used in VRFBs. Graphite felt or carbon felt is known to have a large specific surface area, high conductivity, and excellent electrochemical stability in a highly acidic environment. The raw materials for the felts can have a profound effect on their performance for VRFBs. Skyllas-Kazacos et al. conducted a detailed study to understand the difference in the electrochemical response of rayon and polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based graphite felts, in which the electrical conductivity of the PAN-based felt was higher than that of the rayon-based felt.41 Besides, the PAN-based felt is more resistant to oxidation, while the rayon-based felt reacts more quickly with oxygen to form CO bonds.13,41
Although graphite felt (GF) and carbon felt (CF) materials have the above advantages, their low kinetics are associated with reduction and oxidation of vanadium ions and inadequate wettability in aqueous solutions due to their hydrophobic nature, which may restrict their broad applications.20,42 In general, typical GF or CF electrode material modification methods can be mainly divided into three types: using carbon-based materials, metallic and metal oxide-based materials, and metal oxide/carbon composite materials. As summarized in Fig. 4, there have been several publications on the application of carbon-based materials as VRFB electrodes, such as graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene (G), and carbon nanotubes (CNT). These electrode materials are attractive due to their high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and relative inertness. Such materials are available in diverse forms, ranging from isolated particles to monolithic foam and felt structures. Moreover, several surface treatments, such as thermal treatment, acid treatment, carbon nanotube (CNT) addition, and doping of atoms, may facilitate the reaction kinetics on GF/CF electrodes. Despite the improvement in electrochemical activities with electrodes modified by carbon-based materials, the cell-cycling performance remains unknown for VRFBs.
 Fig. 4  Summary of the development of carbon-based materials for VRFBs. 
Metal electrode materials such as Au, Pb, Pt, platinized titanium (Pt–Ti), and dimensionally stable electrodes (DSAs) based on iridium oxide have been evaluated for use in VRFBs.24,39 Although these precious metals have excellent electrical conductivity and chemical stability, their costs limit their commercial applications.7 Moreover, some of them do not show good electrochemical behavior. For example, the redox reaction of Au towards the vanadium redox couple is not reversible, and Pt forms non-conductive films during the reaction.43 For Ti and Pb, owing to the highly corrosive nature of VO2+ species, passivation will be formed, which leads to an increase in electric resistance.43 The problem associated with the passivation film can be successfully avoided by using the (Pt–Ti) alloy. However, because of the high cost of Pt, it is unsuitable for practical application.24 In general, a DSA electrode is manufactured by coating a titanium substrate with a thin metal or alloy oxide, which is selected from the following group of metals, such as Os, Pt, Ru, Ir, Mn, and Rh.7,13
Several electrochemically active and acid resistance metal oxides, such as Mn3O4, WO3, Nb2O5, and PbO2, have been studied to improve the VRFB performance.11,44–46 For example, in 2012, Mn3O4 nanoparticles, a cheap and non-precious metal oxide catalyst, were successfully integrated on the CF electrode surface for the first time, which enhanced the electrochemical performance of CF electrodes by facilitating the redox reaction of vanadium ions.44 As summarized in Fig. 5, during 2013 to 2020, approximately 80 articles have been published, signifying that metal oxide-modified carbon electrodes were the most promising materials for VRFBs. The improvement in VRFB research is readily evident in Fig. 6, showing the total number of publications each year, which has been categorized into four groups of metal oxide-based electrodes as: inert transition metal oxides, improving metal oxides by heteroatom doping, conductive layer formation, and carbon–metal oxide composite formation. However, although interest is growing, the total number of VRFB papers is still small compared to conventional batteries (e.g., Li-ion batteries) or polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The GF, CF, or CP electrodes have been decorated with different metal oxide-based materials to improve the electrochemical performance of the support by:

(1) Increasing the hydrophilicity of the electrode (e.g., Ta2O5, CeO2, ZrO2, Cr2O3, CoO, and TiO2 modified GF).1,47–51 As Skyllas-Kazacos et al. previously reported, increasing the amount of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of the electrode can improve the wettability and hence the electrolyte accessibility of the electrode, which provides more active sites and improves the electrochemical activity towards the VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples.52
(2) Improving the conductivity of electrode materials using doping or creating defect rich structure on the surface of electrodes (e.g., W–Nb2O5, Nb–WO3, Ce–ZrO2, N-TiO2, H2-treated TiO2, and W18O49).11,53–55 Doping with the optimal amount of foreign metal atoms on metal oxides or partial treatment of the metal oxide surface with hydrogen produces moderate defect states, thereby creating structural disorder, such as oxygen vacancies, which leads to the generation of more active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox reactions on the electrode.
(3) Improving the performance of metal oxide-based electrodes by blending with carbon materials (e.g., N-rGO–Mn3O4, TiNb2O7–rGO, Mn3O4–polyaniline, WO3–graphene foam).2,3,56,57 Since GF, CF, and CP-based materials have low specific surface areas, compared to porous carbon materials such as rGO, CNTs, GO, and graphene, it is essential to increase the electrochemically active surface area of electrodes by incorporating them. Although carbon materials have the above merits, they show low hydrophilic characteristics. Therefore, blending porous carbon materials with metal oxides can improve the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes.
3.1. Carbon-based material modified GF/CF
Nanostructured electrode materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),58 graphene,59 and graphene oxide (GO),60 multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),61 and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs),62 have also been introduced into all VRFBs. Because of their excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical stability, several research groups suggested CNT materials for VRFBs. For instance, Tan et al. used CNTs to modify the glassy carbon (GC) electrode.63 CNTs were functionalized by acid treatment, increasing the oxygen-containing functional groups and making the surface hydrophilic.64 These functional groups serve as active sites and facilitate the redox reaction process. For the modified GC electrode, an increase in reaction current was observed when increasing the content of oxygen-containing functional groups and enhancing the electrical conductivity of CNTs.42 Han et al. explained the effects of treatment temperature for GO nanosheet samples.65 They found that heat-treated GO revealed an excellent electrocatalytic activity towards V3+/V2+ and VO2+/VO2+ redox couples, which was ascribed to the presence of a large number of carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups on the edges and basal planes as well as the high active surface area of heat-treated GO. Another study was conducted by González et al. using thermal reduction methods, in which they prepared different kinds of GO electrodes.66 After a wide range of investigations of the structural and electrochemical activity of GO, it was found that the presence of the C–OH functional group and its high electrical conductivity were critical for facilitating the redox reaction of VO2+/VO2+ on the surface of the GO electrode. However, single GO nanosheet-based electrodes suffer from low rate capability; thus, the power capability and energy density are limited. Hence, to improve the ion and electron transport capability, the hybrid of GO nanosheets and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (GO/MWCNTs) was fabricated on the GC surface using an electrostatic spray technique after efficient ultrasonic treatment (Fig. 7a and b). The GO/MWCNT hybrid material shows the cross-linked structure with an effective mixed conducting network, showing fast electron and ion transport characteristics (Fig. 7c–f). Compared with pure MWCNTs and GO nanosheets, the hybrid one provides much better electrocatalytic activity towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple.67 Similarly, Li et al.68 reported a graphite/GO composite electrode for VRFBs to improve the redox process towards VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ couples. In comparison to the single graphite electrode, the composite electrode shows enhanced performance with a lower charge transfer resistance and higher peak current densities. The improvement of the electrode's electrochemical activity can be attributed to the high specific surface area induced by GO and the presence of high amounts of oxygen-containing functional groups on the sheet edges and basal planes of the GO.

As illustrated in Fig. 8a and b, the composite electrode's catalytic reaction mechanism is similar to that of thermal treatment (Fig. 9a and b). The presence of large oxygen-containing functional groups on the sheet edges and basal planes of the GO leads to adsorption of vanadium ions on the electrode surface, which acts as the active sites and catalyzes the electron transfer process. Li et al. used the dip-coating method to modify the CF surface using SWCNTs and obtained better electrocatalytic activity than the bare CF towards the VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples.69 The peak current density values that correspond to the redox couples considerably enhanced the SWCNT-modified CF surface, suggesting the improvement in the modified electrode's electrochemical activity. Furthermore, they proved that the anodic process was more dependent on the SWCNT surface oxygen than the cathodic process. The enhancement in the overall single cell performance of the SWCNT-modified electrode is due to oxygen functional groups, the large specific surface area, and the surface defects on the SWCNTs. However, the major drawback of this method is the attachment force between the CF and the SWCNTs, which depends on the weak van der Waals force. The flowing electrolyte may erode the catalyst causing durability problems.

Even though carbon-based electrodes have good electrocatalytic activity, because of their low operational life span and the reversibility of electrode reactions, designing another suitable modification method is essential. Different surface modification methods have been employed to enhance the electrochemical activity of carbon materials, such as nitrogenization,59,70–72 oxidation treatment,73–76 and introduction of metals and metal oxide electrocatalysts.9,11,45–47,77,78 Most of the surface treatment approaches introduce the oxygen-containing functional group to improve the redox activity and wettability.

3.1.1. Oxidation treatment. 
The oxidation treatment method is one of the most effective ways to improve carbon electrode materials' electrocatalytic performance by providing surface oxygen-containing functional groups. Thermal treatment (i.e., heat-treatment) may be considered as the simplest surface oxidation method and was first reported by Sun and Skyllas-Kazacos in the mid-1990s.52 The optimal thermal treatment parameters for the GF were found to be 400 °C for 30 h. The improved performance was attributed to an increment in the amount of surface oxygen functional groups such as C–OH, CO, and C–OOH, which improved the GF's hydrophilicity while providing active sites for the vanadium redox couple reactions. They proposed the redox reaction mechanisms to elucidate the role of oxygen-containing functional groups on the GF surface in both negative and positive reactions. As shown in Fig. 9a, during the charging reaction process, the first step is the ion exchange process, in which the VO2+ from the bulk solution exchanges with H+ ions from the C–OH functional groups. As illustrated in Fig. 9a of step 2, the oxygen atoms from the C–OH group transferred to the VO2+ ions to form VO2+, whereas the electron is transferred from VO2+ to the electrode along with the C–O–V bond. Finally, the ion exchange reaction was terminated between the VO2+ and H+ ions from the electrolyte (Fig. 9a of step 3). During the discharging process, the opposite redox reaction will occur on the GF surface. Similarly, Kim et al. also proposed the reduction mechanism of V3+ on the GF surface (Fig. 9b).79 For the discharge process (Fig. 9b of step 1), first, the V3+ ion diffuses from the bulk solution to the electrode surface and exchanges with the H+ ions from the C–OH followed by an electron transfer process from the C–OH of the electrode to the V3+ using the C–O–V bridge to form the V2+ ion (Fig. 9b of step 2). The final step is the ion exchange of V2+ with H+ and diffusion back to the solution (Fig. 9b of step 3).
Although conventional oxidation treatment improves the electrode's electrochemical performance, it is known to be energy and time-consuming or harmful to the environment.80 To alleviate these drawbacks, Wu et al. developed a microwave treatment to enhance the electrochemical activity of graphite felt as the positive electrode in all-VRFBs.80 The obtained results show that GF treated by microwaves at 400C for 15 minutes exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and reversibility towards the vanadium redox couple. Moreover, this electrode's overall performance is much higher than those of the cells assembled with conventionally and thermally treated GF electrodes. The microwave treated GF has more hydrophilic groups, such as –OH, on its defects and a rough surface, which is advantageous for facilitating the redox reaction of vanadium ions, leading to the efficient operation of a VRFB.
Another approach to generating more oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GF or CF is a chemical treatment, in which the electrodes are immersed into containers having oxidizing solutions, such as H2O2, KMnO4, HNO3, and H2SO4, as well as their mixtures.79,81–84 In general, treating carbon materials using these highly oxidizing chemicals could have the following contributions: (1) the strongly oxidizing chemicals can oxidize unsaturated bonds such as CC and convert them into oxygen-containing functional groups (C–OOH, C–OH, CO); (2) they can remove impurities from the surface of carbon materials; and (3) owing to the corrosive nature of the chemicals, they can etch the surface of the GF, though the etching capacity is weaker than thermal treatment. The first research work on the chemical oxidation of GF has been reported by Sun and Skyllas-Kazacos.79 The GF was treated with different concentrations of boiling sulphuric acid at different periods. They have studied the charge–discharge performance and inner resistance of the battery as a function of the concentration of GF solution and treatment time. The GF modified by concentrated H2SO4 for 5 h shows optimal electrochemical performance improvement due to an increment in the surface concentration of functional groups (C–O, CO) produced during activation. These groups enhance the GF electrode's hydrophilicity, which could behave as active sites and catalyze the vanadium species. In addition to the thermal and chemical modification methods, there are also several oxidation treatment methods such as γ-ray irradiation, electrochemical oxidation, plasma treatment, mild oxidation, and corona discharge.82,85,86 In all cases, high concentrations of surface-active oxygen functional groups have been successfully introduced onto the surface of the CF or GF electrodes, which are mainly responsible for improving the energy efficiency of VRFBs. Furthermore, the wettability of the CF or GF electrodes can also be significantly improved.
Our RFB research group studied simple, green, and potentially cost-effective methods, using water vapor (H2O) or carbon dioxide gas (CO2) to activate GF electrodes.20,87 As shown in the schematic design (Fig. 10a and b), a small and controlled amount of H2O vapor or CO2 gas was introduced into the GF surface to produce high contents of oxygen-containing functional groups, which are known to be electrochemically active sites for the redox reaction. GF activated by optimum amounts of H2O vapor or CO2 gas exhibit the highest electrochemical activity and VRFB single cell performance among the reported electrodes. In another approach, Abbas et al.88 presented the improvement in the CF electrode's performance using cobalt oxide as an etching agent to form carbon nanorods on the surface of the CF fibers. As shown in Fig. 11a, this method involves the thermal treatment of the catalyst-loaded CF in air to produce aligned nanorods on its fibers. The surface morphology is optimized by changing the etching temperature, treatment time, and catalyst type. The catalytically etched CF electrode at 400 °C for 1 hour shows an improved surface wettability and an enlarged specific surface area compared to pristine CF and the CF electrode treated at 300, 350, and 500 °C that lead to an enhancement of the kinetics process towards vanadium redox reactions (Fig. 11b–g).

Recently, Jiang et al.89 reported the use of potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) as an agent to create the porous structure, graphitized carbon, and more oxygen-containing groups on the carbon nanofiber simultaneously at high annealing temperature. Hence, K2FeO4 is used as both the activating agent (KOH) and the catalyst (Fe) to etch, graphitize, and functionalize the carbon nanofiber. Compared with the CNF, the optimized electrode treated with K2FeO4 exhibits an increase in electrocatalytic activity towards V3+/V2+ and VO2+/VO2+ redox reactions. As shown in Fig. 12, an increase in electrocatalytic activity could be due to the following reasons: (1) the presence of large oxygen-containing groups which act as active sites for vanadium redox reactions and increase the hydrophilicity of the carbon nanofiber; (2) the porous structure could provide a large reaction space for a vanadium redox reaction; and (3) an increase in the degree of graphitization improves the conductivity of CNTs, which results in rapid electron transfer for vanadium redox reactions.

Overall, as mentioned above, oxidation treatment becomes one of the effective modification methods to activate the carbon electrode surface. Because of increasing the contents of oxygen-containing functional groups and the wettability (making more hydrophilic) of the carbonaceous surface after oxidation treatment, the electrocatalytic activities of carbon electrode materials were improved towards vanadium redox couples compared with pristine carbon materials. However, over-oxidation can reduce the strength and electrical conductivity of carbon electrode materials, and hence cause a decrease in the electrochemical performance of the battery.


3.1.2. Nitrogenization treatment. 
As explained above, oxidation treatment methods on carbon materials have some drawbacks such as low electrical conductivity and excessive surface oxidation, leading to the deterioration of carbon fibers and decreasing the electrode performance. To avoid the negative effects, nitrogenous functional groups were given attention to increase the active catalytic sites and improve the electrochemical performance of carbon-based electrodes.90 Additionally, according to the DFT calculations, the carbon atoms adjacent to nitrogen dopants possess a remarkably high positive charge density to counterbalance the strong electronic affinity of the nitrogen atom. The nitrogen induced positively charged carbon atoms can act as the active sites for a vanadium redox reaction.91,92 The presence of excess valence electrons in nitrogen atoms can also contribute additional charge for carbon materials, facilitating the charge transfer process.92 Shao et al. first demonstrated the electrochemical performance of nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (N-MPC) for energy storage in VRFBs.90 Mesoporous carbon (MPC) was synthesized using a soft-template method and doping nitrogen with heat treatment of the MPC by employing NH3. Compared with graphite electrodes and MPC, the electrocatalytic kinetics of the redox couple VO2+/VO2+ is significantly enhanced on the surface of the N-MPC electrode. Moreover, nitrogen doping facilitates the electron transfer process on the electrode/electrolyte interface. Jin et al.70 also reported nitrogen-doped graphene sheets (NGS) by annealing GO with urea at various annealing temperatures for positive electrodes in VRFBs. Among the reported samples, the NGS annealed at optimum temperature shows an improvement in catalytic performance regarding reversibility and electron transfer resistance. They also explained that not the degree of nitrogen doping but the type of nitrogen-doped on carbon materials determines the electrode's electrocatalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 13a–c, there are four types of nitrogenous functional groups: oxidic-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, and pyridinic-N. To identify which nitrogen group has a more substantial influence on the electrocatalytic performance, they plot peak current density versus each nitrogen species. The obtained result displays an excellent linear relationship between peak current density (both cathodic and anodic) and quaternary nitrogen concentration, but no direct correlation with the other three nitrogen functional groups. Since quaternary nitrogen is less susceptible to protonation and hence highly stable in acidic solution, they concluded that this nitrogen species in NGS can act as the active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. Fig. 13d illustrates the corresponding reaction mechanism for the catalytic process towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple. First, in the reduction reaction, because of the negatively charged density of nitrogen, this promotes the adsorption of VO2+ and forms an N–V transition state between excess electrons in the nitrogen atom and empty molecular orbital of VO2+. Second, the electrons from the electrode move into the antibonding orbital of VO2+ through the N–V bond. Third, the additional electron in the VO2+ weakens the VO bond and removes one of the oxygens with two H+. Finally, the VO2+ is moved from the active site, and the oxidation reaction of VO2+ follows in opposite directions during the oxidation process.

Recently, Huang et al.93 reported N, O Co-doped carbon felt using plasma treatment methods for all VRFBs. The N, O Co-doped CF was obtained by treating the CF surface with the mixture of O2 and N2 plasma, which results in improved electrochemical activity and overall electrode performance. The battery's enhanced electrochemical performance is due to synergetic co-doping effects, enhanced affinity with the electrolyte, and the change in electronic properties by the heteroatoms. Moreover, doping carbon materials with boron,94 phosphorus,95 boron/nitrogen,96 and nitrogen/phosphorus97 co-doping has been reported to enhance the electrochemical performance of carbon-based electrodes. For instance, Jiang et al. and Ryu et al. reported the dual doping of boron and boron/nitrogen atoms on the GF surface, respectively (Fig. 14a–g), which enhances the electrochemical performance of the battery.94,98

The optimized heteroatom-doping in carbon structures plays a crucial role in the catalytic activities of GF in the following ways: (1) it can create the porous structure on the carbon surface, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of vanadium ions by enhancing electron transfer kinetics and mass transfer; (2) improves the wettability of the electrode, thereby increasing the interfacial area available for the reaction; and (3) enhances the electrochemical performance of the battery due to the formation of defective structures, which alters the electronic properties and enhances the charge transfer process at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte (Table 1).

3.2. Synthesis approaches for metal and metal-oxide electrocatalysts
Different synthesis approaches have been used to improve the GF/CF electrodes using metal and metal oxide based electrocatalysts for VEFBs. These approaches are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. A number of synthetic routes such as addition of metal ions directly into the electrolyte solution, immersion–drying, electrodeposition, hydrothermal, and electrospinning methods have been pursued over the years.106 For instance, in metal ion addition, the pristine carbon electrode was directly immersed into an electrolyte containing metal ions in solution. In this regard, the electrode potential of metallic ions should allow them to be deposited on the surface of the electrode during charging at the beginning of VO2+/VO2+ or before the V2+/V3+ redox reactions. Depending on the electrode potential of the catalyst, the metal may dissolve back into the electrolyte during discharging. This method is appropriate only for some metal ions having their electrode potential for electrodeposition closer to the electrode potential of the vanadium redox couples. Furthermore, this method can lead to formation of large particles on the electrolyte due to agglomeration and removal of nanoparticles from the surface of the electrode.106

The immersion–drying method requires immersion of the pristine electrode in a solution containing a water-soluble precursor. Among others due to simple implementation, this method is frequently used.107 The most commonly used precursors include inorganic metal salts, such as metal sulfates, nitrates, chlorides, carbonates, and organic metal complexes, such as metal acetylacetonates. Because of the high solubility of inorganic salts, water is the most commonly used solvent, whereas for organometallic precursors, organic solvents are used. In order to avoid early deposition of the metal precursor in bulk solution, concentrations below super-saturation are required. During immersion of the electrode in the precursor solution, metal-containing species either undergo ion exchange with moieties on the substrate or adsorbed onto the substrate.107 Subsequently, the electrode is washed and dried to remove unwanted materials. Finally, the electrode will be annealed to form a metal oxide and during the reduction step the metal oxide reduced into the corresponding metal. However, inhomogeneous distributions inside the catalyst grains are often reported after drying and calcination when using this method.
In the electrodeposition method, the pristine electrode is immersed in solution containing appropriate metal ions and then current is applied to the electrode. The diffusion rate of metal ions can be controlled by ion concentration; hence, an appropriately slow ion diffusion rate will enable the deposition of metal atoms on the electrode.108 This technique has the following advantages such as: (1) the size and amount of the deposited metal can be controlled by changing electrodeposition parameters such as deposition time and concentration of the metal precursor in solution. (2) Due to the deposition of metal on the outer surface of the carbon electrode, it is possible to maximize the utilization of metals, and (3) the deposition method is facile and scalable, without involving high-temperature calcination.109
In the preparation of metal oxide electrocatalysts, the most common synthesis method is the hydrothermal and solvothermal procedure.110 In hydrothermal synthesis, chemical reactions occur in an aqueous solution above the boiling point of water and solvothermal synthesis in a non-aqueous solution at relatively high temperatures. The hydrothermal and solvothermal process has many advantages such as: (1) the morphology, crystal size, composition and polymorphism of the prepared phases are easily controlled. (2) High-purity products can be synthesized and (3) experimental parameters such as pH, concentration of chemical species, temperature and pressure, and oxidation and reduction potential can be controlled.110 Although the conventional hydrothermal/solvothermal process has been in use for a long time, the hydrothermal/solvothermal procedure in combination with microwave and ultrasonic fields is very important in the future. As reported in some research studies listed in Tables 2 and 3, in order to enhance the adhesion between the carbon electrode and metal oxide particles, the hydrothermal process is followed by annealing.
Electrospinning is another approach used to prepare metal oxide electrocatalysts for VRFB application. In the standard electrospinning procedure, fibers are spun from a solution or melt through a metallic needle by applying a high electric field. The electrospinning setup can also be modified so that resultant nanofibers can be collected between two parallel electrodes.111 The diameter of electrospun nanofibers can be adjusted by simply changing the electrospinning parameters such as the flow rate of the feed solution, applied electric field, and polymer concentration. Following the electrospinning procedure, the collected fabric is subjected to a calcination step to form the metal oxide compound and burn off the polymeric template. However, high temperature calcination induces the shrinkage of the fiber diameter and becomes more brittle. Hence, it is desirable for a supplementary material, which is chemically and mechanically unaffected by heating during the course of calcination.111
3.3. Metal-based electrocatalysts
Alternatively, to improve the performance of carbonaceous electrode materials Sun et al. previously reported the chemical modification of graphite fibers by impregnating them with solutions containing In3+, Te4+, Au4+, Mn2+, Pd2+, Pt4+, and Ir3+ ions.76 The modified electrode's electrochemical activity in acidic solution using Mn2+, Te4+, and In3+ ions showed improvement in electrochemical activity compared with the untreated fiber electrode, while high hydrogen evolution rates were obtained on Pt4+, Pd2+, and Au4+ modified electrodes. The electrode modified by Ir3+ exhibited the best electrochemical behavior for the various vanadium redox species. Based on the above achievement, Wang et al. investigated CF modified by pyrolysis of Ir, which was reduced from H2IrCl6.112 During the preparation, PAN-based CF was immersed in ethanol solution containing H2IrCl6 for two minutes and dried in a vacuum. Subsequently, the modified felt was thermally treated to obtain the Ir coated CF electrode. The prepared electrode showed an improvement in electrochemical activity and lowered hydrogen evolution overpotential towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple. Moreover, the resistance of the cell using Ir-modified CF decreased by 25% compared to the cell using unmodified CF, and the former electrode achieved a voltage efficiency of 87.5% at a lower current density of 20 mA cm−2.
After a long time of no attention being paid to metallic electrocatalysts, Flox et al. studied the use of graphene-supported monometallic (Pt) and bimetallic (CuPt3) cubic nanocatalysts as new positive electrode materials for improving the VO2+/VO2+ redox process.113 As shown in Fig. 15a–d, the CuPt3 nanoparticles are uniformly embedded within the graphene layer. The presence of the CuPt3 nanocubes on the graphene surface conferred higher electrocatalytic activity due to the high electroactive area compared to the Pt nanoparticles. Moreover, the formation of –OH functional groups at the Cu–Pt surface generated from water dissociation enhances the wettability and hydrophilic properties of heat-treated GO. These –OH groups on the graphene surface catalyze the redox reaction by generating active sites for the positive reaction of VRFBs. The proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. 15e. Because of the presence of excess –OH species on the surface of the CuPt3/GO electrode, a high amount of vanadium ions were adsorbed and formed oxovanadate species, which can generate a networked structure with high electronic conductivity and oxygen transfer capability at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the composite electrode shows improvement in electrocatalytic activity.

Compared to noble metals such as Pt, Ir, and Ru, bismuth (Bi) has low cost, is easy to prepare, and has high hydrogen evolution overpotential, and has attracted attention for electrochemical devices.114 Owing to the formation of hydrogen that directly competes with the V3+/V2+ redox reaction, hydrogen evolution in the negative half-cell is one of the leading causes of charge imbalance resulting in the loss of efficiency.115 Like some transition metals, Sn, In, Pb, and Bi have high hydrogen evolution overpotential, which might suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction in secondary batteries.38,116 Hence, minimizing the hydrogen evolution reaction of the negative half-cell is one of the most critical issues to be solved. Suárez et al. studied a GF decorated with Bi nanoparticles as a negative electrode towards V3+/V2+ redox reactions in VRFBs.115 The result confirmed that graphite felts decorated with Bi nanoparticles (Bi-TTGF) show excellent electrochemical performance in terms of long term cycling performance and reversibility towards the V3+/V2+ redox reaction to the heat-treated GF (TTGF). Moreover, as expected, the Bi-TTGF electrode suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction because of the large hydrogen overpotential. However, as shown in the linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) of different samples (Fig. 16a and b), the TTGF electrode shows a higher overpotential than the Bi-TTGF electrode. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that an increment of the modified electrode's activity is not associated with the increase in hydrogen evolution overpotential rather the complex process shown in Fig. 16c. Accordingly, they proposed a mechanism that can explain the role of Bi nanoparticles in the V3+/V2+ redox reaction. Bi nanoparticles favor the formation of the BiHx intermediate that reduces V3+ to V2+ and, hence, inhibit the competitive irreversible reaction of hydrogen formation. Thus, the total charge consumed during the cathodic sweep in this electrode is used to reduce V3+ to V2+, resulting in a highly reversible and efficient process. The same group also demonstrated that the Bi nanoparticles improved performance for the positive VO2+/VO2+ and the negative V3+/V2+ redox chemistry, but they mentioned that the difference was more significant for the V3+/V2+ redox chemistry due to the challenge faced in containing the competitive HER.114

The Wang et al. research group demonstrated the electrodeposition of bismuth nanoparticles onto the GF electrode surface synchronously by using an electrolyte solution containing Bi3+.78 As observed in Fig. 17a, the Bi nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the GF electrode surface, which facilitates a sluggish V3+/V2+ redox reaction rather than the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction (Fig. 17b). Owing to the fast charge transfer process, the GF modified with Bi nanoparticles demonstrated an energy efficiency of 11% more efficient than that of the bare GF electrode at a high current density of 150 mA cm−2.

Recently, Wei et al.117 reported the electrodeposition of copper nanoparticles on the GF surface, in which the copper catalyst enables an improvement in the electrochemical kinetics of the V3+/V2+ redox reaction. As shown in Fig. 18a and b, a tiny and optimized amount of Cu salt was introduced into the electrolyte. The Cu nanoparticles were then synchronously electrodeposited onto the electrode surface during the charging process, which yields a battery energy efficiency of 80.1% at a higher current density of 300 mA cm−2. Moreover, upon introducing the optimum amount of Cu2+, the electrochemical activity towards the V3+/V2+ redox reaction shows improvement but does not influence the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple (Fig. 18c). This can be endorsed because the Cu metal will be oxidized to Cu2+ ions before the oxidation of VO2+ to VO2+ and then electrodeposited onto the electrode before the reduction of V3+ to V2+. During operation, on the positive side, Cu remains as Cu2+ ions. In contrast, on the negative side, Cu is present as Cu metal on the GF surface, indicating that Cu metal instead of Cu2+ ions has a catalytic effect towards the V3+/V2+ redox reaction; however, as reported previously, the deposition of Cu on the surface of GF might limit the amount of energy that can be stored and the cycle life of the battery system.17,18

In general, the electrodeposition and thermal decomposition routes are simple and allow a homogeneous distribution of metal nanoparticles on the GF surface. However, because of the weak adhesion between the metal nanoparticles and the GF, the active materials leached out from the surface during the long term cycling performance test. To overcome these drawbacks, Blasi et al. reported the synthesis of Ni nanoparticles embedded into the carbon nanofibers (Ni/CNF) using the electrospinning method.118 The composite electrode (Ni/CNF) was fabricated by mixing nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(OCOCH3)2·4H2O) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as metal and carbon sources, respectively, via an electrospinning system. Besides, nickel species are grown directly and distributed along the CNF to improve the electrical conductivity of the CNF and provide an appropriate surface polarity with an increase in carbon surface wettability and thus better electrolyte accessibility at the electrode surface for improving the kinetic reaction at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Moreover, the presence of embedded Ni nanoparticles produces a porous structure in the carbon nanofibers (i.e., increasing specific surface area). More importantly, the strong interaction between the two species enables the composite electrode to withstand harsh environments during the cycling stability test.
Following Blasi et al.'s study, Mehboob et al. investigated the performance of tin (Sn) nanoparticles deposited on CF using different Sn ion concentrations in the solution.119 As seen in Fig. 19a, the reduction potentials for Sn4+/Sn2+ and Sn2+/Sn redox couples are 0.15 V and −0.13 V, respectively, versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). This can be used as an in situ deposition on CF during the flow battery operation. Fig. 19b and c reveal the CV curves and EIS spectra of the V3+/V2+ redox couple in 1.5 M V3+/3 M H2SO4 in the presence of Sn2+ ions. It can be noticed that in the presence of Sn2+ ions in the solution, the cathodic peak substantially increases owing to the fact that the cathodic peak related to tin deposition aligns closely with the reduction peak of V3+/V2+. Furthermore, the catalytic performance of Sn2+ ions towards the VO2+/VO2+ reaction was less significant than towards V3+/V2+. This could be because Sn dissolves back into the solution before the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction and cannot modify the electrode. The charge–discharge performance test was performed using the CF and the solution containing Sn2+ ions on both the catholyte and anolyte sides. The addition of the optimum amount of Sn2+ ions (0.01 M) resulted in improved cell performance, especially at higher current density (Fig. 19d and e).

To sum up, modification of carbon electrodes with metal electrocatalysts has been achieved by several methods including impregnation, electrodeposition, and direct addition of metal ions into the VRFB electrolyte. Each method has its own merits and limitations. The hydrophilicity, electrical conductivity, and reaction sites of GF can be substantially improved by introducing metals. The oxygen functional groups can be added at the same time as the introduction of metal catalysts. Oxygen-containing functional groups can improve the stability of metals and have a synergistic effect with metals. Despite having good electrocatalytic activities and high stability in highly acidic environments, noble metal catalysts have high-cost and serious hydrogen evolution side reactions which limit their practical applications. In order to meet the sustainable development of VRFBs, catalysts with low-cost should be given priority in GF electrode modification. Hence, as aforementioned, several researchers have been looking for easily available and inexpensive metal-based catalysts like bismuth. Although bismuth exhibits an outstanding electrocatalytic performance for V2+/V3+, it has no electrocatalytic activity for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction, leading to reduction in the overall performance of the battery. In general, it is inspiring to develop high-performance electrocatalyst-modified GF/CF electrode materials, which are easy to produce on an industrial scale, to improve the efficiency of all VRFBs and to make VRFBs more commercially competitive. Further investigations on the role of metal electrocatalyst particle size and distribution in improving the efficiency of the battery would be needed.
3.4. Metal oxide-based electrocatalysts

3.4.1. Inert transition metal oxide-based electrocatalysts. 
Although noble metals can enhance the GF electrode's performance by increasing the electrocatalytic activity and reducing the overall potential, these approaches are not practical because of high cost, poor mechanical stability, and being too sensitive to undesirable oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. As shown in Fig. 20, developing advanced metal oxide catalysts with high catalytic activity, acid-resistance, and low cost is vital.
 Fig. 20  (a) The standard potential (versus the standard hydrogen electrode) of redox couples and (b) parts of the periodic table of the elements showing that metal oxides prepared from metals circled in blue color can satisfy all the best criteria for the VRFB electrode. 
Furthermore, an effective synthesis technique to introduce the catalyst onto the surface of GF must be developed. In this regard, many researchers are devoted to finding rationally designed low-cost metal oxides as electrocatalysts to replace precious metals. Transition metal oxides can be used as electrocatalysts because of their abilities to change their valence states and to adsorb reactive species as the active center. The first work using metal oxides as electrocatalysts for VRFBs was reported by Skyllas-Kazacos et al. They used iridium oxide on a titanium electrode known as the dimensionally stable anode (DSA).24 Onwards, Kim et al. reported the use of Mn3O4 nanoparticles as a catalyst to replace novel metals.44 The composite electrode has been synthesized by inserting CF into the manganese acetate solution ((C2H3O2)2Mn4H2O) using a Teflon-lined autoclave to proceed with a hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 21a). After the hydrothermal reaction was completed, the as-prepared electrode was heat-treated at 500 °C for 5 h under an Ar atmosphere to enhance the adhesion between CF and Mn3O4. The obtained result confirmed that the Mn3O4 nanoparticles with a few hundreds of nanometers in size were successfully introduced onto the CF surface (Fig. 21b–d). As demonstrated by CV, the CF electrode's redox reactivity was significantly improved in both the catholyte and anolyte after the decoration of Mn3O4 (Fig. 21e). Mn3O4 modified CF's energy efficiency in the flow cell was around 75% at a current density of 40 mA cm−2. As revealed in the paper, after the hydrothermal reaction, the prepared electrode was heat-treated at 500 °C for 5 h under an Ar atmosphere to enhance the adhesion between CF and Mn3O4. This work's main limitation is that the battery's long-term cyclic performance test is still under question.

Metal oxides can also be introduced onto the GF surface using the pulse electrodeposition method for the VRFB application. For example, Wu et al. reported a new approach in which lead dioxide (PbO2) was prepared through the pulse electrodeposition method on the surface of GF.46 The use of Pb ions in the electrolyte solution was also reported by Skyllas-Kazacos et al.116 In this case, Pb ions from the solution deposited as PbO2 on the positive electrode during cycling to catalyze the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. The GF electrodes modified by PbO2 using pulse electrodeposition is composed of a mixture of orthorhombic α and tetragonal β-PbO2 crystallographic phases. Compared to the electrochemical deposition method, the pulse electrodeposition technique has the following advantages: (1) the distribution of coating is uniform and dense, (2) high deposition rates, and (3) possible to do electrodeposition using a small pulse current (Fig. 22b).

As shown in the CV curves (Fig. 22c), compared to the bare GF, the GF electrode loaded with PbO2 shows an improvement in both cathodic and anodic current densities for a VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. The decoration of PbO2 causes a decrease in the charge-transfer resistance reflecting an enhanced charge transfer process in the electrolyte/electrode interface (Fig. 22d). Owing to the fact that the catalysis of PbO2 reduced the electrochemical polarization of the redox reaction, the single-cell performance of the modified electrode shows a low charge voltage plateau and high discharge voltage plateau, thereby achieving higher voltage efficiency.
Yang et al. also demonstrated the positive effects of NiO nanoparticles decorated on the surface of GF using the impregnation and annealing process.120 As shown in Fig. 23a, the decoration of NiO nanoparticles on the GF surface takes place in a two-step process. The precursor layer was first evenly distributed on the GF surface using a simple immersion method and then converted into NiO/GF by annealing with different temperature ranges. At temperatures greater than 300 °C, uniformly sized NiO nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the GF surface at 600 °C; NiO underwent reduction to metallic nickel via reaction with carbon within GF, generating CO2 and CO (Fig. 23b and c). Therefore, they developed an optimal electrode (NiO/GF300) by controlling the precursor concentration and heat-treatment temperature. Compared to the bare GF electrode, the proposed electrode showed a notable improvement in both V2+/V3+ and VO2+/VO2+ redox reactions (Fig. 23d). Besides, NiO/GF300 exhibited a higher EE (74.5%) at a current rate (125 mA cm−2) than GF without the catalyst (55.4%). Although there is a clear improvement in electrochemical activity, the catalyst stability in the highly concentrated and flowing acidic solution is still unclear. Recently, Xiang et al. studied the deposition of cobalt oxide (CoO) on the GF surface using impregnation in conjunction with the ultrasonication and calcination method.50 As shown in Fig. 24a and b, a rough and thin layer of CoO is uniformly coated on the surface of the carbon fibers. The CV and EIS results reveal that the CoO modified GF electrode exhibits an improvement in electrocatalytic activity and reversibility toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction (Fig. 24c and d). The introduction of oxygen-functional groups during annealing in air and the improved wettability result in a more active surface and contribute to the enhancement in electrochemical performance. The energy efficiency (EE) and discharge capacity (DC) of the cell employing the modified electrode are 69.4% and 373.9 mA h at 150 mA cm−2, respectively, which are 12.7% and 101.7% higher than those of a cell employing pristine GF (Fig. 24e and f).

A similar advancement was also reported by Zhou et al. using the simple immersion–precipitation approach.47,48 They found that the uniform immobilization of CeO2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles on the GF surface not only promoted the accessibility of vanadium electrolyte but also provided more active sites for the redox reactions, thereby resulting in better electrochemical activity and reversibility toward the VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ redox reactions compared with those of pristine GFs. Furthermore, electrodes containing metal oxides such as Cr2O3, TiNb2O7, MoO2, WO3, and Ta2O5 have been reported to enhance the kinetic rates towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction.1,45,49,51,121,122,140 TiO2 can improve the reaction rate towards V3+/V2+.51 At the same time, Nd2O3 and SnO2 have been reported to improve the electrocatalytic activity toward both VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox reactions123,124 (see the detailed summary of metal oxide-based catalysts for VRFBs in Table 2).
In general, transition metal oxide electrocatalysts have been commonly employed to modify GF/CF electrodes. The anionic and cationic groups existing on the lattice surface of metal oxide can act as base or acid sites that accept or donate protons, which enhance the interactions with the polar molecules. The cations of transition metal oxides have numerous oxidation states, which undergo redox reactions and create anionic and cationic vacancies. These properties of transition metal oxides make them attractive for use as electrocatalysts for VRFB electrode modification. Moreover, compared with metal-based catalysts, metal oxides are relatively stable even in oxygen-evolving environments, cheap, highly wettable, and easily available, which are critically important for scale-up at the industry level. Despite the fact that the introduction of inert transition metal oxides improved the electrochemical activity towards the vanadium redox reactions, their performance was limited by their low conductivity, low surface area, and weak interaction with the GF electrode. Moreover, the performance enhancement depends on nano-size, distribution uniformity, and the preparation of nanostructured electrocatalysts. In this regard, it is essential to design advanced catalysts with high catalytic activity, high conductivity, and low cost for practical application in VRFBs. The problem of low surface area and conductivity of transition metal oxides can be solved by forming conductive layers, doping heteroatoms, and blending with conductive carbon materials, such as graphene or carbon nanotubes, which will be discussed in detail in the next sections.


3.4.2. Improving metal oxide activities by the formation of conductive layers. 
In recent years, transition metal nitrides, carbides, and carbonitrides have attracted increasing attention due to their remarkable properties such as exceptional physical and chemical stability, strong corrosion-resistance, and high hardness.5,126–128 The conductivity and catalytic activity of these types of catalysts are comparable to those of metals. Wei et al.126 synthesized free-standing TiN nanowires grown on the GF surface by a two-step approach (Fig. 25a–d). TiO2 nanowires were first grown on the GF through a seed-assisted hydrothermal method. Then, the samples were thermally annealed in the presence of ammonia gas at various temperatures of 700, 800, and 900 °C to obtain TiN nanowire decorated GF (Fig. 25e–g). The morphology of the original TiO2 nanowires was well preserved at a temperature below 800 °C. However, when further raising the heating temperature to 900 °C, the original nanostructure was severely damaged, detached, and collapsed from the GF surface. Therefore, the optimum nitridation temperature with better catalytic activity, large surface area, and stability is set to be 800 °C. When the prepared catalyst was applied in flow batteries, the TiN nanoparticle modified GF electrode improved the energy efficiency of a VRFB by facilitating a sluggish V3+/V2+ redox kinetics reaction and enlarged active sites (Fig. 25h). The electrode enables an electrolyte utilization and energy efficiency of 73.9% and 77.4%, respectively, at the current density of 300 mA cm−2.

Ghimire et al.127 also studied the preparation of TiC particles on the CF surface using titanium tetrafluoride (TiF4) as the titanium source. This approach involves the hydrothermal conversion of a TiF4 precursor adsorbed onto carbon fiber surfaces to TiO2, followed by a carbothermal reduction of TiO2 particles to TiC (Fig. 26a). The uniformly distributed TiC particles on the CF surface accelerate the charge transfer kinetics of the sluggish negative redox couple (V2+/V3+) (Fig. 26b and c). In contrast to pristine GF, the TiC–GF composite electrode has high oxidation and reduction currents and lower peak potential separation (ΔEp), reflecting the electrode's better reversibility towards the V2+/V3+ redox couple (Fig. 26d and e). Hence, the improved electrochemical properties of the TiC–GF can be attributed to the presence of electronically conductive and catalytically active nanoparticles. Moreover, the nanometer-sized particles generate a higher surface area. As a result, VRFB cells using TiC–GF negative electrodes revealed improved energy efficiency and capacity retention.

Although the catalytic activity of metal alloys and electrical conductivity (metal nitrides and metal carbides) are comparable with those of metals, long experimental time and high treatment temperature limit the active surface area, and reduce the accessibility and uniform distribution of the electrolyte on the electrode surface. To solve these challenges, Lee et al. investigated the use of mesoporous tungsten oxynitride (m-WON) as the catalyst for VRFBs.128 m-WON was synthesized by dissolving the precursor of tungsten with the mesoporous silica template (KIT-6)/ethanol solution followed by heat treatment in the presence of ammonia gas at 700 °C (Fig. 27a). The prepared m-WON electrode reveals relatively high catalytic activity towards the V2+/V3+ redox reaction, whereas there is little activity in the potential ranges for a VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. Regarding charge–discharge performance, the VRFB single-cell employing m-WON demonstrates high VE and EE, high specific capacity, and low capacity loss rate. The reasons for the enhancement of the performance of the electrode are as follows: (1) its surficial tungsten-oxygen (W6+ = O) and tungsten-oxynitride (W3+–N–O) bonds promoted the V2+/V3+ redox reaction; (2) the energy bandgap is reduced by the adoption of the W–N bond, making the m-WON closer to the metallic structure; (3) the surficial oxygen atoms that are formed on the oxidized layer resulted in greater electronegativity which also promoted the V2+/V3+ redox reaction; and (4) the observed porous structure and the increase in the surface area provide more surface electroactive sites.

The conductivity and the electrochemical activity of metal oxides can also be improved by introducing oxygen vacancies in their lattice structure. For instance, Vázquez-Galván et al.55 revealed the synthesis of hydrogen treated TiO2 (TiO2:H) nanorods directly grown on the GF surface as a negative electrode for VRFBs using the hydrothermal process (Fig. 28a). Thermal treatment in the Ar atmosphere at 500°C for 4 h was applied to the sample, showing the original white color, TiO2/GF. On the other hand, TiO2:H/GF was obtained when the sample was annealed in the presence of 5% H2 in the Ar atmosphere. In this case, the sample color changed to blue after hydrogen thermal treatment, indicating a change in the metal oxide's electronic configuration due to the partial reduction of the metal oxide. The TiO2:H/GF electrode can inhibit the HER, which is a critical barrier for operating at a high rate for long-term cycling in VRFBs. The improvements caused by hydrogen treatment lead not only to an enhancement of the electrochemical effectiveness in the charge transfer from the TiO2 layer to the electrolyte owing to the introduction of several defects in the crystal structure but also complete inhibition of the HER on the negative electrode of the battery (Fig. 28b and c). The above results can be further explained thermodynamically by a highly negative Gibbs free energy of the intermediate hydride state (ΔGH*), indicating highly energetic adsorption of the atomic hydrogen on the TiO2 site. From the volcano-type relationship (Fig. 28d), the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of the intermediate hydride state is obtained (70 kcal mol−1). This HBE value is high, leading to slow desorption in successive steps and, in consequence, reducing the HER rate (jo). The optimal value of DGH* should be zero (i.e., ΔGptH* ∼ 0.09 eV), which corresponds to the highest HER rate (as for the well-known and highly efficient Pt catalyst) (Fig. 28e). Despite the improvements in electrochemical activity for TiO2 using H2/Ar treatment, the oxygen vacancy formation mechanism and the role of oxygen-containing functional groups on the GF surface still need further investigation.

Recently, our research group54 presented a novel approach to synthesize substoichiometric composition forms of tungsten oxide W18O49 through a one-step solvothermal route using the heat-treated GF as the support, WCl6 as the precursor, and ethanol as the solvent. The overall formation process of the composite electrode is illustrated in Fig. 29a. The CV and EIS studies revealed that W18O49 nanowires on the GF surface exhibit electrocatalytic effects towards the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple on the positive side. The W18O49 modified GF's electrochemical performance was further improved by thermally annealing the sample with a controlled amount of H2/Ar atmosphere to form an oxygen-vacancy-rich hydrogen-treated electrode material. When used as an electrode in a VRFB single cell, this material demonstrated performance improvements with 9.1% and 12.5% higher energy efficiency than cells assembled with W18O49 nanowires and treated GF, respectively, at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. The possible reason for the performance improvement in W18O49 modified GF is that, unlike the WO3, the crystal structure of W18O49 consists of an infinite number of stacked corner-sharing WO6 octahedral layers, and it has a unique crystal structure offering oxygen-rich vacancies that lead to the formation of hexagonal channels (Fig. 29b).129 Furthermore, the presence of oxygen vacancies on H-treated W18O49 increases the conductivity, providing active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ redox couple.

3.4.3. Improving metal oxide activities using doping heteroatoms. 
Another way of improving the GF electrode performance is the doping of metals into transition metal oxides. For the first time, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) research group11 developed W-doped Nb2O5 nanorods as electrocatalysts for VRFBs. The monoclinic phase Nb2O5 nanorods were prepared using the hydrothermal method and deposited on the surface of GF (Fig. 30a). The addition of water-soluble (NH4)10W12O41·H2O precursor facilitates the precipitation of nanorods in the form of W-doped Nb2O5, which limits their agglomeration. It, therefore, enables a high loading ratio of the electrocatalysts (Fig. 30b–e). The CV curves confirmed that the prepared electrode has catalytic effects toward redox couples of VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ to facilitate the vanadium redox's electrochemical kinetic reactions.

The optimized W-doped Nb2O5 nanorods decorated on the GF electrode show an energy efficiency enhancement of ∼10.7% at the current density of 150 mA cm−2 as compared with the one without catalysts. Our RFB research group53 also deeply evaluated the role of the Nb-dopant in the main lattice of hexagonal WO3 nanowires (Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs). The Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GFs were synthesized through a hydrothermal method by dissolving appropriate amounts of the precursor solutions with the Nb/W atomic ratios to 0, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.06 (Fig. 30f). Fig. 30i and j show the TEM images of undoped h-WO3 NWs and Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs with the corresponding d-spacing values of 0.388 nm 0.392 nm, respectively. The lattice fringes of Nb-doped h-WO3 NWs were slightly distorted, indicating that the growth of h-WO3 NWs along the (001) direction was inhibited. This is due to incorporating Nb5+ into the WO3 framework, which causes lattice distortion, inducing more defects that can provide active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction on the GF surface. The energy efficiency (EE) of a VRFB that employed Nb-doped h-WO3 NW-modified GF (Nb/W = 0.03) as a catalyst was enhanced by boosting the chemical conversion of the electroactive species.
Recently, Mehboob et al.124 reported the decoration of SnO2 nanoparticles on the surface of carbon felt through a hydrothermal approach and studied the catalytic effect of SnO2 on the VRFB performance. Notably, the VRFB electrode decorated with SnO2 nanoparticles exhibited stable performance, showing an energy efficiency of 77.3% at a current density of 150 mA cm−2. The influence of doping metal oxides using the heteroatom further confirmed by Lv et al.134 They reported that the low electronic conductivity of SnO2 limits its electrocatalytic activity toward the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction. Hence, they doped different amounts of antimony (Sb) in SnO2, leading to higher electronic conductivity than SnO2 nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 31c and d, the Sb ratio in SnO2 adjusts the catalysts' electronic conductivity, and the electronic conductivity shows a positive correlation with the electrocatalytic activity.

Among the Sb doped SnO2 (ATO) catalysts, the optimized doping level (ATO-9) possesses the highest electronic conductivity, leading to the best electrocatalytic activity. The improved electronic conductivity and negative charge on the surface of ATO by doping Sb(V) promote fast electron transfer and adsorption between the electrode and vanadium ions. As a result, the cell assembled with the ATO-9-GF electrode exhibits higher EE (73.09%) than that of the cell constructed with pristine GF (61.00%) or SnO2-GF (65.47%) at 300 mA cm−2 (Fig. 31e). Following this work, Li et al. investigated the creation of oxygen vacancy and size controlling strategies for chromium doping (Cr) in SnO2 using the sol–gel process and high-temperature calcination.135 The Cr doping reduces the particle size of SnO2 and increases oxygen vacancies in the crystal structure of SnO2 nanoparticles. Due to the formation of more active sites and enhanced conductivity, the optimum amount of Cr doping on SnO2 displays better electrochemical performance towards VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox reactions than the un-doped SnO2 or other doped samples.
The conductivity of inert and non-defective metal oxides can be improved using binary metal oxide formation. As we discussed in Section 3.4.1, Xiang et al. and Yang et al. reported the deposition of CoO and NiO metal oxides, respectively, on the GF surface to improve the electrochemical performance of GF. Due to inert metal oxides' low conductivity nature, their electrochemical activity and utilization for capacitive performance are limited in both cases. This challenge has been solved by Xiang et al. by mixing the precursor of the two metal oxides (CoO and NiO) to obtain the binary nickel cobalt oxide (NiCoO2) and used to modify the surface of GF as a positive electrode for VRFBs.136 The promoted in wettability (Fig. 32a and b) and an enhancement in the conductivity of NiCoO2 deposition on GF can contribute to the modified GF electrode's improved electrochemical activity of the VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction (Fig. 32f and g). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 32c–e, the uniform distribution of NiCoO2 nanoparticles on the GF surface and the porous structure created by NiCoO2 nanoparticles can enhance the cell performance of the electrode. The cell employed NiCoO2/GF exhibited an EE and discharge capacity of 72.5% and 469.4 mA h, respectively, while that of the cell operating with GF is 57.0% and 185.4 mA h, respectively, at the current density of 150 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the NiCoO2/GF electrode's cell performance is better than that of the individual CoO-GF and NiO-GF-based electrodes.

3.4.4. Improving metal oxide activities by blending with carbon-based materials. 
There are two main approaches to improve the performance of electrodes for VRFBs: (1) improving the electrocatalytic activity (this method is commonly studied and mentioned above) and (2) improving the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) using porous materials (this method has given little attention). Owing to the low specific surface area of GF and CF (0.1–1.0 m2 g−1) compared to porous carbon materials (higher than 1000 m2 g−1), it is crucial to increase the ECSA of the electrode and hence the performance of the VRFB by incorporating them as electrode materials.38,125 Although carbon-based materials including rGO, GO, MWCNTs, and SWCNTs have the above merits, they exhibit hydrophobic characteristics, which have detrimental effects on the wettability of the electrode in the aqueous solution.125 In general, as shown in Fig. 33, improving the wettability, decreasing the wire diameter, and the decoration of nano-sized particles will increase the ECSA of the electrode.137–139 Therefore, the improvement in the performance of the composite electrode immobilized CNFs, CNTs, GO, and metal oxide nanoparticles might be ascribed to the coupling effect of enhancing electrocatalytic activity and the increase of ECSA.
 Fig. 33  The schematic diagram showing (a) the surface property of rGO before and after decoration with metal oxides making the composite material highly hydrophilic, and (b) the presence of rGO makes the metal oxide nanoparticles anchored between the rGO sheets; simultaneously, the rGO sheets are separated using the nanoparticles, which prevents the aggregation of metal oxides and stacking of the rGO nanosheets. 
Jing et al. investigated the influence of incorporating CeO2 nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) using the electrospinning technique and the subsequent carbonization process.125 The physicochemical characterization experiments which correspond to wettability are much improved after the incorporation of CeO2 nanoparticles. It is worth noting that the ECSA of CeO2/ECNFs calculated according to eqn (6) and the ECSA value of the composite electrode (CeO2/ECNFs) are four times higher than that of ECNFs. Accordingly, the electrochemical results show that the incorporation of CeO2 improves the electrocatalytic activity toward the V2+/V3+ redox reaction to some extent while it is less effective toward the VO2+/VO2+ reaction. The improvement in the electrochemical performance of CeO2/ECNFs might be mostly ascribed to the remarkable enhancement in ECSA. (6)where SECSA is the electrochemical surface area (m2 g−1), i means the response current (A), t corresponds to the settling time when the response current keeps unchanged (s), m refers to the mass of the electrode (g), η stands for the amplitude of the potential step (V), and the unit-area capacitance is calculated to be 20 μF cm−2.69 Titanium dioxide deposited onto carbon black (TiO2/C) was also reported by Tseng et al. to evaluate the composite material's catalytic activity towards V2+/V3+ redox reactions.137 Carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) has a high specific surface area; however, owing to its hydrophobic surface and inaccessible property, TiO2 nanoparticles were deposited to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the composite material on the negative side. Thus, they used TiO2 to change the surface into a highly hydrophilic surface to produce high wettability of the catalyst layer. Moreover, the presence of TiO2 suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction on the surface of CF.
Similarly, the electrocatalyst development to exploit its interaction with the support is becoming an emerging and promising trend in VRFBs. For instance, Ejigu et al.2 studied the synergistic catalyst-support interactions in a nitrogen-doped reduced-graphene oxide/Mn3O4 (N-rGO–Mn3O4) composite electrocatalyst for the VO2+/VO2+ redox process. As shown in Fig. 34a–c, in the absence of rGO, the Mn3O4 nanoparticles become aggregated. Without Mn3O4, the rGO nanosheets are stacked, whereas well dispersed Mn3O4 nanoparticles are formed on the N-rGO sheets during the reduction/co-deposition process. The electrochemical analysis shows that the composite material's electrocatalytic activity is significantly higher than those of the individual components due to synergism between the Mn3O4 nanoparticles and the carbonaceous support material (N-rGO).

Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 34d and e, electrocatalysis of the redox reaction is most effective when nitrogen is present within the support framework, demonstrating that the metal–nitrogen–carbon (Mn–N–C) coupling is the key to the enhancement of this electrocatalytic composite for VO2+/VO2+ electrochemistry. Although the CV and EIS tests revealed the enhancement in the catalyst's electrocatalytic activity towards VO2+/VO2+, there is no single cell performance test in the report.2 Our RFB research group3 also studied the synergistic effects between the titanium niobium oxide (TiNb2O7) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which has been synthesized using the dispersion and annealing process.
The TiNb2O7 nanoparticles are uniformly anchored between the rGO sheets; the rGO sheets are separated using TiNb2O7 nanoparticles (Fig. 35a–c). The synergistic effects between them prevent the aggregation of the nanoparticles and the restacking of the rGO sheets. The catalytic activity of the TiNb2O7–rGO composite electrocatalyst toward VO2+/VO2+ (positive side) and V3+/V2+ (negative side) is higher than those of either TiNb2O7 or rGO separately (Fig. 35d and e). The enhancement in activity originated from the high electronic conductivity of the rGO nanosheets and the interfacial effect within the layered structure between TiNb2O7 and rGO, including a large surface area and high oxygen vacancy concentration, favoring the redox reaction for vanadium ions. Accordingly, the EE of the cells assembled using the TiNb2O7–rGO-modified GF electrode achieves an optimum performance of 83.1% and 79.7% at the current densities of 80 and 120 mA cm−2, respectively. This improvement surpasses ∼11.3% and 12.34% EE increases at the same current densities, respectively, of the cell assembled using GF. The same group57 also studied the influence of annealing on the performance of VRFBs. As shown in Fig. 36a, the catalyst was prepared by an in situ self-assembly of graphene sheets using mild chemical reduction, followed by freeze-drying and annealing to obtain the 3D annealed WO3 NWs/GS foam to be used in both negative and positive electrodes of a VRFB. Unlike the 3D WO3 NWs/GS foam, in the annealed sample (3D annealed WO3 NWs/GS foam), the WO3 nanowires are homogeneously dispersed on the surface of a continuous 3D porous network consisting of ultrathin crumpled graphene sheets. Moreover, the 3D annealed WO3 NWs/GS foam exhibits a 3D hierarchical porous structure, which can provide more surface electroactive sites to improve the electrochemical performance of VRFBs (Fig. 36b and c). Similarly, after annealing, we found that the formation of new W–O–C bonds between WO3 NWs and the graphene sheets is essential for the synergistic effect that facilitates the redox reactions of the vanadium redox pairs (Fig. 36d and e). As a result, the 3D annealed WO3 NWs/GS foam exhibits the highest reversibility and electrocatalytic activity toward the V2+/V3+ and VO2+/VO2+ redox couples among all the tested samples (Fig. 36f). Consequently, the VRFB cell using the 3D annealed WO3 NWs/GS foam-modified graphite felt electrode demonstrates an EE of 79.49% at a current density of 80 mA cm−2. This EE exceeds those of cells assembled with pristine GF (12.75%) and 3D WO3 NWs/GS foam-modified GF electrodes (3.79%).

In conclusion, to develop a high-performance electrode, it is beneficial to fabricate nanocomposite electrocatalysts such as metal oxide/rGO, metal oxide/CNT, etc., and then anchor them on the GF/CF electrodes because graphene CNTs and rGO have high porosity and good conductivity compared with non-precious metal oxide alone, which can increase the overall electrode surface area. Despite the fact that the presence of carbon materials with metal oxides improves the ECSA, the conductivity, and wettability of the composite materials, an enhancement in the electrochemical activity towards the vanadium ion, growing metal oxides on the surface of carbon materials such as graphene, CNTs, rGO and applying for VRFBs are still challenging. The adhesion between the nanocomposite electrocatalyst and GF/CF is also still in question. There are only a few studies in the literature that have been reported previously for VRFBs.

4. Conclusion and future perspectives
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are considered one of the most promising large-scale energy storage technologies because of their flexible design, high safety, and long cycle life. However, the high production cost and relatively low energy efficiency of VRFBs still limit their practicability. Further efforts to reduce the production cost and improve the performance of VRFBs should, therefore, be considered. Developing highly active electrocatalysts and electrode materials with low prices is crucial in VRFB design. This review article has reviewed the recent advancements of numerous electrode modification methods for VRFB applications. We have broadly categorized the modification methods of electrode materials into three main classes: using carbon materials, metal oxide-based materials, and metal oxide/carbon composite materials.
The electrode is a crucial component of the VRFB, as that provides active surface sites on which the respective electrochemical reactions occur. The typical electrode materials are currently carbonaceous materials such as CP, GF, CC, and graphite powder. Owing to their best characteristics such as porous 3D network structure, low cost, chemical and mechanical stability, and corrosion resistance in acidic solutions, these materials will continue to form the basis of electrode materials for the VRFB. However, their high graphitization temperature, hydrophobic nature, low surface area, insufficient surface active sites, and poor electrolyte accessibility result in poor kinetic reversibility and electrochemical activity. Hence, attempts have been made to modify these materials to improve their electrochemical activities. Effective treatment methods have been suggested to improve the electrochemical properties of GFs in VRFBs; these methods include:
(1) Most surface treatment approaches can introduce surface functional groups, commonly oxygen and nitrogen, onto the carbon electrode surface. This leads to an increase in the redox reaction activity and wettability because of increasing the concentration of surface-active functional groups. Among the various surface modification methods: thermal, plasma, and microwave treatment, etching the surface with corrosive chemicals such as strong alkaline and solution, corona discharge, or the combination of them were extensively studied. These treatment methods can remove impurities from the surface, introduce surface functional groups, and improve the carbon materials' surface roughness. Although there is an enhancement in electrochemical activity, such methods are unsuitable for VRFBs because of their low operational lifespan. To avoid surface damage by the corrosive nature of oxidative chemicals, the concentration and amount of chemicals should be considered. Furthermore, the surface roughness, the amount, and type of surface functional groups should be controlled and studied in the future.
(2) With the rapid development of carbon-based nanomaterials such as GO, rGO, graphene, and CNTs, there has been an increase in interest in using these materials for VRFBs. The mentioned electrode materials are attractive due to their high surface areas, good electrical conductivity, and relative inertness. Such materials are available in diverse forms, ranging from isolated particles to monolithic foam and felt structures. Besides, it has been discovered that several surface treatment methods may improve reaction kinetics on carbon electrodes. Chemical etching, thermal treatment, chemical doping, acid treatment, and atom doping onto carbon fibers have all been reported. Despite an improvement in electrochemical activities with electrodes modified by the above materials, the poor cycling stability of the modified carbon electrodes and the loss of their initial activity after the number of charging/discharging cycles are still challenging for long-term operation in practical VRFB systems. The trade-off between physicochemical properties such as electrical conductivity, surface area, hydrophilicity, and electrocatalytic activity should be considered during selection to optimize the electrochemical performance of carbon-based felt materials and designing a high-efficiency carbon-based felt material for VRFBs. Furthermore, the mechanism of incorporating carbon-based materials on the surface of the support (i.e., GF or CF) remains unclear.
(3) The introduction of electrocatalysts on the GF surface is another effective way to reduce the reaction overpotential of vanadium ion redox couples. Metal oxide decoration is an alternative method for improving the electrochemical activity of carbon electrodes in VRFBs. Despite the fact that the introduction of inert metal oxides improved the electrochemical activity towards vanadium ions, their performances are limited by their low conductivities. Most of them don't possess electrocatalytic activity toward both VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples. In most cases, in cooperation with oxygen-functional groups, they could act as active sites and catalyze the vanadium redox reactions indirectly. Moreover, the nanostructured electrocatalysts' performance enhancement is determined by the nano-size, distribution uniformity, and preparation process; metal oxide nanoparticles are easily aggregated and hence exposed few active sites. In this regard, it is essential to design advanced catalysts with high catalytic activity, high conductivity, and low cost for practical application in VRFBs. Hence, the following important factors should be considered when designing a plan for future research on high power density VRFB systems:
(i) Inert metal oxides' conductivity can be improved by doping or creating defect rich structures on the electrode surface. Doping with the optimal amount of foreign metal atoms on metal oxides and partial treatment of the metal oxide surface with hydrogen produce moderate defect states, thereby creating structural disorders, such as oxygen vacancies, which leads to the generation of more active sites for the VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox reactions on the electrode. In this case, it is highly recommended that extensive research is performed on the dopant level, structural defect formation on the host material, and mechanism of adsorption/desorption of vanadium ion on the surface of the electrode, which would be an efficient way to study using mathematic modeling and simulation for VRFBs.
(ii) The other approach to improving metal oxide-based VRFB electrodes' performance is blending metal oxides with carbon nanomaterials such as rGO, GO, CNTs, and graphene. Although these carbon materials have essential characteristics, they show low hydrophilic features and poor electrolyte accessibility. Therefore, blending porous carbon materials with metal oxides could improve the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode. Furthermore, the coupling effect between metal oxides and carbon materials may enhance electrocatalytic activity and increase the composite material's electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Although this method can accelerate and improve the V2+/V3+ and VO2+/VO2+ redox reactions, achieving their application without any performance fading will be a significant challenge for long-term operation in practical VRFB systems. Thus, it is critical to design novel binder systems that can provide robust, low-resistance, and continuous internal pathways to connect in all carbon electrode regions. Future study should also be focused on cost-effective, scalable in situ synthesis and processing methods of metal oxide/carbon composites on graphite felt electrodes. On the other hand, to further identify stability problems, it is essential to study and characterize the electrode's microstructure before and after the stability test and analyze the change in morphology of the electrocatalyst on the surface of the electrode. Finally, it is also essential to further investigate the optimized combination between the electrocatalyst and supporting materials to improve the electrode's electrochemical performance further.
