    , Accepted 1st February 2023First published on 2nd February 2023AbstractThe photoelectric conversion efficiency of CsSnBr3 solar cells only reached 3.04% due to the insufficient separation of photogenerated charge and the short lifetime of the carriers. Herein, interfacial electronic properties and photovoltaic performance of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure without and with Bromine vacancy defects are studied using a hybrid density functional method. We find that strong coupling and hybridization of interfacial electronic states in the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure can lead to a narrowing band gap, which induces excellent optical absorption. Bromine vacancies are introduced into the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure to provide more electrons and modulate its physicochemical properties. Excitingly, the charge transfer forms a stronger built-in electric field in the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, which can effectively promote the charge transfer between VBr-CsSnBr3 (001) and the SnS2 monolayer complying with a Z-scheme pathway. The coupling interface and vacancy defects improve the photovoltaic performance of CsSnBr3. This study offers a novel design idea for CsSnBr3-based perovskite materials in photovoltaic applications.
1. Introduction
The conversion of solar energy into electricity is one of the most important technologies to solve the environmental pollution of coal and the depletion of fossil fuels.1–3 The core of this technology is exploring and developing all kinds of semiconductor photovoltaic materials, which take solar energy as a driving force.4 Pb-based organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) originate from the dye-sensitized solar cells.5 Its power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased from 3.8% in 2009 (ref. 6) to 25.7% in 2022.7 Although Pb-based PSCs have achieved rapid development, the toxicity of lead and the high volatility of organic components under humidity and oxygen (MA = CH3NH3+, FA = CH(NH2)2+) limit its industrialization.8,9
In the past few years, all-inorganic perovskite materials have attracted widespread attention for being non-toxic,10 low cost,11 and having unique electronic structures among the family of perovskites. The cubic CsSnBr3 (space group Pmm (#221))12 perovskite material has a high optical response,13 tunable direct band gap, and is environmentally friendly.14 It has a wide range of applications in solar cells,15 optoelectronic devices,16 photodetectors,17 and others due to its excellent properties. In the first report, Song et al. synthesized a CsSnBr3 solar cell device under a reducing vapor atmosphere, and the corresponding PCE achieved 3.04% (ref. 18) was far from the 28% predicted by the Shockley–Queisser model theory.19 However, single-component semiconductor perovskite materials showed poor photovoltaic performance due to rapid carrier recombination. Recently, several research groups have made great efforts to address the above questions by heterostructure engineering,20 vacancy defect engineering,21 and doping.22 The relevant reports have confirmed that combining two different semiconductor materials to construct a heterostructure, particularly the Z-scheme heterostructure,23 can modulate the electronic properties and bring more exciting physical phenomena, which now is a sensible strategy for designing photovoltaic devices.24 The interface of perovskite solar cells plays a significant role in influencing their performance.25 For example, Liu et al. constructed a Z-scheme heterostructure Cs3Bi2I9/Bi2WO6, which enhances the efficiency of photocatalysis CO2 reduction.23
SnS2 is another promising two-dimensional material with excellent optical and electronic properties.26 The monolayer of SnS2 generally has a suitable band gap of about 2 eV, which can be used in solar cells, photocatalysis, and photoelectric converters.27 For example, Li et al. prepared the SnS2/MoS2 heterostructure that is proven to possess high photoresponsivity (1.36 A W−1), high on/off ratio (>106), high mobility (27.6 cm2 V−1 s−1) and shows an obvious photovoltaic effect.28 Samad et al. also studied the SnS2/graphene heterostructure by first principles, which can be used in high-speed and high-throughput sodium-ion batteries.29 Moreover, the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of the SnS2 monolayer match well with that of the CsSnBr3 perovskite for the efficient separation of photogenerated electron holes. Benefiting from these advantages, coupling CsSnBr3 and SnS2 monolayers can overcome the disadvantage of high electron–holes recombination rate and broaden the visible light absorption range. However, defects are inevitable in the process of preparing materials, which significantly influence the photovoltaic performance of materials.30 On one hand, the local energy levels introduced by the defects can modulate the energy band structure and enhance the light absorption of semiconductor materials; on the other hand, defects can act as electron capture centers, provide electrons on the material surface, and promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.31,32 Yue et al. reported that Cs2AgBiBr6 with bromine (Br)-vacancy exhibits strong stability, the defects could optimize its electronic structure and enhance charge separation, leading to improved photocatalytic performance.33 Do the Br-vacancies in the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure also improve the photovoltaic performance? Theoretical studies on vacancies in the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure are still rare. Previous studies only used heterostructure engineering or vacancy-defect engineering to optimize performance, and these two strategies are rarely coupled to improve photovoltaic performance in inorganic perovskite materials.
In this work, CsSnBr3 combined with the SnS2 monolayer to establish a non-toxic and stable CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure. We also especially considered the Br-vacancy defects in the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, which exist at the interface and bulk (coded as VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2). The structural stability, interfacial electronic properties, optical absorption, charge transfer mechanism, and photovoltaic performance of pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 and the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure were investigated systematically by hybrid density functional theory (DFT). The defect formation energy was calculated to confirm the more stable defect system. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were used to examine the thermal stability of the systems. The charge transfer mechanism of the Z-scheme heterostructure was analyzed by calculating the electronic properties and work function. Finally, the I–V characteristics were calculated to study the photovoltaic performance of the systems. This work aims to provide a valuable theoretical basis for solar cell device.
2. Computational methods
The calculations are based on spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna ab initio calculation software package (VASP).34 The projected augmented wave (PAW)35 method was used to describe the interaction between ions and electrons. The exchange–correlation potential is described by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)36 of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).37 The cutoff energy of the electron wave function was set as 400 eV, and structure relaxation was performed until the convergence criteria of energy and force reached 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. The Brillouin zone was 3 × 3 × 1 k-points for the structure optimization and 5 × 5 × 1 for other calculations of all systems. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed to study the thermal stability at a limited temperature of 300–1000 K.38 The Nose hoover thermostat was used on the standard (NVT) system with a time step of 1 fs and a total simulation time of 10 ps.39 Considering that GGA-PBE functional often underestimate/overestimates the band gap of semiconductors. To obtain more accurate calculation results, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)40 hybrid functional was adopted. In the HSE06 function, the exchange–correlation energy is expressed as:41 EHSEXC = αESRX(μ) + (1 − α)EPBE,SRX(μ) + EPBE,LRX(μ) + EPBEC(1)in this function, the electron–electron interaction is separated into short-ranged (SR) and long-range (LR) parts, defined by the screening parameter μ, which is set as 0.20 Å−1. To bring the calculated band gap close to its experimental value, the Hartree–Fock exchange mixing parameter α was set as 0.002 and 0.04 for CsSnBr3 and SnS2 monolayers, respectively, in this work. The test results are shown in Fig. S1.† According to the weighted average of CsSnBr3 and the SnS2 monolayer, the α of the heterostructure was 0.023. The valence electron configurations contained (Cs)5s25p66s1, (Sn)5s25p2, (Br)4s24p5, and (S)3s23p4, in this study.
To study the I–V characteristics of systems, the Quantum Atomistix Toolkit (ATK) with self-consistent non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method was used to calculate the current at non-zero bias by default. This method considers the device Hamiltonian by first-order perturbation theory, and the relationship between current and voltage can be derived from the following formula:42 (2)where μL and μR are the electrochemical potential for the two electrodes and T(E, V) represents the transmission coefficient at energy E and bias voltage V. In addition, the transmission coefficient was calculated using the standard equation as following:42,43 T(E, V) = Tr[ΓL(E, V)G(E, V)ΓRG*(E, V)](3)where G represents the Green's function of the contact region, ΓL/R is the coupling matrix, and V is the applied voltage bias.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometric structure
Studies on pristine cubic CsSnBr3 bulk and the hexagonal SnS2 monolayer were performed. The calculated results are shown in Table 1, and the lattice parameters are a = b = c = 5.848 Å for CsSnBr3 bulk, and a = b = 3.699 Å for the SnS2 monolayer, which are in agreement with the previous experimental results (a = b = c = 5.795 Å for CsSnBr3 bulk44 and a = b = 3.640 Å for the SnS2 monolayer45) and theoretical results (a = b = c = 5.886 Å for CsSnBr3 bulk46 and a = b = 3.699 Å for the SnS2 monolayer47). These results show that our calculation methods and parameter settings are reliable and reasonable. As a prototype study, we select the (001) texture of cubic CsSnBr3 because its (001), (010), and (100) surface textures are symmetrically equivalent.48 CsSnBr3 bulk has two surface terminals (SnBr2 or CsBr). The calculated surface energy of the SnBr2 terminal (0.0113 eV Å−2) is less than that of the CsBr terminal (0.0131 eV Å−2), which indicates that the SnBr2 terminal is more stable. The surface energy can be expressed as follows:49 γ = (Eslab − nEunit)/2A(4)where Eslab, n, Eunit, and A represent the model energy, the number of atoms on a single side, the energy of each atom in the bulk, and the surface area, respectively. To obtain the minimum mismatch ratio, the CsSnBr3 (001) surface expands 1 × 3 to 24 atoms and the SnS2 monolayer expands √3 × 5 containing 30 atoms. The pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure contains 54 atoms, and the degree of the mismatch is 4.8% and 2.6% within a reasonable range.50 The layer spacing is taken as 3.28 Å and setting the 15 Å vacuum layer to avoid the influence of atomic periodicity, as depicted in Fig. 1(a).

Cyan, grey, brown, and yellow represent the Cs, Sn, Br, and S atoms, respectively. 
The defect formation energy (Ef) of Br-vacancies was calculated using the equation below:51 Ef = Ev − Ep + μi(5)where Ev and Ep represent the total energy of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure with and without Br vacancy, respectively. μi (i = Br) is the chemical potential of the removed atom. The calculated Br-vacancy formation energy at different sites is shown in Table 2. Br1 (red atoms, see Fig. 1), Br2 (blue atoms, see Fig. 1), and Br3 (purple atoms, see Fig. 1) represent three unequal atoms located on the surface and subsurface, respectively. The positive value stands for needing extra energy to form defects. They can be produced by means of high-energy electron irradiation that Komsa et al. reported.52 In addition, the light absorption of heterostructure with the Br vacancies at the concentrations of 1.8% (one vacancy), 3.7% (two vacancies), and 5.5% (three vacancies) were calculated, as depicted in Fig. 5 (see 3.3 optical absorption section). The calculated results show that the light absorption coefficient is the largest at the Br-vacancy concentration of 3.7%. Therefore, the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure with two vacancies is the other system for our calculation, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The optimized lattice constants of the pure CsSnBr3/SnS2/VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure are a = 6.31/6.37 Å and b = 18.34/18.36 Å. Besides, to make the optimized systems converge to the most stable, the bond length of the nearest neighbor Cl–Br becomes longer, while the bond length of Sn–Br in some other positions becomes shorter, accordingly, as shown in Table 2.

The AIMD simulations of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, SnS2 monolayer, CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure with 10 ps were calculated at finite temperatures (300, 500, and 1000 K) to study the thermodynamic stability. The fluctuations of temperatures and structures over time are plotted as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d). The results show that the CsSnBr3 (001) surface is most thermally stable and maintains structural integrity at low temperatures of 300 K. But at 500 K, some atoms have escaped the structure. At a high temperature of 1000 K, the structure collapsed. The SnS2 monolayer still maintained the structure stability at 1000 K, which indicated excellent thermal stability. However, it is worth noting that the stability of the pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructures followed the CsSnBr3 (001) surface structural stability change law over the temperature. It can be asserted that the pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructures have good thermal stability at 300 K during AIMD simulations, which lay a solid foundation for subsequent research. Moreover, many chemical bonds (Sn–S) exist at the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure interface due to the introduction of Br vacancies that bring unsaturated sites. The interfacial chemical bonds can act as specific charge transfer channels accelerating the charge transfer between VBr-CsSnBr3 (001) surface and the SnS2 monolayer.53
3.2. Electronic properties
To investigate accurately the electronic properties of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, without and with vacancies, the energy band structures of the CsSnBr3 bulk, CsSnBr3 (001) surface, and the SnS2 monolayer were calculated using the HSE06 and GGA-PBE methods, respectively, as shown in Fig. S2† and 3(a) and (b). For the HSE06 calculation, the CsSnBr3 bulk is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.94 eV, in which, the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) were located at the M point (see Fig. S2†). The band gap of the CsSnBr3 bulk is 1.94 eV, which is in good agreement with the previous experimental value of 1.92 eV (ref. 54) and theoretical value of 1.97 eV.55 However, the band gap of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface (2.02 eV) is 0.08 eV larger than the calculated result of bulk, which is due to the quantum confinement effect caused by the thickness limit of the slab model. Fig. 3(b) shows the band structures of the SnS2 monolayer. It can be seen that the SnS2 monolayer is a typical indirect band gap semiconductor. The calculated band gap is about 2.13 eV, which is consistent with the previous experimental value of 2.12 eV.56 For GGA-PBE calculation, the band gap of CsSnBr3 bulk is 2.02 eV, which overestimates the band gap. The calculated band gaps for the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer are 1.06 eV and 1.58 eV, respectively, which obviously underestimate the band gap compared with the HSE06 method. The band gap value of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure is 0.87 eV (0.23 eV), calculated using the HSE06 (GGA-PBE) method, which is caused due to the interaction between the two components, as illustrated in Fig. 3(c). When the SnS2 monolayer adsorbs on the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, the conduction band of the heterostructure is contributed by the SnS2 monolayer, while its valence band is occupied by the CsSnBr3 (001) surface. Its valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the S point. The band structures of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure are shown in Fig. 3(d). It can be seen that when the Br vacancies are introduced, the electronic structures have changed to some extent. The band gap is reduced and some local levels are introduced. When Br vacancies are introduced, a large number of vacancies are left due to the negative charge of Br atoms in the structure. The local levels owing to the extra electrons from the Br vacancies cause additional light absorption via the electron transition from the local energy levels to the conduction band. The valence band moves up closer to the Fermi level and the band gap reduces to 0.82 eV, which indicates the electron transition to the conduction band more easily. The light absorption of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure system has a red shift, which improves the photovoltaic performance.
In addition, the total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, SnS2 monolayer, pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure were calculated using the HSE06 method to analyse the internal interface charge transfer, as depicted in Fig. 4. For the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, VBM is dominated by Br (4p) states and CBM is dominated by Sn (5p) states, which is plotted in Fig. 4(a) and (a′). Nevertheless, VBM on the SnS2 monolayer is mainly composed of S (3p) and CBM is mainly contributed by Sn (5p), as depicted in Fig. 4(b) and (b′). For the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, the new VBM is mainly contributed by Br (4p) states of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, and the CBM is composed of the Sn (5p) state in the SnS2 monolayer, which indicates that the Br (4p) states on the CsSnBr3 (001) surface is more likely to be directly excited to the Sn (5p) states of the SnS2 monolayer, as shown in Fig. 4(c, c′) and (d, d′). It is obvious that the VBM of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface is higher than that of the SnS2 monolayer, while the CBM of the SnS2 monolayer is lower than that of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface in the heterostructure. Based on the above analysis, we find that the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure are the staggered band arrangement structures, which are conducive to the separation of the electron and holes.
3.3. Optical absorption
The wavelength-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, SnS2 monolayer, CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure with different Br vacancy concentrations were calculated and the data are summarized in Fig. 5. The optical absorption coefficient α(ω) can be expressed by the following formula:57 (6)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function ε(ω), respectively, which can be up to the optical frequency (ω). In the ultraviolet region of 200–290 nm and visible light range, the optical response of the SnS2 monolayer is higher than that of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface. The optical response of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface is higher than the SnS2 monolayer at the ultraviolet region of 290–380 nm due to the narrowing band gap of 2.02 eV. However, the optical absorption capacity of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure in the visible range is higher than the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and the SnS2 monolayer. This is because the band gap of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure is reduced and absorbs a large number of photons than the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and the SnS2 monolayer. The redshift of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure with Br vacancy concentrations of 3.7% (two vacancies) optical absorption edge is more obvious, compared with the pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure with Br vacancy concentrations of 1.8% (one vacancy), and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure with Br vacancy concentrations of 5.5% (three vacancies). This may be the lowest band gap of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and the built-in electric field that is generated at the interface by the charge transfer (discuss below) promotes the transition of low-energy photons.
3.4. Charge transfer and band alignment
We calculated the charge density difference of the pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure to clarify the charge transfer between CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer, as shown in Fig. 6. The charge density equation is as follows: Δρ = ρ(VBr)-CsSnBr3/SnS2 − ρ(VBr)-CsSnBr3 − ρSnS2(7)where ρ(VBr)-CsSnBr3/SnS2, ρ(VBr)-CsSnBr3, and ρSnS2 represent the charge density of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructures, CsSnBr3 (001) without and with Br vacancies, and SnS2 monolayer, respectively. The yellow area indicates charge depletion and the cyan area represents charge accumulation. The CsSnBr3 (001) surface is mainly covered by yellow areas and a small cyan area, forming a hole-rich center and the SnS2 monolayer is mainly covered by cyan areas and a small yellow area, forming electron-rich sites, thus promoting carrier separation. The charge redistribution happens mainly in the interface region of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure. To explore the charge redistribution between the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer, the planar average charge density difference of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure was calculated by integrating the electron density difference along the Z direction, as shown in Fig. 6. Obviously, the results show that the charge transfer from the CsSnBr3 (001) surface to SnS2 monolayer is consistent with the above DOS analysis. The positive value reflects electron accumulation, while the negative values represent electron depletion. It is worth noting that the charge density difference of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure is about 10 times that of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, confirming that the interfacial Sn–S bonds afford the fast pathways for charge transfer from the SnS2 monolayer to the VBr-CsSnBr3 (001) surface, thus accelerating the Z-scheme charge transfer process. The results prove that the construction of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure greatly promotes charge transfer and inhibits the recombination of the electron–hole pairs, improving the photovoltaic performance.

The work function of materials is defined as the minimum energy required for electrons to escape from the Fermi level to the vacuum, which is usually used as an internal reference for band alignment.58 The work function is calculated by the following equation:59 Φ = Evac − EF(8)where Evac and EF represent the energy of a stationary electron in a vacuum near the surface and the Fermi energy of the ground state electronic structure, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, the work functions of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, SnS2 monolayer, CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure were calculated to be 4.73 eV, 6.67 eV, 5.94 eV, and 5.38 eV, respectively. The calculated value of the VBr-CsSnBr3 (001) surface work function is 4.21 eV (see Fig. S3†). The work function of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface is lower than that of the SnS2 monolayer, which facilitates the escaping of the electrons from the CsSnBr3 (001) surface to the SnS2 monolayer when the two systems are in contact. The work function of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure is lower than CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, which means that electrons escape more easily. Through the Bader charge analysis, the intensity of the built-in electric field between the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer can be determined according to the parallel-plate capacitor model as follows:60 (9)where E is the built-in electric field, Q is the number of electrons transferred, ε0εr is the absolute dielectric constant in vacuum and S is the interface area of the heterostructure. The calculated number of electrons transferred, interface area and built-in electric field of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure are depicted in Table 3. The calculated built-in electric field values are 0.03 V Å−1 and 0.39 V Å−1 for the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, respectively.

The band edge positions before and after forming the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure are plotted by combing DOS, band gap, and the work function of each system, and the results are shown in Fig. 8. Before the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and the SnS2 monolayer come into contact, the band edge positions of the VB and CB of CsSnBr3 (001) surface are −5.14 eV and −3.12 eV vs. absolute vacuum scale (AVS), respectively. In the same way, the VB and CB positions of the SnS2 monolayer are −7.62 eV and −5.49 eV, vs. AVS, respectively. The CsSnBr3 (001) surface and the SnS2 monolayer cause charge transfer after contacting each other due to the difference of the Fermi level, until the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer reach the same Fermi level, forming a CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, as depicted in Fig. 8(a). At the same time, the overall VB and CB edge positions of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface move up by 1.21 eV, while the SnS2 monolayer moves down by 0.73 eV. It is clear that the VB energy levels and CB energy levels of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface are higher than that of the SnS2 monolayer in the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure. Therefore, the new VB and CB of the heterostructure are composed of the SnS2 monolayer and the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, respectively. With the introduction of the Br vacancies, the work function of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure decreases and the Fermi level improves accordingly, which leads to an improvement of the VB and CB edge positions, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The VBM and CBM edge positions of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure are −6.80 eV and −3.48 eV, respectively. Under visible light irradiation, the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer absorb solar energy, resulting in electron–holes pairs. Some electrons are excited from the VB to the CB, and the holes remain in VB. The great difference of EF between the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer leads to the charge redistribution at the heterostructure interface and a built-in electric field is formed. The built-in electric field direction is from the CsSnBr3 (001) surface point to the SnS2 monolayer. Under the action of the built-in electric field, the electrons in the CB of the SnS2 monolayer are transferred to the VB of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface. During this microscopic process, some of the electrons in the CB on the SnS2 monolayer also recombine with the holes in the VB of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface. Eventually, the electrons remain on the CB of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, and the holes remain on the VB of the SnS2 monolayer. This charge transfer mechanism is called the Z-scheme heterostructure, which is greatly conducive to the separation of electrons and holes compared with the traditional type-II heterostructure. It is worth noting that the VBM and CBM of the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure have larger overpotentials of −6.80 eV and −3.48 eV, respectively, than that of the pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, indicating that it can provide more abundant electrons for the photovoltaic effect. The results show that the Z-scheme VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure has a satisfactory photovoltaic performance.

3.5. Photovoltaic performance
The I–V characteristics of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface, SnS2 monolayer, CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure were calculated using the ATK software package, as shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the current of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure is significantly greater than that of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer under forward bias voltage 0–4 V, which may be due to the fact that the band gap of the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure is smaller than that of the CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer, thus making the photovoltaic effect more active under visible light. The introduction of the Br vacancies in the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure brings many electrons, which accelerate the separation of the electron–hole pairs and cause additional light absorption. For the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, its photovoltaic performance is improved compared to that of the pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure in the range of 0–4 V, because the CBM transforms from the Sn (5p) of CsSnBr3 (001) surface to the low energy Sn (5p) of the SnS2 monolayer orbital, which is a beneficial carrier transition. Further, the indirect band gap properties also reduce the carrier composition rate and usefully extend the carrier's life. When the same voltage is applied, the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure produces a larger current than the pure CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure, which indicates that a large amount of charge transfer creates a smaller resistance. Therefore, the VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure has larger electronic transport properties than the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure device and has the potential to become a novel perovskite photovoltaic material.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we systematically studied the interfacial electronic properties, optical absorption, charge transfer mechanism, and photovoltaic performance of CsSnBr3/SnS2 and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructures by using the hybrid DFT calculations. The CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure and VBr-CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure were proved to be stable at a certain temperature. The calculation of defect formation energy and optical absorption determined that the CsSnBr3/SnS2 heterostructure with Br-vacancies concentration of 3.7% has excellent light absorption. A built-in electronic field is formed due to the large EF difference between the VBr-CsSnBr3 (001) surface and SnS2 monolayer, which accelerates photoexcited electrons transfer from the CB of the SnS2 monolayer to VB of the VBr-CsSnBr3 (001) surface complying with the Z-scheme band alignment. The I–V characteristics results show that the photovoltaic performance of CsSnBr3 is improved significantly by coupling the interface and Br vacancies defects, generating maximum current. The comprehensive theoretical research provides a promising strategy for the future experimental preparation of the CsSnBr3-based solar cells.
