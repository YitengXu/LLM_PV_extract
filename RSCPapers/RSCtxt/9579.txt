    , Accepted 17th June 2016First published on 20th June 2016AbstractReducing semiconductor materials to sizes comparable to the characteristic lengths of phonons, such as the mean-free-path (MFP) and wavelength, has unveiled new physical phenomena and engineering capabilities for thermal energy management and conversion systems. These developments have been enabled by the increasing sophistication of chemical synthesis, microfabrication, and atomistic simulation techniques to understand the underlying mechanisms of phonon transport. Modifying thermal properties by scaling physical size is particularly effective for materials which have large phonon MFPs, such as crystalline Si and Ge. Through nanostructuring, materials that are traditionally good thermal conductors can become good candidates for applications requiring thermal insulation such as thermoelectrics. Precise understanding of nanoscale thermal transport in Si and Ge, the leading materials of the modern semiconductor industry, is increasingly important due to more stringent thermal conditions imposed by ever-increasing complexity and miniaturization of devices. Therefore this Minireview focuses on the recent theoretical and experimental developments related to reduced length effects on thermal transport of Si and Ge with varying size from hundreds to sub-10 nm ranges. Three thermal transport regimes – bulk-like, Casimir, and confinement – are emphasized to describe different governing mechanisms at corresponding length scales.
1. Introduction
The continual downscaling of electronic and optoelectronic devices has fuelled strong interest in research on the thermal properties of nanoscale materials. For example, power and heat densities in certain hotspots have risen sharply with the current trends of miniaturization and integration of devices.1,2 Fundamental understanding of heat conduction and nanoscale interfacial thermal resistance in materials, heterojunctions, and the interconnects between components is thus necessary to prevent premature degradation and failure of devices. On the other hand, thermal engineering via manipulation of heat carriers, phonons, shows promising applications, such as waste heat recovery through thermoelectric conversion. Improvement in thermoelectric device efficiency requires increasing the thermoelectric figure-of-merit, ZT = S2σT/(κe + κL), where S, σ, T, κe, and κL are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, absolute temperature, and thermal conductivity due to electrons and phonons, respectively.3 Among the parameters which define ZT, reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity has been a powerful strategy to improve thermoelectric performance as it is not directly coupled to electronic properties, namely power factor.4,5
Motivated by these various thermal issues, engineering thermal transport using nanostructures has been widely pursued6–10 for a broad range of applications such as nanoscale transistors,1 phase change memory,11 and advanced thermoelectrics.4,12 In particular, nano-structuring has been proven to be an effective approach to reduce the thermal conductivity12–15 of crystalline semiconductors. Progress has occurred concurrently with the development of novel nanoscale metrological, analytical, and computational techniques enabling characterization of phonon transport properties such as thermal conductivity,12,13 interfacial/boundary phonon scattering,9,16 phonon dispersion,17 mean free path spectra,6,18 and first-principles calculations.19 New nanomaterials and nanostructures have been developed, via either top-down or bottom-up processes, which exhibit thermal characteristics vastly different compared to traditional bulk semiconductors.20–22
Phonon transport is generally described using two important length-scales: phonon MFP and wavelength. From these two characteristic lengths, the effects of reduced length scales on thermal transport can be categorized into three regimes: bulk-like, boundary scattering (or Casimir), and confinement, as shown in Fig. 1(a). These can be understood via kinetic theory where the thermal conductivity is formulated as:23 (1)here, C(ω), v(ω), and Λ(ω) are the phonon frequency (ω) dependent specific heat, phonon group velocity, and phonon MFP, respectively. The overall phonon MFP (Λ) is related to the individual MFPs associated with specific scattering mechanisms via the Matthiessen's rule: (2)where ΛU, ΛI, and ΛD are the MFPs associated with phonon–phonon (Umklapp), phonon–impurity, and phonon–boundary scattering processes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the transition between transport regimes is related to the physical size of the sample in comparison to the characteristic phonon length scales. When the characteristic size of sample is longer than the phonon MFP (D ≫ Λ), heat transport is considered to be diffusive and the MFP is limited by Umklapp (ΛU) and/or phonon–impurity (Λi) scattering in bulk materials.
 Fig. 1  (a) Size (D) dependent thermal transport mechanisms. Three regimes are categorised by comparison of physical size and characteristic lengths (MFP, Λ and wavelength, λ) of phonons. Examples of materials are presented side-by-side corresponding to each regime. (b) Contribution of MFP to thermal conductivity at 300 K for Si, Ge, Si0.5Ge0.5 and Bi2Te3 bulk materials. Red region indicates MFP range which corresponds to 80% contribution to thermal conductivity. Yellow spots show when accumulative contribution reaches 50% of total thermal conductivity. 
Thermal conductivity of bulk materials, therefore, strongly depends on phonon velocity and the MFP distribution. Fig. 1(b) displays the weighted MFP contribution to the thermal conductivity of bulk Si,19,24 Ge,24 Si0.5Ge0.5,25 and Bi2Te326 at room temperature. The effect of size reduction on thermal conductivity can be understood from the cumulative thermal conductivity function (kc/k), top panel of Fig. 1(b), as calculated by lattice dynamics24,26 and perturbation theory.25 This function represents the percentage of the total thermal conductivity which is contributed by phonons with MFPs less than a specific value. These specific MFP ranges are strongly material dependent, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1(b). For example, among the four materials shown, Si has the largest thermal conductivity due to its small atomic mass (large phonon velocity) and long phonon MFPs, of which those between 10 and 470 nm long contribute to 50% of the total thermal conductivity. Ge, on the other hand, has lower thermal conductivity due to lower phonon velocity and also comparatively shorter phonon MFPs than Si due to its larger atomic mass. Thermal conductivity can be further decreased by alloying Si and Ge, increasing the impurity scattering rate (∼1/ΛI) via the variation of atomic masses. The MFP contributions to thermal conductivity in SiGe extend over a large range, much broader than that of intrinsic Si or Ge. This is due to the strong scattering of high frequency phonons, resulting a relatively larger contribution from low frequency phonons with long MFPs.27–29 For further comparison, phonon MFPs in Bi2Te3 are ∼2–3 orders of magnitude shorter than Si and Ge based materials primarily due to increased anharmonicity and Umklapp scattering rate caused by long-ranged interaction from its rhombohedral crystal structure.30,31 It is worth noting that the weak van der Waals bonding along the c-axis in Bi2Te3 does not necessarily lead to short phonon MFPs, as recently revealed in graphite along the c-axis.32,33
Having briefly discussed phonon thermal conductivity in bulk materials, we will then focus on providing a cursory overview of recent work aimed at understanding phonon dynamics and heat transport in thin (sub-30 nm) nanostructures, focusing on Si and Ge based materials. The following topics will be discussed:
(1) Classical size effects on heat transport and length scales of phonons.
(2) Phonon dynamics in nanowires and thin films, with specific attention to deviations from bulk behaviour at reduced size.
(3) Synthesis techniques for sub-30 nm nanostructures.
(4) Thermal conductivity simulations and measurements of sub-30 nm Si and Ge nanostructures, including films, nanowires (NWs), and nanotubes (NTs).
(5) The influence of surface-induced elastic softening on thermal transport and phonon behaviour in nanomaterials.
2. Boundary scattering regime
From the aforementioned discussion of phonon MFPs, it is clear that reducing the size of the material system to the scale of the phonon MFPs (D ∼ Λ) will result in a strong size dependent thermal conductivity. Materials at this scale are considered to be in the boundary scattering or Casimir regime (Fig. 1(a)), where phonon–boundary/interface (ΛD) scattering leads to reduced thermal conductivity.12,13,34 and the size of the sample affects and sometimes even dominates the overall phonon MFP (eqn (2)). Practical explorations of this effect at room temperature did not emerge until the advent of nanoscale electronic devices with physical dimensions approaching the phonon MFP.
A prime example of this effect can be observed in the thermal conductivity of Si thin films,15,35–44 which is highly size-dependent. In films with thickness on the order of 100 nm,15,39–44 thermal conductivity is from the bulk value (∼150 W m−1 K−1),45 as shown in Fig. 2, which is expected based on the MFP distribution from Fig. 1(b). These results were important for explicitly showing that range of phonon MFPs in Si (∼300 nm) could be much longer than previous estimations based on the kinetic theory (∼40 nm), which had neglected the dispersion of phonons.
 Fig. 2  Representative normalized thermal conductivity (κ) vs. film thickness or NW diameter for Si15,35–43 and Ge46 films and nanowires (NWs)13,21 at 300 K. The thermal conductivity of Si films and NWs decreases with decreasing film thickness from bulk values45 at the micron scale to an almost ten-fold reduction for 20 nm thick films. A similar trend can be observed in the thermal conductivity of Ge films and NWs, however, the actual thermal conductivities are lower than in Si due to the heavier atomic mass of Ge, which reduces phonon velocity. For thin films, Landauer formula based model47 is used to calculate thickness dependent thermal conductivity. The result for Si films (black solid line) shows good agreement for films thicker than 50 nm. For NWs, modified Holland's model48,49 fits well for Si NWs (black dash line) down to 37 nm at 300 K. The deviation between model and experiment for the 22 nm Si NW may imply the modification of phonon dispersion and scattering at this length scale. 
Similar thermal conductivity reduction is observed in Ge films,46 albeit at smaller size than that of the Si films. The size dependent thermal conductivity observed in thin films can be modelled by the Landauer formula using the full phonon dispersion:47 (3)where L, A, TL, Tph, Mph, and Wph are the sample length, cross-sectional area, absolute temperature, transmission function, number of conducting channels, and “window function” at a given phonon energy ħω, respectively. The function kB2TLπ2/(3h) is the quantum of thermal conductance. This integration occurs over the entire phonon frequency range, and the full phonon dispersion for Si and Ge can be found in various studies.50,51 For simplicity, one can also use polynomial fitting method to obtain the approximate phonon dispersion, as shown by Hopkins et al.52 The transmission, Tph, is defined as: Tph(ω) = ΛB(ω)/(L + ΛB(ω))(4)where ΛB(ω) is the “backscattering” MFP of phonons, which is related to the “conventional” MFP Λ(ω) (eqn (1)) by ΛB(ω) = 4/3·Λ(ω) in 3D. Accounting for boundary scattering and surface roughness, the backscattering MFP of a thin free-standing film has been found by solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE),39,53 and is given as: (5)here δ = (4/3)(dSi/ΛB,bulk) and ΛB,bulk is the bulk backscattering MFP, while dSi and p are the thin film thickness and specularity parameter. The “4/3” factor originates from the conversion between backscattering MFP (ΛB(ω)) and conventional MFP(Λ(ω)).54 This model shows good agreement for most Si thin films with thickness greater than ∼50 nm, and is consistent with analytical model based on the BTE approach by McGaughey et al.55 However, the model does not accurately capture the thermal conductivity of Ge thin films. compared to Si, there are very few experimental results on Ge thin films, and more data are needed to better compare the modelling and the experimental results.
For NWs, Mingo et al.49 compared result from Callaway's, Holland's and their real dispersion method. The boundary scattering rate is determined as τb−1(ω) = vs/F/D, where vs is the average phonon velocity between the two transverse and one longitudinal acoustic branches, D is the diameter of the NWs, and F is related to the degree of specularity. The real dispersion approach can model the thermal conductivity of Si and Ge NWs well from 20 K to 320 K. From their comparison, we find that Holland's method agrees well with the real dispersion method at 300 K, although at lower temperature it deviates from the real dispersion result. In Fig. 2, we showed the diameter dependence of NWs thermal conductivity at 300 K using Holland's method. The model is able to generally capture thermal conductivity of NWs when D > ∼30 nm, assuming fully diffusive boundary scattering (i.e., F = 1). Note that for temperature below 300 K, the real dispersion method by Mingo et al.49,56 is more accurate.
In both the thin film and NW cases, however, the model does not accurately predict the thermal conductivity of smaller Si and Ge thin films (<50 nm) and nanowires (<30 nm) (Fig. 2). This points to the possibility of a modified phonon dispersion,13 different Umklapp scattering mechanism at reduced dimension,55 and more pronounced surface effects.12,13 This disagreement has fuelled much interest aiming to understand phonon dynamics and heat transport properties in thin nanostructures, specifically in the sub-30 nm size range, as we shall discuss later.
3. Confinement regime
We referred to the size region of sub-30 nm as the ‘confinement regime’. In the literature, phonon confinement is usually used to describe the modification of phonon modes due to spatial confinement,57 an phenomenon that is analogous to the confinement of electron wavefunctions in quantum structures. Here, however, we use ‘confinement’ to broadly describe surface-induced effects beyond the classical phonon boundary scattering effect. These surface effects could include the modification of phonon dispersion, as well as any other effects, such as surface roughness and oxides.
3.1 Synthesis and fabrication of sub-30 nm nanostructures
The development of new nanoscale materials has enabled exciting avenues in fundamental research by exploring new thermal transport phenomena and mechanisms. Diverse sizes and shapes of Si and Ge based nanomaterials have been developed by both top-down and bottom-up approaches.21,38,58,59 Through top-down fabrication techniques, films or wires can be prepared by deposition and selective etching. A convenient way to prepare a thin layer material is by depositing the target material onto a bulk substrate with good thermal isolation.60 For studies on thin Si films, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers can serve as an alternative platform.15 To increase the measurement accuracy and better probe intrinsic heat transport properties of even thinner structures, suspended membranes are preferable to reduce heat loss through the substrate and remove interfacial effects. Fabrication of suspended structures can be accomplished via isotropic wet etching, dry etching, or critical point drying techniques. Applying these methods on a specified area, defined by an etch window, while other regions are protected by SiNx/SiO2 coatings, enables fabrication of very thin (∼10 nm) Si membranes.20,44 Sophisticated microfabrication techniques allow the fabrication of materials with reduced dimensions down to tens of nanometres, enabling measurement of mesoscopic phenomena such as the quantum of thermal conductance.61
On the other hand, the synthesis of various one-dimensional Si, Ge, and heterostructured nanostructures has been widely demonstrated through bottom-up techniques such as metal-assisted growth in vapour or liquid phases and template-assisted synthesis prompted via vapour–liquid–solid (VLS), vapour–solid–solid (VSS), and solution–liquid–solid (SLS) mechanisms. Compared to the top-down processes, bottom-up approaches are preferred due to their relatively lower cost and simplicity for fabricating low dimensional nanomaterial with atomic precision and compositional/structural complexity, as shown in Fig. 3.

Among the growth mechanisms mentioned here, VLS based chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is the most commonly used process for NW synthesis due to its simplicity and the high crystalline quality of the produced nanomaterials. NWs down to 10 nm in diameter can be readily synthesized by simply selecting catalytic metal particles within the target dimension. Furthermore, in situ growth of both radial21 and axial22 hetero-nanostructure NWs allows a wide gamut of semiconductor material parameters to enable phonon engineering. CVD synthesis of NTs also enables the fabrication of structures only a few atomic layers thick and with large volumetric hollow regions.62
3.2 Modification of phonon dispersion and velocity
As nanostructures drop below 30 nm in size, deviations from bulk-like mechanical behaviour have been observed, such as changes in the sound or phonon velocity (v). This is particularly interesting because reducing v can provide an additional route to inhibit thermal transport on top of increased phonon-boundary scattering, as evident in eqn (1). The phonon group velocity is dictated by the dispersion of phonons, or the relationship between phonon energy (or frequency, ω) and momentum (or wave-vector, q), as v(ω) = dω/dq. While changes in the dispersion also affect the phonon density-of-states and therefore phonon heat capacity, C(ω) is normally bulk-like for all but the smallest structures (<5 nm) at low temperature (<20 K),64 therefore only changes in v(ω) will be discussed here. Changes in phonon velocity have been posited for the strong change in thermal conductivity behaviour of sub-30 nm NWs, either via the presence of high frequency phonon modes not in bulk materials,49 confinement of phonon modes,65,66 or both.

Fig. 4 shows the theoretical results of phonon dispersions in bulk Si (Fig. 4(a)) and Si thin films (Fig. 4(b) and (c)). When the size is reduced to the sub-30 nm range, the phonon dispersion is significantly altered, leading softening phonon modes and consequently size-dependent reduction of phonon group velocities.67 This has a significant impact on thermal properties in low-dimensional materials and has investigated many theoretical studies using lattice and molecular dynamics simulations as well as experimental studies on sound (phonon) velocity and thermal conductivity in nanomaterials.

Experimentally, investigating the dynamics of phonons in nanostructures has become important to understand the cause of deviations in thermal properties from that expected based solely on the viewpoint of MFP reduction. Recent experimental advances have allowed researchers to investigate high frequency (GHz range) mechanics of films and nanowires. Results show that these mechanical, and therefore phonon modes can deviate significantly in nanostructures from the bulk-like material.
Angle-resolved Brillouin light scattering (BLS) studies on ∼10–30 nm thick suspended films have shown a steep drop, compared to bulk Si, in the phonon velocities of fundamental flexural modes, indicating a modification of the phonon dispersion (Fig. 5(a) and (b)).17 The resulting low energy (up to a few Gigahertz) phonon dispersion in these sub-30 nm films matched well with similarly sized simulated films.68 These observations indicate that phonon modes are softened at this size scale, possibly indicating that the effective elastic constants are reduced from their bulk values as well, which could be due to surface effects such as coupling with the native oxide coating. Reduced effective elastic constants on this size scale have also been observed in measurements of the Young's modulus of sub-30 nm Si NWs69 and thin Si NTs,62 which will be discussed later, as well as in Si cantilevers.70,71 Experimental measurements of coherently confined phonons in sub-30 nm Si membranes found phonon relaxation times to be dominated by scattering due to the surface roughness of about 0.5 nm while thicker films in the range of ∼100 nm were dominated by phonon–phonon interactions.20

Sound velocity in 50 nm diameter InSb NWs72 has also been measured using time-resolved X-ray diffraction and was found to be significantly reduced (2880 m s−1) from the bulk value (3860 m s−1). Performing a Fourier transform on the time-resolved strain distribution in time and space allowed reconstruction of the phonon dispersion, which could be compared to the simulated dispersion of bulk InSb (Fig. 5(c)), InSb NWs with bulk elastic constants (Fig. 5(d)), and InSb NWs with reduced elastic constants (Fig. 5(e)). The simulated phonon dispersion matched the measured NW sound velocity () when the C44 elastic constant was reduced from the bulk value by 35%. This elastic softening would lead to a reduced phonon velocity in eqn (1), further decreasing the thermal conductivity.
To gain insight into the effects of structure size approaching the phonon wavelength, measurements can be conducted at low temperatures where phonon wavelengths increase to scales similar to the scale of micro-fabricated devices: λph = 2πħv(ω)/kBT where λph, ħ, v(ω), kB, and T are the phonon wavelength, reduced plank constant, phonon velocity, Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively.61 In light of this, experiments on large Si structures (∼100 nm) at ∼0.3 K with superconducting phonon spectrometers73 found that a large number of phonons which strike the structure side-walls scatter diffusively and do not reach the detector on the opposite end. Calculations based on the structure surface roughness (∼1 nm) under-predicted the scattering rate due to surface interactions. However, oxidized or amorphous surfaces could increase the scattering rate at the surface as phonons interact with diffuson modes present in the amorphous layer,74 which has been observed in simulations.
3.3 Molecular dynamics simulations
Lattice and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a useful tool to observe the dynamical and thermal behaviour of systems at an atomistic scale currently not possible in real-world experiments. Insights extracted from these simulations can be used to understand phenomena observed in experimental studies and to predict new materials with unique properties. In particular, as computational power increases, simulated systems comprised of increasingly larger numbers of atoms becomes accessible, approaching similar sizes as that of experimentally measured sub-30 nm nanomaterials.
Simulations of sub-30 nm thick Si films67,68 have shown that thickness reduction directly modify the phonon dispersion (Fig. 4 & 5), leading to ‘flattening’ of phonon modes and reduced group velocities. This effect, however, did not reduce thermal conductivity to a large degree, nowhere near that observed in experimental studies.68 The simulations were modified by adding combinations of surface roughness and amorphous silica surfaces, similar to native oxides present on experimentally measured materials (cases 1–4 shown in Fig. 6(a)). The surface oxide atomic disorder and larger structural corrugations were found to enhance surface scattering, leading it to become the dominant mechanism on top of size reduction for reducing thermal transport by obstructing longer wavelength phonons, as evident in the thermal conductivity accumulation shifting to shorter MFPs (Fig. 6(b)).

The presence of an amorphous surface has a profound impact on phonon propagation and thermal conductivity because vibrational properties are very dissimilar in amorphous and crystalline atomic structures. The vibrational modes in amorphous silicon (a-Si) are primarily considered as propagons (propagating modes) and diffusions (non-propagating and delocalized modes).75 Propagons are thought to possess MFP ranges on the order 10–100 nm whereas diffuson MFPs are only ∼0.5–10 nm,6,76,77 significantly less than the MFP of phonons in crystalline Si (c-Si), which is up to the order of microns.19 SiO2 (silica) on the other hand, primarily contains diffusions, with little to no propagating modes.6,76 The oxidized or amorphous surfaces on thin nanostructures consequently increase the scattering rate of propagating phonons near the crystalline–amorphous interface where they interact with the diffusions in the amorphous coating.74
Further reduction of thermal conductivity can be achieved by increasing the influence of surface effects, such as with nanotube (NT) structures. Introducing a small hole in a nanowire, forming a NT, leads to a disproportionately large decrease in thermal conductivity (Fig. 6(f)).79 This effect causes the thermal conductivity of NTs to be much lower than NWs, even if both have the same cross-sectional area. This is because the inner surface of the NT significantly increases phonon scattering due to a larger percentage of localized phonon modes over the case of the NW.
Besides NTs, there are other ways to efficiently engineer further reductions and alter thermal behaviour in nanowires, through the introduction of heterostructure interfaces within NWs to alter the phonon spectrum, such as superlattice or epitaxial shell structures. These types of composite structures can be designed to form nanometre scale structures which are comparable to the wavelengths of phonons19 and could modify the phonon dispersion through phonon confinement.66 Of particular interest are core–shell (CS) NWs, where the material and size of the core wire and epitaxial shell can be accurately controlled such that the influence of the interface between the core and coating on thermal conductivity can be explored. Modelling studies based on the BTE82,83 have shown that the combination of scattering at the surface and core–shell interface can greatly reduce the thermal conductivity.
Aside from phonon scattering effect, it is plausible to alter phonon group velocities and density of states by interference of coherent (wave-like) phonons at the interfaces of such layered structures. The interference occurs when the interface roughness is atomically smooth, below the phonon wavelength, leading to phase-preserved transmission/reflection of phonons at the interface.84,85 MD studies that probed such effect in Si–Ge CS NWs have shown the reduction of thermal conductivity by localized modes. These modes are produced by coherent resonant coupling between longitudinal and quantized transverse phonon modes caused by acoustic mismatch between the core and shell materials.86 Furthermore, a critical shell coating thickness results in a minimized thermal conductivity (Fig. 6(g)).80 Thinner surface coatings added negligible phonon scattering while thicker coatings only increase the phonon population, thereby increasing the thermal conductivity. Importantly, the choice of material composition of the core and shell relative to one another is important, such as the shell being softer or stiffer than the core material, to engineer the acoustic mismatch at the interface.87,88 The thermal conductivity of CS NWs has also been found to be temperature independent, unlike the strong temperature dependence of pure NWs, and at a critical thickness a crossover in the thermal conductivity between pure and CS NWs exists (Fig. 6(h)).81
3.4 Thermal conductivity measurement techniques for thin nanostructures
Many techniques have been developed to measure the thermal conductivity of individual nanostructures including but not limited to electro-thermal heating,89–91 photo-thermal heating,92,93 and bi-metallic cantilevers.94–96 However, these have certain peculiarities that limit their usefulness, such as requiring conductive samples, complicated optical absorption characterization, or limited temperature ranges. Consequently, one of the most widely used methods is the steady-state suspended micro-device technique (Fig. 7(a)).13,97 This technique, while requiring custom micro-fabrication, is based on measuring the heat flux between hot and cold thermal baths on opposite ends of a suspended nanostructure as well as the temperatures of two baths via resistive thermometers. This technique is capable of measuring thin nanostructures with thermal conductance down to ∼1 nW K−1,97 however, the thermal conductance of sub-30 nm thick nanostructures (Fig. 7(b)) can be in the sub nano-watt/Kelvin range. To facilitate measurements on these samples, modifications to the suspended micro-device technique, specifically the introduction of a bridge based setup (Fig. 7(c)), have enabled increased resolution down to ∼10 pW K−1.21,98 Further improvement to the system can subtract the parasitic background thermal conductance, which can be on the same order as the nanostructure thermal conductance,99,100 and further increase the sensitivity (∼0.25 pW K−1)99 using a modulated heating scheme.101,102 The suspended device system has been used to measure a wide variety of samples, including thin films,38,43,103,104 polymer fibres,105,106 NWs,12,13,21,103,107,108 and NTs.62,109,110

3.5 Thermal conductivity measurements

3.5.1 Si films. 
Measurements on suspended 30 and 20 nm thick Si films showed that the thermal conductivity was greatly reduced from bulk values to 31 and 22 W m−1 K−1, respectively.35–37 similar to that of ∼18 nm thick single crystal film measured with the suspended micro-device technique38 (∼20 W m−1 K−1). A non-contact technique based on two-laser Raman thermometry93 has also been used to measure suspended films down to a thickness of ∼10 nm,44 which was found to have a thermal conductivity of ∼10 W m−1 K−1 (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Size dependent thermal conductivities of crystalline Si films,15,35–44 nanowires (NWs),13 and nanotubes (NTs),62 Ge NWs,21 and Ge–Si core–shell (CS) NWs,21 compared to bulk values.45 Si films with various surface coatings68 are also shown: films with the native oxide removed (No OX), films which were thermally oxidized after the native oxide was removed (Therm. OX), and films with the native oxide present (Native OX). The thermal conductivities of sub-30 nm Ge and Ge–Si CS NWs and Si NTs approaches that of amorphous SiO2, and in the case of the ∼5 nm thick crystalline Si NTs, drops below this amorphous value, approaching the theoretical minimum value (κmin) for amorphous Si (a-Si).114 
Experimental study of the effects of surface coating on thin Si films,68 however, is of significant interest, particularly in comparison to the results of MD simulations discussed previously. In this study, three types of films with different surfaces were studied: (1) films with the native oxide removed (No OX), (2) films which were thermally oxidized after the native oxide was removed (Therm. OX), and (3) films with the native oxide present (Native OX). Just as predicted by MD simulations, films of type (1) had higher thermal conductivity; films of type (2) were slightly lower due to the smooth amorphous surface coating, and films of type (3) were the lowest since the native amorphous surface is rougher than its thermally grown counterpart (Fig. 8). The surface structure and composition had significantly stronger influence on the thermal conductivity as the film thickness was reduced due to the increasing influence of vibrational modes in the surface on the c-Si core, as discussed previously.


3.5.2 Si and Ge based nanowires. 
Of great interest has been the experimentally measured 22 nm diameter Si NW, with a thermal conductivity of ∼7 W m−1 K−1 (Fig. 8). The temperature dependence and low thermal conductivity, unlike that of thin Si films, have mostly remained unexplained by models invoking low dimensionality and altered phonon dispersion. Measurements on thin Si nano-beams34 supported by silica films have also exhibited significantly reduced thermal conductivity. Similarly, sub-30 nm diameter Ge NWs21 (Fig. 8) have thermal conductivity of ∼1.5–2.3 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K, highly reduced from bulk Ge (∼56 W m−1 K−1)45 and much lower than that of similar sized Si NWs,13,107 due to the larger atomic mass and reduced phonon velocities of Ge compared to Si. Interestingly, the thermal conductivities of the NWs are even lower than that of bulk Si63.5Ge36.5 alloy111,112 and larger diameter SiGe alloy NWs108 but similar to Si0.8Ge0.2 thin films113 despite the absence of alloy scattering.
Measurements of the thermal conductivity of thin Ge–Si CS NWs21 with ∼20 nm diameter (∼16 nm core and ∼2 nm shell) have shown significantly reduced the thermal conductivity, ranging from ∼1.1–2.6 W m−1 K−1 (Fig. 8). The CS NW thermal conductivity exhibited little to no temperature dependence, similar to observations from the previously discussed MD simulations, which is in contrast to the measured thermal conductivities of the ∼15–20 nm diameter Ge NWs. The Ge NW thermal conductivity is lower (higher) than that of the CS wires below (above) 300 K. This disparity in the temperature dependency can possibly be attributed to the dissimilarity in the phonon spectra of the core–shell and single-component NWs.21


3.5.3 Si nanotubes. 
The influence of surface effects on thermal conductivity can be further studied in systems where the surface to volume ratio is increased beyond that of NWs, such as in NT structures, similar to the effects seen in the previously discussed MD simulations. In NTs the surface area can be nearly twice that of NWs, significantly increasing the number of localized phonon modes in the system.79 Recently, the thermal conductivity of ultra-thin c-Si NTs was measured by the suspended micro-device technique.62 The average room temperature thermal conductivities of ∼5, 7, and 10 nm shell c-Si NTs were ∼1.1, 1.3, and 1.6 W m−1 K−1, respectively (Fig. 8). The thinnest NTs approached the theoretical minimum thermal conductivity (κmin)114 of amorphous Si, and were even lower than silica115 and similarly thin a-Si NTs by ∼30%, consequently dubbed as ‘sub-amorphous’ behaviour. As such, an argument can be made that in such thin structures, confinement of phonons, influence of the oxidized surfaces, and/or some other phenomena could alter the phonon group velocity in the c-Si NTs, causing the highly reduced thermal conductivity.

3.6 Elastic softening
As nanostructures shrink below a threshold size (<30 nm for Si), phonon vibrational modes interact strongly with surfaces. This leads to coupling of phonon modes with the fundamental flexural modes of the structure itself. This has been observed in thin c-Si films where one transverse acoustic phonon mode was converted to a flexural out-of-plane mode.67 As nanostructures become thinner, the range of frequencies for acoustic modes is reduced due to an average softening of the elastic moduli.67 The result is a reduction in phonon group velocity and, by extension, thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the nature of the surface, in terms of roughness or stiffness (via coating of a dissimilar material) or variation in atomic bonding, will directly influence phonon properties, as discussed in the previous section on thermal measurements. Elastic softening due to surface coupling has a significant effect on phonons and, subsequently, the material properties of many thin nanomaterials which must be considered when integrating them into devices.
Tensile elastic measurements on individual c-Si and a-Si NTs found that the elastic moduli of ∼5 nm c-Si NTs were ∼30 GPa,62 a 6-fold reduction from bulk and large diameter Si NWs69 and nearly half that of ∼5 nm thin a-Si NTs, ∼60 GPa. Furthermore, comparison of speed of sound approximations of the 5 nm c-Si NTs and c-Si NWs13 showed a close correlation between the thermal conductivity and elastic properties (Fig. 9(a)). This correlation showed two interesting regimes: (1) diffusive boundary scattering at the surfaces dominates in Si structures larger than ∼30 nm, which corresponds to the Casimir limit. (2) Large deviations from the Casimir limit occur as Si structures shrink below ∼30 nm, indicating increasingly strong reductions in the phonon group velocity due to softening of the effective elastic constants. This is similar to the previously mentioned softening observed in Si cantilevers70,71 and InSb NWs,72 but likely originates from the same phenomena observed in sub-30 nm Si films17,67,68 and possibly due to the thin native oxide coating71,116 and/or surface roughness on the scale of the lattice constant. Other possible causes are the lower coordination numbers and electron densities of surface atoms than bulk atoms71 as well as compressive surface stresses which require atomic reorganization and bond lengthening at the surface.117
 Fig. 9  (a) Elastic softening in crystalline Si nanowires (NWs) and nanotubes (NTs). The elastic modulus, E, is reduced from the bulk value (horizontal dashed line) as the thickness, D, of the nanostructure falls below 30 nm. This results in a reduction in the thermal conductivity, κ, due to the lower phonon group velocity, represented as κ/D. The dashed line, in terms of κ/D, represents where κ is limited only by the size of the nanostructure, otherwise known as the boundary scattering or Casimir limit. * denotes normalized to bulk values. (b) Mean square atomic vibrational displacement, u, as a function of distance, d, from the surface of (c) a crystalline PbS nanoparticle (NP). Atomic displacements at the surface are much large than in the core of the NP due to mechanical softening of the surface.

The observed correlation between the thermal conductivity and elastic modulus may help offer an explanation for the low thermal conductivity of the 22 nm diameter NW,13 which has eluded other theoretical explanations. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of c-Si NTs with amorphous layers on both inner and outer surfaces showed that the thermal conductivity and elastic modulus decreased as larger degrees of roughness were added to the crystalline/amorphous interface. Analysis of the vibrational density of states showed that the amorphous coatings were significantly subdued in the high frequency regime compared to the crystalline layer and the entire frequency range was down-shifted, exhibiting a large vibrational mismatch between the crystalline and amorphous layers as seen in other simulations.78,118 This should lead to strong phonon scattering at the crystalline/amorphous interface due to the appearance of new vibrational states.78 Conversely, as amorphous silica shares more vibrational modes in common with a-Si than with c-Si, the introduction of surface modes is likely to have a much weaker effect on the thermal conductivity in the fully amorphous NTs.
Surface induced mechanical softening can have a strong effect on the properties of nanoparticles (NPs) as well and can directly affect the performance of devices incorporating them. Using inelastic neutron scattering, the mean-square atomic vibrational displacements, u2 in crystalline PbS NPs were found to be significantly larger at the NP surface (Fig. 9(b) and (c)).119 These larger displacements suggested that the strength, or spring constant (Ks ≈ kBT/u2), of atomic bonding at the surface is reduced, leading to softer surfaces. This softness facilitated large amounts of low frequency phonon modes and enhanced all phonon interactions, such as phonon–electron coupling. This coupling is undesirable for many electronic devices (LEDs, solar cells, etc.) but could be useful for others which depend of phonon interactions (superconductors, thermoelectrics, etc.). In either case, surface softening has a large effect on phonon behaviour and can impact many material properties through phonon interactions. The use of coating materials to engineer the surface properties/stiffness could potentially be used to mitigate these phonon interactions, similar to the previous discussions on film and NW coatings.
4. Conclusions and outlook
While experiments on structure size in the boundary scattering regime have been successful at developing our understanding of the effect of reducing the phonon MFP on thermal conductivity, less work has been done on thin structures where phonon modes couple with surfaces. In this regime, nanomaterial properties are largely influenced, and in some case overwhelmingly dictated, by surface effects, which can greatly alter the physical properties of the material from bulk behaviour. Yet only recently have measurements on sub-30 nm nanostructures gained renewed interest, thanks to the development of atomistic simulations, advanced material synthesis, and high-resolution measurement techniques. These studies have led to deeper understanding of phonon dynamics and transport in nanostructures in the ‘confinement’ regime, specifically one-dimensional structures such as NWs and NTs.
In this sub-30 nm ‘confinement’ regime, many questions regarding thermal transport behaviour remain. As structure size approaches the size of a single to a few nanometres, the same scale as the phonon wavelength, surface and interface atoms will dominate the physical properties. Studying different materials at this range can extend our understanding of thermal transport, specifically at the atomic scale and possibly elucidate new physical phenomena, such as the observed sub-amorphous and elastic softening behaviours. For thin films, while thermal conductivity can be theoretically predicted, explanations for the experimentally measured reductions in flexural mode velocities are still required, as well as the effect of surface oxides and roughness on elastic constants. For NWs, the behaviour at sub-30 nm diameters proved difficult to explain, yet in conjunction with recent results of thin films and thin-shelled NTs, some common phenomena are present, such as reduced elastic modulus and the increasing importance of surface morphology, such as oxides and roughness. Currently, more experimental effort is needed to understand thermal properties at sub-30 nm length scales and the effects of interfaces, surfaces, and coatings. Specific areas that should prove useful toward answering many questions include studies of: (1) core–shell NWs, specifically with ultra-thin NWs and varied coating thicknesses; (2) thinner NWs, in the sub-10 nm range, and of varying materials (Si, Ge, etc.); and (3) understanding how other nanoscale phenomena develop, such as elastic softening and possibly altered heat capacity, and how these affect thermal transport. Because of the important role played by the exact nature of the surface in the sub-30 nm regime, it is then plausible to use surface chemistry to control thermal conductivity, i.e., by applying various surface treatments such as chemical functionalization120–122 on the pristine nanomaterials which can effectively tune phonon dispersion and MFP. Such approach has not been systematically exploited but could lead to exciting prospect of tuning thermal transport via surface chemistry.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Size (D) dependent thermal transport mechanisms. Three regimes are categorised by comparison of physical size and characteristic lengths (MFP, Λ and wavelength, λ) of phonons. Examples of materials are presented side-by-side corresponding to each regime. (b) Contribution of MFP to thermal conductivity at 300 K for Si, Ge, Si0.5Ge0.5 and Bi2Te3 bulk materials. Red region indicates MFP range which corresponds to 80% contribution to thermal conductivity. Yellow spots show when accumulative contribution reaches 50% of total thermal conductivity.	 

 	Fig. 2  Representative normalized thermal conductivity (κ) vs. film thickness or NW diameter for Si15,35–43 and Ge46 films and nanowires (NWs)13,21 at 300 K. The thermal conductivity of Si films and NWs decreases with decreasing film thickness from bulk values45 at the micron scale to an almost ten-fold reduction for 20 nm thick films. A similar trend can be observed in the thermal conductivity of Ge films and NWs, however, the actual thermal conductivities are lower than in Si due to the heavier atomic mass of Ge, which reduces phonon velocity. For thin films, Landauer formula based model47 is used to calculate thickness dependent thermal conductivity. The result for Si films (black solid line) shows good agreement for films thicker than 50 nm. For NWs, modified Holland's model48,49 fits well for Si NWs (black dash line) down to 37 nm at 300 K. The deviation between model and experiment for the 22 nm Si NW may imply the modification of phonon dispersion and scattering at this length scale.

 	Fig. 8  Size dependent thermal conductivities of crystalline Si films,15,35–44 nanowires (NWs),13 and nanotubes (NTs),62 Ge NWs,21 and Ge–Si core–shell (CS) NWs,21 compared to bulk values.45 Si films with various surface coatings68 are also shown: films with the native oxide removed (No OX), films which were thermally oxidized after the native oxide was removed (Therm. OX), and films with the native oxide present (Native OX). The thermal conductivities of sub-30 nm Ge and Ge–Si CS NWs and Si NTs approaches that of amorphous SiO2, and in the case of the ∼5 nm thick crystalline Si NTs, drops below this amorphous value, approaching the theoretical minimum value (κmin) for amorphous Si (a-Si).114	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) Elastic softening in crystalline Si nanowires (NWs) and nanotubes (NTs). The elastic modulus, E, is reduced from the bulk value (horizontal dashed line) as the thickness, D, of the nanostructure falls below 30 nm. This results in a reduction in the thermal conductivity, κ, due to the lower phonon group velocity, represented as κ/D. The dashed line, in terms of κ/D, represents where κ is limited only by the size of the nanostructure, otherwise known as the boundary scattering or Casimir limit. * denotes normalized to bulk values. (b) Mean square atomic vibrational displacement, u, as a function of distance, d, from the surface of (c) a crystalline PbS nanoparticle (NP). Atomic displacements at the surface are much large than in the core of the NP due to mechanical softening of the surface.
