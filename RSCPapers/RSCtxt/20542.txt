Introduction
Tremendous efforts have been put into the study of polymer solar cells (PSCs) over recent decades for the purpose of utilizing solar energy and solving the energy crisis.1–4 Before 2016, most studies focused on the design of donor polymers in combination with fullerene derivatives (the electron acceptor) to serve as the photoactive layer. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs employing a polymer–fullerene system reached 11%.5 However, the weak absorption in the visible region and the restricted variation in the bandgap of fullerene derivatives inevitably limit further improvement of the PCE in PSCs. In the last three years, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which posess tunable energy levels, adjustable absorption properties and flexible structural modification, can overcome the shortage of fullerene derivatives and have attracted considerable attention.6–8 Representative examples are A–D–A type fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) with a central core composed of fused aromatic rings, with or without two flanked bridging units, and with two strong electron-withdrawing end groups.9–15 In this type of FREA, planar extended donor cores play a very significant role and various kinds of cores have been studied.11,14,16–19 Zhan et al. reported A–D–A type NFAs earlier using an extended fused-ring indacenodithiophene (IDT) or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as central building blocks, such as IDIC and ITIC.20–22 On the one hand, the central core unit can facilitate the delocalization of π-electrons, narrowing the bandgap and extending the light absorption range.23–25 Moreover, the large coplanar geometry and the rigid structure of the central core unit will help to lower the reorganization energy; the side chains on the central ladder-type core can prevent them from forming undesired H-type aggregation; and the flat conformation of the terminal groups can facilitate their overlapping and achieve high electron mobility.13,21,26–29 Further enlarging the size of the central ladder-type core can expand the absorption to the near-infrared (NIR) region and enhance the charge transport, which should be a wise choice for constructing highly efficient FREAs.26,30 However, only few reports deal with large fused-ring cores such as the nonacyclic core,31,32 the decacyclic core,32,33 and the undecacyclic core.28,34
In our previous work, different to the dominantly reported NFAs with trans-arranged side chains, we developed a novel NFA molecule (IDIDT-C8) with a fused pentacyclic core bearing four aliphatic chains at the same side and a decent PCE has been achieved.35 Here, based on the IDIDT-C8 core unit, we further designed a novel nonacyclic core with eight side chains and IC(2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile) and DFIC(2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile) were chosen as end groups to construct two NFAs, IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F, respectively. As previously reported, fluorination of the end groups (IC) can broaden the absorption of the acceptor and can improve electron mobility via enhanced intermolecular interaction.31,36 The chemical structures of two new acceptors IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F are shown in Fig. 1. Their optical and electrochemical properties, blend film morphologies, and device performances are systematically investigated. When paired with the polymer donor poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T)37 (Fig. 1), the PCEs of IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F based PSCs can reach 9.79% and 11.29%, respectively. Their performances are comparable to that of ITIC, especially with a higher Voc.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route to IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F is shown in Scheme S1 (see the ESI†). Compound 2 is synthesized according to the literature procedure.30 The treatment of 2 with 4-hexylphenyllithium afforded an alcohol intermediate, which converted to DIDTT in a yield of 29% via a ring closure reaction. The abstraction of two protons at the α-position of the thiophene unit afforded dianions, which were quenched with DMF to afford the dialdehyde intermediate DIDTT-CHO in a yield of 51%. The target molecules IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F were obtained in yields of 69% and 63% by Knoevenagel condensation of DIDTT-CHO with IC and DFIC, respectively. Both IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF) and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The chemical structures of IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F were verified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (see the ESI†). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S1, ESI†) revealed that IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F show good thermal stabilities with 5% weight loss at approximately 337 and 336 °C, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed that there is no obvious glass transition for IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F in the temperature range of 80–300 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†).
The optimized molecular geometries of IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level using the Gaussian 09 package (Fig. S3, ESI†). The alkyl side chains were replaced by methyl groups for simplification. The calculation results showed that the backbone of both IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F possesses a coplanar geometry, which is in favour of extending the conjugation and improving the electron mobility.38 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributions and the calculated frontier orbital energies of IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The HOMO/LUMO wave functions of both molecules are well delocalized over the whole molecular backbones due to their highly coplanar conformation. The HOMO and the LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.23 and −3.19 eV for IDIDTT, −5.34 and −3.33 eV for IDIDTT-2F, respectively.
Photophysical properties and frontier energy levels
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy was used for investigating the absorption behaviours of IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F in chloroform solutions and as thin films and the spectra are shown in Fig. 2. In chloroform solution, IDIDTT exhibits a broad absorption band ranging from 600 to 800 nm with a peak at 719 nm and the maximum extinction coefficient (εmax) is 2.21 × 105 M−1 cm−1. The film absorption spectrum of IDIDTT is quite similar to that of its solution one, indicating that IDIDTT shows a weak interaction in the solid state. Compared with IDIDTT, IDIDTT-2F in chloroform solution showed a slightly red-shifted absorption band with a peak at 739 nm (with a εmax of 2.50 × 105 M−1 cm−1), which is attributed to the enhanced intramolecular charge-transfer transition due to the introduction of two fluoro atoms at the terminal group.36 While moving from the solution to film state, IDIDTT-2F showed a red-shift at approximately 20 nm for the main absorption peak, indicating that the fluorinated terminal groups can stack more closely.36 The film absorption spectrum of PBDB-T is also shown in Fig. 2b for comparison, whose absorption is complementary to that of IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F. Based on their absorption onsets, the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F are estimated to be 1.57 and 1.46 eV, respectively.

The energy levels of IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the CV curves are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −5.50 eV/−3.84 eV for IDIDTT and −5.51 eV/−3.96 eV for IDIDTT-2F based on the onset of the oxidation and reduction curves using the equation EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eonset,ox/red + 4.71).39 The energy level diagrams of IDIDTT, IDIDTT-2F and PBDB-T are shown in Fig. 3. We have found that the introduction of two fluoro atoms at the terminal group mainly lowers the LUMO energy level. The absorption data and the energy levels are summarized in Table 1.

Photovoltaic properties
PSCs with an inverted structure of ITO/zinc oxide (ZnO) (30 nm)/active layers (PBDB-T:IDIDTT or IDIDTT-2F) (90 nm)/MoO3 (85 Å)/Ag (100 nm) were fabricated and evaluated. The solvent, additive, weight ratio (donor to acceptor), and the spin coating rate were systematically screened. The detailed process description can be found in the ESI.† The optimized donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio for IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F based devices is 1:1 (w/w) and the appropriate processing solvent is DCB. The optimal additives are 0.2 wt% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 0.3 wt% o-chlorobenzaldehyde (CBA) for IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F, respectively. Conversely, CBA has little effect on improving the efficiency of the IDIDTT-based device and DIO on the IDIDTT-2F-based device. The data are shown in Tables S1–S6 (ESI†). The absolute fluorescence quantum yields (ηFL) of IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F in chloroform solutions were measured to be 33.0% and 26.6%. Similar but less-fused compound IDIDT-C8 was also measured and only shows a ηFL of 11.34%.35 The higher fluorescence quantum yields for IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F showed that larger fused ring structures could reduce the nonradiative energy losses.10 The energy loss (Eloss), which can be calculated using the formula Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc,40 is 0.45 eV for the IDIDTT-based device and 0.50 eV for the IDIDTT-2F-based device. Here, Eoptg is determined from the corresponding blend film after solvent additive treatment (Fig. S5 and Table S7, ESI†).40 The as-cast PBDB-T:IDIDTT-based devices exhibit a PCE of 8.91% with a Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 14.03 mA cm−2 and an FF of 64.13%. The as-cast IDIDTT-2F-based devices exhibited a higher PCE of 10.21% with a Jsc of 17.41 mA cm−2. After the addition of additives, both IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F-based PSCs showed improvements in Jsc, and the PCEs were finally boosted to 9.79% and 11.29%, respectively. Such an obvious device performance improvement is mainly due to the optimized morphology of the active layer after the addition of a small amount of additive. The device performances are summarized in Table 2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. Besides, the ITIC-based devices were also systematically optimized in our lab for comparison,41 and an optimal PCE of 9.64% was obtained (Table 2). The result indicated that the IDIDTT/IDIDTT-2F has a comparable performance to ITIC, especially possessing a higher Voc. It is noted that the PCE of our control devices was slightly lower than those of the reported ones, which might be assigned to the different batches of polymers (Table S8, ESI†).42 The IDIDTT-based devices exhibited a strong response in the range of 300 to 850 nm and the maximum EQE value reaches 73%, whereas IDIDTT-2F-based devices showed a slightly broader photoelectric response in the range of 300 to 870 nm with the maximum EQE value reaching 79%. The broad EQE response for IDIDTT-2F is in good agreement with its broader absorption.

The EQE curves clearly demonstrate that the absorption bands of both the donor and the acceptor are attributed to the photo-generated charge carriers. The Jsc values obtained by integrating the EQE curves with an AM1.5 G reference spectrum are in good agreement (within 5% error) with the ones obtained by J–V measurements.
PL quenching experiments
Photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were performed to understand the charge transfer behavior in the blend films. The PL spectra of the PBDB-T, IDIDTT, IDIDTT-2F neat films and PBDB-T:IDIDTT, PBDB-T:IDIDTT-2F blend films with or without solvent additive were measured. As shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†), the films were firstly excited at 530 nm to excite PBDB-T, and the PL peaks of PBDB-T were strongly quenched in both blends films (in the range of 650–700 nm), indicating efficient charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor. Then, the films were excited at 650 nm to selectively excite the acceptors and the PL quenching is efficient for both blend films, suggesting efficient charge transfer from the acceptor to the donor (Fig. S6b, ESI†). What's more, the PL quenching of both IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F in the blend films processed with additives was slightly higher than that of those processed without additives, indicating that more effective photo-induced charge transfer occurred in the blend film, which is beneficial for achieving a higher Jsc.
Charge mobilities
The hole and electron mobilities of these two acceptor-based blends films were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S9 (ESI†), the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the IDIDTT-based devices were calculated to be 6.03 × 10−5 and 4.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, whereas those of the IDIDTT-2F-based devices were calculated to be 2.27 × 10−4 and 1.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The devices fabricated with additives exhibited enhanced charge mobilities with μh/μe of 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/5.06 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDB-T:IDIDTT and 4.83 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/1.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDB-T:IDIDTT-2F. The higher charge mobility of the PBDB-T:IDIDTT-2F blend films is beneficial for achieving higher Jsc values in devices.
To gain insights into charge recombination in the active layers, light intensity-dependent photocurrent measurements were carried out for the optimized devices. Jsc under illumination of different incident light intensities (P) was measured and the power-law dependence of Jsc on light intensity was determined as Jsc ∝ Pα. It is noted that the Jsc of the studied device increases linearly with light intensity. Under extreme conditions, α is equal to 0.75 when the space charge built reaches the fundamental limit, while it is equal to 1 when no space charge exists.43 So under short-circuit conditions, the exponential factor α is an indicator of the extent of bimolecular recombination.43 As shown in Fig. 4c, the α values of the IDIDTT (with 0.2% DIO)-based devices and the IDIDTT-2F (with 0.3% CBA) based ones are 0.91 and 0.96, respectively, suggesting that bimolecular charge recombination under short circuit conditions in the IDIDTT-2F-based devices is insignificant and is less than that in IDIDTT-based ones.44
Morphology characterization
We first utilized atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping-mode to investigate the morphology of the blend films (Fig. 5 and Fig. S8, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5, all the blend films exhibited a smooth surface morphology with the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value being slightly increased after adding additives. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization is also conducted and shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the PBDB-T:IDIDTT blend film shows well-developed fibrous features, which were formed from the aggregation of PBDB-T.45 The PBDB-T:IDIDTT-2F blend films showed a similar nanomorphology but with thicker fibrils. There is no marked difference for the morphologies in blend films without and with additives.

The molecular packing in the neat acceptor films and blend films was studied by using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)46 and the scattering profiles are shown in Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 7a, the neat film of IDIDTT showed a relatively intense (010) diffraction peak at 1.53 Å−1 with a coherence length (CL) of 12.6 Å in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, whereas the neat film of IDIDTT-2F showed a strong (010) diffraction peak at 1.48 Å−1 with a CL of 24.9 Å in the OOP direction and a high-order lamellar stacking (500) peak emerged in the in-plane direction, indicating that IDIDTT-2F has higher crystallinity.47 Moreover, both the PBDB-T:IDIDTT and PBDB-T:IDIDTT-2F blend films exhibited a “face-on” dominated orientation with π–π stacking peaks located at 1.70 Å−1 and 1.69 Å−1, respectively. The “face-on” orientation is thought to favor the vertical charge transport across the electrodes.48,49 Notably, as can be seen from the PBDB-T:IDIDTT blends without and with DIO, the (100) scattering signal of IDIDTT arises due to the effect of DIO, which indicates that there is ordered IDIDTT packing along with the out-of-plane direction. The phase separation in the optimized PBDB-T:IDIDTT and PBDB-T:IDIDTT-2F blend films was investigated by resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) using a photon energy of 285.2 eV.50,51 The domain sizes of 21 and 24 nm were found in PBDB-T:IDIDTT with 0.2% DIO and PBDB-T:IDIDTT-2F with 0.3% CBA blended films, respectively (Fig. S9, ESI†), and both of them are within the range of efficient charge separation. What's more, the relative domain purity of PBDB-T:IDIDTT with 0.2% DIO and PBDB-T:IDIDTT-2F with 0.3% CBA is calculated to be 0.96 and 1, respectively. The increase of domain purity helps to suppress the bimolecular recombination and promote charge transport, which agrees well with device performance.52

Conclusion
In conclusion, two NFAs (IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F) with a novel nonacyclic core (DIDTT) which bears eight side chains were synthesized and investigated. The rigid coplanar geometry of these two acceptors could reduce the nonradiative energy losses. Over 10% PCE along with high Voc (>0.9 V) was obtained for IDIDTT and IDIDTT-2F based PSCs. In particular, IDIDTT-2F-based devices afforded a maximum PCE of 11.29% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 19.79 mA cm−2 and FF of 61.85%, which is among the highest efficiencies of large FREAs. This result demonstrates that the nonacyclic core-based FREAs could be promising in achieving high performance polymer solar cells.
