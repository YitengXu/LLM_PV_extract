    , Accepted 15th February 2023First published on 16th February 2023AbstractLow-dimensional metal halide perovskites have become emerging candidates for applications in light emitting diodes due to the quantum confinement effect by tuning their composition and structure. However, they suffer from longstanding issues of environmental stability and lead toxicity. Herein, we report phosphorescent manganese halides, (TEM)2MnBr4 (TEM = HN(CH2CH3)3, triethylammonium) and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] (IM = C3H6N2, imidazolium) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 50% and 7%, respectively. (TEM)2MnBr4 with a tetrahedral configuration exhibits brilliant green light emission centered at 528 nm, while the (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] compound, in which octahedral and tetrahedral units coexist, exhibits red colored emission at 615 nm. The excited state of (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] is found to exhibit distinct photophysical emission characteristics consistent with triplet state phosphorescence. Efficient phosphorescence was achieved with a long lifetime of several milliseconds, 0.38 ms for (TEM)2MnBr4 and 5.54 ms for (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6], at room temperature. By studying the temperature dependent PL and single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements and comparing our results with those of previously reported analogues, we have found a direct correlation between Mn⋯Mn distances and PL emission. Our study reveals that the long distance between the Mn centers has made a significant contribution to the long-lived phosphorescence with a highly emissive triplet state.
1. Introduction
Hybrid metal halides have attracted much attention as a superior class of semiconducting materials because of their enabling optoelectronic properties especially in the field of solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers and detectors. For example, 3D metal halide perovskites, which are formulated as AMX3 (A = CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+, Cs+; M = Ge2+, Sn2+, Pb2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−), exhibit power conversion efficiencies of more than 25% in photovoltaic application.1 Low-dimensional (1D/2D) hybrid halide perovskites have proved to be effective materials to emit white light in LED devices. However, there are still issues such as poor device stability and environmental concerns regarding toxicity due to Pb2+, which constrained their further development and application in optoelectronic devices.
Targeting to solve the above issues, manganese halides are promising since divalent manganese has long been used as an effective luminescent center, whose luminescence originates from its intrinsic d–d transition,2 making them potential candidates for use in LED devices owing to their exceptional material properties such as high emissive quantum yield, large Stokes shift, and strong excitation bands. Mn has been widely used as a dopant because the sp–d interaction between hosts and Mn dopants is known to enhance quantum confinement. The Mn2+ dopant is not only widely known for stabilizing the perovskite phase, but also provides efficient dual-band emission from efficient exciton energy transfer between semiconductor hosts and Mn2+ dopants. For example, Mn doped CsPbX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) perovskites exhibit dual band emission by controlling the halide composition due to the influence of the transition energy difference between the Mn ion and the semiconductor host.3–5
Moreover, according to the coordination environment of MnII, the distinctive emission of Mn2+ strongly depends on the coordination environment of Mn2+, due to the d–d 4T1 (G) → 6A1 transition; the emission color is green and red for tetrahedral and octahedral coordination of MnII,6–8 respectively, attributed to the different crystal field strength, which exactly results from the combination of two colors in the three primary colors from the composition of white light. A highly stable manganese(II) complex with peculiar five-coordinated modes exhibits yellow emission with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 93%.9 Recently, enantiomorphic hybrid manganese bromides have been prepared using chiral (R/S) alkanolammonium cations and applied in circularly polarized luminescence materials showing a high emission dissymmetry factor and PLQY.10 Besides, Mn2+ complexes exhibit polymorphic luminescence, for example, the [Mn(XantphosO2)Br2] complex exhibits polymorphic luminescence and crystallizes in the P and P21/n space groups, displaying green and yellow emissions with a PLQY of 33% and 50%, respectively.11 [MnX2(L)]n (X = Cl, Br, I) bridged by 1,7-[Ph2P(O)]2-meta-carborane ligands (L) through the O–Mn–O linkages shows green emission with a PLQY of up to 60%.12 These compounds exhibit thermochromic luminescence according to the change of temperature from 350 K to 77 K. Moreover, a Mn-based hybrid metal halide, C4H14N2MnBr4, exhibits dual emission bands at 516 nm and 623 nm, which are related to the d–d transition of Mn2+ radiation and self-trapped excitons, respectively.13 However, despite the current effort, the mechanism for light emission in manganese-based halide materials is still evolving, and to date, very few reported papers have been found on light emission in manganese-based halide structures at room temperature.8,14,15
Herein, we demonstrated lead-free phosphorescent 0D manganese halides, (TEM)2MnBr4 (TEM = HN(CH2CH3)3, triethylammonium) and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] (IM = C3H6N2, imidazolium), with a PLQY of 50% and 7%, respectively. (TEM)2MnBr4 with a tetrahedral configuration exhibits brilliant green light emission centered at 528 nm, while the (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6]compound, in which octahedral and tetrahedral units coexist, exhibits red colored emission at 615 nm. The excited state of (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] is found to exhibit distinct photophysical emission characteristics, consistent with triplet state phosphorescence. Efficient phosphorescence was achieved with a long lifetime of several milliseconds, 0.38 ms for (TEM)2MnBr4 and 5.54 ms for (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6], at room temperature. We performed low temperature PL measurements on both (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] and observed the phase transition according to the variation of temperature. Thus, single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was also performed to gain deeper insight into the correlation between structures and optical properties.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Starting materials
MnBr2 (99%, anhydrous), MnCl2 (97%), triethylamine ((C2H5)3N, 99%) and imidazole (C3H4N2, 99%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Hydrobromic acid (HBr, reagent grade, 48%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%) and hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2 and 50 wt% in H2O) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and they were used without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of perovskites
For (TEM)2MnBr4, 5 mmol (1.074 g) of MnBr2 powder was dissolved in 1 mL of HBr in a 30 mL glass volumetric flask by heating it to 200 °C under constant magnetic stirring for 5 minutes, which formed a clear solution. 10 mmol (1.012 g) of triethylamine was then directly added into the MnBr2 solution. Stirring was continued until the solution became completely clear, and then stirring was discontinued, heating was stopped, and the solution was left to cool while pale green colored plate crystals precipitated on the bottom of the flask. The crystals were collected using suction filtration and dried using a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 hours. A yield of 70% was estimated in relation to Mn. (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] was prepared by the same method as above except that 5 mmol (0.340 g) of imidazole was used as a cation instead of triethylamine. The yield was 65% based on the total Mn content. (TEM)2MnCl4 and (IM)2[MnCl4]2 compounds were prepared by the same method as above except that 5 mmol (0.629 g) of MnCl2 was dissolved in 1 mL of HCl solution. The respective yields were 69% and 62%.

2.3. Characterization

Powder X-ray diffraction measurements and single crystal X-ray diffraction. 
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses were conducted at room temperature using the Panalytical Empyrean XRD system. The measurement parameters were as follows: tube current 30 mA and voltage 40 kV; scan axis gonio; step size 0.013°2θ; time per step 48 s. Single crystal diffraction measurements were performed in the BL2D-SMC at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. The BL2D-SMC at the Pohang Light Source II is a supramolecular crystallography beamline. A perovskite crystal was coated with Paratone-N oil, and the diffraction data were obtained at 100 K and 298 K under synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.61000 Å) on an ADSC Quantum-210 detector at the BL2D SMC with a silicon (111) double crystal monochromator (DCM). The PAL BL2D-SMDC program16 was used for data collection, which included a detector distance of 63 mm, an omega scan Δω = 3°, and an exposure time of 1 second per frame, and the HKL3000sm (Ver. 703r)17 was used for the cell refinement, reduction, and absorption correction. The crystal structure of the perovskites was solved using direct methods with the SHELXT-2014 program18 and refined using the full-matrix least-squares calculations with the SHELXL-2014 program package.19


Optical absorption spectroscopy. 
The optical properties of the perovskites were determined using an Agilent Cary-5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The reflectance data versus the wavelength data that were generated were used to estimate the band gap of the materials by converting the reflectance data into the absorption data according to the Kubelka−Munk equation:20,21α/S = (1 − R)2(2R)−1,where R is the reflectance, and α and S are the absorption and scattering coefficients, respectively.


Static and temperature dependent photoluminescence, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). 
The emission and excitation photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskitoids were recorded at room temperature on a FluoroMate FS-2 fluorescence spectrometer (Scinco, Republic of Korea). The temperature dependent PL measurements were conducted using a high PL spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer) equipped with a helium cryostat (Linkam) at temperatures ranging from 10 K to 300 K. A 514 nm laser with a power of 3 μW was used to excite the perovskitoids. Time-resolved phosphorescence study was performed using a spectrometer (MicroTime-200, Picoquant, Germany). The lifetime measurements were performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Daegu Center, Korea. A single-mode pulsed diode laser (375 nm with a pulse width of ∼30 ps and an average power of <100 nW) was used as an excitation source. A dichroic mirror (Z375RDC, AHF), a longpass filter (HQ405lp, AHF), and a single photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD) were used to collect emission from the samples. The time-correlated single-photon counting system (TimeHarp-260, PicoQuant GmbH, Germany) was used to count emission photons in a 75 ms time window. Exponential fitting for the obtained phosphorescence decay was performed using Symphotime-64 software (Ver. 2.2). The steady-state phosphorescence spectrum was obtained by dividing and guiding emission photons through an optical fiber to an external spectrometer (F-7000, Hitachi) under 470 nm laser irradiation. The phosphorescence quantum yield (PLQY) was also determined under 470 nm excitation using a spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy images were captured using the Leica Application Suite X software on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP5) using a confocal dish. Pulsed diode lasers, 514 nm and 633 nm for (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)3MnBr5, respectively, were used for excitation. The excitation power and the gain were chosen to optimize the dynamic range of the detector (photomultiplier tube, Leica HyD, or Leica HyD SMD).


Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. 
DSC analysis was carried out on a DSC 214 Polyma from NETZSCH, Germany, under a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range of −150 °C to 25 °C.

3. Results and discussion
The crystals of (TEM)2MnBr4 (TEM = HN(CH2CH3)3, triethylammonium) and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] (IM = C3H6N2, imidazolium) have been prepared by a facile solution process, exhibiting green and red emission under UV light. The crystal structures of the obtained manganese halides were determined by single crystal XRD spectroscopy and the detailed crystallographic refinements are shown in Table 1. Fig. 1 and 2 display the crystal structures of (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)3MnBr5, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, for (TEM)2MnBr4, it crystallizes in the triclinic form with the space group P at 100 K (Fig. 1a). The crystal structure consists of cationic triethylammonium and an anionic tetrahedrally coordinated complex [MnBr4]2−. One Mn atom is surrounded by four Br− forming tetrahedral [MnBr4]2−. The tetrahedra are isolated from each other and separated by large [HN(CH2CH3)3]+ cations, forming a 0D structure at the molecular level and these 0D structures extend in a 3D space following the crystal structure of triclinic P. The [HN(CH2CH3)3]+ cations then link the tetrahedral [MnBr4]2− complex via hydrogen bonding. As mentioned in a previous report,22 TEM is a monovalent (+1) cation and it requires two TEM cations to charge balance the MnBr42− perovskite tetrahedra, which leads to a distance between the MnBr42− tetrahedra. This can be seen in Fig. 1b, where the Mn–Mn distances are 8.85 Å, 8.97 Å, 9.31 Å and 10.47 Å at 100 K. Hence, the distance of Mn–Mn in (TEM)2MnBr4 is sufficiently long, showing that no Mn–Mn direct coupling exists, which is related to the emission of the d–d transition.23 At 298 K, (TEM)2MnBr4 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P21/c with lattice parameters a = 13.149(3) Å, b = 12.377(3) Å, c = 13.958(3) Å, α = γ = 90°, and β = 96.28(3)° (Fig. 1c). Compared to the structure at 100 K, the Mn–Mn distances decreased at 298 K (Fig. 1d) caused by the increase of the interactions between [HN(CH2CH3)3]+ cations and MnBr42− tetrahedra. For (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6], as shown in Fig. 2a, the tetrahedral and octahedral units coexist alternatively for every two units. Since the imidazolium rings are intercalated between the tetrahedral ([MnBr4]2−) and octahedral ([MnBr6]4−) layers, it can be observed that the variation of Mn–Mn distances in (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] is minimal. As such, comparing these (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] unit cells, it can be surmised that (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] has a larger unit cell, while it is more symmetric in terms of Mn–Mn distances (8.78 Å and 8.89 Å) (Fig. 2b), and thus, in contrast to (TEM)2MnBr4, the Mn–Mn distances do not decrease at 298 K (8.88 Å and 8.94 Å) (Fig. 2c and d), which is attributed to the coexistence of the tetrahedral ([MnBr4]2−) and octahedral ([MnBr6]4−) layers as mentioned above. Herein, we also prepared (TEM)2MnCl4 and (IM)2[MnCl4]2 compounds from the corresponding aqueous hydrohalic acid solution of manganese chloride by combining them with TEM and IM organic cations, respectively. Single crystal XRD analyses were performed to compare them with [MnBr6]4−-based compounds containing the same organic molecules. The selected crystallographic information is presented in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 3a, (TEM)2MnCl4 crystallizes in the orthorhombic P212121 space group and every Mn is connected to four Cl to form a [MnCl4]2− tetrahedron, which is isolated from another tetrahedron by the TEM molecules forming a 0D structure at the molecular level. Compared to (TEM)2MnBr4, the Mn–Mn distances (7.95 Å, 8.21 Å and 8.76 Å) in the chain direction greatly decreased (Fig. 3b), which means less interactions in the transition energies of tetrahedrally coordinated Mn2+ ions due to the interference of the d–d transition, consequently resulting in a decrease of green emission. This fact can be rationalized by increased spin–orbit coupling interactions between [MnBr4]2− ions compared to those between [MnCl4]2− ions that lead to an increase in the emission intensity of the green component in the PL spectra of (TEM)2MnBr4.15

When we incorporated IM cations into Mn(II) in the MnCl2 matrix using the same method as that for preparing (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] except for using the MnCl2 compound, we obtained the (IM)2[MnCl4]2 compound, which crystallizes in the triclinic space group P. This structure is comprised of a 1D edge-sharing octahedral [MnCl6]4− inorganic framework, which is filled with two IM cations facing each other rotated 180 degrees (Fig. 3c). The edge sharing connectivity of octahedral [MnBr6]4− lies in place with neighboring layers twisted at an angle of 45 degrees to each other (Fig. 3d). (IM)2[MnCl4]2 shows a quite different crystal structure from the isolated Mn based structures in (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6]. We dried the (IM)2[MnCl4]2 compound in a vacuum oven for 24 h to remove all the solvate molecules completely. As shown in Fig. S1,† the (IM)2[MnCl4]2 compound shows weak red emission compared to (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6]. As shown in Fig. 3d, the crystal structure of (IM)2[MnCl4]2 consists of the 1D edge-sharing connectivity modes of the [MnCl6]4− octahedra. Thus, the Mn–Mn distance (3.66 Å) is very close, which causes the generation of Mn–Mn spin coupling. It increases the energy transfer, such as dipole–dipole interaction and spin-exchange interactions, between Mn centers.22 This effect can be viewed as the quenching effect by the energy transfer from the local exciton to neighboring transition ions, resulting in a decreased PLQY. Thus, low PL emission was observed in the (IM)2[MnCl4]2 compound. In addition, previously, we reported zigzag edge sharing (AMP)PbBr4 and (AMP)PbCl4 perovskites, in which the intensity of PL emission is less than that in the 3D perovskite because of intrinsic deformative structures.24 Due to the 1D structure and connectivity modes of the edge-sharing [MnCl6]4− octahedra, the (IM)2[MnCl4]2 compound has weak red emission compared to (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6].
The XRD patterns of the ground powders of (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] agree well with the simulated data extracted from single crystal XRD shown in Fig. S2,† indicating the high purity and uniformity of the as-prepared (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] crystals.

Fig. 4 shows the absorption and PL spectra of (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] under ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. 4a, the absorption peaks are attributed to the electronic transition from the 6A1 ground state of the Mn2+ ion to the different excited states in (TEM)2MnBr4. It shows two distinct groups of absorption bands in the range of the UV to visible region, which correspond to the electron transition of tetrahedrally coordinated Mn2+ ions. The first group of absorption bands, D-term states, corresponds to the strong ligand field splitting, whereas the second group of bands, G-term states, originates from the small ligand field splitting. Generally, the bands of the D-terms have much stronger intensities than those of the G-terms.25–27 In the absorption spectra of (TEM)2MnBr4, the intense absorption bands at 360, 376, 436, 453 and 466 nm, which correspond to the transition from the ground states 6A1(S) of tetrahedral Mn(II) to the excited states 4E(D), 4T2(D), 4A1, 4E(G), 4T2(G) and 4T1(G), respectively. These excited states are well known in the Mn2+ system (d5) which exhibits the ligand field splitting energy in the Tanabe–Sugano diagram.28,29 As shown in Fig. 4a, the excitation spectrum of the (TEM)2MnBr4 crystal shows five dominant excitation peaks centered at 364 and 377 nm which correspond to the electronic transitions from 6A1(S) → 4E(D) and 6A1(S) → 4T2(D) of Mn2+ in Td symmetries, respectively. The peaks at 439, 454, and 470 nm can be assigned to 6A1(S) → 4A1, 4E(G) and 6A1(S) → 4T2(G), 4T1(G) of Mn2+ in Td symmetries. The maximum green emission peak was observed at 528 nm when excited at 365 nm (Fig. 4c). The PLQY of (TEM)2MnBr4 is 50%, which is attributed to the Mn2+ environment in the crystal structure. The distance between the adjacent Mn2+ ions significantly regulates the luminescence color and PLQY. Thus, compared to (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] (PLQY 7%), (TEM)2MnBr4 shows a high PLQY due to the larger Mn–Mn distances which limit the transport of carriers between the MnBr4 clusters.30 All carriers in the excited states fall fully into localized traps, leading to an increase in the PLQY. Tetrahedrally coordinated trans-2,5-dimethylpiperazine manganese(II) bromide (C6N2H16MnBr4) exhibits green emission centered at 548 nm originating from the 4T1–6A1 transition of Mn2+ with a PLQY of 82%.31 This compound can be transformed into the non-emissive hydrate phase by the coordination of water molecules. The reversible transformation between the hydrated and dehydrated phases can be applied in the PL switch device. This result indicates that the emission properties strongly depend on the coordination of the Mn2+ complex.

For (IM)3MnBr5, two discrete groups of bands were observed (Fig. 4b), one group consists of two bands at 361 and 375 nm due to 6A1(S) → 4E(D) and 6A1(S) → 4T2(D), respectively, and the second group at a longer wavelength with transitions at 434 nm due to 6A1(S) → 4A1, 4E(G) and 452 nm due to 6A1(S) → 4T2(G), 4T1(G). The PL excitation spectra of (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] also supported the corresponding electronic transition. The excitation spectrum shows five dominant excitation peaks centered at 364, 377, 439, 454 and 470 nm corresponding to the electronic transitions from the 6A1(S) ground state to 4E(D), 4T2(D), 4A1, 4E(G), 4T2(G) and 4T1(G), respectively, which are assigned to the crystal-field transitions of Mn2+ within MnBr42−(Td) and MnBr64−(Oh), respectively.
The (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] compound shows strong red emission located at 615 nm when excited at 500 nm (Fig. 4d), which originates from the electronic transition of Mn2+ in the [MnBr6]4− octahedron. Interestingly, the green band emission from tetrahedrally coordinated [MnBr4]2− is not observed. This luminescence behavior can be explained by the energy transfer between the adjacent Mn centers due to the direct Mn–Mn coupling such as dipole–dipole and symmetry-directed spin exchange interactions.32 As per a previous literature33 report, the [Mn(dppeO2)3][MnBr4] compound exhibits only orange emission at 594 nm, even though it consists of an octahedral [Mn(dppeO2)3]2+ complex ligand and tetrahedral [MnBr4]2− geometry. Green emission is totally unobserved at room temperature. The reason is that intercomponent energy transfer takes place from high-lying [MnBr4]2− to low-lying [Mn(dppeO2)3]2+.15,34 If the energy transfer from [MnBr4]2− to [Mn(dppeO2)3]2+ is prohibited by lowering the temperature, only very weak green emission is observed. previous literature34 also reported that the Mn2+ emission feature is not conclusively restricted to Td and Oh coordination environments only. They proved the energy transfer from four-coordinated Mn2+ to seven-coordinated Mn2+ for [Mn(12C4)2][MnBr4]2[NMe4]2, where 12C4 = 12-crown-4. The active electronic interactions are responsible for the observed emission from coordinated Mn2+ cations. Thus, it is rationalized by intercomponent energy transfer from [MnBr4]2− to [MnBr6]4− ions that leads to the emission of only red color in the (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] compound, resulting in a lower PLQY of 7%. As shown in Fig. 4d, the shoulder peak was observed at around 675 nm. It arises from the change of the local electron environment around Mn2+ between [MnBr4]2− and [MnBr6]4−.35 Compared to individual Mn ions, the crystal lattice containing aggregated Mn ions shows dual band emission with a red-shift, which means that the Mn–Mn coupled pair or cluster rather than a single Mn ion generated the dual band emission.36
In the DSC trace shown in Fig. 5, the most interesting part of the thermal behavior of (TEM)2MnBr4 is that the structural phase transition temperature is close to room temperature. This change can be probed by DSC in the range of 124 K–298 K. When (TEM)2MnBr4 is heated in the first cycle (Fig. 5a), one exotherm and one endotherm are found at 277.45 K and 291.25 K, respectively. In the second heating process, it can be seen that the endotherm occurs at a similar temperature to that in the first cycle while one exotherm peak disappeared. However, since the reversible endotherm peak is very intense and little different from the general trend of the distinct phase transition peak,37 the phase transition of the (TEM)2MnBr4 compound from P at 100 K to P21/c at 298 K (Table 1) does not exert a significant influence on the physical properties. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 5b, the (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] compound exhibits one endotherm peak at 281.45 K in the first cycle. However, it disappeared in the second cycle, indicating the occurrence of an irreversible change. The endotherm peak in the first cycle corresponds to the impurity and the phase transition did not occur in the (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] compound.

To verify the radiation mechanism of these solid-state lighting materials, TRPL measurements were carried out to study the radiation lifetime. The PL decay curves could be well fitted to a single exponential function with the equation:  where I(t) is the time-resolved PL intensity, A is the amplitude as a normalized percentage, τ is the PL lifetime, and i is 1 in this study. The averaged lifetime, 〈τ〉, is defined by . The fitting parameters are summarized in Table 3. Consequently, the phosphorescence decay characteristics and lifetime are shown in Fig. 6. The (TEM)2MnBr4 compound exhibits a lifetime of 0.38 ms (Fig. 6a) and green color emission. On the other hand, the (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] system exhibits red emission and delivers a long PL lifetime of 5.54 ms (Fig. 6b), which is well consistent with the long lifetime due to the d–d transition in the solid Mn lattice in the previous report.25,36

As shown in Fig. 7a, the temperature dependent PL spectra of (TEM)2MnBr4 were recorded from 10 K to 298 K. The PL spectra consist of a dominating green band centered at around 535 nm. At 10 K, strong green emission was observed at 535 nm, whose intensity decreased at 50 K. However, the PL intensity increases with increasing temperature from 100 K to 150 K, suggesting the phase transition of the crystal structure from P to P21/c as evidenced by the endotherm peak at 294.75 K observed from the DSC curve of (TEM)2MnBr4 (Fig. 7a). As the temperature further increases, the intensity of PL emission decreases. Chen et al.38 demonstrated a green emission material, (C10H16N)2MnBr4, which exhibits a phase transition from solid to liquid at 430 K. As the temperature increases, the liberation of tetrahedra from the [(C10H16N)2] cation leads to the activation of the translation mobility of MnBr42− tetrahedra. This gives rise to collisions of MnBr42− with the [(C10H16N)2] cation, resulting in an increased non-radiative recombination rate. However, when the temperature decreases, strong green emission reappears.

For the (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] compound (Fig. 7b), a red band centered at 645–665 nm was observed. It can be assigned to the metal-centered transition within [MnBr6]4− of the octahedral (Oh) environment. With increasing temperature from 50 K to 100 K, the intensity of the PL spectra increased and then decreased on approaching room temperature. This result can be attributed to the stronger spin–orbit coupling interactions within [MnBr6]4− that changed the intensity ratio of red bands.
The light emission properties of the (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] hybrid manganese halides are shown in Fig. 8. The Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) color coordinates of these compounds exist almost at the same point in the red region of the 1931 color space chromaticity diagram as shown in Fig. 8a. The chromaticity coordinate and the correlated color temperature (CCT) were calculated using the ColorCalculator by OSRAM, Inc. (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] had chromaticity coordinates of (0.2721, 0.6594) and (0.6044, 0.3946), respectively (Table 4). The CCT of (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] was 1412 K, which indicated that these materials showed warm-light emission. The color rendering index (CRI) of (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] was 50, which is shown in Table 4. The (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] hybrid manganese halides had a PLQY of 50% and 7%. Compared to (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6], the reason for the high PLQY from (TEM)2MnBr4 can be ascribed to the isolated inorganic chain by the Mn–Mn distances, which increase the quantum confinement effect. From Fig. 8b, the (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] perovskitoids emit green and red photoluminescence under 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light at ambient temperature, respectively. Fig. 8c shows the emissions collected from the (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] nanoplates using confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. (TEM)2MnBr4 is highly emissive with green color and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] emits red color. It is noticed that the emission color evolution of (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] is only related to the [MnBr6]4− octahedral layers and independent of the [MnBr4]2− tetrahedra, because the green color was not observed in the (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] compound. In addition, for (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6], we also prepared the (IM)2[MnCl4]2 compound to compare the emission when an IM cation was incorporated into the MnCl2 matrix. We compared (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] with (IM)2[MnCl4]2 for the PL properties. As we can see in Fig. 8d, our compound (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] shows strong red emission but the (IM)2[MnCl4]2 compound shows very weak emission, indicating quite different crystal structures between them. We concluded that even though (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] and (IM)2[MnCl4]2 are synthesized in a similar manner with just different halogen elements, they are completely different compounds.

4. Conclusions
We demonstrated lead-free phosphorescent 0D manganese halides (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] with a PLQY of 50% and 7%, respectively. (TEM)2MnBr4 with a tetrahedral configuration exhibits brilliant green light emission centered at 528 nm, while the (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6]compound, in which octahedral and tetrahedral units coexist, exhibits red colored emission at 615 nm. The excited state of (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] is found to exhibit distinct photophysical emission characteristics, consistent with triplet state phosphorescence. Efficient phosphorescence was achieved with a long lifetime of several milliseconds, 0.38 ms for (TEM)2MnBr4 and 5.54 ms for (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6], at room temperature. We performed low temperature PL measurements on both (TEM)2MnBr4 and (IM)6[MnBr4][MnBr6] according to the variation of temperature. In addition, single-crystal XRD measurement was also performed to gain deeper insight into the correlation between structures and optical properties.
