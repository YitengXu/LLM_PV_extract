    , Accepted 9th May 2012First published on 9th May 2012AbstractFor ZnO hierarchical structures composed of interlaced nanosheets, it has been proved that they are more favorable for electron transportation in the photoanodes of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Here, we introduce ultrasonic-assisted precipitation for fabricating novel nanosheet-based ZnO hierarchical flowers (HFs) in aqueous solution. With the powerful ultrasound irradiation, these nanosheets on the HFs are not only interlaced and monocrystalline, but also axially oriented, porous and ultrathin. Furthermore, broad channels enclosed by adjacent nanosheets can deeply extend into the inner parts of the HFs. Structural improvements reveal that the specific area of the novel HFs as well as their performances on light-capturing and electron transport have been largely improved compared with those prepared through direct precipitation. Remarkably, when assembled into quasi-solid DSCs, ZnO HF photoanodes show a high conversion efficiency up to 6.19% (under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination), the highest record of quasi-solid ZnO-based DSCs up to now.
1. Introduction
Compared with well-developed silicon or other types of solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) provide a technically and economically credible alternative concept for photovoltaic devices.1–5 DSCs offer practical advantages although their conversion efficiency and stability still need to be further improved. Compared with commonly used TiO2, ZnO is a promising alternative photoanode material since it possesses a similar band-gap structure but a higher electronic mobility. Furthermore, it is easier to obtain highly crystallized ZnO and in the meantime realize various morphologies.6–8 Among the reported ZnO photoanodes for DSCs, hierarchical structures have been shown to effectively improve the performance of ZnO-based DSCs.9–12
One typical ZnO hierarchical structure that has been well reported by Cao et al. is the aggregates consisting of nano-sized crystallites.6,7,13 This structure can greatly improve the light-harvesting of DSCs through utilizing the nano-sized primary particles and the submicron-sized secondary aggregates for dye-loading and light scattering, respectively. For this type of hierarchical structures, however, electrical improvements (mainly on electron transport) have been merely observed and reported. This is because photogenerated electrons still need to hop across numerous inter-particle boundaries before being collected by the external circuit.14 Hence, the energy loss caused by serious charge recombination can not be suppressed as observed in traditional photoanodes based on nano-sized particles.15 In fact, in order to significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of DSCs, both optical and electrical (particularly the electron transport and carrier recombination, etc.)16–20 properties of the photoanode need to be optimized simultaneously.
ZnO nanosheets, which can be regarded as quasi-two-dimensional structures, have a large surface area, low resistance with regards to electron transport and have been successfully used as photoanodes in DSCs.6,21 Except for those individually grown onto the substrates,22–26 nanosheet-based hierarchical flowers also exhibit excellent performances in DSCs,11,27–29 especially at localizing incident photons due to their highly disordered structure.6 Generally, nanosheet-based ZnO hierarchical flowers have been fabricated through different approaches. For example, by chemical bath deposition (CBD) and subsequent pyrolysis at high temperature, rose-like ZnO hierarchical flowers were prepared and a high conversion efficiency up to 5.1% was achieved.11,27 Using this method, the obtained nanosheets on these flower were polycrystalline. Through hydrothermal method and using citric acid as a capping agent,28 a monocrystalline nanosheet-based ZnO flower was fabricated but a relatively low conversion efficiency of 2.6% was obtained possibly due to the small BET surface area (13.1 m2 g−2). By using a hydrothermal method together with thermal decomposition,29 another type of nanosheet-based hierarchical flowers with improved BET surface area (46.9 m2 g−2) was prepared, resulting in a high conversion up to 5.05%. For this kind of flower, however, faster electron transport was not observed possibly because these nanosheets were disjoint.
Recently, we reported a novel flower-like ZnO hierarchical structure prepared through a direct precipitation method in aqueous solution.30 The uniqueness of this structure was that the ZnO flowers were constructed with interlaced monocrystalline nanosheets. The photoanodes made from these ZnO flowers for quasi-solid DSCs showed excellent electrical properties because of the diminished boundaries. Through a final conversion of 4.12% was achieved for a quasi-solid DSCs, the photovoltaic performances of the DSC devices could hardly be further improved mainly because of the difficulties in increasing the flowers' specific area (21.48 m2 g−2 for the optimized sample) and in optimizing the structures the ZnO flower due to the rapid precipitation processes.
Here, we report on further development of the direct precipitation method by introducing ultrasonic-assisted nucleation and growth for fabricating ZnO hierarchical flowers (HFs) composed of axially oriented and interlaced, ultrathin and porous monocrystalline nanosheets. Advantages of the HFs prepared by ultrasonic-assisted precipitation are systematically revealed by comparison with those obtained through direct precipitation. Because these novel ZnO HFs have a large specific area (58.97 m2 g−2), broad channels, orientedly aligned nanosheets as well as minimized boundaries, the performance of the HF photoanodes have been largely improved particularly in dye-loading, light-scattering, and electron transport. Thus, these new ZnO HFs possess superior optical and electrical properties and are ideal photoanode materials for highly efficient DSCs. Notably, when assembled into quasi-solid (using highly viscous PEO polymer gel electrolyte) DSCs, ZnO HF photoanodes show a high conversion efficiency up to 6.19% (under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination), the highest record of quasi-solid ZnO-based DSCs up to now.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and Chemicals used
FTO glass (15 Ω □−1, 2.2 mm in thick), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, reagent grade). Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, Mw = 2 × 106 g mol−1), iodine (I2, analytically pure), 1,2-dimethyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (DMPII, 99%), lithium iodide (LiI, 99%), 3-methoxypropionitrile (MePN, 99%), N-methyl-benzimidazole (NMBI, 99%), ethanol (anhydrous, ≥99.5%) and ruthenizer 535-bisTBA (N719 dye).
2.2 Preparation of HFs
Under slow stirring, ZnO hierarchical flowers were prepared by adding 1 L Zn(NO3)2 solution (0.1 M) into 1 L NaOH solution (0.5 M) quickly (∼11 s). For sample 1, ultrasonic irradiation (Bransonic 3510E-MT, 100 W) was introduced and stopped immediately once the process of adding the Zn(NO3)2 solution finished. The total time of ultrasonic irradiation was ∼11 s. Stirring was stopped 1 min later. For sample 2, except ultrasonic irradiation, the other synthetic conditions were kept the same as that for sample 1. The white precipitates were then washed with absolute alcohol, filtered and finally dried in an oven at 90 °C for 5 h.
2.3 Fabrication of ZnO photoanode
In order to obtain photoanodes with better mechanical strength, ZnO particles (10% and 20 nm in size) were blended together with ZnO hierarchical flowers. The blended ZnO powder was added into a mixed solution of absolute alcohol and deionized water (volume ratio = 2:1) and followed by shaking and sonication for 1 h to form a ZnO paste. ZnO porous photoanode films were fabricated on FTO glass by the doctor-blade technique. After drying in air, the photoanode films were thermally treated at 200 °C for 90 min and then sensitized with 0.3 mM N719 absolute ethanol solution at 47 °C for 70 min.
2.4 Solar cell fabrication
To fabricate quasi-solid state DSC devices, chemically platinized conductive glass plates were used as the counter electrode. The PEO-based polymer gel electrolyte consists of 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide and 0.45 M N-methyl-benzimidazole.31 The solvent was 3-methoxypropionitrile and the weight ratio of PEO (Mw = 2 × 106 g mol−1) was 10%. When assembling the DSC devices, the PEO-based polymer gel electrolyte was sandwiched by the sensitized ZnO photoanode and the counter electrode with a well-controlled space of 50 μm. The DSC devices were baked at 90 °C for 20 min so that the polymer gel electrolyte could penetrate into the porous electrodes.
2.5 Characterization
The structure of the ZnO flowers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (RAITH, e-LiNE) and transmission electron microscopy (JEOL, JEM-2010F). HF cross-section was cut by a Focused Ion Beam (Ga+, SMI2050). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) results were obtained with a high resolution X-ray diffraction system (PW1825, Philips). The specific surface areas of the samples were characterized by Coulter SA 3100 surface area analyzer and the photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was measured by KEITHLEY 2420 source meter under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation (Xenon lamp solar simulator, Newport, Class A) with light intensity being calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell. The total active area of a DSC device was 0.25 cm2. A UV light spectrophotometer (Lambda 20) was used to measure dye-loading and diffuse-reflectance spectra, and the dye molecules were desorbed with 0.05 M NaOH aqueous solution. The electron collection time and lifetime were measured on an intensity modulated photocurrent spectrometer (CIMPS system, Zahner) with a light wavelength of 530 nm, and IPCE data were obtained under the same system with a monochromator (LS 0572).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure of ZnO HFs
The advantages of ultrasonic-assisted nucleation and growth of the ZnO HF structure are reflected by the morphology of the HFs as illustrated in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1. Fig. 1a and b show that the nanosheets on the HF are uniformly distributed and interlaced with each other. Another important feature of the HFs is that most of these nanosheets are arranged along a preferred axis and the flowers are elongated along their axes, featuring a cylindrical-like shape. Fig. 1a and b illustrate this feature by imaging the flowers in the directions, perpendicular and along the axis respectively. This special structural feature also indicates that these nanosheets are highly crystallized with few disorders since randomly oriented sheets are effectively suppressed. The inter-connection between the nanosheets with few disorders should be beneficial to the electrical transport since electrons can move along the inter-connected two-dimensional pathway freely. Moreover, most nanosheets arrange loosely and broad channels have been well enclosed by adjacent nanosheets. Fig. 1c demonstrates the image of an HF cross-section obtained by splitting the HF using the Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique. It can be seen from Fig. 1c that these channels can extend deeply into the inner part of the HF, exhibiting a porous HF core structure. These broad channels are very important because they are believed to be able to (i) extend the surface area of HFs; (ii) speed up the dye-adsorption process so as to avoid the formation of a Zn2+–dye complex that is unfavorable for electron injection;6,24 (iii) facilitate the penetration of the viscous polymer gel electrolyte; (iv) extending the optical pathway into the inner parts of the HFs and localizing photons.7 The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) study (see Fig. 1d) identifies that these nanosheets are a single crystalline Wurtzite structure with dominated planes {120}. Such monocrystalline nanosheets may serve as a highway for electron transport because of their excellent crystal quality that can minimize electron hopping and trapping that frequently occur in normal photoanodes made from particles. Fig. S1† shows that the thickness of these ultrathin nanosheets is only several nanometers, and the size of these HFs is effectively confined to 2–4 μm (Fig. 2a). Finally, as shown in Fig. 2b, these ultrathin nanosheets are porous so that the specific area of the HFs can be increased.

For comparison, ZnO HFs prepared by normal direct precipitation without ultrasonic assistance (sample 2) have been prepared under the same experimental conditions (details are listed in the Experimental section) and investigated by SEM. Fig. 2c demonstrates that the size of the flowers obtained through direct precipitation is large (about 7–10 μm). As shown in Fig. 2d, the nanosheets in sample 2 are densely and disorderly arranged, furthermore, there is no porous structure in the nanosheets. Unlike those HFs of sample 1, the cores of the flowers in sample 2 are nearly solid (Fig. S2†). Subsequent Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis indicates that the specific areas for sample 1 and sample 2 are 58.97 m2 g−1 and 18.82 m2 g−1 respectively, demonstrating a remarkable improvement on extending the surface area through introducing ultrasonic treatment into the precipitation process. To be noted, as mentioned above, the specific area of our reported ZnO flower was only 21.48 m2 g−2,30 besides, compared with this flower, the structure of sample 1 in this work has been largely improved in the alignment of the nanosheets, porosity and other structural features (Fig. S3†). Finally, it can be found from the XRD results in Fig. S4† that both sample 1 and sample 2 have been well crystallized and in the meantime no impurities have been detected in them.
Although detailed mechanisms of the ultrasonic effects on the process of ZnO precipitation have not been understood yet, herein, we believe that the ultrasonic treatment largely affects the nucleation and growth of the ZnO HFs and thus causes the significant variation in their morphologies. Ultrasonic energy can generate acoustic cavitation in a liquid, involving bubble formation, growth, and implosive collapse when tremendous energy is generated in localized hot spots.32 In our experiment, it seems that the ultrasonic effect creates local supersaturation and generates much more nuclei in a very short time.33,34 Therefore, the nucleation of ZnO is accelerated. On the other hand, ultrasonic radiation can also retard the ZnO growth through affecting the dehydration and the surface diffusion of the growing units and thus limit the size of final ZnO HFs in sample 1.35 Apart from fast nucleation rate and restrained growth, the depressed nuclei aggregation caused by ultrasonic irradiation can be also regarded as another advantageous factor in limiting HF size. However, for the ultrasonic-assisted precipitation method in our work, many synthetic conditions (concentration, temperature, stirring, ultrasound power, time, etc.) can affect the structures of HFs. Therefore, a systematical investigation on these conditions is needed in the future.
3.2 Photovoltaic performance of quasi-solid DSCs
To compare the performance of samples 1 and 2 in DSCs, photoanode films with different thicknesses were fabricated. It is important to note that our DSC devices are quasi-solid state because of using highly viscous PEO-polymer gel electrolyte (see Fig. S5†). Under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 light illumination, the photovoltaic performances of these two series of photoanodes are measured and illustrated in Fig. 3 with detailed parameters summarized in Table 1. The DSC devices based on sample 1 perform much better than those based on sample 2 mainly due to their larger photocurrent densities. For S2-X series of DSC devices, with increasing the photoanode thickness from 18.4 μm to 25.7 μm, the short circuit current density (JSC) increases and a conversion efficiency (η) of 3.93% is obtained for S2-2. However, due to the prolonged travelling distance for the electrons, charge recombination becomes a serious problem and thus the open circuit voltage (VOC) decreases from 0.695 V to 0.669 V. Although the dye-loading is enhanced when the photoanode thickness for S2-3 increases to 29.2 μm, both VOC and JSC decrease, resulting in a final η of 3.55%. For S1-X DSC devices (photoanode thicknesses vary from 21.4 μm to 35.6 μm), their subsequent dye-loading and values of JSC increase simultaneously while no obvious changes are observed for VOC, and high conversion efficiency values up to 6.19% are obtained for S1-3. Compared with sample 2, this result suggests that the photoanode based on sample 1 has a much longer effective electron diffusion length (Ln) beyond which it is considered that electrons can not be collected by the external circuit.5 Similar to the case of S2-X DSC devices, a degradation of the photovoltaic performance finally appears for S1-4 when continuously increasing the photoanode thickness to about 39.3 μm. Recently, based on hierarchical nanocrystallite aggregates, a significant improvement in conversion efficiency from 2.6% to 7.5% has been reported by Vomiero et al. after introducing a nanoparticle-based buffer layer to reduce the charge recombination.36 This is the highest record for ZnO-based DSCs using a liquid electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, the conversion efficiency of 6.19% in the present sample is the highest record for the quasi-solid ZnO-based DSCs, also much higher than that of 4.12% for our reported ZnO flower.30 Compared with those well performed ZnO DSCs fabricated with liquid electrolyte, it should be noted that our DSC devices have higher VOC and fill factor (FF) values, both of which are highly relevant to the charge recombination at the ZnO–electrolyte interfaces.37,38 In this work, it is considered that the PEO chains in our polymer gel electrolyte can form a barrier layer to prevent the direct contact between the I3− ions in the electrolyte and photogenerated electrons.39 Thus, the charge recombination can be suppressed and higher VOC and FF values can be obtained.

As mentioned above, several research groups have synthesized different ZnO flower-like hierarchical structures, for example, by chemical bath deposition (CBD), thermal decomposition and hydrothermal synthesis.27–29 However, the growth mechanism and structure of our ZnO hierarchical structure are very different from those reported before. The current ultrasonic-assisted approach is simple (just one step synthesis) and cost-effective (neither shape guiding surfactants nor procedures such as hydro/solvent-thermal or decomposition at high temperature is needed). Moreover, this kind of quasi-solid DSCs using polymer gel electrolyte can effectively improve the devices stability for future practical application.40,41 Generally, the conversion efficiency of quasi-solid DSCs is lower than that using liquid electrolyte due to the slow ionic transport. Therefore, in terms of conversion efficiency, our present ZnO hierarchically structured photoanodes have great potential for performance improvement.
3.3 Optical and electrical measurements
In order to understand the mechanism of the enhanced photovoltaic performance in our ZnO HFs photoanodes, we have carried out optical and electrical measurements. Here, we demonstrate detailed characterizations for samples S1-3 and S2-2 since they perform best in their individual groups. In Fig. 4a, the solid lines demonstrate the diffuse-reflectance spectra of S1-3 and S2-2 photoanodes (un-sensitized). From 400 nm to 1000 nm, we observe that the photoanode of S1-3 shows significantly better performance in light-scattering than that of S2-2, because S1-3 can prevent most of the incident light with wavelengths beyond 400 nm from being transmitted out directly. The diffuse-reflectance spectra (dashed lines in Fig. 4a) show that the light absorption of the corresponding sensitized photoanodes mainly happened less than 800 nm, beyond which incident light is hardly trapped by these two sensitized photoanodes. Since dye molecules have no photoresponse at a long wavelength range (for example above 800 nm), in principle, if the bare and sensitized photoanode have the same film thickness, their reflectance data will be the same at the long wavelength range. Actually, there will be slight difference on the thickness of the photoanodes. So the reflectance spectra should be normalized at long wavelength range. To illustrate the optical absorption of the dye-sensitized photoanodes more directly, reflectance spectra of the un-sensitized photoanodes are firstly normalized with these sensitized ones at 1100 nm, then the diffuse-reflectance spectra of the sensitized photoanodes are subtracted from the normalized spectra of un-sensitized ones. As shown in Fig. 4b, the light adsorption by the dye molecules on these two photoanodes happens between 400 nm and 800 nm, nearly covering the whole spectrum of visible light. Particularly, the S1-3 photoanode can capture more than 50% of the photons within the wavelength range from 410 nm to 650 nm, while the S2-2 photoanode does not performs as well. Obviously, due to sufficient dye-loading and efficient light-scattering, the S1-3 photoanode displays a better performance on light-harvesting.
 Fig. 4  (a) Diffuse-reflectance spectra of the photoanodes; (b) optical absorption spectra of dye-sensitized photoanodes. 
We have studied the electron collection time (τc) and lifetime (τr) under different light intensities by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) techniques.42 According to the τc and τr data (Fig. 5a), the electron collection efficiency (ηc) has been calculated using ηc = 1 − (τc/τr). Fig. 5b shows that the S1-3 DSC device has a much better overall performance. Obviously, higher ηc values for the S1-3 DSC device should be mainly attributed to its smaller τc values. As shown in Fig. 5a, the values of τc for S1-3 are much lower than those for S2-2, indicating that electrons in S1-3 can transport across the photoanode and be collected by the external circuit more promptly. Meanwhile, the values of τr for S1-3 are slightly larger than that of S2-2, this is also favorable for the collection of photogenerated electrons. The electron diffusion coefficient Dn for these two kinds of photoanodes has been estimated based on Dn = L2/2.35τc, where L represents the thickness of the photoanode film. S1-3 photoanode shows an excellent electron diffusion coefficient (see Fig. 5c). Under the highest light intensity (41.6 mW cm−2), Dn = 3.5 × 10−3 cm2 s−1 for S1-3. This value is much higher than that previously reported for nanoparticle-based (∼2.5 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) and ZnO flower-based (∼2.18 × 10−4 cm2 s−1) photoanodes,30 indicating a superior electrical property of our ZnO HFs.

3.4 IPCE measurement and discussion
As shown in Fig. 6, sample S1-3 generates a high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). The maximum efficiencies for S1-3 and S2-2 at 533 nm (characteristic absorption) are 87.91% and 55.75%, respectively. It is found that S1-3 generates high IPCE values for a very board wavelength region and IPCE values above 50% are obtained in the wavelength ranging from 445 nm to 670 nm, suggesting most of the harvested photons in this range can be converted into electrical energy. For DSC devices, the current density produced can be attributed to the accumulation of IPCE values under entire light illumination. The IPCE is defined as:5 IPCE = LHE(λ)øinjηcoll(1)where LHE(λ) is the light harvesting efficiency for photons with wavelength λ; øinj is the efficiency for the photoelectron injection from the excited sensitizer into the conduction band of the oxide semiconductor, and ηcoll is electron collection efficiency. For the DSC devices in this work, the differences in øinj can certainly be neglected since there is no modifications on the materials as well as ZnO–dye interface. Therefore, the discussion will mainly focus on the differences of LHE(λ) and ηcoll for S1-3 and S2-2 DSC devices. In addition to sufficient dye-loading, the largely improved LHE(λ) for the S1-3 photoanode can be attributed to the efficient light-scattering caused by repeated light-reflection and photon-localization in this sample. As shown in Fig. 7a, the S1-3 photoanode is 35.6 μm thick (equivalent to tens of layers of densely packed HFs). So, the incident light can be reflected repeatedly. Meanwhile, as mentioned above, channels formed by nanosheets may extend the optical pathway into the inner parts of these micro-sized flowers. Therefore, it is believed that the photon-localization effect should happen within these HFs because incident photons can be confined inside them.6 This effect can greatly prolong a photons pathway and thus increase the chance for photon-capturing by the dye molecules inside the flowers. By contrast, the S2-2 photoanode (25.7 μm in thick) is loosely packed by about three layers of the larger sized HFs (Fig. 7b). Thus, incident photons may be easily transmitted out through those larger intervals with insufficiently repeated light-reflection. Moreover, the narrow channels formed by the densely packed nanosheets in this sample are unfavorable for the photon-localization. Actually, even with similar thicknesses, such as S1-2 and S2-3 photoanodes, the ultrasonic-assisted growth samples always perform better in dye-loading and light-scattering (Fig. S6†).

The superior electron transport of the S1-3 photoanode should be the result of axially oriented and interlaced monocrystalline nanosheets. We believe that in an individual flower, electron hopping between ZnO crystals can be minimized by the highly crystallized and interlaced nanosheets, meanwhile the axially oriented nanosheets can shorten electron travelling distance. In addition to their optical advantages, the channels also allows the PEO gel electrolyte to fully penetrate into the flower's inner parts to facilitate the charge transfer process at dye–electrolyte interfaces.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we present a facile method for fabrication of ZnO hierarchical flowers (HFs) structures based on ultrasonic-assisted nucleation and growth in aqueous solution. This new kind of HF structure is constructed with ultrathin porous monocrystalline nanosheets which are interlaced and axially oriented. The photoanodes made from these ZnO flowers show superior optical and electrical properties because of the advantages gained from this special ZnO hierarchical structure. Using PEO-based polymer gel electrolyte, quasi-solid DSCs based on the ZnO HFs have achieved high conversion efficiency up to 6.19% under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
