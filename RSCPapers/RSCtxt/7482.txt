    , Accepted 10th May 2013First published on 15th May 2013AbstractUniform SiO2@CdS mesoporous nanospheres with an average diameter of 300 nm have been synthesized successfully by a facile process. The as-prepared mesoporous composite nanospheres have a BET-specific surface area of 640 m2 g−1 and an average pore size of 2.82 nm. The results demonstrated that more than 60% Rhodamine B (RhB) dye in solution (4.8 mg L−1, 50 mL) could be removed by adsorption in the dark for 30 min using the as-prepared SiO2@CdS mesoporous nanospheres (40 mg). The as-prepared SiO2@CdS mesoporous nanospheres have a mesoporous nanostructure, suggesting a higher specific surface area and resulting in a strong adsorption ability. In addition, the mesoporous silica was decorated with ca. 5 nm CdS nanocrystals, which showed excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light and could rapidly remove most of the RhB molecules from a pollutant solution under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres synthesized by the present protocol exhibited excellent antibacterial activity.
1 Introduction
Since the shape, phase, size, and component of inorganic multifunctional nanomaterials are important elements to vary their electrical, optical, and some other properties,1,2 rational control over those elements has become a hot research topic in recent years.3,4 The synthesis of composite multifunctional nanostructured materials has received intense attention due to their improved physical and chemical properties such as electronics, magnetism, optics, and catalysis.5,6 Cadmium sulfide (CdS) as an important II–VI semiconductor with a direct band gap energy of 2.42 eV has significant applications in dye-sensitized solar cells,7,8 fluorescence probes,9 displays, photocatalysts10,11 and laser light-emitting diodes and optoelectronic devices,12,13 as it can absorb most of the visible light in the solar spectrum. As for photocatalysts, a high surface area can be one of the most important factors in certain photocatalytic reactions, because the reactions occur on the surface of the catalyst in contact with the substrates, where the reactant molecules must first be adsorbed by the photocatalyst.14 However, methods for producing a CdS photocatalyst with high surface area have not been available. In particular, much effort has been made to synthesize nanocrystals of CdS of high quality and several nanometers in diameter.15,16 Alternative approaches include coupling CdS with micro- and mesoporous materials to form hybrid or composite photocatalysts.17,18 Microstructured porous silica has potential applications in catalysis,19,20 separations,21 drug delivery,22,23 coatings,24 and microelectronics.25 Magnetic manipulation and cell targeting26 are simultaneously possible. Recently, microporous and mesoporous silica nanospheres have been combined with CdS nanoparticles to form hybrid photocatalysts that produce H2 from a water–ethanol mixture under visible light irradiation.27 Incorporation of CdS nanoparticles inside ordered mesoporous silica has been achieved via ion exchange.28 More recently, Au/SiO2/CdS hybrid nanoparticles have been synthesized successfully and exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to that of the CdS nanoparticles alone, owing to the effective photoexcitation of the CdS particles with an LSPR-induced electric field in proximity to the Au particles.29 However, it is still a challenging task to search for new strategies to synthesize mesoporous SiO2@CdS photocatalysts on a large scale with well controlled size, phase, composition and morphology.30,31
In this communication, mesoporous microspheres of silica decorated with CdS nanocrystals were synthesized by a facile process and used for the physical adsorption and direct photolysis of N-containing dyes such as RhB. A schematic drawing is given in Fig. 1 to illustrate how to synthesize the mesoporous SiO2@CdS composite microspheres and use them for photocatalysis. A thin CdS layer is coated onto the silica microspheres obtained from the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of octadecyltrimethoxysilane (C18TMS) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) to form SiO2@CdS composite microspheres, and the mesoporous silica microspheres decorated with CdO nanoparticles were achieved after calcination of the amorphous SiO2@CdS composite microspheres.32 Sulfidation of the mesoporous SiO2@CdO composite microspheres resulted in the formation of the mesoporous SiO2@CdS microspheres. In the present study, the size and crystallization of CdS nanocrystals are controlled and tuned by adjusting the Cd and S sources according to the protocol. In addition, the as-prepared mesoporous SiO2@CdS composite microspheres with a high surface area (ca. 640 m2 g−1) exhibited a strong absorption ability and an excellent catalytic performance towards RhB molecules and antibacterial activity.

2 Results and discussion
The XRD pattern of the as-prepared mesoporous SiO2@CdS composite microspheres is shown in Fig. 2c. The diffraction peaks located at 24.8°, 26.5°, 28.2°, 43.7°, 47.8° and 51.8° could be indexed to hexagonal CdS (JCPDS no. 41-1049) with cell constants of a = 4.140 Å and c = 6.719 Å.33,34 The formed CdS nanocrystals have an average diameter size of 6 nm, which is calculated according to the Scherrer equation (Rm = Kλ/β1/2cosθ). The wide peak located at ca. 25° is generally recognized as the characterization peak of amorphous silica, which indicates that the mesoporous SiO2@CdS composite microspheres contain amorphous components. The samples obtained before the calcination and sulfidation processes have been also characterized and as Fig. 2a and b indicate the as-prepared samples are amorphous.

The morphology and size of the as-synthesized final samples have been characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3a shows a general view of the obtained sample composed of nanospheres of ca. 300 nm in diameter, which are similar in size to the silica nanospheres obtained from the reaction of 1000 µL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and 400 µL octadecyltrimethoxysilane (C18TMS) at room temperature for 48 hours (in the ESI Fig. S1†). Fig. 3c and d show typical TEM images of the SiO2@CdS composite nanospheres, which reveal that the total size of the silica composite nanospheres is within 300 nm in diameter, which is in good agreement with the SEM analyses. Furthermore, small nanoparticles of several nanometers in diameter were observed on the surface of the silica nanospheres. Further analyses were carried out by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) as shown in Fig. 3c and d, which indicated that the small nanoparticles are crystalline and 7 nm in diameter as shown in Fig. 3e. The chemical compositions of the SiO2@CdS nanospheres were also characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). As shown in Fig. 3f Cu was detected due to the use of a Cu grid as the sample substrate for TEM observation. The Si and Cd elements are ca. 25.40, 1.50 atom%, calculated according to atomic percent data (the detailed elemental compositions are listed in Table S1 of the ESI†). Fig. 3g shows the UV-Vis spectrum of the obtained SiO2@CdS nanospheres. A wide shoulder peak located at around 470 nm was observed; this is in good agreement with the quantum dots and nanoparticles of CdS.35,36

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore-size distribution curve of the as-prepared SiO2@CdS composite nanospheres are shown in Fig. 4. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm can be classified as a type-IV isotherm according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature; suggesting that the composite silica nanospheres were mesoporous.37 Octadecyltrimethoxysilane (C18TMS) is an organosilicon compound, which is used for preparing hydrophobic coatings and self-assembled monolayers,38 mesoporous silica coatings on SiO2/Fe2O339 and Au@silica.40 The mesoporous structure of the composite SiO2/CdS nanospheres, derived from calcination of the sample at 500 °C, which is achieved from the condensation reaction of C18TMS and TEOS using the appropriate mole ratio to form silica composite nanospheres.32Based on the above analyses, mesoporous SiO2/CdS nanospheres have been synthesized successfully, with a BET-specific surface area of 640 m2 g−1 and an average pore size of ca. 2.82 nm, indicating that the as-prepared photocatalyst could display a strong adsorption ability.

Adsorption kinetic tests were conducted to evaluate the adsorption rate of the SiO2@CdS mesoporous nanospheres towards pollutants. Fig. 5a and b indicate that the adsorption balance of the RhB dye molecules was reached in 30 min. Specifically, about 30% of the RhB molecules were removed by the as-prepared SiO2@CdS mesoporous nanospheres during the first 10 min, while only a small portion of the adsorption occurred during the next 20 min. In particular, more than 90% of the RhB dye in solution (14.4 mg L−1, 50 mL) could be removed after 5 operation cycles (1 operation cycle takes 30 min) by adsorption using 40 mg of the as-prepared SiO2@CdS mesoporous nanospheres as shown in Fig. 5c and d. In addition, only 3 adsorption cycles were needed to remove about 95% of RhB in solution (4.8 mg L−1, 50 mL) using the as-prepared SiO2@CdS mesoporous nanospheres (40 mg, data not shown).

The relationship between the adsorption rate of RhB and the irradiation time (b) and cycle numbers (c and d). 
The photocatalytic performance (shown by the degradation of RhB) of the as-prepared mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres was carried out at room temperature under visible light irradiation with a 250 W Xe lamp. The characterized peak of RhB dye located at 553 nm in UV-Vis spectra was used to evaluate the photodegradation at a given interval. Before visible light irradiation, mixtures of the catalyst and RhB were stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure that the RhB molecules were adsorbed to reach saturation. As shown in Fig. S2,† more than 70% of the RhB molecules have been adsorbed due to the higher surface area of the photocatalyst. In this case, 90% of the RhB molecules can be decomposed in 50 min in the presence of the as-prepared mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres obtained from 0.2 mmol cadmium acetate (Cd(Ac)2·2H2O) and 0.4 mmol thiourea via the process represented in Fig. 1. It is well known that the photocatalytic activity depends on the loading amount of the photocatalyst on the surface of the mesoporous silica. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of the mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres can be enhanced greatly by varying the amount of the photocatalyst (CdS). In addition, the morphologies of the composite photocatalysts can be well controlled via modulating the synthetic process. The morphology of the mesoporous SiO2@CdS photocatalysts obtained from 0.6 mmol cadmium acetate (Cd(Ac)2·2H2O) and 1.2 mmol thiourea in the presence of 0.5 g silica nanospheres is shown in Fig. S3†; this shows a similar size and morphology to the as-prepared mesoporous SiO2@CdS photocatalysts shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 6 shows that more than 60% of the RhB molecules have been adsorbed when an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalysts and the RhB was established in the dark. Fig. 6b shows that the complete photodegradation of RhB only requires 30 min in the presence of 40 mg mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres obtained from 0.6 mmol cadmium acetate (Cd(Ac)2·2H2O) and 1.2 mmol thiourea and other conditions were kept the same, which indicates better photocatalytic performance shown by the degradation of RhB owing to better crystallization of the photocatalysts revealed by XRD analysis (shown in Fig. S4†). The mesoporous SiO2@CdS photocatalysts displayed excellent performance shown by the degradation of the RhB dye in solution, which is attributed to their strong adsorption ability and an electronic semiconductor–support interaction mediated through surface [Si]–O–Cd–S bonds resulting in the activated oxygen species generation efficiency of the CdS nanoparticles.41,42

The antibacterial activity of the mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres was evaluated against Escherichia coli. Fig. 7 indicates that 70% of the Escherichia coli bacteria could be killed in 24 hours even when the concentration of the mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres is 50 µg L−1. The mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres could be employed to kill the Escherichia coli bacteria because the CdS nanoparticles show an enhanced photon absorption and activated oxygen species generation efficiency.43 In the present study, the mesoporous silica nanospheres decorated with CdS nanoparticles according to our protocol can be regarded as potential and important candidates for drug delivery, cell imaging, fluorescence probes, catalysis, and separations etc.

3 Experimental
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), thiourea and cadmium acetate were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Ltd and octadecyltrimethoxysilane (C18TMS) was received from Sigma Chemical Co. Ltd. All chemicals are of analytical grade and used without further purification.
3.1 Synthesis of the mesoporous SiO2@CdO microspheres with ca. 300 nm diameter
In a typical process, 20 mL ethanol, 1000 µL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and 400 µL octadecyltrimethoxysilane were added into a wide mouth glass bottle with vigorous magnetic stirring to form a clear solution. Subsequently, a mixture of 1 mL ammonia solution and 2 mL double distilled water was added into the previous solution drop by drop with vigorous stirring at room temperature (25 °C) for 24 h. The product (silica composite microspheres) was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with absolute ethanol, and finally dried at 60 °C for 4 h.
0.0533 g (0.2 mmol) cadmium acetate (Cd(Ac)2·2H2O) was dissolved in 10 mL of hydrazine hydrate and 10 mL ethanol to form a clear solution and then the as-prepared silica composite microspheres (0.5 g) were added and well dispersed into the solution by sonication (10 minutes). Subsequently, 0.030 g (0.4 mmol) thiourea was added into the previous suspension with vigorous stirring. Finally, the final mixture was kept at room temperature for 12 h. The product was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and distilled water three times each, before being dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The mesoporous SiO2@CdO microspheres were obtained after calcination at 550 °C in static air for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1.
3.2 Synthesis of the mesoporous SiO2@CdS microspheres with ca. 300 nm diameter
The conversion from the as-prepared mesoporous SiO2@CdO microspheres to mesoporous SiO2@CdS composite microspheres was achieved by a sulfidation process. The sulfidation reaction was carried out as follows. In a typical synthesis, 0.2 g of mesoporous SiO2@CdO microspheres were heated to 90 °C, and H2S gas was introduced into the reaction vessel. The sulfidation reaction was kept at 90 °C for 4 hours when the color of the sample changed from white to yellow.
3.3 Photocatalytic activity
Photocatalytic activity testing by the degradation of RhB was carried out in a 100 mL beaker containing 50 mL RhB with a concentration of 1 × 10−5 mol L−1 (4.8 mg L−1) and 40 mg of the as-prepared SiO2@CdS composite microspheres with vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature under visible light irradiation with a 250 W Xe lamp. The concentration of the RhB was measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometry (2501 PC model; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 10 min intervals during the degradation of the RhB.
3.4 Antibacterial experiments

Escherichia coli bacteria were collected and diluted to a cell density of 1 × 105 mL−1 in a complete medium, and then cultured on a 35 mm polylysine-coated glass-bottomed microwell dish (MatTek Corporation, MA, USA). The SiO2@CdS composite microspheres with different concentrations (25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 500 µg mL−1) were added to the cells and the cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C. The cells were washed to remove the unbound nanoparticles. Mitochondria of the cells were stained with 0.1 mM MitoTrackers Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, OR, USA) for 30 min, and then counterstained with DAPI (Molecular Probes, OR, USA) for nuclear staining after washing with a PBS buffer two or three times. Fluorescence was observed using a Nikon confocal microscope and images were captured using the Evolution MP Cooled Camera Kit.
3.5 Characterization
The phase of the as-prepared product was characterized by X-ray power diffraction (XRD) analyses, which were carried out on a Philips X'Pert PRO SUPER X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation and an operation voltage and current of 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. The morphology and size of the samples were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL-6700F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 3010); UV-Visible spectra were conducted on a spectrophotometer (2501 PC model; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size distributions of the samples were carried out on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, USA) and the samples were degassed in a vacuum at 300 °C for 2 h before measurement. BET, pore volumes and pore size distributions were derived from the desorption branches of the isotherms by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model and the total pore volumes were estimated from the adsorbed amount at a relative pressure P/P0 of 0.992.
4 Conclusions
In summary, mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres have been synthesized successfully by a facile process. The as-prepared mesoporous composite photocatalyst has a BET specific surface area of 640 m2 g−1 and an average pore size of 2.82 nm. The results demonstrate that more than 60% RhB dye in solution (4.8 mg L−1, 50 mL) can be removed by adsorption in the dark for 30 min using the as-prepared SiO2@CdS mesoporous nanospheres (40 mg). Furthermore, only three adsorption cycles were needed to remove about 95% of the RhB in solution (4.8 mg L−1, 50 mL) using the as-prepared SiO2@CdS mesoporous nanospheres (40 mg). In particular, the composite photocatalyst also displayed excellent photodegradation of the RhB dye in solution under visible light irradiation owing to a strong adsorption ability and activated oxygen species generation efficiency of the CdS nanoparticles and resulting in better antibacterial activities. It is of great importance for the as-prepared mesoporous SiO2@CdS nanospheres to have potential applications in drug delivery, cell imaging, fluorescence probes, catalysis, and separations etc.
