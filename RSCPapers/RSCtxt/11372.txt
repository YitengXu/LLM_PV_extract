    , Accepted 6th July 2016First published on 7th July 2016AbstractMethoxyaniline-based organic small molecules with three-dimensional structure have been proven as the most promising hole conductor for state-of-the-art perovskite devices. A fundamental understanding of the electronic properties and hole transport behavior of spiro-CPDT analogues, which is dependent on the number and position of the –OCH3 groups, is significant for their potential applications as hole transport materials of perovskite solar cells. Our results from density functional theory calculations indicate that meta-substitution is more beneficial to reduce the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of molecules compared with ortho- and para-substitution. Furthermore, the hole mobility can be improved by ortho-substitution or mixed ortho- and para-substitution. Most interestingly, it is found that the improvement in hole mobility is at the expense of raising the HOMO level of spiro-CPDT analogues. These results can be useful in the process of designing and synthesizing excellent hole transport materials with suitable HOMO levels and high hole mobility.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites as light absorbents and organic or inorganic materials as hole transport layers have emerged as the forerunner in next-generation photovoltaic technology due to low material cost and superior power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–5 Although hole transport material (HTM)-free PSCs have been reported to exhibit impressive cell performance with 10% efficiency,6–8 in most of the highly efficient PSC devices, organic HTMs are still used for hole carrier transport purposes. To date the organic small molecule 2,2-7.7-tetrakis(N,N′-diparamethoxy-phenyl-amine 9,9′-spirobifluorene) (spiro-OMeTAD) is the best choice as HTM for PSCs.9,10 This material can form an amorphous glass, rather than a partially crystalline phase, facilitating formation of smooth films.11 Furthermore, its three-dimensional structure efficiently suppresses the molecular interaction between π-systems and increases molecular stability and glass transition temperature.12 However, its high cost and low hole mobility limit its potential photovoltaic commercialization. Therefore, it is important to further develop more economical and efficient spiro-HTMs. From this perspective, various HTMs including polymers and organic small molecules have been developed.13–15 Recently, Mishra et al.16 designed a new promising spiro-HTM (named HTM1) using triarylamines as arms and the 4,4′-spirobi[cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene] derivative (spiro-CPDT) as the core. Their result shows that the PSC based-HTM1 gives impressive PCE of up 13.4% without any doping which is comparable to spiro-OMeTAD devices with p-doping. This is one of the highest values for chemically undoped PSCs fabricated using the sequential deposition method.16 Based on the above fact, it is of great significance to further explore the electrochemical properties of spiro-CPDT analogues. An effective and simple strategy to adjust the molecular electronic properties is to change the position of the substituent group (OCH3) in arylamine-based HTMs17 for the reason that OCH3 shows two opposite effects in the aromatic ring i.e., electron-withdrawing for meta (m) and electron-donating for para (p).18 In the present work, we investigate the changing trends of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, and hole transport properties of a series of spiro-CPDT analogues (see Fig. 1) by changing the number and position of substituents using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to design potential HTMs.

The molecular geometries are optimized by DFT with the B3LYP functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set in dichloromethane solvent based on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM),19 as implemented in the Gaussian 09 program.20
The hole hopping rate of the investigated molecules is calculated by using Marcus theory.21 The charge hopping rate (k) is expressed as:  where T is the temperature in Kelvin, kB represents the Boltzmann constant, and h denotes the Planck constant. The λ represents reorganization energy, which is calculated by using the adiabatic potential energy surface method.22v is the transfer integral, which can be deduced directly from a direct approach and site energy correction model.23 Recently, Valeev et al. pointed out that when the dimer is not cofacially stacked, the calculation of site-energy will produce non-negligible error due to the effect of the crystal environment,24 hence we adopt a direct approach to investigate the transfer integral at the M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) level.25 Then, the hole mobility of the investigated molecules can be predicted by using the Einstein relation26 (detailed descriptions are given in Part 1 of the ESI†).
For PSCs, the HOMO level of the HTM is a key factor in determining the open-circuit voltage of the device, because it is relative to the difference between the HOMO level of the HTM and the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2. A deeper HOMO level gives a higher open-circuit voltage. Therefore, obtaining more accurate HOMO levels is an important step to develop potential HTMs. To determine the effect of different functionals on HOMO levels, a series of functionals with different ratios (Ax) between the Hartree–Fock (HF)-like and density functional exchange, namely, B3LYP (Ax = 20%), PBE1PBE (Ax = 25%), MPW1B95 (Ax = 31%), PBE33 (Ax = 33.33%), PBE38 (Ax = 37.5%), MPWB1K (Ax = 42.8%), and BHHLYP (Ax = 50%) with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set are employed to calculate the HOMO levels of 30 HTMs used in PSCs. A previous study27 indicates that the DFT results are generally less sensitive to the basis set for calculating frontier molecular orbital energy. So we neglect the effect of the basis set. It is worth noting that all optimized geometries are obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in dichloromethane solvent, based on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM), and the HOMO levels of 30 reference molecules28–30 obtained from these functionals mentioned above are compared with experimental values to further illustrate the effect of various methods on the HOMO levels. The obtained results are shown in Table S1 of the ESI† and Fig. 2. Important conclusions can be made: as a whole, the calculated HOMO levels decrease obviously with Ax increasing when Ax is 20–45%. Specifically, the HOMO levels are overvalued by the B3LYP, PBE1PBE, and MPW1B95 methods, while these values are underestimated with the PBE38, MPWB1K, and BHHLYP methods. Most importantly, the PBE33 calculation can give the most accurate HOMO levels of the seven functionals compared with experimental HOMO levels, and the mean difference between theoretical and experimental values is only 0.05 eV. So PBE33/6-31G(d,p) is selected to describe the HOMO levels of spiro-CPDT analogues in the present work.
 Fig. 2  The relationship between the calculated HOMO level errors and ratio of HF. 
Calculated HOMO levels of spiro-CPDT analogues are listed in Table S2 of the ESI† and Fig. 3 (magenta columns), the result shows that the HOMO level obtained for HTM1 is −4.98 eV, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (−5.00 eV).16 This further indicates that the PBE33 functional is reasonable and capable of evaluating the HOMO levels of phenylamine-type HTMs. As shown in Fig. 3, it is found that m-substituted derivatives (such as HTM5) result in decreased HOMO levels due to lowering of the energy of the π system with reducing structural symmetry, while the p- (such as HTM1) and o-substituted derivatives (such as HTM3) have similar HOMO levels. This phenomenon mainly stems from the fact that m-substitution exerts an electron-withdrawing inductive effect, while o- and p-substitution show an electron-donating behavior under resonance stabilization, as previously reported by Hammett.18 Otherwise, we also find that the number of substituents has little effect on HOMO levels for m-substituted derivatives. For example, HTM5 including 8 OCH3 groups and HTM11 including 16 OCH3 groups have the same HOMO level of −5.16 eV. However, the HOMO levels of molecules with o-substituents increase with the number of substituents. For instance, HTM12 has a slightly higher HOMO level than HTM3, and the same trend can also be found in molecules HTM10 and HTM4.
 Fig. 3  Calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of spiro-CPDT analogues. 
On the whole, the HOMO levels of m-substituted derivatives are deeper than that of the reference molecule HTM1 and are well matched with that of the frequently used material CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV), which can assist in gaining a higher open-circuit voltage in PSCs.
For potential HTMs, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level should be higher than the conduction band of the perovskite (such as CH3NH3PbI3, −3.93 eV) to block the electron transportation from the perovskite to the metal electrodes. A previous study31 has shown that a reliable LUMO level of a spiro-HTM can be calculated by adding its excitation energy to the HOMO level. The excitation energies of spiro-CPDT analogues are calculated at the TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level and are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The predicted LUMO levels are also listed in Table S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 3 (cyan columns). The obtained LUMO level of HTM1 is −2.62 eV, which is in good agreement with the experimental LUMO level of −2.57 eV, suggesting that the computation method selected for predicting the LUMO level is reasonable and effective. Moreover, we find that the m-substituted derivatives have slightly lower LUMO levels than p- and o-substituted derivatives. We also find that although HTM1 and HTM3 show similar HOMO levels, their LUMO levels are different. This is because o-substitution shows not only a resonance stabilization effect but also a steric effect.17 Besides the effect of substituent position, the number of substituents has almost no effect on the LUMO level. Furthermore, the LUMO levels of spiro-CPDT analogues range from −2.75 to −2.47 eV, which are higher than the conduction band edge of CH3NH3PbI3, indicating that backflow of electrons can be effectively blocked and hence suppress carrier recombination.32
Tuning the energy level of a material is only a fractional fulfillment of requirements, we also need to improve hole transport mobility, and so avoid surface carrier recombination. Recently, many reports15,33 have pointed out that the large hole mobility of HTMs can lead to an improved fill factor and large short circuit current density of perovskite solar cells. Hence, it is important to explore the hole mobility of HTMs by theoretical chemical methods. The reorganization energy is one of the key factors that determine the rate of charge transport in HTMs. A faster charge transport rate is achieved with a lower reorganization energy. Fig. 4 shows reorganization energies (λ, eV) of the spiro-CPDT analogues at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Obviously, m-substituted derivatives (HTM5 and HTM11) and o-substituted derivatives (HTM3 and HTM12) display larger λ than p-substituted derivatives (HTM1). Furthermore, compared with o-substitution, m-substitution is more unfavorable to reduce λ. This result can be explained by the inductive effect of the OCH3 group, when an electron is removed from a neutral m-substituted derivative, the redistribution of the electron cloud leads to a large change in the cationic geometric structure. Interestingly, we find that molecules including mixed m-OCH3 and o-OCH3 groups display the largest λ of all the investigated molecules, such as HTM4 and HTM9.

Hole mobility of HTMs plays an important role in increasing the short circuit current density and fill factor of PSCs.34,35 Although a reliable protocol36 has been developed to provide physicists and chemists with a powerful tool for predicting the charge carrier mobility of organic semiconductors, calculating the hole mobility for a novel material is still difficult, as a full model of packing and an understanding of the dielectric environment is required before microscopic charge transfer integrals can be calculated and a macroscopic mobility predicted.37 According to previous research,31 only stable dimers of spiro-CPDT analogues are considered to qualitatively compare molecular hole mobility. The stable dimers are obtained by using molecular dynamics simulation and DFT calculation (detailed processes and stable dimers are given in Part 2 and Fig. S1 of the ESI,† respectively).31 Based on the stable dimers of spiro-OMeTAD and HTM1, the obtained hole mobility is 5.65 × 10−3 and 1.33 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The relative trend of hole mobility is consistent with the corresponding experimental values (2.10 × 10−4 (ref. 38) and 6.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for spiro-OMeTAD and HTM1, respectively). So this simple method is reliable to qualitatively compare hole-transporting behavior in the present work.
The centroid to centroid distances (d, Å), hole transfer integrals (v, eV), hole hopping rate (k, s−1), and hole mobility (u, cm2 V−1 s−1) of all the investigated molecules are shown in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, HTM2 shows the largest hole mobility of all the spiro-CPDT analogues, and the hole mobility of molecules HTM2–HTM12 is faster than that of HTM1. Moreover, compared with spiro-OMeTAD, HTM2, HTM3, and HTM8 show larger hole mobility at the same calculation level due to a large transfer integral. Our result indicates that o-substitution or the mixed o- and p-substitution is an efficient method for increasing the molecular hole mobility. Interestingly, this finding is in agreement with Seok's experimental result17 that po-spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM has a higher PCE compared with pm-spiro-OMeTAD and pp-spiro-OMeTAD in perovskite devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the frontier molecular orbital energies and hole mobility of twelve spiro-CPDT analogues are studied by using density functional theory and Marcus theory combined with the Einstein relation. The PBE33 functional is selected to calculate the HOMO levels of all the investigated molecules. The results suggest that the HOMO level and hole mobility can be controlled by adjusting the number and position of the –OCH3 groups for spiro-CPDT analogues. m-Substitution is beneficial to reduce the molecular HOMO levels, and m-substituted derivatives show slightly lower LUMO levels than p- and o-substituted derivatives, while the number of substituents has almost no effect on the LUMO level. Most importantly, the hole mobility can be improved by o-substitution or mixed o- and p-substitution. The present results provide a useful structure–property relationship to develop highly efficient HTMs.
