    , Accepted 1st March 2015First published on 3rd March 2015AbstractTwo novel arylamine-free organic compounds (CYF1 and CYF2) incorporating a substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit as the electron donor were synthesized and used as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The relationship between the chemical structure and photovoltaic performance was investigated. A higher molar absorption coefficient, longer electron lifetime, and larger adsorption amount were observed for sensitizer CYF1, which contains a single π bridge and anchoring unit, compared with CYF2 with twin π bridges and anchoring units. As a result, under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions, the device based on CYF1 sensitizer gave a higher conversion efficiency of 8.02% than that based on CYF2. This is the highest value for amine-free organic sensitizers with no strong donor units. Moreover, the CYF1- and CYF2-sensitized DSSCs exhibited excellent stability under 1000 W m2 light soaking at 60 °C for 600 h. This is the first example of organic sensitizers based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene donors for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention after Grätzel's study in 1991 due to their low-cost fabrication and design versatility combined with high performance.1 The sensitizer is one of the key components in DSSCs because it plays a significant role in the power conversion efficiency and device stability. DSSCs based on zinc, ruthenium complexes, and pure organic dyes have reached an overall conversion efficiency of over 13%,2 11%,3 and 12%,4 respectively. Organic dyes have unique advantages over Ru complexes, including tunable absorption and electrochemical properties, versatile structural modification, and lower cost.
Traditionally, the most frequently used organic dyes in DSSCs are based on the arylamines or alkylamines donors.5 We have also prepared a series of organic sensitizers with triphenylamine and carbazole donors, achieving a maximum efficiency of 10% in liquid DSSCs.6 However, organic sensitizers using amine-free donors are still rare.7 Very recently, we have developed a new class of amine-free dyes based on the cone-calix[4]arene donor containing four donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) units, the conversion efficiencies of which are higher compared with the corresponding dyes with a single D–π–A unit.8 To promote growth of DSSC research, novel organic dyes containing amine-free donors must be tested, which can significantly increase the choice of materials available, facilitate the understanding of DSSCs, and provide new opportunities for the development of good sensitizers. Although amines are strong donors, they are nucleophiles, and the lone pair on nitrogen increases their reactivity, resulting in the decrease in their intrinsic stability. Compared with amine-based organic sensitizers, amine-free organic sensitizers using thiophene derivatives as donors are more stable, because the delocalization of holes on the oligothiophene moieties of the sensitizer may increase their photo and chemical stability.5f
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in sensitizers capable of multiple anchoring for DSSCs to increase electron extraction channels and enhance binding stability.9 Some research groups have reported the synthesis of dyes possessing double anchors for DSSCs. The D–π–(A)2 dyes have a higher photocurrent but a lower photovoltage than single D–π–A dyes due to their better light harvesting, inefficient dark current suppression and downward shift of the titania conduction band.9a–d Therefore, we became interested in organic dyes with an electron-rich moiety that can be incorporated into multi-acceptors, as a substitute for arylamines.
The benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit, which consists of two thiophene rings with a benzene core, has emerged recently as an attractive donor building block for conjugated polymers or acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecules in high performance organic solar cells (OSCs) because of their outstanding properties, which include wide absorptions with high coefficients, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and facile structural modification.10 However, despite extensive research into the development of OSCs based on BDT donors, amine-free organic sensitizers using BDT as the electron donor for DSSCs have not, to the best of our knowledge, been reported, although BDT motifs have been used in spacers for arylamine-based dyes.11
Therefore, we set out to design and synthesize two novel sensitizers, CYF1 and CYF2, containing a 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene donor, a 2-cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, and a 3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene and 3,4-ethoxythiophene (EDOT) spacer. Herein, the 4,8-positions of the BDT units were functionalized by introducing two 2-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophene groups to realize the following molecular engineering strategies: (1) the thiophene groups are employed to obtain greater conjugation and thus achieve a higher short circuit current (Jsc); and (2) the 2-ethylhexyl alkyl chains on the thiophene groups are introduced to enhance the solubility and suppress the aggregation of dye molecules, and thus enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc). In addition to the BDT donors, different numbers of π bridges and anchoring groups are introduced to tune interfacial electron transfer. The differences between the structures and optoelectronic properties of CYF1 and CYF2, with a single and twin π bridges and anchoring groups, respectively, have been investigated by UV-vis absorption and emission spectra, cyclic voltammograms (CVs), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), density functional theory (DFT) studies, and long-term cell stability measurements. DSSCs based on CYF1 exhibit both higher Voc and Jsc compared with the DSSCs based CYF2, which can be ascribed to its higher molar absorption coefficient, longer electron lifetime, and higher adsorption.
Experimental section
General

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. Mass spectra data were obtained on an ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). The absorption spectra of the dyes (in solution and adsorbed on TiO2 films) were observed with a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrometer, and fluorescence spectra were measured with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves were obtained with a CHI 832 electrochemical analyzer using a normal three-electrode cell with a dye-sensitized photoanode as the working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a regular Ag/AgCl reference electrode in saturated KCl solution that was calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium as an external reference. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in THF.
Materials and reagents
Solvents were purified using an MBRAUN MB SPS-800 system. Anhydrous solvents used in the Suzuki coupling reaction were degassed by bubbling with N2 for 20 min. Optically transparent fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass was purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan, (15 Ω per square), and cleaned by a standard procedure. All other chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources without further purification. 4,8-Bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (1)10f and 7-(5′-bromo-3′,4-dihexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine-5-carb-aldehyde (4)6a were synthesized according to the literatures.

Fabrication of cells
Anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized according to our previous method.12 First, Ti(OBu)4 (10 mL) was added to ethanol (20 mL) under stirring for 10 min. Then a mixture of deionized water (50 mL) and acetic acid (18 mL) was added to the solution and stirred vigorously for 1 h. The solution was placed in an autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. Finally, the precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. A white powder was obtained after drying in air. The as-prepared TiO2 nanoparticles were anatase crystals with diameters of about 20 nm, as confirmed by SEM, TEM, and XRD. The prepared TiO2 powder (1.0 g) was ground for 40 min in a mixture of acetic acid (0.2 mL), ethanol (8.0 mL), ethyl cellulose (0.5 g), and terpineol (3.0 g) to form a slurry, and then the slurry was sonicated for 5 min to obtain a viscous white TiO2 paste. The TiO2 paste was then screen-printed onto the surface of FTO-coated glass, forming the photoanode film. The thickness of the films could be easily controlled through repeating the screen-printing. Afterwards, a programmed heating process was carried out to remove the organic substances in the film. The as-prepared TiO2 films (∼15 μm) were soaked in a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C and then sintered at 520 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in 0.3 mM optimized solutions (CHCl3/ACN/tBuOH = 1/2/2, v/v/v) of the dyes and kept at room temperature for 6 h for cells with the liquid electrolyte, and for 12 h for cells with the gel electrolyte. The prepared TiO2 working electrodes were sandwiched together with the Pt-counter electrode. The active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film was 0.16 cm2. The electrolyte was injected into the inter-electrode space. The electrolyte solution was composed of 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodine (PMII), 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v).
Characterization of cells
The TiO2 film thickness and active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film was measured by using a profilometer (XP-1, Ambios). The current–density voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs were recorded by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of DSSCs were measured with a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Zahner) with a frequency response analyzer at a bias potential of −800 mV in the dark with a frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. The amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film was measured by using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrometer. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements were conducted by using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Zahner) and were performed under a modulated LED light (457 nm) driven by a source supply (PP210, Zahner). The illumination intensity ranged from 30 to 150 mW cm−2. The light intensity modulation was 20% of the base light intensity over the frequency range of 10−1 to 103 Hz.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of sensitizers CYF1 and CYF2 is shown in Scheme 1. The starting material, 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethyl-hexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (1), coupled with 1 or 2 equivalents of SnBu3Cl through a Stille coupling reaction to afford 2 and 3, respectively. Then, 2 reacted with 1 equivalent of 4, or 3 reacted with 2 equivalents of 4, in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 to generate CYF1–CHO or CYF2–CHO, respectively. Finally, CYF1 and CYF2 were obtained from CYF1–CHO and CYF2–CHO, respectively, via a Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid by refluxing in acetonitrile in the presence of piperidine.

UV-vis absorption properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of sensitizers CYF1 and CYF2 in THF solution are depicted in Fig. 1a, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. CYF1 and CYF2 exhibit two major absorption bands in the range of 300–600 nm. The band below 400 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition and the other band at 450–550 nm can be assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor unit to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor moiety to produce an efficient charge-separated state. The λmax at ICT band of CYF2 is red shifted by about 17 nm from that of CYF1 because of the longer conjugated π-chromophore in CYF2. However, the molar extinction coefficients of CYF1 in the π–π* band are much higher than those of CYF2, and its ICT absorption band is also more intense relative to CYF2, which indicates that stronger ICT interactions occur in CYF1, in agreement with reports of other ICT systems with an increased number of electron-withdrawing groups.13 This can be explained by the dispersion of the electron push–pull effect resulting from two competing anchoring groups in sensitizer CYF2.

The absorption spectra of organic sensitizers CYF1 and CYF2 on the TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 1b. The extension of the CYF1 and CYF2 spectra beyond 600 nm implies the existence of J-aggregation of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface.9f The ICT band of the CYF1-loaded TiO2 film displays no obvious shift compared with that in THF, indicating the ICT from the BDT donor to the acceptor did not weaken, despite the anchoring group being deprotonated. In contrast, the ICT band for CYF2 exhibits only unresolved shoulders at around 500 nm, probably due to the absorption band overlapping. A slight hypsochromic shift of the absorption maximum of CYF2 occurred compared with the spectrum in THF, which could be ascribed to the deprotonation of the twin anchoring groups.
Molecular orbital calculations
The electronic structure calculations of CYF1 and CYF2 were carried out by using the TD-DFT and B3LYP-3-21G* program. All dihedral angles between the thiophene planes in CYF1 and CYF2 dyes are listed in Table S1.† The angles between BDT and 2-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophene plane in CYF1 (A1–A2) and CYF2 (B1–B2) are as large as 53.2° and 53.5°, respectively, which can prevent π–π aggregation of dye. However, the coplanarity of the DBT donor and the close bridging thiophene ring in CYF1 (A1–A3) and CYF2 (B1–B3) dyes is clear, as verified by the dihedral angles of 9.2° and 9.7°, respectively, which may favor the electron transport process.
The calculated molecular orbitals of CYF1 and CYF2 with isodensity plots of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are illustrated in Fig. 2. The HOMOs of CYF1 and CYF2 are delocalized on the donor groups and extend to the π bridges, whereas the LUMOs of these molecules are concentrated on the cyanoacrylic moieties. It was expected that the LUMOs of CYF2 would stretch out to two anchoring parts of carboxylic groups. As a result, the HOMO–LUMO excitation could transfer the electron distribution from the DBT donor to the cyanoacrylic acid moiety through the π-conjugation bridge.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the sensitizers were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CH2Cl2 and their electrochemical data are listed in Table 1.14 The first oxidation potentials, corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of sensitizers CYF1 and CYF2, were determined to be −5.15 and −5.25 eV, respectively, which are more positive than the I−/I3− redox couple (−4.9 eV), providing a thermodynamic driving force for efficient dye regeneration. Accordingly, the LUMO energy levels of dyes CYF1 and CYF2, estimated from the oxidation potentials and absorption/emission data, were calculated to be −2.92 and −3.09 eV, which are more negative than the conduction edge of the TiO2 (−3.9 eV),15 indicating that the electron injection process is energetically permitted. Although the electron donating group, π-conjugated bridge, and electron acceptor in the two sensitizers are identical, the difference in the energy levels can be traced to the difference in the number of π-conjugated and anchoring groups.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performance of CYF1- and CYF2-sensitized solar cells with liquid electrolyte is shown in Fig. 3a. The Jsc, Voc, and FF values for CYF1 based DSSC are 17.87 mA cm−2, 683 mV, and 0.66, respectively, which corresponds to η of 8.01%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a high efficiency has been obtained for liquid-based DSSCs with amine-free organic sensitizers. Under the same conditions, the DSSC based on CYF2, which has two anchoring units, features Jsc, Voc, FF, and η values of 14.64 mA cm−2, 592 mV, 0.68, and 5.85%, respectively. The superior performance of sensitizer CYF1 relative to CYF2 is particularly interesting.
 Fig. 3  (a) Photocurrent density vs. voltage and (b) incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra for DSSCs based on CYF1 and CYF2 under AM 1.5G simulated solar light (100 mW cm2). 
To elucidate the difference between the Jsc values, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) for the DSSCs based on sensitizers CYF1 and CYF2 are shown in Fig. 3b. All cells tested convert light to photocurrent over a wide wavelength region up to about 750 nm. The IPCE spectrum of the cell based on CYF1 exhibits a plateau between 420 and 590 nm with an IPCE value of over 80%, whereas the CYF2-based cell displays an IPCE spectrum with a similar spectral pattern, but with a decreased intensity and maximum. This result agrees well with the trends in their absorption spectra both in solution and on the TiO2 film. Consequently, the increase in Jsc values for sensitizer CYF1 compared with CYF2 could be attributed to its wider IPCE spectra and better dye adsorption (Table 1).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to explain the different Voc values obtained for the DSSCs based on CYF1 and CYF2.16 The second semicircle (Rrec) in the Nyquist plot is attributed to charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. A larger Rrec indicates a slower charge recombination, smaller dark current, and higher Voc. Fig. 4a shows that the radius of the second semicircle of CYF1 is larger than that of CYF2, implying its electron recombination resistance is higher than CYF2. Electron lifetimes (τ) obtained from curve fitting are 184.1 and 81.8 ms for CYF1 and CYF2, respectively, which corresponds well with the Voc values obtained from the J–V curves. Though CYF1 and CYF2 have similar chemical structures, the Voc values are greatly affected by the number of the π-conjugated bridges and anchoring groups. This indicates that the introduction of two π-conjugated bridges and anchoring units does not improve the Voc. We propose that the cell based on CYF2 gives the lower Voc value due to the two factors: (1) the extra protons released from the D–(π)2–(A)2 molecules lower the Fermi level of TiO2, leading to the Voc decrease; and (2) the lower dye loading leaves more void space for electrolyte penetration, resulting in a larger dark current. The Bode phase plots (Fig. 4b) show that the middle-frequency peak of the cell based on CYF1 shifts to a lower frequency relative to CYF2, displaying a longer lifetime for CYF1, supporting the difference in the electron lifetime for the TiO2 film derivatized with the two sensitizers.

To confirm the different photovoltaic behaviors of the two sensitizers, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were performed. Fig. 5a shows the recombination time (τr) of DSSCs based on CYF1 sensitizers under various incident light intensities is longer than that based on CYF2, consistent with the EIS results described above. However, Fig. 5b shows that the electron transport time (τd) of DSSCs based on CYF1 sensitizers is shorter than that of CYF2. The adsorption of Li+ in the TiO2 electrodes increases the local cation density and assists the electron diffusion along the TiO2 network.17 Therefore, we speculate that the more protons released from the CYF2 sensitizers with twin carboxyl groups might limit the access of Li+ to the TiO2 surface due to electrostatic repulsion, and thus prolong the electron transport time.

Long-term stability
The long-term stability of DSSCs based on CYF1 and CYF2 was measured under AM 1.5 light for at least 600 h, as shown in Fig. 6. After 1000 h light soaking, the Voc of CYF1 based cells decreases by 67 mV and the FF declines from 0.68 to 0.66, but the Jsc increases by 1.05 mA cm−2. As a consequence, the efficiency decreases from 7.48% to 7.04% and remains at 94% of the initial value. The cells based on CYF2 were also subjected to testing under the same conditions. The Voc value decreases by 66 mV and the FF remains constant, although the Jsc increases by 1.39 mA cm−2. Thus, the overall efficiency remains at 95% (4.75%) of the initial value (5.00%). The results demonstrate that the CYF1 and CYF2 sensitizers continue to function without a noticeable decline in performance.18

Conclusions
In summary, two novel amine-free organic sensitizers based on BDP donors, CYF1 and CYF2, with a single and twin π bridges and anchoring groups, respectively, have been synthesized and used in DSSCs. The cell based on CYF1 gives an improved conversion efficiency of 8.08%, compared with CYF2, which could be caused by its higher molar absorption coefficients, longer electron lifetimes, and larger adsorption amounts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a high efficiency has been obtained for liquid DSSCs with amine-free organic sensitizers without any strong donor units. Moreover, the CYF1 and CYF2 sensitizers containing BDP donors show excellent stability, which remain at 94% and 95% of the initial value under 100 mW cm−2 light soaking at 60 °C for 500 h, respectively. We believe that the use of BDP as a donor in organic sensitizers presents new opportunities for the development of efficient amine-free organic sensitizers.
