    , Accepted 14th December 2017First published on 14th December 2017AbstractThe performance of electronic and optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional (2D) materials could be significantly affected by the electrical contacts. In search of low-resistance contacts with transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we combine density functional calculations with quantum transport simulations to investigate the structural and electronic properties of the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures MSe2/NbSe2 (M = Mo and W). The formation of a p-type Schottky contact at the MSe2/NbSe2 interface with small Schottky barriers (0.37 eV for MoSe2/NbSe2 and 0.18 eV for WSe2/NbSe2) is demonstrated. The low Schottky barrier heights indicate a low contact resistance, which is beneficial for electron injection and low-resistance. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the Schottky barrier can be effectively tuned via the application of vertical compressive pressure, an external electrical field and tensile strain. Finally, the results are supported by quantum transport simulation, which further proves the highly transparent contacts and promising application potential in field-effect transistors (FET). Therefore, our formalism and findings not only provide insights into the MSe2/NbSe2 interfaces but also help in the design of MSe2 monolayer-based devices.
1. Introduction
Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, silicene and tinene, offer a variety of intriguing properties for fundamental studies and applications.1–3 While these materials do not have the requisite band gaps (graphene and silicene: 0 eV; h-BN: >5 eV) for use as channel materials in digital applications, monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with the general formula MX2 (X = S and Se; M = Mo and W) are regarded as viable candidates for low-power digital electronics because of their considerably larger band gaps in the range of 1–2 eV.4,5 Among the semiconducting TMDs in the 2D phase, for example, MoSe2 and WSe2 have been extensively investigated due to their highly enhanced quantum efficiency and excellent transistor performance.6 In addition to the semiconducting members, 2D NbSe2 is characterized to be metallic and exhibits superconductivity, which shows great potential for the development of ultrathin transparent conducting materials and 2D superconductors.7 Practical applications of Nb-based TMDs such as in lithium ion batteries8 and dye-sensitized solar cells9 have also been demonstrated.
More recently, van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of distinct 2D materials have opened up a new paradigm to manipulate nanoelectronic devices. Because different 2D materials are assembled vertically via the weak vdW interactions, their isolated properties can be preserved to a large extent. However, combining together different materials rarely leads to a simple arithmetic sum of their properties, giving rise to novel and unexpected behaviors. For example, a few-layer WSe2 FET with NbSe2 contacts and a graphite gate was constructed, which exhibited nearly ohmic behavior and phonon-limited mobility in the hole channel, indicating that the contacts are highly transparent.10 Besides, a true 2D field-effect transistor (FET) was constructed using heterostructures of graphene, MoS2 and SiO2, where Au acts as the source/drain electrode, SiO2 as the high-k dielectric, and MoS2 as the active channel material.11
An inevitable challenge faced by TMD-based devices is to minimize the contact resistance, since the created Schottky barriers dominate the transport behavior.12 Since there is currently no stable and reliable doping method to lower the contact resistance, it is highly desirable to explore suitable metals and contact configurations which have the maximum potential to form low-resistance metal–TMDs contacts. Liu et al. reported that the Fermi level pinning (FLP) effect is weak for the vdW junctions, and the p-type (n-type) Schottky barriers can be reduced by using high (low) work function metals as electrodes.13 Therefore, metallic NbSe2 with a relatively high work function demonstrates the potential to be a promising electrode for low p-type Schottky barrier contact with semiconductors. In view of the similar lattice structure, MSe2 monolayers with proper work functions are considered to be ideal channel materials that can be combined with metallic NbSe2 to reduce the contact resistance. In addition, tuning the Schottky barrier could reduce the contact resistance and modulate carrier polarity in the channel for transistors,13 thus the importance of Schottky barrier tuning has also been underlined in devices.14,15 Considering that the constituent MSe2 and NbSe2 have been synthesized already, earlier growth studies and theoretical analysis of stability let us expect that these composite structures can be readily produced and remain stable in diverse applications.
In this work, we propose a novel kind of hybrid MSe2/NbSe2 vdW heterostructure and systematically investigate their structural and electronic properties using density functional theory (DFT). Our results suggest that the properties of MSe2 and NbSe2 are preserved upon their contact. It is shown that significantly lower Schottky barriers are obtained, which indicates tremendous potential in applications in electronic devices. In addition, we find that the barrier can be effectively tuned upon the application of vertical compressive pressure, in-plane biaxial strain and an electric field. In light of these properties, MSe2/NbSe2 vdW heterostructures find opportunities in applications in FET. In addition to choosing metals with proper work function, we demonstrate that the detailed physics of the metal/semiconductor interfaces should be understood to obtain low contact resistance.
2. Computational method
The first-principles DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).16,17 All the calculations were carried out with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)18 in the framework of generalized gradient approximation (GGA)19 for the exchange–correlation functional, and the projector augmented wave (PAW)20,21 was adopted for the electron–ion interactions. The cut-off kinetic energy for plane waves was set to 450 eV. Structures were fully relaxed until the force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å−1 and the convergence tolerance for energy was 10−5 eV. A Monkhorst–Pack mesh of 9 × 9 × 1 and 15 × 15 × 1 was used to sample the Brillouin zone for geometry optimization and static electronic structure calculations, respectively.22 The vacuum space in the z-direction was larger than 20 Å between two adjacent images to avoid spurious interactions. Because the PBE scheme tends to underestimate the band gap, the screened hybrid HSE06 functional was also used to check the band structures.23 To correctly describe the vdW interactions, we employed empirical pairwise corrections proposed by Grimme24 in terms of the DFT+D2 scheme.
The transport properties were simulated in the framework of nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF-DFT) as implemented in the Nanodcal package,25,26 in conjunction with the DFT method. The optimized structures using DFT in consideration of vdW corrections were employed in the transport calculations. The double-zeta polarization (DZP) basis set was employed to expand the electron wave functions and the exchange–correlation potential was treated at the PBE level of theory. The electronic structures of the electrodes and central region were calculated with 25 × 1 × 15 and 25 × 1 × 1 k-point grids, respectively. The energy tolerance for self-consistency was restricted to 10−4 eV. Here we preliminarily explored the transmission coefficients, and following previous research studies, the effect of the dielectric region is not considered. In addition, the gate was generally introduced to change the potential perpendicular to the channel. Here, the transmission coefficients were simulated under zero-bias gate voltage. The transmission coefficients were determined by the equation:T = Tr[GrΓLGaΓR]where Gr and Ga are retarded and advanced Green's functions of the system, respectively; ΓL and ΓR are linewidth functions that describe the coupling between the scattering region and the leads.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric and electronic structures of MSe2/NbSe2 heterobilayers
It is known that MSe2 monolayers exhibit two possible structures, namely, H or T phase. Considering that the H phase is more stable than the T phase for most MSe2 structures,27 we only employ the H phase structures in this work, as shown in Fig. 1a. The lattice parameters of MSe2 and NbSe2 are 3.32 Å and 3.48 Å, respectively, which are in good agreement with previous studies.28,29 The band structures of three considered monolayers are shown in Fig. 1b–d, which reveal that the MoSe2 and WSe2 monolayers show semiconducting properties with a direct band gap while the NbSe2 monolayer is metallic. At the PBE level of theory, band gaps of 1.64 eV for MoSe2 and 1.43 eV for WSe2 are predicted, while the HSE06 functional can broaden the band gaps (1.88 eV for MoSe2 and 1.89 eV for WSe2) with the dispersion relationship changed little compared with the PBE functional. The NbSe2 monolayer still maintains metallic properties according to the band structure calculated using the HSE functional, with VB and CB being stretched compared with those at the PBE level of theory.

When the MSe2 and NbSe2 monolayers are stacked vertically to form vdW heterostructures, it will result in a relatively small lattice mismatch of 4.6%. Considering that the position of W/Mo with respect to Nb finds several choices, we therefore take four different stacking types into account to get an equilibrium configuration. As demonstrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†), among these configurations, namely, AA, C1, AB and C2,27 the total energy suggests that the AB stacking pattern is the most stable one, which is adopted in the following calculations. In this case, the vertical interlayer distance d between two Se atoms is 3.15 Å for MoSe2/NbSe2 and 3.09 Å for WSe2/NbSe2 heterobilayers.
To further determine the stability of the hybrid vdW heterostructures, the interface binding energies of MoSe2/NbSe2 and WSe2/NbSe2 are calculated, defined as Eb = E(MSe2/NbSe2) − E(MSe2) − E(NbSe2), where E(MSe2/NbSe2) is the total energy of the MSe2/NbSe2 heterobilayers, and E(MSe2) and E(NbSe2) are the total energies of the isolated MSe2 and NbSe2 layers, respectively. Here, Eb values are about −1.62 and −1.88 eV for MoSe2/NbSe2 and WSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures with AB stacking, respectively. As expected, the negative binding energies suggest stable interface structures, indicating the feasibility of MSe2/NbSe2 hybrids in experiments.
Band structures calculated using the PBE functional for MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures with the equilibrium interlayer distance are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), while those at the HSE level of theory are shown in Fig. 2a and b. It can be found that the individual bands for isolated MSe2 and NbSe2 monolayers (see Fig. 1) can be distinguished from the band structures of the heterobilayers. The semiconducting properties of MSe2 and the metallic behavior of NbSe2 are preserved upon stacking, indicating a typical behavior of 2D vdW heterostructures. To prove this point, we superposed the band structures of two freestanding constituents (as shown in Fig. S2c and d, ESI†). The results demonstrate a near-perfect agreement between the band structures of heterostructures and the superposition of those of monolayers, revealing that there is nearly no band rehybridization but only a minor band realignment at the interface. In addition, we found that the valance band maximum (VBM) of MSe2 being transferred from the K point to the Γ point with a narrower and indirect band gap.

(d) Schematic illustration of the band alignment when MoSe2 contacts with NbSe2. The charge redistribution at the MoSe2/NbSe2 interface results in the formation of a discontinuity μIS. 
Interestingly, similar to the heterostructures of phosphorene and graphene,30 if we consider a current-in-plane (CIP) structure, there will be a small band bending as one moves from the stacked MoSe2/NbSe2 region to the pristine MoSe2 monolayer region. Moving toward and anticipating MoSe2/NbSe2 to be applied as the electrode to form two-probe transport junctions, an important issue is the band bending between the MoSe2/NbSe2 part and the freestanding MoSe2 part. The band bending can be estimated by the difference between the Fermi level of the hybrid part and the pristine part:31 ΔEF = W − Wsemi, where W is the work function of the hybrid MoSe2/NbSe2 part and Wsemi is the work function of the pristine semiconducting MoSe2. As shown in Fig. 2c, the band bending is estimated to be about 0.78 eV, indicating electrons will be transferred from the pristine MoSe2 to the hybrid MoSe2/NbSe2. Hence, the contact will lead to a p-type CIP device. Similar to the n-type Cu/BP contact (ΔEF ≈ −0.7 to −0.8 eV),32 from the CIP point of view, the smaller the offset the better the contact.
From the point of view of devices, it is significant to investigate the Schottky barrier height (SBH) when using metallic NbSe2 as the metal contact and semiconducting MSe2 as the channel. A Schottky barrier is generally determined by the energy difference between the Fermi level and the semiconductor band edges at the metal/semiconductor interface.13 Therefore, a p-type Schottky barrier (ΦBp) is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi level and VBM. Similarly, an n-type Schottky barrier (ΦBn) is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi level and the conduction band minimum (CBM). When ΦBp or ΦBn is a negative value, it will be an ohmic contact. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, it can be observed that VBM of the MSe2 is close to the Fermi level, forming a p-type Schottky contact with a small barrier (ΦBp = 0.37 eV for MoSe2/NbSe2 and 0.18 eV for WSe2/NbSe2) at the interface. Note that significant charge transfer due to the formation of heterostructures will shift the Fermi level from its original position, leading to a deviation from the ideal Schottky–Mott model. Therefore, the situation is more complicated for MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures, where a discontinuity (μIS) of about −0.58 eV for MoSe2 (see Fig. 2d) between the vacuum levels was observed, which is induced by charge rearrangement upon the formation of the interface. Hence the corresponding ΦBp and ΦBn can be rewritten asΦBp = Eip − W − μISΦBn = W + μIS − Eeawhere W is the work function of the metal, and Eip and Eea are the ionization potential and electron affinity of the free-standing monolayers, respectively. According to the equations, the Schottky barriers are calculated to be 0.36 and 0.16 eV for MoSe2/NbSe2 and WSe2/NbSe2, respectively. These values are very close to the results based on the band structures. The Schottky barriers of MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures are obviously smaller than those of other hybrid systems,33 demonstrating the low-resistance of the contacts and enormous application potential in FETs.
3.2 Tuning Schottky barrier via vertical compressive pressure
Regarding the device applications, a tunable Schottky barrier is significant to extend its application fields.34 Considering that the electronic properties of TMD-based vdW heterostructures are sensitive to other external conditions such as the interlayer coupling,35,36 we adopted various interface distances of MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures to investigate the electronic properties. The controllability of the interface distance in experiments can be realized via vertical compressive pressure (P), and the conversion relation can be written as36  where E2 and E1 are total energies of the systems as the interface separations are d2 and d1, respectively, and A is the area of the cell. As shown in Fig. 3a–e, with the interface distance decreasing from 3.2 to 2.0 Å, the VBM of MoSe2 gradually increases up to the Fermi level and crosses the VBM, while the CBM almost has no change. As a result, the p-type Schottky barrier will gradually decrease until the barrier height changes to a negative value, demonstrating the formation of an ohmic contact. It should be noted that the change is reversible as the structures restore the equilibrium distance without pressure, suggesting an application potential in sensors.36

(f) Evolution of the band edges as a function of the external field for an MoSe2/NbSe2 heterobilayer. Band structures of the MoSe2/NbSe2 heterobilayer under different external fields of (g) E = −0.08 V Å−1, (h) E = 0 V Å−1 and (i) E = 0.10 V Å−1. The blue, orange and red lines represent the contributions from NbSe2, CB and VB of MoSe2, respectively. The Fermi level is set to zero. 
As the interface distance decreases from 3.2 to 2.0 Å, the charge transfer between MSe2 and NbSe2 would be enhanced, similar to the case of MoS2 on transition metal substrates.37 In order to visualize the charge redistribution and interpret the charge transfer mechanism between MSe2 and NbSe2, we calculated the plane-averaged charge density difference for MoSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures, which can be defined as Δρ(z) = ρ(MoSe2/NbSe2) − ρ(MoSe2) − ρ(NbSe2). Here, ρ(MoSe2/NbSe2) is the plane-averaged density of the MoSe2/NbSe2 heterostructure, and ρ(MoSe2) and ρ(NbSe2) are the plane-averaged densities of isolated MoSe2 and NbSe2, respectively. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), there is a charge accumulation at the interface region close to the NbSe2 monolayer, while a charge depletion region at the MoSe2 layer exists. In addition, we observe that more electrons being transferred from MoSe2 to NbSe2 as the interface distance decreases from 3.2 to 2.0 Å, resulting in a shift of the Fermi level of the MoSe2 monolayer. And this is the reason that the ohmic contact will arise with the Fermi level crossing the VBM of MoSe2 when the interface distance decreases.
To effectively control the interlayer distance experimentally, many efforts have been made. It has been demonstrated that, for example, the coupling of MS2/MoS2 vdW heterostructures could be tuned via vacuum thermal annealing.38 Therefore, adjusting the interlayer distance holds enormous potential to affect the Schottky barrier and related optoelectronic properties of MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures.
3.3 Effects of electric field on the Schottky barrier of MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures
In Fig. 3f, we show the change of VBM and CBM of MoSe2 under an electric field (perpendicular to the bilayers), and the corresponding band structures are shown in Fig. 3g–i. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 3g, when a negative electric field is applied on the MoSe2/NbSe2 heterostructure, the VBM of MoSe2 moves up and crosses the Fermi level, indicating the formation of an ohmic contact at the MoSe2/NbSe2 interface. However, Fig. 3i shows that when the electric field is 0.1 V Å−1, the CBM of MoSe2 is closer to the Fermi level than the VBM, which induces a transition from the p-type to the n-type Schottky contact. Likewise, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), when applying a negative electric field of about –0.04 V Å−1 on the WSe2/NbSe2 heterostructure, a transition from the p-type Schottky contact to the ohmic contact is presented. When the electric field is 0.11 V Å−1, the CBM of WSe2 is closer to the Fermi level than the VBM, demonstrating the formation of an n-type Schottky contact. This evolution of the Schottky barrier in the MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructure can be understood as follows: the electric field induces the electrostatic potential difference at the MSe2/NbSe2 interfaces and influences the charge rearrangement between MSe2 and NbSe2. Therefore, the application of an external electric field can be an efficient route to tune the Schottky contacts.
3.4 Strain effects on the Schottky barrier of MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures
Strain modulation has been widely considered in 2D materials to tune the electronic structures.39–41Fig. 4 shows the band structures of the MoSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures under different strains. Our results indicate that as the strain varies from −1% to 6%, the NbSe2 monolayer retains metallic properties. The strain moves upward the VBM of the MoSe2 monolayer, thus the p-type Schottky barrier ΦBp decreases. In addition, tensile strain can turn the MoSe2 monolayer into an indirect semiconductor as the VBM is relocated from the K point to the Γ point. As shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†), the VBM of the MoSe2 monolayer continues to shift upward and crosses the Fermi level when applying about 5% biaxial strain, which illustrates the formation of the ohmic contact at the MoSe2/NbSe2 interface.
 Fig. 4  Band structures of the MoSe2/NbSe2 heterobilayers with biaxial strain of (a) −1%, (b) 0%, (c) 2%, (d) 4% and (e) 6%, respectively. The blue, orange and red lines represent the contributions from NbSe2, CB and VB of MoSe2, respectively. The Fermi level is set to zero. 
Fig. S5b–d (ESI†) show the projected density of states (PDOS) for Mo atoms (mainly d states) under different strains. It can be observed that the Mo-d orbitals play a dominant role in the SBH. As the strain varies from 0% to 6%, the occupied and unoccupied Mo-d orbitals will move toward the Fermi level. As the Mo-d orbitals cross the Fermi level, the in-plane strain in MoSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures induces a transition from a p-type Schottky to an ohmic contact. Likewise, as depicted in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the strain moves upward the VBM of the WSe2 monolayer, leading to the decrease of the p-type Schottky barrier ΦBp. The VBM of the WSe2 monolayer will cross the Fermi level with the tensile strain being 2%, demonstrating the formation of the ohmic contact at the WSe2/NbSe2 interface.
3.5 Quantum transport simulations
A two-probe model was built to simulate a MSe2 FET. The optimized MSe2/NbSe2 systems are chosen as the electrodes and bare MSe2 is adopted as the channel of the FET. The lengths of the left electrode and right electrode are semi-infinite. In the energy band model, the electronic properties of the electrode region and the channel are treated separately, ignoring the coupling between the two regions and thus possible Fermi level pinning.42–44 To better evaluate the SBH of a transistor, quantum transport properties are investigated in the framework of NEGF-DFT, in which the electrode and the channel are calculated as a whole and the coupling between the electrode region and the channel is taken into account. As shown in Fig. 5a, the MSe2/NbSe2 contact acts as a left (right) semi-infinite electrode and connects with the central scattering region (MSe2 channel). The transmission spectra of MSe2 with the NbSe2 electrode under zero bias gate voltage are presented in Fig. 5b. The transport hole (electron) SBH Φhtrans (Φetrans) is the difference between the Fermi level and the VBM (CBM) of channel MSe2. The results show that the p-type monolayer MSe2 FET is formed with Φhtrans being 0.34 and 0.18 eV for MoSe2 and WSe2, respectively. These results further prove the accuracy of our exploration, manifesting the great application potential of MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures in FETs.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, the structural and electronic properties of MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures are systematically investigated using the first-principles calculations and quantum transport simulations. The p-type Schottky contacts with a small Schottky barrier are formed in the MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures. These findings indicate the application potential of MSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures in electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as FETs, in which MSe2 can be regarded as a channel, and NbSe2 is transferred to the MSe2 layer to form source/drain electrodes. Moreover, the Schottky barrier in MSe2/NbSe2 can be tuned through the application of vertical compressive pressure, tensile strain and electric fields, further prompting the current flowing from the source to drain electrodes of MSe2 FETs. This work not only provides insights into the fundamental properties of heterostructures but also uncovers the great potential of 2D materials for applications in electric devices.
