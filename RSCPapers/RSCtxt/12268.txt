    , Accepted 29th May 2023First published on 30th May 2023AbstractThe urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has emerged as one of the promising half-reactions for energy conversion and storage devices due to its low thermodynamic potential (−0.46 V vs. SHE). However, the complex 6-electron transfer process in the UOR causes intrinsic sluggish kinetics, still requiring a significant enhancement in the catalytic activity and energy utilization of electrocatalysts. Hence, this review aims to provide comprehensive insights into how to design high-performance electrocatalysts for the UOR and develop highly efficient UOR-based energy devices. We first highlight the recent progress in the proposed mechanisms (e.g., adsorbate evolution, lattice oxygen involvement, and chemical–electrochemical processes) and general electrochemical evaluation standard parameters for the UOR. Subsequently, five effective strategies of nanocatalyst design are summarized and discussed for improving electrocatalytic urea oxidation. Rationally engineering nanocatalysts' crystal and geometric structure is available for increasing the densities of catalytic active sites. The improvement of intrinsic activity can depend on heteroatom doping and defect engineering to adjust the electronic and coordination environment of active sites. The heterojunction construction strategy can also be adopted to regulate the Janus charge distribution for the adsorption of urea. In addition, relevant practical applications are introduced in detail, such as photoelectrochemical urea splitting for hydrogen production, urea-assisted reversible zinc–air batteries (ZABs), and direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs).

1. Introduction
Urea constitutes one of the fundamental metabolites engendered by animate creatures in the realm of nature. Its abundant presence subsists in nitrogenous fertilizers, frequently utilized in agriculture, and in the drainage that emanates from factories (Fig. 1).1 Generally, urea can be decomposed into ammonia by the natural urease housed in specific microorganisms, an evocation of innocuousness, non-toxicity, and environmentally friendly biological enzymes.2 However, untreated ammonia can lead to the production of harmful substances, such as nitrites and ammonium sulfate, causing environmental degradation.3–5 Electrochemical urea oxidation has been intensively investigated to avoid the generation of ammonia, and reduce harm to air quality, soil fertility, and human health.6–8 Besides, the development of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is promising for boosting highly efficient hydrogen production, improving the energy conversion efficiency of electrochemical devices, and alleviating resource shortages. The theoretical potential of urea-assisted water splitting with the anodic UOR is 0.37 V, significantly lower than that of traditional water splitting (1.23 V).9,10 Nevertheless, the UOR is a complex 6-electron transfer process with very sluggish reaction kinetics and unclear mechanisms compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with 2-electron participation and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with 4-electron participation. More importantly, side reactions may occur during the UOR process, and produce pollutants, such as NO2− and NO3−.11,12 Therefore, electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity are required to accelerate the reaction rate of the UOR and increase the effectiveness of hydrogen production.

Inspired by the typical structure of the active sites in urease, nickel-based catalysts have recently received remarkable attention. In 2009, Botte's group employed nickel catalysts to convert urea into hydrogen, showing remarkable performance and stability in an alkaline environment. It is noteworthy that Ni metal demonstrated superior catalytic activity compared with noble metals such as Pt and Rh, conducive to reducing catalyst costs, which is a departure from the trends observed in the HER and OER.13 Moreover, other 3d transition-metal-based catalysts (e.g., Co, Fe, and Mo) are also explored.8,14–21 For instance, the potential of Co(OH)2 modified with Cl exceeds 1.60 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and γ-Fe2O3/IF provides a current density of 30 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.749 V.8,16 The high overpotential of these catalysts impedes the attainment of optimal energy conversion efficiency. To improve the UOR performance of the electrocatalysts, two aspects should be emphatically considered, one being the number of active sites, and the other being the intrinsic activity of the single active site.22 Based on these, effective and numerous active sites can be created by constructing the morphology and surface defects of catalysts.23 Geometric engineering can be adopted to obtain unique structures such as vertically aligned nanosheet arrays, hierarchically porous hollow cages, and hollow nanocrystals with open structures, exposing more active sites and accelerating electron transfer and mass transport.24–26 The introduction of defects causes a redistribution of charge around the active sites, affecting the adsorption energy of the intermediates, thus resulting in increased catalytic activity for the UOR.19,27,28 In addition, some researchers have designed catalysts by incorporating external elements to enhance the intrinsic activity along with the exploration of the UOR mechanism, such as heteroatom doping regulation and heterostructure construction.21,29–34
Advanced UOR catalysts have been recently explored for energy conversion devices.10 Developing urea electrolysis and photoelectrochemical urea splitting technologies with anodic UOR instead of OER can significantly improve hydrogen production efficiency.6,24,35,36 In ZABs, the voltage gap during charging and discharging can be decreased by replacing the OER with UOR, thus enhancing the energy conversion efficiency between chemical energy and electrical energy.37–39 In addition, urea with rich sources and high security can participate in oxidation reactions of fuel cells, which will contribute to the development of renewable energy, sewage treatment, and environmental issues.10,40,41 It's worth noting that urea can be gradually consumed during the operation of these electrochemical devices. Thus, a continuous supply of urea is required to maintain the energy conversion efficiency.
The recent summarization of the synthetic strategy of catalysts,9,42 the development of nickel-based catalysts,43 progress in potential applications, etc., has enabled remarkable advances in the UOR.10 However, there is a lack of systematic discussion in addressing reaction mechanisms and developing structure–performance–application relationships at the atomic scale for the UOR. Herein, this review provides a fresh perspective on the recent advancements in the aspects of UOR mechanisms, design strategies of electrocatalysts, and valuable applications for the UOR. First, possible UOR mechanistic insights and essential electrochemical parameters are elaborated to rationally guide the design of efficient electrocatalysts and standardly evaluate their performances. Subsequently, we highlight five modulation strategies of electrocatalysts toward catalyzing urea oxidation, including crystal structure control, geometric engineering, heteroatom doping, defect engineering, and heterojunction construction. For each strategy, the impact of the physicochemical properties of the catalysts on catalytic activity is discussed in detail taking into consideration the specific UOR process. Representative electrochemical devices composed of nanocatalysts are introduced to illustrate the potential application of the UOR. Finally, we briefly outline the remaining challenges and perspectives in the urea oxidation field to promote the development of revolutionized energy technology.
2. Fundamental urea oxidation reaction for designing efficient electrocatalysts
So far, a series of electrooxidation reactions based on methanol,44–46 glycerol,47,48 5-hydroxymethylfurfural,49 glucose,50,51 and hydrazine hydrate52–54 have been identified as viable alternatives to the OER for enabling efficient hydrogen production via hydrolysis (Table 1). The required potentials are low, while some high value-added chemicals can be generated, such as formate, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, and glucaric acid. However, the development of these reactions faces challenges. There are multiple side reactions that easily occur, leading to a decrease in the yields of the target product. In addition, the separation of target products from the electrolyte is also a complex process. Take the hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction as an example, the direct decomposition of hydrazine hydrate to N2 and H2 (N2H4 → N2 + H2) is favored over electrochemical reactions (N2H4 + 4OH− → N2 + 4H2O + 4e−), which limits the utilization rate of hydrazine hydrate. Moreover, hydrazine hydrate is inflammable and inherently toxic, posing significant risks to storage and human health. With the aim of addressing these problems, extensive and significant studies have been conducted on the UOR in view of the non-toxic, low-cost (0.014 $ per g), and easy-storage features of urea. In addition to the efficient hydrogen production, waste liquids containing urea can be efficiently converted into facile CO2, N2, and H2O products, alleviating the energy crisis and environmental pollution at the same time.

2.1. The mechanisms of the urea oxidation reaction
Similar to water splitting, the HER and the UOR occur simultaneously at the cathode and the anode in urea-assisted electrochemical devices (Fig. 2). The UOR generally applies in alkaline electrolyte, and the equation of the overall urea-assisted water-splitting reaction is shown as follows:9,55 Anode: CO(NH2)2 + 6OH− → N2 + 5H2O + CO2 + 6e− E = −0.46 V vs. SHE(1) Cathode: 6H2O + 6e− → 3H2 + 6OH− E = −0.83 V vs. SHE(2) Overall: CO(NH2)2 + H2O → N2 + 3H2 + CO2 E = 0.37 V(3)

(b) Schematic diagram of water splitting, in which the cathode and anode correspond to the HER and OER. Note that the colors of the various atoms are red for O, blue for N, gray for C, and white for H. 
The thermodynamic potential required for electrochemical urea electrolysis is 0.37 V, which is substantially lower than that required for water electrolysis (1.23 V). Nevertheless, the UOR contains adsorption and desorption of multiple intermediates compared with the OER, leading to slow reaction kinetics and complicated reaction processes, which affect the efficiency of hydrogen production. Thus, it is difficult but essential to construct appropriate catalysts to accelerate the reaction rate of the UOR.
Understanding the UOR mechanism is of great significance for guiding the rational design of high-performance catalysts at the molecular or atomic level. Up to now, several different reaction pathways and mechanisms have been proposed through a series of experiments and theoretical calculations. Representative UOR mechanisms are discussed in this section based on common nickel catalysts.
The adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) is properly appreciated in the UOR.56 As shown in Fig. 3a, three possible reaction pathways happen on NiOOH, with similar elementary steps of urea molecule adsorption (bridge coordination), N–H dehydrogenation (4e−), C–N bond cleavage, N–N coupling, *COOH oxidation (2e−) and CO2 desorption. The N–H dehydrogenation may occur at different amino group positions (paths 1 and 2). Then, the intermediate rotation steps are required for nitrogen atom bonding. By contrast, in path 3, the nitrogen atoms are coupled before complete deprotonation and subsequent dehydrogenation of N–H symmetrically happens on two amino groups. The reaction rates of these elementary steps are distinct. Among them, the *CO2 desorption step is claimed as the most common rate-determining step of urea oxidation. For instance, Zhu et al. demonstrated that the energy barrier of CO2 desorption from the Ni(OH)2 surface is the highest in the whole catalytic process. The experimental investigations confirmed that accelerating the reaction rate for CO2 removal steps via doping S atoms into Ni(OH)2 can significantly improve the overall UOR rate.57 Moreover, the delay of *CO2 desorption sometimes leads to catalyst deactivation. Stevenson's group discovered that the normalized current density of LaNiO3 had decreased by 38% after 50 cycles due to the catalyst being poisoned and the formation of NiCO3 on the catalyst.58

(c) Chemical-electrochemical processes. (d and e) The possible side reactions of UOR. Note that the colors of the various atoms are red for O, blue for N, gray for C, and white for H. 
Based on the Gibbs free energy profiles obtained by DFT calculation and electrochemical test, the lattice oxygen involving mechanism (LOM) with Ni4+ as an active site has been proposed by Zhang et al. (Fig. 3b).59 In contrast to AEM, LOM has a faster reaction kinetics and involves the redox of lattice oxygen. Specifically, the surface of the catalyst is found to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium during the LOM pathway. The activated lattice oxygen on the catalyst's surface reacts with the intermediates to create oxygen vacancies during the UOR. Following that, OH− in the electrolyte combines with the oxygen vacancy to form a new lattice of oxygen, thereby completing a cycle. To elucidate the LOM, Liu's group conducted in situ electrochemical analysis and calculations based on LiNiO2 with rich Li-vacancies and high valence active sites (Ni4+).60 However, it is reasonable to postulate that the structure of nanocatalysts may be susceptible to damage during the LOM pathway of the UOR due to the participation of lattice oxygen.61–63
In addition, another mechanism initially proposed by Geng et al. includes two stages, a chemical process (urea decomposition reaction) and an electrochemical process (Fig. 3c).64 In detail, the urea molecule is adsorbed onto the Ni active site through O-coordination and decomposed to NH3 (*CO(NH2)2 → *OCONH2 → *NH2 → NH3). Then NH3 is adsorbed onto the Fe active site and produces N2 by electrochemical oxidation (*NH3 → *NH2 → *NH2*NH3 → *NH2*NH2 → *NH*NH2 → *NHNH2 → *NNH2+ → *NNH → N2). The rate-determining step of these two stages is CO2 desorption and *NH2*NH2 dehydrogenation. Interestingly, the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ is a competitive reaction with the urea decomposition reaction. Besides, the formation of NiOOH species affects the stability of the catalyst to be applied in the catalytic process. Later, Ni3S2 was prepared by Xiao et al., which has strong binding energy to intermediate products (*CO(NH2)2 and *OCONH2). Ni3S2 can spontaneously reconstruct to generate surface hydroxyl ligands while avoiding the generation of NiOOH species, thereby improving its structural stability during the UOR.65
The above possible reaction paths are demonstrated based on 100% nitrogen selectivity. Nonetheless, some by-products may be generated due to preferential C–N cleavage and OH− attack during the UOR, such as NO3−, NO2−, etc. For example, Yang's group found that NO2− was the main product by chromatographic techniques, which contradicts previous perceptions of the UOR.11 They demonstrated different UOR processes by exploring the correlation of products with intermediate species and analyzing the source of N element in the products by isotope labeling (Fig. 3d). In the major pathway, after adsorption and one-step deprotonation of urea, the C–N bond breaks to form *NH2, which then reacts with OH− to form NO2−. Notably, under high urea concentration, the *NH2 adsorbed on the catalyst can react with the NH2 group of the free urea molecule to construct an intermolecular N–N coupling, thus promoting the generation of N2. In another example, Klinkova and co-workers showed two different vacancy-dependent pathways (Fig. 3e).12 A single vacancy on the surface of NiOOH favors C–N cleavage and NOx− formation by DFT calculation. Importantly, changing the electronic structure of Ni by doping Cu can inhibit the peroxide reaction and increase the selectivity of N2.
In addition, different UOR processes exist in neutral or acidic electrolytes.66–69 NaCl solution can be chosen as the neutral electrolyte to simulate the urine environment containing Cl−. Cl− is first converted to Cl2, and then reacts with the water to generate HClO, Cl− and H+. The urea was oxidized by HClO to evolve CO2 and N2. It is worth noting that the presence of H+ can create localized acidity, which may shorten the lifespan of non-noble metal-based catalysts. Hence, there are few types of research on acidic UOR catalysts.70,71
In summary, urea oxidation has recently emerged as a promising research direction for energy conversion. However, the underlying mechanisms of this reaction remain poorly understood in comparison to well-established reactions like the OER. This is attributed to the complex reaction steps, intermediates, and multiple products involved in urea oxidation. Sensitive and operando techniques can be developed to characterize the reaction intermediates and their interactions with catalytic active sites, providing effective protocols for the design of high-performance electrocatalysts. A more comprehensive understanding of urea oxidation would open new avenues for constructing efficient energy conversion systems.
2.2. Electrochemical parameters for evaluating the catalytic activity of UOR electrocatalysts
In the laboratory, the electrochemical test method of the UOR is fairly similar to other electrochemical reactions. A series of electrochemical parameters are obtained to evaluate the catalytic performance of the UOR catalyst using an electrochemical workstation. In most cases, the test with the three-electrode system is carried out in the electrolytic cell, including the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode (Fig. 4a).72 Among them, the working electrode is composed of a conductive substrate and catalyst. The Ni foam (NF) is commonly utilized as the conductive substrate due to its porous structure, large specific surface area, superior electrical conductivity, and corrosion resistance.73,74 In the following section, we will briefly introduce the important parameters, which can be used to comprehensively evaluate the electrochemical performance of catalysts in the UOR process, including overpotentials (η), Tafel slope, electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and long-term stability (Fig. 4b).
 Fig. 4  (a) The diagram of a three-electrode electrolytic cell and (b) several parameters for evaluating electrocatalytic performance. 

2.2.1. Overpotential (η). 

η is one of the most fundamental metrics for assessing the catalytic performance of UOR catalysts, and is calculated as the difference between the actual test potential and the thermodynamic value under equilibrium conditions. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) can be carried out to directly assess the current density variation with potential. A lower overpotential value at a given current density indicates better catalytic activity. The current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm−2 are usually chosen to compare the level of overpotential.26,28,75


2.2.2. Tafel slope. 
The Tafel formula is an empirical formula proposed by Tafel, which connects the chemical reaction rate with the overpotential. The formula is as follows: η = blog(j) + a(4)  Here, η stands for the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, j represents the current density and takes the absolute value in the formula, j0 represents the exchange current density, and α is the charge transfer coefficient of the oxidation or reduction reaction, reflecting the rate of electron transfer. n is the number of electrons transferred during the reaction. T, R and F represent thermodynamic temperature, ideal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), and Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), respectively.76,77
The Tafel diagram can be obtained by drawing the logarithmic current density and overpotential according to the Tafel formula, eqn (4), showing how fast the overpotential changes as the current density increases by a factor of ten. The smaller the Tafel slope, the greater the charge transfer rate at the interface, indicating the UOR electrocatalyst performs a fast reaction kinetics. Some measurements are adopted to obtain Tafel plots, including voltammetry, chronoamperometry (I–t curve at a fixed potential), chronopotentiometry (E–t curve at a fixed current density), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).76 Converting the LSV curve acquired by a low scanning rate is the most often used and straightforward method. However, the derived Tafel slope is inaccurate since the LSV curve is not measured under steady-state conditions. The chronoamperometry/chronopotentiometry approach is a suitable method to obtain an accurate and stable polarization curve under steady-state conditions. Even then, the effect of the catalyst's intrinsic resistance on the Tafel slope cannot be eliminated. Hu's group measured a plot at different overpotentials with variable intervals by EIS and found that the logarithmic reciprocal of the charge transfer resistance corresponds to the overpotential.78 The resulting Tafel slope overcomes the effect of the intrinsic resistance of the catalyst and accurately reflects the intrinsic activity of the catalyst.


2.2.3. Electrochemical surface area (ECSA). 
The effective area involved in electrochemical reactions is referred to as ECSA. The ECSA corresponds to the accessible active sites of catalysts and electrochemical processes, which can influence the mass transfer and be used to evaluate the catalytic activity to a certain extent. There are some available methods to measure the ECSA for specific materials, such as the double-layer capacitance, surface redox peak area, hydrogen underpotential deposition and so on.79 Take the general double-layer capacitance method for example, the active surface area of the electrocatalyst can be indirectly determined from the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value, which is proportional to ECSA. The Cdl is the ratio of the double-layer capacitance current (ic) in the non-faradaic region to the scan speed (v) of cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves. In addition, for Ni-based catalysts, the surface redox reaction of Ni2+/Ni3+ in CV can be obtained to assess the ECSA since the ECSA is proportional to the charge Q required for the conversion between Ni3+ and Ni2+. The calculation formula is ECSA = Q/0.257 × m, where m is the loading amount of the Ni-based catalyst, and 0.257 is the charge that represents the reduction of the NiOOH monolayer to Ni(OH)2.80 This method can also be applied to other 3d metal elements undergoing redox. For instance, Jaramillo's group carried out a CV test of Mn (3+) oxide thin film in a nitrogen-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte to acquire its ECSA by integrating the charge transfer through the oxidation peak of Mn3+/Mn4+.81 Notably, there is no uniform standard for the ECSA result due to it being diverse in different electrochemical processes and catalysts. The ECSAs are usually considered to compare the catalytic activities of similar catalysts and the intrinsic activity can be normalized by the ECSA value.


2.2.4. Stability. 
Stability is a critical evaluation parameter for UOR electrocatalysts, and has direct implications for their service life and practical application. The chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, and CV cycling methods are widely employed to evaluate the stability of electrocatalysts.76 During chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry measurements, the variation of potential or current density over time is captured by setting the current density or potential to a constant value. Less decrease of the potential or current density suggests better stability of the catalysts. On the other hand, the CV cycling method represents a dynamic test method. In this technique, the overpotential at a particular current density corresponding to the initial and terminal polarization curves can be compared over thousands of CV cycles at a high scanning speed. Higher stability is indicated by less difference in overpotential. Additionally, the assessment of catalyst stability should encompass changes in the chemical composition, crystal structure, and morphological configuration of the catalyst after the electrochemical stability test.31,34 Apart from conventional characterization techniques (e.g., scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), the real-time change of catalysts can be tracked using in situ characterization methods (e.g., in situ Raman spectroscopy) during the UOR, enabling the evaluation of the catalyst's structural stability.82,83

3. Nanoscale structure design strategies of highly efficient UOR electrocatalysts
As previously discussed, the slow kinetics of urea oxidation results in significant power waste, highlighting the urgent need for low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts.43 Generally, the intrinsic activity and the number of active sites for nanomaterials determine the catalytic activity.22,84 In addition, electron transport and mass transfer should also be considered since they can affect the reaction rate. It is noteworthy that the methods employed to enhance the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts are not necessarily exclusive and sometimes coexist with synergistic regulation.85 Thus, starting from these perspectives, considerable research has been devoted to nanoscale-structure design to obtain high-performance electrocatalysts for the UOR (Table 2). In this section, five specific modification strategies, including crystal phase control, geometric engineering, heteroatom doping, defect engineering, and heterojunction construction, will be summarized (Fig. 5). Also, this section provides a thorough discussion of the relationship between the modification strategies and improvement in UOR performance.

 Fig. 5  Schematic diagram of nanostructure design strategies for efficient UOR electrocatalysts. 
3.1. Crystal structure control
The catalytic performance of a particular nanocatalyst depends heavily on the specific crystal structure with more well-defined active sites (e.g., high-valency Ni species). For example, Wu et al. prepared α-Ni(OH)2 and β-Ni(OH)2 by adjusting the hydrothermal reaction time. The interlayer spacing of α-Ni(OH)2 is wider than that of β-Ni(OH)2 due to the filling of structural water between the nickel hydroxide layers, exhibiting superior catalytic performance with the potential of 1.50 V at 3 mA cmECSA−2 (Fig. 6a–c).86 The increase in electron transfer rate and propensity to form Ni3+ species of α-Ni(OH)2 have been identified as the key factors for exceptional UOR activity. In addition, α-Ni(OH)2 also exhibits enhanced stability, as evidenced by the inconspicuous potential change after 20000 s of continuous operation. Similarly, V-doped α-Ni(OH)2 was fabricated via the one-step coprecipitation method. Ni3+ active sites were easier to generate at low potential owing to the V introduction resulting in the crystal phase transition of Ni(OH)2.29 In another example, NiMoO4, a representative catalyst of the UOR, comprises three distinct crystal phases, namely NiMoO4·xH2O, α-NiMoO4, and β-NiMoO4 (Fig. 6d). Among these catalysts, mesoporous-structure β-NiMoO4 shows a large specific surface area (58 m2 g−1), exhibiting a large electrochemical surface area and minimal charge transfer resistance (Fig. 6e and f). The outstanding UOR performance of β-NiMoO4 can be attributed to more accessible catalytic sites for the catalytic reaction.18

(i) LSV curves of bare Ti-mesh, RuO2, CCH NN/Ti, and P-CoSx(OH)yNN/Ti in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M urea.88 
However, some Ni3+ active sites may be obscured by the regular periodic arrangement of the crystal structure for UOR catalysts, which is difficult to exploit during catalytic processes. One of the solutions is to increase the amorphous component of nanocatalysts. Xie and colleagues have demonstrated a method to modulate the crystallinity of Ni–Fe layered double hydroxide nanosheets (pa-NiFe LDH NS/NIF) by controlling the synthesis temperature. The formation of amorphous components resulted in abundant reactive sites and interfaces, as well as the generation of Ni3+, thus exhibiting excellent UOR performance.8 In another study, amorphous Ni(OH)S nanosheets were synthesized via an ordinary complexation–hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 6g and h). Advanced catalytic activity for the UOR was achieved since there are a large number of defects and unsaturated bonds in the amorphous structure of Ni(OH)S, which is easier to oxidize to NiOOH (Ni3+) during the reaction.87 However, the introduction of an amorphous structure will reduce the inherent conductivity and weaken the stability. To balance the number of active sites and conductivity, Jiang et al. used a high-conductivity mesh as the substrate. As a result, porous and amorphous CoSx(OH)y core–shell nanoneedles on Ti-mesh (P-CoSx(OH)yNN/Ti) exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.3 V (Fig. 6i).88
To sum up, precise control of the crystal structure can promote the formation of high-valency sites and increase the number of active sites of electrocatalysts during the UOR. Concerning crystalline/amorphous engineering, the inclusion of amorphous components can enhance the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts, yet their stabilities would also be influenced. Thus, prioritizing the search for a compromise between stability and catalytic activity is of utmost importance.
3.2. Geometric engineering
Inspired by the catalytic activity along with the number of active sites for nanocatalysts, a usual strategy for enhancing the UOR performance is to maximize the specific surface area and decrease the size via geometric engineering, such as nanosheets,24,99,125 mesoporous structures,25 small-size nanoparticles,126 single atoms,37,110,127 and so on. Recently, Liu et al. showed that Ni2P nanosheets with a thickness of 130 nm exhibited a low onset potential of 1.33 V owing to the increased number of exposed catalytically active sites and accelerated ion diffusion of electrolyte.99 Besides, the V–Ni3N nanosheet arrays vertically aligned on 3D self-supported nickel foam were constructed by Li et al. using hydrothermal and nitriding methods (Fig. 7a).24 The mass and electron transfer rate with the three-dimensional conductive nickel foam carrier is strengthened by the vertically oriented Ni3N nanosheets, which expose more active sites than the randomly stacked nanosheets. Therefore, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 can be achieved with a potential of only 1.361 V. Another method of exposing active sites was reported by Li et al., in which the edges of Ni(OH)2–Ar nanosheets were jagged by the Ar plasma etching (Fig. 7b).125 The more accessible interlayer channels and unsaturated coordination atoms can obviously improve the UOR performance of Ni(OH)2, showing a potential of 0.343 V (vs. Hg/HgO) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2.

(h) LSV curves of Rh/NiV-LDH, NiV-LDH, Ni(OH)2, RuO2 and bare NF in 1 M KOH and 0.33 M urea.127 Copyright (2022), with permission from Elsevier. 
Depending on the arrangement, the nanosheets can also be further constructed as nanosphere structures. In the Fe-doped NiS–NiS2 heterojunction system, the microspheres consist of mesoporous nanosheets with large specific surface areas as well as high porosity (Fig. 7c), which both expose more accessible active sites and create the mass transfer pathway, leading to a clear increase in UOR activity with a low potential of 1.36 V at 50 mA cm−2.95 Meanwhile, nanorods, nanotubes, nanoprisms, and nanoflowers are also developed in morphological engineering.7,26,91,128 For instance, NiCo2S4/C prepared via a straightforward one-pot process shows a hollow cage structure with a diameter of around 500 nm (Fig. 7d). This hollow structure provides a channel for ion diffusion, facilitating the transport of electrolytes. As a consequence, the NiCo2S4/C composite exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the UOR.25
Downsizing the nanomaterials to clusters and single atoms can maximize the atom utilization of metal components, and tune the coordination/electronic environment, offering high reactivity and selectivity. In this regard, Kumar et al. introduced Rh single atoms with high loading onto the surface of S–Co3O4 by a liquid N2-quenching method (Fig. 7e and f). As expected, RhSA-S-Co3O4 showed excellent catalytic activity under all pH conditions. Similarly, the Rh single atom catalyst (SAC) supported on NiV LDH carriers exhibits high specific surface area and controllable chemical properties, which strengthens atomic utilization and promotes the desorption of intermediates through synergistic effects. According to DFT calculations, Rh SACs act as active sites for adsorbing and activating urea molecules.110 Furthermore, it has been observed that the Gibbs free energy change for the decomposition of urea molecules into CO* and NH* intermediates at the Rh/NiV LDH surface is significantly lower, at only 3.05 eV, compared to that of the NiV LDH surface (6.86 eV) (Fig. 7g). This indicates that Rh/NiV LDH demonstrates outstanding UOR activity, achieving a potential of 1.33 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7h).127 Jiang et al. reported a UOR catalyst composed of Ni atoms anchored on N-doped carbon nanosheets.129 Due to the uniform distribution and high exposure amounts of Ni–N4 sites, the necessary potential for the UOR is decreased by 280 mV in comparison to that of the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The reported atomic-level dispersed UOR catalysts open up a new application field for SACs and provide a new direction for the development of electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy conversion efficiency.
3.3. Heteroatom doping
Heteroatom doping has been identified as an effective strategy to modulate the adsorption/desorption energy of reactants (CO(NH2)2, H2O), intermediates (e.g., *COOH, *CO2) and products (CO2, N2, H2O) via tuning the chemical environment and electronic structure of the active sites. A series of highly efficient UOR catalysts has been exploited by adopting this strategy. The atomic doping of nanomaterials can be carried out by a series of strategies, such as the hydrothermal method, ion exchange, and co-precipitation method.94,111,130–132 Among them, the hydrothermal approach is a typical technique for encouraging the self-growth of the catalyst on a substrate (NF or carbon cloth). The autoclave is first filled with the required chemicals and solvents, then the reaction is completed by applying pressure and temperature over a long period of time.24 The amount of dopant can be precisely regulated using the ion exchange methods by adjusting the stoichiometry of the dopant. For instance, Kuang et al. synthesized CoV–Fe with various levels of doping by ion exchange between CoV-HS and FeCl3 at 80 °C.131 The co-precipitation is easy to operate and uniform product composition can be obtained under mild experimental conditions. In addition, some advanced techniques including chemical etching, ball milling, microwave technology and electrospinning have also been adopted to incorporate the dopants into host nanocatalysts, to generate uniform and stable active sites for urea oxidation catalysis.133–136
Generally, heteroatom doping can be divided into cation doping and anion doping according to the dopant types. In regard to cation doping, V is an abundant element on Earth and possesses a unique electronic structure, along with a range of valence states, making it an ideal dopant candidate. Li et al. investigated the effect of V doping on the electrocatalytic performance of Ni3N for the UOR. It was found that the inherent conductivity of Ni3N was enhanced by doping V, and electron transfer was facilitated in the reaction process. Besides, the surface of V–Ni3N/NF was partially oxidized to NiOOH after a long-term urea oxidation test, confirmed by XRD analysis (Fig. 8a), leading to the water molecule adsorption and dissociation energy on the formed hydroxides being modulated. Thus, V–Ni3N/NF exhibits an excellent UOR electrocatalytic performance with a potential of 1.361 V at 10 mA cm−2.24 More importantly, the incorporation of V has been found to be a promising approach for regulating the adsorption of intermediates by enhancing the oxidation state of nickel-based catalysts. In another study, the electronic structure around the Ni active sites in a V,Co co-doped NiS2 catalyst was altered by the transfer of electrons from Ni and Co into doped V. According to the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p orbitals (Fig. 8b), the peaks of Ni2+ and Ni3+ in NCS-6, NVS-1 and NCVS-3 move to high binding energy compared with those in NS, indicating that the doping of V element can clearly increase the oxidation state of Ni. The DFT calculation further confirmed that the free energy of urea molecules and reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface was reduced (Fig. 8c), thus the UOR performance was raised for V,Co co-doped NiS2.94 In addition to the V doping, other transition metal elements, such as tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), and cerium (Ce), can also yield a similar enhancement.27,93,137 The Ni–WOx benefited from the introduction of W, resulting in the transfer of electrons from Ni to W.93 When the UOR occurs on the surface of the Ni–WOx catalyst, carbonyl (CO) will be adsorbed in the negative charge region, while amino (–NH2) will be easily adsorbed in the positive charge region, promoting the decomposition of urea molecules (Fig. 8d), thereby improving the activity of the UOR (100 mA cm−2 at 1.40 V) (Fig. 8e). In addition, Zheng et al. conducted a study to investigate the impact of Mo doping on the electronic structure of CoCO3 and its impact on the UOR activity. They demonstrated that Mo doping induces the formation of active Co3+ sites and enhances the adsorption of urea, leading to a significant increase in UOR activity.137 The CO2 adsorption and desorption behavior on catalysts has also been verified to affect the UOR performance. For example, the DFT calculations showed that the moderate adsorption energy of CO2 on Ce–Ni3N@CC (−0.31 eV) was beneficial for the improvement of catalytic activity, compared to that on Ni3N, Ce–Ni3N, and N–Ni3N slabs (−0.1 eV, −0.88 eV, and −0.11 eV) (Fig. 8f).27

Anion doping (e.g., N, S and F) is another widely available strategy to regulate the electronic states of metal elements in catalysts due to the electronegativity difference between anions and metal ions.17,21,138 Based on this, Zhang et al. synthesized a Ni@NCNT catalyst by combining Ni particles with N-doped CNT, in which N doping weakens the binding strength between CO2 and Ni3+ species, thus accelerating the desorption of CO2 and slowing down the CO2 poisoning.138 As a result, the Ni@NCNT exhibited a high current density of 45.8 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V, which is 3.8 times that of commercial Pt/C. In the case of S-doped NiMoO4, a new occupied state appeared around the Fermi level (EF), which was mainly contributed by the Ni 3d spin state, as illustrated by the total electronic density of states (TDOSs) (Fig. 8g). As shown in Fig. 8h, the altered electronic band structure of NiMoO4 after S doping optimized the adsorption energy of urea, thus improving the UOR catalytic activity.21 Furthermore, F ions have strong electronegativity which can change the electronic structure of metals. Under alkaline conditions, the metal–F ionic bond is easily broken, which is conducive to the production of metal oxy(hydroxide). Thus, Wang et al. prepared fluorine-modified NiFe LDH (NiFe–F) by HF etching. The formation of the Ni–F ionic bond facilitates electron transfer from Ni to F and promotes the formation of NiOOH. Thus, the current density reaches 50 mA cm−2 at a low potential of 1.44 V (Fig. 8i).17
3.4. Surface defect engineering
The defects in the surface of nanocatalysts have been demonstrated to have an obvious impact on physicochemical properties by altering the periodicity and symmetry of the crystal structure.139 The regulation of surface chemical/physical properties can contribute to optimizing the binding energy of the reactant, urea molecules. To this end, various methods have been proposed for constructing surface defects. For example, the catalyst can be exposed to a strong electromagnetic field filled with reactive gas to create rich defects on the surface by plasma treatment. Zhu et al. used H2 or Ar plasma to prepare PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (PBSCF) with oxygen vacancies.140 The gas source, ion beam power, incident angle, and treatment duration can be adjusted to modulate the type and concentration of defects according to the formation energy of specific defects. Thiruraman et al. used a 30 kV concentrated ion beam to irradiate a monolayer transition metal dihalide (TMD), which led to single-atom defects in MoS2 and WS2.141 The previous procedures have extremely high requirements for experimental hardware, but the annealing process is more straightforward. The OV–CoO–Ar was obtained with oxygen vacancies by annealing in an Ar atmosphere for 1 h.142 In addition, ball-milling, chemical etching, sol–gel method, and chemical vapor deposition are used to efficiently construct surface defects in order to tune the intrinsic properties of materials for super catalytic performance.139,143
Oxygen defects commonly exist within metal oxides due to the low formation energy, which has attracted considerable research attention. Creating oxygen defects can contribute to reducing the electron transport resistance, and promoting electron/mass transfer, thus improving the electrocatalytic reaction kinetics.90 For example, the Co3O4 nanowires with oxygen defects displayed a lower electron transport resistance of 0.0615 Ω than that of the initial Co3O4 (0.3338 Ω), which plays a dominant role in enhancing catalytic performance for the UOR.14 Additionally, effective active sites can be increased by introducing oxygen vacancies in metal oxides. Meanwhile, the adsorption energy of vital reaction intermediates on the nanocatalyst surface is modified by changing the electronic structures and coordinated environment of the active centre. For example, the Ovac-NiMoO4 displayed a Fermi surface closer to the conduction band bottom than pure NiMoO4, which is consistent with its higher electron concentration and is advantageous for electron transfer (Fig. 9a and b).19 As shown in Fig. 9c, the adsorption energy of urea molecules on oxygen-vacancy-rich NiMoO4 is significantly lower than that of pure NiMoO4, thereby improving the UOR catalytic kinetic process. A deep understanding of the oxygen vacancy participation in the UOR process was demonstrated by Liu et al.15The reaction and electron transfer pathways of CoMoO4 with oxygen vacancies are presented in Fig. 9d and e. The oxygen vacancies in CoMoO4 are verified as active sites to interact with the N atom in the urea molecule. The electrons are then transferred from the N atom to Mo near the oxygen vacancy, leading to bond cleavage of the N–H and C–N, and eventually N2 desorption. Moreover, Alex et al. reported that the catalytic activity of NiO could be clearly raised by introducing oxygen vacancies. The obtained e-NiO sample by electron beam bombardment exhibited excellent catalytic activity due to the increased number of Ni3+ and effective adsorption of urea molecules.144 However, the difficulty in CO2 desorption presented a challenge in the reaction process. To address this issue, the authors increased the KOH concentration to facilitate CO2 removal and prevent the surface poisoning of e-NiO (Fig. 9f and g). Recently, Jiao et al. synthesized V-doped Ni(OH)2 with abundant oxygen defects using a hydrothermal technique.104 As shown in Fig. 9h and i, the electrons in the d orbital of the metal were redistributed by introducing oxygen defects, which results in the rate-limiting step of urea oxidation shifting from deprotonation to the N–H bond cleavage step. As a result, the UOR activity of Ni(OH)2 was enhanced.

3.5. Heterostructure construction
The urea molecule possesses a unique structure, consisting of two amino groups (–NH2) with electron-withdrawing properties and a carbonyl group (CO) with electron-donating properties. Thus, some nanomaterials with Janus charge distribution have been designed for effectively adsorbing and decomposing the urea, resulting in an improved UOR performance.42 For instance, Jiao and colleagues synthesized Ni3N/Mo2N heterojunction nanoarrays through hydrothermal and simple nitridation methods. Their computational analysis revealed contrasting adsorption tendencies between Ni3N and Mo2N towards the CO and –NH2 of urea molecules, as depicted in Fig. 10a and b. Specifically, Ni3N exhibited a higher affinity for amine groups, while Mo2N displayed a stronger interaction with carbonyl groups. Consequently, the Ni3N/Mo2N demonstrated a robust adsorption capacity for urea (Fig. 10c).102 Heterostructure construction is a desirable approach to form locally stable nucleophilic/electrophilic regions to meet the needs of Janus charge distribution regulation. A typical example is the CoS2–MoS2 Schottky heterojunction system, in which electrons are spontaneously transferred from metal-type CoS2 to semiconductor-type MoS2, thereby altering the local charge distribution.145 This results in the formation of an electrophilic region on the surface of CoS2 and a nucleophilic region on the surface of MoS2 (Fig. 10d and e). Specifically, electrophilic CoS2 attracts electron-donating carbonyl, and nucleophilic MoS2 attracts electron-donating amino, which promotes the adsorption of urea and the fracture of the C–N bond. At the same time, CO2 desorption is considered to be the rate-determining step of urea oxidation. In contrast to the primitive CoS2 and MoS2 catalysts, the CoS2–MoS2 Schottky heterojunction exhibits a higher rate of CO2 desorption, which improves the kinetics of urea oxidation and achieves an obviously enhanced UOR performance. At a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the potential is only 0.06 V higher than the thermodynamic potential for water decomposition (Fig. 10f). Nickel sulfide is considered to be one of the most promising catalysts for urea oxidation due to its high conductivity and intrinsic activity. Zhuo et al. prepared a Ni3S2/Ni heterojunction by a hydrothermal method followed by annealing.98 Ni3S2/Ni heterojunction-induced charge redistribution can optimize the adsorption energy of urea while simultaneously modifying the adsorption energy of OH− to encourage the synthesis of the active component NiOOH, which is favorable for urea decomposition. In another study, Zhao et al. synthesized a Ni3S2–NiS/NF heterojunction composed of nickel sulfide with different phase structures. The high conductivity of Ni3S2 and abundant active sites of NiS work in concert to enhance the UOR performance.146

In addition to metal sulfides, transition metal oxides (TMOs) have also been used to construct heterostructures. For instance, Wang et al. discovered that a CoMn alloy can effectively raise the poor conductivity of CoMn2O4 and boost the catalytic activity (Fig. 10g).118 It only needs a potential of 1.36 V to drive a current density of 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10h). Subsequently, the Ni–V2O3 Schottky heterojunction composed of monometallic Ni and semiconducting V2O3 reported by Zhang et al. can realize efficient and stable urea oxidation. According to DFT calculations, the electron transfer is related to the work function of the material. From Fig. 10i and j, it is obvious that the work function of V2O3 (4.28 eV) is lower than that of Ni (2.92 eV). The barrier formed between the two just meets the potential of electrons flowing from metal Ni to V2O3, forming a relatively stable nucleophilic region (V2O3) and electrophilic region (Ni). Therefore, the amino is easily adsorbed on the metal Ni components, carbonyl is easily adsorbed on the V2O3, and the interaction between Ni and V2O3 promotes the fracture of C–N. As a result, the Ni–V2O3 heterojunction exhibited enhanced catalytic activity, and a potential of merely 1.40 V was needed to reach 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10k).75 Moreover, Pan et al. also found that the single metal nickel-modified Co2VO4 (Ni–Co2VO4/NF) heterojunction can accelerate the kinetics of UOR retardation, especially at high current. When the current density reaches 1000 mA cm−2, a potential of only 1.45 V is required.106 The above studies primarily focus on the electronic interaction of heterostructures, and the impact of surface hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity on catalytic performance has been overlooked. Wang et al. reported NiF3/Ni2P@CC spontaneously grown on carbon cloth via a hydrothermal method followed by phosphorylation. The resulting super hydrophilic surface of the catalyst facilitated electrolyte diffusion to the electrode surface, which in turn reduced contact resistance and enhanced the overall catalytic activity.96
4. Potential applications of the UOR in energy devices
The exploration of the electrochemical UOR for practical-scale use has recently made promising advances, including in UE, photoelectrochemical urea splitting, ZABs, and DUFCs (Fig. 11).10,37 In particular, the UOR substitutes for the OER in UE and photoelectrochemical urea splitting systems, which improves hydrogen production efficiency and generates more hydrogen energy. The key distinction between these two systems is that the former requires the direct application of electrical energy, while the latter requires electrons and holes to be generated by a light source-irradiated semiconductor.147 In other applications, ZABs and DUFCs are both batteries that convert chemical energy into electrical energy. For ZABs, the role of the UOR is also to take the place of the OER, which shortens the voltage gap during battery charging and discharging, thereby enhancing the reversibility of the battery.38 Owing to urea being more convenient to store and transport, the use of the UOR instead of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in DUFCs can save hydrogen energy and provide electrical energy.148 UE has been introduced in the second section, so several other energy conversion devices are discussed in this section.
 Fig. 11  An illustration of potential applications of the UOR, including in UE, photoelectrochemical urea splitting, DUFCs and ZABs. 
4.1. Photoelectrochemical urea splitting
In contrast to the electrolytic urea process that relies on a direct external power supply, photoelectrochemical urea splitting generates the required electrons and holes through light irradiation of semiconductor materials, which then participate in the HER and UOR occurring within the device, respectively.35 Thus, the semiconductor materials were combined with UOR electrocatalysts to respond to light, improving the efficiency of photoelectrochemical urea splitting for hydrogen production. Metal oxides such as TiO2, BiVO4, and Fe2O3 are employed in photoelectrochemical urea splitting due to their adequate band gap and effective light absorption.149 For example, Wang et al. prepared TiO2 and α-Fe2O3 modified with Ni(OH)2 for efficient photoelectrochemical urea splitting.147 The band edge position of TiO2 coincides with the potentials of urea oxidation and water reduction, allowing for low or zero-bias hydrogen production. As shown in Fig. 12a, Ni(OH)2 is oxidized to NiOOH by holes produced in TiO2, which participates in the catalytic oxidation of urea, generating N2 and CO2. Meanwhile, water is reduced to produce hydrogen by the electrons from TiO2. Meanwhile, TiO2 has a large band gap energy, which limits the conversion efficiency of solar energy. Therefore, α-Fe2O3 with a suitable band gap energy of 2.1–2.2 eV is used as the anode material for the adsorption of visible light. The onset potential of α-Fe2O3 under light conditions shifts more than 800 mV negatively compared to the dark environment. Regrettably, the photoelectrochemical performance of α-Fe2O3 is suboptimal due to its limited conductivity. After that, Xu et al. developed Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 to improve the electron mobility and the carrier density of α-Fe2O3. By electrodepositing Ni(OH)2 on Ti–Fe2O3, the current density at 1.3 V was 4 times that of pure Ti–Fe2O3 under illumination for 300 s (Fig. 12b and c).150 Moreover, Ni(OH)2 played a role in reducing the oxidation potential of urea and storing the holes generated by Ti–Fe2O3. Then, Zhao et al. modified TiO2–Ni(OH)2 by the photosensitivity of CdS (CdS–Ni).151 The hole transfer rate from CdS to Ni(OH)2 is 7.3 ± 0.3 × 1011 s−1, which is beneficial for the oxidation of Ni(OH)2. Nevertheless, the CdS–Ni electrode becomes unstable due to the recombination of electrons and holes in the CdS layer. The authors reduce the recombination and avoid the influence of photocorrosion reaction by coating a ZnS passivation layer on the electrode surface. Additionally, the photoelectrochemical urea splitting is constrained by the energy loss induced by the interface barrier between these semiconductor materials and electrocatalysts, and the low utilization of sunlight. To solve these problems, Tao et al. reported a bifunctional material, La4Ni3O10, which showed a low potential at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and was excitable by near-infrared light (800 nm < λ < 1200 nm) (Fig. 12d and e).149

In conclusion, the photoanode material utilized in photoelectrochemical urea splitting can be a composite of two different materials or a material with dual functionality. The utilization of a semiconductor/cocatalyst structure enhances the separation of photogenerated carriers, but it fails to prevent energy loss at the semiconductor/catalyst interface. Conversely, utilizing a single material with dual functionality can eliminate interfacial energy loss, but the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency is compromised. The direct use of sunlight in the photoelectrochemical urea splitting method results in minimal energy loss. However, its efficiency in hydrogen production is lower than that of electrocatalysis, making it necessary to develop new catalysts that can achieve high-performance photoelectrochemical urea splitting.
4.2. Zn–air batteries
ZABs are widely regarded as a highly promising energy storage solution with high theoretical energy density.152,153 Most of the current research in this area is focused on developing efficient electrocatalysts for the OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to overcome their sluggish kinetics and improve the performance of ZABs.154 However, charging the battery requires a high potential, leading to inefficient energy conversion and poor reversibility. To address this issue, researchers have explored the UOR, which has a low theoretical potential of −0.46 V (vs. SHE), in the charging process of ZABs. Through its ability to decrease the voltage gap in the charging process, the UOR offers a promising avenue for improving the overall utilization efficiency of the battery (Fig. 13a). In an alkaline environment, the relevant reaction equations are as follows:37

Upon ZAB discharge, the OH− in the electrolyte migrates to the Zn electrode and participates in the oxidation reaction of Zn to produce soluble Zn(OH)42− and 2 electrons. When Zn(OH)42− in the solution becomes completely saturated, it is converted into the insoluble ZnO. Electrons from the external circuit are transferred to the air electrode and take part in the ORR to give OH−. Urea molecules undergo oxidation reactions under the influence of OH− during the charging process of ZABs, yielding CO2, N2, and 6 electrons, then electrons flow into the cathode through the wire to participate in the reduction reaction of the Zn electrode. Zhang et al. demonstrate the superiority of a urea-assisted ZAB using the ORR/UOR bifunctional electrocatalyst. In the presence of urea during charging, Mn-incorporated Ni(OH)2/carbon fiber cloth (Mn–Ni(OH)2/CFC) manufactured using a straightforward room temperature process saves 12–21% of energy (Fig. 13b).39 Wang's group also developed Co/CoSe2@CNx with a low voltage gap for charge–discharge and exceptional stability (Fig. 13c and d), thus enabling minimal voltage attenuation even after 140 hours of continuous usage.38 Recently, Jiang et al. found that the atomically dispersed catalyst of Ni SAs-NC with maximized atom utilization showed remarkable catalytic activity and stability under alkaline conditions. Moreover, urea-assisted ZABs offered an energy conversion efficiency of 71.8% (Fig. 13e), which is superior to that of conventional ZABs that rely on the OER/ORR (61.3%).37
Conclusively, the utilization of the UOR in ZABs presents a viable strategy to attain efficient energy conversion and enhance the reliability of the system. However, the application of this approach in ZABs is limited by various factors, including competing reactions (e.g., OER) at an elevated voltage, the low performance of the electrocatalysts, and their stability. Hence, it is imperative to further investigate the implementation of the UOR in zinc–air batteries to unlock its full potential. In addition to ZABs, other metal–air batteries utilizing iron, aluminum, and magnesium are promising candidates to broaden the scope of UOR technology in the field of energy conversion and storage.155,156 These metals are relatively inactive like Zn. At the same time, the related catalysts can also be utilized due to the alkaline aqueous solution as electrolyte in these metal–air batteries.
4.3. Direct urea fuel cells
Compared with anodic fuels (e.g., hydrogen) in conventional fuel cells, urea is widely distributed in nature and safer in storage and transportation. It is safe and effective for constructing DUFCs, which convert the chemical energy of urea and O2 molecules into electrical energy.148,157 During the DUFC operation, urea oxidation occurs at the anode, releasing electrons that are transferred to the cathode via an external circuit, where they participate in the reduction of O2 to form OH−. The OH− then migrates to the anode, reacting with urea to complete the circuit. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of DUFCs is 1.146 V, close to that of the hydrogen fuel cell (1.23 V), which further proves that urea can be used as anode fuel instead of hydrogen. The electrolyte is a crucial component of the DUFC system, and adjusting the electrolyte concentration can affect whether the system works overall. Lan et al. developed DUFCs prior to working with urine or urea solutions in 2010.157 They made three urea fuel cells based on different catalysts, called cells A, B and C (Table 3), in various concentrations of urea solution. It was discovered that 1 M urea solution has a notably higher energy density than 3 M urea solution (Fig. 14a–c). The authors speculated that the relatively large urea molecules at high concentrations hinder anodic diffusion, thereby impeding anodic UOR. In addition, cell A exhibited the highest power density among the three different cells, which indicates that the noble metal Pt/C catalyst is a better catalyst for urea fuel cells. Therefore, the optimization of catalysts made from non-precious metals is necessary when employing waste liquids containing urea as electrolytes for cells.

Some research on DUFCs with non-precious metal catalysts has also been reported, including nano-sized nickel, NiSn nanoparticles, Ni(OH)2, NiWO4, NiCo2O4, and Co dendrites.40,41,158–160 Recently, Ao et al. obtained a hierarchical heterojunction structure by controlling the vulcanization time of MOF, i.e., NiCo-BDC (a complex obtained by combining benzodicarboxylic acid and nickel and cobalt ions).161 The heterojunction structure is generated containing a CoNi2S4 component with high conductivity and the MOF material with a unique porous structure, which is conducive to the transmission of electrons (Fig. 14d). The theoretical calculation reflected that the electron redistribution takes place locally in the MOF sulfide, showing that electrons move from Ni and Co to the surrounding S. As shown in Fig. 14e, the adsorption energy of urea in MOF-CoNi2S4 is around −0.43 eV, which is sufficient for the adsorption of urea molecules. The lowest CO2 adsorption energy is also found in MOF-CoNi2S4, which promotes CO2 desorption and reduces toxicity. As expected, the DUFC based on MOF-CoNi2S4 exhibited a maximum power density of 2.68 mW cm−2 at a current density of 8.42 mA cm−2 and superior stability (Fig. 14f).
In a nutshell, DUFCs present distinctive benefits over conventional fuel cells, including cost-effectiveness, safety, green energy saving, and wastewater treatment. Nonetheless, the use of viscous urea electrolyte with high concentration can pose challenges to mass transfer, resulting in elevated fuel cell resistance and reduced output performance. Additionally, designing superior catalysts is urgent to enhance the conversion efficiency of DUFCs. Hence, a comprehensive approach focusing on both electrolyte and electrocatalyst advancements is imperative for the progress of DUFCs and UOR technologies.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
The development of the UOR to reduce energy consumption, produce green hydrogen, and deal with waste water is a challenging and promising alternative to meet the global energy demand. In this review, we have summarized the recent advances in typical design strategies of high-performance electrocatalysts according to the reactant properties of urea and multi-electron reaction processes of the UOR. This review also covered the applications of the UOR in urea splitting, photoelectrochemical urea splitting and batteries (DUFCs and ZABs), which can significantly improve the energy conversion efficiency. Although great progress and achievements have been made in creating more active sites, improving electronic conductivity and enhancing the inherent activity of each active center for improving the UOR performance, theoretical and technical bottlenecks still exist for the practical application of the UOR (Fig. 15):
 Fig. 15  A schematic diagram of the challenges and perspectives for the UOR. 
(1) The adsorption of urea molecules to the surface of catalysts can occur in various ways due to its special amino and carbonyl groups. Broadening the heterostructure construction strategies to tune the adsorption energy of urea and various intermediates can mitigate the reaction energy barriers, delivering high catalytic activity for the UOR. Moreover, precise manipulation of the surface composition of catalysts is required to improve atom utilization efficiency and provide well-defined active sites for the UOR.
(2) Though some studies have given several reasonable hypotheses of UOR mechanisms to explain the results of the observed experiments, a deep understanding of the relationship between the catalyst structures and UOR catalytic activity is still lacking. Thus, advanced in situ characterization technologies (e.g., in situ Raman, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry) should be adopted for the precision analysis of the real active sites and related reaction intermediates, revealing the relatively accurate reaction mechanism of urea oxidation. Combined with DFT calculations, it is more convenient to guide the synthesis of universal and efficient UOR catalysts.
(3) The stability of UOR catalysts and corresponding electrochemical devices is worthy of prominent attention. Performance degradation and chemical compositional change often happen during the UOR process, especially in severe conditions or at high current density. For instance, some studies verified that Ni2+ species were converted to Ni3+ species during urea oxidation, confirmed by in situ Raman.82 The identification of the actual active sites is important for the construction of stable electrocatalysts, which can be constantly operated for industrial urea oxidation.
(4) Due to the proximity of the reaction potential window of the UOR and OER, fierce competition between the two is likely to occur (a clear “oxidation peak” may be seen in the polarization curve), which influences the catalytic selectivity.162 As a result, it is critical to identify the precise reasons for the UOR/OER competitive reaction and propose workable solutions. Additionally, the oxidation of urea to NOx− is more favorable than the formation of N2 for some catalysts, such as Ni(OH)2. Therefore, inhibiting the occurrence of side reactions and raising the faradaic efficiency of N2 will be an essential research direction in the future.
(5) The three-electrode system with explicit mixtures of KOH and urea as electrolytes is typically employed in the laboratory. In comparison, choosing wastewater and urine containing urea as electrolytes is more valuable for the industrial application of the UOR, however, there exist some challenges. (1) The impurities in wastewater and urine (e.g., creatinine, uric acid, and phosphorus) might hamper the active sites or destroy the structure of the catalysts, leading to a decrease of reaction kinetics for the UOR. (2) The service life of devices can be shortened due to the corrosive nature of impurities. For example, the Nafion membrane in the urea-based device is susceptible to damage and blockage. (3) In the reaction process, the urea concentration decreases gradually, so urea needs to be added in time, which raises the system cost. To address these challenges, the development of novel electrolytic devices, diaphragms, and urea pumps to resist corrosion and contamination is crucial to achieving commercial viability.
