    , Accepted 27th September 2018First published on 27th September 2018AbstractA series of scarce fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols were synthesized by the facile one-step reaction of [60] fullerene with inexpensive and readily accessible amines and 2,2-disubstituted acetaldehydes without the addition of valuable metal salts in moderate yields, comparable to those for most monoadducts reported previously. This strategy exhibits a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. A plausible reaction pathway for the formation of fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols is proposed to elucidate the above reaction process.
Introduction
Functionalization of fullerenes by chemical modification to afford organofullerenes has attracted wide attention over the past few decades due to the extensive applications1 of organofullerenes in many fields including materials science, biological applications, and nanotechnology, exhibiting remarkable advantages over traditional non-fullerene techniques2 in many cases. The majority of chemical modifications of fullerenes include cycloadditions, nucleophilic additions, radical additions, asymmetric catalysis, etc.1,3 Asymmetric catalysis in the fullerene field is generally realized by using asymmetric metal catalysts and/or organocatalysts.3g,i–k Although many synthetic strategies have been developed to prepare organofullerenes, they have their own limitations. For example, the known protocols still have great drawbacks in the synthesis of fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols. To the best of our knowledge, organic molecules bearing a pyrrolidin-2-ol motif are very rare.4 In the case of fullerenes, only one example with a pyrrolidin-2-ol moiety has been recently reported by our group via the chlorohydroxylation reaction of fulleropyrroline with Pd(OAc)2 and CuCl2·2H2O.5 However, the chlorohydroxylation method still has great synthetic limitations. For instance, a two-step reaction starting from [60]fullerene (C60) together with the use of relatively expensive Pd(OAc)2 and CuCl2·2H2O was required. Moreover, only the chlorohydroxylation product was obtained due to the very limited scope of substrates. On the other hand, organofullerenes with OH groups have shown a variety of biological functions as a neuroprotective agent,6a an antiproliferative agent,6b a free-radical scavenger,6c and a glutamate receptor antagonist.6d Furthermore, the OH group of pyrrolidin-2-ol is a valuable precursor and could be further transformed to other moieties.7 Accordingly, the further exploration and development of new synthetic methods to produce novel organofullerenes, especially for the rare fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols, in a straightforward and practical way with a broad substrate scope, are still in demand.
The newly developed approach for functionalizing fullerenes by using cheap and easily available aldehydes and amines is a potential option and has received increasing attention owing to the preparation of a large number of novel organofullerenes with structural and functional diversities by adopting this strategy.5,8–11 For example, a large variety of fascinating fullerene derivatives, including fulleropyrrolidines,8 fulleropyrrolines,5,9 tetrahydropyridinofullerenes,10 and cyclopentafullerenes,11 have been successfully synthesized by reacting with aldehydes and amines, of which have been applied to obtain the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) reported so far for P3HT:PCBM solar cells on plastic substrates.12 Hence, the functionalization of fullerenes by employing aldehydes and amines is a reliable and promising method. In continuation of our interest in fullerene chemistry,5,8a,b,d,e,g,h,9–11,13 herein we reported the facile synthesis of scarce fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols by a simple and efficient one-step reaction of C60 with amines and 2,2-disubstituted acetaldehydes without the use of expensive metal salts.
Results and discussion
We initiated our studies by evaluating the reaction of C60, benzylamine (1a), and isobutyraldehyde (2a) in chlorobenzene at a molar ratio of 1:5:5 (entry 1, Table 1). To our delight, the desired fulleropyrrolidin-2-ol 3aa was obtained as the single product in 8% yield at 130 °C for 1 h in air (entry 1, Table 1). The yield of product 3aa could be increased to 29% by increasing the amounts of both 1a and 2a from 5 to 10 equiv. (entry 2, Table 1). A further increment of 1a and 2a to 20 equiv. exhibited no further improvement for 3aa (entry 3, Table 1). Adjusting the amount of 1a or 2a (from 5 to 20 equiv.) alone has also proved to be fruitless in increasing the yield of 3aa (entries 4–7, Table 1). With the best molar ratio of C60/1a/2a (1:10:10), the reaction temperature (entries 8 and 9, Table 1) and atmosphere (entry 10, Table 1) were investigated. When the reaction temperature was increased to 150 °C or reduced to 100 °C, a compromised yield was obtained (entries 8 and 9, Table 1). Moreover, if protected by a nitrogen atmosphere, this reaction produced only a trace amount of 3aa (entry 10, Table 1), indicating the importance of air to this reaction. The promotion effect of either a base (4-dimethylaminopyridine, DMAP) or an acid (acetic acid) was also examined (entries 11 and 12, Table 1) due to the previous confirmation that the presence of a base or an acid has a positive effect on fullerene reactions based on amines and aldehydes in some cases.3h Unfortunately, the addition of DMAP and acetic acid to our reaction system was found to be detrimental to obtaining a higher product yield (entries 11 and 12, Table 1). The potential reaction effect of metal salts including Mn(III), Pb(IV), Cu(II), Fe(III), Mg(II) and Ce(IV) was also studied, and no further improvement was detected (entries 13–18, Table 1) probably due to the easy oxidation of isobutyraldehyde (2a) with the assistance of metal oxidants. In addition, the addition of typical radical scavenger 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) led to the dramatically decreased yield of product 3aa (entry 19 vs. 2, Table 1), indicating that a radical pathway was involved in the present reaction. Hence, the molar ratio of C60/1a/2a as 1:10:10 and the reaction temperature as 130 °C together with the atmospheric conditions were selected as the optimized reaction conditions for further reaction scope examinations (entry 2, Table 1). It should be noted that some unknown fullerene derivatives with very high polarity were also observed besides the expected product 3aa during the reaction condition optimization process. However, the separation and purification of unknown fullerene products are very difficult and thus the characterization of their identities failed.

The reaction scope examination results are shown in Table 2. It can be seen from Table 2 that typical arylmethanamines including benzylamines (1a–f) with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, 1-naphthalenemethylamine (1g), 2-thiophenemethylamine (1h), and aminodiphenylmethane (1i) could readily react with aldehydes (2a,b) to generate the expected fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols 3aa–ia,ab in moderate yields, comparable to the previously reported data for most monoadducts. For arylmethanamines (1a–h), the electronic effect of the substituted groups could affect the yields of products 3aa–ha. In general, arylmethanamines bearing electron-withdrawing groups (1c–e) exhibited lower reaction efficiency (13–16%) as compared with those without electron-withdrawing groups (1a,b,f–h) with yields of 19–29%. This observation could be explained by the decreased nucleophilicity of arylmethanamine (NH2, 1c–e) due to the electron-withdrawing effect. In the case of aminodiphenylmethane (1i), the relatively lower yield of 3ia (13%) was probably attributed to the great steric hindrance of two phenyl groups. As for aldehydes (2a,b), 2-ethylbutyraldehyde 2b relative to isobutyraldehyde 2a produced an obviously lower product yield (7% vs. 29%) even by increasing the amount of 1a (20 equiv.) and the reaction temperature (160 °C), probably due to the steric effects.

To expand the scope of the reaction, the substrates were further extended from arylmethanamines to other representative amines. The reaction scope investigation results are listed in Table 3. As can be seen from Table 3, both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing phenethylamines (4a–g), 2-thiophene ethylamine (4h), 3-phenyl-1-propylamine (4i), aliphatic amine (4j), and 2,2-diphenylethylamine (4k) could readily react with isobutyraldehyde (2a) to produce the desired fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols 5aa–ka in comparable yields (15–27%). However, for 2-ethylbutyraldehyde (2b), only less than 2% yield of 5ab was obtained by adopting the reaction conditions similar to those for benzylamine (1a), probably due to the lower reactivity of phenylethylamine (4a) than that of 1a. In addition, the electronic effect of the substituted groups had no obvious impact on product yields. For example, electron-donating substituted 4b–d produced similar product yields as compared with electron-withdrawing substituted 4e–g (19–25% vs. 21–23%), probably attributed to the weak effect of aryl groups on the nucleophilicity of NH2 from amines (4b–d,e–g).

Arylamines such as aniline (6a), 4-methoxyaniline (6b), 4-toluidine (6c), and 4-chloroaniline (6d) were also applied to the above-mentioned system. The reaction scope examination results are summarized in Table 4. In general, electron-donating substituents (6b,c) displayed relatively higher reaction activity, while relatively lower reactivity was detected with the electron-withdrawing group (6d). In the case of 6a,c,d, the reaction with isobutyraldehyde (2a) always produced an unknown byproduct in addition to the expected fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the reaction of 6a with 2-ethylbutyraldehyde (2b), and thus led to the relatively lower product yields of 7aa,ca,da,ab than those from amines 1 and 4 in most cases.

It should be noted that 2-methylbutyraldehyde (2c) was also employed to react with amines, resulting in the generation of cis and trans isomers of fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols. In detail, the reaction of C60 with benzylamine (1a), phenethylamine (4a), and aniline (6a) in the presence of 2c in o-dichlorobenzene at 160 °C at a molar ratio of 1:20:10 (C60:1a/4a/6a:2c) afforded the desired cis/trans-fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols 3ac, 5ac, and 7ac in 16%, 7%, and 15% total yields, respectively (Scheme 1). Fulleropyrroline 8 was always formed concurrently in the reaction with phenethylamine 4a (Scheme 1). Similar phenomena were also observed in the reaction of C60 with 4a and 2-ethylbutyraldehyde 2b (Scheme 2). The formation mechanism of fulleropyrroline 8 has been outlined in Scheme S1 in the ESI.† As for other aldehydes such as monosubstituted acetaldehydes and aromatic aldehydes, their reactions with amines have been previously reported to afford fulleropyrrolines9a and fulleropyrrolidines.8b,e

 Scheme 2  Reaction of C60 with phenethylamine 4a and 2-ethylbutyraldehyde 2b. 
Fulleropyrroline 8 is a known compound, and its identity was confirmed by a comparison of its spectral data with those reported in the literature.5,8e,9a As for the new compounds 3aa–ia,ab, 5aa–ka,ab, 7aa–da,ab, cis-7ac, and trans-7ac, their structures were fully characterized by their MALDI-TOF MS, FT-IR, UV-vis, and 1H and 13C NMR spectra. All MALDI-TOF MS analyses of these new compounds gave the correct [M]− peaks. FT-IR spectra showed the characteristic absorptions of C60 derivatives at about 527, 574, 1185, and 1426 cm−1. Their UV-vis spectra displayed a diagnostic absorption at 429–430 nm for the 1,2-adducts of C60. The expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns were also displayed in their 1H NMR spectra. In their 13C NMR spectra, there were at least 40 peaks including some overlapped ones for the 58 sp2-carbons of the C60 skeleton and two peaks for the two sp3-carbons of the C60 moiety, agreeing well with the C1 symmetry of their molecular structures. It should be noted that the 1H NMR spectra of cis/trans-3ac, 5ac, and 7ac showed similar patterns, and the signals for the pyrrolidine methine proton in the trans isomers were shifted downfield relative to those in the cis isomers, which are consistent with the previous observations.8e,14 Nevertheless, their 13C NMR spectra cannot fully distinguish the cis/trans isomer structures due to the C1 symmetry of cis/trans-3ac, 5ac, and 7ac. Nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) was thus employed to further elucidate their stereochemistry. In the NOESY spectrum, cross peaks from trans isomers could be detected between hydroxyl and methyl protons; however, cross peaks from cis isomers were only observed between hydroxyl and methylene protons. Fig. S1 in the ESI† lists the NOESY spectra for trans- and cis-7ac. A cross peak between hydroxyl and methyl protons could be found in Fig. S1a,† indicating a trans-7ac structure. Meanwhile, a cross peak between hydroxyl and methylene protons is also observed in Fig. S1b,† confirming its cis isomer structure (cis-7ac). Thus, the stereochemistry of cis/trans-3ac, 5ac, and 7ac was unambiguously assigned based on the NOESY spectra.
To further confirm the stereochemistry of cis/trans-3ac, 5ac, and 7ac, theoretical calculations were also exploited to obtain the relative stabilities of their cis and trans isomers. The cis and trans isomers of 7ac were calculated as a representative at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level at 298.15 K (Fig. 1). The calculation results indicated that the cis isomer of 7ac was 2.35 kcal mol−1 more stable than its trans isomer, meaning that the cis isomer rather than the trans isomer would be obtained as the major product, which was consistent with our experimental observation.
 Fig. 1  Optimized structures for the two isomers of 7ac. 
It should be noted that controlled experiments for the preparation of 3aa listed in Table 1 could provide some useful information for the formation mechanism of fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols 3/5/7. For example, oxygen in air should have an important influence on the reaction because only a trace amount of 3aa was obtained under a nitrogen atmosphere (entry 10 vs. 2, Table 1). Furthermore, the radical trapping experiment by the addition of TEMPO could indicate that a radical pathway might be involved in the reaction due to the dramatically decreased product yield (entry 19 vs. 2, Table 1).
On the basis of the above-mentioned controlled experiments (entries 10 and 19, Table 1) together with the previously reported reaction mechanisms,5,8a,b,d,e,g,9–11,15,16 we proposed a possible reaction pathway for the formation of fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols 3/5/7 (Scheme 3). Amine 1/4/6 first reacts with 2,2-disubstituted acetaldehyde 2 to generate α-hydroxyamine intermediate I, followed by dehydration to attain Schiff-base imine II, which can equilibrate to enamine intermediate III. Electron transfer from enamine III to C60 forms enamine cationic radical IV and anionic radical C60˙−, followed by deprotonation of IV by C60˙− to give radical intermediate V and HC60˙. Enamine radical V can either tautomerize to radical intermediate VI (path a) or react with C60 to produce fullerenyl radical VIII (path b). For path a, the subsequent addition of VI to C60 gives fullerenyl radical VII, followed by cyclization to form fullerenyl radical IX, which can react with HO2˙ to produce fullerenyl hyperoxide X. By heating, two molecules of hyperoxide X are decomposed into fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols 3/5/7 with the loss of O2. As for path b, the intramolecular cyclization of XIII first produces fullerenyl radical IX. The subsequent reaction process of IX is the same as path a as shown in Scheme 3.
 Scheme 3  Possible formation mechanism for fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols 3/5/7. 
To further elucidate the relatively lower yields for fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols, controlled experiments were conducted by investigating the thermal stability of typical fulleropyrrolidin-2-ol 3aa. Experimental results indicated that 3aa almost totally remained when the reaction was performed at 100 °C for 1 h under atmospheric conditions (Scheme 4). However, increasing the reaction temperature to 130 °C could lead to the formation of 17% yield of C60 by the thermal decomposition reaction of 3aa (Scheme 4). When the reaction temperature was further increased to 160 °C, 51% yield of C60 was obtained (Scheme 4), indicating that the low thermal stability of fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols also played an important role in decreasing the yields of 3/5/7.

Conclusion
In summary, a simple one-step synthesis of fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols was successfully achieved by the facile metal-free reaction of C60 with amines and 2,2-disubstituted acetaldehydes. The current approach to the synthesis of fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols from cheap and readily available amines and 2,2-disubstituted acetaldehydes is obviously more straightforward and practical than the previous one.5 Furthermore, the current synthetic method also exhibits a remarkably broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, providing a useful route to the preparation of organofullerenes with OH groups.
Experimental section
General methods
The reagents and solvents employed were commercially available without further purification. Purified fullerene products were obtained by flash chromatography over silica gel. UV-vis spectroscopy was performed in CHCl3. IR spectra were recorded with KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 500 or 800 MHz NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts in 1H NMR spectra were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) at 0.00 ppm, while chemical shifts in 13C NMR spectra were referenced to residual DMSO at 39.52 ppm. 4-Hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid was used as the matrix to measure high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) by MALDI-TOF in negative-ion mode.
General procedure for the synthesis of fulleropyrrolidin-2-ols 3/5/7
C60 (36.0 mg, 0.05 mmol), amines 1/4/6 (0.50 mmol), and aldehydes 2 (0.50 mmol) were added into a 50 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer. Then they were completely dissolved in 10 mL chlorobenzene by sonication, and the resulting solution was put into an oil bath preset at 130 °C and stirred under atmospheric conditions. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was employed to carefully monitor the reaction and to stop the reaction at the designated time. The reaction mixture was filtered through a silica gel plug to remove any insoluble materials.
