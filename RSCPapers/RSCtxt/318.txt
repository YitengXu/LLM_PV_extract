    , Accepted 28th May 2020First published on 28th May 2020AbstractA rational design of active, stable, and pH-compatible electrocatalysts is crucial to produce high-purity H2via an electrocatalytic water splitting reaction. Herein, we report a carbonized wood membrane (CWM) embedded with Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles (denoted as MCWM) as an efficient and stable self-supported H2 evolution cathode in both acidic and alkaline solutions. The CWM features a high surface area with numerous aligned and open channels and abundant porosity, greatly facilitating electrolyte transport and gas release. The in situ embedded Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed throughout the entire framework of the CWM, providing abundant active sites. These structural synergies endow the as-fabricated MCWM electrodes with excellent electrocatalytic H2 evolution activity, and the optimal MCWM electrode requires overpotentials of 187 and 275 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, the MCWM electrode exhibits superior H2 evolution stability at a high current density of 80 mA cm−2 in both solutions with nearly 100% faradaic efficiencies. This work provides a promising nature-inspired strategy for the development of self-supported and pH-compatible electrodes for large-scale electrocatalytic H2 evolution reactions.
Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) has been intensively pursued as a future energy carrier due to its renewable and environmentally friendly properties compared to other fuels such as coal, gasoline, methane, etc. It is well-known that electrocatalytic H2 production is a highly energy-input process and the efficiency of the H2 evolution reaction (HER) largely depends on the efficiency of cathode materials.1–3 Noble metals such as Pt and Pt-based materials are known as the most efficient electrocatalysts for the HER.4 However, the scarcity and high cost of Pt apparently limit its large-scale application for the HER.5 Therefore, it is significantly crucial to develop highly active and stable electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements.6–9 In recent years, owing to the Pt-like catalytic activity, a number of Mo-based electrocatalysts, such as Mo2C,10,11 MoO3,12 MoS2,13,14 and Mo2N,15 have attracted substantial interest as a new class of efficient electrocatalysts for the HER. However, the nanostructured Mo-based electrocatalysts developed so far are mainly in the form of fine powders. Although they have shown efficient electrocatalytic HER performance due to the increased density of active sites within materials, their practical application suffers from several problems.16 On the one hand, they need to be casted on the conductive substrate using a polymeric binder, which inevitably blocks the active sites, increases resistance, and inhibits mass transport, thereby suppressing their electrocatalytic HER activity.17 On the other hand, the casted catalytically active component would be easily peeled off from the substrate due to the weak adhesion between the two, thus resulting in an inferior stability for long-term or high-current electrocatalysis.
Recently, nanostructured Mo-based electrocatalysts directly grown on conductive substrates as self-supported and binder-free electrodes have emerged as a desirable alternative to their powdery counterparts.18,19 In this context, Zhang et al. have developed a topotactic transformation strategy to grow orderly oriented nanowire arrays (NWAs) of multiple Mo-based compounds (MoXn, MoXn = MoP, MoS2, Mo2C, MoN, and MoO2) on carbon fibre paper (CFP) from Mo-containing precursor NWAs for the HER in pH-universal electrolytes. Among them, the self-supported Mo2C NWAs/CFP exhibits overpotentials of 190 and 170 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively.20 Zhou et al. have fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) Mo2C/N-doped graphene aerogel cathode with high conductivity and a nitrogen-doped porous structure. In 1 M KOH solutions, this nanostructured aerogel cathode exhibited a low overpotential of 365 mV at 10 mA cm−2.21 Despite the aforementioned progress, the developed self-supported Mo-based electrocatalysts still suffer from the following problems. First, the electron transfer and electrolyte transport within the nanostructured Mo-based electrocatalysts cannot be fully ensured as the length of nanostructures reaches micrometers, resulting in slower reaction kinetics for the HER. Second, owing to the unrelaxed strain between lattice-mismatched substrates and active phases, the peeling off of the active phases from the substrate is still inevitable, leading to a reduced catalytic stability at high operation current.22–26 Third, a relatively high loading of active materials is typically required to achieve a large HER current density. These problems could be solved by embedding highly dispersed active components within a structurally integrated macroscopic conductive substrate to construct a self-supported electrocatalyst. In this context, porous carbon membranes are highly promising for this purpose because of their large surface area, hierarchical pore architecture, excellent electrical conductivity, and good chemical and mechanical stability.27–29
In this work, inspired by the hierarchically porous structure and open microchannels of natural wood, we develop a novel and effective nature-inspired approach to fabricate a self-supported electrode based on a porous carbonized wood membrane (CWM) embedded with highly dispersed Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles by direct two-step carbonization of MoOx-modified natural wood slice (MoOx@NW).30 The as-fabricated Mo2C/MoO3−x@CWM electrode (denoted as MCWM) has the following unique structural merits: (1) the CWM matrix has a large surface area with elongated and open microchannels as well as high porosity, which could provide fast pathways for electrolyte transport and the release of produced H2 gas; (2) the Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles are firmly embedded throughout entire CWM frameworks with a high dispersion, which could provide an abundance of active sites for the HER; (3) the good structural integrity endows the MCWM electrode with good mechanical stability. These merits make the as-fabricated MCWM electrode highly active and stable for the electrocatalytic HER in both acidic and alkaline solutions, and it needs overpotentials of 187 and 275 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. In addition, the MCWM electrode shows high HER stability in both solutions at a high current density with unit faradaic efficiencies.
Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
All reagents including ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. The basswood was received from the Ruiyi Wood Industry Company (China). All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water (18 MΩ cm).
Fabrication of the hierarchically porous monolithic MCWM electrode
The MCWM electrode was synthesized by loading Mo species into the natural wood (NW) slice through a hydrothermal reaction, followed by a two-step carbonization process. In a typical procedure, the basswood was first cut perpendicular to its growth direction into thin slices (2 cm × 3 cm × 2 mm), which were then immersed in a solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (5 mg mL−1) and heated at 150 °C for 3 h in a 50 mL of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to load Mo species into the pores of the NW slices (MoOx@NW-HT). After washing and drying, MoOx@NW-HT was carbonized in air at 260 °C for 6 h in a muffle, and the obtained electrode was denoted as MoOx@NW-LT. Finally, MoOx@NW-LT was transferred into a quartz tube furnace and further carbonized at a high temperature for 6 h at a rate of 5 °C min−1 under a flow of N2 gas (40 mL min−1). The targeted carbonization temperatures were 800, 900, and 1000 °C, and the obtained electrodes were labelled as MCWM-1, MCWM-2, and MCWM-3, respectively.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were taken with an FEI Talos F200s field emission transmission electron microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with a SHIMADZU SSX-550 scanning electron microscope. Power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with a nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 5–80° with a scanning rate of 5° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were carried out using a Kratos Axis Supra spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). Raman spectra were collected using a Raman spectrometer system (Horiba Evolution) with a 532 nm laser as the excitation source. The loading amount of Mo was measured by using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (Varian 710-ES).
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell using a CHI760E potentiostat (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China). The MCWM electrodes were soldered to a Cu wire as the working electrode. The graphite rod and saturated Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was calibrated as E (V vs. RHE) = E (V vs. Ag/AgCl) + 1.046 in 1 M KOH and E (V vs. RHE) = E (V vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.225 in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The reference electrode calibration was performed in a high purity hydrogen saturated electrolyte solution with a Pt wire as the working and counter electrodes. The current–voltage curves were scanned at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, and the average of the two potentials at which the current crossed zero was taken to be the thermodynamic potential for the RHE (Fig. S1, ESI†). The HER polarization curves were measured by using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. All polarization curves were corrected with iRs-compensation. Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the solution resistance (Rs). EIS measurements were carried out from a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 10 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was estimated by measuring the capacitance of the double layer at the solid–liquid interface with cyclic voltammetry (CV). The measurements were performed among a potential window where the faradaic current on the working electrode is negligible. For the measurement of the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the HER, an air-tight, two compartment three-electrode electrochemical cell was used, where the working and reference electrodes were separated from the counter electrode. During the electrolysis, N2 gas was continuously bubbled into the cathodic compartment at a rate of 10 mL min−1. The eluent was delivered directly to the sampling loop of an on-line gas chromatograph (PANNA-A91 Plus) equipped with a molecular sieve-13X 60/80 column. High purity nitrogen (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation process of the MCWM electrode. First, a piece of natural wood (NW) was cut perpendicular to its growth direction into thin slices (thickness: ∼2 mm). Second, the MoOx species were loaded into the NW slice (MoOx@NW-HT) through a hydrothermal reaction of the NW slice and Mo precursor ((NH4)6Mo7O24) in water. The successful loading of the Mo species (MoOx) was first confirmed by the color change from light yellow for the NW slice to brown for the resultant MoOx@NW-HT. During the hydrothermal reaction process, the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin within the NW slice could be partially removed (Fig. S2, ESI†). Afterward, the MoOx@NW-HT slice was first pre-carbonized in air at 260 °C for 6 h to obtain MoOx@NW-LT, which was further carbonized at a high temperature (800, 900, or 1000 °C) for 6 h in a N2 flow to yield a porous self-supported Mo2C/MoO3−x@CWM (denoted as MCWM) electrode. During the two-step carbonization process, the NW slice topologically transformed into a porous carbon matrix with a well-retained macroscopic structure. At the same time, the preloaded MoOx species could be partially converted to Mo2C and reduced to MoO3−x by reacting with the produced carbon species during the carbonization of NW, leading to the formation of highly dispersed Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles within the entire porous framework of the CWM.31 Owing to the aligned and open microchannels, as well as the hierarchically porous structure, the electrolyte could easily permeate into the porous framework of the MCWM electrode during the HER process, and the generated H2 gas was able to unimpededly release from the microchannels without blocking mass transfer.32 In addition, the highly conductive CWM matrix could serve as a great 3D current collector for fast electron transfer to the embedded Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles.33 Also, the Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles are uniformly embedded within the CWM with a high dispersion, which contributes abundant active sites for the HER.34,35
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation process of the MCWM electrode. 
The phase structure of the MCWM electrodes was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1a, only two broadened diffraction peaks located at 2θ values of 26.0° and 42.8°, assigning to the (002) and (100) lattice planes of the graphitic carbon, respectively, could be observed in the XRD pattern of the CWM. This indicates that NW can be successfully formulated into a crystalline carbon matrix.36 For all MCWM electrodes, in addition to the carbon phase, both Mo2C and MoO3 phases could be clearly identified.37–39 The appearance of the Mo2C phase indicates that NW could act as a sole carbon source to practically carbonize the preloaded MoOx species during the carbonization process.37 The structural feature of the electrodes was further investigated using Raman analysis. As displayed in Fig. 1b, all electrodes exhibit two characteristic peaks located at ∼1343 and ∼1590 cm−1, which represent the disordered carbon (D-band) and graphitic carbon (G-band), respectively.40 With increasing the carbonization temperature from 800 to 1000 °C, the relative intensity ratio of the D- to G-band (ID/IG), an indicator of the graphitic degree of carbon materials, exhibits an increased trend in the order of MCWM-3 > MCWM-2 > MCWM-1, suggesting that the reaction between MoOx species and NW becomes more sufficient at a higher carbonization temperature, which would lead to more defects for the CWM matrix. On the other hand, it should be noted that the ID/IG ratio of the MCWM-2 electrode (ID/IG = 0.977) (prepared at 900 °C) is lower than that of the CWM (ID/IG = 0.982) prepared at the same temperature. This suggests that the Mo species could effectively promote the graphitization of the CWM, thus enhancing the conductivity of the MCWM electrode. In addition, in comparison with the CWM, an enhanced 2D band at about 2685 cm−1 is also observed for all the MCWM electrodes, indicating the formation of a graphene-like carbon layer around the Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles, which also favors fast electron transfer.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further performed to get an insight into the elemental composition and chemical states. The XPS survey spectra (Fig. S3a, ESI†) confirm the presence of C, N, O, and Mo elements in the MCWM electrodes. The loading amounts of Mo in MCWM-1, MCWM-2, and MCWM-3 were determined to be 0.5933, 0.5965, and 0.5980 mg cm−2, respectively by ICP-OES analysis (Table S1, ESI†). The C 1s spectra (Fig. S3b, ESI†) can be fitted into four peaks with binding energies of 288.6, 285.7, 284.4, and 283.8 eV, which can be attributed to the C–O, C–N, C–C and Mo–C species,41 respectively. Accordingly, the fitting of the O 1s spectra (Fig. S3c in ESI†) indicates the presence of the Mo–O species for all MCWM electrodes.42,43 In the high-resolution Mo 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 1c), a peak at 228.40 eV originating from Mo2C can also be observed for all MCWM electrodes.44 These results further confirm that a portion of preloaded MoOx species will react with the CWM matrix during the carbonization process to generate an active Mo2C phase in situ, which is also consistent with the results of the XRD analysis. In addition, the preloaded MoOx species can also be partially reduced by the CWM matrix at a high temperature, leading to the formation of a reduced MoO3−x species,45 as reflected by the formation of the Mo5+ species in the Mo 3d spectra. The presence of both Mo2C and MoO3−x species would be expected to lead to a synergistic effect in enhancing the catalytic activity of MCWM electrodes for the HER. As shown in Table S2, ESI,† the ratio of Mo2C to MoO3−x for the MCWM electrodes varies largely with the carbonization temperature. Since both Mo2C and MoO3−x have been considered as the active phases for the HER,37,38 the MCWM electrodes will achieve an optimized activity when the Mo2C/MoO3−x ratio reaches a balance (see discussions below). Moreover, the N 1s XPS spectra (Fig. S3d, ESI†) could be deconvoluted into three main peaks located at ∼398.4, ∼400.3, and ∼401.6 eV, corresponding to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N), and graphitic-N, respectively, all of which were believed to favor the HER processes.46 All of these results indicate that Mo2C/MoO3 nanoparticles were generated and in situ embedded in the N-doped porous carbon membrane with the formation of a strong interaction between the two.
The morphological features of the CWM and MCWM-2 electrodes were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. S4, ESI,† the CWM has naturally porous and low-tortuosity microstructures along its growth direction.47 After embedding Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles within the CWM, the structural features of the CWM is perfectly preserved in the resultant MCWM-2 electrode, indicating that the presence of the Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles has no significant effect on the microstructures of the CWM. Fig. 2a and b reveal the morphologies of the top surface of the MCWM-2 electrode. It can be seen that a number of open pores can be observed on its surfaces, and the diameters of the large and small pores are typically about 25–50 μm and 5–10 μm, respectively. Fig. 2d and e show the side-view SEM images of the MCWM-2 electrode with a typical thickness of ∼600 μm. The microchannels are observed to be open and elongated, which can act as highways for electrolyte transport and gas release in HER electrolysis.48 As revealed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (Fig. 2c and f), the Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles are homogenously dispersed on the outside surfaces and inside walls of the microchannels. Fig. 3a shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the MCWM-2 electrode. The Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles are uniformly embedded within the CWM matrix with a diameter less than 5 nm. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3b) reveals two distinct lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.279 nm and 0.190 nm, which correspond to the (022) plane of Mo2C and the (100) plane of MoO3, respectively. The high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of the MCWM-2 electrode and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental maps (Fig. 3c and d) further demonstrate the homogeneous embedding of the Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles within the N-doped CWM matrix. These results demonstrate that Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles have been successfully embedded within the porous CWM matrix with a high dispersion, which is favorable to provide an abundance of active sites for the HER.

The electrocatalytic activity of the MCWM electrodes for the HER was evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH solutions using a typical three electrode system. All polarization curves were obtained from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The measured current is normalized by the geometrical area of the electrodes, and the measured potential is referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) after uncompensated resistance correction (see the Experimental section). Fig. 4a shows the HER polarization curves of the MCWM electrodes in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, including those of Pt foil and CWM for comparison. As expected, the Pt foil electrode has the best HER performance with a low overpotential of 55 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It can be clearly seen that the CWM shows an inferior HER activity with an overpotential of 617 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Under the same reaction conditions, all MCWM electrodes exhibit reduced overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, revealing that the embedded Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles in the CWM are highly active components for the HER.45,49 Among the MCWM electrodes tested, MCWM-2 needs a low overpotential of only 187 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and the HER activities of the MCWM electrodes follow an order of MCWM-2 > MCWM-3 > MCWM-1. Furthermore, the HER activity of the MCWM-2 electrode is comparable or even superior to that of many other self-supported and powdery Mo-based electrocatalysts in acidic conditions (Table S3, ESI†). To reveal the underlying mechanism of the HER activity, the Tafel plots for various electrodes were generated from their corresponding LSV curves and the Tafel slopes were extracted from the linear region (Fig. 4b). The Tafel slope for Pt foil was calculated to be 27.5 mV dec−1, indicating that the HER on Pt foil follows a Tafel mechanism. For the MCWM electrodes, the Tafel slopes are 265.6, 134.0, and 136.7 mV dec−1 for the MCWM-1, MCWM-2, and MCWM-3 electrodes, respectively. This suggests that the catalytic mechanism of the HER on the MCWM electrodes obeys a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism.50 It should be noted that the Tafel slope is also an effective criteria to estimate the advantages of electrocatalysts as a smaller Tafel slope means better scaling of the kinetics with voltage. Thus, the lower Tafel slope for MCWM-2 indicates a fast HER kinetics probably due to the balanced synergy between the embedded Mo2C and MoO3−x. To gain more insights into the origin of the superior HER catalytic activity of the MCWM-2 electrode, we examined the electrode kinetics by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Nyquist plots displayed in Fig. 4c reveals that the MCWM-2 electrode has the smallest semicircular diameter (related to the charge transfer resistance Rct), indicating its fast electron transfer ability. These results also reveal the importance of a strong interaction between the embedded Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles and CWM matrix in enhancing the electron transfer kinetics. On the other hand, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) between the electrode and electrolyte can be used to estimate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the solid–liquid interface by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. In general, a higher electrochemical surface area (ECSA) usually means more potential active sites for electrocatalysis. As shown in Fig. 4d, the calculated Cdl of MCWM-2 is 50.43 mF cm−2, which is much higher than those of MCWM-3 (30.89 mF cm−2), MCWM-1 (11.8 mF cm−2), and CWM (7.71 mF cm−2). This result suggests that MCWM-2 has more active sites for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, thus exhibiting the best HER activity. For a practical electrocatalyst, apart from having excellent HER activity, maintaining long-term stability at high current density is also crucial for its commercial applications. To evaluate the durability of the MCWM-2 electrode, controlled potential electrolysis was performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution as shown in Fig. 4e, and the obtained current density at an overpotential of 0.392 V is relatively stable with a slight decrease from 80 to 64 mA cm−2 during the 12 h electrocatalytic HER. The good stability of MCWM-2 is also confirmed by comparing the 1st and 1000th LSV curves. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4e, the overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 only slightly increases from 187 mV for the 1st cycle to 214 mV for the 1000th cycle, clearly indicating the superior stability of the MCWM-2 electrode. Furthermore, the evolution of H2 gas was also measured by on-line gas chromatography (GC) during electrolysis (Fig. 4f). The amount of the measured H2 matches well with the calculated values with a nearly 100% FE and a H2 production rate of 1.33 mmol h−1, indicating the high selectivity of the HER on the MCWM-2 electrode. After a long-term stability test in 0.5 M H2SO4, the used MCWM-2 electrode was characterized using SEM, XRD, and XPS. As shown in Fig. S5, ESI,† the macroscopic shape of the MCWM-2 electrode remains intact after the high current HER electrolysis, demonstrating its excellent mechanical strength. In addition, the characteristics of the overall morphology are still retained well. Moreover, the phase structures and chemical states of the embedded Mo2C/MoO3−x and CWM matrix are almost unchanged, indicating the good stability of the MCWM-2 electrode for the HER in acidic solution.

(f) The amount of H2 on the MCWM-2 electrode as a function of time in 0.5 M H2SO4. 
The excellent HER performance of the MCWM electrodes were also examined in 1.0 M KOH solution. As shown in Fig. 5a, Pt foil still shows the best HER performance with an overpotential of 93 mV at 10 mA cm−2, while the CWM exhibits the lowest HER activity. In contrast to the CWM, all MCWM electrodes show enhanced HER activities, and MCWM-2 achieves a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 275 mV, which is lower than those of the MCWM-3 and MCWM-1 electrodes. This value is also among the best of the recently reported Mo-based HER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution (Table S4, ESI†). The Tafel slope of MCWM-2 is calculated to be 134 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5b), implying that the rate-determining step for the HER is the Volmer reaction.51 In addition, MCWM-2 exhibits the lowest Tafel slope among the MCWM electrodes tested, also showing its fast reaction kinetics for alkaline H2 evolution. Moreover, similar to the observations in acidic solution, MCWM-2 demonstrates a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) than those of MCWM-1 and MCWM-3, which further suggests that the fast electron transfer kinetics of MCWM-2 is responsible for its higher HER activity in alkaline solution. Furthermore, MCWM-2 exhibits the highest Cdl among the tested MCWM electrodes, also revealing that MCWM-2 possesses more active sites for the HER in alkaline solution. MCWM-2 also shows high stability toward the HER in alkaline. As shown in Fig. 4(e), the initial current density of 80 mA cm−2 remains almost unchanged during the 12 h of H2 evolution electrolysis. Moreover, the 1st and 1000th LSV curves of MCWM-2 are almost overlapped (the inset of Fig. 5e). In addition, the FE and rate of H2 evolution were calculated to be approximately 100% and 1.85 mmol h−1, respectively, in a 12 h reaction (Fig. 5f). The MCWM-2 electrode after a long-term durability test in 1.0 M KOH was also characterized (Fig. S6, ESI†). Although carbon-based materials typically tend to be etched in alkaline solution, our MCWM-2 electrode still shows good mechanical stability after the high current HER in 1.0 M KOH. XRD and XPS analyses also reveal that the embedded Mo2C/MoO3−x active component is still intact without the formation of the secondary phase. These results indicate that the CWM matrix is effective at preventing the embedded Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles from corrosion in alkaline solution.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a highly active self-supported electrocatalyst for the HER in acidic and alkaline solutions based on a hierarchically porous, N-doped carbonized wood membrane (CWM) with embedded Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles (denoted as MCWM). The open and low-tortuosity microchannels within the 3D CWM matrix endow the MCWM electrodes with enhanced mass transport capability for electrolyte and produced gas. Meanwhile, the firmly embedded Mo2C/MoO3−x nanoparticles with a high dispersion offer abundant active sites for the HER. As a result, the best MCWM electrode exhibits superior HER performance, and it requires an overpotential of 187 mV and 275 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. More importantly, owing to its good structural integrity, the as-fabricated MCWM electrode exhibits good stability for H2 evolution at a high current density in both solutions with high FEs. The nature-inspired strategy developed in this work is highly promising for the development of highly active and stable noble-metal-free, self-supported electrocatalysts for large-scale electrocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting.
