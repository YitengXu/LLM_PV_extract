    , Accepted 2nd November 2021First published on 2nd November 2021AbstractFirst-principles calculations indicate that Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 is more suited to potassium-ion storage because of its lower energy gap than that of KTi2(PO4)3. A flexible Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C nanofiber film (F-MTP/C NFF) has been first synthesized via electrospinning and applied to potassium-ion batteries as a self-standing anode. An integral carbon conductive network, unique one-dimensional nanostructure, and exceptional mechanical flexibility give F-MTP/C NFF outstanding potassium-ion storage performance. Impressively, the self-standing F-MTP/C NFF electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 218 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1 and shows ultra-long cycling stability of 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1. This work may give a new insight into developing NASICON-type Ti-based materials as flexible electrodes for potassium-ion batteries.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, energy and environmental problems are becoming more and more serious. Traditional fossil energy is no longer enough to support the energy demand. The development of renewable energy and clean energy has become the key to solve the current dilemma. A variety of renewable energy sources have sprung up, such as solar, wind and tidal power. In order to effectively store and utilize these renewable energy sources, it is particularly critical to develop energy storage technologies with high energy density and long cycle life. In this context, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in portable devices and electric vehicles.1–3 However, the uneven distribution and high price of lithium resources have hindered the large-scale use of LIBs.4,5 Therefore, it is critical to develop new energy storage technologies that can replace lithium batteries cheaply. Potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) have drawn wide attention in the field of energy storage due to the abundant potassium resources in the Earth's crust (1.5% by mass), and are considered to have great potential to be replacement energy storage devices with the same “rocking chair” working principles as LIBs.6–8 However, the larger diameter of K+ (1.38 Å) causes relatively slow dynamic properties, compared with Li+ (0.76 Å); thus the rate capability of KIBs is seriously restricted.9,10 Besides, there is worse irreversible damage to the crystal structure of the electrode materials during potassiation/depotassiation processes, resulting in poor cycle life. The research on KIBs is still in the preliminary stage. As an important part of batteries, anode materials with high specific capacity, high energy density and good cycling stability are the key to the development of KIBs.
Since the discovery of NASICON (Na superionic conductor)-type phosphates in 1976,11 this type of material has been applied as both cathode and anode materials by researchers, due to its unique open crystal structure and excellent structural stability.12–14 Until now, many NASICON-structure titanium-based phosphates have been reported to be able to store energy, such as LiTi2(PO4)3,15–17 NaTi2(PO4)3,18–20 and KTi2(PO4)3.21–23 However, their fatal flaw of poor electrical conductivity and low theoretical specific capacity usually cause poor rate performance and low discharge/charge capacity. Many strategies have been used to improve their electrochemical properties. Wang et al. applied nanoscale NaTi2(PO4)3 particles encapsulated by a mesoporous carbon matrix to sodium ion batteries (NIBs). Benefiting from the unique architecture, the cells achieve outstanding rate performance with 50 mA h g−1 at 100 C.24 In addition, Voronina et al. adopted an electro-conducting carbon coated layer to increase the electrical conductivity of KTi2(PO4)3, realizing a capacity that approximately equals the theoretical specific capacity.25 Because of the great success of monovalent metal cations, it is very enlightening to explore other analogues with remarkable electrochemical performance as electrode materials. When a divalent metal cation replaces a monovalent metal cation, there are more vacancies generated in 3b sites to gain higher specific capacity.26–28 In 2018, Zhan et al. reported Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 that was prepared through sol–gel means as an NIB anode. Attributed to the increased electrical conductivity of the reduced graphene oxide coating, a capacity of 201.7 mA h g−1 can be acquired at 50 mA g−1, and a capacity of 199.7 mA h g−1 could also be retained at the 100th cycle.29 But reports about MTP for KIBs have not been found.
The development of flexible batteries makes wearable electronic devices possible. Most of the flexible/free-standing electrodes for potassium ion batteries are focused on carbon materials30–32 and transition metal sulfide33–35/oxide36,37/selenium.38,39 Electrospinning is a common method for preparing flexible materials. There are numerous reports about electrospinning for fabricating flexible electrodes.40–42 However, articles about flexible NASICON-type materials as free-standing electrodes for KIBs could not be found.
Herein, we report a facile electrospinning method to fabricate a flexible Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C nanofiber film (hereafter denoted as F-MTP/C NFF) as a free-standing electrode for KIBs for the first time. First-principles calculations are conducted to reveal the electronic structure of Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3. The nanofibers with a structure like ceiba branches are stacked to form a flexible film, and this unique nanostructure can effectively improve the electronic/ionic conductivity of F-MTP/C NFF. Therefore, it shows an outstanding potassium-storage performance as a self-standing anode for KIBs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of F-MTP/C NFF
A flexible Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C nanofiber film (F-MTP/C NFF) was synthesized by a simple electrospinning method. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving (CH3COO)2Mn·4H2O (0.158 g, guangfu, purity 99.0%), P2O5 (0.274 g, Aldrich, Sinopharm, purity 98%) and (CH3CH3CHO)4Ti (Kermel, purity 99%) in 5 mL of EtOH (Kermel, purity 99.7%) and 3 mL of DMF (Hengxing, purity 99.5%). Then 0.5 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1300000, Macklin) and 0.48 g of selenium powder (Macklin, 200 mesh) were added. The mixed solution was stirred overnight at around 35 °C followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 30 min to form a black precursor solution. Then the precursor solution was poured into a syringe with a blunt-tip needle. The voltage was set as 18 kV, and the distance between the needle and grounded aluminum foil was 20 cm. The precursor nanofiber film was directly calcined at 750 °C for 6 h under Ar flow to obtain the F-MTP/C NFF. The synthesis route is shown in Fig. 1.

As a comparison, another Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C nanofiber film was synthesized without Se powder by the same process and named MTP/C NFF. Besides, the KTi2(PO4)3/C nanofiber film (KTP/C NFF) was synthesized by the same process as that of MTP/C NFF, but (CH3COO)2Mn·4H2O in the precursor solution was replaced with CH3COOK (Hengxing, purity 92.0%).
2.2 Computational methods
All geometry optimizations and self-consistent total-energy calculations were performed with the projector-augmented wave (PAW)43 method at the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)44 density functional level, and spin-polarization effects and the dispersion corrections (Grimme DFT-D3) were included.45 The onsite Coulomb interaction was considered to describe the localized d electrons of transition metals, and the Ueff parameters were set to 3 eV for Ti and Mn atoms.46
The plane-wave cutoff was set at 400 eV. A gamma-point-only k space sampling was adopted for the geometry optimizations, and a 6 × 6 × 2 k-mesh generated by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme for the Brillouin zone was used for the electronic-structure calculations.47 An energy convergence criterion of 10−5 eV was used for the self-consistent calculations, while atomic positions were relaxed until the maximal force on each atom was smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. All quantum-chemical calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).48,49
2.3 Physical characterization
The crystal structure of the products was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-3C diffractometer) with Cu-Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 10–60°. The microscopic morphologies were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TESCAN MIRA3 LMH) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). The Raman spectra data were collected using a Microlaser Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia), which was used to characterize the degree of graphitization. The carbon content was tested using thermogravimetry (TG, NETZSCH STA 409 PC/PG). The specific surface area and the pore size were measured based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution peak (ASAP2020PLUS HD88). And X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer with Al Kα radiation to characterize the surface states and chemical compositions of F-MTP/C NFF and MTP/C NFF.
2.4 Electrochemical characterization
The free-standing anodes with an average quantity of 0.8 mg, without any binder and conductive additives, were made by dividing the F-MTP/C NFF or MTP/C NFF into 1 cm discs directly. The 2032-type coin cells were fabricated with a glass fiber filter (Whatman GF/D) functioning as the separator, and 1.0 M KFSI in ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) (1:1 vol%) served as the electrolyte. After being assembled inside a glovebox, the galvanostatic discharge–charge cycling of cells was tested using a Neware CT4008TW battery test system (China) at 25 °C. Cyclic voltammetry and A.C. impedance measurements were performed using a Chenhua CHI660E Analyzer (China).
3. Results and discussion
First-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level were used to better understand the electronic character of the Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (MTP) crystal. The optimized geometries and projected density of states (PDOS) results for this structure are displayed in Fig. 2. For comparison, the optimized geometries and projected density of states (PDOS) results of the KTi2(PO4)3 (KTP) crystal are displayed in Fig. S1.† A band mainly distributed on Mn atoms crossing the Fermi level is observed. Thereby, MTP exhibits metallic properties because the energy gap between the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) is negligible. The electronic character of the KTi2(PO4)3 (KTP) crystal was also examined for comparison, as shown in Fig. S1.† The calculated VBM-CBM energy gap of KTP is 2.8 eV and in good agreement with the previously reported theoretical result.25 Attributed to the smaller band gap, it is predicted that the electronic conductivity of MTP should be remarkably higher than that of KTP. Therefore, MTP with better electrochemical performance can be expected.

The microscopic morphology of the precursor nanofibers and F-MTP/C NFF is illustrated in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2a, b,† indicating that the precursor nanofibers show an almost smooth surface. After calcination, the F-MTP/C NFF (Fig. 3a and b) is woven by interlacing ceiba like nanofibers with an average diameter of 190 nm, forming a remarkable conducting network. This can effectively improve electrical conductivity and alleviate volume expansion during rapid potassiation/depotassiation, and thus improve the cycling stability. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 3d) indicate that all elements (C, Mn, Ti, P, O, and Se) are uniformly distributed in the interiors of nanofibers, but the C and Se elements are non-existent in the raised particles located at the exterior of nanofibers. In comparison, the morphology of the precursor nanofibers (Fig. S2c and d†) and MTP/C NFF hardly changed before and after calcination. MTP/C NFF is woven by nanofibers with a smooth surface and all elements (C, Mn, Ti, P, and O) are uniformly distributed in the nanofibers (Fig. S3†). The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum shown in Fig. 3e further proves the presence of Mn, Ti, P, O, C and Se in F-MTP/C NFF, and the weight ratio of Se is 2.66%. The EDS spectrum of MTP/C NFF is displayed in Fig. S4a† and the weight ratios are shown in the inset, which confirms the presence of Mn, Ti, P, O and C elements. The crystal structures of F-MTP/C NFF and MTP/C NFF can be obtained from the HRTEM images (Fig. 3f and Fig. S3d†) and XRD patterns (Fig. 3g). In Fig. 3f and Fig. S3d,† the lattice fringe of 0.37 nm corresponds to the characteristic crystal plane (2 −1 3) of Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3, and the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 3g indicate that all diffraction peaks agree well with trigonal structured Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 with a space group of R (no. 148), and a broad peak located at about 25° corresponds to amorphous carbon, indicating no impurity phase. The diffraction peak of Se does not appear in the XRD pattern of F-MTP/C NFF, which may be due to the low content of Se. The TEM-EDX mapping line scan was conducted to acquire the detailed element distribution in the F-MTP/C NFF and the MTP/C NFF in Fig. S4b and c.† The distribution of C, Ti and P elements is complementary, the area with a high C content has less Ti and P content but a high Se content, and the Se content is the highest in the fiber surface. This indicates that Se is distributed in carbon and encapsulated MTP particles together with carbon.

The mechanical flexibility characterization of F-MTP/C NFF and MTP/C NFF is shown in the digital photos of Fig. 4. It can be observed that the obtained F-MTP/C NFF can be fully recovered after folding, bending and kneading, while the MTP/C NFF is completely broken, which reveals that the F-MTP/C NFF has remarkable mechanical flexibility. See the supplementary video S1 for detailed procedures. The Se powder therefore is the key factor to improve the mechanical flexibility of the nanofiber membrane. Such a flexibility improvement is consistent with our previous report.50

The XPS survey spectra in Fig. 5a and Auger spectrum of Se (inset in Fig. 5a) show the existence of C, Ti, Mn, P, and O in the two samples and Se in F-MTP/C NFF, which is consistent with the result of elemental mapping and EDS, and further verify the high purity of the materials. The Se 3s peak derived from Auger electrons shows a characteristic peak at 232.3 eV in F-MTP/C NFF. In addition, the high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s and Ti 2p are displayed in Fig. 5b and c to further analyze the electronic state of Ti and C. The C 1s spectra of F-MTP/C NFF and MTP/C NFF consist of three characteristic peaks at 284.8 eV (C–C), 286.4 eV (C–O–C) and 288.9 eV (O–CO).51–53 The peak at 284.8 eV originates from unoxidized carbon and the peaks at 286.4 and 288.9 eV mainly come from the incomplete carbonization of PVP.50,54 The Ti 2p spectra in Fig. 5c show that the two groups of peaks (located at 458.8 eV, 460.1 eV and 464.1 eV, 465.9 eV) correspond to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks, respectively, which implies the presence of Ti3+. As shown in Table S1,† the ratios of Ti 3+ to Ti 4+ in F-MTP/C NFF and MTP/C NFF are 40.2% and 34.0%, respectively. Considering the XPS results, the larger ratio of Ti3+ in F-MTP/C NFF could be attributed to the formation of an oxygen vacancy, which could be attributed to the formation of Se–O bonds by Se and the oxygen of MTP during calcination, and MTP loses oxygen to form an oxygen vacancy, and thus Ti4+ gains electrons and reduces to Ti3+. The electrical conductivity of F-MTP/C NFF could be improved due to the increase of the mixed valence state of Ti, so as to enhance the K+ storage performance and the rate performance of batteries.55–57 Besides, the O 1s spectra of the two samples indicate that the binding energy of the F-MTP/C NFF (531.7 eV) is higher than that of MTP/C NFF (531.5 eV) (Fig. S5†). The slight shift is attributed to oxygen vacancies neighboring to Ti3+.58–60 The weight loss of the samples was detected by thermogravimetry (TG) from 30 °C to 900 °C in air (Fig. S6†). Before the temperature rises to 200 °C, the weight loss comes from adsorbed and interstitial water. From 200 °C to 400 °C, a loss of 1.8% may be the sublimation of SeO2. Carbon burning occurs in the later range of 400–800 °C, corresponding to a carbon content of about 26.3%. The introduction of carbon can effectively accelerate the electron transfer and thus improve the electrical performance of F-MTP/C NFF. While in the MTP/C NFF, the carbon content is about 13.0%. The higher carbon content is also a key reason for the better flexibility of F-MTP/C NFF. The Raman spectra shown in Fig. S7† were recorded to further confirm the presence of carbon. The peaks located at 1348 cm−1 correspond to the disordered arrangement and defects of sp3-C (D band) and those at 1586 cm−1 were the characteristic peaks of sp2-C (G band). In general, the relative strength of the D peak and G peak ID/IG can be used to characterize the graphitization degree of carbon in the material.61,62 And the ID/IG = 0.97 in F-MTP/C NFF compared to that of MTP/C NFF (ID/IG = 0.99) showed a similar graphitization degree. The specific surface area and pore type can be measured using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. 5d). As proved by the inset of Fig. 5d, F-MTP/C NFF has a larger specific surface area and pore volume (189.7 m2 g−1, 0.083 cm3 g−1) than the MTP/C NFF (49.4 m2 g−1, 0.077 cm3 g−1), which can increase the effective interface area between the electrode and electrolyte and shorten the ion diffusion path thus reaching better electrochemical performance. N2 adsorption and desorption curves at P/Po = 0.5–1 showed a hysteresis loop which is in correspondence with the isotherms of type IV, demonstrating that there were a large number of mesopores in the two samples. The pore diameter distribution indicates that the pore size of both F-MTP/C NFF and MTP/C NFF is concentrated at 3.6 nm. Interestingly, the number of micropores in F-MTP/C NFF is much larger than that in MTP/C NFF. The larger specific surface area, pore volume and larger numbers of micropores may be related to the pores produced during the sublimation of Se powder.

The electrochemical properties of MTP/C NFF powder as active materials mixed with a conductive agent and binder and coated on a copper current collector to prepare a working electrode are shown in Fig. S8.† See the ESI† for the detailed electrode preparation process. MTP/C NFF powder shows good rate capability, and it delivers discharge specific capacities of 241.6, 211.9, 186.9, 162.8, 142.4 and 128.4 mA h g−1 in the current density range from 0.02 to 1 A g−1. Although KTP/C NFF shows a similar structure, morphology, and carbon content to MTP/C NFF (Fig. S9†), the rate performance of KTP/C NFF powder is much worse than that of MTP/C NFF powder (Fig. S8†). This could be attributed to the better electronic conductivity of MTP than that of KTP, which is consistent with the results of first-principles calculations. However, MTP/C NFF shows awful rate capability as a free-standing electrode as shown in Fig. 6a. The capacity of the MTP/C NFF electrode drops fast from 0.02 to 0.1 A g−1, and then it goes to almost zero. When the current density recovers to 0.02 A g−1, only 145.8 mA h g−1 can be maintained. It is exciting that F-MTP/C NFF shows outstanding rate capability as a free-standing electrode. The F-MTP/C NFF electrode can reach a capacity of 217.5 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1 and even 87.5 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and recovers to 227.9 mA h g−1 when the current density goes back to 0.02 A g−1. This indicates that the introduction of Se powder can greatly improve the mechanical flexibility and the rate performance of the free-standing MTP/C NFF electrode.

(d) Cycling performance of the F-MTP/C NFF electrode under 0.02 A g−1. (e) Long-term cycling performance of the F-MTP/C NFF electrode under 1 A g−1. 

Fig. 5b and c show the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) profiles at 0.02 A g−1 and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 of F-MTP/C NFF in the first three cycles. In the first potassiation/depotassiation process, two pairs of redox peaks at 1.44/2.14 V and 0.52/0.86 V correspond to the redox of Ti4+/Ti3+ and Ti3+/Ti2+, respectively. There is a nonnegligible anodic peak located at 1.85 V, which could be due to the formation of K2Se. However, in the cathodic process, there are only two peaks corresponding to the reduction of Ti. And from the GCD profiles in Fig. 6b, there are only two group plateaus corresponding to the redox of Ti. This may be due to the low Se content and the peak of K2Se conversion to Se coincides with the reduction peak of Ti.63,64 Also, a distinct irreversible peak located at 0.08 V is shown in the first cathodic scan and disappears in the later scans, which is considered as the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. In the later scans, the curves overlap well. This demonstrates remarkable cyclability and is also consistent with the GCD test.
The cycling performances of F-MTP/C NFF are displayed in Fig. 5d and e. Under a current density of 0.02 A g−1, the electrode shows an initial discharging capacity of 389.8 mA h g−1 and a charging capacity of 202.5 mA h g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of 51.9%. The low initial CE may be due to the SEI formed by the side reaction between the electrode surface and electrolyte.65,66 But the CE increases to 93.6% in the second cycle and stabilized at close to 100% in the later cycles. After 100 cycles, the F-MTP/C NFF electrode reveals a discharging capacity of 196.6 mA h g−1. By contrast, MTP/C NFF merely delivers a discharge specific capacity of 125.8 mA h g−1 in the 50th cycle (Fig. S10†). As for the continuous cycling at 1 A g−1, the capacity of F-MTP/C NFF gradually grows in the few dozens of cycles due to the enhanced activation of the electrode,50,67,68 and then remains stable. The XRD patterns of the F-MTP/C NFF electrode before cycling and after 100 cycles are shown in Fig. S11,† indicating that no phase transition occurs before and after the capacity increase. The electrode possesses a capacity of 53.2 mA h g−1 until the 2000th cycle at 1 A g−1 with a CE of nearly 100%, proving the excellent electrochemical properties.
The TEM image and digital photo of the F-MTP/C NFF electrode after cycling at 1 A g−1 for 2000 cycles are displayed in Fig. 7a. They reveal that the integrity of the electrode and the unique morphology of ceiba like nanofibers can be well retained after long-term cycling. In Fig. 7b, the clear lattice fringes indicate that the cycled material still has good crystallization, and the lattice spacing of 0.37 nm corresponds to the (2 −1 3) lattice plane of MTP. The TEM image (Fig. 7c), the EDS spectrum (Fig. S12†) and the corresponding element mapping images (Fig. 7d) indicate that the distribution of C, Mn, Ti, P, O, and Se in the F-MTP/C NFF after cycling is the same as that in the fresh F-MTP/C NFF, but the K is additionally observed. The observation demonstrates that the F-MTP/C NFF has excellent cyclability.

The K+ radius is relatively larger, leading to a lower migration rate and a bigger barrier of potassium ions in the material. To explain the excellent rate performance of F-MTP/C NFF compared to that of MTP/C NFF, the impedance test was carried out after cycling at 0.02 A g−1 for 10 cycles. As illustrated in Fig. 8a, the Nyquist plots of the two electrodes both present a semicircle in the high-frequency region and a straight line in the low-frequency region. The equivalent circuit is shown as the inset of Fig. 8a, Rs represents the resistance between the electrolyte and nanofiber surface, Rct is the charge transfer resistance and the SEI contribution is shown as a semicircle. W1 is the Warburg impedance corresponding to the straight line, which represents the diffusion behavior of K+ in the low-frequency region and CPE is the interface resistance of the electrode and electrolyte.53,69,70 The Rs and Rct of F-MTP/C NFF and MTP/C NFF are fitted using ZView software and displayed in Table 1. It is noteworthy that the Rct of F-MTP/C NFF is far less than that of MTP/C NFF, suggesting an increased kinetic activity of the electrochemical reaction. The diffusion coefficient of K+ (DK+) can be calculated according to eqn (1). σw is the Warburg coefficient which has the following relationship with Z′ as shown in eqn (2). DK+ = R2T2/2A2n4F4C2δW2(1) Z′ = Rs + Rct + δwω−1/2(2)where R is the gas constant of 8.314 J mol−1 K−1, T is the Kelvin temperature, A is the surface area of the electrode, n is the number of electrons per mole during the electron transfer reaction, F is the Faraday constant of 96500 C mol−1, C is the potassium ion concentration, and σW is the Warburg coefficient that is identical to the slope of Z′ ∼ ω−1/2 as shown in Fig. 8b. According to the fitted data (see Table 1), the potassium diffusion coefficient (DK+) of the F-MTP/C NFF electrode is 1.4 × 10−16 cm2 s−1. By contrast, the value of the MTP/C NFF electrode is 9.3 × 10−17 cm2 s−1. Through kinetic analysis, the introduction of Se powder can significantly increase the DK+, and reduce the side reaction and interface impedance between the electrode material surface and the electrolyte, so that F-MTP/C NFF has an excellent performance of potassium storage compared to MTP/C NFF.

4. Conclusions
In summary, Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 has better intrinsic conductivity than KTi2(PO4)3 as evidenced by theoretical calculations. For the first time, an electrospun flexible Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C nanofiber film (F-MTP/C NFF) was utilized as a free-standing potassium-ion battery electrode. The integrated carbon network, extraordinary nanostructure, and especially excellent structural flexibility guarantee fast electron/K+ transportation of F-MTP/C NFF as a free-standing electrode. It delivers a high specific capacity of 218 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1, and excellent rate capability with a capacity of 87.5 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. Notably, the electrode exhibits impressive cycling stability as demonstrated by over 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. This work not only proves that Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 is a promising candidate as an anode for KIBs but the polyanionic compounds can serve as stable flexible electrodes.
