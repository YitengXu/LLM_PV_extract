    , Accepted 24th May 2021First published on 25th May 2021AbstractDiverse shapes (i.e. nanocube, nanowire, and nanosheet) of CH3NH3PbBr3 nanocrystals could be achieved by controlling thermodynamic (surface ligands) and kinetic (aging time, feed rate, and concentration) parameters for optimized design of optoelectronic properties and device development.
Organometallic halide perovskites (OHPs) have achieved unprecedented development in optoelectronic and energy conversion applications such as highly-efficient solar cells,1,2 light emitting devices,2–4 and photodetectors5,6 owing to their excellent photovoltaic and optoelectronic characteristics.1–6 More recent studies were focused on colloidal OHP nanocrystals (NCs) to further enhance their optical and electronic properties such as wide tunability of absorption and emission, spectral bandwidth, and quantum efficiency via the control of low dimensional structures that significantly affect the energy band structure.7–12 For example, the thickness of OHP nanoplatelets and the relevant bandgap energy and photoluminescence (PL) could be tuned in the visible wavelength range by doping various organic cations.12–14 For all-inorganic lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3; X = Cl, Br, I), Pan et al. reported that the molecular structure of organic acid–base combinations plays an important role in the control of the overall morphology from nanocubes to nanoplates.15 Although the dimension of the OHP and all-inorganic perovskite NCs was successfully reduced by adopting a combination of carboxylic acids and alkylamines (i.e. binary ligands),9,16–20 the precise control of OHP crystalline shapes remains rather unexplored due to limited understanding of the role of individual acids and amines and binary ligands in the crystal growth and surface characteristics.
The ionic nature of OHP NCs induces fast crystallization in a non-polar solvent, resulting in a relatively uniform crystalline shape (i.e. nanocubes). Subsequently, the morphological transformation of those OHP nanocubes was demonstrated to form microscale cube solids via Ostwald ripening under insufficient surface ligands in a solution phase due to the dynamic nature of redissolution and crystallization.17 Furthermore, it was shown that the surface properties, associated with the colloidal stability of OHP NCs, are significantly affected by the molecular architecture of the surface ligands due to the steric hindrance.19–21 These results indicate that the organic acids and bases can alter the surface interactions between OHP NCs arising from the hydrogen bonding between the edge halide atoms and the ammonium groups at the surface of the ionic perovskite NCs.19–21 However, despite the progress in the synthesis of OHP NCs and the relevant optoelectronic characteristics, a framework for understanding how the surface ligands impact their morphological evolution is still lacking.
Diverse shapes of colloidal NCs can be achieved by a set of thermodynamic (e.g., surface capping) and kinetic (e.g., temperature and concentration) parameters that allow precise control of the nucleation and growth process.22–30 In particular, the surface energy is the key parameter that affects growth pathways of nuclei into NCs with distinctive shapes.22 In many cases, preferential growth along a specific crystalline direction can be promoted when the surface free energy at a specific facet can be modulated by the surface ligands with a high affinity.24,25 Although classical nucleation theory emphasizes the role of the thermodynamic (i.e. capping agents) and the kinetic (i.e. precursor and ligand concentration, feed rate, etc.) parameters in the equilibrium shape of NCs, the influence of a set of experimental parameters (i.e., temperature, aging, feed rate, concentration, molecular structure of organic ligands) on the shape of OHP NCs has not yet been investigated in part because of lack of systematic studies.
In this study, we systematically identify the parameters responsible for the morphological evolution of CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) NCs by tuning the reaction temperature, aging time, feed rate of precursors (i.e. CH3NH3Br and PbBr2), and concentration and molecular structure of carboxylic acids and alkylamines. In the presence of binary ligands (i.e. alkylamines and oleic acid), the morphological evolution from nanocubes to one-dimensional (1D) nanowires or two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets was observed depending on the molecular structure of alkylamines that can affect the binding affinity of ligands to the NC surface. Furthermore, a kinetic pathway for anisotropic growth of NCs could be achieved by controlling the feed rate to induce the supersaturation of the precursors, associated with the nucleation and growth process. Therefore, these experimental studies provide a comprehensive understanding of the morphological evolution of OHPs, providing new insights into the rational synthesis of OHP NCs with desired morphological features.

Fig. 1(a) shows the experimental procedure where toluene was added to the precursor solution (MABr, PbBr2, n-octylamine, and oleic acid in DMF). The feed rate of toluene was controlled in the range of 0.02 to 300 mL min−1 using a syringe pump or separatory funnel. Once the toluene (i.e. 8 mL) was completely added, the samples were stirred for a day. SEM images exhibit the well-defined rectangular shapes of MAPbBr3 crystals with a comparable side length of a few micrometer at low feed rates (0.02–0.5 mL min−1) (Fig. 1b–d). Since the MAPbBr3 crystals have a cubic structure (space group: Pmm) with a lower surface energy of the {001} facets on the surface, their equilibrium shape would be a cube enclosed by the {001} facets when the total Gibbs free energy reaches the global minimum. This reveals that the injection rate (0.02–0.5 mL min−1) of the non-solvent (i.e. toluene) is low enough to allow the migration of adatoms and their clusters to grow the cubic seeds via surface diffusion.

SEM images of the MAPbBr3 crystals synthesized at the feed rate of (b) 0.02, (c) 0.05, (d) 0.5, and (e) 300 mL min−1, respectively. (f) TEM image and diffraction pattern (inset) of a single MAPbBr3 NW. (g) Scheme showing a crystal shape determined by the preferential growth process depending on the feed rate. 
In contrast, at the higher feed rate (300 mL min−1), the formation of single-crystalline nanowires (NWs) with a length of ∼5 μm was observed (Fig. 1e and f), indicating a variation of the morphological shape arising from the preferential (i.e., anisotropic) crystal growth along the specific axis [001] depending on the feed rate. Abrupt reduction of solubility in the precursor solution greatly accelerates the formation of nuclei and their subsequent growth into nanocrystals and microcrystals with distinctive shapes that are determined by the subtle interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.22 When the deposition rate of the adatoms and their clusters at the active sites is much higher than the surface diffusion rate, the anisotropic growth along a specific direction can be significantly promoted in the presence of capping agents such as organic acids and bases, resulting in the formation of kinetically favoured 1D NWs (Fig. 1g).
To gain a crucial insight into the initial stage of MAPbBr3 nucleation and growth depending on the injection rate, we monitored the UV-vis absorbance (Abs) and photoluminescence (PL) emission as a function of toluene amounts to induce their crystallization (Fig. 2). The initial precursor solution (i.e., MABr and PbBr2 dissolved in DMF) emits an orange color (λ = 612 nm), originating from the DMF–PbBr2 complex (Fig. 2a and b, black line).31 At a low feed rate (0.05 mL min−1), strong and broad blue-shifted PL emission (λmax = 423 nm, full width at half maximum; FWHM = 79 nm) along with weak orange emission (λ = 612 nm) was observed after the addition of toluene (4.4 mL) (Fig. 2a). This strong quantum confinement suggests that small-sized MAPbBr3 crystals (∼a few nm) were initially produced by the equilibrium dynamics between crystallization and dissolution in the presence of a relatively large amount of DMF (2 mL) (Fig. S1, ESI†).32 As the amount of toluene increases (>5.2 mL), their PL emission exhibits a gradual red-shift from λmax = 423 nm to 545 nm, indicating that the characteristic dimension of the MAPbBr3 crystals continuously increases as a result of the consistent growth of the pre-existing MAPbBr3 seeds at low injection rates (Fig. 2c). However, at a higher feed rate (300 mL min−1), narrow and single PL emission (FWHM = 28 nm) was observed at λmax = 460 nm upon the addition of toluene (4.4–7.2 mL), and the orange emission arising from the DMF–PbBr2 complex completely disappeared (Fig. 2b). This distinct behavior can be understood as a consequence of the rapid drop of the solubility, which immediately initiates the formation of numerous nuclei. Notably, further addition of toluene (8.0 mL) exhibits a bimodal PL spectrum at 460 nm and 550 nm due to the coexisting NC dimensions arising from the subsequent growth of nuclei (Fig. 2b). Therefore, Fig. 2c clearly shows the distinct pathways (i.e., thermodynamic and kinetic control) for the nucleation and growth of the MAPbBr3 NCs with a characteristic dimension at the initial stage, and finally the crystal shape taken by the product is highly dependent on the feed rate, as shown in Fig. 1.

(c) Exciton emission wavelength at the maximum PL intensity as a function of the amount of toluene. 
To understand how the MAPbBr3 NCs evolve into microcrystals with a distinct shape (i.e., 1D wires and 3D cubes), a time-dependent analysis on the crystal growth was performed at T = 25 and 40 °C by measuring the crystal size and monitoring the UV-vis Abs and PL emission (Fig. 3 and S2–S4, ESI†). Initially, several nanocubes with a size of ∼200 nm and the aggregates of smaller NCs were observed (Fig. 3a and S2, ESI†), and no significant change in their shape and size was observed for aging (1 h) at T = 25 °C (Fig. 3b and S2, ESI†). After 3 hours, a few nanorods with a length of ∼2 μm began to appear (Fig. 3c), and the abrupt conversion (or growth) of cube-shaped crystals into anisotropic NWs with a length of ∼5 μm was observed at t = 5 h (Fig. 3d). Interestingly, the NC aggregates, which were accumulated at the space between the cube-shaped crystals after centrifugation, completely disappeared, denoting that the NCs with much lower dimensions had been consumed for the growth of MAPbBr3 NWs (Fig. 3d). The gradual red-shift and complete disappearance (after 5 h) of the PL emission (λmax = 460 nm), originating from the quantum confinement of the NCs in the aggregates, further confirm their contribution to the subsequent growth of the 1D NW crystals (Fig. 3f and S4, ESI†). At a higher temperature (T = 40 °C), this morphological evolution occurs at a shorter timescale (Fig. 3e, S3 and S4, ESI†).

Despite the kinetic control for the growth of the MAPbBr3 crystals at the high feed rate, it still requires the capping agents for their confined growth along a specific crystal direction. Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates how the presence of the OAm/OA binary ligand system induces the morphological evolution of the MAPbBr3 crystals to 1D NW crystals. Regardless of the OA contents, only the MAPbBr3 nanocubes with similar sizes (∼100 nm) were observed at a low concentration (0.03 mmol; MABr:OAm = 1:0.2) of OAm (Fig. 4a–d). In contrast, the shape of the MAPbBr3 NCs drastically changed to 1D NWs in the presence of OA, when a higher amount of OAm (0.18 mmol; MABr:OAm = 1:1.1) was added (Fig. 4e–h). This result reveals that the combination of OAm and OA ligands plays a crucial role as a capping agent for the anisotropic growth of the MAPbBr3 crystals in a liquid phase (Fig. 4i). Similarly, Almeida et al. found that the high concentration of OlAm/OA binary ligands in a nonpolar medium is necessary to promote the protonation of OlAm by OA, and the resulting oleylammonium induces the anisotropic growth of CsPbBr3.33 Furthermore, our prior studies demonstrated that the pre-existing MAPbBr3 NCs can be re-dissolved in the presence of binary ligands (i.e., alkylamine and carboxylic acids), leading to Ostwald ripening during the NC growth.17 Therefore, these results demonstrate that the kinetics of the MAPbBr3 crystal growth can be further modulated by the acid–base chemistry of OAm/OA binary ligand systems, resulting in the morphological transformation of the MAPbBr3 crystals into anisotropic NWs via Ostwald ripening confined by the octylammonium species. It should be noted that the further growth of MAPbBr3 NWs with a length of ∼15 μm could be achieved by excluding the stirring process and sonication that result in mechanical damage during their aging (Fig. S5, ESI†).

The insets show the distribution of the average particle size. 
In addition, we report the dependence of the MAPbBr3 crystal shape on the molecular structure of various alkylamines since the preferential binding of ligands to the NC surface can be affected by several factors such as electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with the ions and the ligands and steric hinderance between ligands (Fig. 5). Similar to the sample with OAm, the NW formation was observed when DDAm with a slightly longer alkyl backbone and the most common OlAm were adopted during the aging process (Fig. 5a and b). Interestingly, 2D MAPbBr3 sheets with a size of ∼20 μm were obtained for the sample with ODAm, and are twice as long as the length of the sheets for the sample with OAm (Fig. 5c and d). However, the correlation between the shape transformation and the chain length of organic ligands is unclear despite several reports on the ligand-mediated control of the crystal shape in the CsPbBr3 system.16 Although the different shapes of the MAPbBr3 crystals were obtained via their morphological evolution during the aging process with various combinations of alkylamines and carboxylic acids, their crystal structure (cubic phase, Pmm) was identical, exhibiting similar absorbance and PL emission (Fig. S6, ESI†). The crystal shapes and optical properties of MAPbBr3 achieved herein are summarized in Fig. S7 and S8.† It can be seen that nanoscale (∼100 nm) and microscale (∼5 μm) 3D cubes, 2D sheets, and 1D nanowires with a high (∼15 μm) and low (∼5 μm) aspect ratio were successfully synthesized via ligand-mediated morphological evolution of the MAPbBr3 crystals.

In summary, the morphological shape (i.e., 1D and 2D) of the MAPbBr3 crystals could be controlled by tuning the kinetic pathway for anisotropic growth of NCs in the presence of binary ligands. At the initial stage, the level of supersaturation for the distinct nucleation and growth was carefully adjusted by the injection rate of the non-solvent. In particular, when both carboxylic acids and alkylamines were involved in the aging process, further growth of NCs into nanocrystals and microcrystals with distinctive shapes could be accomplished, revealing an important prerequisite for the desired NC morphology.
