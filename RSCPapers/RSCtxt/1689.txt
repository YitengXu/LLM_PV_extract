This method has some advantages: the process is simple and single step; the reaction can be performed under low temperature. The TNFs are highly crystalline and free of aggregation.
Many hierarchical one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor nanostructures such as nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes are receiving much attention because of their unusual properties rather than bulk. Specially, oriented single-crystalline TiO2 nanorods (TNR) or nanowires (TNW),1,2 microspheres,3nanotubes (TNT)4 and nanocorals (TNC)5,6 would be most desirable, but achieving these structures is a challenging task. Synthesis of aligned nanowire arrays is a critical step toward enhancing nanostructure performances in nanoscale devices. Compared to ZnO, symmetry and crystal structure of TiO2 (either anatase or rutile), makes growth of oriented anisotropic single crystalline TiO2 thin films very difficult. We describe a single-step synthesis of rutile TiO2 nanoflowers (TNF) comprising a bunch of aligned nanorods in room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL). The high thermal stability, negligible vapor pressure, wide electrochemical window, no combustion, non-toxicity, and unusual dissolving capability of RTIL are widely explored in various applications especially in the field of organic synthesis, catalysis, separation and good solvents for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).7 Many attempts have been made for controlling the morphology of TiO2 using different techniques which includes electrodeposition,8 solvothermal8 and hydrothermal,9anodization10 template based growth sol–gel electrophoresis,11 and by using different surfactants.12 Many inorganic nanostructures,13,14 including TiO2,15–20 have been fabricated via various IL-involved processes. For titania nanomaterials, however, to the best of our knowledge, few studies about the synthesis of rutile nanostructures have been reported in IL solutions.21,22 Recently, Kunlun Ding et al. successfully developed a route for the synthesis of high quality TiO2 nanocrystals in ionic liquid via a microwave-assisted process.23–25
Bin et al. have reported the effects of temperature, initial reactant concentration, titanium precursor and acidity for the growth of TiO2 nanorods. The study concluded that the equal volume proportion of H2O and HCl is favorable for growth of well aligned TiO2 nanorods.26 Therefore, we choose equal volumes of concentrated HCl and H2O, which is the requirement for slow hydrolysis of TTIP. In a typical synthesis, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (0.5 mL) was added to an equal volume of distilled water and concentrated HCl. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min. The clear transparent solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (25 mL), and a piece of glass was immersed in the solution parallel to the wall. The autoclave was sealed and placed in an oven at 180 °C for 3 h. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, the TiO2 films were washed several times with distilled water and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 1 h and the sample was designated as TNR. In this reaction, the (110) planes of rutile TiO2 could be retained due to the relatively slow growth rate for the O2− terminated planes in comparison to other crystal planes. For preparing TiO2 nanoflowers (TNF), we used 0.5 mL (in 25 ml of H2O:HCl) RTIL, 1:3-ethoxycarbonylethyl-1-methyl-imidazolium chloride [CMIM][HSO4], titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) and concentrated HCl as a precursor in distilled water for the synthesis of TNR. (Please see ESI† S1 for synthesis of [CMIM] [HSO4] RTIL). The autoclave was sealed and placed in an oven at 180 °C for 3 h. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, the TiO2 films were washed several times with distilled water and dried ian oven at 70 °C for 1 h and the sample was designated as TNF. The morphology of the prepared TiO2 samples was characterized by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL-JSM-6360 operated at 20 keV). The structural properties of the TiO2 films were studied from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Philips, PW 3710, Almelo, Holland) operated at 25 kV, 20 mA with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The Raman spectra of the films were recorded in the spectral range of 36–3600 cm−1 using Fourier-Transform Raman spectrometer (Bruker MultiRAM, Germany Make) Nd:YAG laser source with excitation wavelength of 1064 nm and resolution 4 cm−1 at 336 mW laser power. Fig. 1 shows the FESEM images of TNR prepared by hydrothermal route. Most of structures displayed microspheres containing nanorods of ∼250 nm diameter. It is suggested that because of the complete miscibility of water and HCl with the TTIP, microspheres containing ∼250 nm sized nanorods are formed during the hydrothermal process. The nanorods are nearly perpendicular to the glass substrate. The nanorods are tetragonal in shape with square top facets, the expected growth habit for tetragonal crystal structures. Fig. 2 shows the TiO2 nanoflowers with petals comprising a bunch of aligned nanorods, prepared in RTIL. It retains the rod like array geometry but the nanorod diameter drastically decreased to ∼62 nm. Scheme 1 illustrates the mechanism for the aligned nanorods and nanoflowers formation. More SEM and FESEM images of TNR and TNF are available in Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI.†

When the longer-chained 1:3-ethoxycarbonylethyl-1-methylimidazolium chloride [CMIM][HSO4] RTIL is employed, nanoflowers comprising a bunch of aligned nanorods were obtained. The ionic liquid content in the precursor solution controlled formation of regular, titania aligned nanorod arrays having ∼62 nm size. This is due to the fact that a presence of 3-carboxymethyl-1-methylimidazoliurn bisulfate [CMIM][HSO4] can effectively control the gathering of the nanoparticles and improve the dispersion in the reaction system just like a surfactant. Because the RTIL can cap the surface of the nanocrystals, it provides a low agglomeration tendency, good dispersibility and the potential to tailor the surface properties. Furthermore, RTILs can form extended hydrogen bond systems in the liquid state resulting in highly structured TNF. The [CMIM]+ ions are separated in accordance with the mutual π-stacking distance (0.6–0.7 nm) between the aromatic rings. So we suggest that the [CMIM]+ cations facilitates the optimized relocation of the molecules based on its ability to self-assemble into ordered structures, stabilized by additional π–π* interactions between the methylimidazolium rings of [CMIM][HSO4].
It is suggested that, two particular properties of [CMIM][HSO4] enhance the growth of rutile TNF containing a bunch of aligned nanorods. Firstly, as molten salts, [CMIM] [HSO4] ions promote the ionic strength by dissolving in solution and consequently enhancing the solubility of the Ti species. After the formation of [Ti(OH)2Cl2(OH)2] growth units of titania nanocrystals grow at step edges proceeded by the addition of Ti species. Secondly, although polar, [CMIM][HSO4] can serve as efficient surfactants by dissolving in solution to form steady solutions, and then cap on the nanocrystal facets to enhance the orientation of particles after rutile particles were formed.
It also offers excellent ionic strength to the growth solution which favors the formation of small crystals through electrostatic screening which is not available in traditional surfactants.  Fig. 3 (a) shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the TNF sample. The SAED pattern of the rutile crystal shows a spot pattern which indicates a single-crystalline nature of the rutileTiO2 nanorods.27,28 The XRD pattern of TiO2 with and without RTIL, which matches well with the standard pattern of tetragonal rutile phase (SG, P42/mnm; JCPDS-08-4920, a = b = 4.53 Å and c = 2.92 Å) that are free of anatase and brookite impurities. Compared to the XRD pattern of TNR, the (110) diffraction peak of TNF was significantly broadened, ESI†S4-XRD). The formation of the dark spot pattern indicates the single crystalline nature of the sample.
 Fig. 3  (a) SAED pattern of the TNFs. (b) High magnification TEM image of the TNFs. 
The clear lattice fringe of the single nanorod of the nanoflower sample is observed to be single crystalline along their entire length. The interplanar spacings obtained from the HRTEM lattice fringes of TNF (Fig. 3), d110 = 3.3 ± 0.1 Å between the adjacent lattice fringes perpendicular to the rod axis can be assigned to the rutile TiO2 (110). The lattice spacing of d001 = 2.9 ± 0.1 Å along the longitudinal axis direction pertains to the d-spacing of rutile TiO2 (001) crystal planes. This indicates the formation of a single crystalline rutile phase, in agreement with the XRD results (ESI† S4).
First-order Raman spectra of rutile TiO2 shows four Fourier Transform (FT) Raman active fundamental modes at 143 (B1g), 447 (Eg), 612 (A1g), and 826 cm−1 (B2g) expressed as A1g + B1g + B2g + Eg. For the rutile phase, two prominent maxima at 445 (Eg) and 609 cm−1 (A1g), are comparable with that found in the rutile TiO2 single crystal (Fig. 4). In addition, there are second-order scattering features, the most prominent one at ∼237 cm−1 (Eg) peak due to the multiple-phonon scattering processes, which is also considered as a characteristic Raman peak of rutile type TiO2.29 In the Raman spectra of our samples, the Eg and A1g modes, as well as the second-order effect at ∼237 cm−1, are the major features; the B1g and B2g modes are extremely weak or absent. With conversion from TNRs to TNFs, the wavenumber of all peaks decreased relevantly; in particular, the Eg (612 cm−1) mode shifted by about 6 cm−1, while the intensity of second order Eg mode (∼237 cm−1) is drastically increased.

The second order Eg at 237 cm−1, a characteristic of rutile TiO2, is more intense and slightly broader and shifted with respect to that of a TNR sample. This nature is due to the phonon confinement effect in which the decrease in the particle dimensions to the nanometre scale can cause a wave number blue shift and broadening of Raman peaks.30 The non-linear behavior of the Eg peak intensity suggests strong light scattering differences among samples, potentially related to changes on the morphological properties of the TNR and TNF.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a facile way for synthesis of novel TiO2 nanoflowers (TNF) using ecofriendly [CMIM][HSO4] RTIL by single step hydrothermal process. The addition of [CMIM][HSO4] ionic liquid to the synthesis of rutile TiO2 results in a favourable route to form a 1D nanostructure, in particular, nanoflowers. Furthermore, [CMIM][HSO4] helped to achieve a high degree of crystallization even at mild annealing temperatures, such as 180 °C. These TNF may be useful for basic studies on size-and shape-dependent properties of TiO2. This method will open up a new approach to develop hierarchical functional nanomaterials such as TiO2 using ionic liquid. There are hardly any reports on the preparation of small size (∼60 nm), well oriented, highly crystalline TiO2 nanoflowers (TNF) using room temperature ionic liquids. It is envisaged that such a simple and mild route could also be extended to prepare other hierarchical nanostructured metal oxides like ZnO, SnO2, and WO3etc. with small size nanostructures. The hierarchical, highly crystalline and oriented nanostructures thus promise potential applications for improving the DSSC photoconversion efficiency by increased light harvesting, better dye contact and decreased carrier recombination. Further studies are being carried out to confirm the advantages.
