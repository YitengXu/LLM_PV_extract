    , Accepted 7th March 2011First published on 1st April 2011AbstractDeveloping new acceptor materials as alternatives to fullerene acceptors remains a challenge in the field of organic photovoltaics. We report on the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of three acceptor polymers bearing diketopyrrolopyrrole units in the main chain (PA, PB and PC). Their performance as the acceptor material in bulk heterojunction solar cells using P3HT as the donor material has been tested. The solar cells show relatively high open-circuit voltages (≥0.9 V) but low fill factors and short-circuit current densities limit the photovoltaic device performance. Formation of free charge carriers and low electron mobility are identified as the major obstacles. In blends of P3HT with PA or PB charge formation is limited, while for the P3HT:PC blend photogenerated charges recombine into the PC triplet state before they can separate, unless assisted by a reverse electric field.
Introduction
In the last decade, materials research in the field of polymer solar cells has mainly focused on developing new electron donor polymers.1–6 The highest published efficiency has reached 7.4% for blends of a conjugated polymer as the electron donor with a fullerene derivative ([6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) as the electron acceptor.7,8 In these systems, the light is mainly absorbed by the polymer and less by the fullerene. A promising alternative for organic solar cells would then be to use a blend of two π-conjugated polymers that both contribute significantly to the absorption of light. In such a blend the optical properties of the two materials can be tuned in order to absorb complementary parts of the solar spectrum and efficiently collect photons. While this idea has existed from the start of polymer solar cell research, progress in terms of efficiency has been limited.9–11
Organic and polymer solar cells operate by creating excitons after absorbing a photon in one of the materials. These excitons have to dissociate at the interface between the electron donor and acceptor materials to form charges. The free energy for exciton dissociation is given by the difference in exciton energy, or optical gap (Eg) and the energy of the charge transfer (CT) state at the interface (ECT). These energies are related to the HOMO and LUMO levels of the two semiconductors and it has been established experimentally that—as a rule of thumb—the offset of the energies of the two HOMO and the two LUMO levels should both be at least ∼0.35 eV to ensure electron transfer from donor to acceptor (Fig. 1).12–14 The formation of the charge separated state is—in first approximation—independent of whether the donor or acceptor is in the excited state.
 Fig. 1  (a) Orbital energy level diagram and (b) corresponding state diagram for the donor and acceptor energy levels in an organic solar cell. The diagram pertains to the P3HT:PC blend, but analogous diagrams apply for P3HT:PA and P3HT:PB as well. 
In this work we consider poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor. P3HT is known as an efficient p-type polymer15,16 that has a LUMO level at −3.14 eV and a HOMO level at −5.05 eV.17
The complementary acceptor polymer should therefore have its LUMO level below −3.5 eV and its HOMO level below −5.4 eV to create the offsets of >0.35 eV with the corresponding levels of P3HT that ensure efficient charge formation. In addition to energy level requirements, a successful acceptor polymer should also have good electron mobility. In recent years, a number of polymers based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units have been presented that have low LUMO energy levels, high extinction coefficients and high electron mobilities in field-effect transistors.18–20 It is thus of interest to explore these DPP-based polymers for use as acceptor material in polymer:polymer blends for solar cells.
In this paper we describe the synthesis of three DPP-based polymers and their acceptor properties (Scheme 1). The new polymers were tested in bulk-heterojunctions with P3HT. Their electron mobility was measured and the photophysical and morphological properties of the photoactive layers have been investigated in detail. To rationalize the results and device performance, we focus on the role and influence of the interfacial charge transfer state.

Results and discussion
Synthesis

Scheme 1 describes the synthesis of polymers PA, PB and PC. The polymerization involves a Suzuki cross coupling using a mixture of Pd and PPh3 as catalyst, aqueous K2CO3 as base and aliquat 336 as the phase transfer agent in toluene. All polymers were obtained in ∼60% yield. For PA and PB, 3,6-bis(4-bromophenyl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-di(2′-hexyldecyl) pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione was polymerized with commercially available 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole or 2,5-bis[4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yle]thiophene. For PC, 3,6-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-di(2′-butyloctyl)pyrrolo [3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione was reacted with 2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9-dioctylfluorene.20 The molecular weights (Mn) of PA, PB and PC are roughly in the same range: 16.6, 11.8 and 10.5 kg mol−1 respectively.
Opto-electrical properties
The optical absorption spectra of the polymers dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and in thin films are shown in Fig. 2 together with cyclic voltammograms that were recorded for polymers in o-DCB. The results are collected in Table 1. The optical gap in solution—defined as the onset of absorption—decreases from PA, via PB to PC (2.1, 2.0 and 1.75 eV respectively). The oxidation potential follows the same trend (0.5, 0.4 and 0.22 V vs.Fc/Fc+). The reduction potential is the same for PA and PB (−1.7 V vs.Fc/Fc+) and more positive for PC (−1.55 V vs.Fc/Fc+), indicating a stronger acceptor character in PC.

The optical HOMO and LUMO energy levels versus vacuum as well as the energy of the charge transfer state (ECT) are given in Table 1. They were determined from Eox and Ered relative to the work function value of −5.23 eV for Fc/Fc+21–23 and assuming that the energy difference e(Eox − Ered) − Eg (with e the elementary charge) can be equally divided over the HOMO and the LUMO levels as explained in ref. 17. This results in the following definitions for EOPTHOMO and EOPTLUMO and an empirical relation for ECT (see also Fig. 1):17 EOPTHOMO = −5.23 eV − eEox + ½(Esolcv − Eg)(1) EOPTLUMO = −5.23 eV − eEred − ½(Esolcv − Eg)(2) ECT = |EOPTHOMO(D) − EOPTLUMO(A)| + 0.29 eV(3)In (1) and (2)Esolcv is defined as Esolcv = e(Eox − Ered). In this approach |EOPTHOMO − EOPTLUMO| is equal to the optical gap Eg in the film and hence these optical HOMO and LUMO levels incorporate the intramolecular exciton binding energy in the solid state. Each of the three polymers fulfils the requirement described in the introduction to be used as an acceptor material with respect to P3HT. The EOPTLUMO and EOPTHOMO are below −3.5 eV and −5.4 eV respectively. Furthermore, for each combination Eg* – ECT ≥ 0.08 (±0.02) eV (Eg* being the lowest of the two optical gaps: Eg* = min[Eg(D),Eg(A)]) which has previously been established as a criterion for photoinduced electron transfer to occur.17
Mobility measurements
In determining the electron mobilities it is important to measure under conditions that are close to the solar cell operation. Therefore, we applied the materials as a thin layer in an electron-only device between a ITO/ZnO hole blocking bottom electrode and a Ca/Al electron injecting top electrode. In the ESI† we have collected the experimental dark current densities of these electron-only devices. The applied voltage (Vappl) was corrected for the built-in voltage (Vbi) that arises from the difference in work-function between the two electrodes and for the voltage drop (Vrs) due to substrate series' resistance by setting V = Vappl − Vbi − Vrs. The experimental current densities scale quadratically with V, characteristic of space charge limited transport through the layer and the zero-field mobility μe of the electrons was determined by a fit of the data to the equation for space charge limited current (SCLC):24 (4)where Je is the electron current density, γe the field activation factor, ε0 the permittivity of free space, εr the relative permittivity of the material and L the thickness of the active layer.

Polymer PC exhibits an electron mobility of μe = 5 × 10−10 m2 V−1 s−1, which is one order of magnitude higher than the electron mobilities of PA and PB (μe = 3 × 10−11 and μe = 1 × 10−11 m2 V−1 s−1 respectively). Upon blending the acceptor polymers with P3HT, the electron mobility changes only slightly to μe = 2 × 10−11, 1 × 10−11 and 9 × 10−10 m2 V−1 s−1 for the P3HT:PA, P3HT:PB and P3HT:PC blends, respectively.
Photovoltaic devices
The polymers were applied in bulk heterojunction solar cells with P3HT as the donor material. The active layers were spin-coated from CHCl3∶o-DCB (9∶1) onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass substrate covered by a 50 nm film of PEDOT:PSS. Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally evaporated as the top electrode. For each polymer the ratio with P3HT and layer thickness were optimized for maximal performance. Annealing at 120 °C was needed to improve the performance of the devices. The representative J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements are shown in Fig. 3. The performance and characteristics of the best devices are summarized in Table 2.

Devices made of blends of P3HT:PA, P3HT:PB and P3HT:PC exhibit very similar open-circuit voltages (0.94, 0.90 and 0.90 V, respectively) and comparable fill factors (0.22, 0.27 and 0.25, respectively). The short-circuit densities differ. P3HT:PA and P3HT:PB offer a very limited Jsc of 0.68 and 0.44 mA cm−2 respectively. For P3HT:PC, the short-circuit current is much higher and reaches a value of 1.63 mA cm−2. The overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) for P3HT:PA, P3HT:PB and P3HT:PC is 0.14%, 0.11% and 0.36%, respectively. The short-circuit current densities were calculated by convoluting the EQE with the solar AM 1.5G spectrum.

Atomic force microscopy

A key parameter for power conversion efficiency in solar cells is the morphology of the active layer. A nanoscale phase separation in the BHJ of ∼10–20 nm is desirable to ensure the diffusion of the exciton to the interface where charge generation takes place.25,26 On the other hand larger domains and percolating pathways will favour and improve separating the formed charges from the interface and transporting them to the electrodes. It is thus important to find a good balance and make sure that the morphology of the active layer does not limit the performance. To assess the morphology, the thermally annealed layers used in the devices have been studied with AFM. As shown in Fig. 4 the films are relatively smooth (5–15 nm) and the phase image presents bright and dark regions that can be associated with two different (not necessarily pure) materials, phase segregated at the surface. The smallest features that can be discerned in the phase images are on the order of ten nanometres, which would indicate relatively intimate mixing. If the mixing is too intimate, the reduced domain size could account for the reduced device performance.

Photoluminescence quenching
The extent of the interaction between the two materials on a nanoscale has been investigated by measuring the fluorescence quenching in a blend of P3HT with 50% of acceptor polymer after annealing. As shown in Fig. 5, the experiment reveals that the fluorescence in the blends is quenched by approximately one order of magnitude compared to the pristine polymers. Fig. 5 also shows that the fluorescence intensity of pristine PC is less than that of PA and PB. For PA and PB the optical gap is higher than that of P3HT and hence the fluorescence quenching can be due to energy or electron transfer. PC, however, has a lower optical gap than P3HT and in this case quenching cannot be due to energy transfer. The spectrum of the P3HT:PC blend also shows some fluorescence of P3HT as a shoulder at ∼630 nm which is due to direct excitation of P3HT. For all three blends the significant quenching of the fluorescence is consistent with the surface topography of the active layer as inferred from the AFM phase images where relatively small domains were observed. The remaining fluorescence can be ascribed to larger domains of pure polymer or to the rate of the quenching process being similar to the fluorescence rate constant.

Photoinduced absorption
Photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectroscopy has been carried out in order to investigate the charge transfer and to probe the charge formation and recombination in these blends. Upon photoexcitation of the blend, P3HT is expected to transfer an electron to the acceptor polymer and—provided that the charge separated state has a significantly long lifetime—it can be detected with PIA spectroscopy. Fig. 6a shows the PIA spectrum of pristine P3HT. The Tn ← T1 absorption of the pure P3HT triplet state is at 1.06 eV and bleaching signals are at 1.97 and 2.13 eV.17,27 A weak PIA signal is also observed at ∼0.5 eV that is characteristic for the low-energy excitation of P3HT radical cations. This highlights that only very few long lived charges are formed in pure P3HT after photoexcitation.

The PIA spectra of PA and the P3HT:PA blend are shown in Fig. 6b, together with the signal of pure P3HT. The PIA spectrum of PA shows a bleaching signal at 2.25 eV and two bands at 1.28 and 1.64 eV, which we attribute to the Tn ← T1 transitions of PA. The PIA spectrum of the P3HT:PA blend is a superposition of the PIA signals of P3HT and PA. In the blends also the bleaching signals of both P3HT and PA are present. Similar results can be observed for PB (Tn ← T1 at 1.36 eV with shoulders at higher energies) and the P3HT:PB blend (Fig. 6c). We note that the intensity of the PIA bands does not change drastically upon blending and that in both P3HT:PA and P3HT:PB blends no significant signal is observed at ∼0.5 eV, indicating that no long lived charges are present after photoexcitation. Hence, PIA does not give evidence of photoinduced electron transfer from P3HT to either PA or PB and the luminescence quenching observed in the blends of either P3HT:PA or P3HT:PB is therefore most likely due to energy transfer from PA and PB to the weakly luminescent P3HT. The fact that the triplet signatures of both P3HT and PA or PB are observed in the blends is likely a consequence of triplet energy pooling and suggests that the triplet states of P3HT, PA and PB are almost isoenergetic. This is consistent with the result that the optical gaps (S1 energies) of P3HT, PA and PB are similar and the fact that the T1 energy (ET) of conjugated polymers is often found about 0.7 eV below that of S1.28 The absence of clear signals due to charges can be rationalized in two ways. First, by considering that the energies of the charge transfer states (ECT, Table 1) of P3HT:PA and P3HT:PB at 1.73 and 1.76 eV, respectively, are close to the optical gap of P3HT at 1.91 eV, such that electron transfer from the P3HT S1 state is only weakly exergonic and does not occur to a significant extent. Second, by realizing that charges formed at the interface do not separate and can effectively recombine into the triplet states of either P3HT, PA or PB at the interface because the T1 energy is estimated as ET = Eg – 0.7 eV is well below the expected energy of the charge transfer state (ECT, Table 1). Fig. 6d shows the PIA spectra of PC, P3HT and the P3HT:PC blend. The PIA spectrum of PC shows a very weak PIA signal. Because the fluorescence signal of PC also has a low intensity (cf.Fig. 5 where the fluorescence of PC is a factor of ∼10 less compared to PA and PB), the low PIA signal is likely a consequence of rapid internal conversion of the S1 state of PC that effectively reduces the fluorescence and intersystem crossing quantum yields. The PIA spectrum of the P3HT:PC blend is different from that of pristine PC and pristine P3HT. The main bleaching signal peaks at 1.79 eV and crosses zero at 1.72 eV. This position corresponds to the optical gap of PC, which suggests that the PIA spectrum predominantly originates from PC. The shape of the PIA band of the P3HT:PC blend between 1.30 and 1.65 eV actually resembles the Tn ← T1PIA spectra of pure PA and PB in the same region. Based on these considerations we attribute the PIA signal of the P3HT:PC blend to the Tn ← T1 transition of PC. This triplet state is then formed from the interfacial P3HT+–PC− charge transfer state via recombination. This assignment is consistent with the estimated T1 energy of PC which is at about Eg − 0.7 eV = 1.02 eV28 and much less than the expected ECT = 1.65 eV for this blend (Table 1). The weak PIA signal present at ∼0.5 eV indicates the presence of some long-lived free charges.
Field-dependent photocurrent
The device performance is in each blend limited by a low short-circuit current and low fill factor. The inefficient generation of long-lived free charges as inferred from the PIA experiments accounts for this result but the collection and possibly formation of free charge carriers may be assisted by an electric field. Fig. 7a shows the photocurrent, Jph, recorded for the three blends on a double logarithmic scale as a function of the effective voltage, V0 − V, applied to the device where V0 is the compensation voltage corresponding to Jph = 0. The results for the three blends are compared to that for a well performing solar cell using P3HT:[60]PCBM as the active layer.29 At small effective voltages (V0 − V) < 0.1 V the photocurrent of the P3HT:[60]PCBM cell increases linearly with the effective voltage, Jph ∝ (V0 − V), because at higher electric fields the distance the charges travel increases and more charges can be collected. At higher effective voltages (V0 − V > 0.1 V), where the field becomes large enough such that the mean carrier drift length (μe,hτe,hE, with τ the lifetime and E the field) exceeds the layer thickness, the photocurrent quickly saturates as the number of free carriers is limited by the amount of photons absorbed. For the blends with the DPP acceptor polymers under study here the behaviour is different. For P3HT:PA and P3HT:PB the photocurrent increases with the square root of the voltage (Jph ∝ (V0 − V)½). This behaviour has been observed before in organic solar cells30,31 and has its origin in the fact that the mean drift length of at least one carrier is less than the thickness of the layer such that recombination of charge carriers is significant.32 The electron mobilities of μe = ∼10−11 m2 V−1 s−1 measured for PA and PB are three orders of magnitude below the value of μh = 2 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1 for pristine P3HT.29 Under such conditions, where μh exceeds μe by three orders of magnitude, a built-up of electrons can occur under illumination.30 This then creates a non-uniform electric field that enhances the extraction of electrons close to the negative electrode and reduces the extraction of holes at the positive electrode and gives rise to a square root dependent photocurrent on the effective voltage. For P3HT:PA and P3HT:PB there is a small sub-linearity of the short-circuit current with light intensity (Jsc ∝ Iα, with I the light intensity and α ≈ 0.89, Fig. 7b) which shows that the photocurrent is not yet space charge limited, for which α = 0.75 would have been expected.30 For PC, which has a higher electron mobility (μe = 5 × 10−10 m2 V−1 s−1), Jph is again linear with (V0 − V), suggesting that the difference in mobility is not large enough to create substantial space charge. However, the effective voltage in the P3HT:PC blend required to reach a photocurrent of ∼7 mA cm−2 is 4 V compared to 0.2 V for the P3HT:PCBM blend and saturation has not yet occurred.

Conclusions
Three diketopyrrolopyrrole-based polymers have been synthesized. They have been combined with P3HT as the donor material in bulk heterojunction solar cells. The photovoltaic devices exhibit open-circuit voltages of 0.9 V but low short-circuit current densities and fill factors that limit the efficiency between 0.1 and 0.36%. For P3HT:PA and P3HT:PB PIA spectroscopy gives no evidence for charge transfer, consistent with the small short-circuit current density (0.68 and 0.44 mA cm−2 respectively). For P3HT:PC a higher short-circuit current (1.63 mA cm−2) was obtained. PIA measurements indicated formation of free charges in the P3HT:PC blend that recombine to the triplet state. By applying a reverse electric field, charge recombination in P3HT:PC can be prevented and the photocurrent increases considerably under these conditions. We conclude that the low electron mobility of the acceptor materials combined with an inefficient generation of long-lived free charge carriers are the main reasons for the limited device performance.
Further improvements of acceptor polymers can possibly be made by focusing on the design of materials with high electron mobility in blends with P3HT.
Experimental section
General procedures

          Polymerization reactions were conducted under an argon atmosphere. Commercial chemicals were used as received. 2,5-bis[4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yle]thiophene and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The P3HT used in this study had Mn = 30 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity of 2.1 and regioregularity higher than 98.5%. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz on a VARIAN mercury spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The peaks are given in ppm, relative to TMS (0 ppm). Molecular weights were determined with GPC on a Shimadzu LC-10AD using a Polymer Laboratories Resipore column (length 300 mm, diameter 7.5 mm), a Shimadzu SPD-M20A photodiode array detector from 250–700 nm and chloroform as the eluent with a flow rate of 1 mg min−1. (T = 293 K). Polystyrene standards were used.

UV-vis-near IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted under an inert atmosphere with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1, using 1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in o-DCB as the electrolyte. The working electrode was a platinum disk and the counter electrode was a silver rod electrode. Fc/Fc+ was used as an internal standard. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was measured using a Veeco MultiMode with a Nanoscope III controller, in the tapping mode. The probes used were PPP-NCH-50 from Nanosensors.
Photovoltaic devices were made by spin coating poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios P, VP Al4083) onto pre-cleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (14 Ω per square) (Naranjo Substrates). The counter electrode, consisting of LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm), was deposited by vacuum evaporation at ∼3 × 10−7 mbar. The active area of the cells was 0.091 cm2. J–V characteristics were measured under ∼100 mW cm−2 white light from a tungsten–halogen lamp filtered by a Schott GG385 UV filter and a Hoya LB120 daylight filter, using a Keithley 2400 source meter. Short-circuit currents under AM1.5G conditions were estimated from the spectral response and convolution with the solar spectrum. The spectral response was measured under simulated 1 sun operation conditions using bias light from a 532 nm solid state laser (Edmund Optics). Monochromatic light from a 50 W tungsten halogen lamp (Philips focusline) in combination with a monochromator (Oriel, Cornerstone 130) was modulated with a mechanical chopper. The response was recorded as the voltage over a 50 Ω resistance, using a lock-in amplifier (Stanford research Systems SR830). A calibrated Si cell was used as reference. The device was kept behind a quartz window in a nitrogen filled container. The thickness of the active layers in the photovoltaic devices was measured on a Veeco Dektak150 profilometer.
Photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectra were recorded by exciting with a mechanically modulated Ar-ion (496.5 nm) pump beam and monitoring the resulting change in transmission of a tungsten–halogen probe light through the sample (ΔT) with a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier after dispersion by a grating monochromator and detection, using Si, InGaAs and cooled InSb detectors. The pump power incident on the sample was typically 50 mW with a beam diameter of 2 mm. The PIA (ΔT/T) was corrected for the photoluminescence, which was recorded in a separate experiment. Photoinduced absorption spectra and photoluminescence spectra were recorded with the pump beam in a direction almost parallel to the direction of the probe beam. Temperature of the substrates was controlled by using an Oxford Optistat continuous flow cryostat.

Polymer PA
