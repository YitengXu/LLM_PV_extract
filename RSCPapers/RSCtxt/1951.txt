    , Accepted 5th August 2021First published on 6th August 2021AbstractCarbon dots (Cdots) are emerging as an eco-friendly alternative luminophore for luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) due to their environmental and economic friendliness, and simple synthesis using abundant carbon-based sources. However, their limited absorption and low photoluminescence (PL) hinder their large-scale applications in LSCs. In this work, we utilize plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs) to improve the optical absorption and emission of Cdots for enhancing the performance of LSCs. Due to their localized surface plasmon resonance peaks matching with the optical features of Cdots, silver (Ag) NPs with an average size of 40 nm (Ag40) were chosen. Silica shells with an optimized thickness were deposited on the surface of Ag NPs to prevent energy transfer from Cdots to the plasmonic NPs. Exploiting the ease of fabrication of liquid LSCs, a parametric study of the influence of Ag NPs on the LSC performance was conducted. Based on these results, thin film Cdot-based LSCs with optimized addition of Ag40@SiO2 were then fabricated, exhibiting an improvement of +25% in optical efficiency (OE) compared to the control devices. In summary, the intriguing plasmonic effect of Ag NPs/Cdot-based LSCs reported here can provide a useful platform for future studies on plasmon-enhanced LSCs.
Introduction
Among various emerging solar technologies, luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are considered as promising transparent windows that use small area solar cells towards building integrated photovoltaics.1,2 Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have shown great potential as chromophores in LSCs due to their tunable optical properties, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and relatively large Stokes shift.3–7 However, the high toxicity of traditional semiconductor QDs containing heavy metal elements greatly limits their potential commercialization in LSCs. As an alternative, eco-friendly metal-free quantum sized materials, such as silicon dots and carbon dots (Cdots) have been explored for application in LSCs due to their cost-effectiveness and tunable optical properties.8–10 In particular, compared to QDs (such as PbS and CdSe), Cdots contain exclusively non-toxic elements (C, O, H and N) and can be synthesized in large quantities at low cost.11 However, so far, the use of Cdots in LSCs has been limited by their unsatisfactory absorption ability and low quantum emission.
Coupling nanostructured plasmonic metal NPs (i.e. Au and Ag) with QDs has been shown to be an effective way to enhance the light excitation and photoluminescence of QDs in various optoelectronic devices.12–15 When light interacts with the surface of metal NPs, it excites collective surface charge oscillations known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).16–18 The created localized “hotspots” enhance the excitation rate of QDs in the vicinity of metal NPs to effectively absorb more light, resulting in plasmon-enhanced emission of QDs.14,19,20 Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as Au and Ag, are the most studied plasmonic materials for a wide range of applications, such as photovoltaics,21,22 light-emitting diodes12 and photocatalysis23 due to their excellent light trapping ability, strong resonance effect,17,24 good chemical inertness and the wide spectral tunability of their LSPR.25 Of all the plasmonic materials, Ag produces the strongest plasmon resonance at visible frequencies,26 making it one of the most promising systems for plasmonic technologies. Up to now, few studies have investigated the possibility of exploiting the LSPR of metal NPs to enhance the optical properties of QDs and practical examples of LSCs exploiting this possibility are very rare.27–30 Specifically, LSCs based on plasmonic NPs and organic dyes have been reported,31 while the optical efficiency of QD-based plasmonic LSC devices has never been measured in the practical application, and thin film based plasmonic LSCs embedding QDs have not been realized up to now. This strategy has not yet been used in QD-based thin film LSCs due to the difficulty in realizing a good coupling between the QDs and metal NPs while maintaining the solvent-compatibility for integration in LSC polymer waveguides.
Considering the advantages of Cdots over semiconducting QDs and organic dyes, such as the ease of synthesis, the low-cost and abundant carbon sources, it is of great interest to explore the coupling of Ag NPs and Cdots to enhance their optical features (i.e. absorption and emission) for improving the efficiency of semi-transparent LSCs.
In this work, we combined plasmonic Ag NPs with Cdots, aiming to enhance absorption in the visible range and the photoluminescence of the fluorophores. A thin-film based LSC is then realized and its performance measured. The results obtained suggest that the presence of plasmonic Ag NPs improves the overall performance. 40 nm Ag NPs (Ag40) were selected since their LSPR peaks matched the absorption peaks of the prepared Cdots. To prevent charge transfer between the two materials and protect metal NPs from the possible interference for an increased suspension stability, a silica shell with an optimized thickness (∼10 nm) was coated on the surface of Ag NPs.32 To better understand the origin of the enhanced photoluminescence of Cdots and the role of scattering effects due to the size of the NPs, we also used similarly sized non-plasmonic SiO2 and Ag NPs (∼100 nm). The scattering effect in fact could also increase the probability of increasing the light harvesting and absorption in LSCs; however it increases the opacity of the LSC, reducing its transparency.33 By optimizing the concentration of Ag NPs and Cdots in solvent, the light absorption and emission of Cdots improve due to the field enhancement in the proximity of Ag NPs. The optimized plasmon-enhanced absorption and photoluminescent Cdots/Ag NP composites were incorporated in liquid and thin film semi-transparent LSCs. The optical evaluation shows that LSCs with Ag NPs combined with Cdots exhibited an optical efficiency ∼25% higher than that of bare Cdot-based LSCs. The improved optical efficiency is attributed to the introduced LSPR on the surface of Ag NPs to improve the light absorption and emission of Cdots. The study of plasmon-enhanced optical properties of Cdots by coupling plasmonic metal NPs could provide useful information to optimize eco-friendly and efficient luminophores for transparent LSCs.
Experimental
Synthesis of materials

Cdots. 
The Cdots were synthesized by following procedures reported in the literature.34 Typically, 2 g urea and 1 g citric acid were dissolved in 10 ml dimethylformamide (DMF), and the solution was transferred into a stainless-steel autoclave with a Teflon liner and reacted at 160 °C for 6 h. The obtained mixture was purified by using a large amount of acetone to precipitate the Cdots. After purification, the product was stored for further use.


40 nm Ag (Ag40) and 100 nm Ag (Ag100). 
Ag40 and Ag100 were synthesized by modifying a method previously reported.35 Typically, to synthesize Ag40, 3.0 g PVP (Mw = 10000) and 0.4 g AgNO3 were dissolved in 20 ml ethylene glycol at room temperature. Then, the mixture was heated up to 120 °C at a rate of 1 °C min−1 under continuous stirring. After 2 h reaction at 120 °C, dark brown colloidal Ag40 NPs were obtained. The obtained NPs were purified by using ethanol and distilled water 3 times, respectively, and then stored in ethanol for further use. For the synthesis of Ag100, 3.0 g PVP (Mw = 55000) and 0.6 g AgNO3 were dissolved in 20 ml ethylene glycol at room temperature. After heating up to 160 °C, the mixture was maintained at 160 °C for 1 h under continuous stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained milky yellow Ag100 was precipitated by using a large quantity of acetone, and washed with ethanol and distilled water 3 times, respectively, and the Ag100 NPs were obtained.


Silica shell on Ag NPs. 
1 ml Ag40 NPs with an absorption value of 2.1 at 415 nm was dissolved in 10 ml 2-propanol under continuous stirring, and maintained at 40 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, 2 ml distilled water and 1 ml ammonia (28–30 wt%) were added into the mixture. After the temperature was stabilized, 0.05 ml tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was injected into the solution and the reaction was kept for 2 h. The obtained mixture was purified with distilled water and ethanol 3 times, respectively. For overcoating Ag100 NPs, the amount of TEOS was changed to 0.03 ml.

Fabrication of LSCs
Liquid LSCs were fabricated to optimize the concentration of Cdots and Ag NPs. Cuboid quartz waveguides were purchased from Haoming Quartz Co., Ltd. China, with length (3 cm), width (2 cm) and inner height (0.2 cm). The synthesized nanoparticles were injected into the quartz mold using a syringe. For thin film based LSCs, the fabrication was carried out following our previous work.3 Typically, a certain amount of Cdots or Cdots with Ag40@SiO2 in ethanol solution were mixed with PVP powder (Mw = 55000) at a concentration of 200 mg ml−1. After ultrasound treatment, a homogeneous solution was obtained, and then spin-coated on the surface of a glass substrate (5 cm × 5 cm×0.2 cm) at a speed of 500 rpm for 2 min. The thin film on the glass is with a thickness of 50–100 μm.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to reveal the morphology of the samples (JEOL 2100F). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a Panalytical X-Pert PRO MRD operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with a Ni-filtered Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.541 Å) source. XRD spectra were recorded in the 2θ range of 15–80°. Absorption spectra were acquired on a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra in solvent were recorded with a PerkinElmer fluorescence spectrometer (LS45), and thin film PL spectra were obtained on a Horiba Jobin Yvon fluorescence spectrometer. The PL lifetime of the QDs in solution or the polymer was measured using a pulsed laser diode of 375 nm and fast multichannel scaler mode (fast MCS) on a Fluorolog-3 system (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The concentrations of Ag based materials were measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Agilent Technology, 5100).
Optical evaluation of LSCs
An ABET2000 solar simulator at AM 1.5G for providing the incident light with a power density of 100 mWcm−2 was used to test the optical efficiency of the fabricated LSCs. Commercial mirrors were pressed on the edge and bottom of a LSC for light reflection. Also a Si PV cell (module KXOB22 from IXYS) was laterally coupled to one edge side of the LSC, just as shown in Scheme 1. The current–voltage curves of the PV cell were obtained by using a Keysight 2900A SourceMeter when the LSC was under simulated solar light.

Results and discussion
Cdots were synthesized following a previously reported hydrothermal synthesis procedure,34 while water soluble Ag NPs were prepared by heating ethylene glycol and AgNO3 with polyvinylpyrrolidone.35 The detailed experimental procedures are described in the Experimental section. Since the surface passivation of Cdots can interfere with plasmonic NPs by quenching the emission, to avoid any possible negative effect, in this study we did not modify the surface of the Cdots and used the original bare Cdots as fluorophores. TEM images show that the average size of the as-prepared Cdots is 3.3 ± 0.7 nm (Fig. 1a and S1a†), while the Ag NPs have an average size of 42 ± 4 nm (Fig. 1b). For effective absorption and photoluminescence enhancement of QDs by LSPR, it is necessary to keep the plasmonic metal and QDs at a suitable distance.20,36 If the two materials are too close to each other, the metal NPs would act as charge acceptors leading to charge transfer from QDs to metal NPs, resulting in photoluminescence quenching of QDs. On the other hand, if the metal NPs and QD are too far from each other, there would be a weak or even no interaction between them. A suitable distance between the metal NPs and QDs has been reported to be 11–16 nm.32,37 In our work, a silica shell with a thickness of 11 ± 2 nm was coated on the surface of Ag to prevent charge transfer between Ag NPs and Cdots, as shown in Fig. 1c. We physically mixed Cdots and Ag@SiO2 in ethanol for further structural and optical characterization. Due to the small size of Cdots with respect to Ag and their low contrast, visualizing Cdots by TEM in the presence of Ag is very challenging.38 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Cdots without/with Ag40@SiO2, as shown in Fig. 1d, exhibited a common pattern of Ag NPs, as well as broad diffraction peaks at around 23° and 25°, which correspond to the graphitic structure with interlayer spacing (002) and amorphous silica, respectively.39,40Fig. 1e and f show the optical measurements of the samples. The surface plasmon resonance of Ag NPs is localized at 415 nm, while the peak slightly redshifts to 425 nm when the Ag NPs are coated with silica, in agreement with the theoretical results (Fig. S2†). According to Mie's theory, small sized plasmonic Ag particles (diameter < 50 nm) exhibit strong light absorption resulting from the dominant excitation of plasmon resonances, while the scattering effect becomes the major contributor when the particle size approaches the wavelength of visible light (Fig. S2†).41 In addition, the silica spheres alone have also been shown to be effective in confining light propagation and extend the light traveling distance within LSC waveguides due to the scattering effect.42
 Fig. 1  TEM images of the as-synthesized materials: (a) Cdots (size bar: 10 nm), (b) Ag40 nanoparticles (size bar: 50 nm), and (c) Ag40@SiO2 (size bar: 100 nm), (d) XRD of the as-prepared samples, (e) absorption spectra of the as-prepared samples and (f) absorption, PL excitation and emission spectra of Cdots; the dashed lines correspond to the absorption spectra of Cdots and Ag40@SiO2. 
Here, to assess the contribution of the scattering effect, we synthesized SiO2 NPs and large Ag NPs (Ag100) (diameter sizes of 102 ± 9 nm and 107 ± 12 nm (Fig. S3†), respectively). The absorption spectrum of Ag100 exhibits a broad peak (Fig. 1e, purple line), which is attributed to its relatively large size distribution. The optical characterization results of Cdots are shown in Fig. 1f and S1b.† The strong absorption band of Cdots at around 340 nm can be attributed to the n–π* transition of conjugated CO and CN.43 The PL excitation (PLE) spectra of emission at 440 nm show a maximum around 340 nm, close to the absorption band, while a maximum PL emission peak appeared at 520 nm when excited at 420 nm, which is close to the position of another absorption peak of Cdots and to the plasmonic excitation peak of Ag40@SiO2. The emission of the as-prepared Cdots exhibits excitation wavelength dependence, where the emission peaks shift to longer wavelengths with increasing excitation wavelength (Fig. S1b†). For this reason, instead of simply evaluating the Stokes shift (the difference of the maxima of the absorption and emission spectra), in the optical evaluation of the LSC, the overlap of absorption and emission spectra of Cdots will be considered.44
To achieve plasmon resonance enhanced absorption and emission, the excitation band of Ag NPs should match the absorption peak of the Cdots. In this case, the reabsorption effect introduced by metal NPs is unavoidable due to the overlap of the absorption band of Ag NPs and emission spectra of Cdots excited at 340 nm. However, unlike the reabsorption energy loss in Cdots, the reabsorption effect caused by Ag NPs could be beneficial, generating more LSPR on the metal surface to improve the light absorption and emission of Cdots. To optimize the absorption and emission of the Cdots, before integrating the composite in the LSC, we carried out a systematic study in which the Cdot concentration was fixed at a certain value (0.1 mg ml−1), while the concentration of Ag was varied (from 0 to up to 2.4 × 10−5 M). Fig. 2 shows the relative changes of PL excitation (PLE) and PL emission properties of Cdots (0.1 mg ml−1 in ethanol) in the presence of Ag or Ag@SiO2 at different concentrations. Compared to Cdots with Ag40, an obvious improvement in both PLE and PL peak integrals of Cdots with Ag40@ SiO2 is observed (Fig. 2a, c and S4†), which indicates that the SiO2 shell effectively acts as a “spacer” to avoid the direct interaction of Cdots and Ag40, as well as the quenching of the Cdot emission. In particular, a maximum improvement of +30% and +26% for PLE and PL, respectively, is obtained for an approximate concentration of Ag of 9.6 × 10−6 M. When excess Ag NPs are added, the improvement decreased probably due to reabsorption effects. Such an improvement only occurs in PLE of emission at 440 nm and emission excited at 340 nm (Fig. S4†), further proving the significance of spectral matching. The decrease of excitation and emission of Cdots with Ag40 and without the SiO2 shell can be attributed to the energy loss by charge transfer due to the proximity of Cdots and Ag40, or the inefficient LSPR effect on Cdots, resulting from the large distance between Cdots and Ag40.

PLE0 is the PL excitation peak integrals of bare Cdots and PLE is the PL excitation integrals of Cdots with plasmonic NPs; PL0 is the emission peak integrals of bare Cdots and PL is the emission integrals of Cdots with plasmonic NPs. 
The scattering effect can also play a role in enhancing light capture and propagation, which could lead to the indirect improvement of QD PL.33 Considering that the scattering ability of Ag NPs increases with the size, we tested large Ag100 with an average size of 107 ± 12 nm. For this size, the scattering effect dominates over the extinction, as shown in Fig. 3d and S2b.† In general, the far-field scattering enhancement occurs when the scattering spectra of metal NPs overlap with the PL spectra of fluorophores (QDs). We have calculated both PLE and PL intensity integrals of Cdots in the presence of Ag100@SiO2 (Fig. 2d and S4†). The optical efficiency in this case exhibited an improvement of about 15%. Such a Cdot emission enhancement is probably due to the weak near-field plasmonic effect as there is a very low amount of plasmonic NPs. As mentioned before, based on Mie's theory, for large sized Ag NPs, the scattering spectrum dominates the extinction spectrum (see ESI, Fig. S2†). To obtain an effective scattering effect that has an impact on the optical efficiency, a high concentration of NPs is usually required. In our work, when the concentration of Ag100@SiO2 NPs increased above 5 × 10−6 M, PLE and PL started to increase again (Fig. 2d), which further proves that the scattering effect becomes the dominant factor. However, a high concentration of scattering NPs, when used in the fabrication of LSCs, will reduce the LSC transparency, just as illustrated in Fig. S6† and previous reports.33,45 In addition, the overlap of the scattering spectrum of Ag NPs and the emission spectrum of Cdots probably leads to a higher reabsorption effect. Overall, to avoid the possible reabsorption loss and maintain a high-transparency of the device, we chose Ag40@SiO2 for further investigation. In the presence of Ag100 without the SiO2 coating, quenching of the emission was observed, indicating that the scattering of Ag NPs is not the main effect that enhances the PLE and PL of Cdots (Fig. S4 and S5†).

Fig. 3a shows the PL decay curves of Cdots without/with 9.6 × 10−6 M Ag40@SiO2 to investigate the origin of the enhanced photoluminescence. By fitting the curves with two exponentials (Table S1†), the obtained average lifetimes of bare Cdots and Cdots in the presence of Ag40@SiO2 with an optimized concentration of 9.6 × 10−6 M are 9.62 ns and 9.92 ns, respectively. The almost unchanged lifetime further proves that Cdot PL quenching does not occur. In fact, the presence of the silica shell on the surface of Ag NPs avoids the direct energy transfer from Cdots to Ag NPs.30 In this case, the enhancement of Cdot PL originates from the increased excitation rate by LSPR in the vicinity of the plasmonic Ag NPs, which results in an enhanced excitation light intensity.

To test whether the presence of plasmonic or scattering NPs alone would have an effect on light propagation in LSC waveguides and thus alter the final efficiency of the device, we studied their individual contributions. As the preparation of LSC polymer waveguides requires a complicated polymerization process that can introduce possible defects and alter the properties of the luminophores, we carried out a parametric study of the scattering and plasmonic effect using liquid LSCs. In our previous work, we reported a liquid LSC that allows easy tuning of parameters such as the types and the concentrations of different luminophores.46 To this end, we started by injecting the plasmonic or scattering NPs into a quartz mold (illustrated in Fig. S1†) to fabricate liquid LSCs with a geometric factor of 15 (G = 15). The optical efficiency and geometric factor are calculated as follows:9,47    where Ilsc is the current of the solar cell mounted on the edge of the LSC and Isc is the current of the solar cell under direct simulated illumination. Atop is the top surface area of the LSC and Aedge is the surface area of the edges mounted on a solar cell. Other three edges are coupled with common commercial mirrors (obtaing the so-called mirrored configuration46). We also calculated the liquid LSC power conversion efficiency (PCE) as follows:48  where Jsc is the short-circuit current density of the solar cell mounted on the LSC and VOC is the open-circuit voltage of solar cell mounted on the LSC. In this case, for the calculation of the short-circuit current, the top surface area of the LSC is considered as the active area but not the area of the solar cell.
Since only one solar cell was used on one edge of the LSC, the value obtained for Jsc is multiplied by a factor of four. FF is the fill factor and P0 is the integrated solar power density (100 W m−2 nm−1 for AM 1.5G). The results are listed in Tables S4 and S5.†
The optical efficiencies were measured using a solar cell coupled to an edge, and the results are reported in Fig. 3b–f. The optical evaluation results of the waveguides without luminophores show that larger sized nanoparticles (Ag100, Ag100@SiO2 and SiO2) exhibit higher optical efficiencies. Specifically, SiO2 exhibits excellent scattering performance by confining the light and extending the light transfer distance in the quartz mold. However, the addition of SiO2 leads to a drastic drop of light transmittance (Fig. S6†), increasing the opacity of the LSC (Fig. S7†). Fig. S8† shows the transmittance spectra of Cdots with and without Ag40@SiO2 and SiO2 in quartz cells. The results show that the addition of an optimized amount of Ag40@SiO2 has no effect on the transparency of LSCs, maintaining a transmittance of 82% at 500 nm, very close to that of the bare Cdot-based LSC (84%). The use of SiO2 instead decreases the transmittance to only 70%. Such drastically drop in transmittance of the SiO2-based LSC is mainly attributed to the strong light scattering effect of SiO2, which could reduce the absorption effect of Cdots. A better alternative is to exploit the plasmonic effect by using small metal NPs to increase the absorption and emission of the luminophores in the LSC, maintaining a good transparency for the waveguide. To test this hypothesis, we investigated Cdots with optimized Ag40@SiO2 in LSC devices.

Fig. 4a and Table S2† show the results of the optical evaluation of the liquid LSC obtained by embedding Cdots with Ag40@SiO2 at different concentrations. When the Ag40@SiO2 concentration is increased, the optical efficiency also increases, reaching a maximum of η = 1.23% at 9.6 × 10−6 M Ag concentration, an increment of 17% compared to the sample without Ag NPs (η = 1.05%). By further increasing the concentration of Ag, the optical efficiency starts to drop, probably due to the increased reabsorption and light blocking effect of the Ag NPs. By using a liquid LSC, it is possible to rapidly identify the ideal concentration of Ag that optimizes the performance of the LSC: 9.6 × 10−6 M. Based on this data, thin film based LSCs were then fabricated by spin-coating a Cdots/Ag40@SiO2/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) mixture on glass substrates (5 × 5 × 0.2 cm3), as illustrated in Fig. 4b. Table S3† gives the optical efficiencies of thin film LSCs. The LSC with plasmonic NPs exhibits improved optical performance of more than 25% (ηmax = 0.90%), compared to the bare Cdot LSC (ηmax = 0.72%). This improvement is attributed to the enhanced absorption and emission of the LSC device due to the plasmonic effect of the Ag NPs. To our knowledge, plasmonic NPs have been practically applied in thin film based LSCs only in combination with organic dyes. As reported in Table S6,† the efficiencies obtained in this work with Cdots/Ag NPs are similar to those reported for dye-based devices. Compared to organic dyes, however, Cdots (and in general QDs) offer several advantages, including tunable and relatively large Stokes shift, high photostability and element-engineering for eco-friendly compositions. The lower performance of the thin film waveguide compared to that of the liquid LSC may be due to the excess energy loss from phase transfer to the solid state and the limited light propagation in the thin film waveguide.

Measuring the PL spectra in different optical paths is an effective way to evaluate the reabsorption effect. Fig. S10† shows that the PL emission peak of Cdots with the Ag@SiO2-based LSC exhibits a similarly limited red-shift when increasing the optical path compared to that of the bare Cdot-based LSC, indicating that the addition of Ag@SiO2 does not significantly influence the reabsorption effect. We further evaluated the stability of the LSC. The PL emission intensities of thin film Cdot-based LSCs with and without an optimized amount of Ag40@SiO2 under dark conditions and under UV irradiation with high power intensity (400 nm, 1 W cm−2) for 4 h are measured (see Fig. S11†). The PL emission integral area after 4 h UV irradiation6 was calculated to compare the photostability, obtaining values of 87% for the bare Cdot-based LSC, and 83% for the LSC with Ag40@SiO2. These results indicate that the differences in stability between the two samples are minimal. The slight decrease in photostability of thin film LSCs with Ag@SiO2 may be due to the weakening of the plasmonic coupling between Ag NP and Cdots. In fact, photocorrosion of Ag under such intense and long-term UV irradiation is likely to occur, and this could partially degrade the absorption properties of the LSC. We further analyzed the photostability of the as-prepared LSCs by using the accelerated stability test.6,49 LSC films were exposed to UV radiation with a wavelength of 400 nm and power intensity of 1 W cm−2. Based on the absorption spectra of the LSC (4.9 mW cm−2), the acceleration factor can be calculated to be equal to 204. Thus, 4 h irradiation with a UV lamp translates into ∼1 year under natural light exposure (average working conditions with 30 mW cm−2 and exposure time of 8 h per day, as considered previously in ref. 6). This means that the Ag40@SiO2/Cdot LSC after one year would still maintain 83% of its original emission integral area, while the sample without plasmonic NPs maintains 87% of its PL emission integral area. We believe that these data show a good stability of the system and that the small differences in stabilities can be compensated by the improved efficiencies due to the plasmonic enhancement.
Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, we successfully employed plasmonic metal NPs to enhance the absorption and emission properties of Cdots, realizing a plasmon-enhanced Cdot-based semi-transparent LSC. By tuning the amount of Ag40@SiO2 in Cdot solution, a maximum enhancement of the PL excitation and emission of Cdots is obtained, resulting in an increase by 30% and 26%, respectively. Such an improvement is attributed to the stronger light absorption of Cdots caused by the introduced LSPR from the surrounding Ag40@SiO2 NPs. The Cdots with plasmon-enhanced photoluminescence were first applied to a liquid LSC to identify the optimal concentration of plasmonic NPs, yielding an optical efficiency of 1.23% and an improvement of more than 17% compared to that of the bare-Cdot liquid LSC (η = 1.05%). The optimized thin film LSC based on plasmonic Ag and Cdots exhibited an improvement of 25% (η = 0.9% at G = 25) compared to the bare Cdot-based thin film LSC (η = 0.72%, G = 25). While our Cdot-based plasmonic LSCs do not exhibit the best optical performance among the reported LSCs, our work demonstrates that the use of plasmonic metals to enhance QD-based LSCs is a technologically feasible solution and provides a promising platform to investigate plasmonic NPs coupled with QDs in LSC devices.
Even though the silver NPs used in our work are less cost-effective compared to other plasmonic metals (copper, aluminum, etc.), they present the strongest plasmonic effect. It is reported, for example, that their excellent plasmonic effect could induce emission enhancement up to 30× times.50 Finding the most efficient methods for coupling Ag metals with colloidal QDs to realize LSC devices is still a challenge and we believe it is an interesting research direction. On the other hand, non-noble plasmonic metals such as copper and aluminum have also attracted much attention due to their excellent plasmonic properties and low cost, making them potential alternative plasmonic materials for LSC devices. Overall, our work demonstrates that the use of plasmonic metals to enhance QD-based LSCs is a technologically feasible solution, and it provides a promising concept to investigate plasmonic effects in QD-based LSC devices.
