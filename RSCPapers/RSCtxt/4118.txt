1. Introduction
The introduction of an organic component into an inorganic system to form an inorganic–organic hybrid, including hybrid metal halides,1 chalcogenides,2 and polyoxometalates,3 has attracted considerable attention due to their abundant crystal and electronic structures, and distinctive properties unavailable in pure inorganic and organic materials. The practical and potential applications in solar cells, chromism and switchable nonlinear optical (NLO) devices, etc. provide great motivation for the synthesis and property study of metal halide based hybrids.1,4–6 In hybrid materials, the organic moieties not only balance the negative charge on the inorganic moieties as charge compensation agents, but also influence the structures of the inorganic framework as structure directing agents (SDAs). Although it has been demonstrated that the organic moieties with different sizes, charges, shapes, as well as hydrogen bond sites heavily influence the crystal and electronic structures, and physical properties of the hybrid materials, a clear relationship between them has still not been observed, and hence a sustained effort on the synthesis and property study of hybrid materials is necessary.
Aliphatic amines and aromatic organic species are two types of the mainly used SDAs, which exhibit different structural and physical features compared to each other. The former are typically flexible, linear and easily soluble in water, while the latter are generally rigid, flat, and photo/electrochemically active. These obvious differences enables aliphatic amines and aromatic organic species to make different contributions to the structure and properties of metal halide based hybrids. For example, aliphatic amines could direct the formation of metal halide based hybrids with perovskite type structures that are applied in photovoltaic cells with power conversion efficiencies now exceeding 18%.4 Also, the flexibility of the aliphatic amines may cause structural or conformational changes when the temperature changes, which could lead to reversible phase transitions and potential applications in dielectric and NLO switches of metal halide based hybrids.5 For aromatic SDAs, besides the unusual contributions to the crystal and electronic structures of metal halide hybrids, they can also produce additional or improved physical properties in the hybrids. It has been reported that the utilization of functional aromatic species as SDAs can result in optical properties such as photochromism or thermochromism behaviors which are novel in metal halide based hybrids.1c,6 However, it should be noted that although lots of work has been done to systematically study aliphatic or aromatic SDAs with different substituents for influencing the structures and properties of metal halide based hybrids,5c,7 the work was usually performed with either aliphatic or aromatic SDAs. A comparison study of aliphatic and aromatic SDAs, influencing the structure and properties of metal halide based hybrids, is rarely reported.8
Aliphatic chelating polyamines such as en (ethylenediamine), dien (diethylenetriamine), tren (triethylenetetramine), tepa (tetraethylenepentamine) and 1,2-chda (1,2-cyclohexanediamine) have been widely used in the syntheses of hybrid chalcogenides and polyoxometalates.9 Although related work has also been performed on metal halide based hybrids, additional transition metal (TM) ions were usually added to the reaction system, where the chelating polyamines typically coordinate to the TM ions to generate metal complex cations as SDAs.10 We have been interested in a comparison study of aliphatic amines and aromatic species as SDAs, influencing the structure and properties of metal halide hybrids.8 In hybrid haloargentates, we demonstrated that an aromatic SDA, (H2dpe)2+ (dpe = 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene), could direct the formation of a novel β-type (AgI2)− anionic chain and adjust the band gap in a way different from aliphatic amines.8 In this work, with the aim to compare the different contributions of aliphatic amines (and no TM ions added to the reaction system) and aromatic species to the structure and properties of iodoplumbate hybrids, we selected the aliphatic chelating polyamines en, dien, tren, tepa and 1,2-chda, and the aromatic pyridine-based species 2,2′-bipy (2,2′-bipyridine) and dpe as SDAs to synthesize iodoplumbate hybrids. Six hybrid compounds were successfully isolated,11 namely [(Hen)4(H2.5O)2I](PbI6) (1), Cs2n[Pb3I8(en)2]n (2), (H3tepa)n(PbI5)n (3), (H2aep)n(PbI4)n (4), (Et22,2′-bipy)n(Pb2I6)n (5), and (Et2dpe)n(Pb2I6)n (6), which show diverse structures with different dimensionalities: 0-D (zero-dimensional) for 1, 1-D for 3 and 5–6, and 2-D for 2 and 4. Compound 1 features a novel co-template [(Hen)4(H2.5O)2I]4+ directing the formation of a discrete octahedral (PbI6)4− anion. Compound 2 contains inorganic Cs+ ions and a novel hybrid anionic layer [Pb3I8(en)2]n2n− that has never been encountered in iodoplumbate hybrids. Compound 3 contains a zigzag (PbI5)3− chain with the charge being compensated by a letter “C”-like triprotonated tepa cation. Compound 4 is composed of perovskite sheets of lead(II) octahedra, and aep cations that are generated from tepa molecules via an unprecedented in situ ligand reaction. Compounds 5 and 6 contain the same inorganic (Pb2I6)n2n− anionic chain and represent the first example of introducing 2,2′-bipy and dpe derivative cations in iodoplumbate systems, respectively. The comparative study reveals that the aliphatic amines and aromatic species contribute differently to the crystal and electronic structures, and properties of the iodoplumbate hybrids. Importantly, compounds 1–4 exhibit interesting water induced structure conversions, while 5 and 6 are stable in water and can be used as heterogeneous photocatalysts for dye wastewater treatment under visible light irradiation. Herein, we report the detailed syntheses, crystal and electronic structures, water induced structure conversions (for 1–4) and visible light photocatalytic degradation of an organic dye (for 5–6).
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and characterization
All reagents were purchased commercially and used without further purification. Elemental analyses of C, H, and N were performed on an Elementar Vario EL III microanalyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. A Perkin-Elmer Diamond thermogravimetric analyzer was used to obtain thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves in N2 with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1 and a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range 30–1000 °C. An empty Al2O3 crucible was used as the reference. The FT-IR spectra were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer in the range 4000–400 cm−1 using a KBr disk.
2.2 Photocatalytic experiments
The evaluation of the photocatalytic activities of compounds 5 and 6 for the photocatalytic decolorization of an organic dye was performed at ambient temperature. The procedure was as follows: 0.020 g of powder sample was dispersed into 40 mL of a methyl orange aqueous solution (MO, 14.2 mg L−1) for 30 min in the absence of light to attain an adsorption–desorption equilibrium, followed by the addition of one drop of hydrogen peroxide solution (H2O2, 30%). A 300 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source. An optical filter from the equipment of the xenon arc lamp was used for filtering out any UV emission below 400 nm. The above solutions were then irradiated with visible light. During the degradation, the mixture was stirred continuously by means of a magnetic stirrer. The samples were withdrawn regularly from the reactor, and dispersed powders were removed by centrifugation. At different time intervals, analytical samples were withdrawn and analyzed by UV/Vis spectroscopy.
2.3 Computational details
X-ray crystallographic data of 2–6 were used to calculate the electronic structures. Density of states (DOS) calculations were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) with one of the three nonlocal gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functionals (GGA-PBE) and performed with the CASTEP code,12 which uses a plane wave basis set for the valence electrons and a norm-conserving pseudopotential for the core electrons.13 The number of plane waves included in the basis was determined by a cutoff energy, Ec, of 280 eV for 2–6. Pseudo-atomic calculations were performed for Pb 5d106s26p2, I 5s25p5, Cs 5s25p66s1, C, 2s22p2, N 2s22p3 and H 1s1. The parameters used in the calculations and convergence criteria were set using the default values of the CASTEP code.12

Compounds 1–6 are stable in dry air and insoluble in common organic solvents. The phase purities of bulk crystals of 1–6 for physical property measurements were confirmed by PXRD studies (Fig. S1†). The experimental PXRD patterns are in good agreement with the simulated patterns from the single-crystal structures, which reveals the phase purity of the bulk crystalline materials.

2.5 Single-crystal structure determination
Intensity data sets of 1–6 were collected on an Agilent Xcalibur, Eos, Gemini CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatic Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 293 K. The data sets were reduced by the CrysAlisPro14 program. An empirical absorption correction using spherical harmonics was implemented in the SCALE3 ABSPACK scaling algorithm. The structures were solved by direct methods using the Siemens SHELXL package of crystallographic software.15 Different Fourier maps were created on the basis of these atomic positions to yield the other non-hydrogen atoms. The structures were refined using a full-matrix least-squares refinement on F2. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were located at geometrically calculated positions and refined as riding on their parent atoms. All protons were located using a different Fourier synthesis. For the monoprotonated en molecule (N2H2–C2H2–C3H2–N3H2) in 1, the H+ was assigned to one terminal –NH2 group. For the other two monoprotonated en molecules, the H+ was assigned to both terminal –NH2 groups with an occupancy of 50%. Crystallographic data and structural refinements for 1–6 are summarized in Table 1. Important bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S1.†

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthetic considerations
Aliphatic chelating polyamines including the bidentate en and 1,2-chda, tridentate dien, tetradentate tren, and pentadentate tepa, and the aromatic pyridine-based species 2,2′-bipy and dpe were selected to synthesize iodoplumbate hybrids under solvothermal conditions. Although we have tried our best to vary the reaction conditions, not all the aliphatic chelating polyamines were successfully incorporated into inorganic iodoplumbates (Scheme 1). Compounds 1, 3, and 4 with the protonated en, tepa and aep (formed via an in situ ligand reaction) cations were obtained. The addition of Cs+ ions to the reaction system of 1 affords compound 2, which features inorganic Cs+ ions, charge compensating an unprecedented hybrid anionic layer [Pb3I8(en)2]n2n−. Obviously, the introduction of Cs+ cations makes the en molecule free from acting as a charge compensating agent, but enables it to act as a neutral chelating ligand to Pb atoms in the hybrid anionic layer. Similar efforts by adding additional Cs+ ions to the reaction systems of 3–6 were unsuccessful in obtaining new phases. Moreover, the attempts of replacing Cs+ with other cations with a smaller or larger radius, e.g. K+, Rb+ or (CH3)4N+ cations, to get new phases in the synthesis of 2 were unsuccessful. All these suggest that only Cs+ ions with a proper radius could collaborate with the en molecules to co-direct the formation of a iodoplumbate hybrid.

In situ ligand reactions under solvo(hydro)thermal conditions have provoked significant interest for discovering new organic reactions and making novel compounds.16 Of particular interest is the fact that an unprecedented in situ ligand reaction has been observed in this work. The reaction conditions of 4 have resulted in the in situ cyclization of a tepa molecule to an aep molecule, presumably due to an intramolecular cyclization reaction (Scheme 2). The syntheses of 3 and 4 with the same starting materials but under different reaction temperatures (150 °C for 3 and 180 °C for 4) strongly suggest that the temperature greatly influence the in situ cyclization reaction. Furthermore, an extension of the reaction time to seven days is needed for the synthesis of 4, because it can significantly increase the yield. Similar cyclization reactions of aliphatic chelating polyamines have been observed elsewhere.17 In the case of tepa, the cyclization reactions to generate 4-(2-aminoethyl)-triethylenetetramine and N-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine-1,4-diethylamine have been reported recently,17h however the intramolecular cyclization to generate N-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine like that in 4 has never been observed.

3.2 Crystal structures
Compounds 1–6 feature 0-D (for 1), 1-D (for 3, 5 and 6) or 2-D (for 2 and 4) structures containing isolated or polymerized (PbI6) octahedra. The Pb–I bond lengths varying in normal ranges of 3.1965(3)–3.2906(3) Å for 1, 3.1711(4)–3.2202(3) Å for 2, 3.0896(3)–3.3180(2) Å for 3, 3.1397(3)–3.2831(3) Å for 4, 3.1197(4)–3.4005(4) Å for 5 and 3.2118(3)–3.2670(3) Å for 6, and the I–Pb–I bond angles (adjacent iodides) deviating from the ideal value of 90° (Table S1†), indicate distortions of the (PbI6) octahedra, which suggests that the 6s2 electron lone pairs of the Pb(II) ions in 1–6 are more or less stereochemically active.1b,18

Crystal structure of 1. 
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c and is composed of an isolated octahedral (PbI6)4− anion, protonated en and water cations, and an I− anion (Fig. 1). The protonated en and water cations together with the iodine anion as a whole direct the assembly of the inorganic iodoplumbate anion, revealing obvious cooperative directing effects. In other words, compound 1 can be considered to be formed under direction of a co-template of the organic cations (protonated en), inorganic cations (protonated water), and inorganic anion (I−). There is only one crystallographically independent Pb atom, which is coordinated by six I atoms in a slightly distorted octahedral coordination environment. The Pb–I bond distances (3.1965(3)–3.2906(3) Å) are comparable with those found in other iodoplumbate hybrids containing a discrete (PbI6)4− anion.19 The I1, I1A, I3 and I3A (A: (1 − x, y, 3/2 − z)) resides in the equatorial positions, and the apical positions are occupied by the I2 and I2A atoms with an axial angle of I2–Pb1–I2A of 177.80(1)°, as opposed to the ideal angle of 180°. The en and H2O molecules were assigned to be protonated to compensate the negative charges of the (PbI6)4− and I− anions. Interestingly, the protonated en molecules in 1 adopt two different configurations with the C–C and C–N bond distances in their normal ranges (Fig. S2†).20 Supramolecular assembly through hydrogen bonds is an efficient route to create materials with designed structures and properties. In 1, the co-template contains four protonated en molecules, two protonated water molecules and one I− anion, wherein each I− anion interacts with two protonated en via N–H⋯I hydrogen bonds, and each protonated water molecule connects with three protonated en cations via O–H⋯N or N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, and connects with one neighboring protonated water via an O–H⋯O hydrogen bond to form a 2-D supramolecular layer parallel to the ab plane (Fig. S3a, Table S2†). Each octahedral (PbI6)4− anion using its four equatorial I atoms connects with six (Hen)+ cations of the co-template through N–H⋯I hydrogen bonds to form a 3-D supramolecular framework (Figs. S3b and S3c†).

An important structural feature of 1 is the existence of a novel co-template formed by organic cations (Hen)+, inorganic cations (H2.5O)0.5+, and inorganic anions (I−) through supramolecular interactions. Hybrid halometallates synthesized by employing co-templates of solvent molecule + organic cation,21 organic anion + organic cation,20a and inorganic anion + organic cation, have been reported,22 however a co-template like that in 1 has not been reported up to now.


Crystal structure of 2. 
Compound 2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmca and contains isolated Cs+ ions, and 2-D hybrid anionic structures formed by Pb2+ cations, I− anions and en molecules (Fig. 2). There are three quarters of a Pb atom (one forth of Pb1 and one half of Pb2), one half of a Cs+ ion, two I− anions, and one half of an en molecule in the asymmetric unit of 2. The Pb1, Pb2, Cs1, I2 and I3 atoms are all in special positions. Both Pb1 and Pb2 atoms are six-coordinated, but in different coordination geometries. The Pb1 atom is coordinated by four μ2-I and two It atoms (It = terminal I) to form a slightly distorted (Pb1I6) octahedron. The Pb2 atom is six-coordinated by two N atoms from one chelating en ligand, and four μ2-I atoms to form a (Pb2I4en) unit. The Pb–μ2-I bond distances in the range of 3.2079(2)–3.2202(3) Å are noticeably longer than the Pb–It bond distance of 3.1711(4) Å. The (Pb2I4en) units corner-share two μ2-I atoms to form novel hybrid (PbI4en)n chains extending along the c direction. The octahedral (Pb1I6) anion as an inorganic linker shares four μ2-I atoms with two adjacent hybrid chains and connects the chains into hybrid 2-D anionic [Pb3I8(en)2]n2n− layers parallel to the ac plane (Fig. S4a†). The isolated Cs+ ions reside between the anionic layers charge-compensating the negative charges of the anionic layers (Fig. S4b†). Careful inspection of the crystal structure indicates that there are electrostatic forces rather than hydrogen bonds between the anionic layers. By contrast, N–H⋯I hydrogen bonds are observed within the 2-D hybrid layers (Fig. S4b and S5, Table S3†).
 Fig. 2  Crystal structure of 2. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Symmetry codes: A (1 − x, y, z); B (x, 1 − y, 2 − z); C (1 − x, 1 − y, 2 − z); D (1/2 − x, 1 − y, 1/2 + z); E (12 − x, y, 3/2 − z); F (x, 1 − y, 1 − z); G (1/2 − x, 1 − y, −1/2 + z); H (1/2 − x, y, 1/2 − z). 
The most remarkable structural feature of 2 is the existence of a novel hybrid 2-D anionic layer formed by inorganic (PbI6) linkers connecting hybrid (PbI4en)n chains. As is well-known, inorganic 2-D iodoplumbate anionic layers e.g., (PbI4)2−,7b,23 (Pb3I10)4−,24 and (Pb4I18),10–20a are very common in iodoplumbate hybrids. By contrast, 2-D iodoplumbate anions with covalently bonded organic species showing a hybrid character, are rarely reported, and so far can only be observed in six compounds,25 however, the hybrid layers are all formed by organic ligands or metal organic complex cations as linkers connecting the inorganic (PbxIy)(y−2x)− chains, showing a different hybrid feature from that in 2.


Crystal structure of 3. 
Compound 3 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and contains a 1-D zigzag (PbI5)3− chain and a triprotonated tepa cation. The asymmetric unit of 3 is composed of one (PbI5)3− unit (part of a zigzag chain of corner-sharing octahedra), and one triprotonated tepa cation (Fig. 3). The Pb1 atom is in a typical octahedral coordination environment, formed by two μ2-I atoms (I1, I1A) and four terminal I atoms (I2, I3, I4 and I5). The octahedra share two adjacent corners to form an infinite zigzag single chain extending along the b direction with a Pb1–μ2-I–Pb1B bond angle of 165.93(1)° and a μ2-I1–Pb1–μ2-I1A bond angle of 84.68(1)°. The Pb–μ2-I bond distances, varying from 3.2904(3)–3.3180(2) Å, and the Pb–It bond distances in the range of 3.0896(3)–3.2537(3) Å are in their normal ranges. The tepa molecules curve with a shape similar to that of the letter “C”, and are triprotonated to reach charge neutralization of the structure of 3. The “C”-like tepa molecules clamp both sides of the (PbI5)3− chain, and interact with the inorganic chain via N–H⋯I and C–H⋯I hydrogen bonds to form a 1-D neutral hybrid supramolecular chain (Fig. S6a, Table S4†). Such hybrid chains are stacked and form C–H⋯I hydrogen bonds with the neighboring ones to form 2-D supramolecular layers parallel to the (101) plane (Fig. S6b†), which are further stacked along the [101] direction through electrostatic forces to form a 3-D supramolecular framework (Fig. S6c†).
 Fig. 3  Crystal structure of 3. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Symmetry codes: A (1/2 − x, −1/2 + y, 3/2 − z); B (1/2 − x, 1/2 + y, 3/2 − z). 
The 1-D (PbI5)3− single chain is not unusual in iodoplumbate hybrids,5a,7a,d,18,26 where two isomers of (PbI5)3− can be observed. One is the linear type formed by each (PbI6) octahedron sharing opposite corners;5a,18,26a the other is the zigzag type formed by (PbI6) octahedra alternatively sharing opposite corners and adjacent corners.7a,d,26b,c In 3, the (PbI5)3− single chain adopts the zigzag type structure. Additionally, it should be noted that compound 3 represents the first example of introducing a tepa derivative cation in a iodoplumbate hybrid.


Crystal structure of 4. 
Compound 4 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbca and features N-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine cationic single layers separated by single-layer-thick perovskite sheets of lead(II) octahedra. Four unique iodine atoms surround the lead atom in the asymmetric unit with the Pb–I bond distances being in their normal range (Fig. 4). I1 and I3 are in the axial positions; I2 and I4 and their symmetry equivalents I2A (1/2 − x, −1/2 + y, z) and I4B (−x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 − z) lie in the equatorial plane and are shared between the octahedra. The Pb–I bond distances to the axial halides with an average value of 3.1686(3) Å are about 0.0887 Å shorter than the average value of the bridging Pb–I bonds of 3.2573(3) Å. The two unique bridging I atoms, I2 and I4, introduce two bridging angles: Pb1–μ2-I2–Pb1 of 153.87(1)°, and Pb1–μ2-I4–Pb1 of 163.26(1)°. The former angle is noticeably more acute than the latter one, and both are more acute compared to the similar angle Pb1–μ2-I–Pb1 of 165.93(1)° in 3. In the corner-sharing (PbI6) octahedra of 4, the trans angle formed by two axial I atoms is 175.49(1)°, and those formed between the four bridging halides are 170.592(8)° and 175.609(8)°, which are all deviating from the ideal case of 180°. In the crystal structure of 4, each gap made by four corner-sharing (PbI6) octahedra is occupied above and below by two (H2aep)2+ cations that are arranged in a head-to-tail mode of the piperazine head and ethylamine tail. The halogen ions in the axial positions together with one of the bridging iodides connect with the (H2aep)2+ cations via N–H⋯I and C–H⋯I hydrogen bonds (Fig. S7a, Table S5†), which form the inorganic layers, sandwiching the organic cationic layers (Fig. S7b†).
 Fig. 4  Crystal structure of 4. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Symmetry codes: A (1/2 − x, 1/2 + y, z); B (1/2 − x, −1/2 + y, z); C (−x, −1/2 + y, 1/2 − z); D (−x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 − z). 
Although tepa molecules were used as SDAs in the reaction of 4, structural analysis identifies the presence of biprotonated aep cations in the product, which suggests that the reaction conditions have resulted in the cyclization of the tepa molecules leading to the in situ formation of aep. Such an in situ intramolecular cyclization of tepa to generate aep has never been reported before.


Crystal structure of 5. 
Compound 5 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbca and is composed of (Et22,2′-bipy)2+ cations and a 1-D infinite (Pb2I6)n2n− anionic chain (Fig. 5). The infinite (Pb2I6)n2n− chain extends along the b direction and consists of trans face-sharing (PbI6) octahedra, which have two crystallographically independent Pb atoms and six I atoms. The Pb–I bond distances range from 3.1197(4) to 3.4005(4) Å, and the I–Pb–I bond angles fall in the range of 167.509(9)–177.649(9)° for the trans type and 83.565(8)–104.341(9)° for the cis type, which are consistent with those found in other (Pb2I6)n2n− chains.20b,27 The crystal packing of 5 clearly displays that each 1-D iodoplumbate chain is encapsulated in a trapezoid channel formed by (Et22,2′-bipy)2+ cations extending along the b direction (Fig. S8†), unlike the flexible aliphatic amines in 1–4, which form plenty of hydrogen bonds with the inorganic iodoplumbates. Structural analysis indicates that the shortest C⋯I distance of 3.724(4) Å and N⋯I distance of 3.797(3) Å are both longer than the sum of their van der Waals radii, indicating that there exist electrostatic forces instead of hydrogen bonds between the (Et22,2′-bipy)2+ cations and (Pb2I6)n2n− anionic chains. The 2,2′-bipy species in 5 has two nearly perpendicular pyridyl rings with a dihedral angle of 81.033(115)°, and is bi-ethylated, generating a (Et22,2′-bipy)2+ cation to counteract the negative charges of the (Pb2I6)2− anionic chain. Further, the nearest centroid to centroid distance between the pyridyl rings of two neighbouring (Et22,2′-bipy)2+ cations is 5.441(1) Å, indicating that there are no significant π⋯π stacking interactions.
 Fig. 5  Crystal structure of 5. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Symmetry codes: A (1/2 − x, −1/2 + y, z). 
Aromatic 2,2′-bipy has been used to synthesize iodoplumbate hybrids by others, however, it usually forms TM complex cations as SDAs,27d,28 or as a chelating ligand chelates the inorganic iodoplumbate skeleton29 in reported compounds. Compound 5 represents a rare example of discrete 2,2′-bipy derivative cations as SDAs in a iodoplumbate hybrid.


Crystal structure of 6. 
Compound 6 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c and contains inorganic infinite (Pb2I6)n2n− chains and bi-ethylated dpe cations (Et2dpe)2+ (Fig. 6). The asymmetric unit has one Pb atom, three I atoms, and one half of a (Et2dpe)2+ cation. The Pb and I atoms form inorganic (Pb2I6)n2n− anionic chains similar to those in 5. However, the introduction of bigger aromatic bi-ethylated dpe cations in 6 leads to a decrease in crystallographic symmetry (No. 61 for 5 and No. 14 for 6) and different orientations of the inorganic iodoplumbate anionic chains: along the b axis in 5 and the c axis in 6. Besides, the Pb–I bond distances (3.2118(3) to 3.2670(3) Å), and the I–Pb–I bond angles (169.738(8)–174.383(11)° for the trans type and 84.248(8)–100.529(10)° for the cis type) in 6 all show a narrower range compared with those in 5, which implies that the (Pb2I6)n2n− anionic chain in 6 is less distorted than that in 5. The crystal packing diagram of 6 can be described as each (Pb2I6)n2n− anionic chain encapsulated in a channel formed by (Et2dpe)2+ cations extending along the c direction (Fig. S9†). Similar to 5, there are electrostatic forces instead of hydrogen bonds between the aromatic organic cations and inorganic anionic chains. Notably, the organic components interact with the inorganic components via electrostatic forces both in 5 and 6, which is different from the hydrogen bond interactions in 1–4. This may be ascribed to the more flexible skeleton and more hydrogen bond sites of the aliphatic amines in 1–4 than those of the pyridine-based organic species in 5 and 6. Because of the ethenyl linker, the two pyridine rings in the dpe molecule are nearly co-planar with a dihedral angle of 0.0(1)°. The centroid to centroid distance between the pyridyl rings of two neighboring (Et2dpe)2+ cations is too long (minimum value of 5.404 Å) to generate significant π⋯π stacking interactions.
 Fig. 6  Crystal structure of 6. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Symmetry codes: A (x, 1/2 − y, 1/2 + z); B (x, 1/2 − y, −1/2 + z); C (1 − x, 1 − y, −z). 
Although aromatic dpe derivative cations have been applied in other metal halide based hybrids, e.g. hybrid iodoargentates8,30 and hybrid iodocuprates,31 to our knowledge, a dpe derivative cation directing the formation of a hybrid iodoplumbate has never been reported before.


The different influences of aliphatic amines and aromatic species on the crystal structures of the iodoplumbate hybrids. 
Aliphatic amines with a flexible skeleton and more than one –NH2 or >NH groups (which can form abundant hydrogen bonds with solvent molecules to form co-templates or with the inorganic iodoplumbate anions) are likely to show unpredictable behaviors during the solvothermal syntheses of metal halide hybrids, as exemplified by the syntheses of 1–4, where the unpredictable behaviors include aliphatic amines hydrogen bonding with solvent or inorganic ions to form a novel co-template in 1, acting as a neutral organic ligand chelating the inorganic iodoplumbate skeleton in 2, being tri-protonated to form a charge compensation agent with a charge of +3 in 3 (mono- or biprotonated ones with a positive charge of +1 or +2 are common for aliphatic amines), and undergoing an in situ ligand reaction in 4. Unpredictable behaviors of aliphatic amines may enable them to direct the formation of more abundant inorganic iodoplumbate anions. In this work, the aliphatic amines direct the formation of hybrid iodoplumbates with anionic structures varying from 0-D (PbI6)4− octahedral anions, to 1-D (PbI5)n3n− anionic chains to 2-D [Pb3I8(en)2]n2n− hybrid layers or (PbI4)n2n− inorganic layers. By contrast, the aromatic pyridine-based organic cations direct the formation of 5 and 6 in this work with iodoplumbate anions only including (Pb2I6)n2n− anionic chains. From the analysis above, it seems that employing aliphatic amines as SDAs is more likely to generate metal halide hybrids with unpredictable crystal structures. However, it should be noted that besides SDAs, other important factors including the temperature, solvent, pH value of the solution, and the molar ratio of the reactants can also greatly influence the crystal structures of the hybrids.

3.3 Optical spectroscopy
In the IR spectra of 1–6 (Fig. S10†), the IR bands at 3340–3280 cm−1 and 2540–2315 cm−1 for 1 are attributed to the N–H+ deformation and stretching vibrations of the protonated en molecules. For 3 and 4, the IR bands at 2870–2810 cm−1 and 2550–2320 cm−1 are attributed to the N–H+ stretching vibrations of the triprotonated tepa and biprotonated aep molecules. For 5–6, the strong bands in the region of 3010–3070 cm−1 correspond to the C–H vibrations of the aromatic ring hydrogen atoms, ν(C–H). The bands of the ring vibrations of the aromatic N-heterocyclic species (ν(CC) and ν(CN)) are observed at 1455–1630 cm−1. The broad bands in the range of 3525–3435 cm−1 for 1–6 are assigned to the stretching of trace water since the measurements were conducted in air.
Solid state UV-vis absorption spectra of 1–6 and inorganic bulk PbI2 calculated from the diffuse reflectance data using the Kubelka–Mulk function, are plotted in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the band gaps of 1–6 can be divided into two groups compared with the measured value of 2.30 eV for bulk PbI2. Compounds 1–3 and 5 have bigger band gaps of 2.87 eV for 1, 3.05 eV for 2, 2.85 eV for 3, and 2.64 eV for 5, exhibiting an observed blue shift compared with the band gap of bulk PbI2. While, compounds 4 and 6 have smaller band gaps of 2.20 eV for 4 and 2.16 eV for 6, thereby showing an observed red shift compared with that of bulk PbI2. Our previous comparison study on iodoargentate hybrids reveals that aliphatic amine-containing hybrids have generally bigger band gaps than those of aromatic species-containing hybrids.8 In this work, the band gaps of 1–3 follow the rule by having bigger band gaps than those of 5 and 6. However, compound 4 does not follow the rule and has a smaller band gap. The abnormal phenomenon may be ascribed to the 2-D iodoplumbate anionic layers in 4 with a dimensionality higher than that of the anionic chains in 5 and 6, obeying the rule that the band gap decreases as the dimensionality increases.32 In addition, the band gaps of 1–6 are all consistent with their colors of the crystals.

3.4 Electronic structures calculations
To gain further insight into the optical properties of 2–6, theoretical studies including the band structures along with high symmetry points of the first Brillouin zone, and density of states (DOS) were performed using the CASTEP code.33 The calculated band structures and DOS of 2–6 along certain symmetry directions are given in Fig. S11† and 8, respectively. The calculated band gaps of 2–6 using the local density approximation (LDA) are 2.71, 2.74, 1.78, 1.35 and 1.15 eV, which are smaller than their corresponding experimental values of 3.05, 2.85, 2.20, 2.64 and 2.16 eV, respectively. The discrepancy is due to the limitations of the DFT method which sometimes underestimates the band gap in semiconductors and insulators.34 It can be seen from the band structure plots that compounds 2, 4 and 6 are direct band gap materials, while compounds 3 and 5 are indirect band gap materials.
 Fig. 8  Total and partial density of states of 2 (a), 3 (b), 4 (c), 5 (d), and 6 (e). 
The aliphatic amines in 2–4, and the aromatic pyridine-based SDAs in 5–6 make different contributions to the electronic structures of their corresponding hybrids. The aliphatic amines in 2–4 make nearly no or very small contributions to the frontier orbitals of the hybrids, which suggests that they influence the band gaps in an indirect way via modulating the anionic structures of the hybrids. The bands can be assigned according to the total and partial densities of states (PDOS, Fig. 8). From the total and partial DOS (PDOS) diagrams (Fig. 8a), we can see that the Cs+ ions and en molecules in 2 make nearly no contribution to the top of the valence bands (VBs) and the bottom of the conduction bands (CBs). That is to say, the Cs+ ions and en molecules are not involved in the charge transition in 2. The band just below the Fermi level between −3 and 0 eV is predominately derived from the contribution of the 5p state of I, mixed with a small amount of 6s and 6p states of Pb. The bottom of the conduction bands is mainly contributed by the 6p state of Pb, mixed with the 5s state of I. Therefore, the optical absorptions are mainly ascribed to the charge transitions from the 5p state of I to the 6p state of Pb, meaning that the charge transitions mainly occur within the inorganic iodoplumbate anions.
Compounds 3 and 4 have similar electronic structures. The top of the VBs are mainly derived from the 5p state of I, mixed with small contributions of the 6p state of Pb and p orbits of the SDAs (Fig. 8b and c). The bottom of the CBs is mostly formed by the 6p state of Pb and a small amount of the 5 s and 5p states of I. Accordingly, the intrinsic absorption of 3 and 4 can be mainly ascribed to the charge transitions from the 5p state of I to the 6p state of Pb mixed with little charge transition between the p orbits of the SDAs and the 6p state of Pb, meaning that the charge transitions mainly occur within the inorganic iodoplumbate anions accompanied by little charge transitions from the aliphatic SDAs to the iodoplumbate anions.
However, the aromatic organic cations in 5–6 influence the band gaps of the hybrid iodoplumbates in a direct way that is significantly different from that of the aliphatic amines in 2–4. As shown in Fig. 8d and e, compounds 5 and 6 have similar electronic structures. The VBs between −3 and 0 eV are all mainly from the contribution of the 5p state of I without the contribution of the SDAs, which is similar to that in 2 and is different from those in 3 and 4. Notably, the CBs between 0 and 3 eV are nearly entirely from the contribution of the p–π* antibonding orbital of the aromatic organic dications, which is quite distinct from those in 2–4, where the bottom of the CBs is constructed from the contributions of the Pb and I atoms. Correspondingly, the optical absorption of 5 and 6 is mainly ascribed to the charge transitions from the 5p state of I to the p–π* orbital of the aromatic SDAs (Et22,2′-bipy)2+ or (Et2dpe)2+, meaning that the charge transitions mainly occur from the inorganic iodoplumbate polyanions to the aromatic SDAs, which is also different from those in 2–4. In brief, different from the aliphatic amines, the aromatic organic cations (Et22,2′-bipy)2+ and (Et2dpe)2+ can make great contribution to the bottom of the conduction band, and modulate the band gap significantly and directly. The different contributions of aliphatic amines and aromatic organic cations to the electronic structures observed here is consistent with our observations on iodoargentate hybrids.8
3.5 Water induced structure conversions
Besides the different contributions to the crystal and electronic structures, the introduction of aliphatic amines and aromatic species into iodoplumbate hybrids can also induce different stabilities in water. Compounds 1–4 with the aliphatic amines are unstable in water and undergo structure conversions accompanied by color and morphology changes (Fig. 9b and c). Unlike the single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) structure transformations reported in the literature, after being soaked in water for 3 days the single crystallinities of the as-synthesized crystals 1–4 are destroyed, and hence are unsuitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction studies (SXRD, Fig. 9b). By contrast, the crystals of 5 and 6 remain unchanged in water after 3 days, which suggests that both compounds are stable in water (Fig. 9b).
 Fig. 9  Photographs of the as-synthesized single crystals of 1–6 (a), the crystals after being soaked in water for 3 days (b, the samples are denoted as 1b–6b, respectively), and the ultrasound treated samples after being soaked in water for another 3 days (c, the samples are denoted as 1c–6c, respectively). 
To ensure that the experiments inducing the changes of 1–4 in water were thoroughly carried out, and meanwhile clarify whether any changes occurred for 5–6, ultrasound treatments were performed to get fine powders of 1b–6b, which were soaked in water for another 3 days to get 1c–6c (Fig. 9c). Then, PXRD measurements were performed for 1c–6c. The PXRD patterns of 1c and 2c are in good agreement with the standard pattern of the inorganic structure of PbI(OH) (orthorhombic phase, space group Pnma, with the lattice constants a = 7.803 Å, b = 4.204 Å, c = 10.452 Å, JCPDS No. 75-1177, Fig. 10a and b). For 3c, the structure conversion can be verified by the PXRD result (Fig. S1a†), however the phase confirmation is unsuccessful, and the attempt to get single crystals of 3c suitable for a SXRD study is in progress. The PXRD pattern of 4c is in good agreement with the standard pattern of the inorganic structure of PbI2 (hexagonal phase, space group Pm1, with the lattice constants a = b = 4.557 Å, c = 6.979 Å, JCPDS no. 79-0803, Fig. 10c). For 5c and 6c, the PXRD patterns are identical with those of their corresponding as-synthesized samples, which further confirm their stabilities in water. The sharp diffraction peaks of 1c–6c indicate good crystallinities of the samples and no other peaks related to any impurity (for 1c–2c and 4c–6c) were observed. Further, the structure conversions cannot be performed by soaking 1–4 in other common solvents such as ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile, ether, and chloroform. All these results suggest that water induced structure conversions from hybrid iodoplumbates to inorganic PbI(OH) or PbI2 occurred for 1–4. The different stabilities of compounds 1–4 from those of 5–6 in water are mainly ascribed to them containing aliphatic or aromatic organic species which have different hydrophilic behaviors (the NH and NH3 groups on the aliphatic amine cations of 1–4 are hydrophilic).
 Fig. 10  PXRD patterns of 1 (a), 2 (b), and 4 (c) under different conditions. 
A dissolution and recrystallization mechanism was proposed to explain the structure conversions of 1–4. In general, the dissolution and recrystallization process would result in new crystal grafts on the original crystal due to easier nucleation on defects of the original crystal,27d which is in accordance with the phenomenon observed for 1b–4b (Fig. 9b). After dissolution in water, the organic species retained in water, while the inorganic species crystallized as PbI(OH) phase for 1c–2c, and as PbI2 phase for 4c. Considering the existence of hydroxyl groups in the PbI(OH) phase, a hydrolysis reaction may proceed during the crystallization of 1c and 2c. In order to further confirm the proposed dissolution and recrystallization mechanism, 6 mg samples of 1–4 were each soaked in 20 mL H2O to verify their solubilities in water. As shown in Fig. S12,† after ultrasound treatment the solutions of 1 and 2 are turbid with white precipitate of PbI(OH), which implies that the hydrolysis and crystallization are quick in the solutions of 1 and 2, while the solutions of 3 and 4 are colorless, which suggests that both samples are completely dissolved in water and the crystallization process is slow. Then, the different behaviors of 1–4 from 5–6 in water can be disclosed from the viewpoint of a metathetical reaction equilibrium: the hydrophilicity of the NH and NH3 groups of the aliphatic cations promotes the metathetical reactions that regulate the dissolution of the organic aliphatic cations and the crystallization of inorganic plumbum iodides.
To our knowledge, the water induced structure conversions of metal halide hybrids from hybrid iodoplumbates to inorganic plumbum iodides have never been demonstrated in detail up to now. It is anticipated that more interesting structure conversion behaviors can be observed in the continuous study of metal halide hybrids, employing aliphatic amines as SDAs.
3.6 Visible light photocatalytic degradation of an organic dye
As is well-known, environmental pollution is one of the major problems threatening the existence of terrestrial lives,35 and the sunlight provides the most abundant renewable energy source to meet mankind's future energy needs.36 In recent years, the utilization of inorganic semiconductors as photocatalysts has received much attention due to their application in solar energy conversion and environmental purification. However, this type of inorganic semiconductor-based photocatalyst also shows some disadvantages. Wide-band gap semiconductors, e.g. TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2, are only able to absorb the UV irradiation that takes up less than 5% of the solar energy, whereas narrow-band gap semiconductors, e.g. Fe2O3, CuO, and CdS, have poor photocatalytic efficiency due to their high carrier recombination rate, low oxidation, or poor photostability, etc.37 Thus, the preparation of new semiconductor-based photocatalysts with improved performances is desirable. Metal halide based hybrids are important semiconductor materials, which exhibit an easily tunable band gap corresponding to the absorption of visible light. They can serve as potential effective photocatalysts for dye degradation, but are less explored.
Considering that compounds 5 and 6 are stable in water and have significant absorption in the visible light region (Fig. S13†), they may be used as heterogeneous photocatalysts for dye wastewater treatment under visible light irradiation. Methyl orange (MO) was selected as a model dye contaminant to evaluate their photocatalytic effectiveness in the degradation of wastewater. The characteristic absorption of MO at 462 nm was selected to monitor the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation process. A comparison of the photocatalytic activities of as-synthesized 5 and 6 is presented in Fig. 11. The change in concentration of the MO solution is obvious with the use of 5 and 6 as photocatalysts (Fig. S14†). It is obvious that compound 5 exhibits much higher activity than that of 6. When the light application time increases to 30 min, the degradation ratio of MO has already reached 88% for 5. The superiority of 5 in the photodegradation of MO sustained until the light application time increased to 50 min. The degradation of MO in water was finished (with a degradation ratio of 92%) after only 40 min for 5 (Fig. 11). By contrast, photocatalyst 6 takes a little more time for the degradation of MO. The time for nearly full degradation of MO in the presence of 6 is 60 min. For comparison, the photodegradation process of MO without any photocatalyst has also been studied under the same conditions. From Fig. 11, it can be seen that when no catalyst was added to the system, the degradation of MO was negligible. These results clearly indicate that compounds 5 and 6 exhibit high photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of MO dye in the presence of H2O2 under visible light irradiation. Photocatalyst 5 possesses higher photocatalytic activity than that of 6, and the reason is probably their discrepancy in the band gap sizes. Photocatalyst 5 has a broader band gap than that of 6, which enables it to have a more effective absorption of visible light (Fig. S13†).
 Fig. 11  Photodecomposition of MO dye in solution over 5 and 6. Left: color change photograph images of the dye solutions. Right: time-dependent UV/vis spectra of MO with or without one of the two photocatalysts. 
In order to investigate the stability of 5 and 6 as visible light photocatalysts, the PXRD patterns of both samples after the photocatalytic degradation have also been measured. The results show that the PXRD patterns of two compounds after MO photodegradation are almost identical with those of the as-synthesized samples (Fig. S15†). The photocatalytic mechanism of 5 and 6 can be explained as follows:38 the photocatalytic properties of 5 and 6 are closely related to the production of hydroxyl radicals. Although one drop H2O2 was added to the dye solution, it alone was not capable of degrading dye solutions without the semiconductor photocatalysts. Under visible light irradiation, the valence band of the semiconductor photocatalyst, 5 or 6, generates holes (h+) and the conduction band generates the same amount of electrons (e−). Both electrons and holes can produce hydroxyl radicals which are known to have high activity to degrade dye molecules.
3.7 TGA of 1–6
The thermal stabilities of 1–6 were examined by TGA in a N2 atmosphere from 30 to 1000 °C (Fig. S16†). The decomposition temperatures of 1–6 are estimated as 138, 195, 327, 315, 246 and 333 °C, respectively. Because the organic cations in 1 and 3–6 all act as counter-cations in their corresponding structures, the iodoplumbate anionic framework collapses with the removal of the organic cations.39 For 1, a total weight loss of about 63.2% before 506 °C might correspond to the removal of one [(Hen)4(H2.5O)2I]I4 unit per formula (theoretical value of 66.52%). From the TGA curve of 2, it can be seen that the neutral en ligands are lost in one main step, and the observed weight loss of 6.4% in the temperature range of 195–292 °C is in good agreement with the calculated value of 5.94%, and the framework starts to collapse when the temperature is higher than 292 °C. In the temperature range of 327–512 °C, compound 3 shows a weight loss of 53.0%, which may be due to the decomposition of one (H3tepa)I3 unit per formula (theoretical value of 55.42%). TGA of 4 revealed a weight loss of 47.5% before 431 °C, which corresponds to the removal of one (H2aep)I2 unit per formula (calcd: 45.51%). The observed total weight loss of 34.4% for 5 between 246 and 371 °C corresponds to the removal of one (Et22,2′-bipy)I2 unit per formula (theoretical value of 33.68%). For compound 6, a weight loss of about 35.4% occurs between 333 to 570 °C which is ascribed to the removal of one (Et2dpe)I2 unit per formula (calcd: 34.90%).
4. Conclusion
In summary, by introducing two types of SDAs, aliphatic amines and aromatic organic species with different structural and physical features, into inorganic iodoplumbates, we obtained six iodoplumbate hybrids which show 0–2D structures with great structural diversity. The comparative study discloses the different contributions of aliphatic amines and aromatic organic species to the crystal and electronic structures as well as properties of iodoplumbate hybrids. Of particular interest is that compounds 1–4 exhibit interesting water induced structure conversions, while 5 and 6 are stable in water and can be used as heterogeneous photocatalysts for dye wastewater treatment under visible light irradiation. All the results of the comparative study help a lot toward the controllable synthesis of metal halide hybrids with different structures and functions.
