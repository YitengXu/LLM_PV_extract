    , Accepted 13th November 2012First published on 13th November 2012AbstractHierarchically structured mesoporous TiO2 beads (HS-TBs), which are used as photoelectrodes in highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), were prepared by an electrostatic spray (e-spray) technique. To prepare different sized HS-TBs, the electric field and the concentration of TiO2 particles were carefully controlled, because they are critical factors in preparing size-controlled TiO2 beads. Four different HS-TBs were formulated with average diameters of 250, 450, 700, and 1200 nm as high-quality photoelectrodes for use in DSCs. In this study, we found that the zero-dimensional HS-TBs were the most promising photoelectrode for DSCs due to enhanced charge collection efficiency and better penetration of electrolytes through relatively large pores among the HS-TBs. The HS-TBs were characterized by intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, and electrochemical analysis. The conversion efficiency of HS-TB photoelectrodes improved with increasing bead size due to the enhanced electron transport through electrodes. The present HS-TB cells exhibit a noticeable improvement in the overall efficiency: maximum 9.54% (1200 nm) versus 5.83% for the reference cell made of a TiO2 nanocrystalline film.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted significant attention since 1991. DSCs have several advantages over other types of solar cells, such as low cost fabrication, cell-color tunability and transparency.1 The technical development and scientific investigation of DSCs in recent years have realized high power conversion efficiencies (PCE >12.3% with porphyrin-sensitizer), which have been achieved with nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrodes.2 However, further improvement in the photon-to-current conversion efficiency of DSCs still remains a challenge.
The photoelectrodes, which play an important role in DSCs, transfer excited electrons from photo-excited dyes to an electron collector and concurrently allow electrolytes to diffuse to the absorbed dyes to reduce the number of dyes returning to the neutral ground state. Therefore, the photoelectrode performance depends critically on the nature of the electrode material, the particle size, the surface morphology, the electrode surface area, the degree of dye adsorption, and the electron transport rate.3–5 Typically, nanocrystalline TiO2 (nc-TiO2) particles have been used to fabricate a porous TiO2 layer with a high surface area and a nanoporous structure that is easily penetrated by the electrolyte. The nc-TiO2 particles (ca. 20 nm in diameter) enhanced the dye adsorption per unit surface area and the exciton generation due to the relatively large surface area of the particles. The PCE does not, however, depend only on the surface area. Grain boundaries and defects on the particle surfaces can delay electron transport and increase undesirable charge recombination. Competition between the transport and recombination of excited electrons in DSCs has been a bottleneck for improving the PCE.6–8
One strategy for improving the PCE is to use one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructures that provide a direct electron transport pathway that facilitates the rapid collection of photogenerated electrons from the excited dye to the charge collecting substrate, thereby decreasing the degree of charge recombination. To this end, a variety of one-dimensional metal oxide TiO2 shapes were tested,9 yielding PCEs of 0.5% for nanowires,10 2.9% for nanotubes,11 and 7.29% for nanorods.12 However, such one-dimensional nanostructures appeared to have insufficient surface area for promoting efficient photon conversion.
To overcome the problems associated with the 1-D structures, several groups have tested zero-dimensional (0-D) hierarchically structured morphologies for use in DSCs.6,13–16 The 0-D hierarchically structured TiO2 beads (HS-TBs) were suggested to be the most promising photoelectrodes for DSCs because (1) they enhanced the surface area available for dye adsorption; (2) electron transport was rapid due to a reduced number of grain boundaries; and (3) the electrolyte sufficiently penetrated into the relatively large pores among the HS-TBs. Minuscule internal pores formed inside the HS-TBs improved electron transport through the TiO2 beads. In addition to micropores, large external pores can also be formed via the formation of interstitial voids among the spherical structures. Such pores were important for electrolyte diffusion, as shown in Scheme 1. The mesoporous spherical structures were expected to provide both great electron transport and efficient electrolyte diffusion simultaneously. An additional advantage was provided by the higher degree of light scattering in the long wavelength region from the submicron-sized structures. Another approach to enhance the PCE is to increase the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) influenced by dye loading and light scattering at the TiO2 film via optical enhancement effects. Usami,17 Ferber and Luther,18 and Rothenberger et al.19 theoretically demonstrated that the optical absorption by a TiO2 nanocrystalline film could be increased by admixing large TiO2 particles in an optimal volume ratio. Therefore, HS-TBs, with a size-tunable diameter, can be a new and possibly better candidate for photon-related applications, such as DSCs, photocatalysis, and photonic crystals, due to their relatively high refractive index and bead size that is comparable to the visible wavelength.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of fabrication of photoanodes by using an electrospray process. 
Our HS-TBs were prepared using an electrostatic spray (e-spray) technique for photoelectrodes in DSCs. The e-spray technique is an inexpensive and a simple process for directly depositing thin films from a colloidal solution. The technique can be applied widely in modern material technologies, microelectronics, nanotechnology, industries in which ceramic powders or polymer powders are deposited, and TiO2 electrodes for use in DSCs.20–22 We note that it is not so simple to obtain hierarchical structures using multi-step processes, such as a sol–gel method, solvothermal reactions, hydrolysis, or the electrospinning of nanorods. These processes are not practical or cost-effective for the large-scale production of DSC modules.
During e-spray deposition, also known as induction or conduction charging, droplets can be charged during atomization under the atomization-mechanical forces in the presence of an electric field applied between the colloidal solution and the depositing substrate.20,23 The electric field produces an electric charge on the liquid surface, and the charge is carried away from the surface by droplets detaching from the jet. The advantage of the e-spray technique is that droplets are highly charged, up to a fraction of the Rayleigh limit. The Rayleigh limit is the magnitude of charge on a drop that is required to overcome the surface tension that would lead to drop fission. The magnitude of the charge on a droplet is given by the equation, QR = 2π(16σlε0r3)1/2, where σl is the liquid surface tension, ε0 is the dielectric permittivity of free space, and r is the droplet radius.20
The charged droplet deposition efficiency is usually much higher than that of uncharged droplets, which can improve adhesion between the material and the substrate. The e-spray process is generally performed at room temperature under atmospheric pressure. Although e-spraying is a highly efficient coating and painting process, little attention has been devoted to applying it in the field of thin film electronic device fabrication.24
Here, we describe the preparation of size-tunable HS-TBs with average diameters of 250 nm, 450 nm, 700 nm, and 1200 nm to study the size effect on the charge collection efficiency of DSCs. The electric field and the TiO2 concentration were carefully controlled, because they are major factors in preparing the size-controlled TiO2 beads. The tightly inter-connected TiO2 nanoparticles inside HS-TBs significantly enhance the electron transport in photoanodes. Moreover, the HS-TBs were submicron-sized, and, thus, can function as efficient light harvesting agents, whereas the nanoparticles provided the necessary mesoporous nanostructure and a large internal surface area. Consequently, the charge collection and light harvesting efficiency dominate the crucial factor for improving the photocurrent density in our DSCs. An overall power conversion efficiency of up to 9.54% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 795 mV, short-circuit currents (JSC) of 17.9 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 67% was achieved using a 1200 nm beads. This PCE far exceeded the value of 5.21% for a TiO2 nanocrystalline photoelectrode.
Experimental section
Materials
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated conductive glass had a sheet resistance of 8 Ω sq−1 and a glass thickness of 2.3 mm. Commercially available TiO2 powder (P25, Degussa, 70% anatase, and 30% rutile, particle size 21 nm) was used to prepare working electrodes. Ruthenium complex dye (Ru535-bis-TBA, Solaronix SA), cis-bis(isothiocyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium, generally known as N-719, was purified using ion exchange column chromatography. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII, 99%, C-TRI Co. Ltd., Korea), iodine (I2, 99.99+%, Aldrich), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 99% Aldrich), guanidinium thiocyanate (GSCN, >99.9%, Aldrich), 3-methoxypropionitrile (>99.0%, TCI), and chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6, Aldrich) were used as purchased without further purification.
Preparation of HS-TB photoelectrodes and characterization
The 1–15 wt/v% P-25 (Degussa) nanocrystalline TiO2 was dispersed in ethanol using an Ultra Apex Mill (Model UAM-015, Kotobuki). The dispersed solution was loaded into a plastic syringe, which was connected to a high voltage power supply (BERTAN SERIES 205B). The dispersed P25 solution was electrosprayed directly onto a conducting FTO substrate (10 cm × 10 cm). To prepare HS-TBs with a diameter of about 200–1500 nm, the electric field and the concentration of TiO2 nanocrystalline were carefully controlled. The feed rate was controlled using a syringe pump operated at 20–30 μL min−1. A uniform film thickness over a large area was maintained by placing the nozzle and substrate on a motion control system with a micro-processor. After the e-spray process, the HS-TB film underwent the pressing process under the pressure of 12 MPa at 120 °C and the sintering process at 500 °C for 30 min to enhance an inter-connection amongst the HS-TBs.
The TiO2 nanoparticle-based photoelectrodes were prepared using the doctor-blade method. Specifically, the TiO2 colloidal solution (P25, Degussa) was spread onto a FTO substrate using a doctor-blade coater. The porosity was controlled by adding 20 wt% poly (ethylene glycol) (Aldrich, average Mw = 104 g mol−1) and 20 wt% poly (ethylene oxide) (Aldrich, average Mw = 105 g mol−1) to the TiO2 colloidal solution.
The surface morphology of the e-sprayed HS-TB electrode was investigated using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4100) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, FEI Tecnai G2) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 keV. The surface area and pore distribution properties were measured using a Sorptomatic 1990. The surface area properties were determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore volume and size distributions were determined using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method applied to the adsorption branches of the isotherms. The surface concentration of dye on the TiO2 electrode was measured by desorbing the dye into a 0.1 N NaOH solution prepared in distilled water, and the absorption spectra of the desorbed-dye solutions were measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard 8452A). Diffuse reflection and specular transmittance spectra of the resulting TiO2 films were collected on a Cray 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer with an intergrating sphere (Internal DRA-2500).
Device fabrication
After post-treatment with 0.05 M TiCl4 of sintered TiO2 films for 20 min at 80 °C, the TiO2 films were rinsed with water and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed into a purified 3 × 10−4 M cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N′-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4-carboxylic acid-4′-tetrabutylammonium carboxylate) ruthenium(II) (N719, Solaronix) in ethanol for 15 h at room temperature.
The counter electrode was prepared by drilling FTO plates using a microdrill, washing the plates using a 0.1 M HCl ethanol solution, then subsequently cleaning the plates in an ultrasonic bath in water and ethanol over 15 min. A Pt counter electrode was prepared by drop-casting a 5 mM H2PtCl6 isopropyl alcohol solution onto the washed FTO plates, followed by sintering at 400 °C for 20 min under ambient air conditions. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes were rinsed with ethanol and dried under a nitrogen flow. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes were assembled and sealed with the counter electrode using a thermal adhesive film (Surlyn, DuPont 1702, 25 μm thick) as a spacer to produce sandwich-type cells. The non-volatile electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.05 M iodine (I2), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GSCN), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in a solvent containing 3-methoxy propionitrile. An electrolyte solution was introduced through a hole drilled in the counter electrode. Finally, the holes were sealed using a hot-melt film and a cover glass.
Photovoltaic and photoelectrical measurements
The photovoltaic properties of the DSCs were measured using an AM 1.5 solar simulator positioned between the sample and a 450 W Xe lamp. The intensity of the simulated light was calibrated using a Si reference solar cell equipped with a BK5 filter to approximate AM 1.5 global radiation. The photovoltaic characteristics of the DSCs were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cells and measuring the photocurrent generated using a Keithley Model 2400 source-meter. The photovoltaic performance was measured using black tape with an aperture area of 0.35 cm2. The incident PCE (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength over the range 350–800 nm using a specially designed IPCE system for dye-sensitized solar cells (PV measurement, Inc.). A 75 W xenon lamp was used as the light source to generate a monochromatic beam. The light source was calibrated using a NIST-calibrated silicon photodiode as a standard. IPCE values were collected at a low chopping speed of 5 Hz. The electrical impedance spectra were measured using an impedance analyzer (Solatron 1260) under an open-circuit potential and AM 1.5 full sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), over the frequency range 0.1–105 Hz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. The impedance parameters were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using Z-plot software. The electron transport rate was measured by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS). A diode laser with variable power and modulation control (Coherent, 10 mW, 635 nm) was used as the light source in these studies. Illumination was always applied incident on the working electrode side of the solar cells. The intensity was measured using a calibrated Si photodiode. The output of the solar cell was connected directly to the frequency response analyzer (FRA, Solatron 1260 Impedance/Gain-Phase Analyzer). IMPS was performed by connecting the solar cell via a potentiostat amplifier (EG&G PAR 273) to the FRA. During the IMPS measurements, the cell was illuminated with sinusoidally modulated light having a small AC component (10% or less of the DC component).
Results and discussion
Size-tunable HS-TBs were prepared by the electro-static spray technique (e-spray). To obtain HS-TBs with four different average diameters of 250 nm (TB1), 450 nm (TB7), 700 nm (TB10), and 1200 nm (TB15), the electric field and the concentration (1–15 wt/v% in ethanol) of TiO2 particles were carefully controlled, because they are critical factors in preparing the size-controlled TiO2 beads. Then, the dispersed TiO2 solution was directly electrosprayed onto the conducting FTO substrate.

Scheme 1 illustrates the e-spray method used to prepare the HS-TBs.
In order to study the size dependency of the charge collection efficiency, the HS-TB films with various diameters were prepared by using the e-spray method. Fig. 1 shows typical SEM images of film samples after sintering at 500 °C for 30 min. The sintering process did not appreciably change the overall shapes and diameters of the HS-TBs. The larger diameter HS-TBs improved the packing density among nanoparticles due to the lower quantity of solvent contained in the droplets during the e-spray process. Fig. 2 shows a plot of the HS-TB diameter as a function of the TiO2 concentration during the e-spray process. Usually, the liquid droplet surface tension is inversely proportional to the concentration of the inorganic material contained therein.25 Accordingly, the diameters of the droplets were proportional to the concentration of TiO2 nanocrystalline particles (r3 = QR2(64π2σlε0)−1). Thus, the HS-TB diameter increased gradually proportional to the TiO2 concentration in the range of 1–15 wt/v%.
 Fig. 1  The SEM images of various HS-TBs were selectively controlled by the dispersed TiO2 concentration during the e-spray process. The HS-TBs with average diameters of 250 nm (A), 450 nm (B), 700 nm (C), and 1200 nm (D) were prepared by changing the TiO2 concentration of 1, 7, 10, and 15 wt/v% in ethanol, respectively. Each scale bar of inset images indicates 500 nm.

Nitrogen adsorption measurements were conducted to characterize the surface area and pore size distribution, as shown in Fig. 3. The physical properties of a series of HS-TBs are listed in Table 1. The specific surface areas of TB1, TB7, TB10, and T15 were estimated to be 60.1, 64.3, 66.8, and 71.1 m2 g−1, respectively, as obtained using the BET measurement technique. The pore volume was derived from the BJH model, yielding 0.25, 0.28, 0.30, and 0.31 cm3 g−1 for TB1, TB7, TB10, and TB15, respectively. The larger pore volumes of the HS-TB samples suggested that the electrolyte easily penetrated into the HS-TB photoelectrode. The effects by different sized HS-TBs on the conversion efficiency of photon to current generation will be further discussed in the following section.

The SEM image in Fig. 4A shows a cross-sectional image of monolayered HS-TB film consisting of mesoporous TiO2 beads prior to pressing under the pressure of 12 MPa at 120 °C and an annealing process at 500 °C for 30 min. The uniform bead shape is apparent from the bottom to the top of the layer. The thickness of as e-sprayed TiO2 layer was 20 μm, whereas the thickness of pressed TiO2 film was optimized to be 13 μm for highly efficient DSCs as described in inset of Fig. 4A. This process is essential to enhance the connectivity among the HS-TBs and also the adhesion onto the FTO substrate, controlling the pore volume of the final HS-TB electrodes which influences the electron pathway and the electrolyte infiltration among the HS-TB layers. As shown in Fig. 4B, the TiO2 film retained intact morphology during the conventional thermal annealing process because the e-spray process proceeded using dispersed TiO2 solution that did not contain any polymers that are frequently used in conventional paste methods (for example, doctor blading or screen-printing). Thus, the surface of the e-sprayed HS-TB film was uniform and without cracks unlike the surface prepared by a paste method. Post-treatment with a diluted TiCl4 solution enhanced the external connections among the HS-TBs, as shown in Fig. 4D, indicating that electrons injected from the dyes could be efficiently transported from the top to the bottom surface of the HS-TB film. The photocurrent conversion density was thereby significantly enhanced. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Fig. 4C and E show a tightly inter-connected nc-TiO2 particle network forming a set of well-defined spherical structures. These results suggest that the defect level and the number of grain boundaries must be minimized to suppress electron loss by recombination or back-reaction processes and to enhance the electron transport rate.

The photovoltaic properties using various TiO2 photoelectrode are summarized in Fig. 5A and Table 1. The highest efficiency of 8.54% was achieved with the TB15 cell, compared with 8.14% for the TB10, 7.78% for the TB7 and 7.58% for the TB1 cells, respectively. The photocurrent density of DSCs is determined by the efficiencies of (i) light harvesting, (ii) charge injection, and (iii) charge collection.26 The light harvesting efficiency is a function of the dye loading, which in turn is correlated with the surface area of the photoelectrodes. As shown in Table 1, the amounts of dye loading on the TiO2 surface were 0.79 × 10−10 for the TB1, 1.13 × 10−10 for the TB7, 1.27 × 10−10 for the TB10, and 1.40 × 10−10 mol g−1 for the TB15, respectively, which reasonably support that the TB15 film provides the highest dye loading and optical enhancement, resulting in a noticeable improvement by 20% in JSC amongst the HS-TB based devices. Futhermore, the dye loading of the HS-TB film was higher than that of the NS-NP film (0.40 × 10−10 mol g−1). This is a considerable result that the JSC value of the HS-TB based DSCs is higher than the value of the NS-NP based DSCs reported in a previous study.6 The incident detailed information on the light harvesting of the DSCs is shown in Fig. 5C. The quantum efficiencies of all cells prepared with N719 dye were maximized at about 550 nm. The maximum efficiency is 75% for the TB15-based DSC. This enhancement was attributed to the surface coverage and the scattering effect of the submicrometer-sized HS-TBs. The dye-loading capacity of each photoelectrode was reflected in the corresponding IPCE results in the short and middle wavelength region of 400–600 nm, whereas the light scattering efficiency can be explained by the IPCE value in the longer wavelength region from 600 to 800 nm.

In addition, the high photocurrent density of the DSCs based on the HS-TB film, which varied as a function of the diameter could depend on the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) because the charge injection efficiency from N719 dye to the TiO2 approached unity. The ηcc value for each DSC is determined according to the relationship; ηcc = 1 − (cL2D−1τr−1) where c is a constant, L is the film thickness of the photoelectrode, D is the diffusion coefficient and τr is the charge recombination lifetime.27,28 The frequency of the incident light modulation was ranged from 100 to 0.1 Hz in our experiment. The value of D as a function of the incident light intensity is plotted in Fig. 6A. The value of D was estimated from the electron transport time (τct) at specific photon flux, respectively, (τct = 1/2πfmin(IMPS) as shown in Fig. 6B) obtained by intensity modulation photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS).29,30 In a previous study, the values of D for the HS-TB based DSCs were higher than that of the NS-NP based DSCs.6 This was attributed to the lower junction density of the 0-D nanostructures, although much higher pore volume offered additional tortuous routes for charge transport. The intrinsically superior charge transport properties of the tightly connected TiO2 particles-in-bead relied on a “highway” network in the HS-TBs to compensate for the longer transport path through the highly porous TiO2 layers, which is beneficial for electrolyte penetration. The larger diameters of the HS-TB further improved the diffusion coefficient due to the enhanced intra-particle packing density within the TiO2 beads and the supressed junction densities among the external HS-TBs.

Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of DSCs by the elctrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range from 1 × 10−1 to approximately 1 × 105 Hz (C) (: fitted line) and (D). 
Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis has been regarded as a useful tool for investigating the kinetics of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes occurring in DSCs.27,31 Generally, three characteristic frequency peaks can be obtained from the EIS spectra when DSCs were measured at the open-circuit conditions under light illumination. The low-frequency peak (in the mHz range) is attributed mainly to the Nernst diffusion of redox materials within the electrolyte. The middle-frequency peak (in the 10–100 Hz region) is related to the transport process of the injected electrons within TiO2 porous films and the charge transfer process of the injected electrons at the interfaces between TiO2 and the electrolyte/dye coating. The high-frequency peak (in the kHz range) is ascribed to the charge transfer process at the interfaces between the redox couple and the platinized counter electrode (RPt).
The middle-frequency semicircles in Fig. 6C can be fitted to a charge-transfer resistance (RCT), which is shunt-wound with a constant phase element (CPE) instead of the chemical capacitance as stated in the previous report, and both of them are connected in series with a transport resistance (RW) of the injected electrons within the TiO2 film. The fitted RCT, RW, and τr values for the TiO2 electrodes possessed with different diameters are summarized in Table 2 (fitting the experimental data according to the equivalent circuit model as shown in inset image of Fig. 6C).34 The decreasing RW at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface for HS-TB and NS-NP electrodes might be attributed to the inter-connectivity of TiO2 nanoparticles within the TiO2 film. The TiO2 nanoparticles within the NS-NP film possessed lower inter-connectivity due to eliminated polymer space during the sintering process. Moreover, the RW values decrease with increasing diameters of HS-TB, which implies that the larger packing density of TiO2 nanoparticles in HS-TB reduces the transport resistance and then promotes the charge-transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Kern et al. proposed a modified model concerning the transfer and recombination of the injected electrons in the TiO2 electrode.31 Bulk traps can only exchange electrons with the conduction band of TiO2, which significantly affects the electron transport. However, the surface states can not only exchange electrons with the conduction band but also recombine electrons to the oxidized species in electrolyte which critically enhances the recombination lifetime. Therefore, the electron transport was strongly associated with the number of bulk traps which can be regarded as the grain boundary amongst the TiO2 nanoparticles. As a result, the lower RW value of TB15 compared to the TB1 based DSC was explained by tightly inter-connected TiO2 nanoparticles suppressing the grain boundaries within TiO2 bead after the sintering process, which corresponded to the IMPS result and the previous study. The τr values were obtained by using the EIS analysis. The τr values were calculated from the relationship of τr = 1/2πfmax(EIS), where fmax is the frequency at the maximum phase in the middle-frequency range in the bode phase plots (frequency vs. phase angle).31–33 In our earlier work, τr was approximately two times longer for DSCs prepared using similar HS-TBs in comparison with the value for DSCs prepared using NS-NPs, which is in agreement with other reported results; however, the EIS results shown in Fig. 6D show that larger HS-TB diameters yielded comparable electron lifetimes. This was attributed to the recombination lifetime of TiO2, and triiodide (I3−) was not affected apparently by the diameters of HS-TBs because primary TiO2 nanoparticles used to prepare HS-TBs possessed similar crystallinity and density of surface states. The latter arises mainly from the surface atoms on the TiO2 nanoparticles, which dominates the recombination processes with oxide elements.

Therefore, the enhancement in ηcc, on moving from TB1- to TB15-based DSCs, was mainly attributed to the superior electron diffusion coefficient. This is due to the fact that our 0-D HS-TBs presented the lower density of junctions in which typically charge trapping events occur. Thus, the enhanced charge collection efficiency resulting from the large diffusion coefficient provided the major contribution to JSC of the TB15-based DSC. This result corresponds to the real phase photocurrent from the IMPS data measured at the same wavelength (445 nm) and the incident photon flux of 4.2 × 1016 cm−2 s−1 as shown in Fig. 6B.
As the next step, the amount of diffusely scattered light as a result of a beam of irradiation on the film can be quantified by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. As a comparison, the diffuse reflection spectra of the TiO2 films composed with NS-NPs and HS-TBs, respectively, were displayed as shown in Fig. 7A. The reflectance capacities of HS-TB films were 70–80% in the visible range, which were much higher than the NS-NP film, indicating that the incident light was significantly scattered within the film of HS-TBs due to the comparable bead size to the wavelength of visible light. The diffuse reflectance spectra provide a new aspect after sensitization with dyes as shown in Fig. 7B, because they are strongly affected by the amount of adsorbed dyes. The reflectance of the sensitized films is drastically reduced in the short wavelength region from 400 to 500 nm, but is crucially influenced in the long wavelength region (from 600 to 800 nm). Although the NS-NP sample adsorbs the smallest amount of dye, the reflectance of the NS-NP sample showed slightly less reflectance in the wavelength region from 450 nm to 600 nm compared to all other HS-TB samples. This might be attributed to the strong-light scattering effect of HS-TBs as shown in Fig. 7A. These aspects are in coincidence with the IPCE results shown in Fig. 5C. Thus, it is sure that the light harvesting efficiency of HS-TB films contributed both to the high dye loading and the optical scattering effect in the long wavelength region, thereby increasing JSC and the power conversion efficiency.

The transmittance spectra of the dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† Both the NS-NP film and the TB1 displayed 2% transmittance in the short wavelength region of 400–500 nm and much higher transmittance up to 5–30% in the longer wavelength region of 700–800 nm. The transmittance values of the HS-TB films (TB7, TB10, TB15) were almost completely attenuated in the visible region (less than 1%) due to light adsorption by dye molecules and light scattering effects. As a consequence, nearly all the incident light was absorbed by the dye molecules in the TiO2 films to generate photocurrent. Moreover, increasing the diameters of HS-TBs further reduced the transmittance due to the light scattering effect in the long wavelength region.
Finally, the performances of the DSCs were improved by optimizing the thickness (14 μm) and the post-treatment of TB15 photoelectrodes. The PCE of up to 9.54% was achieved with a VOC of 795 mV, a JSC of 17.9 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.67. This value was much higher than 5.83% obtained with a VOC of 706 mV, a JSC of 12.5 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.66 for the TiO2 nanocrystalline photoelectrode as shown in Fig. 8. The present study describes a simple method of preparing size-tunable HS-TBs for coating photoelectrodes to be used in photoelectronic cells. Simply formulated, the HS-TBs provided a “highway” network to facilitate the charge transport process within the photoelectrode and improved the penetration of the electrolyte solution that plays an important role in improving the photon-to-current generation in DSCs. The multiple functionalities of the HS-TBs suggest a new strategy for improving the performances of photoelectronic devices.

Conclusions
In summary, the HS-TBs with tunable sizes (250–1200 nm) were prepared simply by tuning the conditions of the e-spray processes. The HS-TB sizes could be selectively controlled over the range of 250–1200 nm by varying the TiO2 concentration. A gradually increasing relationship was found between the bead diameter and the TiO2 concentration. In this study, we found that the charge collection and light harvesting efficiency improved with increasing diameters of HS-TB. It is dominated by the packing density of TiO2 nanoparticles-in-bead and size-tunablility of diameters compared to the visible light. Moreover, relatively large pores among the HS-TBs sufficiently affect the penetration of electrolyte. Consequentially, optimal multi-functional effects were found in the TB15-based DSC, yielding a maximum PCE of 9.54%, which can be suggested as the most promising photoelectrode for DSCs. During the e-spray process, the TiO2 photoelectrodes were formed using a binder-free TiO2 dispersion. Therefore, this process is a suitable approach to formulate the flexible DSCs.
