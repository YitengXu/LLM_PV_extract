    , Accepted 15th October 2019First published on 21st October 2019AbstractThe exploration for true electrocatalytic reactions at organic conducting polymer electrodes, including chemisorption of a reactant and desorption of a product, is receiving renewed interest due to the profound implications it could have on low-cost large area electrochemical energy technology. Here, we finalize the debate about the ability of an organic electrode, more specifically poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), to be an electrocatalyst for hydrogen production. This paper proves and covers fundamental studies of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on PEDOT films. Both theory based on DFT (Density Functional Theory) and experimental studies using electrochemical techniques and operando mass spectrometry suggest a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism for the actual HER on PEDOT. It is shown that PEDOT reaches an exchange current density comparable to that of metals (i.e. Cu, Ni, and Au) and in addition does not form passivating oxide layers or suffer from chemical corrosion in acidic media. Finally, an electrolyzer stack using the organic polymer electrode demonstrates HER performance in real applications.
Introduction
The importance of H2 as an energy carrier in future society is not restricted to serving us as a high energy density fuel for transportation, but is an enabler for large scale energy storage in order to e.g. reduce the mismatch between availability of electrical energy, generated from power plants (sun or wind), and societal demand for electricity. Today, H2 is produced by steam-methane reforming:1 CH4(g) + H2O(g) → CO(g) + 3H2(g). The extraction of fossil gas is expected to reach a peak, given that in the future H2 will most likely be produced, in a cost-competitive manner, via water electrolysis. Water electrolysis is the electrochemical decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen gas driven by an electric current: 2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g). A vision for green future H2 power plants is that the electricity required to drive the actual water electrolysis should come from solar, wind or other renewable sources converted into electricity. An advantage of water electrolysis is the purity of the resulting H2 gas. H2 obtained from methane reforming needs to be purified to remove carbon monoxide which poisons the Pt catalyst in the fuel cells.2
H2 production from water is realized in a device termed an electrolyzer. There are two main electrolyzer technologies available on the market, the alkaline and the proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, respectively. An electrolyzer is based on two catalytic metal electrodes and an electrolytic membrane. Water electrolysis is then simply obtained by applying a voltage (1.23 V + overvoltage) between the two electrodes. The electrodes are composed of catalysts to minimize the overvoltage, which represents one of the major losses in energy efficiency. In an acidic medium, the cathode catalyzes the half-reaction 2H+(aq) + 2e− → H2(g) and the anode catalyzes the oxidation 2H2O(l) → O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e−. Today, commercial electrolyzer efficiencies typically reach the range of about 62–82% and 67–82% for the alkaline and PEM types, respectively.3 One of the key features that limit the widespread use of electrolyzers as a main technology for H2 production is the need for noble metal catalysts (e.g. platinum) in the electrolyzer electrodes. Noble metals are extremely expensive, because of their low natural abundance. Hence, the search for platinum group metal (PGM)-free heterogeneous catalysts4–13 for H2-producing electrolyzers is thus highly desired.
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performed via aqueous proton reduction is considered a gold-standard in general electrocatalysis, as originated by the centennial work by J. Tafel.14 On a Pt electrocatalyst, the HER occurs via a two-step mechanism.15 The fast first step is a proton electrosorption discharge leading to an adsorbed H atom (Volmer reaction): H+ + e− → Hads. The rate determining step is the following recombination of two adsorbed atoms (Tafel reaction): Hads + Hads → H2, or an electrochemical desorption step (Heyrovsky reaction): Hads + H+ + e− → H2. A true electrocatalytic reaction implies chemisorption of the reactant and desorption of the product. The rate of HER of various metals has often been related to the energetics of the chemisorption of Hads. The exchange current density of the HER spans from 10−9–10−8 A cm−2 for Pb, Zn, and Sn to 10−4–10−3 A cm−2 for Pt, Ir, and Rh.16
In the search for new earth abundant electrocatalyst materials, one mysterious discovery was made in 2010 by Winther-Jensen et al. who proposed that organic conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), can serve as an electrocatalyst for the HER.17 They reported that a PEDOT layer does not promote the HER. However, when PEDOT is blended with a copolymer, PEG (poly(ethylene glycol)), the resulting conducting polymer film “PEDOT–PEG” deposited on a Ti electrode displays a clear signal of H2 evolution that surprisingly also enhances with time. This discovery was attributed to the ability of PEG to coordinate protons and thereby to bring them into close proximity of the PEDOT, thus allowing the reduction to occur and hydrogen to be produced. But soon after, Bard et al. conducted a study of the same polymer layer PEDOT–PEG on Au and Ti and suggested that the polymer film was porous and that its porosity increased with time when the electrode was immersed in solution, while the hydrogen evolution catalysis then takes place on the conducting substrate beneath the polymer rather than on or within the PEDOT–PEG film.18 Despite this intriguing debate, scientists went further and used PEDOT as a mixed ionic–electronic conducting matrix to embed inorganic catalytic nanoparticles (e.g. Pt–Pd,19,20 WS2,21 and V2Se922) to boost the HER. Hence, today it is still not clear if a conducting polymer such as PEDOT–PEG can be seen as an electrocatalyst for the HER or not. But recent studies pointed out that PEDOT–PEG has a semi-metallic nature.23,24 In order to truly be an electrocatalyst, a conducting polymer must adsorb a reactant on its surface and desorb a product, in a manner as has been demonstrated recently for the oxygen reduction reaction on PEDOT.25 Those last findings re-dynamize the debate about using conducting polymers as potential electrocatalysts for the HER.
In this report, we demonstrate that the PEDOT–PEG composite, coated on inert glass substrates, is conducting enough to truly generate H2, via the HER, in the cathodic regime without the need for any underlying metallic conducting layer. This truly demonstrates that conducting polymers are directly involved in the HER. Moreover, the onset potential of the HER is only 4 mV larger than the overpotential using a Pt electrode and the exchange current density reaches 10 μA cm−2, i.e. a larger current density than that achieved with transition metals (Cu, Ni, and Co), which thus demonstrates that a true electrocatalytic process is governing the HER. The electrocatalytic reaction was modelled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicating a possible two-step Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction pathway. Finally, we report the first electrolyzer including a polymer electrode to produce H2 with a rate reaching the same order of magnitude when compared with a Pt electrode.
Results and discussion
In order to investigate the HER on polymer electrodes made from the PEDOT–PEG polymer blend, we first synthesized PEDOT+OTf−via vapor phase polymerization, according to a recently published recipe,26 on glass substrates. PEDOT is a conjugated polymer that is oxidized during synthesis such that its π-electron system carries positive charges that are balanced by trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTf−) counterions. The electrode film was prepared by exposing a vapor of the EDOT monomer to a film made of a blend of the oxidant Fe(OTf)3 and the triblock copolymer PEG–PPG–PEG (poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)). The copolymer makes the film waxy and acts as a template for polymerization and film growth, thus promoting good packing of PEDOT chains27 by providing a “Structure-directed” growth, which also leads to a higher electrical conductivity.28 The polymerization is spontaneous and results in a functional electrode film that we here denote as “PEDOT–PEG”. Finally, the electrode sample is cleaned in a solution of HCl to remove iron salt from the electrode surface and bulk. The film thickness was estimated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and reached about 43 nm with a corresponding root mean square roughness of 16 nm (Fig. 1B) and its electrical conductivity was estimated using a four-point probe setup and it reaches a value of about 1200 S cm−1. At the molecular level, the charge carrier transport is promoted by the formation of local crystalline nanodomains, indicating metallic conductivity, composed of stacks of tens of PEDOT chains bound by interchain π–π interactions.29 The charge transport is then governed by thermally activated hopping between the crystalline nano-domains.30,31 On a macroscopic level, AFM images reveal a porous network of interconnected polymer filaments which provides a continuous pathway to conduct holes (Fig. 1B). Hence, the polymer film has an attractive morphology that provides a very large solid-electrolyte interface spontaneously structured at the nanoscale. Surface analysis of the polymer films, when exposed to air, was conducted using XPS (Fig. S1†) and reveals the absence of any oxide surface layer along the outermost surface structures of the polymer electrode. This is a significant difference with non-noble metals or inorganic semiconductors and it ensures a clean interface between the PEDOT–PEG electrode and the aqueous solution and its components. The absence of fluoride-associated XPS signals, originating from the initial counter-ion (trifluoromethanesulfonate, OTf), suggests an effective ion exchange during the washing step that then yields chloride-doped polymer films. The ratio between the thiophene sulfur content quantified from the S2p peak (Fig. S2†) and the content of chloride counter-ion (Cl 2p) gives an estimation of the polymer doping level of ca. 20%.

The conducting polymer film electrode, manufactured on glass, was placed in an aqueous electrolyte and was then polarized by applying a potential with respect to a reference electrode. A significant capacitive current was recorded when performing voltammetry measurements within the potential window of +0.3 V to +0.9 V (Fig. S4A†). This region of applied potential features a potential-independent (i.e. non-faradaic) current, which produces box-shaped voltammograms reminiscent of the mixed ionic–electronic conducting characteristics of the polymer electrodes, typically found in polymer supercapacitors.26 The capacitive current IC = CdV/dt is related to the charge-balancing process occurring between the polymer electrode (carrying electronic charges) and the electrolyte (transporting ions) on the applied potential ramp (dV/dt).
The electrical conductivity of PEDOT-based films, provided over a wide range of oxidation levels, enables the direct exploration of their electrocatalytic properties without the need for an additional conducting substrate. Importantly for the HER, the application of a negative bias voltage on the conducting polymer electrode, in an electrolyte environment, causes simultaneously both interior (i.e. through PEDOT chains) and heterogeneous electron transfer.
Firstly, the electroreduction process on the PEDOT+Cl− chains, upon negative polarization, leads to a progressive transition from a positively doped and highly conductive state to a dedoped, close to insulating state (PEDOT+Cl− + e− → PEDOT0 + Cl−). This is also evident from electrochromism experiments as the PEDOT film changes its color from bright blue to dark blue.32 This doped-to-dedoped semiconductor transition was characterized by resistometry and resulted in a rise in resistance of the PEDOT film (Fig. 2A). The normalized PEDOT film resistance was measured in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4), neutral (1.0 M KCl) and aprotic (0.1 M TEAP in I) solutions, with Pt and Ag/AgCl as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The doped-to-dedoped transition takes place at a potential of around −0.5 V. This potential, where the resistance increases, is at a relatively more negative potential than the actual onset of the HER. It might seem contradicting that an electrochemical reaction can take place at potentials where the resistance of the electrode (PEDOT) becomes high. However, a few factors must be taken into account: (i) thermodynamics (Nernst equation) requires that both doped and undoped forms coexist at any potential; (ii) the electrochemical doped-to-dedoped switching kinetics of conducting polymers is slow, which further increases the content of the conducting component during a cathodic potential scan;33 (iii) PEDOT in its neutral (dedoped) form is still a semiconductor that is able to transport electronic charge carriers; (iv) even non-conducting redox polymers can drive redox reactions at the solution interface.34 Surprisingly, our in situ resistometry measurement indicates that after the large increase of resistance due to the doped-to-dedoped transition, there is a partial re-doping of PEDOT when the HER takes place (Fig. S3†). Although we do not understand the mechanism in detail (which is beyond the scope of this article), we remind the reader that PEDOT is known to be partially doped by the action of protons35 and also that a cousin phenomenon, i.e. the doping of PEDOT at a negative bias upon the reduction reaction of O2, has been observed.36,37
 Fig. 2  Decoupling of interior and heterogeneous electron transfer on the semiconducting catalyst. Resistometry was performed on PEDOT–PEG-modified electrodes in nitrogen-saturated neutral (1.0 M KCl), acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and aprotic (0.1 M TEAP in ACN) electrolytes (A). The resistance is normalized to 1 at a potential of +1.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry was performed in 1.0 M KCl (B) and 0.5 M H2SO4 (C) electrolytes (scan rate 5 mV s−1). The bright blue dashed line in (B) represents the cyclic voltammogram on the bare glass substrate. 
Secondly, a negative potential generally leads to the occurrence of technology- and energy-relevant reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction and HER by means of heterogeneous electron transfer. The linear ramp of negative potential [0.2 V to −1.0 V] applied to the PEDOT–PEG films leads to a linear increase of recorded reduction current, typical of the HER (Fig. 2B). Here, the increase of negative potential corresponds to the rise of the Fermi energy of electrons located within the electrode phase and causes a heterogeneous faradaic transfer of electrons to reduce protons, from the aqueous solution, to form molecular hydrogen. From visual inspection we also indeed observe the appearance of gas bubbles on the electrode surface (Fig. 1C). Note that the HER current level in Fig. S4A† is low because of the neutral pH of the electrolyte solution (the latter was chosen to visualize the capacitive current contribution IC of the electrode), while in Fig. 2B the faradaic HER current level is relatively much larger, promoted by an acidic electrolyte.
The soft and nano-porous character of the PEDOT–PEG film seems to have a major impact on the HER-associated currents. As consecutive voltammetry cycles are applied to the PEDOT–PEG electrode, the HER current increases by ∼15 times (6th cycle) (Fig. 2C). We hypothesize that the enhancement of the voltammetric response reflects an increase of the effective surface area (porosity), which makes the electrode bulk, to a greater extent, participate in heterogeneous electron transfer. Furthermore, we believe that this phenomenon, to some extent, is also assisted by the fact that the polymer swells due to the formation of intercalated H2 gas. This phenomenon is also accompanied by a change in the mechanism that limits the measured current, as a more negative voltage is applied, from mass transport through the film to heterogeneous electron transfer, which is evident from the plateau- and tail-shaped voltammograms, respectively (Fig. 2C). This is typical of the electrochemistry performed on conducting polymer films.17,38 For the wide range of potentials investigated, there was no sign of limitation from mass transport on stabilized HER currents and no effect of electrolyte agitation. Moreover, the role of the copolymer should not be neglected. As was reported before,17 the coordination between the cation species (i.e. proton) and PEG moiety facilitates the cationic transport and thus the proton reduction on PEDOT film.
It is important to measure the effect of pH on the HER threshold potential and current density in order to understand the underlying reaction mechanism and further integration to realize an electrolyzer. Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) operate with pure water as the medium. Going from acidic to more neutral pH does not significantly affect the electrical conductivity of the PEDOT–PEG electrode (Fig. S4B†). Increasing the pH of the electrolyte implies a lower proton reactant concentration, which then results in lower HER rates (from −0.342 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V, pH = 0.4 to −0.015 mA cm−2 at −0.6 V, pH = 4.7), as illustrated in Fig. 3A. Like in all electrochemical reactions that involves protons, the redox potential is expected to depend on pH according to the Nernst equation , where E is the equilibrium potential, E0′ is the formal potential, R is the gas constant, F is the Faraday number, n is the number of electrons transferred per reaction event, and [H2] and [H+] are the concentration of each species, respectively. Although cyclic voltammetry is not a steady state method, we clearly observe a Nernstian shift of the threshold voltage with a slope of 47 mV per unit for PEDOT–PEG and 43 mV per unit with a Pt electrode (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the apparent onset potential of the HER at the PEDOT–PEG electrode is only shifted by 4 mV as compared to a Pt electrode, suggesting a decent overall catalytic effect. The presence of a Nernstian shift also indicates the establishment of an equilibrium between proton reduction (HER) and the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on the PEDOT surface.

(C) IR-compensated steady-state polarization curves obtained on the PEDOT–PEG-modified GCE (rotating disk electrode, 900 rpm) in electrolytes (0.5 M H2SO4) of different pH values adjusted with NaOH (pH 0.4, 1.1, 2.1, and 3.6 as red, green, blue and magenta symbols, respectively; oxidation and reduction currents as open and filled symbols, respectively). 
The electrochemical kinetics of the HER on PEDOT–PEG was evaluated by steady-state current measurements (Fig. 3C). Here, we choose to utilize a thin PEDOT–PEG film on a conducting substrate (glassy carbon electrode, GCE) since this architecture ensures that the polymer film resistance has no significant effect on the current levels recorded. Measurement of steady-state currents at different polarization states enables the monitoring of both HER- and HOR-assigned negative and positive currents, respectively. The negative polarizations are characterized by a rise of the current corresponding to the HER, while the positive polarizations display a potential-independent current for the HOR. This specific and asymmetrical shape of the polarization curve manifests the involvement of a slow surface-chemical reaction. The exchange current density of the HOR/HER equilibrium on the PEDOT–PEG films, obtained from the intercept of the extrapolated evolutions of HER and HOR currents from the Tafel regions, has a value of 1 × 10−5 A cm−2. Surprisingly, this high value locates the rate of HER on PEDOT–PEG between the group of coinage metals (e.g. Ni, Co, and Fe) and Au (Table 1). On top of the comparable catalytic performance, PEDOT–PEG does not suffer from chemical corrosion or passivating oxide layers in acidic media. In fact, the stability and performance of PEDOT are better in acidic media. The quantification of HER/HOR electrocatalysis on a bare GCE yields exchange current density values of 1.4 × 10−6 A cm−2 (0.5 M H2SO4) and 8 × 10−7 A cm−2 (pH = 3.6) emphasizing an electrocatalytic increase of the HER process rate on PEDOT–PEG films (Fig. S5†). We believe that there are three specific features explaining this remarkable high rate of HER with PEDOT–PEG: the first is an efficient catalytic effect; the second is the presence of an intrinsic molecular porosity due to the important role of van der Waals bonds in this molecular solid; the third is the absence of corrosion in an acidic environment for this polymer electrode. The exchange current density shows no pH dependence, which means that the rate-determining step (RDS) is not limited by the proton concentration. The high current densities obtained for the PEDOT–PEG-modified GCE at negative potentials are typically characterized by mass-transport limited reactions, as indicated by the presence of clear current plateaus. The onset potential of the HER, estimated from the linear plot, is ca. −0.37 V (Fig. S6†), which is more negative than the reported values for high performance HER catalysts.39 However, one should note that high performance HER catalysts are metallic and the PEDOT–PEG film is a pure organic material.

The mechanisms of the heterogeneous HER (Scheme S1†) commence from the reduction of a proton, followed by the adsorption of the resulting hydrogen atom on the catalyst surface (the so-called Volmer step (V)). Being decisive, the second step yields a hydrogen molecule either by a non-electrochemical recombination of adsorbed hydrogen atoms (the so-called Tafel step (T)) or by a subsequent electrochemical reduction of a proton (the so-called Heyrovsky step (H)). The Tafel slope for the HER shows a pH-independent value of 40 mV per decade, indicating that the H-process is the RDS for the HER, by the VH mechanism.40 Note that the Tafel slope of 40 mV per decade is also reported for electrodes based on platinum in 0.5 M H2SO4.41–44 For a detailed investigation of the reaction mechanisms of the HER, catalyzed by PEDOT–PEG films, we explored the energetics of both pathways with the help of theoretical modeling. First, we performed quantum chemical calculations based on DFT using a minimalistic model based on single monomer approximation that provides us with free energies for the species in the gas phase and free electrons at infinity. Next, we introduced thermodynamic corrections to solvate the species and to put exchanged electrons at a chosen redox potential, namely at 0 V (vs. RHE) in order to obtain free energy diagrams (Fig. 4 and ESI Note 2†). As a check of the precision of our procedure, we obtained overall ΔG = 0.18 eV, while at this potential the HER should be in thermodynamic equilibrium, ΔG = 0 eV. The first step is common for both VH and VT mechanisms, then they bifurcate. The highest energy point of the VT mechanism is the transition state at 4.90 eV corresponding to the potential-independent chemical recombination (T) step. The VH mechanism passes via an H step with a potential-dependent barrier. To estimate its barrier, we consider two limiting cases: the transition state having the same charge (i) as the reactants (TS+), with an energy of 2.35 eV and (ii) as the products (TS0), with the energy as low as 0.04 eV. Both limiting cases of TS location are considered for non-adiabatic, instantaneous, “outer-sphere” ET, while the adiabatic ET locates the TS energetics in between these two limits. The upper point of the H step (2.35 eV) is undoubtedly lower than the highest point of the T step (4.90 eV), which confirms the preference for the VH pathway of the HER in PEDOT films.
 Fig. 4  Free energy diagrams for the HER on PEDOT–PEG: the Volmer–Tafel mechanism (red) and the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (green). 
The HER production efficiency was evaluated by operando mass spectrometry (Fig. 5A). The application of a negative potential pulse to the PEDOT–PEG electrode generates a synchronized pulse of hydrogen concentration in the gas outlet from the sealed electrolysis cell (Fig. 5B). The linear correlation between the produced hydrogen partial pressure and the applied current density (Fig. 5C) suggests a direct conversion of electrical charge into electrosynthesized hydrogen. The coulombic efficiency of the electrosynthesis is determined by the ratio between the amount of hydrogen detected, by mass spectrometry, and the amount of hydrogen expected from the consumed electric charge according to Faraday's law. A coulombic efficiency of 40% is found here, which is comparable to that of other reported electrocatalysts (Table 2), being mostly metallic catalysts since the use of organic homogeneous HER catalysts13 is hampered by immobilization problems. The incomplete electrical-to-chemical energy conversion might be a consequence of hydrogen loss due to leakage or back-oxidation on the unseparated counter electrode (platinum mesh, Fig. 5A) and the presence of the counteracting dedoping process of the organic semiconductor. The use of an insulator support17,18 and the absence of any iron residue-contamination, which was ensured by acid-washing and confirmed by XPS (Fig. S1†), motivate us to assign the recorded production of H2 solely to the conducting organic material.

Finally, we evaluated this conducting polymer as a cathode catalyst in a working PEMWE device (Fig. 6 and S8†). The steady-state polarization curve of the PEMWE, with the PEDOT-based cathode operating at 80 °C, showed a current density of 0.5 A cm−2 at an applied voltage of 1.95 V. This is comparable with the characteristics of inorganic platinum group metal-free (PGM-free) cathode catalysts (Table 3).45–51 Comparing the results in the presence of PEDOT–PEG on the cathode versus the background measurement on the PEDOT-free PEMWE (i.e. bare porous titanium) led to a clear enhancement of HER activity. As mentioned above, a Tafel slope of 40 mV per decade for the HER, obtained in the three-electrode system setup, was reached. The same Tafel slopes, recorded from the PEDOT–PEG in the PEMWE setup, are observed only at polarizations up to 1.8 V, which illustrates that the RDS is maintained only for small current densities. During the first runs of the PEDOT–PEG-based devices, the increase of current with applied voltage slows down at around 2.0 V but accelerates again for higher voltages. A device operated continuously for 3 days showed a relatively lower current than the bare porous titanium substrate. Both these types of loss of activity reflect a decrease in catalytic activity, under stress, that can only be due to dedoping of the conducting polymer and underscore the importance of its oxidation state for the electrocatalytic processes. Note that the integration of PEDOT–PEG into the gas diffusion cathode was not optimized with respect to the triple phase boundary, taking the relative densities into account, contact resistance and device operation, suggesting the possibility for considerable improvement of performance.

Conclusions
To conclude, for the first time, the semiconductor behavior of PEDOT, while composited with PEG, leads to a true all-organic polymer electrocatalyst system for the HER with efficient electrical-to-chemical energy conversion and good stability (neither oxide film formation nor chemical corrosion) in acidic media. We believe that this might be extrapolated to other non-metallic organic electrocatalysts and that a molecular design of the catalytic activity can be further explored. The consistency between results obtained from electrochemical, computational and physical methods encourages us to quantify the classical model reaction for the HER (Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism) on the organic catalyst, from mechanistic aspects to the operation of a first electrolyzer using an organic electrode for H2 production.
With the cost of catalysts being the key limitation of the establishment of a large-scale hydrogen economy, an organic catalyst represents an attractive candidate, in part owing to a low-temperature synthesis protocol including earth-abundant elements and easy processing and manufacturing. Moreover, printing technologies can be used to pattern coatings of those electrocatalytic polymers on a large area at low cost and high manufacturing rates. This is a breakthrough for the H2-technology production and opens a way for large-area organic electrolyzers for the mass production of H2, targeting energy storage and conversion by fuel cells for cities.
Experimental section
Reagents
All inorganic salts, hydrochloric acid, ethanol, isopropanol, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG–PPG–PEG, 5800 g mol−1) and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) were purchased from Sigma (Sweden) and used as received. Iron(III) OTf (90%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Iridium(II) oxide (IrO2) and platinum nanoparticles supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (Pt/C) were purchased from Fuel Cell Store Inc. Experiments were carried out with deionized water.
Procedures
The PEDOT–PEG film was prepared by vapor phase polymerization (VPP).52 The oxidant solution containing 3 wt% Fe(OTf)3 and 20 wt% triblock copolymer PEG–PPG–PEG was spin coated on a clean glass substrate (Thermo Scientific) at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Thereafter, the substrate was heated up to 70 °C on a hot plate for 30 s to evaporate the solvent. Afterwards, the substrate was placed in a vacuum chamber (JP Selecta, 70 mbar) containing EDOT at 30 °C for a desired polymerization time (e.g. 1 h). Then, the substrate was placed again on a hot plate at 70 °C for 2 min to complete the polymerization. Finally, the sample was sequentially washed with ethanol, 20 v% HCl (in order to remove the iron residues), and deionized water and dried in air.
Methods
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode setup in a sealed cell with a BioLogic SP200 potentiostat with a platinum mesh (25 × 35 mm) and a Ag/AgCl electrode in 3.0 M NaCl as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The absence of platinum counter electrode dissolution53 was confirmed by electrochemical measurements with a large glassy carbon counter electrode (Fig. S9†). In situ resistometry was performed using a customized gold interdigitated microband electrode (Micrux Technologies) with an Autolab type III bi-potentiostat (Metrohm-Autolab) with a platinum mesh (25 × 35 mm) and a Ag/AgCl electrode in 3.0 M NaCl as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The measurement in the aprotic electrolyte using 0.1 M tetraethylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TEAP, 99%, Sigma Aldrich) in anhydrous acetonitrile (CAN, Sigma Aldrich) was performed under inert gas conditions in a glovebox. A Pt quasi-reference electrode was employed, which was calibrated by the ferrocene peak (Fig. S10†). Four-point probe conductivity measurement was carried out using a sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) as reported before.26 Steady-state polarization measurements were performed on a GCE rotating disk electrode (5 mm diameter, Pine Research Instrumentation Inc.). Prior to use, the GCE was successively polished with 1.0 and 0.05 μm Al2O3 powders and sonicated in Milli-Q water. Prior to all electrochemical measurements, the cell with electrolyte was thoroughly purged with nitrogen for 20 min. Operando mass spectrometry studies were conducted in a sealed electrochemical cell (Fig. 5A) using a constant nitrogen flow (30 mL min−1) with a hydrogen-calibrated HPR 20 Hiden mass spectrometer (Hiden Analytical) in combination with an Autolab type III potentiostat (Metrohm-Autolab).
The PEMWE was assembled with PEDOT–PEG as a cathode catalyst. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was performed on a Nafion® 117 polymer electrolyte membrane (DuPont) and porous titanium disks (30% porosity, 900 μm thickness) as gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs)54 coated with catalytic layers. IrO255 and Pt/C56,57 were used as the anode and reference cathode catalysts, respectively. The catalyst and 5 wt% Nafion® solution (DuPont) were homogenized in isopropanol using an ultrasonic bath with a working frequency of 22–25 kHz. The resulting catalyst ink was air sprayed onto the GDE surface with 2 mg cm−2 loading. PEDOT–PEG was loaded on GDEs by VPP as described previously. The polymer electrolyte membrane was sandwiched between catalyst coated GDEs to form the MEA, which was evaluated in a PEM water electrolyzer consisting of two thermostatic half-cells with a working surface area of 7 cm2.58 All water electrolysis measurements were performed at a temperature of 80 °C.
The film thickness and morphology were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco-Dimension 3100). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an XPS spectrometer (Scienta ESCA 200).

 	Fig. 1  (A) Chemical formula of PEDOT, OTf and the copolymer PEG–PPG–PEG abbreviated “PEG” in this article. (B) AFM micrograph of PEDOT–PEG film (phase and topography image). (C) Photograph of electrosynthesized hydrogen bubbles on PEDOT–PEG.	 

 	Fig. 2  Decoupling of interior and heterogeneous electron transfer on the semiconducting catalyst. Resistometry was performed on PEDOT–PEG-modified electrodes in nitrogen-saturated neutral (1.0 M KCl), acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and aprotic (0.1 M TEAP in ACN) electrolytes (A). The resistance is normalized to 1 at a potential of +1.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry was performed in 1.0 M KCl (B) and 0.5 M H2SO4 (C) electrolytes (scan rate 5 mV s−1). The bright blue dashed line in (B) represents the cyclic voltammogram on the bare glass substrate.	 

 	Fig. 3  pH effect on the HER. (A) Cyclic voltammograms obtained for PEDOT–PEG electrodes in nitrogen-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with different pH values adjusted with NaOH; scan rate 5 mV s−1; (B) pH dependences of the apparent HER onset potential for PEDOT–PEG and platinum. (C) IR-compensated steady-state polarization curves obtained on the PEDOT–PEG-modified GCE (rotating disk electrode, 900 rpm) in electrolytes (0.5 M H2SO4) of different pH values adjusted with NaOH (pH 0.4, 1.1, 2.1, and 3.6 as red, green, blue and magenta symbols, respectively; oxidation and reduction currents as open and filled symbols, respectively).
