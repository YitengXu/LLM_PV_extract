    , Accepted 5th March 2019First published on 6th March 2019AbstractThe electronic properties of the interface between Au and organometallic triiodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) were investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films were prepared on Au surfaces by spin casting with various concentrations to control the film thickness. Their morphology was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films exhibited a maximum valence band edge of 5.91 eV. The energy levels shifted downward by 0.26 eV with a perovskite coverage of 116.3 nm, indicating that band bending occurs at the interface. The observed energy level shift indicates an interface dipole at the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx junction. These findings contribute to the understanding of how perovskite materials function in electronic devices and aid in the design of new perovskite materials.
1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskites have attracted great attention as candidates for next generation solar cells as their power conversion efficiencies (PCE) have exceeded 21%.1–5 These materials offer advantages such as solution processability, low-cost, high carrier mobilities (∼8 cm2 V−1 s−1), long carrier lifetimes and abundance in nature.6–10 These desirable features have spurred an intense, world-wide research effort which has shed light on the principals of operation, structure–function relationships and effective synthetic approaches to achieve high performance solar cells and semiconducting devices. The publication of many informative and insightful studies have contributed to the rapid development of this field. For example the development of “two-step” film deposition processing,11 planar heterojunctions,12 solvent engineering13 and interfacial organic layers14 have contributed to the rapid success of perovskite solar cells. Although most high-efficiency perovskite solar cells have employed n-type TiO2 substrates in an n-i-p architecture, inverted devices using substrates with a p-type organic layer and p-i-n architecture have become the focus of recent studies.15 It is expected that efficiencies as high as those achieved using n-i-p structures can be achieved in inverted architectures if the band structure of inverted devices can be fully understood and optimized.
Although the PCEs of perovskite solar cells have rapidly increased to impressive values, large variations in efficiency are observed in perovskite devices even if great care is taken to prepare them systematically. This effect occurs within single studies16,17 and is more pronounced between different laboratories. This poor reproducibility is a major issue in the development of perovskite solar cells and may be due, in part, to a lack of knowledge of energy level alignment or electronic structures at different interfaces in devices. Energy level alignment between semiconducting layers is dramatically affected by small perturbations such as adsorbed vapours, trace impurities or exposure to UV light, for example.
Perovskite structures have the general formula AMX3, where A is a cation such as Cs, methylammonium or formamidinium; M is a divalent metal cation (usually Pb(II)) and X is I, Cl, Br or various combinations of halogen elements. Despite the simple formula, it has been highlighted recently that the properties of materials used in electronic devices may differ from materials prepared under carefully controlled conditions used for structural characterization.7 Surface-sensitive and element-specific spectroscopies such as ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies may provide valuable insight into the origin of these differences and spurious PCE variations. Previous UPS and XPS studies have provided insight regarding the electronic structure of perovskites and perovskite–substrate interfaces.18–23 For example, Liu et al. investigated the energy band structure of perovskite films deposited on PEDOT:PSS, and the change in energy levels with increasing Au thickness.20 D. Mariotti et al. studied the surface chemistry of perovskite films spray-coated on Au surface atop TiO2 substrates using film thicknesses in the range of 670 to 5000 nm by this method.24 The film thicknesses in this study were greater than film thicknesses typically used in solar cell devices and the study did not investigate band bending near the Au junction. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have yet investigated how the band structure of the perovskite phase changes with distance away from the perovskite/metal interface. Also, available XPS data often exhibit unexplained features, such as multiple carbon species,25 regardless of preparation methods. These fundamental electronic studies are critical to the maturation and future development of perovskite semiconductors.
In this work, we report a detailed investigation of the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx junction by characterizing changes in band structure at incrementally increasing distances from the interface, accomplished via UPS and XPS spectroscopy. This study is the first of its kind to provide a quantitative picture of band-bending in the perovskite phase as a function of distance from the junction.
2. Experimental section
For UPS and XPS experiments, all samples were fabricated on Si substrates with a thin native oxide. (NAMKANG HI-TECH CO., LTD) Substrates were sonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 10 minutes, respectively. Au films of 50 nm thickness were deposited on pre-cleaned Si substrates by thermal evaporation. Perovskite films were prepared by dissolving PbCl2 and CH3NH3I (2:3) in dimethylformamide (DMF). These solutions with various concentrations (including 3.2, 6.3, 12.5, 25, and 50 wt%) were then spin-cast at 2000 rpm for 40 s atop Au films. The perovskite films were then annealed at 90 °C for 120 minutes under an N2 atmosphere. To minimize possible influence by exposure to air, the films were then transferred from the vacuum-sealed package to the analysis chamber. Subsequently, all samples were kept inside a high-vacuum chamber for 2 hours to remove solvent. Film thickness was determined by a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and XPS measurements (ESI†). Concentrations of 3.2, 6.3, 12.5, 25, and 50 wt% and yielded thicknesses of 3.9, 12.7, 33.4, 57, and 116.3 nm, respectively.
UPS and XPS were carried out with an ESCALAB 250-XI surface analysis system equipped with a He-discharge lamp providing He-I photons with an energy of 21.22 eV for UPS analysis; and a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray gun with photon energies of 1486.6 eV for XPS investigation. The base vacuum pressure of the analysis system was ≈10−7 Torr. The Fermi edge was calibrated using a clean Au film and all spectra presented were plotted with respect to the determined Fermi level. Binding energies (BEs) from UPS data were determined from the intercept of lines tangent to the inflection point of the Fermi edge or secondary edge and lines tangent to the baseline data. BEs for the thickest and thinnest samples are marked with grey lines. Work functions (WFs) were taken from the difference between the incident photon energy (21.22 eV) and the secondary edge (ESE) as follows: WF = 21.22 − ESE. Valence band energies were calculated from the position of the Fermi edge relative to Fermi edge of the Au reference.
All XPS measurements were calibrated with reference to the Au 4f7/2 core level (83.98 eV) of a freshly deposited Au film. The conduction band (CB) levels of the perovskite film were estimated using a band gap of 1.7 eV, which has been reported by inverse photoelectron spectroscopy.26 In order to confirm reproducibility of UPS and XPS spectra, measurements were repeated twice using two sets of samples. AFM images were obtained using a Veeco Multimode microscope in tapping mode.
3. Results and discussion
In Fig. 1, the change in Au 4f photoelectron signal intensity is plotted for films processed from different concentrations of the perovskite precursor solution. This data was used to calculate the perovskite film thickness as described in the ESI† and compared to data collected by AFM (Table S1, ESI†). Because perovskite films are fairly rough and may vary in thickness at different locations on the film, thickness data measured by AFM shows significant scatter compared to thickness measure by XPS. Whereas the thicknesses measured by XPS increased linearly with the increase in solution concentration (linear regression R2 = 0.996), the thickness measured by AFM showed significantly more scatter (R2 = 0.833) however, generally followed the data measured by XPS. For this reason, thicknesses calculated from XPS data were used throughout the study.

The evolution of UPS spectra upon increasing the thickness of perovskite films on Au substrates is presented in Fig. 2. For visual clarity, all spectra were normalized to the same height. Fig. 2(a) presents UPS data of the cut-off region (secondary edge) with the BE from the Fermi energy (EF) of the system. The energy of the secondary edge (ESE) was determined from the intersection of the x-axis and the line tangent to the inflection point of the onset. The vacuum level (Evac) was obtained from the difference between the photon energy (21.22 eV) and the cut-off energy. The ESEs shifted toward higher BEs for the first two samples (3.9 and 12.7 nm) relative to Au. As the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer became thicker (33.4 nm), the ESEs shifted toward lower BEs. The final ESE is assigned to the 116.3 nm CH3NH3PbI3−xClx spectrum. The CH3NH3PbI3−xClxEvac (ESE = 16.68 eV) is shifted by 0.09 eV toward lower BE compared to the Au surface (ESE = 16.59 eV). Fig. 2(b) also shows the evolution of the VB onsets for CH3NH3PbI3. The VB of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film was shifted by 1.04 eV relative to Au for a 3.9 nm perovskite film deposited on Au. As the perovskite film thickness increased, a 0.26 eV downward shift of energy levels was observed as the perovskite film thickness progressively increased to 116.3 nm. Fig. 2 shows the C 1s, N 1s and Pb 4f emission lines of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layers as a function of film thickness, as obtained by XPS. The core levels of C 1s, N 1s and Pb 4f shifted simultaneously by 0.2 ± 0.1 eV toward higher BE. In Fig. 3(a), the main feature at 284.7 eV indicates organic sp3 carbon bonding modes, while a shoulder at 286.4 eV is attributed to the C–N bond. There is no difference in chemical bonding of N 1s features for different concentrations of perovskite (Fig. 3(b)). Fig. 3(c) shows core level peaks for the Pb 4f7/2 level (138.4 eV) and Pb 4f5/2 level (143.3 eV). The total shift of Pb 4f is measured to be ∼0.2 eV before it reaches saturation. The spin–orbit split between the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 levels is in all cases 4.85 eV, which is consistent with the literature.26 Thus, an energy level shift of 0.2 eV is observed between 3.9 nm CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and 116.3 nm CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. There is also a smaller second peak doublet shifted ∼1.7 eV toward lower BE compared to the main line, and the smaller structures at 136.8 eV and 141.7 eV can be attributed to metallic lead. These peaks occur in all samples regardless of film thickness. A similar trend for the metallic component has been observed in CH3NH3PbI2Cl films.27 This shows that Pb may be partially reduced to the metallic state upon deposition on Au. In addition, all perovskite films contain the element Cl, as evidenced by the Cl 2p XPS spectra (shown in Fig. S1, ESI†).

Fig. 4 shows surface topographic images (5 μm × 5 μm) of 3.9, 12.7, 33.4, 57.0, 116.3 nm thick perovskite films. Higher magnification images (2 μm × 2 μm) (Fig. S2, ESI†) and phase images (Fig. S3, ESI†) are included in the ESI† for comparison. The 3.9, 12.7, and 33.4 nm perovskite layers are compact with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of less than 10 nm. In contrast, the 57.0 and 116.3 nm thick perovskite layers were rougher, with RMS roughnesses of 20.2 and 41.2 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(d) and (e). The average grain size of perovskite films with different thickness was calculated from AFM images (Fig. S4, ESI†) using data analysis software, as described in the ESI† and observed to increase (from 124.9 to 147.6 to 153.2 to 168.9 to 214.3 nm) as the perovskite layer became thicker (for 3.9, 12.7, 33.4, 57.0, 116.3 nm film thickness, respectively).

In Fig. 5(a), we present direct evidence of the relative shifts of the core levels at the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx interface as a function of perovskite coverage. Peak shifts are calculated relative to the first (thinnest) sample. The core levels of C 1s, N 1s and Pb 4f shift almost the same as the Evac, indicating no significant surface chemical modification during this process. The WF and ionization potential of the sample surface values versus thickness are shown in Fig. 5(b)). From the change in the C 1s, N 1s and Pb 4f peaks, and the slight shift of ESE, we see that the electronic structure at the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx interface exhibits band bending. The WF change is closely connected to band bending at the interface, and the variation of WF coincides with the C 1s, Pb 4f and N 1s peak variation.

From these measurements, a complete understanding of the energy level alignment at the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx interface can be put together, as shown in Fig. 6. Interfacial energy levels were quantified using the experimentally determined WF of Au. The observed WF of thermally deposited Au surfaces was consistent with previous reports (4.4–4.8 eV), somewhat lower than reference values reported for polycrystalline and atomically clean Au surfaces, which fall in the range of 5.1–5.2 eV.28,29 At the perovskite side, a 0.26 eV downward band bending (Vbb) effect is observed (over a distance of 116.3 nm, both from the perovskite XPS and UPS spectra. Due to the lower position of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx's CB compared to the EF of Au, electron transfer from perovskite to Au is energetically favorable, however, the band bending effect creates small (0.26 eV) potential energy barrier for electron diffusion towards the Au interface. The Vbb additionally facilitates hole collection at the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx interface. The Vbb on its own may not adequately prevent electrons in the CB of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx from tunnelling through the small barrier to reach the Au electrode. At the interface, Evac, CB and VB of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx were 4.47, 0.66 eV above, and 1.04 eV below the EF, respectively. On the side of Au, the WF was 4.61 eV according to the UPS data in Fig. 2, which indicates that there is an interfacial dipole of 0.14 eV at the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx interface, which can be ascribed to the difference of WFs between Au and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the energetics at the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx interface have been comprehensively studied using XPS and UPS measurements. Our results indicate a lack of chemical stability of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx which is manifested as interfacial reactions leading to the appearance of metallic lead when it is deposited onto Au. XPS measurements reveal a consistent core level shift in perovskite related elemental peaks. UPS further confirms this shift, which appears in VB and WF measurements as well. Band bending occurs at the interface and over a distance of 116 nm into the perovskite phase, simultaneously creating a 0.26 eV potential energy well for hole accumulation at the interface and a barrier for electron diffusion towards Au. This band bending reduces the injection barrier for holes and is a critical attribute making this junction suitable as a hole collector. These studies confirm and explain the utility of the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx interface as hole collector in perovskite-based solar cells, however, suggest that additional interfacial layers may be necessary to completely inhibit electron back-diffusion and prevent interfacial reactions with Au. This investigation provides important insights and understanding of perovskite semiconducting devices which use Au electrodes.
