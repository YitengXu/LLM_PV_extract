    , Accepted 26th August 2022First published on 30th August 2022AbstractMathematical models for porous electrode impedance have been widely used in energy conversion and storage. They are also utilized for obtaining the physicochemical dynamics, resulting in theoretical understanding and prediction in practical energy devices. The existing mathematical models are limited in their explanations. This limitation can be attributed to the separate consideration of simple (planar electrodes) and complex (porous electrodes) systems and the complexity of parameter distribution with non-uniform processes. Here, to address these limitations, we propose a mathematical model based on a staircase structure that calculates the individual interfacial impedance at each step in the depth direction, which helps not only in describing complex and straightforward systems but also in uniform and non-uniform processes in the form of a simple, seamless general equation. Our study includes mathematical derivations, interpretations of porous electrode impedance, and validation of the experimental data.
1 Introduction
Significant research has been conducted globally to develop various energy conversion and storage devices for achieving carbon neutrality.1,2 Electrochemical energy storage reactions involve either charge transfer or electric double-layer formation at the interface between an electronically conducting electrode and an ion-conducting electrolyte. These interfaces of various energy conversion and storage devices are generally formed inside a porous structure consisting of active material or catalyst, conductive carbon, and binder with a distribution in the depth direction, as shown in Fig. 1. The electrochemical process kinetics in porous electrodes require quantitative analysis as they are directly related to the device's energy, power, and efficiency, and are evaluated as resistive and capacitive components using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The main impedance components of electrochemical process include: (i) electronic resistance (Re), electrolyte bulk resistance (Rsol), and ionic resistance inside the porous electrode (Rion) due to mixed electronic and ionic conduction; (ii) electric double-layer capacitance at the electrode/electrolyte interface (Cdl); (iii) charge-transfer resistance at the interface (Rct); and (iv) diffusion by mass transfer for charge compensation.
 Fig. 1  Relevance of various energy conversion and storage devices and mathematical network models with staircase structure. 
The Randles model considers the electrochemical process macroscopically as a planar electrode interface and consists of a simple parallel equivalent circuit of Rct and Cdl together with diffusion.3 In positioning complex systems with respect to the Randles model, the transmission line model employs a ladder-type equivalent circuits for the detailed analysis of porous electrode impedance as a cylindrical pore4,5 and is widely used in energy conversion and storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries,6–9 lithium metal batteries,10 capacitors,11,12 fuel cells,3,13 solar cells,14–16 H2O electrolysis17,18 and CO2 reduction.19–21
Mathematical analysis for electrode impedance of such energy storage conversion/storage devices has two perspectives: (i) an ideal/non-ideal model perspective for equations related to electrode structure and (ii) a uniform/non-uniform process perspective for input parameters related to the interface reaction per impedance unit. In the transmission line model, it is valid for ideal models with infinite impedance unit with respect to depth or for uniform processes that use a single value for the impedance unit, but is invalid for non-ideal models with finite layers or mixed models of impedance unit with respect to depth, or for non-uniform processes that use different multiple values for the impedance unit, due to the use of hyperbolic functions.4,5,11,22,23 Further, this model has primarily ignored Re at the porous electrode due to the mathematical model's complexity.22,24 Therefore, there is little discussion on non-uniform process involving Re in the transmission line model.
Here, we present a mathematical model to explain any impedance. In this approach (Fig. 1), the impedance unit along the depth direction is designed as a network model for equivalent circuit that resembles ‘a staircase structure’ and assembled like a block. In this study, we explain the mathematical equation for the staircase model and compare it with the computational results. Finally, we discuss the computation of non-uniform parameters using the features of the staircase model and validate the results using experimental results.
2 Computational methods
2.1 Staircase model
For equivalent circuit design calculations using impedance units (ZA and ZB), the total impedance component (Z) is treated as a simple sum (Z = ZA + ZB) for series connection and as the inverse sum (1/Z = 1/ZA + 1/ZB) for parallel connection. And two main impedance units at the electrode/electrolyte interface (Zint) are prepared: a non-Faradic process (Zint,n-f) and a Faradic process (Zint,f). The Zint,n-f involves only electric double layer formation without charge transfer, as shown in Fig. 2(b), and can be described using the electric double-layer capacitance (Cdl) as follows: Zint,n-f = (jωCdl)−1(1)where j is an imaginary number and ω (= 2πf, f is the frequency (Hz)) is the angular velocity. In contrast, the Zint,f is equivalent to electric double layer formation and charge-transfer reaction and consists of a parallel circuit of a charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and Cdl, as shown in Fig. 2(c), which can be expressed according to the basic design of the equivalent circuit described earlier as follows: (2)Detailed derivation of impedance components with respect to resistance and capacitance is shown in ESI.†

As an initial step without pores in staircase model (SCM), the equivalent circuit (ZSCM0) for a series of electrochemical processes involving impedance unit of the electrode/electrolyte interface (Zint0) is shown in Fig. 2(d). The equivalent circuit considers the ionic resistance in the electrolyte (Rion0) and the electronic resistance inside the electrode (Re0) and is given below. ZSCM0 = Rion0 + Z0 = Rion0 + Zint0 + Re0(3)
Subsequently, the mathematical model involving the single staircase pore is given as ZSCM1 (Fig. 2(e)). In addition to the electrolyte bulk resistance (Rion1), the model contains a step for ionic resistance in the pore depth direction. The ZSCM0 in Fig. 2(e) is the same as that in Fig. 2(d). Therefore, the overall equivalent circuit ZSCM1 can be expressed using Rion1 and a parallel circuit of ZSCM0 in the prior step and Z1, as given below. (4)
For an n-step ion resistance in the depth direction of the pore, a staircase mathematical model is considered in addition to the electrolyte bulk resistance (Rion(n)), as shown in Fig. 2(f). As explained above, the proposed model is characterized by incorporating the equivalent circuit of the model of one prior step without modification. Thus, the overall equivalent circuit ZSCM(n) can be expressed as the following relational expression using the equivalent circuit of the prior step ZSCM(n−1). (5)
Therefore, each calculation can be accomplished by addition and multiplication without using hyperbolic functions with limited inputs and is treated using a recursive function, which utilizes the prior calculation itself again in the program calculation, that seamlessly enables various impedance representations of ideal/non-ideal model and uniform/non-uniform process. This means freedom of input values in the calculations, which is especially useful for the calculation of non-uniform resistive processes, discussed below. The details of the program with recursive functions shown as program details in the ESI.†
2.2 Transmission line model
In the transmission line model (TLM) as shown in Fig. 2(a), the impedance behaviors for non-Faradaic (ZTLM,n-f) and Faradaic (ZTLM,f) processes are derived using the hyperbolic function assuming that current distribution exists in the pore depth direction.4–6 (6) (7)where r is the pore radius (cm), L is the unit pore length corresponding to the electrode thickness (cm), Cdl,A is the electric double-layer capacitance per unit surface area (F cm−2), Rion,L is the ionic resistance per unit pore length (Ω cm−1), and Rct,A is the charge-transfer resistance per surface area (Ω cm2). The Nyquist plots calculated using eqn (6) and (7) are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). When ω is converged to zero, the real part of the impedance for the non-Faradaic process (Zre,n-f) shows the following relationship using ionic resistance in pores (Rion = Rion,L·L, Ω).6,25 (8)When ω is converged to zero in the Faradaic process, the real part of the impedance for the Faradaic process (Zre,f) depends on the relative values of Rion and charge-transfer resistance (Rct = Rct,A/(2πrL), Ω). In relation to the mathematical treatment of the hyperbolic function, when Rct is sufficiently larger than Rion, Zre,f converging to zero shows the following relationship using Rion and Rct, which is kinetically limited.6,25 (9)In contrast, when Rion is sufficiently larger than Rct, Zre,f converging to zero shows the following relationship, which is ion transport limited.26,27 (10)

3.1 Materials
LiNiO2-Based lithium-ion battery positive electrodes were prepared by coating Al foil with a dispersion of LiNi0.75Co0.15Al0.05Mg0.05O2, carbon black (conducting agent), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, binder) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). LiNi0.75Co0.15Al0.05Mg0.05O2 was prepared via the co-precipitation method.28 Before the fabrication of the electrochemical cell, both electrodes were dried at 120 °C under vacuum for at least 10 h. The mass loading for the electrodes was 10.5 mg cm−2. The specifications of the electrodes used in this study are listed in Table 1. Here, 1.0 M solution of LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and ethyl methyl carbonate (30:40:30, v/v/v, respectively) was used as the electrolyte.

3.2 Impedance measurement using symmetric cells
Laminate-type pouch cells with identical LiNiO2-based electrodes were assembled using an electrolyte-filled separator for symmetric cell impedance measurements to investigate the impedance behavior of non-Faradaic process.6–9 AC impedance measurements (Solatron 1260/1286, England) for the symmetric cells were performed at the open-circuit potential. The frequency was varied from 100 kHz to 100 mHz with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV (peak-to-peak). The measurements were performed at 20 °C.
4 Results and discussion
4.1 Seamless variation of simple and complex Nyquist plots
The Nyquist plots for the non-Faradaic and Faradaic processes at each step (n) in the proposed staircase model were obtained using electronic resistance (Re,in), ionic resistance (Rion,in), charge-transfer resistance (Rct,in) and electric double-layer capacitance (Cdl,in) as input parameters (Fig. 3(a–i)). The Nyquist plots displayed by the real (Zre) and imaginary (Zim) parts of the impedance components for non-Faradaic and Faradaic processes assuming n is zero show a vertical line (Fig. 3(a)) and a semicircle (Fig. 3(e)), respectively. These results are consistent with the results reported for planar electrodes.25 With an increase in n, the Nyquist plots exhibit a slightly distorted behavior with a slope close to 90° in the high-frequency region near the origin for non-Faradaic process (Fig. 3(a–d)) and a semicircle decrease for Faradaic (Fig. 3(e–h)) process. When n was set to 50, the behaviors of non-Faradaic and Faradaic processes were overlapped in the high-frequency region, with the slopes approaching 45° (Fig. 3(i)). This 45° slope behavior in the high-frequency region has been confirmed in a variety of practical porous electrodes in non-aqueous,29 acid or alkaline aqueous electrolytes18,30 and solid electrolytes,19,31 and represents a typical ideal ionic resistance inside the porous electrode,6 and the increase in the 45° slope length corresponds to an increase in the electrode thickness direction.7 The profile in the low frequency range shows a vertical for non-Faradic process and a semicircle for Faradic process due to the charge transfer resistance. The Nyquist plot at 50 steps obtained using the staircase model shows good agreement with the results of the transmission line model calculated using eqn (6) and (7) (Fig. S1, ESI†). This means that the ideal Nyquist plot for the porous electrodes drawn by the transmission line model can also be described by the staircase model. Furthermore, in terms of capacitive response of real and imaginary components to frequency using complex capacitance theory,11,32 the staircase model calculations also indicated non-Faradaic (Fig. S2, ESI†) and Faradaic processes (Fig. S3, ESI†) at the porous electrodes. In the detailed change profile of Nyquist plots of non-Faradaic process up to 100 steps, with an increase in n, the plot extends into a straight line with a slope of 45° in the high-frequency region while maintaining its vertical nature in the low-frequency region (Fig. S4(a–h), ESI†). The slope and coefficient of determination of the linear approximation (R2) in the high-frequency region approach one at n above about 50 (Fig. S4(i), ESI†), which aligns well with the ideal profile for the Nyquist plots of porous electrodes, as shown in the transmission line model. Nyquist plots at n below about 50 suggest the intermediate non-ideal model related to the effect of porosity between planar and porous electrodes and is indicative of behavior in undeveloped porous electrodes that do not reach the ideal profile. Hence, as summarized in Fig. 3(j), the Nyquist plots obtained using the staircase model not only represent the behavior of the ideal planar or porous electrodes expressed using Randles or transmission line models, respectively, but also the behavior of non-ideal porous electrodes in between.

4.2 Relationship between input and output resistances
For the mathematical formulation of the resistive component in the staircase model, under condition of ideal behavior, the input parameters of n, Rion,in, and Rct,in were related to the ionic (Rion) and charge transfer (Rct) resistances for the porous electrodes based on eqn (8) and (9). The plots of Zre,n-f and Zre,f converging to zero calculated using the staircase model were compared in terms of systematically varying Rion,in and Rct,in at 50, 75, and 100 steps (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). In the non-Faradaic process, Zre,n-f converging to zero demonstrates a linear relationship through the origin with respect to Rion,in (Fig. 4(a)), and its slope (slopen-f) increases with an increase in n. The slopen-f plotted against n shows a linear relationship with a slope of 1/3 through the origin (Fig. 4(b)). Therefore, Zre,n-f converging to zero can be expressed using the following equation: (11)The following equation, derived from eqn (8) and (11), indicates a proportional relationship between Rion for the porous electrode and n. Rion = n·Rion,in(12)From eqn (12), we can observe that the Nyquist plot for the non-Faradaic process gets normalized when n is varied while keeping Rion,in as Rion/n with a fixed Rion (Fig. 4(c)). With an increase in n, the slope of Nyquist plot approaches 45° in the high-frequency region, while it becomes vertical in the low-frequency region. The same behavior is observed after 50 steps, which agrees well with the result shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).

(b) Relationship of the slope in (a) to n. (c) Variation in the calculated results of Nyquist plots for non-Faradaic process at each n when the input variables are normalized as Rion/n.

Input parameters: n = 50, 75, and 100; Re,in = 1 mΩ; Rion,in = 2 Ω; Rct,in = 9–90 kΩ; and Cdl,in = 1 mF. (e) Relationship between the slope in (d) and the inverse of the number of steps. (f) Change in the calculated results of Nyquist plots for Faradaic process at each n when the input variables are normalized as Rct,in · n. Input parameters: n = 1–100, Re,in = 1 mΩ, Rion,in = 300 Ω, Rct,in = 400 Ω, and Cdl,in = 1 mF. 
Contrastingly, in the Faradaic process when Rct is sufficiently larger than Rion (Rct ≫ Rion), Zre,f converging to zero shows a linear relationship with an intercept; unlike the non-Faradaic process (Fig. 4(d)), the slope (slopen-f) decreases as n increases, and the value of intercept corresponds to the calculations based on eqn (11) (inset in Fig. 4(d)). The slopen-f has a linear relationship with a slope of 1 through the origin with respect to the reciprocal n (Fig. 4(e)). Therefore, Zre,f converging to zero can be expressed using Rion,in and Rct,in. (13)
The following equation, derived from eqn (9) and (13), indicates an inverse proportionality between Rct for the porous electrode and n. (14)
The Nyquist plot for the Faradaic process is normalized when n is varied (eqn (14)) while keeping Rct,in as n·Rct with a fixed Rct (Fig. 4(f)). The Nyquist plot becomes a semicircle in the low-frequency region with an increase in n, while it demonstrates a slope of 45° in the high-frequency region. Therefore, the number of steps in the staircase model serves as a mesh for fine-grained representation of the ideal impedance profile for both non-Faradaic and Faradaic processes as n increases, while changing from the intermediate non-ideal to the ideal models as shown in Fig. 4(c and f).
4.3 Generalization of the boundary separating the resistance components
One of the advantages of impedance analysis for porous electrodes is the separation of resistive components using the relations in eqn (9) and (10), but the specific boundaries of these relations have not been clear.27 Assuming that eqn (12) and (14) obtained in the staircase model are valid in eqn (10) when Rion is sufficiently larger than Rct (Rct ≪ Rion), Zre,f converging to zero is derived as the following equation. (15)
Hence, we attempted to clarify the boundaries of eqn (13) and (15) for accurate resistive component separation using the proposed staircase model. First, Nyquist plots are obtained using the staircase model when Rct,in was varied under the constant Rion,in (Fig. 5(a)), and then the trend in the validity of the fitting accuracy for eqn (13) and (15) is examined from the change in Zre,f converging to zero (top of Fig. 5(b)). As a result, as shown in bottom top of Fig. 5(b), when Rct to Rion is less than 1/3 (Rct/Rion < 1/3), which is shown as the green line in Fig. 5(b), the change in Zre,f converging to zero shows a high fitting accuracy to eqn (15), while when Rct/Rion > 1/3, it shows a high fitting accuracy to eqn (13).
 Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist plots for change in input charge-transfer resistance (Rct,in) in Faradaic process obtained using the staircase model. Input parameters: n = 100, Re,in = 1 mΩ, Rion,in = 0.6 Ω, Rct,in = 100 Ω–10 kΩ, and Cdl,in = 10 μF. (b) The top panel shows plots of Zre,f converging to zero vs. Rct,in/n calculated in (a). The ideal variation with respect to Rct in eqn (13) and (15) are indicated by red and blue dashed lines, respectively. Rct is converted from Rct,in using eqn (14). The bottom panel shows absolute value of the ratio of Zre,f converging to zero to eqn (13) (red circles) and (15) (blue circles), defined as the fitting accuracy for Rct/Rion. Rion is converted form Rion,in using eqn (12). 
As shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b), the Nyquist plots for the former and latter regions display the dominance of the transport and kinetic limitations, respectively. Rct/Rion = 1/3 is present as a boundary for fitting accuracy in the two-dimensional regime of normalized Rion and Rct (Fig. 6(c) and (d)). The relational expression for the boundary can be transformed to Rct = Rion/3, where Rion/3 is the magnitude of the real component representing the 45° slope in non-Faradic process. Thus, the results suggest that Rct > Rion/3 is a kinetics-limited region while Rct < Rion/3 is an ion transport-limited region. In a previous study of the relationship between power performance and the ratio of internal resistance components when varying electrode thickness in lithium-ion batteries,7 porous electrodes exhibiting high power performance satisfied the condition Rct > Rion/3. Therefore, the calculation results and practical example indicate that Rct > Rion/3, which indicates at least the condition of unlimited ion transport, should be satisfied for a power capable electrode design in any energy conversion and storage devices involving charge-transfer reactions. This investigation using the staircase model is not only in good agreement with previous reports,27 but also provides a detailed boundary for the separation of resistive components that reflects the rate-limiting step changes in the electrochemical process at porous electrodes.

Input parameters: n = 100, Re,in = 1 mΩ, Rion,in = 0–1 Ω, Rct,in = 0 Ω–10 kΩ, and Cdl,in = 10 μF. Rion and Rct were normalized to 100 Ω as 1. 
4.4 Effect of non-uniform electronic resistance distribution
Reducing the ratio of conductive carbon while maintaining the required electronic resistance (Re) in porous electrodes is a key for designing electrodes for high-density energy storage devices. Although several reports have factored Re for analysing parameters in the transmission line model,22,23,33,34Re is typically considered negligible to avoid complexity in the transmission line model equations. Additionally, the transmission line model consisting of hyperbolic functions cannot mathematically accommodate variable input values for the respective depth direction.22,23 Contrastingly, in the proposed staircase model (Fig. 7(a)), the input Re at each step can be freely changed in the calculation process of equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 2(f), and thus the comparison of shape trends at frequency was performed as a preliminary step between the calculation and the actual behavior.

(b) Nyquist plots for symmetric cells using two LiNiO2-based electrodes with varying conductive carbon ratios in Li-based electrolyte. (c) Schematic image of the input value sequence for the calculation of the three types of Re,in distribution change from surface to depth for the calculation in the staircase model: (i) uniform change: the electronic resistance of all steps varies from 0.03 Ω to 30 Ω as a constant value, (ii) non-uniform change A: among the electronic resistance of all steps, the ratio of high electronic resistance (Re,high)/low electronic resistance (Re,low) varies from 5/95 to 95/5 as Re,high on the deep side and Re,low on the shallow side with respect to the electrode depth, and (iii) non-uniform change B: among the electronic resistance of all steps, the ratio of Re,low/Re,high varies from 95/5 to 5/95 as Re,low on the deep side and Re,high on the shallow side with respect to the electrode depth. (d–f) The calculated Nyquist plots using staircase model for the electronic resistance distributions at uniform change (d), non-uniform change A (e), and non-uniform change B (f). Input parameters: n = 100; Rion,in = 30 mΩ; Re,in = 0.03 Ω–30 Ω (d); Re,low = 0.03 Ω and Re,high = 90 Ω (e and f); and Cdl,in = 5 μF. Zre at the highest frequency in the calculation was normalized so that the condition for the smallest value of resistance in Re distribution approaches zero. 
As the actual impedance behavior, Fig. 7(b) shows the Nyquist plot for the non-Faradaic process at uncharged LiNiO2-based positive electrodes for lithium-ion batteries with the conductive carbon ratio reduced from 15% to 1% (see Fig. S7 for a detailed comparison, ESI†). The slope (45°) in the high-frequency region decreases with a reduction in carbon ratio from 15% to 3.5%, while a collapsed semicircle appears and increases with reducing the carbon ratio from 3.5% to 1% in the high-frequency region. The former trend has been reported as ideal and can be attributed to the improved ion transport in the porous electrode with reduced conductive carbon ratio,8,9 while the latter is considered non-ideal due to electronic resistance from detailed analysis (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). In addition, with respect to the appearance of semicircles at high frequencies, although the contact resistance with the current collector has been reported to create an ideal semicircle,35 which is also confirmed by the results for high carbon ratio from 15 to 3.5% in Fig. 7(b), the different shapes of such collapsed semicircles at low carbon ratio suggest the presence of different factors as well as contact resistance.
To investigate the effect of Re, as suggested by the experimental results, Nyquist plots for non-Faradaic processes were obtained for three different distribution conditions at the input electronic resistance (Re,in) using the staircase model (Fig. 7(c)); the input sequence of Re,in along the electrode depth direction (i) uniformly increases from the deepest to the shallowest (uniform change), (ii) non-uniformly increases the ratio of high electronic resistance from the deepest (non-uniform change A), and (iii) non-uniformly increases the ratio of high electronic resistance from the shallowest (non-uniform change B), which use two different Re values, Re,high and Re,low. The Nyquist plots for uniform change in Re,in indicate an increase in contact with the real part and a steeper slope in the high frequency with increasing Re,in (Fig. 7(d) and Fig. S10, ESI†). Our results obtained from the staircase model are in good agreement with the results of similar investigations when the electronic resistance was varied uniformly using the transmission line model.23
The Nyquist plots for non-uniform changes A (Fig. 7(e) and Fig. S11, ESI†) and B (Fig. 7(f) and Fig. S12, ESI†) are different from that of the uniform change. This result is attributed to the difference in the electron resistance distribution given in the calculation. Comparing the experimental and the calculated results of the staircase model, the non-uniform change A (Fig. 7(e)) is close to the non-ideal change of actual Nyquist plots at low conductive carbon ratios in terms of the shape of the Nyquist plot and the response frequency range (see Fig. S13 for a detailed comparison, ESI†), implying a distribution of low electronic resistance only near the electrode surface in the actual impedance behavior, as shown by the dotted square in (ii) in Fig. 7(c), which means a high concentration of conductive carbon on the surface. Considering the influence of process, this can be attributed to binder migration36–39 or nanoparticle diffusion effects40–43 during the particle coating process. Although such impedance behavior is still under discussion, the calculation of the non-uniformity of electronic resistance using the proposed model will contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon by adding it to the previous discussion on non-uniform processes.44–46
5. Conclusions
In this study, we proposed a staircase inspired mathematical model for porous electrode impedance. The proposed model was verified theoretically along with the experimental results. Compared to the conventional transmission line model, the proposed model allows a more straightforward calculation of the non-uniform resistance distribution. In addition to the ideal behavior, the proposed staircase model can handle the non-ideal model caused by porosity depending on the number of steps and non-uniform process of internal resistance depending on the modulation of input resistance parameters. The former non-ideal model will be effective for the change in morphology from planar to porous due to cycling when using metal electrodes, which are being actively investigated for next-generation rechargeable batteries, while the latter non-uniform process is effective for designing electrodes that reduce unnecessary elements in high-density batteries or high efficiency of energy conversion devices such as water electrolysis and CO2 reduction. We believe that this mathematical model will accelerate the understanding of various electrochemical processes occurring in porous electrodes for various energy conversion and storage devices. For this purpose, it will be necessary to construct a fitting technique using the staircase model as an equivalent circuit in the actual results.
