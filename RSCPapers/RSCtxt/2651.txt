    , Accepted 11th February 2014First published on 11th February 2014AbstractA fully integrated model of a photoelectrochemical cell for water electrolysis is applied to the case of light-absorbing particles embedded in a membrane separator. Composition of the product gases is shown to be one critical measure of device performance. Not only must the composition be kept outside the explosive window for mixtures of H2 and O2, but also product purity is a concern. For the absorber-in-membrane geometry and the model assumptions used here, results show purely water-saturated H2 on the cathode side and water-saturated O2 on the anode side. Since it is possible to design devices that violate these assumptions, it should not be assumed that a polymer separator or an absorber-in-membrane geometry will be effective in preventing explosive mixtures in all cases. Net H2 collected, iH2,net, is the second essential performance metric, and it is shown to differ significantly from the more commonly reported total H2 produced and operating current density. Schemes which co-evolve H2 and O2 violate the first metric and do not provide the second. A composite of triple-junction silicon absorbers in a Nafion membrane is shown to have an optimum thickness of 30 μm, dependent on the properties of the light absorber. Varying membrane properties reveals a tradeoff between conductivity, κm, and gas permeabilities, ψH2 and ψO2, that can potentially be exploited differently than in a fuel cell. Modulating the relative humidity (RH) is insufficient. The maximum iH2,net is calculated to be 6.97 mA cm−2 at RH = 30% relative to a value of 6.92 mA cm−2 at RH = 100%. The model identifies target material properties for new polymers. If ψ is dropped one order of magnitude below that of Nafion (ψ/ψNafion = 0.1), the optimum value for iH2,net increases by 63.5%. For ψ/ψNafion = 0.01, the optimum iH2,net increases by 73.5%, which compares favorably to the 74.5% improvement that would result if Nafion were made impermeable (ψ/ψNafion = 0). Meanwhile, κm can drop to a value of 1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 (two orders of magnitude below liquid-equilibrated Nafion) with less than a 5% decline in iH2,net.
Introduction
Direct conversion of sunlight, water, and carbon-containing sources into fuels is an appealing goal. The product is inherently useful in transportation applications, and storing energy in chemical bonds is superior to storing electrical energy in a battery on the basis of specific energy and cost.1 The first step would likely be to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC), a process that was first demonstrated in 1972 and has since been improved significantly.2,3 Still, significant challenges face the process, evidenced by the fact that experimentally realized solar-to-fuels (STF) efficiencies4–7 lag behind theoretical limits.8,9
One such challenge is the necessity of separating the product gases. Gas crossover can affect the composition of both head spaces, which dilutes the product stream and even has the potential to form explosive gas mixtures within the 4 to 94% v/v explosive limit for H2 in O2. Many recent integrated devices for solar hydrogen production have resulted in the co-evolution of H2 and O2.6,7,10,11 While these successes are significant steps forward, a mixed product stream is impractical at the production scales targeted for solar fuels due to the economic consequences of having to purify the product and the issue of safety.
In addition to altering the head space composition, the crossover of gases has two more negative consequences. Hydrogen can be re-oxidized back to protons if it reaches the anode, clearly leading to reduced product yield. Finally, oxygen can be reduced at the cathode, which hurts the device because the total current through the device is limited by the solar flux. If a significant portion of the total current is actually due to crossover, the device is not driving the reaction of choice, but rather an undesired side reaction. This is a familiar problem in the realm of corrosion engineering and must be taken into consideration. The relevant figures of merit for these two consequences are the faradaic efficiency, ηFar, and the collection efficiency, ηcoll, defined by (1) (2)Here, iabs is the current density in the light absorber and iH2,ca is the current density due to the hydrogen reaction at the cathode. ξca is the ratio of the cathode catalyst area to the cross-sectional area of the light absorber, and ϕabs is the ratio of light absorber area to total area (membrane + light absorber). ζout,ca is the volumetric flow rate of gas through the cathode outlet divided by the total area, and it can be thought of as the speed at which product gases move away from the device. pH2,ca is the partial pressure of H2 in the cathode head space. F is Faraday's constant, and sH2 and nH2 are the stoichiometric coefficient of H2 and the number of electrons transferred in the hydrogen oxidation reaction, respectively. The product of these two components is the current efficiency for electrolysis, ηI: ηI = ηFarηcoll(3)
Progress in PECs for solar fuels tends to be measured by the STF efficiency. However, the definition for STF efficiency has not been standardized. One proposed formula is equivalent to ηSTF = ηPVηCηV, where ηPV is the maximum power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic device.12ηC is a coupling efficiency that accounts for the fact that the device operates where the electrochemical load is matched by the power supplied by the light absorber, not at the maximum power point of the photovoltaic. ηV is the voltage efficiency, which is the ratio of the equilibrium cell potential for the desired reaction to the operating cell potential.
While such a formula captures most details, the key omission is the current efficiency: ηSTF = ηPVηCηVηI(4)
Allowing a non-unity ηI allows evaluation of the negative impacts of gas crossover. For instance, Haussener et al. allow a non-unity ηcoll in studying temperature and seasonal variations.13
Additionally, reporting a STF efficiency for a product stream that has not been separated is misleading. Additional energy losses will be necessary to separate the H2 and O2. Furthermore, adding barriers to keep the gases separate will reduce STF efficiency. This is because ηI will certainly drop, and ηV is likely to fall as well due to an increased ohmic drop. The composition of the product stream and the current efficiency are vital pieces of information when evaluating a proposed solar-fuels device.14
Designing a device that separates the products would be an important step toward the realization of a practical solar-fuel generator. The real difficulty is rooted in the need to restrict the transport of gases while allowing the transport of ions. In other words, crossover must be blocked without requiring an excessive ohmic loss. This restricts the allowable porosity of a porous separator for these types of applications.14 In designs that recirculate electrolyte to avoid excessive ohmic and pH-dependent losses, the same delicate balance between transporting enough ions without transporting too many gas molecules exists.15 It has also been proposed to use a polymer membrane to separate the anodes and cathodes of light absorbers for use in this class of PECs, with the polymer serving as the sole electrolyte in some cases.16–18 This paper endeavors to establish requirements for the material properties of membranes for solar-fuels applications.
System description
In order to analyze the system, a geometry must be adopted. For the purposes of this model, we assume a one dimensional system in which the light-absorbing components are embedded in a membrane with the possible use of catalysts to increase rates of reaction, as shown in Fig. 1. The light absorbers generate the potential required to drive water electrolysis, and they are arranged within the membrane such that there is a defined anode and cathode where the following reactions take place:
 Fig. 1  Absorber-in-membrane geometry. (a) A schematic of the key components in the model: light absorber, membrane, and catalysts at the anode and cathode. (b) A simplified view of the 1-D model. The current–voltage relationship between nodes A and B is determined by solar-cell device physics. The segments BC and DA are determined by Butler–Volmer kinetics, and the segment CD is determined by solving dilute-solution transport equations for regions of membrane and/or electrolyte. If a uniformly-hydrated membrane is the only electrolyte, ionic concentration gradients can be neglected, and segment CD can be approximated by Ohm's law through a resistive medium. 
Acidic: 2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−(5a) 2H+ + 2e− → H2(5b)
Basic: 4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e−(6a) 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−(6b)
The protons or hydroxide ions must travel from the electrode where they are produced to the electrode where they are consumed, or else the concentration gradient that forms will hinder further reaction.19 However, gaseous products must be prevented from traveling to the opposite electrode. Therefore, a membrane with high ionic conductivity and low gas permeability is an attractive candidate for the electrolyte.16 Although use of a number of fuel cell membranes is possible, block copolymers are particularly attractive for obtaining the desired transport properties.20,21
Model description
The full details of the model, including all the governing differential equations and boundary conditions, can be found elsewhere.22 To summarize the important aspects, material balances and Nernst–Planck flux equations for each species (electrons and holes in the semiconductor, ions and neutral species in solution) were solved simultaneously with an equation for the electrostatic potential. The potential was determined using Poisson's equation in the semiconductor and electroneutrality in the solution and/or membrane.
In this study, the properties of the light absorber were chosen to match a crystalline silicon microwire cell. In order to generate the potential necessary to split water, one or more junctions between dissimilar materials must be made. This causes a double layer at the interface, and the diffuse part of the double layer contains an electric field that bends the energy bands in the material.23 This band bending helps separate photogenerated charges, producing a potential difference that drives current through an external circuit.24
In order to generate enough potential to split water, the work here uses an example case of three p–n junctions contained within the light absorber, sometimes called buried junctions. Such a device has not yet been shown experimentally, but multijunction microwire and nanowire light absorbers are a promising avenue of research.10,25–27 The framework also supports replacing one or two of these buried junctions with a junction between the light absorber and the electrolyte, commonly called a liquid junction.28 The junctions are in tandem, which indicates that they are in series both optically and electronically. An alternative would be to wire the junctions in series electronically but have them optically in parallel, much like the panels on a solar-powered calculator. Multi-junction cells are typically favored because in order to obtain enough potential to split water with a single junction, a wide band gap must be used, leading to significant sub-bandgap illumination losses and a low power-conversion efficiency.8
The membrane properties were chosen to mirror those of Nafion 117, equilibrated with liquid water.29,30 Base catalyst properties are for Pt at the cathode and RuO2 at the anode. Other properties that cannot be inferred based upon the choice of materials are listed in Table 1. The length of each region of the triple-junction light absorber was fixed so that the amount of light absorbed in each region would be equal. The properties described in this paragraph and listed in Table 1 are used for all figures unless otherwise noted.

Results and discussion
Full model analysis

Fig. 2 shows the power curve and load curves (with and without consideration of crossover) for the device. The power curve is due to the properties of the light absorber, meaning that the solid curve in Fig. 2 represents the i–V characteristic of the circuit segment AB in Fig. 1b. The load curves, in turn, represent the i–V characteristic of circuit segments BC, CD, and DA taken together in series. Because these two circuits are linked at nodes A and B, the device is constrained to operate at the intersection between the two curves. Such load-circuit analysis has long been used, and it has been applied previously for the specific case of PEC devices.12,31
 Fig. 2  The effect of crossover on the load curve. The device modeled here has a total thickness of 20 μm. The solid line is the power curve calculated for a triple-junction silicon light absorber as described in Model description. Points of operation are circled. The asterisk on the load curve indicates the point where zero net hydrogen is collected because the flow rates of the outlet gases drop to zero. 
In a departure from previous work, the approach here involves solving the governing physical equations numerically in 1-D, taking into account the transport of all relevant species as well as the absorption of light. There is a significant benefit to this approach. Aside from yielding the circled intersection points in Fig. 2, this approach also computes all concentrations and the electrostatic potential as a function of position in both the light absorber and the membrane. This allows coupling not just the current and potential at node points A and B, but also the concentrations of all species. This is essential because the concentration of species in the electrolyte can modify the overall cell potential by affecting at least two properties of the electrolyte–absorber interface: the rate of charge transfer and the amount of band bending.

Fig. 2 illustrates one concrete example of how solving the full set of governing equations allows one to calculate critical features of device operation. If neglecting gas transport, one assumes complete collection of any H2 produced; therefore, the intersection point is the amount of hydrogen collected, converted to a current density by Faraday's law. Changing the thickness changes the power curve of the light absorber. Longer lengths allow one to absorb more light, potentially leading to increased current.
However, eventually current will decline due to transport limitations in the light absorber, which can be serious for devices grown on the microscale. The model predicts the optimum thickness to be 10 μm.
Realistically, some fraction of the gas produced will penetrate the membrane. The impact of neglecting losses due to gas crossover can be appreciable. The amount of crossover is a function of the properties of the membrane in a given environment, most importantly the thickness and permeation coefficients for H2 and O2, ψH2 and ψH2. The effect of gas crossover on device operation at a given permeability and thickness is to increase the total operating current density, itot, but to decrease the net amount of hydrogen collected, iH2,net. This result is summarized in Table 2.

Fig. 3 plots the faradaic efficiency and the collection efficiency as functions of device thickness, along with the total H2 collected from the cathode outlet, iH2,net. In the limit of small lengths, collection efficiency is low, bringing iH2,net to zero. This decline happens while the faradaic efficiency is still relatively high, which means that even though the correct reaction is running at the cathode, most of the product is crossing over and being lost. In the mid-range, both faradaic efficiency and collection efficiency are relatively high, and iH2,net reaches a maximum. Despite relatively stable efficiencies at higher lengths, the total H2 collected declines. This is due to a drop in total current because of recombination of electrons and holes in the light absorber.
 Fig. 3  Dependence of total current (thick black line) and net hydrogen collected (thin blue line) upon device thickness, along with trends in faradaic efficiency (dashed green) and collection efficiency (dotted red). 
Several interesting conclusions can be drawn from the analysis so far. Primarily, consideration of gas crossover can shift the optimum thickness for hydrogen production significantly – from 10 to 30 μm in this case. A corollary to this argument is the fact that the total operating current density (that is, the intersection point on load-curve diagrams like Fig. 2) is not a good metric for device performance. Net H2 collected should be used instead. In fact, determining the net H2 production gives a handy shortcut to the true STF efficiency from eqn (4): (7)Here, ΔGprod is the difference in Gibbs free energy for the products, and Pin,solar is the power contained in the solar flux hitting the device.
Along with iH2,net, one must also know the composition of the head space. Not only is this necessary to calculate ΔGprod in the formula above, it is vital to ensure that the gas outlets do not stray into the regime of explosive mixtures. If one solves the governing differential equations as done in this paper, the compositions of the head spaces are calculated as part of the model solution, since they are coupled to the rates of each reaction and the flux of species through the membrane. Product purity is therefore evaluated directly.
For all results presented in this paper, the head space on the cathode side contains only hydrogen saturated with water vapor, and the anode head space contains only oxygen saturated with water. This is partially a result of the choice of how to model the system. Material balances on the head space gases included three terms: a generation/consumption rate at the electrode, a flux through the outlet, and a flux through the membrane. The electrode rates were assumed to be kinetically limited; mass-transfer resistance was taken to be zero. This is because the mass-transfer resistance through the membrane (from point C to D in Fig. 1b) was assumed to be much larger than the resistance from the membrane near the electrode to the electrode (from C to B, or D to A).
The geometry of the absorber-in-membrane device (see Fig. 1) influences the assumption of the previous paragraph. Gases that cross over the membrane simultaneously encounter the opposite electrode and the opposite head space (drawn as a porous electrode). If the distance between where the gaseous species encounter the head space and where they encounter the electrode is significant, then the zero mass transfer resistance assumption would need to be relaxed. Examples include widely spaced wires with catalysts only on the tips, large planar absorbers,40 or an MEA-type setup with a gas diffusion layer between the membrane and the electrode. This effect is explored in our next paper, to follow shortly.
The electrode kinetics have little influence on the presence of gases in the opposite head space. Since the overpotential for H2 oxidation (the reverse of the reaction in eqn (5b)) at the anode is very large, the rate of reaction is not kinetically limited for reasonable values of i0,H2,an and the transfer coefficients. Setting i0,H2,an = 10−14 A cm−2 gives an anode headspace that has pH2,an = 0.2 bar when zero net current is passing, but if the circuit with the light absorber is closed, the device runs at a current density of iabs = 4.9 mA cm−2 and pH2,an = 10−17 bar, which is well below detectable limits. A similar argument applies for O2 in the cathode head space. The large driving force for the crossover reactions makes it extremely likely that their rates will be mass-transfer limited.
The asterisk in Fig. 2 marks the point on the load curve where zero net hydrogen is collected, below which the device is a net consumer of H2 and O2, similar to a fuel cell with high crossover.41 This is also reflected in the negative value for iH2,net in Table 2. These are consequences of model assumptions, namely that the system is held isobaric at 1 bar and the only components in the vapor phase are hydrogen, oxygen, and water. Although one could add an inert gas to allow lower partial pressures of H2 and O2, little insight would be gained because it is undesirable to operate in this regime.42
Having established a baseline case, one can vary the relevant parameters to illuminate their impact on device performance. In Fig. 4a, three different OER catalysts in acidic conditions are compared. Platinum is used for the HER catalyst in each case, and acidic conditions are assumed. The ruthenium oxide catalyst provides the best activity, but is unstable without alloying with iridium oxide.33 Burke et al.39 show that the exchange current density and Tafel slope for RuO2 do not vary with the ratio of electrochemically active surface area to superficial area (denoted ξan and ξca here). Distinguishing an improvement in the density of active sites from an improvement in the catalytic activity of those sites depends on having such experimental data. The model responds similarly whether i0 or ξ is increased.
 Fig. 4  A comparison of improvements in catalyst kinetics versus improvements in membrane conductivity. The light absorber used here is again triple-junction silicon, but with a minority carrier lifetime of 1 μs. The device thickness is 40 μm. (a) Effect of catalyst activity. Platinum for the HER catalyst, acidic conditions, and Nafion membrane properties are assumed for all three load curves, but each uses different parameters for OER kinetics. The OER catalysts are platinum (i0 = 2 × 10−10 A cm−2, α = 0.6, ξan = 1),36 an oxide of platinum, iridium, and ruthenium (i0 = 3.6 × 10−7 A cm−2, α = 0.66, ξan = 1),43 and ruthenium oxide (i0 = 7.5 × 10−9 A cm−2, α = 0.64, ξan = 20).33,39 (b) Effect of relative humidity (RH). All load curves use RuO2 for OER and Pt for HER in acidic conditions. The power curve for the solar cell changed because now T = 40 °C (the temperature at which the hydration-state data were taken). For RH 100%, κm = 7.8 × 10−2 S cm−1. RH 30% gives κm = 1.18 × 10−3 S cm1, and RH 20% gives κm = 1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1. ψH2 and ψO2 at these values of RH can be calculated from plot (c) below. (c) Permeation coefficients for hydrogen (solid blue) and oxygen (dashed red) through Nafion 117 (thick lines) plotted against conductivity at 40 °C. Adapted from data for conductivity vs. hydration state29,30 and permeation vs. relative humidity.44 Net H2 produced goes through a maximum at lower values of conductivity and permeation coefficient, marked by the triangles on the plot. To improve upon the properties of Nafion, new materials must lie at least in part below these curves. The simplest example is a linear correlation (thin lines and squares). (d) Net hydrogen produced as a function of conductivity. The solid line is for the properties of Nafion, while the dotted blue line shows the result when the trend between κ and ψ is a linear profile as in (c) above. The value of the maximum is increased from 6.97 to 7.37 mA cm−2. 
In Fig. 4b, the relative humidity is modulated, as it would be in a vapor-fed device.17,18 It is well known that the conductivity of Nafion increases with water content, reaching a peak value of κm = 0.1 S cm−1 when equilibrated with liquid water.29 This is evident in the diagram, where the slope of the load curves at high potentials is proportional to the conductivity. For reference, the load curve for liquid-equilibrated Nafion nearly overlaps the curve for RH = 100% and was thus excluded for clarity. The operating point for κm = 0.1 S cm−1 is near the maximum power point of the solar cell, which is located at the bend in the power curve. As the other curves show, κm must drop two orders of magnitude below that value before the intersection point moves slightly (and close to three orders of magnitude before the operating current density decreases noticeably). Changing i0 by orders of magnitude in Fig. 4a has a much greater impact on device performance than changing κm by an equivalent amount in Fig. 4b.
Increasing the water content has the adverse effect of increasing the permeability of the membrane to gases.44 The permeation coefficients are plotted against κm in Fig. 4c. The independent variable is actually the relative humidity of the environment (and therefore the equilibrium water content). As expected, a tradeoff exists where one must endure a drop in conductivity to achieve a drop in permeability. In addition to the Nafion data, the thin lines represent a hypothetical new material with a linear relationship between ψ and κm that also obeys this tradeoff. Because the tradeoff exists, maximum net H2 collection should correspond to a specific value of the relative humidity, as shown in Fig. 4d for both Nafion and the supposed new material.
Impact of permeability
Because the optimum conductivity values in Fig. 4c and d are nearly equal for the Nafion curve and the linear relationship, one would like to know the impact of changing only the permeation coefficient without affecting the conductivity. The effect of doing so is shown in Fig. 5a. The optimum device thickness declines along with ψ because, when less H2 is lost to crossover, the maximum net H2 production moves closer to the maximum total current (see Fig. 3). Of course, the limiting case of zero permeability would produce the same value for the maximum iH2,net and the maximum itot. However, one cannot achieve the maximum itot of 6.99 mA cm−2 shown in Fig. 3 through reduction in ψ alone, because part of the current at that location on the curve is due to gas crossover. Therefore, as ψ decreases, one expects the maximum total current to decline, even as the maximum net H2 production is increasing. This is confirmed in Fig. 5b, where the limiting value of iH2,net for an impermeable membrane is seen to be 6.5 mA cm−2. An important finding from this plot is that iH2,net increases 63% from 3.73 to 6.09 mA cm−2 by decreasing ψ from ψNafion to 0.1ψNafion, but the incremental increase by decreasing further to 0.01ψNafion is only another 10% to reach a total of 6.46 mA cm−2.
 Fig. 5  Impact of permeation coefficient. (a) iH2,net is plotted against L for several different values of the ratio ψ/ψNafion, which is the parameter identifying each curve. Both ψH2 and ψO2 are subject to the same ratio. The values of ψNafion used for the reference case assume T = 25 °C and a liquid-equilibrated membrane. (b) Maximum net H2 production (iH2,net) and maximum total current (itot) as functions of permeability. 
These results suggest a strategy to pursue polymers that improve upon Nafion for solar fuels applications. Device performance would improve with a membrane that blocked gas crossover better, as long as the conductivity does not decline too much. In fact, Fig. 4c provides a handy metric for evaluating whether such a new polymer will indeed improve upon Nafion. If the measured properties of the polymer fall below the curves for Nafion, then the amount of hydrogen collected will increase. An example would be the linear profiles given by the dotted lines in Fig. 4d. However, the curves for the new material might cross the curves for Nafion, or the curves might not extend below the triangles on the graph. It is also conceivable that the H2 permeation could be above the Nafion curve while the O2 permeation could be below its corresponding Nafion reference point, or vice versa. In any of these less straightforward scenarios, it would be necessary to run the full simulations to determine the net H2 produced for the new material, producing a plot comparable to Fig. 4d for the new material.
Because the maximum in iH2,net is so broad in Fig. 4d, modulating the relative humidity of Nafion turns out to be a rather ineffective strategy for exploiting the tradeoff between ψ and κm. Instead, one could vary the thickness. The full results of doing so are shown in Fig. 3, but the argument can be made with a simpler analysis.
Simplified analysis
The ohmic loss ΔΦohm through a device is determined by (8)
In order to estimate iabs, the absorber current–voltage relationship can be approximated by a diode equation with a short-circuit current isc, an open-circuit potential Voc, and a diode ideality factor nid24: (9)where V = (U + ΔΦohm + ηan − ηca) is the potential difference between anode and cathode. U is the open circuit potential for water splitting (1.229 V for liquid water at 1 bar and 25 °C), and ηan and ηca are the anode and cathode overpotentials, respectively. The overpotentials can be estimated with Tafel kinetics: (10) (11)

Eqn (8)–(11) can be solved to approximate the total current and the ohmic drop through the system. The current lost due to hydrogen crossover is (12)with a similar expression for current lost due to oxygen crossover, iO2,XO. The net hydrogen collected is then iH2,net = iabs − iH2,XO − iO2,XO(13)

Eqn 13 uses the approximation that all gases that cross over are consumed at the opposite electrode. In other words, the product streams are pure H2 and O2. The tradeoff between gas crossover and ohmic drop can be studied by plotting the solution to eqn (8)–(13) in Fig. 6, varying either the relative humidity or the device thickness to cause ψ and κm to change. This simple analysis properly predicts that there is a tradeoff between the two effects. The optimum iH2,net predicted in Fig. 6a is 8 mA cm−2 at a value of κm = 4.7 × 10−3 S cm−1, which comes reasonably close to the answers of 6.97 mA cm−2 and κm = 8 × 10−3 S cm−1 from the detailed calculations (see Fig. 4d). However, this type of crude analysis cannot quantitatively predict the optimum thickness. These simpler equations yield a maximum iH2,net of 5.15 mA cm−2 at 850 μm, which compares unfavorably with the 3.73 mA cm−2 peak at 30 μm in Fig. 3. This is because the tradeoff between gas blocking and ohmic loss is less important than the tradeoff between gas blocking and electron–hole recombination in the light absorber for the material properties chosen here. The simplified analysis does not include the dependence of the power curve, iabs(V), on L, and therefore it cannot quantitatively optimize the thickness of an absorber-in-membrane style device. However, these simple arguments are still instructive in that they illustrate the tradeoffs between blocking gases and conducting ions, which were investigated quantitatively in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 6  Simplified analysis of the tradeoff between ohmic losses and gas crossover. These plots use the material properties from Table 1 in addition to isc = 9.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.84 V, and nid = 1.2. These three parameters were chosen to match the absorber power curve from Fig. 4b. (a) ψ and κm are modified by varying the relative humidity. Again, all material properties took their default values but were adjusted to T = 40 °C to work with the available data for relative humidity. (b) ψ and κm are fixed to their values for liquid-equilibrated Nafion at 25 °C, but the relative impacts of gas crossover and ohmic loss are modified by varying L. isc = 5.91 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.74 V, and nid = 1.2 were chosen to match the absorber power curve from Fig. 2. 
Conclusions
An integrated device model that solves the coupled differential equations that govern PECs was used to study light-absorbing particles embedded in a membrane. If one assumes zero mass-transfer resistance between the membrane and the catalysts, the head-space gas compositions are maintained as water-saturated hydrogen in the cathode and water-saturated oxygen in the anode. This assumption should closely approximate the absorber-in-membrane geometry with a porous electrode where crossover gases interact with the opposite catalyst before reaching the opposite head space. Keeping the gases separate is a vital characteristic of any practical solar-fuel generator, and the composition of the gas outlets is a key figure of merit that should be measured and reported for all proposed designs.
Still, the absorber-in-membrane design is vulnerable to a different problem caused by crossover: a reduction in current efficiency. If the material properties, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity are all fixed, the thickness for maximum ηI can be determined. This does not necessarily coincide with the thickness for maximum iH2,net (see Fig. 3) because the characteristics of the light absorber also depend on the thickness. For the material properties in Table 1 and a 3-junction Si light absorber with the characteristics shown in Fig. 2, the optimum thickness is 30 μm. This is a factor of 3 higher than the thickness that maximizes the operating current density in the light absorber, and a factor of 2 higher than the thickness that maximizes the operating current density if crossover is neglected entirely. Crossover must be considered to predict device performance accurately, and iH2,net, not itot, is the appropriate figure of merit.
The properties of the membrane, most notably the permeability, strongly influence the optimum device thickness. Lowering ψ allows the optimum thickness for net H2 collection to decrease, even as total current declines due to reduced crossover current. The zero-permeability limit represents the largest possible improvement in net H2 collection – in the case shown here, iH2,net improved from 3.73 to 6.5 mA cm−2 by allowing ψ to approach zero. Decreasing ψ by a factor of 10 would yield about 85% of the possible improvement, and decreasing by a factor of 100 would yield about 98%. Thus, there is a threshold after which further lowering ψ will produce diminishing returns for the overall device performance.
The trade-off between permeability and conductivity was explained with a simple calculation using an ideal diode curve, and it was shown quantitatively with the full model for the case of Nafion with varying water content. New polymers for water electrolysis should target properties that fall below the curves for Nafion on Fig. 4c. In addition, holding all other properties constant, we find that κm can fall to ∼10−3 S cm−1 before the load curve shifts significantly. This indicates that new membranes have a target window: up to two orders of magnitude in κm can be sacrificed to gain at least one order of magnitude in ψ.
Progress in photoelectrochemical fuels requires having clearly defined goals. To that end, this work highlights the need to separate products and report the composition of the product streams. Polymer electrolyte membranes are a viable candidate for separators. Future studies will look to improve upon the properties of existing polymers for solar-fuels applications, using the metrics established here as a guide.

The current–voltage relationship between nodes A and B is determined by solar-cell device physics. The segments BC and DA are determined by Butler–Volmer kinetics, and the segment CD is determined by solving dilute-solution transport equations for regions of membrane and/or electrolyte. If a uniformly-hydrated membrane is the only electrolyte, ionic concentration gradients can be neglected, and segment CD can be approximated by Ohm's law through a resistive medium.

 	Fig. 2  The effect of crossover on the load curve. The device modeled here has a total thickness of 20 μm. The solid line is the power curve calculated for a triple-junction silicon light absorber as described in Model description. Points of operation are circled. The asterisk on the load curve indicates the point where zero net hydrogen is collected because the flow rates of the outlet gases drop to zero.

 	Fig. 4  A comparison of improvements in catalyst kinetics versus improvements in membrane conductivity. The light absorber used here is again triple-junction silicon, but with a minority carrier lifetime of 1 μs. The device thickness is 40 μm. (a) Effect of catalyst activity. Platinum for the HER catalyst, acidic conditions, and Nafion membrane properties are assumed for all three load curves, but each uses different parameters for OER kinetics. The OER catalysts are platinum (i0 = 2 × 10−10 A cm−2, α = 0.6, ξan = 1),36 an oxide of platinum, iridium, and ruthenium (i0 = 3.6 × 10−7 A cm−2, α = 0.66, ξan = 1),43 and ruthenium oxide (i0 = 7.5 × 10−9 A cm−2, α = 0.64, ξan = 20).33,39 (b) Effect of relative humidity (RH). All load curves use RuO2 for OER and Pt for HER in acidic conditions. The power curve for the solar cell changed because now T = 40 °C (the temperature at which the hydration-state data were taken). For RH 100%, κm = 7.8 × 10−2 S cm−1. RH 30% gives κm = 1.18 × 10−3 S cm1, and RH 20% gives κm = 1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1. ψH2 and ψO2 at these values of RH can be calculated from plot (c) below. (c) Permeation coefficients for hydrogen (solid blue) and oxygen (dashed red) through Nafion 117 (thick lines) plotted against conductivity at 40 °C. Adapted from data for conductivity vs. hydration state29,30 and permeation vs. relative humidity.44 Net H2 produced goes through a maximum at lower values of conductivity and permeation coefficient, marked by the triangles on the plot. To improve upon the properties of Nafion, new materials must lie at least in part below these curves. The simplest example is a linear correlation (thin lines and squares). (d) Net hydrogen produced as a function of conductivity. The solid line is for the properties of Nafion, while the dotted blue line shows the result when the trend between κ and ψ is a linear profile as in (c) above. The value of the maximum is increased from 6.97 to 7.37 mA cm−2.	 

 	Fig. 5  Impact of permeation coefficient. (a) iH2,net is plotted against L for several different values of the ratio ψ/ψNafion, which is the parameter identifying each curve. Both ψH2 and ψO2 are subject to the same ratio. The values of ψNafion used for the reference case assume T = 25 °C and a liquid-equilibrated membrane.

These plots use the material properties from Table 1 in addition to isc = 9.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.84 V, and nid = 1.2. These three parameters were chosen to match the absorber power curve from Fig. 4b.
