    , Accepted 15th January 2019First published on 22nd January 2019AbstractA new class of functional materials, carbon nitrides, has recently attracted the attention of researchers. Carbon nitride is a metal-free carbonaceous material, possessing a high N:C ratio with structure ranging from polymeric to graphitic form, constituting heptazine or triazine rings as structural motifs. It entered into the frame as a heterogeneous photocatalyst owing to its medium band gap, porosity, and high thermal and chemical inertness. Intensive research aimed towards exploring its inherent potentials has opened up a new area of study in the field of sensors; moreover, due to tunability of its electronic and optical properties, high stability, biocompatibility and low cost, it can be used in the area of sensing. In this review, we highlighted various strategies for the development of nanoscale morphological varieties of carbon nitrides and fabrication of sensors based on the luminescence properties of the carbon nitride materials. Herein, we exclusively envisioned new vistas for carbon nitrides as an imperative candidate for the fabrication of ideal sensors.Marilyn Mary XavierMiss Marilyn Mary Xavier is a CSIR research fellow doing her research in the area of carbon nitride-based photocatalysis in the Advanced Molecular Materials Research Centre (AMMRC), Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU), Kottayam, Kerala, India.

Introduction
With the advent in science and technology, spectacular changes are occurring in various realms. Among these areas is the fabrication of spectroscopic sensors, doted on account of their high sensitivity and exquisite spatiotemporal assay.1 Spectroscopic probes employ changes in the spectroscopic properties of the sensors on their interaction with the targeted analytes. It is a flourishing area, wherein highly specific probes have been fabricated with exemplary sensitivity along with the development of new sensors with credible properties.2 Carbon nitrides are a class of functional materials that have been recognised as a potential material for energy and sustainable applications. These are compounds with high N:C ratios built from the thermal condensation of carbon and nitrogen-containing compounds as precursors. To date, all known and some hypothetical carbon nitride materials contain triazine (1,3,5-triazine C3N3) and heptazine (1,3,4,6,9,9b-heptaazaphenalene, C6N7) as structural motifs (Fig. 1).3–5

The keen interest in these materials begins with a theoretical prediction on carbon(IV) nitrides, which are structurally analogous to diamond and graphite, by Liu and Cohen.6 Since then, many attempts have been made to synthesize them, but most of them have been unsuccessful to obtain the predicted ordered solids. However, these attempts to synthesize carbon(IV) nitrides with remarkable properties had resulted in the achievement of carbon and nitrogen-containing polymeric materials named as polymeric carbon nitrides. Mostly, triazine and heptazine-based molecules were considered important precursors and side products in the synthesis of polymeric carbon nitrides. The chemical composition of the materials as well as the nature of the local to extended structures of the as-obtained polymeric solids determines their chemical, electronic and optical properties. Hence, it is a challenge to establish a complete assessment and calibration of the structure–functionality relationships among carbon nitrides.
The term g-C3N4 or graphitic carbon nitride is widely used for carbon nitride materials and also for materials that contain hydrogen as an essential component of their structure along with carbon and nitrogen. So, it is better to represent those materials as CxNyHz compounds, and the term g-C3N4 should be reserved for those materials that closely match that ideal stoichiometry. The zigzag polymeric chains obtained by joining the heptazine units, similar to Liebig's melon, can be classified as polymeric carbon nitrides. Thus, the product formed by the pyrolysis of carbon and nitrogen-containing molecular compounds like melamine, urea, cyanamide, dicyandiamide, etc. is a polymeric carbon nitride or Liebig's melon and not graphitic carbon nitride.7 Only a few reports described the structures with fully condensed layers with C3N4 stoichiometry, and it is found that triazine rings are the building blocks of that highly ordered structures rather than heptazine rings.8,9 Heptazine-based g-C3N4 remains still as a theoretical prediction. A more authenticate description on the structural motifs and the nomenclature of carbon nitrides are excellently elaborated upon in most recent reviews by Miller et al. and Kessler et al.10,11
Considering the catalytic and other applications for which this material could be employed, focus should be kept on the defect-containing polymeric material, as they possess more potential than perfect crystalline materials. Fig. 2 depicts various functional groups present on the surface of a defective polymeric carbon nitride. These surface functional moieties impart excellent properties to the defective ones compared to perfect crystalline materials.12

The employment of carbon nitrides in heterogeneous catalysis by Goettmann, F et al. in 2006 initiated the exploitation of the same for various applications.13 Later, the report on photocatalytic H2 production by Wang et al. in 2009 had popularized the topic into a hot research topic.7 This established the pathway for defective carbon nitride, its synthesis and modifications.
The richness in the nitrogen ingredient makes it admirable in many fields as the basic nature of nitrogen enhances π-bonding and improves stability. The peculiar electronic properties can be attributed to the lone pair valence band formed by the lone pair of nitrogen and a conduction band consisting of the pz orbital of carbon.14 The presence of earth-abundant elements like carbon and nitrogen in this polymeric structure makes it versatile and also endows it with excellent properties, which enable it to expand its potential applications.
The introduction of polymeric carbon nitride as a metal-free semiconductor photocatalyst for H2 production spurred the scientific world to explore more on this material. Even though its thermal stability and chemical inertness (solubility and reactivity) was a barrier for conducting more studies on it back then, it is now no longer a bottleneck when studying its intriguing properties. The advancement in characterization techniques accentuates carbon nitrides, unleashing its many potentials. The tunability of its electronic and optical properties, high stability, biocompatibility and low cost add to its value for use in the area of sensing. Henceforth, its debut in the field of sensing is not surprising. To the best of our knowledge, there is no review hitherto that critically presents the sensing properties of carbon nitrides in detail.
In this review, we intend to introduce carbon nitride materials, the physiochemical properties that make them unique, in brief, and provide an extensive overview into the development of carbon nitrides in the field of sensors, especially as spectroscopic sensors. It will be an exclusive article for those who are working on optical sensors.
Unique properties of carbon nitrides
Carbon nitrides have earned considerable attention as potential materials for developing sensors owing to their exchangeable N–H groups and redox functionality. Unlike graphene, which is a zero-band gap semiconductor, polymeric carbon nitride is a medium band gap semiconductor with tunable electronic structure. The high thermal and chemical stability of carbon nitride were once a barrier for the extensive study of the material, but the same became a blessing for the fabrication of polymeric carbon nitride as an excellent metal-free, semiconductor material. Basic tectonic units of carbon nitride materials are triazine and tri-s-triazine rings,5,15 among which tri-s-triazine-based carbon nitrides are energetically favoured.16,17
Even though initially, polymeric carbon nitride was identified as a photocatalyst solely consisting of carbon and nitrogen, its role as a photoelectronic material has come into the limelight with controllable modulation of its electronic structure. The lone pair of electrons in the nitrogen atoms of tri-s-triazine tectonic units endows PCN (polymeric carbon nitride) unique electronic structure. Investigations by Abd El-kader et al. proposed the crucial role played by the lone pair electrons of nitrogen in the electronic structure of carbon nitrides.18 The implementation of DFT calculations to gain insight into the electronic structure indicates that the HOMO–LUMO band gap decreases as the condensation polymerization proceeds from melem (3.5 eV) to melon (2.6 eV) and finally to fully condensed g-C3N4 (2.1 eV).19 The reduction and oxidation levels of water splitting are located in between the HOMO–LUMO band gap of carbon nitride.
Being metal-free and containing earth-abundant elements like carbon and nitrogen render the material nontoxicity and biocompatibility, which in turn allow its investment in biological applications.20 Carbon nitride can be easily functionalized, making it a better platform for developing colour-tunable luminescent materials.21 Each tri-s-triazine unit in polymeric carbon nitride acts as a quasi-monomer, and the excitation and radiative recombination of molecular singlet excitons depends on the distance between the neighboring tri-s-triazine units perpendicular to the aromatic system (Fig. 1).22 The optical properties in the visible-near-ultraviolet energy range of the carbon nitride materials are related mainly to the π bonding, π* antibonding, and the nonbonding (lone pair electrons at the N sites) states.23
Advancements in the modifications of carbon nitride
Carbon nitride, being a potential functional material, has some limitations in achieving its maximum activity. Extensive research has been conducted on extending its potentiality. The synthesis of various morphological varieties and modification techniques were employed to improve its performances. Here, we intend to briefly discuss some of the recent modification techniques that have been used for carbon nitride.
The co-polymerization technique has been used to anchor some organic co-monomers onto the molecular structure of the polymeric carbon nitride, which indeed has had a profound effect on the electronic and optical properties of the material. Carbon nitrides anchored with 2-aminobenzonitrile had shown better photocatalytic hydrogen evolution compared to pristine carbon nitrides.24,25 The doping of heteroatoms has become a widely employed modification technique. Heteroatom doping involves the doping of cations and anions into the carbon nitride framework. Oxygen and barium ions co-doped in amorphous carbon nitride has exhibited photocatalytic NO oxidation without any formation of toxic intermediates.26 Li et al. had achieved intralayer functionalization of the carbon nitride with O (oxygen) and interlayer intercalation with K (potassium), creating internal van der Waals heterostructures, thereby enhancing the interlayer Coulomb interaction and facilitating spatially oriented charge separation. Potassium does not intercalate spontaneously into carbon nitride layered structures (the so-called PTI materials). It was thought that it could be forced in from K+/solvated electron solutions in liquid NH3 to yield charged sheets, and then the interaction of this material with H2O would cause the release of H2 that forces the layers apart.27 Graphene-like porous carbon nitride was obtained by a secondary thermal treatment of the synthesized carbon nitride, significantly enhances its performance in the photocatalytic removal of nitrous oxides due to the improved charge separation.28 The activity and selectivity in the photocatalytic removal of NO was immensely achieved by calcium (Ca) intercalated carbon nitrides.29 Also, selective photocatalytic NO conversion was obtained by Sr (strontium) intercalated carbon nitrides.30 Carbon nitride layers intercalated with potassium and chloride ions granted the carbon nitride a dual electronic channel to part away both the electrons and holes formed on the carbon nitride sheets, thereby enhancing its NOx removal performance.31 Another modification technique is the sensitization of carbon nitrides with dyes like eosin Y,32 metal phthalocyanines,33 fluorescein and dibromofluorescein. Dye sensitization favours an increase in accessible surface area and overall mass transfer making it an efficient photocatalyst. Various structural modifications and functionalizations were elaborately explained in some of these reviews.34–36
Sensors based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL)
A keen observation of a light emission phenomenon during electrolysis in 1920s37,38 and later an in-depth study by Hercules39 and Bard40et al. paved the way to a new technique called electrochemiluminescence (ECL). In this process, species generated at the electrode undergo high-energy electron transfer reactions to form excited states that emit light.41 Extensive research on this phenomenon has opened up a plethora of applications made possible using this technique. The high selectivity, sensitivity and rapidity made electrochemiluminescence a paramount technique mainly in the field of the fabrication of sensors for bioassays.42,43
In simple terms, ECL is a technique in which electrical energy is converted to radiative energy. Upon the application of electric energy in the form of voltage, a stable precursor near the electrode will produce an intermediate, which then interacts with co-reactants in the medium to establish an excited state that can emit light (Fig. 3). Here, luminescence is initiated and controlled by the electrode voltage unlike in chemical luminescence.41
 Fig. 3  Schematic of an ECL sensor. 
Owing to their high sensitivity, luminophores exhibiting the property of ECL have been well-exploited for the development of chemosensors and biosensors.44,45 Recently developed biosensors lack a simple fabrication procedure and reproducibility, which hindered their further development into the level of an analytical device. Carbon nitride with its highly tunable electronic structure, which accounts for the presence of nitrogen in the carbon materials, makes it an efficient candidate for exhibiting ECL. Moreover, its facile mode of preparation and nontoxicity promotes the development of sensitive ECL-based sensors, which are pictorially represented in Fig. 4.46 One of the challenges of improving the sensing performance of carbon nitride could be addressed by simply doping it with other elements or by the preparation of nanocomposites, which involves simple procedures unlike other ECL luminophores.

A sandwich model of an ECL biosensor was developed to monitor the activity of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (Gal T), an enzyme in the family of enzymes that monitors galactose transfer.47 This process is closely related to many biological processes like cell adhesion,48 cell communication,49 immune response50 and cancer progression.51
A carboxylated g-C3N4 possessing high surface area could accommodate GlcNAc-BSA (N-acetylglucosamine-BSA) on its surface for glycosylation reaction. The system has a strong ECL intensity, and when galactose is conjugated to GlcNAc-BSA in the presence of Gal T (galactosyltransferase) with UDP-Gal (uridine 50-diphosphogalactose disodium) as a co-reactor, the ECL intensity dimmed. However, a significant decrease in ECL intensity is observed after the Artocarpus integrifolia lectin (AIA) conjugated polystyrene microsphere (PSM) is introduced into the system. This nanoprobe possesses high specific interaction between galactose and AIA, and its poor conductivity is due to its high sensitivity towards Gal T.47 The natural ECL signal of g-C3N4 nanosheets can be enhanced by loading these nanosheets into the nanoporous gold matrix. An ECL immune sensor is then fabricated using this 3D nanoporous gold matrix incorporated with g-C3N4 nanosheets by incubating the matrix with antibodies and BSA to block nonspecific binding sites. A reduction in ECL intensity in accordance with immunoreactions relating to the concentration of the antigen IgG allows us to calculate the concentration of the same.52 Also, the g-C3N4 suspension in water fabricated with NaHSO3 and dissolved oxygen can produce strong ECL signals with the support of various metal ions.53 g-C3N4 can also be employed for the fabrication of Hg metal ion sensing in aqueous samples by a simple g-CNQD-K3Fe(CN)6 CL sensor, where Hg ions, due to their specific binding onto the g-CNQDs, could inhibit the CL intensity of the system.54 The ECL intensity of g-C3N4 QDs modified with nanoporous gold and DNAzyme as the recognition unit, have shown a linear relationship with regards to the concentration of Pb2+ in the analytes. The sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor accounts for the unique separation properties of r-GO Fe3O4 and the conductivity of NPG.55 Since the ECL signal of g-C3N4 alone is so weak, it has been used for detection purposes along with oxidizing co-reactants like K2S2O8 and H2O2. However, the presence of these co-reactants may destroy the stability and reproducibility of the system. A g-C3N4 sheet immobilized over rGO sheets was employed for an enhanced ECL signal and for the self-production of co-reactants. The system has shown a selective detection of Pb2+ ions in solutions.56 A Cu2+-sensing ECL sensor based on g-C3N4 has been developed, employing Na2S2O8 as a co-reactant.57 Charge transfer complex formation between dopamine and the AuNf@g-C3N4-PANI hybrid system facilitates wide linear range and a lower detection limit for dopamine in samples.58 Proteases and nucleases are potential diagnostic biomarkers by virtue of their substantial involvement in many biological processes. A permeability controlled logic-based ECL enzyme sensor employing g-C3N4 for the first time has been intelligently developed by Lichan Chen et al. for the assay of proteases and nucleases.59 Graphitic carbon nitrides nanosheets modified with gold nanoparticles exhibit strong and stable cathodic ECL activity, which can be used for the fabrication of a biosensor to detect carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA). A schematic representation of the same is shown in Fig. 5.60

A glucose sensor sensing through the competitive binding between DexP (phenoxy dextran) and glucose to ConA (Concanavalin A) was obtained. The modified electrode was formed by immobilizing DexP over the g-C3N4 nanosheet through π–π interaction. The binding of glucose to ConA would cause an elevation in the ECL signal intensity, as the ConA bound DexP-g-C3N4 hybrid exhibits no ECL signal.61 A stable and sensitive ECL sensing interface has been constructed by hybridizing g-C3N4 nanosheets with reduced graphene oxide, which helps to improve the conductivity of the hybrid system. The ECL signal of the system is quenched by the presence of folic acid, and hence could be used as a sensor for folic acid.62
Sensitive and selective I− ion sensing was established by quenching the CL intensity by the Ce(IV)-SO32− g-CNQDs CL system.63 An effective ECL sensor for melamine detection was fabricated through the π–π interaction of g-C3N4 nanosheets with C60.64 In all of its typical applications on ECL sensors, the cathodic ECL is utilized thus far, but anodic EC luminescence can also be used for sensing purposes. Such an attempt was made by Changming Cheng et al. for the monitoring of rutin, a bioactive glycoside (Fig. 6) (Table 1).65

A carbon paste electrode modified with g-C3N4 showed an enhanced ECL signal in the presence of triethanolamine (TEA). This enhanced signal was quenched in the presence of rutin and could then be used for its detection. A g-C3N4-graphene hybrid system where graphene acts as a support for immobilizing C3N4 and as an enhancer of the ECL signal was created, which could be employed for the sensitive detection of pentachlorophenol.66 A highly stable g-C3N4 sheet in aqueous solution showed an appreciable anodic EC luminescence in the presence of the co-reactant triethyl amine. However, the presence of dopamine in the analyte would quench the ECL emission, and hitherto it could be employed as a dopamine monitor.67
A luminol-H2O2-g-C3N4 nanosheets system was managed to be fabricated for the ultra-sensitive detection of a nitroaromatic explosive TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene). This system exhibits a strong emission due to the formation of an excited species from the luminol and superoxide radicals formed on the g-C3N4 nanosheets. However, in presence of a primary amino group-bearing species like TNT, there will be a donor–acceptor interaction between the excited species and TNT, thereby quenching the ECL signal. In addition to this, the hydroxide radicals will also be scavenged by TNT leading to the complete quenching of the ECL emission of the system.68 In real water samples, the detection of PFOA (pentafluorooctonic acid) can be achieved using an utg-C3N4 nanosheets/S2O82− system-induced electrochemiluminescence sensing probe.69 A Ag-g-C3N4 system with S2O82− as a co-reactant could be used for an on–off electrochemiluminescence for the detection of concanavalin A. In this sensing probe, DexP (phenoxy dextran) and glucose oxide are immobilized over Ag-gC3N4 on a carbon paste glassy electrode. Consequently, the target ConA (Concanavalin A) will be preferably adsorbed over DexP immobilized over the electrode. On the adsorbed ConA, PANI-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic acid (PTCA)-DexP-GOD conjugate was immobilized through a specific carbohydrate-ConA interaction, thereby leaving the whole system in an off state.70
The sensitive and reliable detection of cancer cells based on the ratiometric sensing of ECL signals from Ag-polyamidoamine(PAMAM)-luminol nanocomposites and g-C3N4 nanosheets has been developed by Wang et al.71 The system detects cancer cells via reductive–oxidative and oxidative–reductive ECL emissions from both the counterparts in the system reducing inevitable instrumental errors and the environmental factors that may arise in the single emission. The potential capability of graphitic carbon nitride-based systems for nucleic acid detection has been shown by an ECL-RET (Resonance Energy Transfer) system, where energy was transferred from the graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets to Ru(bpy)32+ for the sensitive detection of microRNA(miRNA).72
PEC (photoelectrochemical) sensors
Modern photoelectrochemistry (PEC) science was developed by Brattain and Garrett in 1950s,73 a long 100 years after the ground-breaking discovery of the photoelectric effect by Edmond Becquerel.74 This science possesses immense potential and receives much recognition in the multi-disciplinary area of research.75
Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) employs photochemical and electrochemical methods to study the oxidation–reduction interaction on ground and excited molecules or ions due to their interaction with light (Fig. 7). Integration of the PEC process with electrochemical bioanalysis paves a way towards the development of advanced PEC-based biosensors, which enable the study of various biological events. The emergence of graphitic carbon nitride as a PEC sensor is not shocking, as it is an active photocatalyst that can harvest light in the visible spectrum.

The monitoring of glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, PMG), an organophosphorus herbicide, can be done by a binding-induced internal-displacement strategy. Silver ions could be easily attached onto g-C3N4 due to its periodical nitrogen units in its backbone. This will spectacularly decrease the photocurrent signal, as the silver ions will act as an electron acceptor for the photogenerated electrons. However, in an alkaline environment, silver ions have a higher binding capacity with PMG due to their protonated functionalities. Hence, in a solution of PMG, the silver ions adhered to g-C3N4 are internally displaced by PMG to form the disilver glyphosate Ag2(HL) ligand, thereby providing a free pathway for the photogenerated electrons of g-C3N4 to the electrode surface and creating a corresponding photocurrent.76 An aptamer-based biosensor was fabricated using graphene oxide (GO) and water-dispersible graphite-like C3N4 (w-g-C3N4) nanocomposites for the detection of kanamycin, an antibiotic widely used to treat various infections. The biosensor was framed by immobilizing kanamycin binding the DNA aptamer onto the nanocomposite, which is facilitated by the large specific surface area and π–π interactions. When kanamycin is selectively bound to the DNA aptamer, an amplified photocurrent is observed as kanamycin on the sensing surface could prevent electron/hole recombination through oxidation utilizing photogenerated holes (Fig. 8).77

Another H-aptamer adsorbed on a ternary hybrid system CdS/g-C3N4/PPy was employed for the sensitive detection of adenosine, an endogenous nucleoside.78 In addition to this, the detection of certain pro proteinases is helpful in anticipating a disease and taking the necessary medications. For example, the ability to detect the Pro protein convertase subtilisin/kexintype6 (PCSK6), which is responsible for aggressive rheumatoid arthritis, would be very beneficial in the medical diagnosis field. Here, ZnO@CdTe nanocable arrays/carboxylated g-C3N4 is used as the PEC signal generator. The g-C3N4 is carboxylated to facilitate the immobilization of the DNA primer for PCSK6 through amidization protocol (i.e., the interaction between the amino groups of primers and the carboxyl groups on g-C3N4). ZnO@CdTe broadens the absorption range of the whole system and also enhances the photoresponse.
The selective binding of PCSK6 onto the primer is followed by a decrease in the photocurrent signal.79 Ill health in the liver or bones can be detected by monitoring the activity of a non-specific phosphomonoesterase alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The concentration of ALP is measured indirectly by measuring the concentration of ascorbic acid generated by the in situ hydrolysis of ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AA-P) catalyzed by ALP.80
The unique electronic properties and high electron mobility of carbon nanohorns (CNHs), combined with that of g-C3N4 through CNHs sensitized g-C3N4, have exhibited high photocatalytic and photochemical responses. The CNHs employed in the sensor not only enhanced the photocurrent response but also reduced the response time for the analysis. The sensor can selectively oxidize arecoline, an areca alkaloid, by filling its photogenerated holes with electrons from the analyte.81 The same group had administered a Au nanorods (NRs) decorated g-C3N4 hybrid, which chaperoned both the Schottky barrier and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect derived from the attachment of Au NRs to achieve admirable photocatalytic activity. This hybrid then managed to detect naringin (NA) via the introduction of mercapto-beta-cyclodextrin as a bionic recognition device into the hybrid.82 Meanwhile, Junyang Zhuang et al. had also succeeded in employing Au nanoparticles on the surface of g-C3N4 for surface plasmon resonance-enhanced light harvesting, resulting in a PEC sensing platform for monitoring T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) activity (Fig. 9).83

This strategy for sensing involves coupling the Au@g-C3N4 with a hairpin DNA. The PNK will then catalyze a phosphorylation reaction on DNA in the solution phase leading to the formation of a trigger DNA fragment. This trigger DNA fragment then opens up the hairpin structure of immobilized DNA by activating the hemin/G quadruplex-based DNAzyme sequence. The sensor will sense the blocking of light by an insulating precipitate on Au@g-C3N4 resulting from activated DNAzyme-catalyzed oxidization of 4-chloro-1-naphthol (4-CN).
A p–n heterojunction formed by g-C3N4 as an electron donor and dendritic zinc(II) phthalocyanine as an electron acceptor through axial coordination is applied to detect choline (a dietary essential nutrient) in real samples.84 A biosensor for the identification of microRNA was developed using gold nanoparticle-functionalized g-C3N4 as a photoactive material and anti-DNA:RNA antibody as the target microRNA recognition unit.85 PEC could be also used for monitoring antibiotics. A PEC sensor for ciprofloxacin, a widely used antibiotic, was created with the BiOCl/g-C3N4 composite with a heterojunction that could enhance the photoresponse. The enhanced photocurrent response of the heterojunction was reduced in the presence of ciprofloxacin.86 Paracetamol, another antibiotic, was also detected electrochemically by differential pulse voltammetry with the aid of protonated g-C3N4 sheets. Protonation would provide more active sites and defective sites for the g-C3N4 sheets. Even though this electrochemical method cannot compete with other systems available for the detection of paracetamol in terms of a lower detection limit, it offers a wide linear range of detection.87
To ensure food safety, the detection of various viruses is essential. One such virus is the avian leukosis viruses (ALVs), which occurs in chickens. The rapid and selective detection of ALVs has been reported by employing mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride-based electrochemical immunosensors. Mesoporous g-C3N4 possesses many advantages including large surface area, tunable pore diameter and large pore volume. These advantages in addition to integrated thionine, a widely used electron mediator, enhances detection sensitivity. The DPV (Differential Pulse Voltammetry) responses of the system help us to monitor the concentration of ALV (Fig. 10).88 Such a cost-effective detection strategy is beneficial for practical applications.

Ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets, prepared by a low-cost and greener method of ultrasonication-assisted liquid exfoliation, can be employed for the reduction of H2O2 and the biosensing of glucose in blood serum.89 Non-enzymatic high-performance PEC sensors for the amperometric detection of glucose is managed by a g-C3N4/alpha-Fe2O3 composite with good stability and reproducibility. The same composite also possesses super capacitance power.90 A nano-heterostructure consisting of graphitic carbon nitride and WO3 was also recently fabricated as a photoelectrochemical glucose sensor. The heterojunction between WO3 nanosheets and ultrathin g-C3N4 sheets reduces the electron–hole recombination rate owing to their increased interfaces and consequently boosting PEC performance. The photocurrent generated by the system increased with increasing glucose concentration (Fig. 11) (Table 2).91

Ultrathin gC3N4 (utg-C3N4), which could easily attach to the surface of a glassy carbon electrode without any film-forming agents, could sense Hg2+ ions because of its strong affinity towards –NH and –NH2via anode stripping voltammetric (ASV) current responses.92 The quantification of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter in mammals, was achieved by using both the electrochemical method (DPV) and the photoelectrochemical method.93 In the PEC sensing strategy, an enhanced photoanodic current is observed for g-C3N4 nanosheets anchored with TiO2 nanoparticles. The photocurrent of the system was enhanced upon the addition of dopamine, as it acts as a scavenger of photogenerated holes on the surface of the semiconductor.94 A nanohybrid in which formate anion-doped g-C3N4 is incorporated with the Cr(VI) ion-imprinted polymer (IIP) as a photoactive electrode (denoted as IIP@F-g-C3N4) is being employed for the detection of chromium ions in water samples.95 A Cu2+ ion sensing platform was fabricated with the help of graphene-like C3N496 and g-C3N4 nanorods.97
A AgX/C3N4 binary hybrid (X = Br, I) is also turned out to be a sensing platform for the selective and sensitive sensing of Cu2+ ions.98
Fluorescence sensors
In the present scenario of the accumulation of unwanted hazardous compounds in our ecosystem is a serious issue to be solved forthwith. But for this, the detection and monitoring of these compounds is crucial, and fluorescent techniques provide simple and feasible detection methods. To date, many fluorescent probes have been reported in literature based on various metal ions, organic dyes, quantum dots, semiconductors and others. In this technique, the sensing is done by detecting small alterations in the intensity of the fluorescence probe in the presence of the compound to be monitored. Unlike other fluorescent probes that have been fabricated so far, highly stable photoluminescence against photobleaching and low toxicity made g-C3N4 an eligible candidate for fabricating fluorescent sensors. The selective and sensitive binding of Cu2+ ions onto the ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets consisting of 3–4 layers, thereby quenching the fluorescence intensity of g-C3N4, could be useful for the detection of metal ions in real samples. Even though some metal ions may interrupt the detection mechanism, we could eliminate them using some capping agents for the same.99 Hg2+ ions can easily bond to the surface of g-CNQDs as the surface is negatively charged due to the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. This electrostatic interaction makes the electron transfer process easy and leads to the quenching of g-CNQDs fluorescence. When glutathione is introduced, the Hg2+ metal ion preferably goes with glutathione owing to its thiophilicity, retaining the original fluorescence signal of g-CNQDs.100 Graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets stripped from graphitic carbon nitride can be tuned for the detection of both Hg2+ ions and L-cysteine (L-Cys) through an off-on fluorescence probe. Hg2+ ions will form covalent bonds with the nitrogen on g-CNNS (graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets), thereby hindering the electron transfer process and quenching the fluorescence. But upon the introduction of L-Cys, mercury ions with more affinity to the thiol group will bind with the L-Cys, retaining the fluorescence of g-CNNS.101 g-CNQDs with an appreciable blue fluorescence could be used to form a switch-off fluorescence probe for the detection of Hg2+ ions, as it could form a non-fluorescent chelating complex with g-CNQDs. The same chelating complex could be employed for the determination of iodide ions, as in the presence of the iodide ion, the chelating complex will be destroyed due to the strong binding affinity of Hg2+ ions and iodide ions.102 g-C3N4 nanosheets were applied for tyrosine detection via a tyrosinase-initiated reaction resulting in the quenching of the fluorescence of nanosheets. When tyrosine is oxidized in presence of tyrosinase, it produces a melamine-like polymer which then gets adsorbed onto the g-C3N4 nanosheets and then quenches the fluorescence due to the FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between the melamine-like polymer and the nanosheets. Hence, the system could shed light upon the study on tyrosinase activity.103 A fluorescent nanoprobe to study the metabolic processes was fabricated using g-C3N4-MnO2 nanocomposites. FRET-induced electron transfer from g-C3N4 to MnO2 quenches the fluorescence of g-C3N4, and in the presence of glutathione, MnO2 is reduced to Mn2+, blocking the FRET energy transfer. This results in the regaining of fluorescent property of g-C3N4 (Fig. 12) (Table 3).104

A fluorescent probe employing the HRP-catalyzed (horseradish peroxidase) reaction of H2O2 with OPD (o-phenylenediamine), resulting in a product which not only quenches the fluorescent peak of g-C3N4 but also gives rise to another emission peak, could be applied for monitoring H2O2 and glucose.105 The hydrothermal treatment of bulk g-CN leads to the formation of F-g-CN (fluorescent graphitic carbon nitride) showing the fluorescence and selective detection of Fe2+ and Cu2+ ions through the quenching mechanism. Selective detection of these ions leads to their higher binding affinity and chelating kinetics with the N and O functional groups of F-GCN.106 A monolayer g-C3N4 shows sensitive and selective sensing of Ag+ ions in aqueous samples even in the presence of other metal ions.107 Selective imaging of biothiols in biological fluids was achieved by a turn-on assay based on the long-persisting luminescent property of g-C3N4.108 Fluorescent quenching due to the formation of the [Cu(CN)n]1−n species was employed to monitor the cyanide ion in the Cu2+-mpg-C3N4 system.109 Eun Zoo Lee et al. have developed an all-in-one sensor based on cubic mpg-C3N4 for the selective sensing of Cu2+ ions. The same system could also be utilized in the future as a vehicle to deliver drugs or DNA or for bioimaging.110
Certain non-metal-doped gCNQDs like P and O-doped gCNQDs shows strong fluorescence with a high quantum yield and could be used in cell imaging. The hike in fluorescence and quantum yield is due to the intrinsic n–π interaction and surface-oxidation.111 The exfoliation time and water dispersion could be easily measured when the g-C3N4 nanosheets are protonated. Protonation grants a positive charge to the surface, which could then interact easily with negatively charged species. The protonated system is used as a sensing platform for heparin.112 Chemically oxidized and exfoliated graphitic carbon nanosheets could act as a fluorescence ON–OFF sensor for the selective and sensitive detection of chromium(VI) (Cr(VI)) ions, which is a carcinogenic agent.113 The sensing is due to the inner filter effect (IFE), where the selective binding of Cr(VI) ions on g-C3N4 nanosheets quenches the fluorescence of nanosheets. Meanwhile, the fluorescence of the g-C3N4 nanosheets can be restored by oxidation–reduction of ascorbic acid and Cr(VI) and hence could be used as a fluorescence detector for ascorbic acid in biological samples. Similarly, on account of the strong IFE and molecular interactions between g-C3N4 nanosheets and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid, TNP), a nitroaromatic explosive was employed for the detection of TNP (Fig. 13).114

An efficient IFE system has been constructed by the adsorption of the thiol-specific chromogenic probe on the thiol-independent g-C3N4 fluorophore. This system has been used for the sensitive monitoring of biothiols in human serum.115
Huangxian Ju et al. have used the affinity of carbon nitride nanosheets (CNNS) to biomolecules as a sensing strategy to propose the design of a homogeneous fluorescence detection method for detecting DNA and related analytes.116 Carbon nitride nanosheets were also employed for the sensing of drugs like metronidazole (MNZ) through the gradual decrease in the fluorescence intensity of g-C3N4 nanosheets in the presence of this antibiotic.117 A fluorometric assay for heparin was designed, employing polyethylenimine (PEI)-coated silver nanoparticles and graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (Ag-g-CNQD/PEI) (Fig. 14).118
 Fig. 14  Schematic of heparin detection by g-C3N4 quantum dots fabricated with metal silver nanoparticles. Reprinted with permission from ref. 118, with permission from Springer Nature, Copyright 2018. 
A turn off-on fluorescent sensor based on g-C3N4 was developed for monitoring 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and Hg2+.119 Molecular interaction with 6-TG quenches the fluorescence of g-C3N4, and in presence of Hg2+, 6-TG binds more affectionately to Hg2+ thereby reducing its quenching effect on g-C3N4. The fluorescence of Ag-g-CNQD diminished when coated with PEI, and upon introducing heparin into the system, a strong affinity of PEI towards heparin will result in the regaining of its fluorescence emission. For DNA probes, a static quenching of CNNS fluorescence is observed, which accounts for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited DNA molecule to the conduction band of CNNS. A carboxylated g-C3N4, rich in N and O functional groups that provide faster chelating kinetics and a higher binding affinity towards Hg2+ and Fe3+ ions, could be used as a fluorescent sensor.120 A milestone for target detection in food analysis, Fe3O4/g-C3N4/HKUST-1 composites have been fabricated for the detection of ochratoxin A (OCA) in real samples.121 This composite with a high adsorption capacity quenches the fluorescence intensity of a dye-labelled aptamer through the photoinduced electron transfer mechanism (PET). OCA having high affinity towards the aptamer binds with the aptamer leading to its release from the surface of Fe3O4/g-C3N4/HKUST-1, resulting in a spike in fluorescence intensity. An aptamer-based fluorometric assay for cytochrome C has been identified using fluorescent graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets.122 These nanosheets are potential candidates for developing bioprobes and in the bioimaging field. The fluorescent and water dispersible nature of ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets makes it biocompatible. Jiang et al. had developed a label-free biosensor for detecting alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a biomarker in clinical diagnosis. The assay is done by monitoring the regaining of fluorescence of g-C3N4 by the chelating effect of Cu2+ ions loaded on g-C3N4 with pyrophosphate (PPi). Here, PPi acts as a substrate for ALP. N-moieties in g-C3N4 enable it to coordinate effectively with metal ions thereby quenching its fluorescence. A label-free strategy for pathogenic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene determination has been developed, employing the silver ion-cytosine bases duplex as probes.123 The specific combination with the HBV and the duplex sequence will free the silver ions, which in turn quench the g-C3N4 fluorescence. These types of biocompatible biosensors are invaluable in the biomedical field.
Conclusion and perspectives
This review has highlighted recent developments in graphitic carbon nitride-based sensors that have been reported over the past several years in the literature. As can be seen from the examples cited in this review, a variety of sensors have been employed based on electrochemiluminescence, photoelectrochemistry and the fluorescence properties of carbon nitride. Based on these analytical methods, new sensors could be fabricated, which could have wide applications in clinical diagnosis, the analysis of food samples and in monitoring environmentally hazardous moieties. In a nutshell, carbon nitrides have made their own trademark in the field of sensors apart from being a potential photocatalyst. But still, research in this field is in its earlier stages and more systematic investigations are needed. In spite of its chemical inertness and poor conductivity, it has become one of the most prolific material due to the exchangeable N–H and the Lewis basic N, the active sites of graphitic carbon nitride.
Many approaches like functionalization, doping and the fabrication of hierarchical structures make carbon nitride a reliable material. The functionalization of carbon nitrides with biomolecules or co-polymerization with some organic molecules makes them a more suitable candidate for bioanalysis and bioimaging processes. Steps need to be taken to optimise these carbon nitride-based analytical tools. The search for novel co-reactants or molecules to be functionalized on carbon nitrides to improve their sensing efficiency has now become a hot research topic.
The utility of graphitic carbon nitride-derived sensors for sensing analytes in living cells or even living organisms makes them a more reasonable material for the fabrication of novel biosensors. Although their potentials are highly expected due to their unique properties, graphitic carbon nitride materials have hardly been explored for sensor applications thus far. The instigative development of graphitic carbon nitride-based sensors ensures that these sensors would soon bring significant impact on environmental and safety monitoring, diagnosis, biological studies and drug screening.
