    , Accepted 10th July 2014First published on 10th July 2014AbstractTwo conjugated molecules with a [2,2]paracyclophane core were designed as non-fullerene electron acceptors for photovoltaic cells. Using P3HT as the donor, a high power conversion efficiency (2.69%) is achieved for the blending thin film of 1b with P3HT, which is relatively high for solution-processed OPVs based on small molecular non-fullerene acceptors and P3HT as the electron donor.
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) that possess advantages such as low cost, lightweight and flexibility have received tremendous attention in recent years.1,2 The past decade has witnessed great progress in this promising area; power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs is over 9.0% for single layer devices,2c owing to the development of high-performance photovoltaic materials based on various small conjugated molecules and polymers as well as appropriate modification of interfacial structures.
Among these organic photovoltaic materials, fullerene-derivatives such as well-known PC61BM and PC71BM have played a dominant role as electron acceptors. This is particularly true for OPVs with high PCE. The merits of fullerene molecules including high electron affinity, high electron mobility and isotropic charge-transporting may explain their wide range of applications in OPVs.3 However, fullerene molecules usually show weak absorption in the visible region, and their preparation and purification are expensive. Moreover, HOMO/LUMO energies of fullerenes are not easily tuned to match the electron donors to maximize the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and minimize the energy loss.4 For this reason, non-fullerene acceptors, which absorb strongly in the visible region and can be easily functionalized to tune the energy levels, have been intensively pursued recently. A number of non-fullerene electron acceptors are designed and investigated for OPVs.5–8 It is anticipated that these non-fullerene acceptors will provide more possibilities for the available electron donors (either conjugated small molecules or polymers) to form OPVs with high PCE by properly pairing electron donors and acceptors according to their energy levels and absorptions. To date, with P3HT as the donor, only a limited number of OPVs fabricated using non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors exhibit PCEs higher than 1.5%,7 and fewer with PCEs higher than 2.5%.8 Thus, there is plenty of room for further improvement.
We herein report two conjugated molecules 1a and 1b (Scheme 1) entailing a [2,2]paracyclophane framework as non-fullerene electron acceptors for OPVs. The molecular design rationale is based on the following considerations: (i) [2,2] paracyclophane is known for the transannular through space pi–pi interaction.9 Moreover, introduction of various functional groups into the [2,2]paracyclophane framework can be achieved in different ways. In fact, the [2,2]paracyclophane framework has been utilized for studying chromophore–chromophore interaction;10 (ii) diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a dyestuff shows strong absorptions in the visible region, and its frontier energy levels can be finely tuned by incorporation of either donating or accepting moieties such as the 3,4,5-trifluorophenyl group in 1b;11,12 (iii) the [2,2]paracyclophane framework endows 1a and 1b with a cylindrical and rigid structure, and such a molecular structure is expected to be beneficial for their dense packing and thus formation of molecular domains. The results reveal that both 1a and 1b can function as non-fullerene electron acceptors for OPVs after blending with P3HT, for which the PCE and VOC can reach 2.05% and 1.06 V, 2.69% and 0.90 V, respectively, after thermal annealing.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of compounds 1a, 1b and 4. 
The synthesis of compounds 1a and 1b is outlined in Scheme S1 (see ESI†). The chemical structures and purities of 1a and 1b were established and confirmed by spectroscopic data and elemental analysis. 1a and 1b show good solubilities in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene and o-DCB at room temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that 1a and 1b are thermally stable below 350 °C (see Fig. S1, ESI†).
In order to determine HOMO/LUMO energies of 1a and 1b, their cyclic voltammograms were recorded as depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). 1a exhibits three reversible oxidation waves and one reduction wave, while 1b shows three reversible oxidation waves and one irreversible reduction wave. Based on the respective onset oxidation and reduction potentials, LUMO/HOMO energies of 1a and 1b were estimated to be −3.47 eV/−5.24 eV and −3.53 eV/−5.29 eV, respectively (see Table S1, ESI†). Accordingly, bandgaps of 1a and 1b were calculated to be 1.77 eV and 1.76 eV, respectively. Obviously, the LUMO level of 1b is lower than that of 1a. This is owing to the electron withdrawing effect of the 3,4,5-trifluorophenyl group in 1b. As shown in Fig. S2c (ESI†), the respective HOMO and LUMO energy differences between both 1a/1b and P3HT are large enough to guarantee efficient exciton dissociation. Judging from the energy levels, both 1a and 1b can be utilized as electron acceptors in OPVs. Moreover, the energy differences between the HOMO level of P3HT and the LUMO levels of 1a or 1b are higher than 1.2 eV, thus high open-circuit voltages (VOC) are expected for OPVs with 1a or 1b as acceptors after combining with P3HT.
Fig. S3a (ESI†) depicts the absorption spectra of 1a and 1b in solutions and their thin films. The solutions of 1a and 1b absorb strongly at 598 nm with εmax = 196300 (extending to 650 nm) and at 631 nm with εmax = 154900 (extending to 700 nm), respectively. Compared to those in solutions, the absorption spectra of the thin films of 1a and 1b are red-shifted. For instance, the absorption band at 598 nm in solution is shifted to 631 nm for the thin film of 1a. Such absorption spectral shifts are likely owing to the intermolecular pi–pi interactions within thin films. The absorption spectra of 1b in both solution and thin film are red-shifted in comparison with those of 1a. This is understandable by considering the presence of the 3,4,5-trifluorophenyl group in 1b which may elongate the conjugation length. Based on the respective onset absorptions of thin films of 1a and 1b, the optical bandgaps of 1a and 1b were estimated to be 1.80 eV and 1.70 eV. These are in good agreement with those obtained based on their cyclic voltammetric data (see Table S1, ESI†).
OPVs with the conventional ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al structure were fabricated with the blending thin films of 1a or 1b with P3HT in different weight ratios. Fig. 1 depicts the respective J–V curves before and after thermal annealing. Table 1 lists the VOC, JSC, FF and PCE of these OPVs with the respective blending thin films before and after thermal annealing. The pairing of 1a with P3HT yielded OPVs with a VOC of 1.05–1.08 V, thanks to the large energy level difference between the HOMO of P3HT and the LUMO of 1a. Among the blending thin films, the one of P3HT with 1a at a weight ratio of 2:1 led to the best performance with VOC = 1.07 V, JSC = 2.71 mA cm−2, FF = 0.41 and PCE = 1.17%. After thermal annealing of the blending thin films at 150 °C for 10 min, JSC increased to 4.18 mA cm−2 and FF was also slightly enhanced (see Table 1), thus leading to a PCE of 2.05%. Similarly, the blending thin films of P3HT and 1b gave the highest photovoltaic performance at a weight ratio of 2:1 (see Table 1). The PCE was measured to be 1.60% for OPV with the thin films of P3HT and 1b before thermal annealing; to our delight it increased to 2.69% because of the enhancement of JSC (from 4.22 to 5.88 mA cm−2), FF (from 0.46 to 0.51) and VOC (from 0.82 V to 0.90 V) after thermal annealing of the photoactive thin film at 150 °C for 10 min.

For comparison, the reference molecule 4 (see Scheme 1) was synthesized (ESI†) and its HOMO/LUMO energies were estimated to be −5.22 eV and −3.52 eV, being close to those of 1b. OPVs with thin films of P3HT:PC61BM and P3HT:4 were also fabricated under the same conditions. After optimization,13 the P3HT:PC61BM blending thin film at a weight ratio of 1:1 yielded a PCE of 3.98%, whereas P3HT:4 at a weight ratio of 1:1 led to poor photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 0.90%. Thus, the OPV with 1b as a non-fullerene acceptor can reach 68% of the PCE of that with P3HT:PC61BM as the active layer. By comparing the photovoltaic performance of the blending thin films of P3HT with 1b or 1a with that of P3HT:4, it can be concluded that the cylindrical scaffold structure of 1b or 1a is more favorable for better photovoltaic performance after blending with P3HT.14 Notably, PCEs of 2.05% and 2.69% are relatively high for solution-processed OPVs based on small molecular non-fullerene acceptors upon pairing with P3HT with the conventional OPV configuration. The relatively high PCE for the blending thin films of P3HT:1b is owing to the higher carrier mobilities in comparison with those of P3HT:1a.15
Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the absorption spectra of the blending thin films of P3HT:1a and P3HT:1b at weight ratios of 2:1 and their IPCE (incident photon to converted current efficiency) spectra after thermal annealing. P3HT:1a thin film absorbs in the range of 300–700 nm with an absorption maximum at 561 nm, whereas P3HT:1b thin film shows a broad absorption at around 554 nm with shoulders at 601 nm and 666 nm. The absorption shoulders in IPCE spectra have similar profiles to the absorption peaks of the neat films of 1a and 1b, implying that 1a and 1b within the blending thin films make considerable contribution to IPCE and JSC. As a whole, the IPCE spectra correspond well to the respective absorption spectra of P3HT:1a and P3HT:1b thin films. The relatively high IPCE was observed in the range of 350–500 nm with respect to the corresponding absorptions, in particular for the P3HT:1b blending thin film. P3HT:1a and P3HT:1b thin films exhibit maximum IPCEs of 27% (at 522 nm) and 33% (at 516 nm), respectively.16
The blending thin films of P3HT:1a and P3HT:1b at weight ratios of 2:1 were also investigated using XRD and AFM techniques. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the out-of-plane and in-plane XRD patterns before and after thermal annealing. In the out-of-plane patterns, XRD signals at 5.50° and 10.85° were detected for both blending thin films, and the intensity at 5.50° was slightly enhanced after thermal annealing. Besides a weak diffraction peak at around 5.20° and a broad weak signal at around 22° (perhaps due to inter-chain pi–pi interactions) were observed in the in-plane XRD patterns. These XRD signals are probably owing to the formation of crystalline domains of P3HT within the blending thin films.17
The root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the P3HT:1a blend film decreases slightly from 3.13 nm to 3.01 nm before and after thermal annealing, whereas that of the P3HT:1b blend film decreases from 4.16 nm to 3.64 nm on the basis of height AFM images shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Thus, the P3HT:1b thin film becomes smoother after thermal annealing. The bright and dark domains in the phase AFM images are more clearly separated for the P3HT:1b thin film than those for the P3HT:1a thin film. Moreover, sizes of bright domains varied from 40–90 nm to 25–60 nm for P3HT:1a thin film, whereas those of P3HT:1b thin film are reduced from 35–60 nm to 20–40 nm after thermal annealing. These AFM images are consistent with the observation that thermal annealing led to the improvement of PCEs for both thin films according to the previous studies.7c
In summary, two conjugated molecules 1a and 1b (Scheme 1) entailing a [2,2]paracyclophane framework were designed and synthesized as non-fullerene electron acceptors for OPVs. Both 1a and 1b exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents and good thermal stability as well as high molar extinction coefficients. The HOMO/LUMO levels of 1a and 1b indicate that they can function as appropriate non-fullerene acceptors for OPVs. The blending thin film of 1b with P3HT at a weight ratio of 1:2 yielded the highest PCE (2.69%), whereas the thin film of 1a with P3HT at a weight ratio of 1:2 gave a PCE of 2.05%. The relatively high PCE for the blending thin film of P3HT:1b is owing to the higher carrier mobilities in comparison with those of P3HT:1a. Notably, PCEs of 2.05% and 2.69% are relatively high for solution-processed OPVs based on small molecular non-fullerene acceptors and P3HT as the electron donor. These results demonstrate that new conjugated molecules can be constructed from the [2,2]paracyclophane framework and such molecular scaffolds with appropriate electron accepting moieties are potential non-fullerene acceptors for OPVs.

This included variation donor/acceptor weight ratios and thermal annealing. But, addition of additives led to no PCE improvement.
Other state-of-the-art high performance donor polymers or oligomers were also considered for blending with 1a or 1b for OPVs with high PCEs. Unfortunately, the corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy differences are too small to drive exciton dissociation as depicted in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), the blending thin film of P3HT/1b exhibit higher hole and electron mobilities than the P3HT/1a thin film, in particular after thermal annealing, and the ratio of μh/μe becomes lower after thermal annealing.
According to the IPCE spectra, the integral current densities for OPVs based on P3HT:1a and P3HT:1b thin films were calculated to be 3.88 mA cm−2 and 5.41 mA cm−2, respectively. The difference between the integral current densities and the JSC data obtained from J–V curves is within 8%, indicating that the J–V measurements in this work are reliable.
Similar XRD patterns were reported for the P3HT:PC61BM thin film on PEDOT:PSS (see:   S. Shao, J. Liu, J. Zhang, B. Zhang, Z. Xie, Y. Geng and L. Wang, ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2012, 4, 5704 CAS  ). The appearance of out-of-plane diffractions at 5.50° and 10.85° as well as the weak in-plane one around 22° may indicate that P3HT predominately adopts edge-on arrangement on the surface. However, the rather weak in-plane diffraction at around 5.20° implies the face-on packing for the small fraction of P3HT.
