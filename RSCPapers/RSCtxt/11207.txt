    , Accepted 14th January 2020First published on 16th January 2020AbstractThe long-known class of compounds called naphthalene diimides (NDI), bearing alkyl substituents on the imide nitrogen atoms, have been widely used as active materials in thin film devices with interesting optical, sensing and electrical applications. Less is known about their rich crystal chemical behaviour, which comprises numerous polymorphic transitions, and the appearance of elusive liquid crystalline phases. It is this behaviour which determines the response of the devices based on them. Here we fully characterized, by combining differential scanning calorimetry, powder and thin film diffraction and optical microscopy techniques, two newly synthesized NDI materials bearing n-octyl and n-decyl side-chains, as well as lighter analogues, of known room temperature crystal structures. In search for a rationale of their physico-chemical properties, phase stability and thermally induced solid-state transition reversibility, the differential behaviour of these NDI materials is interpreted here based on the competitive role of intermolecular π–π interactions and the alkyl chain flexibility. The appearance of comparable local minima of the molecular conformational energy hypersurface for shorter alkyls, and, for longer ones, of rotator phases, is here invoked.
1. Introduction
After several years of fundamental studies, flexible organic and bio-electronics have entered the market as displays and devices, recently incorporated into large commodities available to the wider public.1 Synthetic and material chemists assisted this lively and rapidly evolving field by preparing molecular systems to be used as key building blocks for optoelectronics, computing, and sensing devices.2 In contrast to the conventional electronics based on inorganics, organic semiconductors take advantage of electronically active carbon-based self-assemblies or macro-molecules, providing solution-processable, flexible, adjustable and cost efficient devices. Elegant examples of organic electronic applications include OLED cell phone displays, flexible light panels, rollable solar cells, and battery-free artificial retina.3 Among other recent applications, the possibility of building low-temperature thermoelectric generators4 for energy recovery from mild heat sources has been tackled. In this case the success relies on optimizing concurrently different properties (such as the electrical and thermal conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient and the chemical and thermal stability) in order to obtain high performing devices by easily processable methods.
While excellent device performances have been obtained for p-type organic semiconductors, the n-type air instability, typical for these systems, although not ubiquitous, markedly affects the electron transport due to the detrimental effect of oxygen molecules.5 For this reason a big effort is still devoted to developing appealing n-type organic semiconductors.6 Among the most studied n-type systems, N-alkyl substituted PDI materials (PDI = N,N′-dialkyl-perylene diimides) have been demonstrated to meet several requirements such as air stability, processability and high charge carrier mobility at once.7 They have shown excellent chemical, thermal, and optical stabilities as well as high luminescence efficiencies and remarkable optoelectronic properties.8 They have been successfully employed in the production of field effect transistors, photovoltaic devices and dye lasers.9 NDI (NDI = N,N′-naphthalene diimide) analogues are structurally simpler and cheaper. Due to their enhanced solubility they are more easily processable; accordingly, they have been widely studied in the form of both bulk and films.10 Their applications range from sensors, molecular switching, catalysis and use in medicinal and electronic devices.11 Notwithstanding, investigations on the preparation of NDI-based derivatives and polymers with appreciable power conversion efficiencies in photovoltaic applications fall in a still rapidly growing field.
Semiconducting organic films based on NDI and PDI polyaromatic rings, properly stacked within films and possibly doped with exogenous species (ions, nanoparticles, etc.), are promising materials. They do, however, suffer from intrinsic structural versatility in that several polymorphs can be formed (in the bulk) with little control of the actual structure type being obtained upon film deposition and processing. In addition, novel polymorphs can also be induced by the substrate surface depending on the deposition technique.12 In the specific case of NDI congeners the occurrence of polymorphism has been reported,13 but the structural features behind the phenomenon are still unknown.
While having the same chemical composition, each polymorph is unique with its own physical and chemical properties. Owing to these differences understanding and controlling polymorph formation of organic compounds are of interest in pharmaceutical industries,14 organic electronics and in functional materials in general.15 In particular, in small molecule organic semiconductors, the crystal structure is crucial for device performance.16
In this work we focus our attention on a prototype system, i.e. symmetrically substituted linear dialkyl NDI. The studied series consists of four molecular n-alkylated NDI derivatives with n-butyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl and n-decyl side-chains, respectively (see Chart 1). As detailed later, we employed structural powder diffraction methods, thermal analyses, variable temperature diffraction methods, optical imaging and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction of spin-coated films to unravel the rich polymorphic landscape.

To better convey the labelling used throughout this paper, NDIx refers to NDI molecules bearing n-alkyl CxH2x+1 chains; xα,…,xδ indicate different polymorphic phases of the NDIx species (starting from the low-temperature ones) and LC labels a liquid crystalline mesophase formed at temperature slightly lower than the melting point (m.p.).
2. Experimental section
(a) Materials
All chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification.
(b) Synthesis of the NDI compounds
The different N,N′-dialkyl-naphthalene diimide compounds were prepared according to modified literature procedures.17


N,N′-Dibutyl-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic 1,8:4,5-diimide (NDI4). 
A mixture of 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (2.00 g, 7.5 mmol) and n-butylamine (3.00 mL, 29.8 mmol) was added to acetic acid (30 mL). The resulting suspension was stirred at 100 °C overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the solids were collected by filtration and washed with cold methanol. The crude product was recrystallised from a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol to yield the title compound as pale yellow crystals (2.52 g, 6.7 mmol, 89%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C) δ 8.72 (s, 4H), 4.19 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 4H), 1.77–1.67 (m, 4H), 1.51–1.39 (m, 4H), 0.98 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C) δ 162.9, 131.0, 126.8, 126.8, 40.9, 30.3, 20.5, 13.9.



N,N′-Dihexyl-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic 1,8:4,5-diimide (NDI6). 
1,4,5,8-Naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (1.00 g, 3.7 mmol) and n-hexylamine (2.00 mL, 15.1 mmol) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (30 mL) and heated to 120 °C overnight. The dark red reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, water (50 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (2 × 100 mL), dried over magnesium sulphate, and filtered and the solvent evaporated. The red crude solid was then recrystallised from a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol. The final product was recovered as pink needles (1.20 g, 2.8 mmol, 74%). 1H NMR (700 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C) δ 8.74 (s, 4H), 4.19 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 4H), 1.74 (quin, 4H), 1.44 (quin, 4H), 1.38–1.31 (m, 8H), 0.90 (t, 6H); 13C NMR (175 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C) δ 162.9, 131.0, 126.8, 41.1, 31.6, 28.2, 26.9, 22.7, 14.2.



N,N′-Dioctyl-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic 1,8:4,5-diimide (NDI8). 
1,4,5,8-Naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (1.00 g, 3.7 mmol) and n-octylamine (2.50 mL, 15.3 mmol) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (30 mL) and heated to 120 °C overnight. The dark red reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, water (50 mL) was added and the mixture extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (2 × 100 mL), dried over magnesium sulphate, and filtered and the solvent was evaporated. The red crude solid was then recrystallised from a dichloromethane and methanol mixture, filtered and washed with cold methanol to yield the product as pink needles (1.44 g, 2.9 mmol, 79%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C) δ 8.74 (s, 4H), 4.18 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 4H), 1.78–1.69 (m, 4H), 1.45–1.39 (m, 4H), 1.38–1.33 (m, 4H), 1.32–1.23 (m, 12H), 0.87 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (175 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C) δ 163.0, 131.0, 126.8, 41.1, 31.9, 29.4, 29.3, 28.2, 27.2, 22.8, 14.2.



N,N′-Didecyl-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic 1,8:4,5-diimide (NDI10). 
1,4,5,8-Naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (2.00 g, 7.5 mmol) and n-decylamine (6.00 mL, 29.8 mmol) were added to acetic acid (30 mL). The resulting suspension was stirred at 100 °C overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the solids were collected by filtration and washed with cold methanol. The crude product was recrystallised from a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol to yield the title compound as pale pink crystals (3.76 g, 6.9 mmol, 92%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C) δ 8.71 (s, 4H), 4.17 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 4H), 1.77–1.68 (m, 4H), 1.46–1.18 (m, 28H), 0.86 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 6H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, 25 °C) δ 162.9, 131.0, 126.8, 126.8, 41.1, 32.0, 29.7, 29.7, 29.5, 29.4, 28.2, 27.2, 22.8, 14.2.

(c) X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) characterization
Gently ground powders of compounds NDI4, NDI6, NDI8 and NDI10, synthesized as described above, were deposited in the hollow of a zero-background silicon sample holder, 0.2 mm deep (supplied by Assing spa, Monterotondo, Italy). Diffraction experiments were performed on a vertical-scan Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer in the θ:θ mode, equipped with a linear position-sensitive Lynxeye detector, primary beam Soller slits, and Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å).
(d) Thin film preparation
All films were prepared under the following conditions: spin-coated on a 300 nm thick SiO2/Si substrate from NDIx chlorobenzene solution (5 mg mL−1) at 800 rpm for 3 seconds, followed by 2000 rpm for 20 seconds. Afterwards, they were dried in air at 70 °C for 15 minutes.
(e) X-ray diffraction characterization of thin films
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed in a specular geometry using a SmartLab-Rigaku diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode (Cu-Kα1, λ = 1.5406 Å), a parabolic mirror to collimate the incident beam and a series of variable slits (placed before and after the sample position) to reach an acceptance of 0.03°. Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were performed at the XRD1 beamline of the ELETTRA synchrotron facility (Trieste, Italy) by using a wavelength of 1.00 Å and an incident angle of 0.1°. A 2D Pilatus was placed normal to the incident beam direction at 350 mm from the sample. Reciprocal space maps and unit cell indexing were calculated from the measured data using the GIDVis software.18 Unit cell parameters were extracted by using a home-made program able to find the set of {hkl} indices which best fit Bragg peak positions.
(f) Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
Atomic force microscopy was performed in a semi-contact mode using an NT-MDT Ntegra Prima instrument mounted on a TS-150 isolation table (Table Stable Ltd). Pyramidal etched silicon AFM probes (Agar Scientific) resonating at ∼140 kHz were used for the measurements. 20 × 20 μm topographic images (512 × 512 points) were recorded at a line acquisition rate of 0.5 Hz.
(g) Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
Differential scanning calorimetry was performed on a PerkinElmer DSC 4000 or DSC 8000 instrument using aluminium pans. The samples were weighed in powder form in the DSC pans and crimped with a lid. Each sample was measured in two subsequent heating/cooling cycles, the second cooling trace being only marginally different from the first one. Remarkable differences were instead observed during the two heating processes. A minimum of two scans per sample was performed.
(h) Variable temperature XRPD
Thermodiffractometric experiments were performed starting from the pristine xα (x = 4, 6, 8, 10) phases. Powdered batches were deposited in the hollow of an aluminium sample holder, assembled by Officina Elettrotecnica di Tenno, Ponte Arche, Italy; diffractograms were acquired in air, in the most significant low-angle 2θ ranges. Consistent with the measured DSC trace, NDI6 showed the richest polymorphic behaviour; the different experimental sequences and the pertinent results are provided in the Results and discussion section. NDI4 and NDI10 also showed polymorphic transitions, which are later discussed. As in powder diffraction experiments, as well as in polarized optical imaging, the samples are in direct contact with air and some thermal drifts/gradients are present, the most correct phase transition temperatures are taken from the more accurate DSC measurements, performed as illustrated above.
(i) Variable temperature optical microscopy
Optical micrographs were recorded with a Nikon i-80 microscope equipped with an epi-illuminator and cross polarizing lenses (POM). The images were recorded using LU Plan ELWD 20×/0.40 and 50×/0.55 objectives, a commercial CCD (DIGITAL SIGHT DS-2MV) and 500 ms acquisition time. The entire POM setup is described in ref. 19. The thermal treatments were performed under the optical microscope using a Linkam TMHS600 heating stage and a TP94 controller (ΔT = ±0.1 °C).20
(j) Variable temperature XRD and GIXRD on thin films
XRD scans were collected in air in real time on a hot plate placed in contact with the sample holder in a goniometer. The temperature was varied from 20 to 100 °C. At each temperature, the sample was aligned and five XRD scans were collected in 30 s in order to follow any possible slow phase transition. When no differences were observed, XRD scans were summed up to increase the signal to noise ratio. GIXRD images were collected in situ and in real time during thermal annealing by means of a heated nitrogen gas blower installed next to the sample. GIXRD images were recorded for 20 s once temperature reached stability and the sample was aligned. Different thermal treatments were carried out, from RT up to 80 °C, 100 °C and 120 °C and reversibility was checked by cooling to RT and repeating the thermal treatment.
(k) Other methods
Solution NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance III 400 and Neo 700 spectrometer, operating at 400 and 700 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm with the residual solvent peak of CHCl3 (δ = 7.27 ppm, s) as the internal standard. UV-Vis spectra were recorded in chloroform solutions on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer.
3. Results and discussion
(a) Crystal structures
X-ray diffraction traces of the 4α and 6α phases matched those found in the CSD database.21,22 At variance, no structural model was found for 8α and 10α, thus requiring a complete ab initio structural solution from powder diffraction data only. Details are provided in the ESI.†
For helping the reader, Fig. 1, which shows the molecular structures and crystal packing of four species (the α crystal phases of NDIx with x = 4, 6, 8, 10, stable at room temperature, RT), is anticipated here and will be discussed in this and in the following sections.
 Fig. 1  Left: Sketches of the molecular geometry of 4α,13b 6α,31 8α and 10α (top to bottom). Color codes: C (grey), N (blue), O (red), and H (white). Drawn by SCHAKAL.32 Due to some alkyl chain disorder in 6α, some of the alkyl H atoms have not been inserted. The inset in the panel of 8α shows the highly anisotropic shape drawn from the thermal expansion coefficient for NDI8, heated from RT to 175 °C. Right: Sketches of the corresponding molecular packing. 

Crystal structure of 8α. 
The crystals of 8α are triclinic, P, with the molecule lying on an inversion center. The n-octyl chain conformation is nearly in all-trans geometry (maximum deviation ca. 12°) with the notable exception of a slight twist at the two terminal torsions, found to approach 140° (Fig. 1, left). As powder diffraction on molecular materials of moderate complexity is known to afford approximate geometrical parameters the highest care was taken in assessing the validity of this model, for example by thoroughly exploring the parameter hyperspace and by restraining torsional angles to more widely accepted values.
As a further confirmation of the occurrence of such an anomaly our variable temperature XRPD measurements, and lattice parameter refinement derived therefrom, provided the clue for such a behavior. Indeed, by heating the sample a very large increase of the c axis from the 22.7 Å at RT to 23.7 Å at 175 °C was observed. This accounted for a 4.2% relative change for a giant linear thermal expansion coefficient of 280 M K−1 as expected for the complete stretching, and perhaps dynamic rotation, of the entire n-octyl residue. A CSD search of n-octyl analogues in purely organic molecules indicated that torsion angles in the outermost region are possible, though rare.23,24 Additionally, we found that this transformation is continuous and fully reversible, restoring identical XRPD traces upon cooling.

RBragg = 0.054.


Crystal structure of 10α. 
In the RT α-form, the crystals of NDI10 are triclinic, P, with the molecule lying on an inversion center. The n-decyl chain conformation is in all-trans geometry, with most torsion angles falling within 3° from the ideal 180° value and a single slightly bent, dihedral angle of ca. 167.8° (Fig. 1). This observation is in line with the structures reported for NDI12 and NDI14 (on single crystal data), where crystal packing efficiency forces long aliphatic chains to pack side-by-side in the fully stretched conformation. This is similar to what was observed for monoclinic and orthorhombic high-density polyethylene. At variance, shorter chains (up to n-hexyl), where crystal packing is only marginally dictated by aliphatic CH2⋯CH2 interactions, show markedly bent residues and none in the all-trans conformation.

Significantly, the molar volume, V/Z298, increases with a strong linearity with the length of the alkyl chain (R2 = 0.998, as in Fig. 2a) expanding by ca. 25.0 Å3 when a methylene group is added. Moreover, for all compounds, the π–π distance reached the same value of ca. 3.4 Å.
 Fig. 2  (a) The regular change of the temperature-corrected V/Z298 values for the entire NDIx series (x = 1–14). (b) Melting points of the NDIx materials vs. n-alkyl C atoms. Data were fit by a phenomenological exponential law:m.p. (NDIn) = 163.42 + 321.35e−0.383n.For n → ∞, m.p. should reach an asymptotic value close to 163 °C, while ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene melts at 147 °C.33 The slight discrepancy can be easily interpreted by the use of an arbitrary functional dependence (an exponential law), not fully valid outside the range of experimentally available m.p. values. 
Beyond helping in the accurate prediction of the density of the missing members (even by extrapolation), this comparison shows that the packing efficiency of these materials is similar. The intermolecular attraction of the π–π (for the NDI cores) or van der Waals (in their periphery) type is quite comparable, even if in some cases the all-trans configuration of the n-alkyls is not present in the solid phases. The interplanar (π–π) distance of 3.37 ± 0.03 Å indicates that the NDI cores approach as graphitic carbon does (3.35 Å), despite the absence of fully eclipsed C/N atoms and the intrinsic smaller size of N atoms. Despite similarities, two slightly different groups of stacking modes can be envisaged by plotting their position in the χ, ψ space (defined in Fig. 5). Those clustering near β = 53° (upper left corner) belong to the n > 7 class, where fully stretched alkyls are present, while the n ≤ 6 phases (bottom right) contain, at RT, significantly folded alkyl residues.
A similiar analysis was reported for bithiazoles and pentacenes, where an alternative description of “pitch and roll” angles (P, R) was used to tentatively correlate the charge transport properties with the geometrical parameters of the π–π stacking.25 Using the same approach, we obtain P = 40.1° and R = 26.7° for the n > 7 class, and P = 48.6° and R = 19.3° for the n ≤ 6 one. As large roll angle inclinations (above 45°) essentially destroy superposition between the π-orbitals of adjacent molecules, the limited R values determined here should provide effective overlap.
Unexpectedly, the colours of the α phases of the four examined compounds are quite different being yellow (4α), pink (6α), orange (8α) and white (10α), see the ESI.† These visual observations do not correlate with the geometrical parameters reported in Table 1, where the overlap of all the NDI cores is very close, but they are likely affected by the grain size.26 Indeed, the crystallite grain size for ND10 is much smaller than those of the other compounds, providing whitening of the pristine hue expected for a massive (single) crystal.

Fig. 2b shows the smooth and regular trend of the melting points of the NDIx (x = 1–14) series taken from the literature or measured by us. This behaviour indicates that upon increasing the molecular weight and complexity the melting points unexpectedly become lower for longer alkyl chains, despite the NDI core interaction being fairly similar. A comparable decrease of clearing points of substituted metal phthalocyanines, with large n-alkyls in the molecular periphery, was recently reported.27 While these trends are in clear disagreement with the melting point sequence of n-paraffins, increasing the molecular complexity,28 we tentatively put forward the following interpretation:
(a) The extremely linear increase of the molar volumes (Fig. 2a), which are expanded by ca. 49.0 Å3 by the presence of two additional methylene groups, implies a near constancy of the van der Waals interactions between the n-alkyls. This is regardless of their conformation (values of 47.8 and 49.5 Å3 are nicely predicted by Hoffmann29 and Mighell30 models, respectively). The fusion enthalpy increment upon increasing n, dΔHfus/dn, can thus likely be considered to be fairly constant (i.e. dΔHfus/dn > 0).
(b) Melting point temperatures (Tfuss), if equilibrium conditions are assumed, can be written as Tfus = ΔHfus/ΔSfus.
(c) As both ΔHfus and ΔSfus are positive values, combining the above considerations with the experimental dTfus/dn < 0 trend (as per Fig. 2b) implies that d(1/ΔSfus)/dn < 0 or, equivalently, that dΔSfus/dn > 0.
This analysis suggests that the major factor influencing the steady decrease of the melting point values, upon increasing the chain length, must be attributed to progressively increasing fusion entropy changes. Whether this is due to a larger conformational freedom of the larger alkyl derivatives in liquids or to their more ordered chain arrangement in solids cannot be derived from the presently available data.
(c) Structure of the films
The 2D-GIXRD images of all the spin coated films of the NDIx series (x = 4, 6, 8, 0, Fig. 3a–c, 4a and Fig. S8a–d, ESI†) exhibit several intense Bragg spots having small arc shape and a perfect symmetry with respect to the central vertical line. These features indicate the appearance of films possessing a high degree of crystalline order and texturing, with grains oriented along one specific direction with respect to the normal to the substrate surface.

Z is normal to the xy plane, and the SV must be taken in 3D space. cosχ, cosψ and cosφ are the direction cosines of the stacking vector, while the interplanar distance (π–π) is, simply, the z-coordinate of the SV. (b) Clustering (in the blue and red circles) of the different χ/ψ values for two markedly different stacking modes. The upper dots, for which ψ ≈ 53°, belong to the long chain derivatives (x = 8, 10, 12, 14). In the red circle are short chain derivatives (x = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6). Note that, since cos2χ + cos2ψ + cos2φ = 1, any other section of the χ, ψ, φ 3D space would have provided the same information. (c and d) Sketches of the two slightly different π–π overlaps, drawn for (c): χ = 69° and ψ =53° (blue circles in (b) and (d)): for χ = 77° and ψ = 43° (red circle in b). 
For NDI4, NDI8, and NDI10 films, all the reflections could be indexed by using the crystallographic structure of the RT-stable α-phase of the bulk and assuming the (001) texturing, as confirmed by the XRD specular scans (Fig. 4b and Fig. S7e–h, ESI†), where only 00l reflections are observed. The experimental reciprocal space images are in good agreement, for both the position and intensity of the diffracted spots, with the 2D-GIXRD simulations34 for polycrystalline films composed of molecules highly oriented with the ab plane parallel to the substrate surface (Fig. 3d–f). These results allowed us to establish the orientation of the molecular packing in the film system, schematically reported in Fig. 3g–i.
The AFM topographic images of NDI8 show continuous films with a terrace structure and steps corresponding to molecular monolayers of the NDI8 molecule (Fig. S7, ESI†). Further analysis reveals an average height of these terraces of 2.20 nm ± 0.05 nm, confirming that the molecules pack edge-on to the substrate.
More interestingly, the spin coated film of the NDI6 molecules differs from the others because of the coexistence of two polymorphs: a minor portion of the known phase,31 here labelled 6α, and a larger portion of a still unknown crystalline form, hereafter referred to as the 6β phase. The experimental 2D-GIXRD image is shown in Fig. 4a. The specular diffraction patterns (Fig. 4b) indicate that both phases are strongly textured with their (00l) planes lying parallel to the surface (as illustrated for the α phase in Fig. 4c).
The broadening of the GIXRD Bragg spots induced by the beam footprint did not allow solving the 6β phase crystal structure. A possible set of unit cell parameters of the 6β phase, however, was extracted from Bragg positions in the 2D-GIXRD image (qxy and qz values of Fig. 4a) and in the specular scan35 (Fig. 4b). The resulting cell parameters are: a = 39.50(5) Å, b = 4.71(2) Å, c = 22.60(5) Å, α = 90.0(1)°, β = 52.8(1)°, and γ = 90.0(1)°. The corresponding cell parameters in conventional setting36 are a = 22.60 Å, b = 4.71 Å, c = 31.489 Å, α = 90.0°, β = 92.33°, and γ = 90.0°. Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows that the calculated positions of Bragg peaks from this monoclinic setting are in good agreement with the experimental data.
Surprisingly, the β phase is characterized by one very long periodicity (ca. 3 nm). These observations will be further substantiated by the full variable-temperature XRPD analysis reported in a following section.
(d) Thermal properties of the NDIx materials (x = 4, 6, 8 and 10)
The raw materials obtained after precipitation from their CH2Cl2/CH3OH solutions were characterized by DSC, thermodiffractometry and variable temperature polarized optical microscopy (POM). DSC curves recorded during the 1st heating and cooling cycles and a subsequent 2nd heating cycle (Fig. 6) show for all the compounds, but NDI8, a large number of thermal events. These were also followed, from a structural point of view, by separated XRPD and POM imaging. The data extracted from DSC traces are reported in Table 2.

Thermal characterization of NDI4. 
The thermal behavior of the NDI4 species (of the known crystal structure21) is somewhat complex. Indeed, upon heating (red curve in Fig. 6) two endothermic events are observed at 123 °C and 225 °C, both associated (by XRPD) with polymorphic transitions, while melting occurs at 233 °C. The presence of a tiny peak between the two polymorphic transitions suggests an additional phase transformation. Upon cooling, the melt crystallizes at 227 °C (with a small hysteresis) and a solid–solid phase transition is observed at ca. 164 °C. The second heating cycle replicates the first one except for a slight shift at a lower temperature of the peak corresponding to the first transition.
Insights into the nature of these thermally induced transformations can be obtained by studying the evolution of the XRD powder patterns during the first heating and subsequent cooling process, reported in Fig. 7. The RT 4α phase shows, upon heating, a polymorphic transition at ca. 123 °C. However the sudden appearance of many sharp Bragg peaks, just above this transformation temperature, suggests the coexistence of different polymorphs (here denoted 4β and 4γ). By increasing the temperature, a progressive unbalance toward the 4γ-phase is observed.
 Fig. 7  2D thermodiffractometric plots of NDI4 recorded during heating, and upon cooling from the melt. 2θ-scale: 3–35°. 
The presence of low-angle peaks (down to 4.3° 2θ) shows that the 4β polymorph contains an asymmetric unit manifestly larger than that observed in the 4α phase, where Z′ = 0.5. The unit cell of the 4γ-phase was determined using synchrotron X-ray data collected at 200 °C, and shown to be triclinic with a = 9.05, b = 11.26, c = 16.14 Å, α = 103.2, β = 93.4, γ = 72.7°, V = 1527 Å3, Z = 3, Z′ = 1.5, V/Z =309 Å3, ρcalc = 1.234 g cm−3 (ρcalc = 1.43 g cm−3, for 4α), and d(001) = 15.7 Å (GOF = 36.9). However, owing to the structural complexity, the structure of 4γ was not further characterized. The transition detected by DSC just above 225 °C, occurring a few degrees before melting, was not caught by thermodiffractometry.
Cooling from the melt enabled the formation and stabilization of a liquid crystal (LC) phase, characterized by a single set of harmonics (with d = 15.4 Å at 240 °C) and eventually turning (in the XRD chamber, near 120 °C) into a γ-rich (4β,4γ) mixture. Specifically, XRD indicates that the RT 4α phase could be restored only after a few days with some minor contamination of the high-temperature phase(s).
The transformation of the 4α-phase into more than one polymorph upon heating is confirmed by the evolution of POM images. Together with the first phase transition (4α→ 4β,4γ phases), identified by changes in the shape and movements of a few crystallites (Fig. 8a and b), the complete 4β → 4γ transition (Fig. 8c) is detected at ca. 200 °C by contrast image changes. Slightly before melting (i.e. at 240 °C, offset from the DSC value by the unavoidable presence of a thermal gradient), a transient LC phase is observed, easily associated with the pre-melting peak observed by DSC.
 Fig. 8  POM images of NDI4 recorded during a first heating cycle at (a) 25, (b) 135, (c) 200 and (d) 240 °C. 
Interestingly, upon cooling, the melt forms a LC phase with a slight hysteresis (Fig. 9a). The LC to the (4β + 4γ) mixture is identified by faint contrast changes within a few domains appearing at 160 °C (Fig. 9b); such changes progressively intensify by further cooling down to 135 °C (Fig. 9c). Our observations are in agreement with the occurrence of two exothermic events observed upon cooling near 226 °C and 160 °C, observed in our DSC traces and already reported in the literature, but not interpreted.21

Only well below 70 °C cracks in the crystals form (Fig. 9d and e), attributed through diffraction to the incipient and partial formation of the original 4α-phase (longer times are found to be necessary in the XRD diffractometer setup).


Thermal characterization of NDI6. 
The very complex thermal behavior of NDI6 also requires a dedicated analysis. The DSC thermograms (Fig. 6b) show that the two endothermic events occurring during the first heating cycle (red trace) are not reversibly reproduced upon cooling (blue trace), where an additional transition is observed at ca. 50 °C. Moreover, the second heating cycle differs remarkably from the original one. The understanding of such a complex thermal behaviour was indeed possible thanks to a combined analysis of powder thermodiffractometry, the results of which are summarized hereafter and depicted in Fig. 10 and in Fig. 11 by POM.

 Fig. 11  POM of the NDI6 powder recorded during the first heating process: (a) 25, (b) 180 (α to δ phase), (c) 211 (δ to LC) and (d) 212 °C (melting). 
At RT the starting powders contain only the pure 6α phase which completely transforms into other species near 180 °C. XRPD showed that two distinct polymorphs, 6γ and 6δ, are formed, the latter melting at ca. 208 °C. Separation of two successive events (6α → 6γ and 6γ → 6δ) in the DSC measurements was only possible in the second heating cycle, the transformations being observed at ca. 173 °C and 180 °C, respectively. Upon cooling from the melt, crystallization of the 6δ phase at ca. 200 °C is observed, further transforming at ca. 147 °C, to 6γ. Only below 50 °C does 6γ start to slowly restore 6α together with a larger amount of a new phase, stable at RT, labeled 6β. A mixture of 6α and 6β is then typically formed after the first heating–cooling cycle. The presence of an additional crystal phase, 6β, in the RT material thus explains the new endothermic peak observed at 68 °C in the DSC trace of the second heating (Fig. 6b, black curve).
The collected XRD data for the 6β, 6γ and 6γ phases, though not possessing enough quality for a full structural determination, provided the lattice parameters reported in Table 3. They showed a remarkable desymmetrization process on increasing the temperature in the 6α,γ,δ sequence (see Z′ values) and very distinct molecular symmetries for the two RT stable 6α,β phases (of comparable crystal density). This anomaly is later commented in a dedicated section. A tentative model for the crystal structure of the high-temperature 6γ phase is presented in the ESI.†

Interestingly only POM images could catch the formation of a LC phase at high temperature. Indeed during the first heating process the first phase transition (α → γ,δ), completed at 180 °C, is identified by the bending and change of contrast of many crystals (Fig. 11a and b). At 211 °C, we observed a dramatic change in the crystal shape, with the material behaving as a liquid while preserving optical brightness (Fig. 11c). Melting to an isotropic liquid was observed just one degree above, at 212 °C (Fig. 11d). POM images recorded during the first cooling process (Fig. S10, ESI†) confirm the polymorph transitions already discussed.
Noteworthy, the 6β phase observed in the powder at RT after the first thermal treatment corresponds to the majority phase observed in the spin-coated thin films (described above in Section c and shown in Fig. 4), as demonstrated by the simulated 2D-GIXRD (Fig. S9, ESI†). Interestingly, in the drop cast films the α phase prevails (Fig. S10, ESI†), suggesting that 6β and 6α are the kinetically and thermodynamically favoured phases, respectively.
We verified the presence/stability of the different NDI6 polymorphs in thin films by recording 2D-GIXRD images, in situ, during heating (from RT up to 120 °C) and subsequent cooling (down to RT). A movie is available in the ESI† (Movie 1) to watch the evolution of the Bragg spots during the thermal annealing. This analysis was carried out only at relatively low temperatures, because, beyond 120 °C, film desorbing prevented further investigation (watch Movie 2 in the ESI†).
From RT up to 80 °C, all 2D-GIXRD images are identical (one for all is shown in Fig. 12a). By increasing the temperature up to 120 °C, the 6α phase remains stable whereas 6β vanishes and transforms into another polymorph, identified as 6γ. Indeed, the experimental 2D-GIXRD image measured at 120 °C (Fig. 12b) can be well reproduced by assuming a (001) textured film with the 6γ structure (Fig. 12c). The 6β → 6γ transition is followed even more clearly observing the change in the out-of plane profiles obtained integrating 2D-GIXD along the qz direction (Fig. 12f). The 2D-GIXRD image collected at RT after the first thermal cycle (Fig. 12d) exhibits the presence of residual 6γ, together with the 6β and 6α phases, indicating that the reverse 6γ → 6β transformation occurs only partially, the transition requiring several days to complete. Specular XRD, OM and AFM measurements performed in situ, during the thermal process, confirmed these results (Fig. S7, S12, S13, S14 and S15, ESI†).

Thermal characterization of NDI8. 
The simplest thermal behaviour was exhibited by NDI8, which only manifested melting of the unique RT 8α-phase near 186 °C and recrystallization, upon cooling, at 183 °C with a very minimal hysteresis (Fig. 6c).


Thermal characterization of NDI10. 
The largest member of our series, NDI10, shows a completely reversible thermal behavior upon heating and cooling, perfectly reproducible by further thermal cycling. Two main endothermic transitions are observed at 163 and 183 °C along with two corresponding exothermic transitions on the cooling cycle.
The origin of these two transitions can be revealed by the analysis of the 2D thermodiffractometric plots (Fig. 13). As the platy morphology of the powders enabled a meaningful analysis of the d-spacing of the 00l peaks only, Fig. 13a shows the temperature evolution of the 00l peak positions. Wavy changes due to a progressive unit cell expansion followed by the occurrence of a polymorphic phase transition are observed. Reversibility and reproducibility in a second run were confirmed by subsequent thermal cycling (Fig. 13b). Additionally, the DSC curves (Fig. 6d) show a reversible event characterized by a tiny peak falling very close to the melting one, escaping the XRPD detection but successfully identified by the contrast change of optical microscopy images, and attributed to the formation of a new (possibly liquid-crystalline) 10γ phase.
 Fig. 13  (a) 00l peak positions (l = 1–4) of heavily oriented powders of the 10α phase, recorded upon heating from 20 to 200 °C in 20 °C steps. The discontinuity observed above 160 °C refers to the 10α → 10β polymorphic transition. (b) The sigmoidal variation of the d001-spacing (in Å), and the exact superimposition of the values measured in subsequent heating runs. Empty circles: first heating; filled circles: second heating. 
Conventional POM imaging of the very small crystallites could not directly reveal, upon heating, the occurrence and nature of any phase transformation. Significant information can be extracted, however, by monitoring the POM images of the continuous film obtained by recrystallization of the melt (Fig. 14). Just a few degrees below the onset of recrystallization, at ca. 173 °C, a contrast change is observed in very small regions of the film (corresponding to the tiny peak in the DSC curve attributed to the elusive 10γ → 10β transition). This is followed by the more evident contrast change appearing some 10 °C lower (and assigned to the 10β → 10α transition).

Bottom row: Contrast change observed upon cooling from 173 °C to 166 °C (disappearance of thin black lines) corresponding to the 10γ → 10β transition, which is reversible upon heating (appearance of thin black lines in the rightmost panel). 

(e) Insurgence of polymorphism: final thoughts
Aiming at understanding why the different NDIx (x = 4, 6, 8 and 10) materials possess such a rich polymorphic versatility, and rather distinct for the different cases, we analysed some of the data presented in previous sections in depth. Together with the optimized crystal structure models (with the caveat that alkyl disorder cannot be easily detected by conventional XRPD structural analysis), our evidence can be summarized as follows.
(a) Among the studied materials, only NDI6, in its RT stable 4α form, shows alkyl chains with a remarkable twist from the all-trans conformation (the torsion angle on the C9–C10 hinge falling near 67°, typical of a gauche conformation).
(b) NDI4 and NDI6 belong to a class of stacking vector (SV) orientations different than NDI8 and ND10 (Table 1 and Fig. 5b), in which intermolecular π–π interactions likely dominate the overall crystal packing energy in the presence of short(er) n-alkyls.
(c) Longer alkyl branches, in all-trans disposition, likely force through their “polyethylene like” arrangement, the occurrence of SVs, shown in Fig. 5b (upper left class), less widely spread than for shorter branches.
(d) NDI8 is thermally silent, while longer chains (as in NDI10) induce the formation of additional thermally induced polymorphic transformations, which differ from lighter NDIx analogues (x = 4 and 6) and are found to be fully reversible.
(e) In spin coated films the molecular assembly may be affected by the interaction with the substrate, with crystal nucleation and growth driven by competing kinetic effects. Among the studied materials, only in the case of NDI6, the thin film structure differs from the RT bulk phase.
Understanding these bare facts is not easy, nevertheless we tentatively put forward the following interpretation.
Firstly, when shorter alkyl chains are present, the overall crystal packing is mostly governed by molecular core interactions (i.e., π–π). This ensures wider chain flexibility, where gauche or other twisted conformations are not detrimental to the formation of alternative polymorphic forms, occasionally coexisting under the same temperature conditions (as found for both NDI4 and NDI6 compounds).
Secondly, the appearance of the gauche conformation in both n-hexyl residues (here, g,g) of 6α may explain why a rather complex 6β-phase (likely with Z′ = 1.5) can coexist at RT with 6α. A probable interpretation could be that the g–g conformation, as well as the g,a and a,a conformations (a stands for anti), reasonably exist, as local minima of the global molecular energy hypersurface. This is in line with the unit cell size and symmetry of the 6β-phase, as well as with the likely presence of a single a,a conformer in the high temperature 6γ-phase. Indeed, the absence of full reversibility of the pertinent phase transitions may be justified by the rather different crystal complexity, in the Z′ = 0.5, 1.5 and 0.5 sequence of the 6α,β,γ crystal phases detected by XRPD.
Additionally, formation of the 6δ crystal phase (with Z′ = 1), apparently breaking the common belief that increasing the temperature causes symmetry enhancement, may be tentatively explained by the occurrence of not fully counterbalancing molecular desymmetrization and crystal symmetry changes (triclinic to monoclinic). All these hypotheses cannot be easily tested, due to the coexistence of multiple phases, structure complexity and intrinsic peak broadening.
Differently, the reversible 10α → 10β transition, occurring near 163 °C upon heating, can be interpreted as the formation of a rotator phase. This was already described for longer n-alkanes by Hammami et al.37 Using the ΔT values (ΔT = Tmelting − Tcrystal-rotatorphasechange) reported therein, and calibrated vs. the number of carbon atoms in the chain, a rough estimate of the ΔT separation for n = 10 gives ΔT = 12 °C. This is in line with the temperature difference of the first two endothermic events observed in the DSC traces (the 10α to 10β transition and the formation of the 10γ – liquid crystalline – phase just before melting).
More difficult is, however, the interpretation of the “regular” behavior of 8α, insensitive, before melting, to temperature variations. As NDI4 and NDI6 demonstrated a rich polymorphic behavior induced mostly by the appearance of alternative (short) chain conformations, and as NDI10 only showed ordered and dynamically disordered n-decyl chains, the extended stability of the 8α phase is here tentatively attributed to the presence of a substantially all-trans conformation (fairly stabilized over gauche-containing conformers) and to the lack of the rotator phase, typical of solids encompassing longer alkyl chains. If this was true, then 8α is a fortunate case where two competing effects cancel each other.
4. Conclusions
We have studied the versatility of the structural arrangements of naphthalene-diimides bearing linear n-alkyl residues (n = 4, 6, 8 and 10). Thermal analyses, supplemented by optical imaging and variable temperature powder diffraction data (including ab initio structure determination) enabled the detection of many polymorphic crystal phases, and, in a few cases, the formation of transient liquid crystalline mesophases. Reversibility and hysteretic effects were estimated and used to interpret the compositions and texture of these materials when deposited as thin films.
A comparative analysis of their structural properties enabled us to separate the known RT α phases of these materials in two separate classes, characterized by different orbital overlaps, but, somewhat surprisingly not manifested by systematic changes in their colours.
As materials of this kind, including PDI derivatives, are widely studied for thin film applications, the detailed knowledge of their polymorphism, structures and stability ranges is of utmost importance. Being nearly impossible to structurally characterize them ab initio once deposited, the comprehension of their structural/energetic landscape from polycrystalline powders enabled us to understand the occasional co-presence and mechanism of the formation of the different phases under different (powder and film) preparation/treatment conditions. Work can be anticipated to extending this study to analogous materials with larger aromatic cores, or with differently substituted alkyl chains, including polydentate amines, in search of structurally and thermally stable crystal phases with enhanced transport properties.

 	Fig. 2  (a) The regular change of the temperature-corrected V/Z298 values for the entire NDIx series (x = 1–14). (b) Melting points of the NDIx materials vs. n-alkyl C atoms. Data were fit by a phenomenological exponential law:m.p. (NDIn) = 163.42 + 321.35e−0.383n.For n → ∞, m.p. should reach an asymptotic value close to 163 °C, while ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene melts at 147 °C.33 The slight discrepancy can be easily interpreted by the use of an arbitrary functional dependence (an exponential law), not fully valid outside the range of experimentally available m.p. values.	m.p. (NDIn) = 163.42 + 321.35e−0.383n.	 
m.p. (NDIn) = 163.42 + 321.35e−0.383n.

 	Fig. 3  Experimental and simulated 2D-GIXRD images of NDI4 (a and d), NDI8 (b and e) and NDI10 (c and f) films, together with a sketch of their molecular arrangement (α phases; g, h, i).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Experimental 2D-GIXD image and (b) specular scan of the NDI6 film; and (c) sketch of the molecular arrangement of the 6α phase.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Schematic definition of the stacking vector (SV) between two parallel NDI cores. Z is normal to the xy plane, and the SV must be taken in 3D space. cosχ, cosψ and cosφ are the direction cosines of the stacking vector, while the interplanar distance (π–π) is, simply, the z-coordinate of the SV. (b) Clustering (in the blue and red circles) of the different χ/ψ values for two markedly different stacking modes. The upper dots, for which ψ ≈ 53°, belong to the long chain derivatives (x = 8, 10, 12, 14). In the red circle are short chain derivatives (x = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6). Note that, since cos2χ + cos2ψ + cos2φ = 1, any other section of the χ, ψ, φ 3D space would have provided the same information. (c and d) Sketches of the two slightly different π–π overlaps, drawn for (c): χ = 69° and ψ =53° (blue circles in (b) and (d)): for χ = 77° and ψ = 43° (red circle in b).
