    , Accepted 16th February 2011First published on 14th March 2011AbstractWe report the synthesis, characterization and applications in dye-sensitized solar cells and photocatalysis of novel “rice grain-shaped” TiO2 mesostructures by electrospinning, which is a well-established and cost-effective technique for large-scale production of 1-D nanostructures. The porous and crystalline rice grain-like structures produced at 500 °C are uniformly distributed with a high surface area of ∼60 m2 g−1 and with mixed crystal structure. The origin of the unique morphology is traced to the microscale phase separation between TiO2 and the polymer during solvent evaporation owing to the solubility difference between the two. The morphology is excellently reproducible over a wide range of concentrations of the precursors and spinning conditions. Evolution of the unique morphology from fiber structures is probed by scanning electron microscopy analyses of systematically heated electrospun fibers. The rice grain morphology is stable up to 600 °C and with further increase in temperature, the shape distorts with accompanying changes to the anatase–rutile proportion and complete dominance of the rutile phase at 1000 °C. A comparison of the photovoltaic and photocatalytic performance of the material with P-25 TiO2 showed that the rice grain-shaped structures are superior to commercially available P-25. We anticipate that the material would have wide range of applications in other areas too such as photonic crystals, chemical sensors, self-cleaning materials, UV-blockers, etc.
Introduction
One-dimensional (1-D) oxide nanomaterials have been receiving tremendous interests for their unique functional properties such as semi-directed charge transport, enhanced charge carrier mobility and large surface area which are ideal for their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.1 The electron mobility in 1-D semiconductor nanostructures is typically several orders of magnitude higher than that in corresponding spherical nanoparticles.2,3 Amongst these fine structured materials, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a well-known wide band-gap semiconductor which occurs in nature in three distinct crystalline phases: anatase, rutile, and brookite. Nanostructured TiO2 has been studied extensively and produced in versatile morphologies such as tubes,3 wires,4 rods,5 flowers, cubes, and spindles by hydrothermal method,6 template growth,7 template-assisted anodic alumina membranes8 and other complex chemical processes.9–11 The morphology differences greatly influence their applications in optical devices, chemical sensors,12 photocatalysis,13 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).14–16 Therefore, precise controlling of morphology with high surface area and a particular crystal structure has attracted considerable attention among researchers.

Electrospinning is a well-established, cost-effective and scalable means to produce 1-D nanostructures.17 Since its first patent describing the basic operation principle in 1934, this method was employed widely to fabricate polymer nanofibers as well as other advanced ceramic materials including TiO2.17–19 Compared to hydrothermal and other complex chemical processes, this method provides a straightforward and economical way of producing 1-D nanostructures in mass scale by a simple set-up comprising three major parts: a high voltage power supply, a spinneret containing a polymeric precursor, and a collector (Scheme 1). Previously, we have successfully fabricated continuous TiO2 nanofibers by this method and explored their properties20 and applications in DSCs.21,22

Recently, we have reported a communication on the fabrication of rice grain-shaped TiO2 mesostructures by electrospinning.23 The present article explores the structural and optical properties of this novel mesostructure in detail which formed the solid basis for its further applications due to high surface area (∼60 m2 g−1), single crystalline nature of the particles, and particularly low rutile nucleation temperature in the anatase matrix (∼500 °C). Attempts to find evolution of this unique morphology, temperature-dependent shape- and crystal structure transformation, effect of precursor concentrations and experimental conditions on the morphology of the TiO2 structures as well as preliminary results on applications in DSCs are also presented. We anticipate that the material would have applications in other areas as well such as photocatalysis, optical devices, UV-blockers, self-cleaning materials, etc.
Experimental details
(a) Materials and methods
The TiO2 nano/mesostructures were fabricated by electrospinning according to the following route: 1.2 g of polyvinyl acetate (PVAc, Mw = 500000, Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added to 10 mL of N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc, 99.8%, GC Grade, Aldrich, Germany). This was followed by the addition of TiO2 sol prepared by mixing 2 mL of acetic acid (99.7%, LAB-SCAN Analytical Sciences, Thailand) and 1 mL of titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TiP, 97%, Aldrich, Germany). The precursor mixture was stirred at room temperature for ∼12 h to acquire sufficient viscosity for subsequent electrospinning. Electrospinning was then performed using a commercial machine, NANON (MECC, Japan). The applied voltage was 30 kV and the distance between the needle (27G ½) tip and the rotating drum collector (which is wrapped with aluminium, Al, foil) was ∼10 cm. The humidity level at the electrospinning chamber was controlled between 50 and 60%. The as-spun PVAc–TiO2 composite nanofibers were peeled-off from the Al foil in the form of a freestanding sheet. The material was then sintered at 500 °C for 1 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1 which caused a breakdown of the continuous fibers into the unique rice grain-like structures. The utility of the material was investigated for DSCs (using N3 dye, Dyesol, Australia) and photocatalysis and its performance was compared with that of commercially available titanium (IV) oxide (P-25, Degussa AG, Frankfurt, Germany) electrode fabricated under identical conditions.
(b) Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells

          DSCs were fabricated out of the rice-grain shaped TiO2 structures and P-25 by a combination of screen printing and doctor blading techniques. The thickness of the TiO2 electrodes was ∼11 µm (which was found to be the ideal thickness for DSCs).24 Briefly, 100 mg each of the rice grain-shaped TiO2 and P-25 TiO2 was mixed with 100 µL of polyester (synthesized by the polycondensation of ethylene glycol and citric acid in the presence of Ti4+ ions at 90–100 °C)24 and sonicated for about 12 h for obtaining a unique paste of right rheology necessary for doctor-blading. The paste was screen printed twice and doctor-bladed once to get an overall thickness of ∼15 µm on clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, Asahi Glass, Japan, sheet resistance <25 Ω/□) plates and subsequently left for relaxation in vacuum. The FTO plates were sintered in air at 500 °C for 1 h to get porous films (the thickness of the electrodes reduces to ∼11 µm upon sintering due to the evaporation of polyester from the mixture) and subsequently soaked in 0.5 mM N3 dye solution (in 1:1 acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol mixture) for 24 h for saturated chemisorption of the sensitizer (the active area of the electrode was 0.28 cm2). The TiO2 electrodes were subsequently washed with absolute ethanol for removing the unanchored dyes. The vacuum-dried photoelectrodes were sandwiched against a Pt counter-electrode in the presence of parafilm spacer and I3/I− electrolyte to assemble typical DSCs.
(c) Photocatalysis experiments
Five mg each of rice grain-shaped TiO2 and P-25 was dispersed in 45 mL Millipore water separately. About 1 mg of Alizarin Red S (Aldrich, Germany) powder was dissolved in 10 mL of Millipore water and was divided into portions of 5 mL each. Each of the Alizarin Red solution was added to the 45 mL TiO2 suspensions and stirred for about 30 min for adsorption equilibrium. The mixtures were then irradiated with a UV lamp (Dymac Ultraviolet Light source, 400 W power supply). About 5 mL of the sample was withdrawn at different time intervals, centrifuged to remove the TiO2 suspensions and the UV-Vis spectra of the supernatant (containing Alizarin Red S) were measured.
(d) Characterization
The morphologies of the as-spun nanofibers and the sintered rice grain-shaped mesostructures were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta 200 FEG System, FEI Company, USA, operated at 10 kV and JEOL JSM-6701F operated at 30 kV, respectively). Samples for SEM were prepared by sputtering a gold conducting layer on the electrospun nanofibers. The sintered mesostructures were further examined by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEOL 3010 operated at 300 kV). Samples for HR-TEM were prepared by dispersing the sintered TiO2 in methanol under sonication and then allowing a drop of this suspension to dry on a carbon-coated copper grid. The surface area was determined by BET measurement (NOVA 4200E Surface Area and Pore Size Analyzer, Quantachrome, USA). The TiO2 sample was dried under flowing N2 at 350 °C overnight prior to BET measurements (under standard protocols at 77 K). The optical properties were examined by UV-Vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer) with a spectral resolution of 1 nm. Samples for optical measurements were prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the TiO2 mesostructures in methanol. Phase transformation and crystal structure were studied in detail by X-ray diffractometry (Bruker D8 Advanced Thin Film X-ray Diffractometer) using stepwise temperature programming from 500 °C to 1000 °C with a dwelling time of 30 min. Samples for XRD were prepared by compressing the sintered TiO2 to a thin solid film at ambient pressure and scanned over a 2θ range of 20–60 degrees using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). Photocurrent and electrochemical impedance measurements were done using an XES-151 S solar simulator (San-Ei, Japan) under AM1.5 G condition and an Autolab PGSTAT30 (Eco Chemie B.V., The Netherlands), respectively, with automatic data acquisition.
Results and discussion
(a) Structural characteristics of rice grain-shaped TiO2

Fig. 1A and B, respectively, show the SEM images of the as-spun PVAc–TiO2 nanofibers in low- and high-magnifications revealing the typical electrospun nanofiber morphology with smooth but randomly-oriented deposition. The fibers were continuous with the diameters between 300 and 600 nm. After being subjected to sintering at 500 °C for 1 h in air, however, the fiber network nearly collapsed and the rice grain-shaped morphology appeared with uniform distribution and good inter-grain connectivity. Fig. 1C and D show a low- and a high-magnification SEM image, respectively, of the TiO2 mesorice grains. The average dimensions of the structures were ∼150 to 500 nm length and ∼100 to 250 nm diameter. The average diameters of the rice grain structures were nearly half of that of the as-spun fibers because of the evaporation of the polymer during the sintering process. As could be seen from Fig. 1C and D, respectively, the fiber structure is retained in some regions of the sintered material, where the fibers were made of rice grain-shaped particles. Each rice grain structure was porous (due to the evaporation of the polymer from the matrix) as evident from a high surface area of ∼60 m2 g−1 compared to that of ∼50 m2 g−1 for Degussa P-25. It was called ‘rice grain’ simply because its shape well matches with that of a typical rice grain with two sharp ends and a spheroid body (see Fig. 2 for a comparison of shapes). The rice grain morphology was further examined by HR-TEM. Fig. 3A is a TEM image of a single rice grain-like structure showing the presence of spherical particles (of 15–20 nm size) in it. Fig. 3B shows a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern from a rice grain-shaped structure in which the spotty pattern and the bright spots represent its amazing single crystalline nature. It was also interesting to note that the lattice-resolved TEM image given in Fig. 3C indicated that there exist two distinct lattice spacings corresponding to both anatase (d = 0.35 nm) and rutile (d = 0.32 nm) phases in a single rice grain-like structure (i.e. a small % of rutile in the anatase-dominant rice grain structure). This would be beneficial as the presence of a small amount of rutile in the anatase matrix is known to enhance the photocatalysis and photovoltaic characteristics of TiO2 by producing a band-bending at the anatase–rutile interface such that the charge carriers generated in the anatase region would facilitate hole migration to the rutile part.25a However, an alternative view proposed by Hurum et al. for explaining the enhanced properties of the mixed composition was based on interfacial surface trapping sites and hence charge transfer across the interface from rutile to anatase region.25b The rice grain structures in the present case have anatase and rutile phases in the same mesostructures and hence could be a superior alternative to the commercially available P-25, which is a blend of both anatase and rutile particles (both phases not in a single nanoparticle, though this is still controversial).25c

(b) 
          Anatase-to-rutile phase transformation with temperature
In order to insightfully explore the structural properties of the mesostructures, we performed a temperature-dependent XRD study. The sample was heated up to 1000 °C to see its phase evolution. Fig. 4 shows a set of X-ray diffraction patterns of the rice grain-like structures sintered at different temperatures under ambient conditions. The attenuation of the anatase (101) peak and the emergence of the rutile (110) peak imply the phase transformation in the sample. At 500 °C the rutile phase began to nucleate while at 1000 °C the anatase phase had completely transformed into the rutile one. The rutile phase nucleation temperature in the present case was significantly lower than that reported for TiO2 particles26 and nanofibers.27 To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest ‘rutile nucleation temperature’ ever reported for TiO2. Such a low phase transformation temperature may arise from the interplay between the surface energy and the forces that hold the particles together in the grain structures.27 It is well known that the phase transformation of anatase to rutile takes place during the calcination process. The fact that a small percentage of the rutile phase exists even at 500 °C implies nucleation and growth of the rutile phase at the interface of the anatase structures, which is feasible at low temperatures.26 However, with increase in temperature (∼600 to 800 °C), thermal fluctuation of Ti and O atoms becomes strong enough to generate additional rutile nuclei on anatase surfaces and the rutile phase grows by surface nucleation. With further increase in temperature (∼800 to 1000 °C), the rate of interface and surface nucleation of the rutile phase accelerates simultaneously resulting in complete transformation of anatase to rutile. The crystal sizes of anatase and rutile phases were determined from the corresponding major XRD peaks of anatase and rutile using the Scherer equation: L = Kλ/[Bcos θ](1)where L is the crystallite size, K is a constant taken as 0.89, λ is the wavelength of the X-ray, B is the full width at the half-maximum intensity, and θ is the Bragg angle. Table 1 lists the grain size evolution of anatase and rutile phases existing in the sample. It clearly indicated the trend of further crystallization of each phase and coalescence and growth of the grains with increasing temperatures. The calculated grain size of anatase at 500 °C was 16.6 nm which is in good accordance with that revealed from the HR-TEM data shown in Fig. 3A.

The XRD data above indicated growth in the grain size of TiO2 with increase in temperature due to the aggregation of particles. We anticipated that the rice grain morphology would undergo a distortion with increase in temperature. The TEM images of the TiO2 heated at 600 °C, 700 °C and 1000 °C, respectively, are shown in Fig. 5. The rice grain morphology was nearly stable at 600 °C (Fig. 5A) and gets distorted at 700 °C (Fig. 5B) accompanied by fusion of particles and completely disappear at 1000 °C (Fig. 5C). As could be seen from the images, the average sizes of the particles grew to ∼22 nm at 600 °C, 35 nm at 700 °C and ∼50 nm at 1000 °C. Fig. 5D–F, respectively, show the respective lattice-resolved images.

(c) Optical properties of mesostructures
The optical properties were investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Fig. 6 shows the characteristic absorption spectra of TiO2 rice grains sintered at 500 °C and 1000 °C, respectively. The tails in the visible region were the consequence of light scattering due to the TiO2 bundles dispersed in methanol. From the absorption edges present in both curves, we have estimated the band gap of the TiO2 rice grains to be ∼3.1 eV (500 °C, trace a) and ∼2.98 eV (1000 °C, trace b), respectively, which are slightly lower than that of pure anatase and pure rutile phases of bulk TiO2. The slight difference in band-gap could be due to the unique morphology as it has been reported that the structural differences of anatase and rutile dictate their optical and electrical properties.26

(d) Evolution of the rice grain morphology
While the rice grain morphology was interesting, we were also curious about the evolution of these unique nanostructures from the fibers. With the possible aim of probing the evolution of this morphology, the as-spun fibers were heated to 100 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C and 400 °C, respectively, and imaged by SEM. The respective images are shown in Fig. 7. While the as-spun fibers did not show any rice grain-like structures (low- and high-magnification images in Fig. 7A and B, respectively), the same heated at 100 °C (Fig. 7C) showed the presence of TiO2 rice grains in the translucent polymer matrix. This implies formation of the mesostructures from the fibers during the initial stages of the sintering process. With further increase of temperature, the rice grain-like shapes became more obvious because of the gradual decomposition of the polymer from the matrix (Fig. 7D and E, respectively). At 400 °C, a well-connected network of rice grain-shaped TiO2 structures was clearly seen (Fig. 7F).
 Fig. 7  
            SEM images of the as-spun electrospun fibers (A and B) heated to (C) 100 °C, (D) 200 °C, (E) 300 °C and (F) 400 °C, respectively. 
To get further insights on the origin of this unique morphology, we have used yet another polymer, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1.30 × 106 with the same wt% as in the case of PVAc), which is widely used in the electrospinning of TiO2 nanofibers.1,20 The fibers were spun under similar conditions (as in the case of PVAc) and subjected to sintering at 500 °C for 1 h. SEM images of the as-spun nanofibers and the sintered nanostructures are shown in Fig. 8A and B, respectively. As could be seen, the TiO2 retained continuous fiber structure even after sintering implying that when TiO2 was electrospun in the presence of strongly interacting polymers (such as PVP, which is a surfactant for TiO2 in nanoparticles preparation28), the normal continuous fiber structure would be retained. This is because of the strong adherence of TiO2 to the polymer surfaces. We have therefore concluded that the unique rice grain morphology arises from the result of poor solubility of TiO2 in the PVAc matrix which leads to their micro-phase separation during the solvent evaporation at the initial stages of the sintering process.
 Fig. 8  
SEM image of the TiO2–PVP composite nanofibers before (image A) and after (image B) sintering. Fig. C and D, respectively, show a large area TEM image of the fibers (the continuous structure was lost upon sonication for casting on TEM grids) and a resolved image of a single fiber. 
We have also investigated whether the rice grain morphology was characteristic of a specific composition of the precursors (PVAc and TiP concentrations) or the parameters (the applied voltage and the distance between the needle tip and the collector) mentioned in the experimental section. To check this, the concentration of PVAc in the electrospinning mixture was varied from 8, 10, 14 and 18 wt% (the solutions become non-spinnable with further increase of PVAc concentrations owing to very high viscosity) and TiP concentrations from 0.5 mL to 4 mL. It was found that the rice grain morphology and its average dimensions remain nearly unaffected with changes in the precursor concentrations. The SEM images of the rice grain structures obtained with 18 wt% PVAc (and 1 mL TiP) and 12 wt% PVAc (and 2 mL TiP) are shown in the images A, and B in Fig. 9. At high PVAc concentrations (18 wt%), however, the rice grain structures assembled to honeycomb-like structures. The rice grain morphology remained unaffected upon varying the applied voltage (20–30 kV) and the distance between the needle tip and the collector as well.
 Fig. 9  
            SEM images of the rice grain structures with (A) 18 wt% PVAc and 1 mL TiP and (B) 12 wt% PVAc and 2 mL TiP. 
It is clear from the morphology evolution study mentioned above that the rice grain-like structures evolve during the initial stages of the sintering process. It is natural to ask whether electrospinning is really needed to get this morphology as a simple heating in air could also result in solvent and polymer evaporation and hence the rice grain-like structures. To check this, we have sintered the PVAc/TiP/CH3COOH/DMAc mixture (the same composition as the one used for electrospinning) in a Petri dish to 500 °C in air for 1 h and analyzed the resulting TiO2 by SEM. As could be seen from Fig. 10, a majority of the TiO2 existed in bulk form with a few poorly defined rice grain-like structures scattered on the surfaces. This is understandable as electrospinning creates a jet through the needle and the rice grain structures evolved from the resultant smooth fibers could be well-defined in size, shape and porosity. This justifies why electrospinning is essential to obtain uniformly distributed porous mesostructures in the present case.

(e) Application in photovoltaics
Due to high porosity, excellent inter-grain connectivity and mixed phase crystal structure, the TiO2 rice grains were investigated for their use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Fig. 11A shows a comparison of the photovoltaic (PV) performance of the rice grain-shaped TiO2 (trace a) and the commercially available P-25 (trace b) DSCs. The dye-loading was found to be 1.49 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for P-25 and 1.61 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for the rice grain DSCs. While the current density (Jsc) was nearly the same for both the DSCs (9.40 mA cm−2 for rice grain and 9.34 mA cm−2 for P-25), the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was higher for the rice grain-shaped one (0.815 and 0.765 V, respectively). As a result, the rice grain-shaped electrode showed a slightly higher efficiency (4.63%) than the P-25 (4.49%). This is further reflected in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE, as a function of wavelength) of the two DSCs (traces a and b in Fig. 11B). While the peak of the IPCE spectrum (at 532 nm, which corresponds to the absorption maximum of the N3 dye) was 44% for the rice grain DSC, the same for P-25 was 41%. The IPCE spectrum of the rice grain DSC was higher than that of the P-25 (by ∼7.3%) in all the wavelengths up to 600 nm. The two most important factors governing high IPCE are the improved electron transport through the TiO2 network and the prevention of electron back transfer.29 We have performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, measured at a forward bias of 0.7 V in the absence of illumination)30 to gain further insights into the superior performance of the rice grain DSCs (Fig. 11C). The Nyquist plots of DSCs normally show three semi-circles, corresponding to redox reaction at the counter electrode (high frequency), electron transfer at the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface (medium frequency) and transport by ions of the electrolyte (low frequency). The low frequency one is overshadowed in the present case because of the large charge transport resistance shown by the TiO2. Nyquist plots indicate that the overall series resistance (Rs) of the DSCs was 27 Ω for P-25 and 20 Ω for the rice grains. The reduction in the Rs improved the Voc of the rice grain DSC (as seen from the I–V traces shown above). Further, a comparison of the Nyquist plots for the rice grain and P-25 DSCs showed a large semi-circle in the medium frequency range for the former one, which indicates smaller charge recombination rate. This confirmed that the charge recombination between the injected electrons and the redox electrolyte is retarded in rice grain DSCs than in the P-25. This is reflected in the Bode phase plots of the two (traces a and b in Fig. 11D) as well. The characteristic frequency peaks shifted from 28 Hz for the P-25 to 21 Hz for the rice grain DSCs. As this frequency is related to the inverse of recombination life time or electron life time in the TiO2 network,30,31 this implies that the collection and transport of electrons in the DSC with rice grains was faster than that in the P-25. Thus it can be concluded that the DSCs made of rice grain-shaped TiO2 are superior than the spherical P-25 owing to a reduction in the overall series resistance, reduced electron recombination and hence extended electron life time in the TiO2 network and a reduction in the electron back transfer. Further studies are underway to gain more insights into these interesting observations.
 Fig. 11  Fig. A shows a comparison of the I–V response of the rice grain DSC (trace a) and the P-25 (trace b). Fig. B, C and D show the IPCE, electrochemical impedance and Bode phase plots of the two in the same order. 
(f) Application in photocatalysis

Fig. 12A and B, respectively, show the UV light-assisted degradation of Alizarin Red S dye in the presence of TiO2 rice grains and the P-25. Fig. 12A shows the rate of decomposition of the dye, where ‘C0’ is the initial dye concentration and ‘C’ is the concentration at a time ‘t’. The data in Fig. 12A were converted into kinetic plots in Fig. 12B, according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model.32 The first order rate constants estimated from the plots showed a higher value for the rice grain-shaped TiO2 (0.16 min−1vs. 0.15 min−1 for the P-25). Thus, we have concluded that the TiO2 rice grains are better photocatalysts than the P-25. The enhanced photocatalysis of rice grain-shaped TiO2 could be attributed to its single crystalline nature and high surface area in comparison to the P-25.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we report the synthesis of a unique rice grain-like morphology of TiO2 by electrospinning of a poly(vinyl acetate) solution of titanium (IV) isopropoxide in acetic acid/N,N-dimethyl acetamide mixture and subsequent calcination at 500 °C. Each rice grain-like structure was porous and composed of both anatase and rutile phases and possesses the lowest rutile nucleation temperature of ∼500 °C. The origin of this unique morphology was traced to the microscale phase separation between TiO2 and PVAc (owing to their solubility difference) during the solvent evaporation process. Evolution of the rice grain shapes from the fibers was probed by microscopy analyses of systematically heated fibers. The photovoltaic and charge transport characteristics of the material were studied by current–voltage, IPCE and electrochemical impedance measurements. With added advantages of high surface area and single crystalline nature of spherical particles in the rice grain structures, we believe this simple method would provide a means for mass production and the mesostructures would open up new vistas for potential applications in industry. We believe that the TiO2 mesorice grains would be a potential or even superior alternative to commercial P-25 and would find broad applications in dye-sensitized solar cells and other catalytic applications.
