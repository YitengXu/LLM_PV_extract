    , Accepted 22nd September 2014First published on 22nd September 2014AbstractWe report a novel way to accelerate the rate of oxidized sensitizer neutralization on nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode surfaces using a novel coadsorbent, 3,4,5-tris-butenyloxy benzoic acid (TD), having three terminal double bonds. 1H NMR and contact angle measurements revealed that the terminal double bonds reacted with I2 to form an in situ-generated ionic layer of I− species. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies demonstrated that I− species neighbouring the cationic dye molecules (D+) accelerate the neutralization (or regeneration) rate (kD+), as well as decrease the recombination reactions of photoinduced electrons with D+ (k1) and I3− (k2). Dye-sensitized solar cells treated with TD exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 10.2%, which is 22% higher due to the simultaneous improvements in JSC and VOC, even at 15% low dye loading levels, compared to the values obtained from a conventional device.

Broader context
The rate of oxidized sensitizer neutralization is considered as a rate-determining step among the many electrochemical reactions at the interfaces of TiO2/sensitizers (D)/electrolytes (redox species) in dye-sensitized solar cells. Therefore, the faster rate of oxidized sensitizer neutralization might lead to an improved light harvesting, resulting in a highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cell. Here, a new concept to accelerate the rate of oxidized sensitizer neutralization is constructed using an in situ-generated ionic layer of I− species on a nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode. The estimated regeneration time of our device is one order of magnitude shorter than that of the control device, demonstrating that in situ-generated I− participated in the regeneration of D+. Our novel concept has not been tried by others, although a variety of coadsorbents have been tested in the context of the sensitization process. This work emphasizes the importance of understanding and engineering the interfaces in DSCs and will provide insights into various optoelectronic fields.

Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are based on a nanoscale-crystalline TiO2 layer covered with dyes and capable of harvesting sunlight.1 As shown in Fig. 1(a), many photo- and electrochemical reactions take place at the interfaces between the nanoscale TiO2 crystals, the dyes, and the electrolyte, which includes redox species, such as I− and I3−.2,3 Understanding and engineering such interfaces are a key approach to improving the photovoltaic performances of DSCs.4,5 Upon light absorption, the excited dye (D*) injects an electron (e−) into the conduction band (ECB) of TiO2 (kinj), producing an oxidized dye (D+) that is subsequently neutralized by I− (kD+). The injected electron may diffuse into the surface states below the ECB of the TiO2 electrode and will recombine with oxidized species, such as D+ or I3− (k1 and k2), resulting in the decreased charge collection efficiency (ηcc). Katoh and Haque, independently, reported1b,6 that the dye-regeneration rate (kD+) is ∼μs time scale which is much longer than the electron injection rate (kinj ∼ >ps). Meanwhile, the recombination rates (k1 and k2) with D+ or I3− are in the range of ∼1 ms.6,7 Therefore, the dye-regeneration process (∼kD+) could be considered as a rate-determining step in the electrochemical reactions. In turn, the faster kD+ might lead to the less recombination of the photoinduced electrons with D+ or I3− (Fig. 1(b)). Increasing the concentration of redox species could enhance the recombination process, but result in the decrease of open circuit voltage (VOC) values.7,8

The short circuit current density (JSC) is typically estimated using the equation9JSC ∝ ηlh × ηinj × ηcc × ηreg (ηlh: the light harvesting efficiency, ηinj: the electron injection efficiency from D* into the ECB of TiO2, and ηreg: the regeneration efficiency of D+ by the redox couple). The value of ηinj is influenced by the energy gap between the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of D and the ECB of TiO2, as well as by the dye adsorption mode or the presence of aggregates at the TiO2 electrode surfaces.10 Assuming that the values of ηinj do not vary significantly for a given device preparation process, JSC is proportional to, first, the quantity and light harvesting efficiency (ηlh) of D and, secondly, the regeneration process (ηreg). To this end, we hypothesized that if the presence of I− species neighboring the D+ species were ensured by forming an ionic layer on the TiO2 surface at an equilibrium state, then the dye-regeneration reaction (ηreg) efficiency would improve, thereby facilitating the light harvesting process (ηlh) by accelerating the regeneration rate (kD+), which also minimizes k1 and k2.
Here, we demonstrate the enhancement of the light harvesting process by accelerating kD+. We synthesized a novel coadsorbent, 3,4,5-tris-butenyloxy benzoic acid (TD), having three terminal double bonds (Fig. 1(c); 3,4,5-tri-butoxy benzoic acid (TA) without double bonds), which is capable of forming an ionic layer on the TiO2 electrode surfaces (Fig. 1(b)) through the reversible iodization process (Fig. 1(d)). It is noticed that our novel concept has not been tried by others, although a variety of coadsorbents have been tested in the context of the sensitization process.11

Fabrication of DSCs
The nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode was immediately immersed in the dye solution at room temperature for 18 h. The dye solution consisted of 0.3 mM N719 in acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (1:1 v/v). The coadsorbents, TA or TD, were introduced to the dye solution at constant concentrations (0.3 mM). Coadsorbents were introduced to the dye solutions by transferring appropriate volumes of a 6 mM stock solution to yield the desired final concentrations. The counter electrode was prepared by introducing two holes, using a sandblasting drill, in the FTO glass substrate. The substrate was subsequently washed using the washing method described above. The Pt paste was pasted onto the predrilled FTO glass and subsequently sintered using the programmed heating procedure. The dye-coated photoanode and the counter electrode were assembled and sealed as a sandwich using a transparent 60 μm thick Surlyn spacer (DuPont) by hot pressing. The interelectrode space was filled with the electrolyte solution through the predrilled hole in the counter electrode surface, and the holes were covered with a Surlyn sheet and a thin cover glass followed by heating. The electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M BMII, 0.06 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M LiI, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v). More details are included in the ESI.†
Transient absorption spectrophotometry
Pulsed laser excitation was applied using a Continuum Surelite-II Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (λ = 355 nm, 10 Hz repetition rate). The output of the optical parametric oscillator (OPO, pulse width at half-height 5 ns) was tuned at 532 nm and attenuated to 75 μJ per cm2 pulse. The analyzer light, produced by a 150 W Xe arc lamp, was passed through the sample, and was detected by the amplifier equipped Si photodiode. A 1 GHz band-pass digital signal analyzer was employed to record the time course of the optical absorbance changes induced by the laser excitation of the films. Satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios were typically obtained by averaging over 512 laser shots.
Results and discussion
The iodization process was monitored by 1H NMR, using 1-hexene as a model compound. The olefinic active site in 1-hexene provided three peaks, Ha and two diastereotopic Hb and Hc peaks (Fig. 2(a)). The addition of I2 to the 1-hexene solution (d-chloroform) generated three new peaks (Ha1, Hb1, and Hc1), in addition to the peaks corresponding to 1-hexene at equilibrium. The latter pattern was identical to the peaks provided by propylene oxide, indicating that the two protons (Hb and Hc) retained their diastereotopic environments (see ESI for details, Fig. S2†). In d-acetonitrile solution, further reactions were expected, as d-acetonitrile is competitive and contains greater amounts of water molecules than d-chloroform; however, indistinguishable results were obtained in d-acetonitrile and d-chloroform, after the removal of residual water (Fig. 2(b) and S3†). Interestingly, the presence of water shifted the peak positions of the diastereotopic protons (Hb1 and Hc1) (see ESI for details, Fig. S4†), which were more exposed to water molecules than Ha1, down-field. The positive charge on I+ would then have been stabilized by dispersing the charges across the carbon atom connected to Hb1 and Hc1 (Fig. S5†).

(c) Water contact angle before and after iodization of TA and TD anchored on the TiO2 substrate surfaces. 
Water contact angle (ΘC) measurements supported the conclusion that ionic complexes were generated at the double bonds of TD, as shown in Fig. 2(c) (see also Fig. S6†). Unlike the case of TA, the ΘC value of the TiO2 electrode covered with TD, after treatment with a dried acetonitrile (AN) solution containing I2 and KI, decreased significantly from 66 to 28°. This result indicated that the double bonds reacted with I2 and were then solvated with water, consistent with the 1H NMR experiments.
We examined the rapid regeneration of D+ by the ionic complexes, including I−. The rate of dye regeneration (ca. ∼106 s−1) typically exceeds the recombination reaction rates (ca. ∼1 103 s−1);1b,6 therefore, in the presence of redox species, most D+ species could be regenerated by I−.10aFig. 3(a) shows the normalized decay profiles of D+ probed at 790 nm using TAS (D+ + e− → D). The estimated regeneration time at 0.5 ΔO.D. for TiO2/N719 (with TD)/AN (I− + I3−) was 0.2 ± 0.03 μs, one order of magnitude shorter than those for TiO2/N719 (with TA)/AN (I− + I3−) or the control device, demonstrating that in situ-generated I− on TD participated in the regeneration of D+.

The 790 nm absorption profile examined the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition associated with the ligand-localized D+,10a upon excitation at 532 nm (the maximum absorption of the N719 dye) (Fig. S7†). (c) Bode plots obtained from devices prepared with TA or TD (N719 + TA or N719 + TD), in comparison with the control device (N719-only), using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy under dark conditions in the vicinity of VOC (0.63 V) (Fig. S8†). 
The TA and TD coadsorbents formed a physical barrier, which would increase the interfacial resistance at the TiO2/D/electrolyte interface and decrease k1 and k2, as has been observed previously.4c,11c,12 The effects of the coadsorbents on k1 and k2 were characterized using TAS1d,8,13 and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),10a respectively. In the absence of redox species (I3− and I−), the photoinduced electrons were expected to recombine with D+s (thus, k1: D+ + e− (TiO2) → D). The estimated lifetime of D+ at 0.5 ΔO.D. in the electrodes prepared with the TA and TD coadsorbents (∼5.0 ms) was longer than the lifetime of D+ in the control electrode (2.5 ms) as revealed by the decay kinetics of k1 (Fig. 3(b)). In the presence of the electrolytes (I3− and I−), the photoinduced electrons mainly recombined with I− (k2: I3− + e− (TiO2) → I−). The electron lifetimes (τe,(k2)) in the electrodes prepared with TA and TD (38 ms) were longer than that in the control electrode (28 ms), as shown in the Bode plots (Fig. 3(c)).
Finally, the role of the ionic layer in the photoelectrochemical reaction was examined in the context of device operation, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and Table 1. The quantities of N719 adsorbed onto the electrodes cosensitized with TA or TD were measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer and were found to be 15 or 16% lower, respectively, than the quantity adsorbed onto the control electrode (N719 only, see the inset in Fig. 4(a)), indicating that N719 and the coadsorbents (TA and TD) competed for anchoring sites on the Ti4+ active sites of the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes.11c,11f

The power conversion efficiency (η) of the device prepared with TD was 10.2%, 23% improvement compared to the control device (η = 8.3%).14 The improvement was ascribed to the increased JSC as well as VOC values, even in 15% low dye-loading in the device prepared with TD. The VOC values of the devices prepared with TA and TD are ca. 40 mV higher than that obtained in the control device, probably due to the increased interfacial resistance at the TiO2/D/electrolyte interface as demonstrated in the EIS experiments (Fig. 3(c)). The increased interfacial resistance could minimize the JSC loss caused by the recombination reactions, resulting in the relative increase in VOC according to the equation:15VOC ∼ (nkT/q)ln(JSC/JS) (n: the device ideality factor, k: the Boltzmann constant, T: the temperature in Kelvin, q: the fundamental charge, and JS: the saturation current density). In addition, we measured the density-of-states (DOS) on the TiO2 surfaces using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S10†).
As Grätzel16 and we,11b independently, reported, the capacitive currents in the electrodes at the TiO2/1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BMIB)17 interface displayed gradual onsets under a forward potential. The lower-energy surface states, in which photoinduced electrons were trapped, resulted in fewer recombination reactions. The electrode prepared with TA and TD indicated that the edge of the TiO2 conduction band was shifted ca. 63 mV toward the vacuum level compared to the control electrode (Fig. 5). Therefore, the coadsorbents (TA) present on the TiO2 electrode surface reduced k1 and k2.
 Fig. 5  The energy levels at the TiO2film/BMIB interface in the electrodes prepared with TA or TD (N719 + TA or N719 + TD), or with a control electrode (N719 only), were estimated using cyclic voltammetry using a 0.05 V s−1 scan rate. 
The overall increase in JSC (16.2 to 16.3 mA cm−2) for the device with TA was negligible due to the decrease in the dye loading level by 16%, in spite of the less recombination. On the other hand, the device prepared with TD exhibited an increase in JSC (16.2 to 17.7 mA cm−2) as well as VOC (0.735 to 0.783 V). We also confirmed the tendency in a thinner TiO2 active layer (Fig. S11†). Highly ionic coadsorbents (e.g., 4-guanidinobutyric11b or chenodeoxycholic acid18) have been tested previously, but these coadsorbents only increased either the VOC or the JSC value. The increase in JSC as well as VOC, as observed in the device prepared with TD, could not be ascribed to the ionic character or the alcohol groups generated by scavenging water molecules. We verified the JSC values of the devices by comparison with the calculated JSC values obtained from the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 4(b)).19 Therefore, we concluded that the dye regeneration reaction (∼ηreg) occurred efficiently through the reaction between the I− species generated on TD and D+, thereby facilitating the light harvesting process (∼ηlh), even at a low dye loading level.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that TD, which includes three terminal double bonds, reacted with I2 and generated ionic complexes on the surfaces of a TiO2 electrode. The in situ-generated ionic layer accelerated the neutralization (or regeneration) rate (kD+) of D+ and decreased the recombination reactions with D+ (k1) and I3− (k2) due to coadsorbent effects. The device cosensitized with TD provided a power conversion efficiency of 10.2%, which is 22% higher due to the simultaneous improvements in JSC and VOC, even at 15% low dye loading levels, compared to the values obtained from a conventional device under identical experimental conditions. This work demonstrated the importance of understanding and engineering the interfaces between nanoscale TiO2 crystals, dyes, and electrolytes at the molecular level and will provide insights into various optoelectronic fields.

Broader context
The rate of oxidized sensitizer neutralization is considered as a rate-determining step among the many electrochemical reactions at the interfaces of TiO2/sensitizers (D)/electrolytes (redox species) in dye-sensitized solar cells. Therefore, the faster rate of oxidized sensitizer neutralization might lead to an improved light harvesting, resulting in a highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cell. Here, a new concept to accelerate the rate of oxidized sensitizer neutralization is constructed using an in situ-generated ionic layer of I− species on a nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode. The estimated regeneration time of our device is one order of magnitude shorter than that of the control device, demonstrating that in situ-generated I− participated in the regeneration of D+. Our novel concept has not been tried by others, although a variety of coadsorbents have been tested in the context of the sensitization process. This work emphasizes the importance of understanding and engineering the interfaces in DSCs and will provide insights into various optoelectronic fields.

 	Fig. 3  Normalized decay profiles of D+ in devices prepared with TA or TD (N719 + TA or N719 + TD), in comparison with the control device (N719-only), probed at 790 nm using transient absorption spectroscopy in the presence (a) or absence (b) of redox species. The 790 nm absorption profile examined the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition associated with the ligand-localized D+,10a upon excitation at 532 nm (the maximum absorption of the N719 dye) (Fig. S7†). (c) Bode plots obtained from devices prepared with TA or TD (N719 + TA or N719 + TD), in comparison with the control device (N719-only), using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy under dark conditions in the vicinity of VOC (0.63 V) (Fig. S8†).

The inset in (a): comparison of amounts of N719 adsorbed on the TiO2 electrodes calculated using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The inset in (b): comparison of JSC values calculated from IPCE (%) spectra and J–V curves. J–V curves measured under AM 1.5 irradiation (DSCs: 12 μm thickness of TiO2 and 0.078 cm2 active areas defined using a black metal mask).	 


N719 only	1.00	0.735	16.2	69.9	8.3
N719 + TA	0.84	0.773	16.3	73.2	9.2
N719 + TD	0.85	0.783	17.7	73.2	10.2

 	Fig. 5  The energy levels at the TiO2film/BMIB interface in the electrodes prepared with TA or TD (N719 + TA or N719 + TD), or with a control electrode (N719 only), were estimated using cyclic voltammetry using a 0.05 V s−1 scan rate.
