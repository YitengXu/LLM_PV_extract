    , Accepted 17th May 2012First published on 18th May 2012AbstractA low band-gap conjugated polymer, PBDTDPP, composed of unsubstituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole was synthesized. The deep HOMO level of PBDTDPP enhances the VOC of a PSC up to 0.82 V and exhibits a PCE of 5.16%, while alkoxy substituted PBDTDPP-OR yields a PCE of 2.24% with a VOC of 0.61 V.
Polymer-based organic solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a great deal of interest as a promising energy resource because of their advantages such as low manufacturing cost and flexible device applications over inorganic solar cells.1 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs is not yet satisfactory for commercialization, although recent progress in the past two years have achieved PCEs over 8%.2 One of the most successful approaches to achieve high efficiency PSCs is development of low band-gap conjugated polymers.3 Low band-gap conjugated polymers based on internal donor–acceptor interaction have special advantages because their absorption ranges can be extended to longer wavelengths to absorb more photons,4 and their electronic property can be easily tuned by an appropriate combination of donor and acceptor units.5
Recently diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) has emerged as a promising building block of low band-gap conjugated polymers for optoelectronic applications, including both organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and PSCs.6 Its highly conjugated structure leads to strong π–π interaction and its electron deficiency means DPP has potential use as an electron-accepting unit for synthesis of low band-gap conjugated polymers.7,8 Particularly, several conjugated polymers based on DPP have exhibited promising PCEs around 5% in PSCs when DPP is copolymerized with electron-donating units such as thiophene, benzene, naphthalene or furan.9,10
Meanwhile benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) derivatives, particularly alkoxy-substituted BDT, are among the most widely used electron-donating units in low band-gap conjugated polymers. Several BDT-based low band-gap conjugated polymers have shown great potential for fabrication of PSCs with high mobility and impressive PCEs exceeding 5% when BDT is copolymerized with various electron-accepting units such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,11 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione,12 or thieno[3,4-b]thiophene.13
Hence, alternating copolymers composed of BDT and DPP are expected to afford high performance PSCs. Yang and co-workers reported a low band-gap conjugated polymer, PDPP-BDT, composed of 4,8-dioctyloxy-substituted BDT and DPP.14a Although PDPP-BDT exhibited a low band-gap of 1.31 eV and broad light absorption of 600–900 nm, the PSCs showed only moderate PCE of 2.53% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.68 V, due to a relatively high-lying HOMO level of −5.16 eV, and low molecular weight of 8.5 kDa. Patil and co-workers have also reported a conjugated polymer, TDPP-BBT, which is composed of 4,8-dihexyloxy-substituted BDT and DPP.14b In spite of a moderate molecular weight of 11.6 kDa, the TDPP-BBT showed only a slightly enhanced PCE of 2.78% with a VOC of 0.74 V. Recently, Ding and co-workers also reported a similar conjugated polymer based on 4,8-dioctyl-substituted BDT and DPP, which exhibited a promising PCE of 4.1% with enhanced JSC and fill factor (FF) while the VOC was 0.71 V, which was a limiting factor for high efficiency PSCs.14c
It is well known that alkoxy groups have strong electron-donating power and thus conjugated polymers substituted with alkoxy groups usually exhibit high-lying HOMO levels.15a,b For instance, the HOMO levels of poly(3-alkylthiophene) (P3AT) and poly(3-alkoxythiophene) (P3AOT) are at ca. −5.1 and −4.5 eV, respectively. Since the VOC of PSCs is proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of donor and the LUMO level of acceptor, the VOC of P3AOT/PCBM-based PSC (0.1 V) is much lower than that of P3AT/PCBM-based PSC (0.6 V).15c This result suggests lowering of the HOMO level of the BDT-based polymer by removal of the alkoxy side group from alkoxy-substituted BDT so as to enhance the VOC of PSCs.
Here, we report a novel low band-gap conjugated polymer, PBDTDPP (Scheme 1), composed of unsubstituted BDT and DPP, as electron-donating and -accepting units, respectively. Because the alkoxy group (strong electron-donating substituent) is removed from alkoxy-substituted BDT, PBDTDPP is expected to exhibit a low-lying HOMO level. To ensure the solubility of the polymer, unsubstituted BDT was copolymerized with a DPP having long branched side groups (2-octyldodecane). Previously we have reported that 2-octyldodecane-substituted DPP affords a high molecular weight conjugated polymer when it was copolymerized with unsubstituted dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene.15d The HOMO level of PBDTDPP was −5.46 eV and the PSC exhibited a promising PCE of 5.16% with a VOC of 0.82 V when it was blended with PC71BM. These values are much higher than those of alkoxy-substituted BDT-based polymer (PBDTDPP-OR) (see Table 1).

PBDTDPP was synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction of BDT and DPP in anhydrous toluene with a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh)3Cl2 (Fig. S1†). Details of preparation of monomers, polymerization and their characterizations are given in ESI†. PBDTDPP has a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 22.6 kDa and polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.20, while PBDTDPP-OR has Mn of 35.7 kDa and PDI of 2.74. Both PBDTDPP and PBDTDPP-OR are very soluble in common organic solvents such as tetraiodofuran, chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB).
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of PBDTDPP and PBDTDPP-OR in solution and as films are shown in Fig. 1. PBDTDPP and PBDTDPP-OR show similar absorption spectra with a wide absorption range of 600–900 nm. The absorption maximum (λmax) of PBDTDPP is at 750 nm in both solution and film state, while PBDTDPP-OR shows λmax at 740 nm. The red shift of PBDTDPP in absorption spectra, in spite of the lower molecular weight of PBDTDPP than PBDTDPP-OR, indicates that PBDTDPP chains have more planar conformation than PBDTDPP-OR to induce better molecular packing. Furthermore, a more pronounced vibronic shoulder in PBDTDPP film provides further evidence that the self-assembly of PBDTDPP in the film state is more effective than that of PBDTDPP-OR (see Fig. 1 and S3†).

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDTDPP and PBDTDPP-OR were measured by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3†). The HOMO and LUMO levels of PBDTDPP are at −5.46 and −3.74 eV, respectively, which are considerably lower than those of PBDTDPP-OR (HOMO: −5.29 eV, LUMO: −3.55 eV). The reason for the deeper HOMO level of PBDTDPP is that the alkoxy side group (electron-donating group) is removed from the alkoxy-substituted BDT unit.
Photovoltaic properties of PBDTDPP was measured with the general device structure of ITO|PEDOT:PSS|polymer:PC71BM|LiF|Al (Fig. 2). Details of device fabrication and characterization are summarized in ESI†. The optimum weight ratio of PBDTDPP to PC71BM was 1:1, which yields a PCE of 5.16% with a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 10.49 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 60.0%. As the ratio of PC71BM to PBDTDPP increases, the PCE decreases to 1%. The VOC of the PBDTDPP-based device (0.82 V) is 0.21 V higher than that of a PBDTDPP-OR based device. Therefore we conclude that the deep HOMO level of PBDTDPP increases the VOC and consequently enhances the PCE. We also tried to improve the device performance by addition of 1,8-diiodooctane as an additive, but efficiency enhancement was not observed for either copolymer. Further optimization by different additives for efficiency enhancement is a possible area of future study.

To further understand the high performance of PBDTDPP, the molecular orientations of PBDTDPP thin films were investigated by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The GIWAXS pattern of an as-cast PBDTDPP thin film shows an intense diffraction peak at qz = 0.33 Å−1 and a broad peak at qz = 1.44 Å−1, corresponding to the (100) reflection of polymer crystals with an interlayer spacing of 18.9 Å, and the (010) reflection with a π–π stacking distance of 4.36 Å, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3a. PBDTDPP is highly crystalline in an as-spun thin film and the crystallinity is relatively insensitive to thermal annealing temperature, indicating that the PBDTDPP polymer chains readily form a layered structure on the substrate as the solvent evaporates, owing to strong intermolecular π–π interactions. It should be noted here that the observation of a (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction of GIWAXS scattering indicates the face-on orientation of the polymer crystals on the substrate (Fig. 3b). This may contribute to relatively high JSC and FF.

When the charge transport was measured by space charge limited current (SCLC) hole mobility measurement,16 the SCLC hole mobilities of PBDTDPP:PC71BM and PBDTDPP-OR:PC71BM blend films were 2.75 × 10−4 and 7.42 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S4†). The three-fold higher hole mobility of PBDTDPP than PBDTDPP-OR may also contribute to higher JSC of PBDTDPP than that of PBDDTDPP-OR.
The nanoscale morphologies of PBDTDPP:PC71BM films were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As seen in Fig. 4, a nanoscale interconnected network structure between fibril-like polymer and PC71BM is well developed in 1:1 ratio film, while the dark PC71BM phase becomes dominant and the density of polymer fibrils becomes low in films with blend ratios of 1:1.5 and 1:2. The well developed interconnected network structure affords not only high JSC but also good FF.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the use of unsubstituted BDT can be a promising building block for conjugated polymers for high efficiency PSCs. The removal of the alkoxy side group from the alkoxy-substituted BDT lowers the HOMO level and thereby raises the VOC of PSCs. A PBDTDPP-based PSC device exhibits a promising PCE of 5.16%. Our result herein provides an additional important insight into rational design of new low band-gap conjugated polymers for development of high performance organic solar cells.
