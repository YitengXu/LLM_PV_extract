    , Accepted 8th June 2022First published on 8th June 2022AbstractConventional conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene films are limited by their low transparency and brittleness. Herein, we demonstrate a crack-template assisted spraying methodology for the fabrication of transparent, flexible, and conductive MXene grid–silver nanowire hierarchical films for high-performance electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, joule heating, and resistive touch panel applications. The conductive grid skeletons are constructed by depositing MXene sheets into the cracks of the templates followed by removing the templates. By tuning the loading density of MXene sheets, both optical transmittance and electrical conductivity of MXene grid skeletons can be precisely manipulated. The resultant conductive grid exhibits an EMI shielding efficiency of 21.7 dB and fair transmittance simultaneously. Crucially, one-dimensional silver nanowires (AgNWs) are adopted to construct hierarchical structures for increasing electron transport channels and enhancing light penetration. The hierarchical MXene grid/AgNW film achieves a high transmittance of 81% and an excellent EMI shielding efficiency of 24.6 dB. The transparent, flexible and conductive MXene grid/AgNW film is suitable for transparent heaters and resistive touch panels. The integration of grid fabrication and the hierarchical structure design effectively balances the transparency and the conductivity, and is promising for producing multifunctional films with high transparency, high conductivity, and high EMI shielding efficiency.
Introduction
The rapid development of wearable electronics and intelligent monitoring devices brings about increasing demands for transparent, flexible and conductive films with intelligent responses.1–6 Because electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radiation often adversely affect adjacent electronic devices and the human health, and sometimes cause tremendous economic losses,7–10 transparent and conductive films are required to possess satisfactory EMI shielding performances for practical applications.11–14 One of the main challenges of conductive films is to balance efficient EMI shielding efficiency and high optical transmittance. Generally, a high-performance EMI shielding film requires high electrical conductivity and reasonable optical transmittance. Traditional indium tin oxide (ITO) has been widely exploited in industrial production because of its balanced electrical conductivity and optical transmittance.15 However, its intrinsic mechanical brittleness, low manufacturing efficiency, and high-cost restrict its application in the fields of flexible wearable devices and intelligent detection.16,17 To date, various conductive alternatives have been reported, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs),18,19 metal nanowires,20–22 graphene,18,23–25 and transition metal carbide/carbonitride (MXene) sheets.26–29 Although metal nanowires with excellent photoelectric properties are used for transparent and conductive films in the areas of touch screens, solar cells, and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),30 the high contact resistance between the metal nanowires is still a troublesome problem.31,32 Similarly, two-dimensional (2D) MXene sheets are also promising for EMI shielding due to their metallic electrical conductivity, abundant surface functional groups, and layered structure;33–36 however, the optical transmittance of conductive MXene films is less satisfactory. Gao et al. tried to balance the transparency and conductivity of MXene thin films by drop-casting different concentrations of MXene colloidal dispersions, achieving optical transmittances of ∼87% (∼1200 Ω sq−1) and ∼29% (∼100 Ω sq−1).37 By spin-coating aqueous MXene dispersions, Park et al. realized a transmittance modulation of MXene films from 78% to 67% with low sheet resistances.38 Recently, Koo et al. used an interface self-assembly approach to fabricate ultrathin MXene films with excellent optical transmittance and EMI shielding performance, reaching an EMI shielding efficiency of 10 dB at an optical transmittance of 43%.39 Additionally, dip-coating, and layer-by-layer (LbL) spraying are also applied for optimizing optical transmittance and electrical conductivity of MXene films.26,40 So far, it is still a challenge for ultrathin MXene films with both satisfactory optical transparency and high EMI shielding efficiency.
Herein, we develop a crack-template assisted spraying methodology to prepare Ti3C2Tx MXene grids and their hierarchical films with both high optical transmittances and high EMI shielding performances. The MXene grids are fabricated by spraying MXene dispersions into the cracks of templates followed by removing the templates, and the optical transmittance and EMI shielding efficiency of the MXene grids can be optimized by tuning the deposition density of the MXene suspensions. The MXene grid not only exhibits an average EMI shielding performance of 21.7 dB but also maintains an optical transmittance of 61%. Crucially, the integration of AgNWs with the conductive MXene grid to configure multi-scale hierarchical films leads to optimized mechanical, electrical, optical, EMI shielding, and joule-heating performances. Attractively, the hierarchical-structure design enables the MXene grid/AgNW film to simultaneously possess a low sheet resistance (Rs) of 17.9 Ω sq−1, a high optical transmittance of 81% at a light wavelength of 550 nm, and an excellent EMI shielding efficiency of 24.6 dB. Thanks to the superior attributes of the MXene grid/AgNW films, the assembled flexible and transparent panels are suitable for transparent heaters and four-wire resistive touch panels, demonstrating their application potentials in the fields of flexible wearable devices and intelligent monitoring systems.
Experimental section
Materials
Commercial aeroxide P25 TiO2 particles were purchased from Shanghai Kayin Chemicals. Ti3AlC2 MAX phase powder (400 mesh) was supplied by Jilin 11 Technology. LiF was purchased from Aladdin Reagents. The isopropyl alcohol suspension of silver nanowires (concentration: 5 mg mL−1) with diameters of ∼30 nm and lengths of ∼20 μm was purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Technol. (China).
Preparation of Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets
Ti3C2Tx sheets were prepared by etching the Al layer away from the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase with the HCl/LiF solution followed by ultrasonic exfoliation.41 Typically, the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase (1 g) was mixed with LiF (1 g) and HCl (9 M, 20 mL) under slow stirring. After the mixture reacted for 24 h at 35 °C, the resultant product was rinsed repeatedly with deionized water and centrifuged at 3500 rpm until neutral pH, ultrasonicated for 1.5 h, and finally centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 1 h, generating exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets.
Fabrication of crack templates
A TiO2 colloidal dispersion was prepared by mixing TiO2 powder (0.6 g) with ethanol dispersant (5 mL) and ethyl acetate (0.8 mL) co-dispersant. After ultrasonic treatment for 20 min, the colloidal dispersions of different dosages were evenly coated on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates with fixed sizes (5 × 5 cm2) that were rinsed with deionized water and ethanol. In an indoor environment with temperatures of 20–25 °C and a relative humidity of 40–60%, the coated colloidal dispersion gradually forms different crack patterns due to the volatilization of the dispersants under the action of capillary force (Fig. S1†).
Preparation of MXene grids and MmAn films
The MXene dispersion was obtained by dispersing MXene in deionized water, while the AgNW dispersion was diluted to 0.1 mg mL−1 with isopropyl alcohol and deionized water. To prepare MXene grids and MmAn films with different loading densities, the MXene dispersion was sprayed onto the crack templates to form MXene grid films with different loading densities. Obviously, after drying the MXene grid films, the dispersion of AgNWs was sprayed onto the MXene grids to construct multi-scale hierarchical MXene grid/AgNW (MmAn) films, where m and n are the loading densities of MXene and AgNWs, respectively. The loading densities of MXene and AgNWs were calculated with eqn (1). Taking the MXene grid-PET film as an example: σM (mg m−2) = (VM × cM)/SPET(1)where σM is the loading density of the MXene grid by considering the crack template as a flat surface; VM and cM are the volume and mass concentrations of the MXene dispersion, respectively. SPET is the area of the PET substrate. The loading densities of the MXene grids were determined to be 326, 1304, 2608, 5216, 6520 and 7824 mg m−2, which were denoted as M326, M1304, M2608, M5216, M6520 and M7824. Accordingly, on the basis of M326 and M6520 films, AgNWs with loading densities of 41, 82 and 164 mg m−2 were sprayed to form two groups of composite films (M326A41, M326A82, M326A164, and M6520A41, M6520A82, M6520A164).
Characterization
The microstructure and morphology of the samples were observed with a Nikon ECLIPSE Ci-POL polarizing microscope, a Hitachi S4700 field-emission SEM equipped with an EDS, and a Tecnai G2 F20 STWIN TEM. XRD patterns were recorded by using a Rigaku D/Max 2500 X-ray diffractometer. The optical transmittance spectra of the films were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Electrical conductivities of films were measured with a 4ProbesTech RTS-8 four-probe tester. EMI shielding performances were recorded on a Keysight N5224BPNA network analyzer in the frequency range of 8.2–12.4 GHz (X-band). The two important scattering parameters were used to calculate the power coefficient and EMI shielding effectiveness by using eqn (2)–(5): R = |S11|2, T = |S21|2(2) A = 1 − R − T(3) SER = −10log|1 − R|, SEA = −10log|T/(1 − R)|(4) SET = SER + SEA(5)where R, T, and A are the reflection, transmission, and absorption coefficients, respectively. SER, SEA and SET are the microwave reflection, microwave absorption and total shielding effectiveness, respectively. The bending test of films was performed using a custom-made Suzhou Controlway stepper motor and a DMM7510 71/2 multi-meter. The films were tailored to specific splines with a fixed gap of 2 mm and mounted on the stepper motor that is connected to a computer. The reciprocating movement frequency of the stepper motor was controlled at 0.5 Hz. The resistance changes were recorded by the multimeter during the reciprocating movement. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded by using a FLIR-H16 spectrometer.
Results and discussion
Fabrication of hierarchical MXene grid/silver nanowire films and their optical, electrical, and EMI shielding performances

Fig. 1a shows the fabrication of MXene grid/AgNW films with a crack-template assisted spraying technology. First, a TiO2 colloidal dispersion is prepared by mixing TiO2 powder with ethanol dispersant and ethyl acetate co-dispersant by agitation and ultrasonication. Second, a certain amount of the TiO2 dispersion is evenly coated on a pre-cleaned PET substrate. During subsequent drying at an ambient temperature, the TiO2 template generates uniform cracks because of the volatilization of the solvents (Fig. S2†). Third, the MXene dispersion is deposited into the cracks by spraying followed by heating to generate a conductive MXene grid pattern (Fig. S3 and S4†). The MXene grid skeleton can be obtained by removing the TiO2 template using ethanol under weak ultrasonic treatment. Finally, the dispersion of AgNWs is sprayed onto the MXene grid skeleton to configure hierarchical MXene grid/AgNW (MmAn) films, where m and n stand for the loading densities of MXene and AgNWs, respectively. Fig. 1b shows the SEM image of the first-order cracks (main cracks) of the crack template and the second-order cracks derived from the first-order cracks, and these cracks play an indispensable role in subsequent deposition of MXene suspensions. The relationship between the crack width and the dosage of the colloidal dispersion is shown in Fig. 1c. When the TiO2 colloidal dosage is less than 25 μL cm−2, the cracks only occur on the surface, and the depth of the cracks is not sufficient for accommodating the MXene dispersion. By increasing the colloidal dispersion dosage, the widths of both the first-order and the second-order cracks increase (Fig. 1c and S5†). When the dosage is more than 25 μL cm−2, the generated crack widths become enough for subsequent accommodation of the deposited MXene sheets. A highly dense conductive skeleton is obtained at a colloidal dispersion dosage of 40 μL cm−2. Additionally, as shown in the XRD patterns (Fig. 1d), the (002) peak of the MXene grid shifts to a higher diffraction angle than that of the vacuum-filtered Ti3C2Tx MXene film, indicating a denser MXene grid structure of the former.

Fig. 1e presents the SEM image of the MXene grid (M1304) derived from the template with a dosage of the TiO2 dispersion of 40 μL cm−2. The widths of the first-order and second-order lines are measured to be approximately 39.4 and 25.0 μm, respectively. The corresponding EDS mapping of the MXene grid (Fig. 1f) shows the distribution of the Ti element, verifying that the MXene sheets are distributed only in the cracks (Fig. S6†). The cross-sectional SEM image of the MXene grid (Fig. 1g) clearly shows the densely packed microstructure and the planar stacking that occurred during layer-by-layer spraying and subsequent heating and evaporation processes. When the loading density of MXene is 6520 mg m−2, the edge height of the MXene grid line can be 613 nm. Finally, the MXene grid deposited on the PET substrate constructs a highly dense conduction skeleton for optical, electrical, and EMI shielding applications.

Fig. 2 shows optical transmittance, electrical resistance, and EMI shielding performances of the MXene grids fabricated using the crack-template assisted spraying method. If light cannot pass through the grid and light scattering and diffraction are not considered, the optical transmittance (T%) of the grid film can be simplified and calculated with eqn (6): (6)where Stotal and Sgrid refer to the total area and the grid area, respectively. When considering the filling factor (FF) of the crack template, eqn (6) can be rewritten as eqn (7): (7)where Scrack is the crack area. As shown in Fig. S7,† when the final dosage of the colloidal dispersion is 40 μL cm−2, the FF value of this crack template is 10.9%, and the theoretical optical transmittance of the MXene grid is calculated to be ∼90%. However, its experimental optical transmittance is smaller than its theoretical value, which is caused by the detachment of the crack pattern from the PET substrate.42 During spraying of the MXene dispersion, the MXene sheets could also go to the interstitial gaps, resulting in the width of the MXene grid being larger than the crack width. On the basis of these SEM images, when the dosage of the TiO2 dispersion is 40 μL cm−2, the calculated first-order crack width of the TiO2 template is 21.3 μm, but the corresponding grid (M1304) width after MXene deposition becomes 39.4 μm.

Fig. 2a and b show plots of optical transmittance and electrical resistance of the MXene grids by increasing the loading density of MXene sheets. By comparing the transmittance and resistance of the MXene grids, the advantages of crack-template assisted spraying technology are obvious for constructing MXene grids. For example, the M326 film has an optical transmittance of 86%, much higher than that of the M7824 film (61%), but the M7824 film has a much lower sheet resistance of 31.4 Ω sq−1. By increasing the loading density of MXene sheets, the optical transmittance of the MXene grids decreases slowly, but its sheet resistance decreases sharply because the conductive MXene sheets are stacked only inside the cracks. Compared with most of the MXene- and graphene-based transparent and conductive films reported so far,26,37–39,43–47 the MXene grid exhibits great advantages in optical transmittance and electrical conductivity (Fig. 2c). A high transparency of the MXene grid is achieved at an MXene loading density of 326 mg m−2 (Fig. 2d).
The transparent and conductive MXene grids exhibit excellent EMI shielding performances in the X-band (Fig. 2e). Obviously, at a low loading density of MXene, although the MXene grid is highly transparent, its EMI shielding efficiency is negligible. The EMI shielding efficiency of the grids increases with the loading density of MXene. When the average EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of the MXene grid reaches 21.7 dB, its optical transmittance becomes 61% at a light wavelength of 550 nm, which is better than those of the MXene- and graphene-based transparent and conductive films reported. At an EMI shielding efficiency of more than 15 dB, the optical transmittance of the MXene grid is superior to that of the conventional MXene film. In addition, with the increase in the loading density of MXene, the EMI shielding efficiency of the MXene grid increases, and the distribution of SER and SEA of the MXene grid indicates an absorption-dominated EMI shielding mechanism (Fig. 2f). The comparison of the EMI shielding performances of the MXene grid with those of self-assembled MXene thin films at different optical transmittances (Fig. 2g) highlights the excellent EMI shielding performances of the MXene grid with a relatively high transparency.39
Construction of hierarchical MXene grid/AgNW structures for optimizing optical, electrical, and EMI shielding performances
On the basis of the conductive MXene grid skeleton, hierarchical structures are constructed by introducing 1D metal nanowires to optimize optical, electrical, and EMI shielding properties.48–50 Though AgNWs have excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical properties,51,52 the contact resistance between them is an issue for their application in the area of transparent and conductive films.31,53 To reduce the contact resistance of AgNWs and improve the optical and electrical properties of the MXene grid, AgNWs with different loading densities are uniformly sprayed onto the MXene grid skeletons by a scalable spray-coating technique. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the AgNWs are uniformly distributed and stacked on the MXene grid (M6520) to form a dense hierarchical film. The corresponding EDS mapping of the MXene grid/AgNW film (inset of Fig. 3a and S6†) also indicates the uniform distribution of AgNWs on the surface of the MXene grid. To minimize damage to the optical transmittance and improve the conductivity, the loading density of MXene is controlled at low loading levels. Fig. 3c and S8† show the comparison of the optical performances of MXene grids and MmAn films. The M326An films exhibit at least 25% higher optical transmittances than M6520An films with similar EMI shielding performances when the loading densities of AgNWs are consistent (Fig. 3). The optical transmittance of M326An films in the visible light range decreases gradually by increasing the AgNW loading density (Fig. 3c). It is interesting that the transmittance at 550 nm drops very slowly on the basis of the MXene grid, while the sheet resistance drops sharply, thereby the MXene grid/AgNW film can achieve both high electrical conductivity and high optical transmittance.

(f) Schematic illustrating EMI shielding mechanisms of the MXene grid/AgNW film. 

Fig. 3d and e show the comparison of the electrical conductivity, optical transmittance, and EMI shielding performances of neat AgNWs and M326An films. It is seen that the MXene grid as a conductive skeleton can reduce the contact resistance of the AgNWs to a certain extent, while the AgNWs wrapped on the skeleton surface can improve the electrical conductivity of the skeleton. For example, the M326A41 film has an improved EMI shielding value of 19.1 dB and a lower sheet resistance of 50.9 Ω sq−1, better than those (13.3 dB & 62.4 Ω sq−1) of the neat AgNW film with a loading density of 41 mg m−2. Remarkably, the EMI SE value can increase to 32.5 dB for the M326A164 film from 23.5 dB for its counterpart (AgNW film). The improved EMI shielding efficiency is attributed to the tight contact of the AgNW layer with the MXene grid, and the reduced contact resistance between the AgNWs by the conductive MXene grid. Besides, by increasing the loading density of AgNWs from 0 to 164 mg m−2, the optical transmittances (λ = 550 nm) of the M326An films decrease slowly from 86% to 72%, while their electrical resistances drop sharply from 6 kΩ sq−1 of the M326 film to 6.7 Ω sq−1 of the M326A164 film. Similarly, the M326A82 film has a higher EMI shielding efficiency of 24.6 dB than the A82 film (18.9 dB), and the former can maintain an optical transmittance of 81%. Obviously, the multiscale hierarchical-structure design is efficient in achieving both high optical transmittance and high electrical conductivity as compared to AgNWs and other materials (Table S1†),54–56 because the MXene grid skeleton provides efficient pathways for charge carrier transport while the AgNWs can connect the skeleton to further enhance the transmittance and electrical conductivity. To analyze the EMI shielding mechanisms of the hierarchical film, Fig. 3f shows the electromagnetic wave propagation in the AgNW layer and the MXene grid layer. When the incident waves reach the air/AgNW layer interface, they are partially reflected or absorbed due to the impedance mismatch at the interface. The transmitted waves can be bounced repeatedly between the AgNW layer and the MXene grid layer, and dissipated by multiple reflections between the layers.11
In addition to the excellent optical, electrical, and EMI shielding performances, satisfactory mechanical and structural stabilities of the transparent and conductive films are also required for flexible electronics and wearable electronic equipment applications.4,16 The traditional transparent and conductive ITO film has limited application because of its brittleness,16,17 whereas the MmAn films exhibit excellent flexibility and mechanical reliability. The film with an initial length of 2 mm can be bent outwards to form a certain arc under the action of an external force (inset of Fig. 4a and Video S1†). Fig. 4a shows the electrical resistance change rates of ITO, AgNWs, the MXene grid, and MmAn films at different bending radii (r). Obviously, brittle ITO has a large resistance change during the bending process, and the smaller the bending radius, the more severe the resistance change. Although the M6520 film can maintain its resistance stability at a bending radius of 5 mm, its resistance begins to increase slowly with a smaller bending radius. On the contrary, M6520A82 and A82 films have no obvious resistance changes at a bending radius of 1.89 mm, and can maintain their excellent electrical conductivities (Fig. 4b). Even within 2000-cycle bending tests at a bending radius of 1.97 mm, the M6520A82 film still maintains its initial performances (Fig. 4c). After 2000-cycle bending, the resistance change rate of the M6520 film is over 600%, whereas those of the M6520A82 and A82 films remain almost unchanged (Fig. 4d).

(c and d) Plots of long-term electrical resistance stabilities of M6520, M6520A82, ITO, and AgNW films after 2000-cycle bending tests at a radius of 1.97 mm. (e and f) Cyclic bending curves with a radius of 1.97 mm over time for the M6520, M6520A82, and AgNW films. 
To demonstrate the electrical resistance reliability of hierarchical MmAn films in a complex environment, Fig. 4e and f show dynamic resistance changes of the M6520, M6520A82, and A82 films. Compared with the MXene grid, the MmAn films exhibit excellent flexibility due to the presence of AgNWs, which ensures the integrity of the conductive paths during the reciprocating motion. Clearly, the presence of the AgNW layer can not only adjust the optical and electrical performances, but also enhance the EMI shielding performance and structural stability of the MXene grid.
Thanks to the excellent structural stability and flexibility, the MmAn films can be used for transparent panels of electro-optical devices and intelligent monitoring systems, such as transparent heaters (Fig. 5).57Fig. 5c shows a flexible and transparent heater with an MmAn transparent panel, where the M326A82 film (5 × 5 cm2) is connected to a DC voltage source with copper/silver wires. The temperature distribution and change of the heater over time are recorded by using an infrared camera. Fig. 5a shows the plots of the temperature of the heater versus time at different applied voltages. At the DC voltages of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 V, the corresponding steady temperatures are 26, 32, 45, 60, and 80 °C, respectively, which satisfies the hyperthermia of the human body at safe voltages.56 The linear fitting of the square of the applied voltage and the saturation temperature is consistent with Joule's law, indicating that the saturation temperature of the heater can be controlled by adjusting the applied voltage (Fig. 5b). To protect the normal operation of the heater, the applied voltage is limited to 5 V. When the voltage is higher than 5 V, the high temperature would cause permanent deformation of the PET substrate and hence damage the conductive networks (Fig. S9†). Moreover, by gradually increasing the voltage from 1 to 5 V with 2 V intervals every 3 min, and then returning the voltage to 1 V, the heater temperatures are recorded and shown in Fig. 5d. Obviously, the heater is sensitive to the applied voltage, and can achieve good electro-thermal outputs. The temperature repeatability of the transparent heater is crucial for its practical application.57 The cycling stability of the heater is demonstrated by repeatedly switching the applied voltage between 3 and 5 V with 3 min intervals (Fig. 5e). During the 72 min cycling tests, the temperature of the heater is highly repeatable and closely dependent on the voltage applied. Fig. 5f shows the digital photo and infrared image of the heater to heat the water in the glass bottle, indicating the potential of the flexible and transparent heater for deicing/defrosting of vehicle-mounted glass windows.

To further verify the performances of the flexible, transparent, and conductive MmAn panel, Fig. 6a shows a four-wire resistive touch panel with an MmAn-PET film and ITO-glass film electrodes. The MmAn-PET film (10 × 8 cm2) has a low sheet resistance of 17.9 Ω sq−1, and a high optical transparency of 81% at a light wavelength of 550 nm, while the ITO-glass film (10 × 8 cm2) serves as a counter electrode with a low sheet resistance of 9 Ω sq−1 and a high optical transparency of >80% at a light wavelength of 550 nm. The upper and lower sides of the MmAn-PET film are connected by two copper/silver contact wires, while the left and right sides of the ITO-glass film are connected by two more contact wires (Fig. 6b). The four contact wires are connected to a commercial USB-interface touch screen controller (Fig. 6c). The operation and control of the computer screen can be achieved on the basis of the pressure sensing principle (Fig. S10†). Upon touching, the MmAn film in the upper layer would come into contact with the ITO film in the lower layer, and the corresponding electrical signal would be sent from the inductor to the processor via the conversion circuit, which would be converted into coordinates on the computer screen, so as to complete the action of clicking and presenting on the screen.

(d) Confirmation by writing the letters “BUCT” on the touch panel.

To demonstrate the four-wire resistive touch panel function based on the MmAn film, we can write letters on the panel and the letters are displayed on the computer via the circuit (Fig. 6d). More details of the process of writing letters on the four-wire resistive touch panel are recorded and shown in Video S2.† Clearly, the transparent heater and the four-wire resistive touch panel demonstrate useful application of the transparent, flexible and conductive MXene grid/AgNW film, and its high EMI shielding effect can prevent the crosstalk of external signals and ensure a stable output of the touch panel.
Conclusions
We develop a crack template-assisted spraying methodology for preparing an MXene grid. The MXene deposited in the cracks is eventually retained to form a complete conductive skeleton, and the transmittance and conductivity of the grid skeleton can be precisely manipulated by controlling the loading density of the MXene. The MXene grid exhibits an average EMI shielding performance of 21.7 dB, which is very rare on MXenes and other graphene transparent conductive films with high optical transmittance. Furthermore, by introducing 1D AgNWs, the MXene grid/AgNW hierarchical structures are constructed and optimized, exhibiting high optical transmittance, high electrical conductivity, excellent EMI shielding efficiency, and superior mechanical stability. The MmAn film can achieve a low sheet resistance of 17.9 Ω sq−1 and a high optical transmittance of 81% at a light wavelength of 550 nm, and an excellent EMI shielding performance of 24.6 dB. Based on the above outstanding attributes, the flexible, conductive and transparent panels manufactured by using the MmAn film can be used for transparent heaters and four-wire resistive touch panels. By the combination of grid-structure preparation and hierarchical-structure design, this work provides a promising strategy for creating novel EMI shielding films with both high optical transmittance and high electrical conductivity.
