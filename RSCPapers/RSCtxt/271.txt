    , Accepted 27th October 2017First published on 27th October 2017AbstractIt is of great significance to design high performance photovoltaic systems for application in excitonic solar cells. Here, we propose a new photovoltaic system based on single layer group-IV monochalcogenides MX (M = Ge, Sn; X = S, Se) via density functional theory combined with the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function (DFT-NEGF) approach. Our results reveal that the proposed MX monolayers are rich in many attractive characteristics, that are, light effective mass, suitable band gaps (1.3–2.5 eV), and small exciton binding energies, which make MX monolayers promising candidates for fabricating advanced appliances of photovoltaic devices. The photoresponse and the photovoltaic performance of MX monolayers are evaluated by means of quantum transport simulations. Under illumination, the MX based systems exhibit high photoresponsivity (Rph = 0.16 A W−1) and external quantum efficiency (EQE = 30.3%) in the visible region. In addition, the investigation of the interfacial properties of GeSe monolayers with contact metals (Al, Cu, Ag, and Au) indicates that there are tunneling barriers and Schottky barriers in the contact of GeSe with Ag and Al, while a Schottky barrier is absent in that of GeSe with Au. Interestingly, both tunneling and Schottky barriers vanish in that of GeSe with Cu due to the strong interactions between GeSe and Cu, which means an ohmic contact forms at the GeSe–Cu interface, leading to the possible high performance of the devices. These results can provide an insight into the design of next-generation solar cell devices.
Introduction
The design of new photovoltaic systems with high performance is in great demand, which can effectively utilize solar energy and thereby meet the fast-growing energy requirements. The photovoltaic systems are typically divided into two groups based on the generation process of electron–hole pairs: the first group is the so-called bulk inorganic semiconductors, such as Si, GaAs, and CdTe, where the long-range Coulomb interactions are missing between the photo-generated electrons and holes. The exciton binding energies of these materials (20.6 meV, 4.2 meV and 24.8 meV respectively)1–3 are less than thermal energy at room temperature (∼26 meV). This kind of system shows great potential in solar energy conversion and optoelectronic technology.4–7 However, for Si-based photovoltaic devices, the indirect band gap and lower mobility (∼1400 cm2 V−1 S−1) of silicon severely weaken their light absorption. And CdTe based devices contain heavy metals, which are toxic to the environment. The other group is based on materials in which the excitons are formed upon illumination. The exciton binding energies in these systems typically surpass thermal energy at room temperature. With the rise of excitonic solar cells (XSCs) perovskite materials in organo-metal trihalide perovskite solar cells exhibit small binding energies (∼50 meV)8 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 22.1%, suggesting powerful potential in making use of solar energy. Unfortunately, current perovskite materials are subject to instability after air exposure at room temperature. Although much effort has been made to overcome such defects,9–12 this fatal drawback makes it challenging to apply them in further practical applications. Consequently, hunting for suitable photovoltaic materials becomes one of the significant scientific issues in the fabrication of high quality solar cell devices.
In XSCs, the main physical processes including light absorption and exciton transport are dominated by the donor materials. A promising donor material should possess several key characteristics;13–15 firstly, a suitable direct band gap (1.2–1.6 eV). And secondly, small exciton binding energy, which is favorable for the separation between photo-generated electrons and holes. Based on density functional theory combined with Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF-DFT), we observe that group-IV monochalcogenide MX (M = Ge, Sn; X = S, Se) monolayer semiconductors are potential donor photovoltaic materials, which have been synthesized successfully in recent experiments.16–21 The structures of these MX monolayers are similar to that of black phosphorus, which belongs to the Pnma space group. In addition, the proposed two-dimensional (2D) MX monolayers show high stability, environmental friendliness, high carrier mobility and excellent optical absorption,22–31 making MX monolayers promising candidates for the next-generation of photovoltaic devices.
In the present work, we explore the performance of photovoltaic devices based on MX monolayers. Our results show that MX monolayers have moderate band gaps in the range of 1.3 eV to 2.5 eV. By the first-principles GW–Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) method, the calculated exciton binding energies are as low as 0.21 eV, suggesting high efficiency in photo-generated electrons and holes separations. The studied MX monolayers exhibit promising optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties within the visible spectrum, especially for MSe monolayers. The calculated photoresponsivity coefficients of MX monolayers are better than those of most of the known monolayers, such as graphene, InSe, and MoS2.32–34 In order to realize practical applications, we further investigate the interface interaction between the GeSe monolayer and metal contacts, i.e. Al, Cu, Ag, and Au, which may play an important role in determining the device performance. The geometry, electronic structure, charge transfer, tunneling and Schottky barriers are studied in detail. Our results reveal that due to the strong interactions between Cu and GeSe, neither tunneling nor Schottky barriers are present at the Cu/GeSe monolayer interface, leading to the high performance of the devices.
Computational methods
The calculations for MX monolayers are carried out based on DFT as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).35 The electron–ion interaction is described by the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method,36 whereas the exchange correlation interactions are handled with the generalized-gradient approximation of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) approach.37 A 450 eV cutoff energy is used for plane wave basis. A 15 × 15 × 1 k-grid is sampled to mesh the Brillouin zone. And 20 Å vacuum perpendicular to the 2D plane is used to avoid the interaction between repeated images. When the energy of two neighboring steps is within 10−5 eV per atom and the Hellmann–Feynman force on each atom is less than 0.02 eV Å−1, the calculations reach the convergent criterion. Due to the underestimation of the band gap based on the PBE level, we adopt a GW approach to obtain more accurate electronic properties of MX monolayers. In one-shot G0W0 calculations, the energy convergent criterion and cutoff energy were 10−8 eV per atom and 100 eV respectively. We acquire the quasi-particle band structures by fitting data with Wannier functions implanted in the Wannier90 package.38 In the process of fitting band structures, we choose the s and p orbits of Ge (Sn) and S (Se) as orbital projections. Based on the G0W0 results, BSE calculation is carried out to obtain electronic absorption properties and exciton binding energies. As for the quantum transport simulations, a model with two probes is built to investigate the photoresponse properties of MX monolayers. Based on NEGF-DFT,39,40 the total Hamiltonian is expressed by the following equation: (1)Ĥ0, Â and  are the self-consistent Hamiltonian of the system, electromagnetic vector potential and momentum of the electrode respectively. The photocurrent is determined as (2)where Γ is the coupling of the scattering region to electrodes and G>(ph) and G<(ph) represent the greater and smaller Green's function including electron–photon interaction.41
Results and discussion
The optimized structures of MX monolayers are shown in Fig. 1, which share the same geometrical configurations with phosphorene. The single-layer MX consists of two sublayers, and each X atom connects with two M atoms locating at different atomic layers as shown in Fig. 1(b). The optimized lattice constants a and b are listed in Table 1, which are in agreement with previous results.42

The band structures of MX monolayers are determined and the results are shown in Fig. 2. We find that GeS, SnS and SnSe monolayers exhibit indirect band gaps where the valence band maximum (VBM) exists in the Γ–X directions, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) sites in the Γ–Y directions. Nevertheless, the GeSe monolayer has a direct band gap. The VBM and CBM locate at the same k-point between Γ and X points. At the PBE level, the calculated band gaps of GeS, SnS, GeSe and SnSe monolayers are 1.60 eV, 1.54 eV, 1.08 eV and 0.94 eV, respectively. It is noted that the band gaps are usually underestimated based on the PBE method. To obtain more accurate band structures, the G0W0 approximation method is employed in this work. As shown in Fig. 2, the bandgaps are increased by about 0.4–0.9 eV as compared with the values at the PBE level. Nevertheless, the dispersion of band structures based on the G0W0 approximation exhibits a similar tendency in both the VBM and CBM as compared with the results at the PBE level.

It is noteworthy that due to the weak screening effect in 2D materials, the excitonic effect plays a significant role in the electronic properties of these monolayer materials. Therefore, it is of great importance to take the electron–hole Coulomb interactions into account when studying the electronic and optoelectronic properties of MX monolayers. As shown in Fig. 3, all calculated corresponding energies of the first absorption peaks are less than the values of G0W0 band gaps. The binding energies of excitons are currently defined as the different values between quasi-particle band gaps and the optical band gaps. For GeS, SnS, GeSe and SnSe monolayers, the smallest optical absorption peak respectively occurs at 2.08, 1.72, 1.20 and 1.14 eV, respectively. Accordingly, the obtained binding energies between electrons and holes are 0.68 eV, 0.52, 0.25 and 0.21 eV. Compared with SiC, GaN, MoS2 monolayers,43 MX monolayers have weaker binding energy of excitons, which means much easier separation of the excited electrons and holes in MX monolayers. We also calculate the effective mass of excitons with the following equation: (3)
 Fig. 3  The optical spectra of monolayer MX based on the G0W0-BSE method. The optical gap is defined as the energy corresponding to the first peak, which is marked as a vertical dotted line. 
From Table 1, we observe that MX monolayers have small effective mass of excitons, especially for MSe monolayers, which are smaller than those of black phosphorene and silicene.44,45 It is interesting that the effective mass of excitons is a positive correlation with its binding energy, which is consistent with semi-classical Mott–Wannier theory. The analysis above manifests that MSe monolayers can serve as outstanding photovoltaic materials.
Since MX monolayers are promising candidates for solar cells, we evaluate their performance as photovoltaic devices. As shown in Fig. 4, a two-probe device is constructed using MX monolayers. The model consists of one central scattering region sandwiched by two semi-infinite electrodes. In order to actuate the photo-generated carriers, an external bias voltage Vds = 0.4 V is applied in two electrodes. Under light with 0.1 W cm−2 power density illumination, the electrons and holes migrate into left and right electrodes along adverse directions which is caused by the external drain-source electrical field. The photoinduced current is therefore generated.

The left pink region represents the electronic source (negative electrode); the right blue region represents the electronic drain (positive electrode); the yellow zone stands for lighting area, and the electron–hole pairs are in the dashed oval. 
From Fig. 5, we can see that MX monolayers exhibit large photocurrents under illumination. For MS monolayers, the photoresponse is within the range of the visible spectrum. Under 0.1 W cm−2 power density illumination, the calculated photocurrent along armchair directions is about 3.0 and 7.0 mA mm−2 for GeS and SnS monolayers respectively. The photocurrents along zigzag directions are a bit smaller as compared with the values along armchair directions. However for the MSe monolayers, the induced photocurrents are about 12.0 and 14.0 mA mm−2. In addition, we can distinctly see that MSe monolayers show a red shift in comparison with MS monolayers as shown in Fig. 5. This interesting phenomenon is attributed to the decreasing band gaps, which agrees well with the previous conclusion based on the BSE calculation.

Vertical and abscissa coordinates are the polarizing angle and energy of photons respectively. The values of photocurrent are calculated at per square millimeter. We define the polarizing angle as θ. 
Furthermore, to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of monolayer MX, other parameters, such as the photoresponse coefficient (Rph) and external quantum efficiency (EQE), are also calculated. The photoresponse coefficients Rph are obtained using the following equation: (4)where Jph is the photocurrent, e and Fph are the electron charge and photon flux which means the number of photons irradiated per unit area of material per unit time. The calculated results are plotted in Fig. 6, and we can also clearly see that these MX monolayers present different photoresponsivities under illumination with different wavelengths. The photoresponsivities are about 0.035 and 0.075 A W−1 for GeS and SnS monolayers at the wavelength of 400–500 nm. While for GeSe and SnSe monolayers, the highest photoresponsivities are about 0.13 and 0.16 A W−1, which are much higher than those of MoS2 based phototransistors (1.6 × 10−2 A W−1) and even 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of graphene based photodetectors (5 × 10−2 A W−1). The EQE is a vital indicator for optoelectronic materials, which can be calculated by (5)where Rph is the photoresponse coefficient and h, c, e and λ are respectively Planck's constant, the velocity of light, elementary charge and wavelength of light. Based on these photoresponsivities, we obtain the values of EQE as 10.27%, 22.01%, 25.43% and 30.32% for GeS, SnS, GeSe and SnSe monolayers. From all aspects of optoelectronic performance, we can conclude that MSe monolayers are more suitable as photovoltaic materials than MS monolayers.

As far as we know, the interfacial properties between metals and semiconductors play significant roles in the performance of solar cells. Here, we take monolayer GeSe as an example to analyze the interfacial properties between monolayer GeSe and common contact metals (e.g. Al, Cu, Ag, and Au), as shown in Fig. 7. The specific details about the contact properties are listed in Table 2. We can clearly see that the distance between monolayer GeSe and metals is in the order of dAu < dCu < dAg < dAl. This indicates that the interaction between monolayer GeSe and metals gradually becomes weakened. These results have been demonstrated by previous studies.46,47

Since interfacial interactions occurred, charge transfers from metals to monolayer GeSe have taken place. In order to further investigate the interaction between monolayer GeSe and metals, the difference charge density and plane averaged charge density are calculated to intuitively see the redistribution of electrons. As is indicated in Fig. 8, the difference charge density is defined asΔρ = ρGeSe/M − ρM − ρGeSe, where ρGeSe/M, ρGeSe and ρM are the charge density of monolayer GeSe/metal, monolayer GeSe and metals respectively. It is noteworthy that charges locate in the interfacial regions, which indicates strong orbital overlapping. Owing to these strong orbital hybridizations, the GeSe monolayer is metalized. The interesting phenomenon can provide a transport channel between semiconductors and metals and a low tunneling barrier, thus improving the injection efficiency of electrons.

The tunneling barrier is an important factor that determines the performance of a semiconductor-metal contact, which is characterized by the tunneling barrier height and width. In this work, we assume a a square potential barrier to replace the real potential barrier. The tunneling probabilities TB are calculated based on following equation (6)
Where m and ℏ are the mass of free electrons and reduced Planck's constant and ΔV and wB are respectively the height and width of the assumed square potential barrier. The calculated TB of these contacts are in the order of TB (Ag) < TB (Al) < TB (Au) < TB (Cu). We note that the tunneling probabilities of the GeSe/Cu contact can reach 100%, which resulted from the stronger interfacial hybridization.
The Schottky barrier between photovoltaic materials and metals is another factor that affects the performance of solar cells. By calculating the energy difference between the Fermi level and original band edges, the Schottky barrier heights (SBH) could be estimated.48 The SBHs are respectively identified to be 0.10 and 0.18 eV for GeSe/Ag and GeSe/Al contacts, while the Schottky barriers vanished for GeSe/Au and GeSe/Cu contacts. Considering the tunneling barriers discussed before, we classify these contacts of monolayer GeSe/metals into three types. In Fig. 9(a), both tunneling and Schottky barriers are existent in the interface of monolayer GeSe/Ag (Al), we called this contact type 1. For the type 2 contact (Fig. 9(b)), we notice that only the tunneling barrier exists. Exhilaratingly, neither the tunneling barrier nor the Schottky barrier is present in the monolayer GeSe/Cu contact, which is named type 3 (Fig. 9(c)). These three different types of contacts are mainly ascribed to the charges transfer from metals to semiconductors. Due to the weak adsorption on Ag and Al surfaces, electronic interactions between monolayer GeSe and metals are accordingly weak, and the interfacial hybridization is not evident as well. While for a Cu contact, both charge transfer and interfacial hybridization are prominent, resulting in an ohmic contact at the Cu–GeSe interface.

Conclusion
In summary, we comprehensively investigated the electronic and optoelectronic properties of MX monolayers by a DFT-NEGF approach. The results reveal that MX monolayers are semiconductors with moderate band gaps (1.3–2.5 eV). In particular, the monolayer GeSe shows a direct band gap (∼1.5 eV), which is favorable for the electron excitation from the VBM to the CBM. The calculated exciton binding energies of MX monolayers are smaller than those of common two-dimensional materials, such as h-BN, SiC and black phosphorous, indicating the high efficiency of photo-excited electron–hole generations. Under illumination, the MX monolayers possess an excellent photoresponse and power conversion efficiency in the range of the visible spectrum. In addition, the calculated photoresponsivity can reach up to 0.16 A W−1, and the corresponding EQE is as high as 30.32%. Hence, we believe that MX monolayers are suitable donor materials for application in XSCs and other photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, we also select GeSe as an example to examine the interfacial properties between monolayer GeSe and contact metals. Three types of contacts between GeSe and metals are proposed according to the strength of hybridization. Due to the strong interaction between monolayer GeSe and Cu, neither tunneling nor Schottky barriers are present at the GeSe–Cu interface. Our results not only propose a series of photovoltaic materials with excellent performance, but also offer theoretical guidance for the design of next-generation solar cells.
