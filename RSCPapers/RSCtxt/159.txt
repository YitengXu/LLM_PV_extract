    , Accepted 21st July 2020First published on 19th August 2020AbstractStrontium titanate, SrTiO3, with the perovskite ABO3 structure is known as one of the most efficient photocatalyst materials for the overall water splitting reaction. Doping with appropriate metal cations at the A site or at the B site substantially increases the quantum yield to split water into H2 and O2. The site occupied by the guest dopant in the SrTiO3 host thus plays a key role in dictating the water splitting activity. However, little is known about the detailed structure of the dopant site in the host lattice. In this study, the local structure of In3+ cations, which were shown to improve the water splitting activity of SrTiO3, is investigated with X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The In3+ cations exclusively substitute for Ti4+ cations at the B site to form InO6 octahedra. Further optical experiments using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and DFT calculations of the density of states indicate that the substitution of In3+ for Ti4+ does not alter the band structure and bandgap energy (remaining at 3.2 eV). The mechanism underlying the increased water splitting activity is discussed in relation to occupation of the B site by In3+ cations.
Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising method to convert unexhausted solar energy into H2.1–4 H2 has been considered a sustainable fuel. It has a specific energy of 142 MJ kg−1, the highest of any practical fuel.3 Unfortunately, the photocatalytic splitting of water into H2 and O2 is an uphill process requiring a large change in the Gibbs free energy, as high as +237 kJ mol−1.2 A suitable catalyst is consequently needed and is the key to substantially increasing the reaction rate.
Strontium titanate, SrTiO3, is a classic, important metal oxide photocatalyst that has been widely studied in the water splitting reaction.5,6 Four decades ago, Domen and coworkers reported the photocatalytic decomposition of water over a SrTiO3 powder loaded with 1.7 wt% NiO cocatalyst.7 The photodecomposition of water occurred steadily during more than 100 h of UV irradiation with a 450 W high-pressure mercury lamp. Since then, a number of studies have been conducted to ultimately confirm that SrTiO3 represents one of the most promising photocatalyst materials for the overall water splitting reaction.
SrTiO3 possesses a bandgap energy of 3.2 eV.5 At room temperature, SrTiO3 exhibits a perovskite ABO3 structure with perfect cubic possessing the space group of the Pmm and a lattice constant of 3.905 Å,6,8 as shown in Fig. 1. The Sr2+ cation is located at the corner of the cube surrounded by 12 O2− anions to form the SrO12 cuboctahedron, while the Ti4+ cation is located at the centrosymmetric position, coordinating 6 O2− anions to form the TiO6 octahedron.

When properly doped with Al3+ cations (and loaded with a sufficient amount of RhCrOx cocatalyst), SrTiO3 exhibits a considerably high apparent quantum yield of 56% in the near UV region at 365 nm.6 Upon further coloading with MoOy, the apparent quantum yield can even reach as high as 69% at 365 nm.5 Al3+ cations are believed to substitute for Ti4+ cations in the B site as lower valence cations to extrinsically introduce oxygen vacancies, thereby inhibiting the formation of Ti3+ defects. As a result, the population of Ti3+ defects decreases. In this scheme, the Ti3+ species is presumed to be detrimental, while the oxygen vacancy is beneficial to the water splitting activity. Recently, an Al-doped SrTiO3 loaded with RhCrOx and CoOOH cocatalysts in the form of photocatalyst sheets was reported to exhibit a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency exceeding 1% at 365 nm,1,9–11 which is astonishingly greater than the efficiency of natural photosynthesis. This photocatalyst system preserves 80% of its initial photoactivity and a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency greater than 0.3% within 1300 h of constant illumination with simulated sunlight at ambient pressure.12 This breakthrough shows promise in achieving the large-scale application of photocatalytic water splitting with SrTiO3 to produce H2 fuel in a real setting. The proposed idea of doping a lower valence cation into the B site of an ABO3 structure for enhancing the photoactivity may also be applicable to perovskite-structured oxides other than SrTiO3.
Ga and In, which are located in group 13 with Al, also show a similar trend of significantly enhancing the water splitting activity of SrTiO3.8,13 Ga3+ cations or In3+ cations are postulated to occupy the B site as lower valence cations. A similar situation has been observed for Na+ in substituting for Sr2+ at the A site of SrTiO3 as a lower valence cation.14 However, the doping of a higher valence cation into SrTiO3 stabilizes the Ti3+ defects without producing oxygen vacancies to diminish the water splitting activity, as observed for La3+ cations substituting for Sr2+ cations at the A site or Ta5+ cations substituting for Ti4+ cations at the B site.8
The site the dopants occupy should be well understood to verify the proposed concept of defect engineering by doping with lower valence cations that subsequently improves the water splitting activity. For this purpose, a number of structural characterization techniques are employed in the present study, with X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) as the primary techniques. When a heavier element is being probed, the electrons are reflected more efficiently to provide good signal-to-noise ratio and reliable local structure information extracted from XAFS data. Therefore, In, which is heavier than Al and Ga, should be an appropriate element to be employed as the dopant to SrTiO3 for XAFS studies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are also performed to cross-correlate the experimental findings.
Methods
Catalyst preparation
Ultrapure water produced from a Millipore filtration system (Direct-Q®) was used in all experiments. In-Doped SrTiO3, which is hereafter referred to as In–STO, was prepared using the solid-state method described in previous reports,8,13 with some minor modifications. SrCO3 (99.9%, Kanto) and rutile-type TiO2 (99.0%, Kanto) were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar. The mixture was suspended in an aqueous solution of In(NO3)3 (99.9%, Wako). The as-formed suspension was then evaporated under constant stirring using a glass rod to complete dryness, followed by calcination at 1100 °C for 20 h. The Sr/Ti molar ratio in the mixture was adjusted to 1, while the In/Ti molar ratios ranged from 0, 1.3%, 2.9%, and 7.1%. Indium-containing residues, if any, were removed using an aqueous solution of HCl (1 mol L−1) for 10 min at room temperature and subsequently with water prior to drying in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The final products were denoted as In–STO (x mol%), where x denotes the concentration of In relative to the Ti concentration. Pristine STO was prepared using an identical protocol in the absence of In(NO3)3.
Characterization
The formation and crystallographic phase of the samples were confirmed using X-ray diffraction (Rigaku, SmartLab). The concentration of In was quantified relative to the Ti concentration with an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (Shimadzu, EDX-720). The particle morphology was assessed using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies, S-4800). Light absorption was examined using ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) with a spectrometer (Jasco, V-570). The surface concentration and oxidation state of elements were confirmed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a spectrometer (ULVAC-PHI, PHI X-tool) with an Al Kα X-ray source. The breathing vibrations in the samples after doping with In were observed using a Raman spectrometer (Jasco, NRS-7100) at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and an excitation power of 60 mW.
Transmission electron microscopy
A transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TITAN3TM G2, 60-300, FEI) was used to investigate the spatial distribution of dopant in bulk crystal. The observation was performed by scanning-TEM mode (STEM) at 300 kV of acceleration voltage and 0.2 nA of screen current. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed with STEM imaging (STEM-EDS) by silicon drift X-ray detector (Super-X, FEI). Spectral imaging data were collected by analytical software (Esprit, Bruker) and reconstructed to elemental mapping.
X-ray absorption measurement
XAFS was used to probe the local environment around In3+ cations. XAFS spectra at the In K-edge were recorded in the AR-NW10A of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan in transmission mode with a Si(311) double crystal monochromator. Meanwhile, XAFS spectra at the Sr K-edge and Ti K-edge were recorded with a Si(111) double crystal monochromator in the BL-12C of the Photon Factory. The ATHENA and ARTEMIS packages15 were employed to process the recorded data and to fit the curves. Commercially procured In2O3 (99.9%, Wako) and SrTiO3 (99.9%, Wako) were used as standard compounds for reference.
Density functional calculations
The plane-wave pseudopotential in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)16 was used to simulate the structural and electronic properties of pristine and doped SrTiO3. Spin polarization was considered during the calculations. A 2 × 2 × 2 supercell with 40 atoms was used in all simulations. One In atom was placed at the A site or at the B site to model the doped SrTiO3, corresponding to an In/Ti molar ratio of 12.5%. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) scheme17 within the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) with a cutoff energy of 550 eV and 8 × 8 × 8 k-mesh based on the Monkhorst–Pack method were used to obtain the converged force of 0.01 eV Å−1 and the energy of 10−6 eV. The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE)18 function was employed with a screening coefficient of 0.2 Å−1 and a mixing coefficient of 0.3 to obtain an accurate bandgap. A reduced 4 × 4 × 4 k-mesh was used to evaluate the electronic properties.
Results and discussion
Bulk properties
X-ray diffractometry was used to evaluate the long-range structures of the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 2, X-ray diffraction confirms the formation of a single perovskite-structured phase of SrTiO3 (JCPDS No. 35-0734).19 Additional phases from unwanted impurities are not observed. The peak position and the relative intensity of the diffraction peaks are identical in the four photocatalyst samples. By comparing the (110) diffraction peaks in the 2θ range of 32–33°, the peak positions monotonically shift towards lower angles after In doping, suggesting the presence of expanded lattices.

The 6-fold ionic radius of the In3+ cation (0.80 Å) is larger yet quite similar to the Ti4+ cation (0.61 Å),20 but is much smaller than the 12-fold ionic radius of the Sr2+ cation (1.44 Å).20 When placed at the A site, the In3+ cation would be energetically unstable, because of the large difference in the ionic radius. Therefore, the In3+ cation should octahedrally substitute for the Ti4+ cation at the B site, and does not cuboctahedrally occupy the A site. Because the 6-fold ionic radius of In3+ cation is larger than the Ti4+ cation, expanded lattices are expected, as is indicated by the gradual shifts in the diffraction peaks to lower angles. If the In3+ cation is located at the A site, a smaller lattice would be observed, which is not the case here. The diffraction peaks are also slightly broader. The broadened peaks do not appear to be due to a decreased particle size, because the particle size remains the same upon In doping (Fig. 3). The broadened diffraction peaks may be due to the uneven In distribution in the particles that induces an inhomogeneous lattice spacing.

Scanning transmission electron micrographs of In–STO (7.1 mol%) are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Irregular particles with a size of approximately 0.5 μm are recognized (Fig. S1A, ESI†). Sr atom columns are observable in a higher magnification image (Fig. S1B, ESI†), indicating a well-crystallized particle without lattice defects or dislocations, even after doping. A set of element maps was then generated to recognize the distribution of In from the bulk to the surface of the particle. As shown in Fig. 4, the principal elements Sr, Ti, and O are uniformly distributed across the particle. On the other hand, In exhibits an inhomogeneous distribution. Although In dopants are mainly incorporated in the bulk region, In-rich portions are still recognized at the surface (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Chemical states of elements at the surface
The particle size and the particle shape remain almost unaltered after In doping, as shown in Fig. 3, indicating a low level of or no In segregation at the surface (Fig. 4). XPS was employed to assess the In concentration at the surface and to provide support to this hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 5, the strontium 3d emission exhibits doublet peaks of 5/2 and 3/2 spin–orbit couplings. The binding energies of the 5/2 state and the 3/2 state are 132.3 and 133.6 eV, respectively, suggesting the presence of the 2+ valence state for Sr cations in SrTiO3.21 The titanium 2p emission shows doublet peaks of 3/2 and 1/2 couplings. The binding energies of the 3/2 state and the 1/2 state are 458.0 and 463.6 eV, suggesting the presence of the 4+ valence state for Ti cations in SrTiO3.21 The oxygen 1s emission peak appearing at approximately 528.6 eV is typical for metal oxides. The peak tail located at approximately 531 eV has been suggested to be due to the contribution of surface hydroxyl groups and surface chemisorbed oxygen.21,22 Furthermore, the In 3d emission peak exhibits well-separated spin–orbit components situated at 443.8 eV (the 5/2 state) and 451.4 eV (the 3/2 state), suggesting the presence of the 3+ oxidation state for In cations.23 The emission features of the principal elements are identical in the four photocatalyst samples. These features are also for the In 3d emission peaks; they appear identical, except their intensities. Based on these findings, the chemical state of the examined elements, including the In dopant, on the surface is insensitive to the concentration.

As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the surface In concentration determined using XPS is always higher than the bulk In concentration determined using EDX. The differences between the surface and bulk concentrations of In are small but finite, indicating a low level of segregation of In species on the surface. The low level of In segregation is consistent with the element maps generated using STEM. In3+ cations are segregated in the In-rich portions of the particle surface (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2, ESI†).
Raman scattering
SrTiO3 with a perfect cubic perovskite structure possesses 12 optical phonon modes in the Raman spectrum.24–26 All phonons are inactive in the first-order Raman scattering mode because they exhibit an odd symmetry with respect to the inversion.24,26 Bulk SrTiO3 exhibits only the second order, or two-phonon, modes.25,26 When the inversion symmetry of the crystal is disrupted, the first-order bands are generated.26Fig. 6 presents the Raman spectra of the four photocatalyst samples. First-order Raman bands are recognized at 725 and 790 cm−1, assignable to phonon modes of LO (Ti–O–Ti bending mode) and LO4 (Ti–O stretching mode), respectively.27 The presences of these first-order modes indicate a loss of the inversion symmetry of the TiO6 octahedron due to partial replacement of B-site cations with nonequivalent foreign cations,28 which is proposed here to be caused by the substitution of Ti4+ cations with In3+ cations. Doping-induced disorder due to broken symmetry as a consequence of metal cation incorporation over the B site in ABO3 sublattices has also been reported earlier.28 Minh and co-workers suggested broken symmetry of the TiO6 octahedron following the Fe3+–Ti4+ cation exchange in SrTi1−xFexO3 to produce first-order Raman bands at around 700 cm−1.28 The newly produced Raman bands are attributed to a vibration with local character. Such a local vibration with inversion symmetry at the Fe3+ center is Raman active. Strong additional Raman bands in the range of 750–800 cm−1 are also recognized in SrTi0.95Mg0.05O3−x29 and CaTi1−xZrxO3,30 which are proposed to be caused by cation exchange at the B site of ABO3 perovskite.

Notably, the 725 cm−1 band (Fig. 6B) and 790 cm−1 band (Fig. 6C) are well-separated from the other bands, enable the quantitative detection of the occupation extent of In3+ cations at the B site by monitoring the band intensity. For quantitative detection, the intensities of these two Raman bands in In–STOs relative to those in STO is plotted as a function of the bulk In concentration. The intensities of the 725 and 790 cm−1 bands increase linearly with the In concentration to indicate their sensitivity to B site occupation by foreign cations.
Local environment around In3+ cations
XAFS is a powerful technique used to elucidate the local structure of metal cations incorporated in a metal oxide host.31–38 The XAFS analysis of In3+ cations embedded in SrTiO3 has not been reported to date. In the present study, XAFS spectra of In–STO samples were recorded at the In K-edge. The possibility that the In-containing residues were unintentionally deposited on the particle surface to contribute to the recorded spectra was excluded here by washing the photocatalyst samples with an aqueous HCl solution.

Fig. 7A shows the In K-edge XAFS oscillations of In–STO samples together with In2O3. XAFS oscillations with good signal-to-noise ratios were acquired, ensuring the reliability of the information extracted from the XAFS data. Notably, the XAFS oscillations of In–STO samples are all identical. The local environment around In3+ cations is hence identical and is insensitive to the In concentration. The signal-to-noise ratio at a k greater than 9 Å−1 increases with the concentration, as expected. Following a Fourier transformation (FT) of the k3-weighted oscillations, radial distribution functions are produced and peak at 1.7, 3.0, and 3.6 Å, as shown in Fig. 7B. The oscillation and radial distribution function of In2O3 are similar to In–STO samples. Thus, the local environment of In3+ cations in In–STO is similar to the local environment in In2O3. In cubic In2O3 with the space group of the Ia, each In3+ cation is coordinated to 6 O2− anions to form the InO6 octahedron. This coordination also probably occurs in In–STO. The near-edge structures at the In K-edge of In–STO samples also show an identical feature, with the white line appearing at 27954 eV (Fig. 7C). The identical spectrum is consistent with the insensitivity of the local environment around In3+ cations to the In concentration, as revealed using XAFS.

The peak recognized at approximately 1.7 Å in In–STO samples is assigned to the In3+ cations occupying the B site. XAFS data were also recorded for SrTiO3 at the Sr K-edge and the Ti K-edge and used as references to help assign the preferential occupation of In3+ cations in the host lattice. In the radial distribution function (Fig. S4, ESI†), the peak representing Sr–O coordination appears at 2.2 Å, while the peak representing Ti–O coordination is recognized at 1.5 Å. In SrTiO3 with the space group of the Pmm, 12 O2− anions of each SrO12 cuboctahedron and 6 O2− anions of each TiO6 octahedron are the nearest neighbors to the Sr2+ cation and the Ti4+ cation, respectively. Based on these facts, the peak appearing at 1.7 Å in In–STO samples should be the In3+ cations located at the center of the octahedron, neighbored by the TiO6 octahedra in the host SrTiO3 lattice. By placing the In3+ cation at the center of the octahedron, an In–O coordination appears at a distance longer than the Ti–O distance in the radial distribution function. The second peak at 3.0 Å and the third peak at 3.6 Å are assigned to the In–Sr coordination and the In–Ti coordination, respectively, based on the assumption that In3+ cations are located in the B site. In addition, the radial distribution function at the In K-edge is similar to that at the Ti K-edge (Fig. S4C, ESI†). Three well-separated peaks appear at more or less the same distances. This finding can be a hint that In3+ and Ti4+ cations are situated in similar octahedral environments. In this scenario, In3+–Ti4+ cation exchange should have occurred.
The curves were fit to confirm the peak assignments. Quantitative information, including the coordination length and coordination number, were obtained following the curve-fitting procedure. Oscillations in the XAFS spectra corresponding to the In–O coordination were isolated and filtered using the Hanning window with k3-weighting and a dk of 2, followed by inverse FT to produce the coordination-related oscillations. Four parameters, which are r (bond length), N (coordination number), dE (threshold energy difference), and σ2 (Debye–Waller factor), are refined to achieve an R-factor (goodness-of-fit) of less than 0.02. The R-factor is a measure of a misfit between the data and theory.15 A sufficiently small R-factor indicates the consistency of the data with the fitting model. In addition to this requirement, a good fit should yield a dE that is not greater than 10 eV or less than −10 eV and a positive value of σ2.15,32 Fits of the second and third peaks are accomplished in the same manner using a Hanning window to filter the peak. The Fourier-filtered and best-fit oscillations over the k range of 3–13 Å−1 are shown in Fig. 8. The radial distribution functions deduced from the best-fit oscillations are also compared with the original distribution in Fig. 8. The best-fitted parameters are presented in Table 1. The Sr–O coordination and the Ti–O coordination in SrTiO3 are also fitted as references. The filtered and best-fitted oscillations are presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Fitting was also performed in the same manner for the two contributions of In2O3: the In–O coordination and the In–In coordination. The fitting results are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Curve-fitting procedures were satisfactorily performed to yield good fits for the examined peaks in all the samples. Almost no residuals in the k space are recognized. Curve-fitting was performed without considering the phase shifts in the electron scattering, and thus, the coordination distance will be longer than the corresponding crystallographic distance by approximately 4.0 Å.

As shown in Table 1, the Debye–Waller factor σ2 for all the coordinations decreases with the In concentration. This finding indicates an increased homogeneity of In3+ cations in the host particle. Furthermore, when the In concentration increases, the coordination number N increases for the In–O coordination and decreases for the In–Ti coordination. These results suggest an increased contribution of In3+ cations at the B site. Additionally, because more Ti4+ cations are replaced with In3+ cations, the contribution of Ti4+ cations is weakened to decrease the intensity of the third peak at 3.6 Å, which is composed of the In–Ti coordination.
Now let us consider the appropriate placement of In3+ cations in the host SrTiO3 lattice. In3+ cations are postulated to substitute for Ti4+ cations and occupy the B site. In SrTiO3 with the cubic Pmm space group, the lengths of the Ti–O, Ti–Sr, and Ti–Ti coordinations are 1.97, 3.41, and 3.95 Å, respectively.39 Meanwhile, the lengths of the Sr–O, Sr–Ti, and Sr–Sr coordinations are 2.79, 3.41, and 3.95 Å, respectively.39 Following structural refinement of the XAFS data, the lengths of the Sr–O coordination and the Ti–O coordination in SrTiO3 are 2.79 and 1.97 Å, respectively, consistent with the crystallographic distances for these coordinations. The refined coordination numbers for the Sr–O coordination and the Ti–O coordination are 12.2 and 5.9, respectively, which are consistent with the theoretical values (NSr–O = 12 and NTi–O = 6). Notably, the In–O coordination length (2.11 Å) of In–STO is more compatible with the Ti–O coordination length (1.97 Å) than with the Sr–O coordination length (2.79 Å) of SrTiO3, indicating that the InO6 octahedra are embedded in the TiO6 octahedra in the SrTiO3 lattice. The embedded InO6 octahedra distort the surrounding TiO6 octahedral sublattices to produce first-order Raman bands at 725 and 790 cm−1 (Fig. 6). Here, the In–O coordination length increases by 0.14 Å relative to the Ti–O coordination length in the lattice of SrTiO3. The weaker attractive electrostatic force of the In3+–O2− ion pairs in the InO6 octahedron than of the Ti4+–O2− pairs in the TiO6 octahedron increases the ion-pair length. The distances of the Sr–Ti and Sr–Sr coordinations in the pristine SrTiO3 are identical to the Ti–Sr and Ti–Ti coordinations. Therefore, they should not be used to determine the site occupied by the In3+ cation in the host lattice. For In2O3 with the cubic Ia space group, the average crystallographic distance of the In–O coordination in the InO6 octahedron is 2.19 Å, while the length of the In–In coordination is 3.41 Å.40 The refined lengths of the In–O coordination and the In–In coordination based on XAFS data are 2.16 and 3.41 Å, respectively, consistent with the crystallographic distances. The length of the In–O coordination in In–STO samples (2.11 Å) is compatible with the In–O coordination in In2O3 (2.16 Å). This finding may provide additional support for the hypothesis that each In3+ cation is coordinated to 6 O2− anions to occupy the B site. As shown in Table 1, the Debye–Waller factor for the In–In coordination in In2O3, which is found to be 0.001 here, seem underestimated. However, the other parameters are reasonably obtained to support the interpretation that In3+ cations are situated in octahedral environments.
One may suggest the simultaneous occupation of the A and B sites by In3+ cations for charge compensation. Various filtering ranges in an r range of 1.1–2.4 Å are adopted, and curves are fit to confirm this hypothesis. No contribution associated with In3+ cations occupying the A site was observed after curve fitting. Thus, no A-site doping is detected using XAFS in In–STO samples. In3+ cations exclusively occupy the B site.
In–STO (with small trivalent In as the dopant) is also compared with La–STO (with large trivalent La as the dopant) to support the proposed ionic radii. La–STO with a La/Ti molar ratio of 2.8 mol% is prepared using solid-state synthesis as described in a previous study using La2O3 (99.99%, Wako) as the dopant source.8 La is chosen as the dopant for comparison because it is a heavy element, enabling a reliable XAFS measurements. The XAFS spectrum of La–STO (2.8 mol%) is recorded and subsequently fitted. Fig. S7A (ESI†) shows the filtered and fitted XAFS oscillations of the three proposed contributions. Fourier transformation of the XAFS oscillations produces a radial distribution function peaking at 2.0, 2.9, and 3.6 Å (Fig. S7B, ESI†). When the first, second, and third peaks are assumed to be the La–O, La–Ti, and La–Sr coordinations, the curves were satisfactorily fitted. Residuals in k space virtually do not exist, ensuring the reliability of the extracted information after the curves were fit. Hence, La3+ cations are confirmed to occupy the A site in La–STO to support the conclusion in the previous report.8
As mentioned above, the Sr–O coordination length in the cuboctahedron of SrTiO3 is 2.79 Å. When La3+ cations are incorporated at the centers of the cuboctahedra, a La–O peak appears at 2.0 Å in the radial distribution function. Upon structural refinement, the La–O coordination length is 2.66 Å. The La–O coordination length is 0.13 Å shorter than the Sr–O coordination length of SrTiO3. The stronger attractive electrostatic force of the La3+–O2− ion pairs in the LaO12 cuboctahedron than the Sr2+–O2− pairs in the SrO12 cuboctahedron decreases the length of the ion pair. In contrast, for In–STO, the In–O coordination length is 0.14 Å longer than the Ti–O coordination as a result of weaker electrostatic force of the In3+–O2− pairs in the InO6 octahedron than the Ti4+–O2− pairs in the TiO6 octahedron that increases the length of the ion pair. Considering all of those findings, La3+ cations conclusively substitute for Sr2+ cations in SrTiO3 and are located at the A site. By selecting In and La as dopants, the occupation mode of the guest dopant in the SrTiO3 host is clearly distinguishable. The small trivalent In and the large trivalent La exhibit different modes of doping. The different doping modes should explain the difference in the photocatalytic activities for the overall water splitting reaction documented in previous reports.8,13
Density functional calculations
Based on the experimental findings, the In3+ cation is proposed to replace the Ti4+ cation at the B site. DFT calculations were performed to confirm the proposed lattice occupancy obtained from the experiments,. Two doping scenarios are evaluated: In at the A site or In at the B site. Simultaneous occupation of the A and B sites is not considered because only one peak attributed to the first coordination of In is present in the radial distribution functions (Fig. 7B) up to an r range of 2.5 Å, suggesting only one mode of occupation either at the A site or at the B site. In the 2 × 2 × 2 supercells, the In/Ti molar ratio is equivalent to 12.5%.

Fig. 9 shows the optimized structures for pristine SrTiO3 (STO), SrTiO3 doped with In at the A site (In(A)–STO), and SrTiO3 doped with In at the B site (In(B)–STO). The calculated bond lengths are presented in Table 2. The Sr–O and Ti–O bond lengths of STO are 2.79 and 1.97 Å, respectively, consistent with the refined lengths obtained using XAFS (Table 1). By placing the In atom at the center of a cuboctahedron to replace Sr atom, the lengths of the Sr–O and Ti–O coordinations remain unaffected. The length of the In(A)–O coordination is calculated to be 2.79 Å, which is identical to the Sr–O coordination. No large lattice distortion appears to occur. When the In atom is placed in the center of an octahedron to substitute for the Ti atom, the Sr–O and Ti–O bond lengths increase to 2.82 and 2.00 Å, respectively. The In(B)–O bond length is calculated to be 2.10 Å, consistent with the value determined using XAFS (2.11 Å). This result confirms the hypothesis that In dopants are incorporated at the B site of the SrTiO3 lattice to partially replace Ti atoms. When placing an In atom at the B site, lattice expansion is recognized (Fig. S8, ESI†), consistent with our XRD observations (Fig. 2).

The density of states (DOS) and projected density of states (PDOS) were determined to confirm the sensitivity of the doping mode to the band structure. The results are shown in Fig. 9. For pristine SrTiO3, the top of the valence band (VB) is dominated by O states. The overlap between Ti and O states at lower energy indicates the covalent bond between Ti and O atoms. The conduction band (CB) is mainly composed of Ti states with a minor contribution of O states. The Sr state only has a small contribution in the whole energy range due to its ionic character. The bandgap energy of pristine SrTiO3 is calculated to be 3.2 eV.
Upon placing an In atom at the A site, the DOS/PDOS shifts towards a lower energy. The intermediate states at the bottom of CB and midgap states at approximately 0.2 eV are created. The newly created states are dominated by In and O states. The bandgap is also narrowed upon an A-site occupation by In atom. When an In atom is placed at the B site, the VB shows a small tail for one spin component, and the CB edge shifts towards a higher energy. The bandgap for this In(B)–STO configuration is calculated to be 3.2 eV, being consistent with the previous calculation.41 It is shown here that the bandgap is preserved in the case of B-site doping. Additionally, In at the A site creates deep midgap states to trap photoexcited electrons, which subsequently should lead to a decreased photocatalytic activity. Experimental findings in a previous report,13 however, shows a considerable increase in the photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3 to split water into H2 and O2 when it is doped with In. Therefore, occupation of the A site by the In3+ cation should not occur here.
Taken together, we confirmed that In3+ cations occupy the B site, but not the A site, in the SrTiO3 lattice. In this scheme, the electronic structure is not substantially altered, according to the DFT calculation. The optical absorption should therefore remain nearly unaltered. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the four photocatalyst samples were recorded to confirm this speculation. The results are shown in Fig. 10. The absorption edge of undoped STO is recognized at 390 nm, corresponding to a bandgap energy of 3.2 eV and consistent with the bandgap energy calculated using DFT. Small shifts of the absorption edges to lower wavelengths are also recognized, suggesting minor alterations of the band structure. This result is consistent with the DFT calculation when assuming that In3+ cations are located at the B site (Fig. 9F).

One question is why doping SrTiO3 with In3+ cation enhances the water splitting activity.13 The occupation of the B site by In3+ cations, which is revealed here, is proposed to be responsible for the enhanced water splitting activity. In SrTiO3, oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ are the major native defects. The former is beneficial, while the latter is detrimental to water splitting activity.8 The density of those defects is controlled by doping the structure with aliovalent metal cations. Doping with a cation having a valence lower than the parent cation increases water splitting activity, while the doping with a higher valence cation decreases water splitting activity.8,12–14 When the In3+ cation is placed at the B site to replace the Ti4+ cation as a lower valence cation, an oxygen vacancy may extrinsically be formed to balance the cationic charge and thus inhibit the formation of Ti3+ (eqn (1)). 2Ti4+ = 2In3+ + O2− vacancy(1)The newly formed oxygen vacancies simultaneously scavenge Ti3+ defects (which otherwise diminish the water splitting activity). Doping SrTiO3 with the In3+ cation to intentionally introduce oxygen vacancies and suppress the formation of Ti3+ represents a simple, convenient method of governing the water splitting activity of SrTiO3. The identification of the roles of oxygen vacancies present in metal-doped SrTiO3 in overall water splitting should be a good topic for further studies.
Reaction rate measurement for the overall water splitting is not performed here. However, based on the earlier study,13 doping In3+ cations is known to be beneficial to appreciably increase the reaction rate of SrTiO3 for the overall water splitting. In the presence of Rh0.3Cr1.7O3 cocatalyst, pristine SrTiO3 cannot evolve H2 and O2 gases. When 1.5 mol% of In3+ cations are doped into SrTiO3, the H2 and O2 evolution rate can reach as high as 3.1 and 6.2 mmol h−1, respectively.
Conclusions
SrTiO3 is doped with In3+ cations through a solid-state method to reproduce the highly photoactive In-doped SrTiO3 reported in previous studies. After In doping, the particle size remains intact, as confirmed by SEM. Element mapping with STEM confirms that the dopants are not uniformly distributed across the host particles. Moreover, XAFS reveals that the In3+ cations occupy the B site of SrTiO3, partially replacing Ti4+ cations. Upon the occupation of the B site by In3+ cations, lattices are expanded and distorted to produce first-order Raman bands at 725 cm−1, corresponding to the Ti–O–Ti bending mode, and at 790 cm−1, corresponding to the Ti–O stretching mode. The intensities of the 725 and 790 cm−1 bands increase linearly with the In concentration, enabling the quantitative detection of the B site occupation. Upon the structural refinement of the XAFS data, the In–O coordination length of In-doped SrTiO3 is 2.11 Å, which very similar to the coordination length (2.10 Å) calculated using DFT. Occupation of the B site by In3+ cations, which is concluded here, is probably the key factor contributing to the increased water splitting activity of In-doped SrTiO3. In this scheme, oxygen vacancies are extrinsically generated to compensate for the charge balance and hence inhibit the formation of Ti3+ defects, which is detrimental to water splitting activity.
