    , Accepted 5th July 2012First published on 6th July 2012AbstractA novel multiple-bandgap multi-terminal vertical-junction (side-illumination) architecture for concentrator solar cells is proposed and simulated, wherein each stacked sub-cell operates at its own maximum power point, without the need for tunnel diodes, current matching, lattice matching, metallization grids or spectrum splitting. Practical implementation is limited to indirect bandgap semiconductors (including Si and Ge), with a dramatic reduction in series resistance such that ultra-efficient operation at irradiance levels of thousands of suns appears tenable – rivalling in principle today's best multi-junction III–V cells.

Broader context
The quest for ultra-efficient photovoltaics (currently exceeding 40% conversion efficiency) has focused on strategies that conflate multiple bandgap materials and optical concentration. The solutions have essentially been deemed the exclusive realm of direct-bandgap III–V semiconductors, monolithically stacked, with the associated constraints of requiring tunnel diodes and current matching among the sub-cells. Here, a new unorthodox strategy is portrayed and simulated, where deploying vertical-junction sub-cells in multiple layers creates the possibility of attaining comparable or even higher efficiencies with indirect bandgap materials (including silicon and germanium). These multiple-bandgap vertical-junction cells offer the possibility of autonomous power conditioning of each material (layer), eliminating the need for tunnel diodes and metallization grids and markedly lowering cell series resistance such that efficiency peaks at irradiance values of several thousand suns, which is noticeably higher than in current state-of-the-art concentrator photovoltaics.

Concentrator photovoltaic technology has been dominated by high-efficiency monolithic two-terminal multi-junction III–V cells (with the sub-cells electrically connected in series, hence requiring current matching and tunnel diodes). There is also the constraint of either lattice-matching the sub-cells or incurring incremental recombination losses. Moreover, operating at flux concentration values of the order of 103 produces non-negligible series resistance losses. Can these seemingly intrinsic limitations be surmounted by different cell architectures, while ensuring peak efficiencies exceeding 40% thereby rivalling today's best commercial multi-junction concentrator cells?1
A multiple-bandgap vertical-junction (MBVJ) architecture is proposed here (Fig. 1). (“Vertical”—sometimes referred to as side illumination—refers to irradiation being basically parallel to the pn junction, along the z-axis in Fig. 1, rather than orthogonal to it as in conventional horizontal-junction cells.) It represents a distinct step beyond the single (one-tier) vertical-junction Si solar cell developed previously,2–7 with a line of individual vertical junctions intrinsically connected in series by their respective vertical ohmic contacts. The bandgaps are chosen for the best utilization of the solar spectrum subject to material and fabrication constraints.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of a 3-tier 6-terminal MBVJ solar cell. The number of tiers/materials is a design variable, and both the width (sub-cell dimension along the x-axis) and depth (sub-cell dimension along the z-axis) of each vertical junction need to be optimized. Characteristic sub-cell dimensions for MBVJ cells analyzed below are indicated along with the need for antireflective coatings and passivation layers between the layers. The drawing is not to scale, magnifying the size of certain elements for conceptual clarity. The zoom illustrates the decoupling between light absorption (parallel to the pn junction) and carrier diffusion (normal to the pn junction). 
The vertical junction substantially decreases series resistance due to the elimination of the contribution from current flow along (rather than across) the emitter, which both increases efficiency and allows it to peak at higher irradiance. To wit, there is an increased photoconductivity in the base of the sub-cell, which in conventional horizontal-junction cells is masked by the large contribution of the emitter to series resistance. Indeed, experiments have shown that the efficiency of vertical-junction Si cells can peak at flux densities of ∼2000 suns (2000 kW m−2).3,7 Furthermore, photon absorption and current flow are decoupled, with carrier collection probability basically being independent of wavelength and depth. The vertical junction also obviates the need for a front contact grid because the photo-generated carriers are collected on the side of a sub-cell rather than on its top and back. Because individual units are inherently connected in series, relatively high voltages can be generated even by a mm scale cell.2–7
The proposed MBVJ solar cell (Fig. 1) comprises multi-tiered vertical pn junctions. The layers are coupled optically by suitable anti-reflective coatings, and are electrically independent because the extraction of photo-generated carriers is accomplished individually from the side of each layer, which can then be operated at its own maximum-power point. This arrangement eliminates the need for tunnel diodes, current (or voltage) matching, lattice matching of the junctions, and front-contact metallization.
The computational results tabulated below were generated with Crosslight APSYS, finite element analysis software allowing the electrical, thermal and optical simulation of compound semiconductor devices.8 The specific junctions were analyzed and their material input parameters are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Evidence for simulation validation was presented in ref. 8. In addition, we used the simulation to successfully reproduce the principal results for the vertical-junction Si concentrator cells modelled in ref. 6.

(Width and depth, respectively, refer to the sub-cell linear dimension along the x and z axes in Fig. 1.) The GaP cell has an n-type base (to take advantage of the relatively long lifetime of holes), and its relatively narrow width is due to low carrier diffusion length.16

The simulation also accounts for internal currents deriving from both the depth of the cell (along the z-axis in Fig. 1) and the inhomogeneous vertical absorption.9 Namely, the finite-element-method software used here solves the basic Poisson and continuity equations for each node, and consequently models the currents due to vertical concentration gradients.
Junction dimensions, candidate materials and feasible production techniques are limited by basic material properties. For example, the short minority carrier diffusion lengths of direct bandgap materials10 mandate that vertical-junction widths do not exceed ∼1 to 2 μm, since electron–hole pairs generated farther from the pn junction than the diffusion lengths are not efficiently collected. This observation was also confirmed by our simulation results, and is reflected in the depth of conventional horizontal-junction III–V cells that are no more than a few μm. The prospect of the order of 103 vertical junctions per mm of active cell width basically eliminates practical feasibility for direct bandgap materials.
In contrast, indirect bandgap materials (e.g., Si, Ge, and GaP) possess (a) absorption coefficients and dark current densities that are about two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding direct bandgap junctions, as well as (b) minority carrier diffusion lengths that are about two orders of magnitude larger.10,11 Hence, their optimal depths and junction widths (Table 2) are both of the order of 101 to 102 μm (based on our simulation results, with the same values for Si having been deduced previously6).
The number of vertical junctions per layer in a 1 mm wide cell could be tractable with current manufacturing methods. Sub-cell dimensions of the order noted in Table 2 are challenging but feasible with existing epitaxial lift-off techniques or mechanical slicing of wafers.12–15 The latter could adopt established technologies, such as diffusion (for the junctions) and vacuum deposition (for the vertical ohmic contacts), followed respectively by the stacking of multiple wafers and orthogonal cutting (similar to procedures described in ref. 2 and 3).
Indirect bandgap candidates, covering the range 0.67–2.26 eV, are summarized in Table 1. Except for Si, Ge and GaP, for which sufficient measurements are available,11,16 published data for the electronic and optical properties of the other materials are sparse (including AlAs, which suffers from instability upon exposure to air, and therefore, is not deemed viable here, despite its bandgap energy being best suited for the top stratum of a 3-layer MBVJ cell, from the materials listed in Table 1).
Hence, the selection of junctions here is not an optimization, but rather the best combination from a narrow range of options. Currently, the sole realistic candidate for the high-energy indirect-bandgap layer appears to be GaP, for which solar cell fabrication has been demonstrated.17 A graph of the bandgap against the lattice constant is included (Fig. 2) for perspective on several indirect bandgap candidates (Ge, Si, GaP, AlAs, AlP) among the familiar III–V alloy direct bandgap photovoltaic junctions.

Fig. 3 presents simulation results for the current density–voltage curves of each layer within 2-tier Si/Ge and 3-tier GaP/Si/Ge MBVJ cells, each 1.2 mm wide (the full cell dimension along the x-axis in Fig. 1) and irradiated uniformly at 1300 suns. Each layer operates at its own maximum-power point.

Fig. 4 shows how cell efficiency depends on irradiance, quantifies the contributions of each stratum in the MBVJ, and underscores the impact of a vertical junction's diminished series resistance by markedly increasing the flux density at which efficiency peaks. (Ensuring adequate light transmission to the bottom layer of the MBVJ precludes both a high-reflectivity back-surface mirror, as well as roughening of the entry surface, in the Si and GaP cells.) Although a comparison with a state-of-the-art (>40% peak efficiency) commercial multi-horizontal-junction concentrator cell is not straightforward, it is also plotted,24 highlighting how series resistance in horizontal-junction mode limits both the maximum efficiency and the flux density at which efficiency peaks.

The range of bandgaps and the near-negligible series resistance in vertical-junction mode yield a simulated peak efficiency exceeding 40% for the 3-layer MBVJ with a broad maximum over flux densities of several thousands suns. (Even the simpler 2-layer Si/Ge MBVJ cell has a simulated peak efficiency approaching 35%.) Adding a fourth junction with a suitable indirect bandgap could, in principle, raise peak efficiency to 50% at flux densities of several thousand suns, but, as noted above, insufficient measurements have been reported to offer responsible evaluations.
The results in Fig. 3 and 4 do not include: (1) absorption within the sub-cells in the ultra-thin vertical ohmic contacts, which should be only ∼1% (relative), with these contacts consuming well below 1% of the active area (the simulation does account for losses associated with the widths of the back surface field and the emitter layers); (2) Fresnel reflections from anti-reflective coatings; (3) scattering losses, which can be maintained negligible; (4) contact resistivities, because they can realistically be maintained as low as 10−5 to 10−7 Ω cm2 for highly doped semiconductor–metal contacts,25,26 with a corresponding simulated efficiency loss of only 0.1–0.5% (relative) at a flux concentration as high as 3000 suns, essentially independent of the number of sub-cells; and (5) surface recombination losses, which can be kept negligible when the front and back surfaces of each sub-cell are passivated, justified by experimentally achieved front surface recombination velocities in horizontal-junction Si and Ge of 2.5 and 20 mm s−1, respectively,27 – values with which the simulated efficiencies are no worse than 1% (relative) below their values with zero recombination velocity. A surface recombination velocity as high as 104 mm s−1 in GaP reduces the efficiency of the 3-tier MBVJ cell by only 1% (relative) at 103 suns. The simulation also accounts for contact recombination losses indicating an efficiency reduction of only ∼1% (relative), for a surface recombination velocity as high as 106 cm s−1 at the two contacts of each of the sub-cells. Altogether, the losses noted above could lead to a reduction of up to ∼5% (relative) in the MBVJ cell efficiencies in Fig. 4.
Uniform illumination along the x-axis in Fig. 1 is crucial because of the serial connection of the horizontal units. Fortunately, a variety of efficient and practical solar concentrators with excellent flux homogenization are available.28 Conversely, the cell should be tolerant to inhomogeneous irradiation along the y-axis in Fig. 1 due to exceptionally low series resistance reflected in part by a broad efficiency peak centered at ultra-high irradiance.
Simulation results show Auger recombination to be negligible over the full range of irradiance considered here (based on measured Auger coefficients for each material). Supporting experimental evidence includes the absence of observable Auger losses in (i) vertical-junction Si cells investigated up to ∼2500 suns,3,6 and (ii) Ge as the lowest-energy sub-cell in 3-junction experiments up to 10000 suns in the more demanding horizontal-junction mode.29
In summary, we have proposed a novel multiple-bandgap vertical-junction solar cell architecture with simulated efficiencies exceeding 40% (peaking at irradiance values above 10000 suns) for 3-layered structures (and up to 35% even for a 2-layered Si/Ge MBVJ cell). They allow a significant decrease in series resistance (hence, simulated efficiency peaks at far higher irradiance values than in horizontal-junction concentrator cells), as well as the elimination of constraints on current and lattice matching between the semiconductors. Moreover, MBVJ cells require no tunnel diodes or metallization grids, and allow each junction to operate at its own maximum-power point. Cell voltages are intrinsically at least an order of magnitude greater than those of conventional concentrator cells. Basic material property considerations constrain feasible devices to indirect bandgap semiconductors.
Aside from a handful of materials, insufficient data are available for indirect bandgap materials to allow extensive analyses of the full range of candidate cell structures. Possible challenges subsume reliable and robust materials and industrial processes for spectrally selective coatings with low optical absorption (between the tiers of sub-cells), and excellent electronic surface passivation. Both light trapping and a back surface mirror for the lowest bandgap layer offer only a rather modest improvement in MBVJ cell efficiency due to the high absorption within the sub-cell depths noted in Table 2.
The proposal and simulated results here are also intended to stimulate exploration and measurements of indirect bandgap photovoltaic materials as candidates for ultra-efficient devices. Our simulation results show that MBVJ cells have the potential to rival—and possibly surpass—the efficiency of today's best multi-junction III–V concentrator cells, as well as the irradiance at which efficiency is maximized.
