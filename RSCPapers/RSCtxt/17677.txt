In comparison with non-bridged analogs, introducing the HT π-bridge between DTPa and BTs significantly reduced the intramolecular charge transfer and consequently affected the absorption spectra, frontier energy levels, and electrochemical and charge transport properties of the resulting ABC polymers. Interestingly, HT π-bridge enlarged the fluorination effect on photovoltaic properties, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased gradually from 1.56% (DTPa-HTBT) to 4.39% (DTPa-HTfBT) and 6.09% (DTPa-HTffBT), significantly different with non-bridged polymers. Most importantly, with the increase in the number of the fluorine atoms on the BT unit, all of the photovoltaic parameters, including PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF, improved gradually, which provides a useful guide for the further design of ABC photovoltaic polymers.
Introduction
Semiconducting polymers are important functional materials for low-cost printed electronic devices, particularly in organic photovoltaics (OPVs), because their solution processability and mechanical flexibility allow solar cells to be manufactured using high-throughput, low-cost processes. The development of both electron-donating and electron-accepting building blocks for the donor–acceptor (D–A)-type polymeric materials has contributed to significant improvements in the photovoltaic performance of OPVs.1,2
Traditionally, symmetric building blocks are predominating for both electron-donating and electron-accepting segments due to the conception that promising photovoltaic polymers should be regioregular. However, from 2009, photovoltaic polymers based on asymmetric 3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (fTT) building blocks have been achieving much attention, and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 10% have been realized, which proved that asymmetric building blocks are also effective to construct promising photovoltaic polymers.3–9 Thus, asymmetric-building-block-containing polymers (abbreviated as ABC polymers) have become a class of important photovoltaic materials. However, due to the limited examples of asymmetric building blocks, particularly for electron-donating units, the relationship between structure and properties of ABC photovoltaic polymers was rarely investigated.
Recently, an asymmetric dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTPa) segment was synthesized and used in polymer solar cells.10–12 The introduction of an electron-rich oxygen atom in DTPa not only realized an asymmetric feature, but also observably increased the electron-donating property. The electron-donating ability of DTPa should be similar to that of the classic dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTP) building block containing a nitrogen atom,13–17 which could improve the absorption ability of final D–A polymers. Thus, DTPa becomes an ideal asymmetric donor to investigate the relationship between structure and properties of ABC polymers. For the acceptor segments, benzothiadiazole (BT) attracts much attention because of its unique electrical and optical characteristics as well as chemical and thermal stabilities.1,2,18–23 More importantly, the symmetry of the BT unit could be readily tuned from symmetric to asymmetric and then to symmetric again by introducing one or two fluorine atoms into the 5- and 6-position of the BT ring. In our previous research, we found that the ABC polymer of PDTPa-fBT, which consists of both asymmetric donor and acceptor building blocks, exhibits special optoelectronic properties in comparison with other polymers. On the other hand, we have also systematically studied the influence of π-bridges on properties of conjugated polymers based on BT and symmetric benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT).24,25 We found that the π-bridge units could significantly influence the molecular architecture, frontier molecular orbital and the optoelectronic properties of the copolymers. However, the effect of π-bridges on the properties of DTPa–BT based ABC polymers is still unclear, particularly for the polymer containing both asymmetric donor and acceptor segments (DTPa-fBT).
Thus, in this study, we designed and synthesized a series of D–π-A polymers based on DTPa donor and BT acceptors, bridged by 3-hexylthiophene (HT), to investigate the effect of π-bridge on properties of the resulting ABC polymers. The fluorination of BT can decrease the energy levels of the corresponding polymers and enhance the intra- and/or intermolecular interactions. The structures and synthetic routes of three ABC polymers are shown in Schemes 1 and 2.

Experimental
Measurements and characterization
The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method. The number-average molecular weights (Mn), weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI, Mw/Mn) were measured on a Waters Breeze 2 system connected to a differential refractometer with polystyrene as the reference standard and tetrahydrofuran as an eluent (at room temperature). Elemental analyses were performed on a Flash EA 1112 analyzer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi UH5300 spectrophotometer. Absorption spectra measurements of the polymer solutions were carried out in chloroform at room temperature. Absorption spectra measurements of the polymer films were carried out on the quartz plates with the polymer films spin-coated from the polymer solutions in chloroform. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a Shanghai Chenhua CHI620 electrochemical workstation with a platinum plate, platinum wire, and Ag/AgCl electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. Polymer thin films were formed by drop-casting polymer solutions in CHCl3 on the working electrode and then drying in air. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the thin films were obtained on a Multimode 8 scanning probe microscope operating in tapping mode.
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with ITO glass as a positive electrode, Ca/Al as a negative electrode, and the blend film of the polymer/PC71BM between them as a photosensitive layer. The ITO glass was precleaned and modified by a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS, which was spin-cast from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution on the ITO substrate. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was about 35 nm. The photosensitive layer was prepared by spin-coating a blend solution of polymer and PC71BM (1:1.5, by weight) in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB), at concentration of 10 mg mL−1 for polymer, on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. Then, the cathode was deposited on the polymer layer by vacuum evaporation under ∼3 × 10−4 Pa. The thickness of the photosensitive layer was ca. 100 nm, measured on an Ambios Tech XP-2 profilometer. The effective area of one cell was ca. 4 mm2. The current–voltage (I versus V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source measure unit. A xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 filter was used as the white-light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2.
Synthesis of the polymers
The syntheses of polymers were carried out using palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling between monomer 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole derivatives (1 eq.) and DTPa-distannyl (1.02 eq.), as shown in Scheme 2. Monomers, Pd2(dba)3 (2.5% in mol), (o-tol)3P (20% in mol) and toluene were added in a reaction vial with a magnetic stirring bar. After being purged by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 24 hours. Then, bromobenzene (5 eq.) was added as end-cappers. After being stirred for another 6 hours, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and then added dropwise to 120 mL of ethanol. The black precipitate was filtered into a Soxhlet funnel and extracted by methanol, hexane, and chloroform successively. The polymers in chloroform solution were further purified by preparative gel permeation chromatography. The product fractions were concentrated and precipitated in ethanol to recover the polymers. After filtration by 0.45 μm nylon filters, the products were dried under vacuum overnight to yield the titled polymer as black solids.

Results and discussion
Optical properties
The absorption spectra of the HT-bridged polymers in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 1. The corresponding DTPa–BTs polymers12 without a HT bridge are also included for comparison. Table 1 summarizes the detailed optical data, including the absorption peak wavelengths (λabs), molar extinction coefficient (ε), absorption edge wavelengths (λonset), and the optical band gap (Eoptg). As can be seen in Fig. 1, DTPa-HTBTs polymers showed typical bimodal absorption in the region from 350 to 900 nm, similar to that of the non-bridged polymers. The first one from about 360 to 500 nm should be assigned to localized π–π* transitions, and the second broader band beyond 500 nm in the long wavelength region corresponds to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor units. Compared to that of corresponding non-bridged DTPa–BTs polymers, the introduction of a HT bridge resulted in significant hypsochromic shifts, and this phenomenon could be attributed to the decrease in conjugation efficiency. Because the conformational energy difference between quinoid and aromatic forms (ΔE) of HT was higher than that of DTPa, the insertion of HT between DTPa and BTs counts against the ICT interaction. As a result, charge transfer interaction between donor and acceptor was insufficient along the polymer chain.

The absorption spectra of DTPa–BTs polymers were blue-shifted after fluorination because of steric hindrance between DTPa and fluorine atoms on the BT unit. In contrast, introducing a HT unit relieved the steric hindrance. As a result, the electronic effect of fluorine was reflected definitely in DTPa-HTBTs polymers. With the increase in the number of fluorine atoms on the BT unit, the absorption spectra of the polymers bathochromically shifted gradually, from PDTPa-HTBT to PDTPa-HTfBT and then to PDTPa-HTffBT. Moreover, the relative intensity of the absorption at short wavelength was decreased, indicating the enhancement of the ICT between DTPa and BTs, due to the increase of the electron-attracting ability of BTs caused by fluorination. In addition, the HT-bridged polymers showed higher extinction coefficient compared to that of corresponding non-bridged polymers.
Compared to that of solutions, the absorption spectra of the DTPa-HTBTs films showed apparent bathochromic shifts (Fig. 2), indicating intermolecular interactions existing in the solid state. However, the amount of red-shift reduced gradually along with the growth of fluorine atoms on the BT unit in the HT-bridged polymers. In other words, intermolecular interactions in solid films decreased with the increase of ICT between DTPa and BTs in the polymer backbone. As discussed above, because of the HT π-bridge, the potential of an interaction between DTPa and BTs has not been realised in the DTPa-HTBTs polymers. In the solid state, aggregation of a molecular chain provides opportunities to develop the latent capacity by intermolecular interactions. As a result, the absorption spectra of the three polymers in the solid film were quite similar, with almost the same absorption peak positions and band gaps, presenting the integrated intra- and intermolecular interaction between DTPa and BTs units.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry was employed to study the electrochemical properties of these DTPa and BTs based conjugated polymers. From the onset oxidation and reduction potentials in the cyclic voltammogram, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels could be readily estimated, which correspond to ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA), respectively. Cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films are shown in Fig. 3. HOMO levels, LUMO levels and electrochemical band gaps (ECVg) of the polymers are calculated and summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 4.

In general, compared to that of PDTPa-BTs, the insertion of a thiophene π-bridge elevated the frontier molecular orbital energy levels of PDTPa-HTBTs polymers. In the non-bridged polymers, the introduction of fluorine atoms on the BT unit significantly decreased the HOMO energy levels of the polymers. However, a thiophene π-bridge weakened the influence of fluorination on frontier energy levels. With the increase in the number of fluorine atoms on the BT unit, the energy levels of the PDTPa-HTBTs were reduced in a stepwise manner. However, the decreasing ranges were only 0.06 and 0.05 eV for LUMO and HOMO energy levels, respectively, from PDTPa-HTBT to PDTPa-HTffBT. The calculated electrochemical band gaps of the polymers coincided well with the optical results.
Theoretical calculation
To investigate the impact of the thiophene bridge on the optoelectronic properties of the conjugated polymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to verify stationary points as stable states for the optimized conformations and single point energies, with a molecular main chain length, n = 1, at the B3LYP/6-311G level of theory in vacuum using the Gaussian 09 program package.26 The final energies were calculated as the sum of single point and zero point energies. In particular, the HOMO and LUMO energy level positions and related electron distributions were calculated. Moreover, all the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups in the calculation to avoid excessive computation demand.
Calculated HOMO and LUMO levels and band gaps (Ecalg) of the DTPa-HTBTs dimers with different sequences are shown in Fig. 5. As can be observed, the sequence of substitution of DTPa on the 2- or 7-position had an insignificant impact on the energy levels of the dimers. In contrast, the fluorine substituents with different positions and amounts have a significant influence on the energy levels of the dimers. It is very interesting that the number of fluorine atoms on the BT unit mainly impact the LUMO energy levels, whereas positions of fluorine substituents primarily affect the HOMO energy levels. With an increase in the number of fluorine atoms on the BT unit, the LUMO energy levels decreased gradually. From the comparison of the energy levels of the DTPa-HTBTs dimers, it can be seen that ortho-fluorination of BT does not significantly influence the HOMO energy levels of the dimers. However, the meta-fluorination of BT markedly decreased the HOMO energy levels of the dimer; this was due to the electronic effects of the halogen substituent on aromatic rings together with the electronegativity of the fluorine atom.
 Fig. 5  Calculated HOMO and LUMO levels and band gaps of the DTPa-HTBTs dimers with different sequences. 
As depicted in wave functions of the frontier molecular orbital of DTPa-HTBTs dimers in Fig. 6, without fluorine substituents, the HOMO was delocalized along the entire conjugated backbone, whereas the LUMO was mostly concentrated on the BT acceptor. These images provided evidence of the formation of well-defined D–A structure and ICT behavior of these dimers (i.e., the HOMO to LUMO transition is a donor to acceptor intramolecular charge transfer). The introduction of fluorine atoms on BT further enhanced the ICT between DTPa and BTs. At the same time, the steric hindrance caused by alkyl thiophene affected long-range conjugation of the bridged polymer chain and consequently resulted in a larger band gap in the HT-bridged polymers. As shown in Fig. 7, the dihedral angles between DTPa and HT units are in the range from 3.5 to 9.4°, which are much larger than that of DTPa and BTs in non-bridged polymers. The increase in torsion angles between repeating units prevents the long-range conjugation along the polymer chains and reduces the maximum effective conjugation length of the polymers. Together with the higher conformational energy difference between quinoid and aromatic forms of HT compared to that of DTPa, the introduction of a HT π-bridge increased the band gap of the DTPa-HTBTs polymers, compared to that of non-bridged polymers, as discussed previously.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the effects of π-bridge and fluorination on the photovoltaic properties of these ABC polymers, bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ PSCs) based on the DTPa-HTBTs polymers were fabricated. Fig. 8 shows the current density-potential characteristics of PSCs based on the blends of polymer:PC71BM under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G). The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and PCE of the PSCs are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen in Fig. 8, for HT-bridged ABC polymers, the PCEs improved gradually with an increase in the number of fluorine atoms on the BT unit, although the symmetry of BTs repeatedly transformed from BT to fBT and then to ffBT. Previously, we have proven the bis-asymmetric building block structure by combining DTPa and BT monofluoride endowed polymer PDTPa-fBT with a complex multichromophore and consequently with optoelectronic properties different from the others.12 However, the introduction of a thiophene bridge weakened the influence of symmetry of building blocks on properties of the polymeric photovoltaic materials. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 9, all the other parameters, including Voc, Jsc, and FF, were improved with an increase in the number of fluorine atoms; this tendency is quite different with the ABC polymers without a conjugated bridge.

For Voc, the thiophene bridge reduced the impact of fluorination on the open-circuit voltage of solar cells based on the DTPa-HTBTs polymers, in accordance with the energy levels. Mono-fluorinated BT based polymers displayed almost the same Voc as non-fluorinated polymers, whereas PDTPa-HTffBT showed only about 0.05 V improvement in Voc, compared to the other two polymers. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased gradually from 1.56% (DTPa-HTBT) to 4.39% (DTPa-HTfBT) and 6.09% (DTPa-HTffBT), mainly due to the improvement of both Jsc and FF. In addition, with the increase of fluorine atoms on BT monomers, the apparent molecular weights increased accordingly, which should be another important factor affecting the photovoltaic properties of the polymers.
The photovoltaic performance of the polymers could be further identified by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices. As shown in Fig. 10, due to the enlarged band gaps, the thiophene-bridged polymer-based solar cells presented inferior photoresponse in the long-wavelength region. In particular, for the non-fluorinated polymers, introducing the HT bridge evidently depressed the photocurrent response in almost the entire spectrum range from about 380 to 1000 nm. As a result, Jsc of DTPa-HTBT based devices was reduced by nearly half, compared to that of DTPa–BT. However, the thiophene bridge increased the EQE values in the wavelength range of 300–770 nm for both DTPa-HTfBT and DTPa-HTffBT based solar cells. It seems that the thiophene bridge improves the photoresponse and consequently enhances Jsc for the fluorinated ABC polymers. Interestingly, in the HT-bridged, fluorinated ABC polymers, photocurrent response of PC71BM (typically from 350 to 550 nm)27 was observably increased, even though its content was reduced (from 67% to 60%), compared to that of non-bridged polymers.
 Fig. 10  EQE spectra of the PSCs based on the polymer:PC71BM blends. 
To further study the performance of the PSC devices, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities in the photosensitive layers were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method using devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au and ITO/TIPD/polymer:PC71BM/Al structure. For unipolar transport in a trap-free semiconductor with an ohmic injecting contact, the SCLC can be approximated by the Mott–Gurney equation:28 (1)where J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer, ε0 is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), μ0 is the charge mobility at zero field, γ is a constant, and L is the thickness of the blended film layer; V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied potential and Vbi is the built-in potential, which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode (in this device structure, Vbi = 0.2 V). Fig. 11 displays the ln(JL3/V2) versus (V/L)0.5 curve for the measurement of the μh and μe of the blends by the SCLC method. The calculated mobilities using eqn (1) are summarized in Table 2.
 Fig. 11  Plots of ln(JL3/V2) versus (V/L)0.5 for the measurement of hole (a) and electron (b) mobility in the polymer:PC71BM blends by the SCLC method. 
As can be observed, in the solar cells based on the HT-bridged polymer, both hole and electron mobilities in active layers were improved in a stepwise manner with the increase of the fluorine atoms on the BT unit. As a result, the FF of the devices was increased accordingly.29,30 In addition to optical properties, the enhancement of charge carrier mobilities should be another important impact on the variation of Jsc. Generally, in the conjugated polymers based on DTPa and BTs, with or without a HT bridge, higher mobilities tended to bring out superior fill factor and short-circuit current. At the same time, the difference between hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe or μe/μh) for the polymer:PC71BM blends decreased with the fluorination, mainly ascribed to an increase in μh. The balance between μh and μe could contribute to the significantly improved Jsc and FF in the devices fabricated with DTPa-HTBTs polymers, from PDTPa-HTBT to PDTPa-HTfBT and PDTPa-HTffBT.
In order to investigate the effect of the HT bridge and fluorination of the polymers on the morphologies and microstructures of the polymer:PC71BM blend films, atom force microscopy (AFM) was employed to analyze active layers of the polymer solar cells. As shown in Fig. 12, PDTPa-HTBT:PC71BM blends displayed very smooth surface with root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 0.40 nm. The introduction of fluorine on BT made the phase separate clearly in PDTPa-HTfBT:PC71BM with increased RMS of 0.66 nm. In PDTPa-HTffBT:PC71BM active layer, the RMS value of AFM topographic images was further increased to 1.09 nm, indicating the increase of aggregation domain size in the blend. The increased domain size of phase separation could be beneficial to charge carrier transport in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers.31 As a result, distinct improvements in both hole mobility and photocurrent of corresponding solar cell devices were achieved. Clearly, the optimized morphology of the blend films corresponds to the superior photovoltaic performance of the PSCs.

Conclusion
We have designed and synthesized three asymmetric-building-block-containing polymers (ABC polymers), based on asymmetric dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTPa) donor and benzothiadiazole (BT) derivatives, bridged by hexylthiophene (HT). HT π-bridge significantly reduced the intramolecular charge transfer and influenced the symmetry of building blocks on optical, electrochemical, and charge transport properties of the polymers. With the increase of fluorine atoms on the BT unit, the maximum absorption of the DTPa based polymer solution hypsochromically shifted gradually, despite the symmetry of BT derivatives changing twice. However, the absorption spectra of the three polymers in the solid film were quite similar, with almost the same absorption peak positions and band gaps. At the same time, the polymers showed very close frontier energy levels. The introduced bridge projected the fluorination effect on the photovoltaic properties of the DTPa-HTBTs polymers. With the increase of the fluorine atoms on the BT unit, all of the solar cell performance parameters, including Voc, Jsc, and FF, as well as charge mobilities, were improved gradually. As a result, PCE of the polymers increased from 1.56% for PDTPa-HTBT to 4.39% for PDTPa-HTfBT and then to 6.09% for PDTPa-HTffBT. More importantly, these results have clearly demonstrated the effect of the π-bridge on optoelectrical and photovoltaic properties of ABC polymers.
