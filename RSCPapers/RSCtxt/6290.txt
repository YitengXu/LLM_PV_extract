    , Accepted 18th May 2021First published on 18th May 2021AbstractGreat efforts have been made to design and fabricate low-cost, high efficiency advanced electrode materials for energy storage devices such as batteries and high-performance supercapacitors. Choosing organic and redox active species that increase the faradaic charge storage of electrode systems has thus become a challenge to increase energy density and conductivity. To this aim, herein, azure A/3D graphene aerogel (Az–GA), and trypan (Try) blue–nickel metal–organic framework (Try–Ni-MOF) nanosheet array redox active electrodes are fabricated via a hydrothermal method and used in an asymmetric supercapattery. Az links to 3D GA via π–π interactions to form an anode. A nickel chloride hexahydrate array combines with Try as a MOF to form a cathode. These redox active materials increase the faradaic charge storage of the system. The as-prepared asymmetric device shows a high specific capacitance of 319 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a specific energy of 66.55 W h kg−1, a specific power of up to 4.45 kW kg−1, and a higher capacity retention of 92.12% after 5000 charge–discharge cycles at 10 A g−1. This device exhibits a broad potential window of 1.60 V and represents a promising strategy toward safe and sustainable energy storage devices.
1. Introduction
The use of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, is of great importance to meet the energy demands of a growing population, as non-renewable energy sources dwindle and the general public gain more knowledge on environmental pollution. One of the most important challenges in the energy storage industry is the design of energy storage devices from sustainable sources that have high energy capacity and high power capability.1 Electrical energy storage technology involves the storage of various forms of energy, including energy storage in electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and batteries.2 Batteries, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which were the topic of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019, present a great breakthrough in science and energy storage technology, and are essential for use in electronics and other technologies. However, there is an increase in demand for alternative improved energy storage technologies due to the poor performance of LIBs, their high cost, the lack of lithium resources, their safety, and relatively low energy levels. In line with the development of materials, electrochemical energy storage technologies now play a more promising role in the global effort to meet sustainable energy supply challenges.3,4 Rechargeable batteries and high energy supercapacitors that have high power capabilities and long cycling lives have been widely investigated.5,6 Hybrid devices, or supercapatteries, have the characteristics of a both a rechargeable battery and supercapacitor combined in one device. Therefore, supercapattery behavior is similar to those of both rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. However, these devices have a large capacitor that operates with more power energy capacity and a supercharger with longer charging/discharging capability than rechargeable batteries.7 The construction of hybrid devices with the aim of effectively increasing the overall cell voltage is a new approach that has been undertaken in recent years. Carbon materials are good materials for use in supercapacitors as they are easy to synthesize, have high temperature resistance, high cross-sections, good conductivity, high chemical stability, and are non-toxic. For this reason, activated carbon materials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), porous carbon, and graphene, have been reported as EDLC electrode materials over the past several years.8 Graphene has attracted a lot of attention due to its unique properties, such as excellent mechanical flexibility, high electrical conductivity and surface area, good thermal stability, and high theoretical capacity (550 F g−1).9 Various two-dimensional (2D) carbon materials, e.g., graphdiyne, graphene, and graphene,10–13 have been successfully synthesized and used in energy storage systems and conversion devices.1 Due to the strong van der Waals interactions between graphene sheets, they are prone to reassemble to form compact aggregates. To overcome this issue, graphene-based hydrogels/aerogels have been prepared that have interconnected 3D frameworks that facilitate rapid ion/electron transfer.9 However, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have a high surface area of more than 7000 m2 g−1 that of activated carbon, potentially allowing them to challenge the dominance of carbon activated electrodes in EDLCs.14 Due to the promotion of charge transfer within the structure of the MOF and the regeneration behavior of the metal cations, these nanostructures have been successfully used as electrode materials in energy storage devices.15 In this study, a new asymmetric supercapattery is constructed using an azure A (Az)/3D graphene aerogel (GA), Az–GA, as an anode and a trypan (Try) blue–nickel MOF (Try–Ni-MOF) nanosheet array as a cathode. Both of the new electrodes were synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal process and electrochemically characterized via cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The Az–GA electrode exhibits good electrochemical performance and high specific capacitance of 716.06 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. In terms of the Try–Ni-MOF electrode, it exhibits a high specific capacitance of 845.43 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF supercapattery constructed from these electrodes shows excellent electrochemical performance, a high specific capacity of 319 F g−1, excellent cycling stability with 92.12% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1, a specific energy of 66.55 W h kg−1, and a specific power of up to 4.45 kW kg−1.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Try (C34H24N6Na4O14S4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrogen chloride (HCl), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), potassium hydroxide (KOH), Ni foam (NF), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and ethanol were purchased from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich. Az (C14H14ClN3S), graphite mesh 325, phosphorus(V) oxide (P2O5), potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), carbon black, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), urea (CO(NH2)2), and nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O) were purchased from Aladdin Co, China. All reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized (DI) water was obtained via secondary distillation in the laboratory and used throughout the experiments.
2.2. Synthesis of Az–GA and fabrication of the Az–GA/NF, GA/NF, and Az/NF electrodes
A modified Hummers' method was used to synthesize graphene oxide (GO).16 To prepare Az–GA via a hydrothermal method, GO (25 mg) was dispersed in water (10 mL) in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. Then, a specific amount of Az chloride was added into the dispersed GO mixture, which was then ultrasonicated for a further 30 min, during which time the color of the mixture changed from light brown to dark blue. Then, urea (500 mg) as a reducing agent was added to the mixture, which was ultrasonicated for around a further 10 min. Next, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 6 h. The Az–GA was suspended on top of the solution, indicating the complete adsorption of azure molecules into the GA structure. The synthesized Az–GA was washed with a large amount of DI water to remove the impurities from the product. Finally, the Az–GA was frozen at −70 °C and dried under vacuum. The same method was used to prepare Pure GA. An Az–GA/NF electrode was made using nickel foam as a current collector with a surface area of 1.0 cm2 and 3 M of KOH as an aqueous electrolyte. The nickel foam was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with 6 M HCl and ethanol for 10 min before use and then washed with DI water several times. The nickel foam was then coated with a slurry containing 85 wt% of Az–GA, 10 wt% of carbon black, 5 wt% of PVDF, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and a small amount of DI water and pressed under 5 MPs for 10 s and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Around 1 mg of Az–GA was deposited on the NF as an anode for an asymmetric supercapattery. GA/NF and Az/NF electrodes were fabricated in a similar way using GA and Az with Ni foam, respectively (Scheme 1).

2.3. Fabrication of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheet and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes
For the preparation of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheets, rectangular conductive substrates of nickel foam (2 cm × 1 cm) were ultrasonically cleaned using 6 M HCl, ethanol, and DI water for 15 min. The Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheets were grown on a nickel foam substrate via a one-step hydrothermal method, using NiCl2·6H2O (1 mmol) and urea (1 mmol) dissolved in DI water (15 mL), which led to the formation of a light green solution. Then, DMF (15 mL) was added to this solution. After 30 min of magnetic stirring, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and then the NF substrate was immersed into the solution and kept there for 6 h at 200 °C. After allowing the solution to cool to 25 °C, the nickel foam substrate containing the synthesized material was removed from the solution and washed with DI water several times. Finally, a Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheet NF electrode was obtained and dried at 60 °C in oven for 24 h. A similar procedure was used to prepare a Try–Ni-MOF/NF nanosheet electrode (Fig. 1). The Try–Ni-MOF was grown on a nickel substrate via a one-step hydrothermal method. Then, NiCl2·6H2O (1 mmol), and urea (1 mmol) were dissolved in DI water (15 mL) and Try (1 mmol) as a linker was dissolved in DMF (15 mL) and added to the former solution under magnetic stirring over 30 min. Then, the resulting dark blue colored solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and NF substrate was immersed into the solution and kept there for 6 h at 200 °C. After cooling to 25 °C, the nickel foam substrate containing the synthesized Try–Ni-MOF material was removed from the solution and washed with DI water several more times. The resulting Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrode was dried at 60 °C in an oven for 24 h and compared with the Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheet Ni foam electrode. Notably, trimesic, and terephthalic acids have been used as linkers in MOF materials.15,17 Here, using Try, there was a significant improvement in the quality of the MOF material. Using Try, the size of the nanoparticles of the MOF decreases, with a subsequent increase in the surface area of the MOF. The amounts of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheets (1 mg) and Try–Ni-MOF (1 mg) on NF were prepared as electrodes for use in an asymmetric supercapattery.

2.4. Instrumentation
UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Model UV-vis spectrophotometer (Optizen 3220U). Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using the KBr disk method, recorded on a Perkin Elmer FT-IRGX spectrometer. Crystallographic data of the samples were obtained using a Philips PW1730 X'Pert Powder X-ray diffractometer equipped with a CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) source operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with a step size of 0.05°. Raman spectra were recorded using a Teksan TakRam N1-541 dispersive Raman spectrometer at awavelength of 532 nm and a laser power in the range of 10–100 mW. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TGA-Q600 analyzer (TA Instruments). The nitrogen (N2) adsorption measurements were performed using BEL PREP VAC II apparatus operated at 77 K. Surface area and pore size distribution measurements were taken using BELSORP MINI II apparatus (at 77 K) from nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. The surface characterization and structural morphology of the samples were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, TESCAN, MIRA III) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, model CM120). Elemental analyses of the samples were conducted using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, TESCAN, MIRA II SAMX detector, France).
2.5. Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were performed using an Auto lab 302 N potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 302N) controlled via Nova, 2.1.2 software. A three-electrode system with a NF substrate incorporating the active materials (Az–GA, GA, Try–Ni-MOF, and Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheets), a saturated calomel electrode, and gold foil were used as working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively, in 3 M KOH as an electrolyte.
EIS measurements of the electrode materials were performed using a Zehnar device in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz at an alternating current sinusoidal signal potential amplitude of 5 mV, and the data was fit to a proposed equivalent circuit using the Zview software.
The specific capacity (C, F g−1) of the electrode was calculated according to the following eqn (1):18,19 C = 2I × ∫Vdt/mV(1)where I is the current recorded during the discharge process, ∫Vdt is the area under the discharge curve, m is the active mass of the electroactive material, and V is the potential window that is operated within during the GCD process.
2.6. Fabrication of the asymmetric supercapattery
To fabricate an asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device cellulosic paper was used as a separator. All components of the device were packaged using pressure and heat, and the electrolyte solution was injected into the package via a syringe. The assembled asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF supercapattery was heat-treated at 40 °C for 24 h in a vacuum furnace to remove any excess moisture. The applied electrode potential window was set to 1.60 V for the cathode and anode of the asymmetric supercapattery according to the results obtained using the three-electrode system. For both the cathode and anode, the optimal mass ratio was calculated at around 1.44, according to the following eqn (2) m+/m− = C− × ΔV−/C+ × ΔV+(2)where ΔV is the potential range (V), C is the specific capacity (F g−1), m is the mass of the working electrode (g), and the positive (+) and negative (−) signs represent the polarity of the electrodes.
The specific energy (E) (W h kg−1) and specific power (P), (W kg−1) were evaluated according to the following eqn (3) and (4) E = I × ∫Vdt/m × 3.6(3) P = E/t × 3600(4)where t is the discharge time and m is the total mass of the material at the electrodes.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Chemical characterization and design considerations
Az as a redox material and 3D GA as a solid EDLC material were added together to prepare Az–GA via a simple hydrothermal method using urea as a reducing agent (Scheme 1). In this reaction the hydrophilic amino groups of Az graft onto the GO nanosheets in the 3D GA via strong non-covalent π–π stacking interactions. Such materials can be used in the fabrication of high-performance supercapacitors. The high-capacitive performance of the Az–GA electrode can be attributed to π interactions, in which the porous structure of sponges such as Az–GA can be used to establish rapid ion transport pathways and the movement of charges across materials as a result of the oxidation/reduction reactions of Az molecules at the GO surface.9 These features lead to the material having excellent long-term cycling stability and power density. The Az–GA/NF electrode was used as an anode in an asymmetric supercapattery and a Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF electrode was fabricated and used as the cathode. However, to enhance the capacity of the cathode, Try was selected as a linker in the synthesis of Try–Ni-MOF (Fig. 1). Try 3,3′-[(3,3′-dimethylbiphenyl-4,4′-diyl)didiazene-2,1-diyl]bis(5-amino-4-hydroxynaphthalene-2,7-disulfonic acid) is an organosulfonate compound that contains two hydrophilic amino and four sulfonate groups that is used as a histological dye and as a carcinogenic agent (Fig. 1, compound 1, 2). Try decomposes into three different intermediate compounds (Fig. 1, compounds 3, 4, and 5).20 The hydroxyl and sulfonate groups of the decomposed Try product 4 (5 amino-3,4-dihydroxynaphthalene-2,7-disulfunic acid), binds to nickel ions (Ni2+) to form a MOF (Fig. 1, compound 6). A MOF is a coordination network made up of metal ions and organic linkers that contains potential cavities in the form of 1D cylindrical channels of ∼2 nm in diameter. Molecules form molecular assemblies exclusively in a finite and specific nanostructure, creating ion transport pathways and a large surface area for charge storage. Such easy access to the active materials of the electrode by electrolyte ions leads to the high power of the system. Finally, an asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device was fabricated using a 3 M KOH electrolyte with a potential window of 1.60 V. This system has the advantages of being cheap and very easy to prepare. Therefore, by intelligently selecting materials, a new strategy is proposed toward energy storage systems that can are effective and efficient in advancing the development of supercapatteries. Before examining the main topic of this study, the active ingredients in the fabrication of the electrode fabrication are described and evidence of the combination of Az with the 3D GA framework is presented, as well as the creation of a porous MOF structure upon the addition of Try.
3.2. Characterization of the materials and spectroscopic studies
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate the interactions between the molecules of the GO nanosheets and Az and the Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheets and Try, respectively. The recorded spectra are displayed in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The maximum absorption for GO is at around 235 nm, which is due to the π → π* transitions of its double bonds CC (Fig. S1a†). A small shoulder peak observed in the range of 300 nm is due to the n → π* transitions of the CO bonds in the GO.21 Az is a phenothiazine derivative that has a positive charge, which leads to it exhibiting two strong absorption bands at 285 and 600 nm. Short-wavelength bands in the region of 285 nm with high molecular absorption coefficients are due to π → π* transitions, characteristic of aryl rings, while the bands in the region of 600 nm can be attributed to n → π* transfer due to the presence of CS+ chromophore groups in Azure A.22 The absorption bands at 275 and 590 nm in the Az/GO spectrum can be attributed to the formation of bonds between Az molecules and the GO surface. As the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the GO structure at the edges and plates are negatively charged and Az is positively charged, strong electrostatic forces arise between GO and Az, adsorbing the Az cationic molecules onto the GO surface. The UV-vis spectrum of Try (Fig. S1b†) shows three major peaks at 235, 318, and 590 nm, where the peak at 590 nm is related to the azo chromophore groups of NN and those at 235 and 318 nm are related to π → π* transitions of CC bonds and the n → π* transitions of CO bonds, respectively. For the Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheets, in its UV-vis spectrum in the range of 250–800 nm, no absorption bands are observed. The spectrum of the Try–Ni-MOF shows two broad, weak absorption bands at 335 and 620–680 nm, corresponding to the n → π* transitions of CO bonds and the azo chromophore groups of NN, respectively. When Try and the Ni3Cl2(OH)4 nanosheets are combined, the bands of both materials shift to positive regions with decreased intensities. Notably, the peak intensity in the region of 318 nm is minimized, which may be due to the fact that the material is oxidized to its lower molecular weight components, with these containing conjugated π bonds, for which the transitions π → π* or n → π* are allowed.23 Also, the weak band that is present in the range of 620–680 nm may indicate that the azo groups are not completely broken during the synthesis of the Try–Ni-MOF. To confirm that the Az remains on the Az–GA and that Try also remains on the Try–Ni-MOF after the hydrothermal synthesis and GCD cycling (500 cycles) at a current density of 10 A g−1, the UV-vis spectra of pure Az, pure Try, Az–GA, and Try–Ni-MOF in 3 M KOH solution were recorded and are displayed in Fig. S2.† As can be seen from these spectra, the azura A (Fig. S2a†) and Try (Fig. S2b†) do not leach out of the Az–GA and Try–Ni-MOF structures after their synthesis and cycling. The FT-IR spectra of pure Az, GA, Try, Ni3Cl2(OH)4, Try–Ni-MOF, and the Az–GA nanocomposite are displayed in Fig. 2. The FT-IR spectrum of the Az–GA nanocomposite (Fig. 2a) is similar to that of Az. Also, strong tensile vibration bands related to the CN are not observed for the amide groups in the range of 1200–1300 cm−1 in the spectrum of Az–GA, which is evidence of the formation of covalent bonds.24 The presence of the bands at 1725 cm−1 in the spectrum of Az–GA indicate that it contains carboxylic acid and carbonyl groups,25 which suggests that the Az is conjugated to the GA surface via π–π* nanocovalent interactions. Also, the partial displacement of the Az bands in the Az–GA spectrum is probably due to the same π network. In the Az spectrum, the bands at 902 and 1320 cm−1 are related to C–S bending vibrations of the heteroaromatic ring and tensile vibrations of the C–N bonds in aromatic amines,26 respectively. The band at 1604 cm−1 corresponds to N–H bending vibrations. The wide band from 2930 to 3200 cm−1 can be attributed to the tensile vibrations of N–H bonds. The bands at 1480 and 1388 cm−1 can be attributed to the vibrations of the aromatic rings of Az. In the case of the FT-IR spectrum of GA, the broad bands in the 1000–1400 cm−1 region can be attributed to COH and C–O vibrations. Also, the tensile vibrations of the CC and CO bonds at 1558 cm−1 are related to the graphitic structure of the GA. The tensile vibrations of the CO groups at 1712 cm−1 are due to the carboxylic acid and carbonyl groups in the GA structure. The wide band at 3440 cm−1 corresponds to the tensile vibrations of O–H bonds.27 In the FT-IR spectrum of Try (Fig. 2b), the band at 1579 cm−1 is related to the NN azo groups in the molecule.28,29 The band at 1492 cm−1 is due to the tensile vibrations of the CC aromatic ring in combination with CN bonds and the bending of methyl groups.22 The band at 1615 cm−1 can be attributed to the tensile vibrations of α,β-unsaturated CO bonds.23 The band at 1336 cm−1 is due to the interaction of carboxylate salts via the carbonyl group. The bands at 1128, 1190, and 1337 cm−1 are attributed to the tensile vibrations of aromatic amine C–N and –SO3–(SO) bonds. The peak at 1042 cm−1 can be attributed to the vibrations of C–O bonds. The wide double band at 674 and 640 cm−1 is related to the aromatic rings in the molecule. The broad band at 3423 cm−1 is related to the tensile vibrations of O–H bonds.20,30 In the Ni3Cl2(OH)4 spectrum, the band at 3488 cm−1 can be attributed to O–H tensile vibrations and indicates the presence of the water in the structure. The bands at 1286 and 1662 cm−1 correspond to aliphatic amine C–N and CO bond vibrations relating to the presence of urea in the sample. The strong band at 639 cm−1 is related to the vibration of hydroxyl groups. The weak band at 483 cm−1 is due to the vibrations of the Ni network in the structure.31,32 In the case of the FT-IR spectrum of the Try–Ni-MOF (Fig. 2b), the broad band at 3428 cm−1 is related to the tensile vibrations of O–H molecules, which indicates that there is water present in its structure.15 The peaks at 1579, 1215, 1494, 1419, 1190, 1615, 640, and 1977 cm−1 in the Try spectrum are not present in the Try–Ni-MOF spectrum, which indicates that the breaking of the respective groups has occurred. Moreover, the absence of the bands at 1579 and 1215 cm−1, which are related to the azo bonds in the Try structure, show that the structure has disintegrated and a new structure has been formed. The bands at 640 and 674 cm−1 in the Try spectrum are in the form of a wide peak at 666 cm−1 in the Try–Ni-MOF spectrum. The strong bands at 1690 and 1453 cm−1 can be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric tensile vibrations of CO and CC bonds.14,33 The aliphatic C–N amine peak at 1190 cm−1 in the Try spectrum is shifted to 1208 cm−1 in the Try–Ni-MOF spectrum, which suggests the formation of carboxylic acids and amines in the Try–Ni-MOF. The strips separating the asymmetric and symmetric tensile states indicate that the Try structure is attached to Ni2+via a two-way ligand state, which indicates that a MOF structure is formed.17,34 These changes in the FT-IR spectra provide clear evidence for the formation of a new structure from the combination of the metal with the new linker. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the GO, GA, Az–GA, Try, Ni3Cl2(OH)4, and Try–Ni-MOF are displayed in Fig. S3.† According to Fig. S3a,† the characteristic peak of GO with high intensity is observed at around a 2θ angle of 11.36°, which indicates the synthesis of GO. This peak is due to the oxygen functional groups in the GO structure. After the hydrothermal process,
the oxygen functional groups in GO are deoxidized and disappear. With the oxidation and reduction of GO to GA, few-layer reduced GO (rGO) nanosheets are formed and a wide peak in the region of 2θ = 24.36° is observed.35,36 After combining the GO with Az and subjecting the mixture to hydrothermal synthesis, the rGO peak shifts to a higher 2θ angle of 26.41° (Fig. S3a†) value with a lower intensity in the pattern of the Az–GA compound. This shift indicates that there is the partial restoration of the graphitic structure of the rGO nanosheets related to the π–π interactions with Az. Also, according to the Bragg equation, the distances between the layers in Az–GA (3.38 Å), GA (3.65 Å), and GO (7.85 Å) were calculated and are compared in Table S1.† The interlayer distance of Az–GA is lower than those of GA and GO. The differences in the distance values between the layers of Az–GA and GA are related to the π–π interactions with both the top and bottom sheets of the GO nanosheets. Moreover, the π–π interactions and attractive forces between the Az and GA sheets are caused by the low interplanar spacing in the Az–GA. The crystal structure and purity of the as-synthesized Ni3Cl2(OH)4 sample was examined by XRD. The characteristic peaks of the as-synthesized Ni3Cl2(OH)4 at 2θ = 12.87°, 25.99°, and 35.88° can be indexed to the (001), (002), and (101) planes of a hexagonal structure,30 indicating that the product is phase pure (Fig. 1b). The XRD pattern of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 is similar to that of Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 (JCPDS no: 22-0752).37,38 The XRD pattern of the Try–Ni-MOF shows that it has a crystalline structure, with prominent peaks at 2θ = 5.56°, 11.58°, 23.70°, 33.02°, 35.81°, and 59.48° that correspond to (011), (001), (002), (100), (101), and (110) planes.15,39 Using the Scherrer equation and from the XRD peaks, the average particle sizes for Ni3Cl2(OH)4 and Try–Ni-MOF were estimated to be 5–11 and 2–5 nm (Fig. 1), respectively. Also, according to the Bragg equation (Table S1†), the interlayer separation in the Try–Ni-MOF was calculated to be around 7.63 Å. Also, the distance between the layers of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 was calculated to be around 6.87 Å. This increase in the d-spacing value in the Try–Ni-MOF indicates the creation of a large and porous surface upon the addition of Try.

FE-SEM and TEM were used to characterize the morphologies of the GO, GA, Az–GA, Ni3Cl2(OH)4, and Try–Ni-MOF. The SEM images of the GO nanosheets show that have a smooth and porous structure with different sized pores (Fig. S4†). During the course of the hydrothermal method, GO is reduced and GA is formed with a porous and 3D sponge-like structure (Fig. 3a). The images of Az–GA are similar to those of GA, with slightly more compaction (Fig. 3b). Compared to GA, the distance between the graphene sheets is reduced in Az–GA and the porous structure and facilitating of ions and electrons through these pores are improved. In energy storage systems, the purpose of using activated carbon materials is to increase the surface area. Thus, by adding Az to the GA matrix, this aim is achieved and the process of storage capacity can be further facilitated. The high-magnification TEM images of the GA and Az–GA nanocomposite show the porous structure of the multilayer and the presence of Az particles in the structure (Fig. 3c and d). The mapping of the AZ–GA sample is shown in Fig. 3e.

The FE-SEM and TEM images of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 and the Try–Ni-MOF are displayed in Fig. 4. The FE-SEM images of flower-like Ni3Cl2(OH)4 show that the nanosheets exhibit an intertwined structure on the surface of the nickel foam (Fig. 4a). The images of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 suggest that bonding may have occurred between the nanosheets. It can be seen that these structures offer a variety of functions, such as a high number of activated sites, porous channels for easy ionic transfer, and good mechanical stability.37 During the hydrothermal process and after the addition of Try, the porous Try–Ni-MOF is formed with a ball-like microstructure (Fig. 4c). The Try–Ni-MOF has strong bonds between its nanosheets, and hollow spherical particles with different diameters and pores, thus increasing its electrochemical availability to the OH ions in the electrolyte and accelerating the ion transfer rate. It is believed that the structure of the Try–Ni-MOF is ideal for energy storage. The TEM images of the Ni3Cl2(OH)4 and Try–Ni-MOF (Fig. 4b and d) clearly show high surface area (Fig. 4b and d). Using the BET and BJH methods, the pore size distributions and surface areas of GA, Az–GA, Ni3Cl2(OH)4, and the Try–Ni-MOF were examined. According to the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Fig. S5a†), GA and Az–GA show type IV isotherms with H1 hysteresis loops according to the IUPAC standard, which indicates that the relationship between the sample surface area and adsorption is relatively strong, with mesoporous porosity. For GA and Az–GA, BET specific surface areas (SSAs) of 103.35 and 128.22 m2 g−1 were obtained, respectively. The net GA surface area is lower than that of the Az–GA nanocomposite. The high level of Az–GA compared with that of GA could be related to the interlayer spacing of the graphene sheets being occupied by some Az molecules. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 and the Try–Ni-MOF are displayed in Fig. S5b.† For Ni3Cl2(OH)4 and the Try–Ni-MOF, BET SSAs of 31.74 and 97.74 m2 g−1 were obtained, respectively. Compared to Ni3Cl2(OH)4 and after the use of Try, the BET SSA of Try–Ni-MOF increased by around three times. From the BJH distribution curves (Fig. S5a† and 5b, inset), pore size distributions of ∼2–5 and ∼1–2 nm were obtained for Az–GA and the Try–Ni-MOF, respectively. The pore distributions and improvement in the SSAs of Az–GA and the Try–Ni-MOF are in good agreement with the SEM and TEM results. Materials with layered structures are likely to have higher SSAs, which is very important for energy storage technologies. The relatively high SSAs and pore size distributions of Az–GA and the Try–Ni-MOF as a result of their increased electrode/electrolyte interfaces can provide more electrochemical reaction sites, which are expected to enhance the electrochemical performances and therefore the capacitive properties of the electroactive materials. The EDS and mapping images of GO, Az–GA, Ni3Cl2(OH)4, and the Try–Ni-MOF samples are shown in Fig S6 and S7.† As can be seen in the Az–GA data (Fig. S6b†), the sharp decrease in the intensity of the oxygen peak compared to that of carbon indicates that the hydrothermal synthesis was successful and indicates a decrease in the amount of GO (Fig. S6a†). The presence of sulfur and nitrogen peaks for the nanocomposite also show the presence of Az. The EDS elemental results for Ni3Cl2(OH)4 and the Try–Ni-MOF show the uniform dispersion of Ni, O, C, N, and S in the compounds (Fig. S7†).

The Raman spectra of GO, GA, Az–GA, the Try–Ni-MOF, and Ni3Cl2(OH)4 are displayed in Fig. S8.† Raman spectroscopy is often used to determine the structures of carbon-based materials, especially to detect orderly and irregular crystal structures. The Raman spectra of GO, GA, and Az–GA (Fig. S8a†) reveal two important carbon bands (labeled D and G) related to the defects in the graphite lattice grid structure and vibration of the sp2 bonded carbon.40 The ratio of the D to G peak intensities indicates the degree of defects and the degree of the microstructural differences in graphene. If the value of this ratio is less than that of GO, this means that the defects inside GO are filled by an added substance, but if this ratio is higher, it means that the number of structural defects has increased. As shown in Fig. S8a,† after adding Az to GO, the number of defects in the structure increased according to the ID/IG ratio, with more defects and edges present in the resulting structure. However, the ID/IG ratio is less than that of GA, which could be due to the π-conjugated structure of Az–GA, which partially covers the defects in the graphene nanosheets.15,40,41 In the Raman spectrum of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 (Fig. S8b†), the peaks at 1281 and 1625 cm−1 can be attributed to carbonyl and C–N groups present in the urea that exists on the sample. The strong band at 448 cm−1 is due to the vibrations of the Ni network in the structure. The band at 3635 cm−1 is attributed to the vibration of OH groups. In the Raman spectrum of the Try–Ni-MOF (Fig. S8b†), the observed bands at 490 and 1209 cm−1 are related to the vibrations of the Ni network and C–N bonds, respectively. The bands related to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of coordinated –CO and –SO bonds are observed at 1402 and 1565 cm−1. These bands indicate that the –CO and –SO bonds in the Try-related compound 4 (Fig. 1) are coordinated to Ni2+ ions.15,42
TGA analysis of the samples was carried out and the thermal properties of GO, GA, Az–GA, the Try–Ni-MOF, and Ni3Cl2(OH)4 are displayed in Fig. S9.† GO shows severe weight loss between 150 and 250 °C, which is due to the loss of oxygen-containing groups from its structure. A slight weight loss observed in the range of 50–150 °C may be related to the loss of water molecules from the GO structure.40,43 Due to the hydrothermal synthesis used to prepare them and their reduction with urea, GA and Az–GA have fewer oxygen groups in their structure than GO and therefore do not show any significant mass reduction in the range of 150–250 °C. As shown in Fig. S9a,† Az–GA shows a gradual weight loss in the temperature range of 250–400 °C, before that of the GA sample. This is related to the slow decomposition of Az molecules that are adsorbed onto the rGO nanosheets. The TGA curves of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 and the Try–Ni-MOF (Fig. S9b†) show two different weight loss steps for Ni3Cl2(OH)4 and three different weight loss steps for the Try–Ni-MOF. For Ni3Cl2(OH)4, in the first step and in the range of 50–300 °C, a fraction of the sample mass was lost due to the physical adsorption of species/water in the sample. The second weight loss percentage in the higher temperature zone of 300–800 °C can be attributed to the chemical transformation of nickel hydroxide to nickel oxide and species removal. In the case of the Try–Ni-MOF, in the first stage, the loss of water molecules in the range of 30–100 °C is observed. The second sudden weight loss from 150–350 °C is due to the loss of coordinated water molecules from the nickel(II)-based MOF, indicating a change in the coordination of the metal from 6 to 4, and the decomposition of the organic framework. The third weight loss is observed in the temperature range from 350–800 °C, which can be attributed to the complete decomposition of the organic structure.15,44–47
3.3. Electrochemical studies in a three-electrode systems
The energy storage of the two prepared electrodes Az–GA/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF in a three-electrode cell were studied. The CV, GCD, and EIS methods were carried out in 3 M KOH as an electrolyte. The CV result show that Az–GA/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF are suitable materials for use as negative and positive supercapattery electrodes, respectively. The applications of both electrodes in terms of their energy storage performances were investigated and are reported as follows.

3.3.1. Application of Az–GA/NF as an anode. 
The CVs of the Ni foam substrate, Az/NF, GA/NF, and Az–GA/NF electrodes at a constant scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and at various scan rates in the range of 1–100 mV s−1 for Az–GA/NF in a three-electrode cell setup in aqueous 3 M KOH electrolyte are compared and displayed in Fig. 5. From the CV curves (Fig. 5a) and eqn (1), the specific capacitances of the NF substrate, Az, GA, and Az–GA electrodes were calculated to be 66.04, 148.45, 260.36, and 439.04 F g−1, respectively. The capacity of Az–GA is significantly higher than that of GA, which may be due to the strong synergistic effect between the combining of Az with GO. The CV of the NF substrate shows that the capacity of this electrode is low and thus it does not contribute toward the capacitance. The redox peak of Az–GA is related to the oxidation and reduction of azure A, according to the suggested mechanism shown in Fig. S10.†48,49 The weak anodic and cathodic peaks at −0.44 and −0.55 V are due to the oxidation of Az. These peaks shift to broad peaks at −0.56 and −0.94 V for Az–GA at a higher current density, as shown in Fig. 5a. The redox behavior of Az–GA/NF indicates that the electrode is suitable for use in redox supercapacitors. Upon increasing the scan rate (Fig. 5b), a large potential difference (ΔEp) between the redox peaks was observed. Also, the intensity of the peak current increased, which indicates the rapid reaction kinetics and greater storage capacity of the active ingredients used in the electrode composition. This process can be attributed to the addition of Az and its combination with the 3D structure of GA, which increases the surface area of the electrode and facilitates the rapid transfer of ions. In addition, the CVs show that Az–GA/NF has good capacitive behavior. To show the effect that Az has on the capacity of the Az–GA/NF electrode, Az–GA nanocomposites with different weight ratios of Az were prepared (Fig. S11†), and a comparative study was performed. The GO amount was 25.0 mg and the Az values were 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0 and 25.0 mg, respectively. According to the CVs and changes in the specific capacitances (Fig. S11a†), the ratio of Az to GO (15.0 mg/25.0 mg) was optimized at 0.6 wt%. The capacitance of the Az–GA/NF electrode decreased upon further mixing of Az into the GO (Fig. S11b†), due to a decrease in the interlayer distance of the GA sheets or blockage or its pores.

3.3.2. Application of Try–Ni-MOF/NF as a cathode. 
The CVs of the Try–Ni-MOF/NF, Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF, Try/NF, and Ni foam substrate at a constant scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and various scan rates in the range of 1–100 mV s−1 for Try–Ni-MOF/NF in a three-electrode cell setup in aqueous 3 M KOH electrolyte are compared and displayed in Fig. 6. As can be seen from the CVs (Fig. 6a), the specific capacities of the NF substrate, Try, Ni3Cl2(OH)4, and Try–Ni-MOF electrodes were calculated to be 70.33, 144.64, 153.44, and 909.98 F g−1, respectively. There is a significant difference in the capacity of Try–Ni-MOF compared to that of Ni3Cl2(OH)4 upon adding Try to the composition, which can be attributed to an increase in surface area, the creation of a new structure with porous sites and large pores for the rapid transfer of ions, and the penetration of the electrolyte into the structure of the Try–Ni-MOF. The redox peak for the Try–Ni-MOF indicates that the material exhibits pseudocapacitive or battery-like behavior related to the reversible intercalation and de-intercalation of OH ions.1,50–52 Upon increasing the scan rate from 1 to 100 mV s−1 for Try–Ni-MOF/NF, increases in its current densities were observed (Fig. 6b). The same results were observed for Ni3Cl2(OH)4 at various scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1 (Fig. S12†). However, the current densities for Ni3Cl2(OH)4 are lower than those of the Try–Ni-MOF. Notably, the CVs show that Try–Ni-MOF/NF has good faradaic behavior compared to that of Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF, which is due to the increase in its number of pores and surface created facilitate electrolyte contact for electrochemical reactions (Fig. 4c). The optimization of the amount of Try in the Try–Ni-MOF was investigated using various weight ratios (Fig. S13†) of NiCl2·6H2O to Try. The NiCl2·6H2O amount was 1.0 mmol and the Try values were 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 mmol, respectively. In terms of the CVs and changes in the specific capacitances (Fig. S13a†), a 1:1 ratio of NiCl2·6H2O to Try was selected for synthesizing the Try–Ni-MOF.

3.3.3. Charge storage mechanisms of the Az–GA/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes. 
The charge storage mechanisms of the Az–GA and Try–Ni-MOF electrodes were investigated by recording CV curves at various scan rates. Fig. 5c, d, and 6c, d show the log iaversus log ν plots of the Az–GA and Try–Ni-MOF electrodes. The voltammetric responses of the electrodes were calculated according to equation I = aνb and the slope of anodic peak (b),53 in which I is the current (A), ν is the scan rate (V s−1), and a and b are arbitrary coefficients obtained from the CV plots (Fig. 5b and 6b). According to the b value, when b = 0.5, the current is controlled by a diffusion limit, whereas for b = 1, the current is capacitive. Therefore, the b value of 0.94 (Fig. 5c) for the Az–GA electrode indicates the capacitive nature of its charge transfer processes, whereas the b value of 0.47 for the Try–Ni-MOF electrode (Fig. 6c) indicates its battery-like properties. Moreover, the capacitive contribution and diffusion control in the total current were calculated according to the equation I(V) = k1ν + k2ν1/2 (the Donn method),53–55 where I is the current measured at a fixed potential (V), and k1ν and k2ν represent capacitive and diffusion control, respectively. At the lowest scan rate of 10 mV s−1, the ratio of the capacitive current to the total charge for Az–GA is 88.48% and for Try–Ni-MOF is 24.72% (Fig. 5d and 6d). This indicates that the Az–GA/NF electrode has high rate capability and the Try–Ni-MOF/NF is a diffusion limited or battery-type electrode. The deconvoluted contribution from capacitive Az–GA/NF and diffusion controlled Try–Ni-MOF/NF were confirmed by Trasatti analysis.54,55 The voltammetric charge (c) versus the scan rate (ν−1/2) and 1/c(ν) versus ν1/2 plots of the Az–GA/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes (Fig. 5b and 6b, at the lowest scan rate of 10 mV s−1) are shown in Fig. S14.† Using the Trasatti analysis method, the voltammetry charge was obtained via the integration of the area under the CVs (Fig. 5b and 6b) using the equation c(ν) = ccapacitive + α(ν−1/2) and 1/c(ν) = 1/ctotal+ α(ν1/2), where capacitive is the capacitive charge, αν−1/2 is the charge storage associated with semi-infinite diffusion, α is a constant, and ctotal is the total amount of charge. From the plots shown in Fig. S14,† the ccapacitive and ctotal values can be calculated from the c(ν) versus ν−1/2 and 1/c(ν) versus ν1/2 plots via the extrapolation of the trend lines of c(ν) to ν = ∞ and 1/c(ν) to ν = 0, respectively. The ccapacitive and ctotal values of the Az–GA/NF electrode (Fig. S14a and S14b†) were estimated as 493.15 and 613.49 F g−1, respectively, whereas for theTry–Ni-MOF/NF electrode (Fig. S14c and S14d†), the ccapacitive and ctotal values were estimated as 446.63 and 1886.79 F g−1, respectively. Using the relationship ctotal = ccapacitive + cdiffusion, the cdiffusion values of the Az–GA/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes were calculated as 120.34 and 1440.16 F g−1, respectively. The capacitive/ctotal values for the Az–GA/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes are 80.38% and 23.67%, which indicates the good agreement between the results obtained using the Trasatti and Donn methods.


3.3.4. Electrochemical performances of the Az–GA/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes. 
To evaluate the capacitive and velocity performances of Az–GA/NF, GA/NF, Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF, and Try–Ni-MOF/NF, GCD curves and EIS measurements were recorded. The GCD curves of the Az–GA/NF, Try–Ni-MOF/NF, Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF, and GA/NF electrodes at different current densities from 1 to 20 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 7a, d, S15a, and S15d,† respectively. In the case of the Az–GA/NF electrode (Fig. 7a), its specific capacity at a current density of 1 A g−1 was calculated to be 716.06 F g−1, which is higher than that of the GA/NF electrode (Fig. S15a,† 442.97 F g−1). This higher capacity is due to the presence of Az, which creates a porous spongy structure in the Az–GA nanocomposite via π–π interactions. The Az–GA structurefeatures ion transfer pathways and offers improved surface access to electrically active species, which facilitates the transfer of ions throughout the material. The Az–GA/NF electrode shows a low IR drop in its charge and discharge process. This is due to the GA in the nanocomposite structure at full flow density, resulting in good electrical conductivity and low internal resistance of the material, making it a good material for use in supercapacitors. The relationship between the specific capacitances and current densities of the GA/NF (25% retention) and Az–GA/NF (24% retention) electrodes are shown in Fig. 7b. Also, to investigate the long-term cycling stability of the electrodes, the GCD curves at a current density of 10 A g−1 were recorded, showing initial capacity retentions of 94.39% (GA/NF) and 91.64% (Az–GA/NF) for the materials after 5000 cycles, as shown in Fig. S15b.† The electrochemical performances of the Az–GA electrode with other anode electrode reported literatures are compared and displayed in Table S2.† The GCD curves of the Try–Ni-MOF/NF (Fig. 7d) electrode at different current densities from 1 to 20 A g−1 and during the discharge process show the flat plateau of the oxidation and reduction reactions of the nickel metal in the structure, as well as OH intercalation and de-intercalation, which contribute toward the load delivery process. These results are consistent with the CV data and confirm that the Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrode behaves in a similar way to batteries. The specific capacity of the Try–Ni-MOF electrode was calculated to be 845.43 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is significantly higher than the 271.95 F g−1 of the Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF electrode (Fig. S15d†), respectively. The lower IR drop for the Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrode at a specific current density of 20 A g−1 can be attributed to its high conductivity and low internal resistance. The main factor in the significant increases in the energy storage of the Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrode, the existence of a special layer structure as a framework that increases the electron transfer kinetics, also gives it the characteristics of an excellent battery. This shortens the ion transfer pathways in the material, as well as the presence of large cavities and surfaces meaning that there is greater contact with the electrolyte, ensuring OH intercalation and de-intercalation, which may improve the storage capacity of the electrode. In fact, multiple cavities act as an electron transfer channel in the system. The relationship between the specific capacitances and current densities of the Try–Ni-MOF/NF (52% retention) and Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF (51% retention) electrodes are shown in Fig. 7e. As can be seen, even at a current density of 20 A g−1, the capacities are still retained, indicating that the materials have excellent velocities. Also, the long-term cycling stabilities of the materials after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1 were recorded, showing initial capacity retentions of 73.73% and 62.94% for the Try–Ni-MOF/NF and Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF electrodes, respectively, as shown in Fig. S15e.† The electrochemical performances of the Try–Ni-MOF electrode with other cathode electrode reported literatures are compared and displayed in Table S3.† The EIS measurements of the Az–GA/NF, GA/NF, Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF, and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz are displayed in Fig. 7c and f. Moreover, the related Bode diagrams are shown in Fig. S15c and S15f.† For the Az–GA/NF electrode at high frequencies, the EIS data show that it has a very low equivalent series resistance (ESR) of 1.87 Ω and faradaic charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.55 Ω (Table S4†). The ESR and Rct values of Az–GA/NF are higher than those of GA/NF, due to the effect of Az in the Az–GA nanocomposite exhibited in the mid-high-frequency region with a small semicircle in the Nyquist plot. The Warburg impedance for the Az–GA/NF electrode is around 0.32 Ω s−1/2, which is close to that of the GA/NF electrode (0.27 Ω s−1/2) and indicates the presence of Az in the Az–GA nanocomposite and its redox oxidation behavior. From the Bode plots (Fig. S15c†), phase angles of the GA/NF and Az–GA/NF electrodes of −80.75° and −74.42°, respectively, were obtained and the proximity of these two values to −90°, indicates the capacitive behavior of the electrodes. From Fig. S15c† (log|Z| vs. log frequency), it can be seen that the slope values for both the GA/NF and Az–GA/NF electrodes are −0.87 and −0.83, respectively, which are close to the −1 value of an ideal capacitor. The experimental data with extracted parameters related to Az–GA/NF and GA/NF, as well as the equivalent circuits of the samples, are displayed in Fig. S16a and Table S4.†
 Fig. 7  GCDs of the (a, d) Az–GA/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes at different current densities from 1–20 A g−1 in aqueous 3 M KOH electrolyte, (b and e) specific capacitances of the GA/NF, Az–GA/NF, Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF, and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes at various current densities, and (c, f) Nyquist plots of the GA/NF, Az–GA/NF, Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF, and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes, in which the insets show magnified images of the high frequency regions. 
The Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrode has an ESR of 1.78 Ω and Rct values of 1.58 and 248 Ω (Table S5†). The low Rct values for the Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrode are due to the rapid electron/ion transfer at the electrode and high surface contact between the material and the electrolyte, as well as the presence of cavities in the structure of the Try–Ni-MOF. The existence of electronic transport channels and short transmission paths during electrochemical processes reduce the resistance of the Try–Ni-MOF/NF. At low frequencies, the Warburg impedance for the Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrode is around 0.50 Ω s−1/2, which is close to that of the Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF electrode (1.02 Ω s−1/2). This sloping straight line (Fig. S15f†) confirms the synergistic effect between the Try–Ni-MOF porous structure, which provides a short path for electron and ion transfer. From the Bode diagram (Fig. S15f†), oxidation behavior and phase angles of 47.98° and −47.02° are observed for the Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes, respectively. The Warburg parameter represents the diffusion controlled redox behavior (battery-like behavior) at the electrodes. From the log|Z| vs. log frequency (Fig. S15f†), the slope values for both the Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/NF electrodes are −0.55 and −0.54, respectively, which is proof of their battery-like behavior. Experimental data with extracted parameters related to Ni3Cl2(OH)4/NF and the Try–Ni-MOF/NF, as well as the equivalent circuits of the electrodes are displayed in Fig. S16b and Table S5.† These results demonstrate that the Az–GA and Try–Ni-MOF materials can be successfully used as supercapattery electrodes, as they exhibit high-performance, including a large capacitance, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability.33

3.4. Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF supercapattery device
After fabricating three-electrode systems using Az–GA/NF as an anode and Try–Ni-MOF/NF as a cathode, a Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF supercapattery device was constructed. This assembled asymmetric device consists of Az–GA/NF as a negative pole and Try–Ni-MOF/NF as a positive pole, 3 M KOH solution as an electrolyte and a polyethylene membrane as a separator. Using CV and GCD methods, the energy storage performance of this supercapattery device was investigated. To show the desired potential range, the CVs of the Az–GA and Try–Ni-MOF electrodes were recorded in a three-electrode system at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (Fig. S17a†). The potential ranges for the electrodes were −1.30 to 0.00 and −0.20 to 0.55 V for Az–GA/NF and the Try–Ni-MOF/NF, respectively. The CV curves of the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 over a potential range of 1.00–1.80 V are shown in Fig. S17b.† The ideal range of the potential window of the device was 1.60 V. As shown in Fig. 8a, CV curves of the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device were recorded at scan rates of 5 to 100 mV s−1. It can be inferred from the CV data that there are both capacitive and faradaic contributions toward the load storage system. Notably, combining Az–GA/NF and Try–Ni-MOF/Nf as a supercapattery is useful for large-scale energy storage. GCD measurements were performed to evaluate the capacity, speed, and cycling life of the device. Fig. S17c† shows the GCD data of the device in the potential range of 1.00 to 1.65 V. Fig. 8b shows the GCD data of the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device at different current values from 1 to 20 A g−1. The data show that the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device has both capacitive and faradaic contributions. It is noteworthy to mention that the device drains for a long time and therefore has a high capacity, which indicates that its shows battery-like behavior. A significant specific capacitance of 319 F g−1 at a current density of 1 mAg−1 was observed for the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device, due to both the spongy and porous structure of Az–GA and the presence of cavities and large Try–Ni-MOF surface. Also, the ability of the asymmetric device to maintain a capacity of 89 F g−1 at a current density of 20 A g−1 indicates its excellent performance at high currents. Fig. S17d† shows the capacity data of the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device in terms of different current densities. As can be seen from the data, the device retains 28% of its initial specific capacitance, which is very important for a supercapattery. Fig. 8c shows the long-term cycling stability of the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device at a current density of 10 A g−1 over 5000 cycles. Notably, the device shows good electrochemical stability, retaining 92.12% of its initial specific capacity. Using a Ragone plot (Fig. 8d), the relationship between the specific energy and specific power of the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF supercapattery was investigated and its performance was compared with those of other devices. The maximum specific energy of the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device was determined at acurrent density of 1 A g−1 in 3 M KOH to be 66.55 W h kg−1, with a specific power of 349 W kg−1. At a current density of 20 A g−1, the specific energy and specific power of the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF device were recorded as 11.11 W h kg−1 and 4.45 kW kg−1, respectively. The high capacity of this system is great, and it shows a high energy performance and power compared to other previously reported battery and supercapacitor systems, e.g., ZCNM–NS//AC (battery–supercapacitor hybrid, 25.3 W h kg−1 at 787 W kg−1),56 CoNi–MOF//AC (asymmetry supercapacitor, 28.5 W h kg−1 at 1500 W kg−1),57 GONc/RGO (asymmetry supercapacitor, 40.5 W h kg−1 at 900 W kg−1),58 Fe3C/CF//Ni4·5Co4.5-selenide nanowires/NPCC (battery–supercapacitor, 47.4 W h kg−1 at 1500 W kg−1),59 Cd–GA//Ni(OH)2 (Ni super battery, 7.8 W h kg−1 at 5400 W kg−1),1 and Ni3S2/NiV–LDH/rGO/NF//AC (asymmetry supercapacitor, 59.4 W h kg−1 at 852 W kg−1),60 as well as those presented in Table S6.† Furthermore, the asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF supercapattery was shown to be capable of lighting up a red light-emitting diode (LED) (Fig. 8e) for several minutes (Video S1†) after 25 s of charging at 3.2 V.

4. Conclusion
In summary, using a low-cost and fast method, two new materials, Az–GA and Try–Ni-MOF, one as a negative electrode that has capacitive properties and one as a positive electrode that has battery-like properties, were assembled into an asymmetric Az–GA//Try–Ni-MOF supercapattery. The device exhibits a specific capacity of 319 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a high energy density (66.55 W h kg−1 at 349 W kg−1), retaining a capacity of 92.12% after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. Furthermore, the constructed device was shown to be capable of lighting up an LED, indicating its practical applicability as a supercapattery device.
