    , Accepted 20th December 2022First published on 10th January 2023AbstractAlthough the PEDOT:PSS/graphene (PP/GR) thermoelectric (TE) system has a high electrical conductivity (σ), it faces great issues regarding its high thermal conductivity (k) and its relatively low Seebeck coefficient (S) which restrict its TE applications. Therefore, a new composite of PEDOT:PSS and copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticle decorated nitrogen doped graphene (PP/CuONG) has been introduced in this work with a good anisotropic TE performance in order to solve these limitations. Doping of graphene with nitrogen plays a dual role in improving the Seebeck coefficient (S) by creating interfacial energy barriers and decreasing the k value by scattering the phonons. Besides, the adornment of CuO on the NG surface reduces the stacking nature of NG layers and hence decreasing the k value. Moreover, the ferro-magnetic performance of CuO nanoparticles provides a high spin Seebeck coefficient which improves the S value of the composite systems. For CuO < 20 wt%, an increasing trend in anisotropic TE functions is obtained, whereas a great drop in anisotropic TE functions is observed at R.T for CuO > 20 wt%. Interestingly, the anisotropic TE functions are significantly improved by the CuO addition, with the anisotropic power factors PF of the composite with 20 wt% CuO (PF‖ ∼ 180.62 ± 3 μW m−1 K−2 and PF⊥ ∼ 106.52 ± 4 μW m−1 K−2) showing a ∼550% improvement over PP/GR (PF‖ ∼ 32.35 ± 2 μW m−1 K−2, PF⊥ ∼ 18.23 ± 3 μW m−1 K−2). Furthermore, the composite displays k‖ ∼ 0.31 ± 0.045 W m−1 K−1 and k⊥ ∼ 0.27 ± 0.060 W m−1 K−1 at RT for 20 wt% CuO which is >2.8 times smaller than that of PP/GR (k‖ ∼ 0.87 ± 0.04 W m−1 K−1 and k⊥ ∼ 0.606 ± 0.07 W m−1 K−1). Accordingly, the optimized film displays a large anisotropic figure of merit zT (zT‖ ∼ 0.175 ± 0.004 and zT⊥ ∼ 0.118 ± 0.003) at R.T, which is >13 times larger than that of PP/GR (zT‖ ∼ 0.011 ± 0.003 and zT⊥ ∼ 0.009 ± 0.005). This study presents simple, safe, economic, and effective TE composites with promising TE performance which can be potentially applied in TE generators, temperature sensors and spintronics.
1. Introduction
The rapid emergence and evolution of flexible electronic devices have increased the demand for sustainable and renewable energy harvesting and conversion.1 Due to their high efficiency and flexible properties, thermoelectric (TE) materials have become a hot topic for sustainable and renewable energy conversion.2 Currently, the wireless sensor networks used for the internet infrastructure are powered by batteries. These networks have limited energy capacity to support their operation for a long time. The TE device can power the sensor nodes using sustainable energy.3 In the past few decades, significant works have aimed at discovering TE materials with high conversion efficiency near room temperature (R.T), processability, lightweight, stability, as well as high flexibility.4 Three physical parameters, electrical conductivity σ, total thermal conductivity κ, and Seebeck coefficient S, are used to determine the TE material efficiency by the relation zT = S2σT/κ, where the dimensionless zT is the figure of merit, S2σ is the power factor (PF) and T is the absolute temperature.5 It is known that, to generate an effective power with an efficiency >20%, the zT value should be high, i.e. >2.0.6 However, it is a great challenge (difficult) to attain such a great zT value especially near R.T due to the three (S, σ and κ) parameters which are strongly dependent on the temperature and carrier concentration (n).7 Although inorganic materials (such as Bi–Te alloys and superlattices for example) possess a high zT of >1 at room temperature,8 these materials have serious disadvantages such as high cost of raw materials, complicated production on a large scale, heavy thermoelectric devices, costly fabrication methods, contamination with heavy metals, inflexibility, complicated structures and toxicity of the scarce elements which limit their sustainable development and restrict their applicability.9
Conducting polymers have emerged as an attractive candidate to overcome these issues and meet the modern technology desires, due to their low toxicity, source abundance, affordability, lightweight, good mechanical flexibility, and intrinsic low k.10 In fact, a water soluble PEDOT:PSS polymer (designated PP) is one of the most productive TE materials today, due to its unique structure (which contains a positively charged conductive PEDOT and a negatively charged insulating PSS), low intrinsic k and good σ which can be enhanced to reach 4380 S cm−1 at R.T;11 however the TE functions of its pristine structure are very poor (σ ∼ 0.2–1 S cm−1, S ∼ 12 μV K−1, and PF ∼ 1 × 10−2 μW m−1 K−2).12 Thus, many works and strategies have been reported on enhancing the TE functions of the PP polymer, such as post-treatment, dedoping, adjusting its structure and others; however its compositing with inorganics is one of the most effective strategies,13 which combines the benefit of the intrinsically low κ and high flexibility (bendability) of the PP polymer and the greater charge transport features of inorganics.14 For example, (i) PP was composited with metal oxides (such as SnOx, ZnO, Ca3Co4O9 and others) to improve its TE parameters.15 Although a large number of studies have reported on PP/metal oxide composites due to their affordability and promising S values, the results proved that their PFs are very poor due to the poor σ of oxides.16 Therefore, the TE functions of PP/metal oxide composites still need more improvement. Among all metal oxides, actually, copper oxide (CuO) has been recently attracting great attention due to its semiconducting p-type nature, harmlessness, affordability, and abundant resources.17 The high Seebeck coefficient of CuO actually makes it a promising TE candidate. The pressed CuO pellets, for example, have an S value between ∼500 and 600 μV K−1 at 600 K with σ = 0.5 S cm−1.18 Also, in another work, the similar pressed CuO pellets showed S = 550 μV K−1 and σ = 0.3 S cm−1.19 Moreover, a thin film of CuO showed a PF value of 0.5 μW m−1 K−2.20 Although CuO has a high S value, its PF value is extremely low owing to its poor σ which may restrict its wide applications. So, it is preferable to composite it with a PP polymer to obtain a composite with a high σ by improving the electronic transport features, which can be applied in glucose sensors, solar cells, and other applications.21 However, the TE properties of the PP/CuO composite have not been reported to date, to the best of our knowledge. Also (ii) PP was mixed with a conductive graphene (GR) nanofiller to improve its σ and obtain high TE parameters. In this regard, the PP/GR system was fabricated by the in situ polymerization approach to achieve a PF of ∼45.7 μW m−1 K−2.22 A high-quality exfoliated GR NSs/PP system was prepared by a vacuum filtration approach to obtain a PF of ∼53.3 μW m−1 K−2 at 3 wt% GR after hydrazine treatment.23 The composite PANi/PP/DWNTs + GR was prepared by mixing DWNTs + GR with PANi/PP to obtain PF ∼ 2710 μW m−1 K−2, σ ∼ 19 × 102 S cm−1, S ∼ 120 μV K−1 and zT = 2 with an extremely high k ∼ 24.6 W m−1 K−1.24 The composite rGO/C60/PP was prepared to improve σ by 600% and S by 4-fold; however k increased to reach 2 W m−1 K−1, which was still a very high value.25 Also, the composite PVAc/PP/GR-Fe2O3 was prepared to obtain zT = 0.017 with S ∼ 25.42 μV K−1, PF ∼ 51.93 μW m−1 K−2 and k ∼ 0.9 W m−1 K−1; however its k was still too high.26 In spite of the enhancement of TE parameters of PP composites based on graphene, the high k value of the resultant composites is still a great issue due to the extremely high k (25 × 102–53 × 102 W m−1 K−1 at R.T) value of graphene.27 So, there is still a need to develop a new material, idea and/or strategy to obtain a high σ and S keeping k constant without change and/or reducing it which is a great challenge.
Therefore, it is interesting here to introduce a new composite of PEDOT:PSS (PP) and nitrogen doped graphene decorated with copper oxide nanoparticles (PP/CuONG) for high anisotropic TE properties. Hence, the composite PP/CuONG was fabricated by the casting approach. In fact, the choice of the PP polymer here is due to its low k, high σ, main chains (backbones) having a good planarity and a high conjugated degree, durability, affordability, admirable thermal stability, bendability, tunability of properties by doping, high processability and p-type nature. Also, the choice of graphene (GR) for this work is based on the following: (i) it has theoretically high surface area which enhances the interfaces with the PP polymer, improving the energy filtering effect phenomena, and hence enhancing S and PF. (ii) It has a layered structure which produces high conducting pathways (networks) and hence enhancing σ of the composite. (iii) It has a large charge mobility which leads to enhancement of the carrier mobility in the composite and hence improving σ and PF. (iv) Graphene and the PEDOT polymer can interact with each other via the π–π interaction, which leads to enhancement of the interfacial interaction and improvement of the energy filtering effect phenomena, and hence enhancing S and PF. (v) It has brilliant mechanical properties and (vi) an excellent chemical tolerance. Also, the doping of graphene with nitrogen (NG) is done here for (1) producing a discontinuity in the heat phonon expressways (pathways) which decreases the phonon transport and hence reducing k. (2) Increasing the nitrogen–graphene interfaces which increases the phonon scattering, and accordingly decreases k. The choice of copper oxide (CuO) is due to its great S value which can enhance the S value of the composite and hence boosting the PF value. The design of CuO at the nano-scale is done because it tends to behave like a ferromagnet at R.T at the nano-scale; this ferro-magnetic performance provides a high spin Seebeck coefficient (SSC) of CuO which induce the spin Seebeck coefficients of CuONG and enhance the whole S of the PP/CuONG composite. Moreover, the decoration of the NG surface with CuO nanoparticles facilitates the process of decreasing the stacking nature of the NG layers which reduces k. The fabrication of the composite films was done here by the solution casting approach for allowing the CuONG nanofillers to disperse in a polymeric matrix, improving the surface area, improving the adsorption of PP chains on CuONG, generating more interfaces, improving the energy filters in the system and hence enhancing the TE functions.
Therefore, the composite (PP/CuONG) was fabricated by a solution casting approach. The anisotropic TE properties of the composite were explored as a function of the CuO amount at R.T. From the results, the optimal anisotropic TE properties were obtained at CuO = 20 wt% with σ‖ ∼ 259.87 ± 8.49 S cm−1 and σ⊥ ∼ 189.87 ± 10.92 S cm−1. The anisotropic k decreased sharply with CuO content, showing k‖ ∼ 0.31 ± 0.045 W m−1 K−1 and k⊥ ∼ 0.27 ± 0.060 W m−1 K−1 at CuO = 20 wt%. The anisotropic S improved with CuO content, showing S‖ ∼ 83.37 ± 2.3 μV K−1 and S⊥ ∼ 74.9 ± 1.1 μV K−1 at CuO = 20 wt%. The optimal anisotropic PF was obtained at CuO = 20 wt%, displaying PF‖ ∼ 180.62 ± 3 μW m−1 K−2 and PF⊥ ∼ 106.52 ± 4 μW m−1 K−2. Accordingly, the optimal zT value (zT‖ ∼ 0.175 ± 0.004 and zT⊥ ∼ 0.118 ± 0.002) was achieved. Finally, this study opens up a promising strategy to design a highly flexible TE system by using a ferromagnetic material and nitrogen doped carbonic materials for efficient energy conversion.
2. Experimental
2.1. Fabrication of CuO nanoparticles
The fabrication of CuO nanoparticles was realized by a chemical approach as follows:28 Cu(NO3)2.3H2O (Sigma Chemicals) was dissolved in deionized (DI) water (100 mL) at R.T to create 0.1 M concentration (Solution A). NaOH pellets (Al-Nasr Co., Egypt) were dissolved in DI water at R.T to create 0.1 M concentration (Solution B). Then, Solution B was dropped into Solution A at R.T until pH 14 was reached. After that, a black color precipitate was formed, which was collected and washed more than once with DI water and ethanol until pH was 7; then it was dried for 12 h at 80 °C. The dried powders were put into a quartz cuvette and then heated for 4 h at 500 °C to obtain CuO nanoparticles.
2.2. Fabrication of nitrogen doped graphene (NG) nanosheets
At first, graphene oxide (GO) was fabricated by a modified Hummers’ method.29 Suitable amounts of graphite powder (Loba Chemicals), H2SO4 (Al-Nasr Co.) and NaNO3 (Sigma Chemicals) were put into a flask to react with each other at a constant temperature (<20 °C). After that, 9 g of KMnO4 (Loba Chemicals) was added into the above solution with vigorous stirring for 30 min at 35 ± 3 °C. The solution was then cooled to R.T, followed by the addition of 150 mL of DI water gently to it, and then elevating the temperature until obtaining a yellowish suspension. The residual permanganate ions were removed by adding 400 mL of DI water + 30 mL of 5% H2O2. Then, the solution was filtered and successively washed with DI water + ethanol, followed by air-drying at 40 °C to obtain the GO solid powder. Subsequently, 60 mg of the obtained GO was thermally treated to obtain exfoliated graphene. To obtain N–graphene, 60 mg of the obtained GO was sonicated in ethanol (100 mL) for 2 h, followed by the addition of hydrazine hydrate (12 mL) and ammonia (8 mL), with vigorous stirring for 15 min. Then, the solution was moved to a (50 mL capacity) Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was maintained at 180 °C for 3 h. The resulting black powder was washed with DI water + ethanol. The final product was thermally treated to achieve exfoliated N–graphene (NG).
2.3. Fabrication of CuONG nanoparticles
The fabrication of CuONG nanoparticles was done as follows:30 CuO was added to an ethanolic dispersion solution of NG (50 mg) under continuous ultra-sonication for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous solution which was left under ambient conditions for air-drying. The dried CuONG powders were put into a Petri dish, and then moved to a microwave oven for 2 min to obtain a better exfoliation. Finally, CuONG was collected after cooling it to R.T. The amount of CuO added to the NG powders was 5, 10, 20 and 30 wt%.
2.4. Fabrication of the PP/CuONG system
A simple casting technique was used to fabricate the PP/CuONG systems.31 At first, PEDOT:PSS (PP, CLEVIOS PH1000, 1.3 wt%, Sigma Chemicals) was mixed with 5 wt% DMSO (Sigma Chemicals) to improve its conductivity. After that, the CuONG powders with different CuO (wt%) content were added to the DMSO-PP solution with stirring for 1 h at room temperature to obtain a high homogeneity. All samples were molded in Petri dishes and exposed to a hot environment at 58 ± 2 °C for 6 h by using a vacuum oven. Finally, the films were smoothly extracted out to obtain free-standing films.
2.5. Characterization
The crystal structures of the particles were identified at R.T by using a diffractometer (Bruker Axs-D8) with a Cu Kα radiation of λ = 1.54 Å. The morphological analysis was carried out with a TEM (JEOL JEM-1230) and SEM (JEOL JSM-6500F) equipped with an EDS unit, using an electron beam under operating conditions (15 keV energy and 40 nA current). The adsorption/desorption isotherm and the porosity nature of nanoparticles were analyzed by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2020) in a liquid N2 environment. A Raman spectrometer (Alpha 300R/AS, Germany) was used to identify the degree of graphitization of the CuONG particles and analyse the obtained composites. The magnetic behavior was checked with a magnetometer (VSM 7400-S). The measurement of carrier transport characters was done based on the Hall effect via the van der Pauw configuration. A UPS (Thermo-Fisher, Escalab 250Xi, 5 × 10−13 13 bar) spectrometer with an excitation energy of hν = 21.2 eV using a He I source was employed to obtain the work function ϕ = hν − E0 − EF, where EF denotes the Fermi energy and E0 denotes the secondary electron cut off. The (σ⊥, S⊥) and (σ‖ and S‖) TE functions were measured via the two and four probe techniques, respectively (Section S1 and Fig S1, ESI†) with measurement uncertainties ≥5% for both anisotropic S and σ. A Keithley 6517B electrometer was used to measure the anisotropic σ, while a Keithley 616 nanovoltmeter was used for collecting the thermal electromotive force between the sample ends. A steady state home-made device was used to measure the vertical k⊥ while the 3-ω method was used to measure the parallel k‖ with measurement uncertainties of >10% for k⊥ and >8% for k‖. The combined uncertainty was > 20% for zT determination for all measurements. The calculation of error bars is based on five different samples, by calculating the standard deviation by considering the uncertainty of each device. The measurements of all TE parameters were done at R.T.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of CuONG nanofillers
An XRD study of the CuO and CuONG particles was performed (Fig. 1a). The Miller indices (hkl) = (110), (002), (200) and (02) are defined at 2θ = 32.65°, 35.66°, 38.89° and 48.95° for CuO which coincide well with a monoclinic system with the lattice parameter a = 4.68(2) Å (according to JCPDS card No.: 80-1268, CuO).32 Also, the XRD pattern of the NG sheets shows only one board pattern located at 2θ = 25.8° for the (002) plane of graphitic carbon (Fig. 1b).33 Moreover, XRD patterns for CuONG show a broad pattern centered at 2θ = 25.8° for NG, besides the XRD patterns of CuO confirming the creation of CuONG nanoparticles (Fig. 1c). The TEM images of CuO are presented in Fig. 1d. Observably, the size of CuO appears in the nano-domain with a uniform sphere-like morphology. The inset of Fig. 1d shows the SAED patterns (TEM fringes) of CuO which indicate the crystalline nature of the prepared CuO. Also, Fig S2 (ESI†) shows the size distribution map which displays that the CuO varies from 6 nm to 34 nm with an average diameter = 18.1 ± 2 nm. Also, Fig. 1e shows the TEM image of NG which appears as a sheet-like morphology with an interlinked layered structure. The CuO nanoparticles are uniformly (decorated/loaded) dispersed over the NG sheets with a continuous distribution confirming the well decoration of CuO on the NG surface and creating CuONG nanoparticles (Fig. 1f). Fig. 1g shows the SEM micrograph of CuONG proving the decoration of CuO on the NG surface. The elemental compositions of CuO, NG and CuONG particles were identified with the EDS spectrum (Fig. 1h–j). Fig. 1h shows the EDS spectra of CuO with two peaks at energies ∼0.5 keV for oxygen (O) and 1 keV for copper (Cu). Also, the EDS spectra of the NG particles are presented in Fig. 1i. As seen, there are three peaks for carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) at energies ∼0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 keV, respectively. Also, the EDS spectra of CuONG particles are presented in Fig. 1j, which shows four peaks at energies ∼0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1 keV for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O) and copper (Cu), respectively. For further confirmation, the EDS mappings of CuONG nanoparticles were performed (Fig. 2a). As seen, the EDS mappings show the presence of N, C, O and Cu elements, thus confirming the creation of CuONG nanoparticles. Also, the EDS mapping proves that N, C, O and Cu are uniformly distributed in the whole nanoparticles.

Raman spectra were measured to identify the degree of graphitization of CuONG (Fig. 2b). As seen, two sharp (intense) Raman scattering peaks at 1592 cm−1 for the carbon G band and 1347 cm−1 for the carbon D band were detected. In fact, the D band arises from the sp3 carbon defects and/or disorders (lattice distortion), while the G band arises from the graphitic C (in-plane vibration sp2 carbon hybridization).34 The ID/IG ratio actually measures the graphitization degree (degree of disorders).35 Therefore, the values of ID/IG are calculated to be 0.88, 1.05 and 1.09 for GR, NG and CuONG, respectively. As seen, the ID/IG value increases for NG and CuONG samples, indicating that the increase in the degree of defects (carbon defect concentration) and the decrease in the graphitization degree were due to the doping of graphene with nitrogen and loaded CuO on the NG surface.34,35 In fact, these defects play an important role in creating a discontinuity in the heat phonon expressways (pathways) which decreases the phonon transport and hence reducing k and also facilitates filling of the system with static air and/or nitrogen (gaseous environment) and decreasing k. The adsorption–desorption isotherm was studied from the BET analysis displaying a typical type IV adsorption isotherm with a H4-type hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classifications (Fig. 2c). As seen, the three samples have a huge specific surface area of ∼130.21 m2 g−1, 115.85 m2 g−1 and 162.02 m2 g−1 for GR, NG and CuONG. As seen, the surface area of NG is smaller than that of GR due to the cracks and defects in the structure of NG by introducing the N-atoms. Also the average pore size was found to be 4.12 nm, 4.59 nm and 3.38 nm for GR, NG and CuONG proving the mesoporous nature of all samples (Fig. 2d). As well, the pore volume was found to be 0.05 cm3 g−1, 0.07 cm3 g−1, and 0.07 cm3 g−1 (Fig. 2d). Such structure (e.g. high surface area, large pore size/volume and type IV isotherm) helps in improving the adsorption capacity of PP chains on the CuONG surfaces, promoting the interfacial features, boosting the energy barriers, building the energy filters, hence improving S and PF. As well, the CuONG sample has the largest surface area and the best porosity proving the presence of abundant interfaces which helps in improving the S value.
3.2. Magnetic behaviour of the PP/CuONG system
The magnetic behavior (saturation magnetization Ms) of CuO nanoparticles, CuONG and PP/CuONG was examined at R.T (Fig. 3). The hysteresis loop proves that CuO nanoparticles have a ferro-magnetic behavior with an Ms ∼ 4.8 × 10−1 emu g−1 (Fig. 3 and Section S3, ESI†). In fact, the ferromagnetic nature of CuO and its magnetization induce magnetic behavior in CuONG and PP/CuONG, which show a ferromagnetic behavior with Ms ∼ 3.7 × 10−1 emu g−1 and 2.9 × 10−1 emu g−1, respectively. In fact, a ferromagnetic material has great advantage in that it displays spin-Seebeck coefficients (SSC) that contribute to improving the S of the composites.

3.3. Morphological study of the PP/CuONG system

Fig. 4 presents the morphology of the PP/CuONG systems with different CuO contents by using the FESEM micrographs. The mean size of CuO was ∼20 nm, matching the TEM results. As seen, (i) the CuONG nanoparticles were finely dispersed in the PP matrix for the whole systems with different CuO contents. All the (inter-) distances among CuO nanoparticles were very close inside (the same) system, while the distance among CuO nanoparticles was much dependent on the CuO contents. For the systems with 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt% CuO, the average spaces (inter-distances) between CuO nanoparticles were ∼90, ∼60, ∼33 and ∼10 nm, respectively. Fig S4 (ESI†) presents the statistical distance between CuO nanoparticles. It is important to know that the spaces between CuO nanoparticles were (filled with) the PP/NG phases which are very conductive layers and play a significant role in boosting the conductivity (σ). As a result, the size of domains among CuO nanoparticles could affect the TE features of the systems. (ii) The interfaces between nanofillers and PP phases were very tight. As seen, no cracks were found in the films. Such a phenomenon was attributed to the strong/robust interfacial interactions between nanofillers and the PP layers/segments and the high PP bendability/flexibility. The tightly contacted interfaces (strong adhesion and/or adsorption) were benefited in enhancing the interfacial features, boosting the energy barrier, building more energy filters and improving S and PF.31 Moreover, the dense structure of NG nanosheets with their good dispersion found in the PP matrix also helps in controlling the k value of the systems.18 These results actually agree with the BET results. To confirm these results and show the distribution of CuONG on the surface of the obtained films, the surface-SEM scan of the PP/CuONG systems was performed (Fig. S5, ESI†). Fig S6 (ESI†) presents the cross-sectional SEM micrographs of the PP/CuONG films, showing a homogeneous distribution of CuONG in the PP template. The film thickness was measured by the cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S6a–d, ESI†). As obtained, the thickness of the films is measured to be 50.13 μm, 55.35 μm, 62.69 μm, and 66.31 μm for 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt% of CuO, respectively.

3.4. Thermoelectric nature (properties)
As is known, the PP polymer has anisotropic properties with high σ‖ than σ⊥, and also the 2D materials (e.g. graphene) have anisotropic properties. At first, it is important to mention that the amount of graphene (5 wt%) used in this study was selected based on the experiment (Fig. S7, ESI†). The best σ and S of PP/GR were reported at 5 wt% GR. For GR > 5 wt%, a fast decrease is noticed in σ and S because the excessive GR produces an agglomeration in the PP template. The agglomeration of GR nanosheets leads to destruction of the carrier mobility by the thicker GR.36 Owing to GR agglomeration, more wrinkles are produced on the GR nanosheet surfaces via the strong van der Waals forces among GR layers. As a result, the π–π interaction among GR and PP could be severely weakened resulting in worsening of the carrier transport and decreasing S at the same time.37 So, we select the same amount of N–graphene in the study to record the role of nitrogen in enhancing the TE properties.
Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the anisotropic TE properties of the obtained composite. The effect of CuO amount on the anisotropic σ of the systems is presented in Fig. 5a. The σ of PP/GR is found to be σ‖ ∼ 330.16 ± 10 S cm−1 and σ⊥ ∼ 235.16 ± 18.37 S cm−1. In fact, these values are lower than that reported in ref. 38. The reason for this may be attributed to the experimental conditions and/or the preparation method; however the high σ of the system relative to the PP polymer (σ‖ ∼ 180.68 ± 10 S cm−1, σ⊥ ∼ 130.68 ± 18.37 S cm−1) is attributed to the creation of good conductive paths of graphene and the π–π interactions among PP and GR which order the PP molecular chain arrangements and conversely make GR disperse more homogeneously in the PP template, producing an improvement in μ and σ.39 Also, the σ of PP/GR is larger than that of PP/NG (σ‖ ∼ 270.68 ± 18 S cm−1, σ⊥ ∼ 205.68 ± 15 S cm−1). This may be due to the incorporation of N-atoms in graphene that leads to destruction (breaking) of the intactness of the π-electron conjugation structures in GR, enhancing the resistance of electron transportation and hence reducing the σ of GR which is reflected in the reduced σ of the produced films. But just when adding CuO, the anisotropic σ of the system decreases (σ‖ ∼ 230.97 ± 16 S cm−1, σ⊥ ∼ 150.97 ± 11 S cm−1) at 5 wt% CuO, which may be due to the insulating nature of CuO nanoparticles and the sudden disturbance (disruption) that occurred in the media with the CuO addition. However, the σ of the systems increases with CuO until a certain extent. More accurately, one can divide the (σ-CuO content) graph into two regions: the 1st region for CuO < 20 wt% and the 2nd region for CuO > 20 wt%. As shown for a little (small) CuO content (CuO < 20 wt%), σ was strongly increased, while for a higher CuO content (CuO > 20 wt%), σ was considerably reduced. For example, σ‖ ∼ 230.97 ± 16 S cm−1, σ⊥ ∼ 150.97 ± 11 S cm−1 of the system with CuO = 5 wt% increase to σ‖ ∼ 259.87 ± 8 S cm−1, σ⊥ ∼ 189.87 ± 11 S cm−1 for 20 wt% CuO, but they reduce to σ‖ ∼ 213.29 ± 15 S cm−1, σ⊥ ∼ 153.29 ± 17 S cm−1 for 30 wt% CuO. For the 1st region (CuO < 20 wt%), the main reason for increasing σ is the conductive networks of NG, where the low content of CuO nanoparticles makes the space (inter-distance d1) between CuO very large (Fig. 5b and SEM results) which allows NG to be more dense inside the system and link with each other and with PP chains (via π–π interactions) making complete conductive networks and complete conductive paths for carrier transfer through large numbers of PEDOT-NG-PEDOT paths, enhancing μ and hence increasing σ. On the other hand, for the 2nd region (CuO > 20 wt%), the main reason for decreasing σ is the creation of paths of insulating CuO particles on the NG surface, where the high CuO content (more dense CuO environment) makes the space (inter-distance d3) between CuO very close (Fig. 5b) blocking the NG from linking with each other (preventing the stacking of NG layers) and with PP chains (blocking the creation of π–π interactions) making complete insulating barriers and hence decreasing σ. It can be concluded that the σ behaviour is attributed to the inter-distance (d) between CuO nanoparticles. Fig. 5c shows the influence of the spacing (inter-distance, d) between CuO nanoparticles on σ, proving the role of spacing (inter-distance, d) in adjusting the σ of the composite. In spite of the insulating nature of CuO, the σ of PP/CuONG with 20 wt% CuO is larger than that in the case of 5 wt% CuO. Actually, this can be attributed to the fact that CuO increases the order of the PP molecular chain arrangements, increases the effective molecular conformational expansion of the PP chain, increases the ordered chain packing (Raman spectra in Fig S8, ESI†), and reduces the carrier hopping barriers and hence increasing μ and hence σ.

(b) Schematic illustration of the alteration of (reduction in) the inter-distance (space, d) between CuO nanoparticles in the polymeric matrix with CuO concentration. (c) The relation between the anisotropic conductivity of the PP/CuONG films and the inter-distance (space) between CuO nanoparticles. 
Moreover, the conductivity can be described from the carrier mobility (μ) by the formula40 σ = n·q·μ(1)where n is the carrier concentration and q is the electronic charge. As seen, σ is strongly dependent on μ, n, and their multiplicity. The alteration in anisotropic σ with CuO is actually ascribed to (i) the alteration in μ. Thus the Hall parameters (μ and n) of the nanocomposite were measured as a function of CuO amount at R.T (Fig. 6a). As the CuO content increased, μ increased until 20 wt% and then reduced after that. The increase in μ from 5 to 20 wt% (1st region) is because the small concentration of CuO < 20 wt% allows creation of continual NG conductive pathways (using the merit of N–graphene layered structure) which enhances the charge transfers, and hence enhancing both μ and σ. (ii) The strong interactions between NG and PP (via π–π interaction) serve as channels to link the PP layers with each other, which enhances the charge transfer between them, and hence improving both μ and σ. (iii) In fact, the small CuO concentration allows the PP layers to be linked (connected) with the NG (Fig. 6b), and this in turn facilitates the interaction between them (via π–π interaction) and eases the charges transfer between them through the PEDOT-NG-PEDOT paths (Fig. 6d), hence helping in increasing μ and increasing σ in the CuO range of 5–20 wt%.41 (iv) The PP molecular conformational expansion (Fig. S8, ESI†) which eases the charge transfer and increases μ and σ. However, μ decreased after increasing CuO beyond 20 wt%. This is actually due to the CuO stacked on the NG layers in a manner (Fig. 6c) which does not allow (prevents) the creation of π–π interaction between the NG layers and with PP layers, blocking the charge transfer between them and hence decreasing μ, which is reflected in the σ value. On the other hand, n decreased gradually with CuO, which is actually due to the design of the energy barrier in the system.42 The introduction of CuO in the composite makes interfaces (e.g. CuO/NG interfaces, CuO/PP interfaces and others) and builds an energy barrier at the interfaces which filters out the cold carriers with low energy, hence decreasing the total carrier concentration. This explains why the increase in CuO beyond 20 wt% leads to a reduction in σ. Actually, in spite of the reduction in σ of the PP/CuONG system relative to the PP/GR and PP/NG systems, its σ still greater than that of a large number of reported composites (for example, σ‖ ∼ 25 S cm−1 for rGO/Sb2Te3/SV4/PP which is prepared by the screen printing technology43 and σ‖ ∼ 18 S cm−1 for PP/SnSe0.97Te0.0344). But it is still smaller than that of σ‖ ∼ 1036 S cm−1 for PP/GQDs/SWCNTs,45σ‖ ∼ 1000 S cm−1 for PP/Bi2Te3 NWs treated with polar solvent vapor annealing,46σ‖ ∼ 1686 S cm−1 for PP which is treated with triflic acid/trifluoromethanesulfonic acid,47σ‖ ∼ 2213 ± 23 S cm−1 for PP/Xuan paper which is prepared by dip-coating and the subsequent drying process48 and σ‖ ∼ 596 ± 14 S cm−1 for PP film which is annealed at 220 °C for 12 h49 chiefly for the reported composites that were post-treated with polar solvents which are able to remove a large amount of PSS.

(b) Schematic of the way of CuO distribution below 20 wt% on the NG surface, where the NG becomes more dense and link with each other and with PP chains (via π–π interactions) making complete conductive networks for carrier transfer through large numbers of PEDOT-NG-PEDOT paths, enhancing μ and hence increasing σ. (c) Schematic of the way of CuO distribution over 20 wt% on the NG surface, where CuO becomes denser and prevents π–π interactions making complete insulating barriers and hence decreasing σ.

Fig. 7a shows the anisotropic (S⊥ and S‖) Seebeck coefficients of the composite with CuO amount at R.T. As seen, the anisotropic S of PP/GR is found to be S‖ ∼ 31.30 ± 2.5 μV K−1 and S⊥ ∼ 27.84 ± 1.4 μV K−1. This value actually matches well with ref. 50. Also, the anisotropic S of PP/NG is found to be S‖ ∼ 47.94 ± 3 μV K−1 and S⊥ ∼ 43.36 ± 0.9 μV K−1. As seen the anisotropic S of PP/NG is larger than that of PP/GR. This is actually due to the large numbers of interfaces such as N–graphene and NG/PP interfaces that produce an energy barrier which can filter out the cold carriers with low energy, enhancing the S value; this proves the effective role of doping of GR with nitrogen. However, with the addition of CuO, the anisotropic (S⊥ and S‖) Seebeck coefficients of the obtained nanocomposite increase, and then they continue to increase with increasing CuO content. As seen, the anisotropic S increased from S‖ ∼ 70.87 ± 1.9 μV K−1 and S⊥ ∼ 59.2 ± 0.8 μV K−1 for 5 wt% to S‖ ∼ 90.12 ± 2.6 μV K−1 and S⊥ ∼ 81.45 ± 0.9 μV K−1 for 30 wt% at R.T. Actually, the anisotropic S value of the PP/CuONG composite is larger than that of a large number of reported composites (for example, S‖ ∼ 58.6 μV K−1 for PP/AgNWs/CNT51 and S‖ ∼ 18 μV K−1 for PP/PANi/CSA52). This value is also much larger than that of S‖ ∼ 80 μV K−1 for Al/PP/Al,53S‖ ∼ 21.8 μV K−1 for 10 wt% MWCNTs/SnSe/PP,54 17 μV K−1 for PP/PVA/Ag NPs,55 ∼44.3 μV K−1 for PP/SWCNT which was treated with DMSO,56S‖ ∼ 26.95 μV K−1 for PP/SWCNT-30 wt%,57 and S‖ ∼ 33.4 ± 0.4 μV K−1 for PP/SWCNT-90 wt%-mixed with IL.58 But it is still smaller than that of (S‖ ∼ 183.29 μV K−1 for PP/Ag2Se),59 (S‖ ∼ 101 μV K−1 for SWNT-PP/C60-TiS2 which was prepared by the printing process),60 (S‖ ∼ 124 μV K−1 for PP/PEDOT-coated SnSe1−xTex)61 and (S‖ ∼ 120 μV K−1 for PANi/PP/DWNTs + GN which is prepared by LBL deposition).24 This can be attributed to two reasons (i) the high S of reported materials such as C60, TiS2, SWNTs, DWNTs and GN leads to increasing the S value of their composites with PP polymer. (ii) The fabrication method used to prepare these composites such as LBL deposition approach.
 Fig. 7  (a) The influence of CuO amount on the anisotropic Seebeck coefficient of the PP/CuONG films at R.T. (b) Schematic illustration of the spin Seebeck coefficient of the films. (c) Scheme of the dipole and interfacial polarizations in the system. 
The increase in the anisotropic S is actually ascribed to the following: (i) the increase in CuO with its ferromagnetic nature (magnetization) can lead to a spin-Seebeck coefficient (SSC) which has a great advantage in improving the SSC of the produced film. In fact, the SSC is produced from the spin ‘voltage’ when ferromagnetic materials are submitted to a temperature gradient (Fig. 7b). Actually the spin voltage is described with the spin current potential, which is denoted by μ↑–μ↓ where the electrochemical potential for electron spin-up is denoted by μ↑ and the electrochemical potential for electron spin-down is denoted by μ↓; the gradient in the spin voltages produces spin currents.62 In a ferromagnetic material consisting of two different conductors with a dissimilar S value, the conduction electrons with their different spin (-up and/or -down) display different densities and scattering rates, and accordingly display different S values (Fig. 7b). Once the ferromagnetic materials are exposed to temperature gradients T1–T2, a spin voltage (μ↑–μ↓) is generated in different spin channels along T1–T2 (Fig. 7b).63,64 (ii) The interfacial polarizations (interfacial dipole moments) are formed at CuO–NG interfaces, CuONG–PP polymer interfaces inside the TE system and/or at the system surface (Fig. 7c).65 Actually, in the metal/polymer system, the energy barriers formed between CuONG and PEDOT:PSS due to the differences between their work functions lead to accumulation of the charges that produce an interfacial polarization which is reflected in the enhanced S value.66 In addition, these polarizations can be maximized under the action of temperature without charge diffusion producing electrical potential differences during the measurement of voltage between the low and the high temperature terminals; this is called surface interfacial polarization (Fig. 7c). (iii) The defects (defective carbons) and heteroatoms (N) serve as dipoles (i.e. polarization center) that produce dipole polarizations (Fig. 7c), whereas the functional groups that are abundant on the surface (N- C, and others) serve as dipoles due to the differences in the electronegativity between elements.67 (iv) The reduction in n of the PP/CuONG composite with the increase in CuO (Fig. 6a). The S value for degenerate semiconductors based on the carrier concentration (n) and the carrier effective mass (m*) can be obtained from the Mott relation68 (2)
Also, it can describe the S for non-degenerate semiconductors by the Boltzmann formula (eqn (3)) as69 (3)where r is the scatter parameter and h and kB are the Planck and Boltzmann constants, respectively. Physically, S α n−2/3 when m* does not change. Actually, the addition of CuONG into PP creates numerous matrix/filler interfaces (junctions), producing an energy barrier (energy mismatch) at the matrix/filler interfaces, which filters out the cold carriers with lower energy/temperature and allows only the hot carriers with higher energy, leading to a decrease in the total n and hence enhancing S.70 This is what's known as the energy filtering effect (selectivity) phenomenon. This ternary system of PP polymer with CuO and NG nanoparticles can simply illustrate the produced filtering effect (energy barrier) phenomenon. The interfacial band diagram of the ternary system is illustrated in Fig. 8a. As known, the PP polymer has a work function (φ) of 5.22 eV, CuO has a φ of 4.5 eV and NG has a φ of 4.91 eV.71,72 This difference in work functions produces the energy barriers at the interfaces. As seen, at the interfaces of PP/NG and PP/CuO, the energy barrier is ΔEb ∼ 0.31 eV and 0.41 eV, respectively. These two barriers serve as sequential energy filters that effectively filter out the cold carriers and allow the hot carriers. The high energy barrier actually has a great benefit in blocking the cold carriers, so the produced ΔEb (∼0.31 eV and 0.41 eV) in the ternary system can play an effective role in enhancing the S value. (v) The reduction in the work functions of the PP/CuONG films (4.73 eV) where the work function of PP is 5.22 eV from the measured UPS spectra (Fig. 8b and c). As known, the Seebeck coefficient for a given material can be obtained based on the formula S = (kB/e)(E − EF)/kBT, where EF (eV) and E (eV) are the Fermi level and the electron energy, respectively. In fact, the decrease in the carrier concentration leads to an increase in the distance between EF and the conduction band, which changes the work functions and increases the Seebeck coefficient. As shown, the positive Seebeck coefficient for all films indicates a semiconducting p-type nature where the main charge carriers are holes.

(b) The ultraviolet photoelectron spectra of the PP polymer. The inset shows the secondary electron cut off of the PP polymer. (c) The ultraviolet photoelectron spectra of the PP/CuONG system. The inset shows the secondary electron cut off of the PP/CuONG system. 
Also, Fig. 9a presents the anisotropic PFs of the nanocomposite as a function of CuO amount at R.T. As seen, the anisotropic PF of PP/GR is found to be PF‖ ∼ 32.35 ± 2 μW m−1 K−2 and PF⊥ ∼ 18.23 ± 1.8 μW m−1 K−2. Also, the anisotropic PF of PP/NG is found to be PF‖ ∼ 62.20 ± 3 μW m−1 K−2 and PF⊥ ∼ 38.67 ± 5 μW m−1 K−2. As detected, the anisotropic PF of PP/NG is larger than that of PP/GR which may be due to its larger S value. Also, with the addition of CuO, the anisotropic (PF⊥ and PF‖) power factors of the nanocomposite increase and continue to increase with increasing CuO amount at R.T until 20 wt% and then they reduce. As seen, the optimal anisotropic PF value is PF‖ ∼ 180.62 ± 3 μW m−1 K−2 and PF⊥ ∼ 106.52 ± 4 μW m−1 K−2 at R.T for 20 wt% CuO. In fact, the anisotropic PF of the PP/CuONG composite is larger than that of the large numbers of reported composites such as PF‖ ∼ 32.4 μW m−1 K−2 for C60/rGO-PP25 and PF‖ ∼ 64.0 μW m−1 K−2 for Ex-GR/PP.23 This value is also much larger than that of PF‖ ∼ 11.9 μW m−1 K−2 for PP/CNTs,73 PF‖ ∼ 23.7 μW m−1 K−2 for Cu0.98Zn0.02FeS2/PP/GR,74 PF‖ ∼ 9 μW m−1 K−2 for PP-DMSO which is exposed to 10 kGy at 160 °C,75 PF‖ ∼ 36 μW m−1 K−2 for PP/black phosphore,76 PF‖ ∼ 2.5–60 μW m−1 K−2 for PP/rGO/e-textile,77 PF‖ ∼ 3.3 μW m−1 K−2 for PP/GQDs,78 PF‖ ∼ 7.23 μW m−1 K−2 for EG-treated PP/SWCNT fiber,79 and PF‖ ∼ 143 μW m−1 K−2 for rGO-Te NW/PP/PEI doped SWCNTs which are prepared by a vacuum filtration method.59 But it is still smaller than that of (PF‖ ∼ 1350 μW m−1 K−2 for PP/Bi2Te3),80 (PF‖ ∼ 2710 μW m−1 K−2 for PANi/PP/DWNTs + GR which is prepared by LBL deposition),24 and (PF‖ ∼ 284 μW m−1 K−2 for PC-Te/PP treated with 12 M H2SO4).81 This can be attributed to two reasons (i) the high S and σ of reported materials such as Bi2Te3, Te, DWNTs and GN lead to increasing the S and σ values of their composites with PP polymer and hence increasing the PF value of the composite. (ii) The fabrication method used to prepare these composites such as LBL deposition approach.

The reasons behind the increase in the PF value in the range of 5–20 wt% CuO are as follows: (i) the increase in the carrier mobility μ of the nanocomposite with CuO (Fig. 6a), where the PFs are chiefly dependent on μ, according to PF = σS2, which can be simplified to , where P is the hole concentration and Nμ is the effective density of transport level states. (ii) The increase in S of the nanocomposite (Fig. 7a), where PF is directly proportional to S2. As mentioned above, the engineering of a huge number of interfaces (junctions) by increasing CuO generates energy barriers that serve as an energy filter which filters out the cold carriers with low temperature1 and allows the hot carriers with higher temperature participating in the transport mode, and hence boosting the PF (Fig. 9b).
To complete the picture, the anisotropic thermal conductivity was measured. Fig. 10 presents the values of the anisotropic k of the PP/CuONG composite with CuO content. As seen, the anisotropic k of PP/GR is k⊥ ∼ 0.606 ± 0.07 W m−1 K−1k‖ ∼ 0.87 ± 0.04 W m−1 K−1. Actually this k‖ value is approximately the same as that reported in ref. 26. Also, the anisotropic k of the PP/NG composite is k⊥ ∼ 0.49 ± 0.05 W m−1 K−1 and k‖ ∼ 0.66 ± 0.04 W m−1 K−1 which is 1.3 times smaller than that of the PP/GR composite, showing the significant role of doping of graphene with nitrogen in decreasing the anisotropic k. Such small anisotropic k values are attributed to the following: (i) the presence of a huge number of interfaces and defects (Raman analysis in Fig. 2b) caused by doping of GR with nitrogen which lead to scattering of the phonons and therefore declining k (Fig. 11a). (ii) The discontinuity created in the heat phonon pathways by doping of GR with nitrogen which leads to a decrease in phonon transportation and hence decreasing k (Fig. 11b). (iii) The gaseous environment produced which fills the voids (defects) with static air and/or nitrogen inside the system and hence reducing k (Fig. 11c). (iii) Destruction (breaking) of the intactness of the π-electron conjugation structures in graphene, enhancing the resistance of electron transport, and hence reducing the heat transmitted by the electron motion. Also, the anisotropic k value is reduced gradually just by the addition of CuO to k‖ ∼ 0.30 ± 0.04 W m−1 K−1 and k⊥ ∼ 0.26 ± 0.05 W m−1 K−1 at R.T for 30 wt% CuO. In fact, the anisotropic k is smaller than that of the large numbers of composites such as 0.41–0.87 W m−1 K−1 for PP which was post-treated with sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and formamide,82 0.35 W m−1 K−1 for MXene/PP,83 0.29 W m−1 K−1 for PP/Bi2Te3 NWs treated with polar solvent vapor annealing (PSVA),55 and 0.29 W m−1 K−1 for PP/0.1 M MAI + 80% DMF + 20% water.84 But it is still larger than that of the large numbers of composites such as 0.2 W m−1 K−1 for PP which was treated with ILs + acid + base,49 0.2 W m−1 K−1 for PP/Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3,85 and 0.047 W m−1 K−1 for Bi2Te3 NWs/PP.86 The decrease in the anisotropic k with CuO content is attributed to the following: (i) the increase in CuO amount results in a complete decoration of CuO on the NG surface, providing a complete insulating CuO path on the NG surface which produces a reduction in the stacking nature of NG layers and hence decreasing k (Fig. 11d). (ii) The increase in CuO content enhances the number of CuO/NG and CuO/PP interfaces which promotes phonon scattering at these interfaces, and hence reducing k (Fig. 11e). The k‖/k⊥ ratio ≈ 1.15 was achieved for our PP/CuONG system at 20 wt% which is lower than that of PP/DMSO (k‖/k⊥ ≈ 3) or PP (k‖/k⊥ ≈ 2).86

(d) Schematic showing the decoration of CuO over the NG surface which reduces the NG stacking nature. (e) Schematic illustration of the scattering of the phonons by CuO. 
The anisotropic zT of the PP/CuONG system with CuO amount was determined at R.T (Fig. 12). Visibly, the optimal anisotropic zT (zT‖ ∼ 0.174 ± 0.004 and zT⊥ ∼ 0.118 ± 0.003) was detected at CuO = 20 wt%. In fact, the anisotropic zT is larger than that of the large numbers of composites such as ≈0.028 for PP/SWCNTs which were treated with NaBH4/DMSO,87 ≈ 0.0013 for cellulose fiber + PP,88 ≈ 4.26 ± 0.2 × 10−4 for PP/ZnO2,89 ≈ 0.02 for PP/CNT,90 ≈ 7.2 × 10−4 for PP/AC-SWCNT,91 ≈ 1.96 × 10−3 for PP/GQDs/SWCNT multilayer at 298 K,92 0.05 for PP/Bi2Te3 which was prepared by solution mixing,93 and 0.1 for PP/Te.94 But it is still smaller than that of the large numbers of composites such as 0.32 for PP/SnSe nanosheets95 and 0.2 for PP/PAA/Bi2Te3.96 This high anisotropic zT value is ascribed to the great anisotropic S at this content of CuO. The apparent zTa (= PF‖T/k⊥) was also determined at the same CuO content and it was found to be zTa ∼ 0.20 ± 0.003. Also, it was found that zTa is larger than both zT‖ and zT⊥. A comparison between our TE material and other materials is presented in Table 1 to measure the efficiency of our TE material. Although our material shows good TE properties as compared with a large number of TE materials, can be prepared by quite an easy, fast and rapid process and is safe, eco-friendly, flexible, affordable, and fast processable, the values of σ of our materials are still low as compared with the other materials. Therefore it is important to treat this material with base or acid agents to improve its σ.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, a new composite of PEDOT:PSS and copper oxide decorated nitrogen doped graphene (PEDOT:PSS/CuONG) has been designed for promising TE properties. The strategy of this work was based on (1) reducing and controlling the thermal conductivity by (i) doping of graphene with nitrogen to produce phonon and electron scattering and (ii) decorating CuO on the surface of nitrogen-graphene for reducing the stacking nature of NG. (2) Increasing the Seebeck coefficient by (i) using the ferromagnetic CuO which provides spin Seebeck coefficients, inducing the spin Seebeck coefficients of the nanocomposite and hence improving the Seebeck coefficients of the nanocomposite. (ii) The dipole and interfacial polarization inside the films. Accordingly, the anisotropic k reduced with the CuO content to k‖ ∼ 0.31 ± 0.05 W m−1 K−1 and k⊥ ∼ 0.27 ± 0.06 W m−1 K−1 at R.T for 20 wt% CuO. The anisotropic conductivity σ (σ‖ ∼ 259.87 ± 8.5 S cm−1, σ⊥ ∼ 189.87 ± 11 S cm−1) was optimized at 20 wt% CuO and this is attributed to the space (inter-distance) between CuO nanoparticles which optimizes the carrier mobility. The reduction in the carrier concentration by increasing CuO leads to an improvement in the anisotropic S to S⊥ ∼ 74.9 ± 1.1 μV K−1 and S‖ ∼ 83.37 ± 2.27 μV K−1. The optimal zT‖ ∼ 0.174 ± 0.004 and zT⊥ ∼ 0.118 ± 0.003 were obtained at R.T for 20 wt% CuO with optimized PF‖ ∼ 180.62 ± 3 μW m−1 K−2 and PF⊥ ∼ 106.52 ± 4 μW m−1 K−2. Finally, the system opens up the horizon into a new, promising strategy to enrich the TE properties of the PEDOT:PSS polymer by controlling the anisotropic thermal conductivity and enhancing the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients for electronics, thermal sensing and wearable technologies.
