The gels offer chemical variety and hierarchically porous structures and are susceptible to modification via porphyrin metal centres. The Pd gel shows cathodic electrocatalytic activity to produce H2 when coated on FTO electrodes. The gels are stable and active for visible-light driven hydrogen production in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor and a cocatalyst. Impregnation of the Pd metal centre greatly enhances the H2 evolution rate. The Pd gel enables efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution via photoinjection of electrons from the light-harvesting gel network into the Pt nanoparticles. When illuminated with visible light, the Pt-doped PdTAPP–TFPT gel produces hydrogen from aqueous sodium ascorbate solution without significant degradation during four runs (1.0744 × 105 μmol g−1 for 120 h totally). Interestingly the wet gels show remarkably higher H2 production efficiency than their dried counterparts.
Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting is one of the simplest ways for the conversion of solar energy into clean, renewable H2 fuel.1 A number of photocatalytic systems have been developed during the past decade, e.g., inorganic semiconductors,2 while growing interest in organic semiconductor materials has also been received due to their abundance and tuneable optical band gaps, including carbon nitride (g-C3N4),3 organic polymers4 and porous covalent organic frameworks5 as photocatalysts. Very recently gels have been recognized as a novel type of photocatalytic catalysts.6 Stupp and coworkers reported supramolecular gels that integrate both light-harvesting chromophores and fuel-producing catalysts into a material for light-driven hydrogen production.6 In contrast to known inorganic and polymeric photocatalysts, gels can facilitate the light-driven water splitting reaction within a hydrated environment. Such gel catalysts with a large specific surface area benefit the adsorption and dissociation of water molecules. In addition, gels show easy loading of cocatalysts,7 and provide convenient mass transfer channels.8 Thus gels may present a new class of catalysts for solar energy conversion.
Herein, we design and synthesize novel porphyrin-based imine gels assembled from small molecules, and they are used for visible-light-induced hydrogen evolution using sodium ascorbate as the sacrificial electron donor in the presence of Pt as the proton reduction catalyst. Dynamic covalent imine gels are constructed from polycondensation of bridging amines and aldehydes. Such gels assembled at low cost from small molecular precursors feature easy modification, affording an extraordinary feature to engender desired functional behaviour by choosing appropriate small molecular precursors.9 Their hierarchically porous structure is especially advantageous for (co)catalyst loading. In addition, the properties of porphyrin-based gels can be readily tuned by adjusting the metal centre. Arising from these features of porphyrin-based imine gels, their electrocatalytic performance is reported, and remarkably their ability as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution from water has been investigated under visible light irradiation.
Results and discussion
A series of (metallo)porphyrin imine gels were designed based on imine chemistry by reacting free-base porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(p-aminophenyl)porphyrin (H2TAPP)10 and its metalated derivatives (MTAPP, M = Pd and SnCl2)11 with 1,3,5-tris-(4-formyl-phenyl)triazine (TFPT). Triazine has a progressive substitution of alternate carbons in the central aryl ring of the triphenylaryl platform by nitrogen atoms leading to a change in the electronic and steric properties of the central ring12 and easy loading of the cocatalyst and stabilization of metal ions or small metal nanoparticles due to abundant nitrogen atoms.13 Triazine-based molecules offer high electron drift mobility.14 Porphyrin moieties can absorb a considerable fraction of the incident sunlight, show a good stability upon prolonged storage in aqueous solution, and thus produce efficiently separated ion products upon irradiation in the presence of an electron donor or acceptor.15 The band gap energies of porphyrin-based materials are tailorable to some extent by the choice of impregnated metal centres of porphyrin moieties. Additionally H2TAPP and MTAPP contain four amine groups and can act as a building unit with multiple functional ends for polymeric imine gels. Based on imine dynamic covalent chemistry, various imine gels were successfully prepared by reacting H2TAPP or MTAPP with TFPT in a 1:1 molar ratio of –NH2 and –CHO reactive groups in DMSO in the presence of a catalytic amount of acetic acid (Scheme 1). As a representative, a PdTAPP–TFPT gel was prepared by reacting TFPT and PdTAPP in a molar ratio of 4:3 in DMSO, which is investigated in detail. Heating the precursor solution at 80 °C accelerated the gelation to result in opaque brownish black gels within 0.5 h. The gels were thermally irreversible, and heating for a longer time caused the gel to turn firmer. To characterize the gels, the corresponding aerogels were obtained as well by subcritical CO2(l) drying.

SEM and TEM investigations of PdTAPP–TFPT, H2TAPP–TFPT and SnTAPP–TFPT show that the porphyrin-based imine gels have porous network structures consisting of interconnected nanoparticles (Fig. 1, S1 and S2†). All the wet gels are amorphous, as revealed by the broad powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. S3†). The chemical structure was characterized by various analytical methods. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of PdTAPP–TFPT shows the existence of the Pd element (Fig. S4†). The Fourier-transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) of the aerogels displays a characteristic Ar–CN– stretching band at around 1600–1650 cm−1, confirming the formation of imine bonds via condensation of aldehyde and amine groups (Fig. S5†).16 A broad band at around 3418 cm−1 is due to the N–H stretching of unreacted amine functional groups of the gels. CO stretching bands of unreacted aldehyde functional groups were also detected at around 1665–1700 cm−1. This suggests that the condensation of aldehyde and amine groups is incomplete in the gels. The 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum supports the formation of imine bonding corresponding to the signal at 161.4 ppm and confirms the presence of the triazine ring at 167.9 ppm (Fig. S6†).5b,17 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the oxidation states of metal elements (Pd and Sn) (Fig. S7 and S8†). For PdTAPP–TFPT, the fitting of XPS signals confirms the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 states of divalent Pd(II) (binding energies of 344.4 and 338.2 eV).18 The existence of Sn in the SnTAPP–TFPT aerogel is evidenced by a shoulder observed on the main peak at 495.41 and 486.93 eV, which is assigned to Sn(IV) species.19 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the PdTAPP–TFPT aerogel has good thermal stability up to ∼350 °C (Fig. S9†).

Nitrogen physisorption was performed at 77 K to characterize the porosity of the porphyrin-based imine aerogels (Fig. S10†). PdTAPP–TFPT, H2TAPP–TFPT and SnTAPP–TFPT aerogels showed a type II adsorption branch according to the IUPAC classification with a steep rise at P > 0.09 MPa. The isotherms are accompanied by a remarkable hysteresis in the desorption isotherm showing that a range of mesopores are present. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area is 343 m2 g−1 and the total specific pore volume is 2.21 cm3 g−1 for PdTAPP–TFPT, which are the highest among those of the three materials (Table S1†). Non-local density functional theory (NL-DFT) pore size distributions show that the aerogels have a wide range of mesopores. The PdTAPP–TFPT aerogel shows a H2 sorption of 0.80 wt% (89.8 cm3 g−1) at 77 K and 0.54 wt% (60.4 cm3 g−1) at 87 K with hysteresis and the H2TAPP–TFPT aerogel shows a H2 sorption of 0.98 wt% (109.6 cm3 g−1) at 77 K and 0.42% (47.5 cm3 g−1) at 87 K (Fig. S11†). The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) was estimated by fitting the H2 isotherms at 87 and 77 K to the virial equation. The initial Qst of PdTAPP–TFPT (16.2 kJ mol−1) is significantly higher than that of H2TAPP–TFPT (5.0 kJ mol−1). This indicates that impregnated Pd2+ ions exert effects on the interaction energy between H2 and the gel matrix at low loadings.11
The diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) spectrum of the PdTAPP–TFPT aerogel exhibits a strong broad absorption in the visible region with the absorption tail extending well beyond 700 nm, indicative of extended π conjugation and the photon absorption ability upon visible light irradiation (Fig. S12†). Moreover, the black optical colours also reflect the extended π conjugation. The optical band gap of PdTAPP–TFPT was estimated to be 1.60 eV derived from the Tauc plot (Fig. S13†). In principle, the observed HOMO−LUMO gap is large enough to enable water splitting through band gap excitation and at the same time small enough to harvest a significant portion of the visible light spectrum.20
The electrochemical properties of the porphyrin-based imine gels were measured in a conventional three-electrode cell. As schematically shown in Fig. 2a, the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate coated with a layer of the gel film was used as a working electrode. The gel films were loaded onto the FTO by the solution–gel transition of pre-mixed gelator-containing solutions using the drop deposition method. When a negative potential was applied on the working electrode, the catalytic formation of H2 could be activated resulting from the reduction of H+ in water by electrons. While the electrons were transferred from the Pt counter electrode to the gel-coated FTO working electrode, water was oxidized on the Pt electrode surface to generate O2. The polarization curves of gel-coated FTO electrodes under stable conditions are presented in Fig. 2b. Compared with the bare FTO substrate, observable cathodic current signals corresponding to H2 generation are measured in the range of −0.7 V to −1.1 V versus Ag/AgCl for the PdTAPP–TFPT gel-coated FTO electrodes. The electrocatalytic activity of PdTAPP–TFPT gel films increases with the amount of catalysts deposited onto FTO. The improvement in the HER performance caused by the PdTAPP–TFPT gel films is higher than that of MoS2 on mesoporous graphic carbon nitride surfaces under neutral pH conditions.21 In contrast to PdTAPP–TFPT, the H2TAPP–TFPT gel shows no obvious electrocatalytic activity for water reduction. The absence of the electrocatalytic activity of H2TAPP–TFPT gels would result from the lack of Pd metal as catalytic centres.22

(b) Stable polarization curves of bare FTO and FTO electrodes coated with PdTAPP–TFPT and H2TAPP–TFPT gel films. Loading amounts of precursor solutions: 2 μL of the H2TAPP–TFPT mixture (0.03 mol L−1 based on H2TAPP) and 2 μL (test 1) and 4 μL (test 2) of the PdTAPP–TFPT mixture (0.03 mol L−1 based on PdTAPP). Scan rate: 0.05 V s−1 in 0.1 M KH2PO4 aqueous solution (pH = 7.0). (c) Corresponding Tafel plots of FTO electrodes coated with PdTAPP–TFPT gel films. (d) Electrochemical impendence spectroscopy analysis of PdTAPP–TFPT gel film-coated FTO electrodes. 
The Tafel slopes corresponding to the polarization curves also vary with the amount of PdTAPP–TFPT gels on FTO (Fig. 2c). At a deposition amount of 2 μL of premixed PdTAPP and TFPT solutions in DMSO (0.03 mol L−1 based on PdTAPP), the Tafel slope is 418 mV per decade, while when the deposition amount is doubled to 4 μL, the Tafel slope increases to 447 mV per decade. The electrocatalytic activity of the system with an increasing amount of PdTAPP–TFPT gel catalysts may be compromised by the increase in the Tafel slope value. This compromising effect suggests that the scalability of the electrocatalytic system may be limited.23 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis was undertaken to reveal the charge-transfer resistance of the PdTAPP–TFPT gel catalyst (Fig. 2d). The diameter of the semicircular Nyquist plots at high frequencies varies with the deposition amounts of PdTAPP–TFPT. In comparison, the PdTAPP–TFPT gel deposited using a more deposition amount (4 μL) of pre-mixed precursor solutions results in the semicircle with a decreased diameter. This difference in diameter shows that the sample corresponding to a higher deposition amount has a lower charge-transfer resistance, and thus, a faster electron transfer rate.24 The results from the impedance analysis are in agreement with the enhanced HER performance of the sample presented by the polarization curves in Fig. 2b.
The present gels were investigated for visible light-induced hydrogen evolution with Pt doping in the presence of a sacrificial agent. In the photocatalytic system the gel matrix harvests sunlight and primarily acts as a photosensitizer for exciton generation, and the electrons are transferred to Pt nanoparticles to reduce H+ and produce hydrogen using the harvested energy. The gels were loaded with Pt nanoparticles in their hierarchically porous structure as the cocatalyst by in situ photodeposition of H2PtCl6. The wet gels were readily dispersible in water without adding an organic co-solvent, and then H2PtCl6 solution was added into the dispersion. After full illumination with a 300 W Xe lamp (visible light and UV) for 30 min, the Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT wet gel was obtained in the case of PdTAPP–TFPT and used for the photocatalytic study. SEM showed that the Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT morphology has no significant change as compared with the PdTAPP–TFPT gel and TEM showed that Pt nanoparticles of ca. 2 nm are effectively immobilized onto the gel matrix and are distributed homogeneously (Fig. 3a–c and S14†). Peak fitting of the Pt 4f XPS spectrum from the recorded high resolution scan reveals that Pt species are mainly Pt(II), located at 73.3 and 76.5 eV.25 This is consistent with the relatively short illumination time (only 30 min).26 Besides XPS reveals that some Pt(0) species are present. It is also evidenced by TEM that the Pt nanoparticle taken at high resolution shows atomic lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.23 nm which corresponds to Pt(111) planes.

Photocatalytic H2 production was studied for Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT with visible light in an aqueous system using sodium ascorbate as the sacrificial electron donor. For long-time hydrogen evolution experiments, the Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT wet gel was dispersed in water with sodium ascorbate. PdTAPP–TFPT evolved hydrogen with a total amount of 30880 μmol g−1 during 48 h (Fig. 4a). After the induction time of ca. 24 h, the PdTAPP–TFPT wet gel showed continuous and increasing hydrogen production of 671 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) for the next 24 h. During the last 2 h, the hydrogen production rate reached 1200 μmol h−1 g−1. The reusability study of the gel catalyst was performed because sacrificial sodium ascorbate was consumed in the reaction. For the next run the photocatalyst Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT wet gel was separated from its dispersion by filtration, washed with water, and redispersed in a fresh sodium ascorbate solution and illuminated for 24 h (λ > 420 nm) for each cycle. In the second and third runs, a shorter induction time of ca. 4 h was observed and a higher hydrogen evolution rate was detected, with the amount of hydrogen evolved as high as 1200 μmol h−1 g−1, while during the last 4 h the hydrogen production rate reached 1800 μmol h−1 g−1. Generally the PdTAPP–TFPT wet gel exhibited a hydrogen production of 28000 μmol g−1 in the second run (24 h), and 28720 μmol g−1 in the third run (24 h). In the fourth run (24 h), the hydrogen evolution rate decreased and the hydrogen production was 19840 μmol g−1.
 Fig. 4  (a) Time course of hydrogen evolution from sodium ascorbate aqueous solution using the Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT wet gel under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), and (b) time course of hydrogen evolution by various gels. 
SEM and TEM investigations reveal that the gel morphology and the porous network structure of the Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT wet gel were retained after the gel was recycled 4 times although aggregation occurred to some degree (Fig. 3d–f and S16†). TEM images show that the Pt nanoparticles were still trapped in the gel network. XPS investigation of the recycled gel after four runs shows the intense doublet at 71.9 and 75.2 eV which is assigned to the signals of Pt(0) 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 levels, respectively (Fig. S17†).27 This shows that Pt(II) was reduced to Pd(0) during the photocatalysis. TEM shows clear lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.23 nm which corresponds to Pt(111) planes. Consistent with these observations, we observed that the induction time was shortened to ca. 4 h during the next runs, while it was longer (ca. 24 h) in the first run where the photoreduction may occur.28 The Pt(II) species usually lower the photocatalytic efficiency.29 In the first run, Pt(II) turned into Pt(0) during the long induction period of 24 h. In contrast, the induction time was reduced to ca. 4 h due to the lack of the reduction process. During the induction period, sodium ascorbate acts as the sacrificial electron donor, which was first absorbed by the wet gels. Following the absorption of visible light by the porphyrin and the generation of associated electronic excited species in the wet gel, sodium ascorbate is oxidized to organic decomposition products by the remaining positive charge on the porphyrin unit.30 The decreasing activity in the fourth run may result from the partial reduction of the imine bond as FT-IR of Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT after the fourth run shows the appearance of the –C–N–Ar stretching band at 1260 cm−1 (Fig. S18†).31
The above results suggest that the present PdTAPP–TFPT gel is a photocatalytic system which is much more stable than the previous gel system.6 Moreover the PdTAPP–TFPT gel is compared with other related photocatalytic systems. It is superior to Pt-modified amorphous melon (720 μmol h−1 g−1),3b ‘g-C3N4’ (840 μmol h−1 g−1),3d crystalline poly(triazine imide) (864 μmol h−1 g−1),3b TFPT-COF (230 μmol h−1 g−1)5b and N3-COF (1703 μmol h−1 g−1).5a During the long-term studies performed with sodium ascorbate as the sacrificial electron donor, photocatalysis lasting up to 120 h using Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT shows that the hydrogen generation rate is increasing and Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT is stable over 96 h. In contrast, for TFPT-COF, the amount of hydrogen evolved in the first 5 h is as high as 1970 μmol h−1 g−1 but this high rate is accompanied by quick deactivation.5b N3-COF shows sustained hydrogen evolution for over 120 h, but it has a much lower rate of about 80 μmol h−1 g−1.5a Therefore the present PdTAPP–TFPT gel shows not only higher hydrogen generation rates but also more stable properties.
To reveal why the PdTAPP–TFPT gel is highly active, a number of control experiments were performed. No hydrogen evolution was observed for the PdTAPP–TFPT aerogel without Pt doping, showing that Pt is the cocatalyst. When the porphyrin unit varied, different performances in photocatalytic H2 production were observed. Without metal centres the H2TAPP–TFPT wet gel exhibited a low hydrogen production rate of 29 μmol h−1 g−1. The SnTAPP–TFPT wet gel showed a continuous and stable hydrogen production of only 65 μmol h−1 g−1 during continuous 24 h visible light illumination. The calculated quantum yield for PdTAPP–TFPT (0.0029%) is also higher than those for H2TAPP–TFPT (0.0025%) and for SnTAPP–TFPT (0.00034%) (Fig. S19†). These results show that the photoactivity of present gels is readily tuned by the porphyrin metal centres.
The charge migration kinetics was studied. Photocurrent–time (I–t) curves reveal that the PdTAPP–TFPT wet gel has response to the light on or off, suggesting that the materials can absorb light and generate electrons (Fig. S20†). Photoluminescence spectra show that the luminescence intensity for Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT is much weaker than that of Pt@SnTAPP–TFPT (Fig. S21†), suggesting fast charge transfer from the porphyrin ring to Pt, high separation efficiency and low recombination of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT wet gel. The time-resolved luminescence decay profiles suggest that the introduction of metal ions into porphyrin-based gels results in different suppression of the photoexcited charge recombination due to the different electron-transfer channel. Comparison between Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT and Pt@SnTAPP–TFPT wet gels (average τ 236 ± 4 ns < 245 ± 4 ns) indicates that a more efficient charge separation is achieved for Pt@PdTAPP–TFPT. However, weaker luminescence intensity and a short lifetime (average τ = 241 ± 4 ns) were observed for Pt@H2TAPP–TFPT probably due to different coordination modes between Pt and porphyrin (Fig. S18†).
The activity of aerogels was also investigated. The PdTAPP–TFPT aerogel showed a hydrogen production of 95 μmol h−1 g−1 during 24 h, and the H2TAPP–TFPT aerogel exhibited only 6 μmol h−1 g−1. It is interesting that the wet gels have much higher activity than aerogels. This suggests that the unique porous network structures consisting of interconnected nanoparticles of present gels may efficiently improve the diffusion of light-induced charge carriers to the surface thus leading to high photocatalytic activity. Moreover higher isosteric heat of adsorption of H2 of PdTAPP–TFPT possibly helps improve the production of H2 as well. Generally PdTAPP–TFPT has a high surface area, pore volume, and H2 adsorption enthalpy, resulting in efficient separation of photogenerated charges and thus remarkably high photocatalytic activity.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of porphyrin-based imine gels (MTAPP–TFPT, M = Pd, H2, and SnCl2) have been assembled from small molecular precursors, and their photocatalytic performance was explored in hydrogen production from water under visible light irradiation. The gels offer chemical variety and are susceptible to systematic modification via porphyrin metal centres. The PdTAPP–TFPT gel shows cathodic electrocatalytic activity to produce H2 when coated on FTO electrodes. The PdTAPP–TFPT gel has strong visible-light harvesting power, has a hierarchically porous structure efficient for Pt cocatalyst loading, and leads to high stability and a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate from water. When illuminated with visible light, the Pt-doped PdTAPP–TFPT gel continuously produces H2 from aqueous sodium ascorbate solution without significant degradation after four runs (1.0744 × 105 μmol g−1 for 120 h totally, 48 h for the first run, and 24 h for the next runs). The gel shows significantly higher H2 production efficiency and stability than its dried counterparts and related photocatalytic systems. This demonstrates the possibility of using supramolecular gels assembled from functional molecular precursors to design active photocatalytic materials. With the availability of metal centres, and good electronic transmission efficiency, photoactive gels represent a model system to study and adjust the molecular entities central to the photocatalytic process.
