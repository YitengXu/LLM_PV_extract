    , Accepted 25th May 2015First published on 26th May 2015AbstractA novel small molecule NI-T-NI with a thiophene core and two 1,8-naphthalimide terminal groups was synthesized via direct C–H activation and used as the acceptor for polymer solar cells. NI-T-NI exhibits a good crystallinity and can form H-aggregates in the solid state. NI-T-NI has a rather high-lying LUMO level, which is beneficial for achieving a high Voc. In cooperation with a high-lying LUMO level polymer PCDTBT-C12, a PCE of 2.01% with a high Voc of 1.30 V has been achieved. As far as we know, a Voc of 1.30 V is the highest value reported for single junction organic solar cells. Our results have demonstrated that 1,8-naphthalimide could be a useful building block for the synthesis of promising acceptor materials for polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ PSCs) have attracted particular interest due to their advantages of light weight, low-cost and mechanical flexibility.1–5 Until now, BHJ PSC has been proved to be the most efficient device structure, which is composed of an electron-rich polymer donor and an electron-deficient fullerene derivative acceptor, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10% has already been achieved for single junction devices.6,7 Fullerene derivatives such as (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are widely used as electron acceptors due to their high electron affinity and mobility.8,9 However, the weak absorption in the visible region, costly synthesis, and difficulties in chemical modification and purification have hampered their practical applications. Moreover, their low LUMO energy levels often lead to low open-circuit voltage (Voc) values when blended with conjugated polymer donors.10,11 Recently, more and more attention has been paid to the development of non-fullerene acceptors and a PCE higher than 6% has been achieved.12–14 Nonetheless, it is still challenging to design and synthesize n-type organic molecules that rival properties of fullerene derivative acceptors. Using n-type small molecules as a non-fullerene alternative has distinct advantages. The band gap and energy level can be easily tuned by structural modification to effectively harvest the solar energy and to match the energy level with that of the electron donor.15–17 As n-type materials, 1,8-naphthalimide (NI) based small molecules possess high electron mobilities and low-lying LUMO energy levels.18,19 Although NI based small molecules were rarely used as acceptor materials for organic/polymer solar cells, a PCE of 5.3% has been achieved for the NI based small molecular acceptor that contains two strong electron withdrawing cyano groups.20
In this work, we have developed a new small molecular electron acceptor NI-T-NI, which is composed of two terminal NI moieties and a central thiophene bridge. Direct C–H activation (DCHA) has been used to synthesize NI-T-NI. Compared with the traditional transition metal mediated cross-coupling reaction for the formation of the carbon–carbon bond, DCHA exhibits obvious advantages such as fewer synthetic steps and avoidance of organometal or organoboron reagents.21,22NI-T-NI exhibits excellent solubility in normal organic solvents and its HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −6.07 and −3.53 eV, respectively. NI-T-NI molecules are prone to forming H-aggregates in the solid state, which is beneficial for the charge transport. Moreover, NI-T-NI exhibited a good crystallinity with a melting peak at 186.7 °C and a crystallization peak at 152.2 °C. PCDTBT-C12 was used as the donor material because it has a matched HOMO and LUMO energy levels with NI-T-NI. An amorphous polymer donor and a crystalline acceptor small molecule might be beneficial for achieving balanced electron and hole mobility for the blend film. Photovoltaic devices with the blend of PCDTBT-C12 and NI-T-NI as the active layer showed the best PCE of 2.01% with a Voc of 1.30 V. To the best of our knowledge, a Voc of 1.30 V is the highest reported value for single junction organic solar cells.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of NI-T-NI and PCDTBT-C12 are shown in Scheme 1. Compound 2 was synthesized by the reaction of 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride and dodecylamine in ethanol solution. Cross-coupling of an excessive amount of compound 2 and thiophene via DCHA using Pd(OAc)2 and PCy3 HBF4 as the catalyst precursors afforded NI-T-NI in a yield of 85%. Compounds 3 and 4 were synthesized according to literature procedures.23,24PCDTBT-C12 was obtained in a yield of 84% via Suzuki–Miyaura polycondensation of 3 and 4 in a mixture of THF/toluene (3:1) and aqueous NaHCO3 with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst precursor. NI-T-NI exhibits excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature. PCDTBT-C12 shows poor solubility in the above mentioned solvents at room temperature but can be fully dissolved in CB and DCB at elevated temperature. The number average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of PCDTBT-C12 were measured to be 20.1 kg mol−1 and 2.5, respectively, using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) as an eluent and polystyrenes as the calibration standards.

Material synthesis and characterization
UV-vis absorption characteristics of NI-T-NI and PCDTBT-C12 were investigated in diluted DCB solutions at a concentration of 1 × 10−5 M. As shown in Fig. 1a, NI-T-NI shows a broad absorption range from 350 to 500 nm with a single peak at 399 nm. Similar to some other small molecules, NI-T-NI exhibited an apparently blue-shifted absorption spectrum upon going from the solution to the film, which might originate from the H-aggregation of NI-T-NI molecules as films.25,26 After thermal annealing, NI-T-NI exhibited a further blue shift from 382 nm (before annealing) to 378 nm (after annealing), which demonstrated that thermal annealing could enhance the H-aggregation of NI-T-NI. The formation of H-aggregates by NI molecules may be beneficial for electron transport upon formation of a blend film with the donor polymers.20 The enhanced absorption coefficient of NI-T-NI above 450 nm also demonstrated the occurrence of a stronger π–π stacking in the solid state.26 The optical band gap (Eg,opt) of NI-T-NI estimated by the absorption edge of 488 nm in the film absorption spectrum is 2.54 eV. PCDTBT-C12 exhibits a broader absorption range from 350 to 630 nm with two peaks at 397 and 539 nm, which could be attributed to the π–π* transition and the intramolecular charge transfer interaction from the carbazole unit to the benzothiadiazole unit, respectively. Compared with the solution absorption, that in the film of PCDTBT-C12 was red-shifted due to the enhanced intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state. The absorption onset of PCDTBT-C12 as thin films is 630 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of 1.97 eV. The related data are summarized in Table 1. The UV-vis absorption characteristics of blend films with a PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI ratio of 1:4 were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 1c, blend films before and after annealing both exhibited broad absorption spectra. After thermal annealing, the enhanced H-aggregation of NI-T-NI can be observed with the peak blue shifted from 383 to 378 nm.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to investigate the packing properties of NI-T-NI and PCDTBT-C12 in the solid state (Fig. S5, ESI†). NI-T-NI presents a relatively intense diffraction peak in the small angle region and a few peaks in the wide angle region, which demonstrates that NI-T-NI has good crystallinity. The small angle of 4.45° revealed that the stacking distance of backbones separated by the flexible end chains is 19.83 Å. There was one peak at 5.02° for PCDTBT-C12, which demonstrated that the stacking distance of backbones separated by the flexible end chains is 17.58 Å. The packing properties of PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI blend films with a weight ratio of 1:4 before and after thermal annealing were also investigated. After thermal annealing, the peak of blend films in the small angle region was slightly red shifted from 4.46° to 4.50°, reflecting a smaller d-stacking distance.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of NI-T-NI and PCDTBT-C12 were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) on a glassy carbon working electrode in a CH3CN solution of Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M). The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as the internal reference standard. As shown in Fig. 2, E(Fc/Fc+) was determined to be 0.23 eV and the onset oxidation potential (Eox) of NI-T-NI is 1.50 eV vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The HOMO energy level of NI-T-NI was determined to be −6.07 eV according to the equation EHOMO = −e[Eox + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)]. The LUMO level of NI-T-NI was calculated to be −3.53 eV using the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt. Similarly, HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PCDTBT-C12 were determined to be −5.23 and −3.26 eV, respectively. The data are also summarized in Table 1. The offset of the LUMO between NI-T-NI and PCDTBT-C12 is 0.27 eV, which is large enough for efficient charge separation at the donor–acceptor interface.27 Due to the fairly high-lying LUMO energy level (−3.53 eV) of NI-T-NI in comparison with that of PC71BM (−4.04 eV), a high Voc is expected for NI-T-NI based solar cells.28

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of NI-T-NI and PCDTBT-C12 were investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that NI-T-NI and PCDTBT-C12 possess good thermal stability with 5% weight loss at 402 and 325 °C, respectively. Such a high decomposition temperature for NI-T-NI makes it suitable for the application in polymer solar cells. As shown in Fig. 3, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that NI-T-NI exhibited a good crystallinity with a melting peak at 186.7 °C and a crystallization peak at 152.2 °C. There was no obvious glass transition observed for PCDTBT-C12 in the temperature range from 20 to 250 °C. The formation of H-aggregates by NI-T-NI is beneficial for enhancing the electron mobility in the blend film, resulting in balanced electron and hole mobility (vide infra).20

Photovoltaic properties
To examine the photovoltaic properties of NI-T-NI as the acceptor material, devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI/LiF (0.7 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated. The weight ratio of PCDTBT-C12 to NI-T-NI and thermal annealing treatment were investigated to optimize the photovoltaic performance. DCB was used as the processing solvent because it is a good solvent for both materials. Devices fabricated using a donor–acceptor blend ratio of 1:1 produced a low PCE of 0.16% with a Voc of 1.10 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 0.69 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.21 under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Reducing the weight ratio of PCDTBT-C12 led to an obvious improvement of PCEs, which were enhanced to 0.84%, 0.97%, and 1.12% for devices fabricated in a weight ratio of 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4, respectively. When blend films with a PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI weight ratio of 1:4 were annealed at 90 °C for 3 min before the deposition of the cathode, improved photovoltaic performance with a high Voc of 1.30 V, a Jsc of 2.91 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.53, and a PCE of 2.01% was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, such a high Voc is the highest record for single layer organic solar cells. The obvious enhancement of Voc, Jsc and FF after thermal annealing treatment could be attributed to the better electrode contact and charge transport caused by the improved blend film morphology. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of devices under the optimum conditions are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Furthermore, photovoltaic performance was periodically tested to investigate the stability (Fig. S6, ESI†). Devices based on PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI exhibited good stability and still retained at least 88% of PCE after 7 days.

To examine the veracity of Jsc, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of devices before and after annealing was measured. As shown in Fig. 4b, the EQE of devices showed a broad spectrum response from 350 to 650 nm. The maximum EQE value before annealing was 25% at 400 nm, indicating that the absorptions of PCDTBT-C12 and NI-T-NI both contributed to the photocurrent generation. After thermal annealing, the overall EQE was increased with a maximum value of 30% at 404 nm. Jsc values calculated from the integration of EQE curves agree well with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurement.
Transport properties
To investigate the influence of PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI weight ratio and thermal annealing on the charge transport, hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) of PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI blend films were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI/Au (100 nm) and electron-only devices with a configuration of FTO/PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI/Al (100 nm) were fabricated. Dark J–V curves of devices were fitted by using the Mott–Gurney equation: J = 9εoεrμV2/8L3, where J is the space charge limited current, εo is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the permittivity of the active layer, μ is the hole mobility or the electron mobility, and L is the thickness of the active layer. As shown in Fig. 5, μh values of plain devices with donor–acceptor weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 were calculated to be 5.3 × 10−8, 4.4 × 10−7, 4.7 × 10−7, and 1.2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Similarly, μe values of plain devices with donor–acceptor weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 were calculated to be 1.33 × 10−10, 2.67 × 10−9, 8.56 × 10−9, and 1.56 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

Increasing the weight ratio of the acceptor could enhance the electron mobility to some extent. However, μh and μe are still not balanced. After thermal annealing at 90 °C for 3 min, μh of devices with a donor–acceptor blend ratio of 1:4 was slightly enhanced to 6.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1; but μe was dramatically improved to 2.56 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. After thermal treatment, μe and μh became more balanced, which is beneficial for increasing Jsc and FF values. As for the plain devices, the unbalanced electron/hole mobility usually led to low Jsc and FF.26,29
Film morphology
High efficiency organic solar cells require the donor and acceptor to form an interpenetrated network to facilitate the transport of electrons and holes in the active layer. The morphology of the active layer has a significant influence on the performance of photovoltaic devices. To study the influence of thermal annealing on the morphology of active layers, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used. As shown in Fig. 6, the AFM images demonstrated that there is no significant difference in the morphology of blend films before and after thermal annealing treatment. Fortunately, the TEM investigations showed that the thermal annealing treatment could partly promote the aggregation and phase separation of the blend film as shown in Fig. 7. Because crystalline NI-T-NI aggregates exhibit a higher electron scattering density than amorphous PCDTBT-C12 aggregates,26 the black domains were formed, as shown in Fig. 7b, after thermal annealing could be ascribed to the H-aggregates of NI-T-NI molecules. The formation of more H-aggregates by NI-T-NI molecules after thermal annealing is beneficial for the electron transport in the active layer.20

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have used DCHA to synthesize a new small molecular acceptor NI-T-NI, which is composed of a central thiophene core and two 1,8-naphthalimide terminal groups. NI-T-NI exhibits good crystallinity and can form H-aggregates in the solid state. Compared with PCBM, NI-T-NI exhibits a rather high-lying LUMO level, which is beneficial for achieving high Voc. The thermal annealing treatment could induce an aggregation of NI-T-NI in the blend film, which could promote the formation of a better phase separation and obtaining a higher μe. A PCE of 2.01% with a high Voc of 1.30 V was obtained for PSCs with the PCDTBT-C12:NI-T-NI blend film as the active layer. To the best of our knowledge, a Voc of 1.30 V is one of the highest values reported for single junction organic solar cells. This result also demonstrates that 1,8-naphthalimide could be a useful building block for the synthesis of promising acceptor materials for PSCs.
