    , Accepted 22nd March 2019First published on 23rd March 2019AbstractPrecise control of the interface in a solid-state heterojunction Z-scheme photocatalyst is important for achieving the intended photocatalytic activity. Herein, we have designed a photocatalyst with a hierarchical structure by photodepositing gold (Au) on the (040) facet of decahedral bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) and then loading zinc rhodium oxide (ZnRh2O4) on the Au surface. Owing to the facet-dependent charge separation property of the decahedral BiVO4, photoexcited electrons in BiVO4 accumulate at the (040) facet and then transfer to Au, which acts as a solid electron mediator, to combine with holes of ZnRh2O4. Utilizing the thus-constructed Z-scheme photocatalyst (ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4), the simultaneous liberation of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) from water at a molar ratio of 2:1 was achieved under irradiation with visible light up to a wavelength of 540 nm, whereas neither H2 nor O2 was produced when Au was deposited randomly on the BiVO4 surface. This study provides insight into the rational design of a solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst using facet-controlled nanoparticles to enhance photocatalytic activity.
Introduction
As a sustainable and carbon-neutral energy carrier, hydrogen (H2) has attracted much attention.1–3 Since Fujishima and Honda reported photoelectrochemical water splitting in 1972,4 photocatalytic water splitting with solar light has been regarded as one of the most promising ways of producing H2 from renewable resources.5–9 To achieve efficient solar water splitting, it is important to utilize a wide range of the solar light spectrum up to the visible region because visible light accounts for about half of the energy in sunlight. A two-step photoexcitation system based on the “Z-scheme” of natural photosynthesis was developed as a rational strategy to split water into H2 and oxygen (O2) under visible light.10–13 A typical Z-scheme water-splitting system consists of two different photocatalysts (one for H2 evolution and the other for O2 evolution) and a redox mediator. The redox mediator transports photoexcited electrons from the conduction band (CB) of the O2-evolution photocatalyst to the valence band (VB) of the H2-evolution photocatalyst to complete the catalytic cycle of overall water splitting. Recently, we have developed a solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst in which a solid electron mediator is inserted between the H2- and O2-evolution photocatalysts.14–18 The use of a solid electron mediator such as gold (Au) or silver (Ag) nanoparticles instead of a soluble redox-shuttle molecule can suppress undesirable backward reactions and improve charge separation, resulting in the enhanced water-splitting activity. When Au nanoparticles were employed as a linker between bismuth vanadate (Bi4V2O11) and zinc rhodium oxide (ZnRh2O4), the obtained Z-scheme photocatalyst splits water under visible light of wavelengths up to 740 nm owing to the effective charge separation by Au nanoparticles.18
Morphology engineering that can provide selectively exposed crystal facets has been proved effective for promoting charge separation.19–22 Li and co-workers reported that spatial charge separation occurred on decahedral bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) in which the (040) and (110) facets provided reduction and oxidation sites, respectively.23,24 Tachikawa and co-workers observed that photogenerated holes were preferentially trapped on the (110) facet by using single-particle photoluminescence spectroscopy.25 On the basis of both theoretical and experimental studies, this facet-dependent charge separation property has been considered to originate from the different energy levels of the CB and VB for the two facets.23–27 Thus, metal nanoparticles can be deposited selectively on the (040) facet through the photochemical reduction of metal cations, and the deposited nanoparticles are useful as cocatalysts28,29 and solid electron conductors.30–33 To date, several hierarchical solid-state Z-scheme photocatalysts have been developed using photodeposited metal nanoparticles as a solid electron conductor because electron accumulation on the (040) facet of BiVO4 allows effective electron injection into the metal nanoparticles.30–33 The constructed Z-scheme photocatalysts showed good performance in the degradation of pollutants and O2 evolution; however, overall water splitting, which is thermodynamically more difficult than the above reactions, has not been achieved.
Herein, we designed a solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst, in which decahedral BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 serve as visible-light-sensitive O2- and H2-evolution photocatalysts, respectively. By using Au nanoparticles photodeposited on the (040) facet of BiVO4 as a solid electron mediator, we constructed a hierarchical structure. The utilization of such a hierarchical structure and the facet-dependent charge separation property is considered to allow more efficient photoexcited electron transfer from the O2-evolution photocatalyst to the H2-evolution photocatalyst compared with previous solid-state Z-scheme photocatalysts. In fact, we demonstrate that the synthesized Z-scheme photocatalyst shows enhanced photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting under visible light. The enhanced activity of the Z-scheme photocatalyst can be attributed to efficient charge separation between BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4.
Experimental
Chemicals
Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3, 99.9%) was purchased from Kojundo Chemical. Vanadium oxide (V2O5, 99.0%), zinc oxide (ZnO, 99.0%), rhodium oxide (Rh2O3, 99.9%), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III)tetrahydrate (HAuCl4·4H2O, 99.0%), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99.5%), ammonium vanadate (NH4VO3, 99.0%), sodium iodate (NaIO3, 99.5%), iodine (I2, 99.8%), and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 99.0%) were purchased from Kanto Kagaku. Au nanoparticles were purchased from Aldrich. All the chemicals were used as-received without further purification. The water used was purified through a Millipore system.
Synthesis
Decahedral BiVO4 was synthesized using a solid–liquid reaction reported in the literature.34,35 Typically, 4.66 g of Bi2O3 and 1.82 g of V2O5 were dispersed in 50 mL of 0.81 M HNO3. Subsequently, the solution was heated to 70 °C in a water bath and continuously stirred. The color of the solution gradually changed from orange to yellow. After stirring for 48 h, the solution was naturally cooled down to room temperature then filtered and washed with water. The collected yellow powder was dried at 60 °C in an oven. Spherical BiVO4 (sp-BiVO4) was synthesized by adding 2.43 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 0.585 g of NH4VO3 to 100 mL of water while stirring.36 After 4 h, the yellow powder was collected by filtration, washed with water, dried, and then calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. ZnRh2O4 was synthesized by a solid-state reaction.37 0.321 g of ZnO and 1.00 g of Rh2O3 were wet ball-milled for 20 h in a polyethylene bottle using zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) balls as the milling medium. The resulting mixture was calcined at 1000 °C for 24 h under atmospheric conditions and then thoroughly ground to obtain ZnRh2O4 powder.
Au was photodeposited on BiVO4 as follows. 300 mg of BiVO4 or sp-BiVO4 powder was suspended in 100 mL of 17.6 μM HAuCl4 aqueous solution. The suspension was then deaerated with a vacuum pump and illuminated with a xenon (Xe) lamp (LA-251 Xe; Hayashi Tokei) equipped with an optical filter (>460 nm, Y-48, Hoya) for 6 h. During the photodeposition, the flask of the suspension was continuously rotated to illuminate the powder uniformly. The powder was then collected by filtration, washed, and dried at 60 °C overnight. The Au-modified BiVO4 and sp-BiVO4 are hereafter denoted as Au/BiVO4 and Au/sp-BiVO4, respectively. When commercial Au nanoparticles were used, BiVO4 was mixed with the Au nanoparticles in acetone and then calcined at 550 °C for 2 h (ran-Au/BiVO4). The amount of Au nanoparticles added was adjusted to match the amount of Au deposited on Au/BiVO4.
For the construction of a Z-scheme composite, either Au/BiVO4, Au/sp-BiVO4, or ran-Au/BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 were mixed in acetone at a BiVO4:ZnRh2O4 molar ratio of 2:1. The ratio of 2:1 was selected because of the difference in light absorption ability between BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4. The resulting mixture was calcined at 550 °C for 2 h under atmospheric conditions. Each prepared heterojunction photocatalyst is hereafter denoted as ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4, ZnRh2O4/Au/sp-BiVO4, or ZnRh2O4/ran-Au/BiVO4.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a PW-1700 system (PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the prepared samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6500F, JEOL). Optical absorption spectra were measured in diffuse reflectance (DR) mode using a UV-vis spectrometer (V-650, JASCO) with barium sulfate (BaSO4) as the reflectance standard. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (AXIS-ULTRA, KRATOS). The C 1s peak (284.6 eV) was used as an internal energy reference in all the experiments. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of the samples was determined using a nitrogen (N2) adsorption apparatus (Tristar 3000, Shimadzu). Elemental analysis was conducted by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, SPS3520UV-DD, Hitachi).
Mott–Schottky analysis was carried out using a commercial potentiostat and a potential programmer (HZ-5000, Hokuto Denko) equipped with a frequency response analyzer. A platinum (Pt) wire and a silver/silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl/KCl(sat.)) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte was 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH 6.8) and was purged with argon (Ar) prior to each experiment. The working electrode was prepared by an electrophoretic deposition method using acetone solution (30 mL) containing 50 mg of photocatalyst powder and 30 mg of iodine. Two parallel fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates were immersed in the solution with a 10 mm distance, and a 6 V bias was applied between them for 5 min. After that, the electrode was annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in air.
Photocatalytic activity measurement
The photocatalytic overall water-splitting activity was evaluated using a closed gas circulation system. 60 mg of photocatalyst powder and 12 mL of purified water were introduced into a reaction cell. A Xe lamp with an optical filter (>420 nm, Y-44, Hoya) was used as a light source. Before irradiation, the dissolved O2 was removed by repeated freeze–pump (2.5 Pa)–thaw cycles, and finally Ar gas (50 kPa) was introduced. The amounts of evolved H2 and O2 were monitored using an online gas chromatograph (GC-8A, Shimadzu). When N2 was unexpectedly detected during photocatalysis, the amount of evolved O2 was calculated using the equation O2 = obs. O2 − (obs. N2/0.78) × 0.21 because the detected N2 is considered to have originated from external air.
The action spectrum for the photocatalytic overall water-splitting was obtained using light-emitting diode (LED) lamps with wavelengths of 420, 470, 505, 545, and 610 nm (LEDH60-420, LEDH60-470, LEDH60-505, LEDH60-545, and LEDH60-610, respectively, Hamamatsu Photonics). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated using the amount of evolved O2 and the equation AQE (%) = 100 × 8 × O2 generation rate/incident photon rate, because O2 generation in the two-step system is an eight-hole process. The action spectrum for O2 evolution was measured in 3 mL of 10 mM NaIO3 aqueous solution containing 30 mg of BiVO4 or Au/BiVO4. The pH of the solution was not adjusted prior to the measurement, which was performed under illumination with monochromatic light (410, 470, 530, 590, and 650 nm; the wavelength accuracy was FWHM: ca. 15 nm) generated from a diffraction grating-type illuminator (CRM-FD, JASCO) equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (C2578-02, Hamamatsu Photonics). Higher-order diffracted light was cut off with an appropriate glass filter. The amount of evolved O2 was monitored using a gas chromatograph and AQE was obtained using the equation AQE (%) = 100 × 4 × O2 generation rate/incident photon rate.
Results
Crystal phase and composition

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of BiVO4, ZnRh2O4, and ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4. The XRD pattern of BiVO4 is well indexed to monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS 14-0688) and no peak originating from Bi2O3 or V2O5 was observed, indicating that Bi2O3 and V2O5 were completely converted to BiVO4. The XRD pattern of ZnRh2O4 is consistent with that of previously reported cubic ZnRh2O4. Characteristic peaks of both BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 are observed in the XRD pattern of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4, which confirms that the crystal structures of BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 were retained. In contrast, the relative intensity of the diffraction peak corresponding to the (040) facet of BiVO4 weakened after Au deposition (Fig. S1†) and ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 composite formation. This suggests that the (040) facet of BiVO4 was modified with Au and ZnRh2O4,32 which can be seen in the following SEM images. The absence of diffraction peaks of Au for ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 was due to the small crystallite size and the low deposition content of Au. The presence of Au on BiVO4 was confirmed by ICP-AES measurements and its loading amount was determined to be 0.10 wt%.

Electron microscopy observation
The morphology of the synthesized samples was characterized by SEM observation and representative images are shown in Fig. 2. The BiVO4 particles had a decahedral shape composed of the (040) and (110) facets (Fig. 2a). In accordance with the literature, the flat surfaces at the top and bottom of a decahedral particle were assigned to the (040) facet, where photoexcited electrons accumulated.23–27 The SEM image of Au/BiVO4 (Fig. 2b) clarified that Au nanoparticles with diameters from 50 to 150 nm were deposited on the (040) facet of BiVO4 whereas no nanoparticles were deposited on the (110) facet. These results indicate that photoexcited electrons migrated to the (040) facet and reduced Au3+ to Au, which coincides with previous reports.23–27 After Au/BiVO4 was combined with spherical ZnRh2O4 with a diameter of about 200 nm, it was observed that the bound ZnRh2O4 particles were predominantly located at the (040) facet of BiVO4, indicating that Au nanoparticles act as a linker between BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 (Fig. 2c). Note that the BiVO4 particles maintained their decahedral shape during the synthesis of BiVO4/Au/ZnRh2O4. In contrast, when BiVO4 was calcined at temperatures higher than 550 °C, deformation of the BiVO4 crystals was observed (Fig. S2†). Thus, a hierarchically structured ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 photocatalyst was obtained.

Optical properties and band structure

Fig. 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of BiVO4, Au/BiVO4, ZnRh2O4, and ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4. BiVO4 absorbed visible light up to a wavelength of about 550 nm whereas Au/BiVO4 showed an extra broad absorption peak, which is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of Au nanoparticles.33,38–40 ZnRh2O4 exhibited strong absorption in the entire wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm (ref. 37) and the absorption spectrum of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 was nearly identical to that of ZnRh2O4. This is reasonable because the dark brown ZnRh2O4 rather than the yellow BiVO4 dominates in terms of light absorption characteristics when the two are mixed. The absence of SPR absorption in the spectrum of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 is considered to be due to the coverage of the Au surface by ZnRh2O4, which prevented the SPR effect.

Taking into the consideration the fact that BiVO4 is an indirect band gap semiconductor, its band gap (Eg) can be estimated to be 2.4 eV (ref. 30–32) from the plot of (hνα)1/2versus photon energy. For ZnRh2O4, Eg was reported to be 1.2 eV,37 which corresponds to the wide absorption observed in Fig. 3. The band structures of BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 were estimated from the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 4). The positive and negative slopes of the tangent lines indicate that BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 are n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively. Furthermore, from the x-intercept of the tangent line, the flat-band potential (Vfb) of BiVO4 was found to be −0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 6.8), which is similar to the reported value.41 The Vfb for ZnRh2O4 was estimated to be −0.20 V under the same conditions. Thus, the band alignment of BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 is shown in Fig. 5, and ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 is considered to function as a Z-type photocatalyst because the CB of BiVO4 is located at a more negative potential than the VB of ZnRh2O4.

Water splitting
The photocatalytic water-splitting activity of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 was examined under visible light (>420 nm) irradiation. As shown in Fig. 6 (circles), ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 splits water into H2 and O2 at a stoichiometric ratio. In contrast, neither H2 generation nor O2 generation occurred when a photocatalyst prepared by directly linking ZnRh2O4 and BiVO4 without Au was employed (Fig. S3†). These results indicate that Au nanoparticles are indispensable as an electron medium in this Z-scheme photocatalytic system.
 Fig. 6  Time courses of photocatalytic evolution of H2 (red circles) and O2 (blue circles) over ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 irradiated with visible light (>420 nm). The amounts of H2 (red) and O2 (blue) generated over ZnRh2O4/Au/sp-BiVO4 (triangles) and ZnRh2O4/ran-Au/BiVO4 (squares) are shown for comparison. 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical structure for enhancing the water-splitting activity of a solid-state heterojunction photocatalyst, a Z-scheme photocatalyst using spherical BiVO4 instead of decahedral BiVO4 was also prepared, denoted as ZnRh2O4/Au/sp-BiVO4 (Fig. S4–S6†). In the experiment using ZnRh2O4/Au/sp-BiVO4, stoichiometric water splitting was achieved; however, its reaction rate was less than half that of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 (triangles, Fig. 6) in spite of that the specific surface area of sp-BiVO4 (0.353 m2 g−1) was more than 3 times larger than that of BiVO4 (0.102 m2 g−1). Furthermore, the merit of the hierarchical structure was also confirmed by an experiment using ZnRh2O4/ran-Au/BiVO4, in which Au nanoparticles were randomly deposited on both the (040) and (110) facets (Fig. S4–S6†). In this case, even though BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 were linked, neither H2 nor O2 was produced (squares, Fig. 6). Therefore, the obtained results demonstrated that linking BiVO4 with ZnRh2O4 through Au nanoparticles deposited on the (040) facet is beneficial for obtaining an active Z-scheme photocatalyst.
Reaction mechanism of the solid Z-scheme composite
In the photocatalytic experiment, ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 showed overall water-splitting activity under visible light. On the basis of the characterization results of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 and its similarity to the Z-scheme photocatalyst that we previously developed,14–18 a possible reaction mechanism of photocatalytic water splitting is shown in Fig. 5. By irradiating visible light, both ZnRh2O4 and BiVO4 are photoexcited, and then photoexcited electrons and holes are generated in their CB and VB, respectively. Here, the inserted metal Au acts as a charge recombination center. Namely, electrons in the CB of BiVO4 flow into Au because the CB of BiVO4 is located at a more negative potential than the Fermi level of the Au nanoparticles. In particular, owing to the lower energy level of the CB of the (040) facet, photoexcited electrons of BiVO4 smoothly transfer to Au on the (040) facet. The injected electrons are stored in the lowest unoccupied orbital of Au and then raise the Fermi level.42,43 Once the Fermi level of Au shifts to a more negative potential than that of the VB of ZnRh2O4, holes in the VB of ZnRh2O4 move to Au. Hence, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of BiVO4 and holes in the VB of ZnRh2O4 are annihilated in metal Au nanoparticles. As a result, strongly reductive electrons and oxidative holes remaining in the CB of ZnRh2O4 and the VB of BiVO4 drive H2 and O2 evolution, respectively. Since both the CB and VB of ZnRh2O4 are composed of rhodium (Rh) 4d orbitals, the oxidation state of the Rh ion might change during photocatalysis; however, no change was observed in the XPS spectra before and after the photocatalysis (Fig. S7†), confirming that ZnRh2O4 is stable.
To validate this reaction mechanism, we examined the action spectrum for water splitting by ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 (Fig. 7a). AQE was calculated using the O2 evolution rate and the number of incident photons measured at each examined wavelength (Table S1†). Since H2 and O2 evolution rates were 2:1 for all wavelengths (Fig. 7b–e), the obtained AQEs for O2 evolution were almost the same as those for H2 evolution. The thus-obtained action spectrum of water splitting had a similar shape to the UV-vis spectrum of BiVO4. This indicates that water splitting proceeded upon the excitation of both BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 as described above. The need for the excitation of both photocatalysts was also confirmed from the fact that neither H2 nor O2 was detected in the presence of either BiVO4 or ZnRh2O4 alone. Similarly, the insertion of Au nanoparticles between BiVO4 and ZnRh2O4 was found to be essential to achieve water splitting from the result for the directly connected sample. Recently, Misawa and co-workers have demonstrated photocatalytic O2 evolution by Au nanoparticles on a TiO2 electrode.44,45 In their system, electron injection from Au to the CB of TiO2 occurred as a result of SPR excitation, and the resultant holes on the Au nanoparticles oxidized water to O2. Thus, the Au nanoparticles of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 might function not only as an electron mediator but also as a light absorber because they showed SPR absorption in the visible light region. However, as shown in Fig. 8, ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 split water under irradiation up to a wavelength of 540 nm, corresponding to the onset of the absorption spectrum of BiVO4. In the wavelength region where SPR absorption appeared in the spectrum of Au/BiVO4, neither H2 nor O2 was detected. Therefore, we consider that the Au nanoparticles of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 served as an electron mediator. In contrast, interestingly, the action spectrum for O2 evolution in the presence of IO3− revealed that Au/BiVO4 generated O2 by SPR excitation in addition to the band gap excitation of BiVO4. The observed difference in the response to the SPR excitation between ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 and Au/BiVO4 could originate from two reasons. First, as observed in the SEM images and UV-vis spectrum, the Au surface of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 was covered with ZnRh2O4, which may have impeded the SPR effect as well as the approach of water molecules. Second, in the absence of IO3−, excited electrons can only be consumed during H2 evolution. Since the reduction power of electrons in the CB of BiVO4 is insufficient to evolve H2, it is necessary to inject electrons from Au to the CB of ZnRh2O4 for overall water splitting, which is energetically more severe than the injection to the CB of BiVO4.

Regarding the water splitting on ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4, the linking of BiVO4 with Au and ZnRh2O4 at the (040) facet of BiVO4 was found to be effective for obtaining higher activity. The slight difference in the energy level of the CB between the (040) and (110) facets promotes the accumulation of excited electrons at the (040) facet, which should lead to efficient electron injection from BiVO4 into Au. Recently, Zhu and co-workers reported that the built-in electric field causes a potential difference of approximately 170 mV between the CB of the (040) and (110) facets of BiVO4 modified with MnOx and Pt nanoparticles.27 Such a potential difference accelerates charge separation and an excited electron preferentially moves to the (040) facet. On the other hand, the downward shift of the potential by the built-in potential should not prevent electron transfer from the CB of BiVO4 to the VB of ZnRh2O4 because the potential of the CB of the (040) facet is sufficiently more negative than that of the VB of ZnRh2O4. Consequently, the hierarchical structure constructed on the basis of the facet-dependent charge separation property enhanced the water-splitting activity of ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4.
Conclusions
We developed a hierarchically structured Z-scheme photocatalyst composed of decahedral BiVO4, ZnRh2O4, and Au. By utilizing the photodeposited Au nanoparticles as a linker, we unidirectionally deposited Au and ZnRh2O4 on the (040) facet of BiVO4. The synthesized ZnRh2O4/Au/BiVO4 photocatalyst accomplished overall water splitting under visible light irradiation with a wavelength of up to 540 nm, and the activity was much higher than that when Au nanoparticles were randomly precipitated on BiVO4. The enhanced water-splitting activity is attributed to facet-induced charge separation in BiVO4 and efficient electron transfer from BiVO4 to Au through the (040) facet, where photoexcited electrons preferentially accumulate. In the present study, we could enhance the water-splitting capability of a solid-state heterojunction photocatalyst using a facet-exposed O2-evolution photocatalyst. To further improve the photocatalytic activity, the use of a facet-defined H2-evolution photocatalyst is promising since hole transfer from the VB of a H2-evolution photocatalyst to a solid electron mediator also plays an important role in the Z-scheme photocatalyst. Recently, the synthesis of a cuprous oxide (Cu2O) crystal with exposed anisotropic facets has been reported, which exhibited spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes between different facets.46 Moreover, Cu2O is also a p-type semiconductor that functions as a visible-light sensitive H2-evolution and CO2 reduction photocatalyst.47,48 Therefore, a solid-state heterojunction photocatalyst prepared utilizing facet-controlled BiVO4 and Cu2O would enable more efficient photogenerated charge carrier separation and water splitting, studies of which are currently under way in our laboratory. In addition, although we fixed the ratio of H2- and O2-evolution photocatalysts in this study, optimization of the ratio will allow further improvement of the photocatalytic activity.
