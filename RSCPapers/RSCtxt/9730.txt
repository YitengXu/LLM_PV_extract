1 Introduction
A nanosystem is an integration of multi-functional nanodevices with the capability of sensing, controlling, communicating and responding. Their low power consumption makes it possible to use the energy harvesting from otherwise wasted energy in the environment to power them. Electric power on the microwatts scale is usually necessary for independent, sustainable, maintenance-free operations of implantable biosensors, remote and mobile environmental sensors, nanorobotics, micro-electro-mechanical systems, and other self-powered nanosystems.
In recent years, the combination of nanotechnology and piezoelectric technology has resulted in a new class of piezoelectric nano-structures (PNs). They exhibit enhanced piezoelectric effect, excellent resilience and the unique coupling between piezoelectric and semiconducting properties. The self-powering capability of PNs allows electronic devices to exclude energy storage components, and holds great promises for directly drawing energy from ambient mechanical resources, powering small electronics and achieving self-powered electronic devices. This distinct feature makes them attractive for a wide range of applications in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), such as nanosensors/transducers, nanogenerators, nanoresonators, diodes, and piezoelectric field-effect transistors.1–5 An intriguing possibility is the utilization of work produced by the human body via daily activities.6–8
To date, these PNs have been synthesized in various configurations such as nanowires, nanofilms, nanoplates, nanoribbons, and nanorings. Since Wang and Song's pioneering work9 on the first nanogenerator prototype using piezoelectric nanowires for converting mechanical energy into electricity, there has been an increasing interest in investigating various technologies, including theoretical calculations and experimental characterization methods, to promote the development of self-powered PNs. To quote only a very few works in this direction, let us mention ref. 10–15.
The experimental work on PNs has been reported by many researchers, and the recent review of Xu and Wang16 should be mentioned. However, only the experimental progress that has been made within the context of on one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures was given in ref. 16.
With the advent of other building blocks of nanogenerators, lots of experimental characterization methods have been proposed recently. In addition, many fundamental theories about nanosized piezoelectric structures are raised to optimize the design of different PNs, and prompt the further development of new nanogenerators. To date, the theoretical work has mainly focused on the coupling surface/interface theory17,18 and the theory of nonlocal piezoelectricity.19 The coupling surface/interface theory of stress and electric displacement plays an important role in the electromechanical energy conversion technologies. The theory of nonlocal piezoelectricity can provide a foundation for increasing the strength and electric potential of PNs.
Most recently, PNs have attracted more and more concerns not only in the research of nanoelectromechanical systems, but also in the fundamental theories in piezoelectric nanotechnology. To promote the further investigation of PNs, a systematic review of the fundamental development in recent years is demonstrated in this work, and some practical models and growth mechanisms of PNs will be reviewed, and the perspective of this novel technique will be discussed.
2 Types of PNs
Under external force, a deformation inside piezoelectric nano-structured materials will occur. Then, a piezoelectric potential can be generated on the side surfaces due to crystal lattice distortion. The electrical potential can be used to power nanodevices. Based on the dimensions of PNs, they are classified into the following four main types.
2.1 Zero-dimensional (0D) PNs
Zero-dimensional piezoelectric nanomaterials are the foundation of many other types of PNs. They include nanocluster materials and nanodispersions, i.e., piezoelectric materials in which nanoparticles are isolated from each other, as shown in Fig. 1. Piezoelectric nanoparticles often possess nonlinear optical, pyroelectric, magnetic, or ferroelectric properties. Only in recent years have zero-dimensional piezoelectric nanocomposites attracted more attention.
 Fig. 1  Zero-dimensional PNs. 
By introducing rough Al powders into an N2 thermal plasma jet, Tian et al.20 first developed Al nanoparticles with a small fraction of AlN. From the presence of nanoparticles, Tang et al. identified that the growth mechanism of the as-synthesized AlN nanowires was largely based on a vapor–liquid–solid process.21 By using a solvent casting method, magnetoelectric (ME) nanocomposite films composed of magnetostrictive CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with sizes between 35 and 55 nm embedded in P(VDF-TrFE) have been successfully prepared.22 It was discovered that ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties can be improved when a small amount of ferrite nanoparticles is added to the polymeric matrix. The inorganic BaTiO3 nanoparticles dispersed into the organic matrix was described by Capsal et al., and it is found that the dielectric permittivity of the composite highly increases with the volume fraction of nanoparticles.23
Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanoparticles deposited on epitaxial substrates of SrRuO3 and La1−xSrxMnO3 were studied using band excitation piezoelectric response spectroscopy, piezoelectric response force microscopy, and ferromagnetic resonance.24 The dimensionality of domains within nanoparticles was found to be fractal in nature. Ferromagnetic resonance studies indicate that BiFeO3 nanoparticles only weakly affect the magnetic response of La1−xSrxMnO3. The fabrication and piezoelectric characterization of poly(vinylidene fluoride)–trifluoroethylene (PVDF–TrFE) thin films enhanced with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were proposed by Dodds et al.25 The results show that the incorporation of piezoelectric ZnO nanoparticles will enhance the bulk film piezoelectricity while preserving the mechanical flexibility of PVDF–TrFE. Prashanthi et al. integrated the ZnO nanoparticles into a photosensitive SU-8 polymer matrix to retain the highly desired piezoelectric properties of ZnO, and combined the photopatternability and the optical transparency of the SU-8 polymer.26 Hadji et al. applied the alumina nanoparticles dispersed in the copolymer P(VDF-TrFE) to obtain the high piezoelectric coefficient.27 Ahmed et al. investigated the nanoparticles of DySrIG, and found that they possess an electric memory effect with thermalization, where their dielectric parameters have sensitive changes with temperature in the range 25–400 °C and return to their original values at room temperature again.28 Fu et al. developed a new separator for lithium-ion batteries by depositing SiO2 ceramic layers of nanoparticles onto the polypropylene separators and using a simple yet effective SiO2 formation and deposition process.29 (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 doped with 8 mol% BaTiO3 particles with average size of 50 nm was compacted and sintered by spark-plasma-sintering method, and it is found that increasing the sintering temperature from 800 to 900 °C can lead to the increase of piezoelectric coefficient d33.30
2.2 One-dimensional (1D) PNs
One-dimensional (1D) PNs typically have a character dimension less than 100 nm and a length more than 1 mm. One-dimensional (1D) PNs (ZnO nanowires) created the first nanogenerator prototype that converted ultrasonic waves into electricity.31 It is known that PNs most frequently used in self-powered nanosystems are piezoelectric nanowires.
In recent years, nano-wires (NWs) have found the most common applications. One-dimensional PNs offer the additional potential advantage of improved charge transport over zero-dimensional nanostructures such as nanocrystals. Compared with two-dimensional PNs, one-dimensional PNs used for mechanical energy scavenging have three unique advantages: enhanced piezoelectric effect, superior mechanical properties, and high sensitivity to small forces.
Up to now, ZnO nanowires (NWs) have been the one-dimensional PNs with the most interest. They are active components in applications such as piezoelectric nanogenerators, because the most critical piezoelectric polarization direction of ZnO NWs in applications is the c-axis. Most recently, Xu and Wang have presented a comprehensive overview of the progress that has been made in the one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures.16
To date, most of one-dimensional PNs are of circular, rectangle, or hexagonal cross-sections, as shown in Fig. 2. Most recently, lots of nanowires have been proposed, for example, ZnO nanowires,9,32–49 and nanotubes,50–56 ZnO nanobelts,57–67 ZnO nanorods,68,69 aluminum nitride (AlN) nanowires,3,70,71 PZT nanofibers,72 and BaTiO3 nanowires.73–75 It was shown that ZnO nanotubes were approximately five times more flexible than the corresponding nanowires, which leads to the enhanced output voltage in nanogenerators.1 It is found that ZnO nanowires are superior over zincblende AlN and GaN wires for piezoelectric energy harvesting,76 so most research activities mainly focused on the piezoelectric ZnO nanowires. In addition, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers possess good piezoelectric property, and are attractive in energy conversion applications between electric and mechanical forms because of their low cost, high flexibility and biocompatibility.77

Most recently, the first self-powered system that works wirelessly and independently for long distance data transmission was driven by a nanogenerator utilizing densely grown ZnO nanowire textured films.15
2.3 Two-dimensional (2D) PNs
Two-dimensional PNs are films (coatings) with nanometer thickness, as depicted in Fig. 3. Most recently, researchers have attempted to transfer piezoelectric nanoribbons and nanofilms, for example, PZT and BaTiO3 materials, onto flexible substrates for the purpose of utilizing the high electromechanical coupling of piezoelectric materials in conformable energy harvesting. Only some two-dimensional PNs have been proposed in recent years, i.e., PZT nanofilms,78,79 ZnO nanofilms,38,80 P(VDF-TrFE)–alumina nano-films,27,81,82 BaTiO3 nanofilms,83 and PZT ribbons.84,85
 Fig. 3  Two-dimensional PNs. 
Due to the high roughness factor and the large areas of exposed polar basal planes, the two-dimensional PNs show enhanced photocatalytic properties for decomposition of volatile organic compounds in comparison with common 1D nanowire arrays.
Nowadays, piezoelectric nanofilms and nanowires are regarded as suitable building blocks for most energy harvesting devices. In addition, as the size of piezoelectric structures is reduced to the nanoscale (thin films and nanowires), the conversion efficiency can be significantly improved for the following reasons: (i) piezoelectric nanocomposites tolerate relatively large deformations prior to failure, which is critical as the electrostatic potential generated is proportional to the applied strain and piezoelectric coefficient; (ii) material properties are enhanced at the nanoscale, which is relative to the surface/interface effects and high surface-to-volume ratios.47
2.4 Three-dimensional (3D) PNs
Three-dimensional PNs include piezoelectric powders, fibrous, multilayer and polycrystalline materials in which the 0D, 1D and 2D structural elements are in close contact with each other and form interfaces, as shown in Fig. 4. An important type of three-dimensional nanostructured material is a compact or consolidated (bulk) polycrystal with nanosize grains, whose entire volume is filled with those nanograins. Free surfaces of the grains are practically absent, and there are only grain interfaces. The electromechanical coupling of 3D PNs leads to a third rank tensor that possesses three independent coefficients, d33, d13, and d15. The formation of such surfaces/interfaces is the fundamental character of 3D PNs. Most recently, only Minary-Jolandan et al. have begun to explore the 3D piezoelectric effect of PNs.86 The results in ref. 86 demonstrate that these nanowires exhibit strong piezoelectricity in three-dimensions, with up to six times that of their bulk counterpart, and could have up to three times higher voltage generation.

3 Surface/interface piezoelectric model
It is well known that miniaturization of piezoelectric structures into a nanoscale size will significantly increase the surface-to-volume ratio. Due to the increasing ratio of surface/interface area to the volume of nanocomposites, the surfaces and interfaces may have significant effects on the physical and mechanical properties of piezoelectric structures, especially the converted electrostatic potential. The polarization discontinuity that occurs at the surface/interface between the two different materials accounts for the accumulation of electrostatic charges at the interfaces.
Modified continuum models with the incorporation of size effects in the conventional continuum framework have thus been attempted to interpret the size-dependent properties of various nanostructures. One modified continuum model is the coupling surface/interface model.
Compared with the overall behavior of conventional piezoelectric materials, the electrical and mechanical properties in the vicinity of surfaces/interfaces, as well as the coupling between piezoelectricity and elasticity therein are more complicated. Since the pioneering work on the conceptual idea of surface piezoelectricity17, which captures the essential physics of dielectrics, other nano-structures such as ferroelectric thin films87 and piezoelectric rings were further investigated. Recently, a more precise surface/interface model was proposed in ref. 88 and 89. In this model, the coupling effect of stress and electric displacement at the surfaces/interfaces is considered.
In the coupling surface/interface model, the surface energy density Γ depends not only on the surface strain, but also on the surface electric field. The surface/interface between the piezoelectric particle and the matrix is assumed to be coherent, and no atomic bonds are broken along the surface/interface. The surface/interface stresses σSαβ and surface electric displacements DSα are linked with the surface strain tensor εSαβ and surface electric field ESα by the following relations:90 (1)where δαβ is the Kronecker delta function, τ0 is the residual surface stress, and Dα0 is the residual surface electric displacement.
The equilibrium equations at the surface/interface can be expressed as89,90 σαjnj = σSαβ,α + tα,σijninj = σSαβζαβ + ti,(2) φi = ESα + χ,(3)where nj denotes the normal vector of the surface, ζαβ is the curvature of the surface, χ is the given electric potential, and tα is the negative of the tangential component of the traction. It is clear that the surface stress tensor is charge-dependent, and the surface electric field ESα is deformation dependent. The constitutive relations at the coupling surface/interface are written as:89,90 σSij = τ0δij + CSijklεSkl − eSkijESk, DSi = eSiklεSkl + ηSikESk,(4)where CSijkl is the two-dimensional surface elasticity tensor, eSkij is the surface piezoelectric stiffness tensor, or simply the surface piezoelectricity tensor, describing the linear superficial electromechanical coupling between the in-plane deformation and the normal electric polarization, and ηSik is the impermittivity or the inverse of permittivity tensor. Determination of CSijkl, eSkl, and ηSik often requires extensive atomistic simulations.
3.1 Material characterization using coupling surface/interface theory
In conventional continuum theories of piezoelectric structures, the variation of inter-atomic quantities is ignored. They cannot capture the atomic features of piezoelectric materials and describe the physical mechanisms of the surface/interface effects. Hence, they fail to predict the size-dependent material behavior when the characteristic size of piezoelectric structures scales down to the nanoscale. In addition, the existing experimental observations44,56,91 and atomistic simulations73,92 have demonstrated that the electromechanical properties of piezoelectric materials at the nanoscale are intrinsically size dependent. Therefore, capturing the nature of such size dependence is a new challenge in the theoretical modelling of PNs.
The outputting piezoelectric potential is an important character of nano-generators. So, it is very interesting to find ways of increasing the piezoelectric potential output of piezoelectric nano-structures. Based on the coupling surface/interface model, the size-dependent behavior of PNs is receiving more and more interest. For a piezoelectric matrix embedded with piezoelectric nano-fibers, the work of Chen,93 Xiao et al.,94 Zhang et al.,95 and Fang et al.96 should be mentioned. They presented the effective material properties of piezoelectric nano-structures. Chen and Xiao et al. mainly focused on the static electroelastic properties, however, Fang et al. paid attention to the dynamic electroelastic properties. Pan et al. investigated an infinite radially polarizable piezoelectric nanotube, the surface parameters on the electric potential and electric field were analyzed.89 By introducing the concept of “surface piezoelectricity”, Dai et al. discussed the renormalization of apparent piezoelectric behavior of three specific material systems (ZnO, SrTiO3, and BaTiO3).97
In addition, the strength resulting from the piezoelectric surface/interface is also attracting lots of attention. For the dynamic loadings, the dynamic strength around a piezoelectric nano-fiber,98 two piezoelectric nano-fibers,99 and a piezoelectric nano-particle89 has been investigated by Fang and his co-workers. Within the framework of couple stress, the effect of surface/interface around a nano-hole on the anti-plane electro-mechanical behaviour is examined in ref. 100.
3.2 Structural responses with piezoelectric surface/interface
To increase the stability of PNs, it is desirable to quantitatively understand the structural responses of them under external loads. To address the effect of the surface layers, the vibration and buckling behaviour of many PNs have been studied in recent years.
To date, the research mainly focused on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional piezoelectric nano-structures. For the one-dimensional case, the static deformation, axial buckling, and vibration of piezoelectric nanowires and piezoelectric nanobeams attracted more interest. Based on this surface/interface coupling model, Yan and Jiang investigated the electroelastic responses of nanowires101 and nanobeams102 under mechanical and electrical loads. Surface effects, including surface elasticity, residual surface stress and surface piezoelectricity, were all considered. It was found that the surface piezoelectricity has a more prominent effect on the deflection in comparison with the surface elasticity. By using the Euler–Bernoulli beam model, the influence of surface stresses on the vibration and buckling behavior of piezoelectric nanowires was studied, and it is found that the electric potential can reach several volts in experiments.103
For the two-dimensional case, the effect of surface piezoelectricity on the transverse vibration of piezoelectric nanofilms104 and nanoplates105–107 was studied, and the surface effects including surface elasticity, surface piezoelectricity, and residual surface stress on the wrinkling were presented. A sandwich-plate model was introduced to account for the effect of surface piezoelectricity on the transverse vibration of piezoelectric nanofilms with simply supported boundaries under an electrical voltage.108
4 Theory of nonlocal piezoelectricity
Another size-dependent continuum theory is the nonlocal piezoelectricity, and it has been regarded as an effective method to study the electroelastic properties of piezoelectric nanostructures. For conventional nanocomposites, the nonlocal elasticity theory proposed by Eringen109 has been widely accepted and applied to analyze the size effect of the nanostructures.
In the nonlocal piezoelectric theory, the key idea resides in the concept that the stress and electric displacement at a reference point depend not only on the strain components and electric-field components at the same position but also on all other points of the body. The scale coefficient regarded as a material parameter is introduced to incorporate the small scale factor. The nonlocal constitutive behavior can be represented by the following constitutive relation (5) (6)where σnlij(x) and σlij(x′) are, respectively, the nonlocal stress tensor and local stress tensor, Dnlk(x) and Dlk(x′) are, respectively, the components of the nonlocal and local electric displacement. α(|x′ − x|) is the nonlocal attenuation function which incorporates the constitutive equations at the reference point x produced by the local strain at the source x′, and ∣x′ − x∣ is the Euclidean distance.
Based on the nonlocal theory and Timoshenko beam theory, Ke and Wang investigated the thermoelectric-mechanical vibration of the piezoelectric nanobeams.110 The influences of the nonlocal parameter, temperature change, external electric voltage and axial force on the thermoelectric mechanical vibration characteristics of the piezoelectric nanobeams are discussed in detail.
Based on the nonlocal continuum piezoelasticity cylindrical shell theory, the transverse vibration analysis of fluid-conveying double-walled boron nitride nanotubes subjected to combined electro-thermal loadings was developed in ref. 111.
In addition, the nonlocal piezoelectricity theory and surface/interface piezoelectricity theory were combined to investigate the electromechanical coupling behavior of a cantilever piezoelectric nanowire, and an explicit formula for the electromechanical coupling coefficient of the piezoelectric nanowire was obtained.112
5 Effective material properties
These PNs exhibit enhanced piezoelectric effect, excellent resilience and the unique coupling between piezoelectric and semiconducting properties. Ideally, piezoelectric materials should possess higher piezoelectric potential to power the piezoelectric nanogenerators. The piezoelectric potential can be derived from the effective piezoelectric coefficient. The effective piezoelectric coefficient40,56 is generally used as the figure of merit for judging how efficiently piezoelectric materials can harvest energy, because it is directly associated with the piezoelectric potential. The effective piezoelectric coefficient can quantify the volume change when piezoelectric nanocomposites are subjected to an external electric field (the inverse piezoelectric effect) or the polarization generated upon application of an external stress (the direct piezoelectric effect).
To achieve higher permittivity and piezoelectric properties of the composite, it is valuable for understanding the effective electro-elastic properties piezoelectric nano-structures. The piezoelectric properties are considered to be closely related to both grain and domain sizes, and have become a current topic of great interest in recent research.
5.1 Theoretical work
Coupling surface/interface theory has been widely used to characterize the effective piezoelectric behavior of PNs, which has been reviewed in section 3.1. In this section, other theoretical work will be discussed.
In one-dimensional PNs, the polarization axis is the major piezoelectric potential accumulating axis, and is perpendicular to the substrate plane for the direct piezoelectric effect; therefore, the relevant parameter associated with the piezoelectric potential is the effective piezoelectric coefficient in that direction. Based on the nanoscale piezoelectric components, Sen et al. provided a detailed analytical treatment of the piezoelectric effect on the elastic stiffness and piezoelectric polarization for a zincblende ZnO nanowire.76
By using a continuum model for ZnO NWs–NTs of different sizes, a theoretical model for calculating the radially dependent effective piezoelectric coefficient and corresponding piezoelectric potential in intrinsic ZnO nanowires (NWs)–nanotubes (NTs) was presented in ref. 32. The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the structured composites are well described by an analytical model for composites containing nano-fibers and particles arranged into chains. The influence of degree of rotation and aspect ratio of the individual particles as well as their spacing is described in ref. 113.
Quantum mechanical computational estimates of piezoelectric coefficients in nanowires were reported in ref. 47. It revealed that the giant piezoelectric coefficients in both gallium nitride and ZnO nanowires is a result of size effects. For gallium nitride, diameters well in excess of 2.5 nm are required to converge to bulk values.47
Atomistic calculation is a convenient way to obtain the effective piezoelectric coefficient of PNs. This method has been used to analyze BaTiO3 nanoscale cantilever beams under bending deformation. Majdoub et al. presented the illustrative model problem of a nanoscale cantilever beam, and gave the analytical expressions for the ‘effective’ or ‘apparent’ size-dependent piezoelectric coefficients and elastic modulus.114
In addition, finite element analysis was also used to analyze the output piezoelectric potential of a vertically compressed semiconductive ZnO NW.38
5.2 Experimental work
To achieve improved piezoelectric and mechanical performance, many experimental methods are proposed to measure the response of PNs under various loading conditions. In the work of Dodds and his coworkers,25 the piezoelectric properties were measured by applying electric fields while measuring their response using a Sawyer-Tower circuit. Piezoelectric coefficient d33 measurements were performed with a Berlincourt type d33 meter (PM3000, PiezoTest, UK) with flat electrodes.113 The effective piezoelectric coefficient of a ZnO nanowire/nanobelt was experimentally measured by piezoresponse force microscopy, and ranged from 14.3 pm V−1 to 26.7 pm V−1 depending on the frequency, which is higher than the value for bulk ZnO of 9.93 pm V−1.56,115 By using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared analysis, the variation of dielectric properties showed that the dielectric constant of PVDF–ZnO hybrid films increases with increasing ZnO content at room temperature.116 In Loh and Chang's work, the experimental results suggest that increasing ZnO weight fraction leads to a near-linear increase in their dynamic strain sensitivity and piezoelectricity.117
Based on scanning probe microscopy, an experimental approach was used to directly quantify the three-dimensional piezoelectric response of individual GaN NWs.88 A nanoelectromechanical oscillator was used to measure the effective piezoelectric coefficient of the ZnO nanowire growing along the c-axis.40 Piezoresponse force microscopy was used to measure the effective piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of an individual (0001) surface-dominated zinc oxide nanobelt lying on a conductive surface.56
6 Synthesis of piezoelectric nano-structures
In this section, different synthesis techniques and growth mechanisms of piezoelectric nano-structures are summarized. Generally, the synthesis of PNs has seen rapid developments in recent years, especially the synthesis of piezoelectric nanowires. Novel fabrication techniques are constantly experimented and developed. To date, the experimental work mainly focused on the one-dimensional PNs. The basic synthetic methodologies of one-dimensional PNs were briefly reviewed in ref. 16.
For PNs, the fabrication techniques to synthesize them may be classified into five main classes.
6.1 Sol–gel template method
This method is based on the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of molecular precursors such as metal alkoxides and inorganic salts. It typically entails the hydrolysis of a solution of precursor molecules to firstly obtain a suspension of colloidal particles (the sol) and the gel composed of aggregated sol particles. The gel is then thermally treated to yield the desired material. Sol–gel chemistry has recently evolved into a general and powerful approach for preparing inorganic materials. It has a number of advantages over many conventional synthetic procedures. For example, materials of high purity can be synthesized at lower temperatures. In addition, the homogeneous multi-component systems can be obtained by mixing precursor solutions. This allows for easy chemical doping of the prepared materials.
In the work of Cernea et al.,118 (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3 doped with 5 mol% BaTiO3 (NBT-BT0.05) nanopowder was prepared by sol–gel method. The piezoelectric constants dij were calculated from the kij, εii and SEjj by the relation of dij = kij(εii,Sjj) in which, Sjj is the elastic constants, εii is the free permittivity, and kij is the electromechanical coupling factor. Cernea and his coworkers also successfully fabricated BaTiO3 doped-(Na1/2Bi1/2)TiO3 piezoelectric ceramics,119 dense nanocrystalline (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramics doped with 5, 8, and 11 mol% BaTiO3,30 and BNT-BTx piezoelectric ceramics120 by the sol–gel and spark plasma sintering techniques.
In the work of Masud et al.,121 the La2NiMnO6 nanoparticles were synthesized by a sol–gel process, and the dielectric, magnetic and magnetocapacitive properties were analyzed. By using the sol–gel template method combined with laser interference lithography, a PZT nano-dot array was fabricated, and the material characterization was briefly discussed.122 (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 doped with 8 mol% BaTiO3 (BNT-BT0.08) nanopowder with average particle size of 30 nm was prepared by an acetate-alkoxide sol–gel method.123 (Na0.5Bi0.5)0.94Ba0.06TiO3 piezoelectric ceramics124 and 0.4 μm thick Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 films125 were also synthesized by the sol–gel technique. For one-dimensional PNs, nanofibers of barium titanate have been produced in ref. 126 by the electrospinning technique from a sol–gel precursor.
6.2 Hydrothermal method
The hydrothermal method is a powerful method for the fabrication of one-dimensional nanostructures, offering significant advantages such as controllable structures and a cost-effective low-temperature substrate-independent technique that allows for easy integration.
For one-dimensional PNs, piezoelectric ZnO nanostructures, including nanowires, nanotowers, nanovolcanoes, nanorods, nanotubes, and nanoflowers, have been grown by using the hydrothermal technique.35,127–130 A low-frequency-vibration-based power generator using ZnO cylindrical nanowires with the diameters of 70 nm and lengths of 2.5 μm was grown by hydrothermal method for process integration and low cost.37 The performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) on ZnO nanorods which were prepared by hydrothermal and vapor-deposition methods has been investigated in ref. 131.
Recently, BT and ST nanocube single crystals which grew with {100} crystalline faces were synthesized by using hydrothermal process.132–135 The BT and ST nanocubes were prepared by hydrothermal method and the water-soluble titanium complex method.134,135
6.3 Solvent casting method
This method is mainly used to prepare piezoelectric nanofilms. The flexible films were obtained by spreading the solution on a clean glass substrate.
Magnetoelectric nanocomposites were successfully produced using piezoelectric phase PVDF–TrFE and magnetostrictive phase CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by a simple solvent casting method. Ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties were improved when a small amount of ferrite nanoparticles was added to the polymeric matrix.22 Nanocomposites of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and nano-ZnO were prepared using the solution casting method for different concentrations of nano-ZnO, and characterized by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy.116
Graphene oxide nanosheets (GOn)/PVDF nanocomposite films prepared with different graphene oxide loading via solution casting method were given by Achaby and his coworkers,81 and the dispersion of GOn in the PVDF matrix was performed using a transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerated voltage of 120 kV. P(VDF-TrFE)–alumina composite films containing various amounts of alumina nanoparticles have been prepared by solvent casting method.27 0–3 nanocomposites of PVDF with varying volume percentages of strontium-doped PZT have been synthesized using a combination of a modified solution casting process and the hot press technique.136,137
6.4 Electrospinning technique
In general, electrospinning is a process with low productivity because the polymer solution has to be fed at relatively slow rates in order to obtain ultrathin fibers. The method is based on the jet drawing from a polymer solution or melt by a strong electric field. The electrospinning technique can enable the fabrication of continuous, individual or mat-assembled fibers with submicrometer diameters. It is important to note that the electrospinning technique is a very effective tool for controlling fiber deposition and producing two- and three-dimensional fiber arrays. Compared with solvent casting method, the electrospinning technique shows better interaction with the polymer matrix.
Near-field electrospinning technology can be used to fabricate PVDF piezoelectric fibers with an excellent piezoelectric property. It has been successfully used to fabricate PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) piezoelectric nano-fibers mixed with additional multiwalled-carbon nanotubes,138 and poly(vinylidene fluoride)-trifluoroethylene (PVDF–TrFE) thin films enhanced with zinc oxide nanoparticles.114 The fabrication of photopatternable piezoelectric nanocomposites for MEMS by electrospinning technique was given in ref. 26. In the work of Pu et al.,139 it is found that electrospun PVDF fibers have larger (about twice) piezoelectric coefficient than that of PVDF thin films possibly due to fewer defects.
6.5 Sintering technologies
High piezoelectric properties can be acquired by sintering technologies, for example, microwave sintering, spark plasma sintering and two-step sintering, which were also attributed to the small grain size. The most novel and increasingly used method is spark plasma sintering, which has clear advantages over conventional sintering methods, making it possible to sinter nanometric powders to near full densification with little grain growth. This has become increasingly important recently, with the miniaturization of electronic devices and the requirement of investigating the size effects on the properties approaching the nanometer scale.140–142
ZnO nanowires,49 BiScO3–PbTiO3 ceramics,143 nanostructured ceramics of 0.92PbZn1/3Nb2/3O3–0.08PbTiO3,144 and BaTiO3 piezoelectric ceramics145 have been successfully prepared by this technology. Two-step sintering was applied to manufacture fine-grain barium titanate (BaTiO3) piezoelectric ceramics from hydrothermally synthesized 100 nm particles.146
In addition to the above methods, other synthesis techniques, such as sweeping-printing method,147 wet chemical methods,148 and capillary-force-assisted solution self-assembly method,149 were also proposed to fabricate the PNs.
In the reviewed experiments, the composition and crystallinity of these PNs were mostly determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. SEM is an efficient way of getting the image of dispersion state in PNs.
7 Summary and future outlook
In this review, the classification of piezoelectric nano-structures and their potential nanoelectronic applications are presented, and some important formulations and experimental developments about synthesis techniques are revealed. As a new emerging class of nanocomposites, PNs have seen rapid developments in recent years. Novel fabrication techniques are constantly experimented and developed. Nevertheless, the theoretical and experimental works still need further exploration in the future.
A further investigation on the nonlocal piezoelectric is necessary to expand the theoretical foundation. The characterization of surfaces and interfaces of actual PNs is still controversial. Further experimental measurements in PNs are required to validate the two fundamental theories.
Only a few investigations on 3D PNs were reported in last two years, and more theoretical and experimental works are required to explore the wide application of the 3D effect on PNs.
In addition, many fundamental questions and phenomena related to the growth mechanism of PNs are still not well understood and need further investigation. In fact, this field leaves plenty of room to be explored, and therefore more studies and advances are anticipated.
Besides the piezoelectric effect, the magnetoelectric (ME) effect in nanostructures provides wide opportunity for the mutual control and detection of magnetization and electrical polarization in ferroelectromagnetic nanocomposites. This also needs a wide investigation.
