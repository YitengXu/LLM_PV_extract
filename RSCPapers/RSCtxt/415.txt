J. Mater. Chem. A, 2013, 1, 13222-13226Direct growth of mesoporous Sn-doped TiO2 thin films on conducting substrates for lithium-ion battery anodes†Yanli Wang‡, Ming Xu‡, Zheng Peng and Gengfeng Zheng*Laboratory of Advanced Materials, Department of Chemistry, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, People's Republic of China. E-mail: gfzheng@fudan.edu.cnReceived 13th August 2013, Accepted 3rd September 2013First published on 3rd September 2013AbstractWe demonstrate the controlled doping of Sn into mesoporous TiO2 thin films, by a facile direct growth on conducting substrates (e.g. Ti) using the ligand-assisted evaporation-induced self-assembly method. The obtained Sn-doped mesoporous TiO2 thin films are polycrystalline with an anatase structure. The mesoporous TiO2 frameworks provide efficient ion transport pathways and structural stability for Li+ insertion. The in situ incorporation of Sn dopants into the mesoporous frameworks improves the charge transfer efficiency and the theoretical Li+ storage capacity of the electrode. In addition, the obtained mesoporous structures on Ti substrates provide close contact between the active material and the current collector, thus reducing the contact resistance and enhancing the charge transfer. As proof-of-concept, lithium-ion battery measurements of the Sn-doped mesoporous TiO2 thin film anodes with different Sn doping ratios show that the specific reversible capacity increases to a maximum with ∼6% Sn doping ratio (∼252.5 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C) compared to our best pristine mesoporous TiO2 thin film anodes (100.8 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C), and then decreases at higher Sn doping ratios. Moreover, the Sn-doped mesoporous TiO2 thin films exhibit an excellent cycling stability, thus suggesting a potential approach for fabricating mesoporous oxide thin films with controlled doping for stable LIB storage.IntroductionThe fast growth of the worldwide market for rechargeable energy storage requires electrode candidates with high energy and power density, convenient fabrication and assembly, excellent stability and low cost.1–4 Substantial research interest has been focusing on the use of nanoscale materials and structures for high-performance energy storage devices such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)5–9 and supercapacitors.10,11 In particular, the mesoporous structures,12 due to their uniform and tunable pore size, large pore volume, high specific surface area, and ordered mesochannel orientation, represent a unique building block that can simultaneously address fast surface electrochemical reaction and high ion/charge storage capacity.13 A variety of mesoporous shapes and morphologies such as nanoparticles,14 nanowires,15 microspheres,16,17 fibers,18 monoliths,19,20 and films21–24 have been investigated, and among them, thin films are especially attractive candidates for electrochemical reaction and storage systems.25,26 The continuous and highly homogeneous macroscopic film morphology enables fast charge transfer, and the uniform mesopore structure and large surface area allow for efficient ion transport and reaction on the interfacial surface. It has recently been reported that mesoporous carbon thin films made by the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) process27–31 can serve as electrochemical supercapacitor devices25 and photoanodes for solar energy conversion.26 Nonetheless, only limited success has been demonstrated for LIB anodes based on mesoporous structures with thin film morphologies.32 Moreover, the slow ion transport to the electrode surface and the undesirable electrode volume change during the charge/discharge cycles are the two dominating factors that limit the application of many potential electrode materials with high theoretical energy capacities,33 which have remained as major challenges for further development of LIB anodes with excellent reversible capacity and cycling stability.In this paper, we demonstrate a facile, direct synthesis of doped mesoporous TiO2 thin films on a Ti foil substrate, with tunable doping of other anode materials (such as SnO2) into the structures. The continuous, porous TiO2 framework serves as a conducting medium for efficient charge transport as well as the protection layer for particle aggregation, and the mesopores allow for fast electrolyte penetration, leading to improved storage capacity and cycling stability. Furthermore, the as-made thin films coated on Ti foils are directly used for battery assembly, without the need for adding auxiliary binders or additives, thus substantially facilitating the device fabrication. As proof-of-concept, our synthesized pristine mesoporous TiO2, with a pore size of 9.6 nm and a high surface area of 68.2 m2 g−1, has maintained a discharge capacity of 100.8 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles at 0.5 C current density (1 C of TiO2 corresponds to 168 mA g−1). In addition, different amounts of Sn are doped into the TiO2 mesoporous framework to improve the battery capacity. LIB anodes made of the Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin film, with a Sn/Ti atomic ratio of 6%, provide a much improved reversible discharge capacity of 252.5 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, suggesting the in situ doping method as a potential approach for improving mesoporous material-based LIB anodes.ExperimentalSynthesis and characterizationOrdered mesoporous Sn-doped TiO2 films on Ti foil were synthesized via a spin-coating method on the basis of the ligand-assisted EISA process, followed by a pyrolysis process (Fig. 1, Methods in the ESI†). In brief, acetylacetone titanium (Ti(AcAc)) and acetylacetone tin (Sn(AcAc)) were prepared by coordinating titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TIPO) and tin chloride with acetylacetone (AcAc) ligand in order to reduce the hydrolysis rates of metal ions,26 and then used as the precursors for TiO2 and SnO2, respectively. A triblock copolymer P123 was used as the template to assist the organic–organic assembly during the evaporation of ethanol solvent. The obtained film was treated with a sequential pyrolysis process to decompose the polymer template and to form the mesoporous structures. The loading of the Sn-doped TiO2 in the thin film electrode was 1–2 mg. Similarly, the pristine (undoped) TiO2 mesoporous films were obtained without addition of tin precursors. Fig. 1  Illustration of the synthesis processes for mesoporous TiO2 films and mesoporous Sn-doped TiO2 films. Step A: no tin precursor is added. Step B: tin precursor (Sn(AcAc)) is added. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out on a field-emission S-4800 SEM (Hitachi, Japan) and a JEM-2100F TEM (JEM, Japan), respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on an X-ray single crystal diffractometer (Bruker SMART APEX (II)-CCD, Germany). Small-angle X-ray scattering data were obtained on a NanoStar U SAXS System (Bruker, Germany). N2 sorption isotherms were measured at 77 K by using a Micrometrics ASAP 2420 system. The surface area and pore size were obtained by using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively.Battery fabrication and measurementThe lithium-ion batteries were assembled in a glove box equipped with Ar gas, with the content of moisture and oxygen <1 ppm. The pristine TiO2 and the Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin film samples were directly used for battery assembly, without the need for coating and baking steps, or mixing with any binders and conductive additives. 1 M LiPF6 was dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) with a 1:1 weight ratio, and used as the electrolyte for battery assembly. Li foil was used as the counter electrode. All cells were tested using a multi-channeled battery tester (Neware Co., China). Cyclic voltammetry was carried out using a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation.Results and discussionStructural characterizationScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the pristine TiO2 thin films grown via the EISA method exhibit highly ordered arrays of mesopores (Fig. 2a), with a uniform pore size of ∼9 nm. The cross-sectional SEM images of the mesoporous TiO2 thin film indicate that the mesopore channels are inter-connected with each other (Fig. 2b). The Sn-doped mesoporous TiO2 thin film is synthesized by adding the Sn(AcAc) precursor into the Ti(AcAc) precursor, in which the actual Sn/Ti atomic ratio is estimated by the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement. The mesostructure deformation takes place with the increase in the doping amount of Sn, as the integrity and continuity of the mesoporous frameworks are partially disrupted (Fig. 2c and S1†). Furthermore, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns display a diffraction peak of the (001) reflection for both the pristine and the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 (Sn/Ti = 6% atomic ratio) mesoporous films, but not for higher Sn-doped TiO2 films (Fig. S2†), confirming that the mesostructure is preserved at low Sn doping percentages. Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) a pristine mesoporous TiO2 film (top view); (b) side view of a mesoporous TiO2 film; (c) 6%-Sn-doped mesoporous TiO2 film and (d) XRD patterns of the Ti substrate (curve i), pure TiO2 film (curve ii), 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 film (curve iii), 15%-Sn-doped TiO2 film (curve iv), and 25%-Sn-doped TiO2 film (curve v). The crystalline structures of the obtained Sn-doped TiO2 thin films are analyzed by the wide-angle XRD patterns (Fig. 2d). All these TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 film samples show diffraction peaks at 25.3, 37.8, 48.0, and 53.9°, corresponding to the 101, 004, 200 and 105 reflections of anatase TiO2 with a tetragonal structure (JCPDS PDF file: 21-1272) and a space group of l41/amd(141). In addition, for the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 film, no clear difference is observed in the XRD pattern compared to that of the pristine TiO2 film. However, for higher Sn doping percentages, the additional diffraction peaks at 26.6, 33.9, 37.9, and 51.8° are correlated with the 110, 101, 200 and 211 reflections of the tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS PDF file: 41-1445) and a space group of P42/mnm(136). No other peaks except for the Ti substrate are observed. These results indicate that Sn dopants are well incorporated into the TiO2 framework at relatively low doping percentages (e.g. ∼6%), while a separate SnO2 phase is formed at higher doping percentages.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the pristine TiO2 mesoporous thin films have well ordered, parallel one-dimensional (1D) mesochannels (Fig. 3a). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images clearly display that the mesopore walls consist of a large number of TiO2 crystalline domains of ∼10 nm size (Fig. 3b), in good accord with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3a, inset) and the XRD result. Well-resolved lattice fringes of 0.35 nm are observed, consistent with the (101) planes of a tetragonal-phase anatase TiO2 (JCPDS21-1272).26 On the other hand, TEM images of the Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous films show that the whole film consists of ∼10 nm diameter crystalline domains, while the original ordered mesochannels are disrupted (Fig. 3c). The HRTEM images exhibit both lattice fringes of 0.35, 0.33 and 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes of anatase TiO2 and (110) and (101) planes of tetragonal SnO2, respectively (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3  TEM and HRTEM images of (a and b) the mesoporous TiO2 films and (c and d) 6%-Sn-doped mesoporous TiO2 films. Insets in (a and c): SAED patterns. The porosities of the pristine TiO2 and Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin films are further characterized by the nitrogen sorption isotherm. All these samples show type-IV curves and a distinct hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of a mesoporous structure (Fig. S3†). The surface area (SBET), the pore size and the pore volume (Vtotal) of pristine TiO2, 6%-Sn-doped TiO2, 15%-Sn-doped TiO2, and 25%-Sn-doped TiO2 films are calculated and summarized in Table S1 and Fig. S3b.† The pore size derived from the adsorption branch increases with the increasing proportion of Sn/Ti, suggesting the increasing trend of disordered structures due to the addition of Sn precursors.Electrochemical measurementsThe electrochemical performances of the Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous films are measured as anode materials for LIBs. The pristine mesoporous TiO2 thin film is also fabricated as LIB anodes for comparison. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 from the first 3 cycles at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 in the range of 3.0–0.01 V are displayed in Fig. 4a. In the first cycle, the reduction and oxidation peaks are located at ∼1.7 and 2.2 V, associated with the Li+ insertion/extraction in the anatase TiO2 lattice.34,36 Another two reduction peaks near 0.8 and 1.0 V are observed during the first cycle but disappear in the successive ones, which are ascribed to the formation of Li2O and a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer due to the electrolyte decomposition on the electrode surface.35 In addition, one small oxidation peak at about 0.7 V corresponds to delithiation of the LixSn alloy into Sn.5 Fig. 4  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 films for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles; (b) charge–discharge profiles of the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 films at a current rate of 0.5 C (84 mA g−1) for the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 20th cycles; (c) cycling performance of the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 films (curve i), 15%-Sn-doped TiO2 films (curve ii), 25%-Sn-doped TiO2 films (curve iii), and pristine TiO2 films (curve iv); (d) capacity retention for the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 films (red curve) and the pristine TiO2 films (black curve) at different charge/discharge rates from 0.1 to 1 C. Fig. 4b displays the charge–discharge curves of 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 film based anode materials during the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 20th cycles, which are performed at a voltage window of 3.0–0.01 V vs. Li/Li+ and with a current density of 84 mA g−1 (0.5 C based on the TiO2 theoretical capacity). In the discharge curve of the first cycle, there are two obvious voltage plateaus (∼1.7 and ∼1.2 V), which are ascribed to the Li+ insertion into the anatase TiO2 lattice, and the electrolyte decomposition and reversible Li+ intercalation to form Li2O.37,38 The first discharge and charge capacities of the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 film are 575.7 and 257.2 mA h g−1, much higher than the initial discharge/charge capacities of the pristine mesoporous TiO2 films, which are 267.6 and 139.9 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. S4†). A relatively large loss (∼53%) of the initial capacity is observed in the 2nd cycle, which is attributed to the formation of Li2O and SEI layers.39 From the 2nd cycle, the capacity is almost constant. For instance, the discharge capacities of the 2nd, 5th, and 20th cycles are retained at 270.1, 264.9 and 272.1 mA h g−1, respectively.The anode cycling performance of different samples is further interrogated at a constant charge/discharge rate of 84 mA g−1 (0.5 C based on the TiO2 theoretical capacity), as shown in Fig. 4c. The discharge capacities of the pristine TiO2, 6%-Sn-doped TiO2, 15%-Sn-doped TiO2, and 25%-Sn-doped TiO2 are retained at 100.8, 252.5, 148.0, and 142.1 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles, respectively. Among these samples, the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin film exhibits the highest specific capacity. As SnO2 has a higher theoretical capacity than TiO2,5 a low proportion of SnO2 (∼6% Si/Ti) in the TiO2 frameworks leads to an enhanced reversible capacity. However, at higher Sn doping percentages, the mesoporous structure is destroyed significantly, and the phase separation and aggregation of SnO2 and TiO2 result in the loss of capacity of the anode materials. Furthermore, as TiO2 has a low volume change during the lithiation/delithiation process,40–42 the low Sn doping in the TiO2 framework can preserve this property, thus maintaining an excellent cycling performance.The capacity retentions of the pristine and the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin films are further evaluated for multiple steps at higher charge/discharge rates (Fig. 4d). Each step contains 5 charge/discharge cycles at different current rates from 0.1 to 1 C (1 C = 168 mA g−1). The discharge capacities of 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 films for 0.1 C, 0.2 C, 0.5 C, and 1 C are maintained as ∼307.3, 234.0, 178.0, and 153 mA h g−1, respectively, with a Coulombic efficiency of each cycle over 95%. Although some fluctuation in the battery capacity exists for different batches of 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 film samples due to the fabrication quality, these obtained capacity values are still much better than the best result of the pristine TiO2 mesoporous thin films measured at similar current levels. When the current is reset to 0.1 C, the discharge capacity recovers to ∼294 mA h g−1, suggesting excellent cycling performance and stability.Finally, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement is performed to investigate the charge transfer impedance of the mesoporous thin film-based LIB anodes (Fig. 5a and b). The Nyquist plots of the pristine TiO2 and 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 are obtained at an amplitude of 5 mV with a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. The charge transfer process at the electrode interface can be deduced from the depressed semicircle of the Nyquist plot in the high frequency region.5 It is clearly seen that the diameter of the semicircle for the Sn-doped TiO2 is smaller than that of the pristine TiO2, indicating a smaller charge transfer impedance for the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin film. Using an equivalent circuit model (Fig. 5a, inset), the charge transfer impedances of the pristine TiO2 and the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin films are calculated to be 314.9 and 21.4 Ω, respectively. The reduced charge transfer impedance7 of the Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin film can be attributed to the higher conductivity of SnO2 than TiO2.43 Combined with the higher theoretical capacity of SnO2, the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin films demonstrate an improved electrochemical storage capacity as an LIB anode material.

ConclusionsIn summary, we have fabricated the Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous thin film directly grown on Ti foil substrates by a facile, direct method via the ligand-assisted EISA method. The obtained mesoporous thin films on Ti substrates provide close contact between the electrochemically active materials and the current collector to reduce the contact resistance and enhance the charge transfer. The mesoporous frameworks allow for efficient ion transport pathways and sufficient flexibility for electrode volume expansion. The addition of Sn dopants into the mesoporous framework leads to a higher theoretical Li+ storage capacity as well as a better charge transfer efficiency. As proof-of-concept, a Sn-doped TiO2 mesoporous film with a low doping level (Sn/Ti = 6% atomic ratio) has shown a much enhanced reversible Li+ storage capacity and cycling performance, while these properties become compromised at higher Sn doping percentages, due to the aggregation and phase separation of SnO2 and TiO2. Our research suggests that selective doping of other transition metal/metal oxides, such as iron,44 copper,7 and nickel,45 into the mesoporous TiO2 thin films may provide a potential approach for obtaining LIB anode materials with enhanced capacity and stability.AcknowledgementsWe thank the following funding agencies for supporting this work: the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2013CB934104), the NSF of China (21322311), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-10-0357), the Shanghai Pujiang Program (10PJ1401000), and the Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning.ReferencesH.

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) a pristine mesoporous TiO2 film (top view); (b) side view of a mesoporous TiO2 film; (c) 6%-Sn-doped mesoporous TiO2 film and (d) XRD patterns of the Ti substrate (curve i), pure TiO2 film (curve ii), 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 film (curve iii), 15%-Sn-doped TiO2 film (curve iv), and 25%-Sn-doped TiO2 film (curve v).	 

 	Fig. 3  TEM and HRTEM images of (a and b) the mesoporous TiO2 films and (c and d) 6%-Sn-doped mesoporous TiO2 films. Insets in (a and c): SAED patterns.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Cyclic voltammograms of the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 films for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles; (b) charge–discharge profiles of the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 films at a current rate of 0.5 C (84 mA g−1) for the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 20th cycles; (c) cycling performance of the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 films (curve i), 15%-Sn-doped TiO2 films (curve ii), 25%-Sn-doped TiO2 films (curve iii), and pristine TiO2 films (curve iv); (d) capacity retention for the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 films (red curve) and the pristine TiO2 films (black curve) at different charge/discharge rates from 0.1 to 1 C.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist plot of (i) the pristine TiO2 film and (ii) the 6%-Sn-doped TiO2 film anodes; (b) close-up of the high frequency region of (a).
