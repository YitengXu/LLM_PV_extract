    , Accepted 17th October 2015First published on 19th October 2015AbstractIn this study, hierarchical nanoflower superstructures composed of In2S3 nanosheets grown on a Bi2S3 nanoflower backbone (denoted as Bi2S3\In2S3) are fabricated by a facile one-step solvothermal route based on different growth rates of two kinds of sulphides. The Bi2S3 nanoflowers were first formed due to a quick growth rate, which serves as the substrate for the growth of In2S3 ultra-thin nanosheets with a relatively slow reaction rate to form a hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composite superstructure. The introduction of In2S3 nanosheets on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflower can not only increase visible-light response, but also remarkably promote the photogenerated charge transport and separation driven by the heterojunction. Because of their marked synergistic effects, the as-prepared hierarchical Bi2S3 nanoflower\In2S3 nanosheet superstructures exhibit significant visible-light photocatalytic activity and stability for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol.
1. Introduction
In recent years, metal sulfides have been widely investigated as highly efficient catalysts for visible-light photocatalytic applications.1–3 Among these metal sulfides, Bi2S3 and In2S3, with band gaps of ∼1.3 eV and 2.2 eV, respectively, have been used as sensitizers due to their ability to absorb a large part of the visible-light region.4–6 Nevertheless, the widespread application of Bi2S3 and In2S3 has some limitations related to the fast recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs during the visible-light photocatalytic processes.7–9 Therefore, an enormous amount of effort has been made to lower the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs by designing metal/metal oxide (sulfide) heterostructure nanocatalysts.10 The formed heterostructures favor charge separation through quick transfer of electrons or holes from one material to the other.
Recently, lots of Bi2S3-based visible-light photocatalysts were synthesized to improve photoinduced charge separation and visible-light photocatalytic activity, for example, Bi2S3–TiO2, Bi2S3/Bi2Sn2O7, and Bi2S3/BiOBr composites.11–13 The combination of these metal oxides and Bi2S3 is an efficient way of separating photoinduced carriers, thus raising the photocatalytic efficiency of the composites.14,15 Meanwhile, Bi2S3 is also coupled with carbon materials, and Bi2S3-reduced graphene oxide composites and Bi2S3/g-C3N4 composites were prepared and exhibited obviously enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic properties.16–18 Recently, coupling Bi2S3 with another metal sulfide could effectively accelerate the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, such as CuS–Bi2S3, MoS2 nanosheet-coated Bi2S3, Pd4S-coated Bi2S3 nanorods, and Bi2S3/CdS composites.19–22 In most cases, the loading processes of metal sulfides are often complicated; the general synthesis strategy used to fabricate a metal sulfide composite structure is to first prepare the substrate material, and then couple other materials with the substrate to form a composite structure.23–25 Therefore, constructing metal sulfide composites via a facile route requires significant work. Our recent study showed that the combination of In2S3 and Bi2S3 in a single core@shell composite could significantly improve the overall performance of the core@shell system for the photocatalytic degradation reaction.26 This kind of synthetic method can form effective interfacial contact and strong interaction between two components in the composite and lead to enhanced photogenerated charge transfer and separation. In the core@shell system, if the shell layer is too thick, it can obstruct the light utilization of the core material, thus influencing the further enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. Recently, ultrathin structures, such as nanosheets, have been used to act as a shell to construct hierarchical composite structures basically due to their large specific surface areas and high light utilization as well as quick photogenerated charge carrier transfer from the interior to the surface of the photocatalysts during photocatalytic reactions.27,28 Significant progress has been made in combining these advantages. For instance, Lou et al. prepared 1D hierarchical structures composed of Ni3S2 nanosheets on a carbon nanotube backbone to significantly improve supercapacitors and photocatalytic H2 production performance.29 Wang and coworkers have prepared helical 1D/2D epitaxial nano-heterostructures between a CdS rod and ZnIn2S4 nanosheets. The resulting well-defined interface induces the delocalized interface states, thus facilitating the charge transfer and enhancing the performance in the photoelectrochemical cells.30 Inspired by these studies, In2S3 nanosheets grown on a Bi2S3 support are expected to fabricate hierarchical Bi2S3/In2S3 composites with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity.
In this study, we reported a facile one-step hydrothermal route for the synthesis of hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composites. In this process, because of the significant reaction rate difference, the quick reaction rate of thiourea with Bi salt forms Bi2S3 nanoflowers first, and then the slow reaction rate causes the growth of In2S3 nanosheets on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers, leading to the formation of hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composites. In this special composite structure, the fluffy In2S3 nanosheets on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers benefit multiple light reflections and increase light harvesting. Together with the quick photogenerated charge carrier transfer, enhanced photocatalytic efficiency and photostability were obtained from the hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composites for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol under visible-light irradiation.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of the hierarchical Bi2S3 nanoflower\In2S3 nanosheet composite
In a typical experiment, 0.3 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 0.15 g of thiourea (Tu), a specified quality of In(NO3)3·4.5H2O (the Bi3+ to In3+ mole ratio is 3:1) and 5 mL of glycerol were added into 25 mL of ethanol and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the obtained yellow solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated to 150 °C and maintained for 10 h. After cooling, the as-synthesized brown products were rinsed with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and then dried at 60 °C overnight. Similarly, Bi2S3\In2S3 composites in different Bi to In mole ratios (4:1, 2:1, and 1:1) were also prepared. For comparison, bare Bi2S3 and In2S3 were obtained under the same experimental conditions in the absence of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and In(NO3)3·4.5H2O, respectively.
2.2. Characterization
The structure and morphology of the product were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan), and SEM-EDS analyses were carried out with a Hitachi S-4800 SEM equipped with an EDAX energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100, Japan) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance using CuKα radiation) were also performed. Raman spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon HR 800 micro-Raman spectrometer at 457.9 nm. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were obtained using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550). The fluorescence spectra of the samples at room temperature were characterized via a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan). The excitation wavelength was 350 nm induced from a He–Cd laser source to excite the samples.
2.3. Measurement of photocatalytic activity
The photodegradation experiments were performed in a slurry reactor containing 100 mL of 50 mg L−1 2,4-dichlorophenol and 0.05 g of the catalyst. A 150 W xenon lamp (Institute of Electric Light Source, Beijing) was used as the solar-simulated light source, and visible light was achieved by utilizing a UV cut filter (λ > 420 nm). Prior to light irradiation, the suspension was kept in the dark under stirring for 30 min to ensure the establishment of an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Adequate aliquots (5 mL) of the sample were withdrawn after periodic interval of irradiation, centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min, and then filtered through a Millipore filter (pore size: 0.22 μm) to remove the residual catalyst particulates for analysis. The filtrates were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550).
In order to detect the radical species over the catalyst during the photocatalytic reaction, the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique (with DMPO) was performed using a Bruker EMX-8/2.7 spectrometer by accumulating three scans at a microwave frequency of 9.85 GHz and a power of 6.35 mW. Before testing, DMPO was added to the suspension system, and then the system was irradiated by visible light using a halogen tungsten lamp with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm). Besides, to detect the active species generated during photocatalytic reactivity, various scavengers were added into 2,4-dichlorophenol solutions, including 1 mM p-benzoquinone (BQ, a quencher of O2˙−), 1.0 mM isopropanol (IPA, a quencher of ˙OH), 1 mM triethanolamine (TEOA, a quencher of h+), and 6 mM AgNO3 (e− scavenger), followed by the photocatalytic activity test.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the phase structure and morphology
The phase structures of these samples were determined by XRD measurements (Fig. 1A). The X-ray diffraction spectra of a and c shown in Fig. 1D reveal the presence of the pure orthorhombic phase Bi2S3 (JCPDS card no. 17-0320) and cubic β-In2S3 (JCPDS card no. 32-0456), respectively. For the hierarchical composite (line b in Fig. 1A), the diffraction peaks of Bi2S3 match with the reflections from the orthorhombic phase Bi2S3 lattice planes (130), (021) and (211), making it easy to reveal the presence of Bi2S3.31 In contrast, no diffraction peaks attributed to cubic β-In2S3 can be found, which may be due to low crystallinity and the overlap of the diffraction peaks with those of Bi2S3. However, the corresponding Raman spectra of the three samples shown in Fig. 1B proved the existence of cubic β-In2S3. All the above results suggest that the ultrathin In2S3 nanosheets could grow in situ on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers.

The morphology of the as-prepared products was characterized by SEM and TEM. Fig. 2A shows the SEM image of the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite. A uniform flower-like superstructure can be observed. The average diameter of these superstructures is about 800 nm. The surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflower is covered by In2S3 ultrathin nanosheets. From the comparison of the SEM images (Fig. S1A†), we could clearly see that bare Bi2S3 is composed of nanoflowers with an average diameter of 500–1000 nm. As for pure In2S3, lots of nanosheet aggregates could be obtained (Fig. S1B†). Interestingly, this change indicates that In2S3 nanosheets may grow along the core of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers. A more detailed structural information of the hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composite was revealed using TEM and HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 2B, ultrathin nanosheets grow uniformly on the surface of the nanoflower and the thickness of the nanosheets is estimated to be 3–5 nm measured from the edges (Fig. 2C), which would contribute to visible-light utilization in the photocatalytic reaction. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2D reveals that an interplanar spacing of 0.29 nm corresponds to the (211) plane of Bi2S3, while an interplanar spacing of 0.33 nm corresponds to the (110) plane of cubic β-In2S3, implying the formation of a Bi2S3\In2S3 heterostructure.26,32 This suggests that an intimate and coherent interface was formed between the In2S3 nanosheet and the Bi2S3 nanoflower core. This is important for the improvement of charge separation and thus photocatalytic activity. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in the inset of Fig. 2B further proves the mixed-phase nature of single crystal Bi2S3 and polycrystalline In2S3.

The element distribution was verified by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) element mapping. As shown in Fig. 3B–D, the EDS mapping images indicate the coexistence and homogeneous distribution of S, Bi and In elements in the nanoflower composites. It confirms that the In2S3 nanosheets are uniformly grown on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers. Moreover, in comparison to the mapping distribution of Bi and S elements (Fig. 3B and C), the In element content is obviously low (Fig. 3D), which is consistent with other experimental results.

3.2. Growth process of the hierarchical Bi2S3 nanoflower\In2S3 nanosheet composite
To investigate the formation process of the hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composite, time-dependent experiments were carried out. Fig. 4A–D present a series of SEM images of the products obtained at different reaction times. As shown in Fig. 4A, at the early reaction stage (30 min), the Bi2S3 nanoflowers with a smooth nanorod surface formed fast with a diameter of about 1.5 μm (Fig. 4B). As the reaction proceeded (Fig. 4C), In3+ and S2− could get enough energy to crystallize into In2S3 nanosheets on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflower. As the reaction proceeded, more In2S3 nanosheets (Fig. 4C) grew on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers after the reaction was carried out for 4 h. Ultimately, hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composites (Fig. 4D) were formed. The corresponding EDS spectra for the samples prepared from different reaction times also proved this formation process (Fig. S2A†). There only exist Bi and S elements for the product prepared at the initial reaction stage (30 min), indicating the fast formation of Bi2S3 nanoflowers. As the reaction proceeded, the presence of the In element (Fig. S2B†) also proved the appearance of In2S3 in the composite. Furthermore, the content of the In element increased along with the extension of reaction time according to the EDS results (Fig. S2C and D†).
 Fig. 4  SEM images of the products obtained from the different reaction times: (A) 30 min, (B) 1 h, (C) 4 h, and (D) 10 h. 
Based on the above experimental results and analysis, the probable morphology evolution process of the hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 nanoflower composites is shown in Scheme 1. In this study, thiourea was used as a sulfide source to supply S2− in solution during the solvothermal process. At elevated reaction temperature, thiourea hydrolyzed to release H2S with the assistance of a trace amount of a mixture of ethanol and glycerol. According to the Ksp of Bi2S3 (1.0 × 10−97) and In2S3 (5.7 × 10−73),26 it is expected that Bi2S3 will preferentially deposit and form sea-urchin-shaped nanoflowers (crystal seeds) first inside the autoclave before In2S3, Bi2+ and glycerol form a flower-like ligand. However, in the reaction system, the positively charged ions, such as In3+ and so forth, could weaken the activation energy of the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers, which would provide many high energy sites for further growth and promote their desorption from the surface of nanoflowers,33 thus leading to the following growth of In2S3 nanosheets. When Bi3+ was depleted, the nucleation process of In2S3 was initialized. With the extension of reaction time, a larger number of In3+ ions in the solution could get enough energy to nucleate onto the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers, and ultrathin In2S3 nanosheets were uniformly coated on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers. Finally, hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composites were formed. Compared to the conventional two-step synthetic process, this one-step synthetic route easily achieves uniform surface coating due to the compatibility between the Bi2S3 nanoflower and the In2S3 nanosheet. Furthermore, the In2S3 nanosheet content can be easily controlled by altering the Bi salt to In salt mole ratio. If the Bi salt to In salt mole ratio is large, the In2S3 nanosheets on the surface of the nanoflowers are not obvious (Fig. S3A†). If the Bi salt to In salt mole ratio is too low, the additional In2S3 would separate from the nanoflowers (Fig. S3C†) due to the increased supersaturation of the precursors.

3.3. UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence spectrum analyses
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the products are shown in Fig. 5. A wide absorption across the UV-visible light spectrum can be observed for all three samples. Obviously, compared with bare Bi2S3 and In2S3, the light absorption ability of the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite showed some enhancement, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two components in the composite, and the fluffy In2S3 nanosheets on the surface of Bi2S3 would benefit multiple light reflections and increase light harvesting. Taking into account the efficient use of visible light, it is believed that this composite may have enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity.
 Fig. 5  UV-visible absorption spectra of the different samples: Bi2S3, In2S3 and Bi2S3\In2S3. 
It is known that photoluminescence (PL) spectra can give information about the photoexcited energy/electron transfer and recombination processes, and it has been widely used to study the fate of electron–hole pairs.34Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra of In2S3, Bi2S3, and Bi2S3\In2S3 samples. The broad emission peaks of the Bi2S3 and In2S3 centered at 535 nm and 537 nm, respectively, are related to the presence of surface defects.6,34 Generally, the photoluminescent emission originates from the radiative recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons in semiconductor materials. An obvious decrease in the photoluminescence of the Bi2S3\In2S3 heterostructure can be observed compared with that of the Bi2S3 nanoflower or In2S3 nanosheets alone, indicating that the photogenerated electrons in the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite can easily tunnel from the In2S3 nanosheet shell into the Bi2S3 nanoflower core; thus, the core/shell heterostructure can diminish the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and enhance the visible-light absorption ability.

3.4. Photocatalytic activity
The photoactivity of the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite was evaluated by the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol under visible-light irradiation. For comparison, the decomposition abilities of Bi2S3 and In2S3 were measured under the same experimental conditions. Bi2S3 and In2S3 showed relatively low visible-light photocatalytic activity (Fig. 7A, a and b). After the In2S3 nanosheets were grown on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflowers, the visible-light photocatalytic performance of the Bi2S3\In2S3 nanoflower heterostructure dramatically improved. The corresponding decomposition rate of the optimal Bi2S3\In2S3 heterostructure (Bi:In = 3:1) increases to 92% after 90 min of visible-light irradiation (Fig. 7A), which is much higher than that of the In2S3 nanosheets (31.5%) and Bi2S3 nanoflowers (28.8%). Meanwhile, the influence of the In2S3 nanosheet amount on the photocatalytic activity can also be confirmed (Fig. 7A c–f). If the amount of In2S3 nanosheets is low (Bi:In = 4:1), In2S3 nanosheets cannot fully cover the Bi2S3 nanoflowers. So the composite can only provide relatively low surface active sites for the adsorption of reactant molecules, and the chance of recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes also increased. Adding excess In2S3 also reduced the catalytic efficiency of the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite (Bi:In = 1:1) because the additional In2S3 was separated from the Bi2S3 nanoflowers, which was unfavorable to the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol owing to the increased recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.
 Fig. 7  (A) Comparison of the photocatalytic activities of Bi2S3 (a), In2S3 (b), and the hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composite in different Bi:In ratios, 4:1 (c), 3:1 (d), 1:1 (e), and 2:1 (f). (B) Comparison of the photocatalytic activities of the hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composite (Bi:In = 3:1) with different scavengers during the photocatalytic reaction under visible-light irradiation. 
Comparing the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite with pure Bi2S3 and In2S3, the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergetic effects of the significantly enhanced light absorption (Fig. 5) and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers (Fig. 6), which can be considered as the main reasons for the enhancement of visible-light photocatalytic activity. Because the In2S3 nanosheets on the surface of the Bi2S3 nanoflower are ultrathin, visible light could penetrate the In2S3 nanosheet shell into the core of the Bi2S3 nanoflower. Meanwhile, more abundant interfaces between In2S3 and Bi2S3 facilitate charge separation, and in the continuous interface, charge carriers are delocalized and the transport is more favorable. The synergetic effect of these factors results in a significantly higher photocatalytic capability of Bi2S3\In2S3 composites. Under visible-light irradiation, photogenerated electrons are excited from the value band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of In2S3 and Bi2S3 (Fig. S4†). Because the conduction band of In2S3 is slightly higher than that of Bi2S3, the photoexcited electrons in the conduction band of In2S3 can be transferred to that of Bi2S3 easily. The electrons on the conduction band energy level (ECB) of Bi2S3 and In2S3 could reduce O2 to ˙O2− through one-electron reducing reaction.35 Meanwhile, the remaining holes in the valence band of In2S3 will be trapped at the surface state. All the radicals can react with organic chemicals in the solution and improve the photoactivity.
It is known that organic pollutants can be degraded by a series of photoinduced reactive species, such as ˙O2−, ˙OH and h+, during the photocatalytic degradation process. To elucidate the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of organic contaminants over the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite, a series of quenchers were employed to scavenge the relevant reactive species. As shown in Fig. 7B, the addition of AgNO3 in the 2,4-dichlorophenol solution has little effect on the photocatalytic activity of the hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composite. The degradation rate exhibited a slight depression in the presence of triethanolamine (TEOA). This result indicates that h+ is not the directly reactive species responsible for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol. In contrast, the introduction of isopropanol (IPA) and benzoquinone (BQ) markedly restrains the degradation of the Bi2S3\In2S3 nanoflower composite, suggesting that ˙O2− and ˙OH play an important role in degrading 2,4-dichlorophenol.
To further interpret the photocatalytic mechanism, the ESR spin-trap technique with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was employed to ascertain the active oxygen species in the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite system. Under visible-light irradiation, the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite gives the characteristic of four peaks of DMPO–˙OH in an intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 (Fig. 8A), similar to the previous studies of ˙OH adducts.36,37 Meanwhile, six characteristic peaks with intensity similar to that of DMPO–˙O2− adducts were observed only under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 8B), which is consistent with the former studies for ˙O2− adducts.38 These ESR tests reveal that ˙OH and ˙O2− radicals exist in the Bi2S3\In2S3 composite system under visible-light irradiation. The above results are consistent with the result of reactive species trapping experiments.

The stability of the hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 nanoflower composite was also evaluated by performing the cycling experiments under the same conditions. After four recycles, the hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composite does not show obvious activity loss, indicating the better stability of this Bi2S3\In2S3 composite (Fig. S5†). The high stability can be attributed to the close interaction between Bi2S3 and In2S3 solid solution, which favors the transfer of the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of In2S3 to that of Bi2S3. This spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes is beneficial for inhibiting the reduction of In3+ and Bi3+.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a facile one-step hydrothermal method was employed to synthesize a hierarchical Bi2S3\In2S3 composite based on different growth rates of sulphides. Comparative studies were carried out to evaluate the relative photocatalytic performance of Bi2S3\In2S3, Bi2S3, and In2S3. By incorporating In2S3, the hybrid structures have significantly higher performance than their counterparts benefiting from enhanced light absorption and improved photogenerated electron–hole pair separation and transportation. More importantly, in comparison with separated aggregates, In2S3 nanosheets exhibit more uniform distribution on the Bi2S3 nanoflower with less agglomeration, resulting in more contact areas between Bi2S3 and In2S3, which validated their contribution to the enhanced charge separation and transportation as well as visible-light utilization.
