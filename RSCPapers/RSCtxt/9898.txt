    , Accepted 18th December 2017First published on 19th December 2017AbstractAn efficient electrocatalyst for the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes is vital to the construction of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Herein, Co,N-bidoped carbon nanomaterials, prepared simply via the pyrolysis of bimetallic (Zn and Co) zeolite-type-metal organic frameworks, were for the first time attempted as electrocatalysts to develop counter electrodes (CEs) for QDSCs. The CEs developed exhibit superior catalytic activity for polysulfide reduction in QDSCs, resulting in a low charge transfer resistance at the interface of the CE/electrolyte, an improved fill factor (FF) and a high short circuit current density (Jsc). The outstanding performances of the CEs can be ascribed to the inherent characteristics of Co,N-bidoped carbons with homogeneously dispersed active dopants of Co and N atoms, large hydrophilic surface area, and good conductivity. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) indicated that the Co–Nx sites would be active sites for polysulfide reduction. When Co,N-bidoped carbons deposited on F-doped tin oxide glass were used as CEs, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 9.12% (Voc = 0.635 V, Jsc = 26.15 mA cm−2, FF = 0.549) under one sun illumination with 100 mW cm−2 intensity was observed on QDSCs using Zn–Cu–In–Se QDs as sensitizers. Consequently, there is a good chance to fabricate QDSCs of high efficiency with the CEs derived from MOFs.
1. Introduction
Due to low cost solution processability and high theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 44%, quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have become one of the most promising candidates for new generation solar cells.1–6 Liquid-junction QDSCs typically consist of a QD sensitized mesoporous TiO2 photoanode, an electrolyte containing a polysulfide redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE) with a catalyst supported on conducting substrates.7–9 The CE is responsible for transferring electrons from the external circuit to the electrolyte through catalytic reduction of oxidized species in the electrolyte, affecting substantially the photovoltaic performance of a cell device.10–13
With superior electrocatalytic activity toward polysulfide redox couples, metal chalcogenides especially copper sulfides are the most commonly used catalysts in CEs.11,14–17 However, copper sulfides dissociated from CEs may cling to the photoanode surface, consequently poisoning the photoanode and deteriorating the photovoltaic performance.18 Moreover, the poor long-term stability and relatively low surface area also hinder their performance as CEs.15,19 Owing to the good electrochemical catalytic activity, sufficient electrical conductivity, high durability and low cost, carbon materials are now considered as competitive candidates for new electrode materials in QDSCs.8,20–24 A series of pure carbons, such as mesoporous carbon, graphene, carbon nanofiber and foam, have been studied and confirmed to be effective for polysulfide reduction.8,12,20–24 Remarkably, N doped mesoporous carbon has exhibited better catalytic activity, pushing the PCE of QDSCs to a new level recently in our lab,25 which preliminarily reveals the potential application of heteroatom doped carbon in QDSCs. It is noteworthy that pure or light heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts reported for QDSCs are generally hydrophobic,20–26 which prevents the carbon materials from making full use of their advantage on highly specific surfaces and coming in contact with polysulfide aqueous electrolyte in the same plane.27–29 To further improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs based on carbons, the development of catalysts with comprehensive properties of both superior catalytic activity and good hydrophilicity to polysulfide redox media is therefore highly desired.
Being a new class of crystalline porous materials, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)30,31 with diversified and tailorable microstructures recently have been proven to be versatile precursors/sacrificial templates for the preparation of various homogeneous hetero-doping carbons with predetermined functionalities via the thermolysis process.32–41 Different from other precursors, both non-metallic elements (such as N and S from organic ligands) and metal ions are regularly arranged in the three dimensional framework structure of MOFs (as shown in Scheme 1).42–46 After pyrolysis, these non-metallic and metallic elements could be uniformly dispersed in the carbon skeletons.40,43–45 In the presence of a large amount of active heteroatoms, the electrical conductivity and surface polarity of carbons can be significantly enhanced. Moreover, the originally hydrophobic carbons become hydrophilic, which is crucial to the heterogeneous catalytic reactions occurring in a water system.47 Notably, the partly preserved high porosity and long-range ordering structure of MOFs may lead to the formation of porous carbon nanomaterials with high specific surface areas.48–51 Until now, porous carbon materials derived from MOFs have been extensively studied and demonstrated to be excellent catalysts for many reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.52–60 Unfortunately, no relevant studies on MOF-derived carbons as the catalysts in QDSC CEs have been reported in the literature, although MOFs are potentially ideal precursors to prepare carbon materials with all desired characteristics for the catalysts in QDSCs.

Herein, for the first time, Co and N co-doped porous carbon nanomaterials were prepared for high performance catalysts in QDSCs. By utilizing a series of zeolite-type-MOFs as precursors for pyrolysis, the derived porous carbons exhibit not only large specific surface area and high conductivity, but also homogeneous multi-doping and excellent hydrophilicity that have not been achieved simultaneously using other precursors. Owing to these advantages, the obtained carbons exhibit superior catalytic performance toward polysulfide electrolytes. Impressively, among the carbonaceous catalysts deposited on a FTO glass substrate reported thus far, the highest PCE for QDSCs based on Co,N-bidoped carbons of 9.12% was observed in this work.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis of ZIF-8 nanocrystals
The ZIF-8 nanocrystals were synthesized according to a literature method.34 Typically, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.68 g, 5.65 mmol) and 2-methylimidazole (3.70 g, 0.045 M) were dissolved in 80 mL and 80 mL of methanol, respectively. The above two solutions were then mixed together under vigorous stirring for 24 h. The white precipitates, ZIF-8 nanocrystals, were separated by centrifugation and then washed twice with methanol followed by drying for 12 h at 50 °C.
Synthesis of ZIF-67 nanocrystals
The ZIF-67 nanocrystals were synthesized according to literature methods.34 Typically, 0.45 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 3 mL of water, and 5.5 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved 20 mL of deionized water. The 2-methylimidazole water solution was added into the Co(NO3)2·6H2O water solution under vigorous stirring for 6 h at room temperature. The above mixture was separated by centrifugation and rinsed with water and methanol in sequence for three times. Finally, the dark purple precipitate was dried at 50 °C for 12 h. The ZIF-67 powder was obtained and preserved in a thermostatic drier box for further use.
Synthesis of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework (BMZIF) nanocrystals
The BMZIF nanocrystals (denoted as BMZIF-n, n refers to the ratio of Co/Zn) were prepared based on the synthetic procedure of ZIF-8. Typically, a mixture of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O with the desired molar ratio (0.025, 0.035, 0.05, and 0.1, with the nanocrystals denoted as BMZIF-0.025, BMZIF-0.035, BMZIF-0.05 and BMZIF-0.1) was dissolved in 80 mL of methanol. 2-Methylimidazole (3.70 g, 0.045 M) was dissolved in 80 mL of methanol, followed by addition into the above mixture under vigorous stirring. After reacting for 24 h at room temperature, the BMZIF nanocrystals were obtained, followed by purification based on the same process as for ZIF-8.
Synthesis of MOF-5 nanocrystals
MOF-5 nanocrystals were prepared according to the literature.47 Generally, 0.51 g of terephthalic acid and 0.85 mL of triethylamine were dissolved in 40 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Simultaneously, 1.7 g of Zn(OAc)2·2H2O was dissolved in 50 mL of DMF. The two solutions were mixed together at room temperature with vigorous stirring. After reacting for 2.5 h, the precipitates were obtained by centrifugation, and then immersed in DMF for 12 h. The MOF-5 DMF system was centrifuged again and washed with CHCl3 twice. The resultant particles were dried in air for 1−2 h.
Preparation of porous carbon materials from MOF precursors
500 mg of as-prepared nanocrystals was activated at 200 °C under vacuum for 4 h in a tubular furnace and heated to 900 °C at the heating rate of 5 °C min−1, followed by carbonization at 900 °C for 2 h under a flowing Ar atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature naturally, porous nanoparticle materials were obtained. The carbon materials obtained are abbreviated as Co@CoN–C-0, Co@CoN–C-0.025, Co@CoN–C-0.035, Co@CoN–C-0.05, Co@CoN–C-0.1, Co@CoN–C-1 and C-MOF-5, which correspond to the precursors ZIF-8, BMZIF-0.025, BMZIF-0.035, BMZIF-0.05, BMZIF-0.1, ZIF-67 and MOF-5, respectively. All the obtained carbon materials were treated with H2SO4 at 80 °C for 5 h, and washed with water and alcohol respectively. Finally, the powder was collected by centrifugation and further dried at 50 °C. The acid-treated carbon materials are abbreviated as CoN–C-0, CoN–C-0.025, CoN–C-0.035, CoN–C-0.05, CoN–C-0.1 and CoN–C-1, which correspond to the precursors ZIF-8, BMZIF-0.025, BMZIF-0.035, BMZIF-0.05, BMZIF-0.1 and ZIF-67, respectively.
Preparation of CEs
The CEs with different carbon materials (CoN–C-0, CoN–C-0.025, CoN–C-0.035, CoN–C-0.05, CoN–C-0.1, CoN–C-1, C-MOF-5 AC, N-MC, MC) were prepared using the same procedure. First, a bright yellow colloidal adhesive was obtained by stirring a mixture of 8 mL terpineol, 500 μL titanium-isopropoxide and 200 mg ethyl cellulose for two days. Then, 50 mg of various carbon materials was milled together with the home-made adhesive for 1.5 h to get a sticky paste. CEs based on different carbon materials were obtained by screen printing the pastes on cleaned FTO glass, followed by calcination in an argon atmosphere at 450 °C for 30 min.21
Fabrication of solar cell devices
First, a mesostructure TiO2 film electrode with 25 μm transparent layer and 5 μm light scattering layer was prepared by a successive screen printing method according to the previous procedure.61 Then, 45 μL of the obtained Zn–Cu–In–Se QD solution was dropped onto the pre-synthesized mesostructure TiO2 film electrodes for 2 h at 35 °C. After QDs loading, a ZnS passivation layer was coated on the surface of QD sensitized TiO2 film by alternately dipping the sensitized film into 0.1 M Zn(OAc)2·2H2O methanol solution and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 6 cycles.2,62,63 The cells were assembled using the Zn–Cu–In–Se QD sensitized TiO2 film photoanode and various carbon based CEs. A poly(vinylpyrrolidone) modified polysulfide electrolyte was used as the redox shuttle.64
3. Results and discussion
Preparation and morphology characterization
A series of Co,Zn-bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) precursors (denoted as ZIF-n, n indicates the molar ratio of Co/Zn; n = 0 and 1 related to ZIF-8 and ZIF-67, respectively) were prepared by mixing Zn(NO3)2 and/or Co(NO3)2 with 2-methylimidazole in methanol according to the literature method.34 The ZIF nanoparticles obtained were further pyrolyzed at 900 °C, followed by sulfuric acid treatment to produce the resultant Co,N-bidoped carbon nanomaterials (denoted as CoN–C-n, n means the same as that of ZIF-n; n = 0 and 1 relate to the carbons derived from ZIF-8 and ZIF-67, respectively). Notably, Zn ions in the framework of MOFs are converted to ZnO first and then reduced by carbons to give Zn metal during carbonization. Since Zn is evaporated under the experimental conditions, no Zn metal or Zn dopant is left in the resultant heteroatom-doped carbons.35,41,55 For comparison, MOF derived porous carbons without the heteroatom dopant (denoted as C-MOF-5) were also synthesized using MOF-5 as the precursor.47 In addition, both mesoporous carbon (denoted as MC) and N-doped carbon (denoted as N-MC), exhibiting the best photovoltaic performances in recent QDSC related studies,21,25,26 were also prepared by the conventional carbonization of organics.65
The ZIF-0.035 precursor and its corresponding carbon nanomaterial were chosen as representatives to investigate the morphology change before and after pyrolysis. From the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Fig. 1a, certain amount of Co metal is encapsulated inside the initial carbon materials derived from ZIF-0.035 (denoted as Co@CoN–C-0.035). As can be seen from Fig. 1b, Co metal encapsulated however can be mostly removed by acid treatment, which can also be demonstrated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) spectra (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The peak at 51° for the Co@CoN–C-0.035 sample, corresponding to Co metal diffraction of (200), disappears after acid treatment. Despite the removal of Co metal by acid treatment, the resultant CoN–C-0.035 still has a similar size distribution (ca. 60 nm) to that of Co@CoN–C-0.035. In addition, from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images illustrated in Fig. S2† the resultant CoN–C-0.035 nanomaterials are well dispersed and exhibit similar polyhedral morphology to the corresponding ZIF-0.035 precursors, indicating that the carbons obtained preserve the morphology of the ZIF precursors and no aggregation occurs during the pyrolysis process and acid treatment.

The CoN–C-n based CEs were developed via screen printing for the construction of QDSCs.61 Although carbon catalysts supported on Ti mesh as CEs have recently led to the highest PCE record of QDSCs,25 the CEs fabricated suffer from the severe leakage of the polysulfide electrolyte in a few minutes, resulting in the rapid performance deterioration of the QDSCs constructed. Taking this into consideration, the conductive F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was employed herein as the support to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the carbons obtained. With FTO supported CoN–C-n and the reference carbons (C-MOF-5 derived from MOF-5, MC, N-MC and commercial activated carbon (AC)) as CEs, QDSC devices were fabricated using Zn–Cu–In–Se QDs as the sensitizer and a polysulfide water solution as the electrolyte. The optimized thickness of carbon film layers in the CE was confirmed to be 3 layers (see Fig. S3 and Table S1†), and in the following discussion, all the CEs investigated are based on the optimized thickness.
Photovoltaic performance of the different CEs
To evaluate the electrocatalytic activity, the J–V curves of Co,N-bidoped carbons and reference carbons based QDSCs were measured under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 G solar light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 2a and b. The relevant photovoltaic parameters of both average and champion values are presented in Table 1. With the increase in Co dopant ratio in carbons (from CoN–C-0 to CoN–C-0.035), the Voc value remains almost unchanged but the values of Jsc and FF increase significantly. Nevertheless, with further increase in Co dopant ratio (from CoN–C-0.035 to CoN–C-1), the photovoltaic parameters start to decline, and an impressive PCE of 9.12% was achieved on the CoN–C-0.035 based CE. Notably, when CoN–C-0 (that is N-doped carbons prepared from ZIF-8) is used as the electrocatalyst in CEs, the cells exhibit an average PCE value of 7.23%, better than that of the QDSCs based on the reference carbons (C-MOF-5, MC, N-MC and AC) but obviously lower than that of CoN–C-0.035 based QDSCs. The results reflect the excellent catalytic activity of carbons doped with heteroatoms especially Co dopants for polysulfide reduction.

A similar performance trend could be observed from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Two semicircles in the Nyquist plots can be found in Fig. 3a and b. The first semicircle at the high frequency region reflects the resistance (R1) of the solid contact between the catalyst and FTO substrate, while the next semicircle at the lower frequency region relates to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface of the CE/electrolyte.21,26,66 The intercept of the first semicircle on the real axis is the collected electrode resistance (Rs). The equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S4† was applied to fit the EIS. As can be seen from Fig. 3a and Table 2, with the increase in Co dopant ratio, the Rct values of Co,N-bidoped carbon based CEs decrease first and then increase. The lowest Rct was observed on CoN–C-0.035 carbon catalysts, suggesting the superior catalytic performance of CoN–C-0.035 among the Co,N-bidoped carbon catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3b and Table 2, the Rs values of Co,N-bidoped carbons are on the whole smaller than those of reference carbon materials, resulting mainly from the excellent conductivity of Co,N-bidoped carbons provided by the graphitized carbons. Moreover, the R1 values of Co,N-bidoped carbons are relatively lower than those of C-MOF-5, MC and N-MC, indicating a lower electron transfer resistance at the interface between Co,N-bidoped carbon catalysts and the FTO substrate. Most importantly, the Rct values of Co,N-bidoped carbons, especially CoN–C-0.035, are significantly lower than those of all references, which demonstrates the superior electrocatalytic activity of the Co,N-bidoped carbons derived from ZIF for polysulfide reduction.

Fig. 3c and d shows the Tafel polarization curves of symmetric dummy cells based on CoN–C-n and reference carbons. Theoretically, exchange current density (J0) is inversely proportional to Rct and follows eqn (1).14,67,68 (1)where R, T, F and n represent the gas constant, temperature, Faraday constant and the number of electrons involved in the reaction, respectively. J0 can be determined by the intersection of anodic and cathodic branches at equilibrium potential (V = 0 V).10 As can be observed from Fig. 4a and b, J0 changes in the order of CoN–C-0.035 > CoN–C-0.05 > CoN–C-0.025 > CoN–C-0.1 > CoN–C-1 > CoN–C-0 > AC > C-MOF-5 > N-MC > MC, in agreement with the relationship between J0 and Rct from EIS analysis.

It is well-acknowledged that a higher peak current corresponds to a better electrocatalytic performance of CEs in cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves.10 CV measurements were thus conducted at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As illustrated in Fig. 4a and b the CoN-0.035 based CE presents the best catalytic activity among Co,N-bidoped carbon and the reference carbons based CEs, which further validates the J–V, EIS and Tafel results. Remarkably, the photovoltaic performance of Co,N-bidoped carbon based QDSCs, especially for CoN–C-0.035, is superior to that of the pure carbon or N-doped carbon based QDSCs, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Therefore, the materials were subsequently characterized to investigate the origin of their high efficiency.
Efficient working mechanism of Co,N-bidoped carbon based CEs
From the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (the inset of Fig. 1b), the presence of abundant graphitic lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 3.4 Å corresponding to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon can be observed, indicating the high degree of graphitization of carbons derived from ZIFs. Such a result is further confirmed by the XRD spectra as shown in Fig. S5.† For all CoN–C-n samples, two carbon diffractions of (002) and (101) located at 26° and 44° can be found. The degree of graphitization is effectively enhanced by the increase in the doping content of Co, which can be ascribed to the catalytic ability of Co atoms toward the graphitization of carbon. The positive influence of the presence of Co on graphitization is also reflected by a lower ID/IG value in Raman spectra (Fig. S6†). The smaller ID/IG the value, the better the graphitization.37,69 The ratio of the intensities of the two peaks at 1350 (ID) and 1590 cm−1 (IG) decreases with the increase in Co content. Notably, the high degree of graphitization of the resultant Co,N-bidoped carbons guarantees the conductivity of the CE that is beneficial to the charge transport to the active catalyst sites from the conductive FTO substrate.
Elemental mapping, whose results are illustrated in Fig. S7†, was conducted for CoN–C-0.035 samples, confirming that N and Co are dispersed uniformly in the carbon matrix prepared. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was then applied to confirm the form in which Co and N-doping atoms are present. As shown in Fig. 5a, there are four peaks of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Co 2p located at 284.6, 400.1, 531.4, and 780.5 eV, respectively. In the high-resolution Co 2p spectra shown in Fig. 5b, a peak at 782.5 eV corresponding to Co–Nx can be found.34 It should be noted that there is no characteristic peak for the Co metal. The results demonstrate that Co species might mainly be anchored on the carbon network, existing in the form of the Co–Nx moiety. As for the high-resolution N 1s spectra of CoN–C-0.035 shown in Fig. 5c, peaks at 401.4, 400.5, 398.5, and 399.2 eV, corresponding to graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N and Co–Nx, respectively,34,70,71 can be observed (Table S3†). It has been verified that Co–Nx, graphitic-N and pyridinic-N are all of high activity in many catalytic reactions.34,36,47,55,70,71

It is well-known that surface wettability of catalysts plays a crucial role in the interactions between heterogeneous catalysts and reactants, consequently directly affecting their activity.47 To examine the wettability of CoN–C-n by water, CoN–C-n and reference carbons were dispersed in a mixture of ethyl acetate and water solution (the upper part is the ethyl acetate phase and the bottom is the water phase), as shown in Fig. 6a. Obviously, CoN–C-n can be well dispersed in the water phase, indicating the hydrophilic nature of the doped carbons derived from ZIFs. By contrast, the hydrophobic reference carbon materials, C-MOF-5, MC, N-MC and AC, prepared from the pyrolysis of organics, can only stay in the ethyl acetate phase or accumulate at the interface. The hydrophilicity of Co,N-bidoped carbons prepared by the carbonization of ZIFs has been ascribed to the existence of graphitic-N that induces the permanent polarization between graphitic-N and adjacent C and thus facilitates the interaction between N species and nucleophilic water molecules.47 Moreover, the porosity of the obtained CoN–C-n was characterized by N2 adsorption at 77 K (Fig. 6b). With the increase in Co dopants, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the corresponding carbon materials decrease obviously (Table S4†), which is consistent with literature results.34 It is expected that the large hydrophilic surface area as well as hierarchical pore structure of the Co,N-bidoped carbons prepared (Fig. S8 and Table S4†) guarantees rapid diffusion of the electrolyte into the pores of catalysts and the subsequent exposure of active sites to reactant species, thus facilitating the catalytic reaction at the CE surface.

Regarding the fact that the BET surface areas of the heteroatom-doped carbons from CoN–C-0 to CoN–C-0.035 decrease with the increase in Co dopant ratio, the enhanced performance of Co,N-bidoped carbon based QDSCs could possibly result from the increase in Co–Nx active sites that exhibit excellent catalytic ability in polysulfide reduction. To verify Co–Nx of Co,N-bidoped carbon as possible active sites for efficient CE materials, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to understand the polysulfide reduction reactions (SRRs) occurring on the CE.
Since the exact species involved in the electrode reaction and reaction mechanisms appear to be rather complicated and still remain elusive for SRRs, all the possible dissociative reactions starting from S42− and S32− which occupy the overwhelmingly dominant in concentration72 were computationally investigated. Different from the fast step I3−(aq) → I2(aq) + I−(aq) for the I−/I3− redox couple (aq represents the aqueous solution), the direct dissociation of Sn2−(aq) (n ≥ 2) is almost thermodynamically unfavorable, especially for the formation of neutral Sn which is significantly endothermic (Table S5†). This is consistent with the general consensus that its reverse reaction, S2−(aq) + Sn−1(aq) → Sn2−(aq), is pretty rapid in the Na2S electrolyte. Exceptionally, the dissociation of tetrasulfide to form supersulfide S2− (S42−(aq) → 2S2−(aq)) is quite close to equilibrium (Table S5†). Moreover, S2− has also been reported to possess an intimate relationship with the hole-recovery in this photoelectrochemical system.73 In addition, all the calculated standard reduction potentials Eθvs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) of Sn2−(aq) + 2e → S2−(aq) + Sn−12−(aq) are more negative than −2.0 V (Table S6†), indicating that S2− would scarcely be produced at the CE. Comparing all the possible two-electron electrode SRRs starting with Sn2− (n ≥ 2), S42−(aq) + 2e → 2S22−(aq) has the least negative Eθ (Table S6†), indicating that it is most likely to occur at the CE and mainly contributes to the cell efficiency. The electrode reactions for the S42−/S22− redox couple may occur via one of the following mechanisms:
Mechanism (I):    
Mechanism (II):    (iii) 2S2−(aq) → S42−(aq);where * denotes the free site on the electrode surface. Analogous to the free adsorption energy of H and I respectively for the hydrogen evolution reaction74 and iodine reduction reaction,75 the free adsorption energy of S2− () and the electron transfer from catalyst materials to  are of great importance regardless of which mechanism mentioned above is followed. The  of the best possible catalyst would be located in a proper window achieving the best balance for adsorption and desorption related steps.76 For the SRR, we can obtain  ∈ [0.00, 0.23] eV following mechanism I while  ∈ [0.12, 0.35] eV following mechanism II for the best possible catalysts (see Scheme S1†). The calculated  on pristine graphene, N-graphene and Co–Nx site (Fig. 7) are respectively −0.08, 0.05 and 0.34 eV. This indicates that N-doped and Co,N-bidoped carbon materials are promising materials for the SRR.

We also checked the electron transfer possibility between S2− and including graphene, N-graphene and Co–N4@graphene materials. As displayed in Fig. S9,† the electrode potentials of the conduction band minimum of graphene, N-graphene and Co–Nx are all more positive than S42−(aq) + 2e → 2S22−(aq), indicating that thermodynamically these materials are likely to reduce S42− to S22−. However, it is clear from the charge density difference for  in Fig. 7 that no chemical bonding is present between S2− and graphene or N-graphene. This indicates that the electron transfer from graphene or N-graphene to S2− might be more difficult than that on Co,N-bidoped materials. Hence, the Co–Nx sites would be an active candidate for the SRR.
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the excessive increase in Co dopant ratio could possibly dramatically decrease the surface areas of the Co,N-bidoped carbons, reducing the contact area of efficient active sites with polysulfide electrolytes. As a result, the photovoltaic parameters start to decline from CoN–C-0.035 to CoN–C-1. Hence, among Co,N-bidoped carbons derived from ZIFs, CoN–C-0.035 was proved to the optimal catalyst in CEs, achieving an impressive PCE of 9.12%.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, homogeneously Co,N-bidoped porous carbons were for the first time attempted as electrocatalysts in QDSCs. A series of zeolite-like MOFs were employed as precursors to synthesize Co,N-bidoped carbon nanomaterials CoN–C-n via carbonization and subsequent acid treatment. The CoN–C-n obtained were deposited on FTO glass via screen printing to develop CEs for the construction of QDSCs. It was found that the Co,N-bidoped carbons have higher electrocatalytic activity toward polysulfide reduction than reference carbons, such as pure mesoporous carbons derived from MOF-5, N-doped carbons from ZIF-8, MC and N-doped MC derived from organics as well as the commercial active carbons. DFT methods further confirm that the Co–Nx active sites are beneficial for the electrocatalytic performance of CEs. The superior performance of CoN–C-n CEs could be attributed to the advantages as follows: abundant Co and N dopants providing plentiful active sites; a large hydrophilic surface area ensuring thorough exposure of active sites to polysulfide species; a high degree of graphitization guaranteeing the electrical conductivity of CEs and consequently promoting the charge carrier transport. With the CoN–C-0.035 based CE, PCE up to 9.12% was observed on the Zn–Cu–In–Se QDSCs, significantly higher than that of the reported QDSCs based on carbonaceous materials supported on FTO.
