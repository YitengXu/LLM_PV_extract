ortho-Functionalized perylene diimides (PDIs) display better electronic properties than their bay-substituted counterparts, yet their synthesis requires expensive catalysts. We report the regioselective 2,5,8,11-functionalization of PDI via the less commonly observed 1,4-addition of aryl Grignard reagents. This direct functionalization offers a simple and low-cost method to synthesize desirable ortho-substituted PDIs. Four tetraarylated PDIs are reported along with their electronic and optoelectronic properties. Preliminary organic photovoltaic devices using these molecules as non-fullerene acceptors showed good power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 5%, a new record for an acceptor with a single PDI core.
Introduction
Perylene diimides (PDIs) have been the focus of intensive scientific research for decades and are prized for their electronic and optoelectronic properties.1–4 PDIs exhibit excellent redox properties, environmental stability, and high charge mobilities in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) as well as field effect transistors (OFETs).5–7 Their high electron affinities and absorption profiles, in particular, have made PDIs popular as alternative acceptor materials in fullerene-free, i.e., non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), OPVs.8–10 To this end, hundreds of PDI derivatives have been synthesized, though functionalization has been limited to the imide and bay (1,6,7,12-) positions.11–16 While modifying the imide substituents has an important effect on the material's solubility and self-assembly it rarely influences the frontier energy levels of the molecule. Alternatively, substitution at the bay position, unless fully fused, leads to twisting in the perylene core, disrupting π–π stacking and subsequent charge transport in thin-films.17–19 A much more attractive approach is to functionalize the less sterically encumbered ortho-positions (2,5,8,11-). In fact, research published this year showed a marked improvement in photovoltaic performance for ortho-functionalized PDIs versus bay-functionalized.20,21 To date, however, only a comparatively modest number of ortho-functionalized PDIs have been reported.22–25 This is because ortho-functionalization was only recently achieved and uses expensive ruthenium or iridium-catalyzed reactions (Scheme 1).26–29 In 2009 Shinokubo's group realized the ruthenium catalyzed ortho-coupling of terminal alkenes to PDIs, generating tetraalkylated PDIs.26 This was followed by the regioselective borylation of PDI with iridium or ruthenium catalysts, enabling 2,5,8,11-tetraarylated PDIs in two steps (Scheme 1).28,29 These limited examples demonstrate the need for additional synthetic methods for the ortho-functionalization of PDIs which are scalable and do not require expensive catalysts.

Herein, we report the regioselective ortho-functionalization of PDIs via the Grignard reaction. This simple and low-cost synthetic method yields 2,5,8,11-tetraarylated PDIs in one step, with only partially functionalized PDI as side products. No addition of the Grignard reagent is observed to the bay position or to the imide carbonyl. Instead only 1,4-addition products were observed. While this unusual conjugate addition has been previously observed in acene-based quinones,30 this is the first instance of a 1,4-addition of aryl Grignard reagents on PDI. The versatility of this reaction was probed through the use of several aryl substituents (mesitylene, thiophene and etc.) and two PDI cores (PDI 1 and S-annulated PDI-2S), resulting in four novel isolable PDI derivatives: PDI-4Mes, PDI-4Th, PDI-2S-4Mes, and PDI-2S-4Th (Scheme 2). All the molecules synthesized serve as good NFAs, confirmed through preliminary, OPV device studies showing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 5%, a new record for an acceptor with a single PDI core.31–33

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes to target molecules PDI-4Mes, PDI-4Th, PDI-2S-4Mes, and PDI-2S-4Th are shown in Scheme 2. The reaction of 1 with excess Grignard reagent (2 × 10 equiv.) 2-thienylmagnesium or 2-mesitylmagnesium bromide afforded 2,5,8,11-tetraaryl substituted PDIs PDI-4Mes and PDI-4Th in reasonable yields, as confirmed by NMR, mass spectroscopy, and X-ray single crystal structures (Fig. 1). The high regioselectivity of the Grignard reagent to undergo 1,4 addition allows for the clean formation of ortho-arylated PDIs. The formation of mono-, di-, and tri-substituted PDI was also observed, though additional Grignard reagent could be used to push the reaction. Furthermore, bulky aromatic substituents such as triphenylamine and pyrene were also used in the 1,4-addition but we were unable to isolate the tetra-substituted PDI products, due to similar polarities between mono, di and tri-substituted products. In addition, we note that when we attempted the same addition using aryllithium reagents, as was recently demonstrated in acenequinones, we found only a mixture of uncharacterized products.34,35
 Fig. 1  Crystal structures of PDI-4Mes and PDI-4Th showing ortho-functionalization. Thermal ellipsoids are shown at 50% probability level (purple, red and yellow colors represent nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur atoms, respectively). The hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. 
In an effort to increase yields and explore the versatility of the reaction we prepared the S-heterocyclic annulated PDI-2S according to literature via a Stille-type coupling reaction between 2 and bis(tributyltin)sulfide.36,37 The hope was that the slightly electron withdrawing sulfur atoms would make the ortho-position more electron deficient and favor the addition reaction. Indeed, under the same conditions, both PDI-2S-4Mes and PDI-2S-4Th were obtained in higher yields (up to 50%). We suggest that the ortho positions in PDI are more favorable for 1,4-addition due to mostly three reasons: (i) conjugate (Michael type) addition, (ii) coordination of Mg(X) with the imide carbonyl and (iii) lesser steric encumbrance in the ortho than in the bay positions. All the tetraarylated PDIs remain highly soluble in common organic solvents.
We obtained crystals of all the molecules by slow evaporation from dichloromethane (DCM)/ethanol solutions, but only those of PDI-4Mes and PDI-4Th were suitable for X-ray diffraction. PDI-4Mes crystallizes in a triclinic unit cell, space group P, while PDI-4Th crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell, space group P21/n. Both tetraarylated PDIs have planar perylene cores, confirming the lack of steric strain associated with ortho-substitution. The torsion angles between the aryl substituents and the core for PDI-4Mes and PDI-4Th are 76.2° and 64.4°, respectively, which is expected considering the extra bulkiness of mesitylene (Fig. 1).
To better understand the role of ortho-substitution with and without S-annulation of the perylene core, DFT calculations and photophysical experiments were performed on all the molecules. Optimized geometries showed planar perylene cores in 1, PDI-4Mes, PDI-4Th and PDI-2S-4Th, but interestingly PDI-2S and PDI-2S-4Mes appeared bowed by ∼6–7° (Fig. S1, ESI†), though reported crystal structures of S-annulated PDI are planar.37 This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the optimized gas phase “bowed” model represents a stabilizing force of less than 2 kcal mol−1 from planar and is therefore not indicative of the molecular structure in bulk, where planarity is preferred for π–π stacking. In all the molecules the HOMO and LUMO frontier molecular orbitals were delocalized throughout the PDI core, with the exception of PDI-4Th, where the HOMO is localized on the thiophene rings (Fig. 2). Though the torsion angles remain comparable, the aryl substituents had a greater impact on the energy levels of PDI-2S than on PDI, raising the HOMO by up to ∼0.17 eV in the case of PDI-2S-4Mes (Table 1).

The absorption spectra of the new PDI derivatives show intense absorption bands between 400 and 580 nm and typical vibronic splitting due to the rigid π-conjugated perylene core (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The UV-vis absorption spectrum of PDI-4Th is slightly red-shifted versus PDI 1, in agreement with the calculated narrowing of its HOMO–LUMO gap. Surprisingly, the absorption spectrum of PDI-2S-4Th is significantly broadened compared to PDI-4Th, while the spectra of the other derivatives retain PDI's vibronic structure. This broadening may be explained by increased orbital overlap facilitating the HOMO–LUMO transition as the HOMO orbital moves from the twisted thiophene units in PDI-4Th to the sulfur-annulated core in PDI-2S-4Th (Fig. 2). TD-DFT calculations support this hypothesis, theorizing an oscillator strength of 0.003 and 0.205 for the lowest energy transition in PDI-4Th and PDI-2S-4Th, respectively. All the molecules exhibit lowered emissivities and stokes shifts of 11, 13, 25, and 75 nm, respectively for PDI-4Mes, PDI-2S-4Mes, PDI-4Th, and PDI-2S-4Th (Table 1 and Fig. S3, ESI†). The higher stoke shift of PDI-2S-4Th is in agreement with its broader absorption and suggests greater rotational freedom with thiophene substituents.

Electrochemical measurements revealed two reversible reduction waves for all the molecules, while no oxidation waves were observed in the solvent window. (Table 1 and Fig. S2, ESI†). The LUMO levels appeared unchanged by the introduction of thiophene substituents, but did increase by ∼0.1 eV in the case of mesitylene. The highly twisted nature of these ortho-substituents seems to limit their influence on the energy levels of the molecules. The LUMO level of PDI-4Mes, PDI-2S-4Mes, PDI-4Th, and PDI-2S-4Th is −3.63 eV, −3.76 eV, −3.62 eV, and −3.70 eV, respectively, suggesting they could serve as good electron acceptors.38,39
Solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells using PDI-4Mes, PDI-4Th, PDI-2S-4Mes, and PDI-2S-4Th as acceptors were fabricated and the device performance is shown in Table 2. Photovoltaic properties of the PDIs as electron acceptor in bulk-heterojunction solar cells were investigated with an inverted device configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PDIs/MoO3/Ag. PTB7-Th was chosen as the donor material for its complementary absorption and well matched energy levels with the PDI acceptors (Fig. S4, ESI†). A mixture of PTB7-Th and PDI with a w/w ratio of 1:1.8 was dissolved in chloroform with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 for spin-coating of the active layer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the primary devices are shown in Fig. 4a. The mesitylene substituted PDIs showed excellent open circuit voltages (VOC) of ∼1.0 V, indicating good energy level pairing with the donor polymer. Lower VOC was observed for the thiophene substituted PDIs, in line with their lower LUMO levels. Higher short circuit currents (JSC) in the PDI-4Th and PDI-2S-4Th devices, however, led to better PCEs overall. These devices also showed broader responses to light compared to those using mesitylene functionalized PDI, as seen in the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) (Fig. 4b). The EQE of PDI-2S-4Th devices is already over 50%, indicating definite promise in OPV for these materials as NFAs. In fact, devices made using PDI-2S-4Th displayed PCEs over 5%, the highest PCE reported among single PDI core materials using polymer as the donor material.10–12 Similar PCEs have only been previously achieved using much larger and complicated structures, such as fused bis-PDI,40 star shaped tri-PDI,41 and quasi-spherical tetra-PDI.42

Conclusions
In this work we demonstrate that the 1,4-addition Grignard reaction can be an inexpensive and effective method to directly functionalize the 2,5,8,11-positions of PDI with different aryl substituents. This opens new avenues for the synthesis of additional ortho-functionalized PDI derivatives, which are more attractive than the commonly seen bay-functionalized PDIs due to their planar perylene core. Four 2,5,8,11-tetraarylated PDI derivatives were synthesized and characterized. Despite the addition of aromatic rings to the PDI core, the electronic properties of tetraarylated PDIs are still very similar to PDI due to large torsion angles between substituent and core. The materials' low-lying and reversible reductions suggest they are suitable non-fullerene acceptors. Our preliminary photovoltaic studies confirm this, as evidenced by a 5% PCE for compound PDI-2S-4Th, the highest PCE reported for an acceptor with a single PDI core.
