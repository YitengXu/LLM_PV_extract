    , Accepted 4th March 2014First published on 17th March 2014AbstractHierarchically organized mesoporous carbon–TiO2 inverse opal nanostructures were synthesized by complementary colloid and block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly, where the triblock copolymer P123 acts simultaneously as the template and the carbon source. Highly ordered mesoporous inverse opal nanostructures with a nano-textured surface morphology and multiple-length scale nanopores provide increased light-activated surface area and scattering effects, leading to enhanced photoabsorption efficiency and the transport of matter. UV-vis absorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Mott–Schottky measurement studies show that incorporation of carbon moieties into TiO2via direct conversion of BCPs creates a new energy level above the valence band of TiO2, resulting in an effective decrease in the band gap. A significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity was demonstrated for the mesoporous carbon–TiO2 inverse opals in terms of the degradation of p-nitrophenol (∼79%) and photoelectrochemical water splitting (∼0.087%).
1 Introduction
Nanostructured semiconductor photocatalysts have been considered essential elements in recent energy conversion and storage as well as environmental remediation. Of the numerous candidates, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been recognized as a representative photocatalyst due to its good stability, nontoxicity, and UV absorbance.1 For the enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiency, much effort has been made to achieve control over the size, morphology, electronic structure and preparation method. In particular, mesoporous structures have been actively studied due to their large accessible surface area and well-defined uniform pore size and excellent connectivity, in which both effective charge carrier transfer and efficient mass flow of the reactants are attained.2,3 Commercially available amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide-block-propylene oxide-block-ethylene oxide) triblock copolymers, typically Pluronic P123, have been widely used as the structure-directing agents for the construction of highly organized mesoporous TiO2. Three-dimensional (3D) inverse opal structures mediated by colloidal particle assemblies were suggested as another promising class of photocatalysts with a high surface area.4–7 It can be suggested as a photon trapping structure in which the effective optical path length is increased by several times, triggered by scattering effects. For instance, Zhou et al.8 reported that periodically ordered 3D inverse opal photoelectrode films showed a much higher photocurrent density than disordered films in the photoelectrochemical water splitting. In this regard, it is an intriguing and crucial task to develop TiO2 based systems having a hierarchically organized high surface area and light trapping effects in order to maximize the photocatalytic efficiency.
However, one of the major drawbacks of TiO2 is the low efficiency under visible light illumination due to the large band gap (∼3.2 eV), corresponding to a threshold wavelength of 388 nm, which inherently limits the activity only under UV light irradiation.9 For useful utilization of solar energy, the development of visible light-induced photocatalysts is most important. Numerous attempts have been devoted to prepare solar-driven photocatalysts including metal or nonmetal doping,10–19 coupling of narrow band gap semiconductors,20,21 and dye sensitization.22 In particular, doping with nonmetals such as carbon,10–15 sulfur,16 nitrogen17 is known to modify the electronic structure of TiO2, thereby narrowing the band gap. Among the various nonmetal dopants, carbon doping has been theoretically claimed to have a potential advantage over other types of doping.23 Carbon-doped TiO2 nanostructures satisfy the requirement of an efficient photocatalytic material since their conduction band remains above the redox potential and doped carbon moieties act as sensitizers, synergistically leading to wide visible light absorption and high adsorption of organic pollutants facilitating the interface reaction of photocatalysis. However, conventional approaches to incorporate carbon dopants have limitations in that (i) addition of external carbon precursors is required and (ii) aggregation of carbon species commonly arises. In our previous study, block copolymers (BCPs) were used simultaneously as soft templates and carbon precursors in the synthesis of hybrid carbonaceous materials.24–28 Lin et al.14 fabricated TiO2 photocatalysts doped with uniformly dispersed carbons based on a simple one-step carbonization of a self-assembled matrix consisting of TiO2 precursor and P123. As outlined above, it is essential to construct a universal protocol for the generation of hybrid carbon photocatalysts combined with hierarchical structures with high surface area and viable visible light activity.
Herein, we developed hierarchical hybrid carbon–TiO2 inverse opal nanostructures with mesoporous textures on the surface via complementary colloid templating and direct carbonization of BCP scaffolds, and demonstrated their enhanced photocatalytic activity under UV or visible light illumination. The mesoporous carbon–TiO2 inverse opal was fabricated using polystyrene (PS) beads and P123 as templates. Key to the advanced features of the fabrication route proposed in this study includes facile preparation of carbonaceous nanohybrids via direct conversion of BCPs and incorporation of multiple length scale nanopores in the inverse opals. In order to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of thus-obtained samples, the photodegradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) was selected as a model reaction because the compound is considered to be one of the most refractory substances present in industrial wastewaters with high stability and solubility in water. Photoelectrochemical water splitting was also demonstrated using mesoporous carbon–TiO2 inverse opals under the visible light irradiation. Thus, the enhanced visible light active photocatalysis is systematically investigated based on a new class of hierarchical mesoporous carbon–TiO2 nanostructures by optimizing the composition and morphology. The photocatalytic activities of three different types of TiO2 inverse opals were compared to suggest an optimized nanostructured photocatalyst.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
Ethanol, hydrochloric acid (HCl), and acetylacetone (Acac) were purchased from DAE JUNG chemicals, and styrene, potassium persulfate (PPS), sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), Pluronic P123, tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4, TBOT, 97%), p-nitrophenol (PNP), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2 Synthesis of polystyrene beads
Polystyrene (PS) beads were synthesized by controlled emulsion polymerization. After purging the stabilized DI water under N2 flow for 30 min, PPS initiators and SDS surfactants were added, followed by quick injection of styrene monomers, which had been filtered with alumina. After polymerization at 70 °C for 4 h, PS beads with an average diameter of about 270 nm were obtained.
2.3 Preparation of precursor solutions
The preparation method of triblock copolymer based TiO2 sol–gel precursor is described elsewhere.29 In a typical procedure, the P123 (0.58 g) was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol (5.92 g) and HCl (0.29 g), under vigorous stirring for 1 h. Acac (0.1 g) was then added into this solution and stirred for an additional 20 min. Finally, TBOT (3.4 g) was introduced and the solution was kept for 24 h at room temperature (RT) under stirring. For comparison, TiO2 sol–gel precursor without P123 was also prepared for the fabrication of neat TiO2 inverse opals.
2.4 Fabrication of various inverse opals
In order to fabricate PS opal template, the colloidal dispersion of the PS beads was drop-cast and assembled onto a glass substrate and dried in a convection oven at 60 °C. The hexagonally packed PS opal film was then placed at 90 °C for 1 h to introduce moderate necking between beads. This step was found to improve the adhesion and structural stability of the resultant TiO2 inverse opal films. The substrate with the PS opal template was carefully immersed vertically into a mixture solution of P123 and TiO2 precursors for 5 min to let the solution infiltrate into the close packed PS opals. After the poured template was dried at RT for 24 h, the sample was thermally treated at 90 °C for 24 h to consolidate the inorganic network. Finally, mesoporous TiO2 inverse opals were obtained by heating the sample at 400 °C under ambient conditions. On the other hand, the poured template was exposed to UV light (λ = 254 nm) at RT for 1 h under vacuum conditions and then subsequently carbonized at 600 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 1 h in order to generate hybrid mesoporous carbon–TiO2 inverse opal structures. For comparison, TiO2 inverse opal structures without mesopores were also prepared by calcining the P123 template free samples at 400 °C for 3 h under an air atmosphere.
2.5 Instruments and measurements
The surface morphology was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM6700-F). For the elemental analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed on a JEOL JEM-3011 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The crystalline structure of the neat TiO2 inverse opal, mesoporous TiO2 inverse opal and carbon–TiO2 inverse opal were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) Cu-Kα radiation (D/max RA, Rigaku Co.). Raman scattering spectra were recorded on a T64000 (HORIABA Jobin Yvon, France). The specific surface area and pore diameter distribution of the present structures were examined by measuring nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms with an ASAP 2020 adsorption analyzer at 77 K. All the samples present were degassed at 180 °C for 12 h under vacuum before the adsorption measurement. UV-vis absorbance and diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured using a Sinco S-4100 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were measured on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS, using a dual beam source and ultra-low energy electron beam for charge compensation. The energy scale was calibrated such that 0 eV reflected the position of the Fermi level by defining the adventitious carbon peak as 284.8 eV.30 The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve was recorded on a TA instrument SDT Q600 (TA instrument, USA). The temperature was increased from ambient to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a flow of air. Mott–Schottky measurements were performed in 3 M KCl at 1 kHz using an electrochemical analyser, IVIUMSTAT.XR, IVIUM Technologies.
2.6 Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic degradation of the organic compound on neat TiO2, mesoporous TiO2 and carbon–TiO2 inverse opals were tested under both UV (λ = 254 nm) and visible light irradiation. For the catalytic measurements, the sample was obtained by gently scraping the film off the glass substrates, and 10 ppm of PNP was prepared in 30 ml water. The solution containing the powder sample was kept under stirring. The experimental setup was irradiated using a Xe lamp (Newport Co. Ltd, Model 66984) equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter at a power of 450 W as a visible light source. The decrease in the absorbance of the characteristic peak of PNP was monitored using UV-vis spectroscopy (Varian Cary5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer). The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were done using mesoporous carbon–TiO2 inverse opals on ITO as a working electrode, platinum foil as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl or SCE as a reference electrode, respectively, in a 0.5 M KOH or 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte deaerated by purging N2 gas into the electrolyte. The light emitted from a Xe lamp passed through the window and was irradiated directly onto the TiO2 photoelectrode.
3 Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the entire procedure for fabricating the 3D mesoporous TiO2 (mTiO2) and carbon–TiO2 (mC-TiO2) inverse opal nanostructures. 3D PS bead arrays were prepared first using a colloidal self-assembly (Fig. S1a, ESI†) and a common solution consisting of P123 and TiO2 precursors were fully infiltrated through the interstitial sites of the PS opal template (Fig. S1b, ESI†). After infiltration with the mixture solution, the samples were either calcined at 400 °C under an air atmosphere or subjected to sequential UV exposure in a vacuum followed by calcination at 600 °C in Ar atmosphere to obtain mTiO2 and mC–TiO2 inverse opals, respectively. It is clearly observed that nanoscale pores were generated at the TiO2 and carbon–TiO2 frameworks as shown in Fig. 1a and b as a result of the phase separation between the constituent blocks of P123 and removal of polymer templates. The difference in color due to the presence of carbon can be discerned by the naked eye as can be compared from the microscopic images (insets in Fig. 1). It is also found that the average wall thickness of the mC-TiO2 framework is thinner than that of the mTiO2, implying that volume shrinkage occurred during the carbonization step. For comparison, neat TiO2 inverse opal structures without mesopores were also prepared by calcining the P123 free samples (Fig. S1c, ESI†).

The samples were either calcined under air atmosphere (upper route) or subjected to sequential UV exposure in vacuum followed by calcination in Ar atmosphere (lower route) to obtain mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals, respectively. The resulting inverse opals contain well defined, periodic mesopore arrays as a result of the phase separation between the constituent blocks of P123 and removal of polymer templates.

The crystalline phase of neat TiO2, mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals was investigated by XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 2a, where all peaks match the typical diffraction pattern of an anatase TiO2 (JCPDS, No. 21-1272). To confirm the presence and the physicochemical nature of carbon moieties derived from calcination of P123 in the composite TiO2 structures, Raman spectroscopy and EDX measurements were performed. In the Raman spectrum of mC-TiO2 (Fig. 2b), the position of the G band at about 1600 cm−1 is in line with the presence of nanocrystalline carbons attributed to a high content of sp2-hybridized carbon, and the D band at about 1350 cm−1 corresponds to the defects of disordered carbon, which indicates that the P123 template was converted into a partially graphitic carbon.31 Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the Raman spectra of the neat TiO2 and mTiO2 inverse opals. The EDX results also confirm the presence of carbon moieties (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†).

TGA measurements were carried out to further confirm the carbon content in the composite (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). The mC-TiO2 inverse opal shows a 12 wt% weight loss in the range of 30–400 °C. It suggests that the content of carbon is roughly 12 wt%. In contrast, the weight losses of neat TiO2 and mTiO2 inverse opals were less than 2 wt%, due to the presence of ash in the samples.
The optical properties and the band gap energy of neat TiO2, mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals were investigated by UV-vis DRS measurements as shown in Fig. 3. The distinct difference in absorption characteristics of neat TiO2, mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 evidences that carbon was doped into TiO2 nanostructures (Fig. 3a). The band gap energy was estimated from the intercept of tangents with the x-axis in the Tauc plot (Fig. 3b).32mC-TiO2 shows a relatively lower band gap energy (∼2.9 eV) compared with mTiO2 (∼3.1 eV) or neat TiO2 (∼3.2 eV) owing to the additional electronic state above the valence band of TiO2, which contributes to the visible light absorption of TiO2.24,25

Information about the interaction between carbon and the TiO2 lattice can be obtained from chemical shifts in photoelectrons from the C 1s core level, as shown in Fig. 4a. Adventitious carbons (hydrocarbons) are ubiquitously present in XPS (located at 284.8 eV);30 however, the extent of oxidized carbon and its chemical shift varies amongst samples. The mC-TiO2 shows more C–O–C species (located at 286.2 eV)33 in comparison to either the neat TiO2 or mTiO2 materials, suggesting that carbon is well incorporated into the oxide lattice of the mC-TiO2. XPS can also measure shifts in the valence band relative to the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 4b. Although defining an absolute band edge from XPS is challenging due to cross-sectional differences amongst atoms, the valence band of mC-TiO2 definitively does not shift toward the Fermi level, but in fact shifts away. This suggests that the addition of carbon acts as an n-type dopant, and makes mC-TiO2 degenerate in character, in good agreement with the black color of the powder.

All spectra are calibrated to the adventitious carbon (CHx) peak at 284.8 eV. Spectra in (a) share the same scale and are offset for visibility. Inset in (b) shows a magnified view of the valence band near the Fermi level. 
To further characterize the valence and conduction band edge of neat TiO2, mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals, Mott–Schottky plots were obtained (Fig. 5). The Fermi level of an n-type semiconductor is defined in accordance with the flat band potential (Vfb), and the position of the valence band and conduction band edge of a given semiconductor can be obtained using the photoelectrochemical method.34 The Vfb calculated from the x intercept of the linear region is found to be −0.638, −0.685, and −1.082 V versus Ag/AgCl for neat TiO2, mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals, respectively. Compared with the neat TiO2 and mTiO2 inverse opals, the Vfb of the mC-TiO2 inverse opal is shifted to a more negative value by 0.4 V. The results indicate that the Fermi level of the composite was shifted closer to the conduction band of the semiconductor, which is consistent with the optical and XPS measurements.35,36

N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were performed to evaluate the specific surface area and pore size distributions of the three types of samples.37 The specific surface area (SBET), pore volume and pore size of the samples are listed in Table 1. The SBET values for neat TiO2, mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals were determined to be ∼56.6, 114.4 and 75.1 m2 g−1, respectively, as calculated using the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (inset in Fig. 6). All the adsorption curves display H2 type hysteresis loops and type IV isotherms with a sharp capillary condensation step in the range of 0.5–0.7 relative pressure (P/Po) of the adsorbate gas. The H2 type hysteresis loop is a characteristic of typical mesoporous materials with narrow pores.38 The mTiO2 inverse opal shows the largest specific surface area compared with the neat TiO2 or mC-TiO2 inverse opals. The previous SEM images and elemental analysis results evidence this observation, i.e., the P123 was completely removed during the calcination step for the mTiO2 inverse opal, leading pores behind, while a significant amount of carbon moieties remained for the mC-TiO2, exhibiting a lower specific surface area. The pore diameter of neat TiO2, mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals are determined to be ∼6.2, 6.5 and 4.7 nm, respectively (Fig. 6), indicating that the etching of the P123 templates led to a narrow distribution of pores and carbonization induced the decrease in pore size due to overall shrinkage of the system.

The photocatalytic activity of neat TiO2, mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals under UV light (λ = 254 nm) illumination was evaluated first in terms of the degradation of PNP. The decrease in the absorbance of characteristic peak of PNP at 400 nm was monitored for each of the samples as displayed in Fig. 7a–c. The peak at 320 nm is also attributed to the PNP. The adsorption of PNP onto TiO2 for 1 h in dark served as the control, which is denoted as ‘Dark’ in Fig. 7d. The results show that the maximum value decreases after exposure of UV light for 1 h as a result of the PNP degradation. It was found that mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals exhibit higher photocatalytic activities compared with neat TiO2 inverse opal as apparently evidenced by the rapid decrease in peak intensity. For quantitative comparison, the efficiency of the PNP degradation as a function of time was displayed by normalizing the absorbance values of the analytical samples with respect to the initial values (Fig. 7d). In the presence of mTiO2 or mC-TiO2 inverse opal, the degradation of PNP was significantly enhanced and more than 71% or 79% of PNP was completely decomposed after 1 h. Highly ordered mesostructures in mTiO2 inverse opal can enhance the effective light-activated surface area and allow rapid diffusion of reactants and products, which improves the photoabsorption efficiency and the transport of matter. Thus it shows enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to the neat TiO2 inverse opal. Even though a smaller surface area is observed in the mC-TiO2 inverse opal, it shows improved photocatalytic activity by effective separation of photoelectrons and holes due to the presence of the carbon species.39

The initial height of the absorbance maximum at around 400 nm in the absorbance spectrum of PNP prior to irradiation with UV light was used as reference. Decrease of the peak height was assumed to correspond to the relative decrease in PNP concentration. (d) Decolorization efficiency vs. time curves. 
Next, we explore the photocatalytic activity of the samples under visible light illumination. The neat TiO2 inverse opal did not show any noticeable visible light activity (data not shown). Fig. 8a and b depicts a series of spectra measured on the mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals, where the maximum intensity of the characteristic peak of PNP at λ ∼ 400 nm decreased upon increasing the irradiation time. The plots of the logarithm of C/C0versus irradiation time are displayed in Fig. 8c. It is observed that the mTiO2 inverse opal shows negligible photocatalytic ability during 3.5 h of illumination due to the inherently wide band gap. In contrast, the mC-TiO2 inverse opal exhibits a remarkably higher visible light photocatalytic activity than the mTiO2 inverse opal. It was found that about 66% of PNP was photodegraded within 3.5 h, implying that incorporation of carbon moieties is responsible for the visible light driven photocatalytic performance. Excitation by low energy photons for the mC-TiO2 inverse opals is ascribed to the reduced band gap as confirmed by the optical investigation and the carbon networks on the surface may act as a channel to divert excitons from the conduction band of TiO2, thereby decreasing the rate of recombination. It is assumed that the degradation of PNP is not complete, considering that the peak at 320 nm is still present after 3.5 h. All of the photocatalytic activity results with error bars are shown in the ESI† Fig. S5.

Water splitting via the PEC reaction has gained tremendous attention with regards to solar fuel generation and the facile fabrication of cost-effective, viable, and highly efficient visible light active photocatalysts is the key to resolve this critical issue. In order to demonstrate the potential use of the samples as photoanodes, PEC measurements were carried out on mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals in a three-electrode system (Fig. 9). The inverse opal films on ITO substrate and Pt wire were used as the working electrode and counter electrode, respectively. Ag/AgCl or a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was selected as the reference electrode. The photocurrent density versus applied voltage curves was monitored in the dark and under visible light irradiation. The dark scan from −0.5 to 2.0 V versus Ag/AgCl showed almost negligible current for mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals, whereas under the irradiation of visible light, mC-TiO2 inverse opal yielded a maximum photocurrent density of 0.29 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V. The efficiency (η) for PEC measurements can be calculated using the following relation: η = I(1.23 − Vapp)/Plight(1)where, I is the measured current density, Vapp is the applied voltage and Plight is the power density of the irradiation. Overall, the maximum efficiency of mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals were 0.009% and 0.087% respectively, indicating that an enhancement of 9.67 times was obtained for the mC-TiO2 compared with the mTiO2 inverse opal.

As a second model reaction, linear-sweep voltammograms of the mC-TiO2 inverse opal/ITO film in Na2SO4 electrolyte with or without ethanol were obtained as shown in Fig. 10. In normal photocatalytic water splitting systems, the oxidation half-reaction proceeds slowly and is required to be speeded up for efficient hydrogen production through the use of sacrificial reagents such as ethanol, which can facilitate hole consumption and slow down electron–hole recombination so that a dramatically enhanced hydrogen evolution by several orders of magnitude is achieved.40 In addition, solvent polarity can affect the dissociative adsorption of the ethanol over a pair of Ti and O, which can be considered as the controlling step in the photoreaction on the surface as follows: Et–O–H(a) + Ti(s)–O(s) → Et–O–Ti(s) + H–O(s)(2)where (a) and (s) indicate the adsorbed species and surface, respectively.41 When the ethanol was added into the electrolyte, the photocurrent was significantly increased under visible or UV-visible light irradiation. When ethanol is included, the photocurrent density generated on the mC-TiO2 inverse opal at 1.00 V versus SCE is more than 2 times greater than that of the initial value, only under visible light illumination (Fig. 10). Furthermore, when the mC-TiO2 inverse opal was illuminated using UV-visible light, the photocurrent density is increased by ∼3.12 times compared with the system without ethanol additives. According to the reactions (3) and (4), the ethanol molecule acts as a “hole” trap itself, where the adsorbed molecule becomes a radical ethoxide and is then converted into the carbonyl compound. More electrons were generated when ethanol existed in the electrolyte and these electrons could be rapidly transferred to the cathode together with the photogenerated electrons through the circuit driven by the external bias potential for hydrogen production.42 h+ + CH3CH2OH → CH3COOH + H+ + e−(3) 2OH˙ + CH3CH2OH → CH3CHO + 2H2O + 2e−(4)

On the basis of the UV-vis DRS and XPS study, the relative energy band diagram is schematically depicted as shown in Fig. 11. The direct band gap of mC-TiO2 inverse opal (∼2.9 eV) was estimated from the Tauc plot in Fig. 3b. From the valence band XPS measurements (Fig. 4b), the gap between the valence band (VB) and the Fermi level of mC-TiO2 inverse opal was evaluated to be ∼2.8 eV. The peak at 286.2 eV in the C 1s spectrum (Fig. 4a) can be ascribed to the formation of oxygenated carbon species (Ti–O–C bond), which creates a new intermediate level above the VB of TiO2 through the hybridization of O 2p and C 2p orbitals. The formation of oxygenated carbon species could cause an obvious long-tailed absorption in the visible region.43 For comparison the energy band diagrams of neat TiO2 and mTiO2 inverse opals were also constructed (see Fig. S6 and S7 in the ESI†). The potential for the photocatalytic oxidation of PNP was reported to be around 1.3–1.6 V vs. NHE.44 It is noted that the ethanol oxidation potential ranges in 1.0–0.8 eV vs. NHE.45

The factors contributing to the above enhanced photocatalytic activity include (i) extension of excitation wavelength through the formation of chemical bonding between the TiO2 and carbon, which is analogous to the doping effect, and (ii) the improved dispersion of mC-TiO2 inverse opal that allows for a larger amount of exposed active sites for reactions.
4 Conclusions
We suggested a simple protocol for the fabrication of mesoporous carbon–TiO2 inverse opal nanostructures using PS beads and a self-assembled triblock copolymer (Pluronic P123) as templates. The carbon doping was achieved by direct conversion of polymer scaffolds via sequential UV-stabilization of P123 in a vacuum and calcination at elevated temperature. Valid photocatalytic activities for the mesoporous carbon–TiO2 inverse opal nanostructures were demonstrated in terms of the degradation of PNP and photoelectrochemical measurements under UV or visible light irradiation. Highly ordered mesoporous inverse opal structures provide a maximized specific surface area, and the interconnected inverse opals can optimize the transportation of matter and reduce transport limitations. The carbon moieties incorporated into the TiO2 lattice exist as an oxygenated carbon species, which is responsible for multifunctional advantages such as the improved electron transport, increased visible light absorption, and effective decrease in the band gap energy. The best catalytic activity was obtained on the mC-TiO2 inverse opal in terms of the degradation of PNP within 3.5 h under visible light irradiation and the maximum photocurrent density of 0.29 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V, corresponding to 0.087% photoelectrode efficiency. On the whole, the new class of hybrid carbon based hierarchical mesoporous inverse opal structures developed in this study can find great potential in photophysical applications such as photocatalytic degradation of hazardous materials, water splitting for solar fuel production, and photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical cells.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the fabrication of mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals. 3D PS bead arrays were prepared first using colloid self-assembly and a common solution consisting of P123 and TiO2 precursors were infiltrated through the interstitial sites of the PS template. The samples were either calcined under air atmosphere (upper route) or subjected to sequential UV exposure in vacuum followed by calcination in Ar atmosphere (lower route) to obtain mTiO2 and mC-TiO2 inverse opals, respectively. The resulting inverse opals contain well defined, periodic mesopore arrays as a result of the phase separation between the constituent blocks of P123 and removal of polymer templates.
