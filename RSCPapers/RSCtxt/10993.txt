    , Accepted 5th October 2017First published on 6th October 2017AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as an attractive strategy to efficiently convert light energy into electricity. In this study, the third component 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (C6H4BrNO2) was introduced into the active layer of PTB7-Th:PC71BM to promote exciton separation and speed up electron transfer. A PCE of 8.95% was achieved for polymer solar cells (PSCs) with 15 wt% C6H4BrNO2, which is an 18% enhancement in PCE compared with binary OSCs based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements indicated that the ideal morphology can be formed. The charge generation properties were studied in terms of internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and photocurrent density (Jph), revealing that charge transport was facilitated significantly, which favors higher JSC and FF.
Introduction
Recently, the third generations of new concept solar cells have been recognized as one of the most promising next-generation green technology alternatives to inorganic photovoltaic cells and have drawn much attention due to their unique advantages, such as the simple preparation process, mechanical flexibility, light weight, and low cost.1–5 There are many factors that affect the performance of organic solar cells, in which efficient exciton dissociation is very essential to enhance current density.6,7 In 2015, Bonaccorso et al. reported ternary organic solar cells by introducing functional graphene nanosheets (GNF-EDNB) into the active layer of PCDTBT:PC70BM, and the power conversion efficiency increased by 18% compared with the binary.8 In 2016, An et al. doped square acid (SQ) into the active layer of PCDTBT:PC71BM to prepare the device in order to increase the utilization of the excitons generated by PCDTBT and to enhance photon harvesting over a long wavelength range. The phase separation can be finely optimized by adjusting the doping proportion of SQ to result in efficient charge carrier transport channels and effectively improve JSC. PCDTBT can deliver energy to SQ by fluorescence energy transfer, which can facilitate dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers at the SQ/PC71BM interface, and the PCE reaches 7.62%.9 In the same year, Xu et al. incorporated Bis-PC70BM as a second electron acceptor into PTB7:PC70BM-based polymer solar cells. Bis-PC70BM acts as a bridge between PTB7 and PC70BM, thus creating more charge transfer channels at the D/A acceptor interface, and resulting in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 7.00%.10 Charge-transfer complexes have been playing an increasingly important role in the D/A heterogeneous interface of organic solar cells, which is conducive to the improvement of optical current and the open circuit voltage and other photovoltaic parameters.11 A broad bandgap polymer, poly-3-oxothieno[3,4-d]isothiazole-1,1-dioxide/benzodithiophene (PID2), was used as the third component for PTB7:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM ternary solar cells by Yu et al. It was found that PTB7 interacted with PID2 in a charge-transfer manner to afford a PCE of 8.22%.12 However, since PTB7-Th and PID2 have both charge transfer and energy transfer, and an efficient ternary OSC with a PCE of 9.2% was obtained by incorporation of 20% PID2 into a PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films.13 It can be seen that the third component inside the device can be equivalent to a transfer ladder, providing more channels for carrier transport,14–18 which will also be an effective way to increase the short-circuit current density. Moulé A. J. et al. introduced nitrobenzene into the active layer P3HT:PCBM. It was found that when 4% nitrobenzene was added the surface morphology of the active layer was improved and better phase separation evolved, and the device efficiency was increased to 4%,19 but the related internal mechanism was not explored.20–22 In 2015, by adding appropriate proportions of nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) to a blended solution of PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM, Yang et al. realized fluorescence inhibition rates of more than 60% and substantially improved the power conversion efficiency from the best reported value of 7.48 to 8.88%.23 Experiments and simulations show that nitrobenzene and PBDTTT-C-T form stable coplanar charge-transfer complexes through hydrogen bonds for increasing electron transfer.
1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (C6H4BrNO2) is a solid derivative of nitrobenzene and an important organic intermediate. As a non-solvent, 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene is added to the acceptor due to the evaporation of the solution during spin coating, resulting in a decrease in the mass of the donor, which in turn increases the agglomeration and orderliness of the donor in a certain region.24 In this study, the third component (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) was introduced into the active layer based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM to improve the overall performance of organic solar cells. The chemical structures of materials used herein and the schematic diagram of cells are shown in Fig. 1. Doping with different proportions of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene plays a role in suppressing fluorescence in the active layer, thereby promoting electron transfer and reducing the probability of recombination of charge at the D/A interface, to some extent increasing the electron mobility so that more free charge can be collected by the electrodes. The short-circuit current density (JSC) increased from 15.97 mA cm−2 to 17.94 mA cm−2. At the same time, the doping amount of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene effectively improved the surface morphology of the film, and the energy conversion efficiency (PCE) reached 8.95%.

Experimental
Material preparation
ITO glass was purchased from CSG Holding Co., Ltd, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) model called Clevious PVP Al4083 and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. Ag Purity as 99.99%, spin coater model for KW-4A. 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (C6H4BrNO2, TCI, purity >99%) is chosen as the fluorescence inhibitor. Subsequently, PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1:1.5 weight ratio) was mixed in a 25 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution, and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene was added to the solution to obtain weight percentages of 0 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, 25 wt%. To completely dissolve the respective materials, the solutions were stirred for 2 hours in a water bath environment at 70 °C, and then at room temperature (30 °C) for 10 hours.
Device fabrication
Cells were prepared on glass/ITO with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1, which was used as the substrate and the anode electrode in the experiment. First, the glass was washed with detergent, and then subjected to ultrasonic treatment (for 15 min) with deionized water, isopropanol, acetone and anhydrous alcohol, respectively, and high purity nitrogen gas was used to clean the surface of the glass. Next, by UV ozone treatment for 15 min, a 35 nm thick poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer was prepared through spin coating at 3200 rpm. Then the PEDOT:PSS substrates were immediately baked in air at 130 °C for 15 min, after transfer into a nitrogen glove box (H2O < 1 ppm, O2 < 1 ppm) for further processing. The active layer (ca. 100 nm) was spin-coated under 1200 rpm for 40 s (3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as the additive in the spin coated active layer, TCI, purity >95.0%, oscillating water bath for 40 min) after the preparation of the active layer is placed in the glove box cover plate, waiting for 30 min. Finally, 10 nm BCP and 100 nm Ag were deposited at 0.25 nm s−1 and 1 nm s−1 in a vacuum onto the photoactive layer at a pressure of 6 × 10−4 Pa, and the active area of the device is 0.1256 cm2.
Device measurements
The absorption spectra of the materials were acquired using UV-Vis spectroscopy (Hitachi, U-3900/3900H). The photocurrent density–voltage (JV) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. Device JV characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using a Newport Oriel solar simulator (Model SAN-EI, ELS 155 (XE)). The EQE of the device was measured using a quantum efficiency tester (Model QE-ICPE 3000). The thicknesses of the active layers were measured using a Stylus Profiler (Dektak 150). The variation of the morphology is acquired using a dual-probe atomic force microscope (DP-AFM). Photoluminescence spectra of the samples were measured with a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer using a 450 W Xe lamp as the excitation source.
Results and discussion

J–V characteristics
From Table 1, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM control device showed a short circuit current density (JSC) of 15.97 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.790 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.601, yielding a PCE of 7.58% on the basis of adding 3 vol% DIO. With the increase of the addition proportion of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, the short-circuit current density of organic polymer solar cells increases, and when 15 wt% of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene is added, the performance parameters of the PSCs are found to be optimal; the VOC, JSC, FF and PCE are 0.778 V, 17.94 mA cm−2, 64.1% and 8.95%, respectively. When the addition proportion of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene is increased, the short-circuit current density tends to decrease, and the reason is that, in the course of the experiment, with the increase of the addition proportion of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, the active layer solution is relatively viscous and the surface of the active layer film has fine granular solutes. It can be seen that the excess solute of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene in the active layer solution cannot dissolve completely; this may cause film defects, affect the separation of excitons at the D/A interface and reduce the carrier mobility, greatly increasing the electron and hole recombination, resulting in reduced performance of the device. After the addition of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene to the active layers, the VOC values do not exhibit obvious differences. This lack of obvious differences is because the VOC value of PSCs is directly proportional to the offset between the HOMO level of the electron donor and the LUMO level of the electron acceptor.25,26 In addition, when 15% 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene is added, the series resistance and the parallel resistance of the device are decreased and increased, respectively, and then the FF improves. The JV characteristic curve of the device is shown in Fig. 2, and the relevant performance parameters are given in Table 1. The above values are derived from the average of 15 groups of the same device.

Photovoltaic properties
As shown in Fig. 3, the steady-state fluorescence spectra (600–900 nm) of the active layer with different weight percentages of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (0%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%) at an excitation wavelength of 471 nm; the results show that the characteristic peaks of PTB7-Th at 770 nm decrease with the increase of the 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene doping amount, and no obvious luminescence enhancement phenomenon is found in other luminescence ranges, indicating that the doping of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene serves to promote charge transfer. When 15% 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene is doped, the fluorescence intensity is the lowest, which is beneficial to the separation of the excitons at the D/A interface so that a higher amount of free charge can be collected by the electrodes to improve JSC.

The determination of the IQE allows us to study the light absorption within the photoactive layer.27–29 A low IQE indicates that the active layer of the solar cell is unable to make good use of the photons. The IQE is given by IQE(λ) = EQE(λ)/AbsAL(λ)(1)where AL stands for the active layer, and AbsAL is the absorption in the active layer.30 In the PTB7-Th active layer solution, the absorption trends of the absorption spectra were almost the same when the different proportions of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene were added, and the absorption intensity decreased at 550–750 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The trend of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve is consistent with the JV curve, and it can be seen that the values are 75.1% and 71.3% at 515 nm and 705 nm when 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene is doped 15%, compared with the device without adding 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene as shown in Fig. 4(b). The EQE is enhanced and the absorption is reduced. According to eqn (1), the IQE is improved; it is likely that more charge carriers can reach their respective electrodes and be extracted before the charge recombination takes place, increasing carrier mobility, which favors higher JSC and FF values.

To gain insight into the effect of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene incorporation on the photocurrent and exciton dissociation process of the solar cells, we determined the Jph value by using the equation Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. For Veff = Vo − Va, V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage.31,32Fig. 5 shows photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves for solar cells. In addition, under the maximal power output conditions, Jph/Jsat are 80.7% and 78.1% for solar cells with 15 wt% and without 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene additive, which suggests that the light generated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and very efficient processes of charge carrier collection have been obtained, thus improving the FF of PCE.

The charge transport ability is crucial to improving the performance of organic solar cells; in order to further study the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the device PTB7-Th:PC71BM, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement is a widely used tool to indicate the carrier mobility of organic materials.33 To understand the charge transport ability of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer doped with different weight percentages of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, we measured the electron and hole mobilities using the space-charge-limited current method with Al/Active layer/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/MoO3/Ag device structures. We measured the dark J0.5–V characteristics of the devices and the mobility can be extracted from the Mott–Gurney equation:34 (2)The hole and electron mobility curves are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (d). Table 2 shows the ratios of electron mobility to hole mobility in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer doped with different amounts of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. From the data in this table, the μh and μe slightly increased and then decreased with the increase of the 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene amount. It means that charge carrier transport channels can be optimized and more effective interpenetrating networks can be formed by adjusting the 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene amount in active layers (vide infra). In particular, for doping with 15% 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, the electron and hole mobilities are 1.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The relatively low ratio of electron to hole mobility (μe/μh = 1.01) suggests a fairly balanced charge transport in PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film doped with different ratios of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.35 The symmetric built-in electric field distribution36,37 is generated in the active layer. More balanced hole and electron mobilities are beneficial for obtaining a relatively high JSC and FF.

Film morphology
We investigated the morphological properties of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films doped with different weight percentages of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Related studies show that the optimally rough surface may effectively reduce the charge-transport distance and increase the JSC, and induces a nanoscaled texture that further enhances internal light scattering and light absorption.38 As seen in Fig. 7(a), (c), (e), (g) and (i), the AFM height images of the different films (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene contents of 0%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%) show that, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the film increases with the increase of proportion of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene from 0.970 nm to 0.884 nm, 1.08 nm, 1.12 nm and 1.16 nm. Fig. 7(b), (d), (f), (h) and (g) show the phase diagrams corresponding to the respective blend films doped with different proportions of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (AFM height and phase images (1 μm × 1 μm) of the films with addition of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene are shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). From the height and phase diagrams, the 15 wt% 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene active layer exhibits a rougher surface compared with the untreated film, indicating the formation of polymer self-organization, which in turn enhances ordered structure formation in the thin film. And the surface morphology of the order of the fibrous nanostructures is conducive to the formation of a good network between the donor and the acceptor into the track. Along with better balanced charge transport and reduced exciton recombination, a very high FF of 64.11% and a PCE of 8.95% are achieved. Excessive 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene cannot be completely dissolved in chlorobenzene and local clusters and ordered network structures are destroyed, which indicate that excitons cannot be timely migrated to the D/A interface, resulting in a lower short-circuit current density, and affecting the overall performance of the device.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully developed a system by introducing a fluorescence inhibitor (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) into a PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend to improve the photovoltaic properties of BHJ solar cells. The results indicate that 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene is beneficial for charge transport and transfer, in which the photogenerated excitons can be dissociated into free charge carriers at the interface of the PTB7-Th/PC71BM active layer, and can be effectively collected by the external circuit. The charge generation properties were studied in terms of IQE and Jph. By optimizing the amount of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (15 wt%), an enhanced PCE of 8.95% is achieved with a JSC of 17.94 mA cm−2 and an FF of 64.11% for PSCs. This shows that there is a lot of potential for the overall performance of organic solar cells.
