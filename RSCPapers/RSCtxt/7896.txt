    , Accepted 13th August 2019First published on 14th August 2019AbstractThe one-dimensional (1D) acceptor–donor (A–D) hetero-nanotube (HNT) has attracted much attention as a potential candidate for a channel structure of next-generation field effect transistors (FETs). Herein, we designed A–D C3N/C3B double-wall (dw) HNTs by coaxially wrapping C3N and C3B nanotubes together. By using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we studied the electronic properties and ballistic transport behavior of C3N/C3B dwHNTs in comparison with the ones in vertical stacking contact. The remarkable charge transfer between C3N and C3B nanotubes and band hybridization in C3N/C3B dwHNTs originate from the strong intertubular π–π stacking interaction. In the simulated all-around-gated FET devices, (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT with 2 repeated wrapping units possesses the optimal performance, including rectifying ratio and subthreshold swing (SS), by enhancing the A–D asymmetry. Our work suggests that coaxial wrapping is a method superior to vertical stacking in constructing A–D HNTs for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices based on 1D materials.
1. Introduction
In the next decade, the semiconductor industry urgently needs to scale down the size of field effect transistors (FETs) to smaller than 7 nm.1,2 The relentless scaling down of planar FETs is running out of steam due to process induced variability and degraded mobility.3 The continued desire for higher performance at lower leakage has led to the emergence of new gate-all-around (GAA) device structures.4 The tubular inner and outer gates render effective charge control inside the channel, thus providing the GAA silicon nanotube FETs with excellent immunity to short channel effects, making it possible to extend Moore's law down to sub 7 nm.5 In comparison with other low-dimensional semiconductors, one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes (NTs) have shown great potential in GAA FETs, owing to their tubular topology. More importantly, the 1D NTs exhibit unique small-size-related properties, such as size-dependent emission,6 quantized conductance,7 and a metal–insulator transition,8 which facilitate the construction of 1D GAA NT-based devices with higher integration, lower cost, faster operation, and less power consumption.
To extend GAA-NT-FETs to many other applications, it is essential to endow the channel with high acceptor–donor (A–D) asymmetry. The A–D hetero-nanotube (HNT) is the basic element of various devices, including memories,9 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),10 solar cells,11 and so on. It has been theoretically predicted that C3N monolayer is an electron-abundant semiconductor (n-type), while C3B monolayer is hole abundant (p-type), both of which have been successfully synthesized in recent experiments.12–14 C3N and C3B nanotubes, still unprecedented sets of 1D NTs, could be hypothetically produced from the exfoliation of C3N and C3B monolayers via a rolling-up mechanism.15 In 2012, CxN nanotubes were successfully synthesized via the 1D fibrous self-assembly of protonated melamine.16 The way to synthesize C3B nanotubes is now under exploration, owing to their poorer stability than that of C3N nanotubes. The electron-abundant and hole-abundant properties of C3N and C3B nanotubes make them feasible to build A–D C3N/C3B double-wall (dw) HNTs, via intertubular van der Waals forces.17 The A–D dwHNT has drawn more attention from researchers for its adjustable electronic and optical properties. The numerous species of NTs ensure the flexibility of regulating the performance of electronic and optoelectronic devices based on A–D dwHNTs, which is superior to the traditional homo-tube structure. This is because the device performance of the latter is severely restricted by the intrinsic properties of the NTs,18,19 dopants,20,21 and the selectivity of the dopant on the NT surface.22,23 Meanwhile, it is possible for A–D dwHNTs to preserve the excellent properties of the isolated materials.17,24–26 The dye-sensitized solar cell based on A–D SnO2/TiO2 dwHNTs has been realized experimentally, showing a high energy conversion efficiency of 8.4% at 100 mW cm−2.27 To further improve the device performance, the relationship between the intertubular interaction and the electronic properties of A–D C3N/C3B dwHNTs needs to be clarified. First-principle calculations have observed a band gap opening in C/BN dwHNTs, owing to the intertubular interaction and the change of symmetry.24 To promote the applications of A–D C3N/C3B dwHNTs in high-performance GAA-FETs, a detailed understanding of their ballistic transport behavior is desirable.
In this work, by combining density functional theory (DFT) and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we investigated the static electronic properties and ballistic transport behavior of C3N/C3B dwHNT in comparison with the ones with vertical-stacking contact (C3N/C3B vsHNT). It is found that the π–π stacking interaction on the homogeneous interface of C3N/C3B dwHNT is strong enough to enhance the charge transfer and band hybridization, whereas that in C3N/C3B vsHNT is negligible. In the simulated GAA-FET devices, (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT with 2 wrapping units exhibits the best performance, including rectifying ratio and subthreshold swing (SS), owing to the enhanced A–D asymmetry between (12,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B. The ballistic transport behavior study reveals that A–D C3N/C3B dwHNT is a potential candidate for a channel structure of high-performance GAA-FETs.
2. Computational methods

Ab initio DFT was used to calculate the electronic and optical properties of all isolated C3N and C3B nanotubes and constructed C3N/C3B HNTs. The geometry optimization of single-wall C3N and C3B nanotubes with various sizes was carried out by employing SG15 optimized non-conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV) pseudopentials in the Atomistix-tool-kit Virtual-nano-lab computational tool (ATK-VNL).28–30 These pseudopotentials can ensure the accuracy of the bandgap with a high efficiency. A vacuum slab of 25 Å in the radial direction was applied to eliminate the artificial interaction between neighboring nanotubes. 500 Hartree was tested for the cutoff energy. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 1 × 1 × 8 Monkhorst–Pack k-points grid for geometry optimization.31 All B, C, and N atoms in nanotubes were fully relaxed within the tolerance of 1.0 × 10−4 and 5.0 × 10−4 eV Å−1 for force and stress error, respectively. Subsequently, vertical-stacking and coaxial-wrapping contact types of C3N/C3B HNTs were built and further optimized, during which a DFT-D2 semiempirical dispersion-correction method was adopted to take van der Waals (vdW) dispersion into account.32 A much denser k-point mesh (1 × 1 × 15) was employed for band structure and density of states (DOS) calculations. The DFT-1/2 method was adopted to correct the DFT self-interaction error, by defining an atomic self-energy potential that cancels the electron–hole self-interaction energy.
Ballistic transport behavior was calculated with a combination of DFT and the NEGF formalism, which was implemented in ATK-VNL. Planar-gated and all-around-gated two-probe models were used to simulate the electronic transport behavior of stacking-contact and wrapping-contact C3N/C3B HNTs, respectively. At the end of a C3N nanotube and the beginning of a C3B nanotube in the overlapping region, the dangling bonds were passivated by hydrogen atoms. The gate voltage was applied in the radial direction of a nanotube where a Dirichlet boundary condition was applied. The long scattering region guaranteed a low charge oscillation at the contacts between electrodes and the central region.33 The geometry in the central region was fully optimized by minimizing the atomic forces to be smaller than 0.05 eV Å−1. To achieve a reasonable balance between the calculation efficiency and accuracy, the valence electron orbitals of the device were described using the single-ζ polarized (SZP) basis set. A sample of 3 × 1 × 100 k-points chosen for the Monkhorst–Pack method was used to describe the Brillouin zone, and the mesh cut-off was chosen as 150 Ry. The entire treatment of transport in this work was ballistic and elastic, i.e., there is no scattering of phonons. The effects of temperature or defects will not be taken into account in the transport behavior. The source–drain current (IDS) was calculated according to the Landauer–Büttiker formula:34 (1)where TVG(E,VDS) is the transmission probability at a given gate voltage (VG) and source–drain (VDS). fS/D is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function for the source/drain electrode, and μS/D is the electrochemical potential for the source/drain electrode, respectively. The difference in the electrochemical potentials is given by eV with the applied VDS, i.e., μS(VDS) = μS(0) − eV/2 and μD(VDS) = μD(0) + eV/2.
3. Results and discussion
The single-wall nanotubes possessing opposite electronic properties can be applied to construct A–D HNTs. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the atomic structures of single-wall zigzag C3N and C3B with different sizes, which have been proven to be thermally stable.35,36 The diameters of (6,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B are approximately 4.83 and 4.94 Å, respectively, almost half compared to those of (12,0) C3N and (12,0) C3B. The size difference between (6,0) and (12,0) nanotubes is large enough to ensure that weak vdW forces play the major part in the intertubular interaction between the outer and inner layers of C3N/C3B dwHNTs, which will be constructed by different kinds of single-wall nanotubes.37 The band structures along the Z–Γ direction suggest metallic characteristics of C3N and C3B nanotubes along the axial direction, regardless of their size. In the C3N nanotube, the electronic properties near the Fermi level originate from the conduction band (CB), owing to the electron-rich property of substituted N atoms. On the contrary, the substitution of electron-deficient B atoms has led to the majority contribution of the valence band (VB) in the electronic properties of the C3B nanotube. The opposite electronic properties indicate that C3N and C3B nanotubes have great potential to act as an acceptor and donor in hetero-nanotube field effect transistors. In the right panel of Fig. S2 (ESI†), the densities of states (DOSs) reveal that sp2 hybridized C atoms provide the perfect conditions for electron transport, which results in a high conductivity of C3N and C3B nanotubes. It is possible to unite the advantages of these two materials by preparing a C3N/C3B composite without degrading the stability of either material.38 Therefore, C3N and C3B nanotubes can be used to construct A–D HNTs.

Fig. 1 presents the optimized structures of C3N/C3B HNTs constructed by vertical stacking and coaxial wrapping, in virtue of the intertubular vdW forces. In the former type, (6,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B are vertically stacked and labeled as (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT. In the latter type, (6,0) C3N was wrapped with (12,0) C3B, forming (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT, and (6,0) C3B was wrapped with (12,0) C3N, forming (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT. By comparing the geometry before and after full relaxation, a significant lattice mismatch between C3N and C3B nanotubes along the axial direction in C3N/C3B dwHNT could be observed. There exists Bernal wrapping between the outer and inner nanotubes, similar to the stable AB stacking in double-layer graphene,39,40 when the tolerance of force and stress error reaches 1.0 × 10−4 and 5.0 × 10−4 eV Å−1, respectively. The residual strain is so small that it can ensure a favorable energetic stability. The vertical distance between (6,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B is 2.04 Å in (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT. Such a distance is less than those in the wrapping-contact type, in which the intertubular distances are 2.57 and 2.75 Å for (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT and (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT, respectively. The large distances in the above C3N/C3B HNTs ensure the impact of weak vdW forces on the intertubular interface, which is characterized by π–π stacking interaction, owing to the conjugation structures of C3N and C3B nanotubes.41 Their corresponding adsorption energy (ΔE) values were calculated according to the following definition: ΔE = (EC3N/C3B − EC3N − EC3B)/mC3N/C3B, in which EC3N/C3B, EC3N, and EC3B represent the total energies of C3N/C3B HNT, and isolated C3N and C3B nanotubes without contact, respectively, whereas mC3N/C3B indicates the total number of B, C, and N atoms in the unit cell of C3N/C3B HNT. As shown in Table 1, the adsorption energies are −0.15 and −0.10 eV per atom for stacking and wrapping contacts, respectively. It was found that C3N/C3B HNTs with both stacking and wrapping contacts are stable. Both C3N and C3B nanotubes are ring-shaped along the radial direction. This kind of rigidity can endow the interface between outer and inner nanotubes with the same distance at any position in the wrapping contact type. Such an intertubular distance is larger than that in the stacking contact type. Thus, the adsorption energy in C3N/C3B dwHNT is weaker than that in C3N/C3B vsHNT.

In order to examine how contact type affects the intertubular interaction, we visualized the charge transfer between C3N and C3B nanotubes in C3N/C3B HNT supercells. Fig. 2 shows the changes of electron densities in (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT, (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT, and (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT, respectively, where the loss/gain of electrons is indicated in a cyan/magenta iso-surface. Since the cyan iso-surfaces are localized on B atoms in the C3B nanotube, whereas the magenta ones are localized on N atoms in the C3N nanotube, the C3B nanotube acts as a donor to inject electrons into the C3N nanotube, meanwhile the C3N nanotube acts as an acceptor. The intertubular π–π stacking interaction might contribute to A–D asymmetry between C3N and C3B nanotubes in C3N/C3B HNTs. The size of the cyan/magenta iso-surface indicates the amount of electron depletion/accumulation on B/N atoms in C3N/C3B HNTs. To quantitatively illustrate the effect of intertubular interaction on the charge transfer during C3N/C3B HNT formation, we calculated the electron density difference (Δρ). Δρ is defined as Δρ = (ρC3N − ρC3B)/mC3N/C3B, where ρC3N and ρC3B represent the total electron accumulation/depletion on C3N and C3B nanotube segments in the unit cell of C3N/C3B HNT, and mC3N/C3B denotes the total atom number in the unit cell of C3N/C3B HNT. As shown in Table 1, Mulliken analysis demonstrates that −0.092 e per atom charge is transferred from (6,0) C3B to (12,0) C3N in (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT, exhibiting the largest amount of charge transfer. However, there is only −0.028 e per atom charge transfer from (12,0) C3B to (6,0) C3N in (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT. As for the stacking-contact type, the amount of charge transfer in (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT is −0.006 e per atom, much less than those in C3N/C3B dwHNT, partly due to the small stacking area. It is possible that the wrapping contact possesses a stronger π–π stacking interaction than the stacking contact, owing to its homogeneous intertubular interface.

It is important to consider the relative positions of C3N and C3B nanotubes in C3N/C3B HNTs. We calculated the segment-resolved band structures of C3N/C3B HNTs, as shown in Fig. 3, in which the red and blue curves represent the contributions from C3N and C3B nanotubes, respectively. The band structure along the Z–Γ direction is focused on, as the current flow along the axial direction will be discussed later. As compared to the isolated C3N and C3B nanotubes, more bands cross the Fermi level during the formation of C3N/C3B HNTs. In the stacking contact type, the energy bands near the Fermi level are equivalently contributed by the valence maximum band (VBM) of (6,0) C3N and the conduction minimum band (CBM) of (6,0) C3B. Their shapes are partly preserved during vertical stacking, indicating that the intertubular interaction is too weak to bring about band hybridization in (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT. As for the wrapping contact type, band component analysis validates that the bands near the Fermi level are remarkably contributed by the outer layer. In detail, the band shape of isolated (12,0) C3B is preserved in (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT. By reversing the relative positions of C3N and C3B nanotubes, the band shape of the outer (12,0) C3N is preserved in (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that the shift of bands across the Fermi level in C3N/C3B dwHNTs is much more remarkable than that in the stacking-contact type. Such band hybridization is attributed to the stronger π–π stacking interaction between C3N and C3B nanotubes. Therefore, the intertubular π–π stacking interaction can be applied to modulate the electronic properties of C3N/C3B HNTs by changing the contact type.

To further characterize the effect of intertubular interaction, we calculated the optical properties of (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT, (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT, and (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4. The imaginary part of the dielectric functions (ε2) is an effective parameter to measure the optical absorption capability of a material, as the peaks in ε2 are caused by the absorption of incident photons and the interband transition of electrons. For the stacking contact type, an appreciable sharp absorption peak appears in the region of 0 eV to ∼0.5 eV, suggesting that the light within this energy range can be strongly absorbed by the formation of (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT. In contrast, the height of this absorption peak has decayed significantly in C3N/C3B dwHNT, especially in (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT. The second absorption peak in a higher region of ∼0.6 eV to ∼1.0 eV appears to be much stronger in (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT. This phenomenon demonstrates that the stacking-contact type has a stronger light absorption capability in the red region, whereas the wrapping-contact type adsorbs more strongly in the blue region. By reversing the relative positions of C3N and C3B nanotubes from (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT to (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT, the absorption peak gets further blue-shifted gradually. It is clear that a stronger intertubular π–π stacking interaction favors absorption capability in the higher energy region. Correspondingly, it is possible to tune the optical properties of C3N/C3B HNTs by changing the contact type and relative positions of C3N and C3B nanotubes.

To explore the ballistic performance of FETs based on C3N/C3B HNTs with different contact types, a bottom-gated FET structure was modeled for the stacking-contact type, while an all-around-gated FET structure was constructed for the wrapping-contact type, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. A vertical electrical field can be applied to the channel material along the radial direction in the simulated FET devices. It has been verified that the intrinsic device performance is insensitive to the doping concentration in source and drain extensions; thus, we used pristine C3N and C3B nanotubes as the source and drain electrodes.42 In the central region, the single-wall C3N nanotube overlaps with the single-wall C3B nanotube in the wrapping and stacking contacts. In the overlapping region, both C3N and C3B nanotubes have two repeated units along the axial direction. A bottom metallic gate electrode with a thickness of 3.0 Å is attached to a HfO2 (k = 30) dielectric layer with a thickness of 3.0 Å below the intrinsic channel in the planar FET, whereas an outer metallic gate electrode with the same thickness is wrapped onto the inner dielectric layer around the intrinsic channel in the GAA FET. Both kinds of geometries can enable high gate-controlled electrostatics for FETs. The output characteristics of the C3N/C3B HNT FETs are presented in Fig. 5c, in which the gate voltage (VG) is fixed at 0 V. IDS increases nearly linearly in the entire range of VDS from −1.0 V to 1.0 V in (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT FET and (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT FET, revealing the ideal Ohmic contact between C3N and C3B nanotubes. However, IDS of (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET reaches a saturation state when the positive VDS rises to 0.7 V, which is desirable for radio frequency applications.43 Overall, in the wrapping-contact type, the backward IDS under a negative VDS is higher than the forward IDS under a positive VDS, and this is especially remarkable in (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET. Such rectification behavior is opposite to that in the stacking contact type, in which the forward IDS is higher than the backward IDS.

(c) Output characteristics at VG = 0 V and (d) transfer characteristics at VDS = 0.7 V for C3N/C3B HNT FETs. The rectifying ratio curves of various C3N/C3B HNT FETs are plotted in the inset of (c). The enlarged transfer curve of (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT FET is shown in the inset of (d). 
To fully evaluate the effect of A–D asymmetry on the rectification behavior, we defined a rectifying ratio as . In this definition, the value of R corresponds to the relative magnitude between the backward and forward IDS. R > 1 indicates a higher backward IDS from drain to source, whereas 0 < R < 1 denotes a higher forward IDS from source to drain. It was found that the favorite current direction is from (6,0) C3B to (6,0) C3N in (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT FET, corresponding to the opposite direction of electron transfer from donor to acceptor. As for (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3N dwHNT FET, the R value increases from 0.83 to 1.21, demonstrating a reversed rectification direction under a higher VDS. When the relative positions of C3N and C3B nanotubes have been reversed in (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET, the maximum value of R further increases by nearly double from 1.21 to 2.04, as the stronger π–π stacking interaction between (12,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B nanotubes intensifies the A–D asymmetry. This is in accordance with the largest charge transfer between (12,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B in the wrapping contact type. It is supposed that such A–D asymmetry is sensitive to the rise of bias voltage. As a result, the rectification transport behavior in GAA C3N/C3B HNT FETs can be effectively reversed under a higher bias.
The A–D asymmetry can also be applied to modulate the performance of a FET device. Fig. 5d presents the transfer characteristics of C3N/C3B HNT FETs with various contact types at a fixed VDS = 0.7 V. Quantitatively, IDS of (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHNT FET increases linearly with the rise of VG, showing n-type conductance. When VG rises to 1.0 V, IDS has increased by only 1.5% with respect to that under VG = −1.0 V, revealing a low on/off ratio. It is believed that the negligible intertubular π–π stacking interaction cannot effectively bring about remarkable A–D asymmetry between (6,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B, thus suppressing the on/off ratio. In the case of (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT FET, the electronic transport behavior is also dominated by electrons. However, IDS of this FET at VG = 1.0 V increased by nearly 50% in comparison with that at VG = −1.0 V, largely due to the enhanced A–D asymmetry between (6,0) C3N and (12,0) C3B. As the electron mobility (μ) of the above C3N/C3B HNT FETs is linearly dependent on the slope of their unipolar transfer characteristic curves, (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT FET possesses a higher electron mobility than (6,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B vsHTS FET. Therefore, coaxial wrapping is superior to vertical stacking in constructing A–D HNTs for high-performance FETs, in terms of the improved on/off ratio and carrier mobility. Furthermore, by reversing the relative positions of C3B and C3N nanotubes in the wrapping contact type, it is possible to change the unipolar behavior of (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT FET into the ambipolar characteristic of (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET. The subthreshold swing (SS), reflecting gate controllability, is another important key figure of merit for FET devices, by which the transition rate between on-state and off-state in FETs can be measured. Although there is a deviation between the simulated key figures of merit and the actual values due to the angstrom-scaled devices, the predicted variation trend is reliable. The SS value is 29.65 × 104 mV dec−1 for the stacking contact type. However, the SS value is remarkably reduced to 12.73 × 104 mV dec−1 in (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHNT, which is half compared to the stacking contact type. By further reversing the relative positions of C3N and C3B nanotubes, the SS value goes on decreasing to 12.25 × 103 mV dec−1. Thus, (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET possesses the best device performance, because of the strongest A–D asymmetry.
To further check the effect of different overlapping areas on the device performance of (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FETs, we increased the number of wrapping units in the central region from 0 to 4 with an interval of 2. The corresponding devices are labeled as E0, E2, and E4, as represented in Fig. 6a–c. Accordingly, the length of the overlapping region will increase from 0 to ∼17.0 Å, along with which the overlapping area is also enlarged. The output characteristic curves shown in Fig. 6d demonstrate that IDS can rapidly become saturated with the rise of VDS, irrespective of the wrapping area. It is clear that the Schottky contact between (12,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B is independent of the wrapping unit number. IDS values of E2 and E4 are almost equivalent to each other and much larger than that of E0. These larger IDS values of E2 and E4 are due to the larger overlapping area between (12,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B, on which the stronger π–π stacking interaction promotes the electronic transport efficiency from (12,0) C3N as an acceptor to (6,0) C3B as a donor. The highest conductivity was achieved when the number of wrapping units increased to 2. The existence of saturation voltage at positive bias contributes to the rectification behavior in (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET (Fig. 6e). The higher conductance at negative bias in E2 ensures its larger R value as compared to that of E0, in the entire VDS range from −1.0 V to 1.0 V. Nevertheless, when the overlapping region goes on enlarging to E4, the A–D structure asymmetry has been reduced.

The C3N and C3B nanotubes in the source and drain leads are repeated semi-infinitely. (d–f) Output characteristics, rectifying ratio curves, and transfer characteristics of (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET as a function of the wrapping unit number. The enlarged rectifying ratio and transfer characteristic curves of E0 are shown in the insets of (d) and (f), respectively. 
As a result, the R value of E4 is lower than that of E2 at a bias higher than 0.7 V. Thus, 2 repeated wrapping units are the favorite factor to enhance the rectification behavior in (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET. As shown in Fig. 6f, it is clear from the transfer characteristics that the conductance of such FET devices can be transformed from n-type in E0 to p-type in E4. Similar phenomena can also be observed in (6,0) C3N/(12,0) C3B dwHTS FET, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is expected that the type of majority carriers in (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET can be regulated by changing the wrapping area, making it possible to further modulate the device performance.
To explore the relationship between the intertubular π–π stacking interaction and the transport behavior, we projected the local density of states (LDOS) onto (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FETs with various numbers of wrapping units in Fig. 7. In the LDOS, the pink block stands for the existence of DOS, whereas the black one displays the energy gap without a DOS distribution. The green frame denotes the overlapping region between (12,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B nanotubes, which widens as a function of the wrapping unit number. At VDS = VG = 0 V, the metallic characteristic of (12,0) C3N results in the continuous distribution of DOS at the Fermi level on the source lead, irrespective of the wrapping unit number. The zero overlapping region between (12,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B in E0 leads to a gap with no DOS distribution. It is clear that there is no intertubular π–π stacking interaction between (12,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B in E0, thus severely impeding electron transport through the device. The increase of wrapping units results in the continuous and widened delocalization of DOS over the whole overlapping region. It is believed that the intertubular π–π stacking interaction is strengthened, thus providing more channels for electrons to transport efficiently between (12,0) C3N and (6,0) C3B. The results shed light on the great significance of intertubular π–π stacking in promoting the ballistic transport efficiency in C3N/C3B dwHNT FETs.

To further check how the intertubular interaction affects the transmission channel at the atomic scale, we analyzed the local transmission function with increasing wrapping units (Fig. 8). The local transmission function can provide a striking picture of how carriers transport through the atomic bonds. In this method, the transmission can be decomposed into local (atomic) contributions as follows:44,45 (2)where TAB is the transmission between the atoms A and B. TAB can be calculated on the basis of the Fock and overlap matrices that are the same as those used for the transmission calculation.
 Fig. 8  Local transmissions through (a) E0, (b) E2, and (c) E4 (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FETs at the Fermi level under VDS = 0.7 V and VG = 0 V. The transmission on (12,0) C3N is framed in red, whereas that on (6,0) C3B is framed in blue. The transmission from (12,0) C3N to (6,0) C3B is marked by the yellow dots. 
Local transmission plots in Fig. 8 illustrate how the local transmission pathways are changed with increasing wrapping area. The local transmission plots are normalized by the maximum value in each plot being the same size, irrespective of the magnitude of the total transmission at the Fermi level. The transmission probability of each channel is illustrated by the arrow diameter. To clearly illustrate the figure, we have set a threshold of 0.3, below which the arrows are not shown. The blue arrows indicate the components of the transmission that are in the direction of current flow from source to drain, thereby contributing to the net current, whereas the red arrows give components in the opposite direction, thereby reducing the net current. The purple arrows marked by yellow dots give components in the radial direction, thereby providing channels for electrons to transport from (12,0) C3N to (6,0) C3B. The local transmission within the red frame demonstrates that electrons can transport efficiently on the source (12,0) C3N through the π-conjugated C–C and C–N bonds, irrespective of the wrapping area. In contrast, few arrows are delocalized on (6,0) C3B on the drain lead of E0, as the intertubular π–π stacking is too weak to provide efficient transmission pathways. By increasing the wrapping area, more blue arrows are distributed continuously on the π-conjugated C–C and C–B bonds of (6,0) C3B in E2 and E4, owing to the enhanced intertubular π–π stacking interaction. It is clear that more efficient transport pathways are formed, resulting in the higher conductance in E2 and E4. Accordingly, the transport probability in (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET can be rationally tuned by changing the wrapping area, which is also dependent on the intertubular π–π stacking interaction, as well as the contact type.
4. Conclusions
In summary, by combing DFT with the NEGF method, we have theoretically built up 1D A–D C3N/C3B HNTs by vertically stacking and coaxially wrapping C3N and C3B nanotubes together, in which C3N and C3B nanotubes act as acceptor and donor, respectively. The coaxial interface between inner and outer layers in C3N/C3B dwHNT contributes to the strong intertubular π–π stacking interaction and thus dramatically enhances the charge transfer between C3N and C3B nanotubes and band hybridization in the wrapping contact type. In contrast, the intertubular π–π stacking is negligible on the vertical-stacking interface, owing to the reduced intertubular interface. Because of the A–D asymmetry, the simulated GAA (12,0) C3N/(6,0) C3B dwHNT FET can achieve the highest rectifying ratio and the lowest SS value, showing the best performance. Ballistic transport behavior study reveals that the intertubular π–π stacking interaction can be applied to modulate the transport efficiency between C3N and C3B nanotubes, as it can provide more efficient channels for electron transport. Our work demonstrates the great potential of A–D C3N/C3B dwHNTs in constructing GAA-FETs with high performance.
