    , Accepted 3rd February 2017First published on 6th February 2017AbstractCobalt ditelluride as a cocatalyst on the surface of a silicon microwire array (Si-MWs) and as a heterocathode structure for the hydrogen evolution reaction was synthesized via a one-step drop-casting method. The improvement in the photo-electrocatalytic efficiency, including the 0.66 V anodic shift in the onset potential and the −24.0 mA cm−2 photocurrent density, is comparable to that of other cocatalyst systems for water reduction. The photocurrent decay of CoTe2@Si-MWs further improved to roughly −10 mA cm−2 by deposition of 10 nm atomic-layer-deposited TiO2 on the Si-MW photocathode for 67 min. Outcomes of this study may demonstrate the possibility of introducing a new class of telluride cocatalyst heterocathode system as an alternative to noble metals in facilitating the water splitting reaction. The cobalt ditelluride across the TiO2-passivated Si-MWs heterocathode is reported to have an effective response to solar water reduction for the first time.
Introduction
Fossil fuels will be at the brink of depletion in the coming decades, and alternative technologies should be developed to meet the worldwide energy demand and to lower pollutant compounds (e.g., mainly CO2) released to the environment.1,2 Solar energy, which is environmentally-friendly, is a potential alternative resource that can supply the required energy to generate fuels.3 Nitrogen in the air and ocean water are two major available sources for the future prospect of energy, which researchers can investigate to combine with solar energy to generate fuel or manufacture compounds. Thus, the results from the use of the photo-electrochemical (PEC) junction, which was first introduced by Fuishima–Honda in 1972, were used to identify the most efficient reaction using solar light to oxidize water into oxygen and reduce it to hydrogen.4 Existing materials to reduce water are not optimal for this conversion as a fuel.3 Among the potential candidates for solar water splitting (i.e. metal oxides and related systems,5,6 III and V semiconductor structures,7,8 and oxynitrides9–11), silicon as a single structured semiconductor possesses beneficial characteristics. Silicon, with a band gap energy of 1.1 eV and a theoretical maximum photocurrent density of 44 mA cm−2, is a promising potential material for PEC applications.1 Silicon is a suitable semiconductor that does not cause problems common among metal-oxide catalysts, such as poor solar absorption and poor electronic properties (i.e. diffusion length, mobility, recombination rate). However, silicon and group III and V transition metal compounds exhibit material instability and slow interfacial kinetics toward the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). One of the new approaches to address this problem is to develop appropriate electrocatalysts on the surfaces of photoactive materials to reduce the interfacial kinetic barriers of photogenerated charge carriers as well as to stabilize the photo-electrode to prolong the gas evolution reaction. Through morphological modification, which has been shown to enhance photoresponse, silicon microwire arrays (Si-MWs) were verified to have scalable potential as a platform in PV and PEC water splitting devices because of their optical absorption (high aspect-ratio structure) and electrical transport (shorter diffusion length for photogenerated carriers).2,3 Most semiconductors suffer from two major problems, namely, facile electron/hole recombination and slow kinetics to efficiently consume photocharges. Thus, most semiconductors, including silicon, cannot reduce water despite the presence of sacrificial electron donors.4 Embedding a sustainable and cost-effective cocatalyst to decrease energy barriers with the lowest possible cost could increase the kinetics of photocarriers in solar HER, which leads to tuning of sluggish gas evolution, unlike that of noble metals (Pt, Pd). Thus, several strategies were presented and new cocatalyst system/s were developed to enhance the photoresponse conditions in HER, including double metal/semi-metallic catalysts by taking advantage of the synergistic effect.5 For instance, it was reported recently that the combination of CoTe2 with carbon nanotubes shows higher efficiency toward OER. Transient metal chalcogenides are abundant and inexpensive energy materials that were analyzed and synthesized via diverse routes through chalcogen precursors.6 A chemical transformation through an ion-exchange reaction to adjust the composition of MxTey (M = Cd, Zn, Pb, Pt) was reported to be an important method to synthesize this class of materials.7,8 The cation-exchange reaction as a route in the chemical transformation of metal tellurides by exchanging Cd2+ into the Cu+ sites was demonstrated by Manna–Moreels et al.9 Cobalt ditelluride is one of the semiconductors that has been receiving increasing research interest because of its distinctive electrical properties.10 A few studies on transition metal tellurides toward photocatalysis have been conducted.11 The lower electronegativity of telluride in metal-telluride compounds would lead to lower surface adsorption and could facilitate the release of evolved products on the surface of the electrode and increase their stability in the electrolyte. However, attaching a cocatalyst on the silicon surface is difficult because of the absence of a stable oxide layer and surface hybrid.12 Conversely, utilizing binders or other compounds could lead to electrical insulation, which results in conductivity loss and decreased photoactivity of semiconductors. Nevertheless, under severe PEC conditions, namely, high photocurrent density and gas evolution, the immobility of the cocatalyst coated on the silicon surface tends to decrease from the substrate. In this study, we explored the development of CoTe2 as a cocatalyst that systematically optimizes PEC water reduction through the drop-casting method. Synthesized CoTe2 on silicon microwires and its role in increasing the efficiency, stability, and lifespan of hydrogen evolution were also investigated. Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) vapor was used to treat the substrate's surface to bind the cocatalyst to the substrate and preserve the formed structures of the as-prepared catalyst. To increase the durability and photocurrent stability of the systematically optimized sample during PEC measurements, a 10 nm amorphous TiO2 layer was coated on the Si-MWs using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report on the role of the CoTe2 cocatalyst in solar water reduction across the silicon microwire array with a high ratio-surface area applied in HER.
Experimental section
Materials and methods

Si-MW fabrication. 
Boron-doped (100) p-type silicon micro wafers (Si-MWs, 1 × 1 cm2, R = 1–25 Ω cm, diameter ∼1 μm, length ∼10 μm) on an aluminum substrate (2 × 2 cm2) were fabricated using ion etching of oxide patterned, using the dry etching technique. An aqueous buffer solution (10% v/v) was initially used to etch SiO2 according to standard cleaning procedure. Silicon oxide was deposited on the surface (500 nm) through a wet oxidization process within a horizontal furnace. A silicon rod array (1 × 1 cm2) with a pitch size of 850 nm was developed by exposing the spin-coated surface with positive photoresist using a Tracker instrument. The hard mask was then prepared by etching the SiO2 layer under an Ar, O2, CF4, and CHF3 mixed atmosphere by TEL5000 and the photoresist was removed by using Mattson's solution and H2SO4. Subsequently, an ICP etcher under a mixed atmosphere (Ar, O2, and SF6) was applied to prepare Si-MWs (∼10 μm), then the prepared Si-MWs were polished (Yuanfa Electronics Corporation) up to ∼350 μm thickness for diffusion length reduction of photogenerated carriers. In the final step, the hard mask was removed by buffer oxide etching. Aluminum deposition by an electron gun on the back side of the Si-MW product was conducted at a conductive surface (0.5 μm) using the vapor deposition technique for current collection generated on the surface and further annealed at 400 °C for 30 min (Fig. S1†).


HMDS treatment of Si-MWs. 
The silicon wafer was immersed in HF for 30 s (10% v/v) to remove SiO2 on the silicon surface. The wafer was then cleaned with deionized (DI) water, followed by rapid drying with a gentle stream of pure nitrogen, which maintained the microwire surface for further treatment. Subsequently, 100 μl of HMDS (Sigma-Aldrich, purity ≥ 99%, initial b.p. = 125 °C) was heated near its boiling point (∼100 °C) in a 20 ml container with dehydrated silicone covering the container head for 5 minutes. The sample was then kept at room temperature before drop-casting for 20 min.


Synthesis of CoTe2@Si-MWs. 
The drop-casting technique was used to synthesize and deposit the CoTe2 cocatalyst onto the Si-MWs. The drop-casting solution contained varying concentrations of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and Na2TeO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 100 mesh) in pure methanol. The solution was stirred for 3 h and sonicated at a controlled temperature before drop-casting. Each portion of the drop-casting volume included 10 μl of the above-mentioned solution, which was covered with a Petri dish for slow evaporation of methanol and homogeneous dispersion. The optimum volume for drop-casting on the surface of the Si-MWs using the above solution was 30 μL cm−2 in relation to the microwire roughness factor. The coated samples were then transferred to the H2/N2 (20%–1000 sccm) furnace, kept at 400 °C for 2 h, and then cooled down to 30 °C (5 °C min−1).


TiO2 atomic layer deposition@Si-MWs. 
Titanium dioxide layers were deposited using an Ultratech ALD instrument with tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium (TDMAT, Sigma-Aldrich 99.99%) as the TiO2 precursor and pure DI water as the oxidizing agent. The substrate temperature was approximately 200 °C for all depositions. The TDMAT pulse time was 0.25 s, whereas the H2O pulse time was 0.1 s. The purge pressure was kept at ∼130 mTorr at equilibrium. The deposited layers had stable growth rates of ∼0.4 Å per cycle and 250 cycles were performed for a final nominal 10 nm TiO2 layer thickness, which remained amorphous during the process.


Photoelectrode fabrication. 
The coated silicon wafers were attached to copper wires with the same length (15 cm) for all samples using silver paste to attach the wire to the back-side of the aluminum coated wafers and dried at 55 °C for 2 h. Chemical-resistant Teflon tape (PTFE Skived, SO-FS) was used to cover the electrical contact and the silicon wafer edges except the coated photoactive portion after checking the conductivity of the electrode back-side. In measuring the evolved gas, the silicon wafers were coated with epoxy resin (NANPAO Bond 900-SKG) and dried at room temperature for 3 h. All photoelectrodes were placed perpendicular to the light path in all measurements.


Performance assays. 
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements of the sample electrodes were conducted at 25 °C vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a silver chloride electrode saturated with potassium chloride (Ag/AgCl/sat. KCl, E0 + Elj = 0.198 V at 25 °C) in a three-electrode configuration and platinum foil (20 × 50 cm2) as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The Pt surface was assured clean by polishing with concentrated sulfuric acid to remove possible contamination prior to PEC tests. The working electrodes were used as drop-cast samples on the Si-MWs for PEC characterization. The photoresponse data were recorded with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Negligible dark currents were recorded for samples with a lower magnitude in all analyses in the applied potential range of ∼10−6–10−7. All the PEC curves were obtained in 0.5 M, H2-saturated sulfuric acid (pH = 0.3) electrolyte in a controlled temperature water jacket at 25 °C. A 500 W xenon lamp source equipped with AM 1.5G filter was used as the simulated sun illumination source. The power density in the sample projected area was controlled by a calibrated silicon photodiode at 100 mW cm−2 in all measurements. The potentials vs. RHE scale was reported by calibration. The presented current density was normalized to the geometric surface area of the samples using ImageJ 1.49 V software. Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted by scanning from +0.55 V to −0.45 V versus the RHE potential window with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 from the positive to the negative potential for the photocathode samples. Chronoamperometry and gas evolution tests were conducted at a 0 V applied potential vs. RHE (0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl).


Reference electrode calibration. 
All the applied voltages reported as the RHE were calculated using the thermodynamic potential for the hydrogen electrode reactions in the experiment:13ERHE(V) = EAg/AgCl(V) + 0.223


Faradaic efficiency determination. 
The experiment was conducted in a sealed volumetric quartz cell, where the working electrode was placed in the middle (Vmeasured). The degassed electrolyte containing 0.5 M H2SO4 was kept at 25 °C with a controlled water jacket. The controlled potential electrolysis was conducted at an applied potential of −0.21 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 67 min. The Faradaic efficiency was measured according to the following equations:    


Instrumentation. 
Scanning electron microscopy was performed on a field emission JEOL JSM-6700F, with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV applied to study the product morphologies. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL, Japan) and FE-HRTEM (JEM-2100F, JEOL) were applied for nano area analysis and elemental mapping. The X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD) with a lab-made holder for silicon wafers was performed on a Bruker D2 PHASER (Cu-Kα radiation λ = 0.154178 nm) with a 2θ range from 10° to 65°. A Thermo DXR Raman microscope with a 532 nm laser was used to investigate the stretching modes of the coated Si-MWs. The XPS spectra were collected using a PHI 5400 equipped with a 4 kV argon ion gun, with Al K radiation. The angle between the source and the detector was 35°. The measurement chamber was maintained at 10−9 eV during measurement. The measurements were taken at a pass energy of 17.9 eV. All peaks were deconvoluted using 80% Gaussian–20% Lorentzian peak fitting. All energies were calibrated to spurious carbon at 285.0 eV. The total reflectance spectra were collected using a Thermo Evolution 220 spectrometer. All X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were performed at the 01 C beamline (6–33 keV, E/ΔE = 7000) of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC, Hsinchu City, Taiwan). The beamline operates XANES and serves high flux light from a bending magnet with a continuous spectrum over a very broad energy range. The Co K-edge XAS measurements were performed at room temperature.
The schematic of the CoTe2 synthesis across Si-MWs is shown in Scheme 1 through a HMDS vapor treatment.

Although several procedures which use HMDS for preserving wire-structured morphologies were reported,23 the direct use of HMDS in a drop-casting solution would lead to the formation of impurities in the final product that reduces photoresponse during the PEC reaction. Silicon microwire arrays were fabricated as a photocathode for solar HER through a dry-etching process (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows that the wires were almost entirely enclosed by CoTe2 across and on the surface. The morphology of the as-prepared sample is hemispherical and agglomerated mainly because of the magnetic properties of CoTe2 (Fig. S5a†).24 The varying volumes of the alcoholic Na2TeO3/Co(NO3)2 solution was used in drop-casting the silicon surface and 30 μL is the optimum amount that achieved the highest photocurrent through the dependence on the Si-MW surface roughness factor (Fig. S2, S16†). HMDS exhibited a negligible effect on the PEC performance of electrodes and did not show any side effect. Correspondingly, HMDS enhanced the stability of particles on the Si-MWs as well as preserved the microwire morphology (Fig. S5b and included information†). More cocatalyst particles were present when HMDS was applied before drop-casting the solution on the wires in the TEM and SEM images (Fig. S6–S8†). In the low-volume coating of silicon wafers, the samples without HMDS exhibited lower stability and photocurrent density than the treated ones. The overshoot photocurrent of the sample without surface treatment by HMDS vapor was also observed from the normalized j–t curve (Fig. S15†). The X-ray diffraction of the CoTe2@Si-MWs array was measured in the range of 2θ = 10–65°, confirming the presence of CoTe2 on the silicon substrate surface (Fig. 2).

The relatively weak diffraction peak of CoTe2 on the silicon surface could be attributed to the low content with respect to the entire silicon microwire array. The relatively weak diffraction peak of CoTe2 on the silicon surface could be attributed to the low content with respect to the entire silicon microwire array. As shown in Fig. 2, the Si-MW substrate showed two sharp peaks at 28.5° and 62° (two-theta degree) corresponding to a single crystalline silicon microwire array.14,15 The zoomed in area of the sample surface coated with a 30 μL volume cocatalyst solution demonstrated CoTe2 with a marcasite–FeS2 crystal structure and Pmnn symmetry. In Fig. 2, the peaks located at 2θ = 21.9°, 26.9°, 28.4°, 31.8°, 40.5°, 55.8° are related to the (011), (101), (110), (111), (112), and (023) Miller indices, respectively, matched by the reference pattern (JCPDS No. 74-0245). The formation mechanism of CoTe2 undergoes a cation-exchange reaction. Through cation-exchange, Co2+ diffuses in the Na2TeO3 crystals and exchanges with 2 Na+ ions in an alcoholic solution to form Co3(OH)2(TeO3)2, which subsequently produces CoTe2 metal-dichalcogenide under H2 as the reducing agent at 400 °C (Scheme 2).

Fig. 3 shows the XRD and Raman spectra of the dried sample after stirring with the drop-casting solution for 12 h at room temperature. The most evident spectral change occurred at a high frequency of 650–750 cm−1 in the same polarization range, which originated from the symmetric stretching modes, and changed to a lower energy spectral range of 200–550 cm−1.
 Fig. 3  (a) XRD and (b) Raman spectra of Na2TeO3 compared to the transient sample. 
The peak centered at 707.5 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching mode of the TeO3 trigonal pyramid units.16 Two other peaks at ∼663 and ∼684 cm−1 were presumably related to the equatorial and out-of-plane non-equivalent oxygen atoms.17 According to the statistical occupation of sodium and oxygen from the solvent in the transient sample, the molecules acted as facultative ligands of the sodium coordination polyhedra.18 This structure, later on, formed a transition metal hydroxide, which has the favorable thermodynamic driving force to produce metal chalcogenides under H2 as the reducing agent at 400°.7,8,19,20Scheme 2 shows the schematic mechanism of the CoTe2 formation in the alcoholic solution. Fig. 4 shows CoTe2 particles at a silicon wire within the lattice-resolved high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images. Fig. 4 also indicates the presence of the cocatalyst on the wire with good stability and a clear lattice fringe spacing of 0.307 nm, which matches with the high crystallinity of the (011) plane of CoTe2, consistent with the XRD results (Fig. S11 and S12†).

(d) d-spacing distribution of the line profile extracted from (c) (Fig. S10†). 
EDS elemental mapping also confirmed the presence of cobalt and telluride on the silicon wire (Fig. S9†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the samples to examine CoTe2 on the Si-MW surface. Fig. 5 shows the XPS spectra of the Co 2p and Te 3d regions. Co 2p2/3 at 778.5 eV and the corresponding Co 2p1/2 peak at 793.5 were in agreement with other reported data.21 Te 3d5/2 positioned at 573 eV confirmed the presence of telluride in CoTe2.22 The oxide peaks at both regions were related to the native (amorphous) oxide layer at the surface because of the low CoTe2 stability in oxygen in ambient air.21,23 Moreover, analysis of the oxygen to silicon ratio in the Si-MW samples treated by HMDS vapor revealed a lower oxygen content presence on the surface (Fig. S13†). Further investigation on the CoTe2 electronic structure underneath the native (amorphous) oxide layer on the surface was carried out by employing soft X-ray absorbance near edge spectroscopy (XANES) for the Co K-edge (Fig. 6). Results from the XANES spectra confirmed that the electrical conductivity of CoTe2 underneath the oxide layer was maintained, which was responsible for the excellent catalytic activity of the Te−1 anion for HER.

(b) Numerical derivative of the XANES in comparison with the CoO signal as candidate compounds for the CoTe2 oxidation state. 
The electronic structure of CoTe2 underneath the oxide layer was obtained using the XAS measurement by taking advantage of its deeper penetration ability than that of XPS. As demonstrated in Fig. 6a, the standard samples with a known oxidation state for cobalt ion normalized K-edge, including cobalt foil (Co0), cobalt(II) oxide (Co2+), cobalt(III) oxide (Co3+), and cobalt tetraoxide (Co2+ and Co3+), were measured and experimentally compared with the thin film powder made from CoTe2. As demonstrated in this figure, the edge of the CoTe2 sample was higher than the cobalt sample with zero-charge (Co0), which implied the presence of ionic cobalt in the sample. The cobalt ion in the CoTe2 K-edge was located between Co2+ (CoO) and zero-charged cobalt (cobalt foil) with an inclination toward the former, which has two positive charges. This phenomenon suggested that the chemical state of cobalt in our CoTe2 sample was Co2+, which made the tellurium anion with Te1− and from the ionic perspective point of view Co2+/Te22−.24 The numerical derivative of the XAS data in Fig. 6b for CoTe2 and CoO revealed three distinct peaks centered at 7708, 7717, and 7721 eV with the same trend for both structures. This result confirmed the similarity in the chemical state of the cobalt ion in both structures, which were consistent with the XRD and XPS results. The CoTe2 intensity decrease, compared with that of CoO, was attributed to the lower electronegativity of Te than that of O in the composition.
Therefore, the electrical conductivity was maintained underneath the oxide layer and was responsible for the excellent catalytic activity of the cocatalyst (Fig. S18†). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), shown in Fig. 7a, indicated that 30 μL of the drop-casting volume has a lower onset potential (VOC = 0.17 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and higher photocurrent density (j = −24.0 mA cm−2) than other samples with varying drop-casting volumes. Fig. 7 presents the LSV measurements of different amounts of the CoTe2 cocatalyst on Si-MWs with respect to different drop-casting volumes. The onset potential of pristine Si-MWs in this work was −0.49 V vs. RHE with approximately −0.03 mA cm−2 photocurrent density (Fig. S17d†), which showed a better onset potential than other silicon microwires.25 As demonstrated in Fig. 7, the photocurrent density increased to −14.0 mA cm−2 with a positive shift to 0.13 V vs. RHE by adding a slight volume (10 μL) of the drop-casting solution of the CoTe2 cocatalyst. By tuning the drop-casting volume, the onset potential shifted from 0.13 V to 0.17 V vs. RHE for the samples with 10 μL to 30 μL volume of the drop-casting solution. The presence of the decorated CoTe2 cocatalyst across Si-MWs changed the onset potential by suppressing the overpotential and electron barrier height. By increasing the amount of the drop-casting solution onto the surface from 30 μL to 50 μL, the photocurrent of the electrodes decreased from −24.0 mA cm−2 to −13.0 mA cm−2, respectively.
 Fig. 7  (a) LSV measurement with iR compensation of different drop-casting volumes and (b) the corresponding onset potential and photocurrent density at 0 V potential vs. RHE with respect to the CoTe2 loading volume (all three cycles of LSV measurement reported in Fig. S16†). 
This phenomenon, which is initiated by the formation of a thicker film of aggregated particles on the surface, could reduce photocurrent by (i) impeding higher light absorption and making the surface less conductive or (ii) creating more surface defect sites to recombine photogenerated carriers on the photocathode surface. Since no overshoot photocurrent (spike-shape) was observed for a higher concentration of the CoTe2 cocatalyst across Si-MWs, the reduction of the photocurrent density and the photoresponse of the silicon array occurred because of the light impedance and the inner filter effect at a higher concentration of cocatalysts on the surface (see Fig. S2 and S14†). A higher volume of the drop-casting solution would increase the thickness of the cocatalyst layer on the electrode surface which lessens migration of photogenerated carriers and catalysis on the electrolyte interface. Fermi energy level position EF can provide information about the band structures of CoTe2. Calculations indicate that the band gap for beta electrons (down-spin) is indirect (SM → LD) and equal to 1.063 eV. Comparison between CoTe2 and CoSe2 in cobalt chalcogenides reveals that the 3d CF splitting between the t2g and eg states for beta electrons in CoTe2 is smaller because of the longer Co–Te interionic distances.16 Thus, it is suggested that CoTe2 has a greater work function than silicon, which can act as a cocatalyst, trap light-harvested electrons from Si-MWs, and provide active sites to recombine hydrogen atoms reduced on the surface to molecular hydrogen. Such conditions do not follow by amorphous TiO2 band structures across p-type silicon. Exceptional studies on TiO2 protected photoelectrodes in water splitting were reported by McIntyre et al.26 A few studies demonstrated that CoTe2 exhibits a metallic/half-metallic structure and behavior because of the large electron concentration.28 Further investigation on the CoTe2@Si-MWs conducted by j–t photocurrent measurement for roughly 3 h resulted in more than −6 mA cm−2 current density, which decayed over time (Fig. 8). Fig. 8a shows a sample without etching with j = −5.75 mA cm−2. This sample showed a non-reproducible trend by chopping light, which was probably caused by the separation of some cocatalysts with loose binding to the silicon surface reducing the photocurrent.
 Fig. 8  (a) Chronoamperometry measurement of the photocurrent transient with chopped light for CoTe2 on Si-MWs at 0 V vs. RHE for 3 h. (b–d) Photoresponse during varying PEC intervals (Fig. S3†). 
This trend continued for 10 min until an almost stable photocurrent at −4.3 mA cm−2 was reached, with distortion in the current caused by the evolving gas on the surface (Fig. 8b). By chopping light and stopping the gas evolution for 10 s (Fig. 8c), the photocurrent increased to −4.75 mA cm−2. This result was attributed to the bubble-effect removal caused by insulating bubbles on the electrode surface that reduced light diffusion and caused particle removal from the surface and decreased the efficient active surface area.27 Notably, the photocurrent did not reach the initial value because of the SiO2 formation on the Si-MWs during the reaction.14,28 After 1.1 h (4000 s) of continuous measurement, the photocurrent reached −3.5 mA cm−2. At this point, we etched the photocathode by immersing in HF (10%-v/v) at RT for 30 s, then continuing the measurement with the same conditions as before. As seen in Fig. 8d, the photocurrent reached −3.2 mA cm−2 (0.021 mA cm−2 min−1) after 2 h (7.2 thousand seconds). By etching the electrode, the photocurrent went back to −6.25 mA cm−2, which was even higher than the initial value. After 2 h of continuous run and gas evolution, the CoTe2@Si-MW catalyst system maintained 100% of the original catalytic activity. These results suggest that (i) CoTe2 particles decorated across surface-treated Si-MWs exhibit good stability during the PEC reaction and enhance the photocurrent density drastically at 0 V vs. RHE, as well as shift the onset potential to more positive values (Fig. 7b); (ii) the photocurrent reduced because of the SiO2 formation on the surface during the PEC reaction in the electrolyte, which returns to the initial amount after SiO2 removal from the surface by etching, and not by the decomposition or separation of the cocatalyst from the electrode surface; and (iii) CoTe2@Si-MWs play a passivation layer role that prolonged the catalytic activity of silicon wires and HER. The presence of the cocatalyst across the wires during and at the end of the reaction can be confirmed by comparing the photocurrent density of pristine silicon microwires at 0 V vs. RHE with CoTe2@Si-MWs (−0.03 and −6.25 mA cm−2, respectively, see Fig. S17d†). For the optimized coated sample, it is clear that not all the parts of the silicon wire surface was completely coated with CoTe2. As a result, the uncoated parts of the wire (could be also detached from the surface during HER), which was exposed to the electrolyte, was preferably oxidized to SiO2 over the reaction time which later leads to the photocurrent decay. Etching with HF will remove these non-conducting oxide layers and enhance the current density. As mentioned above, the coated wires are assumed to be passivated due to the presence of the cocatalyst on their surface (Fig. S18†). To protect Si-MWs from rapid oxidation and ensure the formation of non-conductive silicon oxide across the wires, 10 nm nominal amorphous TiO2 is coated by atomic layer deposition (ALD-10 nm) over the silicon microwire array, and the same procedures were conducted for CoTe2@Si-MWs fabrication (Fig. S7 and S8†). CoTe2 as a cocatalyst for protected Si-MWs reduce the overpotential for an efficient water splitting photoelectrode. In the first attempt, three cocatalyst volumes were drop-cast to the deposited silicon wafer. As expected, the CoTe2@Si-MWs samples exhibited a similar trend except that the optimized volume for drop-casting on TiO2 deposited Si-MWs changed to 20 μL to prevent light absorption-blocking on the surface (Fig. S14c†). p-type silicon microwires as a HER catalyst with deposited amorphous TiO2 as a passivation layer underlying the CoTe2 cocatalyst present as an efficient heterocathode system for solar water splitting. CoTe2 is responsible for removing charge barriers for electron migration to the semiconductor–liquid junction (SCLJ) and preventing photogenerated electron/hole recombination without generating noticeable photocurrent. A high hole concentration at the p+ region is present at the SCLJ which does not depend on illumination and bias, and this confirmed that no barrier was formed for hole extraction and the photovoltage depends on the insulator thickness.12 By passivating the surface, the surface recombination rate (kre) and electrode corrosion are suppressed and the interfacial charge-transfer rate for water reduction is improved. The coated microwire structure also provides active sites for evolution of hydrogen from reduced hydrogen atoms as an efficient heterocathode for HER. The onset potentials for 20, 30, and 40 μL coating volumes of the cocatalyst solution were about 0.10 V vs. RHE (Fig. 9). The corresponding photocurrent at 0 V vs. RHE was −17.0, −13.0, and −7.0 mA cm−2, respectively. Reducing the light absorption on the surface and/or generating more surface defect states could be the cause of the reduced photocurrent.29 The sample with a higher photocurrent density was subjected to photocurrent transient chronoamperometry at 0 V vs. RHE at 25 °C. The initial photocurrent for the CoTe2@TiO2-Si-MWs sample was the same as the corresponding current measured in LSV, which was −11.5 mA cm−2.
 Fig. 9  (a) Transient photocurrent at 0 V vs. RHE and (b) LSV measurement of samples with different drop-casting volumes onto the TiO2 coated silicon microwire array with iR compensation (all three cycles of LSV measurement are reported in Fig. S17†). 
During measurement, the photocurrent density decreased gradually because of the detachment of CoTe2 at the surface parallel with distortion because of the evolving gas and subsequent bubbles on the surface. By turning off the light illuminated photocathode surface, the evolution of gas stopped and a reproducible average photocurrent of −7.0 mA cm−2 was observed after illuminating the projected area in the photocathode. Several light on–off steps were carried out, as shown in Fig. 9a. As a result, the silicon surface was successfully passive to rapid oxidization, and a higher photocurrent was achieved at the time of measurement (see Fig. S4†). Optimized CoTe2@Si-MWs and passivated CoTe2@TiO2-Si-MWs both treated by HMDS vapor were subjected to gas evolution. The short-term stability (1 h) of CoTe2@Si-MWs and CoTe2@TiO2-Si-MWs and their Faradaic efficiencies for hydrogen reduction and the corresponding current were evaluated by chronoamperometry at 0 V vs. RHE (Fig. 10). The amount of evolved gas was recorded after 1000 seconds for the surface activation until the stable current was reached (see Fig. S19c†).

Fig. 10a shows that higher photocurrent densities of approximately −10 and −4.3 mA cm−2 were obtained at the time of measurement, and slight cathodic attenuations of 5% and 10% occurred within 67 min for CoTe2 with and without TiO2 coating, respectively. The accumulation and release of evolved hydrogen led to the formation of bubbles on the surface and the edge of the photocathode, which caused the variation in the photocurrent during measurement. The distortion in the current and increased fluctuations in the CoTe2@TiO2 Si-MWs sample are related to the higher rates of hydrogen evolution and release from the surface. This leads to gradual separation of CoTe2 from the wires and direct exposure of their surface to the electrolyte which lead to the formation of a nonconductive SiO2 layer and photocurrent decrement. The Faradaic efficiencies of the CoTe2 cocatalyst on TiO2 coated and uncoated Si-MWs were roughly and 80.3%, 68.3%, respectively (Fig. S19†). The corresponding amount of hydrogen evolved for both samples in Fig. 10b shows a linear trend of gas evolution. The surface of the ALD-10 nm CoTe2@Si-MWs detached microwires revealed that coated CoTe2 on the TiO2 surface was observable, which confirms the advantage of surface treatment by HMDS vapor unlike using untreated substrates.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed an optimum cocatalyst/semiconductor heterocathode system with decorated CoTe2 across a silicon microwire array with a high surface area metal dichalcogenide. CoTe2@Si-MWs work well and act as an electron sink with a metallic/half-metallic nature. CoTe2@Si-MWs also provided active sites on Si-MWs and formed a passivation layer to facilitate HER drastically. The onset potential of Si-MW was greatly improved and the stability of the catalyst structure was also enhanced and preserved for long-duration HER via ALD-TiO2-10 nm.
