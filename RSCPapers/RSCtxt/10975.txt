, Accepted 20th June 2018First published on 22nd June 2018AbstractCarbon dots (CDs) are an emerging fluorescent subclass of the carbon nanomaterial family that have been perceived as a versatile new platform in an extensive range of applications. Among this state-of-the-art work, photoluminescence (PL) correlative applications play a leading role by virtue of the benign biocompatibility, low cost and high chemical scalability of CDs. In this review article we first emphasize the functions of the surface passivation and/or functionalization process during synthesis, which is one of the fundamental methods used to control the fluorescent properties during the early stages of the synthesis of CDs by changing the surface emissive sites (surface states), especially in some inert raw CDs. More importantly, the doping approach is another critical factor that paves an avenue to efficiently tune the intrinsic PL properties of CDs. Second, we highlight a series of the latest relative PL tuning mechanisms that provide new insight in this review into modified synthesis strategies for CDs that focus on the essential factors (i.e., physical, chemical and electronic structures) needed to enhance the PL properties of CDs. This review and further research is expected to facilitate understanding of the relationship between synthetic methods and PL tuning.

1. Introduction
Carbon dots (CDs) are a group of emerging fluorescent (FL) carbon-based nanomaterials that are generally defined as discrete, zero-dimensional carbonaceous materials with sizes lower than 10 nm.1 CDs consist of nanocrystalline cores with sp2 conjugated carbon embedded within an amorphous carbon matrix (mainly sp3 hybridized) containing considerable defects, probably resulting from surface oxidation (Fig. 1a).2–5 Due to this specific structure, CDs show tunable physical, chemical, electronic and optical properties. CDs have displayed moderate photo- or electro-excited charge transfer performance; excellent biological properties, such as high water solubility, extensible functionalization, hypotoxicity, and remarkable biocompatibility;6,7 and good optical properties, as illustrated by a tunable photoluminescence (PL) and a broad emission range that covers the visible region.8,9 These attributes allow CDs to function as a novel fluorescent platform with a wider range of applications as compared to conventional toxic metal quantum dots (QDs) that contain heavy metals and display size-dependent fluorescent properties.10 Thus, CDs provide a promising alternative to metal QDs in traditional fields, such as biosensing, biomedicine, bioimaging, optoelectronics, and energy conversion.7,11–14

In 2004 Xu et al. performed a purification operation on single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and they accidentally discovered CDs.15 CDs then rapidly became a hot research subject. A series of advances occurred in this field ranging from various CD synthesis techniques to the discovery of diverse mechanisms for the exploitation of CDs (PL, biosensing mechanisms, etc.). Until now, CDs have been mainly divided into three groups: carbon nanodots (CNDs), polymer nanodots (PNDs/PDs) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs).16–19 Furthermore, CNDs can be further divided into amorphous carbon nanoparticles and typical carbon quantum dots (CQDs) that are commonly composed of nanocrystalline cores incorporated in amorphous carbogenic configuration.20Table 1 and Section 2 summarize the extensive number of approaches that have been used to synthesize CDs, such as laser ablation,21 microwave,22,23 hydrothermal,16,24,25 ultrasonication,26 solvothermal carbonization,27 electrolysis,28,29 and templated carbonization.1,3,17 CDs synthesized using these methods usually contain a certain amount of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.30 Depending on the synthesis routines, the oxygen content required (shown in Table 1) can be quite different between various groups of CDs. This is rooted in the differences in the degree of surface oxidation, which primarily controls the surface states of CDs with tunable PL properties.5,29 The predominant intrinsic factors used today for tuning the PL properties of CDs are mainly band gap transitions (governed by the size of the sp2-domain or the extent of the π-electron system),5 and surface defects (controlled by edge configuration and functional groups, such as hydroxyl, amide, carbonyl and carboxyl moieties connected to the CDs) (see “Section 3”).1 In addition, the synthetic methods can directly manipulate these factors. In 2007 Sun et al. were first to propose a fundamental PL-enhancing method to improve the extremely poor fluorescence of acid-treated CDs using surface passivation with PEG1500N (Fig. 1b).31 From then on, surface passivation and/or functionalization (SPF) strategies have been developed that use a variety of organic, inorganic, polymeric, and biological materials to control the PL properties of the CDs. It needs to be noted that the surface passivation process generally involves functional groups, such as amine groups and hydroxyl groups. In this case, passivation agents can be regarded as surface functionalization precursors. The ability to use SPF strategies to develop highly tunable photoluminescence properties is one of the most intriguing properties of CDs that have been developed by researchers. These SPF strategies are mainly grounded in the following mechanisms: (a) the quantum confinement effect, related to the size-dependent conjugated π-domain;32 (b) surface states, including molecule states33,34 and trap states35,36 that are controlled by special edge states on the edge of the carbon framework and the embellished functionalization groups on it.37,38

As an alternative technology, heteroatom doping is a highly efficient way to tune the fluorescent properties of CDs (an electron donator and/or acceptor) by impacting the electronic characteristics (main factor), and the surface and chemical (secondary factor) structures of it.39–42 By replacing a few compositions of the host's surface and/or interior, a substitutional guest with different valances directly modifies the electronic states of the host. This process is referred to as n-type doping (donating extra electrons, such as N, P, S, Cl-doping etc.) or p-type doping (providing extra holes, such as B-doping).43 These electrons or holes strongly influence the electronic structure (energy gap) of the CDs by introducing new energy/electronic states corresponding to the dopants. Then the change in the width/transition of the energy gap determines the variation in the intrinsic emission caused by the radiative recombination of electron–hole (e–h) pairs that come from the sp2-domains and/or surface states. The experimental evidence has also shown that radiative recombination induced by surface-confined electrons and holes in the CDs are the origin of the observed bright PL.36,44 Therefore, doping that introduces different atom impurities can manipulate the PL properties of CDs in both the intrinsic and surface electronic structures. Alternately, as shown Table 1, the promotion of the charge transfer ratio in CDs doped using impurities enhances their applicability in photocatalyst and energy conversion devices. However, it has also been found that doping CDs actually lowers the crystallinity of CDs.
There are many reviews in the primary literature that report on the development of CDs. Most of these focus on loose generalizations regarding preparation, properties, and applications. Even though important achievements have been made in this area, some issues like PL mechanisms and the corresponding interaction factors in synthesis are still debatable and need to be further researched. In this review, SPF and heteroatom doping are initially examined during the modified preparation process. As the two prevalent synthetic strategies, they ultimately have an intrinsic connection to the ability to modulate the fluorescent properties of CDs, especially from the perspective of relevant chemical and electronic structures. Then the predominant mechanisms associated with PL tuning that involve chemical and electronic transformation are presented. Finally, current challenges and perspectives on the emerging advances of CDs are discussed. This review can provide new insights into the origins of the fluorescent properties of CDs and understanding of the interaction between synthesis protocols and PL tuning.
2. Modified synthesis of carbon dots
After the first work on CDs reported by Xu et al.,15 tremendous new work on CD synthesis can be summarized with two broad categories that are “top-down” and “bottom-up” from the view of starting materials.1,7,17 In principle, this classification is flexible as considerable synthetic methods are supplementary to each other and not subject to the sort of raw materials, which will be elaborated in “Section 2.1” and “2.2” as well as “2.3”. Herein, the “top-down” approaches involve electrolysis, ultrasonication, laser ablation and acid treatment. Meanwhile, the solvothermal, hydrothermal treatment, templated support, microwave, and pyrolysis methods are grouped into the “bottom-up” side (Fig. 2). Among these methods, SPF as well as heteroatom doping can be rated as two indispensable approaches that tune the optical properties as one aspect of the most intrinsic properties of CDs, such as fluorescence quantum yield (QY), photo-catalytic performance etc. It is noted that the modulation processes of optical properties always occur by means of regulating the physical, chemical and electronic structures during the syntheses. Thus, comprehensive understanding of the specific roles of these two modified syntheses of CDs is still a hot research area. In this section, we primarily focus on synthetic strategies (SPF and heteroatom doping) along with an emphasis on physical and chemical structure features of CDs.

In some synthesis cases, morphological and structural characterization demonstrated that heteroatom doping doesn’t lead to distinct physical variation while it promotes the degree of amorphousness, implying that impurities tend to diminish the crystallinity of the carbon core. This phenomenon sometimes causes negatively defective sites (radicals, etc.) to quench the PL of CDs.45–47 In other words, heteroatom doping does not always mean a positive enhancement of the PL properties, and even the same dopant can induce two distinct outcomes using different or the same synthetic methods but not the same procedures.40,45 This reminds us that it is vital to not only select appropriate synthesis technology, but more importantly, design the synthetic roadmap for targets. In this regard, it is validated that the optimal PL properties are influenced by synthetic factors, i.e., the components and atomic ratio of starting materials,48,49 temperature (blue and green PL CDs are preferentially obtained at low temperature whereas long-wavelength (orange to red) emissive CDs are created at high temperature),50–52 reaction time (long reaction time may increase the degree of surface chemistry (surface oxidation) and the size of CDs, introducing more surface defects on the CDs and then narrowing the energy levels of the CDs),5,53–55 the medium (an oil-phase solvent could enable CD core growth under a more uniform heating atmosphere than a water-phase solvent and accordingly, CDs with a larger size of conjugated sp2-domains would be formed in the oil phase),21,37,56,57 pH (during preparation: strong acid or base causes a higher surface oxidation degree of CDs with longer emission as a result of the smaller energy gap of surface states in the oxidized CDs and a high concentration of oxidant readily facilitates the formation of larger CDs;5 post-treatment: higher pH is inclined to quench PL emission resulting from changes in the surface charge induced by protonation–deprotonation),9,58–60etc. From the view of morphology, these factors directly control the size and surface microstructure of CDs.
It has been verified that both surface functional groups and heteroatoms in the CDs can provide emissive trap states/sites (ETSs) or the density of states (DOS) for photoexcited electrons, as a consequence, each of them can be a prerequisite for tuning the PL processes.31,44,61 In most studies, the PL emission spectra of CDs have been broad exploited and displayed a common feature of a mutual overlap region in blue, and corresponding absorption features have shown weak and gradually damped absorption bands.8–11,45 These implied that conventional CDs are produced in complex mixtures and that a complete purification of CDs is strongly necessary with the assistance of centrifugation, dialysis and/or extraction.
2.1 Traditional synthetic methods, characterization and properties of CDs
2.1.1 Synthetic methods. 
Electrolysis. In contrast to other prevalent synthetic methods, electrolysis (also denoted as electrochemical oxidation) has been used as one of the most promising means to obtain high quality CDs with high purity, crystallinity and PL-tunability by virtue of inert supporting electrolytes and stable potential windows or current densities with high controllability. Carbon allotropes are exfoliated into luminescent carbon nanomaterials, i.e., a “top-down” method, and this method is widely applied with electrolysis. Ming et al. developed a cyclic voltammogram (CV) method to cut multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into CDs with an applied potential between −2.0 and 2.0 V. Here, tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) was used as a supporting electrolyte that played an important role in the intercalation process driven by potential cycling, and this caused tubes to be broken into CDs.62 By regulating the applied potentials, Pang's group achieved a size-tunable synthesis of CDs with a narrow size distribution using electrochemical etching of carbon fibers (CFs). The formation of as-prepared monodisperse CDs was attributed to the synergistic effect of the applied potential and the intercalation effect of the electrolyte in the turbostratic graphite structure of the CFs. A high applied potential led to a high surface oxidation degree of the CDs. The surface states were mainly derived from surface oxidation and were found to be a key element that dominated the PL of CDs.29 It should be noted that hydrophilic CQDs also served as stabilizer and exfoliation agents that exfoliated 3D materials to 2D counterparts by mitigating surface tension and weak interactions with the material's surface. This to some extent favored the generation of CDs. The excitation-dependent PL of the resulting CDs was attributed to the surface states.63 Using means of direct current technology, Lee's group developed an alkali-assisted synthesis of CDs with up-conversion PL (UCPL) properties using electrochemical oxidation of graphite rods. The as-prepared CDs displayed size-dependent PL that was dependent on the current intensity of the electrolysis.64 The up-converted PL of the CDs was due to effective energy-transfer to active sites of photocatalysts. The quantum-sized graphite structure rather than the C–O surface has been discovered to be the origin of PL of CDs. Two years later, the same group optimized the experimental design (Fig. 2A) by replacing the alkali-supporting electrolyte with ultrapure water. The resultant CDs without further purification showed similar PL performances as mentioned above, but the electrochemical synthetic procedure was time-consuming.28
Ultrasonication. Sonochemistry is regarded as one effect of ultrasonication. During the ultrasonic process, ultrasound would migrate through a medium, causing pressure variations and cavitations that grow and collapse, and then converting the sound waves into mechanical energy that may facilitate the polymerization, aromatization, and nucleating processes of CD formation.65 With the assistance of hydrogen peroxide as a mild oxidant used to oxidize the C–C bonds of active carbon, a type of CDs with UCPL and broad spectral PL properties can be directly synthesized by ultrasonic treatment.66 At present most research using ultrasonication is focused on using glucose assisted with alkali or acid conditions to prepare CDs.26,67,68 Typically, glucose was firstly dissolved in deionized water and then mixed with an additive of NaOH or HCl solution (as either H+ or OH− can catalyze carbohydrate carbonization22,64) followed by ultrasonic treatment for 4 h.67 After processing with neutralization as well as demineralization or deacidification, the resultant CDs show excellent UCPL and wide spectral PL characteristics ranging from the visible to near infrared (NIR) regions. Soon afterwards, with mild modifications of synthetic conditions (Fig. 2B),26 the UCPL of optimized CDs demonstrated a promising application in high efficiency photocatalyst design for energy transformation.68
Hydrothermal treatment. Using precursors ranging from small molecules to polymers, and from food commodities (milk, fruit) to waste (waste microorganisms), hydrothermal carbonization, the most effective and feracious way to form CDs, has been widely explored. The predominant characteristics of CDs synthesized using this method are the high water solubility and the rich surface functional sites that account for its further modifications and extensive applications. However, it may be deficient in the exact controllability of the size distribution and crystallinity of CDs due to the intrinsic flaws of water-based synthesis.4 A possible carbon nucleus growth mechanism was proposed by Yang et al. i.e., the precursor (ammonium citrate) was primarily aromatized by chemical dehydration of the inner molecules with a “polymerization” process. Then the intermediates were converted into carbon cores by a further carbonization process. Afterwards, the carbon cores were transferred into hydrophilic N-doped CDs assisted by surface chemistry (Fig. 2C).69 As a branch of CDs, polymer nanodots (PDs) generally stem from the interaction between luminescent conjugated polymers. Wang et al. reported an alkali-assisted one-step hydrothermal synthesis of PDs.19 Under alkali conditions, linear PEG was easy to carbonize in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The resulting PDs presented tunable excitation PL and a high QY of ca. 19%. After activating by EDC/NHS, the glutathione (GSH) functionalized PDs (GSH-PDs) as sensors showed sensitive responses to the intracellular temperature and Fe3+ ions. As waste microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus niger, and especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae with its low cost, were collected and hydrothermally treated (240 °C for 8 to 10 h) to develop a N,S,P co-doped CND (N,S,P-CND) probe.70 These microorganisms comprise sugars, proteins, and nucleic acids, all of which provided rich C, N, S and P sources for the prepared CDs. The obtained N,S,P-CND probe exhibited high stability against photobleaching, low toxicity and high sensitivity towards Mn(VII) (it was also applied to analyse samples from tap water, river water, and medicinal herbs) and L-ascorbic acid (AA). Moreover, the N,S,P-CND probe can be designed as an “AND” logic gate at the molecular level. Additionally, through hydrothermal methods, rhizome (traditional Chinese medicine),71 and strawberry juice72 were probed to create CDs for Hg2+ detection.
Templated carbonization. Generally, templated carbonization can fall into two categories: soft template carbonization and hard template carbonization. In retrospect, it has been discovered that the majority of those common synthetic methods could be carried out in aqueous conditions. Even though this contributes to promoting the hydrophilicity of CDs greatly, in turn, the hydrophilic moieties (as sources of aromatization, and nucleating processes of carbon cores) anchored on the surface of CDs are prone to favor the growth of carbon domains to unexpected size distributions. Thus, Kwon et al. designed a self-assembly soft template (a “water-in-oil” emulsion) method to realize good control of the size of carbon cores by regulating the concentration of a surface capping agent (oleylamine). The growth of finalized oleylamine-capped CNDs (shown in Fig. 2D) was also determined by the heating temperature related to the rate of intermolecular dehydration and linking.4 This method is highly scalable for a wide range of applications, especially electronic devices, through changing the liquid-phase precursors.46 Alternatively, exploiting a hard template with a nano pore size to curb the size distribution of CDs is considerably practical. Zong et al. utilized size uniform mesoporous silica (MS) spheres as ideal hard templates with a mean pore size of 3.6 nm for producing hydrophilic CDs with a narrow size distribution.73 The 3D porous channels as nanoreactors (providing rapid heating and high homogeneity for growth rates at different regions of the reactor) and uniform pore size are responsible for both confining the overgrowth of carbon cores and deterring CDs from aggregation.

It is well known that the working principle of a microwave is to cause polar molecules (such as water) in a medium to rotate using electromagnetic radiation, generating thermal energy promptly and evenly through uniform excitation.74 Thus, the syntheses of CDs using microwave-assisted methods have the merits of short duration, commonly just taking several minutes, and no pollution.22,42,54,75 A rapid microwave-assisted facile synthesis of CDs without surface passivation regents was developed by Wang et al.22 In their work, though inorganic ions as additives, such as H+, Na+, Cu2+, Ca2+, and Al3+, showed positive acceleration to the carbonization of carbohydrates (glycerol, glycol, glucose or sucrose) as precursors, the optimized QY of synthesized CDs (9.5%) is still unremarkable. Soon a further optimized scheme of CD synthesis using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MAH) method showed a more efficient process with one single precursor (glucose/sucrose/fructose), no requirement for any additives and an improved QY of 11% (Fig. 2E).75 The synthesis reaction of this method was performed in a cover-tightened glass bottle. It has been corroborated that a high and constant pressure of the reaction container is key to manipulate the monodispersity and then the PL properties (QY and PL excitation spectra).42 Moreover, introducing dopants (ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylamine, triethylamine etc.) as starting materials with a synergistic effect on the synthesis process of CDs can dramatically improve the QY (75.96%) of CDs. In Liu's work, factors such as reaction temperature, reaction time and the raw material ratio exhibited a strong influence on the PL performance of the prepared N-doped CDs.54
Solvothermal carbonization. Compared with hydrothermal treatment, the solvents adopted in solvothermal carbonization tend to integrate many functions in one. Representative dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent is commonly involved in CD processing in light of its high water solubility, chemical reactivity, nitrogen-rich composition and uniform heating, all of which provide potential routes for thermal reduction and SPF for CDs. On the basis of these properties, Sun's group reported S,N co-doped GQDs (S,N-GQDs) developed using facile solvothermal carbonization in DMF.76 If the heating temperature exceeds its boiling point (153 °C), DMF would be degraded to dimethylamine, which could react with the epoxy group on the surface of GO to produce 1,2-aminoalcohol through nucleophilic ring-opening. This route rationally explains the formation of N-doped GQDs.77 Recently, Shin et al. implemented a solvothermal redox (namely, the reaction combined radical oxidation with solvothermal reduction) synthesis of GQDs with mass production in DMF (Fig. 2F). Unlike traditional strong acid oxidation treatment for GQD preparation, oxone (potassium monopersulfate) used in this work worked as a neutral oxidant that generated radicals for C–C bond scission and carbon core cleavage.27 In contrast with the work of Yang's group,56 the solvothermal redox method can extend to varied carbon starting materials (graphite, carbon nanotubes, carbon fiber, and charcoal). According to the latest development, solvothermal carbonization is highly appropriate for fabricating UV-blocking CD composite films (CQD–PVA film) in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with stable UV-blocking due to the one-step integration with no need for extra post-treatments.78
Pyrolysis. Usually, the experiment set and reaction conditions for synthesis of CDs by pyrolysis are simple and clear, for instance, an open container containing starting materials is just directly heated in a heating mantle under ambient atmosphere.55,59 Whereas the size distribution of the resulting CDs tended to be inhomogeneous on account of loose control of the reaction parameters (pressure and homogeneous reaction temperature). Chi's group found that the pyrolysis time at 200 °C of CA had an evident effect on the structure and corresponding PL properties of the CDs.55 With 30 min heating of CA, the synthesized GQDs possessed excitation-independent PL and a narrow full width at half maximum of 66 nm due to the uniform sp2 clusters in the GQDs that were well passivated by hydrophilic groups. In comparison, 2 h thermolysis of CA would lead to the formation of GO with fewer and heterogeneous sp2 clusters isolated in the sp3 C–O substrate, inducing a weak QY and excitation-dependent PL. On the basis of these results, Lin's group proposed highly luminescent nitrogen-doped and amino acid functionalized graphene quantum dots (NA-GQDs) with a QY of 16% by pyrolyzing glycine with the assistance of ethylene glycol as solvent. The NA-GQDs show dual sensing of Fe(III) and Hg(II) ions due to the thermodynamic affinity between ions and the ligands on the surface of NA-GQDs (Fig. 2G).59 Aiming to improve the uneven size distribution of the resulting CDs by pyrolysis of glycerol under reflux conditions, mesoporous silica nanoparticles can be selected as additives to the synthetic procedures by means of the benefits of hard templates as mentioned before. The control group under N2 atmosphere revealed that oxygen could be a key factor to facilitate the formation of CDs.79 On the contrary, Stan et al. displayed a one-step thermal decomposition synthesis of fluorescent CDs under ambient N2.80 Thus, to understand the effect of inert and oxidation environments on the physical and optical performance of CDs, Machado et al. performed a group of contrast experiments to create CDs stemming from a C, H, O system under an inert (CD-in in a tubular oven) and an air (CD-ox) environment separately.81 It was indicated that the pyrolysis atmosphere had no obvious influence on the optical performance of the pyrolyzed CDs. The difference is that the reaction environment mainly affects the composition and structure of the CDs, more specifically, the crystallinity of CD-ox is distinctly higher than CD-in.
Acid treatment. This method is also denominated as chemical oxidation in that selecting applicable oxidants (H2SO4, HNO3, H2O2/AcOH, etc.) is a requisite condition for the oxidation and/or exfoliation procedures to process starting materials introducing surface oxidation to the CDs. Thus essential post-treatments including neutralization for CD purification are necessary but come with pollution and tedious operation. To guarantee a sufficient oxidation effect on CD synthesis, the operation of refluxing raw material with oxidant usually costs a relatively long time from several to dozens of hours.2,82,83 Candle soot with easy accessibility by combustion can be broken down into CDs with excellent dispersibility by refluxing with HNO3. It was also confirmed that H2O2/AcOH = 2:1 as oxidants of the control experiment can lead to blue CDs.2 As a scalable synthetic routine, a mixed acid (sulfuric acid:nitric acid = 3:1) reflux method was effectively used to prepare three types of CDs with similar PL performance from various carbon sources (graphite and carbon nanotubes: SWNTs and MWNTs). A series of results of in vivo testing, such as in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging in animals, in vivo biodistribution of CDs, blood tests and histological analysis, identically showed that the produced CDs had no obvious toxicity.82 This method was subsequently applied to oxidize and chemically exfoliate pitch carbon fibers into GQDs with a zigzag edge graphene structure (Fig. 2H).83 The size of the as-synthesized GQDs can be customized by the reaction temperatures. Due to the interdependency between energy gap and size,64 shape,84 and fraction of the localized sp2 sites,85 the PL properties and energy gap can be tailored accordingly. It was also shown that the size control of GQDs was readily managed if the raw materials possessed an intact sp2 domain structure. In similar work, the oxidizing time and concentration of HNO3 revealed their strong capabilities in harnessing the surface oxidation degree of the synthesized CDs with tunable PL.5 Additionally, Yu's group reported a rapid H2SO4-oxidative synthesis of sulfur-doped CDs (S-CDs) using waste frying oil (WFO).86 The resultant S-CDs show excitation-dependent PL owing to various surface emissive trap sites instead of the wide size distribution.
Laser ablation. In 2006, Sun's group first found a laser ablation method for synthesizing CDs using a Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 10 Hz) to ablate a graphite target in argon flow. However, the resultants presented non-detectable PL even further treated by acid oxidation for dozens of hours. To tackle the problem, introducing surface passivation with PEG1500N can fundamentally activate the emissive sites of the passivated particle surface arising from quantum confinement of emissive energy traps (Fig. 1b).31 In general, this method exists with some drawbacks, such as complex processes and time-consuming post-treatments. Thus, Hu et al. proposed a one-step preparation of CDs by laser irradiation in a mixture of graphite powder and PEG solvent.37 In this study, with laser ablation, both the thermodynamic state and plasma state on graphite were produced successively and finally carbon plasmas were converted into CDs with a diamond-like structure. During this process, the surface of the CDs is probably further oxidized by oxygen atoms or reacts with PEG causing generation of carboxylate groups as a surface state that plays an important role in the PL of the synthesized CDs. As an advance of this approach, Li et al. simplified the raw materials using a nano-carbon material and ethanol or acetone as the medium (Fig. 2I). It has been verified that laser ablation was conducive to form carbon- and oxygen-related radicals that transformed into various oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the CDs, which may determine the PL properties of the CDs.21On the whole, synthetic methods that include electrolysis, solvothermal, and templated carbonization (especially hard template carbonization) have revealed potential superiority in the control of the growth, size distribution, and surface properties of CDs. These methods utilize accurate potential regulation and rapid and high homogeneous heating for separate growth. Furthermore, uniform reaction conditions can help to exclude the mutual interference of different factors on synthesis, therefore validating the main factors that regulate synthesis. This information could direct future progress in the precision, control, and goal-oriented synthesis of CDs.

2.1.2 Characterization of CDs (size, morphology, structure, and optical properties). 
Approaches and techniques. Prior to having diverse forms of characterization applied to it, the CD stock solution should be purified with the procedures of centrifugation, pH regulation, and dialysis. To avoid subsidence effects, the supernatant in quartz cuvettes should always be tested by a spectrofluorophotometer to obtain steady state PL data, such as PL excitation and emission spectra, 3D-luminescence plots, and the QY (1: the gradient method using quinine sulfate (QY = 0.54 in deionized water) as a standard;58 2: absolute QY measurement utilizing an integrating sphere accessory9). As for transient PL spectra information, time-resolved emission spectroscopy, time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements, fluorescence upconversion (luminescence dynamics on a time scale shorter than TCSPC), and transient absorption (for excited-state dynamics) spectroscopies are applied to measure the excited-state lifetime.42 The same sample condition is required by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer for UV/vis absorption spectra. A small droplet of the supernatant containing synthesized CDs should be deposited onto an ultrathin carbon film (predominant) or copper grid for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) observations for structural information (morphologies and crystal structures). Small droplets of the supernatant can be dispersed and then dried on silicon slices for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Raman spectra and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis separately. 1H and 13C NMR spectra (liquid and solid state) as well as mass spectra and liquid chromatogram analysis are recorded to provide the composition of CDs. For Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) characterization, the specimen preparation of CDs can be made through coating and drying on a fresh CaF2 window.9 The cytotoxicity of CDs was assessed using various cells (HeLa cells,79 human breast cancer cells,83 human U87 cells,24 293T cells,82etc.), cultured and maintained in a DMEM medium with MTT viability assay using a microplate reader. The cells used for bioimaging with a microscope equipped with a CCD camera should be incubated with the addition of CDs in the culture medium under regular cell culture conditions. Size. The size distribution of CDs is usually statistically analyzed using HR-TEM or AFM images and CDs are typically confined between 1 and 10 nm.1,9,42Morphologies. As shown in Fig. 1a, the combination of a crystalline sp2 carbon core (can be corroborated with signals in 1H and 13C NMR spectra as well34,42) with outer amorphous carbon (sp3 hybridized) functionalized with oxygenic groups is the common morphological feature noted in most of the CDs prepared using these synthetic methods (Table 1).4 Under some conditions, amorphous carbon nanoparticles created using hydrothermal treatment without any lattices were also found.34Structure. Elemental data from XPS and EDS have verified that the basic chemical composition consists of C, H, O and N elements with flexible content ratios based on the synthesis conditions and raw materials. Pertaining to the chemical structural models of CDs, the diamond-like structure, the graphite structure with sp3 defects, the graphite oxide structure, the amorphous carbon structure, and the graphitic cluster structure are specifically discussed in a previous review paper.41 It has been found that all these confirmed structures contain defects to a certain extent (amorphous carbogenic profiles as demonstrated by broad reflections in XRD patterns34,42,46,62,83,87) as can be seen in the illustration of Fig. 1a. These defects are mainly situated in different oxygenic moieties (C–O–C, COOH, C–OH, and epoxy groups from FTIR and XPS data).28,37,55,83 Furthermore, these chemical structures show a strong correlation with the electronic structures of CDs, which can be elucidated using molecular orbital (MO) theory.45,75,88,89 Namely, CDs possess σ/n → σ* and n/π → π* transitions. The π-states of CDs are primarily determined by the aromatic sp2 carbons in their domains. As an illustration, it has been documented that a negative correlation between the number of aromatic carbons and the energy gap between π-states (excited states and the ground state) is similar to the case of p-conjugation in organic molecules.64,90 In addition, the n-states that are governed by the lone pairs of functional moieties linked to the defects contribute to the electron transition to the π-states, which also has a noticeable influence on the optical properties. Optical properties. The chemical and electronic structures lay the foundation for the optical properties of CDs. These properties include optical absorption (in the UV region from 260–320 nm), PL, UCPL, and photo-induced electron transfer properties (based on the excellent electron-donor and electron-acceptor characteristics of CDs). In general, even though substantial explanations have been ascribed to observed PL emissions, the origin of CD PL can be briefly summarized with two categories: (1) intrinsic state emission: the size variation of sp2 hybridized carbon domains induce the change in bandgap transitions/emission; and (2) defective state emission: the defects related to the functionalized groups from CDs reconfigure the distribution of emission centers that originate from trap site edge states and molecule states (see Section 3). The mechanisms for UCPL are dominated by two-photon excitation mechanisms, but further exploration is needed.44,77,91

2.2 Surface passivation and/or functionalization (SPF) strategy
Structurally, CDs contain amounts of carbonaceous sp2 and sp3. On a micro level, they are accompanied by a large number of defects with non-perfect sp2 domains.31,55 These create or induce the energy gaps that impart PL to CDs. The carbon cores are the origins of the PL of CDs and their preferred size is ultrafine (<10 nm generally), and they commonly exist in inhomogeneous surface states/sites (or surface energy traps).11–13 CDs are treated using organic or polymeric passivation that motivates the localization of e–h pairs on these surface states. More succinctly, the surface passivation treatment process plays a role in the elimination of the dissipation of photoinduced carriers from surface sites, thus enabling more highly efficient radiative recombination and causing the enhancement of the PL properties of CDs. As a result, in contrast to the bare counterparts, surface-passivated CDs become highly optically active, displaying significant PL from the visible to the near-infrared spectral regions. For instance, Xue et al. developed a facile polyethylenimine-assisted hydrothermal cutting process to create monodisperse GQDs. After passivation using polyethylenimine, the GQDs showed significantly improved photoluminescence (a QY of 21%) with excitation- and pH-independent characteristics.92
Up to now, the predominant passivation agents have been organic molecules and polymers. Correspondingly, the SPF strategies can be classified as SPF-organic molecule and SPF-polymer. In SPF-organic molecule mode, the passivation agents are generally treated as or considered precursors simultaneously. Therefore, it is sometimes hard to distinguish the role of passivation in the starting materials during synthesis. This may be the reason for the few studies regarding SPF-organic molecules. Intriguingly, the majority of organic molecules that have been used as passivation agents as well as dopant sources (commonly refers to nitrogen) exert a synergistic effect on the enhancement of PL properties (illustrated in the following section). This makes these kinds of passivated CDs prevail over other counterparts produced using a single element, e.g. a passivation agent or dopant source.
Commonly, polymers such as PEG1500N,10 polyethyleneimine (PEI),78,87,93 and poly-(propionylethylenimine-co-ethylenimine) (PPEI-EI)44 that have been utilized as SPF agents are evidently nonemissive in the UV/vis range. This evidently indicates the key role passivation agents play in the improvement of PL properties of CDs.
As a general rule of thumb, prior to the SPF process, oxidization using concentrated acids on low/non-QY CDs has been frequently-used procedure to introduce diverse oxygen groups, i.e., hydroxyl, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups, and also surface defects to the surface of CDs.10,52 This provides extensive anchors for binding of the passivation agents.
2.2.1 SPF-organic molecules. The most common passivation molecules are mainly amine molecules, such as thiourea,76 EDA,34,48,54,94,95 4,7,10-trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine (TTDDA),53,96 and 1-hexadecylamine.61,97 To understand the role of diverse amine molecules on passivation, Liu's group demonstrated a set of surface-passivated CDs with one-step microwave-assisted thermolysis of citric acid mixed with diverse amine molecules (e.g. EDA, diethylamine (DEA), triethylamine (TEA) and 1,4-butanediamine (BDA)). Compared to other amine molecules that served dual functions as the carbon source and the passivation agent (Fig. 3), EDA (a primary amine with a short chain structure) passivated CDs showed the highest QY of 30.2% and both N-doping and the surface amide group accounted for the enhanced PL. It has also been confirmed that the molar ratios of amine/carboxyl groups, as well as the microwave irradiation time, are the determining factors that affect the PL properties.48

The same group applied the same microwave protocol to the pyrolysis of glycerol, phosphate, and a TTDDA mixture to prepare C-dots. Here, a certain proportion of TTDDA can facilitate the dehydration and then formation of CDs with an increased QY of 12.02% (Fig. 4).53 Using this as a starting point, Yang's team created a modified hydrothermal protocol for the CA and EDA mixture with systematic heating from a low to a high temperature.

Meticulous experimental designs have disclosed that the surface functional groups in CDs, reaction temperature, and molar ratio of CA and EDA (MC–E) are the key factors for tuning PL properties. If the majority groups are –OH and –COOH, the QYs of formed CDs are almost less than 10%. Then, in the presence of amine molecules, the QYs of most CDs are beyond 10%. Moreover, when the MC–E was ≤3:2, as shown in Fig. 5A, the polymer-like CDs needed further carbonization. When the MC–E was ≥4:2, the carbonization treatment of polymer-like CDs was difficult to attain. Furthermore, with a rise in the reaction temperature, the carbon ratio gradually increased, while the percentage of oxygen decreased. This meant that a more thorough carbonization progress took place in the more polymer-like CDs transformed into carbogenic CDs. As displayed in Fig. 5B, it is also observed that the excitation-independent PL changed into excitation-dependent, and the illumination stability intensified.34 With the synergistic modulations of heteroatom doping and SPF, a facile solvothermal path to achieve passivated S,N-GQDs was achieved by Qu et al. Typically, CA and thiourea were stirred into DMF until a transparent solution was attained, which was then was pyrolyzed at 180 °C in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for a period of eight hours. The resultant S,N-GQDs were subsequently garnered using centrifugation with ethanol. Their characterization results revealed that thiourea played a twofold role to fundamentally boost the PL of the GQDs in the synthesis process: (1) it acted as the S and N doping sources simultaneously; and (2) it served as the passivation agent that constituted the edge functional groups. In addition, DMF, as a N-containing solvent, facilitated the generation of tertiary N and improved the N content, and thus may further passivate the S,N-GQDs. All these factors formed the foundation for the high QY (61%, 45%, and 8% for the emissions at 340, 440, and 540 nm, respectively) in the obtained S,N-GQDs.76

2.2.2 SPF-polymers. 
2.2.2.1 PEG series. Liu et al. presented a cost-efficient approach to produce CDs with wet chemistry. Fig. 6a illustrates the synthetic map of the surfactant F127 (EO106PO70EO106, Mw = 12600; EO = ethylene oxide, PO = propylene oxide) modified SiO2 colloids that were initially dispersed and mixed with the prepared resols as carbon precursors in basic conditions. After 48 hours of stirring and centrifugation for resol polymerization on the surfactant shells, satellite-like polymer/F127/silica composites were obtained. Following calcination treatment of the composites at 900 °C (C/SiO2 composites) and etching with NaOH followed by neutralization, dialysis, and oxidization using concentrated nitric acid to create –COOH on the surface of the CDs, the CDs were separated from the mixture, however, they did not emit luminescence. To circumvent this issue, a typical SPF process using PEG1500N was performed, and the passivated CDs showed an enhanced QY of 14.7%, which might be attributed to the increased emissive traps states induced by SPF.10 To properly regulate the oxidation, Shen et al. reported synthesized CDs with surface passivation using PEG1500N followed by hydrazine hydrate reduction to graphene oxide (GO), which was first oxidized using HNO3 and exfoliated into small GO fragments.52 The synthesized CDs with a size distribution of 5–19 nm and a QY of 7.4% exhibited UCPL, which may have been dominated by a multiphoton active process and anti-Stokes photoluminescence. Using a pyrolysis process, Lai et al. employed glycerol as a carbon precursor in addition to a solvent of mixed oligomeric poly(ethylene glycol) amine (PEG900N) and heated under reflux to ∼230 °C for 30 minutes without a nitrogen purge. After dialysis, surface passivated CDs were obtained.79 To curb the size distribution of the CDs, the authors further developed the synthetic route by using mesoporous silica (mSiO2).98 Analogously, the as-synthesized mSiO2 nanoparticles were dispersed in the PEG900N and glycerol and heated to 230 °C for 30 minutes (Fig. 6b). To remove the unwanted chemicals, the CD@mSiO2–PEG was then purified via repeated centrifugation procedures in ethanol. Here, the passivation agents not only enhanced the emission intensity of the CDs, but also improved the bio-compatibility of the CDs.

Recently, food-grade konjac flour (KF), a health-food raw material, was developed using one-step pyrolysis to N doped CDs (N-CDs, QY: 22%) by Teng and coworkers. The PL intensity of the synthesized N-CDs was modulated using non-amine-terminated PEG with different molecular weights (Mw). According to the typical process, KF was initially pyrolyzed at 470 °C for 1.5 hours in ambient air, and then the carbonized products were ground, dispersed into ethanol, and stirred for a whole night to extract the N-CDs. After several alternant purification processes using ethanol and deionized water, a purified N-CD ethanol dispersion was obtained and then mixed with PEG1500, PEG2000, PEG6000, and PEG20000. The mixed solutions were then refluxed at 90 °C with rapid agitation in a N2 atmosphere. Finally, the PL intensity of the formed N-CDs processed using PEG passivation showed a linear rise with increased Mw, and the PEG20000 passivated N-CDs showed a higher intensity, as much as 5.2 times that of the raw counterparts.99
2.2.2.2 PPEI-EI and PEI. The first to elaborate on the improvement of PL performance of crude CDs using a surface passivation agent PEG1500N was Sun's group. They soon fabricated PPEI-EI passivated CDs based on laser ablation.44 Exploratory experiments showed the as-prepared CDs had potential for cell labelling in two-photon luminescence microscopy. In 2014, the same work was applied to an LED device that utilized the electroluminescence properties of PPEI-EI passivated CDs.100 A PEI with a short chain and rich –NH2 groups is conductive and improves PL properties via facilitating the emissive recombination of localized e–h pairs.87,93 Liu et al. proposed a one-step hydrothermal processing route to synthesise linear-structured PEI passivated nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs). LPEI played dual key roles as: (1) a N-precursor for N doping and (2) the passivation agent, causing a high QY of 37.4% of the formed N-CQDs. Furthermore, the acquired N-CQDs exhibited specious UCPL properties, which were verified to be an illusion that originated from the second-order diffraction light emitted by the monochromators of the spectrofluorimeter. In one advance, Liu's group fabricated one PEI functionalized carbon dot (CD-c) via one-step microwave assisted pyrolysis of glycerol and a branched PEI25k mixture. During synthesis (Fig. 7), the PEI molecule acted not only as a nitrogen-rich passivation agent to promote the PL, but also as a polyelectrolyte to condense the DNA. In addition, a pyrolysis time of 10 minutes made the CD-PEI achieve its highest PL intensity, and the balance between pyrolysis time and PL intensity was assigned to the variance in the amino groups on the surface of the CDs. Also, the PEI dosage was another associated factor that affected the PL properties.87 Hess et al. used a one-pot solvothermal treatment of branched PEI and CA in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. The PEI passivated CQDs resolved in PVA (CQD–PVA) could be applied to synthesize transparent UV protection films without purification and polymer-blending prior to film casting (Fig. 8A).78

2.2.2.3 Others. In contrast to the traditional hydrothermal protocol, the microwave process enables the reaction medium to undergo rapid and even heating, significantly shortening the reaction time. In 2012, Lau and his associates described self-passivated GQDs that emitted a deep ultraviolet wavelength, which was ascribed to the self-passivated C–O based functional groups. The GQDs were synthesized in a glucose solution siphoned into a glass bottle with a tightened cover and heated using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach that integrated the major merits of both the hydrothermal and microwave techniques. The growth of the GQDs was affected by the heating time, microwave power, source concentration, and solution volume.75 Recently, Yang et al. demonstrated a facile, cost-effective microwave-assisted process to produce passivated CDs with polyamine-containing organosilane molecules (3-[2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethylamino]propyl-trimethoxysilane, abbreviated as AEEA). In the synthesis, glycerol acted as the carbon source and the reaction medium and provided rich hydroxyl groups to the surface of the water-soluble CDs. Meanwhile, rich amine groups from the AEEA acted as passivation and functionalization agents that enabled covalent bonding between the surface of the CDs and an anticancer drug (DOX-SH) to form a CD-based drug nanocarrier.101 As displayed in Fig. 8B, the obtained CDs also showed potential application in cell imaging. Interestingly, Han et al. introduced Ca(OH)2 as a dual surface passivation agent to fabricate CDs with an impressive QY of 86%. More specifically, Ca2+ prevented the surface functional groups from excessive consumption during the dehydration and carbonization of the hydrothermal treatment of the mixture of CA, EDA, and Ca(OH)2. Also, OH− promoted the transformation of electron-withdrawing groups (–COOH) to electron-donating groups (–OH), which was responsible for the elevated QY of the CDs.102

2.3 Heteroatom doping
As aforementioned, SPF has been verified as a practical protocol to tune the PL of pristine CDs with significant impact. It is also worth noting that the QYs of a majority of passivated CDs were around 10%, with a small number beyond 20%.99 This greatly impedes the broad application of CDs treated with SPF.103 Therefore, more endeavors have been made to exploit the heteroatom doping protocol to improve the PL performance of CDs. So far, heteroatom doping has been extensively conducted to tune the optical and electrical properties for bioimaging,22,44,79,99 biosensing,16,25,30,39 photocatalysis,26,76 electrocatalysis,104–106 energy conversion and storage,45,107,108etc. However, in terms of carbon, the term doping may be amphibolous and it refers to not only in-plane substitution in the carbon framework, but also intercalation, or surface replacement.61,109,110
Prior to providing insights into the mechanisms of the PL tuning process, the chemical properties of heteroatoms as dopants will be discussed, as they are compelling due to their fundamental effects on the manipulation of PL properties of CDs. Section 3 will expound on the electronic effects of heteroatoms on CD electronegativity (χ) describing how well an atom (dopant) can attract an electron to itself, and electronegativity is applied to estimate whether a bond between atoms will be ionic or covalent. Fig. 9 shows the electronegativity values of the dopants,111 among which carbon (its χ is equal to selenium (Se)) is the demarcation point that divides the dopants (only confined to the data in Fig. 9) into electron-withdrawing carriers (χ > 2.58) and electronic-donor carriers (χ < 2.58). In molecular orbital theory, a dopant in a host introduces an allowed energy state within the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (the HOMO–LUMO gap).45,76,112 As for doped CDs (ignoring the O state), a dopant with a high χ induces a high energy state within the HOMO–LUMO gap. This tends to lead to a blue-shifted PL spectra resulting from the electron withdrawing effect and a higher energy for light absorption with respect to the undoped host.45,103,113 On the contrary, a dopant with a lower χ favors red-shifted spectra owing to the electronic donor effect and a lower energy for photoexcitation.76,112 However, the O state in almost all the CDs is non-negligible. Oxygen (Fig. 9) is a strong electron–acceptor, and its χ is higher than most of the other dopants, as it contains a lone pair of electrons. Thus, oxygen induced doping in CDs coexists with an electron withdrawing effect and electronic donor effect, which can be correlated to some anomalies. As shown in Table 1, the oxidized CDs synthesized in an aqueous phase show a weaker PL than doped CDs synthesized with impurities with χ lower than O. The anomaly has been verified by results that have shown that oxygen-containing groups (like carboxy and epoxy) tend to encourage the non-radiative recombination of trapped e–h pairs and then restrain the intrinsic state emission.112 Also, doped CDs (χ of the dopant lower than O) prepared in an oil phase show a significantly low QY and red shifted PL spectra compared to the oxidized CDs synthesized using the same method. This result is ascribed to doping induced defective sites (radical, etc.) dissipating and quenching the PL of CDs.45,46 In addition, the number of O states and other energy states corresponding to the dopant type are directly associated with the doping content and can be regulated by changing the proportion of raw materials, resulting in different QY and PL properties.88 Most reports have confirmed that higher oxygen content leads to lower QY coming out of defect-based non-radiation groups. Therefore, the selection of the synthesis method and synthetic roadmaps are prerequisites to decide the targeted performance of acquired CDs and also to control their properties in accordance with object-oriented protocols. Overall, doping CDs with heteroatoms exerts effective effects for the tuning of their intrinsic properties (optical, electronic, and chemical aspects) compared to their undoped counterparts, such as QY, emission spectra shifting, charge transfer ratio, orbital structures, surface and local chemical features, and others. According to the type of the majority of charge carriers (i.e., holes or electrons), the predominant heteroatom doping process will be introduced in two parts: N-type doping and P-type doping.

As for co-doping CDs, such as with N,S-, N,B-, N,P-, and other co-doping types, generally, it shows an improved QY of obtained co-doped CDs. This may be ascribed to the synergistic effect of radiative recombination of trapped e–h pairs from multiple energy states corresponding to the dopants.
2.3.1 N-Type doping. 
2.3.1.1 Nitrogen doping. Nitrogen doping has been shown to be a dominant influence on the tuning of the PL properties of CDs derived from the intrinsic characteristics of the nitrogen atom, such as the similar atomic radius with carbon, high χ, five valence electrons for chemical bonding, and a lone pair of electrons with a strong affinity to the sp2 carbon domain.46,106,114 The real function of these characteristics is to change the electronic structure of the host accompanied by a variation in the chemical structure during the synthesis process.49,88–114 Solution chemistry is a versatile synthesis method that has been utilized to yield N-doped colloidal GQDs with uniform sizes and well-defined structures by Li's team. In Li's work, three types of GQDs (signified as 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 10a) were obtained. The synthetic routine began with 2-bromo-5-iodo-3′-(phenylethynyl)-1,1′-biphenyl and phenylboronic acid with a multistep typical organic process to produce a N-doping intermediate. This was then treated with various double Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, generating the precursors of 1 and 2, respectively, which were then obtained by reacting with the excess of iron(III) chloride under a constant flow of argon in a dichloromethane/nitromethane mixture under ambient conditions. QD 3 was analogously produced from α,β-diketone 5 with the Wittig reaction and then Suzuki coupling and oxidative dehydrogenation.106 Here the solution chemistry protocol imparted a twofold inspiration of how to regulate the dopant numbers in the QDs and also manipulate their bonding configurations, and the prepared N-doped GQDs showed size-dependent catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In the same year, Liu et al. developed a green and low-cost route to N-doped polymer nanodots (NPPDs) using hydrothermal treatment of grass. Briefly, grass was added to water as a dual source of N and C. Then the mixture was heated in a Teflon lined autoclave at 180 °C for three hours.16 The possible growing process of N-conjugated graphene cores (N-GQDs) from small molecules (i.e., a “bottom-up” method) using the hydrothermal treatment was documented by Qu and colleagues (Fig. 10b).49 First, CA, as the most commonly used carbon source, was mixed with amine as a base to accelerate the dehydrolysis process. In the early stages of the hydrothermal reaction performed at 160 °C for four hours in the mixture, the CA converted to a sheet structure by self-assembly and then dehydrolyzed to a graphene matrix. Meanwhile, the substitution reaction between CA and the amine produced amide molecules, which subsequently interacted with neighboring –COOH groups and yielded pyrrolic N via intramolecular dehydrolysis. As the reaction continued, part of the pyrrolic N converted to graphite N. With the ratio of graphite N to pyrrolic N rising, the QY of the prepared N-GQDs showed a further remarkable improvement. To investigate the effect of types of amines on QY, controlled trials with a series of amide molecules as N sources (hexamethylene tetraamine: HMTA, and DEA, ethanol amine: EA, and EDA) were implemented. As a result, the N-GQDs that had originated from the EDA had the highest QY of 94%. The preferred choices of dopants for improving the QY of CDs performed in the following order: primary amine > secondary amine (while tertiary amines are rarely applied to produce CDs), and diamine > monoamine. These results were in accordance with Liu's work.48

Zhang et al. employed a solid-phase synthesis to fabricate high-quality N-doped C-dots with a high product yield and a QY of 31%. As is typical, the PEG-diamine and AC were mixed and ground to a powder in an agate mortar. Then, the mixture was heated in a Teflon lined autoclave at for 180 °C for one hour. This method controlled the morphology and surface chemistry well, as well as the QY and production of N-doped C-dots.103 To control the chemical and optical properties of the CDs, Rhee's group introduced a soft-template synthesis to develop N-CNDs with tunable PL and organic solubility. The property modulation of the N-CNDs was based on altering the concentration of EDA without significant deviation in size.46 As shown in Fig. 2D, during the synthesis, an EDA and CA mixture solution was heated in an oil phase made of oleylamine and octadecene at 250 °C for two hours. Oleylamine acted as a surface capping agent (an emulsifier), and it strongly affected the rate of core growth in the CDs. Therefore, this method controlled the size of CDs well. Alternately, the oleylamine cap on the N-CNDs caused a high QY in the N-CNDs. One presumable explanation for this can be attributed to surface chemical bonding with oleylamine removing the surface non-emissive trap states that correlated to radicals and dangling bonds.4,61 With an increase in the N content of the N-CNDs, the PL emission spectra red-shifted. This may have been connected to the oil phase synthetic environment, since oleylamine ligands serve as auxochromes to lessen the energy gap.4
2.3.1.2 Phosphorus doping. As a predominant electron donor in semiconductors, the P atom can well influence the chemical and electronic structures of semiconductors that were endowed promising applications in photovoltaic devices and catalysts.115–118 While compared with the C atom, the size of the P atom is larger, which is a direct factor to increase disorder within the P-doped graphite carbon backbone.119 This may be the reason for relatively fewer reports on single-P doping for CDs. In 2013, P containing CDs (PCDs) were firstly developed by Wang et al. with phytic acid (PA) and EDA using a microwave approach. The PCDs showed a strong green fluorescence with a QY of 21.65% and low cytotoxicity for cell labeling.120 A solvent-thermal method was employed to produce P-doped carbon quantum dots (PCQDs) based on the reaction between phosphorous bromide and hydroquinone. The PCQDs display a high QY of 25.1% in ethanol and 17.7% in water solution.121 Recently, Peng's group reported phosphorus doped carbon dots (P-CDs) by hydrothermally treating triethyl phosphonoacetate in concentrated phosphoric acid solution at 200 °C for 12 h. The P-CDs displayed a feature of aggregation induced red shift emission (AIRSE), i.e., with the increase of concentration of P-CDs in a certain range, the emission spectra were red shifted. This may be ascribed to the extension of the electron rich system of the P-CDs after aggregation.122 In the same year, Ma's team applied an electrochemical synthesis method to etch high-purity graphite rods with the scanning voltage at 5 V (Fig. 11). It was confirmed that the sodium phytate electrolyte contributed to the formation of phosphorus-doped graphene quantum dots (P-GQDs) due to its unique structure with six sodium phosphate moieties. Nevertheless, the monodisperse P-GQDs showed an intensified amorphous graphene structure with respect to the undoped GQDs.47

2.3.1.3 Sulfur doping. In the case of the sulfur atom, it is also larger than carbon. Thus similar to P substitution in CDs, the geometry of the S atom tends to protrude out of the carbon lattice. Compared to N doping, the S dopant can also serve as an electron donor but exhibits a different ability of modulating the electronic density of states.110 As shown in Fig. 9, the electronegativity difference between C (2.55) and S (2.58) can almost be neglected and a distinctive mismatch feature of the outmost orbits of the S atom exists. Correspondingly, the mediocre charge transfer in C–S composites presents a big hurdle to introduce S into the framework of CDs.123–125 To tackle this challenge, Li's team proposed one-step electrolysis of graphite in sodium p-toluenesulfonate solution to form sulfur-doped graphene quantum dots (SGQDs). In this method, the graphite rod as a working electrode was inserted into sodium ptoluenesulfonate solution. The selection of the electrolysis voltage setting at 5 V is crucial, for which the CC bonds can be efficiently oxidized and the electrolyte ions can readily intercalate into the framework of GQDs.109 In an advance, the novel micelle-assisted method was applied to create S-doped CQDs (S-CQDs) by Kwon et al. During the preparatory stage, a solution of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate sodium salt (AOT) in decane was obtained after degassing in a reaction flask. Subsequently, a mixed solution of glucose and thioglycolic acid as the S precursor was injected into the flask with intense stirring. After the solution became transparent, it means reverse micelles formed. Then excess hexadecylamine as a passivation agent was added into the reaction flask with heating at 160 °C under argon flow for 2 h. The core growth of the colloidal S-CQDs was capped by hexadecylamine with the formation of amides.61 This method can help to control the size distribution of CDs. Later on, Li et al. proposed a facile method to produce S-GQDs by hydrothermal treatment of fructose and sulphuric acid at 170 °C for 4 h. The S-GQDs showed multiple PL emission peaks and wide emission tunability from blue to red, covering the majority of colors in the visible range (Fig. 12).89 On account of hydrothermal synthesis, a series of work on S doped CDs was developed with diverse applications (also shown in Table 1), e.g. Fe(III) detection (QY: 67% and 32%, respectively),126 ammonia sensing,127 pH detection,86 and photocatalysts for hydrogen generation.125

Recently, to ensure the doping efficiency, Do and co-workers adopted a single molecule: 2,2′-(ethylenedithio)diacetic acid (ETDA) as the S source to synthesize sulfur-doped CNDs (S-CNDs) by a solvothermal method. The sulfur source was firstly mixed with water and subsequently transferred into an oil phase composed of oleylamine and octadecene. The solution was strongly agitated under an Ar gas environment until it became a milky emulsion, which was then pyrolyzed at 250 °C for 2 h to form the S-CNDs. This work was also extended to prepare N-doped CNDs and bare CNDs by just replacing the raw material with ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (EDDA) and citric acid separately. The QY of S-CNDs, N-doped CNDs and bare CNDs was 6.48%, 11.51%, and 69.87%, respectively. It was indicated that heteroatom doping did not always guarantee a positive impact on the improvement of PL, to some extent, it depended on the synthetic designs.45 Through screening of the aforementioned synthesis methods (shown in Table 1), we can discover that some extent of deficiency exists in some aspects, such as, complex synthetic procedures and/or long reaction time. To improve these weaknesses, Hu and coworkers reported a 5 min acid treatment of waste frying oil (WFO) with concentrated sulfuric acid to obtain sulfur doped carbon dots (S–C-dots). The carbonization process of WFO was maintained at 100 °C for 5 min with concentrated sulfuric acid (98%). The S–C-dots show a monodisperse feature with a narrow size distribution and were successfully applied to cell imaging.128 Gao et al. presented a green, low-cost approach employing co-combustion of a liquid mixture of paraffin oil and carbon disulphide (CS2) as a S source to fabricate S-GQDs (Fig. 13). Here, the paraffin liquid has two functions: (1) it serves as a carbon precursor; and (2) it supplies energy to sustain the combustion.129

2.3.2 P-Type doping. 
2.3.2.1 Boron doping. P-Type doping, through which the chemical and electronic properties of carbon can be altered on the basis of interactions between impurities (atoms and molecules) and the carbon cores, acts as electron acceptors or hole donors.130 In contrast to N-type doping, the P-type doping effect is the exact opposite due to the generation of mobile positive charges (holes). The B atom as a typical P-type candidate with a similar size to carbon has been extensively exploited in semiconductors. The representative B doping synthesis is to use diborane (B2H6) vapor to diffuse boron into the silicon material.131 Inspired by this, Dey et al. introduced arc discharge combined with chemical scissoring of graphene to form B-doped graphene quantum dots (B-GQDs). More precisely, the first step was to prepare the B-doped graphene using arc discharge on graphite in the atmosphere of H2, He and B2H6 vapor. Then the B-GQDs can be acquired after prolonged chemical scissoring of the B doped graphene, i.e., transforming this B-doped graphene to graphene oxide by a modified Hummers method, followed by thermal deoxidization and finally cutting into the B-GQDs by ultrasonication in a concentrated strong acid mixture. This method was also applied to synthesize N-doped GQDs. Both the B-GQDs and N-doped GQDs showed excellent UCPL emission.132 In the same year, Yang's group reported B-GQDs with rich PL properties through an electrochemical synthesis approach. The electrochemical parameters required a graphite rod anode inserted in the 0.1 M borax (Na2B4O7) aqueous solution and the Pt cathode potential set at 3.0 V to impel the electrolyte ions onto the carbon surface and then oxidize the C–C bonds. The medium (borax) strongly influenced the PL properties of the formed B-GQDs. In the presence of borax, the B-GQD solution showed excitation-independent PL with a QY of 13%. In contrast, the pure B-GQD solution presented excitation-dependent PL with a low QY of 3.6%. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that a coordinate bond formed between the O atom connected to sp3 B atoms in Na2B4O7 and the B atom of the CB bond in B-GQDs gave rise to the PL properties of B-GQDs in a borax medium.133 In addition, the modified electrolytic exfoliation synthesis of B-GQDs was recently developed by Zhang et al. using a boron doped graphene rod and a graphite rod as the anode and the cathode, respectively.134As mentioned above, a microwave approach can make CDs rapidly. Hai et al. developed B-GQDs with a high QY of 21.1% via a microwave irradiation process with GO in Na2B4O7 solution. The preparation (illustrated in Fig. 14) indicated that three forms of B atoms were conjugated into the GQD backbone by attacking defects, i.e., a B-sub-C bond formed by the restoration of the hexatomic ring that constituted BC2O and BCO2 by the interaction between B atoms and epoxy –CO groups. The B-GQDs maintained a stable PL response in a wide pH distribution of 3.0–11.0.135 Analogously, Zboril's group applied microwave heating to treat a boric acid and urea mixture with the formation of boron-doped C-dots (CBU dots). The nonlinear optical response of CBU dots was enhanced significantly with respect to the undoped CDs.136 Later on, Nanda's team obtained boron-doped carbon nanoparticles (B-CNPs) by hydrothermal treatment of a mixture of boric acid and sucrose. Through investigating the influence of heating time and dilution on PL properties of the B-CNPs, it was revealed that the PL spectra were red-shifted with the increase of heating time, while a blue shift in the PL spectra took place with the dilution ratio increase. The explanation for the former phenomenon was ascribed to the size effect exceeding the effect of B doping (blue shift). As for the latter, the decreased interparticle distances accounted for it.137 It is worth mentioning that B-doped CDs seem to take on excitation-independent PL character (Table 1), of which the mechanisms need to be further exploited.

2.3.3 Co-Doping. 
N,S co-doping. Dong et al. employed a one-step hydrothermal process with a mixed solution of CA monohydrate and L-cysteine to form N and S co-doped CDs (N,S-CDs).88 The mixed solution was firstly evaporated at 70 °C until it dried to get a thick syrup. It was then heated hydrothermally at 200 °C for 3 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave. Owing to the synergetic effect of the doped N and S atoms, the resultant N,S-CDs displayed excitation-independent PL behavior and a pronounced QY (70% at least). In the same year, Zhu's group exhibited green, massive production of S- and N-co-doped carbon dots (S–N–C-dots) through both H2SO4 carbonization and etching on hair fibers. As shown in Fig. 15, with the increase of reaction temperature, the S content rose simultaneously while the N content remained almost invariable. This enabled the reaction temperature to tune the down-conversion and UCPL properties of the S–N–C-dots.138 Combined with a hydrothermal method, Zhang's group developed S,N co-doped GQDs (S,N:GQDs) by processing a mixture of CA and thiourea at 160 °C for 3 h. The intensified QY (71%) of S,N:GQDs was confirmed to be related to the doped N and S atoms. According to the Yu's report, the typical excitation-independent PL phenomenon was found to be determined by the uniform surface states instead of the size of S,N co-doped CDs.88 In contrast, the difference here was that both the uniform surface state and size took charge in the observed excitation-independent PL feature of synthesized S,N:GQDs. Importantly, the wide absorption in the visible region enabled S,N:GQDs to be applied in energy conversion.50 With the similar synthetic method to Zhang's group, the S,N doped CDs (S,N-CDs) created by Miao et al. showed red emission at long wavelength excitation.139

N,P co-doping. Barman and co-workers synthesized a series of heteroatom doped CDs including N-doped, (N,P) co-doped, and (N,B) co-doped CDs by a hydrothermal process. Firstly, they pyrolyzed CA and diethylenetriamine (DETA) hydrothermally to get N-doped CDs at 170 °C for 1 h. Then the (N,P) co-doped and (N,B) co-doped CDs were acquired with the similar synthetic routine via introducing ortho-phosphoric acid (o-PA) as a P precursor and boric acid (BA) as a B precursor dopant, respectively.40 From a convenient, economical, and green perspective, Gong et al. proposed an acidic oxidation of pumpkin to prepare phosphorous and nitrogen co-doped carbon dots (P,N-CDs) under heating at 90 °C for 1 h. The P,N-CDs with a QY of 9.7% exhibited a strong yellow luminescence and can be applied to in vitro and in vivo cell labelling.140 With a traditionally hydrothermal treatment of glucose, ammonia, and phosphoric acid, Shi et al. yielded (nitrogen and phosphorus) co-doped carbon nanodots (N,P-CDs) with a high QY of 30%. Compared with naked CDs, the introduction of N and P impurities dramatically enhanced the electronic properties and surface chemical reactivities of the N,P-CDs.141 In another work conducted by Shangguan et al. N/P co-doped carbon dots were synthesized with single adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) molecules as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus sources. As demonstrated in Fig. 16, the N/P co-doped carbon dots possessed a high affinity to Fe3+ with an impressively high QY of 43.2%.142

N,B co-doping. In 2013, Kanwal's group firstly developed highly photoactive boron/nitrogen co-doped carbon nanodots (CNDs). Initially, the boric acid was mixed with N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)glycine and then hydrothermally processed at 300 °C under inert atmosphere to acquire CNDs. Afterwards, PEI as a passivation agent was introduced to passivate the formed CNDs through EDC/NHS chemistry with the resultants denoted as P-CNDs. The surface passivation treatment endowed the P-CNDs with high fluorescence with a QY of 23.71% and monodisperse features.143 Recently, Liu et al. reported multifunctional B,N codoped carbon dots (B/N-C-dots) derived from a hydrothermal process with a mixture of branched polyethylenimine and 4-formylphenylboronic acid. Interestingly, except for the application of Fe3+ sensing and cell labelling, the B/N-C-dots with a QY of 15.85% had a duplex response to temperature (27–90 °C) and pH (3–13). The pH-responsive property could be attributed to the surface functional group (carboxyl and amino) induced states changing by a protonation–deprotonation effect. Meanwhile, the temperature-dependent character might arise from the nonradiative process of surface (trap/defect) states.144 In addition, Kim's group reported a one-step, scalable synthesis of boron-and-nitrogen-doped CDs (BN-CDs) by microwave pyrolysis of the mixture of CA, boric acid as a B source, and EDA as a nitrogen precursor as well as a surface-passivation agent (Fig. 17). The excitation-independent PL properties of the BN-CDs stemmed from the surface states instead of the quantum confinement effect. The increased number of emitted photons per particle was the origin of the ultrahigh QY (80.8 ± 5.1%) of the BN-CDs.95 Microwave heating was also reported by Bain et al. to obtain boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon dots (BNCDs).145

Other co-doping. To exploit diverse structure characters and properties (electron transfer and broadband light-absorbing) between CDs and different dopants, Zeng's group introduced the chelation reaction between EDTA with Cu ions to form a saturated Schiff-base-like planar structure, i.e., CuII (Na2[Cu–(EDTA)]) (Fig. 18A). It is noteworthy that the planar structure of CuII (Na2[Cu–(EDTA)]) favored the formation of a flaky graphite conductive structure during the pyrolysis at 250 °C, which was highly beneficial to improve the photocatalytic ability. The characteristic data confirmed that the Cu content of the resultant Cu–N-doped CDs (Cu-CDs) strongly depended on the thermolysis temperature. The Cu doping enabled the Cu-CDs to have outstanding electron-transfer properties and photocatalytic efficiency (increased 3.5 fold) compared to undoped CDs, i.e., enhanced electron-accepting and -donating abilities by 2.5 and 1.5 times, the electric conductivity increased to 171.8 μs cm−1.51 A one-pot hydrothermal method was subsequently applied to synthesize N, Cu codoped carbon dots (N/Cu-CDs) by Ma and coworkers. The formed N/Cu-CDs displayed a high QY (50.1%) and excitation-independent emission after treating the starting materials of CA monohydrate, copper acetate monohydrate, and DETA.146 Recently, a novel, scalable, rapid synthesis of S,N,F co-doped GQDs by microwave treatment of CNTs in an ionic liquid was reported by Pillai's group. As illustrated in Fig. 18B, the monodisperse S,N,F co-doped GQDs showed a high QY of 70% and enhanced charge transfer,147 leading to a boosted energy conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized solar batteries.148 On the basis of hydrothermal treatment, Chen's group developed red emission B,N,S-co-doped CDs with colorimetric and fluorescent bimodal sensing of Fe3+ in both intricate biological fluids and living cells.149 Dong's group presented N,S,P co-doped CNDs prepared from a waste microorganism with applications for label-free detection of manganese(VII), L-AA and “AND” logic gate operation.70

3. The mechanisms of tuning the photoluminescence of carbon dots
Even though the photoluminescence of CDs has been extensively studied, there still remain several elusive issues to be systemically researched and summarized, such as the origin of the PL. As mentioned in “Section 1” and “2”, it is clear that synthetic methods dominate the physical, chemical and electronic structures of CDs, inducing the PL of CDs. However, the interaction relation between those structures and PL needs to be clarified further. To synthesize CDs, methods can be classified into two well-known categories. One is “top-down” methods where CDs are formed or are a “cutting” from a larger carbonic material, such as graphite, graphene, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, nanofibers, and diamond. The different intrinsic structures and surface chemical groups (oxygen/nitrogen-based groups) between these carbon materials determine the fundamentals of the PL of the CDs. However, the perfect sp2 carbon structure and the lack of a band gap preclude the utilization of PL properties in these carbon materials.16,150,151 As an alternative, spatially confined graphitized carbon structures, i.e., CDs, have imparted great promise to open the band gap of these fluorescent-free materials.152,153 Research results have demonstrated that isolated sp2 domains embedded in a sp3 matrix are the origin of PL, a feature that is connected with the π states of sp2 sites.85 The reason for this is that isolated sp2-hybridized domains yield suitable band gaps, and this then leads to a broad emission wavelength from UV to near infrared fluorescence through e–h emissive recombination. Additionally, a common, cost-effective, and easy-to-handle method used for synthesizing CDs from small organic molecules and polymers using a dehydration reaction is referred to in a series of papers as the “bottom-up” method.1,5,6,16 These small molecules and polymers, such as phenylboronic acid,154 tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane,58 glycine,59 and branched polyethyleneimine,155 are always populated with –COOH, –OH, and –NH2 groups, and they almost always don’t contain a nanocrystalline core featuring graphitic sp2 carbon atoms. Therefore, engineering the ratio of the sp2 and sp3 fractions using elaborate syntheses techniques can be a fundamental way to tune a CD's band gap, shaping the PL properties of the CDs. With the evolution of CDs, theories regarding the origin of PL also gradually matured. Compared with the PL mechanisms in typical organic and inorganicluminescent materials, the established PL mechanisms in CDs are still ill-defined owing to the multi-exponential PL decay lifetimes (see Table 1). However, among all the theories to date, two mainstream overviews have been adopted: (1) intrinsic state emission (the quantum confinement effect,32,64,85,91,156 and electron–hole radiative recombination: highly populated subdomains,151 and core state35) and (2) defective state emission (surface states (defect state, edge state,38 and molecule state),5,34,94,144,157,158 and surface energy traps (emissive trap sites)10). Next, we will discuss PL mechanism insights that integrate chemical and electronic structure alteration during the synthesis (related to SPF and doping) of CDs.
3.1 Quantum confinement effect
A series of theoretical calculations have demonstrated the relationship between PL emission and sp2-domain size.64,85,156 It is worth mentioning that the size of sp2-domains is the main controlling factor of the quantum confinement effect, though the particle size seemingly shows a similar algebraic relation with the PL emission. As shown in Fig. 19a, the PL properties of an electrolyzed CD vary steeply with the CD's size. Theoretical simulations reveal that the HOMO–LUMO gap shows an identical variation trend with an increase in sp2-fragment size (Fig. 19b). This means that the PL emission derives from the quantum-sized graphite fragment of the CDs.64 Gaussian and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations have been tested and confirmed that the smaller size (∼3 nm) of sp2 clusters of a few aromatic rings accounted for the blue PL emission from reduced GO sheets (Fig. 19c).85 Inspired by this work, further systematic theoretical research has indicated that the tunable emission of GQDs can be shifted with sp2 hybridized domain size, edge configuration (blue shift), shape, chemical functionalities (red shift), defects (red shift), and heterogeneously hybridized carbon frameworks. To be more specific with regards to size, the emission wavelength covers the full visible light spectrum from 400 to 770 nm and is correlated to the zigzag-edged GQD size rise from 0.89 to 1.80 nm (Fig. 19d). Moreover, different edge configurations in the GQDs showed various quantum confinement properties. The localized states on the zigzag edges endow the zigzag-edged GQDs with a lower energy gap than the armchair-edged counterparts.156

3.2 Electron–hole radiative recombination
In Li's work, it was verified that in the prepared S doped GQDs, CC was the main bonding configuration that formed the graphitic matrix structure. The XPS, FTIR, and Raman data also confirmed the presence of C–OH, C–O–C, C–S, CO, and CS groups in S-GQDs, and that hiophene-S and oxide-S constituted the configuration of doped sulphur with a 1% atomic ratio. The effect of S doping on the electronic structure of GQDs was investigated using PL spectra and UV-vis absorption. In contrast with the two absorption peaks of bare GQDs, the S-GQDs displayed five absorption peaks and five PL peaks, indicating the emergence of additional electronic transition paths in the electronic configuration of CDs upon doping with S impurities. Hence, the multipath model of electronic transitions has been proposed in the S-doped GQDs (Fig. 20A) indicated by the absorption wavelengths of 216 nm, 267 nm, 346 nm, 405 nm, and 464 nm corresponding to the photon energies of 5.7 eV, 4.6 eV, 3.6 eV, 3.1 eV, and 2.7 eV, respectively, for which S-doping provided an energy level between π and π* and caused radiative recombination after vibration relaxation and inter-band crossing.89 Inspired by Li's findings, Rhee's group further developed the PL mechanisms of S/N doped CNDs using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and a Kelvin probe.45 A detailed characterization showed that the amorphousness degree of amorphous S-/N-CNDs using the solvothermal method was augmented using heteroatom doping, and the conjugation of non-bonding (n) orbitals of N or S with the π* orbitals of the sp2 clusters within the sp3 matrix of the CDs perhaps lowered the energy gap, leading to a red shift of excitation and emission peak positions. Due to the lower electronegativity of N as compared to S, the red-shifted PL performance of the S-CNDs was relatively prominent compared to the N-CNDs. Furthermore, the broadened PL spectra of the S-/N-CNDs as compared to bare CNDs should be ascribed to certain defective sites that caused dissipation of the photo-induced excitons to lower energy levels in S-/N-CNDs. According to the configurations of the Fermi level of an organic semiconductor, the explanation for the PL mechanism can be illustrated as in Fig. 20B. When examining the emerged energy levels in doped CDs, the O, N, and S states linked with the π* orbitals of carbon–oxygen, carbon–nitrogen, and carbon–sulfur double bonds can possibly collude to narrow the HOMO–LUMO gap, and this phenomenon might be influenced by the non-bonding orbitals of the carbon–oxygen, carbon–nitrogen, and carbon–sulfur double bonds and π* orbitals of the carbon–carbon double bonds.89 When the electrons are excited in the HOMO, a majority of the excitons jump to a corresponding energy state by dissipation or phonon generation. Then the emissive recombination between electrons in each state and the corresponding holes in the HOMO would be responsible for the PL emission. Similar findings were also confirmed by Sun's group.76 Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) revealed that oxygen concentrations had a strong influence on the optical properties produced from the creation of extrinsic states, and a suitable oxygen concentration is needed for the formation of highly populated PL emission sites (subdomains) determined by the synthetic conditions. The PL emission yield of three types of CDs processed using acidic oxidation and thermal reduction, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the intrinsic PL emission of the GQDs originated from the subdomains, and it was not a physical size effect.151

3.3 Surface state/surface energy traps (emissive trap states: ETSs)
In Tang's work that used a combined microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, the FTIR and XPS data clearly demonstrated that self-passivated GQDs composed of sp3 (C–C, C–H) and emerging sp2 (CC) hybrids, also had C–OH, C–O–C, and CO groups, which are the energy levels between the π and π* states of CC. According to the energy levels of absorption and emission transitions of the GQDs, the surface state energy level was deduced to be ∼1.0 eV from the energy gap between the intrinsic absorption energy and the surface state absorption energy, or the energy gap between the intrinsic emission and surface state emission, as shown in Fig. 21A. Due to the independence of size of both absorption and emission features of synthesized GQDs, the emissive traps originated from surface states of the functional groups, which dominated the GQD emission.75 In another hydrothermal report, Yu's group produced highly crystalline N,S-CDs with an intensity ratio of the D band and the G band (ID/IG) of approximately 0.5. The excitation-independent FL behavior showed by N,S-CDs was proven to be connected with the uniform surface states of the N,S-CDs, rather than the size of the CDs. To explain the PL mechanism caused by N,S-co doping, the same synthetic route was applied to introduce the control groups, i.e., O-CDs (CDs with rich oxygen-containing groups arising from CA as the only precursor, QY: 5.3%) and N-CDs (N-doped CDs with CA and glycine as precursors, QY: 16.9%). The difference in the PL properties indicated that S impurities boosted the PL performance and both N-CDs and N,S-CDs showed the same PL origin distinct from O-CDs. A possible mechanism model is illustrated in Fig. 21B. As for the O-CDs, abundant oxygen impurities created a large number of surface states (O states) that corresponded with a wide, close collection of diverse energy levels that accounted for the broad absorption band and wide, excitation-dependent emission spectra. In the case of N-CDs, a new kind of surface state (N state) stemming from N doping improved the yield of radiative recombination, as it enhanced QY more than in the O-CDs. The nearly equivalent density in both O states and the N state may be responsible for the wide, excitation-dependent FL spectra of the N-CDs. In the case of the N,S-CDs, the regulation of the ratio of the N state and O states brought about by decreasing the usage of L-cysteine seems to indicate that S doping can remove the O-states and motivate the N-state, thus causing the high QY (>70%).88 The levels of oxidation and defect states in CDs are two necessary elements to consider in the formation of both subdomains and defect-related extrinsic states.

3.4 Others
Patra's group reported on the photophysical properties (radiative decay rate (RDT) and average decay time (ADT)) of doped carbon dots with impurity atoms of N, B, and P (N-, (N,P) co-, and (N,B) co-doped CDs) using steady state and time-resolved spectroscopic (TR) investigation. The C1s spectra in XPS revealed the existence of a C atom whose form in these synthesized CDs was mainly composed of graphitic sp2 C with a minority of sp3 structure. The steady state spectroscopic analyses indicated that the P dopant increased the QY of N-doped CDs (64%) to 70% ((N,P) co-doped CDs), while the B impurity reduced it to 39% ((N,B) co-doped CDs). Moreover, TR investigations indicated that n-type doping (P doping) was inclined to the radiative relaxation pathway that fundamentally affects ADT and fluorescence quantum yield. Conversely, P-type doping (B doping) was prone to non-radiative e–h recombination routes that resulted in a decrease in RDT, ADT, and fluorescence quantum yield. With the purpose of grasping the relationship between dopants and the charge transfer dynamics in doped CDs (Fig. 22), the prepared doped CDs were attached on the surface of Ni(II) phthalocyanine (PC) using the electrostatic interaction between them. Time resolved emission decay showed that n-type doping based on N-doped CDs facilitated the e transport course, while p-type doping hampered the e transport course (faster process) and favored the h transport course (slower process) from CDs to PC.40

4. Summary and outlook
With regard to the physical structure of CDs, (a) SPF treated CDs showed almost no deviation in size distribution and degree of crystallinity in comparison to bare CDs; (b) however, the crystallinity of majorly doped CDs decreased (Table 1), commonly in correlation with enhanced surface defects and a broadened size distribution. From the perspective of chemical structure, (i) the SPF strategy can be regarded as a type of surface modification that mainly alters the chemical discontinuity on the surface of the CD via functional group capping; (ii) the heteroatom doping mode can roughly be classified as an atomic substitution in the carbon core, intercalation, and surface replacement. This provides very flexible paths to modulate the electronic configurations. With respect to the electronic structure, (1) SPF introduces rich functional groups onto the surface of CDs without changing their original size, which constructs surface defect states induced by functional groups. However, excess oxygen-containing groups can facilitate non-radiative recombination emission leading to low QY. (2) Electronegativity of the electronic structure depends on the diversity of dopants. Heteroatom doping can modulate the width of the band gap of CDs by adding new electronic energy states that correspond to the dopant. As a result, the emerging PL properties of undoped CDs are consistent with doping-induced intrinsic state emission. The increased amorphous structure in doped CDs (see Table 1) will promote more defect-based state emission. Both of them are responsible for tunable PL properties.
To date, tremendous work on the syntheses, application, and PL mechanism explorations of CDs has been accomplished, but barely any clear-cut synthesis protocols have been established for creating size, crystallinity, and morphology controlled CDs with well-defined chemical identities, like a semiconductor fabrication process. This may be primarily due to intrinsic factors, such as (1) interdependency and activeness between carbon and oxygen atoms that determine the intrinsic emission states in CDs, (2) the intermediates (radicals) associated with the formation of surface states in CDs, and (3) the vulnerable sensibility of carbon cores that are reactive with environmental parameters (pH, ionic strength, and temperature) that dominate the crystallinity of the resultants. These factors are hard to harness using traditional synthetic methods compared to semiconductor technology. Regarding the developed synthesis approaches (Table 1), the final resultants are not well matched with the target (especially the crystallinity), which is needed to prepare metal nanoparticles. It would be progress to discard the traditional synthetic routines used to make one- or two-dimensional nanomaterials with predictable profile characters, like carbon nanohorns, carbon nanodiamonds, perovskite, and others. A novel multistep integrated synthesis might be the new path for the development of fine structural CDs. In this regard, some elaborate designs have been developed to achieve high performance of CDs that involve the control of the molar ratio of the raw materials (CA/urea), the reaction temperature, and the ionic strength and medium pH.34 However, the precise chemical configurations, particularly the relationship of the formation mechanisms of CDs and alterative synthesis temperatures, need to be elucidated. This problem might be tackled by the hypothesis formed in the summary of Section 2, i.e., the exploitation of solvothermal carbonization, templated carbonization, and electrolysis with well-rounded experimental investigations. To underpin the hypothesis, a solvothermal synthesis route for CDs exhibits tunable emission PL obtained by the manipulation of the ratios of CA/urea and reaction temperature. Higher molar ratios of CA/urea and higher reaction temperatures contribute to increased graphitization, which means an extended effective conjugation length or large sp2 cluster, and an increase in the content of carboxyl in CDs, leading to a red shift in emission.159 In the future, we envision that combined synthetic methods, such as solvothermal carbonization with templated carbonization or solvothermal carbonization with electrolysis, could be promising procedures for CD synthesis due to their inherent complementarily advantages. In addition, the lack of persistent systemic explorations of the analysis of the relationship between structure and performance hinders deep insights into the essential issues mentioned above. Overall, an accurate understanding of the variations in the physical, chemical, and electrical transformations during and after synthesis can provide relevance to PL properties.
