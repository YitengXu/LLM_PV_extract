    , Accepted 17th May 2018First published on 18th May 2018AbstractWe present the identification of crystalline phases by in situ X-ray diffraction during growth and monitor the phase evolution during subsequent thermal treatment of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskite thin films. The thin films are prepared by vacuum-based two-source co-evaporation using various methyl ammonium (MA) halide and lead halide (PbX2) precursors. The single halide perovskite materials MAPbI3, MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 are prepared without secondary phases and an upper thermal limit for decomposition into the corresponding lead halides is established. We show that at a substrate temperature of 120 °C, the halide in MAPbI3/MAPbBr3 thin films can be completely and reversibly exchanged upon exposure to the opposite MA halide. We monitor the temporal evolution of the conversion process in situ and discuss differences in the forward and backward conversion. For the deposition of mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 perovskite thin films, different growth routes are suggested and evaluated in terms of growth with single phases or phase segregations. Our results are discussed in a broader context considering I/Br miscibility. Finally we propose a new growth route for the synthesizes of single phase mixed MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 thin films in the range from x = 0.3 to 1 by two source co-evaporation and discuss the implication of our results.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites for solar cells
Research on photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion has been shaken in the last few years by the appearance of a new class of absorber materials called perovskites. These new hybrid organic–inorganic compounds where first explored as light harvesters in 2009 (ref. 1) and gained exponentially increasing interest during the last five years since their first successful application in 2012 with efficiencies exceeding 10%.2,3 Currently, the best cell efficiencies have well surpassed 20%,4,5 putting them on the same performance level as the best conventional polycrystalline PV technologies such as polycrystalline Si, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 or CdTe.
The remarkable optoelectronic properties of thin film solar cells such as strong photoluminescence and long charge carrier diffusion lengths (>1 μm),6,7 the possibility to apply simple and cheap non-vacuum-based deposition techniques (e.g. spin coating) and a tuneable band gap suitable for both single junction and tandem applications have further boosted scientific and industrial interest. While the race to highest efficiency solar cells is extremely fast and successful, reports about the intrinsic instability of hybrid halide perovskite materials when exposed to moderate levels of heat,8,9 moisture10 and even light11,12 currently are an obstacle to industrial considerations.13–15 This also severely limits the reproducibility of experimental results, especially because many of the fundamental properties have been reported for wet-chemical processes which depend critically on air exposure times, ambient conditions, surface conditioning and quality of solvents, precursors and substrates. It is therefore not an easy task to derive more general conclusions about this material class and there is still a strong need for further fundamental characterisation under very well-defined conditions.
Wet-chemical methodologies such as spin-coating allow very fast progress and high sampling rates on a laboratory scale and have up to now been applied in the grand majority of publications. However, we believe that vacuum-based technologies such as co-evaporation should not be ignored, as they allow precise parameter control, better reproducibility and fast processing on very large areas, which makes them attractive from a large-scale industrial point of view. Several groups have already successfully deposited MAPbI3 thin films by two source co-evaporation16,17 yielding working solar cells with efficiencies of up to 15%.18,19 The two-source co-evaporation allowed dense planar films with large crystals to grow, where the thickness variations were much smaller as compared to solution-coated films.18 Additional intrinsic advantages of the co-evaporation technique over solution-based preparation are the ability to grow films with arbitrary thicknesses and the avoidance of toxic solvents. We follow this approach and report here on our progress in understanding the fundamental phase formation and decomposition mechanisms of perovskite thin films synthesized by co-evaporation of MAX and PbX2 (X = I, Br, Cl) precursors investigated in situ by X-ray diffraction (XRD).
It is well known and has been extensively reported that MAPI3 decomposes easily under thermal stress and/or exposure to air/humidity.14,20,21 However, the rate of decomposition and the degree of instability is not well established and seems to be strongly related to the deposition pathway. More information on the intrinsic thermal stability of MAPbX3 is therefore desirable. Furthermore, the air exposure time of grown films between synthesis and measurement (and relative humidity levels) is crucial for every decomposition analysis and is unfortunately usually not detailed. It is clear that if thin films had ever been exposed to air/humidity prior to any stability analysis, some moisture is likely to have soaked into the films. This will lead to a slow decomposition over a long time even if effective air exposure times have been kept short and the actual stability analysis afterwards is carried out under dry conditions. We find it therefore important to note that in contrast to most ex situ measurements, films in our experiments have not been exposed to air or humidity at any point during the investigation, which enables us to explore the fundamental thermal stability of unexposed perovskite films.
The prototype of the perovskite absorber material applied in solar cells is based on organic–inorganic methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3). The most common variations and combinations of constituents are substitution of methyl ammonium (MA) by formamidinium (FA) and Cs or (partial) substitution of the iodine by Br or Cl. MAPbI3 has a band gap of 1.51 eV,22 suitable for single-junction photovoltaic applications. Following the line I–Br–Cl, as the ionic radius decreases, the Pb–X bond strength increases23 and consequently the band gap of the material is also increased (see Table 1). The analogous perovskite with bromine, MAPbBr3, has a band gap of 2.42 eV,24 which is suitable for light emitting diodes, but in principle too high for efficient solar energy harvesting. MAPbCl3 shows an even higher band gap of 3.16 eV.

A clear advantage of hybrid lead halides is the possibility to tune the bandgap by intermixing some of the perovskite components. As for the mixed halide MAPbX3 perovskites, there is consensus that the MAPbBr3–MAPbCl3 system is completely miscible,25–27 while the MAPbI3–MAPbCl3 is not because the difference of the atomic radii is too large.26,28 The mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 system allows band gaps interesting for tandem solar cell applications but the miscibility is still under debate.29 While Bolink and co-workers have reported a sequential evaporation–conversion process,30 up to our knowledge the deposition of mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 thin films by co-evaporation from two sources has not been reported so far.
In our contribution we explore the possibility to control the growth of single phase perovskite thin films by two-source co-evaporation under high vacuum conditions. We focus on the most widely used methyl ammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3 with X = I, Br, and Cl). Firstly, we will investigate the growth mechanisms of the single halide perovskites and introduce the working principle and potential of our specialized in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) setup. We continue studying in detail the behaviour of the grown MAPbX3 thin films under thermal stress and monitor their decomposition routes.
We will then concentrate on the mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 system, which is the most relevant one for photovoltaic applications. Here, we first investigate in situ the exchange of the halide anions in grown films and the conversion of MAPbI3 into MAPbBr3 and vice versa. Finally, the potential of different growth routes to prepare mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 thin films using static two-source co-evaporation will be evaluated and the best growth route to obtain single phase material is identified.
Crystal structure of methyl ammonium lead halides (MAPbX3, X = I, Br, Cl)
The ideal cubic crystal structure with the space group Pm3m (no. 221) and sum formula ABX3 is the aristotype for the group of materials called perovskites.22 A sketch of the crystal structure is depicted in Fig. 1. In these materials, a large cation A is located at the Wyckoff position 1a coordinated to 12 X anions (position 3c). The position of the large cation A can be occupied not only by a large ion such as Ca or Cs, but also by small molecules such as methyl ammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA) as in MAPbX3. B is usually a smaller metal (position 1c) which is bonded to six X anions forming a dense framework of corner sharing octahedra. The larger A cations are located in the voids between these octahedra. The A and B cations and the X anions can come with different atomic radii RA, RB, and RX which predict the stability of a perovskite according to the Goldschmidt equation:31  Here t is the tolerance factor which should lie between 0.9 and 1 for the ideal cubic structure. A non-ideal proportion of the A, B, and X atomic radii results in a distortion of the crystal structure where the B–X octahedra get tilted and form hettotypes with lower symmetry.32 Usually, the high temperature α-phase of perovskites crystallizes in the ideal cubic structure, as is the case for the three lead halide perovskites MAPbI3, MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3. Upon cooling, they undergo subsequent phase transitions towards one or several tetragonal β- and orthorhombic γ-phases with lowered symmetry. These polymorphs differ in the tilt and rotation of the PbX6 octahedra.22,33,34
 Fig. 1  Above: Sketch of the perovskite crystal structure for materials with the sum formula ABX3. Note that in this presentation the atoms are displayed smaller corresponding to their atomic radii for better visualization. Below: Presentation of MAPbCl3 with properly scaled atomic radii. 
The crystal structure and phase transitions of MAPbX3 perovskites have been studied extensively.22,35,36 At 343 K, MAPbI3 has the ideal cubic perovskite structure with the space group Pm3m and lattice parameter a = 6.276 Å.22 The transition from the high temperature cubic α-phase to the tetragonal β-phase with the space group I4/mcm takes place at 327–330 K,22 followed by a transition towards the orthorhombic γ-MAPbI3 with the space group Pnma at approximately 162 K. Similar transitions are observed for MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3. MAPbBr3 has a cubic crystal structure at room temperature (a = 5.901 Å)36 and transforms into a tetragonal structure below 236.6 K.35 Two different tetragonal configurations are reported for this compound and an orthorhombic γ-configuration is found for temperatures below 148.8 K. For MAPbCl3, two different orthorhombic configurations have been found at low temperatures.37 The transition temperatures of the cubic MAPbX3 perovskites (X = I, Br, Cl) are listed together with other important crystallographic data in Table 1. Here, the Goldschmidt tolerance factors have been calculated with ionic radii provided by Shannon for the inorganic ions (Pb: 1.19 Å)38 and an estimated effective radius of 2.17 Å for the protonated methyl ammonium [CH3NH3]+ as reported by Kieslich and co-workers.32 From the transition temperatures it is clear that at room temperature only MAPbI3 adopts a tetragonal crystal structure, while the other two compounds are already in the high temperature cubic α-phase. An indication of the decomposition temperature as determined and described later on in this manuscript is added to a schematic representation of the phase transitions in Fig. 6.
Experimental in situ XRD monitoring and thin film co-evaporation setup
The growth of MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) by co-evaporation in a vacuum can be achieved by evaporating the corresponding methyl ammonium halides (MAX) and the lead halide (PbX2) simultaneously. In the following, we will show that the synthesis of thin films with this method is straightforward and use it as an example to introduce the capability to monitor thin films in situ by X-ray diffraction with the setup installed in our co-evaporation chamber. The chamber is usually operated at a base pressure of 2 × 10−5 mbar. The MAX crucible temperature is set in the temperature range between 110 °C and 130 °C, while the PbX2 evaporation sources are operated at slightly higher temperatures (PbI2: 300 °C; PbBr2: 300 °C; PbCl2: 350 °C). During MAX evaporation, the chamber pressure usually increases to values around (5.0–10.0) × 10−4 mbar. The substrate is made of standard soda lime glass and, is usually not actively heating during the growth of the perovskite thin films. The thin film thickness can be monitored by the interferences of scattered laser light signals (650 nm and 1550 nm) and a quartz microbalance. If not stated otherwise, thin films in the following experiments had thicknesses between 500 and 700 nm. An entrance and exit window placed at opposing sides of the chamber allow the X-ray beam to enter and leave the chamber. These windows are freshly covered with Kapton tape before each process. The X-ray system is operated with a Cu Kα source at a fixed incident angle and a position-sensitive X-ray detector covering an angular 2Θ-range of approximately 12–40°. Counts within one scan are usually recorded over 60s. XRD peak positions and peak areas have been fitted with the analysis software PDX-L after background subtraction using a pseudo-Voigt profile. More details on the in situ XRD setup can be found in ref. 39 and 40.
Monitoring the growth and decomposition of MAPbX3 thin films with in situ XRD
Monitoring the growth of MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) thin films

Fig. 2 summarizes the data accumulated during the subsequent growth of the three different single halide MAPbX3 thin films. In Fig. 2a, the growth of a MAPbI3 thin film is presented. In these compact representations, in the lower part of the graph, information about the growth process is depicted. In this case, the temporal evolution of the PbI2/MAI crucible and the substrate temperatures during the growth are plotted. While during the other growth processes the substrate is usually not heated, in this case the substrate temperature was set to 70 °C because we wanted to grow MAPbI3 also in the cubic phase for better comparison. In the middle part, we present how the X-ray diffraction evolves over time (from left to right on the x-axis). Each pixel column corresponds to an XRD measurement over the angular range from 12° to 40° (from bottom to top on the y-axis). In these maps, the intensity of the X-ray diffraction is represented by a colour code. On the right hand side of this colour map, brown bars indicate the position of the main XRD peaks of cubic MAPbI3 from the literature.22 After an initial heating phase of approximately 20–25 minutes, the PbI2 shutter is opened and MAPbI3 starts to grow. The (200) peak is observed with very high intensity, while other prominent peaks as, for example, the (110) or (210) are missing. This means that our film grows in a pronounced preferential orientation. The detection of the (100) peak is also supressed in this preferential orientation due the fixed incident angle with static source-detector positions in these scans. Because of the very high intensity of the (200) peak, even the contribution from the Cu Kβ line can be observed at 25.47° and is marked in the picture with 200*. In the upper part, selected data extracted from the XRD analysis are plotted. As an example, in Fig. 2(a)–(c) we have plotted the integrated peak area of the most intense (200) peak as a function of time. Here, the increasing thin film thickness is reflected in an increasing intensity of the XRD contributions.

Each graph displays the evolution over time of the main process parameters such as the crucible and substrate temperatures (below), a color-coded representation of the in situ XRD data collected during the deposition process (middle graph) and the evolution of the integrated peak area of the (200) Bragg peak of the cubic MAPbX3 perovskite phase. (d) Comparison of single XRD scans recorded at the end of each deposition process. 
Similar graphs are obtained for the growth of MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3, which are displayed in Fig. 2(b) and (c), demonstrating that the growth of MAPbX3 thin films by co-evaporation is in fact straightforward. Although these films are also preferentially oriented to some extent, other peaks in addition to the (100) and (200) can still be observed with low intensities. The XRD analysis shows that the three single halide MAPbX3 thin films grow in a single phase and no contributions from MAX or PbX2 secondary phases can be observed. All three films grow in a cubic perovskite crystal structure with decreasing lattice parameters from I to Br to Cl. This translates into a shift of the position of the (200) peak to higher diffraction angles (MAPbI3: 28.24°, MAPbBr3: 30.00°, MAPbCl3: 30.93°), in agreement with expectation and the literature. The final XRD measurement for the three depositions can be compared in Fig. 2d.
Thermal decomposition of MAPbX3 thin films in a vacuum
After proving the possibility to grow single halide perovskites by simple co-evaporation we are interested in comparing the thermal stability of the grown films. For this purpose, the grown films were heated without a vacuum break inside the chamber with a linear temperature ramp of 3 K min−1. During the complete heating sequence, the evolution of phases was monitored with in situ XRD.
The results are depicted in Fig. 3. The lower graph shows how the substrate temperature increases linearly with time. In Fig. 3a we can clearly observe how the characteristic peaks of MAPbI3 start to slowly lose intensity for temperatures above 150 °C, before they completely vanish at temperatures above 250 °C. Instead, new peaks arise above 200 °C, which can be easily identified as PbI2 (see also the bars at the left side of the colour map). Above 320 °C, the PbI2 also sublimes and its characteristic XRD peaks vanish. In the upper part, the evolution of the normalised integrated peak area AXRD of the MAPI3 (200) and PbI2 (003) peaks are displayed. The exact onset of decomposition cannot be determined from this simple experiment in a categorical manner. Nevertheless, for this comparative study we have deliberately elected and marked three points in the graphs: (I) the point where AXRD (MAPbI3) is diminished to 90% of its maximum value, (II) the point where the normalized AXRD (MAPbI3) = AXRD (PbI2) and (III) the point where AXRD (PbI2) has reached 90% of its maximum value. In the following discussions, we will treat these three points as indicators for (I) the onset of MAPbX3 decomposition, (II) the critical temperature Tc where approximately half of the MAPbX3 is decomposed and (III) the point where nearly all MAPbX3 has been turned into the lead halide. These points are represented in the upper graph by the beginning (I) and the end (III) of a shaded area and a dashed line (II).
 Fig. 3  Heating and decomposition of the three single halide MAPbX3 thin films represented in Fig. 2. The lower graph shows the ramping of the substrate temperature. In the middle graph, a color-coded representation of the in situ XRD data collected during the annealing process is depicted. The upper graph shows the evolution of the normalized integrated peak intensity of the representative Bragg peaks of the observed phases. (a) MAPbI3, (b) MAPbBr3, and (c) MAPbCl3. 
Similar to MAPbI3, the MAPbBr3 thin film shows loss of MABr and decomposition into PbBr2 upon heating (Fig. 3 b). However, before decomposing, the preferential orientation in the (200) direction is reduced in favour of a (211) orientation. Similar effects on the orientation have also been previously observed for MAPbI3 films.39 This induces additional changes in the MAPbX3 peak intensities which complicate the interpretation, but it seems that the decomposition of MAPbBr3 thin films occurs at slightly higher temperatures compared to MAPbI3. This is clearly not the case for MAPbCl3, which shows a very sharp change from MAPbCl3 to PbCl2 already at temperatures as low as 150 °C (Fig. 3 c). In conclusion, all three perovskite films show the same decomposition pathway at slightly different temperatures (150–250 °C). First, the organic MAX evaporates from the film leaving the pure lead halide behind. In our experiments with a linear temperature ramp of 3 K min−1 approximately half of the perovskite film is decomposed at the critical temperatures Tc of 230 °C (MAPbI3), 251 °C (MAPbBr3) and 148 °C (MAPbCl3). At still higher temperatures, the lead halide also evaporates, leaving a blank glass substrate behind after the process. In the following paragraphs, we will continue with an investigation of the mixed MAPb(I,Br) system.
Halide exchange

I. MAPbI3 → MAPbBr3. 
Several groups have reported about the possibility to easily exchange the halide in methylammonium lead halide perovskites.41–43 We follow this line and will first try to convert MAPbI3 into MAPbBr3 inside the evaporation chamber. Theoretical calculations of Brivio et al. predict a miscibility gap of the MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 system. The width of this miscibility gap however decreases with increasing temperature and at a critical temperature of 70 °C the gap should be closed and both compounds should intermix completely.44 According to this, at a substrate temperature of 120 °C the two perovskite structures MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 should be completely miscible.
In order to investigate this, we first deposit a MAPbI3 thin film by co-evaporating MAI and PbI2 the same way as described previously (Fig. 4 a). After a single phase MAPbI3 perovskite thin film with a thickness of approximately 510 nm is grown, the PbBr2 shutter is closed and the MABr and PbBr2 sources are cooled down (t1). Subsequently, the evaporation of MABr is started. In order to facilitate the halide exchange, the substrate is then heated to 120 °C (t2). In consequence, the hot MAPbI3 thin films are now exposed to a constant flux of MABr molecules.
 Fig. 4  (a) Growth of a MAPbI3 thin film by two source co-evaporation and subsequent conversion into MAPbBr3 upon exposure to MABr at a substrate temperature of 120 °C. (b) Growth of a MAPbBr3 thin film and subsequent conversion into MAPbI3. The top graph of both figures shows the evolution of the (200) peak position during the course of the experiment. 
Upon heating and exposure to MABr, the initial MAPbI3 (200) peak gains intensity and then starts shifting continuously towards higher diffraction angles. Assuming Vegard's law,45 the lattice parameter of MAPb(I,Br)3 should vary linearly with composition between the two single halide perovskites. The position of the (200) peak can therefore be directly translated into a Br/(I + Br) ratio x of the mixed compound MAPb(I1−xBrx)3. In the upper part of the diagram in Fig. 4a, we have plotted the peak position of the (200) peak extracted from a fit to the XRD data. The peak positions of the two pure single halide perovskites are marked in this diagram with two dotted lines (brown: MAPbI3 at 28.238° and orange: MAPbBr3 at 30.000°). At the left hand side, the peak position is related to the I/Br ratio assuming Vegard's law.
After a continuous shift to higher diffraction angles, the MAPb(I,Br)3 (200) peak position finally levels off at 29.80(2)°. This is only slightly below the peak position measured for the pure MAPbBr3 (30.00°). As the higher substrate temperature already accounts for a small thermal shift of 0.16° to lower diffraction angles, we conclude that after the halide exchange the film is completely converted into MAPbBr3. In this case, the conversion took place through a gradual exchange of I by Br, without distorting the crystal structure. This means that the perovskite film underwent the complete compositional range from pure MAPbI3 to MAPbBr3 while maintaining and preserving the high crystallinity and ordering of the crystal lattice at all times, in agreement with the prediction of Brivio and co-workers.
These observations are in contrast to the following experiment, where the halide exchange is induced the other way around, starting with a single halide MAPbBr3 perovskite.


II. MAPbBr3 → MAPbI3. 

Fig. 4b shows the conversion of a MAPbBr3 perovskite film into a MAPbI3 thin film upon exposure to MAI. The experiment is conducted in the same way as the last one, except that we start with the co-evaporation of MABr/PbBr2 to grow a MAPbBr3 thin film first (590 nm), and then heat the substrate and expose the grown film to a flux of MAI. Fig. 4b shows clearly how from time t2 on, the main peaks of the MAPbBr3 perovskite start shifting to lower diffraction angles. However, and in contrast to the last experiment, at the same time their intensity is strongly reduced. Both, thermal expansion and the exchange of Br ions by I ions will cause a lattice expansion explaining the shift to lower diffraction angles. At time t3, the main (200) peak nearly vanished. Only a small broad band with a maximum at 29.83(3)° remains. The position of this residual peak stays constant and only gradually shifts to higher diffraction angles again when the sample is cooled down at the end of the experiment, finishing at 30.03(3)° and at less than 12% of its maximum intensity. Also around time t3 a new peak arises at approximately 25.8°, which is assigned to the (111) peak of MAPbBr3. This change in the peak intensity of different MAPbBr3 peaks is again interpreted as a change in the preferential orientation of the MAPbBr3 thin film, similar to the changing preferential orientation observed for the MAPbBr3 thin film in Fig. 3b. At time t4, a new peak arises at 28.17(3)° and soon becomes the most intense peak. This peak appears simultaneously with other peaks characteristic of the MAPbI3 perovskite. At the end of the experiment, the remaining XRD peaks correspond to the single halide MAPbI3, with small residues of the initial MAPbBr3.
In summary, we were indeed able in this experiment to nearly completely exchange the Br in MAPbBr3 and substitute it with I. However, the exchange was not based on a continuous exchange of halides as in the former experiment. In contrast, our results indicate that the crystal structure of the initial perovskite over time got severely distorted and then its crystalline structure was again built up upon incorporation of the I ions. This is not predicted by the theoretical calculations of Brivio et al., in fact a similar behaviour would rather be expected if a fundamental miscibility gap between the two compounds existed.
We conclude with a simple remark: It is much easier in terms of the crystal lattice to replace I by Br, than the other way around. The implication of this will be discussed further in the Discussion section. Please note that during equivalent experiments with unheated substrates, we did not observe any halide exchange during the timescale of our experiments (1–3 hours).

Growing mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 thin films by two source co-evaporation

I. Co-evaporation of MAI and PbBr2. 
In the next step, we try to grow mixed MAPb(I,Br) thin films by co-evaporating MAI and PbBr2, in analogy to the initial work on co-evaporated MAPb(I,Cl)3 thin films, where MAI and PbCl2 were used as precursors.18,28 Since a relationship between the MAI/PbBr2 flux ratio and the amount of I/Br inside the deposited final MAPb(I,Br)3 thin film is expected, several different depositions with varying PbBr2 fluxes at constant MAI evaporation rates have been realized. Fig. 5a summarizes the outcomes of these experiments in an illustrative manner. At the beginning, a low PbBr2 crucible temperature leads to a small flux of PbBr2 molecules arriving at the substrate and therefore a huge excess of MAI. A thin film with a perovskite crystal structure forms. The position of the (200) peak is 28.48(2)°, very close to the pure MAPbI3 perovskite. We then start to increase the PbBr2 flux arriving at the substrate by linearly increasing the PbBr2 source temperature.

Please note the increasing PbBr2 substrate temperature resulting in an increasing PbBr2 flux towards the substrate during the course of the experiment. (b) Static growth of single phase MAPbI2Br thin films by co-evaporation of MABr and PbI2. 
Two observations can be made: (1) a new peak close to the position of the MAPbBr3 (200) peak appears. (2) The (200) peak is split into two peaks, with the most intense contribution gradually shifting to higher diffraction angles and the second contribution shifting only slightly to lower angles. The first contribution eventually approaches 29.66° and merges with the new peak at high diffraction angles observed in (1). The second contribution stays nearly constant and only slightly shifts to lower diffraction angles, finishing at 28.24(2)°. In consequence, for a short intermediate time, even three separate peaks can be distinguished in the range between 28° and 30°. We interpret the observed phenomena in the following way: (1) a new, very Br-rich MAPb(I,Br)3 thin film starts growing on top of the deposited very I-rich MAPb(I,Br)3 at the beginning, (2) gradually some additional Br is incorporated into the growing film, while some of the initially grown I-rich MAPb(I,Br)3 is preserved. Over the course of the experiment, the most intense (200) peak gradually shifts to the position of the new peak appearing at (1). Our experience with various intents of growing mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 thin films through the evaporation of MAI and PbBr2 indicates that this growth route tends to form phase segregations with I-rich and Br-rich thin films co-existing instead of single phase films with mixed composition. In a variety of experiments we tried different substrate temperatures and MAI/PbBr2 flux ratios, but were not able to find stable growth conditions that allow the deposition of single phase MAPb(I,Br)3 perovskites with compositions in the middle of the compositional range following this growth route.


II. Co-evaporation of MABr and PbI2. 
However, the situation is changed if the halides in the precursors are exchanged and MABr and PbI2 are co-evaporated instead. With this precursor combination, we were able to grow single phase MAPbI1−xBrx thin films with compositions of x between 0.3 and 1 by co-evaporating MABr and PbI2. Fig. 5b shows the static growth of a single phase MAPb(IxBr1−x)3 thin film with a thickness of 780 nm, whose (200) position of 28.74°(2) corresponds to an x of approximately 0.3. This experiment demonstrates the potential to grow single phase MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 thin films without initial phase segregation and under static growth conditions in a vacuum. The film shows a nice homogenous morphology with crystallite sizes around 100–200 nm. A scanning electron micrograph of the film and more additional data on its photoluminescence can be found in the ESI.† From our preliminary experiments we conclude that by varying the MABr/PbI2 flux ratios and substrate temperature, in principle all compositions between x = 0.3 and 1 should be accessible following this MABr/PbI2 growth route.

Discussion
There is a heated debate on the intrinsic (in)stability of MAPbI3, as its stability is a prerequisite for successful application and commercialization as a solar cell absorber. Several recent publications have predicted the thermodynamic instability of MAPbI3 even at room temperature. Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations resulted in a very small negative (−9.64 kJ mol−1)46 or even a positive (6.7 kJ mol−1)47 enthalpy for the formation of MAPbI3 from its MAI and PbI2 precursor constituents. Nagabushana et al. have suggested a positive enthalpy of the formation of 34.50 kJ mol−1 for MAPbI3 from their experimental solution calorimetry analysis.23 In contrast to this, our results demonstrate the spontaneous formation of MAPbI3 even at room temperature. By co-evaporating MAX and PbX2 (X = I, Br, Cl), single phase perovskite films can be easily obtained. Dense films with good crystallinity giving intense XRD reflections could be formed without substrate heating, giving strong indication that the compound MAPbI3 is energetically favourable and more stable than its two precursor phases, at least under the conditions used during the growth (high vacuum and MAX oversupply, 25 °C). As an additional check, MAPbI3 thin films did not show any variations when left inside the vacuum (no air exposure) inside our XRD setup for up to three days.
The previously mentioned publications of Buin et al.46 and Zhang et al.47 predict an increasing thermodynamic stability of the MAPbX3 perovskites in the sequence I–Br–Cl with the MAPbCl3 being the most stable. As a matter of fact, the tolerance factor of MAPbCl3 (Table 1) is the closest to 1 and hence this compound is expected to come closest to the ideal cubic perovskite structure. For inorganic perovskites, the formation reaction becomes more exothermic with an increasing tolerance factor.48 From these considerations, one would expect MAPbCl3 to be the most stable of the three perovskites.
In our experiments, all three single halide perovskites decompose in a vacuum on loss of gaseous species into their corresponding lead halides. Interestingly, the first decrease of the MAPbX3 signal from the perovskite layers is observed at temperatures higher or similar to the evaporation temperatures used for the MAX temperatures: (MAI: 170 °C/130 °C, MABr: 230 °C/130°, MACl: 110 °C/110 °C). In contrast to predictions, we found that MAPbCl3 was the least thermally stable as it decomposed at the lowest temperatures with a very sharp transition. Already at 150 °C, nearly all MAPbCl3 was converted into its lead halide, while this only occurred at 260 °C for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, both showing much longer transitions. This is in agreement with experiments by Dualeh et al., who measured lower onset temperatures for the sublimation of MACl (185 °C) than for MAI (234 °C) in a thermogravimetric analysis of precursor powders.9 In this work it was also suggested that decomposition of MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 occurs via subsequent HX and methyl amine (CH3NH2) sublimation, and not in one single step of MAX sublimation. This is in agreement with recently published data on MAPbX3 powders. Brunetti et al. also found the MAPbCl3 compound to be significantly less stable than its Br/I counterparts on heating under non-ambient conditions.49 Based on an additional Knudsen effusion mass spectroscopy and Knudsen effusion mass loss analysis, they proposed the following thermal decomposition pathway under non-ambient conditions:MAPbX3 → PbX2(s) + CH3NH2(g) + HX(g)
From their experiments, they calculated comparable decomposition enthalpies for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, but significantly lower ones for MAPbCl3 for this specific decomposition route. The standard enthalpy of formation ΔHf° (298 K) from the elements for the MAPbX3 compounds is stated by Brunetti as −688.3 kJ mol−1 (MAPbCl3), −567.5 kJ mol−1 (MAPbBr3) and −403.6 kJ mol−1 (MAPbI3). However, the decreasing trend of absolute values is mainly due to the trends observed for the formation of the corresponding lead halides and hydrogen halide species and therefore does not correspond to an increased stability of the MAPbCl3 compound (Table 2).49

Deretzis et al. have shown by in situ XRD measurements and ab initio calculations that MAPbI3 thin films should be thermodynamically relatively stable at room temperature and in the absence of water. Moisture (60% relative humidity) or thermal stress (150 °C) reduced the lifetime of the perovskite material drastically.50 Their DFT calculations support the decomposition pathway postulated by Brunetti, as they show that the calculated dissociation energies for various atomic and molecular defects in MAPbI3 are lowest for HI (1.31 eV). In other words, HI vacancies can be formed with low energetic cost. The volatile HI compound is expected to be readily lost, especially under vacuum conditions. In consequence, Deretzis et al. observed an instability of the MAPbI3 compound and degradation to PbI2 already at room temperature if subjected to vacuum for prolonged times (1 month), due to dissociation processes at the surface and the loss of volatile HI species. It has to be noted, however, that their samples seem to have been in contact with air during sample preparation and therefore some moisture might have already soaked into them.
In summary, there is still some debate on the gaseous species involved in the thermal decomposition,51,52 but the degradation to PbX2 is well established. The rate and onset of thermal decomposition is also discussed quite controversially and seem to strongly depend on (a) air exposure (b) temperature and the (c) deposition process.
We find MAPbCl3 to be the least thermally stable of the three investigated MAPbX3 compounds. As we cannot detect gaseous phases with our experimental setup, we could not verify the stated gaseous decomposition products or discriminate them from MAX. The phase transition temperatures (from the literature) and the critical temperature Tc (from this work) are schematically depicted in Fig. 6.

Finally, from the (200) (MAPbI3) and (100) (MAPbBr3, MAPbCl3) peak positions of our XRD data we can derive the temperature dependency of the lattice constants of the three cubic perovskite films (Fig. 7). The lattice parameters a of the cubic MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 increase approximately linearly with temperature. From a linear fit to this data, the linear thermal coefficients of expansion at 70 °C can be estimated as 3.6(1) × 10−5 K−1 for MAPbI3. This compares well to the reported 4.4 × 10−5 K−1 based on powder diffraction and 4.2 × 10−5 K−1 based on first principles calculations in the quasiharmonic approximation.53 For MAPbBr3, the lattice parameter does not increase linearly in the temperature region where recrystallization and reorientation occurs (100–200 °C). This impedes an accurate analysis of the thermal expansion coefficient in this range and might be caused by stress acting on the film during the recrystallization. We therefore limit the linear fit of the lattice parameter to the temperature range below 60 °C and calculate an αL of 3.3(1) × 10−5 K−1 at room temperature. In the case of MAPbCl3, we derive a linear coefficient of thermal expansion αL of 2.3(1) × 10−5 K−1 at room temperature.

The opportunity to synthesize mixed perovskites with different halide ratios opens very attractive opportunities to tune the bandgap for specific applications. Despite the fact that it is the most investigated system, there is still a dispute if the MAPbI3–MAPbBr3 system is completely miscible or not. Several research groups have reported the synthesis of powders and thin films over the complete range of compositions.54–56 Jacobsson et al. e.g. have prepared MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 thin films by spin-coating covering the complete range of x from 1 to 0 and band gaps ranging from 1.59 eV to 2.31.57 On the other hand, Brivio et al. have postulated on the basis of DFT calculations that at 300 K MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskites in the composition range between 0.3 < x< 0.6 should be thermodynamically unstable and should therefore segregate into I-rich and Br-rich phases.44 Finally, Hoke et al. also found that mixed MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskites can be synthesized over the complete compositional range by spin-coating. For an increasing Br/I ratio they measured a linear decrease in the lattice parameter, but upon illumination a reversible phase segregation of I-rich and Br-rich phases occurred.58 This phenomenon was later reproduced and verified by several research groups.29,59
In our experiments, we found a continuous transition from MAPbI3 to MAPbBr3 under continuous supply of MABr. The transition from MAPbBr3 to MAPbI3, however possible, did not take place in a continuous manner. Furthermore, we did not succeed in synthesizing single phase MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 thin films with x = 0.3 from MAI and PbBr2 precursors. In contrast, in all our attempts phase segregation of different I-rich and Br-rich phases was observed. In contrast to this, evaporation of MABr and PbI2 precursors lead to the growth of films with the desired stoichiometry without secondary phases even at room temperature.
We interpret these findings in view of the different Pb–X bonding strengths of I and Br and the different ionic radii. In both, the PbX2 precursors as well as the final perovskite structure, the lead and halide ions build octahedra with similar bond lengths and bond strength. In view of the formation enthalpies of PbI2/PbBr2 or MAPbI3/MAPbBr3, it is energetically much easier to exchange one I by Br than the other way around (see Table 2). Also from purely steric arguments the Br → I exchange is favoured before the I → Br exchange, as the smaller Br ion fits easily into the large Pb–I cage of MAPbI3, while the large I ion does not fit in or move as easily within a smaller MAPbBr3 lattice. In consequence, it is easier to substitute I by Br than Br by I. The more promising route towards the synthesis of mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 thin films by co-evaporation is therefore by evaporating MABr precursors and co-evaporating it with PbI2, or partly convert MAPbI3 thin films by exposing them to MABr.
Our results demonstrate on the one hand the power of in situ diagnostics, as we were able to conduct all measurements on pristinely grown thin films under vacuum conditions, i.e. without air exposure and directly during the growth. On the other hand, they verify the decomposition pathways and the thermal instability of MAPbX3 thin films at moderate temperatures, and therefore underline concerns on lifetime. The differences in the thermal decomposition rates reported by the different groups are a clear hint to the importance and influence of the different experimental conditions and the difficulty to obtain reliable and reproducible results for these hybrid perovskite compounds. In terms of mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 thin films our results highlight the importance of the growth route and the selection of precursor combinations in order to grow single phase materials. They show how MAPbIBr2 and similar compounds can be synthesized with simple two-source co-evaporation opening a promising perspective towards vacuum-based and low temperature fabrication of top cells for tandem applications.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that single halide MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskite thin films with a cubic crystal structure can be easily grown by co-evaporation of MAX and PbX2 precursors. The upper limits for the thermal stability of these films before they decompose into the corresponding lead halides have been determined. Upon application of a linear temperature ramp of 3 K min−1 approximately half of the perovskite film had been decomposed at a temperature of 230 °C (MAPbI3), 251 °C (MAPbBr3) and 148 °C (MAPbCl3). The linear increase of the lattice parameter for MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 allowed the determination of the linear coefficient of thermal expansion αL to be 3.6 × 10−5 K−1 (MAPbI3), 3.3 × 10−5 K−1 (MAPbBr3) and 2.3 × 10−5 K−1 (MAPbCl3).
Furthermore, we could show that upon evaporation of MAI and PbBr2, phase segregation takes place and two perovskite phases with stoichiometry close to MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 tend to be present. Pure MAPbBr3 can be converted into MAPbI3 if it is heated to 120 °C and exposed to MAI vapour, but the transition was not continuous but rather disruptive and not entirely complete. The analogous conversion of MAPbI3 → MAPbBr3 took place continuously and completely. Single phase MAPbI2Br1 thin films were successfully synthesized by co-evaporating MABr and PbI2 precursors. We thus were able to develop a new promising method for the preparation of mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 thin films by a simple two-source co-evaporation approach.

 	Fig. 1  Above: Sketch of the perovskite crystal structure for materials with the sum formula ABX3. Note that in this presentation the atoms are displayed smaller corresponding to their atomic radii for better visualization. Below: Presentation of MAPbCl3 with properly scaled atomic radii.	 

 	Fig. 2  Growth of single halide (a) MAPbI3, (b) MAPbBr3 and (c) MAPbCl3 thin films by two-source co-evaporation. Each graph displays the evolution over time of the main process parameters such as the crucible and substrate temperatures (below), a color-coded representation of the in situ XRD data collected during the deposition process (middle graph) and the evolution of the integrated peak area of the (200) Bragg peak of the cubic MAPbX3 perovskite phase. (d) Comparison of single XRD scans recorded at the end of each deposition process.	 

 	Fig. 3  Heating and decomposition of the three single halide MAPbX3 thin films represented in Fig. 2. The lower graph shows the ramping of the substrate temperature. In the middle graph, a color-coded representation of the in situ XRD data collected during the annealing process is depicted. The upper graph shows the evolution of the normalized integrated peak intensity of the representative Bragg peaks of the observed phases. (a) MAPbI3, (b) MAPbBr3, and (c) MAPbCl3.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Growth of a MAPbI3 thin film by two source co-evaporation and subsequent conversion into MAPbBr3 upon exposure to MABr at a substrate temperature of 120 °C. (b) Growth of a MAPbBr3 thin film and subsequent conversion into MAPbI3. The top graph of both figures shows the evolution of the (200) peak position during the course of the experiment.	 

 	Fig. 5  Growth of mixed MAPb(I,Br)3 thin films by two-source co-evaporation. (a) Co-evaporation of MAI and PbBr2. Please note the increasing PbBr2 substrate temperature resulting in an increasing PbBr2 flux towards the substrate during the course of the experiment. (b) Static growth of single phase MAPbI2Br thin films by co-evaporation of MABr and PbI2.
