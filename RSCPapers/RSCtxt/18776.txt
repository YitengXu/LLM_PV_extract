Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated systematically. The ground state geometries and electronic distributions of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, due to concerns about environmental pollution and the depletion of fossil energy, renewable energies and all kinds of green energy are attracting significant attention. The renewable energies mainly involve energies, such as solar, wind, water, biomass, tidal, and geothermal energy, derived from natural resources. Among the possible renewable energy resources, sunlight is a clean, renewable, abundant, and the most promising energy resource, which is an ideal alternative to traditional energy resources. Over the past few decades, silicon-based inorganic solar cells have undergone significant development and achievement, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has closely reached a value of 40%.1 However, high material and manufacturing costs and high environmental pollution limit their widespread application. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have drawn significant attention over the last two decades as alternative photovoltaic cells. Compared with inorganic solar cells, organic photovoltaics present the advantages of easy fabrication, low cost, lightweight, and the possibility to fabricate flexible devices.2–4 At present, the field of organic photovoltaics has progressed quite significantly, particularly through the development of solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs, and the highest efficiency exceeds 12%.5–7
Contemporary organic photovoltaic cells are based on a bulk heterojunction that results from the contact between electron donor and electron acceptor materials. In typical BHJ OPVs, the photoactive blend layer consists of a conjugated polymer donor and a soluble electron acceptor, which is sandwiched between a PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO positive electrode and a low work function metal negative electrode. The conjugated polymer donor serves as the main solar light absorber and the hole-transporting phase, whereas the electron acceptor transports the electrons. Broad visible absorption, high charge carrier mobility, and suitable electronic energy levels for both the donor and acceptor materials are crucial and momentous for highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs).8 To improve the power conversion efficiency of the polymer solar cells, various new donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials have been investigated in recent years.3,5–7,9–17 Among the donor materials, polythiophene derivatives, such as polythiophene derivatives with conjugated side chains for broad absorption,18,19 cross-linking polythiophene derivatives with conjugated bridges for higher hole mobility,18,20 poly(thienylene vinylene) derivatives with broad visible absorption,21 and copolymers of benzodithiophene and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene with low HOMO energy levels and broad absorption bands,22–24 are the most representative donor materials. In addition to polymer donor materials, there are various small-molecule donor materials. Small-molecule donor materials for OPVs have attracted extensive attention due to their advantages such as well-defined molecular structures, definite molecular weights, and high purities.25 Some representative small-molecule donors, such as dyes,26,27 oligothiophenes,28,29 and triphenylamine-based molecules,30,31 have been successfully applied in OPV devices. In the OPVs, although acceptor materials play an equally important role as donor materials for high-performance OPV devices, the research efforts devoted to acceptor materials have been much less than those devoted to donor materials. To date, fullerene derivatives, such as phenyl-C61/71-butyric acid esters (PC60/70BM) and indene-C60/70 bisadducts (IC60/70BA), which have a unique π-electron system, excited state electronic properties, higher electron affinity, and good electron transporting ability have been the most successful acceptors in OPV devices for higher power conversion efficiency.3,32 Despite fullerene derivatives having many excellent optoelectronic properties and even dominating the field of acceptors in BHJ solar cells, they still have shortcomings such as weak absorption in the visible region, poor solubility in common solvents, lengthy synthetic routes, low yields, and difficult purification processes. Therefore, it is very important and urgently required to synthesize non-fullerene acceptors with high absorption in the visible spectrum, low-cost synthetic routes, and controllable frontier orbital energy levels to achieve higher PCEs. Recently, researchers have reported some representative nonfullerene small molecule acceptors, including diketopyrrolopyrrole,35,36 rylene diimide,37,38 indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (ITIC),5–7 benzothiadiazole39 derivatives and so on, with adjustable energy levels, excellent solubility, and wide absorption in the visible spectrum for high-performance OPV devices.5–7,33,34
Oligothiophenes consist of π-conjugated units with highly delocalized π-systems, endowing them with unique electrical and optical properties that can be easily tuned via rational structural modifications.40 Some functionalized oligothiophenes have now been rationally designed, synthesized, and validated as efficient materials for organic electronic devices.41,42 The introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents, such as dicyanovinyl, perfluoroalkyl, and perfluoroarene, into π-electron frameworks has proven to be a promising approach to enhance the electron injection and electron transport properties of these materials. Compared to polymeric materials, π-conjugated small molecules and oligomers have the distinct advantage of straightforward synthesis and purification that leads to defined molecular structures, which greatly improve fabrication reproducibility and avoid batch-to-batch variations.
Recently, 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (99′BF) derivatives as non-fullerene-type electron acceptors have attracted significant attention because the 99′BF skeleton can easily accept one electron to form a 14-π-electron system and thus exhibit aromaticity.43–48 Brunetti et al. fabricated the first BHJ solar cell with P3HT/D99′BF (12-(3,6-dimethoxy-fluoren-9-ylidene)-12H-dibenzo[b,h]fluorene) that showed a reasonable photovoltaic effect (Voc = 1.10 V, PCE = 1.7%).43 Most noticeably, when blended with P3HT, D99′BF increases the optical density and allows ultrafast charge transfer and charge separation and electron transfer between the LUMO energy offset lower than the empirical value of 0.3–0.5 eV. Although several 99′BF derivatives have been synthesized as small molecule electron acceptors for PSCs,46–48 their BHJ solar cells have lower PCE because of their lower electron mobility.
In this study, we synthesized three novel 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives containing thiophenyl, terthiophenyl, and tetrathiophenyl groups at the 2- and 2′-positions of the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene skeleton and investigated their photophysical and electrochemical properties. The synthetic routes and chemical structures of the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives are shown in Scheme 1.

3. Results and discussion

STBF, TTBF, and FTBF were synthesized by two key synthetic approaches, namely, the Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling reaction49 and the one-pot conversion of fluorenone derivatives to 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives in the presence of Lawesson's reagent in boiling toluene.50 The synthetic routes are outlined in Scheme 1. At first, using the Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling reaction, appropriate fluorenone intermediates were synthesized by stirring bromofluorenone and thiophene boronic ester or bromooligothiophenes and fluorenoneboronic ester under a nitrogen atmosphere in a mixture of H2O and toluene overnight at 110 °C together with K2CO3 and catalytic amounts of Pd(PPh3)4. Next, the target 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives (STBF, TTBF, and FTBF) were obtained from a one-pot reaction by treating the appropriate fluorenone intermediates in the presence of Lawesson's reagent in boiling toluene. For the conversion step of the fluorenone derivatives to the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives, Agranat et al.50 have proposed that the process undergoes the formation of fluorenethione followed by desulfuration and dimerization via carbene fluorenylidene and 2,4-bis(fluorenylidene)-1,3-dithiane leading to the formation of 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivative, whereas Steliou et al.51 have suggested a possible pathway for the conversion of fluorenethione to 9,9′-bifluorenylidene that involves a 1,2-dithietane intermediate generated from fluorenethione and the formation of a carbon–carbon double bond upon extrusion of diatomic sulfur.
The three final compounds (STBF, TTBF, and FTBF) were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and FTIR spectroscopy and MS. In the 1H NMR spectra of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF, the aromatic moieties (H1 and H8) could be differentiated by the low field 1H NMR signals (>8 ppm), whereas in their corresponding precursors, the chemical shifts of the aromatic moieties appeared at higher fields (<8 ppm). In the 13C NMR spectra, the characteristic chemical shifts of CO for the corresponding precursors of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF separately appeared at 193.55 ppm, 193.54 ppm, and 193.54 ppm. However, these characteristic chemical shifts disappeared in the 13C NMR spectra of the three target compounds. In the FTIR spectra of the corresponding precursors of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF, the characteristic absorption bands of CO appeared at 1722, 1719, and 1714 cm−1, respectively. In the FTIR spectra of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF, the characteristic stretching vibration of CO disappeared completely. STBF, TTBF, and FTBF were further identified by their high resolution mass spectra, and their molar masses were detected clearly.

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra obtained for PCBM and the bifluorenylidene derivatives STBF, TTBF, and FTBF in CH2Cl2 solutions and solid thin films. The corresponding photophysical data are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, the absorption spectrum of STBF in solution exhibits two intense absorption bands at 247 and 298 nm and one weak absorption band at 466 nm. The band below 350 nm is attributed to the corresponding π–π* transition of the thiophene units, whereas the band of longer wavelength at 466 nm is assigned to the π–π* transition of the bifluorenylidene structure.48 In the structure of STBF, the presence of two octyl chains at the 3-position of the thiophene rings reduces the coplanarity between the thiophene units and bifluorenylidene due to the steric hindrance of two octyl groups. Thus, the π–π* transition of the thiophene units and the π–π* transition of the bifluorenylidene structure emerged clearly. Moreover, the presence of two octyl chains increases the conjugation of the thiophene units and the molar absorptivity of the thiophene units due to the hyperconjugation effects between the thiophene rings and the aliphatic chains. In the absorption spectrum of TTBF in solution, there are two intense absorption bands at 249 and 380 nm and one weak absorption band at 475 nm. The former two absorption bands correspond to the π–π* transition of the terthienyl units, and the last absorption band is assigned to the π–π* transition of the bifluorenylidene skeleton. Because the thiophene rings adjacent to the bifluorenylidene skeleton were not grafted by octyl chains, the coplanarity between the terthienyl units and the bifluorenylidene skeleton was larger; this led to the partial overlapping of the absorption bands of the terthienyl units and the bifluorenylidene skeleton and caused the red-shift of the absorption bands as compared to the case of STBF. The absorption spectrum of FTBF in solution only shows two intense absorption bands at 249 and 407 nm, corresponding to the π–π* transition of the quaterthiophene units. The absorption band of the bifluorenylidene skeleton was not observed in its absorption spectrum. The presence of two octyl chains at the 3-position of the thiophene rings adjacent to the bifluorenylidene skeleton reduces the coplanarity between the quaterthiophene units and the bifluorenylidene skeleton due to the steric hindrance of the two alkyl groups. Moreover, there are stronger hyperconjugation effects between the two quaterthiophene rings and the four octyl chains, which increase the molar absorptivity of the quaterthiophene rings. Thus, the absorption band of the bifluorenylidene skeleton is probably packaged in the absorption bands of the quaterthiophene units. Compared with that of TTBF, the absorption band at a longer wavelength of FTBF is red-shifted by about 27 nm because the conjugation of the quaterthiophene unit is larger than that of the terthienyl unit. The absorption spectrum of PCBM in solution exhibits four characteristic absorption peaks at 261, 329, 430, and 493 nm.52 The former two absorption bands are relatively strong, but the latter two bands are very weak. Compared with that of PCBM, the absorption of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF is stronger in the 250–600 nm region.

As shown in Fig. 1b, the absorption spectra of STBF, TTBF, FTBF, and PCBM in solid thin films were similar to those in CH2Cl2 solutions. Due to more intermolecular interaction in the solid state, their absorption spectra were much broader than those in CH2Cl2 solutions, and the maximum absorptions and edge wavelengths for the solid thin films moved slightly to longer wavelength regions than those of solutions. The maximum absorption bands of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF in solid thin films were located at 472, 388, and 413 nm, respectively.
To investigate the frontier orbitals and electrochemical behavior of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were calculated from the onset of the oxidation potentials of the cyclic voltammetry measurements, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were deduced from the HOMO energy levels and the optical band gaps determined from the extrapolated UV-vis absorption edges.53 The cyclic voltammograms of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF were obtained in a degassed dichloromethane solution with Bu4NPF6 (0.1 mol L−1) as the electrolyte (Fig. 2). A platinum working electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode were used. Ferrocene was used for potential calibration. As shown in Fig. 2, the onset oxidation potentials (Eox) for STBF, TTBF, and FTBF are 1.36, 0.94, and 0.73 V versus Ag/Ag+, respectively. Under the same conditions, the Fc/Fc+ potential was measured to be 0.52 V. Thus, the HOMO energy levels of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF were calculated to be −5.64, −5.22, and −5.01 eV, respectively, considering the energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium to be −4.8 eV.54 The optical band edges of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF were estimated to be at ca. 521, 523, and 512 nm, which corresponded to 2.38, 2.37, and 2.42 eV, respectively. Therefore, the LUMO energy levels of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF were calculated to be −3.26, −2.85, and −2.59 eV, respectively.

For comparing the energy levels of the synthesized compounds and the traditional donor and receptor materials P3HT and PCBM, Fig. 3 depicts the corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy diagram of STBF, TTBF, FTBF, P3HT, and PCBM. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P3HT and PCBM are obtained from the data reported by Koster et al.55

Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells based on P3HT/PCBM are the most representative and attractive OPVs due to their reproducible high efficiency (>4%) and low cost of the photovoltaic materials. However, the excessively low LUMO energy level of PCBM results in a low open circuit voltage (Voc, ca. 0.6 V) of the devices, which limits further improvement of the device efficiency. To increase the efficiency of the bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells, various new donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials have been developed in recent years. With respect to the P3HT-based organic photovoltaic cells, the development of new acceptors with up-shifted LUMO energy levels is very important for higher open circuit voltage and improved photovoltaic efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3, the LUMO energy levels of the synthesized 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives were gradually up-shifted to the −3.26 to −2.59 eV range as the number of thiophene rings in oligothiophene units increased. The LUMO energy level of STBF is higher than that of PCBM by 0.54 eV. The LUMO energy off-set of P3HT and STBF is 0.56 eV, which roughly meets the empirical off-set energy of 0.3–0.5 eV44 as the driving force for the exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface, suggesting that STBF can be used as an electron acceptor in P3HT-based organic photovoltaic cells. The LUMO energy level of TTBF (−2.85 eV) is close to that of P3HT (−2.7 eV), whereas the LUMO energy level of FTBF (−2.59 eV) is higher than that of P3HT. Based on their LUMO energy levels, TTBF and FTBF could be more suitable for use as electron donor materials.
Frontier molecular orbitals play an important role in the electric and optical properties of materials. The ground-state geometries of STBF, TTBF, and FTBF were fully optimized by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set, and an ethyl group was used instead of the octyl group to make the calculation easier. The electronic distributions of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the synthesized 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives obtained from time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations are shown in Fig. 4. For STBF, the electron densities in the HOMO and LUMO orbitals reside on the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene cores. For TTBF and FTBF, the electrons in the HOMO energy levels are mainly distributed on one side of oligothiophene units and adjacent fluorene rings, whereas the electrons are mainly distributed on the core 9,9′-bifluorenylidene units in the LUMO energy levels.

4. Conclusions
Herein, we have designed and synthesized three new 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives, STBF, TTBF, and FTBF. Their UV-vis absorption bands are much broader and stronger than those of the fullerene derivative PCBM. The LUMO energy levels of the synthesized 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives were gradually up-shifted as the number of thiophene rings in the oligothiophene units increased. Based on the LUMO energy level, STBF could be used as an electron acceptor in P3HT-based organic photovoltaic cells, whereas TTBF and FTBF could be more suitable for use as electron donor materials.
