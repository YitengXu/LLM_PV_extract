    , Accepted 18th July 2021First published on 19th July 2021AbstractIn this work, multi-component fluoride phosphors BaxNay−nMnYzF2x+y+3z+3m:Er3+m (M = Li and K) sensitive to 1550 nm were synthesized by the low-temperature combustion synthesis (LCS) method. The optimum batch formula was determined by orthogonal experiments. The effects of introducing alkali ions (Li+, K+) on phase formation and luminescence intensity were systematically studied. The results indicate that the luminescence intensity of 0.2 mol% Li+-introduced nanoparticles is obviously enhanced, and the diffraction peak is shifted to the direction of a smaller diffraction angle, which is attributed to the lattice expansion caused by Li+ ions entering the lattice gap that changes the local symmetry of Er3+ ions. The phase composition and morphology of phosphors were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The product exhibited Er3+ ion characteristic emission under 1550 nm excitation, and its luminescence mechanism was studied. This work provides a new idea for improving the luminescence intensity of up-conversion luminescent materials (UCL) under 1.5 μm excitation.
1. Introduction
Up-conversion luminescent materials (UCL) have been widely used in solar cells, biomedicine, anti-counterfeiting labels, infrared detection, infrared imaging and other fields,1–6 due to their ability to convert invisible infrared light into visible light. The common infrared laser band is 800–1550 nm, of which the 1550 nm band has been widely studied because of its wide distribution in the atmosphere and strong smoke penetration ability. Many up-conversion studies mainly focus on Yb3+–Er3+ co-doping, but because Yb3+ ions, as sensitizers, cannot form effective energy transfer to Er3+ ions at higher excitation wavelengths, the study of 1.5 μm band mainly focuses on different synthetic methods, changing the reaction conditions, and improving matrix composition among others, and then controlling the crystal parameters to improve the luminescence intensity of UCL. Fluoride-based lanthanum-doped UCL is different from other matrixes due to its advantages of low toxicity, low phonon energy and good chemical stability.7–10 At present, the most widely reported fluoride matrix NaYF4 is considered as the best matrix for lanthanide ion doping, but up-conversion luminescence intensity still fails to meet the requirements of practical applications.11
In recent years, in order to obtain higher up-conversion luminescence efficiency, the up-conversion nanoparticles of introduced metal ions have been widely studied. Xue, X. J. et al. studied the effect of alkali ions on the controllable synthesis of rare earth fluoride in the hydrothermal system and proposed the possible mechanism of alkali ion effects. In addition, by doping Yb3+/Tm3+, the up-conversion luminescence properties at 980 nm excitation were studied.12 Wawrzynczyk, D. et al. studied the effect of alkali ions on the spectral properties of Eu3+-doped Gd2O3 colloidal nanoparticles excited at 980 nm, indicating that the introduction of alkali ions could change the local luminescence environment of Eu3+ ions.13 By introducing Ba2+ ions into NaYF4:Yb3+, Tm3+, P. Zuo et al. significantly enhanced the UV and blue up-conversion radiation of nanoparticles by about 30 times.14 D. Ju et al. discussed the enhancement of up-conversion luminescence intensity by introducing Li+ ions with different valence states and Lu3+ ions.15 X. X. Li et al. synthesized Er3+-doped La2(MoO4)3 up-conversion phosphors by a solid-phase method. By introducing Li+ ions, the luminescence intensity of up-conversion phosphors at 980 nm increased more than 20 times.16 However, the effect of introducing alkali ions on the up-conversion luminescence intensity at 1.5 μm band response was rarely studied systematically.
Herein, we used the low-temperature combustion synthesis (LCS) method to synthesize multi-component fluoride phosphors BaxNay−nMnYzF2x+y+3z+3m:Er3+m (M = Li and K) that are sensitive to 1.5 μm. The effects of Li+ and K+ ions on the luminescence intensity and crystal parameters of UCL were systematically studied. The possible mechanism of the effect of the introduction of alkali ions on the crystal structure is also proposed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation
The phosphor samples were synthesized by the LCS method. The starting materials barium fluoride (BaF2), lithium fluoride (LiF), potassium fluoride (KF), ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2), sodium fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) and urea (CO(NH2)2) were all of analytical grades, and the purity of rare earth oxides (Er2O3/Y2O3) was 99.999%. The general formula for the multi-component fluoride phosphors can be written as BaxNay−nMnYzF2x+y+3z+3m:Er3+m (M = Li and K), wherein, x, y, z, m, and n are molar percentage, and can change freely within a certain range.
First, Er2O3 and Y2O3 were weighed according to the mole percentage given in Table S1† and dissolved in 8 mol L−1 nitric acid to obtain a mixture of rare earth nitrate solution. Dissolution can be made easier by constantly stirring and heating the solution mixture. The process also evaporated excess water and solvents in the solution to produce a concentrated solution. After that, for the better to be lit, the fuel and other starting materials were directly added to the concentrated solution to obtain the combustion precursor by uniform grinding. Finally, the combustion precursor was placed in a muffle furnace preheated to 650 °C. The precursor was ignited, and a self-propagating response began quickly. The reaction duration was about 3–5 min, and then a pink-white-like loose powder was obtained.
2.2 Measurements
All samples were tested using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer, in which, Cu Kα1 was used as the radiation source, the acceleration voltage was 40 kV, and the working current was 20 mA. The micromorphology of the samples was observed using a MIRA3 TESCAN scanning electronic microscope. Infrared up-conversion spectra were recorded by a 1550 nm laser (rated power was 180 mW) coupled with a SHIMADZU RF-5301PC fluorescence spectrometer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Orthogonal experiment arrangement and result analysis
In order to study the effect of introducing alkali ions into the matrix on the luminescence properties of UCL, it is necessary to find out the best cation composition without the introduction of alkali ions. Therefore, the composition of cations was optimized through orthogonal experiments. According to the orthonormal table L16(44)17,18 and fluoride UCL orthogonal experiment-related literature,19 combined with the factors considered in this paper and the level conditions, we formulated our orthogonal test layout table. Table S1† is the layout table of orthogonal experiment of L16(44) designed according to the orthonormal table. The concentration of Er3+, Y3+ and Ba2+ ions and the amount of urea were selected as the influencing factors of the orthogonal experiments. The experiments were carried out according to the orthogonal experimental arrangement table L16(44), and the spectra of all the L16(44) samples were recorded using a 180 mW cm−2 1550 nm laser as the excitation source, with the same testing parameters (the slit width was always 1.5, and the distance between the sample and the laser source was 20 mm).
The up-conversion emission spectra are shown in Fig. 1. The luminescence intensity was taken as the evaluation index of the orthogonal experiment, and the results are listed respectively in Table S1† (the sixth column). k1−, k2−, k3− and k4− are the average values of the corresponding luminescence intensity at different levels of different influencing factors (A, B, C, D) respectively, and the maximum represents the optimal level under this influencing factor. According to the analysis results of L16(44) orthogonal experiments, the optimal process condition was A2B3C2D3 (Er3+:Y3+:Ba2+:Na+ mol% = 8:10:13:69 mol%, urea dosage = 2.2 stoi.). Fig. 2 is a line chart of various factors at different levels, corresponding to Table S1.† The results indicate that each factor presents an inflection point, which indicates that the level selection under each influencing factor is reasonable. Since the optimal condition does not appear in L16(44) layouts, it is necessary to perform a verification experiment.

 Fig. 2  Line chart of different levels of every factor. 
The cationic composition of the No. 5 sample and the optimal cationic composition obtained from the orthogonal experiments were used to conduct the verification experiment again. The same ignition temperature and reaction duration were controlled, and the emission spectra and XRD of the samples were tested under the same conditions. Fig. 3 shows the up-conversion emission spectrum of the test samples. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 3 that the luminescence intensity of the verified sample is significantly higher than that of the No. 5 sample. Fig. 4 shows the comparison XRD patterns of the verification experiment. At the bottom are the corresponding standard card tetragonal BaYF5 (JCPDS No.46-0039) and hexagonal Na(Y1.5Na0.5)F6 (JCPDS No.16-0334). It can be known from Fig. 4 that the phase of the orthogonal optimal sample is purer. It can be confirmed from both the comparative XRD patterns and the comparative emission spectra that the optimum conditions A2B3C2D3 determined from the L16(44) orthogonal analysis results are reasonable.

3.2 Luminescence spectroscopy analysis
In order to study the effect of alkali ions on the luminescence properties, the optimal cation composition and fuel dosage (Er3+:Y3+:Ba2+:Na+ mol% = 8:10:13:69 mol%, urea dosage = 2.2 stoi.) without alkali ions were determined by the orthogonal experiments. Then, based on the optimal cation composition and fuel dosage determined by the orthogonal experiments, alkali ions were introduced into the matrix. Since the introduced alkali ions are all univalent, the chemical formula can be rewritten as Ba0.13Na0.69(1−n)M0.69nY0.1F1.49:Er3+0.08 (M = Li and K), and the introducing concentration range of alkali ions n can be freely selected within 0–1 mol%.
At room temperature, 1550 nm excitation light was used to test the up-conversion luminescence spectra of the samples. Fig. 5 and 6 respectively show the up-conversion spectra of BaNaYF4:Er3+ introduced with different concentrations of LiF and KF, embedded with the luminescence intensity trend diagram at different introducing concentrations. According to the Hume-Rothery rule: Fig. 5  Room-temperature up-conversion fluorescence spectra of Ba0.13Na0.69(1−n)Li0.69nY0.1F1.49:Er3+0.08 nanocrystals with different Li+ ion introducing concentrations.

(a) Green light luminescence intensity trend chart (b) red light luminescence intensity trend chart. δr = (r1 − r2)/r1where r1 is the radius of the large ion and r2 is the radius of the small ion. When δr is greater than 30%, substitution doping between the two ions is difficult to achieve.20 As shown in Table 1, the δr values between alkali ions (Na+ (r = 0.99–1.39 Å), Li+ (r = 0.59–0.92 Å), K+ (1.37–1.64 Å)), Li+ and K+ ions and Na+ ions are 36.6% and 20.9% respectively, and Ba2+ ions (1.35–1.61 Å) are 49% and 1.7%, respectively. Therefore, when Li+ ions are introduced, Li+ ions enter the lattice gap preferentially, and only a few of them occupy the lattice points. When K+ ions are introduced, the situation is just the opposite, K+ ions directly occupy the position of the lattice, and only a small part enters the position of the lattice gap.21 Taking NaYF4 nanocrystals as an example, the lattice simulation diagram after introducing alkali ions is shown in Fig. S1.†22

Fig. 5 shows the emission spectra of UCL with different Li+ ions introducing concentration, and the emission intensity trend diagram is embedded in the emission spectra (emission intensity is the total emission intensity of green light and red light). As shown in Fig. 5, when the introducing concentration of Li+ ions is 0.05 mol%, the luminescence intensity of the introduced sample exceeds that of the untreated sample for the first time. This is because the introduced amount of Li+ ions enters the crystal lattice gaps, causing local distortion of the crystal lattice, resulting in changes in the symmetry of the crystal field near Er3+ ions, and increasing the transition probability.23 However, with the increase in Li+ introducing concentration, the luminescence intensity decreased significantly at the introducing concentration of 0.1 mol% and 0.15 mol%. This moment some Li+ ions occupy the lattice position of Na+ ions, resulting in a sharp contraction of the lattice, causing an imbalance in cell volume and a decrease in crystallinity.24,25 When Li+ ion introducing concentration is 0.2 mol%, the luminescence intensity of the sample reaches the highest, because at this time, the Li+ ions that occupy the Na+ lattice position are somewhat in equilibrium with the Li+ ions that enter the lattice space,26 Li+ ions entering the gap increase the distance between Er3+ ions, and reduce the probability of concentration quenching; at the same time, it also restores the original unbalanced cell volume. However, since Ba2+ ions occupy Y3+ in the matrix, which causes the charge imbalance, the addition of Li+ ions acts as a charge compensator and eliminates some lattice defects, such as cation vacancies or interstitial F− ions, to improve the crystallinity and luminescence intensity.27 It is worth noting that when the introducing amount of Li+ ions exceeds 0.25 mol%, the luminescence intensity of the sample decreases sharply. After analysis,28,29 it may be that too many ions entering the gap destroy the original crystal cell structure and fail to form a luminescence environment suitable for Er3+ ions.

Fig. 6 shows the emission spectra of UCL with different K+ introducing concentrations, in which the emission intensity trends of green light and red light are embedded respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, when K+ ions were introduced into the untreated sample, compared with the samples after the introduction of Li+ ions, the luminescence intensity of the samples after the introduction of K+ ions also decreased the performance first, then increased, and finally decreased. According to the lattice simulation diagram shown in Fig. S1† and the Hume-Rothery rule introduced above, this phenomenon can be explained as that when a small amount of K+ ions are introduced, the introduced K+ ions will preferentially occupy the lattice positions of Na+ ions, causing lattice expansion, resulting in an imbalance in cell volume and a decrease in crystallinity.30 When the introducing concentration of K+ ions is 0.2 mol%, the luminescence intensity is slightly higher than that of the untreated sample. This is because K+ ions and Er3+ ions form ion pairs occupying two Ba2+ lattice positions and make local charge balance, thus greatly inhibiting Er3+ ion cation vacancy or defects such as interstitial F− ions.31,32 However, with further introduction of K+ ions, the original cell structure will be destroyed, so it will be difficult to form a luminescent environment suitable for Er3+ ions. It is worth noting that when K+ ions are introduced to a certain extent, they prolong the decay of the 4S3/2 state of Er3+ ions and suppress the Er3+ ions in de-excitation process.31,33 Therefore, for the introduction of K+ ions, the emission intensity of green light shows a very obvious change, while the trend is relatively gentle in the red light, and the red light emission intensity of the sample with the introduction of K+ ions has an obvious decrease compared with the untreated sample.
3.3 Crystal structure analysis

Fig. 7 shows the XRD pattern of optimal Ba0.13Na0.69(1−n)M0.69nY0.1F1.49:Er3+0.08 (M = Li and K) introduced with different alkali ions. The sample is a polycrystalline composite phase, which is matched with the standard cards tetragonal BaYF5 (JCPDS No.46-0039) and hexagonal Na(Y1.5Na0.5)F6 (JCPDS No.16-0334). The diffraction pattern of the sample has two weak impurity peaks (marked as “*”) and, which correspond to NaF (2 2 5) and NaNO3 (1 6 7), respectively, and are caused by the raw material NaSiF6 and dilute nitric acid added to concentrate metal nitrates. By comparing the XRD patterns, it can be found that the crystallinity of the samples introduced with Li+ ions is obviously better than that of other samples. Meanwhile, the diffraction peak position is slightly shifted. According to Bragg's Law: Fig. 7  XRD patterns of Ba0.13Na0.69(1−n)M0.69nY0.1F1.49:Er3+0.08 (M = Li and K) nanocrystal. nλ = 2dsinθwhere n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of incident X-ray beam, d is the spacing between the planes in the atomic lattice, and θ is the Bragg angle between the incident X-ray and the scattering planes. The diffraction angle of the sample introduced with 0.2 mol% Li+ is shifted to the left, and the lattice parameter d became larger, indicating that the lattice expanded,34 and the introduced Li+ ions entered the lattice gap, eliminating the lattice defects and improving the crystallinity of the sample. The SEM images of the samples are shown in Fig. 8. Most of them are tetragonal and hexagonal in shape. It can be observed that the grain size of the samples without alkali ions is about 100–200 nm, while that of the samples with alkali ions is about 200–400 nm. This further validates the previous hypothetical model and explanation of the possible effect of introducing alkali ions into the matrix on the grain structure. In other words, Li+ ions may enter the lattice gap, and K+ ions may occupy the Na+ ion lattice position, thus causing the lattice to expand to varying degrees. Moreover, the introduction of alkali ions plays the role of charge compensator and eliminates some lattice defects, such as cationic vacancies or interstitial F− ions, to improve the crystallinity. At the same time, it can be observed that the grain structure of the sample introduced with 0.2 mol% Li+ ions is significantly better than that of the other two samples, which also verified the analysis of XRD patterns.

3.4 Up-conversion luminescence mechanism under 1550 nm excitation
Since the discovery of up-conversion luminescence, the mechanism of up-conversion luminescence has been studied widely, especially on the 980 nm band.35 However, the mechanism of Er3+-doped fluoride UCL at 1550 nm was rarely reported. Combined with the study on the luminescence mechanism of the fluoride system at 980 nm excitation36,37 and the luminescence phenomenon of our own experimental samples at 1550 nm excitation, the luminescence mechanism under 1550 nm excitation in this paper was obtained.
In order to better study the 1550 nm up-conversion luminescence mechanism, the number of photons in each emission band was measured and calculated according to the formula of I ∝ Pn, where I is the emission intensity, P is the pump laser power, and n is the number of photons involved in the excitation process.38Fig. 9 shows the relationship between the emission intensity and the pump laser power under the excitation at 1550 nm using a double-logarithmic plot, and the slope was obtained by linear fitting, and then it was confirmed that the excitation processes of the three bands at 521, 548 and 660 nm were all three-photon excitation.
 Fig. 9  Visible emission intensity as a function of the excitation power (double-logarithmic plot) at 1550 nm. 
For the up-conversion luminescence mechanism of Er3+ ions excited at 1550 nm, there are mainly two physical mechanisms, namely, excited state absorption (ESA) and energy transfer up-conversion (ETU).39,40 According to the I–P curve, the excitation process at 1550 nm is a three-photon absorption process. As shown in Fig. 10, the excitation process of Er3+ ions can be divided into the following three steps:41
 Fig. 10  Er3+ energy-level diagram of the 1550 nm up-conversion luminescence. 
When excited at 1550 nm, first, the electron at 4I15/2 gets energy and transitions to the 4I13/2 excited state (step ①). Then, some of the electrons in the 4I13/2 excited state will continue to transition to the 4I9/2 excited state (step ②), and some of the electrons will transfer energy to other energy levels (steps I, II and III) in the way of energy transfer. Some of the electrons that reach the 4I9/2 excited state will continue to transition to 2H11/2 by using the energy obtained in the ETU process, while the other part will return to the 4I11/2 excited state with a relatively low energy level through a non-radiative process and then transition to the 4F9/2 energy level (step ③).
The luminescence process also corresponds to three steps: electrons in the excited state 2H11/2 directly generate 521 nm green-light (step ①′) through the radiative transition 2H11/2 → 4I15/2. At the same time, some electrons return to the lower level of 4S3/2 through the non-radiative process and generate 548 nm green-light (step ②′) through the radiative transition 4S3/2 → 4I15/2. Some electrons from 4S3/2 energy level return to 4F9/2 at a lower energy level through a non-radiative process. Together with the electrons excited from the lower level to the 4F9/2 level, the radiation transition 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 produces a red light of 660 nm (step ③′).
ETU plays an important role in up-conversion luminescence process. When the concentration of Er3+ ions is 8 mol%, the population of 4I15/2 and 4I13/2 levels will be increased by high concentration of Er3+, which is conducive to the ETU between levels and makes the cross-relaxation more efficient.42 Therefore, the up-conversion intensity of red luminescence will increase rapidly. In addition, when the concentration of Y3+ ions is 10 mol%, Y3+ ions will reduce the matrix phonon energy, increase the population of 4I13/2 energy level, decrease the population of 4I11/2 energy level,43 and enhance the emission of green-light. The introduction of alkali ions will further increase the distance between Er3+ ions, reduce the occurrence of concentration quenching, and thus, enhance the luminescence intensity of the material. As can be seen from Fig. 5 and 6, the introduction of Li+ and K+ ions did not shift the emission peak position, but different from Li+ ions, the introduction of K+ ions would prolong the decay of the 4S3/2 state of Er3+ ions, suppress the Er3+ ions in the de-excitation process, and thus, the emission intensity of green light has a significant impact. It is worth noting that, unlike the general emission spectra of Er3+ ions, the lattice changes due to the introduction of alkali ions into the matrix, the host-dependent small Stark splitting of the 4I11/2 and 4F9/2 levels of Er3+.44 At the same time, some Er3+ ion levels in the excited state will form stark sub-levels under the interaction of a strong crystal field,45 electron orbit and electron spin; when electrons on stark sub-levels transition to the ground state, several splitting emission peaks are generated.46,47
Conclusions
Multi-component phosphors BaxNay−nMnYzF2x+y+3z+3m:Er3+m (M = Li and K) have been synthesized by the LCS method. The cation molar ratio was optimized by the orthogonal experiments. The optimum experimental conditions are as follows: Er3+:Y3+:Ba2+:Na+ mol% = 8:10:13:69 mol%, urea dosage = 2.2 stoi. The effect of alkali ions (Li+, K+) on the formation and luminescence intensity of the UCL phase was studied. It was found that when the introducing concentration of Li+ is 0.2 mol%, the luminescence intensity of 1.5 μm sensitive UCL is obviously enhanced. This study is of great significance for the optical study and further application of 1.5 μm sensitive rare earth-doped fluoride UCL.
