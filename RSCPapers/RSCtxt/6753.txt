, Accepted 15th August 2016First published on 31st August 2016AbstractInterfacial engineering toward the perovskite layer/electron transporting layer (ETL) interface has been demonstrated to be critical for achieving highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, PSCs with ETL/perovskite interfacial modification by benzoic acid derivatives are fabricated. No obvious influence of this interfacial modification on optical properties, crystal structure and surface morphology of perovskite films are found. Enhancement of the charge extracting ability of treated TiO2 and passivation toward trap states of the TiO2 surface are confirmed from transient PL spectra and EIS measurements. Besides, the effect of different groups on the para-position is also investigated. A PCE as high as 18.43% with a maximal steady-state output PCE of 17.19% has been achieved for the PSCs treated with para-Cl substituted benzoic acid.
Introduction
Photovoltaic devices based on organic lead-halide perovskites have experienced rapid development in recent years, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) already reaching 22.1% from 3.8%.1–8 Currently, much effort is being made in developing new fabrication methods or techniques to obtain high quality perovskite films for higher PCEs. Besides, interfacial engineering toward the interfaces between the organic lead-halide perovskite layer and the hole transporting layers (HTLs) or electron transporting layers (ETLs) has also been demonstrated to be critical for optimizing the overall performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).9–15 Especially, interface modification plays a critical role in achieving better performance of perovskite solar cells based on the most widely studied p–i–n heterojunction structure with a metallic oxide (typically TiO2 or ZnO) as the ETL, perovskite as the light absorber and spiro-MeOTAD as the HTL.4,5,11,12,16–18 Modification toward the metallic oxide/perovskite interface shows several advantages, including easier charge transfer from perovskite to the ETL,11,12,17 less interfacial charge recombination,11,16,18–21 faster perovskite grain growth process,12,15,18,22 the shift of work function,15,23 suppressed absorption of harmful molecules17,24 and reduced degradation caused by the UV sensitive TiO2 surface.16,25
Several kinds of modification materials have been introduced to modify metallic oxide/perovskite interface, including C60 derivatives,11,16,17,21 inorganic materials,19,20,24–26 polymer,23 and small molecular materials.12,15,18,22 The C60 derivatives are proved to be effective materials for interface modification. Usually, C60 derivative could retard back recombination and significantly promote electron extraction from perovskite to ETL due to its high electron affinity. Its function could be extended by introduction functional group into C60 molecule.16 However, these modification materials based on C60 are inconvenient to synthesis thus very expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to develop some cheap materials. Inorganic modification materials (such as Al2O3, ZrO2, MgO and so on) also efficiently retard charge recombination on the interface and it is much cheaper than C60 derivatives. However, unlike C60 derivatives, inorganic materials lack diversity. Some inorganic materials may reduce the charge transfer due to insulating nature.20 In addition, small molecule materials have some obvious advantages, for example, easy to adjust its property by different substitution groups, cost-effective than C60 derivatives and usually commercial available. Thus, small molecular modification material provides a way to avoid these disadvantages of C60 derivatives and inorganic materials.
With this motivation, several works reported the application of small molecular materials for interfacial modification such as 3-aminopropanoic acid onto the sol–gel ZnO,15 carboxylic acid–thiol12 amino acid22 and 4-aminobenzoic acid18 onto the TiO2 in PSCs. The benzoic acid derivatives have been successfully applied in organic solar cells (OPVs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as interface modification materials.27–31 Therefore, it is possible to improve the performance of perovskite photovoltaic device with benzoic acid derivative modification. However, only few works reported the application of benzoic acid derivatives in PSCs.12,18 These works were based on single derivative, whereas the effect of multi-substituted groups in benzene ring on the cell performance,29,31 has not been considered.
In this work, we engineered the TiO2/perovskite interface of the FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry perovskite solar cell with benzoic acid and its derivatives. It is found that our interface modification do not affect the thickness, crystal structure or surface morphology of the FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry perovskite film, whereas the charge transfer property and charge recombination change. Compared to benzoic acid, para-Cl group plays a positive role in the device performance, whereas para-NH2 and para-NO2 groups substituted on benzene ring will play a negative role for poorer charge transfer property and heavier recombination, respectively. The highest PCE is enhanced from 17.46% to 18.43% after modification and the steady-state output PCE is enhanced from 16.17% to 17.19%. This work provides a simple and cheap way to modify the TiO2/perovskite interface for highly efficient PSCs.

Methyl ammonium bromide (MABr) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were purchased from Shanghai Materwin New Materials Co. Ltd. N,N′-Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile and chlorobenzene were from Alfar Aesar. Spiro-MeOTAD was from Luminescence Technology Corp., Taiwan. 4-Cl-benzoic acid (4-Cl-PhCOOH), 4-NO2-benzoic acid (4-NO2-PhCOOH), 4-NH2-benzoic acid (4-NH2-PhCOOH), benzoic acid (PhCOOH) and isopropanol are from Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co.

Device fabrication
Patterned FTO glass was first cleaned with mild detergent, then rinsed with distilled water for several times and subsequently washed with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, finally dried under air stream. A 30 nm-thickness compact TiO2 layer was obtained by spin-coating n-butyl alcoholic solution containing 0.125 M titanium isopropoxide and 0.125 M HCl on the laser-patterned FTO glass, followed by sintering at 500 °C for 60 min. Then, a 200 nm-thickness mesoporous TiO2 layer was spin-coated on the top of the compact TiO2 layer using a dispersed solution of 30 nm TiO2 particle (200 mg Dyesol 30 NR-D diluted in 1 mL ethanol). The films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min after drying for 5 min at 80 °C. When cooling down to room temperature, the mesoporous TiO2 films were firstly treated with TiCl4 aqueous solution (25 mM) at 70 °C for 15 min, followed by washed with deionized water for three times. After dried under air stream, the films were spin-coated with 0.1 M acetonitrile solution of LiTFSI according to the literature.32 Then the films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. The films were immersed into 2 mM isopropanol solution of benzoic acid derivatives for 40 min to modify TiO2 surface and dried after washing.
The perovskite layer was prepared by spin-coating the mixed-cation precursor solution consisting of PbI2, PbBr2, FAI and MABr according to the literature.33 Totally concentration of PbI2 and PbBr2 is 1.35 M. Mole ratio of PbI2 to PbBr2 is 85:15. Molar concentration of MABr is equal to PbBr2 and the concentration of FAI is 95% of PbI2. The mixture was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO with the volume ratio of DMF and DMSO of 4:1 and stirred overnight. The order of adding salts was not fixed since no obvious difference was observed. The precursor was continuously spin-coated on mesoporous TiO2 films at 1000 and 5000 rpm for 10 and 30 s with 60 s loading time. During the second step, 110 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped on the substrate to remove extra DMF and DMSO after 15 s. Then, the perovskite layer was heated at 140 °C for 10 min and 100 °C for 40 min. After that, a 150 nm-thickness spiro-MeOTAD layer was deposited on the perovskite layer. Chlorobenzene solution of spiro-MeOTAD was prepared following the literature.33 Briefly, the concentration of spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene was 60 mM. Doping molar ratios of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, Sigma Aldrich), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)–cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Dyesol) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Sigma Aldrich) are 0.5, 0.03 and 3.3, respectively. All the precursor preparation and spin-coating processes were carried out in the glove box filled with nitrogen. Finally, 80 nm-thickness Au photocathode was deposited by thermal evaporation under the vacuum of 10−7 Torr.
Characterization
Contact angles were measured by OCA25, DataPhysics. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on Hitachi S-4800. Absorption spectra were recorded on SHIMADZU UV-2550 measured from 850 to 550 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was measured on a Bruker X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα as the radiation source. Time resolved transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra was carried out on PL spectrometer, FLS 900, Edinburgh Instruments, excited with a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-445) and measured at 775 nm after excitation. Photocurrent–voltage characteristics (J–V) were obtained on Keithley 2602 SourceMeter under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from an Oriel Solar Simulator 91192. The solar cells were masked with a black mask to define the active area of 0.1 cm2. Reverse scanning J–V curves were used in this work with a scan speed of 30 mV s−1. Incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by the direct current (DC) method using a lab-made IPCE setup under 0.3–0.9 mW cm−2 monochromic light illumination without bias illumination.34 Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was measured on an IM6ex electrochemical workstation in the dark condition at biases voltage from 0.4 to 1.1 V, in the range from 1 × 106 to 2 Hz with perturbation amplitude of 10 mV.
Results and discussion
The device structure in this work is p–i–n heterojunction structure with FTO/compact TiO2/porous TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au layers, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Benzoic acid and its derivatives, R-PhCOOH (R refers to different substituent groups on the para-position), are introduced to modify the TiO2/perovskite interface. If the molecules of benzoic acid derivatives are chemisorbed on the TiO2, the electron transfer between perovskite and TiO2 will pass through the extra molecular layer. Considering the molecular structure of benzoic acid derivatives, the electron density of the aromatic system may affect the electron transfer performance of the molecular layer. As a consequence, an electron-deficient aromatic system is positive while an electron-rich aromatic system is negative for electron transfer. In other words, the electron-withdrawing group on benzene ring may facilitate the electron transfer, thus leading to a higher efficiency, whereas the electron-donating group on benzene ring has a contrary effect. Here, 4-Cl-PhCOOH, 4-NO2-PhCOOH, 4-NH2-PhCOOH as well as PhCOOH are chosen as the modification materials. Fig. 1(b) shows the molecular structures of the modification materials, in which –NO2 and –Cl are electron-withdrawing groups and –NH2 is an electron-donating group.

In order to understand if our surface treatment can influence the surface wetting and the solution coating process, contact angle of deionized water on porous TiO2 layer before and after R-PhCOOH modification is shown in Fig. 1(c). Deionized water exhibits good wettability on porous TiO2 layer, resulting in a very small contact angle of 5.9°. After modification, contact angles of PhCOOH, 4-Cl-PhCOOH, 4-NH2-PhCOOH and 4-NO2-PhCOOH increase to 18.2°, 14.8°, 12.0° and 14.6°, respectively. The increment of contact angle indicates that the R-PhCOOH molecules are successfully chemisorbed on the TiO2 surface.
Fig. 2(a) shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a typical solar cell with p–i–n heterojunction structure, composed of a compact TiO2 layer on FTO substrate, a 200 nm-thickness mesoporous TiO2 layer mixed with the perovskite, a 450 nm-thickness perovskite capping layer, a 150 nm-thickness spiro-MeOTAD layer and an 80 nm-thickness Au counter electrode. In order to investigate the influence of interfacial modification on the perovskite morphology, top-view SEM images of perovskite film deposited on TiO2 with or without modification are also shown in Fig. 2(b)–(e). We can see that, although the surface wettability of the TiO2 layer changes as indicated by contact angel test, no obvious surface morphology difference between the samples with or without modification is found. Crystal sizes of perovskite layer range from tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers. Very few grain boundaries through vertical direction are formed. Considering about 450 nm-thickness perovskite capping layer and the large grain sizes with several hundred nanometers, this perovskite layer thus benefits carrier transport.

Influence of the modification on properties of perovskite layers is further investigated by light absorption spectra and XRD measurement. Perovskite layers deposited on porous TiO2 with or without modification show very similar absorption properties, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a), suggesting that the thickness and the band gap of perovskite layers are basically the same, which is not obviously influenced by our interfacial treatments. Compared with pure FAPbI3 perovskite,35 the absorption edge of mixed-component perovskite is blue-shifted due to the incorporation of MA+ and Br−.36 XRD patterns of samples with or without modification are shown in Fig. 3(c). We can see that, the main peaks at 14.1° and 28.3° of all samples could be attributed to (110) and (220) facets of the perovskite crystal. However, some unreacted PbI2 is also found due to the appearance of the peak at 12.6°, which is caused by a lower stoichiometric of FAI than PbI2 in the precursor.33 Besides, no significant differences between samples with or without modification are observed, suggesting that crystalline structure of perovskite grains is not obviously influenced.

Time resolved transient PL measurement is carried out to investigate the charge dynamics at TiO2/perovskite interface. According to PL decay curves in Fig. 3(c), after modification of R-PhCOOH, PL quenching of all samples is significantly enhanced. Assuming that two quenching processes exist in PL measurement, faster decay is dominated by charge carriers collected through the TiO2/perovskite interface while slower decay is dominated by the recombination of trapped charges.16,37 Detailedly, two time constants, smaller τ1 for collection through surface and larger τ2 for recombination, are summarized in Table 1, which are obtained by fitting the PL decay curves. For the sample without modification, τ1 and τ2 are 58.2 and 225 ns, respectively. When modified with 4-NH2-PhCOOH, τ1 and τ2 decrease to 19.5 and 156 ns, respectively. We can see that with the electron-deficient degree of the aromatic system increasing, τ1 further decreases from 19.5 to 10.4 ns. The sample with 4-NO2-PhCOOH treatment shows the fastest quenching speed. The decreasing τ1 indicates stronger charge extracting ability of R-PhCOOH modified TiO2 layers than untreated sample. Obviously, this is consistent with electron-withdrawing ability of R group in R-PhCOOH, that is, –NO2 > –Cl > unsubstituted > –NH2 in descending order. Besides, significantly decreased τ2 of the sample modified with 4-NO2-PhCOOH indicated that the 4-NO2-PhCOOH molecule treatment can cause heavy interface recombination.

J–V characteristics of best-performance devices fabricated with or without modification measured under AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4(a) and detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2. Scanning direction is from open-circuit to short-circuit, which is much closer to stable-state output than forward scan. The device without interfacial modification gives a PCE of 17.46%. When the TiO2 layer is treated by PhCOOH and 4-Cl-PhCOOH, the devices exhibit 17.90% and 18.43% of PCEs, respectively, whereas 4-NH2-PhCOOH treated PSCs exhibits negative effect on cell performance with a PCE of 16.22%. We can see that, the Jsc enhances from 21.64 to 22.18 mA cm−2 for the device treated with PhCOOH and 22.28 mA cm−2 for the device treated with 4-Cl-PhCOOH, respectively. And the Voc of the device treated with 4-Cl-PhCOOH slightly enhances from 1055 to 1075 mV. In contrast, the Jsc and Voc of the device treated with 4-NH2-PhCOOH decrease to 20.73 mA cm−2 and 1035 mV, respectively. It is thus deduced that an extra electron-withdrawing group in the PhCOOH will have a positive influence on the cell performance whereas electron-donating group is negative to charge transport property, resulting in different effects on cell performance. Surprisingly, although the TiO2/4-NO2-PhCOOH/perovskite film gives the shortest PL life time, the corresponding device can only give the PCE of 14.62% with relatively lower Jsc and Voc. This may be caused by steric hindrance of –NO2 group, which may not remain coplanar with the substituent benzene ring when the molecule layer is covered by the perovskite. As a result, electrons are blocked around the –NO2 group, leading to serious interface recombination which is supported by the PL measurement, thus leading to a lower Jsc of 18.23 mA cm−2. We note that the device with 4-NH2-PhCOOH treatment can work well when MAPbI3 was deposited on TiO2 by a sequential deposition method, as reported elsewhere.18 It was reported that the –NH2 group acts as growth sites of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal, leading to grain sizes increasing in two-step method.18 However, this phenomenon is not observed in one-step deposition method of the FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry perovskite in this work, which is confirmed by XRD and surface morphology. The IPCE spectra as well as integrated photocurrent of contrast device and 4-Cl-PhCOOH modified device are also shown in Fig. 4(d). The integrated photocurrents of the devices without and with 4-Cl-PhCOOH are 20.4 and 21.3 mA cm−2, respectively. As no obvious difference in absorption spectra is found, this increment in photocurrent should be attributed to better charge collection ability of the modified device.

Hysteresis behavior widely exists in perovskite solar cells, and the PCE differs when J–V characteristics is measured under different scan directions or scanning speeds.38 To avoid inaccurate estimation of solar cell performance, maximal steady-state photocurrent output and corresponding PCE of the 4-Cl-PhCOOH modified devices are carried out, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). The 4-Cl-PhCOOH device is measured at 0.90 V, yielding an output current of 19.1 mA cm−2 and PCE of 17.19%. For comparison, the device without interfacial modification gives an output current of 18.8 mA cm−2 at 0.86 V, corresponding to the PCE of 16.17%. Both PCE values are about 1% lower than those calculated from reverse scan J–V curve. To further illustrate the effect of R-PhCOOH modification, a histogram of PCE of the devices without and with 4-Cl-PhCOOH treatment is shown in Fig. 4(c). Total 35 samples for each condition are measured. Mean PCE of contrast devices is 15.8% with standard deviation of 0.756 and increases to 16.6% with standard deviation of 0.919 after 4-Cl-PhCOOH modification.
EIS measurements are carried out in order to better understand the charge transfer processes at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Samples were tested in the dark at the frequency range of 1 MHz to 2 Hz with the bias from 0.4 to 1.1 V. The typical Nyquist plots illustrated in Fig. 5(a) are obtained at 0.7 V. Inset of Fig. 5(a) shows high frequency part of Nyquist plots. Two semi-arcs are observed, including a small circle in high frequency part and a much larger circle in lower frequency. To fit our spectra, a simplified equivalent electrical circuit is used, previously developed and established for the time being by Kamat39 and Grätzel40 etc., as shown in the inset of Fig. 5(b). Rs describes the series resistance of solar cell. Charge transfer resistance, Rct, in parallel with a chemical capacitance, CPE1, is corresponding to main circle in Nyquist plot. Rct and CPE1 describe the charge transfer property from TiO2 to perovskite layer, which is related to the recombination process at the TiO2/perovskite interface. Resistance of hole transporting layer, RHTM, in parallel with a chemical capacitance, CPE2, is corresponding to small circle in Nyquist plot. RHTM and CPE2 are related to charge transfer property of HTM.39,40 Larger Rct means carriers are harder to transfer from TiO2 to perovskite. That is, less recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface happens. Rct obtained by fitting Nyquist plots is shown in Fig. 4(b). The R-PhCOOH modified devices show larger Rct than untreated device, indicating that the recombination is restrained by modification. Reducing recombination reveals that the traps on the TiO2 surface, which act as recombination center, are passivated by R-PhCOOH.

Conclusions
Benzoic acid and its para-position derivatives, including PhCOOH, 4-Cl-PhCOOH, 4-NH2-PhCOOH and 4-NO2-PhCOOH are introduced as TiO2 modification materials in perovskite solar cells based on FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry. Contact angle test indicates that R-PhCOOH is successfully absorbed on TiO2 surface. Light absorption, XRD measurement and SEM revealed negligible influence of this interfacial treatment on perovskite film thickness, crystal structure, surface morphology and optical property. It is found that charge extracting ability of TiO2 has been enhanced after modification which is confirmed by transient PL spectra. Besides, R-PhCOOH can effectively passivate traps on TiO2 surface. J–V measurement showed that interfacial treatment with PhCOOH and 4-Cl-PhCOOH has a positive effect whereas 4-NH2-PhCOOH and 4-NO2-PhCOOH has a negative effect on the solar cell performance. The highest PCE of 18.43% and maximal steady-state output PCE of 17.19% has been achieved for the 4-Cl-PhCOOH modified device, higher than the corresponding untreated sample with the PCE and maximal steady-state output PCE of 17.46% and 16.17%, respectively.
