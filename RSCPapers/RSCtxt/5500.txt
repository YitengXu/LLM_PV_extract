The oxidized titanium carbide nanowires (Ox-TiC-NW) are prepared from TiC nanowires (TiC-NW) that are in turn synthesized from micron sized TiC particles using the solvothermal technique. The Ox-TiC-NW is characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Thermal oxidation of TiC-NW yields carbon doped TiO2-NW (C-TiO2-NW), a simple methodology to obtain 1D C-TiO2-NW. Temperature dependent Raman spectra reveal characteristic bands for TiO2-NW. Electrical characterization of individual C-TiO2-NW is performed by fabricating a device structure using the focused ion beam deposition technique. The opto-electronic properties of individual C-TiO2-NW demonstrate visible light activity and the parameters obtained from photoconductivity measurements reveal very good sensitivity. This methodology opens up the possibility of using C-TiO2-NW in electronic and opto-electronic device applications.IntroductionOne dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials have been at the forefront of materials science due to the immense importance based on their unique physical, chemical and catalytic properties. Nanoscience has been benefitting from the possibility of device miniaturization, based on 1D materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and, more recently, graphene as typical circuitry elements. CNTs have been extensively studied and reported as active components in various applications such as field effect transistors (FET),1 gas sensors,2 and optical devices.3 The realization of 1D nanomaterials in devices demonstrates the advancement of the ‘bottom up’ approach for fabricating electronic and opto-electronic devices. Among several materials, titanium dioxide (TiO2), a wide band gap (3–3.2 eV) semiconductor, has received special attention in the areas of opto-electronics, water splitting, environmental remediation, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC), sensors, etc.4–13 It is worth mentioning that the electrical and optical properties of TiO2 can be tuned by modifying the band gap by introducing dopants.14,15 Between the non-metal (C, N, S) and the transition metal doped TiO2, the use of the former is desirable since the transition metal doped TiO2 suffers from poor photostability.14Photodetectors are vital optoelectronic components in high resolution imaging, light wave communications, optical storage devices and optoelectronic circuits.16–18 Several 1D inorganic materials such as ZnO,19 TiO2,9 Ga2O3,20 V2O5,21 ZnSe,22 CdS,23 graphene,24 and In2Se325 have been explored as photodetectors. Recently, 1D In2Te3 nanostructures have been reported as high performance UV-Vis-NIR photodetectors.26 Photodetectors based on doped 1D-TiO2 have not been studied though pristine TiO2 in various forms has been reported as UV photodetectors.9–13The present study demonstrates the synthesis of 1D carbon doped TiO2 nanowires (C-TiO2-NW) from TiC-NW that are prepared from bulk TiC powders by a simple solvothermal method. Single C-TiO2-NW is fabricated as a photodetector by direct write lithography based on the focused ion beam (FIB) technique. Subsequently, the optical response of the fabricated device is studied by illumination with visible radiation. The C-TiO2-NW exhibits excellent performance towards visible light with responsivity (Rλ) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) comparable and in certain cases higher than several reported materials.Experimental sectionMethods and materialsTiC powder was obtained from MaTecK, Germany. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) AnalaR grade was obtained from Polysales, India. All solutions were prepared using pure ethanol (HPLC grade) obtained from Polysales, India.Oxidized TiC-NWs have been synthesized using a two step procedure from bulk TiC powders as follows. In the first step, a known amount of TiC powder was dispersed in 20 mL of 10 M NaOH via sonication for 1 h. Subsequently, the dispersion was transferred to a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave of 23 mL capacity followed by continuous heating at 160 °C for a period of 144 h. in a muffle furnace. The sample was then cooled to room temperature and the material was filtered and washed with deionized water and 0.1 M HCl until the pH of the filtrate became neutral. The obtained residue was dried at 80 °C for 2 h. and in the second step the as-obtained powders were subjected to thermal annealing at 350 °C for 5 h. in air. A colour change from black to grayish white was observed after thermal annealing which is indicative of the conversion of TiC into TiO2.CharacterizationThe structure and morphology of the as-obtained powders were carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker, D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer) with Cu-Kα as the source, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Carl-Zeiss) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F/FEI Tecnai 200 kV). Energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) and elemental mapping were carried out in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode. Samples for SEM were prepared by drop casting ethanolic dispersions of powders onto pre-cleaned Si substrates. The TEM sample was prepared by drop casting ethanolic dispersions of samples onto a carbon coated copper/holey carbon grid. Optical absorption measurements were performed using a UV-Vis-IR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lambda 750) in diffuse reflectance mode. Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRam HR spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) with a 514.5 Ar+ ion laser as a source of excitation at an acquisition time of 10 s. Temperature dependent Raman spectra were recorded using a heating stage (Linkam THMS 600) which is equipped with a temperature controller (Linkam TMS 94). Samples for temperature dependent Raman studies were prepared by drop casting ethanolic dispersions of C-TiO2-NW onto pre-cleaned glass substrates and air drying.Device fabrication and electrical characterizationPhotodetectors were fabricated using oxidized TiC-NW by dispersing them in ethanol followed by drop casting onto a pre-cleaned Si wafer that is covered with a 300 nm thin SiO2 layer. Platinum contact pads to single and individual nanowires were realized by direct write lithography with the aid of the FIB deposition technique (FEI, dual beam FIB, 30 kV). Defined areas were deposited with Pt using 30 kV Ga+ ions at 7.7 pA–2.3 nA depending on the dimensions of the designed pad. The dwell time used was 0.2 μs with an overlap of −150%. The thickness of the Pt pads was 150 nm. NWs are located very quickly with SEM and exposure of NWs to Ga+ ions was kept minimum to prevent the damage of NWs by the Ga+ ion dose. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 4200 SCS workstation in combination with a probe station (Everbeing, Taiwan) equipped with a thermal chuck. Photoconductive measurements were performed using a commercial halogen lamp, whose spectral output is given in the ESI (Fig. S2†). The intensity of incident light was calibrated using a thermo-pile detector (Newport, USA). Time dependent photocurrent measurements were performed at a DC bias of 5 V.Results and discussionFig. 1 depicts the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized powders and thermally annealed samples. The reflections corresponding to the cubic TiC phase (JCPDF 73-0472) are identified in the case of hydrothermally treated powders indicating the retention of the TiC phase after hydrothermal treatment.27 The reflections corresponding to the TiC phase are completely absent in the case of oxidized TiC powders and the appearance of new reflections match well with anatase TiO2 (JCPDF 21-1272), suggesting the transformation of cubic TiC into the TiO2 phase under thermal annealing conditions. It has been reported that the thermal oxidation of TiC is an exo-thermic process.28 During the course of thermal oxidation, TiC is converted into TiO2 by reacting with atmospheric oxygen and the process involves the evolution of carbon dioxide (CO2),28 and part of the carbon might get doped into the TiO2 lattice. It has been reported using thermogravimetric analysis along with mass spectroscopy (TGA-MS) that CO2 evolution has been noted beyond the temperature of 300 °C. Thus, some of the carbon is released from TiC as CO2.28 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of (a) a hydrothermally treated TiC sample and (b) a thermally annealed sample (350 °C for 5 h.). The JCPDS patterns of TiC and TiO2 are also shown. Fig. 2 represents the UV-Vis spectra of thermally oxidized TiC powder and commercial TiO2 (P25-Degussa). The data display two distinct features. A prominent red shift in the absorption threshold in the case of thermally annealed powders as compared to pristine TiO2 and secondly an increased absorption tail in the visible region. The red shift in the absorption threshold from 3.2 eV to ∼2.5 eV originates from self-doping of carbon during the thermal annealing of TiC as reported in our earlier study.29 The non-metal carbon dopant introduces a series of localized states within the band gap and shifts the absorption threshold into the visible region.30,31 The second observation brings out the presence of carbonate-like species29,30,32 based on a long tail in the visible region. Thus, the hydrothermally treated TiC-NW is transformed into TiO2 doped with carbon which is denoted as C-TiO2-NW. Fig. 2  UV-Vis spectra of (a) TiO2 (P25-Degussa) and (b) thermally annealed TiC (350 °C for 5 h). The SEM and TEM images of C-TiO2-NW are shown in Fig. 3 and the SEM image of the precursor (hydrothermally treated TiC) is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It is clear that the nanowire morphology is retained even after thermal annealing. The data depict the presence of C-TiO2-NWs with lengths of 1–10 μm and diameters of 60–100 nm. Fig. 3  (a) SEM and (b) TEM images of C-TiO2-NW prepared at 350 °C for 5 h. In order to get insight into the morphology of C-TiO2-NW, high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images are recorded and the results are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a) represents the HRTEM image of C-TiO2-NW along with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern. The d-spacing of 0.3541 nm corresponds to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. The EDS analysis confirms the presence of Ti, O and C [Fig. 4(b)]. The STEM-EDS mapping are shown in Fig. 4(c)–(f), where 4(c) represents the STEM-DF image of single C-TiO2-NW and 4(d–f) correspond to Ti, O and C elemental maps, respectively. In order to rule out the appearance of carbon from the grid, a single nanowire is located in a hollow region of the holey carbon grid and mapped. Fig. 4  (a) HRTEM, (b) EDS, (c) STEM-DF of C-TiO2-NW along with (d) Ti, (e) O and (f) C mapping. Inset of (a) shows the FFT pattern. The oxidation of TiC is probed by Raman spectroscopy at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 5, hydrothermally treated TiC shows bands located at 260, 411 and 605 cm−1 and the results match well with the reported values for TiC.33–36 The assignment of Raman bands is reported based on the presence of disorder induced by carbon vacancies, surface defects and edge defects.33–36 The spectrum corresponding to C-TiO2-NW exhibits bands located at 146, 198, 398, 514 and 636 cm−1 which are due to the Eg, Eg, B1g, A1g and Eg vibrational modes of anatase TiO2.37 Fig. 5  Raman spectra of (a) hydrothermally treated TiC and (b) C-TiO2-NW powders prepared at 350 °C for 5 h. recorded at 25 °C. The temperature dependence of the Raman vibrational modes of C-TiO2-NW is shown in Fig. 6 and 7. It is clear from Fig. 6(a) & (b) that the low frequency Eg mode shifts towards higher wavenumbers with a concomitant increase in line width as a function of temperature. Similarly, the high frequency Eg (high) mode (at 639 cm−1) shifts to lower wavenumbers with an increase in temperature. The variation of the band position and line width of three different modes, namely Eg (low), Eg (high) and B1g as a function of temperature, is shown in Fig. 7. Variation in the case of the B1g mode is different with a maximum observed at 225 K followed by a gradual decrease [Fig. 7(c)]. Similar observations have been reported for TiO2 single crystals.38 However, there exist certain differences in the present study as compared to TiO2 single crystals. This includes the variation in frequency being more linear in the case of single crystal TiO2 than that of C-TiO2-NW where the response is sublinear. The sublinear variation is known to originate from the grain/non-stoichiometric effects.39a It has also been reported that variation of Raman modes under constant pressure may have its origin due to volume and temperature contributions.38 The volume contribution originates from thermal expansion while the effect of temperature is due to the anhormonic nature of the material.38 In the present study, the decrease in the frequency of the Eg (high) mode being sublinear indicates the presence of anhormonic effects. As shown in Fig. 6, the shape of the Raman band (Eg) is relatively more asymmetric at low temperatures and is symmetric at high temperatures. This behaviour is also attributed to the influence of anhormonic effects.39b Fig. 6  Raman spectra of C-TiO2-NW recorded as a function of temperature. (a) & (b) represent the Eg (low) mode and (c) & (d) represent the Eg (high) mode.  Fig. 7  Variation of frequency of (a) Eg (low), (b) Eg (high) and (c) B1g modes as a function of temperature. (d) represents the effect of temperature on line width of three different modes of C-TiO2-NW. The variation of line widths with temperature is shown in Fig. 7(d). The line width of the Eg mode at 298 K is around 14 cm−1 which is higher than the value (7 cm−1) reported for the anatase TiO2 single crystal.38 The enhanced line width observed in the present study may be due to stoichiometric disorder/carbon doping.39b,c Similar variations have been observed with other modes as well. A linear variation of line width corresponding to Eg (low), B1g and Eg (high) with temperature may be explained using simple anhormonic effects involving three- photon decay and scattering processes, as reported earlier.40Electrical characterizationElectrical characterization of individual nanowires is carried out under different conditions. A typical SEM image of the fabricated device is shown in Fig. 8(a) (inset), representing C-TiO2-NW with a length of 1.75 μm and a width of 70 nm. The thickness of contact pads is 150 nm. The I–V measurements are recorded at 25 °C and the data are shown in Fig. 8(a). A linear variation of current with the applied voltage suggests the formation of good ohmic contacts at the two ends of the C-TiO2-NW. Similar ohmic contacts with FIB made Pt for devices based on TiO2, ZnO, GaN NW, etc. have been reported earlier.10,40,41 The I–V data of C-TiO2-NW as a function of temperature [Fig. 8(b)] show an increase in current with an increase in temperature, suggesting the semiconducting nature of C-TiO2-NW. The currents observed at a bias of 1 V are plotted against 1000/T [Fig. 8(b), inset], yielding an activation energy of 146.4 meV using eqn (1), I = Ioexp(−Ea/kBT)(1)where I is the current at a particular temperature, Io is the current obtained at room temperature, Ea is the activation energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. The Ea value is comparable with that of TiO2 reported earlier.42 Fig. 8  (a) I–V characteristics of single C-TiO2-NW recorded at room temperature and (b) I–V response as a function of temperature. Inset of (a) shows an SEM image of single C-TiO2-NW fabricated using the FIB approach and inset of (b) shows the Arrhenius plot of ln I vs. 1000/T. The individual C-TiO2-NW is fabricated as a photodetector and is schematically shown in Fig. 9 (Inset). As shown in Fig. 9, there is clear evidence for the enhancement of currents in the presence of visible light, confirming the sensing action of light by C-TiO2-NW. The conductivity of the single C-TiO2-NW at room temperature is found to be 0.7 mS cm−1 under dark and ambient conditions. In the presence of light, the conductivity of the same C-TiO2-NW increases to 1.1 mS cm−1, indicating an optical sensing action. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the spectral output indicates no or negligible contribution of UV light to the entire spectrum. Thus, the present material responds to visible radiation. The other supporting evidence for the visible sensing of the present photodetector stems from the UV-Vis absorbance studies [Fig. 2(b)] where C-TiO2-NW shows visible absorbance with the red shifted onset of the absorption edge as compared to TiO2. The band gap of pure TiO2 is 3–3.2 eV and the observed visible light response in the present case is clearly due to the presence of carbon as an interstitial dopant which modifies the optical gap by the introduction of defect levels within the band gap. It has been reported that various forms of TiO2 can be used as UV detectors and the sensing mechanism solely arises from the band gap excitation that modifies the electrical conductivity of photodetector.9–13 Unlike earlier reports, the present study demonstrates the use of C-TiO2 as a visible light photodetector. Furthermore, the role of the carbon dopant on the observed visible light response is confirmed by carrying out similar experiments on the devices with pristine TiO2-NW or C-TiO2-NW which are prepared by the thermal annealing of TiC-NW at 800 °C for 5 h. The TiC-NW annealed at 800 °C possesses a low amount of carbon (ESI, Fig. S4†) and it is expected to show different photoresponses to visible light. The results are shown in Fig. S3–S6 (ESI†). The C-TiO2 prepared at 350 °C reveals maximum response towards visible light while no response towards visible light is observed with TiO2-NW. The C-TiO2 prepared at 800 °C shows relatively low visible light sensitivity as compared to C-TiO2 prepared at 350 °C. Fig. 9  I–V measurements of (a) single C-TiO2-NW recorded (i) in the dark and (ii) in the presence of visible light at an intensity of 57.7 mW cm−2 at room temperature. Inset shows the schematic illustration of a fabricated photodetector. (b) I–V measurements of single C-TiO2-NW recorded under various intensities of illuminated light at room temperature. The details of intensities are given as labels in the graph. (c) Plot of photocurrent vs. intensity of incident light at a bias voltage of 1 V for single C-TiO2-NW and (d) variation of photoresponse with time at intermittent illumination of light. I–V measurements are recorded by varying the intensity of incident light at 25 °C under ambient conditions [Fig. 9(b)]. The data indicate an increase in photocurrent (Iphoto = Ilight − Idark) with an increase in the intensity of incident light. The dependence of Iphoto on intensity is often described by the power law19,43 (eqn (2)), Iphoto = APθ(2)where P is the intensity of illuminated light, A is the proportionality constant and θ is the empirical value that determines the response of Iphoto on intensity (P).19 The measured data at a bias of 1 V can be best fit by using eqn (2) with an exponent of 0.77 [Fig. 9(c)]. The dependence of Iphoto on intensity could be attributed to complex processes involving carrier generation, recombination and charge trapping along the nanowire.9,43–46 This is also indicative of sensitized photoconductors possessing an exponential distribution of traps as has been reported for Bi2S3 nanocrystals.47 Similar values for the exponent are reported for various materials such as Bi2S3,47 CdS,48 Zn3P2,49 ZnTe:Sb,50 and In2Ge2O7.51The suitability and applicability of photodetectors are determined by parameters such as photoconductive gain (G), responsivity (Rλ), external quantum efficiency (EQE), photocurrent rise time (τr) and photocurrent decay time (τd). The Rλ is defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power of incident light on the effective area of the photodetector and is calculated using eqn (3).52 Rλ = Iλ/(PλS)(3)where Iλ is the photocurrent (Ilight − Idark), Pλ is the intensity of illuminated light and S is the effective area of the photodetector. The Rλ value obtained for the current device is 20.5 A W−1 at an intensity of 14.2 mW cm−2 and a DC bias of 1 V. The EQE of a photodetector is defined as the number of electrons detected per incident photon, and can be calculated from eqn (4),53,54 EQE = hcRλ/(eλ)(4)where h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, e is the charge of an electron, λ is the wavelength of excitation. The EQE obtained for the present device is 2.7 × 104% at 14.2 mW cm−2, 1 V bias and 500 nm excitation wavelength.Photoconductive gain (G) is another important parameter that describes the sensitivity of a photodetector and is defined as the number of charges collected per unit incident photon. The eqn (5) (ref. 49) is used to calculate G. G = (Iλ/Poptical)(hν/e)(5)where Iλ is the photocurrent, Poptical is the intensity of light absorbed by the effective semiconductor nanowire channel, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of incident photon and e is the charge of an electron. The actual fraction of intensity that is absorbed by nanowire can be obtained by using a procedure reported earlier and the details of the estimation are given in the ESI.† The intensity absorbed by C-TiO2-NW is around 41% of the total incident light intensity. The value of G is found out to be 660. It is noteworthy to mention that high gain could be achieved even though the response is from the trap states that lie within the band gap and the excitation is with the energy less than the bandgap. The Rλ and EQE values (20.5 A W−1 and 2.7 × 104, respectively) obtained in the present study are superior to several reported single 1D nanostructure based visible light photodetectors such as ZnS nanobelts (0.12 A W−1 and 50%),55 ZnSe nanobelts (0.12 A W−1 and 37.2),22 Mn-doped ZnO nanowires (0.11 A W−1 and 26),46 WS2 nanotubes (3.14 A W−1 and 615).56 However, there have been reports on chalcogenides that show better photodetection characteristics than the present material.50,57The C-TiO2-NW can be used as an optical switch that responds to visible light. As shown in Fig. 9(d), the conductivity of the material can be tuned by shining the light ‘on’ and ‘off’. When the light is in the ‘on’ state, the response of the photodetector increases according to the mechanism discussed above. When the light is in the ‘off’ state, the detector returns to its original state. Time constants for growth and decay processes are evaluated from transient measurements. The decay and growth constants obtained from the data shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), by fitting the data to an exponential fit, are 392 and 406 μs, respectively.Thus, all the above observations bring out the fact that using a simple methodology, C-TiO2-NW can be prepared, which is otherwise difficult to synthesize.58 The photodetector characteristics reveal good amenability of C-TiO2-NW for visible light sensing.ConclusionsIn summary, an efficient, simple synthesis of 1D C-TiO2-NW is achieved based on a hydrothermal process and subsequent thermal annealing. Single NW based photodetectors are fabricated using the FIB technique. The device shows good sensitivity towards visible light with Rλ and EQE values of 20.5 A W−1 and 2.7 × 104%, respectively. The origin of visible sensitivity is due to the presence of a dopant (carbon) that introduces a series of localized states within the band gap. Charge carriers are generated under visible light illumination from the excitation of sub-band gap energy levels.AcknowledgementsWe thank the Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering (CeNSE) for the FIB facility.
