    , Accepted 20th February 2019First published on 21st February 2019AbstractOver the past few years perovskite based solar cell (PSC) research has undergone unprecedented rapid progress. This remarkable progress stems from the high absorption coefficient, large charge carrier diffusion length, low exciton binding energy and low trap density of the perovskite materials. In this work, we investigate the role of A-site cations in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells using well-known rubidium (Rb) and guanidinium (GA) cations. Our results indicate that Voc of the perovskite solar cells is controlled by the nature of the A-site cations. We found that the reduced doping density in Rb and GA-based devices yields a wider junction suggesting that the effective charge extraction at the interface can affect the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the devices. This study illustrates a convenient way for in-depth characterization and better understanding of the working mechanism in efficient PSCs upon addition of an extra ancillary cation.
Introduction
Over the past few years, hybrid inorganic–organic perovskites have attracted significant attention as light absorbers for next-generation thin-film photovoltaic technology.1–4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been dramatically improved from 3.8% (ref. 5) to the present certified value exceeding 23%.6 This mainly stems from the favourable intrinsic properties of these materials such as high absorption coefficients,7,8 large charge carrier diffusion lengths,9 low exciton binding energy10 and low trap density.11,12 Another important feature of perovskite materials, a prerequisite for highly efficient solar cells, is their tunable band gap enabling light harvesting over the entire absorption spectrum and high open circuit voltage (Voc).13,14 In general, the maximum Voc of any solar cell is regarded as a function of the absorber's band gap and given by the Shockley–Queisser thermodynamic limit.15 It can be reached when all photogenerated charge carriers recombine radiatively, thus, a high Voc is equivalent to the ability of the absorber layer for emitting light. The theoretical open circuit voltage and short circuit current density are 1.32 V and 25 mA cm−2 for a material with a band gap of ∼1.6 eV.16,17 The comparison of these values with those achieved experimentally in high efficiency PSCs shows that a further increase in performance requires a simultaneous improvement of Voc through reduction of recombination losses in the bulk of the absorber and/or at the interfaces.18–21 One approach to reduce the recombination centres in the perovskite film is compositional engineering using either organic or inorganic additives.22–24 For example, the addition of Cs cations into the FA0.83MA0.17Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite composition results in an improvement of all solar cell parameters25,26 by reducing the number and the depth of trap states in the perovskite crystals.27,28 Further mixing of rubidium iodide with a triple A-cation composition, Cs5(MA0.17 FA0.83)95Pb(I0.83 Br0.17)3, substantially improved the Voc (up to 1.24 V) and photostability.29 Such addition induces the formation of non-photoactive side phases, RbPbIxBry, during film crystallization30 and upon moisture exposure.31,32 The observed high value of Voc was ascribed to a better surface passivation that reduces carrier recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface.33 Another relevant work revealed that the incorporation of a large organic cation, guanidinium (GA), into the A-site of the MAPbI3 crystal structure effectively improves the quality of the perovskite layer by enhancing the charge carrier lifetime and suppressing the recombination reactions in GAxMA1−xPbI3 (for x < 25 mol%) based devices.34–36 Pham et al. demonstrated that GA is able to replace the FA cation in the crystal lattice of the mixed-cation FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 perovskite leading to improved device performance by reducing interfacial charge recombination and accumulation.37 More recently, the incorporation of GA into a triple-A cation Cs5(MA0.17 FA0.83)95Pb(I0.83 Br0.17)3 composition improved the overall performance of PSCs yielding a high photovoltage up to 1.20 V.38 Since Rb and GA cations are regarded as the effective additives in terms of improving both efficiency and stability of PSCs, further studies on understanding the role of these additives in the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties are required for the design of high-performance devices.
To shed more light on these aspects, in this work, we study the influence of Rb and GA additives on the morphological, optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of the state-of-the-art triple A-cation Cs5(MA0.17 FA0.83)95Pb(I0.83 Br0.17)3 based PSCs. Using Mott Schottky and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements we demonstrate that the addition of Rb and GA to the triple A-cation perovskite composition strongly affects the charge carrier and recombination dynamics of PSCs. The reduced doping density in Rb- and GA PSCs compared to the reference device yields a higher junction width suggesting effective charge extraction at the interface, and thus affecting the Voc of the devices.
Results and discussion
The state-of-the-art triple A-cation composition, Cs5(MA0.17 FA0.83)95Pb(I0.83 Br0.17)3 (hereafter referred to as “Cs”), was prepared according to a recently published procedure.39 The addition of 5% RbI and 5% GAI to the triple cation composition led to the formation of quadrupole formulation of Rb5(Cs5(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (further denoted as Rb5Cs)29 and GA5(Cs5(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (further denoted as GA5Cs),38 respectively. Fig. 1a depicts the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a mesoscopic mixed-cation PSC composed of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a 30 nm-thick compact TiO2 layer deposited by spray pyrolysis, a 150–180 nm TiO2 mesoscopic layer, a 400 nm-thick perovskite absorber layer followed by a 200 nm-thick spiro-OMeTAD as a hole transporting layer (HTL) and gold contact with a thickness of 80 nm. Fig. 1b shows the current–density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best performing device measured under 1 sun illumination (air mass 1.5G). A PCE of 19.7% with a Voc of 1.12 V, a fill factor (FF) of 76% and a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.7 mA cm−2 is recorded for the reference device. The addition of Rb to the triple A-cation perovskite composition (device Rb5Cs) resulted in the improvement of the PCE up to 21% mainly due to the higher FF (78%) and Voc (1.16 V). In turn, the GA5Cs based device resulted in a high Voc of 1.20 V, a Jsc of 23.6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70%.38 Consequently, the improvement in Voc and Jsc led to a PCE of 20.3%, which is comparable to that of the reference device. We note that Voc of 1.2 V for a band gap of 1.6 eV with a device active area of 0.16 cm2 is among the highest values reported to date for PSCs.29 However, the obtained value of Voc is still lower than the reported thermodynamic limit signifying that there is still room for further improvement by strategically reducing the non-radiative recombination. The absolute difference in Voc between these devices (Cs, Rb5Cs and GA5Cs) remained almost the same irrespective of the fabrication batches, highlighting the impact of Rb and GA additives on improvement of Voc. The devices with a PCE of 20.0 ± 0.5% were used to investigate the role of Rb and GA additives in the charge carrier and recombination dynamics in fully working PSCs. The statistics of the photovoltaic (PV) parameters for the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. S1.† Notably, the trend for the average values of these PV parameters is consistent with the best performing devices.

Focusing on the obtained high values of Voc, we consider the morphological and/or electrical changes that could cause an increase in Voc upon addition of Rb and GA cations as follows: (i) the extra cation may improve the film morphology by increasing the grain size or reducing the film roughness that leads to an increase in the Voc; (ii) the cation may cause an increase in the carrier density, which may cause a downward shift of the Fermi level in the case of a p-type semiconductor or an upward shift of the Fermi level towards the conduction band in the case of an n-type semiconductor;40,41 (iii) the cations may passivate bulk and interface defects, and (iv) incorporation of extra cations may change the band gap of the perovskite absorber layer. To study the above effects the fabricated devices and perovskite films were subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), capacitance–voltage and Mott Schottky measurements.

Fig. 2 shows the top-view SEM images of Cs, Rb5Cs and GA5Cs thin films. An increase in the grain size upon Rb cation addition compared to the reference sample is clearly observed, which may lead to a higher value of Voc. This finding is in line with previous reports, where a larger grains size, i.e. less grains boundaries within the absorber layer is found to suppress the defect recombination.42,43 However, the addition of GA into the triple A-cation perovskite composition does not remarkably change the surface morphology in comparison to the reference sample. To further prove the SEM results, we have performed AFM measurements. Fig. S2 and S3† show the AFM images and the three-dimensional photos of the corresponding perovskite films. The root mean square (RMS) of the surface roughness for Cs, Rb5Cs, and GA5Cs perovskites are 23.2 ± 3.2 nm, 36.5 ± 8.2 nm, and 17.2 ± 2.6 nm, respectively. These results indicate that the Rb5Cs based film has the largest grain size with a very rough surface as compared to its counterparts. The GA5Cs based film exhibits the smoothest surface among all the investigated samples showing its better contact with the hole transporting layer. This may result in reducing the charge recombination at the interface as was previously reported by others.44 Therefore, we exclude the morphological change as the main reason for the observed high value of Voc in GA5Cs based devices. A change in the optical properties of the resulting devices is shown in Fig. S4† and is consistent with the previous reports.25,29,38 Additionally, we studied the lifetimes of the perovskite film using time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. S5.† The fitting parameters of these curves are listed in Fig. S2.† As seen, the Rb5Cs perovskite shows a longer lifetime (49.6 ns) than the Cs perovskite (29.7 ns), maybe due to its larger grain size (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, the GA5Cs perovskite indicates the longest lifetime (56.5 nm) with an even smaller grain size as compared to the Rb5Cs perovskite. This confirms that the GA cation plays a key role in reducing the bulk and surface recombination sites. The modification of the crystal lattice structure was further monitored by 2D PXRD measurements (using Co–K alpha) and shown in Fig. 3. We observed that the addition of Rb and GA cations slightly changes the preferential orientation of the perovskite crystals. However, the Rb5Cs based film mostly grows in the (220) direction, the GA-based films crystallize in the (310) growth direction. The reference film shows a preferential crystal orientation toward the (310) direction and further incorporation of GA cations leads to a rise in the reflection peak intensity in this crystal plane. Previous studies demonstrated that the current density shows an anisotropic behaviour and if the perovskite crystals are orientated mostly in one specific direction, the charge transfer and thus the current density can be improved.45,46 In our case, GA5Cs based PSCs exhibit a higher current density than other devices, which can be correlated to their crystal orientations. Moreover, we studied the position of (110) peaks in the PXRD patterns of the corresponding perovskite films (Fig. S6†). We found that there is a small shift in this peak for both Rb5Cs and GA5Cs perovskites, however this characterization technique is not accurate to assess whether the incorporation of an extra ancillary cation into the perovskite structure was successful. Recent studies demonstrated that Rb forms Rb-rich separate phases,30,47 while GA incorporates into the perovskite lattice upon addition to the triple A-cation composition.38

Next, we employed Mott Schottky (MS) analysis on the prepared devices to better understand the impact of Rb and GA additives on the energy band alignment. Fig. 4a illustrates the MS plot as a function of the applied bias under dark conditions at 15 kHz. A flat band potential of 1.14 V for Cs, 1.17 V for Rb5Cs and 1.20 V for GA5Cs based devices were obtained, following the trend of the increased values of Voc. As the flat band potential mainly originated from a compensation of energetic difference between the quasi Fermi level of the ETL and perovskite absorber layer, with identical TiO2 and HTM layers, we believe that Rb and GA additives modulate the energy level of the perovskite absorber layer. The doping density was calculated from the slope of the linear curve of the MS plot using the expression: N = 2(Vfb − V)C2/qA2ε, where N, V, C, A, and ε correspond to doping density, applied bias, junction capacitance, device active area and perovskite dielectric constant. A doping density of 8.4 × 1016, 4.5 × 1016 and 4.3 × 1016 cm−3 was obtained for Cs, Rb5Cs and GA5Cs based devices, respectively. The reference PSC exhibits relatively high doping density and by ignoring the recombination across ETL and HTL interfaces with the perovskite layer, a higher doping density may cause a higher carrier recombination within the perovskite absorber layer and limit the built-in potential (Vbi) and Voc. The concept of a depletion region always comes into picture when the difference in carrier density and work function of semiconductor materials is observed. A higher depletion region or junction width is required for the efficient operation of perovskite solar cells.48 The obtained doping density and junction width of efficient perovskite solar cells is consistent with previous reports by other authors.49 In general, the doping densities in perovskite thin films are derived from the defects. The DFT studies of perovskite thin films revealed that the Pb vacancies and I interstitials create a P-type doping level, while cation A in ABX3 perovskites create N-type doping.50 Upon addition of Rb and GA to the Cs5(MA0.17 FA0.83)95Pb(I0.83 Br0.17)3 the doping density is reduced. In our recent studies, we have elucidated the nature of Rb30 and GA38 incorporation into the perovskite lattice. The reduced doping concentrations lead to suppressed recombination between photogenerated carriers and doped carriers, causing a large change in the Voc of devices.51 A recent study has also clearly demonstrated the active junction characteristics at the TiO2 and perovskite interface.52

Therefore, Rb and GA additives play a major role in the carrier density and recombination dynamics, which eventually defines the Voc. On the other hand, the doping density also defines the extent of the depletion zone within the perovskite bulk. The depletion layer width was calculated as 212, 294 and 303 nm for Cs, Rb5Cs and GA5Cs based PSCs, respectively. As the thickness of the perovskite layers are about 400 nm (Fig. 1a), the absorber layers in the investigated PSCs are not fully depleted and contain a neutral zone, which is larger for the Cs based device. Therefore, the electric field is only restricted to the space charge layer that mainly defines the charge extraction limit under the influence of an interfacial electric field. In the rest of the bulk region (higher in the case of the Cs based device) the free charge carriers can shield the electric field and hinder the charge extraction.
In order to gain an insight on the effect of Rb and GA cations on the recombination dynamic, the Voc as a function of illumination intensity was measured and shown in Fig. 4b. The slope of the fitted data yields values of the ideality factor (n = Slope × q/kT) as 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2 for Cs, Rb5Cs and GA5Cs based devices, respectively. The obtained values of n indicate the domination of trap assisted SRH recombination.19 Intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS) was conducted to further explore the recombination dynamics through the investigation of the recombination lifetime as a function of Voc induced by illumination. Fig. 4c shows the recombination lifetime calculated from the high frequency IMPS spectra for the investigated devices.38,53–55 We found a maximum improved recombination lifetime in the case of GA5Cs based devices verifying the suppressed carrier recombination. It should be noted that the addition of Rb and GA cations yields an improvement in the lifetime due to the presence of low carrier doping density. These results support the finding of lower recombination dynamics using Vocversus illumination measurement.
Besides the above characterization, we further studied the band alignment of the corresponding perovskite films and spiro HTL using ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) as shown in Fig. 5a–d. From UPS results, the Fermi levels of Cs, Rb5Cs and GA5Cs compositions are estimated to be 4.82 eV, 4.69 eV, and 4.66 eV, respectively. This shows that GA5Cs is less p-type as compared to its counterpart. Moreover, the Rb5Cs sample also demonstrates a less p-type nature than the Cs perovskite. We also calculated the valence band of these perovskites, which are 5.7 eV, 5.65 eV, and 5.52 eV for Cs, Rb5Cs and GA5Cs perovskites, respectively. Fig. 5e depicts the band diagram of these perovskites in contact with the spiro HTL. As seen, GA5Cs shows the closest valence band to the spiro HTL (5.4 eV). This can facilitate the transportation of holes from the perovskite to the spiro HTL resulting in a lower recombination and higher device performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have studied the role of A-site cations using rubidium and guanidinium cations in the open-circuit voltage in state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells. Morphological analysis reveals that the Rb5Cs based film has the largest grain size with a very rough surface, while the GA5Cs based film exhibits the smoothest surface among all the investigated samples indicating its better contact with the hole transporting layer. Moreover, GA5Cs based films exhibit longer carrier lifetimes compared to the Rb5Cs based sample indicating a decrease in non-radiative recombination of defects and trap states at the interface. We also find that the reduced doping density for Rb and GA-based devices can be correlated to a wider junction and efficient charge extraction at the interface, which affect the Voc of devices. Hence, we believe that the improvement in device performance of Rb5Cs and GA5Cs PSCs is attributed to the combined effect of the lower carrier density, reduced recombination and better surface morphology.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
The investigated Cs, Rb5Cs and GA5Cs based PSCs were prepared according to a well-established procedure.3,14 Fluorinated-tin-oxide (FTO) glass substrates (Nippon Sheet Glass 10 Ω sq−1 (NSG-10)) were etched and cleaned by ultrasonication in Triton X100 solution (1 vol% in deionized water), DI water, acetone, and ethanol, respectively. Then, TiO2 as a blocking layer was sprayed on FTO glass at 450 °C from a solution of titanium isopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by annealing at this temperature for 20 min. Afterward, a mesoporous layer of TiO2 (30NRT, Greatcell) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min.
Perovskite solution was prepared from a precursor solution of the (FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13 perovskite by dissolving PbI2 (1.10 M, TCI), PbBr2 (0.185 M, TCI), FAI (1.05 M, Dyesol), and MABr (0.185 M, Dyesol) in DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (volume ratio). Then, a CsI solution was prepared with a concentration of 1.5 M in DMSO and 5 vol% of CsI solution was added to the first solution to obtain a triple A-cation perovskite. For preparation of Rb5Cs and GA5Cs solutions, RbI and GAI were dissolved in DMSO separately with a concentration of 1.5 M. Then, 5 vol% of RbI solution and 5 vol% of GAI solution were added into two separated bottles of the triple-A cation perovskite (named as Cs) to obtain Rb5Cs and GA5Cs solutions.
Perovskite solutions were spin-coated in two steps: 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s (ramp rate: 2000 rpm s−1). Here, an anti-solvent technique was employed and 200 μL of chlorobenzene (CB) was dropped on the surface of the perovskite film just 10 seconds before the end of spinning. Then, the film was annealed 100 °C for 60 min. For the HTL layer, a solution of spiro-OMeTAD (70 mM) dissolved in 1 mL CB was prepared by addition of 18 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (4tBP-Sigma-Aldrich) and 32 μL of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (1.8 M in acetonitrile). This solution was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 20 s (with a ramp rate of 2000 rpm s−1). Finally, a 80 nm-thick gold electrode was thermally evaporated to complete the device.
Film characterization
Perovskite films were analysed using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM, ZEISS Merlin), an atomic force microscope (AFM, NanoScope IIIa/Dimension 3100) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique recorded using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer (USA) with GADDS utilizing Co radiation. The optical properties of films were measured by UV–visible (Varian Cary 5) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (Fluorolog 322; Horiba Jobin Ybon Ltd). TRPL measurement is performed using a picosecond pulsed diode laser (with excitation wavelength of λ = 405 nm and pulse width of 49 ps). The obtained curve is fitted by an exponential equation (I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1)), where A1 and τ1 are the amplitude and the lifetime. An omicron ultrahigh vacuum system employing the He I line (21.2 eV) of a helium discharge lamp is used to perform ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).
Device measurements
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 conditions using a 450 W Xenon lamp (Oriel), as a light source, equipped with a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Praezisions Glas & Optik GmbH) to match the emission spectra to the AM1.5G standard in the region of 350–750 nm. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cell while recording the generated photocurrent using a Keithley (Model 2400) digital source meter and also with a temperature-controlled probe station from LASC. The J–V curves of all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask of area 0.16 cm2. AC measurements were performed using a potentiostat Autolab equipped with a frequency response analyser. EIS measurements were performed in the DC bias range of 0 to open circuit voltage with an AC perturbation signal of 20 mV in the frequency range of 100 mHz to100 kHz.
