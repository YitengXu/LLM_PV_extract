Specifically, high optical transparency and excellent electrical properties are essential for optimized hole transport materials in inverted-type planar perovskite solar cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the molecular doping of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) by 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) significantly enhances the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. The incorporation of F4TCNQ into CuSCN leads to successful electron transfer from CuSCN to F4TCNQ, which affords more balanced energy level alignment at the interface of the perovskite layer for hole conduction. Device analyses reveal faster charge transport and less carrier recombination in the F4TCNQ-doped CuSCN-based devices, contributing to not only the improved efficiency but also the hysteresis elimination. At the optimized doping concentration, the doped CuSCN exhibited an ∼35% increased efficiency as high as 15.01% in the inverted-type planar perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
In the last decade, organo-lead trihalide perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have received enormous interest as a next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their low material cost, superior efficiency, and low-temperature solution processability.1–4 The state-of-the-art power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been achieved as high as 24% via successful engineering in materials and devices.5 So far, high-performance PSCs have usually been fabricated with a typical device configuration of n–i–p, in which mesoscopic TiO2 and organic semiconductors were used at the interfaces in the devices as electron-transporting materials (ETMs) and hole-transporting materials (HTMs), respectively.5–10 In contrast, the inverted-type devices in a configuration of p–i–n have also been investigated because of their much simpler device structure together with a more facile procedure for device fabrication. For the inverted-type devices, HTMs play a key role in extracting and collecting the photo-generated holes from the perovskite absorber, thus circumventing undesired recombination losses at the interfaces and enhancing the overall photovoltaic performance.11 There are several prerequisites for excellent candidates for HTMs in the inverted-type planar PSCs such as high optical transparency and well-matched energy levels. Highly transparent HTMs enable maximized photon harvesting of the perovskite absorber, and the balanced valence band maximum (VBM) levels of HTMs to the perovskite ensure minimized undesired energy losses of hole carrier transportation.19–21 For these criteria, a variety of p-type semiconductors including both organic and inorganic materials have been utilized as HTMs in the inverted PSCs, which have achieved comparable PCEs to the typical n–i–p devices in recent years.12–15 Copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) is another interesting p-type semiconductor that has been demonstrated as an attractive candidate for solution-processed HTMs in optoelectronic devices.16–18 Very recently, solution processed CuSCN films have also been demonstrated as excellent HTMs in PSCs because of their high optical transparency in the visible region as well as sufficient energy levels (VBM = −5.4 eV) to function as outstanding HTMs in PSCs.19–21 However, there are still some issues in CuSCN-based devices that remain to be resolved such as unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance and severe hysteresis. To further boost the photovoltaic performance, the ideal HTMs should possess high hole mobility because the accumulated hole carriers in HTMs will lead to undesirable energy level alignment at the interfaces, which results in weak built-in field strength in each layer of the device and a large energy level offset to the perovskite layer.22 Derived from that, relatively low hole mobility (conductivity) of CuSCN would lead to limited hole transfer to the perovskite layer, which accelerates hole accumulation at the interface and thus results in electron–hole recombination.20,25–27 For this concern, considerable effort has been made to improve the electronic properties of HTMs and hence to improve band alignment at the HTM/perovskite interface by p-type doping of HTMs.23,24 For example, p-type doping of nickel oxide has been explored to improve the electronic properties of the HTMs in the planar PSCs, and considerable PCE improvements have been demonstrated.25–28 Thus, exploring the impact of p-type doping of CuSCN on the photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs is an important aspect of their optimization.
Here, we demonstrated the improved photovoltaic performance of inverted-type planar PSCs by employing the doped CuSCN as a HTM for the first time. 2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ), a strong electron-accepting molecule with the very low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, −5.2 eV) energy levels, has been widely used in organic electronics as a dopant to enhance photoconductivity in conjugated polymers and to reduce the hole injection barrier in the devices29–31 (Fig. 1a). As F4TCNQ was mixed with CuSCN, the electron transfer from CuSCN to F4TCNQ occurs and then both the VBM and the Fermi level of CuSCN become closer to the VBM of the perovskite, which resulted in the reduction of the energy level offset between at the interface of HTM/perovskites. As a result, F4TCNQ doping remarkably enhanced hole extraction capability and reduced the resistance for hole transport at the CuSCN/perovskite interface, boosting the PCE for the planar PSCs up to 15.01%. The systematic device analyses further revealed that the doped CuSCN enabled faster charge transport and less carrier recombination, which contributes to PCE enhancement and hysteresis elimination.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Copper thiocyanate (reagent grade) was purchased from Duksan pure chemicals. Diethyl sulfide (98%), isopropyl alcohol (99%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99%), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was purchased from Dyesol. Lead(II) iodide (99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. F4TCNQ and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were purchased from TCI chemical and Nano-C, respectively.
2.2 Device fabrication and measurements
The pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates were treated with UV-O3 for 15 min. The CuSCN solution in diethyl sulfide (30 mg ml−1) with or without F4TNCQ was spin-coated on ITO-coated glass substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in the ambient atmosphere. The perovskite precursor solution in which MAI (159 mg), PbI2 (461 mg) and DMSO (78 mg) (1:1:1 molar ratio) were dissolved in 600 mg of DMF was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 25 s onto the CuSCN/ITO substrates. At 7 s after the spin-coating proceeded, 400 μL of chlorobenzene was added dropwise onto the rotating substrate. After the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min, the PC61BM solution (15 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) and bis-C60 (2 mg ml−1 in isopropyl alcohol) were subsequently spin-coated. Finally, the 100 nm thickness of the Ag electrode was evaporated by using a thermal evaporator under <5 × 10−6 Torr at an evaporation rate of 0.4 Å s−1 to complete the device fabrication. The J–V curves of devices were measured using a solar simulator (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) with a parameter analyzer (4200-SCS, Keithley). The aperture area for the devices was 10 mm2, and the irradiation intensity was calibrated with an NREL-calibrated reference cell (Abet Technologies). More than 20 devices were fabricated in each condition for statistical analysis of photovoltaic performance.
2.3 Characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out using an AXIS ultra-delay line detector (DLD) (Kratos, UK) equipped with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) as an X-ray source (or He I gas (21.22 eV) as a UV source). The transmittance and absorption properties were measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 100, Agilent). The surface morphologies of thin films were confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, CoreAFM, Nanosurf). The photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite layers were characterized using fluorescence spectrometers (FS5 spectrofluorometer, Edinburgh Instrument) with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm. The photoluminescence decay was monitored using a time-correlated single photon counting system with a picosecond pulsed laser (Edinburgh Instrument) with an excitation at 405 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out to obtain X-ray diffractograms of CuSCN and perovskite films using a Bruker XRD (D8 Advance, Bruker Corporation). The modulated spectroscopy and the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices were recorded using a potentiostat (Compactstat, IVIUM) under illumination of white light emitting diodes.
3. Results and discussion
The doped CuSCN thin films were prepared by mixing F4TCNQ with different concentrations in diethyl sulfide (DES). Both CuSCN and F4TCNQ are well soluble in DES with a good solubility at room temperature (>10 mg ml−1), and the solution is stable up to several weeks without the formation of any aggregate (Fig. S1a†). The yellowish color for the solution of CuSCN doped with F4TCNQ comes from the native absorption for F4TCNQ in the range of 350–450 nm (Fig. S1b†). The CuSCN thin films were deposited from a simple spin-coating process under ambient conditions, and the films were dried under mild conditions (100 °C for 10 min). The CuSCN thin films were smooth and flat with small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values regardless of F4TCNQ doping (Fig. 1b). Because a primary advantage for CuSCN as a hole transport layer is excellent transparency in the UV-Vis region, the optical properties of CuSCN thin films were investigated by varying the doping concentration of F4TCNQ. As seen in Fig. 2a, the CuSCN thin films exhibited an optical transparency of >88% in the wavelength range of 350–900 nm regardless of doping with F4TCNQ, which corresponds to low absorptivity of CuSCN in the UV-Vis-NIR range (Fig. S1b†). The exceptional transparency in CuSCN is essential for avoiding the overlap with the parasitical absorption of CH3NH3PbI3, thus allowing maximized photon harvesting of inverted-type planar heterojunction PSCs.17 The inset of Fig. 2a depicts the Tauc analysis to determine the optical bandgap (Eg) of the CuSCN thin films from UV-Vis absorption spectra. Here, the value of (αhν)2 was calculated for the direct bandgap transition of photons as a function of photon energy (hν), where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the radiation frequency. For the CuSCN thin films the intercept of a linear fit of the spectra yielded a direct Eg value of 3.92 eV for both pristine and doped CuSCN which have an excellent agreement with the previous reports.32 It is also noted that the crystal structure for CuSCN thin films deposited from spin-coating was confirmed as a rhombohedral β-phase as three diffraction peaks corresponding to the (003), (101) and (006) crystallographic planes were identified in XRD investigations (Fig. S2†).

To figure out the doping principle for CuSCN with F4TCNQ, electronic structures of CuSCN thin films were probed using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), which is widely used to study the density of states below the Fermi level (EF) of a material and its surface.33–36 From the secondary cut-off region, the work functions (φ) of the pristine and doped CuSCN thin films were determined to be 4.88 and 5.04 eV, respectively, while the valence band maximum (VBM) levels of the pristine and doped CuSCN were calculated to be −5.30 and −5.38 eV, respectively (Fig. 2b). Along with the Eg value of CuSCN thin films derived from the Tauc plots, it is evident that the energy level offset for the valence band maximum (ΔEVBM) at the interface of ITO and CuSCN becomes narrow from 0.42 to 0.34 eV with F4TCNQ doping. This result could be derived by the successful electron transfer from CuSCN to F4TCNQ, which is consistent with some previous reports of F4TCNQ and related p-type semiconductors.32 The UPS spectra of the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) layers on both CuSCN thin films were also obtained as shown in Fig. 2b, and the corresponding energy levels for EF, EVBM, and ECBM are shown in Fig. 2c. Despite the relatively large thickness (hundreds of nm) of the perovskite layer compared to that of CuSCN, it is clear that EVBM − EF for the interface of CuSCN and the perovskite layer effectively decreases after doping with F4TCNQ, indicating that the ΔEVBM value for charge transfer between CuSCN and the perovskite is reduced, which approaches more well-matched and balanced hole-transport pathway at the interfaces between the layer in the devices. All these results derived from UPS measurements could be ascribed to the effective electron transfer between CuSCN and F4TCNQ, which definitely accelerates the p-type doping effect in the CuSCN thin films.
To further confirm electron transfer from CuSCN to F4TCNQ, core-level peaks for CuSCN thin films were analyzed by XPS (Fig. 3). For Cu, S, C, and N, the core-level binding energy has an unambiguous shift of 0.5–0.9 eV with the doping of F4TCNQ, which is another evidence for effective electron transfer from CuSCN to F4TCNQ. The shift toward high binding energy demonstrates electron transfer from CuSCN to F4TCNQ, which agrees well with the phenomena of a shift with p-type doping of semiconductors.35,36 The obvious signal for fluorine was also detected in the doped CuSCN thin film, indicating the successful p-type doping of CuSCN by F4TCNQ (Fig. S3a†). Elemental mapping for the doped CuSCN thin film also suggests that F4TCNQ is well-distributed in the compact CuSCN grains (Fig. S3b†).

To evaluate the effectiveness of the doping of CuSCN as a HTL in PSCs, the inverted-type planar heterojunction devices were fabricated with a device architecture as follows: ITO/CuSCN/perovskite/PC61BM/bis-C60/Ag.37 It is noted that the perovskite films formed on CuSCN were composed of compact grains, and the film morphology, crystallinity and absorption properties were comparable regardless of F4TCNQ doping (Fig. S4†). The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves for the devices incorporating pristine and doped CuSCN as HTLs under irradiation are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The details of device fabrication are described in the Experimental section. The reference devices using the un-doped CuSCN as a HTL exhibited PCEs up to 11.07% under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.92 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 19.00 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.62 (Fig. 4a). We acquired the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 4a) of the devices, which use F4TCNQ-doped CuSCN, the perovskite, PCBM, bis-C60, and a silver layer. It can be shown that very thin F4TNCQ-doped CuSCN (∼20 nm), perovskite (∼300 nm), thin PCBM and bis-C60 (∼20 nm), and silver layer (∼100 nm). In the devices with the doped CuSCN films, the PCEs increased to 15.01% with 0.03 wt% of F4TCNQ owing to the remarkably enhanced VOC (1.00 V) and FF (0.73). As the doping concentration was further increased, the PCEs drop to 12.79% and 10.46% for 0.06 wt% and 0.09 wt% of F4TCNQ, showing a similar variation trend of VOC, JSC and FF, and thus the optimized doping concentration for F4TCNQ was found to be 0.03 wt% (Fig. 4b). The integrated values from EQE curves for the devices with un-doped and doped CuSCN were consistent with the stabilized JSC values measured under continuous illumination at 100 mW cm−2 for 600 s, which verifies the improved photoelectric conversion properties of the doped CuSCN with F4TCNQ (Fig. 4c and d). Hysteresis upon the scan direction for J–V measurements is another critical issue for PSCs with a planar heterojunction and is more serious in the CuSCN-based devices.38 In order to compare the impact of F4TCNQ doping of CuSCN on the hysteresis behaviors of the devices, the hysteresis effect index (HI) was quantified using the following equation: (1)

Despite the fact that the hysteresis was negligible with small HI values for both devices employing the un-doped (0.029) and doped CuSCN (0.003), the significantly lower HI value for the device with the doped CuSCN clearly indicates that the charge accumulation and charge traps were much suppressed and thus efficient hole extraction from the perovskite layer to the HTL was achieved in the device using F4TCNQ-doped CuSCN.37,38 All these beneficial prospects of the F4TCNQ doping for the charge transport/collection efficiency at the interface of CuSCN/perovskite led to substantial enhancement in PCEs for the planar inverted-type PSCs, as seen in statistical analysis (Fig. 4f).
To understand the kinetics regarding the charge transport/extraction of the CuSCN films with regard to F4TCNQ doping, photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite layer was compared with individual HTLs. Fig. 5a shows that the PL of the perovskite film is significantly quenched with the doped CuSCN thin films as compared to the un-doped CuSCN, which suggests enhanced selective extraction of hole carriers in the doped CuSCN. We further investigated the hole extraction capability of CuSCN thin films by monitoring PL decay by using a time-correlated single photon counting system (Fig. 5b). The PL decay curves were fitted using a biexponential decay function in which the PL decay takes place through two relaxation pathways in the perovskite layer.39 The fast decay (τ1) and the slow decay (τ2) are considered to correlate with effective hole extraction by the HTL and the radiative decay within the perovskite layer, respectively. The bare perovskite layer on the glass substrate showed the average lifetime (τave) of photogenerated excitons of 123.32 ns, while the perovskite layer deposited on the un-doped and the doped CuSCN films exhibited τave values of 115.54 and 60.76 ns, respectively. The fast decay of PL is evidence of effective hole extraction at the interface between the perovskite and the HTL, which is consistent with the steady-state PL result. Thus it is concluded that the F4TCNQ doping effectively enhances the hole transport/extraction capabilities for efficient charge transfer and transport to the corresponding electrodes with regard to the perovskite layer, which is critical in preventing electron–hole pair recombination and in increasing PCE of the solar cell.

Because intensity-modulated spectroscopy gives important information for charge transfer and recombination kinetics at the interfaces of PSCs, intensity-modulated measurements of the devices with different HTLs were investigated to further understand the influence of F4TCNQ doping of CuSCN on the PCE discrepancy. The electron transport time constant (τc) and the electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) were calculated from the equation of τc = 1/2πfc and Dn = ω2/(2.35τc), where ω and fc are the thickness of perovskite films (∼450 nm in this work) and the characteristic frequency minimum from intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) curves, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, the plots of τc for the devices with varying short circuit currents (ISC) indicate that electron transport becomes much faster at the interface with the doped CuSCN as compared to that of un-doped CuSCN, and thus the Dn value for the doped CuSCN-based device was more extended as compared to the un-doped CuSCN-based device, which would be correlated with the suppressed backward recombination in the device as evident to improved FF and JSC. For the intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) analysis, the recombination time constant (τr) was calculated using the equation of τr = 1/2πfr, where fr is the characteristic frequency minimum of IMVS curves with different ISC values (Fig. 6b). The un-doped CuSCN afforded shorter τr and thus the absolute time for bimolecular recombination is very short, while F4TCNQ doping effectively prolonged the τr value for recombination in the device. This result is another evidence for improved electronic properties for the interface between the perovskite layer and the doped CuSCN, which resulted in quick hole extraction and the suppressed charge recombination in the device employing the doped CuSCN.40–42

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the devices was also performed to examine the efficacy of F4TCNQ doping for charge transporting behavior at the interfaces of the PSCs. Fig. 6c shows the Nyquist plots for the devices with different HTLs measured in the dark with a 0.75 V bias in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 mHz, and their fitting results of the equivalent circuit are listed in Fig. 6c. The high-frequency intercept to the Z′ axis which represents the series resistance (Rs) is mainly associated with the serial resistance of ITO, the HTL and the perovskite layer. Specifically, the semicircle in the high-frequency range is correlated with the interfacial resistance (Rtrans) occurring at the perovskite layer with its interface with the HTL, while the semicircle in the low-frequency range corresponds to the recombination resistance (Rrec) at the interface of perovskite/HTL. From the fitting results of the equivalent circuit, the charge-transfer resistance (RTrans) values were found to be 203 and 125 Ω for the devices with the un-doped and the doped CuSCN, respectively. The low RTrans value denotes the improved interfacial contact between doped-CuSCN and the perovskite film, where the photo-generated hole carriers are efficiently extracted from the perovskite layer. Therefore, device analyses using IMPS, IMVS, and EIS analysis further confirmed that the F4TCNQ-doped CuSCN led to improved charge transport and reduced charge recombination at the interfaces in the devices to afford enhanced photovoltaic performance of inverted-type planar PSCs.
Finally, the stabilities of the devices with different HTLs were examined. First, for analysis of the operational stability under 1 sun illumination, stabilized power output of the devices was measured up to 600 s (Fig. S5†). The devices exhibited stabilized PCE values of 14.70% and 11.20% with the doped and the un-doped CuSCN, respectively, which meet the PCEs obtained from J–V curves. The plateau of the steady-state PCEs for the both devices indicates high operational stability of the devices with CuSCN regardless of the molecular doping. We then measured the long-term stability of the devices (Fig. S6†). The device with the F4TCNQ doping showed much better long-term stability under the same conditions as compared to the device with the pristine CuSCN. Furthermore, the PCE of the device with F4TCNQ is very stable, where the PCE maintains 94.0% of the initial value after 100 h in a glove box. Although the underlying mechanism for the different PCE decay of two devices is not clear yet, better device stability is another favourable property of molecular doping in CuSCN for practical applications of the perovskite solar cells.
4. Conclusions
In summary, this work proposes a strategy to optimize the electronic properties of CuSCN as a HTM for inverted-type planar PSCs via molecular doping using F4TCNQ. The sufficient electron transfer from F4TCNQ to CuSCN enabled much better energy level alignment, which led to efficient hole carrier transport and relatively reduced charge recombination as demonstrated by UPS and XPS investigations. Further device analyses also demonstrated the much-reduced charge transport resistance and elongated charge lifetime in the doped CuSCN-based devices. With the optimized doping concentration, the inverted-type planar PSCs achieved a PCE up to 15.01% which is enhanced by ∼35% as compared to the devices with a pristine CuSCN. It thus sheds light on understanding the intrinsic properties of molecular doping of CuSCN, which guides further investigation and improvement of photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs.
