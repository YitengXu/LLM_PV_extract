    , Accepted 1st September 2020First published on 2nd September 2020AbstractCo-catalysts such as precious metals are usually necessary to promote the photocatalytic generation of hydrogen from water through inhibiting the recombination of photo-generated carriers. However, precious metals are expensive and harmful to the environment. In this work, an ethylene glycol (EG) molecule, which was chemically anchored on SrTiO3 nanoparticles (EG@STO) via an in situ process, was used as a co-catalyst for the first time. The first-principles calculation shows that the EG molecule chemically anchored on SrTiO3 is beneficial for the directional migration of carriers and accelerates the hydrogen evolution reaction. A photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiency of 237 μmol g−1 h−1 was achieved with EG@STO, which is 19.5 times higher compared to that of SrTiO3. Moreover, EG@STO remained stable after 32 hours of reaction; in other words, the EG molecule is designed as a new type of efficient and stable co-catalyst, which provides an alternative approach for better semiconductor photocatalytic hydrogen reduction.
1. Introduction
Photo-driven splitting of water by semiconductor catalysis is an environmentally friendly way to convert solar power into chemical energy.1,2 The photocatalytic splitting of water is a multi-electron reaction, and the recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs that is prone to occur is the limiting process in this reaction.3,4 Therefore, a sacrificial reagent and a co-catalyst such as a noble metal are often used to promote the photocatalytic efficiency by inhibiting the carrier recombination. However, the use of a noble metal inevitably leads to a waste of resources and environmental pollution. In particular, the reagent for growing the co-catalyst will change the pH value of the reaction system, which is not suitable for splitting neutral water such as sea water.5 Therefore, finding a clean and low-cost co-catalyst has become the focus of active research.
In the past studies, ethylene glycol, as a small organic molecule, was often used to consume holes in the photocatalytic process, which promotes carrier separation. At the same time, ethylene glycol can adjust the viscosity of the reaction solution to control the morphology of the samples.6 It can also adjust the local electronic structure of the catalyst.7 Therefore, ethylene glycol has potential research value as a co-catalyst. On the other hand, SrTiO3 has been extensively studied for its material stability and proper band structure for water redox.8–10 Previous studies on the photocatalytic water decomposition properties of SrTiO3 mainly focused on size, morphology, interface structure, or heterojunction structures.11–13 Efficient water splitting is typically achieved by loading precious metals on the surface of SrTiO314 or adding acidic substances in the reaction process.15 The multi-step sample preparation in the above methods will increase the cost and the addition of a noble metal co-catalyst may cause environmental pollution.
In this work, ethylene glycol (EG) molecules have been coated on SrTiO3 nanoparticles (EG@STO) by the one-step solvothermal method. EG molecules were adsorbed on the sample surface as an electron acceptor, which can result in band bending at the SrTiO3 surface. The first-principles calculation shows that a potential difference is formed between EG and SrTiO3, which can promote the migration of photo-generated carriers and eventually promote water reduction. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate realized by EG@STO was 273 μmol g−1 h−1, which is far more efficient than that of pure STO. After 32 h of photocatalytic reaction, the catalytic effect and sample structure remained stable. This method has successfully realized the conversion of small organic molecules into environmental co-catalysts via an in situ process.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
Triethanolamine (TEOA), isopropyl alcohol, strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2), ethylene glycol (EG), nitric acid (HNO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), titanium butoxide (Ti(C4H9O)4) and membrane solution EG were chemically pure. The reagents mentioned above were purchased from Sinopharm.
2.2. Sample preparation

2.2.1. Preparation of EG chemically coated SrTiO3 (EG@STO-x) samples. 
EG@STO-x, in which x represents the content of EG added to the reaction, was synthesized via a solvothermal method. In the synthetic process, 3 mmol Ti(C4H9O)4 and 3 mmol Sr(NO3)2 were used as raw materials. We mixed them in 5 mL of HNO3 (4 mol L−1) solution, and then NaOH solution was added to the reaction mixture as a mineralizer; the resulting concentration of NaOH was 1.8 mol L−1. After the mixture was stirred for another 30 min, EG was added to the above solution. Finally, the solution was aged for 6 hours under air. The final precursor was heated at 180 °C for 24 hours in a stainless-steel autoclave (100 mL). The resulting product was filtered and washed with ethanol and distilled water to remove NaOH and the residual EG, and then the product was dried at 60 °C for several hours. Table 1 lists the names of different samples.

2.2.2. Preparation of EG/STO. 
For comparison, the EG/STO sample by physically mixing EG with STO was obtained. The EG of EG@STO-35 was removed by calcining it at 300 °C for 4 hours under an oxygen atmosphere. The calcining temperature was confirmed by the thermogravimetric (TG) curve of EG@STO-35. After being cooled to room temperature under an oxygen atmosphere, STO was transferred to a 30 mL EG solution and stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for one hour. The resulting sample was heated at 60 °C for 24 hours under vacuum conditions. Finally, the unabsorbed EG was removed by washing the sample with deionized water, and the sample was dried at 70 °C for 24 hours.

2.3. Catalyst characterization
The composition, purity, and crystal structure of the samples were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8200) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2011) were used to observe the morphologies of the samples. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of different samples were recorded using a UV-vis infrared spectrophotometer (SOLID3700). The specific surface areas of the samples were analyzed via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method (BET, Tristar II 3020M). The valence states of the component elements of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250), and the TG curve was determined using a thermogravimetric differential thermal analyzer (SDT Q600).
2.4. Photocatalytic measurement
The photocatalytic test was performed in a closed circulation system which was connected to an online gas chromatograph (GC-7900, TCD, Ar carrier). We used a xenon lamp (300 W) as the light source. The photocatalytic reactions were conducted with ultra-pure water. The photocatalyst (20 mg) was dispersed in a mixture of 80 mL water and 20 mL triethanolamine. The reactor was evacuated for 20 min before starting the reaction. The temperature of the mixed solution in the reaction process was maintained at 5 °C by circulating cooling water.
2.5. Electrochemical measurements
During the preparation of the electrode, first the catalyst (10 mg), membrane solution (100 μl), carbon black (5 mg), water (750 μl), and isopropyl alcohol (250 μl) were mixed. The mixture was evenly dispersed under ultrasonic conditions. We took 3 μL of the mixture and placed it on the glassy carbon electrode. An electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) was used to perform electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The performance was tested by applying an alternating current (AC) voltage with a 5 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz. The Mott–Schottky plots were obtained with an applied potential ranging from −1.5 V to 1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a frequency of 1000 Hz. The electrolyte solution was 0.5 M Na2SO4.
2.6. DFT calculation
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations of STO and EG@STO were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange–correlation contribution was employed. The cutoff energy of the plane-wave was 400 eV. First the geometric optimization of STO was performed. Then EG@STO was constructed by splitting STO along the (001) plane, followed by adding a 15 Å thick vacuum layer and enlarging to a 2 × 2 supercell, and the EG@STO cell was constructed by adding an EG molecule on the surface of the STO (001) supercell. The geometric optimization of EG@STO was performed by fixing atoms of the bottom layer. The k-point meshes of the Brillouin zone sampling for STO and EG@STO were set at 4 × 4 × 4 and 2 × 2 × 1, based on the Monkhorst–Pack scheme, respectively. A SCF tolerance of 1.0 × 10−6 eV per atom was taken as the electronic convergence criterion. The residual force was geometry-optimized to less than 0.01 eV Å−1. For the density of states (DOS) calculation, the k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone was 6 × 6 × 6 for STO and 3 × 3 × 1 for EG@STO (001).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structure analysis
As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD patterns of the samples have no impurity peak for SrTiO3. However, the crystallinity of EG@STO-35 decreased compared to that of EG@STO-0. There is no change in the bandgap structure and UV-visible absorption spectrum (Fig. 1b). Both EG@STO-0 and EG@STO-35 have apparent absorption edges at approximately 380 nm, corresponding to the bandgap at 3.28 eV (Fig. S1†). EG has a higher viscosity than water; therefore, the addition of EG in the sample preparation process will decrease the size of nanoparticles and change the morphology, which is shown by TEM images (Fig. 1c and d). The HRTEM images of STO and EG@STO-35 are shown in Fig. S2.† The lattice fringes of STO3 are clearly shown in the HRTEM images.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns (a), UV-vis absorbance spectra, the relationship between (αhν)2 and photon energy (embedded image) (b), and TEM images (c and d) of EG@STO-0 and EG@STO-35. 
The TG weight loss ratio of EG@STO-0 and EG@STO-35 is 2.075% and 2.859%, respectively (Fig. S3†). The weight loss of EG@STO-0 mainly comes from surface water and organic molecules. The weight loss of EG@STO-35 is caused by EG and water molecules. The infrared spectroscopy results show that there are obvious vibration peaks of C–O and –CH2 in the infrared spectrum of pure EG (Fig. 2a). This is also shown in the infrared spectrum of EG@STO-35 but not in that of EG@STO-0 (Fig. 2b). This indicates that the organic substance on the surface of EG@STO-35 is EG.7 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to further analyze the surface states of the samples. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s shows three peaks (C–C, C–O, CO), which correspond to 284.8, 286.0, and 288.5 eV respectively (Fig. 2(c and d)). It can be seen from the curve that the proportion of C–O increased significantly in EG@STO-35, which is consistent with the infrared spectrum.

3.2. Photocatalytic test and mechanism analysis
To verify the effect of EG on catalysis, EIS was conducted on samples to evaluate the surface resistance of the sample and the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers. As shown in Fig. S4,† the surface resistance of the sample loaded with ethylene glycol is greatly reduced compared to that of EG@STO-0, which is verified by the significantly reduced diameter of the Nyquist circle.16 This indicates that EG plays a crucial role in the spatial separation of carriers. In addition, the photocatalytic activities of EG@STO-0, EG/STO, and EG@STO-35 were measured by photocatalytic hydrogen production. Fig. 3 shows that EG@STO-0 has low photocatalytic hydrogen production. This is because the electron–hole pairs may recombine rapidly, and the reverse reaction of H2 and O2 to form water occurs at the same time. In contrast, 237 μmol g−1 h−1 was realized by EG@STO-35, which is 19.5 times higher compared to that of SrTiO3. Besides, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of EG/STO is 70 μmol g−1 h−1. The efficiency of EG@STO-35 is 3.4 times that of EG/STO. The hydrogen production improvements after loading with co-catalysts in the present work and previous reports are shown in Table 2, which highlight the excellent promoting effect of ethylene glycol on the hydrogen production rate of SrTiO3. Lactic acid, methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol were used to test the hydrogen production performance of EG@STO-35 (Fig. S5†). The difference in the catalytic effect may be due to the different oxidation potential of the sacrificial reagent and the adsorption capacity on the sample surface.

To study the effect of EG content on photocatalytic hydrogen production, we prepared a series of samples (EG@STO-x) by adjusting the proportion of EG in the synthetic process. All of the samples exhibit the STO phase, and the addition of EG decreases the crystallinity (Fig. 4a). The absorption edges of different samples are all at the position of 380 nm (Fig. S6†), which indicates that the bandgap structures of the samples are not changed. The SEM images of EG@STO-x in Fig. S7† show that the sample size decreased sharply after the addition of EG. However, increasing the proportion of EG only decreases the particle size slightly. Fig. S8† shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of EG@STO-x. The specific surface area of EG@STO-x (x = 0, 30, 35, 40) increases with the increase of EG, which is 8, 23.1, 27 and 36.7 m2 g−1, respectively. Fig. S9† shows the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of EG@STO-x. EG@STO-35 shows the highest photocatalytic performance, which indicates that the sample size is not the determinant of hydrogen production. With the increase of the EG ratio, these EG molecules will gradually cover the surface of SrTiO3 and decrease the number of active sites.27 Therefore, the catalytic effect of EG@STO-x (x = 0, 30, 35, 40) exhibits an increasing trend at first and then decreases. The same phenomenon has been observed in the metal load effect in previous studies.20 In order to verify the effect of EG on the surface, three samples were calcined at 300 °C in oxygen for two hours. The samples were named EG@STO-x-O2. We used TEOA as the sacrificial reagent to measure the catalytic effect of the samples. Fig. 4b shows the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of EG@STO-x-O2. After calcination, the catalytic effect of the samples decreased obviously, which proves that EG plays an important role in the catalytic process.

We characterized the stability of EG@STO, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. EG@STO-35 retains high photocatalytic activity after 32 h of reaction (Fig. 5a), which proves the excellent catalytic stability of this material. This is due to the stable chemical adsorption structure between EG and SrTiO3 during the solvothermal reaction. Fig. 5(b and c) show the XRD pattern and infrared spectra of EG@STO-35 before and after the 32 h tests. No impurity peaks appear in the XRD spectra. Besides, the IR absorption of EG is nearly of the same intensity, which confirms the stability of the photocatalyst.

The electron density distribution of EG@STO was modeled by first-principles calculation and confirmed by XPS. Fig. 6(a–c) show the structure model and the electron density difference distribution of EG@STO. Fig. 6(b and c) show that the electron density of O-37 which connects to STO is increased. Conversely, the electron density of the element near the surface of STO is decreased, and the detailed changes of the electron density are shown in Table S1.† The potential difference between the surface and the interior of STO can improve the separation efficiency of the photo-generated carriers and promote photocatalytic hydrogen production. The calculation results are verified by the XPS measurements in Fig. S9.† The peak positions of Sr 3d, Ti 2p, and O 1s have shifted by 0.4, 0.35, and 0.4 eV to the higher energy region, respectively, which is due to the decrease in the surface charge density of STO after coating with EG.

The potential difference between EG and SrTiO3 at the interface was obtained by first-principles calculation. This field effect will cause band bending, which has been proved by surface photovoltage (SPV)28 and photoluminescence (PL)29,30 methods. At the same time, the results showed that EG was adsorbed on the surface of SrTiO3 as an electron acceptor, which makes the band bend upward.31,32 In this case, the holes (h+) will flow to EG. In addition, we measured the band structure changes of the samples by the Mott–Schottky plot in order to better explain the catalytic mechanism of the samples. Fig. 7(a and b) represent the samples before and after loading EG. It can be seen from the figures that the slope of the curve is positive, which indicates that the samples are n-type semiconductors. The flat band potentials for EG@STO-0 and EG@STO-35 are −0.66 eV and −0.74 eV, respectively. The position of the bottom of the conduction band is usually 0.1 eV higher than that of the flat band potential. So, the positions of the bottom of the conduction band of EG@STO-0 and EG@STO-35 are −0.76 eV and −0.84 eV, respectively. This shows that the band will bend upward after EG loading. In this case, the holes (h+) will flow to EG as shown in the Fig. 7c below.

The photocatalytic reaction process is shown in Fig. 8. EG is attached chemically to SrTiO3 by the solvothermal method. The chemical connection causes the direct conduction of charge between SrTiO3 and EG.33 Electron–hole pairs are produced by SrTiO3 under illumination. Ultimately, these holes are transferred to EG and are involved in the oxidation of the sacrificial reagent. The remaining electrons in the conduction band of SrTiO3 will trigger the water-splitting reaction and generate hydrogen. The stable chemical binding results in good catalytic stability of the sample and eliminates the influence of the depletion layer on carrier transport.

4. Conclusions
In summary, STO nanoparticles anchored with EG molecules were prepared by the one-step solvothermal method. The samples showed efficient and stable performance in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Photocatalytic tests and theoretical calculations verified that EG boosts the directional migration of photo-generated carriers, and greatly promotes the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production. This represents a simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly catalyst synthetic solution for photocatalytic hydrogen production, which provides a new scenario for the study of photocatalysis.
