As both polarity and vapour pressure of the treatment solvent for perovskite increase, luminance increases and the wavelength of the photoluminescence emission peak decreases due to enhanced crystallinity and reduced grain size.
After a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite dye-sensitized solar cell was first reported by A. Kojima et al. in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-solid organometallic halide perovskite (MAPbX3, here, MA = CH3NH3+, X = Cl−, Br−, I−) solar cells has been continuously increasing and has reached 22%.1–7 Recently, these research interests have been extended to the application of organometallic halide perovskite as an emissive material for light emitting diodes (LEDs) due to its outstanding opto-electronic properties, such as high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (PLQY, approximately 80%), a narrow full width half maximum (FWHM) of PL emission (<20 nm), and easy band gap tunability from visible to near infrared range through halide anion exchange.8–13 After the first CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite LED was reported by Friend et al. at Cambridge in 2014, the performance of perovskite LEDs has rapidly improved, resulting in the realization of the maximum external quantum efficiency of 20%.14,15
To use organometallic halide perovskite as an efficient emissive layer in LEDs, the crystal grain size of perovskite should be controlled to enhance the radiative recombination. Small crystal grain size facilitates the excitons to be spatially well-confined, and thereby prohibits the diffusion of excitons or charge carriers, resulting in reduced exciton dissociation. For these reasons, many studies on perovskite LEDs have focused on controlling the crystal grain size of perovskite with high reliability and reproducibility. For example, nanocrystal pinning and solvent-vacuum drying are well known efficient methods for obtaining small crystal grains by limiting crystal growth.16,17 H. Cho et al. reported the reduction of crystal grain size (approximately 100 nm) and enhancement of film uniformity through the nanocrystal pinning method using small organic molecules. The optimized perovskite film with small crystal grains showed dramatic PLQY enhancement (approximately 36%). These results provide overall insight on how to control the crystal grain size and its influences on the optical properties of perovskite.
It is well known that humidity (moisture) is one of the major triggers in the decomposition of organometallic halide perovskites. G. Niu et al. have reported that exposure of perovskite to moisture dramatically reduced the crystallinity and degraded its optical properties.18 The high polarity of the H2O molecule strongly interacts with the organometallic cation, which is hygroscopic in nature, resulting in the production of defect states, which leads to poor crystallinity and PLQY.19,20 However, contrary to conventional understanding, several recent reports have claimed that moderate humidity could improve crystallinity and film quality, resulting in PL intensity enhancement.21–23
For example, G. Eperon et al. reported that simple exposure of perovskite film to moisture by post treatment could result in a 6-fold increase in PL intensity compared to a N2 environment.21 J. Liu et al. processed the post solvent annealing by exposing perovskite films to vapour of solvents with different polarity and explained the effect of solvent vapour on crystal growth and opto-electrical property change.24 In addition, it has also been reported that polar solvent promotes the conversion of lead halide and methyl halide into perovskite.25,26 In this regard, it is expected that the polar solvent treatment including H2O under fine control will be a promising method to improve the opto-electrical properties of perovskite.
However, to the best of our knowledge, comprehensive understanding and reasonable explanation regarding the effects of polar solvent treatments on the changes of optical as well as crystal structural properties of perovskite film are not clearly demonstrated despite their importance. Moreover, detailed mechanisms for controlling crystal grain size variation and related optical property changes have not yet been reported. For maximizing polar solvent treatment effects that improve perovskite LED performances, a systematic study on the effects of polarity and vapour pressure of solvents on PL intensity, crystal grain size, and crystallinity of perovskite is necessary.
In this work, perovskite films were prepared by a vapour-assisted solution process (VASP).27 We investigated the effects of moisture (H2O) and various polar solvents on the crystal structure and optical properties of perovskite and propose a novel reliable method to control crystal grain size and crystallinity of perovskite for the purpose of optimizing PL emission properties with the aid of the solvent vapour annealing (SVA) process. The mechanism of crystallinity and crystal grain size changes in perovskite film was investigated through the fine control of experimental conditions, such as polarity, vapour pressure, and exposure time of the solvent used for post annealing. It was observed that the exposure of pristine perovskite film to polar solvent with high polarity and vapour pressure resulted in the splitting of sub-microscale crystal grains into nano-sized grains, and thus caused quantum confinement effects. The PL spectrum was blueshifted approximately 50 nm, and approximately 100 times higher PL intensity was observed. Also, the SVA process promotes conversion of the unreacted and remaining PbBr2 and CH3NH3Br into CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite. Once the SVA processing time exceeded the critical time, the crystal grain size of perovskite was found to increase again, which results in a dramatic decrease in PL intensity. Notably, the SVA process is reversible and repeatable. These results clearly demonstrated that crystallinity and crystal grain size of perovskite, which affect the optical properties of perovskite, can be accurately controlled by adjusting the polarity, vapour pressure, and exposure time of the solvent used for post annealing.

Scheme 1 shows an illustration of the SVA process. When polar solvent droplets are placed around a CH3NH3PbBr3 film in a closed Petri dish, the infiltrated polar solvent solvates CH3NH3+ through solvent–solute hydrogen bond interactions. Thereafter, the Petri dish was uncovered to evaporate the solvent, resulting in recrystallization of CH3NH3PbBr3 film. After the SVA process, the perovskite film showed highly luminescent green emission under ultraviolet (UV) light (Fig. S1†). The detailed SVA process is described in Video S1 in the ESI.†

Results and discussion
Ethanol (EtOH), water (H2O), dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were used as solvents for the SVA process. The polarity and vapour pressure values of the solvents are listed in Table 1. As previously reported, crystallinity and crystal grain size, which affect the PL properties of perovskite, can be influenced by the two main parameters of solvents: polarity and vapour pressure.21,24 As the polarity and vapour pressure of the solvent increased, it was expected that perovskite would show high PL intensity due to high crystallinity and small crystal grain size. Among various solvents, water and ethanol exhibited the highest polarity and vapour pressure, respectively. The perovskite film treated with water produced the highest PL intensity among the perovskite films treated by polar solvents. The PL intensity was found to be enhanced by approximately 100 times compared to that of pristine perovskite film that did not undergo the SVA process. However, the PL intensity of perovskite film treated by ethanol was slightly higher than that of pristine perovskite film. This result implies that the major factor that influences PL intensity is not vapour pressure but solvent polarity. The methylammonium cations (CH3NH3+) solvated by polar solvent migrate inside the perovskite crystal structure and induce recrystallization with curing of the defect states.21 Consequently, the decrease in defect state density reduces the trap-mediated non-radiative recombination, and causes additional radiative recombination.

To verify exciton recombination dynamics, time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) experiments on the SVA-treated films with various solvents (EtOH, DMF, and DMSO) were conducted (Fig. S2†). The PL lifetimes and fractional intensities of perovskite films are summarized in Table S1.† As expected, the τ1 (slow PL decay) values that originated from radiative recombination in the SVA-treated films are consistent with the PL intensity changes observed in Fig. 3(a).
Furthermore, propanol (isopropyl alcohol), which shows low polarity index (3.9) with high vapour pressure (44 mmHg) among alcohols, was tested as an SVA solvent. The PL intensity and PL peak position of propanol-treated perovskite were identical to that of pristine perovskite (Fig. S3†). Consequently, it was confirmed that recrystallization through ion migration would not occur if the solvation process did not take place in advance. In addition, the solvation of methylammonium also induced conversion of unreacted and remaining lead halide and methylammonium halide into perovskite, which contributes to the PL intensity enhancement.25 The degree of conversion is determined by the polarity of the solvent, and it will be confirmed in the XRD results section.

Fig. 1(b) shows the PL intensity vs. polarity of SVA solvents. It follows the general trend of polarity dependence on PL intensity, except for the film treated with DMSO, which has the lowest vapour pressure. This suggested that the polarity of the solvent is not the only parameter that determines the PL intensity of perovskite, but the vapour pressure also affects the PL intensity of perovskite. Higher vapour pressure induced faster solvent evaporation during the recrystallization process, and it produced small crystal grains,24 (Fig. S4†) which bring about PL intensity enhancement of perovskite by higher exciton binding energy that stems from the quantum confinement effect. It also leads to widening of band gap energy, resulting in a blueshift of PL emission.

Fig. 1(c) shows the normalized PL spectra of CH3NH3PbBr3 films treated with various SVA solvents with different vapour pressures. The PL peak gradually moves to shorter wavelengths with more volatile solvents in the order of DMSO (533 nm) < DMF (531 nm) < pristine (530 nm) < H2O (529 nm) < ethanol (528 nm). Fig. 1(d) explains this consistency very well. The CH3NH3PbBr3 film treated with ethanol shows the most blueshifted PL, which demonstrated that it has the smallest crystal grain. However, ethanol exhibited both relatively low polarity and solubility for PbBr2, resulting in low conversion efficiency of unreacted and remaining precursors to perovskite, and thus induced relatively low PL enhancement despite its high vapour pressure. Perovskite films treated with the other two solvents (DMF and DMSO), which have relatively low vapour pressure due to a high boiling point (153, 189 °C), showed 1–3 nm longer PL wavelength because the vapour can remain inside the film for a longer period of time, resulting in remarkable crystal growth.24 Because longer solvent evaporation time induces larger crystal grains of perovskite film and reduced PL intensity, relatively higher vapour pressure of DMF led to higher PL intensity of perovskite film than that of DMSO. However, note that the PL intensity of perovskite treated by the SVA process is primarily affected by the solvation effect (polarity) but not by the quantum confinement effect (vapour pressure), even though it cannot be ignored.
The effect of polar solvent treatment on the crystallinity of perovskite was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 2(a) presents normalized XRD peaks of PbBr2, pristine, and polar solvent (H2O)-treated perovskite films. The typical XRD peak originating from the (100) plane of CH3NH3PbBr3 appears at 14.8°. After SVA, the intensity of the (100) peak increased by approximately 6 times, which is direct evidence of an increase in the crystallinity (Fig. 2(b)). The degree of crystallinity can be estimated by the following equation:28 (1)where C (%) is the degree of crystallinity, and AC and AA are the area of the XRD peak for crystalline and amorphous signals, respectively. Based on this equation, the crystallinity of the film increased from 17% to 96% after the SVA process. Notably, the peak at 11.8° that originated from PbBr2 in pristine perovskite disappears after SVA.29 This shows that the SVA process promotes conversion of unreacted and remaining PbBr2 and CH3NH3Br into CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite. This conversion behaviour of SVA solvents was analysed by comparison of the Br/Pb ratio on the top and bottom side of the perovskite film (Fig. S5†).
 Fig. 2  (a) Normalized XRD peaks of PbBr2, pristine, and H2O-treated CH3NH3PbBr3 films. (b) XRD intensity of pristine and H2O-treated CH3NH3PbBr3 films. 
The conversion efficiency strongly depends on the polarity of the SVA solvent. Fig. S6† shows the XRD pattern of perovskite treated with DMF. Unlike the XRD result obtained from perovskite treated with H2O, DMF-treated perovskite film still shows the PbBr2 peak, indicating that the polarity of DMF is insufficient for the perfect conversion of unreacted and remaining precursors. The PL intensity enhancement after DMF treatment is approximately 70 times; however, it is still lower than that of perovskite film treated with H2O. These results verify that the polarity of the SVA solvent is a critical factor for increasing the crystallinity of perovskite as well as conversion of unreacted and remaining precursors.
The CH3NH3PbBr3 film treated with water (H2O) shows the highest PL intensity due to contributions from both the solvation and quantum confinement effects. It also possesses sufficient vapour pressure to change the crystal grain size of perovskite in addition to converting the unreacted and remaining precursors into perovskite. However, until now, most of the previous reports simply describe the effect of H2O on PL intensity enhancement only, which lacks comprehensive understanding and reasonable explanation regarding the effects of polar solvent treatment on crystallinity, crystal grain size, and changes in optical properties (e.g., PL shift).22 Hence, we investigated the relationship between crystal grain size variation and the changes in the optical properties of perovskite by controlling the SVA process time. (2)

Fig. 3(a) presents the evolution of the PL spectra of CH3NH3PbBr3 film as a function of SVA time. For clear understanding, four different stages were defined depending on H2O exposure time (pristine, SVA I, SVA II, and SVA III). The SEM images corresponding to each stage are represented in Fig. 3(b)–(e). The as-prepared (pristine) perovskite film showed various sizes of perovskite crystal grains. Micrometre-sized crystal grains are responsible for the main PL emission at approximately 530 nm. Despite the presence of small grains, the contribution of these to the PL intensity is limited due to the poor crystallinity of the film, which induces non-radiative recombination of generated excitons. In addition, the high concentration of trap states near the pinhole can be another factor contributing to the low PL intensity. At the outset of the SVA process (between pristine and SVA I), blueshift of the PL peak and enhanced luminance were observed. The deconvolution of the double-peak PL at the SVA I stage reveals that there are two separate peaks at 484 nm (2.56 eV) and 514 nm (2.41 eV) (Fig. S7†). These behaviours imply that H2O molecules might penetrate into the pinholes in the perovskite film and split microscale crystal grains into nano-sized grains. The PL emission energy of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals, higher than that of bulk MAPbBr3, resulted from the quantum confinement effect and can be described by the following eqn (2).30

E
QCE denotes the energy gap of perovskite taking into account the quantum confinement effect, and D denotes the mean grain size (nm) of perovskite crystal. For the two separate PL peaks at 484 nm and 514 nm, the grain size (D) was calculated to be approximately 8.4 nm and 24.5 nm, respectively. The perovskite film at SVA I (Fig. 3(c)) evidently shows an entirely different morphology compared to that of pristine perovskite film. The grain size of the crystal is approximately 25–30 nm, which is consistent with the calculated crystal grain size from eqn (2). Because the upper part of the perovskite film was exposed longer to H2O vapour, small sized nanocrystals (approximately 8.4 nm) in that part are aggregated and have formed relatively larger crystal grains (25–30 nm) due to the merging of grain boundaries caused by moisture.31 The estimated 8.4 nm-sized perovskite crystal grains were verified by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S8†). Because of the reduced grain size, the exciton binding energy of SVA I film (79.3 meV) was much higher than that of pristine film (16.6 meV) (Fig. S9†).
As the process time reached the SVA II stage, the PL spectrum was redshifted, and the PL intensity was maximized (Fig. 3(d)) due to reduction of defect states by the merging of grain boundaries and maximized conversion efficiency of unreacted and remaining precursors (Fig. 2 and Fig. S10†). The maximized PLQY of SVA II reached 26%, while that of the pristine film was not detectable (PLQY < 1%).
This recrystallization process can be explained by phase transition from liquid–solid to solid phase under a humid environment.24 A prolonged SVA process promotes the liquid–solid phase transition, which results in the formation of aggregated large crystal grains (>6 μm) in the perovskite film. From these results, it was confirmed that the SVA process consists of two different recrystallization processes: the splitting and merging of crystal grains. Fig. S11† shows a photograph of PL of perovskite films treated with different SVA times.
To reveal that the PL intensity (PLQY) enhancement resulted from reduction of defect states in perovskite through recrystallization, the TCSPC experiments were conducted. Fig. 4 represents the PL decay profiles of perovskite films with different SVA times. The PL emission decay profiles of perovskite films are expressed by a bi-exponential fitting, which suggests that PL decay of perovskite took place by two relaxation pathways. The PL lifetimes and fractional intensities of perovskite films are summarized in Table 2. Even though debate still exists regarding the origin of each PL decay, it is generally defined as follows: fast PL decay originates from trap-assisted recombination at grain boundaries, while slow PL decay is related to radiative recombination inside the grains.16,32–34 Generally, it is well known that grain boundaries and excessive Pb atoms act as non-radiative trap sites. Pristine perovskite film showed a high fraction (55%) of short PL decay lifetimes (τ2, 0.41 ns) due to a higher defect state density. As SVA is processed, the fraction and PL lifetime of radiative recombination increases until it reaches SVA II and decreases thereafter. This result is consistent with the PL intensity changes observed in Fig. 3(a).

Perovskite film at the SVA II stage, which shows maximum PL intensity, has only approximately 12% of fraction originated from defect state, and lifetime of τ1 originated from radiative recombination increases to 35.3 ns, which is almost 10 times longer than that of pristine perovskite. This result directly shows that polar solvent treatment enhances radiative recombination by reducing the defect state density at grain boundaries through recrystallization.
It is a noteworthy fact that the SVA process is reversible and repeatable, which indicates that perovskite changes its phase from liquid–solid to solid nanocrystal under humid and dry conditions, respectively [Video S1†]. The CH3NH3PbBr3 film was sealed in a Petri dish with H2O droplets and placed under UV light to monitor the PL intensity and wavelength changes in real time. The droplets caused the Petri dish to fill with H2O vapour, and this induced the phase transition of perovskite from the solid phase to the liquid–solid phase.24 When the vapour was released by opening the Petri dish, the recrystallized perovskite in the liquid–solid phase turned to solid nanocrystal, which shows strong PL intensity due to high crystallinity with high exciton binding energy that originated from the small crystal grain size, in addition to the improved conversion efficiency of the unreacted and remaining precursors into perovskite. This reversible and repeatable recrystallization, converting solid-state perovskite to the liquid–solid phase by solvent vapour and turning it back to the solid phase again through solvent evaporation, is the most dominant factor for changing the photo-physical properties of perovskite film.
It has been reported that the interaction distance between methylammonium cation (CH3NH3+) and solvents, namely, the interactions between oxygen atoms in the solvent and hydrogen atoms of CH3NH3+ in perovskite, predominantly determines the reversibility and repeatability of this crystallinity process.32 The theoretical calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) was conducted to determine the interaction distance between solvent molecules and methylammonium cation. The calculated values are summarized in Fig. S12 and Table S2.† The shortest interaction distance with methylammonium cation was 1.18 Å, for H2O, as calculated by DMol3, and this was consistent with a previously reported result.35 As shown in Table S2,† the interaction distance increased from 1.18 to 3.24 Å by decreasing the polarity of the solvent, even though it is not perfectly proportional to it. From these results, it is suspected that the weak polarity of the solvent reduced the interaction strength between solvents and CH3NH3+ ions, resulting in an easily reversible recrystallization process. In contrast to previous reports, perovskite films treated in this study with polar solvents exhibited a reversible recrystallization process.35 This discrepancy might have originated due to differences in perovskite film fabrication methods. It will be further investigated in a future study.
Conclusions
In summary, we confirmed that polar solvent treatment leads to luminance enhancement of organometallic halide perovskites through two simultaneous processes: recrystallization and conversion of the unreacted and remaining precursors into perovskite. Also, the correlation between the crystal grain size of the perovskite and SVA solvent properties, polarity, and vapour pressure, has been systematically investigated and discussed. As both the polarity and vapour pressure of the SVA solvent increase, the PL intensity of perovskite increases due to the high crystallinity and small crystal grain size through recrystallization of microscale crystal grains into nano-sized grains. Water (H2O), which is abundant and eco-friendly, was the most suitable solvent for the SVA process with halide perovskite, which resulted in outstanding PL intensity enhancement (approximately 100 times brighter luminance and approximately 5.6 times higher crystallinity confirmed by XRD). Our findings clearly show that the optical properties of perovskite can be controlled by adjusting the polarity, vapour pressure, and exposure time of the post-annealing solvent. This study paves the way for realizing organometallic halide perovskite-based light emitters with high luminance and proper colour.
