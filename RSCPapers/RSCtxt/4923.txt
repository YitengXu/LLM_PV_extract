    , Accepted 3rd March 2006First published on 24th March 2006AbstractNanometric particles of pure brookite TiO2 were synthesized by modified thermolysis of reactant solutions containing titania powder, HCl, urea and PEG 10000. Unique flower-like brookite agglomerates with an average diameter of ∼400–450 nm composed of single brookite nanocrystals of ∼4–5 nm were obtained at 105 °C. The brookite → rutile transformation has been studied and TiO2 mixtures with variable amount of anatase, brookite and rutile polymorphs at different temperatures (from 200 to 800 °C) were obtained. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron diffraction pattern and BET/BJH analyses were used to characterize the phase assemblages, crystallite size and pore volume of the pure-phase brookite and TiO2 mixtures. In order to understand the metastable–stable TiO2 phase transformation X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed. The photoactivity of pure brookite and TiO2 powders with different compositions of the brookite–anatase–rutile and anatase–rutile polymorphs obtained during the transitions was examined by photocatalyzed degradation of 4-chlorophenols in aqueous solution. The titania sample having the highest catalytic activity was obtained at 500 °C, contained 3.2% brookite, 42.9% anatase and 53.9% rutile and is referred to as TiO[B])/500 .
1. Introduction
It is well known that titanium dioxide is a semiconductor which crystallizes in three polymorphic forms: rutile (tetragonal, space group P42/mnm), anatase (tetragonal, space group I41/amd) and brookite (orthorhombic, space group Pbca).1 Rutile is the only stable form, whereas anatase and brookite are metastable and transform to rutile when they are heated. All crystallographic forms of nanocrystalline TiO2 are of great importance from the view point of applications. Nanosized titanium dioxide materials have been the focus of great interest because they exhibit modified physical-chemical properties in comparison with its bulk. Titania nanocrystals have received great attention in recent years for their extensive applications in conventional catalyst support, optics, cosmetics and solar cells. Attention has also been focused on the photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds in aqueous solution containing a suspension of TiO2. In line with current environmental problems, the ability of a combination of adsorption and TiO2-based heterogeneous photocatalysis has been studyed by Ilisz et al.2 and photocatalytic water treatment with different TiO2 nanoparticles was performed. Significant results concerning characterization of clay mineral intercalated TiO2 into interlamellar space as an environmentally friendly water treatment technology has been reported by Mogyorosi et al.3
It is well documented that the anatase polymorph has the highest photoactivity compared to the brookite or rutile polymorphs.4 However, the most commercially active photocatalyst Degussa P25 is a three-phase mixture of the amorphous, anatase and rutile forms of TiO2 arranged in a complex microstructure, anatase constitutes the greatest volume fraction of approximately 80%.5 Many researchers attempted to prepare efficient photocatalysts similar to Degussa and understand the metastable thermodynamically stable phase.6–8
The use and performance of mixed TiO2 polymorphs in photocatalytic applications are strongly influenced by the microstructure: polymorph structure, particle size, crystallite size, degree of crystallinity, morphology, specific surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution.
Since the anatase–rutile transformation has been examined extensively and information on this transition may be found in the literature6,9,10 there has been only one paper concerning the conversion scheme from pure brookite to rutile.11 The difficulty in studying this conversion is the avoidance of satellite phases (anatase and rutile) and thus obtaining a pure phase brookite.
Brookite was reported to be a high-pressure TiO2 phase and was synthesized from aqueous or organic media via hydrothermal preparation. For the first time Nagase et al.12 reported hydrothermal synthesis of brookite as an almost single phase at 200 °C with a TiO2 : NaOH mole ratio ≈ 1. Brookite was considered to be formed from sodium titanate by releasing Na+ and H+ from the surface accompanied by oxidation of Ti in the structure. The hydrothermal technique was also used by Zheng et al.13 The authors reported the titania powder in pure brookite forms prepared by hydrothermal treatment of Ti(SO4)2 and TiCl4 in aqueous solution: gel obtained from Ti(SO4)2 solution precipitated by NaOH leads to formation of brookite. The high acidity of titanium tetrachloride solution favors the formation of the brookite phase. Hydrothermal synthesis is widely used to enhance crystallinity, however, many factors (e.g. reaction time, reaction temperature and the medium), may influence the crystallization process.
The three polymorphs of TiO2 can be synthesized by thermolysis of TiCl4 or TiCl3 in an aqueous medium and the control of the precipitation conditions (acidity, nature of anions, ionic strength titanium concentration, etc.) allows control of the crystalline structure, size and morphology of particles.
Koelsch and Pottier14,15 published a quasi-quantitative formation of brookite nanoparticles in an aqueous medium without strong complexing agents and non-hydrothermal conditions. The authors prepared the nanometric particles of brookite by thermolysis of TiCl4 in concentrated HCl solution. The complex Ti(OH)2(Cl)2(OH2)2 seems to be the precursor of the brookite phase. Depending on the acidity and the ageing time, spheroidal particles or platelets are obtained.
Li et al.16 synthesized pure-phase brookite of high crystallinity under ambient pressure at 70 °C by reacting a mixed solution of urea and TiCl3.The resultant particles are monodispersed spheres composed of brookite nanocrystals, which are stable in terms of phase purity and morphology up to 500 °C. The same authors reported the brookite → rutile phase transformation11 and claimed that the transition mainly proceeds within the individual particles in the temperature range 500–600 °C, without detection of the anatase polymorph.
The main objectives of our paper were (i) to determine under what conditions it is possible to obtain pure-phase nanosized brookite, (ii) to examine the performance of brookite as a photocatalyst using the photocatalyzed degradation of 4-chlorophenols in aqueous solution, (iii) to study the transformation brookite–rutile and explore as obtained TiO2 phase mixtures as photocatalysts (iv) understanding of the effect of microstructure on the photocatalytic properties of semiconducting nano-sized powders such as TiO2.
We obtained single phase brookite via simple modification of the precipitation reaction: a solution containing urea and PEG 10000 was mixed with TiCl3, prepared separately with titania powder and concentrated HCl. The main object of our study is to provide design criteria for synthesis of new and efficient mixed TiO2 photocatalysts. Titanium dioxide nanosized powders with varying compositions of brookite–anatase–rutile and anatase–rutile were isolated by carefully controlling the treatment temperature of the as precipitated brookite. In our investigation the effects of the mixed TiO2 phases and the microstructure have been discussed in relation of the photocatalytic activity. Attention has been paid not only to crystal structure, but also to BET surface area, particle size, porosity and the effect of the individual brookite, anatase and rutile particles on the photoactivity. The kinetics of the disappearance of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) in aqueous suspension was used as a test reaction. The kinetic analysis was understood in terms of modified (for solid–liquid reactions) Langmuir–Hinshewood kinetic treatment.17 This mechanism results in pseudo first order kinetics at the photostationary state. The order reaction constant for degradation of 4-CP in water suspension for several half-lives was calculated.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of brookite-type nanocrystals
The pure brookite TiO2 (sample denoted as TiO[B]) was prepared as follows. A solution of titanium (III) chloride was obtained by dissolving of 2.8 g of titanium powder (99.7%, purchased from Aldrich) in 100 ml of diluted (1 ∶ 1) hydrochloric acid under reflux. 10 ml of as prepared titanium (III) chloride solution was added to a second solution formed by 50 g polyethyleneglycol (PEG 10 000), 1000 g urea and water and preheated to 50 °C for 1 h. The final solution was heated to 90 °C under rapid stirring (magnetic stirrer IKA Labortechnik, RW 16 basic, 600 rot min−1) and kept at this temperature for 4 h until pH 7,2 was reached and while ammonia escaped. The precipitate formed was washed with distilled water, filtered off and dried at 105 °C in a laboratory furnace for 1 h. As prepared precipitate (sample TiO[B]) was heated over a wide temperature interval from 200 to 800 °C in order to find the phase transition temperature for brookite → rutile. Heating was continued for 3 h at 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C in a laboratory muffle furnace at a rate of 10 °C min−1and seven new samples TiO[B])/200, TiO[B])/300, TiO[B])/400, TiO[B])/500, TiO[B])/600, TiO[B])/700 and TiO[B])/800 were isolated (see Table 1).The samples have been named according to the calcination temperature of pure brookite.

2.2 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns obtained on a Siemens D5005 powder diffractometer operating in the reflection mode with Cu Kα radiation at a step scan mode of 2θ = 0.02° and 2.4 s per step were used to determine the identity of any polymorph present, the structural evolution during heating of the starting brookite power and crystallite size of all synthesized TiO2 mixtures. The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 45 mA, respectively. The phase content of a sample can be calculated from the integrated intensities of the anatase (101), rutile (110) and brookite (121) peaks. If a sample contains only anatase and rutile, the mass fraction of rutile (Wr) can be calculated from18  
Here Aa and Ar represent the integrated intensity of the anatase (101) and rutile (110) peaks, respectively. When brookite is present in a sample Zhang18 and Gribb19 modified the equation as:       where Wa and Wb represent the weight fraction of anatase and brookite, respectively and Ab the integrated intensity of the brookite (121) peak. The authors introduced the optimized correction coefficients Ka and Kb which have values of 0.886 and 2.721, respectively. The average crystalline sizes of all TiO2 polymorphs were determined according to the Scherrer equation20 using the FWHM data of each phase.
Qualitative analysis were performed with Philips XPERT computer programs and the JCPDS PDF-2 database.21 The crystal size was estimated from the line broadening of corresponding X-Ray powder diffraction peaks using Scherrer equation (d = kλ/βcosθ), where k is a shape factor of the particles (it is 1 if a spherical shape is assumed), λ and θ are the wavelength and the incident angle of the X-rays, respectively.
Transmission electron micrographs were obtained using a JEOL JEM 3010 microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The samples for electron microscopy were prepared by grinding and subsequent dispersal of the powder in propanol and applying a drop of very dilute suspension on carbon-coated grids. The suspension was dried by slow evaporation at ambient temperature.
The specific surface area of the samples was determined by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature using the Coulter SA 3100 instrument, outgassing for 15 min. at 120 °C. The specific surface area was calculated by the BET method, while pore size distributions (pore diameter and pore volume) were measured from the N2 desorption isotherm using the cylindrical pore model (BJH).
Photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol
The kinetics of the decay of a solution of 0.1377 mM 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) in 70 mL of aerated aqueous suspension of mixtures were monitored. 4-chlorophenol (99%) was purchased from Fluka and used without further purification. The laboratory irradiation experiments were performed in a photoreactor constructed in our laboratory.22 This consists of two coaxial quartz tubes placed in the centre of a steel cylinder having aluminum foil covering its inner wall. Inner quartz tube (diameter 24 mm, length 300 mm) was filled with the suspension (70 mL) under investigation and magnetically stirred. Cooling water circulates between the inner and the outer quartz tube to keep the temperature constant at 20 °C. The UV irradiation source was a high-pressure mercury lamp enclosed in a glass filter bulb (HPW, 125 W, Philips) having emission consisting of up to 93% 365 nm radiation. It was placed close to the quartz tubes. By the means of ferrioxalate actinometry, the average light intensity entering the volume of 50–70 mL of the irradiated solution was determined to be I0 = 5.3 × 10−5 Einstein dm−3 s−1.
Probes of irradiated suspensions (1 mL) were taken at appropriate irradiation times. The solid photocatalyst (necessarily together with the adsorbed portions of the dissolved molecular species) was removed before HPLC, employing filtration by a Millipore syringe adapter (diameter 13 mm) with filter 408 (porosity 0.45 µm). The HPLC experiments were run on a Merck device with an L-6200 intelligent pump, L-3000 photo diode array detector and a DataApex Clarity station. Mobile phase methanol : water (2 ∶ 3, v/v) and a Merck column LiChroCART 1254 filled with LiChrosphere 100 RP-18 (5 mm) were used, the injection loop was 20 µL, flow rate 1 mL min−1 and detection wavelength 280 nm. The kinetic analysis was understood in terms of modified (for solid–liquid reactions) Langmuir–Hinshewood kinetic treatment. This mechanism results in pseudo first order kinetics at the photostationary state. The order reaction constant for photodegradation of 4-chlorophenol in water suspension was calculated.
Irradiation experiment
70 mg of the investigated photocatalyst sample were quantitatively transferred, using 63 mL of distilled water, into the inner tube of the photoreactor and kept in dark for about 1 h. Then, 7 mL of 0.001 M stock solution of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) were added, making the total volume up to 70 mL. The prepared suspension was then magnetically stirred for about 1 h in the dark to achieve the adsorption equilibrium. After this, 1 mL was taken as a blank probe before irradiation and, after filtration of the catalyst, injected for the HPLC analysis. Next, the inner tube was put into the photoreactor and irradiation started. At appropriate irradiation times, 1 mL probes of the irradiated suspension were taken and analyzed by HPLC in the same way as the blank probe. To complete a set of HPLC measurements for one particular photocatalyst sample, 0.001 M 4-CP solution in water was analyzed under the same conditions. After finishing the HPLC set for the particular photocatalyst sample, the concentrations of 4-CP were plotted as a function of the irradiation time. In some cases, additional manual corrections of the concentrations of 4-CP were performed. Microcal software Origin, ver. 7.5,23 was used for this purpose.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 X-Ray diffraction
The characteristic parts of XRD patterns of the pure phase brookite (sample TiO[B])) and the solid post-products of its thermal treatment at 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C are displayed in Fig. 1 (a–h). Trace (a) is the pattern of the precipitate recovered after 4 h of precipitation and dried at 105 °C in a laboratory furnace for 1 h. The positions of all diffraction lines and distribution of intensities can be indexed to the brookite polymorph and corresponds to ICDD PDF card 29–1360 (ref. 21). Some residuals of H2Ti3O7 (ICDD PDF 47–0561) are also observed in this pattern. The XRD pattern of the powder heated at 200 °C reveals the brookite (120) and emerging peaks of anatase (101) and rutile (110), indicating that the sample TiO[B])/200 is a mixture of all TiO2 polymorphs—87.5% brookite, 7.5% anatase and 5.0% rutile (see Table 1). Calcination at 300 °C resulted in virtually no change in the relative intensity of all peaks, while after calcinations at 400 and 500 °C the intensity peaks significantly increased. The powder TiO[B])/500 made at 500 °C was highly crystalline and exhibits sharp XRD lines (trace (e)) without sings of broadening. Sample TiO[B])/500 contains 3.2% brookite, 42.9% anatase and 53.9% rutile. From the data obtained we can see that increase of both anatase and rutile crystallite size was observed after calcinations at 500 °C. In our case as the calcination temperature increases, the amount of rutile grows progressively, while the amount of anatase reached a maximum at 500 °C and after this temperature a significant decrease was registered. We suppose that the mixture TiO[B])/200 consists of titania nanocrystals with some amorphous domains located between them. On increasing the temperature up to 500 °C, existing small anatase nuclei rapidly grow out by crystallization of the amorphous fraction to anatase nanorystallites. This fact seems to be a main reason for production of 42.9% anatase after calcination at500 °C. Bigger anatase nanocrystals transform to rutile more easily than the smaller ones. We suppose that rutile can grow to a much larger size than anatase due to sintering and growth of nanophase titania. Annealing the brookite sample TiO[B] in the temperature range 200–500 °C indicated a considerable amount of anatase, suggesting no direct transformation brookite → rutile. From the results, we propose a transformation scheme that is different from that reported by Li et al.16,17 who suggested a direct transition brookite → rutile. Our results are consistent with the observation of Ye et al.24 who claimed that brookite in a three-phase mixture of TiO2 transforms to rutile via anatase. The main grain sizes of TiO2 mixtures were determined using the X-ray diffraction line broadening method21 on the strongest individual peaks: the (121) peak with a d spacing of 2.908Å was used for the brookite phase, (110) peak with a d spacing of 3.262 Å was used for rutile. We measured the grain size of anatase in the same way as Ye et al.25 because in mixtures TiO[B])/200, TiO[B])/300, TiO[B])/400 and TiO[B])/500 no individual peak of anatase in XRD patterns is visible (traces b–e). In fact, the strongest peak with a d spacing of 3.520 Å is actually composed of several peaks and we got the grain size of anatase from the (200) peak by separating the overlapping brookite (231) peak. The phase contents and crystallite size of each phase present in the brookite–anatase–rutile mixtures are listed in Table 1. From the data obtained we can see a rapid decrease in the brookite phase and brookite grain size. In sample TiO[B])/500 obtained at 500 °C the content of brookite is only 3.2% and brookite grain size was reduced from 4.1 nm to 1.6 nm. On the other hand, anatase and rutile crystallite size significantly increase: calcination at 500 °C resulted in the growth of anatase and rutile nanocrystals to 12.1 nm and 10.6 nm, respectively.

In our case anatase can grow to a size much larger than rutile and based on these results, we suppose that anatase may nucleate and grow at the expense of brookite matrix (see Table 1).
On increasing the temperature to 600 °C, no peaks corresponding to brookite were found in the XRD pattern of as synthesized powder. Sample TiO[B])/600 is mixture only of anatase (39.6%) and rutile (60.4%)(see Fig. 1, trace (f)). When the temperature rises to 700 °C the transition of anatase to rutile is immeasurably rapid (sample TiO[B])/700 is mixture of 1.5% anatase 98.5% rutile) and at 800 °C rutile (ICDD PDF 21-1276) as a major phase is observed (see Fig. 1, trace (h)). At this temperature the metastable–stable TiO2 phase transition is completed.
3.2 Particle morphology
As it has been shown earlier22 the urea precipitation method leads to anatase nanoparticles assembled into a rather big (1–2 µm) porous clusters. Based on the work of our laboratory we used the modified urea precipitation method in preparation of brookite TiO2.

Fig. 2 shows the electron diffraction patterns (SEAD) of sample TiO[B] annealed for 1 h at 105 °C. In this case a series of rings appeared, each one due to a characteristic Bragg reflection, corresponding to brookite TiO2 (ICDD PDF card 29–1360). The crystal structure was assigned by means of the ProcessDiffraction program.25 This result is in good agreement with the results obtained from XRD analysis and confirms the same TiO2 polymorph (see Table 1).
 Fig. 2  Selected area diffraction pattern (SAED) of pure-phase brookite TiO[B] 
The TEM image (Fig. 3a) reveals a unique flower-type brookite agglomerate consisting of uniform plate-like brookite primary nanoparticles (4–5 nm) which are in contact. Based on precise HRTEM observation (Fig. 3b), we found a small fraction of amorphous material. By careful examination we have observed that in addition to brookite nanocrystals with size of about 4–5 nm some amorphous domains (Fig. 3b) with the average diameter of 5–10 nm are interlayered. We suppose that the morphology of sample TiO[B] depends strongly on the preparation conditions as used. It is well known that during spontaneous precipitation under stirred conditions, small crystals having regular shape are produced.26 The morphology of the particles being formed is also dependent upon the manner and intensity of stirring. Flower-like brookite agglomerates were directly precipitated if the first reactant solution of titanium (III) chloride was added to the second reactant solution containing PEG 10 000 and urea, previously preheated at 50 °C for 1 h. We assume that the shape of brookite also depends on the mixing process. Intensive and lengthy stirring influenced both nucleation and growth of uniform and plate-like brookite nanocrystals. Wang et al.27 published a similar morphology in the case of vaterite particles. Unique flower-type particles were synthesized if CaCl2 and urea solutions were first preheated separately at 90 °C for 3 h, followed by rapid mixing at the same temperature. The exact mechanism for brookite formation is still unclear. Some researchers claimed that presence of sodium cations are essential,13,28,29 while some others argued that low solution pH and Cl anions favor brookite.15,16 Our result supports the idea that some kinetic factors such as intensity of stirring during the precipitation process and the hydrodynamic conditions prevailing during the crystallization strongly influence the formation of the pure brookite phase.

The ProcessDiffraction program25 reveals that there is a mixture of anatase and rutile TiO2. The results are in line with the XRD analysis which confirmed 42.9% anatase and 53.9% rutile. It is worth to mentioning that the primary flower-type morphology is preserved at 500 °C.
The TEM image (Fig. 5a) shows that the particles are largely dispersed and overlapping (Fig. 5b). From the HRTEM data obtained (Fig. 5d) we can see individual anatase particles. Two lattice images were seen throughout all anatase particles: both having a d spacing of 0.352 nm, corresponding to the anatase structure. Based on the HRTEM image, we have found that the peripheral particles of the studied flower-like agglomerate are individual rutile particles. Fig. 5c shows the lattice image of particle with a d spacing 0.324 nm, corresponding to the rutile structure, i.e.,110 plane. Since this spacing is characteristic of the rutile structure, the result strongly indicated that these peripheral particles observed in HRTEM are rutile TiO2 nanocrystals.

3.3 The BET surface area, pore size and pore volume
BET results for the surface area and pore volume are shown in Table 1.The as prepared brookite sample TiO[B] shows a very large SBET value of 1059.4 m2 g−1. This may be ascribed to the fact that residuals of H2Ti3O7 in reaction medium were found. Pore size distribution measurement showed that this total surface area is attributed mainly to macro and mesopores (see pore distribution on Fig. 6). As revealed in the HRTEM micrograph (Fig. 3a), the mesopores are present between the plate-like brookite particles forming flower-type agglomerates. The thermal treatment of a parent sample TiO[B]) leads to a change of the microstuture: the surface area and pore volume decrease monotonically with an increase in temperature. This is due to the increase in average crystallite size of anatase and rutile during the transformation of brookite. The SBET of sample TiO[B])/500 isolated at 500 °C is only 79.9 m2 g−1. The synergy effect can be expected, if rutile and anatase particles are in contact.15 This phenomenon explains the significant decrease in SBET with increasing calcination temperature. For instants the end product of calcinations, sample TiO[B])/800 obtained at 800 °C exhibit an SBET of 8.1 and total pore volume of 0.0469 (see Table 1 and Fig. 6). We have mentioned that the range of pore sizes of all solid products obtained upon the heating (200–600 °C) is very narrow (15–20 nm). Fig. 6 shows that mesoporous structure prevails. Our results are in agreement with the statement that the mesoporous structure of TiO2 particles is attributed to pores formed between TiO2 particles.30

3.4 Photocatalytic activity of brookite-type and nanocrystalline TiO2 mixtures obtained during the transformation of brookite in photodegradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP)
The course of 4-chlorophenol photocatalyzed decomposition using the TiO[B] sample annealed at various temperatures is given on Fig. 7. The photoacatalytic activity of the samples studied was expressed by a pseudo first order rate constant, the results are given in Table 1. Degussa P-25 was used as reference material. The brookite type sample TiO[B] showed good photocatalytic activity. Its constant k reached 3.61 × 10−3. This is attributed to the high specific area and small size (4.1 nm) of brookite crystallites. We have found that sample TiO[B])/500 exhibited the best photocatalytic efficiency on the degradation of 4-CP of the all tested TiO2 samples: k was determined to be 4.79 × 10−3. This is assigned to the fact that this sample had a high specific surface area (79.9 m2g−1) and pores in mesoporous dimension allowed rapid diffusion of various reactants during the photocatalytic reaction and enhanced the speed of photocatalysis.31 This sample is mixture of 3.2% brookite, 42.9% anatase and 53.9% rutile with small crystallite size: 1.6, 12.1 and 10.6 nm, respectively. It is believed that the composite of two kinds of semiconductors or two phases of the same semiconductor is beneficial reducing the re-combination of photo-generated electrons and holes and enhancing the photocatalytic activity. In our experiment we observed an interesting result—the sizes of anatase and rutile crystallites obtained at 500 °C are equal. These results assumed that a mixture of three TiO2 polymorphs can act as a good photocatalyst in degradation of 4-CP.

All as prepared samples showed good photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 4-CP under UV radiation (Fig. 7), though they are still lower than the standard Degussa P25 (see Table 1).
3.5 Conclusions
Nanometric particles of pure brookite TiO2 were synthesized by modified thermolysis of reactant solutions containing titania powder, HCl, urea and PEG 10 000. Unique flower-like brookite agglomerates with an average diameter of ∼400–450 nm composed of single brookite nanocrystals of ∼4–5 nm were obtained at 105 °C. Titanium dioxide powders with varying compositions of brookite–anatase–rutile and anatase–rutile were obtained by carefully controlling the treatment temperature of the as precipitated brookite powder. In a three-phase mixture of TiO2 brookite transforms to rutile via anatase. The sample TiO[B])/500 composed of brookite, anatase and rutile phases where the size of anatase and rutile nanocrystals are equal showed the highest photoactivity on degradation of 4-CP.
