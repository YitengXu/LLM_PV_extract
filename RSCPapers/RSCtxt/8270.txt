    , Accepted 27th February 2020First published on 28th February 2020AbstractThe main goal of this work is to investigate the effects of a graphene layer between the photosensitive layer and semiconductor substrates on the electron transport performance of dye-sensitized solar cells from the perspective of intramolecular arrangement and interfaces. The benzothiadiazole sensitizer YKP-88 is used as the photosensitive layer and the influence of the graphene layer on the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) is also discussed by exploring the frontier molecular orbitals, intramolecular charge transfer, weak interaction, interfacial electron dynamic propagations and other microscopic parameters after the anchoring of the graphene layer. The results demonstrate that the graphene layer can accelerate the electron injection of dye molecules into the semiconductor substrate, which not only has a qualitative reduction in injection time, but also has a qualitative change in the increase of the injection amount. In addition, it is also found that the graphene layer increases the stereoscopic effect, the absorption of long wavelength (>700 nm) photon flu and the amount of electron injection into the photoanode, which benefits the intramolecular charge transfer and increases the Jsc and Voc of solar cells. The combination of intermolecular and interfacial perspectives indicates that the appropriate configuration of graphene layers can effectively improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are widely researched as a result of their simple synthesis, environmental friendliness and compatibility with rigid and flexible semiconductors.1 A typical DSSC has four important components, namely, a semiconductor photoelectrode, a photosensitizer, a redox couple (I−/I3−) and a counter electrode.2–4 The sensitizer is adsorbed on the surface of the photoelectrode by the acceptor group. When exposed to visible light, the excited photosensitizer will inject electrons into the photoanode. The electrons are collected by the photoanode and transmitted to the counter electrode. The oxidized sensitizer obtains electrons from the electrolyte to complete a photoelectric cycle process.5–7 The sensitizer plays an important role in photoelectric conversion by injecting free electrons from the photoactive layer into the photoelectrode. Among the reported sensitizer materials, organic dyes have aroused significant attention due to their various types and easy molecular design. Specifically, dyes with donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) structures are potentially near-infrared sensitizers for DSSCs and have been widely researched and developed due to their excellent charge transmission performance.8,9
There have been numerous works on the application of high-performance sensitizers with D–π–A structures in DSSCs. Based on this type, a series of novel structures have been gradually researched, such as the A–D–π–A and D–π–A–D–π–A structures. Di and co-workers10 researched a β-substituted porphyry in sensitizer and metallic zinc was introduced into the donor part of the molecule, which allowed the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of the sensitizer to reach 13%. Nagarajan and co-workers11 synthesized six types of sensitizer molecules with D–π–A structure. Donor parts of the six types of sensitizer were non-traditional ethynyl-pyrene structures, with the PCE of one sensitizer reaching 12%. Maragani and collaborators12 used Knoevenagel condensation reactions to synthesize two sensitizers with (D–π–A)2–π–D–A structures and revealed the donor–acceptor interaction through theoretical calculations. Both the experimental and theoretical results showed the ultra-high PCE of the sensitizer.
Quantum chemical computation has become a powerful means to study the photophysical and photochemical properties of sensitizers.13–19 By adjusting the spatial configuration between graphene and the semiconductor photoanode, Xi et al.20 found that the C–Ti single bond connection between graphene and the semiconductor could accelerate electron injection, thereby providing an effective way for future theoretical research on graphene materials. Li and his collaborators21 used quantum chemical calculations to study the structure-performance relationship by changing the π-bridge, showing that the π-conjugation section, including electron-deficient and electron-rich portions, can improve the ability of light absorption and the electron delocalization can be effectively promoted by reducing the aromaticity of the π-bridge and destroying the coherence of the system. By means of quantum mechanical simulation, Lu and co-workers22 studied the transferred electron of a new pyridinium in the sensitizer/photoanode interface. Experimental data show that pyridinium ylide-based anchors are beneficial to absorbing light and improving the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) performance. In addition, the edge of the photoanode conduction band moves up, further increasing the Jsc and Voc.
Based on the research of Xu et al.,23 the photophysical and photochemical characteristics of the dye molecule YKP-88 are simulated using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT(TDDFT). In addition, the graphene layer (GR) between the photosensitive and semiconductor layers is also been studied theoretically. It has to be said that titanium dioxide/graphene composites have been preliminarily studied in other battery fields, but have not been reported in the field of DSSCs.24,25 Therefore, we establish a theoretical model to explore the feasibility of this scheme. The main purpose of this research is to understand the role of the GR in DSSCs and to explain the role of the GR in cells from the microscopic perspective of electron transfer. We also theoretically establish the global scan methods to consider intramolecular weak interaction, Jsc parameter, electron transfer dynamic and Voc parameter changes after the GR is plated between the sensitizer and the semiconductor to explain the effect of graphene.
2. Computational methods
The ground-state optimal structures of sensitizers were simulated using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set.26–28 Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) were also obtained with this basis set and processed by the Multiwfn29 and VMD30 programs. In addition, the orbital image parameters were adjusted and rendered using Tachyon to make it more artistic. In order to compare the theoretical simulation results with the experimental results, five representative functionals were considered, namely, Cam-B3LYP, PBEPBE, ωB97X, M062X and MPW1PW91.31–35 By comparing them with the experimental spectra, the most appropriate functional M062X was adopted for the subsequent theoretical calculations and the results are shown in Table 1.

In order to make the final simulation results comparable with the experimental values, we also used the experimental solvent (CH2Cl2) in the process of simulation, so as to make the final simulation results more credible. In addition, we analyzed the charge-transfer excitation during the electron transition from a three-dimensional perspective in order to explore the influence of the addition of GR on electron transfer. In addition, the Coulomb interaction energy was also calculated to explore the effect of GR on the electron transfer. Due to the steric hindrance effects of the ring structure,36 the weak interaction with GR has also been investigated based on the non-covalent interactions method. Moreover, the special location of the GR is particularly important for the investigation of electron transfer at the interface.
We use a (TiO2)16 cluster as the photoanode substrate37 to balance the solid properties and time consumption, and the semi-empirical extended Hückel theory to calculate the dynamic process of interfacial electron transfer (IET). Moreover, the (TiO2)16 cluster was simulated using the LANL2TZ pseudopotential basis set and periodic boundary conditions were used to calculate the dye@(TiO2)16 system. The spectra of the density of states (DOS) was simulated by the GaussSum program and all the calculation data were obtained from the Gaussian 09 program suite using DFT and TDDFT.38,39
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometrical structures of YKP-88 and YKP-88/GR complex
The dye and its GR complex are simulated in a dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) solvent. The GR with a D6h planar network structure was selected as a layer to anchor the carboxyl group of the sensitizers and this kind of GR structure can improve the electron lifetime and reduce the charge reorganization of the dye sensitizer inside the cells and facilitate the ICT.40 The optimized structure of YKP-88 is available in Fig. 1, with some special dihedral angles for two photoactive layer molecules summarized in Table 2.

The dihedral angles (θ1) for the donor part of an isolated sensitizer is −45.04°, which means that the donor part is distorted, and there was no change in the dihedral angle θ1 after it anchored the graphene, which may be because the graphene was anchored away from the donor side. The dihedral angle (θ2) between the thiophene and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole for the isolated sensitizer is −2.87°, and the dihedral angle (θ3) between the benzene ring and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole is 33.46°. After anchoring the dye molecule into the GR, the sizes of dihedral angle θ2 and θ3 are 3.63° and 34.00°, respectively. This indicated that the spatial structure of YKP-88 is changed slightly after the anchoring of graphene, which also affected the photoelectric properties of the sensitizer to some extent. The dihedral angle (θ4) of sensitizer and its complex between the π-conjugation and the acceptor part are close to the plane, which is beneficial to the bathochromic shift in the visible region and the ICT properties. The length of the C–C single bond between the sensitizer and GR was 1.496 Å. This length is reasonable relative to the overall C–C bond lengths in the YKP-88/GR (1.372–1.544 Å) complex, indicating that the GR can be firmly anchored to the carboxyl portion of the sensitizer. In addition, it is known from other experimental report that the compound can be bonded to the aromatic hydrocarbon by the carbonyl group.41–44
3.2 FMO analysis
The efficient injection of electrons from sensitizers to semiconductors and the regeneration of dyes in electrolytes play fundamental roles in the working mechanism of DSSCs. Therefore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels must meet the energy standard for electron transfer in dyes.
The HOMO level of the sensitizer is lower than the redox electrolyte of I3−/I− (−4.8 eV vs. vacuum), which makes it easy for the dye to gain electrons from I3−/I−.45 The LUMO level of the sensitizer should be higher than the semiconductor band level of TiO2 (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum), which ensures that the sensitizer can inject its own electrons into the semiconductor.46 The HOMOs, LUMOs and FMOs of the sensitizer and its graphene complex are shown in Fig. 2(a). As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), the HOMO for YKP-88 is −4.90 eV and the electrons are distributed among the donor and π-conjugation parts, with most of them concentrated on triphenylamine (TPA). The LUMO energy level is −2.94 eV and the electrons are distributed among the π-conjugation and acceptor moieties, with most of it concentrated on cyanoacrylic acid (CAA). When the sensitizer was anchored to the GR, there was no change in the HOMO level, but the LUMO energy level decreased to −2.99 eV, which reduced the energy gap of the sensitizer by 0.05 eV.

In order to further understand the tendency of electron transfer within the photoactive sensitizer, the FMO diagram and the projected density of state (PDOS) analysis are presented in Fig. S1 and S2(a and b) (ESI†), respectively. By assessing Fig. S1 (ESI†) and comparing the values of Fig. S2 (ESI†), we can make reasonable judgments regarding the electron transfer. For HOMO−1 of YKP-88, the electron density is evenly dispersed on the donor and conjugated bridge of the molecule, and the electrons begin the transition to other orbitals with the increase in energy, thus forming electron transfer. For HOMO of YKP-88, the electron density is concentrated on the TPA region.
With the transition of the electrons, the electron density gradually moves towards the CAA part. For LUMO+1, the electron density in the acceptor moiety reaches the maximum, which is consistent with the results of the PDOS numerical analysis. For the HOMO of YKP-88/GR, the electron density in the TPA part. For LUMO and LUMO+1, the electron density is mostly at the π-bridge. Finally, for LUMO+2, the electron density is essentially in the GR. As the energy of the electron increases, the electron transfer occurs from the lower orbitals to the higher orbitals. Therefore, the PDOS numerical analysis of the FMOs can indirectly reflect the electron transfer in the sensitizer. Compared with the LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 of YKP-88/GR, there is only a small concentration of electron density in the electron-withdrawing groups CAA of isolated sensitizers, which indicates that the GR can improve the ability of electron transfer to the electron-withdrawing groups for excited dyes.
In order to further highlight the relationship between sensitizer, GR and titanium dioxide in electron transfer process, we used (TiO2)16 cluster as the photoanode substrate for FMO analysis, and the data obtained were presented in Table 3 and Fig. 3 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). For complexes YKP-88@(TiO2)16 and YKP-88/GR@(TiO2)16, the electron transition for dye@(TiO2)16 and its graphene complexes in the strongest excited state are all from HOMO to LUMO. Combining with the FMO diagram in Fig. S3 (ESI†) can know, graphene in the strongest excited state (S3) was not involved in electron transfer. But in other strong excited state (S6 and S9), graphene localized orbitals for electron transfer play a role that cannot be ignored. For example, in the excited state S6 of YKP-88/GR@(TiO2)16, the electron transfer is from HOMO−2 to LUMO. For HOMO−2, the electron density is concentrated on GR region. For LUMO, the electron density is concentrated on the photoanode, so it can be considered as electron transfer from graphene to the photoanode. In addition, we also listed a series of data such as oscillator strength and transition energy in Table 3. The data comparison also shows that the absorption spectrum in the visible light region is superior after GR is anchored to the photoanode.

In addition, the delocalization effect of the π electron in a planar conjugate system can better reflect the possible electron transfer path,47 so the π-conjugated bridge in the sensitizer and graphene planar was specifically discussed. Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the color-filled contours of localized orbital locator-π (LOL-π) maps of the π-conjugate bridge and graphene planar, respectively, and setting all occupied orbitals other than π orbitals to zero. The high LOL-π value continuous regions (red and yellow) can be interpreted as the delocalization path of the π electron. As can be seen from Fig. 2(b), the π-bridge part of the sensitizer has a strong delocalization effect (red and yellow) and the junctions of benzene rings and thiophene shows a strong delocalization property (red), which ensures the smoothness of the possible electron transfer paths. In addition, Fig. 2(c) also reflects this phenomenon. The photoanode is connected at the bottom of Fig. 2(c) and the sensitizer is connected at the left of Fig. 2(c). It can be visually observed that the multiple paths between the sensitizer and photoanode have a strong delocalization effect (red). The delocalization effect is relatively weak (green) in the regions far from the photoanode, which indicates that graphene is a suitable material for electron transfer from sensitizer to photoanode.
3.3 ICT analysis
In order to reflect the nature of the ICT more vividly, the electron density difference (Δρ) between the first excited state and the ground state (isocontour value of 0.00015 a.u.) is analyzed.48 According to the diagram of Δρ in Fig. 4, it is found that the two different colors represent the changes in electron density relative to the ground state. The red (green) region represents the increase (decrease) of electron density relative to the ground state. However, electron density difference maps are not sufficiently intuitive, so we must combine the red and green density regions into a centroid map through a Gaussian distribution with root-mean-square deviations and the isovalue of the graph shown below is 0.00015 a.u. It is obvious that the sensitizer YKP-88 in the excited state has a significant charge separation. Compared with the ground state, the regions (where the electron density of the excited state increased) were concentrated in the acceptor and its adjacent π-bridge parts, while the electron density decreased regions were localized on the TPA and its neighboring π-bridge moieties.

In addition, for exploring these properties, several related characteristic quantities have been simulated, such as the transferred charge (qCT), the charge transfer distance between the centroid of hole and electron (DCT), the separation degree between electron and hole (tCT), the variation in dipole moment (μCT) and the average degree of spatial extension of a hole and electron distribution along the D–A direction (HCT), and are listed in Table 4. The HCT is obtained by calculating the average sum of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of electrons and holes, and the tCT is equal to the difference between HCT and DCT, which means a real separation between electron and hole if it is a positive value.29

From these data, it can be shown that after the sensitizer was anchored into the GR, the transferred charge increases from 0.822 |e−| to 0.900 |e−|, which indicates that the graphene contributes to the charge transfer to a certain extent. In addition, the DCT also increases from 4.839 to 7.963 Å, and this suggests that graphene increases the charge transport driving force of the sensitizer and facilitates exciton separation. The high separation degree facilitates charge-transfer excitation and it demonstrates that graphene contributes to charge-transfer excitation through theoretical values. The variation in dipole moment is the combination of transferred charge and length of charge transfer, with the data showing that the anchoring of graphene is more conducive to ICT.
The excited-state lifetime (τ) and coulombic attraction affect the electron injection from the sensitizer to the photoanode. The excited-state lifetime has an important effect on charge transfer and energy loss.22 The Coulomb interaction energy has a significant effect on exciton separation.21 The excited-state lifetime can be simulated by Einstein's spontaneous emission coefficient, as showed by: (1)where ħ is the reduced Plank's constant, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, e is the elementary charge, E is the transition energy and μ is the transition dipole moment. The calculation results of the YKP-88 and YKP-88/GR for the excited-state lifetime are 0.132 and 0.170 ns, respectively.
The photoexcitation of the sensitizer results in the production of excitons. Excitons are electron–hole pairs bound to each other by a coulombic attraction. The electron transfer occurs from the valence band to the conduction band, but the electrons are still associated with the holes in the valence band by the coulombic attraction. Therefore, excitons must overcome the attraction of electron–hole pair to ensure effective charge separation, as well as the electrons entering the external circuit of the DSSC. The Coulomb interaction energy (Ecoul) can be simulated by: (2)where εr and εv are the dielectric constants in the real and vacuum medium, respectively, qCT is the transferred charge and DCT is the intermolecular space distance of the charge transfer. The calculation results of the YKP-88 and YKP-88/GR for the Coulomb interaction energy are 0.582 and 0.381 eV, respectively. From the simulated data, we find that after the sensitizer is anchored to the graphene, the excitation-state lifetime is prolonged, which provides sufficient time for exciton separation. In addition, the Coulomb interaction energy is reduced, which makes exciton separation easier, thus facilitating electron injection.
3.4 IP, EA and reorganization energy
In general, excellent electron transfer and hole transport capabilities, as well as the relative balance between electron and hole transport, are the necessary conditions for the outstanding performance of DSSC devices.49–51 The smaller vertical ionization energy (IP) will facilitate the electron transfer ability of the sensitizer and the higher vertical electron affinity potential (EA) will facilitate the electron transfer from the sensitizer into the semiconductor. In addition, the reorganization energy can evaluate the equilibrium performance of sensitizers.
The IPs of the sensitizers YKP-88 and YKP-88/GR are 4.780 and 4.776 eV, respectively, which means that the hole transfer capacity of the two sensitizers is approximately equal. Meanwhile, the EAs of YKP-88 and the complex are 3.084 and 3.148 eV, respectively. This can be interpreted by the fact that the sensitizer anchored to graphene possesses a better electron-withdrawing capability. In addition, the intramolecular reorganization energy includes the hole reorganization energy (λh) and the electron reorganization energy (λe), and the transport performance of the sensitizer is improved with the decrease of the reorganization energy. Here, λe and λh represent the electron and hole transporting capacity, respectively: λe = (E−0 − E−) + (E0− − E0)(3) λh = (E+0 − E+) + (E0+ − E0)(4)where E+0(E−0) represents the energy of the cation (anion) state based on the neutral optimized state, E+(E−) represents the energy of the cation (anion) based on the optimized state, E0+(E0−) is the energy of the neutral state based on the optimized state of the cation (anion) and E0 is the energy of the neutral optimized state. The hole reorganization energies of the sensitizers YKP-88 and YKP-88/GR are 0.189 and 0.198 eV. The electron reorganization energies of the sensitizers YKP-88 and YKP-88/GR are 0.277 and 0.272 eV, respectively. The simulation results show that the ability of electron transport can be improved by anchoring the sensitizers on the GR.
3.5 Intramolecular weak interaction analysis
Steric hindrance not only affects the charge transfer within molecules but also the charge transfer between molecules, thus affecting the photoelectric overall performance of the DSSC. When the steric hindrance increases, it will cause some groups of the dye to deviate from the normal dihedral angle and cause tension within the molecule, which will produce a stereoscopic effect, so as to effectively inhibit the dye aggregation and improve the efficiency of light harvesting.52
We use a reduced density gradient (RDG) isosurface with color filling to distinguish the types of weak interaction within molecules and the results are shown in Fig. 5(a). Here, the x axis represents the sign of the second largest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix of the electron density (λ2) multiplied by the electron density (ρ). According to Bader's AIM theory, the electron density is concentrated on the left side of Fig. 5(a), which has an attractive interaction. Meanwhile, the steric effect indicates that the electron density is depleted at the right side of the figure. In Fig. 5(a), we can see that after the sensitizer is anchored on graphene, the more critical point appeared in the steric hindering area (red), with the most prominent part circled. Therefore, it can be concluded from Fig. 5(a) that the sensitizer has enhanced the stereoscopic effect after it anchored to the graphene, thus better inhibiting the dye aggregation. Although the sensitizer slightly increases the steric resistance after anchoring graphene, there are many reasons for this phenomenon. It may be due to the fact that the anchoring of graphene changed the structure of the sensitizer, which increased the steric hindrance. It is also a possible reason that the steric hindrance at a certain point in the complex is too large to inhibit the accumulation of dyes.
 Fig. 5  (a) Plots of the RDG versus the electron density multiplied by the sign of the second Hessian eigenvalue and gradient isosurfaces with RGD = 0.6 a.u. for YKP-88 and YKP-88/GR. The surfaces are colored on a blue-green-red scale according to values of sign (λ2)ρ, ranging from −0.04 to 0.02 a.u. Blue indicates strong attractive interactions, and red indicates strong steric hindrance effect; (b) and (c) 3D molecular structure image at RDG = 0.6 a.u. 
In order to determine the cause of this phenomenon, we made a 3D molecular structure image at RDG = 0.6 a.u. (Fig. 5(b) and (c)). We can intuitively observe that steric hindrance is more evenly distributed in the spatial structure of the sensitizer molecules. Therefore, it can be considered that the insertion of a graphene sheet can indeed inhibit dye aggregation.
3.6 Influence of graphene layer on Jsc
The influence of Jsc on the overall performance (η) of the sensitizer is very important and can be determined by the following relations:53 (5)where FF is the fill factor and Pin is the incident solar power on the cells. Therefore, it is important to analyze the fluctuation of Jsc caused by the graphene layer. Jsc is related to many factors, which can be listed as follows: electron-injection efficiency (ϕinj), the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE(λ)), the dye reorganization efficiency (ηreg), the charge collection efficiency (ψcol) and the photon flu of the AM1.5 solar radiation spectrum (φph.AM1.5G(λ)). The relationship between these parameters is shown by: (6)
Since the fabrication processing and photoanode of the cells are the same as that of the two sensitizers, we can assume that the ψcol is a constant. Therefore, we only consider the impact of several other factors on calculating Jsc. In order to make the calculation results more convincing, we replaced the simulated graphene sheet to avoid errors caused by the too smaller size of graphene. The spatial structure of the replaced graphene sheet is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
The simulation of LHE(λ) needs to consider the surface loading of dyes (Γ) on the semiconductor and the light absorption cross section (σ), and the formula between the three is shown below:54 LHE(λ) = 1 − 10−Γσ(λ)(7)
The Γ dye YKP-88 in the experiment was measured by the sensitizer on the surface of mesoporous 3D inverse opal TiO2, but the results obtained by the conventional simulation method were not accurate enough. Therefore, the Γ of the sensitizer after anchoring graphene was simulated in the form of a molecular volume ratio. We calculated the van der Waals volume of YKP-88 and YKP-88@GR to be 1195 and 2478 Å3, respectively. After converting the units of Γ of the sensitizer YKP-88 measured in the original experiment, we obtain a value of 5.786 × 10−7 mol cm−2. The Γ is inversely proportional to the molecular volume, so the Γ of the graphene complex is 2.790 × 10−7 mol cm−2. The σ(λ) and molar extinction coefficients ε(λ) can be expressed as: σ(λ) = 1000(λ)(8)
The simulated UV-Vis absorption and LHE(λ) spectra are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 6(a), the maximum oscillator strength increased from 1.51 to 1.66 after the sensitizer anchored graphene. From Fig. 6(b), we can find that there is a large part of the difference in the light-harvesting curves of the two sensitizers, which is caused by the larger light-harvesting region of the sensitizer YKP-88@GR. In addition, the incident light absorption in the short wavelength region does not have a positive effect on device performance. It can be seen from Fig. 6(c) that after anchoring graphene, the sensitizer is more efficient in absorbing photons in the long wavelength region (>700 nm), which undoubtedly improves the short-circuit current of the DSSC. The theoretical maximum Jmaxsc can thus be obtained if we suppose ϕinj, ηreg and ψcol are equal to 1. By integrating the LHE(λ) and φph.AM1.5G(λ), we obtained that the Jmaxsc of sensitizers YKP-88 and YKP-88@GR were 34.69 and 44.33 mA cm−2, respectively. The ideal short-circuit current of the simulation is larger than the experimental measurement result (19.86 mA cm−2) without considering other adverse factors, which indicate that the simulation result is acceptable.

3.7 Electron transfer dynamics
The IET is defined as the survival probability of excited electrons from excited electronic states to the semiconductor by the time-evolved electronic wavefunction. The IET from the photosensitive layer to the semiconductor layer is affected by many factors, such as the type of semiconductor layer and the geometry of the sensitizer.50 Here, we focus on the effect of adding the GR between the photosensitive layer and a semiconductor layer on the dynamic process of IET. In addition, the (TiO2)16 cluster was calculated as a semiconductor layer to make the simulation results more reliable. The IET simulation is to expand the excited electronic states at time t|Ψ(t)〉 (the probability of photo-excited electrons remaining in the dye) into a linear combination of the adsorbate atomic orbitals |Kj〉, and make it evolve with time by analyzing and integrating the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, as follows: . The  and Ek are eigenstate and eigenvalue, which is obtained by solving the extended-Hückel (EH) eigenvalue problem based on Sij = 〈Ki|Kj〉 and atomic orbitals |Kj〉. Based on the EH Hamiltonian, both σ and π orbitals contained in S, P and D atomic orbitals can be calculated.55–57
When the system is excited, the electrons remain in the adsorbent before being injected into the semiconductor. Therefore, it is necessary to simulate the LUMO and above of the sensitizer to determine which orbital should be used as the starting point to calculate the IET. As can be seen from Fig. 3, YKP-88 calculates the IET from the LUMO+1 and YKP-88/GR calculates the IET from the LUMO. By observing the FMO, it can be clearly found that adding the GR to DSSC makes it easier for electrons to transition from the sensitizer to semiconductor. Fig. 7 shows the results of IET dynamics and the electron injection time are obtained by the exponential fitting. The results show that electron injection is complete after t ∼ 300 fs. The YKP-88 takes ∼55 fs and YKP-88/GR only takes ∼5 fs, indicating that the addition of the graphene sheet layer between the sensitizer and semiconductor layers could greatly improve the IET.

3.8 Influence of graphene layer on Voc
The Voc of the DSSC depends on the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor band (EFermi) and the redox potential of I−/I3− (Eredox). The relationship is shown by:58 (9)where EFermi is affected by the conduction band edge of the semiconductor (ECB), the shifted ECB(ΔECB) caused by dye sensitizer (GR), the number of electrons injected into the semiconductor band (nc) and the loadable density of the photoanode band (NCB). The relationship between these parameters is shown by: (10)
The PDOS of the dye-(GR)-TiO2 system is plotted in Fig. 8 and the ΔECB values can be approximated by the DOS curve.59 The ΔECB is approximated by linear fitting of the adsorbate lowest energy state (LUMOads) in the DOS diagram. In Fig. 8, the TiO2 DOS and TiO2 PDOS represent pure (TiO2)16 clusters and the contribution of (TiO2)16 clusters to the total dye@(TiO2)16 system, respectively. The ΔECB value of the YKP-88 sensitizer is ∼0.09 eV. When the graphene sheet was added to the semiconductor surface, the value of ΔECB was ∼0.29 eV. This suggests that the GR can easily affect the conduction band edge of the semiconductor and these superior ΔECB values are conducive to improving the Voc of the DSSC. In addition, the quantity of electric charge transferred was calculated by the inter-fragment charge transfer method, where YKP-88 is 0.034C and YKP-88/GR is up to 0.997C. The nc could be deduced according to the charge of the elementary charge, so the nc of YKP-88 and YKP-88/GR was 2.31 × 1017 and 6.23 × 1018, respectively, which directly reflect the outstanding contribution of graphene layer to electron injection. Based on the above data, we can deduce the Voc of DSSC through eqn (9) and (10). The Voc of YKP-88 and YKP-88/GR is 683 and 968 mV, respectively. By comparing the experimental value (680 ± 20 mV) of YKP-88 with the theoretical value, it can be seen that the theoretical value has a high credibility. Therefore, it can be concluded that the GR is conducive to the Voc of DSSC when it resides between the photoanode and photosensitive layer.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a DFT global scan was used to in-depth reveal the influence of adding GR on intramolecular charge transfer and photovoltaic performance in solar cells. The impacts of a GR on the DSSC are summarized as follows: (a) the graphene layer can improve the ability of electron transfer to electron-withdrawing groups in excited dyes; (b) through RDG analysis, the GR can increase the stereoscopic effect, which is beneficial to improving ICT characteristics; (c) the graphene layer can improve the absorption of photon flu in the long-wavelength region of the dye, thus contributing to the improvement of Jsc; (d) the GR can effectively reduce the electron injection time and increase the electron injection, thereby increasing the Voc of solar cells. Therefore, it can be hoped that the use of an appropriate GR is an effective approach to improve the PCE of the DSSC.
