    , Accepted 9th July 2015First published on 13th July 2015AbstractWe have analyzed the excited state dynamics of the heteroleptic [(NCS)2Ru(bpy-(COOH)2)(bpy-(C6H13)2)] Z907 solar cell sensitizer in solution and when adsorbed onto thin TiO2 films, by combining transient visible and infrared (IR) spectroscopies with ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Time-Dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. Upon excitation with ultra-short pulses in ethanol and dimethyl-sulphoxide solutions, the visible spectra show the appearance of a positive signal around 650 nm, within the instrumental time resolution (<100 fs), which in ethanol undergoes a red-shift in about 20 ps. Measurements in the IR indicate that, upon excitation, both the CN and CO marker bands, associated with the NCS and COOH groups, downshift in frequency, in response to intramolecular ligand + metal (Ru-NCS) to ligand' (bpy-COOH2) charge transfer (LML'CT). Vibrational cooling is observed in both solvents; in ethanol it is overtaken by the hydrogen bond dynamics. On the basis of DFT/TDDFT calculations, explicitly modeling the interaction of the NCS and COOH groups with solvent (ethanol) molecules, we rationalize the observed IR and visible spectral evolution as arising from the change in the hydrogen-bond network, which accompanies the transition to the lowest-energy triplet state. This interpretation provides a consistent explanation of what is also observed in the transient visible spectra. Transient IR measurements repeated for molecules adsorbed on TiO2 and ZrO2 films, allow us to identify the structural changes signaling the dye triplet excited state formation and evidence multiexponential electron injection rates into the semiconductor TiO2 film.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted notable interest in the last few years as effective low-cost devices for solar energy conversion.1,2 In these systems a dye molecule, adsorbed on a nano-crystalline thin-film semiconductor through a molecular bridge, harvests solar energy and transfers electrons into the semiconductor conduction band (CB). The oxidized dye is then regenerated by the electrolyte, usually based on the iodide/triiodide redox couple, which closes the circuit allowing current flow across the device.3 An essential feature of these solar cells is a large effective surface area for light absorption, which allows for the fabrication of thin-film semiconductor devices, facilitating efficient charge separation across the interface and lowering the fabrication costs for the semiconductor layer. In the last 20 years diverse classes of molecules of different chemical nature, such as metal complexes,4,5 porphyrines6–8 or organic push–pull dyes,9–11 have been designed and characterized to be used as efficient sensitizers for DSSCs. The essential characteristics of an ideally highly efficient dye sensitizer are: (i) high absorption coefficient; (ii) long term stability; (iii) high yield of photoinduced interfacial electron transfer into the semiconductor CB; and (iv) relatively slow charge recombination dynamics.
Ruthenium(II) polypyridine complexes have been widely employed in dye sensitized solar cells, with solar to electric power efficiencies exceeding 11%.8,12,13 In these dyes, the charge injection into the semiconductor CB can occur in principle directly via the initially excited singlet charge transfer state, the occurrence of an ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) process, characteristic of this class of compounds, usually favors the injection of the electron from the lowest energy triplet state.14 The nature of the low-lying electronic transitions in these systems is of ligand + metal to ligand charge transfer (LML'CT) character, with ligands such as CN and NCS increasing the absorption strength and tuning the wavelength of the visible transitions.15–17 The interfacial electron transfer process in ruthenium polypyridyl complexes has been widely investigated by means of ultrafast spectroscopic techniques both in the visible and infrared (IR) spectral ranges.3 In the IR range, the thiocyanate CN stretching modes provide a useful probe to follow the intramolecular and interfacial CT processes following the electronic excitation: they have, in fact, well isolated and intense vibrational bands whose frequency is very sensitive to the charge density change. The carboxylic moieties, introduced on the bipyridine ligands to graft the dye onto the TiO2 surface, provide an additional IR marker positioned in the acceptor part of the molecule, which is useful for following the dynamics of charge injection and recombination.18 Previous studies on the charge injection dynamics for the most efficient N3 and N719 Ru(II) dyes have revealed the occurrence of multi-exponential interfacial electron injection towards the polycrystalline TiO2 semiconductor, revealing both an ultrafast phase (<100 fs) and slower picosecond component(s).3 These results are usually interpreted in terms of a two state mechanism: the fast component is attributed to ultrafast injection from the non-thermalized initially excited 1LML'CT state, while the slower phase represents injection from the equilibrated 3LML'CT state, reached in these systems on a sub-ps time scale, thus competing with initial electron transfer from the singlet state. Injection from the triplet state is strongly multi-exponential, presenting different phases with time constants spanning from tens to hundreds of picoseconds.19–21 The reasons for this marked multi-exponentiality have been ascribed to various factors, such as the heterogeneity of the TiO2 film,22 different electron couplings between the surface and photosensitizer, depending on the multiple ways in which the molecule can be adsorbed onto the semiconductor film or nanoparticle,21 formation of dye aggregates on the semiconductor,23 and interligand electron transfer within the sensitizer.24
To rationalize the excited state sensitizer dynamics and to deeply understand the relation between the sensitizer structure and its efficiency, it is necessary to have a precise knowledge of both the excited states energies and the photodynamics. The comparison of the excited state deactivation pathways of the dye when adsorbed onto a semiconductor surface with those recorded in solution can often deliver additional information. With this aim, here we study the dynamics of the excited state relaxation of the widely used Z907 [(NCS)2Ru(bpy-(COOH)2)(bpy-(C6H13)2)] bipyridine-Ru(II) sensitizer (see Scheme 1).25–29
 Scheme 1  Molecular structure of the Z907 sensitizer. 
In this molecule, one of the two bipyridine ligands has a modified structure, with attached two dinonyl chains. Previous studies indicated that this chemical modification has the effect of increasing the stability of the oxidized form of the molecule and reducing its degradation in water environments with respect to similar dyes such as N3 and N719.4,30
We have analyzed the excited state behavior of Z907 in protic and non-protic solvents, namely ethanol (EtOH) and dimethyl-sulphoxide (DMSO), employing ultrafast transient spectroscopy in the visible and mid-IR spectral ranges. Furthermore, using transient IR spectroscopy, we have analyzed the behavior of this molecule when adsorbed on a non-conductive ZrO2 surface. Finally, we have studied the dynamics of electron injection into a TiO2 polycrystalline film. The reported experimental measures have been complemented with a theoretical analysis, based on DFT and TDDFT calculations, addressed to characterize the IR and UV-Vis response of the molecule both in protic and non-protic solvents. By modeling the explicit interaction of one solvent (EtOH) molecule with each NCS and COOH group, we have interpreted the observed spectral IR evolution of both the CO and CN markers as arising from the change in the hydrogen bond network, which follows the electronic excitation from the ground to the lowest-energy triplet state, also providing a consistent explanation of what observed in the transient visible spectra. Our results, in fact, indicate a strengthening/weakening of the hydrogen bond between the COOH/NCS groups and the ethanol molecules as a consequence of the movement of electronic charge from the thiocyanate to the carboxylic moieties. Furthermore, transient IR measurements of interfacial electron injection into the TiO2 surface confirm the presence of an ultrafast (<100 fs) dynamic phase and of multiple slower ps components, in agreement with the previous observation made for the structurally similar N3 and N719 dyes.3
2 Materials and methods
Sample preparation
Z907 dye powders (Dyesol) were purified before measurements by using a HPLC (Waters 996, equipped with a photodiode array detector). The dye powder was solubilized in EtOH and injected into the chromatographic column (Phenomenex Jupiter, 10 μm, C18, 250 mm × 21 mm). The mobile phase consisted of distilled acetonitrile with 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH).31 The powders were dissolved in EtOH and DMSO, with concentrations of ∼10−5 for visible and ∼10−4 M for transient IR measurements. Solvents of spectroscopic grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
For transient IR measurements the spectral cell consisted of two 2 mm calcium fluoride windows separated by a 50 μm Teflon spacer. The cell was mounted on a home-made movable sample holder to minimize sample degradation and multiple excitation. For visible transient absorption the sample solution was contained in a 2 mm quartz cuvette. Magnetic stirring with a small magnet directly inserted into the cuvette ensured sample refreshing during data acquisition.
Dye-sensitized substrates were obtained by immersion in a ≈10−4 M solution in EtOH for at least 12 hours followed by repeated rinsing with EtOH and complete drying in air.
The semiconductor substrates (ZrO2 or TiO2) were prepared as follows. The ZrO2 nanoparticle suspension was fabricated by following a procedure similar to that used for the preparation of TiO2 using the sol gel technique.32
10 ml of zirconium iso-propoxide were injected into 5.5 g of glacial acetic acid under an argon atmosphere and stirred for 10 minutes. The mixture was then injected into 50 ml of 0.1 M nitric acid under an anhydrous atmosphere at room temperature in a flask and stirred vigorously. The flask was left uncovered and heated at 90 °C for 8 hours. After cooling, the solution was filtered using a 0.45 μm syringe filter, diluted to 5 wt% ZrO2 by the addition of H2O and then autoclaved at 220 °C for 12 hours. The ZrO2 colloidal solution was then concentrated to 10% on a rotary evaporator using a membrane vacuum pump at a temperature of 40 °C. Carbowax 20000 (Aldrich) was added and the resulting paste was stirred slowly overnight to ensure homogeneity.33 Otherwise, for the TiO2 films a commercial screen printing paste (Dyesol 18NRT) was employed.
Each suspension was spread onto the substrates using a glass rod, and a 3 M adhesive tape as a spacer. After the films were dried in air, they were sintered at 450 °C for 20 minutes. The thickness of the prepared films was controlled using different tapes, resulting in film thicknesses of 3–4 μm.34
The thickness of the oxide film deposited on the photoanodes was measured by using a DektakXT profilometer (Bruker) equipped with a diamond-tipped stylus (radius of 2 μm) and selecting a vertical scan range of 65 μm with 8.0 nm resolution and a stylus force of 1 mg. Each measure was verified by acquiring different runs, starting from different positions set by rotating or translating the sample.
Ultrafast measurements
UV-Vis transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments have been widely described in previous papers.35 The fs-laser oscillator is a Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra Physics Tsunami) pumped by the second harmonic of a Nd:YVO (Spectra Physics Millennia). The short (≤70 fs) pulses are stretched and amplified at 1 kHz repetition rate by a regenerative amplifier (BMI Alpha 1000). After compression, a total average power of 450–500 mW and pulse duration of 100 fs are obtained. The repetition rate of the output beam is reduced to 100 Hz by a mechanical chopper in order to avoid the photodegradation of the sample.
The 520 nm pump pulses (energy reduced at 100 nJ per pulse) are obtained by Sum Frequency Generation (SFG) of the signal output of an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS by Light Conversion, Vilnius, Lithuania) with a portion of the laser fundamental output at 800 nm. The polarization angle between pump and probe beams is adjusted at 54.7° so as to exclude rotational contributions to the transient signal. Multichannel detection for transient spectroscopy is achieved by sending the white light continuum after passing through the sample to a flat field monochromator coupled to a home-made CCD detector. [http://lens.unifi.it/ew]
Femtosecond visible-pump/mid-IR probe experiments are performed using the set-up previously described.36 About 20% of the output of a regenerative amplified Ti:sapphire oscillator system (Coherent Legend Elite, 810 nm central wavelength, 1 KHz rep. rate, pulse energy >3 mJ per pulse, 35 fs pulse duration) is employed for the experiment. A fraction (∼70 μJ per pulse) of the output is directed to a home-built Non-Collinear Optical Parametric Amplifer (NOPA), producing tunable visible-light pulses in the 450–700 nm range. For the present experiment the bandwidth is reduced to approximately 60 nm and is centered at 520 nm with an energy/pulse of around 500 nJ.
A second portion (∼300 μJ per pulse) of the 810 nm fundamental is used to pump a home-built OPA producing near-IR pulses; the difference frequency of idler and signal is finally generated in a 1 mm thick AgGaS2 crystal providing tunable pulses in the mid-IR region. Around λ = 6 μm, spectrally broad pulses (typical bandwidth >200 cm−1) are obtained with an energy of about 1 μJ and duration of ∼150 fs. A fraction (4–5%) of the mid-IR output passes through a half-wave plate controlling the polarization and is used as the source of probe and reference beams in the experiment. The probe and reference beams, of equal intensity, are obtained by reflection from the faces of a wedged CaF2 plate and focused onto the sample using a parabolic mirror. Both probe and reference beams are sent to a flat-field monochromator and imaged onto a double 32-channel array mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) infrared detector.
The infrared probe has been tuned to monitor spectral changes in both the CN and CO absorbing region, respectively centered around 2100 and 1700 cm−1. All measurements have been performed at room temperature. The integrity of the samples has been checked using a UV-Vis absorption (Lambda900) and FTIR (Bruker Alpha-T) before and after the ultrafast measurements.
Data analysis
The quantitative analysis of the data obtained by the ultrafast transient visible absorption and transient IR experiments has been performed using a combined approach consisting of singular values decomposition (SVD) and global fitting. Both steps are performed using the GLOTARAN package.37 The number of kinetic components has been defined through the SVD procedure. The following parameterization of the time evolution of the relative intensities and of the associated spectral contributions (evolution associated decay spectra, EADS) has been performed by adopting a unidirectional sequential model with increasing lifetimes.
Computational details
To suitably model the ground and the excited state vibrational and visible spectra and their changes as a consequence of the hydrogen bond network modifications, we optimized the molecular structure of (i) protonated dye (Z907), (ii) protonated dye with two EtOH molecules interacting with the −NCS ligands (hereafter indicated as Z907+2EtOH_NCS, Fig. 1A) and (iii) protonated dye with two EtOH molecules interacting with the −COOH groups (hereafter indicated as Z907+2EtOH_COOH, Fig. 1B) both in the ground (GS) and triplet excited state (T). The geometry optimizations and the corresponding frequencies calculations were performed using the B3LYP38 exchange–correlation (xc) functional and a 3-21G* basis set, this being a well-assessed protocol for the characterization of Ru-based metal complexes.13,39 The implicit solvent–solute interactions, for both EtOH and DMSO, were modeled using the C-PCM40 approach as implemented in the Gaussian 09 (G09) program package.41 Excited state calculations on the isolated Z907 in EtOH and DMSO as well as on the Z907+2EtOH_COOH/Z907+2EtOH_CN adducts in EtOH were carried out using the B3LYP xc functional and the DGDZVP basis set.42

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Ultrafast visible measurements in solution
The TAS spectra measured for Z907 in EtOH and DMSO are reported in Fig. 2 at different pump–probe delay times.
 Fig. 2  (A) UV/Vis transient absorption spectra of Z907 upon excitation at 520 nm in (A) EtOH and (B) DMSO solution. 
The spectra in both solvents are characterized by the onset of the negative signal due to the ground state bleaching (minimum at 520 nm masked by a cut-off filter) and by a broad positive excited state absorption signal (ESA) in the range 600–750 nm which was ascribed to the long lived triplet 3LML'CT transition.3,20 The excited state triplet absorption appears on an ultrafast timescale, below the instrument time resolution, confirming the occurrence of intersystem crossing from the initially excited 1LML'CT on a <100 fs timescale, as previously reported for this molecule and similar systems.3 The subsequent spectral evolution is notably different in the two analyzed solvents. While in DMSO only a minor band-shape change is observed on a timescale of a few picoseconds, a significant red-shift is noted in EtOH, occurring on a 20–30 ps timescale. The evolution of the transient absorption spectra is better visualized by observing the EADS obtained by global analysis of the data, shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  EADS obtained from global analysis of the transient absorption data recorded for the Z907 dye upon excitation at 520 nm in (A) EtOH and (B) DMSO solution. Normalized EADS are shown in the inset of each panel. 
In EtOH four different time components are necessary to suitably fit the data, while only two time constants are sufficient in the case of the DMSO solution. The fit procedure shows a good convergence, with residual error values <0.003 in both cases. The interpretation of the excited state evolution in DMSO is quite straightforward: upon the ultrafast formation of the 3LML'CT state, occurring on a <100 fs timescale, intramolecular vibrational relaxation occurs on a 9–10 ps timescale, followed by ground state recovery on a timescale longer than the interval probed within our measurements. In a protic medium like EtOH additional dynamics, possibly connected with hydrogen-bond rearrangement, is observed. A global fit of the kinetic traces in this solvent retrieves two ps components: the first 2.4 ps component results in an increased intensity of the 3LML'CT excited state absorption band, while the following 24 ps component is associated with a 20 nm red-shift of the same band. Although no significant spectral change is associated with the following 164 ps component, a decay component on this timescale is clearly visible for kinetic traces at wavelengths >650 nm (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Similarly a small shift of the maximum of the broad feature around 700 nm is observed in the first 500 ps, possibly associated with solvent induced relaxation. The relaxation dynamics of alcohols such EtOH shows, in fact, a component in the hundreds of picosecond interval.43 The determination of the long time decay lifetime suffers from a relatively higher error than that associated with the shorter lifetimes, due to the limited time window probed within our measurements.
3.2 Ultrafast transient IR measurements in solution
In order to further investigate the relaxation dynamics of Z907 in solution we performed ultrafast infrared measurements, probing both the CO and the CN absorption regions, in EtOH and in DMSO. The latter solvent has been chosen for its high polarizability and its capability of forming hydrogen bonds acting only as a proton acceptor. Thanks to these properties DMSO should react faster than EtOH to the solute charge redistribution.43 In the excited state both the CO and CN bands downshift as a consequence of the intramolecular charge transfer. Upon visible light absorption electron density moves from the isothiocyanate towards the bipyridine ligands, which determines a downshift of the CO absorption frequency, due to the increased charge density accumulation on the molecular moiety on which these functional groups are located. Concerning the thiocyanates, upon charge transfer from the ruthenium center towards the bipyridine ligands, their electronic structure can be predominantly seen as [Ru:N(−)CS], where the CN stretching is expected to absorb at lower frequencies compared with the absorption of the [Ru:NC–S(−)] structure prevailing in the ground state.

Fig. 4 reports the EADS obtained by globally fitting the kinetic traces recorded in the CO absorption region (centered around 1670 cm−1) in the two analyzed solvents, selected time resolved spectra are reported in the ESI† (Fig. S4).
 Fig. 4  Evolution associated decay spectra obtained by global analysis of the IR transient data referring to the CO absorption region in (A) EtOH, (B) DMSO. 
As it can be noticed, the spectral evolution in the CO region is markedly different in the two analyzed solvents. As already observed from TAS measurements, three kinetic components are necessary to correctly fit the transient data recorded in EtOH solution, while only two time constants are sufficient in the case of DMSO. The lifetimes obtained in the infrared range are comparable with those obtained in the visible range. In EtOH the CO stretching absorption initially downshifts from 1710 cm−1 in the ground state to 1675 cm−1. The excited state absorption band is initially very broad and unstructured and undergoes a small narrowing and intensity change on an ∼1 ps timescale. Following this fast evolution, which could be due to fast relaxation in the non-thermalized ultrafast formed 3LML'CT, we observe a significant narrowing and a further 5 cm−1 red-shift of the band, occurring on the 30 ps timescale. Finally the system relaxes to the ground state on a long timescale, not accessible within our time measuring window. In the non-protic DMSO, the evolution is much simpler and no significant band shape change or band shifts are observed. The 4 ps lifetime obtained from global analysis can be interpreted in terms of vibrational relaxation in the readily formed 3LML'CT state.
The EADS obtained by globally fitting the data recorded in the CN absorption region (centered around 2050 cm−1) are reported in Fig. 5, selected time resolved spectra are reported in the ESI† for both ETOH and DMSO (Fig. S5).
 Fig. 5  Evolution associated decay spectra obtained by global analysis of the IR transient data referring to the CN absorption region in (A) EtOH, (B) DMSO. 
The spectral evolution in the CN region again shows a different behavior in the two solvents.
A single peak due to ground state bleaching is observed at 2107 cm−1 in EtOH (2103 cm−1 DMSO), which has been assigned to both symmetric and antisymmetric CN stretching.44 In the excited state the CN absorption moves to lower frequencies and in both solvent a double peak structure develops on a few picoseconds timescale. The two bands observed on the long timescale at 2056 and 2083 cm−1 in EtOH (2062 and 2083 cm−1 in DMSO) can be attributed to the symmetric and antisymmetric CN stretching, whose absorption maxima are more separated in the excited state due to an increased vibrational coupling among these two modes, caused by the electronic redistribution following the LML'CT transition.
In EtOH the CN excited state absorption band is initially very broad, peaking 2070 cm−1 and undergoes a significant narrowing on a 1.4 ps timescale. Based on the results of a recent 2D IR study executed on the analogous N3 dye, this dynamic phase can be attributed to vibrational energy redistribution among the symmetric and antisymmetric CN stretchings.45 Following this initial evolution, the excited state band becomes more structured, leading to the appearance of a clear double peak on a 24 ps timescale, with the lower frequency peak downshifted with respect to the initial central frequency. The timescale of this evolution is similar to that previously determined both from visible transient absorption and in the CO absorption region in the same solvent. Since a dynamic evolution on a comparable timescale is not observed in DMSO we attribute it to solvent reorganization involving hydrogen-bond dynamics. In DMSO the spectral evolution is rather limited. A double peak structure in the CN excited state absorption develops on a 0.5 ps timescale, but at later times only a modest band narrowing on a 10 ps time scale is observed, which can be attributed to vibrational cooling. Finally, on a long timescale (behind our measuring time) ground state is recovered, but no spectral shift is observed.
3.3 Computational analyses
On the basis of the results of all the transient measurements reported above and the differences observed in protic and non-protic solvents, here we shall derive a theoretical framework to explain the dynamics observed for Z907 in solution, by modeling the IR and UV-Vis response in different environments.
Notice that similar combinations of theoretical tools and IR spectroscopy were recently employed to characterize weak intermolecular interactions in complex biological systems.46
The excitation at 520 nm brings population to the excited 1LML'CT that relaxes on an ultrafast time scale on the 3LML'CT, meaning that the charge redistribution within the metal complex is extremely fast and the solvent molecules do not have the time to re-equilibrate their charge and hydrogen-bond distances in such a fast time. As we shall discuss, the subsequent dynamics is thus dominated by solvent relaxation and hydrogen-bond strengthening/weakening in the case of EtOH, in response to the mutated electronic distribution in the different functional groups of the molecule. As a matter of fact, in our calculations we cannot simulate the weakening/strengthening of the hydrogen bonds, as we can only reproduce the equilibrium situations that to say: (i) the Z907+2EtOH_COOH (or Z907+2EtOH_NCS) adduct (see structures in Fig. 1), with stable hydrogen-bonds; (ii) the Z907 dye alone.
Upon excitation, negative charge flows towards the bipyridine ligands, yielding a charge depletion on the thiocyanate ligands and charge accumulation on the carboxylic groups (see the HOMO–LUMO density difference plot in Fig. 6). According to this charge redistribution it can be reasonably hypothesized a weakening of the EtOH-NCS hydrogen-bonds accompanied by a strengthening of the EtOH-OCOH interactions.
 Fig. 6  Isodensity plots of the HOMO–LUMO density difference of the Z907 complex. Red/blue lobes correspond to charge depletion/accumulation. 
The analysis of the Z907-EtOH adducts in the ground and in the triplet states at equilibrium geometries provides us indications about the rearrangement of the solvent molecules upon excitation. As shown by the binding energies and the hydrogen-bond distances reported in Table 1, in the Z907+2EtOH_SCN adduct, the interaction becomes weaker (the distance longer) going from the ground state to the triplet, in agreement with the calculated charge depletion on the ligands in the excited state (see the Mulliken charge values listed in Table 2). On the contrary, in the Z907+2EtOH_COOH adduct, upon excitation, as a consequence of the increased charge on the COOH groups (Table 1), the hydrogen-bond becomes markedly stronger, with a gain of more than 10 kcal mol−1 in the binding energy of the Z907–EtOH complex.

The comparison between the calculated and experimental differential IR spectra is plotted in Fig. 7(A) and (B) for the CO and CN stretching, respectively; note that, for an easier visual evaluation, the position of the ground state bleaching in the simulated spectra was shifted so to coincide to that of the experimental ones. Furthermore, to highlight the effect of the explicit solvent molecules in the excited state, we shifted the relative position of the simulated spectra for the Z907 with and without the explicit solvent so as to align the bleaching position in the two cases.
 Fig. 7  (A) Comparison between experimental and calculated transient IR spectra in the (A) CO and (B) CN absorption region. In the left panel of Fig. 7(A) and (B) black/blue lines are the short/long leaving EADS component shown in Fig. 4(A) and 5(A). 
As expected on the basis of the indications obtained by the calculated bond distances and adduct binding energies, we reproduced the spectral shift in the CO stretching (Fig. 7A), where the hydrogen-bond is supposed to be reinforced in the triplet state, by simulating the early times neglecting the solute–solvent interaction (Z907 alone, black line), and the longer times by computing the IR spectrum of the Z907+2EtOH_COOH adduct (blue line). As it can be noticed, the model is able to nicely reproduce the measured spectral modifications, predicting a red-shift of 36 cm−1 to be compared to that experimentally determined of 9 cm−1. The overestimation of the calculated spectral shift is, however, not surprising, since our picture considers the two limit cases in the hydrogen-bond formation/breaking. In the case of the CN stretching, where upon excitation the hydrogen bonds are supposed to become weaker, we simulate the early times with the Z907+2EtOH_NCS adduct (black line in Fig. 7B), whereas longer delay times with the isolated dye (blue line in Fig. 7B). The calculated spectra qualitatively reproduce the observed evolution: the excited state red-shift of the CN absorption is well reproduced, as well as the observed relative intensity change of the two excited state absorption band on a long timescale.
In order to highlight the differences between the protic and non-protic solvents examined in this work we also simulated the transient infrared spectra for Z907 in DMSO. The results are reported in the ESI† (Fig. S5) for both the CO and CN regions, where it is shown that the calculated spectra well reproduce the excited state downshift of both the CO and CN absorptions observed in the experiments. Furthermore the calculated UV-Vis absorption spectra in both solvents are reported in the ESI† (Fig. S6).
3.4 Electron injection dynamics on TiO2
Besides studying the dynamics of Z907 in solution we have also monitored both the behavior of the molecule when adsorbed on a non-conductive ZrO2 substrate and the electron injection dynamics into the TiO2 CB. The measurements for the sample adsorbed on both solid substrates have been conducted without covering the sample with any solvent, but keeping it under dry nitrogen flux during the measurement. We have analyzed the systems by transient infrared spectroscopy, probing the CN absorption region. The EADS obtained by a global fit of the data measured for Z907 adsorbed on ZrO2 are reported in Fig. 8, together with the kinetic trace at 2055 cm−1 and the relative fit.

As can be noticed from Fig. 8, the CN stretching absorbs at a slightly lower frequency in the ground state when the molecule is adsorbed on the ZrO2 substrate with respect to both the analysed solvents, indicating a slight weakening of the CN bond possibly due to a higher degree of charge localization on the bipyridine molecular moiety coordinated to the surface. In the excited state the CN absorptions shift to lower frequency, as expected because of the reduced CN bond order following the LML'CT transition. Contrarily to what is observed in solution, the symmetric and antisymmetric stretchings are not well separated and a broad excited state band is observed, peaking at 2056 cm−1. Only a weak shoulder at 2076 cm−1 can be resolved. The dynamic evolution of the signal is very limited: the excited state absorption band slightly sharpens on a 1.8 ps timescale, probably reflecting vibrational population equilibration among the two CN groups45 and successively decays by about 20% on a 66 ps timescale, as can clearly be noticed by inspecting the kinetic trace reported in Fig. 8B. The decay of the excited state absorption band is not accompanied by a comparative bleaching recovery. The intensity of the latter signal is almost unchanged during the time interval probed by our measurements, indicating only minimal ground state recovery. Although injection into the ZrO2 CB is prevented due to the high band gap of this material (∼5 eV), electron transfer is possible towards surface states, whose energy is below that of the CB. This process has been observed for several bipyridyl metal complexes and organic dyes, and is favoured when a quite strong coupling between the dye and the surface is established.44,47–50 In our case, the observed shift of the CN absorption band suggests that coordination with the ZrO2 surface can induce a charge localization on the coordinating bipyridine moiety, favouring the formation of charge transfer states. Furthermore, if electron transfer to surface states is operative in Z907 adsorbed on ZrO2, charge recombination could also be observed. In the case of several organic dyes a substantial signal decrease has been observed on a nanosecond time scale, due to back electron transfer from the ZrO2.48,50 In our system we only notice a slight recovery of the bleaching signal, which could be due to charge recombination from trap or defect surface states.
When Z907 is adsorbed onto a TiO2 substrate, the typical broad absorption due to free electrons injected into the semiconductor CB is observed in the probed mid-IR region, as shown in Fig. 9. Superimposed onto the electron signal, bleaching and excited state absorption of the CN groups is also observed. By inspecting the kinetic traces in the analysed IR region, as that at 2150 cm−1 reported in Fig. 9B, it is possible to notice that almost 70% of the signal rises on a time scale <100 fs, thus below our instrument time resolution.

By fitting the kinetic traces in the region where no absorption bands of the molecule are observed, it is possible to retrieve the electron injection kinetics into the TiO2 CB. As can be noticed the electron injection is markedly multi-exponential. Fitting the kinetic trace reported in Fig. 9B, by excluding the initial 500 fs, and considering that 70% of the injection occurs on a time scale <100 fs, gives time components of 0.6 ps (15%), 15 ps (6%) and 325 ps (9%). Similar picosecond injection components have been reported for other ruthenium-bipyridine dyes such as N3 and N719 and ascribed to injection from the thermalized 3LML'CT state.3,20,51 The time constants of the slower injection dynamics from the long lived triplet state show a high degree of variability among the previously conducted studies.3 It has been shown that the longer time constants are highly dependent on the experimental conditions, such as excitation wavelength and excitation power, presence of trap states into the semiconductor as well as on sample preparation and degradation.21 Also, the presence of electrolytes such as I−/I3− can affect the long-time component of the electron injection, because of a stabilizing effect on the dye cation, as has been recently shown.52 In the case of our measurements, the longer injection components of 15 and 325 ps could also be ascribed to the formation of aggregates or the presence of differently-oriented adsorbed molecules (Z907 has a bulky substituent on one of the bipyridines which could cause more heterogeneous absorption) or to partial sample degradation.
4. Conclusions
We have investigated the excited state relaxation dynamics of the Z907 dye in two different solvents using both transient visible and infrared spectroscopy. Upon excitation with visible light, ultrafast intersystem crossing from the initially excited 1LML'CT state occurs, with a time constant comparable with our instrumental time resolution (<100 fs). The following dynamics can be rationalized in terms of vibrational cooling in the promptly formed 3LML'CT state. In a protic solvent like EtOH additional slow dynamics is observed on a 30 ps time scale, which has been interpreted in terms of the hydrogen bond rearrangement on the basis of the experimental observation and DFT/TDDFT calculations. The analysis of the injection dynamics in the mid-IR spectral range confirms a two state electron transfer mechanism previously proposed for similar dyes N3 and N719. Upon light absorption, electrons are injected for almost 70% on an ultrafast time scale (<100 fs) from the initially excited non-thermalized 1LML'CT. Triplet formation competes with this fast injection dynamics. The following slower picosecond injection components occur from the relaxed triplet state. Electron transfer from the 3LML'CT is highly multi-exponential, as previously reported for similar molecules.
