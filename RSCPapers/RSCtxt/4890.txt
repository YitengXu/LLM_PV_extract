1. Introduction
Solution-processable, small conjugated molecules for organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their advantages of high purity and definite molecular weight, and potential in generating large-area, flexible, and light weight devices using roll-to-roll printing techniques.1–16 Acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type frames are a successful molecular design strategy to broaden absorption, to generate high hole mobility, and to obtain suitable energy levels.17–21 Until now, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 9% based on this strategy.19 In contrast to polymer-based devices, however, the self-assembly of small molecules into ordered domains is highly crucial because of their reduced π-conjugated length, which in turn results in a charge transfer dominated by the intermolecular hopping rate.14,22,23 Nevertheless, self-assembly behavior is extremely sensitive to molecular structures because a slight change in either π-orbital overlap or an indirect vibrationally mediated coupling would vary hole mobility by orders of magnitude.15,24–26 Consequently, knowing the influences of subtle structural changes on molecular packing and the relationship between the structure and device performance are significant in the further optimization of molecular design.
End-capped acceptors profoundly influence the molecular interaction among A–D–A frames.27–31 Chen et al. introduced different end-capped acceptors that were converted from alkylated 2-cyanoacetate to aromatic 1,3-indanedione into the thiopheneonbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) or thiophene core. Different acceptors influence molecular solubility, planarity, and packing; therefore, the PCE varies from 1% to 8%.4,27,30 Kim et al. changed the terminal acceptors from alkylated 2-cyanoacetate to 2-cyano-N-octylacetamide with a strong hydrogen bond. Hence, the molecular packing and orientation were significantly changed.29 However, the above mentioned end-capped acceptors deviate considerably from one another. Otherwise, their effects on molecular packing are lack of elaboration and guidance. To effectively optimize the molecular design in the A–D–A frame, the subtle regulation of end-capped acceptor units and their definite influences on molecular photovoltaic properties must be investigated.
Alkylated ester, ketone, and sulfonyl are successful electron-deficient groups without significant structural differences. The PCEs of polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on these electron-withdrawing units, which are attached to the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) block as acceptors, reached ca. 8% through carefully structural adjustments.32–34 In addition, the three incremental electron-deficient groups can be attached easily to other aromatic nucleus, such as thiophene, benzene, and diketopyrrolopyrrole, to further tune molecular electron cloud density. According to investigations into PSCs, the modulation of electron-withdrawing capability effectively improves device performance by red-shifting the absorption spectrum and lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level to enhance open-circuit voltage (Voc).32,34–37 However, systematic research on the effects of the three electron-deficient groups on photovoltaic materials is lacking.
In this work, three subtle structural changed end-capped acceptors with increased electron withdrawing ability, named octyl 2-cyanoacetate (CNCOOC8H17), 3-oxoundecanenitrile (CNCOC8H17), and 2-(octylsulfonyl) acetonitrile (CNSOOC8H17), were synthesized and introduced to a planar conjugated backbone using ethylhexyl-thiophene substituted benzodithiophene (TBDT) as a core and trithiophene as a π-bridge (labelled M1, M2 and M3, respectively, Scheme 1). The incremental electron-deficient abilities lower HOMO levels and red-shift solution absorption slightly. However, the different molecular interactions and packing vary the absorption in film, thermal properties, charge transfers, and morphologies. Specifically, the hole mobilities differ by orders of magnitude. As a result of the increased electron-withdrawing capability, M2 displays the best absorption spectrum, the lowest HOMO level, and a PCE of 6.4% with a maximum current density (Jsc) of 10.2 mA cm−2. Given that M1 possesses the strongest molecular interaction and the best hole mobility, it exhibits a PCE of 6.4% with a maximum fill factor (FF) of 72%. M3 exhibits a highest Voc of 0.93 V, but lower Jsc and FF resulting from its relatively poor molecular packing and crystalline, and the optimized PCE is 3.0%. The relationship between end-capped acceptors and photovoltaic properties generates valuable insights for the design of increasingly efficient solution-processable OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The synthesis routes of M1 and M3 are illustrated in Scheme 2. The synthesis process of M2 was presented in our previous work.38M1 was synthesized through common Knoevenagel condensation and catalyzed through triethylamine. The acceptor 2-(octylsulfonyl) acetonitrile (CNCH2SOOC8H17) was synthesized in two steps. First, octane-1-thiol was added to a mixture of 2-chloroacetonitrile and a 25% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. Then, 2-(octylthio) acetonitrile was oxidized using 30% hydrogen peroxide to obtain an acceptor unit with a total yield of 85%. M3 was prepared using modified Knoevenagel condensation of the acceptor units with an aldehyde precursor catalyzed by pyridine and TiCl4. All three materials are well-soluble in common solvents, such as chloroform, toluene, and tetrahydrofuran. The thermal properties of the three bulk materials were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Fig. 1) and thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†). M1 and M2 exhibit single, sharp, and strong crystalline exothermic peaks. Their melting points are 199 °C and 194 °C. M3 displays two weak crystalline exothermic peaks, and these peaks should be ascribed to two crystal forms, which are further obtained separately through different cooling speeds with grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) (Fig. S2, ESI†). Their melting points are 193 °C and 180 °C. The different melting points and tendencies of the crystalline domains should be attributed to various molecular interactions.5,38 Thus, M1 exhibits the strongest molecular interaction, whereas M3 shows the weakest. Hence, the subtle change in the end-capped acceptors significantly influences molecular packing and crystalline. The molecular interaction and crystalline behavior is crucial for donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells because they provide driving forces to aid phase separation from acceptors, which ultimately affect device performance.39

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-visible optical absorption spectra and absorption coefficients of the three small molecules in CHCl3 solution and solid films are shown in Fig. 2. The data are detailed in Table 1. The spectra of the three materials in the solution are in the same shape. All of them display π–π* transitions at short wavelengths and intramolecular charge transfers at the low energy levels.40,41 The absorption edges of M1, M2, and M3 in solution are 595, 618, and 609 nm, respectively. The red-shifted edges of M2 and M3 should be ascribed to the strengthened electron-withdrawing capability of the CNCOC8H17 and CNSOOC8H17 groups. In comparison with the absorption spectra in the films with solution, a strong shoulder peak at long wavelengths is observed at ca. 615 and 630 nm for M1 and M2, respectively, and the absorption edges are red-shifted at ca. 90 nm. However, M3 does not exhibit a clear shoulder peak, and its absorption edge is considerably less red-shifted than those of the other two. Moreover, the absorption coefficient of M3 is much lower than those of M1 and M2. The differences in absorption redshifts from solutions to films and coefficients in films indicate that M1 and M2 exhibit excellent molecular stacking, whereas M3 shows poor molecular packing. This result agrees well with the DSC result. The optical band gaps of M1, M2, and M3 in the thin films are estimated from the absorption edges to be approximately 1.84, 1.76, and 1.85 eV, respectively.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 3) was conducted to measure the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the three small molecules. The data on the electronic properties of the molecules are detailed in Table 1. The HOMO levels of M1, M2, and M3 are −5.08, −5.18, and −5.11 eV, respectively. The corresponding LUMO levels are −3.47, −3.46 and −3.46 eV. These levels are calculated from the onset of oxidation (φox) and from the onset of reduction (φred) vs. Ag+/Ag according to the equations HOMO = −e(φox + 4.71) (eV) and LUMO = −e(φred + 4.71) (eV).40,42,43 The calculated energy levels (Fig. S3, gas states, ESI†) show some difference with the measurement (solid states), which should be due to the aggregation in solid states. The difference in HOMO energy levels confirms that the proper strengthening of the withdrawing capability of the acceptors could effectively lower the HOMO level to increase Voc.34 The superior energy levels of the three molecules over that of 6,6-phenyl-C71-butyricacid methyl ester (PC71BM) also reflect their suitability for application as photovoltaic donors with PC71BM as acceptors in OSCs.44

2.3. Photovoltaic properties of OSC devices
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the three small molecules, BHJ solar cells were fabricated with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Donor (D):PCBM (A)/Ca (ca. 20 nm)/Al (ca. 100 nm). The current–voltage (J–V) curves of these devices under optimal conditions at AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination are displayed in Fig. 4a and b along with their corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. The results are detailed in Table 2. The most efficient photovoltaic cells based on the three materials are obtained from BHJ systems under the same optimized conditions using PC71BM as an acceptor, at a weight ratio of 1.5:1 (D:A) (the J–V curves are presented in Fig. S4, ESI† and the data are detailed in Table S1, ESI†) and at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 (D) with 0.4% (v:v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additives. As a result, M1 shows a PCE of 6.4% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 9.98 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 72%. M2 reports a PCE of 6.4% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 10.2 mA cm−2, and a FF of 68%. M3 exhibits a PCE of 3.0% with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 6.1 mA cm−2, and a FF of 52.8%. Comparing the Jsc from the J–V measurement, the ideal Jsc calculated from EQE is 9.52, 9.79, 6.10 mA cm−2 for the devices based on M1, M2, M3, respectively, and the errors are in the range of 5%, which is acceptable considering the measurement error. The differences in Voc are mainly ascribed to the lowered HOMO level of M2 and M3 compared with M1 (Table 1), which bear stronger electron deficient groups. The slightly increase in the Jsc value of M2 should be attributed to its enhanced absorption spectrum (Fig. 2). The variation in FF, which ranged from 52.8% to 72%, is analyzed in the following sections.

2.4. Hole mobility and molecular packing

2.4.1. Hole mobility. 
The significant difference in the FFs of the three molecules may be ascribed to the various hole mobilities. The hole mobilities of the pristine small molecules and of the blends with 0.4% DIO were measured using the hole-only space-charge-limited current method in a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D or of D:A (1.5:1) with DIO/Au. The hole mobilities based on the three materials exhibit the same tendency and vary by orders of magnitude in both pristine and DIO-blended films. Specifically, the hole mobilities of the blends with 0.4% DIO are calculated to be 1.2 × 10−4, 4 × 10−5 and 1.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for M1, M2 and M3, respectively (Fig. 5). Those of pristine films are computed to be 1.6 × 10−3, 3.3 × 10−4 and 1.2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S5, ESI†). The significantly low mobility of M3 indicates that charges cannot be extracted efficiently prior to recombination from mutual columbic attraction. As a result, FF and Jsc values are low.45–47 In this study, the maximum mobility of M1 results in the highest FF. Hole mobility is determined by the intramolecular backbone and intermolecular packing. The backbones of the three materials are nearly the same; therefore, the significant difference in the mobilities is probably dependent on the molecular packing induced by the end-capped acceptors.

2.4.2. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). 
The molecular packing of the three molecules was investigated through GIWAXS to elucidate the diversity in the hole mobilities of the pristine and optimized blend films with/without DIO, especially GIWAXS between M1 and M2. All films were cast from chloroform on the Si substrate under optimized device fabrication conditions at the same concentration and DIO ratios. The out-of-plane and in-plane profiles of the DIO blends are shown in Fig. 6. Based on the comparisons of the blends with/without DIO and pristine films (Fig. S6, ESI†), the addition of DIO and PC71BM does not change the crystalline orientations and the positions of the peaks. Both M1 and M2 films exhibit out-of-plane (h00) (h = 1, 2, 3) peaks and in-plane (100) peaks, and the (010) π-stacking peak is distinct only in the in-plane profile, thus indicating that both molecules adopt the edge-on packing style. Nonetheless, the π-stacking distances of the two materials are quite different. The d-spacing of π–π stacking in M1 (3.67 Å, 2π/q) is less than that of M2 (3.72 Å, 2π/q), thereby implying that M1 facilitates stronger electron coupling. Consequently, its hole mobility is higher.48 The probable reasons for this finding may be that the ester group has an additional lone pair of electrons in the oxygen atoms and/or that the additional oxygen atoms in the ester group are less resistant than the sp3-hybridized carbons linked to the conjugated backbone. Both factors facilitate molecular interaction.

The molecular packing of M3 is much weaker because of the reduced scattering intensity and the absence of (200) (300) peaks observed in the out-of-plane profile. This result is consistent with its film absorption and its significantly low hole mobility. Unexpectedly, the addition of DIO (as observed in Fig. 6) influences the M3 crystal strongly in comparison to the blend film without DIO (Fig. S6, ESI†). Two new peaks (q = 0.29 Å−1, 0.37 Å−1) appeared in place of the old one (q = 0.34 Å−1). The main d-spacing decreases from 18.3 Å to 16.8 Å following the addition of DIO. This addition facilitates condensed molecular packing, thus increasing the Jsc and FF.38 The poorer molecular packing of M3 may be due to the factor that the two oxygen atoms in the acceptor units are not in planarity with the conjugated backbone because of sulfur atoms is sp3-hybridized (presenting the conical tetrahedron structure), which affect the packing of molecules.

2.5. Morphology
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was conducted in tapping mode to characterize further the surface microstructure of the active layer (D:A = 1.5:1, w/w, with 0.4% DIO) (Fig. 7), that of films without DIO, and that of pristine films (Fig. S7, ESI†). As seen from phase images of the blends, all three materials generate a good interpenetrating network. However, the donors and acceptors in M3 blend films are mixed so well that much less partition of M3 is observed compared with the other two. This discrepancy influences the phase purity and reduces FF and Jsc values.38 The phase morphologies of the films based on M1 and M2 differ in size; however, they both remain within the proper domain range and maintain sizes that facilitate appropriate charge separation. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images demonstrate that M1 and M2 in blend films with DIO (Fig. 8)/without DIO (Fig. S8, ESI†) exhibit definitely donor and acceptor interfaces, while M3 show fuzzy ones. This further shows that M3 in blend films mixes too well, resulting in poor phase purity, higher charge recombination and thus lower FF. Compared with the images without DIO, the images with DIO show increased donor and acceptor interfaces, which facilitate exciton dissociations and therefore enhance the device performance.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, three small molecules M1, M2 and M3 bearing subtle structural change but with incremental electron deficient end-capped acceptors C(CN)COR, C(CN)COOR and C(CN)SOOR combining with a conjugated backbone were synthesized and characterized. The increase in electron-deficient capability can red shift solution absorption and lower the HOMO energy levels. Given the different molecular packing, the end-capped acceptors significantly influenced the absorption in films, thermal properties, hole mobilities, and morphologies. The devices based on M1 and M2 reported similar PCEs of over 6% by combining electron-withdrawing capability with molecular packing. Nonetheless, their Voc and FF values vary. Hence, C(CN)COR and C(CN)COOR are potential end-acceptors that can be used to tune different parameters according to various molecular backbones. In addition, investigating the effects of alkylated ester, ketone, and sulfonyl can also guide further molecular modification by applying the three electron-deficient groups. Moreover, the relationship between end-capped acceptors and photovoltaic properties can generate valuable insights into the production of increasingly efficient, solution-processable OSCs.
