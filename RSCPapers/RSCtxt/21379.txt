    , Accepted 29th September 2018First published on 2nd October 2018AbstractAn omnidirectional and broadband optical absorber has long been pursued for its wide application in optics, sensing and energy fields. The recent development of flexible and non-planar optoelectronic devices, however, poses a great challenge to fabricate an optical absorber with excellent mechanical flexibility. Here, based on a facile solution method, we demonstrate an ultra-flexible plasmonic metamaterial film (PMF), which is a composite of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and aramid nanofibers, to achieve omnidirectional and broadband optical absorption. Due to the comprehensive contributions of the anti-reflection effect of the PMF surface, localized surface plasmon resonances of the Au NPs, and non-resonant decay of light inside the nanocomposite, the PMF exhibits highly efficient omnidirectional and broadband absorption at visible and near-infrared frequencies. In addition, it also presents exceptional mechanical and fast collective light-heating properties, which makes it promising to be applied on flexible and non-planar photo-thermal devices.
Introduction
An ideal optical absorber with an omnidirectional high absorption efficiency has long been a major scientific and technological goal. In recent years, optical absorbers based on metamaterials, which are artificially structured materials made from arrays of subwavelength unit-cells, have been widely investigated and developed.1–3 In general, metamaterial optical absorbers can be categorized into two types: narrowband and broadband. Narrowband metamaterial absorbers always rely on the resonance effect of structures interacting with light at a specific frequency.4–17 In contrast, broadband metamaterial absorbers rely on structures whose electromagnetic responses are frequency independent and thus can absorb light over a large bandwidth.18–40 As a result, broadband metamaterial absorbers are very attractive for a wide range of optical applications, such as solar–thermal energy harvesting,18–20 sensor platforms for full-spectrum imaging21 and photodetection.22
Tremendous progress has been made toward the implementation of metamaterial-based broadband optical absorbers. For example, nanopatterned anisotropic metamaterials have been demonstrated for efficient optical absorption at visible28 and infrared frequencies.25,29 Metamaterials made of noble metal-coated nanoporous templates also exhibit excellent broadband absorption performances.19,20 In addition, refractory materials, such as vanadium dioxide26 and titanium nitride,30 have been recently employed to construct nanostructured broadband metamaterial absorbers. Nevertheless, there are still several limitations that hinder the application of these metamaterial absorbers to niche applications. First, nanostructured metamaterial absorbers are typically fabricated by top-down nanofabrication methods,1–23,28–30,37–40 such as electron beam lithography (EBL) and focused ion beam (FIB) milling, which inherently limit the absorber's maximum footprint and manufacture throughput. Second, most of the reported metamaterial absorbers are fabricated on rigid substrates, such as glass and silicon wafer. This makes the devices be short of flexibility and significantly limits their applications in wearable and other optical systems with non-planar surfaces. Although some experimental attempts have been performed to fabricate metamaterials on flexible substrates, like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)32 or polyethylene terephthalate film,33 the strength and strain of the periodical metamaterial structures are not as good as that of the flexible substrate, which lower the devices’ overall mechanical performances and need to be significantly developed for practical applications. Therefore, how to employ high-throughput techniques to fabricate a free-standing and flexible metamaterial absorber with high performance of omnidirectional and broadband optical absorption is still challenging.
Here, we propose and demonstrate an ultra-flexible, self-supporting plasmonic metamaterial film (PMF) exhibiting efficient and omnidirectional broadband optical absorption across visible and near-infrared frequencies. The PMF is composed of aramid nanofibers (ANFs) and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). ANFs self-assemble and form a porous three-dimensional (3D) matrix, where the Au NPs are loaded onto and between the nanofibers. We choose ANF to form the matrix because it is of exceptional mechanical strength,41,42 which leads to the ultra-flexibility of the PMF. When illuminated by the light source, the PMF exhibits a collective and fast temperature response due to the efficient optical absorption and photo-thermal energy conversion. Also importantly, the lithography-free fabrication of PMF is facile and easy to scale, which may facilitate its extensive use in practical photo-thermal applications.
Results and discussion
Fabrication of PMF
As shown in Fig. 1, we use a facile and simple solution process to fabricate the Au-ANF nanocomposite metamaterial film. An ANF dispersion is first prepared by dissolving commercial Kevlar threads in a mixed solution of dimethyl sulfoxide and potassium hydroxide [Fig. 1(a)]. The yellow colored Kevlar threads are made of aramid macroscale fibers. After being thoroughly stirred and treated using phosphoric acid, Kevlar threads are transformed into nanofibers whose dispersion is dark red [Fig. 1(b)]. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results (ESI Fig. S1†) verify that this destruction does not destroy the chemical composition of aramid. It is generated from the weakening of hydrogen bonds and the strengthening of the electrostatic repulsion between the polymer chains. Next, we synthesize Au NPs using a typical citrate reduction method,43,44 and then add a specific volume of Au NP solution into the ANF dispersion. The black mixed solution of Au NPs and ANF is thoroughly stirred to make all the components well dispersed [Fig. 1(c)]. We finally extract the Au-ANF composite from the mixed solution using vacuum filtration [Fig. 1(d)]. Because the Au-ANF film is of sufficient mechanical strength, it is easy to peel it off from the filter paper and form an ultra-flexible, self-supporting membrane, which can be folded or rolled up [Fig. 1(e)].

(e) Photograph of the flexible PMF after it is peeled off and rolled up. (f) Scanning electronic micrograph (SEM) of the nanostructure of PMF. The inset depicts that Au NPs locate along and between the aramid nanofibers. 
The scanning electronic micrograph (SEM) image [Fig. 1(f)] shows that the nanofibers feature a high aspect ratio, which is a few microns in length and only ∼80 nm in width. They self-assemble and compose the 3D matrix with plentiful open pores. The pore sizes range from 90 nm to 1.25 μm. Within these pores, Au NPs are randomly adsorbed along the ANF backbones. The interaction between Au NPs and ANFs is very strong and Au NPs can scarcely pass through the ANF matrix during the vacuum filtration. This strong interaction can be attributed to the hydrogen bonding between the amide groups of the ANF backbone and the carboxylic acid groups of the citrates that coat and stabilize the Au NPs.
Optimization of PMF's absorption performance
We first investigate the dependence of the PMF's absorption performance on the content of the Au NPs loaded in the ANF matrix. Since almost all the Au NPs can be reserved during the vacuum filtration process due to the strong Au NP–ANF interaction, it is easy to control the Au content in the PMF by adding a specific volume of Au NP solution into the ANF dispersion. Au NPs with 58 nm diameter are used, and their contents range from 0 to 9.9 wt% with a fixed film thickness about 50 μm. Elemental analysis using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) demonstrates the variation of Au contents, as shown in the ESI Fig. S2.†

Fig. 2(a) plots the experimentally measured absorption spectra of the prepared 8 samples over the visible and near-infrared bandwidth from 400 nm to 2000 nm. The corresponding photographs of the above samples are given in the ESI Fig. S3.† When no Au NP is doped, the pure ANF film performs a poor optical absorption, whose average absorbance is only close to 20%. The optical absorption increases rapidly when the Au content ranges from 0 to 5.7 wt%, but remains nearly the same when the Au content ranges from 5.7 wt% to 9.9 wt%. With 5.7 wt% Au content, the PMF has an averaged absorption efficiency higher than 95% across the entire bandwidth. Therefore, weighing the tradeoff between excellent optical absorption and low fabrication cost, we choose 5.7 wt% as the optimized Au content to conduct the following experiments.
 Fig. 2  Measured absorption spectra over the entire bandwidth of PMFs (a) with different Au contents, (b) with Au NPs in different sizes, (c) with different incident angles. 
Next, we investigate the dependence of the PMF's absorption performance on the diameter of Au NPs. The film thickness and Au content are respectively fixed at 50 μm and 5.7 wt%. The average diameters of the nanoparticles range from 21 nm to 115 nm. ESI Fig. S4 and S5† show the statistics of the size distribution and the photographs of the above PMF samples, respectively. The corresponding measured absorption spectra are plotted in Fig. 2(b). For all the Au NP sizes, the PMFs’ absorption efficiencies surpass 90% for the wavelength ranging from 400 nm to 1500 nm. When the wavelength is longer than 1500 nm, the samples with larger Au NPs (e.g. ≥42 nm in diameter) exhibit a slightly higher absorption than those with smaller Au NPs (e.g. 21 nm and 32 nm in diameter). Although the efficiency of the sample with 58 nm Au diameter is slightly higher than that of the others, the broadband average absorption varies little with further increment of the NPs’ diameter, which indicates there is a good fabrication tolerance for the PMF.
From the above results, PMF doped with 5.7 wt% 58 nm Au NPs is chosen as the optimized broadband absorber. As the angle dependence is another important criterion to evaluate an optical absorber, we further measure its absorption under sources with different incident angles. The incident angle ranges from 0° to 60° and the spectra are shown in Fig. 2(c). The absorbance under each incident angle all surpasses 90% within the entire bandwidth. These results reveal that the optical absorption of the PMF is not only broadband, but also omnidirectional.
Numerical investigation on optical absorption of PMF
To interpret the mechanism of the broadband omnidirectional perfect absorption, we perform full-wave simulations based on the 3D finite-different time-domain (FDTD) method. The PMF is represented by randomly distributed Au particles embedded in the aramid film and illuminated by a broadband plane wave source. The complex refractive index of the aramid film is measured using ellipsometry (ESI Fig. S6†). The refractive index of Au is obtained from Johnson and Christy's result.45 According to the content (5.7 wt%) and diameter (58 nm) of Au NPs, we set the density to 23 particles in 1 μm3. The simulated spectra of 1 μm-thick PMF are plotted in Fig. 3(a). Within the entire bandwidth, the reflection (R) at the PMF–air interface is very low. The absorption (A) is then calculated based on the relation that A + R + T = 1, where T is the transmission. It can be clearly seen that, for a 1 μm-thick PMF layer, the absorption efficiencies at the wavelengths ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm (LSPR region) are much higher than those at the wavelengths ranging from 800 nm to 2000 nm (non-LSPR region). Thickening the PMF, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the difference between two absorption regimes becomes smaller, and the average absorption efficiency increases and finally comes close to 100% when the thickness is larger than 33 μm, which agree well with the experimental observations.
 Fig. 3  (a) Simulated reflection, transmission, and absorption spectra of a 1 μm-thick PMF. (b) Average absorptions over LSPR band and non-LSPR band of the PMFs with different thicknesses. 
The high absorption of PMF can be attributed to the anti-reflection effect of the PMF surface, LSPR of the Au NPs, and scattering assisted non-resonant decays of light. First, the anti-reflection phenomenon is generated from the low refractive index of the Au-ANF nanocomposite, which makes the effective impedance of PMF comparable to that of air, as shown in ESI Fig. S7.† Second, the absorption at the wavelength ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm typically features the LSPR of Au NPs, where the light energy is highly concentrated and localized around the Au NPs. This result accords with the one gotten from the simulation of isolated Au NP (ESI Fig. S8†). Third, in the bandwidth from 800 nm to 2000 nm, non-LSPR decays of light dominate the absorption, which can be attributed to the intrinsic extinction coefficients of Au and ANF. The random distribution of Au NPs and the porous morphology of the ANF matrix lead to scattering and extending light paths when light passes through the PMF, which increases the amount of energy to be non-resonantly absorbed.
Mechanical and photo-thermal characterizations of PMF
The PMF's flexibility is of great importance for its applications in nonplanar or wearable devices. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4, the PMF is soft and tensile, which can maintain a good mechanical performance after being repeatedly stretched and bended. We characterize the mechanical property of the PMF doped with 5.7 wt% 58 nm Au NPs by measuring its tensile stress and Young's modulus, as shown in Fig. 4. For a 50 μm-thick PMF, the ultimate tensile strength reaches 14.42 MPa, the maximum elongation is 5.25%, and its Young's modulus is about 1.00 GPa. After being stretched and bent hundreds of times, we repeat the tensile stress tests for the PMF. No significant change is found within experimental error, which indicates that the PMF shows good durability of mechanical strength and ultra-flexibility. Fig. S9 in the ESI† demonstrates that the optical absorption remains nearly the same after 800 times bending.

Furthermore, we characterize the light-heating property of the PMF to evaluate its potential in photo-thermal applications. As shown in Fig. 5(a), we use a broadband laser source with different output powers to illuminate the PMF and record the temperature in situ and in real-time. The incident laser spot has a diameter of 4 mm and the output power density ranges from 4.7 mW mm−2 to 30.4 mW mm−2. It can be clearly seen that all the generated heats are highly confined around the incident laser spot area. This occurs because the aramid nanofiber is of low heat conductivity (0.048 W m−1 K−1). As a result, the generated thermal energy cannot be easily delivered to the adjacent area so that the local temperature of PMF can be sharply risen. For each heating–cooling cycle, the source is respectively switched on and off for 1 min [Fig. 5(b)]. The temperature responses of PMF are both very fast in the heating and cooling process. For example, when PMF is illuminated with a laser output power of 30.4 mW mm−2, it only takes about 4.8 s to heat from room temperature (20.5 °C) to the steady temperature (147.2 °C). Once the light source is off, the cooling process of PMF returning to room temperature also takes similar time. We collect the steady temperatures of the PMF exposed by the laser source with different output powers and plot them in Fig. 5(c). It shows a good linear correlation: Ts (°C) = 3.69 × P (mW mm−2) + 31.85, where Ts and P represent the steady temperature and the output power of the source, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.9954. The linear correlation implies that it is easy to control the temperature by adjusting the source power, and vice versa, which potentially can be used for illumination power characterization. Benefitting from the excellent thermal stability of gold (melting point: 1064 °C) and aramid (decomposition temperature >500 °C), the PMF can maintain its physical properties and functionalities at such high temperature.

Conclusion
We demonstrate an efficient broadband absorber using the self-supporting nano-composite metamaterial film, which is ultra-flexible generating from its sufficient and durable mechanical strength. In contrast to the conventional complicated top-down approaches used for fabrication of the metamaterial absorbers, the fabrication of the PMF is based on the facile and simple solution process, which is low-cost and easy to scale up. The content and diameter of the doped Au NPs are optimized for exceptional broadband and omnidirectional optical absorption (5.7 wt% and 58 nm Au NPs for a 50 μm-thick film). The anti-reflection effect, LSPR of Au NPs, and non-resonant decay of light contribute to excellent optical absorption performances and fast photo-thermal energy conversion. We envision that the PMF is promising for extensive applications in wearable and non-planar photo-thermal devices.
Methods
Chemicals
Tetrachloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 99.9%), and phosphoric acid (PA, 85 wt% in water) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Bulk Kevlar 69 was purchased from The Thread Exchange.
Preparation of ANF films
1.0 g of bulk Kevlar 69 was dissolved in 350 mL DMSO with 1.0 g KOH to obtain an ANF solution, which was then magnetically stirred for one week at room temperature until a dark red, viscous solution formed. Then 1.5 mL PA and 3.0 mL ultrapure water were added into the prepared ANF solution and vigorously stirred for 24 hours.
Fabrication of the Au-ANF PMF
15 mL of the prepared PA treated Au-ANF solution was added into boiling water (150 mL) and magnetically stirred till the mix solution boils again. The prepared Au NP solution was added into the solution immediately and vigorously stirred to form a homogeneous solution. The boiling homogeneous solution was poured onto the filter paper in a filtration flask and the vacuum suction filter was opened at the same time. After all the liquid was filtered through the paper, the filter paper that contained the solid product was removed and dried in a 338 K oven for 24 hours. Then a perfect absorber was easily prepared by separating it from the filter paper. The other absorbers with various Au contents were prepared by the same method.
Characterization studies
The morphologies and cross-sectional views of the Au-ANF films were recorded using a Helios NanoLab dual-beam system. EDS images and section analyses of the Au-ANF films were performed using a Quanta 200 environment scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The absorbance spectra of all samples were recorded using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer (PV20/30 from CRAIC Technologies). Thermographic images and temperature analyses were performed using an FLIR infrared thermal imaging camera.
