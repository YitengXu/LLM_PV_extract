    , Accepted 8th February 2023First published on 15th February 2023AbstractThe electrocatalytic reduction (ECR) of furfural (FF) for the synthesis of 2-methylfuran (MF) with high octane number and calorific value is investigated, using a carbon-paper-supported Ni–Cu bimetallic material as a catalytic electrode. It is found that the Cu in the electrode plays a basic role in the generation of MF from the ECR of FF, while the existence of Ni in a trace amount can remarkably enhance the activity of the Cu electrode. A low pH value is more favorable for the generation of MF than for the formation of furfuryl alcohol (FA). At the optimal pH value of 0.5, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) and the production rate of MF first increase with an increase in current density and then decline after 10 mA cm−2. The existence of Ni2+ in the electrolyte benefits the formation of MF, while the addition of Cu2+ ions is more useful to promotion of the generation of FA. At the optimal concentration of Ni2+ (10−7 M) in the electrolyte, the total FE of the organics (88%), the FE of MF (82%) and the production rate of MF (77 μmol cm−2 h−1) reach their highest levels. Kinetic analysis shows that the route by which MF is directly generated from FF is preferable to a consecutive route with an intermediate of FA.
Introduction
2-Methylfuran (MF) from the hydrodeoxygenation of furfural (FF), as an important biomass-based raw material derived from hemicellulose, can widely be used for producing pesticides, perfumes, drugs,1,2 and fuel additives with high octane number (103) and adequate energy density (28.5 MJ L−1).3,4 The hydrodeoxygenation of FF is usually conducted in an H2 atmosphere under conditions of high temperature and high pressure, causing a severe safety risk.
Recently, the method of electrocatalytic reduction (ECR) as a novel hydrogenation technology has aroused a great deal of interest among researchers with its many advantages. For instance, the reaction conditions are mild (usually under atmospheric pressure at room temperature), the electricity used in the system can be obtained from renewable solar or wind power, and no external H2 is needed since H2 can be produced in situ from the electrolysis of water.
The application of the ECR method to the hydrodeoxygenation of FF has been investigated by some researchers.5,6 In this reaction system, the carbonyl groups may react with two H atoms to give alcohols, or react with four H atoms to give alkyls. Besides the two reactions, there are two major side-reactions. The first is the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which consumes H and lowers the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the ECR. The second is the dimerization of two alcohol radicals (˙C–OH) through direct electroreduction. Usually, an electrode with a low hydrogen overpotential (e.g., a platinum-group metal) is favorable for the mechanism of ECR; in contrast, the electroreduction mechanism is preferred on an electrode with high hydrogen overpotential (e.g., Pb, Hg, Cd, or graphite); the two reactions may happen simultaneously with competition on an electrode with an intermediate hydrogen overpotential (e.g., Ni, Co, Fe, Cu, Ag or Au).2
Nilges and Schröder7 reported that the product distribution from the ECR of FF can be remarkably influenced by the type of electrode, in an acidic water/acetonitrile mixture of electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4) with a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2. As Fig. 1 illustrates, Cu was the best electrode for producing MF from the ECR of FF; furfuryl alcohol (FA) was the primary product over an electrode of Pt; generally equal amounts of FA and MF were produced on an Ni electrode; the dimer product from the pinacol coupling reaction was the most prominent product over electrodes of Al, Pb, Fe, and C, while almost no dimers were detected on Pt or Cu. Furoic acid was generated due to the oxidation of FF on the anode electrode in an undivided electrolytic cell.

Beyond the properties of the electrode, product selectivity can also be influenced by the conditions of working potential, current density, the acidity and composition of the electrolyte, and the initial concentration of FF.
May and Biddinger8 generalized that for the ECR of FF over a Cu electrode, an aqueous–organic cosolvent such as acetonitrile in water with a ratio of 20–80% was preferable. It was suggested that the initial concentration of FF should be between 20 and 100 mM to yield more FA or MF, because a high concentration of FF might lead to the formation of humins, while a low concentration of FF favored the generation of H2. A wider range of pH (3–10) was available for producing a high yield of FA, and thus it was suggested that the pH value should be less than 2 to produce more MF and it would be even better if the pH value were 0. A lower potential of less than −800 mV vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) was preferred to avoid significant production of H2.
Chadderdon et al.9 investigated the ECR of FF in an acidic electrolyte on a Cu electrode. The results showed that FA and MF were two of the major products with very little hydrofuroin (HF), while HF was the predominant product when Pd was used as the electrode and almost no MF could be detected. The conversion of FF increased with an increase in reaction time, while the product selectivity was generally stable. A low-pH electrolyte favored the generation of MF and H2, while more FA and HF were produced in an electrolyte with a high pH value. As for the influence of the initial concentration of FF, a low value was strongly beneficial to the formation of H2, while a high value favored the generation of FA, and maximum selectivity for MF could be obtained under a medium initial concentration of FF. The two reactions of hydrogenation (to give FA) and hydrogenolysis (to give MF) proceeded in parallel, in which FA was not a major intermediate for MF formation. Both the ECR and electroreduction mechanisms were operable on Cu, leading to the formation of FA, MF, and the dimer product of HF. Hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions required direct chemical interaction with the electrode surface, whereas the formation HF was relatively insensitive to the nature of the surface.
The types of Cu material and modification of the Cu electrode were also investigated. Biddinger et al.10 found that Cu nanocrystals were more reactive and stable than Cu microcrystals or Cu plates. Zhou et al.5 found that both the selectivity of MF and the efficiency of the current could be improved when a small amount of Pd was mixed with Cu. In Dixit et al.'s work,11 a porous bimetallic Ni–Cu catalyst over Ni-foam with a high surface area was tested as an electrode for the ECR of FF in an alkaline electrolyte, while the products of FA and HF instead of MF were highly efficiently obtained.
In general, the FE and the production rate of MF are still at low levels and the mechanism of the reaction is far from clear. In this work, the synthesis of MF from the ECR of FF was investigated with an Ni–Cu bimetallic catalyst. Based on the prepared Ni–Cu catalyst, the influence of the pH value of the electrolyte and the current density were studied to maximize the production of MF. In particular, as an innovative idea, the addition of Ni2+ to the electrolyte was also studied, to further promote the formation of MF. The ECR routes from FF to MF are discussed based on kinetic regulation.
Experimental
Preparation of catalyst
The Ni–Cu bimetallic catalyst was prepared by an electrodeposition (ED) method over a substrate of carbon paper (CP). The CP was first degreased by ultrasonic waves in ethanol for 20 min, followed by rinsing with deionized water 3 times and drying in air for at least 6 hours. The electrodeposition of Ni and Cu was conducted in a three-electrode undivided electrolytic cell (100 mL). A piece of CP with a specific immersed area (1 × 1.5 cm2) was used as the cathode, a standard Ag/AgCl electrode was used for reference, and a sacrificial Cu electrode was used as the counter electrode. The cathode potentials against the reference were recorded using an avometer (typical value of −0.15 V, averaged in the range of −0.13 V to −0.18 V vs. RHE), which was controlled by adjusting the stirring speed, with a constant current density of 13.3 mA cm−2, reaction time of 600 s, and total charge of 12 C. The recorded potential was converted to the value against the RHE through the following equation (at 25 °C): E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.0592 pH + 0.1989 V(1)In each run of the ED process, a mixed solution of 0.5 M NiSO4, 0.04 M CuSO4 and 0.5 M H3BO3 was used as the electrolyte (H3BO3 played the role of a buffer to keep the pH stable at 4.8). The solution was stirred at room temperature with a magnetic stirrer, and the current was supplied by a direct-current power (LPD305C, Lodestar) during the reaction. The conditions were applied in all ED processes if not otherwise specified. The obtained Ni–Cu bimetallic catalyst was named NiCu@CP, and it was used as the working electrode (WE) for the ECR reaction of FF. It should be mentioned that the concentration of Ni2+ was set very much higher than that of Cu2+ in the ED electrolyte, because of the following considerations. The standard electrode potential (SEP) of Cu2+/Cu (0.342 V) is remarkably higher than that of Ni2+/Ni (−0.257 V), indicating that the Cu2+ ions in the electrolyte are much easier to reduce than the Ni2+ ions. For a system with same concentrations of Cu2+ and Ni2+, the loading amount of Cu on the electrode will be overwhelmingly higher than that of Ni, whether the working potential is higher or lower. Therefore, to increase the deposition amount of Ni on the electrode, the actual electrode potential of Ni2+/Ni must be increased. According to the Nernst equation (eqn (2)), the actual electrode potential of Ni2+/Ni increases with an increase in Ni2+ concentration in the electrolyte, based on a constant SEP of Ni2+/Ni. So, herein, the Ni2+ concentration is designed to be much higher than Cu2+ in this system. (2)where φ(Ni2+/Ni) and φ0(Ni2+/Ni), respectively, indicate the actual and standard electrode potentials, V; R is the molar gas constant, 8.314 J mol−1 K−1; T indicates the temperature, K; n is the electron transfer number; F is the Faraday constant, 96485 C mol−1; and [Ni2+] is the concentration of Ni2+, mol L−1.
ECR reaction
The preparation of MF from the ECR of FF was conducted in an H-type cell, which was composed of an anode chamber and a cathode chamber (50 mL for each), separated by a proton exchange membrane. The previously prepared NiCu@CP electrode, Pt wire, and a standard Ag/AgCl electrode, were used as the cathode, anode, and reference electrode, respectively. Before the experiment, 40 mL of electrolyte was added into each of the chambers. The electrolyte was composed of FF (40 mM), ethanol (20% volume fraction), water (80% volume fraction), Na2SO4 (0.2 M), and H2SO4 (0.5 M) with an initial pH value of 0.5. Ethanol was added to improve the solubility of organic compounds in the electrolyte. Optionally, varied concentrations of Ni(NO3)3 or Cu(NO3)3 were added to the electrolyte. In each run of the reaction, the experiment was conducted in constant-current mode (10 mA cm−2), under normal pressure at 25 °C for 2 hours. If not otherwise specified, the conditions were applied in all the following ECR experiments.
After the reaction, a fraction of the liquid was mixed with the solvent ethyl acetate (EA), to extract the organics from the water phase. The detailed extraction process was as follows: 0.4 mL of electrolyte sample was mixed with 0.6 mL of EA in a test tube, followed by agitation using a vortex shaker for 1 min; thereafter, 0.4 mL of organic phase was separated and mixed with 0.4 mL of saturated NaCl solution to remove the water-soluble residue from the organic phase, followed by agitation with the vortex shaker for 1 min. A fraction (0.2 mL) of the organic phase was removed and mixed with 0.2 mL of DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) solution, which contained 0.023 M cyclohexanol used as the internal standard substance (ISS). The final EA–DMF solution was then analyzed by GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) for quantification of the products. Repeated results showed that the relative deviations of the Faradaic efficiency (FE), and the production rate (rp) of MF were no higher than 8%, indicating the qualified reliability of the experimental system.
Product analysis
A GC/MS (QP-2020, SHIMADZU) instrument equipped with a DB-FFAP column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and an EI ion source (70 eV) was used for analysis of the EA–DMF solution. The temperature of the GC oven started at 40 °C, was held for 5 min, and was then increased to 100 °C by 5 °C min−1, held for 3 min, and finally increased to 240 °C by 5 °C min−1 and held for 1 min. The temperature of the injection port, the temperature of the transfer line between GC and MS, and the temperature of the ion source were set at 240 °C, 240 °C, and 200 °C, respectively. Full scan and SIM (single ion monitoring) modes of MS were both used for identification of products (searching in NIST-2014).
Characterization of the catalysts
The amounts of Ni and Cu deposited on the CP support were quantified using the method of ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer, Thermo Scientific, Icap 6300). Before analysis, the electrode was immersed in an acid solution (2 M HNO3) at 50 °C for 1 hour, to transfer the metals from the surface of the electrode to the aqueous solution. The solution was then diluted with deionized water, and the sample was used for analysis by ICP-OES. To meet the optimal concentration condition for ICP analysis, the concentration of the metal ions in the HNO3 solution was adjusted with different amounts of water. Taking the electrode prepared at 0 V (vs. RHE), for instance, a solution with a low content of Ni2+ was diluted with less water and the Ni2+ concentration was quantified as 0.41 ppm. Then, the solution was further diluted with more water to 10 times the volume to reduce the Cu2+ concentration, and the Cu2+ concentration was determined as 47.63 ppm, which was equivalent to 476.3 ppm (10 × 47.63 ppm) on the volume basis of the first solution. Therefore, the Ni/Cu ratio was calculated as 0.41/(10 × 47.63) = 0.00086, which approximated to 0.0009. The concentrations of Cu2+ and Ni2+ for all electrodes on the same-solution-volume basis are shown in Table 1.

The morphology and the elemental distribution of the CP-supported Ni–Cu bimetallic catalyst were characterized by the methods of SEM (scanning electron microscope, Zeiss Gemini 300 SEM), EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Oxford Ultim MAX EDXS) and EPMA (electron probe micro-analysis, JXA-8230). The method of XRD (X-ray diffraction, SmartLab (9)) analysis were also conducted to identify the main phases of the metals of the electrode.

Results and discussion
Influence of electrode property
The Ni–Cu bimetallic electrode was prepared by the ED method. In the ED process, the variation in working potential was controlled in the range from 0 to −0.55 V (vs. RHE) by adjusting the stirring rate. Because the ED process is carried out in a constant-current mode and the agitation can influence the conductivity of the electrolyte, the working potential is adjusted by stirring rate.
With the prepared NiCu@CP electrodes, the performances of the electrodes were tested on the ECR of FF. The ED and ECR experiments were conducted under the standard conditions described in the experimental section. The mass ratio of Ni to Cu deposited on the bimetallic electrode (quantified by ICP-OES), as well as the FE of the products, varying with the ED potential are shown in Table 1.
The ratio of Ni/Cu deposited on the electrode increases with the decrease in ED potential, which could be explained from the comparison between the working potential and the SEP of Ni2+/Ni0 and Cu2+/Cu0. Because the SEP of Ni2+/Ni0 (−0.257 V) is lower than that of Cu2+/Cu0 (0.342 V), Ni2+ is harder to reduce than Cu2+. So, a lower working potential (a higher absolute value of negative potential) favors the deposition of Ni over the CP support, while a higher working potential (a lower absolute value of negative potential) is more advantageous for the formation of Cu.
Seen from the variation in FE, the product selectivity changes with the variation in Ni/Cu ratio in stages: (1) electrode with pure metal; (2) bimetallic electrode with a trace amount of Ni; (3) bimetallic electrode with a high Ni content. For the electrode with pure metal, Ni shows a higher MF selectivity than Cu, and Cu is more favorable for the generation of FA. For the bimetallic electrode with trace Ni, when the Ni/Cu ratio increases from 0.0009 to 0.007, the MF/FA ratio increases from 0.36 to 2.31, which indicates that a higher Ni content in the trace level is beneficial to the formation of MF. In contrast, for the bimetallic electrode with a high content of Ni, the MF/FA ratio decreases from 2.31 to 0.85 when the Ni/Cu ratio increases from 0.007 to 0.4, which means that a high Ni content in a high Ni/Cu ratio favors the generation of FA.
From the viewpoint of working potential, for a bimetallic catalytic system, the FE of MF first rises before −0.15 V and then declines with a decrease in ED potential in the range from 0 V to −0.55 V. This means that there exists an optimal potential in the ED process, as an extremely high or low content of Ni worsens the catalytic performance. Cu plays a basic role in the bimetallic catalyst for the generation of MF from the ECR of FF, while the presence of Ni in a trace amount can remarkably enhance the activity of Cu.
In general, for the electrode with pure Cu, the FE of FA and the FE of MF are both higher than those with pure Ni, indicating that more H2 is more generated under the effect of Ni. For organic products, pure Cu is more favourable for the generation of FA (MF/FA ratio of 1.18) while pure Ni is more beneficial to the formation of MF (MF/FA ratio of 1.71). When the two metals are combined, if the proportion of Ni is very low, the FE of FA is quite similar to the value under the catalysis of pure Cu, but the FE of MF is much lower; in contrast, if the proportion of Ni is too high, the FE of MF is very close to the value with pure Ni, but the FE of FA is much higher. The promoted generation of FA with a higher content of Ni may be attributed to the higher reductivity of Ni than that of Cu, which facilitates the hydrogenation of the CO bond with a co-activation role for Cu. Herein, the optimal mass ratio of Ni/Cu is determined as 0.007, with highest MF-to-FA ratio of 2.31, which is obtained at the working potential of −0.15 V. So, in the following work, all ED experiments were conducted at the working potential of −0.15 V.
The electrodes which were prepared at ED potentials of −0.15 V and −0.55 V, with the corresponding Ni/Cu ratios of 0.007 and 0.4 were characterized by XRD, SEM and EPMA methods. The analytical results are respectively illustrated in Fig. 2. The XRD pattern of the electrode prepared at −0.15 V shows that Cu is remarkably detected in the bimetallic electrode with a tiny signal of Cu2O, while almost no Ni is identified due to its low content. By contrast, for the electrode at −0.55 V, the XRD peaks at around 44° and 51° are much broader, indicating the presence of an Ni–Cu mixture in the electrode, because the top two peaks of Ni (44.5, 51.8) and Cu (43.3, 50.4) are too close to be separated. The third strongest peaks of Cu (74.1) and Ni (76.4) are distinguishable, but the peak strengths are very weak. Herein, two slight peaks appear in the electrode at −0.55 V, which offers additional evidence for the simultaneous existence of Ni and Cu.

It should be mentioned that, although Cu2O is also detected in the electrode, which is generated from oxidization of Cu when exposed to air, the effective catalytic site should still be the Cu site instead of Cu2O. The reason depends on the following two aspects. Firstly, when the electrode is used in the reaction for the ECR of FF in an acid solution, Cu2O in the electrode will decompose to Cu2+ and Cu by a disproportionation reaction, because Cu2O cannot stably exist in an acid environment. Secondly, in the process for the ECR of FF, the Cu2O in the electrode will be reduced to Cu again with the supply of electrons.
Seen from the photographs of SEM/EDS, the fibers of CP are absolutely coated with the two metals, and both Ni and Cu are distributed uniformly over the surface of CP. Comparatively, the distribution of Cu is continuous and very compact, while that of Ni is scattered and loose in accordance with the much higher amount of Cu than that of Ni, as the ICP-OES results illustrated. Whereas the difference in the two electrodes prepared at −0.15 V and −0.55 V can hardly be identified through the analysis of SEM/EDS.
Comparing the photographs of EPMA under different ED potentials, Cu and Ni can both be uniformly distributed over the surface of CP fibers at an ED potential of −0.15 V, while a severe agglomeration of Cu and Ni can be found when the ED potential is −0.55 V.
The uniform distributions of the two metals indicate that Ni atoms are evenly embedded in the matrix of the Cu layer, which is advantageous for improving the synergistic effect of the two metal sites. If the proportion of Ni is too low, only the function of Cu comes into play. If too much Ni is loaded, the aggregation of Ni cannot be avoided, which may cover some of the Cu sites, and thus reduce the basic function of Cu.
Chen et al.2 reviewed the adsorption modes of furanic compounds on different metallic catalysts, based on studies using the DFT (density functional theory) method. It was generalized that the adsorption mechanism was highly dependent on the nature of the metals, and there were three main types of adsorption mode: η1-(O)-aldehyde, η2-(C,O)-aldehyde and η1-(C)-acyl configurations. Specifically, FF tends to adsorb through the carbonyl O atom on the Cu surface in the η1-(O)-aldehyde configuration, because there exists a repulsion effect between the furan ring and the Cu surface. By contrast, the furan ring can readily adsorb on Pt, Pd, and Ni, due to a strong interaction between the metal and the π bond. Therefore, FF tends to adsorb on the Ni surface in the modes of η2-(C,O)-aldehyde and η1-(C)-acyl configurations. Similarly, HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfura) as another typical furanic compound also adsorbs on the Ni surface through the carbonyl C atom in the mode of the η1-(C)-acyl configuration, and the η1-(O)-HMF configuration is the main mode for adsorption of HMF on the Cu surface through the carbonyl O atom.
According to the general adsorption mechanism,2,12,13 the mechanistic role of the electrode with the Ni–Cu bimetals can be speculated (Scheme 1): the C atom of the carbonyl group in the molecule of FF is preferentially adsorbed on the Ni sites; the Cu sites preferentially adsorb the O atom of the carbonyl group; when catalyzed over a surface with evenly distributed Ni and Cu atoms, the C and O atoms of carbonyl group can be simultaneously adsorbed on the two sites, which favors the cleavage of the C–O bond for the formation of MF.

Influence of the acidity of the electrolyte
The influence of electrolyte pH value on the ECR of FF at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 was investigated. The FEs of different products, the rp of MF, the value of CB, and the working potential varied with an increase in pH value, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  The FE, CB, rp of MF (a) and the working potential (b) varied with the increase in pH value. 
It can be seen that the CB values are higher than 70% under all pH conditions, and are even higher than 80% in the pH range from 0.1 to 2. Both the FE of MF and the rp of MF increase with the increase in pH value up to 0.5 and then decline rapidly, and finally become stable above pH 4. By contrast, the working potential as well as the total FE of organics similarly illustrate an ‘N’-form variation trend with an increase in pH value.
The working potential reflects the electrochemical reactions happening on the electrode. In the cathode reaction system for the ECR of FF, there are three main half-cell reactions, for the generation of MF, FA and H2, as illustrated by eqn (6)–(8). The generation of MF consumes 4 electrons and 4 protons, while only 2 electrons and 2 protons are needed for the formation of FA or H2. FF + 4H+ + 4e− → MF(7) FF + 2H+ + 2e− → FA(8) 2H+ + 2e− → H2(9)The variation trends can generally be divided into three stages: the pH ranges of −0.1 to 0.5, 0.5 to 3, and 3 to 7. In the range of 3 to 7, the amount of H+ is relatively lower than in the other two pH ranges. With the increase in H+ (decrease in pH value), the generation of H2 is promoted, and the hydrogen overpotential also increases due to the increase in concentration polarization. This retards the consumption of electrons and thus leads to a decrease in working potential (increase in potential absolute value) within this pH range. In the pH range of 0.5–3 with more H+ than in the range 3–7, the formation of MF and FA is strongly enhanced, while the promoted conversion of FF and H+ increase the consumption of electrons, leading to an increase in working potential (decrease in potential absolute value) with the decrease in pH value in this range. The increase in working potential (decrease in potential absolute value) at low pH also decreases the hydrogen overpotential, which is again advantageous for the generation of H2. So, in the pH range of −0.1 to 0.5, the total FE of organics shows a reducing trend with a decrease in pH value. The total FE of organics is even less than 25% at a pH value of −0.1, indicating that the reaction for H2 formation becomes more prevalent than that for the generation of MF and FA.
Influence of current density
The influence of current density on the ECR of FF with two pH values of 7 and 0.5 is now discussed. The FEs of different products, the rp of MF, the value of CB, and the working potential varied with an increase in current density, as illustrated in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the CB values under all currents are generally stable, and all higher than 70% for the case of pH 7, even reaching 80% at pH 0.5. For both cases with different pH values, the total FE of organics, the FE of MF and the rp of MF first increase with an increase in current density and then decline after 10 mA cm−2. Comparatively, the FE of MF at pH 0.5 is significantly higher than that at pH 7. This means that a low pH value is more favorable for the generation of MF than for FA, in accordance with the results in other work with different Cu electrodes.8 The maximum FE of MF (59%) and the largest rp of MF (55 μmol cm−2 h−1) are obtained at the optimal current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a pH value of 0.5.
 Fig. 4  FE, working potential, CB, rp of MF varied with the increase in current density at pH 7 (a and b) and at pH 0.5 (c and d). 
The influence of current has two aspects. On the one hand, the increase in electrons promotes the conversion FF, while on the other hand the oversupply of electrons strongly enhances the formation of H2, and meanwhile the increase in current increases the hydrogen overpotential. For the case of pH 0.5, in the range from 6 mA cm−2 to 10 mA cm−2, the total FE of organics increases with an increase in current due to the promotional effect of the current. However, at an even higher current in the range from 10 mA cm−2 to 14 mA cm−2, the oversupplied electrons strongly enhance the formation of H2, leading to a decreased FE of organics.
Influence of the Ni2+ in electrolyte
In the literature,14 an Ni sacrificial anode was used to generate Ni2+ flow in an electrolyte to improve the performance of an Ni–Fe cathode in the ECR of FF using a single undivided cell, and a positive effect was verified. However, the MF-to-FA ratio of 0.16 and the total FE of 39% are less satisfactory, which could be attributed to the unknown, uncontrollable and unsuitable concentration of Ni2+ in the electrolyte.
So, herein different concentrations of Ni2+ or Cu2+ were directly added into the electrolyte of the cathode chamber using an H-type reaction cell, to investigate the influence of Ni2+ and Cu2+ dosage on the conversion of FF, using an electrode with an Ni/Cu ratio of 0.007. The results are illustrated in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the FE of MF, the total FE of MF and FA, and the rp of MF all increase with a decrease in Ni2+ concentration in the range of 10−1 M to 10−7 M. If the concentration of Ni2+ is further decreased, the catalytic effect is weakened again, and the limiting case is that without Ni2+ in the electrolyte. At the optimal concentration of 10−7 M, the total FE of organics (88%), the FE of MF (82%) and the production rate of MF (77 μmol cm−2 h−1) reach their highest levels. This indicates that a suitable trace amount of Ni2+ in the electrolyte is significantly advantageous for the selective generation of MF. Similarly, the total FE of organics also increases with a decrease in Cu2+, but to a lower degree. The most remarkable difference between the two cases is that the trace addition of Ni2+ favors the formation of MF, while the existence of Cu2+ in the electrolyte is more conducive to the generation of FA. The CB values decrease slightly with an increase in Ni2+ concentration, but all are higher than 80%, indicating that MF and FA are still two of the major organic products and even less of those undetectable products like humins are generated at a high content of Ni2+, as the monomer product FA with higher reactivity is too low under these conditions.
 Fig. 5  Influences of Ni2+ (a) and Cu2+ (b) concentrations on the FE, CB, and rp. 
It could be speculated that a lot of Ni2+ gather around the cathode with the force of the electrostatic field, which means the surface of the electrode is covered by Ni2+, and the enclosure of the active sites of the catalyst and the blockage of the mass transfer of FF molecules to the surface of the electrode cause a deterioration in the catalytic performance of the electrode. So, if the amount of Ni2+ is higher, the consumption rate of electrons and the fraction of active sites shared for the reaction of FF must decrease, which explains the low conversion of FF at a higher dosage of Ni2+. Similarly, the restrictive role of Cu2+ at high concentration may also be related to the gathering of Cu2+ around the cathode with resistance to the mass transfer of FF to contact the surface of the electrode.
For the case with a trace amount of Ni2+ or Cu2+ in the electrolyte, the blockage hindering the mass transfer of FF to the surface of the electrode can be ignored. So, the promoting effect of Ni2+ ions on the formation of MF and the catalytic role of Cu2+ on the generation of FA should mainly lie in a homogeneous catalytic mechanism.
We can speculate about the detailed mechanistic role of the Ni–Cu bimetallic electrode with a trace amount of Ni2+ in the electrolyte, as shown in Scheme 2. In the system with a trace amount of Ni2+ in the electrolyte, the Ni2+ ions may combine with the molecule of FF, forming an Ni2+–FF complex with positive charge. This facilitates the transfer of FF molecules to the electrode, and meanwhile promotes the receipt of electrons and H radicals from the electrode to the C atom of the carbonyl group, which is beneficial to the cleavage of the CO bond, and thus favors the formation of MF. On the Ni–Cu bimetallic electrode, the product selectivity to MF or FA can be further influenced by the methods of adsorption over different metal sites. If the FF molecule is merely adsorbed on a Cu site through an interaction with the carbonyl O atom, the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group will be promoted to give a product of FA. If the FF molecule is simultaneously adsorbed on Ni and Cu sites, the C atom of the carbonyl group preferentially adsorbs on an Ni site and the carbonyl O atom adsorbs on a Cu site; through the synergistic effects of Cu and Ni, the hydrogenation and deoxygenation of FF can both be enhanced to give a preferred product of MF.

Reaction route from FF to MF
There could be two major possible routes for the reaction from FF to MF (Scheme 3): the one-step route, through which MF and FA are both directly generated from the conversion of FF (parallel reaction); and the two-step route, through which MF is produced from the previously generated FA as the intermediate product (consecutive reaction). In fact, this issue has previously been discussed by other researchers,15,16 and the conclusion is that the first reaction route is preferable to the second one, but with different electrodes or electrolytes. In this work, the catalyst is an Ni–Cu bimetallic material and a trace amount of Ni2+ is added to the electrolyte, which has never been reported before, so it is interesting to see which route is preferable in this system.
 Scheme 3  ECR of FF reactions to generate FA, MF, in acidic electrolytes. 
Kinetic analysis was conducted to make a judgement about the possibilities of the two reaction routes. The concentrations of FF, FA and MF varied as the proceeding of the reaction was recorded, under the conditions of pH 0.5, Ni2+ concentration of 10−7 M, and current density of 10 mA cm−2. If the variation in FA illustrates an increasing and then decreasing trend with the progress of the reaction, this indicates that FA is generated as an intermediate product in the early stage and is converted to other products later. If the concentrations of FA and MF simultaneously increase with the increase in reaction time, this hints that FA and MF are generated in a parallel way. The results are illustrated in Fig. 6 (CB value of 82% at a time of 120 min). It can be seen that the concentration of FF decreases, while both FA and MF increase with the reaction proceeding monotonously. In particular, there is no reduction period in the trend of FA. Therefore, the one-step route in which MF is directly generated from FF is more likely than the two-step consecutive route with the intermediate of FA, which is in accordance with the deductions in other work,5 although the electrodes and the electrolyte compositions are different.
 Fig. 6  Concentrations of FF, FA and MF in electrolyte varied with the progress of the reaction. 
Based on the time-dependent data, a kinetic model is further built by the model fitting method. It is found that the data can well be fitted with a zero-order reaction model, which can be expressed by eqn (10) and (11): rMF = 4.8 × 10−5 mol L−1 min−1(10) rFA = 6.2 × 10−6 mol L−1 min−1(11)To further verify the reaction route, an experiment using FA as reactant is conducted under the same conditions as that for conversion of FF. The product is analyzed by GC/MS. The results show that no MF is generated in the system; instead, remarkably, only one dehydration product of difurfuryl ether is found after the reaction. This confirms that MF cannot be generated from FA under the present conditions.
Conclusion
The electrocatalytic reduction (ECR) of furfural (FF) for the synthesis of 2-methylfuran (MF) was investigated with a catalytic electrode of carbon-paper-supported Ni–Cu bimetallic material. The influence of electrolyte pH value, current density, and the roles of Ni2+ and Cu2+ in the electrolyte were investigated. Some of the main conclusions are listed below:
(1) An electrode coated with pure Cu performs better than one with pure Ni for the preparation of MF, while a trace amount of Ni mixed with Cu on the electrode favors the formation of MF to a remarkable degree.
(2) A low pH value is more favorable for the generation of MF than the formation of FA. The FE and the production rate of MF first increase and then decline with an increase in pH value or current density. The maximum FE of MF (59%) and the largest production rate of MF (58 μmol cm−2 h−1) are obtained at a current of 10 mA cm−2 with pH value of 0.5.
(3) The addition of Ni2+ in the electrolyte favors the formation of MF, while the existence of Cu2+ is more conducive to the generation of FA. A suitable trace amount of Ni2+ in the electrolyte is significantly advantageous for the selective generation of MF. At the optimal Ni2+ concentration of 10−7 M, the total FE of organics (88%), the FE of MF (82%) and the production rate of MF (77 μmol cm−2 h−1) reach their highest levels. The formation of an Ni2+–FF complex in the electrolyte and the simultaneous adsorption of FF on both Ni and Cu sites of the electrode through interactions with the C and O atoms of carbonyl group are speculated to be important factors for the formation of MF.
(4) Kinetic analysis shows that both FA and MF increase when the reaction proceeds monotonously, and almost no MF is generated when FA is used as the reactant, which indicates that MF is generated directly from FF rather than through a two-step consecutive reaction with an intermediate of FA.
