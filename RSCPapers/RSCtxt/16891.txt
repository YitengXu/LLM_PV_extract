    , Accepted 8th May 2023First published on 9th May 2023AbstractSolid polyamines were employed as promising adsorbents to reversibly capture CO2 from humidity flue gas and release it at a lower regeneration temperature (348 K) with limited volatility and degradation of amine. Furthermore, it is extremely important to decrease the process costs and energy consumption by exploring an alternative CO2 capture process and exploring the corresponding parameters for further scale-up and industrial application. Therefore, a temperature vacuum swing adsorption process was optimized for post-combustion CO2 capture from wet flue gas by utilizing solid polyamine in a three-column fixed-bed and a rotary bed system; the process was then evaluated through mathematical modeling. CO2 recovery, energy consumption, and CO2 capture cost performance of the rotary bed resulted in significant improvements over those of the fixed-bed system. The optimized rotary bed process can save ∼21.76% on the total CO2 capture cost as compared to the fixed-bed system, which is mainly attributed to improved CO2 recovery and reduced adsorbents cost. The optimum performance indices for capturing 12% of the CO2 from the humidity flue gas using a rotary bed in terms of energy consumption, CO2 recovery, and CO2 purity were 1.11 GJ per ton CO2, 96.4%, and 99.6% respectively. These simulation results indicate that the rotary bed with temperature vacuum swing adsorption process could be a cost and energy-efficient post-combustion CO2 capture technology.
1. Introduction
Global CO2 emissions from point sources, such as cement, steel, and power plants, have significantly contributed to global warming.1 The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has risen from pre-industrial levels to over 410 ppm.2 To stabilize the atmospheric CO2 concentration at 450 ppm and limit global warming to 1.5 °C, the large-scale development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies is imperative.3 Among the various CO2 capture technologies, amine-based chemical absorption is currently the most prominent for post-combustion capture, particularly from power generation plants.4 However, it is important to note that several alternative technologies are under development. Pre-combustion carbon capture, for instance, typically employs physical absorption methods, such as the use of methanol or ionic liquids as solvents, which tend to be more effective than chemical absorption at high CO2 partial pressures.5,6 Additionally, other CO2 capture technologies include solid adsorption7 and membrane separation.8
Being the most mature technology, aqueous amine solutions have been applied in the natural gas industry to separate CO2 for decades.4 However, some pitfalls, such as high energy consumption, amine degradation, and equipment corrosion, limit its utilization in power plants for post-combustion CO2 capture.9 Solid adsorbents that feature better kinetics and stability, along with high CO2 loading and operating efficiency, can overcome these drawbacks.10 Numerous materials have been developed for this purpose, including porous carbon materials,11 transition-metal carbides,12 amine-functionalized materials,13 zeolites,14 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),15 and covalent organic frameworks (COFs).16
Recently, a polyamine-based solid sorbent was developed for capturing CO2 by low-temperature steam-aided vacuum swing adsorption in a three-column fixed-bed system, which can be an efficient method to reduce energy consumption in CO2 capture.17 Inspired by a reversibly caught cell using temperature-responsive poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAm)-based hydrogels, amine-containing nanogel particles (GPs) were synthesized and used to capture (at 303 K) and release CO2 at a low temperature (348 K). GPs supported on carbon paper by impregnation and vacuum filtering can be applied to further enhance CO2 uptake and reaction rate.18 A temperature vacuum swing adsorption process (TVSA) applied in a rotary bed for post-combustion CO2 capture using honeycomb carbon fiber supported GPs was proposed and optimized, which results in less energy consumption.19 It is critical to select a suitable process configuration for a specific adsorbent to capture CO2.20 Compared with temperature swing adsorption (TSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA), the combination of TVSA with activated carbon presented enhanced CO2 productivity and recovery.21 It has been used to improve CO2 purity and recovery for CO2 capture using zeolite 13X22 and carbon fiber composites.23 In a fixed-bed process, the K2CO3/Al2O3 TVSA process was numerically and experimentally studied for CO2 capture using wet flue gas, where it showed high CO2 recovery.24 Multibed heat-integrated TVSA process has been employed to produce 95% of the CO2.25 Polyethylene-imine-based sorbents for post-combustion CO2 capture were screened via a TVSA reactor cluster.26 However, most studied sorbents are difficult to scale up for industrial applications because of the complicated production process and high costs. For its industrial application, the total cost of sorbents and corresponding processes is crucial.27
Cost analysis of the 30 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA) process for CO2 capture was performed from a macro-scale technic-economic perspective within the EU CASTOR project to develop an original post-combustion demixing process (DMX™).28 A rigorous rate-based model and a comprehensive economic model were developed in Aspen Plus to evaluate the technical and economic performance of the MEA-based CO2 capture process. By improving capture processes, some avoidable costs can be reduced.29 CO2 cost savings from the MEA aqueous solutions are ∼19% of the costs of applying ultrasound for CO2 stripping.30 To compare with the conventional MEA process, a modified 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bpy][BF4])-MEA process shows a 13.5% reduction in the CO2 capture costs.31 The absorber and stripper may represent more than 70% of the total CO2 capture costs in MEA-based post-combustion CO2 capture processes.32 As opposed to the use of aqueous amine-based packed columns, a rotary packed bed (RPB) is an attractive option to limit the column size.33 However, only a few studies have focused on the cost estimates for adsorption-based technologies, especially for a rotary bed with polyamine-derived solid adsorbents. A comprehensive investigation of the relationship between process parameters and corresponding economic performance is required to develop an energy and cost-efficient process for CO2 capture.
In the present work, a polyamine-based solid adsorbent was developed and applied in a three-column fixed-bed and a rotary bed to capture CO2 from wet flue gas. The corresponding mathematical models were established according to a modified Langmuir model. Two different types of TVSA processes were optimized and compared via the performance indicators of energy consumption, CO2 recovery, and CO2 purity. Subsequently, CO2 capture cost was used to evaluate the economic feasibility of the two kinds of CO2 capture systems. An improved understanding of the relationship between some factors (e.g., type and size of the reactor, CO2 concentration) and system economics is a prerequisite to guiding CO2 capture process design.
2. Model description
2.1 Materials
The polyamine was synthesized by copolymerizing N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] methacrylamide (DMAPM), N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS) and N-tert-butyl acrylamide (TBAM) at 343 K. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPD) were used as the surfactant and the initiator, respectively.34 The details can be found in previous literature.19 The polyamine solution thus obtained was further dried and then pelletized by using a moderate additive pellet binder. All the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Beijing BeiWen Gas Company supplied CO2 and N2 gases in over 99.99 vol%.
2.2 Two kinds of TVSA processes
A rotary reactor and a three-column fixed-bed were employed to support solid polyamine for post-combustion CO2 capture from wet flue gas. As shown in Fig. 1, the TVSA cycle for the rotary reactor consisted of one column with three sections, adsorption, desorption, and purge. This corresponded to the three columns of the three-column fixed-bed reactor. The flue gas used in this study was a simulated flue gas stream comprising saturated water and 12 vol% CO2, which is representative of a typical flue gas stream from a coal-fired power plant. The simulated flue gas was continuously fed into the adsorption section in the rotary reactor (or the adsorption column for the three-column fixed-bed) to separate CO2 at ambient pressure and moderate temperature. Subsequently, CO2 was released and concentrated from the desorption section into the rotary reactor (or desorption column for the three-column fixed-bed) at decreased pressure and elevated temperature. To increase CO2 purity, some of the concentrated CO2 could be pumped into the bottom of the desorption section. Lastly, part of the treated gas was used to purge the column for adsorption.

2.3 Mathematical model formulation
A one-dimensional (1D) modeling framework was developed and employed in this work for efficient simulation and optimization of the two TVSA processes. The core of the modeling framework was generic enough to accommodate both CO2 capture processes.
The following assumptions were considered before the simulation:
• The gas phase was assumed to be an ideal gas.
• Each step was described as an adiabatic process.
• Physical properties and any radial property of the adsorbents remained constant.
• The gas humidity was represented by the saturated water vapor pressure at the gas temperature.
• There was no depletion and degradation of the solid sorbents.
The conservation of the overall mass balance is described by the following equation: (1)Here, ρs (kg m−3) and qi (kg kg−1) represent the bulk density of sorbent in the column and the adsorbed amount of component i, respectively. u (m s−1) and Ci (kg m−3) denote the gas interstitial velocity and mass fraction of species i, respectively.
Uptake and release of CO2 along the column lead to changes in gas velocity. The corresponding model can be given as follows: (2)
Here, ρB (kg m−3) denotes the CO2 gas density. k (m s−1) and a (m2 m−3) are the gas mass-transfer coefficients and the effective contact area of sorbents, respectively. C* is the CO2 mass fraction at equilibrium with the units of kg m−3. Tg and Pv are the bulk gas temperature in K and the total gas pressure expressed in kPa, respectively.
The mass transfer of component i from the gas phase to the solid phase can be predicted by the following equation: (3)The energy balance for the gas phase can be determined using the following equation: (4)Here, CP,a (J kg−1 K−1) is the specific heat of the gas phase. h (W m−1 K−1) is the axial thermal conductivity. Ts denotes the bulk sorbent temperature measured in K. For the solid phase, the energy balance can be estimated by the following equation: (5)where CP,i (J kg−1 K−1) represents the specific heat of species i. Qi (J kg−1) is the adsorption heat of species i. The heat capacity, thermal conductivity, viscosity, and vapor partial pressure of the gas can be calculated from the following equations: CP,i = C1 + C2Tg + C3Tg2(6) Ki = C1 + C2Tg + C3Tg2(7) μi = C1 + C2Tg + C3Tg2 + C4Tg3(8) (9)where Ki (W m−1 K−1) and μi (Pa s) denote the thermal conductivity and the dynamic viscosity of component i.  is the saturated water vapor partial pressure with a unit of Pa. The constants, C1 to C6, in eqn (6)–(9) are shown in Tables S1 and S2.† The properties of the gas mixture were calculated according to the mixing law as follows: (10)where xi is the molar fraction of species i. Ni is the properties of species i.
The gas adsorption equilibrium can be described by the Langmuir model and is given as follows: (11)where Ai and Bi are the Langmuir constants. Pi (kPa) is the gas partial pressure of species i. R (J mol−1 K−1) is the ideal gas constant. Boundary and initial conditions related to heat fluxes and mass transfer for each step are presented in Table S3.†
3. Cost estimation
Several cost estimation methods and correlations for CCS systems, such as the levelized cost of electricity,35 the CO2 avoided cost,36 the CO2 reduced cost, and the CO2 captured cost,31 have been reported in the literature. The latter was applied in this work to perform preliminary cost estimation.
The purchased cost of equipment using carbon steel could be calculated using the following expression: log10(C0P) = k1 + k2log10(A) + k3[log10(A)]2(12)where C0P is the cost of purchasing equipment. A is the size of the equipment. The constants k1, k2, and k3 can be estimated for different equipment by the method of Turton et al.37eqn (12) and can be used for a specific size range. The cost of equipment outside the size scale can be determined by the following six-tenths rule: (13)Here, C0 is the cost of purchasing equipment. The subscripts a and b are the required size and base size, respectively. Exponent n varies from 0.3 to 0.84; 0.6 was used for all equipment in this study.38 The following equation was used to adjust the cost of the equipment purchased from 1996 to 2016 because of varying inflation. (14)where C0 and I refer to the purchased cost of equipment and the cost index, respectively. The subscripts 1 and 2 denote the base time when the cost is known and the time when the cost is desired, respectively. The bare module cost for each piece of equipment can be provided by the following expression: CBM = C0pFBM(15)Here, CBM is the bare module equipment cost which is the sum of the direct and indirect costs for each unit. FBM is the bare module cost factor and is given by: FBM = B1 + B2FPFM(16)where the values of B1, B2, pressure factor Fp, and material factor FM are supplied by Turton et al.37 The annual capital cost (ACC) can be estimated by the following equation:39 (17)Here, r and m are the interest rate and the lifetime of each piece of equipment, respectively.
4. Results and discussion
4.1 Model validation
Breakthrough curves and CO2 adsorption equilibrium data were used to verify a model of post-combustion CO2 capture using honeycomb carbon fiber-supported GPs in a rotary bed.19 In this study, experimental data of adsorption and desorption were utilized to verify the improved mathematic model. Simulated flue gas containing 12 vol% CO2, saturated water, and N2 as a balance was continuously fed into a stainless-steel reactor.34 The downstream CO2 concentration was recorded by an infrared CO2 analyzer (0–100%, China Huayun Company) to obtain breakthrough curves. The pure N2 at temperatures ranging from 338 to 358 K was subsequently employed to strip CO2.
The core of the modeling framework was employed and developed to simulate and optimize two CO2 capture processes. A statistical function based on average relative error (ARE), which minimizes the fractional error distribution, was used to determine the error between the simulated and experimental data as the following expression:40 (18)where qexp is the experimental CO2 capacity at a given time. qmod denotes the predicted CO2 capacity at a given time. n is the total number of tests. In Fig. 2, the simulation results agreed well with that of the adsorption and desorption experiments with an average ARE of 9.98%.

4.3 Optimization of column size
The division ratio and rotary speed were first optimized for a rotary bed with TVSA processes based on the previous method.19 The height and diameter of the rotary bed were further optimized to estimate their influence on CO2 purity, CO2 recovery, and energy consumption. The flow rate of the simulated flue gas is set as a constant according to the previous work.19 The simulated results discussed in this work are all from a steady state. The estimation of the energy consumption is based on the CO2 adsorption heat and water evaporation. As shown in Fig. 3, the height and diameter of the column had only a small influence on CO2 purity. It rapidly increased to more than 99% at heights greater than 0.3 m and diameters of 0.7 m due to the cycling of concentrated CO2 in the desorption column. It can be observed that the CO2 recovery increased with the increasing height and diameter of the column, which was likely induced by an increase in adsorbents. Two sharp peaks in energy consumption can be seen in Fig. 4, indicating that the lowest energy consumption resulted in the optimized height and diameter of the column. The less energy consumption is attributed to the use of short cooling and heating cycles (30–75 °C) according to the character of solid polyamine.

 Fig. 4  Effect of (a) fixed-bed height and (b) diameter on CO2 recovery, CO2 purity, and energy consumption. 

Fig. 4 illustrates the effects of column height and diameter on CO2 purity, CO2 recovery, and energy consumption for the fixed-bed system. When studying the influence of one parameter and using the optimal value for another. The CO2 purity is around 99%, which is the same as in the rotary bed system, suggesting that it is not affected by the different systems and reactors. Nevertheless, a lower CO2 recovery (<90%) can be detected, which leads to a bit higher energy consumption. By considering the water evaporation in this study, we can also optimize the column size of the fixed-bed system by observing the energy consumption curves in Fig. 4. It is worth mentioning that a higher energy consumption was observed in this study than that of the rotary bed systems in previous work.19 Further energy can be saved by a solar-powered system.44
4.4 Effect of feed CO2 concentration
Based on the optimized parameters for two CO2 capture processes, feed CO2 concentrations of 5 to 20% were used to determine its effects on energy consumption, CO2 purity, and CO2 recovery. Similar curves can be observed by comparing Fig. 5a with b. The CO2 purity, as well as its concentration, are almost unchanged for different CO2 capture processes. This phenomenon may also be attributed to the cycling of concentrated CO2 in the desorption step. Note that the rotary bed system exhibited a higher CO2 recovery than the fixed-bed system under all CO2 concentrations studied here. This could be attributed to the continuous operation of the former. As a result, the lower energy consumption of the rotary bed system, as compared with that of the fixed-bed system, can be noticed. However, the difference decreased with an increase in CO2 concentration. As shown in Fig. 5, there was a nonlinear decrease in energy consumption with CO2 concentration, hinting that CO2 concentration plays an important role in reducing CO2 capture costs. Due to the strong driving force of high CO2 concentration, more CO2 is adsorbed. Considering the energy consumption, the rotary bed system for post-combustion CO2 capture would be a better choice. A neural network model can also be used to further evaluate energy consumption performance in the next step.45

4.5 Cost analysis
The column height and diameter are critical to determining the capital cost (CAPEX) of CO2 capture, and thus, must be optimized, especially for large-scale applications. The total CO2 capture cost (TCC) with a unit of $ per ton CO2 can be divided into the annual capital cost (ACC) and the annual operating cost (AOC). ACC can be calculated by summing the direct cost, indirect cost, solvent cost, working capital, and startup cost based on eqn (17). AOC can be obtained in two parts: variable operating cost and fixed operating cost. The detailed calculation procedures are shown in Tables S4–S6.†
The variation in cost distribution with the column height and diameter of the rotary bed can be seen in Fig. 6. Each cost item has a steep downward trend with an increase in diameter from 0.5 to 0.9 m and height from 0.1 to 0.5 m, which was likely due to enhanced CO2 recovery. Subsequently, it climbs slightly due to an increase in each item's expenses and stable CO2 recovery. The fixed operating cost was the dominating contributor to the total CO2 capture cost followed by the fixed capital investment. As an example, with the optimal design column diameter (0.9 m) and height (0.5 m), which are in line with Fig. 3, the fixed operating cost and the fixed capital investment occupied more than 35.3 and 34.5% of the total CO2 capture cost, respectively, owing to an expensive CAPEX.
 Fig. 6  Effect of (a) rotary bed diameter and (b) height on cost distribution. 
As can be seen in Fig. 7, the changed cost distribution curves for the fixed-bed were similar to those of the rotary bed. However, the optimized diameter in Fig. 7a is slightly lower than that in Fig. 6a, which can be attributed to the three-column system used. Even so, in the case of optimized conditions, the CAPEX of the fixed-bed process was ∼20.64% higher than that of the rotary bed system. Meanwhile, as compared with the variable operating costs and fixed operating costs shown in Fig. 6, their increase for the fixed-bed process amounted to 36.14 and 7.68%, respectively.
 Fig. 7  Effect of (a) fixed-bed diameter and (b) height on cost distribution. 
As shown in Fig. 8, increasing CO2 concentrations decreased item cost for the two types of CO2 capture, most likely because captured CO2 amounts increased. For the studied CO2 concentration range in this work, each item cost in the fixed column process was more than that in the rotary bed process. This indicates that the latter could be a cost-saving CO2 capture process. Furthermore, the CAPEX, the fixed operating costs, and the variable operating costs were still the major contributors to the total cost of CO2 capture. In comparison to the rotary bed, the increase in the demand for adsorbents and columns in the three fixed-bed systems increased the variable operating costs, CAPEX, and fixed operating costs.
 Fig. 8  Effect of CO2 concentration on cost distribution for (a) rotary bed and (b) fixed column. 
According to Fig. 9 and 10, the TCC, ACC, and AOC are associated with various column heights and diameters for two kinds of CO2 capture systems. The optimal column height and diameter can be obtained by analyzing the TCC. It is worth noting that the optimized values from cost analysis have a marginal difference from those from energy consumption analysis in section 4.3. This suggests a comprehensive evaluation method that considers both must be developed. The ACC and AOC of the rotary bed system are cut down by ∼21.77 and 21.75%. This results in the reduction of the TCC by 21.76% as compared to the fixed-bed system. Also, this phenomenon can be observed for studied CO2 concentrations (5–20%) in Fig. 11. Under the condition of the same CO2 concentration, the rotary bed system presents a lower TCC value than the MEA-based or ionic liquid-based processes (Table S7†),31 which can be attributed to the utilization of waste heat instead of steam because of low regeneration temperature, and a simple reactor with high CO2 recovery. All the results show that the rotary bed system could be a cost and energy-efficient post-combustion CO2 capture technology.

5. Conclusions
CO2 adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted using the developed solid polyamine sorbent in a fixed column. A typical Langmuir model was then obtained by fitting the experimental data on adsorption equilibrium. Furthermore, a rotary bed and a three-column fixed-bed with a temperature vacuum swing adsorption process were employed to support the solid polyamine for post-combustion CO2 capture from wet flue gas. A corresponding one-dimensional mathematical model was established based on the Langmuir model, and a modeling framework was also developed to study the different CO2 capture processes. Two types of CO2 capture processes were optimized and compared via three main performance indices: CO2 recovery, CO2 purity, and energy consumption. Furthermore, preliminary cost estimation of the two CO2 capture processes was performed using the CO2 capture cost method. Simulation results show that the fixed-bed system has a lower CO2 recovery than that of the rotary bed system and thereby a somewhat higher energy consumption. However, the difference decreases with an increase in CO2 concentration. The increases in CAPEX, the variable operating cost, and the fixed operating cost of the fixed-bed process amounted to ∼20.64, 36.14, and 7.68%, respectively, as compared with those of the rotary bed system. Compared with the fixed-bed system, the ACC and AOC of the rotary bed system cut down costs by ∼21.77 and 21.75% respectively, leading to the reduction of the TCC by 21.76%. In the end, the results show that the rotary bed supported by a solid polyamine with the TVSA process could be a cost and energy-efficient post-combustion CO2 capture technology.
