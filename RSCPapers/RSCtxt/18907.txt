    , Accepted 14th June 2016First published on 14th June 2016AbstractOne- to three-dimensional alignments of semiconductors on the micro- or nanoscale have been achieved to tailor their opto-physicochemical properties and improve their photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time the fabrication of vertically aligned, well-ordered WO3 microdisc arrays via an electrodeposition process on lithographically patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates as well as their geometry-specific photoelectrochemical properties. The as-fabricated WO3 microdisc arrays exhibit enhanced light absorption as well as facilitated charge separation, leading to significantly higher PEC performance than WO3 films. A finite-difference time-domain simulation of a single WO3 microdisc indicates that strong optical resonances occur particularly in the central part of the microdisc, leading to enhanced optical absorption. A time-resolved photoluminescence study further reveals that the average lifetime of charge carriers (τ) in a microdisc array is shorter than that in a film by ∼60%. The reductively deposited Au particles are localized on the side of the microdisc and ITO substrate, which suggests that the photogenerated electrons are transferred to the same location. In addition, the oxidative deposition of FeOOH particles on the top surface and side of a microdisc indicates hole transfer pathways at the same location. This downward transfer of electrons and upward transfer of holes lead to efficient charge separation, and the radial direction appears to be the most preferred shortcut for the carriers inside the bulk of a microdisc.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical water oxidation is an essential reaction for the sustainable production of molecular hydrogen (H2) from water and conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals. Many semiconductors have been investigated for PEC water oxidation; among them, WO3 is a promising n-type oxide possessing unique optical and electrical properties. However, it suffers from low hole mobility and short hole diffusion lengths. Changes in morphology from a conventional film type should affect the transfer pathways and kinetics of photogenerated charge carriers and significantly alter the overall PEC efficiency. With this in mind, we present well-ordered WO3 microdisc arrays prepared via electrodeposition on a patterned substrate as a 3D configuration model. The patterned WO3 microdisc arrays exhibit significantly enhanced absorption induced by optical resonance and improved charge transfer in the radial direction. They also exhibit a faster charge transfer kinetics compared with films. Selective photodeposition of Au and FeOOH at different locations of a microdisc further demonstrates the different transfer pathways of charge carriers. The surface-specific reactivity of WO3 microdisc arrays should be advantageous for spatially separated oxidation and reduction reactions. Furthermore, they can serve as a platform with specific functions, widening their applicability.

1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation is an essential reaction for the sustainable production of molecular hydrogen (H2) from water1,2 and conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals.3,4 Many semiconductors have been investigated for PEC water oxidation;1,5–8 among them, WO3 is a promising n-type oxide possessing unique optical and electrical properties. Monoclinic WO3 possesses a bandgap (Eg) of ∼2.8 eV and is capable of absorbing light of λ ≤ 450 nm and attaining a maximum solar conversion efficiency of ∼6%.9–12 Its durability in acidic solution further widens its applicability in diverse fields including chromic devices,13 batteries,14 and environmental sciences.15,16
Despite such potential, WO3 suffers from low hole mobility (∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1) and short hole diffusion lengths (LP ∼150 nm).10 Considering the low absorption coefficient (α ∼ 104 cm−1),11 the optical penetration depth (1/α) is on the order of several micrometers. A similar level of film thickness is required to guarantee effective light absorption. Unfortunately, the space charge layer where most charge separation occurs is only ∼0.8 μm thick (corresponding to 1/α of λ ∼ 370 nm) with a moderately doped WO3 (ND ∼ 1016 cm−3) biased by a large band-bending of 1 V.12 Considering the trade-off between 1/α and LP, a geometry of ∼300 nm-wide rod arrays is a suitable configuration for high photoefficiency in the absence of potential bias, and the aspect ratio can be slightly decreased to 1–2 μm in diameter with increasing bias given a fixed WO3 thickness.9
Changes in morphology from a conventional film type should affect the transfer pathways and kinetics of photogenerated charge carriers and significantly alter the overall PEC efficiency.17,18 In particular, well-ordered three-dimensional (3D) structures of semiconductors have two more different surface geometries possessing possibly dissimilar optical properties and charge transfer pathways.19–21 For example, given an optical geometry of a rod, where majority carriers travel farther, radial-directional charge transfer can occur, and the recombination of charge carriers is inhibited. Unfortunately, most of the reported 3D WO3 configurations were not uniform with random growth directions, diameters, and lengths, leading to difficulty in gaining insight into the spatial distribution of absorption and charge transfer pathways.17,18,22
To the best of our knowledge, this study reports for the first time the fabrication of well-ordered WO3 microdisc arrays (1.4 μm in diameter and 0.45 μm in height) via an electrodeposition process on lithographically patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. The patterned WO3 microdisc arrays exhibit significantly enhanced absorption induced by optical resonance, particularly in the central part of the microdisc over a broad ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectral range, as revealed by a finite-difference time-domain simulation, and improved charge transfer in the radial direction. A time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) study further reveals that the microdisc arrays exhibit ∼1.6-times-faster charge transfer kinetics compared with the film. Deposition of Au and FeOOH via reactions with photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively, at different locations of a microdisc further demonstrates the different charge transfer pathways within the microdisc.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Fabrication of WO3 microdisc arrays
WO3 microdisc arrays were fabricated via the electrodeposition of WO3 on lithographically patterned ITO glass electrodes (Fig. S1, ESI†).23 Before coating a positive photoresist (PR; AZ GXR 601, Merck), the ITO glass (iTASCO, Eagle XG, thickness = 1 mm, R = 4 in, ITO 250 nm) was cleaned with acetone and methanol and then deionized water. Then, the ITO glass was loaded into a multi spinner operation (PR tracker), and approximately 1 μm-thick PR was spin-coated on the ITO glass. The PR-coated ITO was patterned by UV exposure and photoresist developing processes.
A W plating solution was prepared by oxidizing W metal (2 g, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) to peroxo-tungstate using H2O2 (28%, 10 mL, Duksan) and decomposing the excess H2O2 with Pt black (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich). The plating solution was diluted with deionized water (90 mL), and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 1.35 with HCl solution (35%, Daejung). The electrodeposition was performed in an undivided cell using a potentiostat (Versastat, Princeton Applied Research) with a standard three-electrode configuration. A patterned ITO working electrode (1.125 cm2), Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) reference electrode, and platinum wire counter electrode were used for the experiments. The holes of the patterned ITO were filled by the electrodeposited WO3 at −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the amount of total passed charge varied between 25 mC and 3 C to optimize the deposition of WO3. Then, the PR material was removed by annealing the sample at 500 °C for 1 h (ramping rate: 2 °C min−1). For comparison, WO3 thin films were also electrodeposited on bare (non-patterned) ITO substrates following the same procedure. The amounts of non-patterned and patterned WO3 samples were made the same by changing the passed charges and estimating the geometric volumes of the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images.
2.2. Photoelectrochemical tests and photodeposition of catalysts
A WO3 electrode (working electrode), saturated calomel electrode (SCE, reference electrode), and Pt wire (counter electrode) were immersed in a customized glass cell containing aqueous sodium sulfate solution (0.5 M) at pH 6.5. A 150 W xenon arc lamp (ABET Tech.) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter was used as a light source (100 mW cm−2). Light passed through the electrolyte and reached the WO3 electrode (irradiated area: 1.125 cm2). Linear sweep voltammograms were obtained by sweeping the potential from −0.5 to 1.5 V vs. SCE at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the absence or presence of irradiation. Potentials versus SCE were converted to potentials versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following equation: VRHE = VSCE + 0.241 V + 0.059 V × pH. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was estimated using a CS 130 monochromator (Mmac-200, Spectro) with a 300 W Xe arc lamp using the following equation: IPCE (%) = (1240 × Iph) × 100/(Plight × λ), where Iph, Plight, and λ refer to the photocurrent density at 1 V vs. SCE, photon flux, and wavelength, respectively.4,24 The IPCE values were further converted to absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) values using the following equation: APCE (%) = IPCE (%)/absorptance, where the absorptance (ηe−/h+) is defined as the fraction of electron–hole pairs generated per incident photon flux.25 The photoelectrochemical oxidation of iodide (I−) to triiodide (I3−) was performed by applying a constant potential (1.65 V vs. RHE) to WO3 electrodes in 0.5 M sodium sulfate electrolyte containing 0.02 M iodide. The triiodide production was spectrophotometrically quantified by measuring the absorbance at λ = 352 nm using a UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2450).26
Nanoparticle catalysts (Au27 and FeOOH28) were photodeposited onto WO3 electrodes immersed in the precursor solutions while irradiating AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using the 150 W Xe arc lamp (ABET Tech.). For reductive deposition of Au by photogenerated electrons, WO3 electrodes were immersed in aqueous AuCl3 solution (0.475 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) containing methanol (10 vol%) and irradiated for 10 min. For oxidative deposition of FeOOH through the oxidation of Fe2+ by photogenerated holes, WO3 samples were immersed in aqueous solution of FeCl2 (0.1 M, Sigma-Aldrich) and irradiated for 2 h while being held at near open-circuit potential (i.e., +0.3 V vs. SCE) to facilitate the deposition process. The applied bias was not sufficiently positive to electrochemically oxidize Fe2+; therefore, the oxidation of Fe2+ ions was achieved solely by photogenerated holes of WO3.
2.3. Surface characterization
The top and tilt side views of the samples were analyzed using a field-emission SEM (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800). X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical Empyrean) was used to examine the WO3 crystallite structures. UV-vis spectra were obtained using a Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer, in which the sample electrode was placed at the center of an integrating sphere. ITO glass was used as the reference for these absorption measurements. The atomic percentages of W, O, Au, and Fe in the catalysts (e.g., Au, FeOOH) on WO3 electrodes were determined using SEM coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) (Horiba).
2.4. Time-resolved photoluminescence decay analysis
Photoluminescence spectra were recorded at room temperature using a spectrometer (f = 0.5 m) equipped with an intensified photodiode array detector (Princeton Instrument Co., IRY1024, USA). A He–Cd laser (Kimmon, 1 K, Japan) with λ = 266 nm and power of 50 mW was utilized as an excitation light source. Fluorescence lifetime imaging was performed using an inverted-type scanning confocal microscope (MicroTime-200, Picoquant, Germany) with a 60× water-immersion objective (Korea Basic Science Institute, Daegu Center, South Korea). A single-mode pulsed diode laser (379 nm with a pulse width of ∼200 ps and laser power of ∼30 μW) was used as an excitation source. A dichroic mirror (Z375RDC, AHF), long-wave pass filter (HQ405lp, AHF), 50 μm pinhole, band-pass filter, and avalanche photodiode detector (PDM series, MPD) were used to collect emissions from the WO3 samples. The time-correlated single-photon counting technique was employed to obtain fluorescence decay curves as a function of time with a resolution of 8 ps during image scanning. Exponential fittings for the obtained fluorescence decays were performed using the iterative least-squares deconvolution fitting of the Symphotime software (version 5.3).
2.5. Finite-difference time-domain simulation
The optical absorption of WO3 was simulated by a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solution (Lumerical Solutions, v.8.11.387). A plane wave with broad wavelength ranging from 350 to 550 nm was used at normal incidence. The absorption was estimated by calculating the power absorbed in WO3 over a propagation length of 80 nm from the top surface. We used the boundary condition of a stretched coordinate perfectly matched layer for zero reflection and high numerical stability. Field monitors were used to produce the electric field intensity distribution in WO3. The optical constant of WO3 was obtained from the literature,29 and the mesh size was 4 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Photoelectrochemical behavior of WO3 microdisc arrays

Fig. 1 presents the FE-SEM images of the template (i.e., PR-patterned ITO) and WO3 samples (discs and films). The patterned ITO displays a configuration of 2 μm-wide empty hole arrays with an inter-hole distance of 1 μm (Fig. 1a). The application of a constant potential bias (E = −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl) to the patterned ITO substrates induced the selective growth of WO3 particles within the arrayed holes gradually with time; then, a crystalline WO3 array was obtained by removing the PR materials by annealing at 500 °C (Fig. 1b–g and Fig. S2, ESI†). As the total passed charge (q) increased, the morphology of WO3 changed. With q = 25 mC, WO3 was observed only at the edge parts of the holes (Fig. 1b) and gradually filled the entire holes with q = 1.5 C (Fig. 1c). The as-obtained WO3 arrays were slightly smaller (∼1.4 μm) in diameter than the patterned hole because of the shrinkage and aggregation of the electrodeposited WO3 particles during annealing (Fig. 1d). The height of a WO3 aggregate was ∼0.45 μm, which was also shorter than the depth of a patterned hole (∼1 μm) (Fig. 1e). The patterned WO3 was successfully deposited over the entire electrode with good uniformity and regularity (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). With q > 1.5 C, the WO3 particles grew over the PR hole wall and connected with each other, covering the entire ITO surface (Fig. 1f) and resulting in peeling off from the substrate during annealing (Fig. 1g). Therefore, WO3 microdisc arrays prepared with q = 1.5 C were used in all the experiments, unless otherwise specified. For comparison, a WO3 film was fabricated on a non-patterned ITO electrode (Fig. 1h), where the deposited amount of WO3 was the same as that for the WO3 microdisc arrays prepared with q = 1.5 C. The as-fabricated WO3 film was ∼80 nm thick, which was thinner than the height of the WO3 microdisc because of the larger deposition area of the film.

The as-fabricated WO3 microdisc arrays and films displayed the same monoclinic crystallinity (JCPDS no. 42-1035) despite slightly different relative (002)/(200) phase ratios between the two (Fig. S4, ESI†). In some cases, the phase ratio played an important role in photoconversion processes, leading to diverse photo-activities of WO3. However, such speculation is mostly arbitrary, and contradictory results have often been reported.30–33 In this study, we observed that the ratio varies with samples and concluded that the discussion on the effect of the ratio is insignificant.
The WO3 microdisc arrays exhibited superior photoconversion performance compared with the WO3 film. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) of the samples revealed that the onset potential of the disc arrays was ∼0.1 V more negative and the photocurrent density was ∼2-fold-greater compared with the film in sodium sulfate (0.5 M) under irradiation of AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 2a). The PEC oxidation of iodide to triiodide (reaction 1) at 1.65 V vs. RHE on the WO3 microdisc arrays also occurred at a higher oxidation rate compared with the WO3 film (Fig. 2a, inset). I− + h+ → I˙; I˙ + I− → I2−; I2− + I2− → I3− + I−(1)The IPCE profile indicates that the microdisc arrays have an IPCE value of 30% at λ = 380 nm, which linearly decreased with increasing wavelength (Fig. 2b). The WO3 film exhibits a similar IPCE profile but with 1.5–2.5 times lower values in the wavelength range between 380 and 500 nm. The microdisc arrays further displayed high APCE values (e.g., ∼38% at λ = 420 nm), whereas the APCE value at the same wavelength was ∼15% for the WO3 film. These IPCE and APCE results suggest that the configuration of microdisc arrays is excellent in not only absorbing light but also generating charge carriers.

3.2. Geometry-specific absorption and charge-carrier transfer of a single WO3 microdisc
The geometry effect on the optical properties was examined experimentally and using simulations. Both the film and disc array exhibited similar absorption spectral profiles with a band gap of ∼2.7 eV (Fig. 3a). Despite the same quantity of WO3 on the same electrode area, however, the disc array sample displayed enhanced absorption, which was confirmed by the reduced transmittance of the disc array compared with the film (Fig. S5, ESI†). To gain insight into the change in absorption due to the WO3 geometry, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were performed. The geometry and size of both structures were reproduced for the simulations based on the experimentally determined values (Fig. S6, ESI†). According to the simulation, the WO3 film exhibited a featureless absorption spectrum in the wavelength range of 350 to 550 nm, whereas strong resonant absorption peaks were observed for the WO3 microdisc (Fig. 3a, dashed lines). The absorption peaks of the WO3 microdisc originate from the optical resonances in the disc geometry, yielding enhanced absorption. The calculated electric field intensity distributions at λ = 404.7 nm (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 3a) in a single WO3 microdisc further confirmed the anti-nodes of the standing wave, at which the field intensity becomes maximized within the microdisc and particularly in the central part of the microdisc (Fig. 3b). Such distributions are uniformly observed through the disc trunk (Fig. 3c; see Movie S1 in the ESI†). The WO3 films exhibited weaker electric field distributions throughout the film structure (Fig. S7 in ESI†).

In addition to the enhanced absorption, the WO3 microdisc arrays exhibited a PL emission spectrum (excited at λ = 266 nm) dissimilar to that of the WO3 film (Fig. S8, ESI†). The emission intensity of the microdisc arrays was significantly lower and the emission peak was red-shifted compared with the film. This finding suggests that the charge-carrier recombination and pathway on the disc array are reduced and altered, respectively.34 To examine this phenomenon, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) emission (green emission, λ > 500 nm) decay spectra of samples excited at λ = 375 nm were compared (Fig. 4a). It is of note that the green emission of WO3 is associated with the surface trap, whereas the blue emission (λ < 500 nm) results primarily from the bandgap recombination.35,36 It is apparent that the WO3 microdisc array exhibited a significantly faster PL emission decay compared with that of the WO3 film, indicating the facilitated charge transfer from the bulk to the surface where the redox reactions occur.37,38 The τ of charge carriers on the WO3 microdisc array was estimated to be 0.078 ns (τ1 = 0.044 (83.9%); τ2 = 0.255 ns (16.1%), the numbers in parentheses refer to fractions), whereas that on the film was 0.1283 ns (τ1 = 0.045 (65.2%); τ2 = 0.254 ns (34%); τ3 = 1.819 ns (0.8%)). Other decay spectra of the full and blue emission show the same result as the green emission decay spectra (Fig. S9 and Table S1, ESI†). This facilitated charge transfer should contribute to the reduction of recombination, leading to the improvement of the PEC performance. To shed light on the charge transfer pathways of WO3 microdisc arrays, two-dimensional PL lifetime images were obtained (Fig. 4b–d), and the spatial distribution of the PL intensity and average lifetime on the top surface of a single microdisc were explored (Fig. 4e). Notably, the PL emission in the central part of a disc was relatively weak, whereas the edge parts generated strong emissions. However, the PL lifetimes at the edge parts were shorter compared with that at the central part. Considering the enhanced light absorption in the central region (Fig. 3b), the reduced emission in the same region should be attributed to the inhibited recombination because of the effective transfer of charge carriers to radial directions. This phenomenon should result in the accumulation of charge carriers and further intensify the recombination or surface trapping in the edge region. Nevertheless, the short lifetimes in the edge region caused the charge carriers to be rapidly transferred to the interface and/or underlying substrate (ITO) (Scheme 1). In contrast to the microdisc, the WO3 film did not provide such distinct results (Fig. S10, ESI†); weak PL emission was observed over the entire WO3 film electrode.

3.3. Surface-specific injection of charge carriers on a single WO3 microdisc
The interfacial transfer of charge carriers on a single WO3 microdisc was further examined by photodepositing two well-known co-catalysts (Au and FeOOH) on the WO3 microdisc arrays. Au particles have often been coupled to WO3 to enhance the photocatalysis and gas sensing performance39 and can be photodeposited via a reduction reaction with photogenerated electrons (Au3+ + 3e− → Au0). However, FeOOH is an oxygen evolution catalyst and deposited on WO3via an oxidation reaction with photogenerated holes (Fe2+ → Fe3+ + e−; Fe3+ + 2H2O → FeOOH + 3H+).28 Accordingly, the deposition location of the co-catalysts can be used to deduce the pathway of the photogenerated charge carriers.

Fig. 5a clearly shows that approximately 500 nm-sized Au particles were created and deposited selectively on the side of the WO3 microdiscs, whereas no Au particles were observed on their top surfaces. Individual Au particles were observed to be deposited on the base substrate (ITO) as well; these particles were sometimes interconnected with each other and grew from the side of the WO3 microdiscs. This selective deposition of Au was found even when the photodeposition time increased (∼30 min) (Fig. S11, ESI†). EDX elemental mapping provided further evidence for the side-selective deposition of Au (Fig. 5b–d). For comparison, Au particles were deposited on a WO3 film as well (Fig. S12a and S12b, ESI†). Although the particle size was similar to that on the microdisc arrays, Au particles were randomly distributed on the film surface. As for FeOOH, there were no discrete particles on the WO3 microdisc arrays (Fig. 5e), whereas both the top and side surfaces of the microdiscs were uniformly covered with needle-type FeOOH (Fig. 5f–i).40 This surface-specific deposition of Au and FeOOH on WO3 microdiscs is attributed to the different charge transfer pathways between electrons and holes. As discussed in the FDTD and TRPL analyses, the photogenerated electrons in the central region of a WO3 microdisc are rapidly transferred to the edge regions, followed by injection to an interfacial solution (i.e., redox couple) and the underlying substrate (ITO) via downward interparticle transport (Scheme 1). The enhanced light absorption in the central region further contributes to intensifying this charge transfer. The localized deposition of Au nanoparticles is evidence of such a charge transfer pathway of majority carriers (i.e., photogenerated electrons) that migrate along the direction to the ITO substrate because of the downward band bending of n-type WO3. However, the minority carriers (i.e., holes) move to the solid/solution interface (i.e., the top and side surface regions) of a microdisc under the given irradiation conditions. With the given geometry of a microdisc (∼1.4 μm in diameter and ∼450 nm in height), holes generated on the top surface region are directly injected to the interfacial solution and/or transferred to radial directions. Considering the hole diffusion length (Lp ∼ 150 nm), photogenerated holes within Lp from the solid/solution interface appear to be effectively transferred to the interface. However, the holes generated beyond Lp are recombined with electrons while travelling toward the top surface, whereas a fraction of holes transferred to the radial direction or generated within Lp can be rapidly injected to interfacial acceptors (e.g., Fe2+).

4. Conclusions
We successfully fabricated well-ordered WO3 microdisc arrays via electrodeposition on lithographically patterned ITO substrates and optimized the configuration of the WO3 microdiscs by controlling passed charges during the electrodeposition. The patterned WO3 microdisc arrays exhibited excellent photoelectrochemical performance compared with WO3 films. This performance was attributed primarily to enhanced light absorption and effective charge separation. FDTD simulations proved that strong optical resonances occur within a single WO3 microdisc, which in turn leads to an increase in the overall absorption of the microdisc arrays. TRPL analyses further revealed that the averaged lifetime of charge carriers in the microdisc arrays was shorter than that in the film by 60%. Furthermore, the edge of a single microdisc displayed much more pronounced emission with a shorter lifetime than the center, which strongly indicates the effective charge transfer to radial directions in a microdisc. The surface-specific photodeposition of Au and FeOOH catalysts on WO3 microdisc arrays revealed that the migration pathways of photogenerated electrons and holes are different from those in WO3 films. The localized deposition of Au suggests that the photogenerated electrons are transferred primarily to the side of a microdisc as well as on the ITO substrate. In addition, the selective deposition of FeOOH on the top surface and side of a microdisc indicates the hole transfer pathways at the same location. This dissimilar transfer pathway of the charge carriers (downward transfer of electrons vs. upward transfer of holes) leads to efficient charge separation, and the radial direction appears to be the most preferred shortcut for the carriers inside the bulk of a microdisc. The surface-specific reactivity of WO3 microdisc arrays should be advantageous for spatially separated oxidation and reduction reactions with high efficiency. Furthermore, these arrays can serve as a platform with specific functions, widening their applicability to diverse fields. Finally, the PEC performance of the fabricated WO3 microdisc arrays is rather lower than the state-of-the-art performance of mesoporous WO3, primarily because of the technical limits (e.g., low thermal stability of the ITO substrate and a relatively thin WO3 layer). Such limits, however, can be overcome rather easily by employing thermally stable substrates (e.g., fluorine-doped SnO2), increasing the photoresist thickness, and optimizing the WO3 configuration based on the knowledge presented in this study.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical water oxidation is an essential reaction for the sustainable production of molecular hydrogen (H2) from water and conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals. Many semiconductors have been investigated for PEC water oxidation; among them, WO3 is a promising n-type oxide possessing unique optical and electrical properties. However, it suffers from low hole mobility and short hole diffusion lengths. Changes in morphology from a conventional film type should affect the transfer pathways and kinetics of photogenerated charge carriers and significantly alter the overall PEC efficiency. With this in mind, we present well-ordered WO3 microdisc arrays prepared via electrodeposition on a patterned substrate as a 3D configuration model. The patterned WO3 microdisc arrays exhibit significantly enhanced absorption induced by optical resonance and improved charge transfer in the radial direction. They also exhibit a faster charge transfer kinetics compared with films. Selective photodeposition of Au and FeOOH at different locations of a microdisc further demonstrates the different transfer pathways of charge carriers. The surface-specific reactivity of WO3 microdisc arrays should be advantageous for spatially separated oxidation and reduction reactions. Furthermore, they can serve as a platform with specific functions, widening their applicability.
