The introduction of SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy increases the photocurrent of the QDSSCs mainly due to enhanced light harvesting abilities via improved light absorption and scattering. Under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), cells containing SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy show a marked improvement in their conversion efficiency (1.24%) compared with cells without SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy (0.98%). After one sun illumination for 1 min, after which the light source was turned off, cells containing SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy show an efficiency of 0.07% under dark conditions due to the irradiation by the long persistent light from SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy. The present strategy should provide a possibility to fulfil the operation of solar cells even in the dark.
Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are considered as promising candidates for the development of next generation solar cells because they can be fabricated by simple and low-cost techniques.1–9 Despite the powerful merits of quantum dot (QD) materials, such as a high extinction coefficient, spectra tunability based on particle size and a good stability, the power conversion efficiency of a QDSSC is still low compared to that of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC).10–20 Pursuing high efficiency is always a core task in the development of QDSSCs, and one of the current key issues is to enhance light harvesting abilities in the visible light region.21–25
It is known that conventional semiconductor photoanodes, typically TiO2, which are composed of small nanoparticles with a size of 10–30 nm are transparent to solar light and can not effectively utilize the incident light.26–28 Therefore, an efficient light scattering layer, involving large ZnO, TiO2 or ZrO particles such as aggregates, spherical structures, porous beads and nanoplates, on a TiO2 layer has been suggested as one effective method to localize the incident light within an electrode and enhance light absorption by increasing the optical path length.29–36 Recently, the utilization of light-converting materials has been another attractive strategy to improve light harvesting abilities. These light-converting materials, including up-converting and down-converting materials, could transform lower (higher) energy photons into high (low)-energy visible photons which are easily absorbed by the sensitizer.37–41 Hafez et al.42 reported that the use of Sm3+-doped and Eu3+-doped TiO2 electrodes in DSSCs improved the conversion efficiency due to their down-converting properties. In our previous work, a bifunctional structured layer composed of Y3Al5O12:Ce phosphors on top of a TiO2 layer was used in DSSCs and the cells achieved an improved efficiency due to the light scattering and the light down-converting properties of the phosphors.43
In this work, we further study an efficient bifunctional structured layer composed of SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors that offer both light scattering and light down-converting properties on top of a TiO2 layer for use in QDSSCs. It is known that SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy is a long afterglow phosphor, which not only acts as a down-converting material, but also exhibits the excellent luminescent property of long persistence.44,45 Under one sun illumination, cells containing SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy show a marked improvement in their conversion efficiency (1.24%) compared to cells without SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy (0.98%). Importantly, the SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors still emit light to drive the QDSSCs even if the light source is turned off after illumination.
Experimental
A transparent layer of nanocrystalline TiO2 (P25, Degussa) with a thickness of ca. 10 μm was prepared by screen printing P25 paste onto F-doped SnO2 (FTO) (resistivity: 14 Ω □−1, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) glass. Subsequently, the SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors (Jinan Xingyue LED Technology Co., Ltd.) were deposited on top of a TiO2 layer by screen printing. The as-prepared electrodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.
The electrodes were then sensitized by CdS QDs using a microwave-assisted chemical bath deposition method as reported in our previous work.7,46,47 In brief, the electrodes were immersed into a sealed vessel with a CdS precursor aqueous solution (0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 and 0.05 M CH4N2S, Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co. Ltd.). Then, the vessel was put into an automated focused microwave system (Explorer-48, CEM Co.) and treated at 150 °C with a microwave irradiation power of 100 W for 20 min.
The CdS QDSSCs were sealed in a sandwich structure with a 60 μm spacer (Surlyn) using a thin Pt counter electrode. A water/methanol (3:7 by volume) solution was used as a co-solvent for the polysulfide electrolyte. The electrolyte solution consists of 0.5 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl.48 The active area of the cells is 0.2 cm2.
The surface morphology and composition of the electrodes were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, JEM-2100). UV-vis diffuse reflection and absorption spectra of the electrodes were detected using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3900). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were examined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon fluoromax-4). A J–V measurement was performed using a Keithley model 2440 Source Meter and a Newport solar simulator system (equipped with a 1 kW xenon arc lamp, Oriel) at one sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) with a mask. The incident photon to current conversion (IPCE) efficiency was measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 600 nm using an Oriel 300 W xenon arc lamp and a lock-in amplifier M 70104 (Oriel) under monochromator illumination. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed using an electrochemical workstation (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz, and the applied bias voltage and ac amplitude were set at the open-circuit voltage of the cells and 10 mV between the counter electrode and the working electrode, respectively.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show FESEM images of the P25 and P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy electrodes, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the pure P25 electrode consists of a random agglomeration of TiO2 particles. Compared with pure P25, it is observed that the SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors are deposited on the surface of the TiO2 film (Fig. 1b). The SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphor particles have sizes in the range of 5–10 μm. Fig. 1c displays the FESEM image of the P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode. An apparent difference in the surface morphology is observed compared with the P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy electrode, indicating the successful attachment of the CdS QDs. The composition of the P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode was identified by an EDS measurement, as shown in Fig. 1d, which confirms the existence of TiO2, SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy and CdS in the electrode.

The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of the P25 and P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy electrodes are shown in Fig. 2a. It is observed that the P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy electrode has a higher light reflectance than the bare P25 electrode, which indicates that the additional SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors improve the light scattering capabilities, resulting in an improved light harvesting ability. Fig. 2b displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of the P25, P25/CdS and P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes. Compared with the absorption spectrum for the P25 electrode, there is an obvious absorption peak near 500 nm for the P25/CdS and P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes, which is due to the contribution from CdS QDs.46 It should be noticed that the P25/CdS and P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes have a similar absorbance near 500 nm, indicating that the introduction of the large SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy particles only has a small influence on the amount of CdS deposited on the electrodes.

Fig. 3 shows the PL excitation and emission spectra for SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy. The absorption peak at 335 nm is assigned to the characteristic 4f7 → 4f65d1 transition of the Eu2+ ions. A broad emission spectrum with a peak at 512 nm is observed, which is typical of the 4f65d1 → 4f7 emission of the Eu2+ ions. This luminescence falls in the absorption range of the CdS QDs. Therefore, the result indicates that SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy can be used as an effective light down-converting material to improve light harvesting abilities in QDSSCs.43 Furthermore, Dy3+ ions, as hole traps, play an important role in the long afterglow properties of SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy. When the excitation light source is turned off, some holes captured by the Dy3+ hole traps could be thermally released slowly to valence bands. The released holes travel back to Eu2+, returning to the ground state of Eu2+ which is accompanied by light emission.44,45 Generally, the SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphor is one of the best afterglow materials. The afterglow of this phosphor persists for a very long time after full illumination, and the green emission can be observed by the naked eye for several hours.49–51 Such a long persistent light can be considered to drive the solar cells in the dark, though its intensity still needs to be improved substantially.

The EIS spectra of the cells containing P25/CdS and P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes are shown in Fig. 4.52,53 Two semicircles, including a small one at a high frequency and a large one at a low frequency, are observed in the Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra and the corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. The high frequency semicircle is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface between the electrolyte and counter electrode. The larger semicircle at a low frequency is due to the contribution from the electron transport resistance (Rw) and the interfacial capacitance at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. The fitted Rw of the cells containing the P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode is lower than that of the cells containing the P25/CdS electrode, reflecting the acceleration of the electron transfer process in the photoanode. This result indicates favored electron transport and a reduction of the electron recombination when SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy is introduced.

The J–V curves of the cells containing the P25/CdS and P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrodes are shown in Fig. 5a. The open circuit potential (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and conversion efficiency (η) of all the cells are listed in Table 1. It can be observed that the Jsc and η values have largely increased from 5.87 mA cm−2 and 0.98% for cells containing the P25/CdS electrode to 7.07 mA cm−2 and 1.24% for cells containing the P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode. The improvement in the Jsc and Voc values results from the introduction of SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy into the QDSSCs. The reasons can be summarized as follows: (1) when the SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors are introduced into the photoanode, they can absorb higher energy photons and emit visible light at a longer wavelength, which has been confirmed by the PL spectra. These low energy photons can be easily absorbed by the CdS QDs, leading to an improvement in the conversion efficiency for the QDSSCs;37–43 (2) light scattering by the SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphor particles enhances the light harvesting abilities of the cells, which has been confirmed from the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra; (3) the introduction of SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy favors electron transfer and suppresses electron recombination, which has been confirmed by EIS measurements. The IPCE spectra show that cells containing the P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode exhibit a maximum IPCE value of 43.2% at 440 nm, while for cells containing the P25/CdS electrode, the peak only reaches 36.6%, as shown in Fig. 5b. The improvement is mainly due to the enhanced light harvesting ability within the electrode when SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy is introduced.

As mentioned above, the important property associated with SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy is the emission of long persistent light. Therefore, after one sun illumination for 1 min, the light source was turned off and the photovoltaic performance of the cells containing the P25/SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy/CdS electrode was measured. Table 2 lists the corresponding data. It can be seen that the cells show an efficiency of 0.07% in the dark. Although the value is low, this novel concept is worthy of exploration because it could provide a possibility to fulfil the operation of solar cells in the dark if the long afterglow phosphor technology can be developed well in the future.

Conclusions
Long afterglow SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors were used on top of a transparent TiO2 layer in CdS QDSSCs. Due to enhanced light harvesting abilities mainly via improved absorption and scattering, the as-prepared cells containing SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy achieved a conversion efficiency of 1.24% under one sun illumination, which is an increase of 26.5% compared with cells without SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy (0.98%). After 100 mW cm−2 illumination for 1 min, the light source was turned off. Cells containing SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy still show an efficiency of 0.07% in the dark due to the long afterglow properties of the SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy phosphors.
