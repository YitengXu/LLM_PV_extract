    , Accepted 22nd December 2015First published on 22nd December 2015AbstractThe effective utilization of work-function (WF) tuned solution processable graphene-based derivatives as both hole and electron transport layers in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is demonstrated. The systematic tuning of the functionalized graphene oxide (GO) WF took place by either photochlorination for WF increase, or lithium neutralization for WF decrease. In this way, the WF of the photochlorinated GO layer was perfectly matched with the HOMO level of two different polymer donors, enabling excellent hole transport. Meanwhile the WF of the lithium functionalized GO was perfectly matched with the LUMO level of the fullerene acceptor, enabling excellent electron transport. The utilization of these graphene-based hole and electron transport layers in PTB7:PC71BM active layer devices led to ∼19% enhancement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to that of the reference graphene free device, resulting in the highest reported PCE for graphene-based buffer layer OPVs of 9.14%. The proposed techniques open new paths towards novel material and interface engineering approaches for a wide range of new applications, including flexible electronic devices, OPVs, perovskite solar cells, organic light emitting diodes, and photosensors, as well as traditional electronic devices.
Introduction
Over the past decade, OPV devices based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends have attracted great interest due to their potential for low fabrication cost but, more importantly their versatility for large-scale fabrication on flexible substrates.1–4 Despite the numerous studies on OPVs, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to those of silicon and other inorganic material based photovoltaic technologies remains relatively low (∼10%).5 Aiming to improve the competitiveness of OPVs, extensive research effort has been devoted to the interface engineering of devices and especially to the introduction of charge extracting interlayers between the BHJ layer and the electrodes.6,7
In contrast to inorganic PVs where surface doping is responsible for Ohmic contacts, OPVs require alternative strategies in terms of interface engineering. The introduction of buffer layers with electron and hole blocking (or transport) properties between the donor:acceptor active layer and the anode and cathode, respectively, can effectively reduce recombination and current leakage generated at the photoactive layer–electrode interface and enhance the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the device.8 A number of hole transporting layer (HTL) materials for OPVs have been used, including transition metal oxides (e.g. MoO3, NiO)9,10 and self-assembled organic molecules,11,12 with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) being the current state-of-art material. On the other hand, the most regularly used electron transport layer (ETL) materials include certain metal fluorides and13,14 n-type inorganic (e.g. TiOx and ZnO)15,16 and organic (e.g. bathocuproine)17 semiconductors. However, there are several drawbacks concerning the current state-of-the-art buffer layers, leading to decreased OPV stability, arising, for example, from the acidic and hygroscopic characters of PEDOT:PSS18 or the sensitiveness of sol–gel prepared TiOx to moisture, and also the increased manufacturing cost, since some metal oxides and metal fluorides require high vacuum thermal deposition and therefore are incompatible with roll-to-roll (r2r) processes and thus with flexible photovoltaics. In addition, the majority of the aforementioned materials do not allow their work function (WF) to be tuned,19 preventing the direct energy match with the numerous active layer donors and acceptors and urging the need for universal, tuned WF buffer layer materials.
Recently, graphene oxide (GO), a graphene sheet functionalized with oxygen groups (e.g. epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl), and its derivatives have been investigated as alternative HTLs and ETLs.20–24 The availability of the reactive groups on GO sheets enables its further functionalization with molecules, manipulating in this way its optoelectronic properties.25,26 In addition, the solution processable character of GO27 and its derivatives is in accordance with the r2r mass fabrication processes that are often cited as the advantage of OPVs compared to conventional photovoltaic technologies. More importantly, its tunable WF character makes GO an ideal precursor for creating new materials with WF values perfectly matching the HOMO level of the donor material (a conjugated polymer) and the LUMO level of the acceptor material (usually a fullerene derivative). So far, only one study has investigated the photovoltaic performance of devices incorporating simultaneously GO derivatives as HT and ET layers, demonstrating 16% increase in the power convention efficiency (PCE).28 Nevertheless, the lack of WF tunability of the produced GO derivatives limits its application to only the well-studied poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) based cell, since hole or electron transport is not energetically possible with the current cutting edge active layers, such as poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Therefore low-cost, high-throughput, facile and r2r compatible methods for WF tuning of the GO buffer layers, which will allow their application in high efficient BHJ OPVs, are highly desirable.
In this work, a novel, all graphene-based buffer layer OPV device is realized, investigating the effect of the simultaneously utilization of two different solution processable functionalized GOs as cathode and anode buffer layers on the PCE of the device. The two r2r compatible graphene-based materials, previously prepared by our group, the first one through laser-induced doping of GO with chloride (GO–Cl) leading to a WF increase from 4.9 to 5.16 eV and 5.23 eV and the second one after a simple and fast functionalization of GO with Li alkali metal (GO–Li) leading to a WF decrease from 4.9 to 4.3 eV, exploited unique electron and hole blocking (or transport) properties, respectively. The increased WF of GO–Cl and on the other hand the reduced surface potential of GO–Li provide a direct match with the HOMO level of the donor PTB7 and the LUMO level of the acceptor PC71BM, respectively, leading to enhanced photovoltaic performance, outperforming by ∼19% the reference graphene free device. To our knowledge, the achieved PCE is the highest reported for all graphene based buffer layer OPV devices, opening new paths to develop a new generation of low cost, highly efficient, solution processable all-carbon solar cells.
Experimental section
Preparation of graphene oxide (GO)29,30
GO was prepared from purified natural graphite powder (Alfa Aesar, ∼200 mesh) according to a modified Hummers' method. Specifically, graphite powder (0.5 g) was placed into a cold mixture of concentrated H2SO4 (40 mL, 98%) and NaNO3 (0.375 g) under vigorous stirring for 1 h, in an ice bath. KMnO4 (3 g) was slowly added into the reaction mixture over 1 h. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 4 h. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature before being heated to 35 °C for 30 min, forming a thick paste. It was then poured into a beaker containing 50 mL of deionized water and further heated to 90 °C for 30 min. 200 mL of distilled water was added, followed by a slow addition of H2O2 (3 mL, 30%), turning the color of the solution from dark brown to yellow. The reaction mixture was then allowed to settle down and decanted. The graphite oxide obtained was then purified by repeated high-speed centrifugation (4200 rpm, 3 min) and redispersing in deionized water to neutralize the pH (∼10 times needed). Finally, the resulting GO was dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 48 h.
Preparation of photochlorinated graphene oxide (GO–Cl) films:23
The as-spun GO layers on ITO/glass substrates were subjected to irradiation by using a KrF excimer laser source emitting 20 ns pulses of 248 nm at 1 Hz repetition rate that was translated onto the film area. For uniform exposure of the whole sample to laser radiation, a top-flat beam profile of 20 × 10 mm2 was obtained using a beam homogenizer. The whole process took place in a vacuum chamber at 50 Torr Cl2 gas pressure maintained through a precision micro-valve system. Different combinations of laser powers (P) and number of pulses (Np) were tested in an effort to optimize the photochemical functionalization processes. In a typical experiment, the sample was irradiated at a constant P with Np = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120, 600 and 1200, corresponding to different photochemical reaction times.
Preparation of graphene oxide functionalized with lithium (GO–Li)24
The chemical functionalization of GO with lithium was performed using an aqueous solution of the previously prepared GO (1.5 mg mL−1, 40 mL). Li2CO3 (200 mg) was then added, and the solution was stirred for 1 h. A polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (0.45 μm) was used to filter and collect the solid, which was then dissolved in water (20 mL). The process of solution and filtration was repeated twice.
Preparation of the titanium suboxide (TiOx) solution:31
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide {Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, 5 mL}, 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 20 mL), and ethanolamine (H2NCH2CH2OH, 2 mL) were added into a three-neck flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was then stirred for 1 h at room temperature, followed by heating at 80 °C for 1 h and 120 °C for an additional 1 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature, and 10 mL of methanol was added.
OPV device fabrication
PCDTBT:PC71BM was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene:chlorobenzene (3:1) (o-DCB:CB) with a 1:4 (4 mg:16 mg) ratio. PTB7:PC71BM with a 1:1.5 (10 mg:15 mg) ratio was dissolved in chlorobenzene, followed by the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) to give an overall DIO amount of 3%. The photovoltaic devices reported were fabricated on 20 mm by 15 mm indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of ∼20 Ω sq−1. The impurities were removed from the ITO glass through a three-step cleaning process (detergent deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol). Before the deposition of the hole transport layer (HTL), the substrates were placed inside an ultraviolet ozone cleaner in order to remove the organic contamination and increase the surface hydrophilicity of ITO-coated substrates. The PEDOT:PSS (Al 4083) HTL, purchased from Heraeus, was spin-cast from an aqueous solution on the ITO substrate at 6000 rpm for 60 s and the average thickness of the layer was 30 nm, followed by baking for 15 min at 120 °C inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. All photoactive layers were subsequently deposited by spin-coating the blend solutions at 1000 rpm on top of PEDOT:PSS, GO and GO–Cl layers. Then the electron extraction layers were coated by spin casting the solutions on top of the active layers. The TiOx interlayer was dissolved in methanol (1:200) and then spin coated to a thickness of approximately 10 nm (6000 rpm, 40 s) in air. GO and GO–Li interlayers were deposited through spin coating at 2000 rpm for 60 s and both controlled to be 2 ± 0.3 nm thick. The devices with the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend were then heated at 80 °C for 1 min in air, while the PTB7:PC71 BM-based devices were dried inside a vacuum antichamber with dynamic vacuum for ≈15 min. Finally, 100 nm of Al was deposited, at a standard rate of 1.5 Å s−1, through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation on the devices to define an active area of 4 mm2 for each device.
The performances of the devices were measured at room temperature with an Air Mass 1.5 Global (A.M. 1.5 G) solar simulator at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A reference monocrystalline silicon solar cell from Newport was used to calibrate the light intensity. The external quantum efficiency measurements were conducted immediately after device fabrication using an integrated system (Enlitech, Taiwan) and a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions. The light spectrum was calibrated using a monocrystalline photodetector of known spectral response. The OPV devices were measured using a Xe lamp passing through a monochromator and an optical chopper at low frequencies (∼200 Hz) in order to maximize the signal/noise (S/N) ratio. The spot size of the incident monochromatic light was absolutely equal to the device active area.
Results and discussion
Work function tuning
The as-synthesized GO through the modified Hummers method was used as the pristine material to perform the functionalization and the subsequent WF tuning. In particular, the as-spun GO layers on ITO/glass substrates were subjected to irradiation by using a KrF excimer laser source emitting 20 ns pulses of 248 nm at 1 Hz repetition rate in the presence of chlorine (Cl2) precursor gas. To implement and investigate the GO WF tuning, different numbers of pulses (Np) were used, increasing from 1 to 65. Fig. 1a presents the GO WF change with respect to the applied Np. It is clear that the WF increases as the exposure is more intense, and tends to saturate at 5.23 eV for Np = 60, because after this point the level of reduction tends to be very important in the tradeoff between the reduction and doping. In particular, the polar character of C–Cl bonds induced by the formation of surface Cδ+-Clδ− dipoles owing to the different electronegativity between carbon and chloride (2.55 for C compared to 3.16 for Cl) is responsible for the downward shift of the Fermi level towards the valence band of GO–Cl, and the subsequent increase in the WF.32,33 Thus, this simultaneous chloride doping20 and partial reduction process34 gives the possibility of a wide WF tuning allowing the use of GO–Cl as a universal HTL in different optoeletronic devices. Fig. 1b demonstrates such dipole formation in the C–Cl covalent bonds at the edges and/or Cl–CO groups located outside the graphene basal plane.30

In contrast to laser induced chloride doping of GO, the replacement of –H in the carboxyl groups of GO with Li atoms can effectively reduce the WF of GO. The GO doping was performed using lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) as the precursor. Lithium has a low electronegativity value and low WF (2.9 eV). When bonded in GO, Li atoms lose their valence electrons to the GO plane, resulting in positive Li+ inducing dipoles.35 The generated charge transfer from the metal to the GO plane leads to an upward shift of the Fermi level toward the vacuum, yielding a difference in the Fermi level between the two materials of 0.68 eV, which is responsible for the decrease of the WF to ∼4.3 ± 0.1 eV as depicted in the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) (Fig. 2a) establishing GO–Li as an ideal candidate ETL material for OPVs, since its WF perfectly matches the LUMO level of the state of the art electron acceptor materials (PC71BM). Fig. 2b summarizes our findings on GO functionalization to produce GO-based materials with tunable WF (increased or decreased) values with respect to the pristine materials to be used in a variety of optoelectronic applications.

(b) Energy diagram showing the Fermi level of GO (middle) and its shifting after the functionalization with Cl (left) and Li alkali metal (right). In the case of photochlorination different WF values can be achieved by controlling the number of pulses (in this case Np = 20 or 60). 
Photovoltaic performance
To assess the viability of the proposed GO WF tuning methods in optoelectronic applications, different structures of PCDTBT:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM-based OPV devices were fabricated. More particularly, the effects of the incorporation of GO–Cl (with different WF values) as the HTL and the GO–Li as the ETL on device performance were investigated and compared with the state of the art buffer layer materials (PEDOT:PSS and TiOx as the HTL and the ETL, respectively). The device structure and the energy level diagrams of the different materials used in this study are shown in Fig. 3.

The averaged photovoltaic characteristics obtained from 10 identical devices, consisting of 6 cells each (60 current density–voltage (J–V) curves in total), are summarized in Table 1 and indicate that the incorporation of GO–Cl as the HTL and GO–Li as the ETL significantly increases the device efficiency by ∼12% and ∼8% compared to the reference device (PEDOT:PSS as the HTL and TiOx as the ETL). As depicted in Fig. 3b, the proposed laser induced technique for WF tuning allowed to produce universal graphene-based HT material with desirable electronic properties. In particular, OPV devices with two different polymer donors (a) PCDTBT with a HOMO of 5.5 eV and (b) PTB7 with a HOMO of 5.15 eV were fabricated to clarify the effect of the use of GO–Cl with different WF values on photovoltaic performance. Fig. 4a shows the typical illuminated (100 mW cm−2) J–V curves of the PCDTBT:PC71BM OPV devices incorporating PEDOT:PSS, GO and GO–Cl with different WFs as HTLs. A significant enhancement in the photovoltaic performance upon the increase of GO–Cl WF values can be observed, leading to a PCE of 6.56% for GO–Cl (5.23 eV) compared to the reference devices with PEDOT:PSS (5.49%) and GO (5.59%) HTLs, which can be attributed to the improved hole transport as verified by the hole mobility measurements.20 The universal applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by the fact that the less laser exposed GO–Cl sample exhibiting a WF of 5.16 eV (Np = 20) was used as the HTL in PTB7:PC71BM devices achieving a record PCE of 8.28% for graphene-based HTL devices (Fig. 4b). This difference in optimum WF values for GO–Cl applied in the two different photoactive blends can be explained by the induced offset between the two donor's HOMO level and the WF of the GO–Cl. In particular, PTB7-based devices using 20 pulses for GO chlorination induce a ∼0.01 eV energy barrier between the HOMO of the PTB7 and the WF of GO–Cl, while in the PCDTBT case, the corresponding minimum energy barrier is 0.27 eV (Fig. 4c). Therefore, it can be concluded that the ability to fine-tune the GO–Cl WF with respect to the polymer-donor energy levels offers a facile route to boost the OPV PCEs.

Fig. 5 shows the illuminated J–V curves of the PCDTBT:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM-based OPV devices with TiOx, and GO–Li/TiOx as ETLs. The reference PCDTBT:PC71BM-based device incorporating the TiOx ETL yielded a PCE of 5.53%, with a short circuit current density (JSC) of 11.28 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 882 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 55.6%, compared to the GO–Li/TiOx bilayer ETL based device that yielded a significantly enhanced PCE of 6.25%, with a JSC of 12.51 mA cm−2, a VOC of 884 mV, and a FF of 56.5%. In addition, PCDTBT-based devices were prepared by replacing the GO–Li interfacial layer with GO to better clarify the effect of WF tuning in device efficiency. In this case, a significant decrease of the JSC by ∼15% and of the FF by ∼9% was observed, which can be attributed to the energy offset of 0.6 eV between the LUMO level of the acceptor material (4.3 ± 0.1 eV) and the GO WF (4.95 ± 0.1 eV). For ideal electron transport, the LUMO level of the acceptor material should be absolutely equal to the WF of the ETL. Therefore, as the GO–Li WF perfectly matches the LUMO of PC71BM and TiOx ETLs, the electrons transport to the cathode is conducted without energy barriers. The JSC enhancement can be attributed to the improved electron transportation due to the 2D nature of the GO–Li interfacial ETL. Atomic force microscopy measurements have also verified that GO–Li has a planarizing role,24 creating a perfect interface between the TiOx ETL and the cathode, leading to an improved Ohmic contact and therefore minimizing the contact resistance at the interface.24 In this context OPV devices were fabricated using PTB7 as the polymer donor. After the introduction of GO–Li between the active layer and the TiOx the device PCE was increased from 7.4% to 7.98%, mainly due to a significant increase in the JSC which is maybe caused by the improved electron extraction as in the case of PCDTBT based devices.24

To further support the excellent hole and electron extraction capabilities of GO–Cl and GO–Li, respectively, OPV devices incorporating graphene-based materials as both HT and ET layers were fabricated. For this purpose, the performance of both the reference device with the configuration of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC71BM or PTB7:PC71BM/TiOx/Al and the one structured as glass/ITO/GO–Cl/PCDTBT:PC71BM or PTB7:PC71BM/GO–Li/TiOx/Al was investigated. Fig. 6 depicts the J–V curves of the tested devices. Clearly, in both BHJ active layers there is a significant JSC improvement (28% for PCDTBT and 18% for PTB7-based devices) upon the addition of graphene-based interlayers. One the one hand, this is because of the WF match between GO–Li and the LUMO level of PC71BM, with the GO–Li modified electrode forming an Ohmic contact with the PCDTBT:PC71BM and PTB7:PC71BM active layers for improved electron extraction. On the other hand, the WF tuning of GO–Cl produces HTL materials that match the HOMO level of PCDTBT and PTB7 ensuring an Ohmic contact at the interface for efficient hole extraction. On the other hand, the alignment of the GO HTL WF to the polymer HOMO, through photochlorination, does not result in a change in the VOC. The maximum VOC of bulk heterojunction OPV devices typically results from the polymer donor and fullerene acceptor interface gap, which is the energy difference between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the fullerene.36,37 In this way, charge transfer leads the WFs of the ETL and the HTL to be pinned to the LUMO of the fullerene and the HOMO of the polymer, respectively.38 Therefore, the VOC is unaffected, since regarding the WF of the GO–Cl HTL employed, a Fermi level pinning of the HTL WF to the HOMO of the polymer donor takes place, in full agreement with previous studies.39,40 On top of that the actual interface between the HTL and the active layer does not change upon the WF tuning process, since the photochlorination takes place on the spin-coated GO films and does not cause any morphological changes. As a result, both graphene-based buffer layer OPV devices significantly outperformed the reference ones, leading to a PCE improvement of 30% for PCDTBT and 19% for PTB7-based devices and to a record PCE of 9.14% for graphene-based buffer layer devices.

The dark J–V curves (Fig. S1†) also show excellent diode characteristics with very low leakage current and high rectification ratio for the combination of both HT and ET graphene based devices (forward to reverse factor higher than 103) exhibiting that the injected current density in the dark (0.5–1.0 V) is higher than that of the reference device. This is in full agreement with the assumed reduced injection barrier. In order to get an insight into the responsible mechanism of the enhanced device performance, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves (Fig. 6c) of the devices with different buffer layer combinations were measured and compared with those of the pristine one. The pristine device exhibits a maximum IPCE of ∼69%, while the GO–Cl/GO–Li based devices exhibit an enhanced maximum of ∼86% using PTB7 as the donor material. This significant and broad enhancement is in agreement with increased JSC observed in the J–V measurements. It should also be noted that the JSC calculated by integrating the IPCE spectrum with the AM 1.5 G spectrum, for the pristine and the GO–Cl/GO–Li based PTB7-PC71BM devices, are 15.75 and 18.51 mA cm−2, respectively. The actual JSC measured from J–V curves was 4% larger than the IPCE calculated values, indicating good accuracy of the OPV measurement. It should be noted that the J–V curves were firstly recorded inside the glovebox in encapsulated OPV devices, and moved outside the glovebox for the IPCE measurements.
The increased value of JSC was also investigated through electron and hole mobility measurements (Fig. S2†). For that purpose electron- and hole-only devices were fabricated with the following structure: ITO/HTL/Active layer/ETL/Au for the hole-only and ITO/Al/HTL/Active layer/ETL/Al for the electron only device, respectively. The values calculated were improved for both electron and hole mobilities. Calculations were based on the Mott–Gurney equation:  in which εr is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of free-space, m is the charge carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage, Vbi is the built-in potential and d is the thickness of the active layer. The mobility values for the reference OPV device were μe = 7.86 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron and μh = 1.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole mobility while for the GO–Cl/GO–Li based cells the values were μe = 1.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron and μh = 1.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the hole mobility, respectively. The mobilities were not only increased, especially the electron mobility, but also balanced which is a very important factor in order to prevent charge accumulation in the device. Before further analyzing our results we should first shed light on the functional mechanism taking place. Because holes are collected at the front electrode in the conventional device structure, and taking into account that the most of the excitons are created nearby the front contact the holes mobilities should have a slightly lower value compared to the electron mobility. Thus, this is the reason that PTB7 based OPV devices (μh > μe) have lower PCE values in the conventional structure compared to the inverted one and in our case this is maybe the reason for the lower PCE enhancement of PTB7 compared to PCDTBT (μh > μe). In this context, this is a crucial improvement because electron transport is considered as a factor that limits the photocurrent generation in the conventional PTB7 based devices, since the electron mobility is much lower than the hole mobility. Both electron and hole mobility increases should be attributed on the one hand to the GO–Li planarizing role24 and perfect energy level matching and on the other hand to perfect WF tuning of GO after the photochlorination process. As a result, when we combined GO–Cl HTL and GO–Li interfacial layers the μh/μe ratio was significantly reduced, from 1.65 to 1.20 as it is observed in Table 2. We can thus assume that if we use the inverted structure with the proposed graphene based buffer layers the improvement in the PCE could be much higher than that of the conventional structure used here.

In order to examine and confirm our findings (increased JSC and balanced mobilities) we studied the charge recombination kinetics at short circuit for the reference and for the devices with graphene based buffer layers. The JSC can be correlated to illumination intensity (Ilight) by,JSC = ∝Ilightn, (n ≤ 1)
At short circuit, the bimolecular recombination should be minimum (n < 1) for maximum carrier sweep out. Any deviation from a < 1 implies bimolecular recombination.41 Fig. S3† shows JSCvs. I fitted using the power law described above. The fitting of the data yields a = 0.870 for the reference device, which can be attributed to bimolecular recombination. After the introduction of GO–Cl and GO–Li, a is 0.968, which implies that bimolecular recombination is significantly reduced. To gain further insight into the origin of the enhanced JSC in the device, one-dimensional transfer matrix formalism based on optical modeling calculations assuming monochromatic light propagating normal to the device layers was conducted.42Fig. 7 presents the simulated optical electric field distribution, |E2|, as a function of wavelength in the reference OPV device and using different combinations of buffer layer as reported previously. The optical constants of the PCDTBT:PC71BM layer were obtained from previous reports.43 As shown in Fig. 7, the optical electric field amplitude is significantly enhanced for the device with the GO–Li interfacial layer and GO–Cl as the HTL, compared with that of the reference device with only the TiOx as the ETL and with PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. The highest optical electric field amplitudes are 0.745 and 0.619 for the dual graphene based buffer device and reference, respectively. This electric field enhancement is directly attributed to the better refractive index (n) matching in the sandwich devices using the graphene based buffer layer compared to the reference sandwich. In particular, for the reference device PEDOT:PSS n value is ∼1.5, PTB7:PC71BM is ∼1.9 and TiOx ∼2.5 and for the graphene based buffer layer device GO–Cl n value is ∼1.9, PTB7:PC71BM is ∼1.9, GO–Li is ∼2 and TiOx is ∼2.5. In this way, an important part of the incident electric field is reflected at the interface between PEDOT:PSS and the active layer while in the case of GO–Cl due to the perfect n matching the interface parasitic reflection is minimum. Also, GO–Li n matches with the n of the active layer and TiOx acting as a bridge gradually allowing the electric field to pass through the device and thus increasing its intensity.44 We can conclude that the addition of the graphene based buffer layers increases the electric field amplitude in the photoactive layer, and therefore, more photocurrent is generated in the devices. This effect acts in synergy with the observed balanced charge mobilities. Therefore, the enhancement in PCE upon the addition of a GO–Li interfacial layer and the GO–Cl HTL can be attributed to the observed reduced recombination at the interfaces, balanced charge mobilities, and the enhanced electric field in the device.

It is important to note that the significant transparency differences (∼12%, Fig. S4†) between the PEDOT:PSS and graphene-based HTLs increase the exciton generation (G) in the active layer, which is clearly indicated by the improvement of the maximum |E|2 (Fig. 7a and b). By increasing the HTL transparency, the incident light reaching the active layer also increases, leading to improved G. Considering that |E|2 is proportional to G,45 graphene-based HTL devices would exhibit much higher IPCE values, as verified in IPCE measurements presented in Fig. 6c. In summary, the increased HTL transparency acts in synergy with the better refractive index matching between the graphene-based HTL and ETLs and the PTB7:PC71BM active layer, leading to the ∼20% improvement in |E|2. Taking also into account that graphene-based buffer layers improve the charge carrier mobilities of the OPV device, it is expected that the respective charge collection would be much higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS HTL and the neat TiOx ETL based devices. The above support the improved IPCE values for the graphene-based devices.
To further verify the EQE enhancement mechanisms, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra were calculated using the optical model as follows. Firstly, the absorption spectrum, extracted from the reflection spectrum (R) by 1 R, assuming that the Al back contact is a perfect mirror of the devices with different materials used as buffer layers, was derived from the optical modeling, taking into account that the absorption is mainly from the active layer. The IQE of the devices was deduced from EQE (Fig. 6c) and reflected absorption (Fig. S5a†), respectively.46 It can be observed that the combo device IQE (Fig. S5b†) is enhanced compared to the reference device due to (a) the balanced charge carrier mobilities (Table 2), (b) the reduced bimolecular recombination (Fig. S3†) when GO–Cl and GO–Li were used as HT and ET layers and (c) the improved n matching of the two graphene-based buffer layers with the photoactive blend. It is worth noting that in the regions in which the PTB7:PC71BM absorption coefficient is maximum, the IQE presents a significant improvement reaching a maximum of ∼97%, further supporting the fact that the WF matching of the buffer layers with the donor and acceptor energy levels contributes to highly efficient charge carrier collection per incident absorbed photon. Moreover, the calculated IQE peak is less than the 100% theoretical maximum, ensuring that the calculations were accurate.
Conclusion
In summary, this work demonstrates how the WF tuning of the buffer layers can affect the performance of OPV devices. Two facile, fast, non-destructive and r2r compatible methods are briefly presented, which allowed the WF fine tuning of graphene-based derivatives to develop universal buffer layers that directly match the energy levels of the polymer donor and electron acceptor in the state-of-the art OPVs. OPVs with a GO–Cl as the HTL exhibited a PCE of 8.28%, much higher than those of reference devices with GO (7.56%) or PEDOT:PSS (7.40%), while the incorporation of GO–Li as the ET interlayer between the active layer and the TiOx optical spacer led to a PCE of 7.98% which was significantly increased compared to the reference one (7.40%). The excellent hole and electron extraction capabilities of GO–Cl and GO–Li were combined to an all graphene-based buffer layer OPV device which exhibited a PCE of 9.14% (8.83% average), significantly outperforming the reference one by ∼19%. The described methods can contribute to novel interface engineering approaches, creating graphene- and other 2D material-based derivatives as excellent potential candidates for a wide range of new applications with tunable optoelectrical properties, including flexible electronic OPVs, perovskite solar cells, organic light emitting diodes, and photosensors, as well as traditional electronic devices.
