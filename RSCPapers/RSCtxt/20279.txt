    , Accepted 28th April 2016First published on 28th April 2016AbstractUltrafast time-resolved ion yield (TR-IY) and velocity map imaging spectroscopies are employed to reveal the relaxation dynamics after photoexcitation in ethyl 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamate (ethyl ferulate, EF), an active ingredient in commercially available sunscreens. In keeping with a bottom-up strategy, the building blocks of EF, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (MVP) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamyl alcohol (coniferyl alcohol, ConA), were also studied to assist in our understanding of the dynamics of EF as we build up in molecular complexity. In contrast to the excited state dynamics of MVP and ConA, which are described by a single time constant (>900 ps), the dynamics of EF are described by three time constants (15 ± 4 ps, 148 ± 47 ps, and >900 ps). A mechanism is proposed involving internal conversion (IC) between the initially excited S1(11ππ*) and S2(11nπ*) states followed by intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) on both states, in competition with intersystem crossing onto neighbouring triplet states (15 ± 4 ps). IVR and IC within the triplet manifold then ensues (148 ± 47 ps) to populate a low-lying triplet state (>900 ps). Importantly, the fluorescence spectrum of EF at the S1 origin, along with the associated lifetime (6.9 ± 0.1 ns), suggests that population is trapped, during initial IVR, on the S1(11ππ*) state. This serves to demonstrate the complex, competing dynamics in this sunscreen filter molecule.
Introduction
Many living organisms have an intrinsic need for protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by the Sun.1 While the solar spectrum peaks in the visible range (700–400 nm), a significant amount of UV-A and UV-B radiation (400–315 nm and 315–280 nm, respectively) reaches the surface of the Earth; on a sunny day, approximately 220 μW cm−2 globally.2,3 UV initiated reactions resulting in DNA damage within skin cells are well-established phenomena, with such reactions leading to skin aging and carcinogenic effects, including melanoma and carcinoma.4–9 Both plant and animal species are naturally equipped with defence mechanisms against potentially toxic radiation,10 either within their DNA itself11,12 or through radiation filtering, “sunscreen”, molecules, e.g. (eu)melanin in humans.13–15 Such filters absorb efficiently in the UV, yet their physical and chemical properties allow for the safe dissipation of this potentially harmful energy, returning the molecule to its original ground state.
The increasing incidence of UV-A and UV-B radiation on the Earth's surface16,17 and the emerging trend for more Sun exposure over recent years has meant that this natural protection is often insufficient, with skin cancer cases increasing steadily between 1975 and 2011.18–21 There is, therefore, a strong impetus for understanding the photoprotective mechanisms of both natural and artificial sunscreen molecules.
The interest in extra chemical protection from the Sun's radiation dates back to 1936, when the first sunscreen product was made available by L'Oréal's founder, E. Schueller.22 Since then, while the sunscreen industry has expanded greatly, little progress has been made in understanding the photophysical mechanisms through which sunscreens provide photoprotection. For instance, it is not clear whether the components of the current commercially available sunscreens release reactive oxygen species upon absorption of UV radiation. The creation of such reactive species would imply sunscreens can potentially increase the risk of melanoma, rather than reduce it.23 Efforts have recently begun towards spectroscopic studies of natural (plant and human) and synthetic sunscreen molecules in order to garner information on their excited state photodynamics and consequently contribute to the development of more efficient, safer sunscreens.24–29
Ethyl 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamate (ethyl ferulate, EF), shown in Fig. 1(c), was chosen for the present studies due to its use in commercial sunscreens as a UV filter and antioxidant.30–32 Similar to all active sunscreen ingredients, EF is used in these products as part of a combination of radiation filtering species in order to achieve optimum filtering efficiency across the entire UV-A and UV-B range (usually measured in terms of the Sun protection factor, SPF).33 The broad absorption of EF in the UV region (see Fig. S1 in ESI†), justifies the presence of EF in sunscreen formulas.

The research presented here explores the excited state photodynamics of EF, building on previous studies of sunscreen molecules published in recent years.24–29 EF presents itself as an extremely relevant system to be studied, not only due to its practical relevance as a sunscreen filter molecule, but also due to the insight provided into how increasing molecular complexity, in particular the addition of a carbonyl moiety (through the ester group functionality), influences the photochemistry of EF and other structurally related sunscreen molecules. To achieve this, we also study the subunits of EF, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (MVP) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamyl alcohol (ConA) shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) respectively.
Experimental methods
a. Time-resolved ion yield (TR-IY)
The experimental setup has been described previously,34,35 and therefore is only summarised here, being expanded as necessary with regards to the present experimental conditions. A commercial femtosecond (fs) Ti:sapphire oscillator (Spectra-Physics Tsunami) and regenerative amplifier (Spectra-Physics Spitfire XP) are used to produce ∼40 fs laser pulses centred at 800 nm at ∼3 mJ per pulse. The fundamental 800 nm output is subsequently split into three beams, each ∼1 mJ per pulse, with one of these beams used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (Light Conversion, TOPAS-C) in order to generate the pump (hνpu) pulses. hνpu is centred on the S1 origin band (S1 (v = 0)) of each molecule studied (305 nm, 306 nm and 317.5 nm for MVP, ConA and EF, respectively; vide infra). A second beam is up-converted via frequency doubling the 800 nm fundamental output in a type-I β-barium borate (BBO) crystal to generate 400 nm, followed by successive frequency mixing with the residual 800 nm pulses to generate the third harmonic (267 nm) and finally the desired 200 nm fourth harmonic (using type-II and type-I BBO crystals, respectively) which is used as the probe (hνpr) pulse for these experiments. Alternatively, a second TOPAS-C is used to generate 243 nm probe pulses. The pump and probe pulses are temporally delayed with respect to each other by way of a hollow gold retroreflector mounted on a motorised delay stage, allowing a maximum temporal delay (Δt) of 900 ps (hνpr = 200 nm) or 1.2 ns (hνpr = 243 nm). The relative polarisation between the pump and probe beams is held at the magic angle (54.7°).
The two laser beams intercept a molecular beam which is produced by seeding the target molecules (EF, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%; ConA, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%; or MVP, VWR International Ltd., 97%), heated to their melting points (55–95 °C), into helium (∼3 bar). This is then expanded into a vacuum (∼10−7 mbar) using an Even-Lavie pulsed solenoid valve.36 At the point of intersection, hνpu excites the species in the molecular beam and hνpr ionises any excited (or photodissociated; vide infra) species. The resulting ions are focused onto a detector, consisting of two microchannel plates (MCPs), by three ion optics similar to the set up described by Eppink and Parker.37 The current output from the MCP, gated in ion flight time over the mass channel of each parent ion ([MVP]+, [ConA]+, and [EF]+), is measured on a digital oscilloscope (LeCroy LT372 Waverunner) and integrated as a function of Δt in order to produce time-resolved ion yield (TR-IY) transients.
b. Velocity map imaging (VMI) of H atoms
Velocity map imaging (VMI) is used to monitor any H atom elimination from the molecules of interest, following excitation. Any photodissociated H atoms are resonantly ionised to form H+ with a 243 nm probe pulse set at Δt = 1.2 ns relative to the pump pulse. H+ ions are then accelerated by an electrostatic potential onto a position-sensitive detector such that ions with the same initial velocity are mapped onto a single pixel on the detector.37 The original 3D H+ distribution is reconstructed from the measured 2D projection using a polar onion peeling algorithm38 from which the desired 1D total kinetic energy release (TKER) spectrum can be derived using an appropriate Jacobian, energy calibration factor, and consideration of the co-fragment's mass. The spectrometer is calibrated using the TKER spectrum of photolysed HBr.39
c. Resonant two-photon ionisation (R2PI) and ionisation potential (IP) determination of EF
Mass-resolved resonant two-photon ionisation (R2PI) studies were carried out for EF using a molecular beam time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) described in detail elsewhere.40 The solid sample is wrapped in glass wool and inserted into a glass sample holder, which is placed inside a stainless-steel reservoir behind a general valve (Parker, Series 9) operating at 20 Hz. The sample and valve assembly are heated (90–95 °C) in order to achieve sufficient vapour pressure of the sample. The sample is then entrained in a Ne backing gas (2–4 bar) and expanded through a pin-hole nozzle (800 μm) forming a supersonic expansion. The supersonic expansion is skimmed downstream forming a molecular beam which travels to the extraction region of a TOF-MS where the cold, isolated molecules interact with the laser beams.
The frequency doubled output of a Nd:YAG (Continuum SureLite II) pumped dye laser is used to generate a UV beam (310–319 nm, DCM dye, <1 mJ per pulse) which is loosely focused into the interaction region. R2PI spectra are recorded by collecting the molecular ion yield as a function of the laser wavelength.
The ionisation potential (IP) of each of the EF conformers was determined by employing two-color R2PI (2C-R2PI), which has been previously described in detail.41–43 In order to determine the IP, the two-colour signal enhancement is maximised; the second colour is then scanned towards increasingly longer wavelength until the two-colour contribution to the ion signal goes to zero at the threshold. If the geometry change between the excited state and the ion is sufficiently small, a sharp onset is observed at the threshold, providing an accurate measure of the IP. The energy of the two photons at the threshold of ionisation corresponds to the IP of the molecule.
d. UV–UV hole-burning (UVHB)
Conformer specific UV spectra were also recorded for EF, using a setup described previously.40 The doubled output of a Continuum SureLite II Nd:YAG pumped dye laser (Lambda-Physik ScanMate), operating at 10 Hz and <2 mJ per pulse, is fixed on the origin band (S1 (v = 0)) of each of the two conformers of EF present (determined from analysis of the R2PI spectra obtained as described above) thus serving as the hole-burn laser. The burn laser is spatially overlapped with a UV probe laser (Radiant Dyes NarrowScan, 0.5–1 mJ per pulse, 20 Hz) and precedes it temporally by ∼200 ns. The probe laser is scanned over the frequency range of interest (310–319 nm). The difference between the signal with and without the presence of the hole-burn laser is recorded using active baseline subtraction in a gated integrator (Stanford Research SRS250).
e. Dispersed fluorescence and total fluorescence lifetimes
The laser induced fluorescence apparatus is described elsewhere.40 EF was heated to approximately 90–95 °C, entrained in ∼3 bar of helium, and pulsed into a vacuum through an 800 μm orifice (Parker General Valve Series 9) to produce a supersonic jet expansion. The sample was excited downstream in the collision-free regime using the doubled output of a Lambda-Physik ScanMate dye laser and the total resulting fluorescence was detected with a photomultiplier tube as a function of time. A pair of filters (340/345 nm) were used to cut out scattered light from the excitation laser when measuring fluorescence lifetimes; filters transmitting >400 nm were used to search for phosphorescence. Dispersed fluorescence measurements were achieved by dispersing the fluorescence in a 0.75 m monochromator (Horiba Jobin Yvon, 1200 grooves per mm) outfitted with an iCCD camera (Andor, iStar 720, 25 mm). Dispersed fluorescence measurements were background subtracted with scans with no sample to remove any laser scatter present in the spectra.
Theoretical methods
Quantum mechanical calculations were performed to obtain ground and excited state geometries for MVP, ConA, and EF. Geometry optimised structures were calculated using Gaussian09 (ref. 44) with density functional theory (DFT) and the Coulomb attenuated model Becke-3rd parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (CAM-B3LYP) functional45 combined with a 6-31G* basis set.46
The S0/S3 (E/Z isomerisation) conical intersection (CI) structure in EF was optimised at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF)47,48/6-31G* level of theory using Gaussian09 and a 6 electron, 6 orbital (6,6) active space consisting of three occupied π and three unoccupied π* orbitals. The CI structure between the S1 and S2 states (ππ* and nπ* states, respectively) was optimised at the same level of theory as above, however, employing a (10,9) active space, adding to the previous active space one occupied σ orbital, one unoccupied σ* orbital (localised on the CO bond), and one occupied n orbital (localised on the double bonded O atom).
Potential energy cuts (PECs) were produced by calculating the energies of the first four singlet electronic states (S0, S1(11ππ*), S2(11nπ*), and S3(21ππ*)) of EF at various points along each of the linearly interpolated internal coordinates (LIIC) from the various minimum energy geometries to their respective CIs. This was done using Molpro 2010.1 (ref. 49) and employing fully state averaged CASSCF along with its second order perturbation theory extension (CASPT2)50 using a cc-pVDZ basis set51 and a (12,10) active space, adding an additional occupied π orbital to the previously described (10,9) active space.
Results
a. Excited state dynamics in MVP
We start this section with the simplest molecule of the series studied, MVP, the structure of which is shown in Fig. 1(a). MVP has been shown to exist as two stable conformers which form a syn/anti pair.25 The molecule was photoexcited to the S1 origin band (v = 0) of the syn-conformer, which lies at 305 nm. The S1 origin band of the anti-conformer is 805 cm−1 higher in energy.25 As the bandwidth of the laser pulses used in these TR-IY experiments is ∼500 cm−1, it is not possible to access the origin of the syn- and anti-conformers simultaneously, and as such the dynamics inferred herein can be considered to be conformer specific.
The parent TR-IY transient resulting from exciting MVP at 305 nm and probing with 200 nm is shown in Fig. 2(a), along with the kinetic fit for these data (red line). This transient was fitted with two exponential decay functions (see ESI† for details pertaining to the kinetic fits) convolved with the Gaussian instrument response function (IRF ∼ 160 fs). The time constants returned, as summarised in Table 1, are (i) an ultrafast component of <50 fs, which, by comparison with previous work,52 we attribute to multiphoton absorption and ionisation, and (ii) a slow decay, with a time constant outside of the temporal window of these experiments (>900 ps). This latter time constant is reminiscent of that seen in previous studies on the MVP subunit, guaiacol.53 The addition of a vinyl group to guaiacol, therefore, does not result in a dramatic difference between the dynamics of these two molecules. While there are notable reverse (probe-pump) dynamics observable in MVP compared to guaiacol, the probe wavelength of 200 nm puts these dynamics well outside the UV-A and UV-B regions and so beyond the scope of this work. As such here, and for our ensuing discussions of ConA and EF, we do not discuss these in any great detail but note their presence where appropriate.

b. Excited state dynamics in ConA
We now increase the molecular complexity of our target molecule through the study of ConA. Once again, the molecule is photoexcited to the S1 origin (v = 0) of its lowest energy conformer which, for the syn-conformer, corresponds to 306 nm.25 The syn-conformer of ConA lies 723 cm−1 lower in energy relative to the anti-conformer,25 which, as previously discussed for MVP, allows for conformer specific results to be obtained (vide supra).
The TR-IY parent transient of ConA is shown in Fig. 2(b) along with the overall kinetic fit (blue line). The TR-IY transient of ConA can be fitted with a single exponential decay function returning a time constant outside our temporal window (>900 ps). Unlike MVP, no multiphoton absorption/ionisation artifact in ConA is observed, which serves as the only main difference between the excited state dynamics of ConA and MVP. We once again note for completeness that there are reverse dynamics following photoexcitation with 200 nm in ConA.
c. Excited state dynamics in EF

i. R2PI and UVHB spectroscopy. 
The final molecule studied is EF. The very limited literature on the spectroscopy of EF necessitated the acquisition of high energy resolution spectroscopy data to elucidate both the origin band(s) and the conformational make-up of this molecule. To this end, R2PI and UVHB spectra for EF are presented in Fig. 3. UVHB spectroscopy reveals the existence of two conformers of EF, lying very close in energy (∼15 cm−1), with origin bands lying at 317.39 nm and 317.55 nm. Given the small spectral shift between the proposed syn- and anti-conformers of EF, and their close energetic proximity, we have not attempted to assign which UVHB spectrum in Fig. 3 is due to which conformer, nor did we undertake assignment of the vibronic bands, as we used the spectra in Fig. 3 primarily to provide a guide to the spectral location of the origin bands of the conformers present in the expansion.
 Fig. 3  R2PI spectrum (black) and UV–UV hole burn spectra of conformers A (red) and B (blue) for EF. The origin bands (labelled with *) are 317.39 nm and 317.55 nm for conformers A and B, respectively. The IP for both conformers was determined to be 7.73 eV. We note here that the signal from the R2PI spectrum has likely saturated the detector at the highest peaks. This was not avoided as, for the purposes of the current work, we were concerned only with the number of conformers present and the energies of their respective origin bands. 


ii. Laser induced and dispersed fluorescence. 
The total fluorescence lifetime of EF when excited at the origin of conformer A was measured to be 6.9 ± 0.1 ns (see ESI†). Attempts to observe any phosphorescence at longer wavelengths (>400 nm) and/or time delays (100 s of ns) produced no measurable signal. Dispersed fluorescence measurements (Fig. 4) following excitation of the electronic origin of the two conformers shows Franck–Condon activity consistent with emission almost exclusively from the S1 origin in the 315–345 nm region, although there is likely a contribution to this signal from scatter of the excitation laser.
 Fig. 4  Dispersed fluorescence from the origin transitions of (a) conformer A and (b) conformer B of EF. We note that scatter is likely to contribute to the large relative intensity of the peak at the origin of both conformers. 


iii. Time-resolved ion yield. 
EF was photoexcited at 317.5 nm (S1 origin) and probed at 200 nm in order to ensure photoionisation from any lower lying states accessed upon relaxation of the initially photoexcited S1 state (see Discussion). The ∼500 cm−1 bandwidth of the pump accesses both conformers simultaneously and thus conformer specific dynamics are not possible (contrary to the case for MVP and ConA). The resulting TR-IY parent transient is shown in Fig. 2(c), along with the overall kinetic fit (green line). The TR-IY parent transient requires a minimum of three exponential decays (see ESI† for attempted fits with one and two decays), as summarised in Table 1. The time constants extracted are 15 ± 4 ps, 148 ± 47 ps and a long lived component which persists beyond the temporal limit of our experiment (>900 ps). These dynamics are clearly different from those observed for MVP and ConA and these differences are explored in the Discussion section below. For completeness, we note that in the case of EF, no reverse dynamics are observed.
TR-IY studies at lower probe energies (322 nm cf. 200 nm, Fig. 5) yield, within error, similar time constants, but the data can be reasonably fitted by exclusion of the long lived component, suggesting that if it is present at all, the amplitude of the long lived component (>900 ps) is now greatly reduced. This implies that the excited state population responsible for this component is trapped in a low energy potential well which cannot be ionised by this longer probe wavelength.
 Fig. 5  TR-IY data for EF with 317.5 nm pump and 322 nm probe with two different kinetic fits. Kinetic fit 1 (blue line) yields two time constants: 21 ± 4 ps and 396 ± 57 ps. No long lived step was included in this fit. Kinetic fit 2 yields a 16 ± 5 ps and a 268 ± 75 ps time constant, and also a > 1.2 ns step. 

d. H atom elimination
There has been considerable interest in the H atom elimination dynamics along heteroatom-hydrogen bonds (X–H, where X is usually O or N) mediated by dissociative πσ* states localised along this coordinate. The existence of such states, localised specifically here along O–H, is usually identified by the production of high kinetic energy (KE) H atoms52,55,56 in accordance with the original postulate of Sobolewski and Domcke.57 The H+ TKER spectrum for EF at Δt = 1.2 ns is shown in Fig. 6 (equivalent spectra for MVP and ConA are shown in the ESI†). The TKER spectrum of EF is evidently noisy, due to poor signal level, although one can discern two features; the first centred at low KE (∼2500 cm−1) and a second centred at higher KE (∼12500 cm−1). Using a 20 point moving average (red line, Fig. 6), these two features are more clearly distinguishable. In keeping with our previous studies, the low KE feature is very likely due to multiphoton processes and statistical unimolecular decay on S0.52,53 The second, high KE feature is also attributed to multiphoton processes, based on energy considerations; this peak appears at much higher KEs than one would anticipate for one photon absorption, πσ* state mediated O–H dissociation (see Discussion). MVP and ConA produce essentially featureless TKER spectra. We return to the ramifications of these findings below.

Inset: H+ velocity map image from which the TKER spectrum of EF was derived: raw image (left half) together with a reconstructed slice through the centre of the original 3D ion distribution (right half). The vertical white arrow indicates the electric field polarisation vector of the pump pulse, ε. 
Discussion
We begin our discussion by focusing on the H atom elimination results presented above. We first note that the expected TKER of the photofragments after O–H dissociation in MVP/ConA/EF can be determined (assuming the molecules begin in their ground vibronic state) according to the relationship: TKER = hνpu − D0(O–H) − Eint(1)
In eqn (1), hνpu is the pump photon energy, D0(O–H) is the adiabatic dissociation energy of the O–H bond, and Eint is the total internal energy of the co-fragment (electronic and vibrational). Phenol derivatives typically possess D0(O–H) values of ∼27500–31500 cm−1 resulting in a large, broad Gaussian H+ signal centred around 6500 cm−1 for photoexcitation energies around their origin bands.53,58–63 This is in stark contrast with the observed TKER spectra for MVP and ConA (see ESI†), where there is no evidence of a Gaussian H+ signal within the 1.2 ns time window for these experiments. This is interpreted as a consequence of the intramolecular H bond between the OH and OMe groups, which can be seen in the minimum energy (S0 and S1) geometries for these molecules, shown in Fig. 7. This intramolecular H bond is likely to introduce a large barrier to O–H dissociation, hindering the fast (within our time window) formation of RO + H photoproducts (where R represents MVP, ConA, or EF excluding the H on the OH group).62 It is worth noting, however, that H atom elimination might still occur beyond the 1.2 ns timescale that can be probed in these experiments, although, given the fluorescence lifetime of ∼7 ns, it will not likely be a major competitive relaxation pathway.
 Fig. 7  Optimised S0 and S1 geometries of MVP, ConA, and EF. Geometry optimised structures were calculated using Gaussian09 (ref. 44) with density functional theory (DFT) and the Coulomb attenuated model Becke-3rd parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (CAM-B3LYP) functional45 combined with a 6-31G* basis set.46 Dashed blue lines indicate intramolecular hydrogen bonds. 
In the case of EF, energy considerations dictate that at hνpu = 317.5 nm, O–H dissociation should produce H atoms (and therefore H+) at energies of 0–4000 cm−1 – definitive assignment is not possible as there is no literature (to the best of our knowledge) on the experimental value of D0(O–H) for EF. The small Gaussian feature at ∼12500 cm−1 is therefore likely too high in energy for single photon, πσ* mediated photodissociation. Indeed, with regards to eqn (1), this feature would necessitate a D0(O–H) value of approximately 19000 cm−1 which is very low (cf. typical values ∼27500–31500 cm−1).53,58–63 This feature is not present when detuning the probe wavelength from the H atom 2s ← 1s resonance (see ESI†). This is usually indicative of a one-photon dissociation process. However, absorption of two photons of hνpu = 317.5 nm may promote to higher-lying dissociative states that yield H atoms with much higher KEs, as evidenced in the TKER spectrum of Fig. 6. Alternatively, H atoms could result from dissociative ionisation where the charge remains on the co-fragment.
While the feature at ∼2500 cm−1 does fall in the correct energy range, the Boltzmann-like distribution of this feature, the large barrier to dissociation expected, and the fact that this feature remains in the off-resonance TKER spectrum of EF (see ESI†) strongly suggests that this feature is the result of multiphoton dissociative ionisation.52,53 We note, however, that the absence of a significant H+ signal in the present sunscreen molecules is particularly relevant, since this process would be a potential source of toxic free radicals. The low incidence of H atom release from EF (or MVP and ConA) upon photoexcitation (evidenced from the poor signal-to-noise in the TKER spectrum presented in Fig. 6 and ESI†) may indicate that radical species (from O–H fission) are unlikely to form via this mechanism under illumination from the Sun, given the comparatively low power density of natural sunlight. We finally note from Fig. 7, that the high planarity of the geometries in S1 corroborate the absence of O–H fission in the present systems, in contrast to previous studies in monolignol building blocks, which showed how significant distortion from planarity in S1 could lead to the weakening of the intramolecular H bond and therefore the elimination of H atoms.54
We now move on to further discuss the transients shown in Fig. 2. In MVP, two time constants were extracted from the measured transient; an instrument-limited time constant of <50 fs and a second time constant of >900 ps. In accordance with our previous findings in guaiacol and related chromophores,52,54 the first time constant in MVP is very likely attributed to multiphoton ionisation, via the S1(11ππ*) state, whilst the second likely corresponds to the persistence of excited state population in this state, which outlasts the maximum time window of the experiment. With ConA, a multiphoton component is not observed (as with EF). In these two molecules, multiphoton-induced fragmentation of the ester/alcohol group side chain (see ESI† for EF TOF-MS) required TR-IY measurements to be taken at lower laser powers. As such, observation of a feature from multiphoton absorption is significantly less likely in ConA and EF than in MVP (which possesses the smallest side chain of the three systems).
In EF, the clear presence of two additional time constants of 15 ± 4 ps and 148 ± 47 ps, in contrast with MVP and ConA, suggests that a different (or competing) relaxation mechanism is in operation. It would perhaps be reasonable to expect at least one of these time constants to correspond to E/Z isomerisation, a process found to be operative for similar molecules in previous studies.26,64–66 To explore this possibility further, we have carried out calculations to map out the PECs along the E/Z isomerisation coordinate of EF akin to those in ref. 26. This was achieved by calculating the energies of the ground and first three excited electronic states of EF at various points along the LIIC from the ground state minimum energy geometries of each isomer towards the S0/S3 CI, resulting in the PECs in Fig. 8(a). These calculations suggest that, while the E/Z isomers' energy minima are similar, there is a substantial energy barrier (∼1.1 eV) that must be overcome upon photoexcitation to the S1 origin in order for E/Z isomerisation, mediated by the S1(11ππ*)/S3(31ππ*) CI, to occur. This finding implies that this relaxation pathway in EF can be ruled out in vacuo.
 Fig. 8  (a) PECs of the S0 (black line), S1(11ππ*) (red line), S2(11nπ*) (blue line), and S3(21ππ*) (green line) states of EF along the E/Z isomerisation coordinate. Optimised ground state geometries for each isomer and the S0/S3 conical intersection (CI) are also presented. (b) PECs of the S0 (black line), S1(11ππ*) (red line), S2(11nπ*) (blue line), and S3(21ππ*) (green line) states of EF. The blue and grey shaded areas represent the S0 to S1 and S1 to S2 (via the S1/S2 CI) LIICs, respectively. Optimised geometries for the S1 and S2 states are also presented. 
In light of previous work24,27,67 which has speculated low energy 1nπ* states to be involved in the photodynamics of similar systems to those studied herein, calculations were performed to search for such states. The PECs of the S0, S1(11ππ*), S2(11nπ*), and S3 (21ππ*) states were produced along the LIIC from the DFT optimised geometries of (i) the S0 to the S1(11ππ*) state and (ii) the S1(11ππ*) to the S2(11nπ*) state via the S1(11ππ*)/S2(11nπ*) CI, in the E isomer, as shown in Fig. 8(b). There appears to be a barrierless pathway through which the minimum of the S2(11nπ*) state can be accessed via a CI with the S1(11ππ*) state. Therefore it is possible for an S1(11ππ*) → S2(11nπ*) transition to occur, with the S2(11nπ*) state then being long lived, as observed in previous studies.24 The path to the S2(11nπ*) minimum passes through a deep minimum in S1(11ππ*), where population may become trapped, which could then be responsible for the fluorescence observed. However, neither of these scenarios accounts for all the dynamics observed in EF since they would only yield two time constants; one to account for the S1(11ππ*) → S2(11nπ*) transition and/or motion to the S1(11ππ*) minimum, and the second to account for the lifetime of the final S1(11ππ*)/S2(11nπ*) state. We therefore need to consider alternative mechanisms.
The photophysics of aromatic carbonyl compounds have been extensively reported in the literature to involve low-lying nπ* states of both singlet and triplet character,24,27,68–75 with intersystem crossing (ISC) being a kinetically competitive photophysical process.76,77 For example, Spighi et al.77 suggested a kinetic model for benzophenone, in which a 1ππ* state decays into a 3nπ* state within 5 ps, followed by repopulation to the ground state within 400 ns. While there are structural differences between benzophenone and EF, the presence of the carbonyl moiety, common to both, suggests that these results may be relevant to the interpretation of the present data. In order, therefore, to evaluate the role of triplet states in the photodynamics of EF, further ab initio calculations were performed using CASSCF along with CASPT2 with a cc-pVDZ basis set and a (12,10) active space (vide supra). Four triplet states were identified below the S1(11ππ*) state energy in the vertical Franck–Condon region and their energies are presented in Table 2. The T2(23ππ*), T3(33ππ*), and T4(13nπ*) states are near isoenergetic and lie on average ∼2000 cm−1 lower in energy in relation to the vertical S1(11ππ*) state excitation energy; the T1(13ππ*) state lies ∼10500 cm−1 below these. These calculations match well with triplet state energies calculated using CAM-B3LYP and a cc-pVDZ basis set (see ESI†). Apart from being close in energy to both the S1(11ππ*) and S2(11nπ*) states, these triplet states are also of the correct orbital type to allow for ISC to occur from either accessible singlet state in accord with El-Sayed's rule,78 which states that the rate of ISC will be higher for a transition where there is a change in orbital type (for example, n to π or vice versa). Once within the triplet manifold, the population could then undergo internal conversion (IC) to the lowest triplet state, and from there return to the ground state (or undergo photoreaction).

In light of the information presented above, we suggest the following mechanisms are involved in the photophysics of EF, presented graphically in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Schematic depiction of the proposed decay mechanisms for excited state relaxation in EF. IVR = intramolecular vibrational redistribution into coordinates orthogonal to the reaction coordinate (see details in the main text); ISC = intersystem crossing; IC = internal conversion; Fl = fluorescence; relaxation refers to ISC or phosphorescence back to the ground state; reaction encompasses such mechanisms as photofragmentation/photocyclisation. Note that ‘Reaction’ has been omitted from S1 for clarity, although it is still a valid pathway. 
Firstly, following photoexcitation of EF to the S1(11ππ*) state, wavepacket bifurcation79,80 results in population of both the S1(11ππ*) and S2(11nπ*) states, mediated via an energetically accessible CI between these states. This is evidenced by the relatively flat potential energy landscape in regions removed from the vertical Franck–Condon region (Fig. 8(b)). Intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) then likely occurs on both the S1(11ππ*) and S2(11nπ*) states, with population moving into the deep energy well of the S1(11ππ*) state and the shallower well of S2(11nπ*). Energy is redistributed into coordinates orthogonal to the reaction coordinate in Fig. 8(b), so that population gets trapped in the wells of the S1(11ππ*) and S2(11nπ*) states along this reaction coordinate, as represented in Fig. 9. In competition with IVR, ISC onto several predicted high lying triplet states may also occur from either the S1(11ππ*) or S2(11nπ*), in accordance with El-Sayed's rule.78 Importantly, the potential well of S1(11ππ*) lies lower in energy than the vertical excitation energies of the higher lying triplet states. As such, it is conceivable that, as the wavepacket progresses towards the minimum of S1(11ππ*), it encounters regions of strong spin–orbit (SO) coupling between the S1(11ππ*) state and isoenergetic triplet state(s), facilitating efficient ISC.81–84 This SO coupling would allow ISC to occur while still retaining population trapped in the S1(11ππ*) well. We suggest that all these processes will be acting in competition with each other and are overall described by τ1 (15 ± 4 ps), which is consistent with timescales seen in similar systems.77,85–87
Following ISC onto the triplet state manifold, we suggest that τ2 (148 ± 47 ps) corresponds to IVR and IC occurring down the ladder of triplet states, to the lowest triplet state T1(13ππ*).87 The longer lifetime for IC compared to ISC could then be explained by the relatively large energy gap between the T1(13ππ*) and T2(23ππ*) states. The remaining long lived step would then be attributed to population trapped in S1(11ππ*) – which decays through fluorescence and/or photoreaction (on the order of ns; as is solely the case in MVP and ConA) – in conjunction with population of the lowest lying triplet state (which again decays on the order of ns). While one might expect the triplet state to phosphoresce, the emission wavelengths observed in EF, coupled with the nanosecond lifetime of this emission, suggest that there is little or no phosphorescence from, or fluorescence between, triplet states in EF. This may be due to photoreaction occurring on the excited triplet states or, due to the low energy of the T1(13ππ*) state, ISC back onto S0 may be a kinetically competitive pathway.
We note that the TR-IY of the EF parent ion taken at long probe wavelengths (hνpr = 322 nm) suggest that the long lifetime (>900 ps) represents a state lower in energy than those represented by τ1 and τ2 (vide supra). This is in agreement with the proposed mechanisms, in which either IVR on the S1(11ππ*), or ISC followed by IC to T1(13ππ*), would move excited state population outside of the ionisation probe window of the 322 nm laser. An elongation of τ2 was derived when using two exponential decay functions to fit the 322 nm probe data. Given that both a two- or three-exponential decay function fits the data equally well (vide supra), it is possible that this elongation is merely an artefact of the absence of the third time constant. Since the pump wavelength is unchanged, the elongation of τ2 is likely an effect of the final (ionic) state accessed in the probe step, rather than a change in the dynamics of EF. However, since this change in τ2 has no qualitative effect on the interpretation of our results, such exploration is considered beyond the scope of this work.
Two caveats to the mechanisms proposed are in order here. Firstly, while there is precedent for ISC occurring in systems such as this on picosecond timescales, it has been shown to occur in other related systems in hundreds of picoseconds.88 As such, one cannot rule out τ2 corresponding to ISC from the singlet to the triplet states, with IVR/IC then occurring between the triplet states on much faster timescales.77τ1 would then correspond to IC between, and IVR on, the S1(11ππ*) and S2(11nπ*) states. Population trapped on these two states would then undergo ISC with time constant τ2. Secondly, as we cannot selectively probe the individual conformers of EF identified in the UVHB experiments described above, it is possible that τ1 and τ2 may correspond to the dynamics of the two separate conformers. This is considered unlikely however, as the structural difference, as well as the energy separation, of the two conformers is minimal. As such, one would not expect any significant difference in the excited state landscapes between conformer A and B, and hence the dynamics, in contrast to the order of magnitude difference observed between τ1 and τ2.
From the discussion above, it is clear that the photochemistry and photophysics of EF is highly complex, very likely involving a number of competing deactivation pathways. While we have proposed scenarios that may account for the present experimental results, we do not discount the possibility that there may be others. For example, photofragmentation is a viable pathway in EF. In fact, several fragments are observed in the TOF trace (see ESI†) but attempts to obtain TR-IY transients for these were not successful due to very weak signal intensities. However, it would certainly be worth evaluating the extent of photofragmentation processes in EF, especially given the impact such fragmentation would have on the photostability and photoreactivity of this sunscreen molecule. Further work, such as time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, would be highly beneficial, in enabling us to directly track excited state population as it evolves along the various excited states. Likewise, more extensive calculations involving PECs for both singlet and triplet states will inevitably assist in ascertaining regions of strong SO coupling, putative in facilitating efficient ISC.
Conclusions
The excited state dynamics of EF, a commercial sunscreen filter molecule, have been studied using TR-IY spectroscopy and H+ TR-VMI. MVP and ConA were also studied so that the effects of increasing molecular complexity on the excited state dynamics could be evaluated.
Upon photoexcitation to their respective S1(11ππ*) origin bands, MVP and ConA show similar excited state dynamics, in contrast to EF, which shows markedly different dynamics. The excited state dynamics of MVP and ConA, both resemble the case of guaiacol;53,54 population of a long lived S1(11ππ*) state which persists beyond the temporal window of our measurements (>900 ps), returning to the ground state via fluorescence. The resemblance of MVP and ConA to guaiacol extends to H atom elimination, where there is no clear high KE feature in the TKER spectra, suggesting O–H bond fission mediated by πσ* states is not a viable relaxation pathway in these two systems. This is unsurprising, given the presence of the intramolecular H bond, which likely provides a substantial barrier to dissociation. We believe this decay pathway is also absent in EF for the same reasons; the presence of two weak KE energy features centred at ∼2500 and ∼12500 cm−1 are assigned to multiphoton processes and/or statistical unimolecular decay. By way of contrast, the excited state dynamics of EF are notably different to MVP and ConA, as they now contain three components: one component which decays with a time constant of 15 ± 4 ps, a second which decays with a time constant of 148 ± 47 ps, and finally a much longer lived component which, as with MVP and ConA, decays with a time constant >900 ps. In addition, LIF studies show that EF fluoresces (similarly to MVP and ConA) with a lifetime of 6.9 ± 0.1 ns.
Upon photoexcitation of EF, IC to the S2(11nπ*) state, IVR on both the S1(11ππ*) and S2(11nπ*) states, and ISC from these states onto nearby triplet states are proposed to account for the ∼15 ps time constant. IC then occurs between the triplet states down to the lowest triplet state, T1(13ππ*), in ∼150 ps. We note a caveat that this second lifetime may also be due to ISC from the accessible singlet states. The third time constant then accounts for the excited state lifetime of both the S1(11ππ*) and T1(13ππ*) states, the former of which fluoresces whilst the latter might undergo photoreactions or ISC to S0.
One may surmise from the present measurements that, if the long lived state of EF is particularly reactive, be it through emission of radiation or photofragmentation/photocyclisation, it may interact with other sunscreen components or even DNA possibly leading to detrimental consequences. These measurements also suggest that further pump-probe studies on EF prepared in a more realistic environment, such as microsolvation and/or solution phase studies, are imperative in assessing how external perturbations influence the electronic structure which, in turn, may impact the dynamics. Importantly however, we believe that the present studies serve to highlight the significance of garnering a molecular level understanding of the underlying mechanisms of photoprotection in a commercial sunscreen constituent in the absence of any external perturbations. We hope that such a study will lay further foundations for future research, with potentially far reaching repercussions in developing safer and more efficient UV radiation blocking products.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol (MVP), (b) 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamyl alcohol (coniferyl alcohol, ConA), and (c) ethyl 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamate (ethyl ferulate, EF).	 

 	Fig. 2  TR-IY transients of the (a) MVP, (b) ConA, and (c) EF parent ions following excitation at 305 nm, 306 nm, and 317.5 nm, respectively, corresponding to their S1 origin bands. Also shown are the overall kinetic fits for MVP (red line), ConA (blue line), and EF (green line).

 	Fig. 3  R2PI spectrum (black) and UV–UV hole burn spectra of conformers A (red) and B (blue) for EF. The origin bands (labelled with *) are 317.39 nm and 317.55 nm for conformers A and B, respectively. The IP for both conformers was determined to be 7.73 eV. We note here that the signal from the R2PI spectrum has likely saturated the detector at the highest peaks. This was not avoided as, for the purposes of the current work, we were concerned only with the number of conformers present and the energies of their respective origin bands.	 

 	Fig. 4  Dispersed fluorescence from the origin transitions of (a) conformer A and (b) conformer B of EF. We note that scatter is likely to contribute to the large relative intensity of the peak at the origin of both conformers.	 

 	Fig. 5  TR-IY data for EF with 317.5 nm pump and 322 nm probe with two different kinetic fits. Kinetic fit 1 (blue line) yields two time constants: 21 ± 4 ps and 396 ± 57 ps. No long lived step was included in this fit. Kinetic fit 2 yields a 16 ± 5 ps and a 268 ± 75 ps time constant, and also a > 1.2 ns step.	 

 	Fig. 6  Normalised TKER spectrum obtained for EF at 317.5 nm with a pump-probe time delay of Δt = 1.2 ns. The red line corresponds to a 20 point moving average through the raw data (grey). Inset: H+ velocity map image from which the TKER spectrum of EF was derived: raw image (left half) together with a reconstructed slice through the centre of the original 3D ion distribution (right half). The vertical white arrow indicates the electric field polarisation vector of the pump pulse, ε.	 
TKER = hνpu − D0(O–H) − Eint	(1)

 	Fig. 7  Optimised S0 and S1 geometries of MVP, ConA, and EF. Geometry optimised structures were calculated using Gaussian09 (ref. 44) with density functional theory (DFT) and the Coulomb attenuated model Becke-3rd parameter Lee–Yang–Parr (CAM-B3LYP) functional45 combined with a 6-31G* basis set.46 Dashed blue lines indicate intramolecular hydrogen bonds.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) PECs of the S0 (black line), S1(11ππ*) (red line), S2(11nπ*) (blue line), and S3(21ππ*) (green line) states of EF along the E/Z isomerisation coordinate. Optimised ground state geometries for each isomer and the S0/S3 conical intersection (CI) are also presented. (b) PECs of the S0 (black line), S1(11ππ*) (red line), S2(11nπ*) (blue line), and S3(21ππ*) (green line) states of EF. The blue and grey shaded areas represent the S0 to S1 and S1 to S2 (via the S1/S2 CI) LIICs, respectively. Optimised geometries for the S1 and S2 states are also presented.	 

11nπ* (S2)	36122
11ππ* (S1)	35148
13nπ* (T4)	33782
33ππ* (T3)	33620
23ππ* (T2)	32752
13ππ* (T1)	23258

 	Fig. 9  Schematic depiction of the proposed decay mechanisms for excited state relaxation in EF. IVR = intramolecular vibrational redistribution into coordinates orthogonal to the reaction coordinate (see details in the main text); ISC = intersystem crossing; IC = internal conversion; Fl = fluorescence; relaxation refers to ISC or phosphorescence back to the ground state; reaction encompasses such mechanisms as photofragmentation/photocyclisation. Note that ‘Reaction’ has been omitted from S1 for clarity, although it is still a valid pathway.
